RodnReal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633248,"The reality of this upcoming hike is that it very well might be a section hike. Though I’ve attempted to get into shape and reduce my pack weight, I will be attempting this hike on a knee replacement. Though I walked the Camino DeSantiago three years ago on this knee replacement, it’s difficult to anticipate how well it will do on the Appalachian Trail. Hope to meet a few of you out there for as long as I can last. RodnReal",,View Entry,"Mar 14, Sun",0
RodnReal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633483,One day to go! Fly into Atlanta by mid morning and then to the trail by early afternoon via shuttle driver Frank Higgins.  Weigh in tonight- base weight 19.2 and with five days of food 26.8. Happy to be under 30 pounds but hoping to shed more weight in time. Ideally I’d like to have it under 25 pounds after a resupply. ,,View Entry,"Mar 19, Fri",0
