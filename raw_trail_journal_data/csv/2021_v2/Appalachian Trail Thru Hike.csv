Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633226,"Hello! If you got here without knowing who I am somehow, I'm Ken, and I plan on hiking the Appalachian Trail.
I am beginning my journey in mid April, and this is where I will be updating my journal(shooting for 1-2x/wk). This has been a life goal of mine for a few years now and it feels almost too good to be true that it is coming to fruition. I often get asked- ""Why are you hiking the Appalachian Trail? What the point?- My response varies but the core elements stay the same.

I am someone who loves to be challenged. I seek out activities that not only push my limits, but help me create a new definition of the work limit itself.
I am someone who tries to live life to the fullest. I want to have a treasure trove of stories for my children and grandchild, of grand adventures, life changing experiences and inspire people with my tales.
I have a deep appreciation for nature and all its beauty. What better way to learn to live with nature than to immerse myself in it for 6 months. I hope to see bears(not eating my food, preferably), walk slowly and purposefully through the trees, and grow my appreciation for the world we live in.
I seek growth. I know this journey will push me physically(I will gain/lose enough elevation to have climbed Mt Everest 16 times when I am done), mentally(hours of prep for gear, planning, logistics), emotionally(being far from family and friends) and spiritually.

My life is only just beginning, and I plan to live it.

The journey of 2,190 miles will begin with a single step.",,View Entry,"Mar 13, Sat",0
Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634648,"The first question every person asks me when I tell them I am hiking the Appalachian Trail, without fail, is""Are you going with anyone?""And my answer is always the same.
I'm going alone.

People have a variety of reactions, ranging from concern for my safety, why I would want to do something like this solo, to how I will manage alone in the woods for months on end. And the truthful response I have back for their concerns is I am as mentally, physically, emotionally ready as I have ever been in my life. I have been training a lot over the past year and recently lost ~10 pounds from running long distance a few times a week. I have been backpacking alone many times and am comfortable in the woods and nature, I understand the threats and act accordingly. I am confident in my skills, my carefully researched and selected gear, and most importantly, myself.

As the beginning date draws ever nearer, (one week out!) I feel a mix of nervous energy and excitement. I recognize this as an amazing, likely perspective/life altering journey that will allow personal growth and introspection beyond anything I have ever experienced before. I also recognize that 80% of people who intend to thru-hike the Appalachian trail fail to do so.

My goal for the first few weeks will be simple. Take it slow(No more than 15 miles a day for first week). Appreciate the trail. Have gratitude for all opportunities, decisions and people who have allowed me to begin such an amazing experience.

I would like to thank everyone who has enabled me to begin this trail. 
Family
My mom who has supported me with the logistics/planning and will be ground support team(will send me supplies to swap if needed). My father who has instilled a work ethic and patience in me that allow me to make carefully thought out decisions. My sister with whom I have learned to appreciate nature and taught me more than I can list. My brother who has helped me through the pandemic by working out with me and pushing me to new physical heights.
Friends
My friends where I went on my first backpacking trip up Marcy(My pack weighed ~50 pounds). And showing my friends backpacking and hiking helped me rediscover the hobby with fresh eyes and pushed me to learn more so I could be a better teacher.

With a team like this, I am not going alone, I'm bringing all of you with me. 

Happy trails!",,View Entry,"Apr 11, Sun",0
Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635207,"My flight was nothing of note but my drive here was... a trip. My shuttle driver was a bit much for me, and everyone who knows me must be wondering how on earth someone can be too much for me, cause I am a handful.
He was very dismissive and condescending towards plans I had in place when Iwas asking his opinion about things, laughing at my decisions a few times. I am not pretending to Be an expert but I was coming from a place of genuine curiosity and he was continually making fun. Then when I asked more questions after I asked like three questions he says I‚Äôm burned out I don‚Äôt want you to ask me anymore questions. On top of that he was easily one of the most aggressive and impatient drivers I‚Äôve ever driven with which made the entire trip up stressful. ¬†
Gave my first trail name to Momma‚Äôs Boy. He spoke twice about needing a picture for his mom then tried to send his location at the shelter to her, so I told him my thoughts and to sleep on it. Either way he gave me permission to call him mommas boy so thats a win
It was my first day hiking today and although I‚Äôve only covered for miles 3 miles positive on the Appalachian Trail I‚Äôm feeling good. I feel ready, I feel confident, and also I am proud of myself that I only covered four miles today that I am going to pace myself. Tonight I am sleeping at a shelter alone because I guess it‚Äôs so early into the trail that no one stops here but there‚Äôs a peace to being alone in the woods I‚Äôve really grown fond of.","

Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635208,"Met some cool people today, and continued to force myself to go slow. I only covered 12 miles, which meant I started late(9:30am) hiked slow and still finished the day¬†around 4pm. My legs felt wanted more, my brain wanted more, but I knew better.
At least I think I do, cause Im doing 16 miles tomorrow ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I got the first trail name I liked so far. Crash. Because I decided to tarzan swing into a tree. Am I going to keep it? Maybe. I will ask others for thoughts and see which one speaks to me.
I got my first trail magic(mints from some kids) then smoked a joint with an old man who had a hole in his jeans right at the crotch. Such is life out here though. Im trying to learn how to say yes to life more and be more confident in social situations, its tricky not knowing what good trail equiette is. Is it rude to walk slow so I can think alone when I was hiking? Maybe it is but I need to ensure I do what I need to do to get the most out of this trail. I need space to think, and had some very fruitful insights once I had the space.
My mind went to how my whole life I seek challenges. I push myself to grow, without stopping. But I often focus so much on the end goal, I forget to enjoy myself along the way. So I‚Äôm going to do just that. Not focus on Maine but focus on living.
Last thoughtWe randomly found a deck of cards at the shelter so I taught people how to play Duroc today(Logan, S_____(netherlands name) and Cody) it was dope. I didnt lose once.","Stover Creek

Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635519,"Stayed at my first hostel tonight, it was recommended by Rich on the trail, Above the Clouds. Its run by a wise man who goes by the name Nimrod. He is easily one of the most experienced hikers I have ever met in my life, he has done the AT 3 times, among other impressive feats. I wanted to try my hand at staying in town, I liked the idea of a shower a welcome addition to the hike.
The hike itself wasn‚Äôt so bad, everyone was hyping up blood mountain to be this monster, multiple stopped at its base fueling up and resting to ready themselves, which I found interesting because it was around 800ft climb. I listened to some crazy music and didn‚Äôt stop til I was up that mountain.¬†
We got slightly sidetracked at the top of the mountain and then climbed down with a guy from Boston, Surf and Turf, and Tall Tale(I gave that name).
I got another bad night sleep, not asleep¬†until midnight¬†then up¬†at 6am. I am undeniably anxious about returning to the trail, as its going to be cold tonight(low 30s) and my gear is not that warm. But honestly, after how relaxed and easy last night was I think its time for a little bit of a challenge. Also supposed to be thunderstorms Saturday so that will kick ass!
Feeling a bit spoiled, a bit anxious, and Im having difficulty connecting with this trip so far as I feel so unsure about the future, but I will try to breathe and enjoy myself more.","Gooch Gap Shelter

Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635521,"Solid day hiking today despite my late start. Hostel life seems to be a slower pace than what I‚Äôve grown used to. I normally start my hiking¬†around 7am(wake up¬†at 6:30¬†breakdown camp and go) then hike until 12 when I stop for lunch.
One thing many don‚Äôt think about when thinking about camping is just how rare hot food is. I only cook 1 meal a day (always dinner so I go to bed with hot food in my stomach), as it takes too much time and fuel to cook more than one meal a day. Lots of ultra light enthusiasts would scoff at my cooking setup and prefer to cold soak their food. I dont know much about cold soaking because once I heard the word cold I was out.
I digress.
So we managed to leave the cabin around 9 to drop me off first at Neel Gap, I was about 15-20 miles further than everyone else in the cabin. Started hiking¬†at 9:30¬†and within my first few hours I ran into Syrdor and Logan! I was happy to see them because they are good people and we played leap frog basically all day. I told them I was having a late lunch at Low Gap shelter and possibly , so Logan came down when they were passing to tell me their intentions to hike further. I took that as an invite to camp together which we are presently doing üòÅ
Also got to see Surf ‚Äòn Turf again today, hes a stand up guy.
Last random thought, met a man named Machine today and he has earned his name for sure. He did the PCT already and started hiking 24 miles first day and 26 today, which blew me away.
As for hiking today it was not too difficult. The terrain was forgiving (lots of flat areas with just dirt), only one tough climb but it was short, and it was cool all day which made me require much less water(no sweating). I have minor surgery I will need to perform on my feet tomorrow(blister on R heel and R big toe by nailü§ï)
My main concern is staying warm tonight. It was SUPER windy all day and is going to drop below freezing tonight. Which is great because my overquilt is rated for 40 degrees.
For those who don‚Äôt know heres sone camping facts. When buying a sleeping bag or quilt(way better) the rating of the bag(20 degrees, 40 degrees etc) relates to how cold it can be for survival. So if you are in a 20 degree bag and its 20 degrees you‚Äôll live. Likely won‚Äôt sleep but you‚Äôll live. You should always have a bag rated 10 degrees colder than you expect it to be for comfort.
So. I am in a 40 degree quilt. In a hammock. Tonight will get below 30. I think I‚Äôll live but we‚Äôll have to see in morning. I write this journal inside of my quilt wearing every article of clothing I have with me. 2 socks, sock liner, 2 pairs of boxers, shorts, pants, base layer shirt, tshirt, soft shell, rain jacket, bandana and hat. And honestly, I‚Äôm pretty close to sweating. Hope I don‚Äôt regret saying that once the sun sets.
If you read this far I‚Äôm impressed. Enjoy your warm bed tonight and be grateful for it, the alternative is... challenging.
but I like a challenge.","Neels Gap

Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635522,"It was cold last night. The coldest night I‚Äôve had in a while. The craziest part? I slept better every other night so far. INCLUDING my stay at the hostel. I think my body kicked into survival mode and there was no room for thinking/ overthinking.
My method described in the last post worked super well. I was warm¬†until around 3am¬†when I got a cold butt so I took out hand warmers I had taken from the hiker box at the hostel. (Hiker boxes are places where people drop unwanted gear/weight and you can score some pretty sweet items)
Starting hiking today was brutal. I went for a ‚Äúcold start‚Äù where you wear way less than what the temperature dictates in hopes of warming up from hiking. It worked okay at best.
I used my rain coat as a windbreaker and sun blocker to continue to let the slight sunburn on my arms to heal. With proper venting it worked incredibly well.
As I was traveling today I noticed a slim looking man by a camp fire. ¬†Slim, his trail name, was a nice guy from Tennessee who was taking his first zero day due to knee pain. He emphasized how he will be going slow and steady; wants to enjoy the journey not just run to Maine. I appreciated my conversation with him and the warmth his fire provided me.
The last thing of note for today was the trail magic I got. I‚Äôm going to make an entry to update all the trail magic I get along the way.","Low Gap Shelter

Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635523,"Today was the easiest day yet. I knew I was only hiking 7 miles to the Around the Bend Hostel, to take my first 0 day(no hiking) and wait out the thunderstorm¬†this Sunday.
I have been feeling really good on the trail, my feet have very minor blisters and shoes fit well, my legs are sore in the beginning of the day but I hit a certain point of homeostasis, where I can move up/down hills with no discomfort, a flow state where I just move through the woods. I don‚Äôt think about the miles and often cover long distances without even realizing.
One of the coolest things is when you suddenly stop hiking in the woods. You look out into the trees and you can almost feel the forest breathing. It may be an optical illusion but I can feel them move closer/further slightly and feel their energy. I know that sounds super hippy-ish but I have no other words to describe it.
I had a few moments of gratitude while hiking today. Moments where I stopped, took a deep breath and stated something I was thankful for.
When I got to the hostel I was pleasantly surprised to see Machine was staying here. I was blown away to be crossing paths with someone who is moving at his pace. Turns out my I initial vibe was correct, he is a great guy and easy to get along with.¬†
We went to a all you can eat buffet with the most average tasting food that I proceeded to gorge myself on. I ate 2 very full plates with fried chicken, fried fish, potatoes, pudding, salad, and so much more. I got so full it was crazy, then 3 hours later proceeded to eat 2 full ramen and a personal pizza. The hiker hunger hasn‚Äôt hit me fully yet, but I definitely feel it coming.
At night we built a nice fire and just shot the shit for a while. It was a great day.","Swag of Blue Ridge

Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636500,"Today was the follow up to my ambitious 24 mile day. I had the honor and distinction of passing the 100 mile mark! It felt good and reassuring, despite only being 5% of the way done ü§™
It was a standard day hiking, listened to some good music, listened to a stand up routine and met some kind/friendly section hikers along the way.
I‚Äôm getting good at getting trail magic. I noticed a couple getting ready at their car at a parking lot along the trail so I took just a littttle longer cleaning out my trash; lo and behold I was presented with an ice cold Coors Light. I thanked them profusely and promptly downed the whole thing(no way am I carrying the weight of an empty can on trail!)
Many of you reading this who know me may be wondering why I‚Äôd even want that because I am not a drinker. Well, 120 calories I didn‚Äôt need to carry is MORE than welcome in whatever form it may come.
As the day progressed I started to get worn down. I slowed to a crawl going up the mountain wondering why on earth I was killing myself so early in the trip. My hip/knee muscles felt okay, it was my feet that hurt between the ever expanding blister on my right heel and the achy-ness of my intrinsic foot muscles.
Suddenly a guy around my age popped up behind me and I gave him room to pass. I rarely get passed while walking on the trail, often being passed by people I did earlier during my siestas.
He begins talking to me and I feel obligated to keep up with him. He started a good conversation, asking me to tell him something about myself but it can‚Äôt be where I am from, so I knew he was good company right away. Screw small talk, lets get real.
And real we got. We had numerous good conversations that allowed me to finish my hike with little complaints.
We got to camp and met Alex, an ER Doctor taking an overnight backpacking trip. He was an awesome dude too, and I spent the whole night trying to convince him to do a thru hike.
We were all sitting around the fire when Bard got out his ukulele, which he then proceeded to play a song he wrote himself, which was so good I didn‚Äôt even realize it was an original.
We sat there as he wrote another song in front of us, me suggesting some lyrics (shout out to the line ‚ÄúHuman existence that we hold so dear‚Äù) and asking him philosophical questions about the song to help inspire him. The result was really great and I got a video of him doing it, which I hope captures how nice his voice really is.
I slept that night without a tarp so I could look at the super moon. It was breathtaking and beautiful.
This is what Thru hiking is about. Meeting people. Having new experiences.
Living. Truly, wholly, living.","Carter Gap Shelter

Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636501,"My hike sucked in the morning. Pain on pain, damp socks because I misplaced my other pair at the hostel. It was brutal.
I made it a few miles in when I noticed Bard and Trip in a nearby camp. They had sent night hiking the night before in the super moon (no way was I doing that after a 20 mile day) and were sitting eating their breakfast. I sat with them and downed a few ibuprofen to help some of the pain when I noticed a large man on the trail.
Steve! From around the Bend. I remember thinking earlier that day how sad I was that I wasn‚Äôt with anyone from that group and that I was likely hiking too fast to see them again. To my surprise, Steve had been pushing 20 mile days for 3 days in a row, so we were on pace to finish at the same shelter tonight.
He walked on but I caught up to him shortly after throwing out a pair of underwear (too many ounces, not because of grosser reasons I swear), and we began hiking together.
So began a beautiful hiking friendship. His pace was slightly faster than mine, but doable, and we had many great conversations ranging from parties we been to to video game strategies. Conversation ¬†just flowed naturally.
We finished the day (after he was horrified by my lunch: Sour Patch Kids, Gummy Worms and a handful of granola) at a shelter which apparently had rattlesnakes all over the place, but we both didn‚Äôt see one.
Learned some good things about rattlesnakes and how to stay safe.
Supposedly: the smaller ones are more dangerous because the young rattlesnakes don‚Äôt know how to regulate their venom. Additionally, you should close up your pack and sleep with your shoes or they may be curled up for you in the morning.

Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636502,"Me and Steve started hiking at a reasonable time (8am) and took a pretty slow and steady pace up some pretty unforgiving climbs. Luckily, they ended relatively quickly, and so began our massive descent into NOC.
We descended thousands of feet over the course of 4-5 miles and were welcomed with breathtaking views on ridges and in the forest itself.
I started that morning frustrated as none of my clothes were drying out and my shirt was smelling worse and worse.
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve mentioned that yet, but I smell bad now. Like alarmingly bad. Like you should leave the subway car if you smelled me bad. And even with me bathing in smoke from the fire Blaze(fitting name) made last night it didn‚Äôt even cover the stench.¬†
I choose to go shirtless to reduce me smelling that abomination and to prevent excessive sweating as I suck in humid conditions.
We got to the NOC and who do we see? THE MACHINE! He has apparently blacked out drinking the night prior and didn‚Äôt even remember getting a room at the hostel. This guy is turning out to be quite the character and I like it.
Me and Steve picked up a few things at the NOC(outfitter store literally next to the trail) he had ripped his pants and I needed new socks and some food. I found cookies that had 500 calories a cookie, so I figured a cookie, snickers and cheese on tortillas would be a good lunch choice (spoiler alert: I was right).
We sat at a restaurant right next to the outfitter and both got 1/2 pound burgers and I got fries and potatoes as sides. It was a welcome meal being able to sit in a chair with a back rest and have food that didn‚Äôt just taste like salt and olive oil.
As well, the restaurant sat right on the river which was lovely.
While we were packing up to go I noticed an older man waving his had to me in his car. He seemed to be in distress and was holding a towel to his head.
Then I noticed the blood.There was blood dripping down his entire face and he clearly was scared. I ran over to his car and began assessing the situation. He told me he had been fishing and fell and hit his head on some rocks. When he moved the towel I noticed a decent gash on the top of his head but it wasn‚Äôt bleeding too bad.
I immediately ran and called 9-11, as head injuries are nothing to play with. I sat and spoke to him while waiting for the ambulance to distract ¬†him and assess if anything changed.
Do you know the signs of a stroke? An easy and basic way to recognize the signs is the acronym FAST
Face- does half the face droop/look off?Arm- numbness/inability to raise ¬†arm normallySpeech- Slurred/ garbled/ nonsensical when speaking¬†TAKE ACTION- immediately call 9-11 and say you think it‚Äôs a stroke
Remember- time is brain.
The final thing to note was when we got to camp. It was a chill day, only 13 miles. That is seriously not a brag, if your full time job was walking in the woods 13 miles would be a chill day for you too.
I met two guys right away, Chris and Eric?(Cant recall right now). Both were thru hikers without trail names.
Well, as I spoke to Eric he said the word ‚ÄúPerfect‚Äù like 8 times in like 5 minutes. So I looked up at him and said ‚ÄúI got the perfect trail name for you- Perfect‚Äù He thought about it for a second and after some slight encouragement from me and Steve he adopted it. Another trail name successfully given!
While we were at camp a tramily (trail family) came into our camp. We had seen them at the NOC and they were a group¬†around 12-13, massive by trail standards.
They were kind of annoying to be honest, there were some really cool people in the group but I was pretty put off by a few of them and they had a demeanor like they owned the camp site.
And one of the guys in the group started giving me unsolicited advice on hammock camping.

Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636503,"I made it to Fontana. I set a stretch goal and I crushed it. I set the goal of reaching Fontana from Around the Bend by Friday, 90 miles in less than 6 days(more like 5) because the post office in Fontana closes for the weekend¬†on Friday at 3:30pm.
And it‚Äôs a good thing I did, because Momma Connolly(my ground team) sent every piece of food I wanted and a few I didn‚Äôt even know I did. Crushed it mom, thanks!
I did 24 miles¬†Sunday, 20¬†miles¬†Monday, 16¬†miles¬†Tuesday, 17¬†miles¬†Wednesday, 16¬†miles Thursday and did the last 6 to get to town today.
It was tough. But it felt good to push myself and achieve the goal I set. I got to listen to angry music while basically sprinting uphill, which was quite fun to be honest.
We got a shuttle into town that cost 3$ per person, which was awesome. We got first lunch(2 hot dogs with chili, nacho cheese and a cherry coke) followed by second lunch (chicken tenders, french fries and Hawaiian punch).
I don‚Äôt know what it is about hiking but it has made me a sugar fiend. I have never really had a sweet tooth even when I was young. Yes I would eat candy when it was there, but I rarely sought it out on my own.
Now Snickers, Soda, Sour Patch Kids are running in my veins.
I theorize the obsession with sugar is due to me using all my carbs when walking throughout the day, because I feel noticeable increases in energy directly after eating candy.
-To play like a champion you need to fuel like one-
Nonetheless, it was a good day despite waking up to a damp world¬†this morning. It rained overnight and I managed to stay mosssstttllly dry but had a few drops sneak in. I‚Äôm contemplating buying a bigger tarp for my hammock. It may be worth the extra weightü§î
Let me tell you something. Appreciate your surroundings right now. Wherever you are. Do it. Because you are most likely dry. I have been trying to dry my underwear out for 3 days. They are still damp. You have no idea what it is like to be in a humid environment where you can‚Äôt dry out your underwear for three days. Its the worst.
We did some laundry in town(DRY FINALLY) then head back into the woods. We were planning on taking a nero today(6 miles) then a zero tomorrow but the forecast says 3 days of rain next week¬†starting Sunday. I don‚Äôt want to zero into a rainy day, so we hiked on despite my feet‚Äôs bitter protest.
We have a new friend in our tramily! Chris from the shelter two days ago has been tagging along with us. He quiet and a bit of a loner, but I like his vibe. Very chill.
We are in the Smokies now. Apparently, freaking everyone saw bears today but I didn‚Äôt see one so that sucked. There‚Äôs always tomorrow!¬†Also I didn‚Äôt write one for yesterday cause not much happened and I was tired. One thing of note is I kicked a snake while walking. Not on purpose.

Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636504,"Today was another good day on the trail. I started hiking very slowly because I just felt like it. I didn‚Äôt want to rush and was enjoying the environment.
And boy did I have a lot to enjoy. Today I walked through a field of flowers that seemed to extend forever. I heard a constant buzzing from the hundreds if not thousands of bees jumping from flower to flower. It was magical.
I hiked mainly alone today, which was good cause I felt like listening to music and dancing while hiking.(don‚Äôt knock it until you try it)
We met some nice people at our pit stop for lunch, one girl by the name Bluegrass was there doing a section hike, contemplating turning it into a full blown thru hike. She apparent was set to start PT school May but is considering putting it off until next year to do the hike.
I told her 2 things. 1) fantastic career choice you are going to love your job. 2) there will ALWAYS be a reason to not thru hike. Jobs, family, relationships all will give reasons to not hike. Do it today so you don‚Äôt regret it tomorrow.
It‚Äôd be cool to see her again in Maine.
Finally we ended the night (only me and Steve, Chris AKA Pillowtalk started at a shelter 6 miles back) around a fire while shooting the shit with some cool people.
I met Mermaid(told lots of dolphin facts), Mike(let me ‚Äúgreen blaze‚Äù with himüî•), T-1000(climbs hills like a robot), Jessica, and Zack.
Good people good vibes. Told them to meet us at the shelter in 13 miles which Mermaid said would be her longest day yet. Man it doesn‚Äôt feel like we are going that fast but when I hear things like that I feel super human for the days we put in.

Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636505,"We didn‚Äôt take a zero day in Fontana for two reasons. One, a mini cooper festival made all available rooms booked. Two, rain was a coming.
And it came.
Im actually really happy with how I set up my tarp, I kept my underquilt dry and didn‚Äôt have any rain come in despite the wind picking up a few times. I‚Äôm trying a new weighting technique where I weigh down the side I believe the rain will be worse with a full water bladder, and it prevents the wind from lifting my tarp and getting me wet.
It works great. For the night. Unfortunately there is no tarp for when I am hiking along the trail. Just rain.
I wear a rain coat but no rain pants, as I find as long as I keep my torso warm and dryish I can deal with the soaking wet legs. Also I hate the feeling and sound of rain pants. That swishing haunts my dreams.
I‚Äôm happy with my set up. As long as I am moving I don‚Äôt get too cold and even though I am soaked I can keep moving.
I spoke to Spelunker during my hike and got some good insight into how to deal with sopping clothes. He said when he is caving the humidity is 100% so he cant hang anything to dry. Instead he wears what he wants to dry and his body heat plus movement dries it out. I tried it tonight and let me tell you, MY UNDERWEAR IS NO LONGER DAMP. Gamechanger.
I spent a large portion of the hiking(20 miles today) alone without music. It felt good to reflect on why I was out here, that accepting suffering as a natural part of life can be both freeing and empowering. I cannot make my clothes not wet. I can‚Äôt make the trail less rocky. Yes I will have to hike directly up that stream. But all of that is okay. I am okay.
I found a mantra helped me today in my hiking. I repeated over and over‚ÄúI am strong, I am capable, I am warm‚Äù
And I felt strong. I knew I was capable. And I got marginally warmer.
Another interesting thing to note was some... religious overtones came up today. I am wearing my first piece of jewelry ever on this hike. My parents thoughtfully gave me a Saint Christopher necklace, the patron saint of Travellers and Storms(and epilepsy?) As I trudged through the rain I thought about how safe I have felt with this on and how my idea of God is a fluid and undefined thing for me. And as I thought about who/what God is to me, a light shown through the trees and enveloped me in warmth.
Was it a coincidence? Likely.

Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636506,"The day started with a clear goal. Get to Standing Bear Hostel. 18 miles.
Piece of cake.
And it was in the morning. We had little rain overnight and no rain from when we started hiking(7am)¬†until around 10am. Then the lightning we had seen in the distance all day descended down on us like fat guy falling down stairs.
Torrential downpour. I was walking slowly without my trekking poles up until that point and even asked Steve to hike further away because we saw signs of bears (prints & fresh scat) and I was trying to see one before we left the Smokies.
Once that rain started all bets were off. I started moving on the trail towards warmth and dry clothes with pure determination.¬†
I saw Bluegrass along the way and she started hiking behind me. I began asking questions about what she wanted to be a PT etc and we had many good conversations, with me only getting on a Soap box once or twice.
We ended up getting to the hostel in really good time, rolling in¬†around 2pm, because we didn‚Äôt even stop for lunch or water all day.
The Hostel is... weird. We got a cabin for 4(including a guy we just met, Knowhere) which only ran us 35$ a night. The bunk room looked cramped and smelly, for 10 extra dollars to not have to share a space with 20 other hikers sounded like a steal.
There‚Äôs just an off every about this place. It feels like they cut every corner to maximize profit, and honestly don‚Äôt run a clean, efficient or comfortable hostel.
The dryer takes about 1.5 hours to dry your clothes after you having to hand wash all your clothes. I saw more dirt come out of my socks than I thought was possible. I guess that‚Äôs what 150 miles of no laundry will do to them.
In the cabin we had a great night. We played cards and I taught Durok to a new group, and Bluegrass taught us all Up and Down the River, an interesting betting card game pretty similar to Euchre.
It feels good to be dry. Feels good to be warm. Feels good to be out here.
I made it though the Smokies. I‚Äôve hiked 240 miles without any serious problems I couldn‚Äôt solve on my own.
Through my hard work and preparation I am beating the odds. At this point, 50% of prospective Thru Hikers have quit.¬†
My goal is once again to SLOW DOWN. We will do a zero in Hot Springs(just 30 miles away) and recoup there as this place is weird and I don‚Äôt want to stay here longer than it takes to dry off.
Also, side note, it‚Äôs crazy how much trust they put in the hikers at places like this. We were given a clip board and can walk into the pantry and need to list everything we buy and how much it costs. No double checking, no cashier. Crazy IMO, but maybe that‚Äôs just the New Yorker in me talking.","Tricorner Shelter

Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636507,"I think I may have gotten the fabled ‚Äútrail legs‚Äù. I noticed I can power up an intense hill pretty fast without my legs burning. I feel stronger and more capable than I ever have before. We did 16 miles today and except the massive climb in the afternoon where I had little water it why very smooth.
We even got into camp before the rain got too bad. Having dry socks and shoes sitting in a shelter while it rains outside is a fantastic feeling.
We are planning on doing a zero at hot springs, me, Steve, Bluegrass and Spelunker. I really like this group.
Steve is fantastic company and just the right level of goofy and serious. He can jump from intense philosophical conversations to jokes/references from earlier in a moment notice. He is my trail mate for sure.
Bluegrass is a kind hearted person who has strong faith and values. Talking to her about PT makes me realize how great it really is as a profession. She listens very non-judgementally to my ridiculous ideas and life choices which is appreciated.
Spelunker is easily one of the funniest people I have ever met. He has such a dry sense of humor and such monitor delivery that 90% of people don‚Äôt realize he is joking; meanwhile I am dying next to him. Very knowledgeable too, I love picking his brain about gear.
Hopefully we can zero at an airBnB with a hot tub. That would beBEAUTIFUL.
And Im getting a larger tarp. I‚Äôm tried of having such a finicky set up, that alittle extra wind means wet hammock. Wet hammock means sad Ken. No more sad Ken. I‚Äôll deal with the extra 9 ounces for double the coverage. I‚Äôll feel like a king.","Standing Bear Farm

Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636508,"We made our way to Hot Springs today, covering ~18 miles and rolling into town by¬†2:30. Pretty solid timing by my standards.
We were hoping for an AirBnB(more importantly a hot tub) but was disappointed to find there were none close or good options.
The Hot Tub will be another day. I swear it.
It‚Äôs funny, because anyone who spends more than a few days with me will see something. The key to how I get things done.
I get fixated on an idea and will not drop it until it materializes. Whether it is pizza, a hot tub, or who knows what‚Äôs next.
Nonetheless, I had a great day today. The hiking was tough enough to get the blood pumping but not too hard that I felt overexerted. The trail literally goes through Hot Springs which is a lovely small town where they love hikers. And you can feel the love in the stores, restaurant and the somewhat the Hostel.
I chose to hammock camp after seeing the beds at the Hostel, I‚Äôd be 3 feet from the ceiling and in a room with 12 smelly hikers. Hammock is more comfortable than a bed and less smelly. Easy choice.
I ate so much food today. I ate 2 pop tarts, trail mix, a burger with 2 10oz patties with fries, half a house salad, a burrito, and a plate of mozzarella sticks. It was glorious. Gotta feed the muscles right?!?
WE ALSO FOUND MACHINE AGAIN. He texted me when we got into town asking where we were and he had been zeroing at Hot Springs past couple days so we got to hang with him again. He‚Äôs like an actual celebrity all the hikers know him by name. It‚Äôs wild.
I seriously am very happy with the crew I found. They are funny as hell, easy to get along with and hike at a similar pace. I am so thankful for this experience and the people I have met along the way.
Also I may change my name from Siesta. I found out another hike has that name and I don‚Äôt want to be the second Siesta. And I don‚Äôt feel like fighting to the death right now. I‚Äôd prefer to sleep.

Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637244,"Today was an important day.
It was our zero day in Hot Springs North Carolina. We made plans with the owner of the hostel known as the Happy Gnomad to stay there, with them shuttling us in at 2. Plenty of time to complete our town errands (ie cleaning, resupplying, stuffing our faces full of food)
My resupply was the following (prepare to be jealous)
4 King Sized Snickers4 Sour Patch Kids Watermelon3 Ramen1 Instant Fettucini Alfredo2 Idaho Potatoes1 Premade Tuna Fish2 Hostess CupcakePack of Cosmic Brownies1 Pack of CookiesFull Sized SausageBlock of Cheddar CheesePack of Tortillas
Ok maybe you aren‚Äôt jealous, but you should be. This stuff tastes good out here.
We spent some time in town hanging out Me, Steve, and Bluegrass; then met Spelunker for lunch at the diner. We sat and I hit the bathroom, and as I exited I apparently had perfect timing; Machine was there with Trip and was in middle of asking Steve where I was. So I emerged to everyone looking where Steve was gesturing and I put my hands up and I said ‚ÄúHere he is‚Äù. I felt like a celebrity.
After lunch, only me Steve and Bluegrass went to the hostel, as Splelunker wanted to stay back and edit/upload his hiking video to youtube (https://youtube.com/channel/UC3_owenwEE6pI7Rs7jC5B1g)
When we were getting picked up we were greeted by the most stereotypical Rastafarian man I have ever met in my life. He had dreadlocks, was super positive and stoked to see us, and had just good vibes. I liked him immediately.
We went back to his lovely home/hostel and were greeted with enormous hiker love and great accommodations. Laundry was included (with a dryer that worked), there were 2 private bathrooms (one with a huge bathtub), TV with movies, plenty of room to relax and a beautiful porch with a swing.
For 15$ a night. I may move in.
The people there were nice too, we met a guy named Hawaiian Flying who was changing his name to Hawaiian Trying because he had sprained his ankle and was zeroing until it healed. (Upon examination his ATFL, CFL were intact, was negative to high sprain, mild sensitization to all motions with high reactivity, negative for signs of fracture: diagnosis- Grade 1 Lateral Sprain.)
During our time there it felt time to approach an important topic. It was no secret me and Steve were a solid trouple(trail couple). Now Bluegrass was fitting in quite well too, as she has a great positive attitude and can carry on some intense deep conversations (which anyone who knows me knows that‚Äôs my jam). As we sat at the table where I would later eat 2000 calories of frozen pizza I looked at Steve and said:
‚ÄúI think its time. I feel she is ready. What do you think, are we going to be a tramily[trail family]?‚Äù
Steve looked thoughtfully for just a few seconds before nodding.
Bluegrass meanwhile was smiling on the other end of the table.
I added one request for her prior to joining, would she be willing to accept the new trail name ‚ÄúDeferred‚Äù in reference to her deferring PT school to be out here.
She agreed enthusiastically.
And so began a beautiful thing.

",Happy Gnomad Hostel,"May 07, Fri",0
Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637245,"Today we set out with a goal in mind. Steve had found on GutHook(basically a social media app/navigation for the Appalachian Trail) there was going to be trail magic at a place slightly off the trail in the form of
Nachos. And. Margaritas.
22 miles away. It might as well been on the moon cause we were getting there no matter what.
We got a good early start thanks to Jumanji(the Rastafarian who ran the Gnomad) dropping us off in Hot Springs¬†at 7:20. We climbed some nasty hills in the morning and all three of us spoke about relationships(friendships and romantic), life, what we‚Äôve learned, how we‚Äôve grown, and how dope Nachos will be. Mainly about Nachos realistically though.
We had a one track mind and covered 19 miles before taking our lunch, which made us all a bit cranky. It didn‚Äôt help I underestimated the amount/frequency of water and hiked ~5 miles dehydrated with no water. That kinda sucked.
We met Logan and Stynar(Now the Flying Dutchman) at the shelter and mentioned the plan for nachos and they seemed interested.
We carried on and got to Jones Meadow, where we hiked up a large hill to an empty parking lot. Just as I began to lose hope, thinking maybe it was a lunch deal not dinner we saw people waving us down to the valley below.
It was so on.
We got there and the trail angel Nacho Momma(name given that night) was serving up nachos with guac, salsa, queso and beans. Although the beans were cold and the queso mildly solid, it tasted delicious. Any food I don‚Äôt need to carry on my back is good food.
Now the interesting part. Hiking a long distance trail brings together all walks of people. Some people looking to grow, some looking to be challenged, some looking to have fun; and some to... party? I guess thats what I‚Äôd call it.
Well, I focused on the nachos to start because there are more calories in nachos that margaritas.(priorities) There were a few guys around the margarita station that all gave me bad vibes.
One kid around my age began engaging me in some of the most pseudo-intellectual conversations I ever had in my life. He would ask me a question(like I mentioned I wanted to change my trail name) then theorize the reasons I wanted to change my name. When I clearly explained why I wanted to change it, rather than accept it he began asking if I was sure it wasn‚Äôt one of the reasons he listed. Like bro. Chill.
Then I met a man named Sweetwater who began asking me if I knew about existentialism. Now I‚Äôm no expert in philosophy or existentialism in particular but I told him I knew some of the main ideas. He began telling me how Fredrick Neitzche was the founder of existentialism, and I asked if he meant Nihilism out of genuine curiosity. It was at this point he picked up the knife they were using to break up the ice and began waving it, talking about how Neitzche had nothing to do with Nihilism and he wanted to talk about existentialism.
He can talk to the trees for all I care because I dipped out of there fast.
The night progressed to us building a nice fire while a woman thru hiker was crying up on the hill. I had no idea why she was crying, I knew she was super drunk and didn‚Äôt think anything of it. It wasn‚Äôt until I noticed multiple people trying to get yet ANOTHER drunk out of their mind hiker to leave that I learned he had apparently hit her. I got riled up real fast, violence is a no go around me and violence against women is something that triggers me really hard.
I noticed the father(Nacho Mommas husband) trying to gently talk to the hiker to get him to leave(they already had kicked out Sweetwater for being too drunk) and the hiker was not registering what he was saying. He kept looking for fist bumps and talking literal nonsense as the father(Andy) tried to gently coax him to go.
When Andy walked away without making any progress I approached him and asked him if he needed any help. I mentioned I was hearing rumors that the man had gotten violent and if he wants him gone for the safety of his family I‚Äôd be more than happy to ‚Äúmotivate‚Äù this woman beater to leave. Andy seemed reluctant, but frankly I was not sharing a space with a drunk scumbag like that.
As I walked back I noticed the hiker actually packing up to leave. Apparently Steve had read the situation and just literally walked up to the guy reached his hand out and said ‚ÄúNeed a hand to get going?‚Äù And the guy got up and left.
Nice job Steve.
I would not have been as nice. Probably not as effective either. This is why we make a good team. When we need diplomacy we got Steve.
If that fails I can step up.
Lets hope that won‚Äôt be necessary.
Also to add, Spelunker came to the hiker feed independent of us telling him about it(apparently there were signs?!?) and we got to hang out with his goofy ass all night. The dude is nothing short of hilarious. I think he may be the fourth member of our Tramily. I already asked him to adopt me but when he found out about my student loans he backed out real fast.

",Geralds Gap?,"May 08, Sat",22
Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637246,"The day was a good one, despite the fact we started off backwards. In order to get back to where we left for the trail magic we had to walk back to the last white blaze we passed(according to Deferred). She is what is known as a ‚ÄúPurist‚Äù in that she has to complete/pass every white blaze for it to count. She‚Äôll just keep us honest I guess.
Due to that diversion, we walked back 1.2 miles, then had to go NOBO back 1.2 miles. We then had a plan to walk ~17 miles, so a 19.4 mile day. We are terrible at slowing down apparently.
I mentioned to the tramily that I‚Äôve been wanting to stealth camp(camping at an unmarked site in woods) recently, as I was tired of the crowds at shelters and wanted a quiet night.
After an exhausting day we set down our packs and ate a quick dinner. As I set up my hammock I felt some light rain. We were exposed on a ridge line with wind occasionally whipping through.
You know how I mentioned I may want a bigger tarp? I was wrong. I needed a bigger tarp.
It became apparent quickly in the night that I was in for a rough go. No matter how tightly I tied my tarp down the wind would inevitably pick it up and I would receive a face full of ice cold rain. I slowly felt my hammock and underquilt beginning to get damp from the rain. I tried to readjust my tarp but the changing wind direction plus relentless rain made my tiny tarp utterly useless. ¬†
Despite mother natures best efforts (at times the wind was so great my hammock/trees I was attached to shook violently) I survived the night. I curled up in a tight ball right in the center of my hammock where the tarp mainly was, and managed to stay dry enough to maintain some warmth. I managed to get 2 hours of sleep, and planned to hike 30 miles to Erwin the next day to dry off.
In the morning I heard Steve rummaging around in his tent and I told him about my night and my subsequent plan. He was surprised to hear I had such a rough night, he knew it was bad but managed to stay dry. Apparently Caveman overheard my troubles and offered me a coffee(I took him up on a Hot Chocolate instead).
Between the condolences for my rough night followed immediately of poking fun at me for being a hammock camper, it made me grateful for my Tramily. They supported me and agreed with my plan to shoot for Erwin(although the plan changed to we‚Äôd get a ride from road in 20 miles instead of doing 30).
Those miles were rough. I was exhausted, wet, and grumpy. I‚Äôm surprised Deferred hiked with me at all at first because of how miserable I was. I just felt foolish and unprepared, but I must learn from it.
We had really amazing conversations about a variety of really varied and sometimes difficult topics. We both have very different upbringings, viewpoints, and life experiences; and the conversations flow with respect, open-mindedness and introspection.
And today with us feeling so crappy and needing good distractions meant our conversations kicked ass. We both learned a lot and I grew a-lot of respect for her as a person.
We got to Spivey Gap(20 miles completed) and quickly realized e we had 0 service to call a shuttle. We ran up and down the road looking for service with Steve and Deferred half-heartedly hitch hiking. I connected with a shuttle, and arranged a pick up. Shortly after hanging up a young woman and man rolled into the lot we were in, then started turning to go back to Erwin. We made eye contact and I shot out my thumb. She stopped and asked if we needed a ride.
Yes we did. First successful hitchhike!
I called the shuttle to cancel and were driven in by 2 lovely people who were checking out the place they planned to day hike then heading back home to Erwin. The trail provides I guess?
We stayed at Uncle Johnnys and to be honest the bunk house smelled like a gym locker room and had the heat and humidity of a sauna. It was welcome compared to my prior night.
The important thing about that night is I survived. It was incredibly unpleasant. At times I was contemplating how to deal with hypothermia if it arose. But I survived.¬†
And at no point did quitting even cross my mind. Suffering in life is inevitable, and if I grow to accept that I will be a stronger person for it.","Geralds Gap?

Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637247,"We finally got to try another thing I was curious about- Slack Packing. That is when you arrange your hiking to not require you to carry your pack for a number of miles. In this case, we were technically 10 miles before Uncle Johnnys, so we would leave our bags there, get a shuttle back to Spivy gap and hike the 10 miles back.
It was a lovely walk. We spoke in depth about religion, as Steve and Deferred are both strong believers in Christianity, and I identify as Atheist. It was insightful to hear about their relationship with Jesus, their faith in the unknown, and conviction in their beliefs.
And they dealt with my incessant questions, nit picking, and thoughts. Which was nice of them.
They know I‚Äôm in an ambiguous relationship with organized religion and they don‚Äôt try to push their beliefs, nor me push mine on them.
Its spectacular how well people can communicate when there is mutual respect and understanding.
Also we saw a barn owl up really close in the middle of the day. That was really amazing.
We later rode bikes into Erwin(with Deferred breaking hers at towns edge), I ate far too much Mexican foos, played cards, then went to bed. It was a good day.","Spivy Gap

I was thoroughly annoyed when I learned that, especially knowing the breakfast shuttle be leaving town¬†at 10:30am.
I ended up getting my healthy complete breakfast of a cheeseburger and fries at Pals across the street. It was sub-par at best.
I still want Wendys. And a hot tub. Alas, I can only dream.
The day was just... cold. Dark. It rained all morning and there was just a chill in the air that wouldn‚Äôt go away. Some people barely left their hammocks all day(looking at you Deferred).
I met this woman named Jackie Rose who was super down in the dumps. She had bags under her eyes, a defeated look and slouched posture. It was clear she was struggling with something fierce.
I gave it the college try. My whole life I have been very good at and enjoyed taking one on one with people and helping them problem solve, build confidence, and complete goals. My favorite/best jobs always revolved around that core duty.
In highschool I was a tutor.College I was a personal trainer.Now I am a Physical Therapist.
I love helping people and building them up.
But some people can‚Äôt be helped. And that‚Äôs something I am learning, slowly and reluctantly. It will have to come from within her to complete this trail, but realistically I highly doubt she will. She doesn‚Äôt have a clear vision, no discernible reasons to continue on the trail beyond her hating her last job, and had an incredibly negative perspective. Tough combo to walk 2000+ miles.
The day was mainly uneventful. Steve watched movies, Caveman edited his latest video, and Deferred cocooned in her hammock.
It was a lazy day, as we couldn‚Äôt go anywhere because we were leaving for trail days the next morning.

Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637250,"I came to trail days with 2 distinct yet equally important goals. I wanted to talk gear with some vendors and buy a new tarp, and I wanted to do some hippie shit.
I achieved both.
We shuttled from Erwin Tennessee to Damascus, where Trail Days always takes place. Its basically a music festival without music and less trash left behind (leave no trace runs deep).
We chose to set up in the field, as we heard it was quieter than the woods. We figured we could party if we wanted and leave when we were done.
Welllll setting up a hammock in a field (soccer field to be precise) is difficult when you are in a hammock. So me and Deferred needed to set up in the woods next to the field (luckily it wasn‚Äôt the rowdy woods).
We wandered around the first day, coming across... interesting people in the woods. A lot of face tattoos, strange outfits and stranger vibes. But I lived in NYC for a few years and we just call that Tuesday.
We got free food pretty often, people just offered as you passed, setting up tables of trail magic. It was highly welcome.
After we got our bearings, before going to sleep I asked the group if they would go to the drum circle the next night with me. They all agreed, with the condition they wouldn‚Äôt have to participate. Of course they wouldn‚Äôt have to, but I can be quite persuasive.
The next day I met with some vendors and started taking hammocks with some incredibly knowledgeable people. I learned that I know nothing about hammocking and there was massive amounts of room for improvement in my setup. Fantastic news if you ask me.
I was recommended to meet Dutch, from Dutchware gear to discuss options and potentially buy a tarp. Let me tell you, he is a stand up guy. He patiently and throughly explained his system, how to use it and its benefits. He had previously thru hiked(2006) and was one of the only hammock capers back then. So he developed his company out of the need for quality hammock camping gear.
Well we figured out the best option was a 11ft rectangular Dyneema tarp with 6 potential tie outs and his rigging system. My current tarp is essentially a diamond that just barely covers my hammock, and is about 64 square feet, and weighs a femur shattering 9.7 ounces!
The tarp I will be receiving will be around 2x the coverage and ~2 ounces lighter. It wasn‚Äôt cheap, but with my birthday coming up my parents were generous enough to offer to get it for me as a birthday present.
Thanks Mom and Dad!
So I got the hammock, but there was another thing on my list...
Here is what I wrote the night of my dancing around a fire. I wanted to write it with the experience still fresh in my mind:
What an experience trail days has already become. From the strange, to the fascinating, to the primal, it was an experience.
I can‚Äôt capture it with words. I wish I could, and I‚Äôll try my absolute best to describe it.
My best comparison: it‚Äôs like a second cousins birthday party where you know some of the people, there‚Äôs copious amounts of alcohol, and you have a blast by the end.
Tonight I saw such amazing things. I saw a group of homo sapients dance around a large fire chanting. There were minimal if any cell phones recording. People were existing in the moment, for the moment, and just devolving to a more primitive state.¬†
I saw all this because I was in the center of it.
We all had some drinks at our tents as the evening transitioned to night. We were sharing stories about strange occurrences on the trail, the group was Steve, Deferred, Caveman(the to be named Tramily); Machine, Trip, Deja Vu(who I swear I‚Äôve met before), Blu-Ray and smoritto(.com). Also we had met a girl named Hannah who was doing her own hike across country from Cali->Virgina(not the American Discovery Trail, one she mapped out). She had already hiked 2700 miles and only had 350 left to go. Very interesting journey.¬†
After the sun set you could hear the drums start. I was curious how bold Steve/Deferred would be, and was pleasantly surprised to see their enthusiasm about going to the drum circle.
Granted their enthusiasm was at best reluctant curiosity. But we still went so: Score!
We showed up to the large field with about 150-200 people surrounding: a massive bonfire, 3 large plastic drums being beaten mercilessly, and ¬†people dancing around a tiki torch.
I saw the 2 people dancing around the tiki torch and figured that would be a good place to start. I jumped into the open circle and proceeded to
TearUpTheDancefloor.
Anyone who has seen me dance likely are not too surprised by this. I love dancing. I get to move my body any way that pleases me, while allowing music to flow through me. I don‚Äôt dance ‚Äúwell‚Äù per se, I just have a grand ole time. I began encouraging people on the edges of the circle to start dancing, and man did we dance.
The drums had an ever present pounding that made your heart beat harder, as you move with this mass of people. It was hypnotizing.
I swear this was the most hippie-shit I have ever done in my life.
They started a few chants of just repeated ‚ÄúHeys‚Äù in a beat. The kind of Hey that doesn‚Äôt come from your mouth. It comes from your chest. I dare you to try in right now. Try chanting ‚ÄúHey‚Äù from your chest for like 10 seconds. Its super energizing in a crowd of 100. Trust me.
I went back out to the Tramily(who were right in the mix of crowd) and asked them how they were doing.
Steve was smiling saying how he saw me dancing in there.
Deferred looked half horrified, half terrified.
Caveman had the face of honest intrigue mixed with pure enjoyment.
So it was going super well so far. As we stood there, I asked Deferred to yell as loudly as she could. Like she didn‚Äôt have a care in the world what people thought. Just yell.
She was reluctant.
Steve joined me in encouraging her to yell. We agreed to all yell at same time so she wouldn‚Äôt have to yell alone. So Caveman counted down from 3 and we all yelled.
We all yelled.¬†
Then I wanted to up the ante. I always go by the philosophy that if I act like a complete fool with no reservations, that it takes the pressure off everyone else to have fun.¬†
So, at Steves(Teflon may be his trail name) suggest/dared me to take my shirt off and dance near the massive bonfire.
So I did. And it was wild. The bonfire was easily 20ft wide and people were going in a circle around it and limboing. I began requesting lower and lower limbos managing to get as low as my waist. Trail legs seem to be multi-functional...
I wanted to get the crowd riled up so I stepped in the pit, hit my foot on a 6 ft log repeatedly while hollering my lungs out. The embers jumped 20 ft as the crowd exploded in war cries.
Ok now it feels like I‚Äôm writing Lord of the Flies. But I mean, this whole event could have been in that book and fit perfectly.
Nonetheless, after meeting some nice people(Indy who can limbo like no other), and me acting like a total lunatic; I sought out the tramily to recover my clothes. Steve(Teflon?) had been tasked with the important duty of making sure I don‚Äôt lose my clothes and freeze to death. He did a stellar job. If you ever need someone to hold things responsibly Steve is your guy.
We all worked our way back into the crowd by the tiki torches. We were dancing closer and closer to the drums when suddenly Deja Vu pointed out that Blu Ray was in middle of the drums banging away. It was awesome to see, he was crushing it, and just completely absorbed in the moment.
I started to encourage Steve to go on the drums, but he repeatedly denied it. I tried to negotiate, offering the unopened beer I had for him to go on the drums. I thought it was a fair deal but he persisted. He told me pressuring him would make him less likely to do it.
Ok forget pressure then. Lets make this epic.
I went to the center of the crowd by the tiki torch and began to shout like an old squire,
‚ÄúIs there anyone at ALL that can help these drummers? Are there any musically talented people available?‚Äù
I looked around dramatically when I saw Caveman raise his hand. I called on him and he pointed to Teflon(Steve!). This time it stuck. He strutted over to the drums and after being briefly interrupted, was then handed a mallet drum with by none-other than Miss Janet(the most famous trail angel). It was nothing short of poetic.
Steve proceeded to rock the drums fitting right into the rhythm, adding variety even guiding the tempo.
As he continued to rock, the guy next to me was trying to start a chant. So I told him my plan to start one and he agreed to help.
I waited until a slight opening in the drumming then yelled at the top of my lungs,
‚Äú When I say Hey you say Ho!‚Äù
Hey!- Ho(only the one helping me responded)
Hey!- Ho(now about 10 people respond
Hey- HO!! (Nearly the whole crowd is responding at this point)
This continued for ~10 more times, me yelling ‚ÄúHey!‚Äù alone and having 200 people respond ‚ÄúHo‚Äù. I had to call it quits to prevent my vocal chords from snapping after shouting for so long. I had been looking up and when I looked down I found Caveman grinning ear to ear saying ‚ÄúThat was awesome‚Äù
I agreed wholeheartedly.
Later we all were dancing while Steve (Teflon!?) was pounding the drum, even Deferred was in the middle of the crowd bobbing to the music. It was great to see her enjoying the experience.
Beyond dancing, fire dancing shows, limboing,I had such interesting interactions too. I heard this guy(Woodman) and girl(Hippie Singular Rocks Plural) having an intense discussion in the most stereotypical Long Island achcent I‚Äôva eva hearrrd. It was absolutely absurd but downright hilarious.
I couldn‚Äôt reconnect with the Tramily toward the end. They all seemed to go there own way, hope they all got home safely.

Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637251,"We got what we needed out of trail days. All of us had our boundaries pushed, learned something about themselves, and got a hell of a story out of the experience.
So we planned to escape Trail days a bit early and get back on the trail. Honestly we were all missing it. Crazy right?!?
Steve managed to get us a ride with one of the people from Southern Ohio Trail Magic(his friends who were doing trail magic at the event) who took us right back to where we left off.
We were on the trail for only 4 miles to get to the shelter we planned to stay, but there were very limited hammocking options with an abnormally large number of hammockers.
I haven‚Äôt been keeping an official count but my guessitimate would be its about 1:5 ratio of hammock:tenters.¬†
For whatever reason this shelter was more like 1:1, with very limited trees.
I decided to journey onward to a campsite only a short walk away to set up alone, figuring that after all the social interaction of trail days it may be good to be alone.
And it feels nice.
Despite the twigs actively breaking around my hammock and dogs howling in the distance. At least I hope its dogs.

Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638293,"These trail journals don‚Äôt feel as necessary right now. It‚Äôs funny, because something that was so novel at first has already become routine.
Over the past few days we have been moving, quite fast.
Caveman wants to get to Damascus(126 miles away)¬†before Saturday¬†so he can receive his package.
126 miles over 6 days, just need to average more than 20 miles a day.
Crazy that this is now considered an attainable goal.¬†
So far we have done a 24.8 mike day, a 22 mile day, and an 18 mile day. We don‚Äôt need to rush too much because we plan to do the ‚ÄúDamascus Marathon‚Äù which is a 26.2 mile stretch from Iron Mountain Shelter to Damascus. The elevation profile is supposedly one of the easiest on the AT, and shouldn‚Äôt be too bad.
There were a few noteworthy events over the past few days I would highlight. One is I was charged by what I thought was a grouse that scared the crap out of me. Deferred nearly stepped on a 3-4 ft black snake. And also she finally lead hiking after claiming to be too slow and was literally the fastest hiker I‚Äôve ever seen.
Roan mountains was an interesting change of pace for the AT. The AT is affectionately referred to as ‚ÄúThe Green Tunnel‚Äù as you are often so surrounded by trees that it obscures any views beyond a short distance. In the Roan Mountains we hiked over many ‚Äúbalds‚Äù which are tops of mountains with no tree coverage. It was amazing to be able to see miles of the trail unfolding ahead of us and being exposed to views all around us.¬†
While me Steve and Deferred hiked, I noticed a man coming up quickly from behind us. This always strikes me, as I have stated in the past its rare for people to pass me while on the move. I realized as he got closer it was the Machine!
He asked to pass us which we let him, then I kept up with him as Steve and Deferred hiked slightly slower behind. Me and Machine had many interesting conversations, the man has no filter and neither do I, so we shared a lot in a short amount of time. Keeping pace with his 3 mph pace(I normally average 2.5mph) while having intense conversations was something that I actually thoroughly enjoyed. It made the next 8 miles fly by.
We stayed that night at Station 19e, a hostel right off the highway. I got to pet a big dog named Diesel and it was nice.

Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638294,"Today was a great hiking day. We only needed to cover around ~15 miles and supposedly we were going to be passing some prett nice waterfalls.
And oh boy we did.
As we(Me Steve Caveman, Deferred was up ahead) moved we got to a side trail for a waterfall that was gorgeous. It was only .2 miles off trail and we were able to refill our water bottles. I was impressed.
Little did I know the main event was in a few miles.
We continued hiking without much incident.
There are many ‚Äútypes‚Äù of hiking with a group:
Conversational Hiking: where we walk close enough to eachother to talk and have varied conversationsClose Hiking: we walk within talking distance but don‚Äôt for whatever reason, sometimes someone is listening to music, but most of the time my mouth is tired from talking üòùEyesight Hiking: you walk far enough apart that you can see the people of your group but not be able to talkSolo Hiking: you walk so far apart you see nobody from your group
My preferred hiking really depends on how I feel. I describe myself as an extroverted introvert, i.e. I enjoy talking to people(especially one on one) but require alone time to recharge. Often we start hiking as type 1-2 then the group naturally drifts apart. Someone will need water, or start hiking faster or just wander off(looking at you Caveman).¬†
I am very fast uphill(I think it‚Äôs because of my short legs relative to my body size) so I tend to lead the group and will rest at the tops of hills for the group.
You never really have a dull hike with a group like this. I enjoy specifically seeking out each member of the group for some hiking one-on-one so we can have conversations.¬†
With Steve(Teflon) I enjoy having intellectual conversations, sharing fun facts, and debating political/scientific topics. He is an incredibly intelligent person that you don‚Äôt need to fact check 98% of the time. If he is telling you something, he is confident he knows the answer.
With Caveman I enjoy picking his brain about gear, hiking and caving. His experience and expertise is clear when speaking to him, I already have learned a great deal from him and always appreciate his insight. Also he makes some of the most ridiculous jokes and it kills me. I‚Äôve told him he should do stand up.
With Deferred I enjoy having discussions about PT or introspective conversations. Our conversations will often begin with a question like ‚ÄúWhats a trait you admire in others‚Äù or ‚ÄúHow do you hope to grow on the trail‚Äù and letting the conversation flow from there. She is an open minded, introspective person who shares a growth mindset with me.
We also have good conversations as a group hiking but it can be tough due to logistics. The person in the back will be 20 ft from the person up front, and with wind/birds it can be hard to hear what they are saying. Especially when they aren‚Äôt an Italian from New York so they don‚Äôt know how to project their voice.
So that‚Äôs how we hike. Now back to the waterfall.
We came upon the waterfall right¬†around noon, Deferred was already sitting at the edge waiting for us. ¬†The waterfall is about 30ft tall with a large pool in front of it, a perfect swimming hole. I think to myself how I am 100% going swimming in there and I should convince the group to do the same. As I approached Deferred before I can even say anything she tells me she is going in.
Okay. That was easier than expected.
I strip down to my underwear and begin making the painful journey out into the water. It is all rocks the size of footballs, submerged and slick with algae, so just walking on them your feet consistently slip and bang your ankles. I ended up having to bear crawl to even get out there, and once it was deep enough began swimming.
Did I mention it was mind-numbingly cold?
I look back and see Steve and Caveman making their way out similar to my method, about as successfully as me too. While I was trying to convince Steve to go under, Caveman slipped and submerged himself.
‚ÄúSee? Caveman went in without a problem!‚Äù I said to Steve annoyingly.
He was not amused.
I then shifted my attention to Deferred, who had been scaling the rocks around the perimeter of the pool. The sharp, jagged, moss covered wet rocks. So I began to get nervous. I asked her what her intentions were and she pointed to the rocks adjacent to the waterfall, informing me she planned to climb them. I vetoed that plan multiple times, telling her to just swim in the water instead, but she persisted. Her stubbornness trumped mine this time.
She climbed about 25-30 feet up the slick rocks, then turned around and told me she planned on jumping in. I went into half-panic half-protective mode and began thoroughly searching the area she planned to jump into for any rocks/unseen threats. Once I found a good spot she jumped. I was relieved when I saw her surface and gained respect for her courage, cause no way in hell would I do something like that.
We got out, me more thoroughly shivering due to spending so much time in the water, and Caveman offered me his sweater to warm up as I dried off.¬†

Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638295,"Today I accomplished a goal I set for myself. And I‚Äôm damn proud of how well I did.
There are certain ‚Äúchallenges‚Äù and traditions on the AT. Some are more famous and well known than others. Most challenges revolve around hiking a certain distance in a set time, some get pretty creative. I won‚Äôt tell you the traditions I plan on doing, you‚Äôll have to wait for me to do them. üòù
This challenge was a straight forward one, and one we planned on doing as a group(each at their own pace). It is called the Damascus Marathon. The challenge is to stay at Iron Mountain Shelter, then hike into the middle of the town of Damascus. When completed you will have hiked 26.2 miles, a full marathon.
That will be the farthest I‚Äôve ever hiked in a day. So naturally I upped the ante, saying I will complete it in less than 8.5 hours. I would need to average over 3 miles an hour, with no stopping for lunch and including time to filter water.¬†
I began the day after Deferred had already left camp, just before¬†7:00am. I began with my plan, which was to book it on the flat portions(~3mph), climb uphills at a steady 2.5 mph pace, then literally sprint the downhills. I have learned to really enjoy sprinting downhill, I love the challenge of planning my steps and needing to calculate step length to prevent rolling an ankle or tripping on a rock/root.¬†
I passed Deferred within the first 30 minutes, which surprised me, because I knew she was being competitive about the marathon and know she has a naturally fast pace.
So I felt good about my pace, combined with the music hitting just right; I knew I was going to do well.
The terrain was some of the easiest we had seen all trail. Very mild uphills with super long gradual downhills. At one point I left the woods and as I began to move toward a pasture I noticed some unopened cans of coke on a rock nearby. I thanked the Trail gods and chugged a coke while moving into the pasture.
I hiked through a literal farm, entering a fenced in area with cows munching on the grass. That was super interesting and slightly intimidating. Cows are huge up close.
I continued the day, sprinting past multiple hikers and scaring the hell out of quite a few of them. Most hikers are not used to someone literally sprinting up behind them, but in my adult life I have grown fond of being weird so the strange looks I received did not phase me.
I was using my Garmin watch to track my pace and saw I was averaging around 3.3 mph, covering 10 miles in the first 3 hours. I was happy with my progress, and decided to check GutHook(an app used to navigate the AT) to see how far until the next water source. What I saw made me nearly choke on my snickers.
I was actually 13.5 miles in. I was averaging more than 4 miles an hour. Holy crap.
Me, being the over achieving, mildly masochistic person I am created a new goal. I will complete the marathon in less than 7 hours.
The game was on. I looked and saw the next water source was 2.8 miles ahead. On the AT you can normally get water every 2-3 miles with some stretches being ~5 miles without water. I often carry no water whatsoever and instead ‚Äúcamel up‚Äù at a water source, chugging 1-2 liters of water and hiking to the next water source. It reduces the weight I have to carry and keeps me hydrated.
Well, normally.
This time I missed the water source. I looked at GutHook and realized the water source I planned on using was actually 1.5 miles back. No way am I adding miles to the marathon day, theres a deadline to beat! So I looked to see where the next water source would be...
7 miles away.¬†I had no water with me.¬†It‚Äôs 80 degrees out.
Oh boy.
I have hiked dehydrated before. On one of my gear testing hikes I misjudged how often water would be available and ended up having to suck water out of candies I had in my bag to make it. I shouldn‚Äôt get that desperate right??
Wrong. I was so much more desperate. At one point I came across a Southbound hiker and asked him for some water (the water source was still 4.5 miles away at this point) and he was generous enough to give me about a cup of water.
Let me tell you, when you are severely dehydrated hiking miles in the woods it is literally impossible to think about anything but water.
I tried to distract myself.I tried to notice the trees-oh man those are green I wonder if I chew on the leaves if I‚Äôll get any waterI tried to think about getting to town-oh man I can‚Äôt wait to drink ice cold water at the Diner
There was no distraction. No thought about anything but water.
About 3 miles out I started hallucinating the sounds of a stream running nearby.
About 1.5 miles out I started fading, feeling like I could faint at any moment.
I resolved myself to push on. I reasoned the only way to get to the water was to walk. Nobody could walk for me, and complaining will not help. So I focused every ounce of energy I had left and hiked on.
The water was a side trail .2 miles off the AT and when I got there I drank literally 2 liters of water within 5 minutes.
I still felt horrible, but it was a start.
Hiking out after eating some salty snacks to replenish my electrolytes my muscles were so crampy and sore I felt like I was a new born horse learning to walk.
But the time was still ticking. It was going to be close.
So I pushed to move as quickly as I could safely down the mountain (only 2.5 miles left to finish the marathon) got into town (1 mile left, 15 minutes on the clock) and ran though the town park, past the stores I had been at a week earlier, and looked at GutHook.
26.2 miles1:54pm
I completed the Damascus Marathonin just under 7 hours. Average speed of 3.75 mph.
I never felt so proud. Or was I feeling sore and dehydrated?
Not sure, but if you ever want to do a the Damascus marathon, may I suggest carrying some extra water? I heard it may help.

Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638296,"We slowed down a bit after the marathon. I think we all felt the effects of doing big days, the increasing heat and not really resting since Trail Days.
My feet are so sore. And honestly for the first time since building my trail legs I felt muscular soreness in my hips and legs. So I requested we as a group take it alittle slow and to my thorough surprise it seems we actually are!
We hiked 12 miles out of the Broken Fiddle hostel(IMO a forgettable experience) to a campsite near the Virginia Creeper trail, a former rail road that has been converted into a bike path. Of course we didn‚Äôt hike ON the nice flat trail, instead we went up and down mountains next to the trail. Thanks AT!
We hiked without Deferred as her parents came to visit her and make sure she isn‚Äôt hiking with crazy people. I told her multiple times then meeting us would only cause her poor mother to lose more sleep but apparently we passed muster.
The next day (May 23rd) was way more eventful. We walked into a beautiful patch of flowers at the edge of the Graceland Highlands, a place where wild ponies roam. That much was very obvious as we had to avoid the plethora of landmines the ponies had left for us.¬†
We made it to the shelter on a slow and steady pace, reconnecting with Deferred and Caveman along the way, hiking 16 miles to the shelter.
I found a good hammock spot to set up, having my hammock very high to avoid the gratuitous amounts of horse poop on the forest floor. It was everywhere. In massive piles. But it didn‚Äôt smell because it was old and dry. So I wasn‚Äôt really phased. Living in the woods changes you, it‚Äôs crazy.
That night we played Euchre by the shelter and I met a fellow hammocker(section hiker) named Margie who was one of the only people I‚Äôve ever met that can out talk me. I was impressed.
That night,¬†around 3am¬†I was awoken to the sound of tapping behind my hammock. I had set up my rainfly(tarp) in a way that I could look out my hammock so I sat up to see the source of the noise. To my surprise and delight there was a pony literally walking underneath my hammock.
I whispered to Deferred(Hammock Homies found a spot together) that there was a pony nearby. She groggily replied, but her tarp was so encapsulating there was no way for her to look out and see it. The pony meandered around our hammocks and went over to the tenter nearby named Rhino. He turned on his headlamp and I whispered to him telling him there are ponies nearby and to please not spook them. The last thing I needed was a panicked pony running full speed into my hammock.
The next morning I asked Deferred about hearing the ponies and she was surprised as she thought that was a dream. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Nyquil is some heavy stuff apparently.
The next morning we hiked out and into these picturesque meadows. The terrain required your attention, as there were many loose rocks and opportunities to roll your ankle.¬†
We wandered into fields of ponies multiple times, unfortunately none seemed to warm up to us. There was a tramily we met earlier that had ponies lick the salt off their legs and bags. We just didn‚Äôt look tasty enough is my guess.¬†Their loss.
It was an incredibly unique day of hiking in terrain, environment, and wild life, with little elevation gain/loss.¬†
Another word for today would be happy trails.
One last thing of note was it is May 24th, the day Deferred would have began PT school. I discussed a plan with Caveman and Steve to surprise her with Fireball or something to celebrate and we managed to save a few shots from when her parents visited. So we toasted to the journey and eachother, it was hecking cute.","

Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638297,"I thought hiker hunger would be a gift. My thought was it will be like being able to eat anything I want and not worry about gaining weight.¬†
I did not realize the extent that my unrelenting hunger would begin to torment me.
When we left Damascus I left believing I had packed 4-5 days of food. In fact, I left a pack of Pop Tarts behind and told Steve I believed I packed too much. Now, I am almost out of food on day 3 and that includes candy I received as trail magic the other day (2 snickers and a pack peanut m&ms) and a MASSIVE Italian dinner tonight.
Today we hiked 19.1(not 20 as Caveman likes to correct me) miles to a shelter that a local pizza place will actually deliver directly to.
Motivation in its purest form.
The hiking was uneventful beyond some really good morning conversations where Caveman shared his work experience as a Chemist. Did you know he worked on the team that developed Non-Formaldehyde based insulation, basically changing the industry standard? Well now you do. And you will never not know that. You‚Äôre welcome.
It was a very interesting and insightful conversation. Following a lunch where we watched a spider eat an inchworm we continued to hike. The heat was oppressive, but the humidity made it nearly unbearable. The sweat was pouring off of us and you could not drink fast enough to replenish what you were losing. It was brutal but livable. I find even when it‚Äôs very uncomfortable conditions it is still possible to slip into my flow state where I don‚Äôt feel the miles pass and I can cover large distances. Its harder to get into, and more effort to maintain but it is possible.
I was hungry all day. I have little snacks left and felt my body still trying to replenish from all the big mile days over the past week. When we got to the shelter we immediately got the menu and began plotting our plan of attack.
My plan was simple.12 inch Chicken Parm Sub with side of FriesA Large(more apt description is aggressively massive) Cheese CalzoneGarlic Bread2 Liter of Dr¬†Pepper
That should be enough right? Steve was nice enough to offer to cover a majority of the bill(this guy is 2 Miracles from Sainthood I swear) but I felt the need to still contribute due to the massive amount of food I was ordering, which he graciously accepted.
I searched for cell service while waiting for the food to arrive with no luck. I have been trying to contact a good friend Josh to coordinate him hiking with me for ~10 days and he is due to come in some time this week. Of course this is the week of some of the worst cell service of the whole trip...
I found no service and am unsure of when/where he is coming. The trail is only 2193.1 miles long so how hard can it be for him to find me??
The food arrived shortly after me giving up hope and so began one of the hardest physical tasks I have done out here. Eating all this food.
I am not kidding. It was literally physically demanding. Like I would eat until my stomach could not contain any more food, then I would wait 15-20 minutes then eat more. The whole time FEELING hunger, while being physically full. It was the easily one of the strangest sensations I have ever had in my life. I ended up eating my large calzone(literally about 2.5 feet long and 1 foot wide, no joke), half my chicken parm Hero(4/10 by NY standards) a liter of Dr Pepper and my fries. I decided to pack out my other half of hero and my ¬†garlic bread¬†for lunch tomorrow, as I think I would have been sick if I ate anymore.
That was all about 3 hours ago now. The last two hours I have literally no energy to move or do anything because all my energy is being used to digest this food.
The worst part? The absolute worst part?
I‚Äôm hungry again.

Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638298,"Today was another relatively standard hiking day. The heat is continuing to increase but the hills are getting more mild, so it‚Äôs kind of a wash.¬†
We woke today with the idea of completing 24 miles to the next hostel, Bear Garden. It was a welcome idea as our clothes have been saturated in sweat and salt from hiking in the heat so many days in a row.
It‚Äôs funny, because I feel like we had taken a day off so recently, but in reality although we stayed at a hostel after the Damascus marathon(now bc but did not take a zero. It almost feels like we are platinum blazing(jumping from hostel to hostel, not sleeping in the woods). Its funny how guilty I feel so quickly for sleeping indoors for 2 nights in a week.¬†
The reality is we all needed a zero. We are sore, been pushing bigger and bigger days; and the heat is relentless at times. At this point my hammock is beginning to pay dividends. It may take longer to set up, I may not have a floor/space to work with protected from the elements, but it vents incredibly well. In the heat there is no better way of sleeping outdoors than in a hammock.
The actual hiking today was interesting, with a variety of experiences throughout. At the 10 mile mark of our day was a road we walked down, where a there was a Mexican ¬†restaurant and a gas station with snacks. We got lunch(a burrito deluxe) then I ate the second half of my chicken parm hero, then ice cream. Hiker hunger strikes again!
Following my massive lunch were some unforgiving climbs. Although in general Virginia has been flatter, the AT does very well at having you climb over and over again. The AT‚Äôs main source of difficulty compared to the other long trails in the US(Pacific Crest/Continental Divide) is the massive elevation gain and loss of the AT. ¬†The PCT averages a gain/loss of 309 feet/mile, the CDT 303 feet/mile and the AT is at a mind numbing 420 feet per mile.
A benefit of hiking with others is they share in your victories... and your misery. We would all be literally huffing and puffing to the top of the hill(me making strange noises due to frustration/exhaustion) then get to the top and yell.
I yelled some profanities.Deferred said it was ‚ÄúHecking hard climb‚ÄùThen Steve one upped my profanities.Finally Caveman was standing there barely out of breath.
It was a beautiful bonding moment for us all.
After some brutal climbs and escaping the woods, we entered a grassy meadow that was too beautiful for words. The wind blew waves of waist high grass to move effortlessly in unison, greeting us at every step. The heat was more noticeable when we were exposed in the meadow(no trees to protect us) yet we moved slower and stopped more in awe of the environment we found ourselves. I recognized in that moment a world of beauty, grace and appreciation for where I was more-so than I have in years.¬†
Also, I didn‚Äôt step in any cow poop. Which was a small miracle in my opinion.
We got the Hostel hiking the one of the latest days I‚Äôve hiked yet,¬†ending around 7:00pm. The hostel was... adequate. For 20$ a night we get a bunk and a shower. Well, more like Chinese water torture than a shower with the water pressure present, a mere trickle of hot water.
As Caveman aptly put it ‚ÄúThe shower has everything you want: soap, shampoo, heat, all thats missing is the water.‚Äù
When we arrived I became intimately familiar with all the foods of the freezer and fridge, and began eating an aggressive amount of very unhealthy foods. I feel myself beginning to lose weight and my body has messed up priorities.
I am very proud of my body. It is capable of amazing feats. Also, I have been blessed with a, shall we say, ample backside.
Baby got back, if you will.
Well. In my bodies infinite wisdom it has decided the first place to pull the fat from to fuel my steps is my butt. Which I mean, from a vanity standpoint is annoying at worst. From a ‚ÄúI have to sit on rocks and logs because cushions don‚Äôt exist out here‚Äù is infuriating at best. It used to be I could sit anywhere and it would be comfortable! Now when I sit on a picnic table I have to shift every 2 minutes so I don‚Äôt feel my femur pressing into the wood! I have a newfound empathy for my flat butted comrades, I never knew how good I had it.
Nonetheless. I found a BBQ sandwich in the freezer that costs 2.50$, has 560 calories, and is straight up delicious. I actually had to limit myself to 1 per hour. I have a problem. And it‚Äôs that the sandwiches aren‚Äôt free.
The next day was a well deserved zero. We spent, and I am currently spending, the day lounging around in the a/c eating crappy food and intermittently playing some card games/watching TV. It feels oddly good being a bum. I have a new appreciation for lazy days, air conditioning, and 4 walls. You would think 4 walls is only 33% better than 3 walls, but my God man that 4th wall is so important.
If you are confused by what I am saying above look up what a ‚Äúlean-to‚Äù shelter looks like.¬†
Another day in paradise. Now we just finalized some ambitious plans to cover 86 miles to Pearisburg¬†in 4 days. So, our comfortable living will be ending shortly.¬†
Until then,

Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638887,"We have been very lucky on this trip so far. What I have heard and read about the AT is to expect rain 1 out of every 4 days out here. So far, we are 30+ days in and have had rain 4-5 times total.
That luck did not help today.
We began early from the hostel, bellies full of Wendys from the night prior(thanks Deferred and The John!) and knowing that rain wasn‚Äôt just likely, but an inevitability. The forecast said 80% chance of rain and thunderstorms, and damn they really nailed that forecast.
We began the day hiking up a fairly unforgiving climb, ascending 2000ft in ~2 miles. It was grueling, but not terrible, especially since the weather was holding up. We got to a unique shelter(4 walls!) that was a fire warden cabin converted to shelter. The wind whipped outside, the rain started to pick up; and we sat warm and comfortable eating lunch.
Well, mainly comfortable. There was a sketchy man there who said nothing the whole time, wasn‚Äôt wearing hiking clothes, and I‚Äôm pretty sure he had a hand gun holstered in his belt. Bad vibes all around him.
We hiked on and the rain began to fall slow and steady. As we hiked the rain picked up, to the point where it was a torrential downpour. We were moving through puddles, water streaming down the trail, and I was just struck with the beauty of the woods we were in. How the forest seemed to breath new life with the rain and how refreshing the rain felt.
Then the thunder started.
We knew it was going to be lightning and thunder, and being soaking wet in the middle of the woods with 2 large metal poles is less than ideal. I was timing the difference between seeing a flash of lightning to hearing the thunder. For every 5 seconds between the lightning to thunder it is 1 mile away.
Luckily there wasn‚Äôt too much lightning, and the closest it got was ~1 mile away.
That night was the last night I had to spend with my ‚Äúpostage stamp‚Äù sized tarp as Josh was due to arrive tomorrow and bring my new tarp.

Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638888,"Todays plan centered around meeting up with Josh, who we had made plans for him to fly into Virginia and meeting us around Bland Virginia. It was only 10 miles for us to get there and once again the Virginia terrain was forgiving and mild.¬†
We covered the distance and got to the road where we planned to meet him by¬†11am. There were picnic tables there and a family giving out some trail magic of oranges, soda and chips. There son is apparently thru hiking and the family wanted to give back after all he had been getting. It was nice talking to some people from the Northeast(they were from Boston), made me feel more at home. Gotta love the Northeast honesty/attitude.
We grabbed a hitch off the side road, with intentions to go to Dairy Queen for lunch. I was sent out to get the hitch, as it seems sticking my thumb up was more effective for getting a ride than waving at passing cars(looking at you Steve/Deferred). We managed to get a ride from a pick-up truck who brought us right to the dairy queen.
When we got to Dairy Queen I proceeded to do the most Hiker Trash thing I have done yet. I was in the gas station bathroom, noticed a very powerful hand dryer. I looked down at my wet socks/shoes, and then at the hand dryer, as I no longer saw a simple hand dryer, it quickly began to look like a solution to my wet feet. I took one shoe off and started drying my socks (with them still on) and then held my shoe to it to dry it as well.
Well this must have been one of the busiest gas station bathrooms in all of Virginia because in the time it took for me to dry both my feet, I must have moved out of the way for 10 people for them to dry their hands. One guy looked at me and asked ‚ÄúStep in a puddle?‚Äù I replied ‚ÄúYeah, a few.‚Äù Understatement of the trail so far.
We ate outside (no inside dining, we needed to use the drive thru window) while waiting for Josh to arrive as the plan was to have his shuttle driver bring us all back to trail in 2 trips, since he could only fit 4 in his car at a time. He arrived with a way too heavy pack, hiking boots(not running shoes like I recommended), and a positive attitude. 1/3 isn‚Äôt too bad.
Me, Steve, and Josh took the 10 minute ride up to the trail from Bubba, Josh‚Äôs shuttle driver. He smoked the whole way, mainly communicated in grunts and side eyes, but Josh really seemed to like him. I found that interesting. After we got dropped off we were waiting for Bubba to return with Caveman, Deferred, and The John.
And we waited.And waited.And waited.
After about 45 minutes I received a text from Caveman asking if we got dropped off yet because Bubba has yet to return for them. This is when me and Josh began wondering if you are expected to tip shuttle drivers. (Apparently this point is up for debate, most thru hikers do not but some claim you must, who knows)
Well Bubba either did not like the fact Josh didn‚Äôt tip, suffered short term memory loss and forgot to pick up the rest of the crew, or got abducted by aliens. I personally believe it to be the latter.
The Tramily was eventually reunited by a woman I met at Bear Gardens hostel who is helping her daughter slack pack for 5-6 weeks on the trail. When I first found out about their arrangement(at Bear Gardens a week ago) I said to the mother ‚ÄúHow do I get a deal like that?‚Äù She replied ‚ÄúWell she is carrying some extra luggage‚Äù¬†I didn‚Äôt ask further questions because I wasn‚Äôt sure if she was referring to some kind of disability and based on her cryptic response I figured she didn‚Äôt want to go into details. I didn‚Äôt need the details because her daughter was noticeably pregnant when she arrived a few hours later.
Now I do not want to come across poorly here, and I likely should do more research on the subject before I speak on it, but I do not think you should be doing long distance hiking while pregnant. In order for me to MAINTAIN my weight I need to be eating absurd amounts of food constantly. A woman, literally building a person inside her body, will have such intense metabolic needs there is no realistic way for her to both feed herself and her baby to be.¬†Nonetheless, more power to her, and I wish her and her child the best of health.
I digress.
We hiked only a few miles to a shelter with a horribly far and weak water source; I helped Josh set up his hammock(New Hammock homie!!) and we called it a night.
P.S.My new tarp is epic. It‚Äôs 2x the size of my previous tarp and 1 ounce lighter. My femurs won‚Äôt break after all ü§ó","

Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638889,"We did 16 miles today. They weren‚Äôt the meanest miles but I had not realized how good of shape I am in at this point. Watching Josh, who is in reasonably good shape, working out and running before coming out, struggle up hills I barely notice was eye opening. Who would have thought hiking 600 miles would get you in good shape? Not I, not I.
I have been taking a notice to how good of shape I am at this point. When I wake up in the morning and check my watch my resting heart rate is around 40 beats per minute. In my mind, anything below 60 is I‚Äôm in running shape, below 50 I‚Äôm in the best shape of my life, 40‚Äôs is I didn‚Äôt know this was possible range. I think I‚Äôm going to run a marathon when I‚Äôm done with this just to knock that off my bucket list. I mean when am I ever going to be in this good of cardiovascular health again?!?
In short, Josh did well. He pushed himself very hard which I respected, he preferred a pace around 2.0mph, a bit of an adjustment for me and Steve who at this point hike a consistent 2.5mph.
However slow we had to go was more than made up for with the quality of conversations we were able to have. I asked questions about Josh‚Äôs Judaism(identity, theory, traditions), Josh asked Steve(Christian, specifically Methodist) about his religious upbringing and perspectives; and many more varied topics that filled the day with thought and insight. I was disappointed that Deferred didn‚Äôt join in on the conversations more, or even be present for them. I was interested to see what questions she would have for Josh. Her upbringing, schools and environments means she had only met/interacted with 2 Jewish people in her life. As a New Yorker who honestly loves the Jewish people that fact was mind-boggling to me.
We planned to stay at Dismal Falls, about 2 miles past Weary Feet hostel, but we got sucked into the vortex of the lovely hostel. It was only 5$ to tent, had a 12$ meal of spaghetti which Caveman seemed fixated on, and there were some stellar people there.
I couldn‚Äôt help myself to be a pseudo-PT for 2 women I met there: Potato Chip(English woman I diagnosed with Plantar Fasciitis-treatment: new shoes); Sparks (symptoms swelling of ankles diagnosis: anemia?).
We also met Vibes(very funny and likable guy from Alaska), Honey Boo Boo(paramedic from Texas who has a sharp as a tack wit), and Wall-E(beat him in chess 2 times, gets his trail name from cleaning up camp sites).
We played Duroc, ate too much spaghetti and went to bed. What more could you want?

Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638890,"We are officially¬†1/4th¬†of the way done with the AT. In some ways I never thought I‚Äôd go this far, and in a much more real way I always knew I would.
It‚Äôs nice hiking with the group and Josh(Captain Planet now, due to his upcoming internship with the EPA). He fits right in, was filled in on the inside jokes and immediately started cracking some of our own classics.
We were only doing another 16 miles to Woods Hole Hostel, a supposed hippie compound that is a must visit on the trail.
And oh boy it is a hippie compound.
The location is beautiful right away, a farm with garden in front, wooden buildings with character all around, and an amazing view of the valley below you can see while sitting on rocking chairs on the porch. Like something out of a movie.
We were shown around by Moses, another thru hiker who was doing ‚Äúwork for stay‚Äù where you complete some chores for the hostel and they let you stay for free. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be doing too much of that on this trip, as when I get to a hostel I want to do NOTHING. And to save ~20$ I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth me doing a few hours of chores. Now, if my chores was an hour or two of PT work.... maybe I would. I really miss my job. I‚Äôve said multiple times, if I could be on trail 5 days a week and work in my clinic back home (shout out to STARS East Meadow Neuro!) the other 2 days I‚Äôd be ecstatic.
Nonetheless. I took a warmish 5 minute shower(water shortage) then waited for dinner.
Before dinner the hostel owner had us all circle up and silently reflect on our day, then wanted us to go around and say our name and where we are from. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôsa universal thing, but I always hate these introductions. I get super nervous (which is weird because I love public speaking) and can‚Äôt focus on or remember anyone else‚Äôs name because I am repeating mine in my own head to prevent myself from forgetting.¬†
We were told we would be having a vegetable stir fry with tofu for dinner and a salad with all freshly grown/picked produce right from their organic garden. I had casually mentioned earlier that day I could really go for a big salad and damn e we came to the right place.
The food was terrific. I thought it may not be too filling due to lack of meat but it wasn‚Äôt even noticeable. The bread they had was home made (insanely good) the salad was fresh with homemade dressing that just made it even more refreshing, and the stir fry was filling and flavorful. Best meal we had on trail so far by a long shot in my opinion.
It costs a 14$ ‚Äúdonation‚Äù which I found strange because generally when I purchase goods or services for money it‚Äôs called a transaction, but when ringing me up he told me that‚Äôs the suggested donation. My suggestion, just charge me for the food. Don‚Äôt try to act like I should be acting charitable for an already expensive meal. It was 100% worth the money, hence why I paid it but his wording rubbed me the wrong way.¬†
After dinner we planned to have a fire and be social with the other tramily there, but between some workers at the hostel having come down with Norovirus(a nasty, highly contagious stomach bug) and a hiker getting it too, it told us its best to be anti social tonight. No problem for meü§™

Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638891,"We planned to leave Woods Hole Hostel, hike 11 miles to Pearisburg, resupply and Deferred would stay with The John as he was set to leave the next day. Me and Josh hiked behind the crew as his knee was majorly hurting and he could not move that fast. The crew trekked on ahead and I strategically distracted Josh with various conversations.
We spoke about beliefs in afterlife, his perspective and insight surprised me, I wasn‚Äôt aware he had so firmly believe in reincarnation. Ot shocked me because Judaism makes no mention of it, and he had no prior events or recollections in his life that lead to this belief. It seemed to be, just there. Kind of unique and interesting to me, because although my thoughts may seem scattered to an outside perspective, I almost always have a direct line of logic/reasons I believe a certain truth. His truth seemed to just exist inside of him.
We made it to Pearisburg, a Godawful town with a Hardee‚Äôs, DQ, Mexican Restaurant, a grocery store and 1.25 motels. Trash. Town.
Me and Josh went to Hardee‚Äôs instead of Mexican(where the Tramily ate) because he wanted a burger. And frankly, after all the pain and hardship I have already caused him to suffer, I wasn‚Äôt about to deny the man a burger.
We ate outside the DQ, as surprisingly enough a lot of places still have no indoor dining.¬†
It‚Äôs perplexing. Because the second I came to the South it was like Covid never existed. Nobody wears masks (expect workers, who often wear them around their chin, gotta keep on of their chins safe I guess) and people talk about how it was BS. It infuriates me right away and I speak up every time someone starts with that shit. I explain that as a New Yorker I saw how bad Covid was, and to downplay such a tragic loss of life (600,000 American lives lost) is calloused and wrong.
Yettttttt, even with Covid basically not existing in the eyes of the southerners, the chain restaurants are super strict about no eating indoors. It‚Äôs annoying at worst but I‚Äôll live.
After we ate I had a scare. I don‚Äôt mean to be graphic and I won‚Äôt be because I hate even writing it out; but Norovirus has 2 symptoms. One out your front end one out your back. Both unpleasant.
I had one of those while in the bathroom of the grocery store (Don‚Äôt worry I made it). My mind immediately went to ‚ÄúOh shit, I got Norovirus.‚Äù¬†
And I refuse to go into to woods and chance being sick for 3 days in the middle of the woods. No way Jos√®. I‚Äôd like running water at a minimum if I‚Äôm going to be going through that.
I told Josh and the tramily my concern and informed them my plan to stay at a motel tonight to see how it progresses.
Remember when I said this garbage town only had 1.25 motels and you thought ‚Äúhm, that‚Äôs a weird number, I hope he explains that.‚Äù Well here is your explanation:There are 2 motels in the town-
Is open but at full capacity, on a Tuesday. In the middle of bumblefuck Virginia. WHO IS STAYING AT THESE MOTELS?!?
Was due to open THAT DAY but the inspector who would give them the final pass didn‚Äôt show up.
Kill me. Just kill me.
Me and Josh ended up booking an expensive shuttle to a shitty Super8 in a town about 30 minutes away. Have you tried to call a hotel recently? Apparently a lot of chains (looking at you Holiday Inn) don‚Äôt even connect you to the front desk, instead you wait on hold for ~20 minutes before a technician who is clearly from India then fumbles around your simple requests for a room and tries to sell you a 120$ a night stay. No thank you.
We had a patient and super helpful shuttle driver Don who made sure we got a good place and made good conversations along the journey. I taught him about PT and pain science and he was super receptive and excited to hear what I had to say. Which was immensely helpful in taking my mind off my rumbling stomach for the long car ride.
We got to the motel and... well... it‚Äôs a Super8. Picture it in your mind. Yeah, basically that but maybe 30% blander and relatively clean. Good place to have Noro if any in my opinion.
Our room had 2 giant pictures of the same picture. I found that oddly annoying. Why spend the money on the same picture, 2 times, in the same room? Why not just get 2 different pictures in bulk and put one of each in each room? How much money could they possibly be saving?
Its not important but little things can drive me crazy.
That night Josh got to see Dr. Connolly as I acted as good PT to help his knee. I was able to get the pain down temporarily, but honestly time and more walking would be the best thing for it. Also doing an occasional squat or 2 may help, Josh.
I slept well that night despite the spot light in the parking lots best attempts to keep me awake and felt like it may have been a false alarm.
Hope that holds true until the morningü§û","Woods Hole Hostel

Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639418,"It held true. I was fine and don‚Äôt have Norovrirus, thank God.
Me and Josh returned to the trail¬†around 2pm¬†due to having trouble securing a shuttle for a while and the long drive back.
But before I talk about that I got one more thing I need to vent about Super8. Our check out time was¬†11am. By¬†9:30am¬†we had house keeping literally enter our room 2 times without knocking. By¬†10:30¬†that had gone up to 4 separate times. They did not knock. They just opened the door and said ‚Äúhousekeeping‚Äù
How bout you keep out of my room until I leave.
It felt good to be in air conditioning for a night. To be able to shower and not need to aggressively wipe my feet after for fear of athletes foot. Civilization felt good for a bit.
But now we were back in the woods. We did a short day our first day back, with little to note other than a funny difference between me and Josh. When I struggle in the woods, whether it‚Äôs up a hill or if the weather is particularly bad, I will create a mantra for myself, as I have mentioned in previous journals. Josh apparently sings to himself, this time from the play Hamilton. Which he performed an entire song from for me. Using falsetto for the women‚Äôs parts. It was so nerdy, impressive and funny at the same time.
He needed to sing quite a bit that day to climb those hills but he did them. He‚Äôs a trooper.
The next day was similar, these days hiking in Virginia is incredibly boring. There are little to no views, it seems like you just go up 100ft down 100ft and up again. Always surrounded by trees, but honestly often close enough to roads to hear cars. And the water sources are far and inbetween. Its like someone distilled all the worst aspects of hiking and put them together, then stretched that concoction over 700 miles in Virginia. I seriously look forward to getting out of here.
Josh even asked me at one point why I go so fast and not try to take in the surroundings and the most honest answer I could give was- not much interested me about this hiking. The woods look the same as usual, the towns lack any character or services, and Virginia seems to go on forever.

Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639420,"Today was one of the tougher days for me out here.
The terrain wasn‚Äôt even particularly challenging, nor the miles too far, nor the weather being bad.
It wasn‚Äôt a hard day physically, but a hard day mentally.
I slept poorly last night because of how how it was. It was low/mid 80s with humidity¬†at 1 am. If there is a hell I would hope it has better climate control than that.
I attempted to loosen my underquilt(basically a sleeping bag cut in half which sits under my hammock) and although it helped I was still drenched in sweat. Sweating in your sleep must dehydrate you because I ended up drinking a full liter before I woke up. My last full liter. My last bit of water.
I awoke to a beautiful sunrise, an orange sun smiling at me, letting me know today was going to be a shit day. I packed up my things, and decided to check GutHook to see how far until the next water source.
5.2 miles
Fuck.
¬†Well, its less bad than the Damascus marathon. Maybe.
I hiked for a 2 miles and hit Dragon‚Äôs tooth, one of 3 major sites I was going to hit today. It is an absurd structure, defying gravity, logic and immensely intimidating.
So I climbed it.
I decided to go for a more difficult route than what Ez(thru hiker I met 2 days prior) pointed out to me:
I explained, ‚ÄúI like rock climbing and a challenge‚Äù
Which it most certainly was. It was a mental challenge more than anything else at first, deciding where to place my feet, how to hold my hands was a puzzle I have solved many times prior. Most of those times I was harnessed in or over a 2ft thick crash pad, so the stakes were different but the challenge remained the same.
Half way up it stopped being a challenge to find where to place my hands and feet; quickly becoming a challenge on if I should. The top of the ‚Äútooth‚Äù narrows to about a 3ft wide steep climb to the point. On either side there is about a 100ft drop off of sheer cliff. If I misstepped once, trusted a hold I shouldn‚Äôt, or miscalculated any movement; I‚Äôd be leaving in a bag rather than holding on.
My heart raced as I slowly climbed on all fours to the top, silently cursing my own sense of adventure and pondering why I must always make things difficult for myself.
Finally I got to the top, where there was just enough room to sit cross legged, a welcome source of ¬†stability atop a precarious and now windyüòì rock formation. I very carefully took out my phone and took some video to commemorate my feat (and my fear).
Descending was probably worse than ascending, as I now could not see where I was placing my feet and where the holds were. I would take 2 steps, then turn my head and find the next 2 steps, and repeat. At one particularly dangerous spot my leg started cramping and I literally thought ‚ÄúYou are NOT allowed to cramp right now.‚Äù And the cramp immediately went away. Adrenaline is one hell of a drug.
I hiked down from Dragons tooth on some of the toughest terrain yet on the trail. Rocks were plentiful, 3ft or greater drops were everywhere, and there was little room for error. This is unironically my favorite form of hiking.
I met up with Ez on the way down, who impressed me with his pace. He had been doing 24 mile+ days everyday since Damascus. And I was proud of myself for my 25 mile day yesterdayüò©
(I am still proud of myself, comparing yourself or your accomplishments to others is often a fruitless and detrimental exercise)
He is about to begin a teaching job in Minnesota, in the inner city. Apparently Minnesota has pretty significant racial disparities between white/Asian and Black graduation rates, and he was nervous about if he will be able to affect any change. I told him that even if he just impacts 1 kid he will have done his job.
We hiked for a short while before he went ahead during one of the many rests I was taking(it was already hot by¬†10am).
Next stop was McAfee knob, the most photographed and arguably most famous point on the Appalachian trail.
For good reason. It‚Äôs breathtaking. The cliff juts out into the sky, stabbing the clouds and horizon below at a seemingly impossible angle. The overhang I was told was an optical illusion, I don‚Äôt know what that guy was smoking because it is a sheer DROP at the edge of the cliff.¬†
I asked an instagram model lookin‚Äô dude to take my picture, cause I figured if anyone knew how to take a good picture it‚Äôd be the guy that looks like he is on his way to a photoshoot.
I was right. I look stellar despite my iPhone 5 SE‚Äôs lack of megapixels and whosiwhatsits.
There was one last aspect of the triple crown, tinker cliffs. It was around the 20 mile mark of my day and close to the end of my day overall. I reluctantly did the final climb to Tinker, having to stop multiple times due to physical and mental exhaustion. At one point I stopped to listen to a bird which made sounds I never heard in nature before, it sounded like a text message ring tone.
Tinker Cliffs were nice and had the benefit of no day hikers. To sit atop the view and soak it in alone was welcome, and gave me time to reflect. I made a video on my reflections in the moment and I made a joke to myself that made me laugh for a few minutes straight.
I think that‚Äôs whats missing. Humor. Lightheartedness.¬†
I look forward to catching up to the Tramily tomorrow. Only 10 miles to Daleville and I will be able to rest/shower/do laundry at the Super8 where they are staying.

Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639421,"When I arrived at Daleville I was delighted to hear that the Tramily was still there and they had a room at the Super8 in town.
It was perfect. I‚Äôd be able to do just a Nero(10 miles), take a shower, do laundry, and chill.
SO I THOUGHT.
I arrived¬†around 10:30am¬†and found out their plans. They had resupplied and they now planned to do a Nero of 11 miles to a shelter.¬†
That‚Äôs not a Nero for me‚Ä¶
I did manage to have time to shower and do laundry thanks to an extension on check out time and felt fresh. Tired. But fresh.
At least my Tramily seemed happy to see me. They told me how they missed me and I told them about how I‚Äôve missed them. It‚Äôs crazy how close you get with people out here and how quickly bonds are formed.
We ate lunch at a nearby BBQ place and I had a burger that was about 8 inches tall. Following lunch we went to an outfitter who was nice enough to give me a free tip to my trekking pole (lost mine 3 days ago), sold me a new filter, and good vibes overall. I‚Äôm such a sucker for good customer service. The second someone is kind, patient and knowledgeable, the money just files out of my wallet. I like supporting good people I guess.
The Tramily left ahead of me (still needed to resupply) so I hiked alone all day. Let me tell you, the hiking was unforgiving, I was NOT mentally prepared for another 20 mile day, and I was pissed.
Angry at myself, angry at the Tramily for making me hike more, and angry at the trail for being so unnecessarily steep. I yelled some choice words into the woods to work through my feelings and I felt slightly better.
To add insult to injury, that night when I got to the picnic table, Deferred and Caveman were talking about averaging 20 miles a day moving forward and not taking any more zeros.
I immediately became insecure and unsure of my ability to keep up with that, and not even sure if I wanted my thru hike to look like that. I have had the philosophy of going slow, enjoying the experience and saying yes to life and the experiences of the trail. So it felt like an ultimatum, change my goals of my hiking or hike alone.
So, my rough mental days continued.
Damn.","
",View Entry,"Jun 07, Mon",21
Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639422,"What a change in pace. What an absolutely necessary day.
We hiked 17 miles to a campground that was recommended to me by a southbound hiker named Shooter. He said they had a pool, homemade milkshakes, and delicious burgers.
You had me at pool.
The hike was easy enough. It‚Äôs funny when we are hiking to a hostel/town the miles feel shorter. We hiked as a Tramily unit the whole time (a rarity for us) and had a variety of good conversations, as expected at this point.¬†
We got to a parking lot 3 miles from the campground and managed to snag a ride with Fidget, who called in the shuttle a few minutes earlier. The tailgate on the pickup we were in the back of was questionable at best, but why would I worry when I‚Äôm sitting the closest to it and they are driving at 70 miles an hour on back country roads.
Right? It‚Äôd be silly to worry?
We got to the campground in one piece despite their best efforts, and I was actually blown away by how nice it was.¬†
We immediately got the burgers and the milkshakes and let me tell you. These milkshakes would absolutely bring the boys to the yard. Especially if the boys loved aggressively average milkshakes.
Nonetheless, we then made our way to the pool. Jumping into the pool was easily one of the best feelings I‚Äôve had on trail so far. To be weightless, submerged in cool water, and the feeling of summer I hadn‚Äôt even realized I was missing yet; a feeling of bliss. We were playing around in the pool but couldn‚Äôt help but notice the pond next to us. It had huge inflatable structures like a floating trampoline, monkey bars, a seesaw?, and a slide.
We played on all the different parts, me attempting to be as annoying as I could be. Which I have a lot of practice at being a younger brother. I‚Äôve kind of perfected the art of annoying people.
I pushed Deferred down a slide with no water on it (sorry), got flung off the seesaw by Teflon, and tried to convince Deferred to push Caveman off the top of the monkey bars.
It‚Äôs a funny thing but I‚Äôve found it to be almost universally true: When a group of humans see something with a clear intended use, they will attempt to use it in other ways. For instance, the monkey bars were clearly meant to be an obstacle you go across. So, we, a group of humans, decided instead of going across we would get on top of it.
Way more fun that way.
Now this is the part of the story where I tell you how fun it was, what a needed mental break it was to be away from the trail, and end on some sappy quote about how special sharing this experience with these wonderful people has been.
It would have been that way, if I hadn‚Äôt seen Deferred‚Äôs feet.
Oh my God. I never seen such: calloused, blistered, paradoxically dried out yet moisture locked-feet in my life.
I noticed around the time we got there and pointed it out to the group, quite dramatically and alarmed. And nobody really seemed phased. Which boggled my mind at the time because it looked like a picture from my Wound Care class in PT school.
She had callouses probably 3/4 inch thick on her heel, that encompassed her entire heel. Then, UNDER THAT CALLOUS was a blister forming which apparently ‚Äústarted bothering her‚Äù. GIRL I‚ÄôD BE GOING TO THE HOSPITAL IF I HAD YOUR FEET.
Well, maybe I‚Äôm being a little dramatic, but it was pretty horrific.
There was a caller who Teflon had been talking to for a while who was hanging out with us as we discussed what to do with her feet. He mentioned his girlfriend may have a pumice stone she could use, which I basically begged him to get.
She started working on it and I didn‚Äôt even try to hide my fascination. I was mind blown how bad it was and just needed to help. She eventually let me jump in to do some treatment(her arm was actually getting tired from so much work) and I managed to shave off a bit of some of the softer callouses. We then hit her feet with 3 different lotions/powders I had learned about from the book ‚ÄúTreating your Feet‚Äù.
Next time we are using sand paper and a belt sander.
I‚Äôm only partially kidding.","
",Middle Creek Campground,"Jun 08, Tue",17
Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640245,"Today we answered the age old question ‚ÄúIf your friends jumped off a bridge would you?‚Äù
Well it turns out, to the surprise of almost nobody, I am the kind of person that jumps off a bridge with no prompting.
Deferred apparently will jump off a bridge if her friends do.
To give a little context there is another challenge on the AT: jumping off the James River Foot bridge. Before you are even within 5 miles of the bridge there are multiple signs warning how it is illegal to jump off the bridge and you will get fined if you get caught.
If.
So when we got there, already soaked because it had rained that morning, I was determined to jump off. I got to the first pillar where all the locals supposedly jump off and stripped down to my undies. As we stood there preparing a couple from the area going for a walk saw us and excitedly asked if we planned to jump off. I informed them I did and they said they never seen someone do it before. I climbed through the guard rail, got to the edge of the pillar, looked at the 30ft drop and began to rethink my life decisions.¬†
Why must I always say yes to dumb and dangerous things? ¬†
Oh wait, now I remember, it‚Äôs because they are fun.
¬†Now or never I guess.
I jumped and after hitting the water, realizing I had not died, I began to encourage Deferred to jump. She needed little convincing and was soon in the same position I was in. She jumped in and we had to swim about 100 yards to pull ourselves out.
Then Caveman arrived and we told him we jumped in. He asked if I could do it again so he could include it in his next video, promising me Internet fame and glory.
Well, go watch his video and tell me if I did it again.
Later we went to a shelter in the middle of the town of Glasgow and I built one of my proudest fires yet. There were a lot of bugs around and I got some firewood, only enough to build a fire for a few hours. Seeing that it was only¬†2pm¬†when it was started I knew I needed to make it last somehow. So I found a very thick log (like 3ft thick) and built a very hot fire around it with the intention to cook the log to the point it catches.
Well it worked better than expected because the log never ‚Äúcaught‚Äù per se but it smoked all day into the night and kept the bugs away. In the morning there was no traces left of the log. I was pretty proud of that.
I mastered two elements today, water and fire.","

Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639423,"I knew waiting to Waynesboro was the right move. I knew taking a zero before it would be our classic mistake of taking a zero at a lame spot then immediately ending up in an awesome spot that we feel obligated to blow past due to our recent stoppage.
I‚Äôm so glad we waited.
We got to Waynesboro via 2 separate hitches(it‚Äôs becoming crazy how comfortable I have become with hitchhiking) to the Quality Inn where we would be spending 2 nights.
The second I saw the pool was open I knew we made the right call.
It‚Äôs funny, and I don‚Äôt have much evidence to support this theory but I feel like some businesses are using Covid as an excuse to cut costs. Many motels we have stayed at have a pool but they say it‚Äôs closed due to concerns of Covid. And they used to have breakfast included but now it‚Äôs just a muffin in a paper bag. All this to protect us from Covid- YET, the front desk people don‚Äôt wear masks (in fact, barely anyone does anymore), and there is no social distancing or disinfecting surfaces to be seen. So, I think they are full of it.
But this place. This Quality Inn. Pool open. Breakfast included (with a Belgian waffle maker). Clean place. Not too many prostitutes.¬†
Overall¬†8/10.
We got New York style pizza(decent imitation for the south it was a Southern 7.5/10 but it‚Äôd be a NY 4/10) and ate at a park nearby. I downed an entire 16 inch pizza and half a chicken parmigiana sub and felt content.
We got a bottle of Pina Colada and other than me getting a new phone tomorrow it going to be a chill day.
Next stop, Waynesboro Verizon store.","

Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639424,"When my phone broke I resigned myself to the fact I‚Äôd likely need to drop around 1000$ on a new IPhone I didn‚Äôt even want. For those of you unaware, I have been using an IPhone 5SE since they came out ~5 years ago. I don‚Äôt like phones very much, I try to minimize the usage of mine, and don‚Äôt like just getting things because Poppa Capitalism is telling me I need the newest phone with the camera that‚Äôs 4% better than the last 3.
So, my phone‚Äôs death was less of a surprise to me, more of an inevitability.
The morning started with the plan to take a free local bus which travelled around town and would take us the 3 miles to Walmart/Verizon store in Waynesboro. We got there¬†around 11:30am¬†and I went to the Verizon store with Caveman while Teflon and Deferred were resupplying at the Walmart.
We went into the store and was greeted by a friendly woman who seemed happy to help with my dilemma. I asked about the new IPhone SE, as my last worked so well and I knew that those were generally cheaper with good internal specs. Unfortunately, they only had the 64 GB models available, which was a deal breaker for me. I run my phone into the ground and I want this next phone to last at least a few years so for 50$ extra I‚Äôd want the 128GB model.
She told me she had some Iphone 12s with 128GB but that would be around 900$.
So the choices were the following:400$ IPhone SE 64 GB- immediately get phone and have storage issues in future450$ IPhone SE 128 GB- order phone to Front Royal and pick up my new phone¬†in 5 days900$ IPhone¬†12 128¬†GB- immediately get an unnecessarily robust phone for my needs
I slowly resigned myself to buying the iPhone 12, rationalizing that it will be more future proof, I can take better pictures and I‚Äôll have 5g capabilities. As I went to pay the now over 1000$(with case and taxes) the saleswoman casually mentioned the 35$ upgrade fee.
WHY IS THERE A FEE FOR GIVING YOU MY MONEY?!?
Caveman talked me off the ledge, telling me to check out other options like Walmart and see what they offer.
I backed out of the sale and met back up with the group. We grabbed some Wendy‚Äôs and as we did Caveman called the Walmart we were just next to seeing what phone they had in stock. No luck on iPhone SE 128GB, only 64GB. Damn.
We head back over with the intention for Caveman to resupply, I would talk to them about phones then we would catch the¬†1:30pm¬†bus back to the motel.
I got to the Walmart phones counter and was greeted by Courtney, an energetic and sharp saleswoman who seemed happy to help me. When I asked her what I was looking for she told me unfortunately that they did not have the iPhone SE 128gb only the 64GB. I was disappointed and sat talking to her for a few minutes. She was complaining that her job wasn‚Äôt valuing her properly and that she wasn‚Äôt having a good day. I tried to be encouraging, but it was tough because I was having a bad day too.
Then she perked up. She had been looking up if any nearby stores had what I was looking for, and excitedly informed me there was a Walmart only 15 minutes away that had it!
I said ‚Äú15 minutes by car?‚Äù (She already knew I was a hiker at this point, my smell probably gave me away)
She replied ‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôll take you there, I need to get out of this store either way.‚Äù
ü§Øü§óü§©
Wait.
Really?
She grabbed her stuff and gave me vague/weird instructions to meet her basically where the employees hang out. I walked back there (nobody stopped me?) and was waiting for her, thinking how this has to be too good to be true and there was no way this was going to happen. I was stressing a bit because it was already past¬†1:30¬†and I had no way to inform my Tramily my new plan(no phone FTW), I could only hope they would trust me to handle myself and get back on my own.
Courtney eventually appeared and we made our way out of Walmart to her car. We drove around the lot for a minute to ensure my Tramily wasn‚Äôt wandering around looking for me then began our journey to the Walmart in Stanton.
As we drove I quickly came to the conclusion I was in good company. She was friendly, immediately dove into good conversations, and was a breath of fresh air. A lot of people I interacted with in the south this far have felt fake friendly. Like the kind of interaction where when you talk to them it‚Äôs all ‚Äúoh honey‚Äù and ‚ÄúGod Bless you‚Äù then you walk away and they talk shit about you. I don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs just a vibe I get at times. The fakeness kills me.
There was no fakeness in Courtney. She was honest and surprisingly open, and not afraid to disagree with me.(Courtney if you are reading this Friends is not the best show) I told her multiple times she would fit right in New York with her hustler attitude, aggressive driving and no nonsense demeanor. Hell I felt like she was more of a New Yorker than I am.
We got to the Walmart and Courtney showed me why she has so much freedom at her job. It‚Äôs because she‚Äôs crazy good at it. She informed me the phone was going to be 199$.
What. How. At Verizon it would be more than double that price.¬†
WHAT WITCHCRAFT IS THIS?
I don‚Äôt care if she gave me a contract from the Devil himself I would have signed it. I was so invested in this situation and trusted her so much that I barely read what she put in front of me.
And I‚Äôll admit, I got a bit flirty with her. She is very cute with brown hair, a great personality and informed me she started working out again and it was legs day yesterday. Let‚Äôs just say it‚Äôs working üí™üçë
I offered to buy her lunch (she kept mentioning how hungry she was) and she finally took me up on it after 3 offers. Girl you just saved me at least 200 dollars I can buy you a lunch.
We spoke on the way to lunch and the rule remains true off the trail. There is an ongoing joke/rule on trail that every girl you meet will have 1 of the 3 following problems.¬†
¬†They smokeThey hike too slow/going in wrong directionThey are in a relationship¬†
Well, Courtney has #3 going for her. But hey, I made a great friend, good contact for buying phones (she‚Äôll hook you up on a crazy cheap phone I can give you her number if you ask) and most importantly I met a good person who helped me more than she realized.
From the bottom of my heart, thank you Courtney. You allowed me to write this journal, you took the weight of not having a means of communication off my shoulders and most importantly,
You saved me money.ü§ë

Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640246,"A day by day replay is not sustainable as a trail journal. Some days are far too similar too even write anything meaningful or interesting in them. So I have decided to change from a day by day, play by play to writing about significant events in a mostly chronological order.
The first event that comes to mind was the next challenge I completed on the trail. On June 21st there is a challenge: Hike Naked Day. I knew about this day/challenge from day 1 on the trail and had 0 doubts I would be completing it. It‚Äôs just too good of a story to pass up.
The unfortunate(or maybe fortunate?) thing was hike naked day was falling on our Zero with Teflons mom who rented us a cabin. I felt bad thinking we would need a separate trip to the trail (the cabin was about 30 minutes from Sehendoah National park) but found out we planned to go to the park for Teflon and his mom to take a picture at the campground their great grandmother worked at.
Perfect.
I did my best to convince Teflon and Deferred, and was surprised the amount of resistance I got from Teflon and the amount of agreement I got from Deferred. Early in the trail (pre-tramily even) me and Teflon had discussed hike naked day and we agreed that I would hike naked expect wear shoes and socks, and he would hike naked expect a loin cloth. When I brought it up he was adamant he never agreed to that and said there was no chance he would join me even for the short section I was planning. üò©
Deferred, to my utter surprise, was more willing to compromise. She wanted to take part but in her own way. She wanted to take a picture not facing the camera naked from the waist up. Which for her is basically the equivalent of me running through the mall parking lot naked as the day I was born. (which I may or may not have done‚Ä¶)
In other words, it was super risqu√© for her and I had nothing but respect.
So with the plan set: I would hike in front of her with enough lead time she wouldn‚Äôt be exposed to the work of art that is Ken; she would find an overlook and take her picture while I warn people to slow down if hiking south (to avoid running into Deferred heinous act) then they would drive down the road and meet me 1.3 miles down the trail. I‚Äôm a risk taker, but I always have a plan.
The ride there I was really nervous. I wanted to do it, but of course I did not want to run into any children, or massively offend anyone, or run into a park ranger and end up on a list. So when we pulled into the lot and I saw 10+ cars parked, and families walking about; I began to have doubts. Caveman reassured me there are plenty of times he has been to state parks where there are a ton of cars parked with nobody in the woods.
I think he just wanted me to do as content for his next videoü§î
Nonetheless, I walked into the woods with my pack, no shirt, and shorts still on. Once I felt sufficiently deep in the woods, I warned Caveman who was behind me that it was happening. I took off the last shred of clothing I had, and my heart rate just about doubled.
I began my walk and immediately was thrown through a loop, as I hadn‚Äôt realized there was a second parking lot about 100 yards down the trail. I scampered through and luckily did so seemingly undetected.
I continued down trail and realized there were people hiking north in front of me at a relatively slow pace. I went out to some overlooks, getting sunshine where it rarely goes, and also grabbed a timed shot of me looking at the overlook from behind (good idea Deferred). When I got back onto trail I hit my first obstacle,
a south bound hiker.
Now the northbound hikers were easy to avoid, walk slowly, walk quietly, they would never need to know. But a south bound hiker‚Ä¶ there was no easy way around that one.
So I half yelled down the trail‚ÄúExcuse me, excuse me!‚Äù
The man looked around confused, as he has not seen me yet
I yelled ‚ÄúSorry to bother you, I‚Äôm in front of you down trail, but I have to warn you, I am celebrating hike naked day!‚Äù
The man is now looking in my general direction, and with my strategic hand placement I think I saved some of my last shreds of dignity.
And he started cracking up. He replies ‚ÄúYou guys are crazy, have a good day‚Äù and walks past me, barely even looking up from the ground. It‚Äôs for the best, I fear I would have blinded him with my beauty. Or my incredibly pale skin. One of the two.
After the encounter I gained some confidence. I began really trying to take in the experience, and absorb how ridiculous but also freeing being naked in the middle of the woods truly is. I came up on the northbound hikers again and recognized them as hikers I have met many miles ago, an older pair of siblings Rage and Waze. With my newfound boldness I decided why slow down?¬†
So I approached them similar to the southbounder. I warned them of my presence, imploring them to not turn around and explained my situation. I asked them if it would be okay to pass them, which they agreed to between chuckles. I strode past Rage(an older woman) and she said ‚ÄúYou go boy!‚Äù
And I did.
It was stupid. Silly. Dangerous. Freeing. Funny.
But you know what, hiking the trail is stupid, silly, dangerous, freeing and funny. So why not be naked?
My advice to you, is stop asking ‚ÄòWhy?‚Äô, ask ‚ÄòWhy not?‚Äô
It‚Äôs a lot more fun.","

Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640247,"There four state challenge is absolutely the right name for it. It is a challenge, in the truest sense of the word. I have never been so exhausted; physically and mentally broken; and never once did I doubt my ability to complete it.
Some background: the Four State Challenge is arguably the most famous physical AT Challenge there is. It‚Äôs simple in concept, begin in Virginia, cross into West Virginia, then Maryland, end in Pennsylvania. Total mileage: 43.9 miles(I round up to 44, sue me)
The rules are as simple as the challenge, you have 24 hours to complete it once you start hiking, with most people completing it in 16-20 hours.¬†
So, we set up the night before directly on the border, with a solid plan in place. We went to sleep early, as we planned to¬†start at 5am¬†sharp to beat the heat and avoid hiking with headlamps on by the end. We figured if we averaged ~3mph we would complete it sometime close to¬†8pm, even with rests.
The morning of I woke up¬†at 1am¬†with a burst of energy, and couldn‚Äôt help but feel if I was alone I would have started right then. Alas, my Tramily would be concerned and I wanted to actually hike it with them, unlike how I did the Damascus marathon where it was every man for himself. I looked at this challenge as a team effort, more than an individual competition.¬†
I finally fell back asleep¬†at 3 am¬†only to be awoken by my¬†4:15am¬†alarm.
Damn.
I packed up my hammock (only takes 15 minutes now) then ate a pop tart for breakfast. If you want to play like a pro you gotta eat like a pro. I mean look at Micheal Phelps, that guy ate the most ridiculous foods ever and he‚Äôs got more gold than Fort Knox.
We gathered at the border, flipped off the Virginia sign, then started our trek. Let me tell you, even writing about it 3 days later I still get nervous thinking about how big an undertaking it truly was.
We hiked with headlamps down into Harpers Ferry, finishing our first two states before¬†8am(West Virginia is only like 3 miles long). We got into Harpers Ferry which is an incredibly cute picturesque town and made our way to the AT headquarters. Since Caveman thought the challenge was stupid(which it is) he would not be partaking in it, so he kindly offered to watch a majority of our stuff so we could slack pack the rest. I dumped everything expect some candy, lunch foods, 2 water bottles and my filter.¬†
With an empty pack 44 miles will be a breeze right? Right?!?
We got back on trail, me and Teflon taking turns leading the group. We spoke strategy and decided to stay close to one another for motivation and to check eachothers speeds, to avoid going too fast and burning out. The trail was incredibly forgiving for many of the miles, at one point paralleling a river on a flat bike path for a few miles. It seriously got to the point that the flat terrain was boring me and I wanted variety.
We got some variety a quarter way into Maryland, with some mild hills and little rocker path. Once again, not so bad. We were on pace on complete ~20 miles before lunch, which is exactly the timetable we laid out.
Our time saving techniques were well thought out in my opinion. We only refilled water at potable water sources to save time on filtering, and we allowed ourselves 10 minute breaks every 10 miles. (which turned into 15-20 minute breaks but we needed it)
We got trail magic at one point, a cooler filled with sodas and some candy, and I downed a Powerade & some twix. A welcome boost to morale.
Finally we made it to lunch at 12, which we took at the original Washington monument. Bet you didn‚Äôt know that was a thing! Look it up, it‚Äôs pretty cool.
Unfortunately when we were there it was not very cool. It was HOT. And there was very limited shade. I like to think the heat motivated us to finish much faster, but that may be a defense mechanism because I had suggested that spot for lunch (sorry guys)
We got back on trail after a 30 minute lunch, and had some of the most fun I‚Äôve had on trail yet. Me and Deferred would pick a song we both had downloaded then play it at the same time and sing along to it. When she suggested Childish Gambino I was impressed and we rocked out to that, Beastie Boys, even Iggy Azalea. Teflon even joined the fun when we sang the song from Hamilton, You‚Äôll be Back, which he did from memory without hearing the music. Impressive.
The next 15 miles were a blur. This is a section I had actually hiked previously with Josh and Kevin on a section hike years ago, which is partially why I didn‚Äôt mind blowing right through it.
All was going well.
Until.
The end of Maryland.
I think the trail maintainers of Maryland must be upset thru hikers fly through Maryland in a day. They must have a vendetta against thru hikers. Because with 5 miles left to go, 39 miles on my legs, feet screaming in soreness and protest to my actions; Maryland decides its a great time to do a 600 foot descend on some of the most aggressive rocky terrain I have EVER seen. Like you can‚Äôt see the ground, every boulder the size of a mini cooper type terrain.
It sucked. It broke every last piece of me and I nearly lost my mind. I woods episodically scream into the woods in pain, cursing the existence of the path and myself for doing such a ridiculous challenge. Take me back to when I was naked, at least that was fun!
Of the rocks ended it was only 3 miles to the finish line, where my parents would be meeting me. We planned to take a zero the day after and hang with them, as I always said the first place I‚Äôd like to see them on trail would be Harpers Ferry. I half ran half hobbled the last 3 miles and got to the Mason Dixon line. Me, Teflon and Deferred locked arms and crossed the line.
I had finally escaped the South.
We ate the chicken parm heroes my parents got for us, downed the gatorades and reminisced about how horribly difficult the day truly was.
I‚Äôm glad I did it, but I am in no rush to do more than 30 miles in a day ever again. There are other distance challenges I have heard about on the AT and I have 0 interest in doing them.
I‚Äôm on here for the experience and the stories, not to fly to Maine.
If I wanted to fly to Maine I would have bought a ticket.","Virginia

Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640252,"After completing the 4 state challenge I was greeted by my parents, who were waiting for me at the Mason Dixon(Dixie) line. What a wonderful way to re-enter the north. We(Teflon, Deferred, and I) told them all about the woes of our day, our triumphs and tribulations.
My mom said I don‚Äôt smell that bad, which I almost took offensively. I mean, I‚Äôve been living in the woods for 2 months I kind of want to be a stinky wild man.
We(Mom, Dad, Teflon and I) drove down to the motel they booked us to stay and recuperate, with plans to zero the next day. On our way into the motel we noticed a Wendys across the street, so we got second dinner (chicken parm heroes was first).¬†
The next day had to be the most relaxing zero day we had yet. When I woke up(after sleeping close to 11 hours) I was surprised how not sore I was. My feet hurt about the same they always do, and my muscles felt mostly fine. We had plans to meet the Tramily at the ATC, get our pictures taken then get lunch in Harpers Ferry. I finally got to meet Caveman‚Äôs wife who is a lovely person (and a Saint for putting up with Caveman, according to Deferredü§£).
The day was so relaxing. We didn‚Äôt even need to resupply as my mom, as her usual fashion, went way overboard on bringing food/supplies for me, so me and Teflon just split them. It was so nice to have a day of laying around, hanging with the parents (who I missed dearly) and contemplating the fun things to come.

Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640250,"We followed up the Four State Challenge with one that sounded way more fun, the half gallon Challenge, where you need to eat a half gallon of ice cream to celebrate passing the halfway point of the trail.
Sounds easy enough. I mean with my hiker hunger a half gallon of ice cream probably won‚Äôt even fill me.
Wait. They also time it?
Ok this is going to be rough.
We only had a 10 mile hike into the Pine Grove Store where we would get our ice cream, eat lunch, then hike another 7 miles to the next shelter. On our way there we passed the halfway point of the Appalachian Trail, which currently measures 2193.1 miles, so it was at the 1090.5 mile mark. Hiking while doing math is seems to be tough.¬†
It‚Äôs crazy to think how far I‚Äôve gone, and how far I have left to go. I knew coming into the trail I would complete it, but the fact I am actually at the 50% mark is mind boggling. Its such a far fetched idea, hike over 2000 miles in the woods carrying what you need to survive.
And I mention I knew I would complete it because that has been a philosophy I adopted a few years ago. I learned it from wrestling/boxing, if I wanted to succeed in the match, I must KNOW I would win, not think I would win. If you ‚Äúthink‚Äù you will win it leaves room for doubt, or failure. When I decide to do something, whether its get into PT school, get a job I want, or hike the AT; I simply decide I will do it then figure out the steps necessary to make my vision come true. I carry the philosophy at work too, if my patient says they will ‚Äútry‚Äù a new activity(i.e. standing for first time in months) I will correct them and tell them they will succeed instead.
Sidetrack-Standing is a relatively challenging activity. You‚Äôd be surprised to learn how many of your muscles need to work in perfect harmony to maintain balance, avoid buckling of the knees and sensation required to correct any slight shifts. It also requires bravery, especially if you haven‚Äôt stood in months.
Well, back in my old life working as a neurological physical therapist I had a patient who had not stood in 5 months. She suffered from multiple sclerosis, a neurodegenerative disorder which affects your muscles(strength, volition movement, and range of motion) as well as your coordination and 10 million other challenges. It‚Äôs debilitating, difficult, and I am honored to be able to help people with it.¬†
When I reviewed her chart I was surprised to see although she had been coming to PT for 5 treatments now she had no standing exercises. When I met her I told her my plans to get her standing-
‚ÄúOh no. I can‚Äôt do that. I haven‚Äôt stood in months.‚Äù
Cool story is basically what I replied.
I set her on some basic leg exercises, checked her strength and came to the conclusion she could stand with assistance. So, I set her in her wheelchair in the mini bars (a small platform of parallel bars) with knee support on the padded surface in front of her(to prevent buckling), and got a gait belt around her back, with intentions to pull her forward into standing.
She was nearly panicking at this point. I knew the situation was overwhelming for her, but the reality was this was a very controlled low risk environment. If she fell backwards, it would be into her wheelchair; if she fell forward it would have been into me and the platform supporting her knees; and she had arm support on either side preventing falling to side.¬†
All that did not give her the confidence to stand. The first try I put almost my full effort into pulling her up and she got barely off the seat. I realized it was her mindset, her beliefs that held her back. I crouched to eye level with her, made eye contact and said-
‚ÄúI understand you have doubts in yourself. In your ability to stand. I want you to get rid of those. I want you to not try next time, I want you to succeed.‚Äù
She nodded in agreement and we counted down- 3, 2, 1.
I started hosting as hard as I could and once she was about 2 inches off the seat I immediately reduced the amount of help I was giving. She was doing it on her own. She didn‚Äôt need my help. She stood up, proud as could be, and started crying, asking me to go get her husband to show him. I made her stand one more time before bringing the husband back (just in case that stand was a fluke and not repeatable) then brought him back.
His first question: Can we do this at home?
No. No you cannot. I went to school for 7 years to learn to do this safely. Eventually? Yes you can and should, right now, no.
She succeeded because she set her mind to success, then did what needed to be done.
And that is how I am approaching the trail.
And how I approached over 2000 calories of iced dairy.
It was a near perfect day for it, the temperature outside was oppressive, feeling over 100 degrees with humidity. We got to the store and I saw Wanderer with his selections, Orange Sherbert for the 1.5 quarts and chocolate for the pint. I immediately thought that was a good idea, as I am mildly lactose intolerant and figured sherbet has less lactose(upon research it actually does, it has around 1/2 the lactose of ice cream). I got Orange sherbet and chocolate brownie batter for my pint.
I love chocolate. I always say the more chocolate you put in something the more I like it. BUT, I feared if I got chocolate for the 1.5 quart and the pint, if I got sick I may learn to not like chocolate. I‚Äôm not rolling those dice.
After paying my 11$ I joined the table of future shared misery. We all looked like kids at the park with an ice cream cone.
Little did we know what was to come.
Wanderer set his phone down as a timer and we got in our starting positions, spoon in hand, staring down the sugary treat like it owed us money.¬†
‚ÄúBegin!‚Äù
I began slow, working the edges of the sherbet which were melted enough to scoop. It tasted good, very sweet, but good. I worked through that sherbet for about 10 minutes, getting about halfway through before switching to the chocolate. This was not originally part of my plan, rather a necessary adaptation to allow more time for the sherbet to melt.
And it was the right move. The sherbet at that point was tasting like sugary napalm and the orange coloring was beginning to look more and more combative.
The chocolate actually tasted good and was a welcome change of pace, even the texture change was nice.
At this point, Teflon finished his ice cream, with a time of 18 minutes! I knew I wasn‚Äôt going to win, my intention was to finish, but damn he put me to shame. The time kept ticking up, and around the 23 minute mark I set the goal of finishing in under 30 minutes. I was beginning to hit the wall, now ¬†done with my chocolate but still had about a third left of my sherbet. Wanderer finished his at the 27 minute mark and began encouraging me.
And I didn‚Äôt try.
I succeeded.
With a time of 29:53, one broken plastic spoon, 2000+ calories, 145% daily allowance of sugar, and feeling nothing but pride and regret, Sweet Talker finished the half gallon challenge.
I proceeded to lay out on the deck intermittently moaning in pain and feeling my insulin pulsing through my body. It was rough.
After about 2 hours of moaning I decided my body had processed enough sugar and wanted to get rid of the excess. The orange concoction left my body as cold as it entered (a very unpleasant feeling) and I felt like a new man after.
We then went to the most white trash lake I have ever seen and somehow it was worse than the feeling of the ice cream.
But that‚Äôs neither here nor there.
I completed half the Appalachian Trail. I have walked over 1000 miles.¬†
I will succeed.","

Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640248,"Today was the first day we got to experience why a large portion of thru hikers call Pennsylvania the hardest state on the trail. Despite having minimal gain/loss in elevation, it is the rockiest of all the states, with rocks ranging from the size of golf balls to larger than buses. And let me tell you, the golf ball rocks are the most dangerous. They hide in the dirt and leaves waiting for their opportunity to strike, to roll your ankle right in the moment you feel most secure.
Not only do you have to be diligent about not rolling your ankle and constantly checking your foot placement-slowing you down substantially, you also have the bottom of your feet slowly bruising from the rocks. It‚Äôs pretty brutal.
To further add to the brutality we, much like a large portion of the country are experiencing an intense heat wave. Today it was 95 degrees when we got off trail¬†at 4pm, with temperatures feeling above 100 as we hiked today. Luckily, most of the day was fairly easy grading and covered in shade, and honestly the rocks gave something to distract my mind as I pushed 20 miles in blistering heat. One of the worst things about the heat was how quickly my water on my bag would heat up. We got water from a spring and it was cool at best, but within 30 minutes it was warm as a tea let sit for a few minutes. What I did to help the sensation of drinking it was literally pretended it was very weakly flavored green tea. It helped. Very little, but it helped.
We got to the ATC headquarters and called Lisa to come pick us up, as we wanted to avoid the thunderstorm and knew there was no water/camping for the next 13 miles. It seemed we had a choice last night, hike 20 miles to a campground which is supposedly plagued by trains in the middle of the night, hike 33 miles to the nest shelter/water source, or do 20 to a hostel and avoid a storm.
We chose door number 3. And we chose correctly. The storm was so bad it knocked out the power of the hostel we are staying at. A branch about 15 feet long and the thickness of thigh fell on our roof during it. I can only imagine the potential damage a branch like that would do to my tarp, my hammock and me if it fell and I was out there. So, money well spent.
On top of the fact we dodged the storm, we got to meet Lisa, the owner of the hostel. She is easily one of the most aggressive north eastern type person I‚Äôve ever met, with a killer attitude and quick wit to match. She would jump from person to person, speak her mind and be incredibly genuine even when you weren‚Äôt ready for it.
I loved it. I missed it. Give me the north east attitude over southern charm any day of the week.
Finally, we got to spend the night with Diva and Quadzilla, hikers we met previously. They hiked the PCT in 2019(and didn‚Äôt meet in the trail) then started hiking together on the AT. They hike fast, cover big miles and we somehow have been keeping up. It‚Äôs funny how it works, it seems like everyone ends up being at the same spot at the same time despite the significant differences in pace.
Either way, hilarious and awesome people, and a great night overall. I‚Äôve needed a bit of break mentally, as the trail is long. Very long. Yes I am halfway through and I‚Äôm sure it will continue to fly by, but it does drag at times.
There are times I question if this is the best utilization of my time. IfI shouldn‚Äôt be working and contributing to society. Saving money for the future. Sometimes I wonder why I need to get up from my sweaty-sticky hammock, in my smelly-stale clothes, to hike another 20+ miles towards a goal that seems unimaginable.
And I do question. The answer remains the same. The answer is a question back:
Why not?","

Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640970,"Pennsylvania is tough. It is rocky, there is a distinct lack of water and it is hot. But for whatever sick reason, I really enjoy it.
Maybe it was the fact I was completely over Virginia/hiking in the south. Maybe it‚Äôs that I am getting too familiar territory. Maybe I really enjoy technical hiking.
Realistically it‚Äôs all three.
When I say technical hiking I am referring to hiking which actually requires some degree of attention/skill/balance to complete. A large majority of the hiking in the south was walking in well manicured paths with smooth dirt and no major obstacles. No roots to avoid, rocks to hop on, just walking. In the woods. In other words, BORING.
Pennsylvania is widely considered one of the hardest, if not the hardest state for the entire Appalachian trail. I actually had done sections of Pennsylvania prior because I knew it‚Äôs infamy and wanted to test my metal. I distinctly remember completing my 20 mile section hike with Josh and Kevin with sore feet but a new confidence that I could complete the Appalachian Trail.¬†
What I didn‚Äôt know at the time was how much I actually prefer the challenge.
For me, walking 20+ miles a day can get a bit dull. It‚Äôs why I have trouble writing Trail journals. It‚Äôd be like me asking you to write a journal about your job every day. Yeah for the first week or two you can describe different daily habits, or people you work with, but after a while it would begin to feel less important to write about. I mean, most days the most significant thing is how sore my feet get. Or what I made for dinner.
Pennsylvania gave me a new challenge which was quite fun. The rocks on the trail I feel can be split into two categories: Ankle Breakers and Rock Hoppers.
Rock hoppers are large enough boulders (anywhere from the size of a dog to size of a bus) embedded in the ground you can jump on top of with relative safety. Sometimes we would be jumping from one rock to another with a 10 foot drop between, but that is just motivation to stay on top of your game. I think of it as a puzzle, almost a chess game, I need to plan my next 5 moves to ensure I stay on trail, don‚Äôt slip off a rock, and move as quickly as possible. I thought I was very proficient in rock ¬†hopping, then halfway through a boulder field whereI was struggling at 1-1.5mph, Caveman skipped past me with ease going easily 3mph, an ego check at its purest.
Ankle breakers are just as their name implies. They function for one reason and one reason only, to break your ankles any way they can. They are small, often loose or sharp, and can hide in leaves or in loose dirt. They are deadly because they are so small and unstable you can‚Äôt really trust your footing on them so you have to avoid them. The problem is often in trying to avoid them you end up taking way too big of steps, where there is often a hidden sharp rock eager to stab the sole of your foot, and in doing so, stab my soul.
Both require constant attention, even a momentary thought or distraction can lead to a rolled ankle, a fall between the rocks, or sometimes the consequences could be more dire. This attention forces you to clear all other thoughts you may have, you can‚Äôt think about the friends/family you miss, or the things you‚Äôd rather be doing, all you need is focus.
Which is why I love it. Its also why I was so scared when I started getting lightheaded during our second to last day in Pennsylvania. I have a problem known as ‚Äúelectrolyte sensitivity‚Äù, which simply means if I don‚Äôt have enough Sodium/Potassium and water I can(and have in the past) faint. The entire hike I have not had a problem with this despite the fact I have gotten extremely dehydrated a few times now.
When we left Caveman Mother‚Äôs home there was a very intense scramble up the side of the mountain. Add in sweltering heat(~100 degrees and humid) means I was working hard. The final problem was my pack was the heaviest it has ever been because we were carrying all the water we needed for 16 miles until our next good water source.
The strange part was I felt good going up the entire scramble. I was moving faster than everyone else in the group and feeling confident in my feet and progress. After the scramble I was walking with Deferred when I suddenly started feeling faint. It felt like it did when I previously fainted, and we were walking with the ankle breakers all around us. We still had another 10 miles to go to get to water and I knew I wasn‚Äôt feeling well enough to do it.¬†
I told the group to go on if they wanted to, and I would stop when I felt I couldn‚Äôt go on and try to collect water with my tarp from the rainstorm coming that night. They, of course, rejected the part of leaving me and we established a new plan(love these people). There was 1 water source before the 16 mile mark, but it was a half mile off trail. It may not sound like much, but to add an entire mile to your hike just to get water is ridiculous. To give yourself an idea of how much that sucks next time you want water go for a mile walk around your neighborhood before filling up at your fridge. Its not fun.
We set up camp; then me and Deferred began our trek to the water source. Supposedly the source is a half mile down the windy road that passes through there, so at least we wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about rocks!
As we walked, we both began to lose confidence we would find this source, and the journey would even be worth it. As we descended a pick up truck passed us and I stuck my thumb out. A guy(about 18 years old) and girl(same age) stopped and asked what we needed. I told him we were looking for a water source down this road and would appreciate a lift. He told us to hop in and to tell him to stop when we see it.
We rode in the back of his truck looking for the markers mentioned in the app(orange tape on some trees) and were dismayed we found nothing. He drove for about 5 minutes before he asked us where it was, and we told him we truthfully had no idea if it even existed. He responded saying he could bring us to a water source but it would be a bit far, and he would be willing to take us there and back.
God bless this young man, his parents raised him right!
We sat in the back for a good 20 minutes as we got a tour of rural Pennsylvania, wondering where on earth this spring could be. We finally arrived, filled up as quickly as possible and rode back.
When I got out I told him how much what he did meant to me, how I was having a rough day and really needed his help. I asked his name so I could properly tell this story;
So Ryan this one‚Äôs to you. From the bottom of my heart, Thank you.","

Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640968,"We‚Äôve managed thus far to avoid really being ‚Äúvortexed‚Äù into a place. Being vortexed means you had no intention to stay as long as you ended up staying.¬†
We did get vortexed one time earlier in the trail, into Weary Feet Hostel, as we were supposed to hike a few miles past it but ended up staying the night.
Well, we ended up getting vortexed again, and it was an incredibly pleasant experience.
Caveman mentioned to us a few weeks ago that when we were in New Jersey he had a friend who would like to get dinner with us. At least, that‚Äôs what I remember him telling us about the plan.
So, as the day drew nearer we got more insight into the plan, which evolved into being picked up at the border of Pennsylvania/New Jersey, then going back to her home and potentially taking a zero day there. A zero was more than welcome because of how sore my feet had become over the past few days due to the constant barrage of rocks.
It was an unremarkable hiking day into the Delaware Water Gap, and beyond a fantastic homemade root beer I got right before meeting up with Hazel at the parking lot is barely memorable.
Me and Caveman crossed the final bridge, exiting Pennsylvania for good and walked to the parking lot to meet Hazel(Caveman‚Äôs Caving Companion). Deferred met her mom/grandpa(who were nice enough to get us our favorite thing: Gatorade) for some much needed family time; me Caveman and Teflon went with Hazel to her car.
Hazel walked past me as I loaded my bag and one of the first things she said to me:
‚ÄúOh my God you smell awful, we are driving with the windows down!‚Äù
I was immediately a fan. I always appreciate honesty and I had zero doubts that was going to be the norm with Hazel.
We got in the car and right away I started getting what I‚Äôve been searching for over the last 1000 miles, gossip about Caveman. Hazel would tell story after embarrassing story about Caveman while he repeatedly denied them and claimed they were all lies. He does the same thing when we tell his embarrassing stories so I knew they were the real deal.
Oh, and I should mention, Hazel either unknowingly or knowingly started calling me ‚ÄúSweet Cheeks‚Äù instead of Sweet Talker, which I kinda loved as a name. I told her I would be honored if she only referred to me as Sweet Cheeks, which she did.
We were laughing and swapping stories the whole way to her house, and when we got there she immediately set out snacks: chips, vegetables, hummus, guacamole;¬†it. was. heaven.
She told us we would be having ribs for dinner, and to make ourselves at home. I showered, changed into clean clothes and felt like a new man.
We¬†sat for dinner¬†and it was mind bogglingly good. The ribs fell off the bone, the sauce complimenting the meat perfectly, with potato salad, roasted corn and Cole slaw to boot. It was heavenly to have a home cooked meal, with food of a quality I have not had in months. We didn‚Äôt stay up late that night despite us knowing we would take a zero the next day, as we were beat from hiking in the heat.
The next day was very productive. We did laundry(even cleaning my sleeping bag), went to REI(I got wilderness wipes GAME CHANGER, will explain later), ate way too much bread at Panera, then went back to Hazel‚Äôs. Caveman began hinting at taking a second zero, as his feet were in rough shape from Pennsylvania and the weather was supposed to be horrid the next day.¬†
This is what Caveman always does and it cracks me up. He doesn‚Äôt say ‚Äúwe should do x‚Äù he ‚Äòsuggests‚Äô we do x 4 times in 10 minutes. He always says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just laying out the options‚Äù and if you ask his opinion or preference he refuses to take a stance. But then he suggests x again. So I read between the very spread out lines, the man is not a mystery.
Hazel told us we are welcome to a second zero and we plan to head out the next morning¬†at 7am, so that means up and eating by¬†6:30am.
I awake the next morning to the most heavenly sentence I‚Äôve heard all trip.
‚ÄúIf you want to go back to sleep you can, it seems like you guys are taking a second zero.‚Äù
I‚Äôve been vortexed, and I couldn‚Äôt be happier.
We ate an amazing breakfast with eggs, home fries, sausage and bacon; a breakfast of champions. We immediately start trying to get in touch with Deferred, as we told her last the plan was to hike out and she likes getting pretty early starts. I was afraid she would already be on trail, and we would be more likely to end up not taking the second zero. Fortunately she texted us asking where Hazel lived and came out to us to stay the night.
I made one main request when I arrived at Hazel‚Äôs. I noticed her board game collection within minutes of arriving and wanted to play some of the games she had as I‚Äôve heard good things about them. We ended up playing Dominion and Splendor, both good games but I truly loved Splendor.
Dominion is a deck building game with cards that cost a certain amount of gold where you need to balance what types of cards you have and how they interact.
I sucked at it. My strategy was questionable at best and I got last. By a lot.
Splendor, on the other hand, was similar to Ticket to Ride, a game I enjoy, and Japeer another game I like. I understood the goals of the game pretty quickly and developed a strong strategy and rules for how to play my turns. I also engineered a plan to focus on Deferred and how close she was to winning so they wouldn‚Äôt see how close I was, and it worked. We played 2 games and I won both of them. I felt like a total badass. Which after writing out the fact I feel badass for winning board games seems super lame. But hey, badass comes in many forms. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è¬†
We then ordered Indian food for dinner (which was lovely) and finished up some shows we had started previously.
Let me tell you, I sat inside in the a/c for 95% of those days. We watched tv(Alone a game show where survival experts try to live in remote places for as long as possible, HIGHLY RECOMMEND) played games, ate food, made endless jokes with Hazel and it was lovely. Absolutely: refreshing, revitalizing, reinvigorating, reanimating.
It‚Äôs funny, because ever since we hit the half way point I‚Äôve been feeling a little ‚Äúburnt out‚Äù about the trail. It‚Äôs just so long. I mean, I‚Äôve been out here for 2.5 months and I‚Äôm just past halfway there. We are on schedule (in fact, faster than I anticipated) but it‚Äôs still a LONG time to be living this way. Every day in the woods, every day our feet hurting, every day your clothes becoming soaked in sweat, drying, then getting soaked again. Every day is a challenge.
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here though. I knew it was going to be physically challenging, and honestly, that‚Äôs probably the easiest part. The emotional challenge of being away from family, friends, work, my other hobbies(I‚Äôm missing the hell out of gardening), is a lot. We have covered a lot of ground and still have a lot to go.
People like Hazel help more than they realize. The kindness, generosity, and humanity she showed us was instrumental in me recovering emotionally from the burn out I‚Äôve been feeling. She was nothing short of a wonderful host and I am beyond grateful for all she did for us.
Also, I totally blushed almost every time she called me Sweet Cheeks. But I mean come on, who wouldn‚Äôt blush at a name like that?!?","

Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642021,"I arrived to New York much like my first time ever, beat up, crying, and glad I wasn‚Äôt in Jersey. I didn‚Äôt even have my mom to comfort me this time!
I‚Äôve section hiked parts of New York prior, and remember lots of rocks, roots and no crazy climbs. Well, the section I didn‚Äôt hike yet, the part right when you enter New York is brutal.
It‚Äôs been hot. I know I‚Äôve complained about this a dozen times, and you likely roll your eyes thinking ‚ÄúWhat did you expect hiking in mid July?‚Äù
Well I don‚Äôt know what I expected and don‚Äôt appreciate your tone very much.
Nonetheless, we hiked 6 miles to a farm right off the trail that has homemade ice cream, fresh grown fruit and so much more. I decided to get a chocolate ice cream (thank God the half gallon challenge didn‚Äôt kill ice cream for me), some grapes, a peach, bananas and salsa/chips(split with Deferred).
I learned a good lesson that day.
(Salsa+Ice Cream) x 1000 ft climb= unhappy Sweet Talker
But before I got to do the climb I had one of the most unpleasant experiences that is incredibly private and embarrassing.
Which I will now described in great detail.
My stomach started hurting shortly after eating the salsa(ice cream was already done, afraid it was going to melt), and even worse is I tend to not digest food super well in the heat. So, I decided to go find a rest room to relieve myself. I was deflated when the cashier informed me the rest room were porta-potties. I was devastated when I saw they were sitting in direct sunlight.
I got into the toilet (surprisingly clean) and began my work. The heat began creeping steadily. Have you ever sat in your car in the middle of the summer in direct sunlight? How long did you last without a/c?
Well now add in the fact you are pooping. It was a real shitty situation.
After building two impressive puddles of leg sweat under me I finally finished my business. I got out and began mentally preparing myself for the climb. I told the Tramily my toilet tribulations and then informed them I planned to go slow up the next climb.
Of course I didn‚Äôt. I listened to my pump up playlist and flew up the hill like there was a fire under my feet. Maybe it was my competitive side coming out, maybe I wanted to look badass in front of the day hikers, maybe I wanted to prove to myself I wasn‚Äôt feeling sick. Maybe I‚Äôm crazy.¬†
I don‚Äôt know but all I know is it was a bad idea.
We climbed the hill, and I waited at a nearby stream for them to catch up. Caveman arrived, said it looked like a good place to soak and immediately stripped to his underwear. I was impressed with his efficiency, I‚Äôm so much more showy in my actions. I would have announced I was going to soak, asked others if they wanted to join, then probably would have theatrically entered the water. He just hopped right in. I respected that. I‚Äôm still going to be my over the top self though, because it‚Äôs more fun.
I joined him in soaking and it was incredibly necessary. It was ~90 degrees out the the humidity was a blanket you felt yourself walking through. We dried off air drying (aint nobody got the weight allowance for a towel!) then continued on with our day.
I ended up feeling pretty ill by the end of the day and I‚Äôve come to the conclusion(with the help of Deferred) it‚Äôs because I allow myself to become too dehydrated. I need to drink water more consistently throughout the day to replenish what I lose through my sweat.
Also, on my way down to the water source we soaked at the scourge of mosquitos I have been dealing with since New Jersey may have been the worst I ever experienced. Even before the trail, I‚Äôve always gotten more bug bites than almost anyone I know. I must have sweet blood. Anyway, as I walked down over the course of 20 minutes I killed 8 mosquitoes on my right tricep alone. How many more got away??
I‚Äôve also noticed mosquitoes tend to land close to the same spot as the ones before them. Even after I killed 7 mosquitoes going to the same spot a dumbass 8th mosquito came around and thought it looked like a good spot.
If you walked into a restaurant and had to step over 7 bodies to get to your table would you still eat there?!?
What‚Äôs interesting as well is the bug repellent I use (picardin based not Deet) decreases the total number of bites I get (not to 0) but some mosquitoes will still land on a spot that I treated with bug spray. I hate them. I hate them so much. At least they don‚Äôt carry diseases(in the US) like ticks do.¬†
They just suck.
That‚Äôs part of it no? They suck, it‚Äôs hot, I sweat through every piece of my clothing to the point it feels like I went swimming, yet I still choose to be out here. Every day I make that choice. Hell, I could quit tomorrow. I think almost everyone would be impressed I made it 1400 miles walking in the woods.
But I don‚Äôt do this to impress other people. I do this to challenge myself. To grow. To learn about myself and others. To live a lifestyle I will likely never be able to live again (until maybe retirement).
I do this because I can.
I do this because I am Ken.
And I would never want to be anyone else.","

Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642022,"Today while we were eating lunch at a deli a man stopped his truck in the middle of the road to ask us some questions.
‚ÄúWhere you guys hiking from?‚Äù He yelled from his truck, now in the middle yellow lines to allow traffic to pass.
‚ÄúGeorgia!‚Äù We responded
‚ÄúNo shit, that‚Äôs awesome!‚Äù Then he drove off.
I love New York.
It‚Äôs funny, part of the reason I am hiking the trail is to find what part of the country speaks to me. Where my home should be. Where to plant my roots. I always knew it‚Äôd be in the north east, but I feel like I‚Äôm falling in love with New York like I never had before. The people are kind, genuine, direct, and efficient. It‚Äôs so refreshing compared to the fake friendliness combined with the incredibly slow pace of the south.¬†
Since we have left Pennsylvania we have received more trail magic than we had the entire hike so far. This has been in the form of coolers full of cold drinks, snacks (cookies, chips, etc) to even full blown grilled burgers. Maybe it‚Äôs because we are just about in the middle of the bubble, or maybe it‚Äôs just the people in the north east get a bad rap.
(The ‚Äúbubble‚Äù is due to large numbers of people leaving at similar times, normally¬†March 1st-15th, and the average pace is around 12 miles a day, so there is a large grouping of people at the same point in trail. We caught up to the bubble despite us leaving in mid April due to our pace, around ~17 miles a day)
All I know is I welcome coolers full of cold drinks on hot humid days. We even hit a trail magic of burgers/cold water right before we got into Harriman State park by a thru hiker from Long Island.
We got into the park, a section of trail I actually hiked prior, leading up to the lemon squeezer. I remembered the trail being beautiful, and more importantly I remember being drawn north. At the time of my section hike I wasn‚Äôt even aware of the Appalachian trail yet. I looked up easily accessible hikes, then went because I liked the name of the lemon squeezer. Once on the trail I kept following the white blazes. I remember I even said to the girl I was hiking with, Teddy, ‚ÄúI wonder how far this trail goes‚Äù
I left that day feeling like I was pulled down the trail. That it wasn‚Äôt enough to wonder what was down the trail but I needed to know.
It wasn‚Äôt until years later as I was reading the AWOL book on his hike(highly recommend his book, I believe it‚Äôs free) that I realized I was walking the AT.¬†
Either way, we were hiking through the park and it was even more beautiful than I remembered. The landscape was open, with healthy growth and a forest that inspired wonder. I mentioned to the group it would be a perfect place to see a bear, as there‚Äôd be no way it would be startled by us or feel cornered. The space was just too open.
As we hiked we came across an 8 point buck and a doe, fields of delicious blueberries and fantastic interior views. A lot of people really seek out good ‚Äúviews‚Äù on their hikes which are often at the top of a mountain or on the edge of a cliff looking out. I find those views nice, even rewarding, but the views I often enjoy the most are those inside the woods. The oddly shaped trees, the mushrooms with vibrant other worldly colors, and so much more. Soaking in my direct surroundings helps ground me and keeps me appreciating the present moment.
Which is why it was so awesome when we were soaking in the forest to realize we were now sharing it with a bear.
Me and Deferred were hiking to find a stealth site, me talking loudly(as I tend to do) when she suddenly goes ‚ÄúBear!‚Äù
I looked and 20 yards away behind a log there was a medium sized black bear moseying up the hill. We stopped dead in our tracks, looking in awe; which the black bear returned with a look of utter indifference and borderline boredom. He watched us for about 5 seconds before continuing his slow lumbering up the hill.
It. Was. Awesome.
I would have been PISSED if I walked 2193.1 miles in the woods and didn‚Äôt see a single black bear.
So NY summarized-¬†Way friendlier to hikers than even I expected.Awesome people.Interesting and challenging hiking.Bear.
10/10, would hike here again.
It‚Äôs funny, in order to appreciate anything you need to be away from it, and I have a newfound appreciation for New York for sure.","

Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642026,"When we arrived at the first town in NY(Unionville) I had an interesting conversation with my parents.¬†
We were trying to find lodging with no options. Unfortunately throughout PA, NJ, NY and CT the options for lodging is weak at best. There are no more inexpensive hostels where it is 25$ a night to stay. Now we had to choose a Holiday Inn that could cost over 200$ a night. Split 4 ways it‚Äôs not terrible, but we don‚Äôt get the benefit of loaner clothes and sometimes there isn‚Äôt even a washer/dryer there.
My parents proposed coming out to pick us up, driving back to our house, then they would bring us back to trail. My mom said it was only an hour and a half one way.
It piqued my interest for sure. Betting able to stay somewhere for free, being able to see my family, sleep in my own bed, go in my pool‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs far too tempting to pass up.
We eventually figured out that it was actually closer to a 2.5 hour drive one way but set a plan for a week from then to pick us up at Pawling NY, where we had planned to go into NYC from originally. My mom picked us up with gatorades(always, always welcome) and we started the drive home. We stopped at a diner for dinner to avoid some rush hour traffic and was home¬†around 7pm.
It felt‚Ä¶ weird. It felt good for sure. Familiar. Comfortable.
But I wasn‚Äôt there yet. Both physically and mentally. My mind was confused, as I already determined I was going to complete the trail, and knew I had further to go but I was home? I‚Äôm not home yet!
I was able to separate myself from that thought and recognize it for how amazing it truly was. I am so determined to finish this trail that even the temptation of my warm bed and shower 20ft away are not nearly enough to pull me away from the trail. I am finishing what I set out to do.
My parents were kick ass hosts. We had so many snacks(potato chips, brownie brittle, dip), fruit(watermelon, cherries) and gatorade by the gallon. I was able to do one of my favorite things which is host people.
I take great pride in my hosting abilities. I am a firm believer that if you are at my house for any amount of time you should never be hungry, thirsty, or uncomfortable. You want chips, you got ‚Äòem; a beer, no problem; you‚Äôre cold, here‚Äôs a blanket and Nicholas(my brother) will spoon you. I think being a good host is just another way to show love and appreciation, which I have by the bucketfull for these fools I‚Äôm hiking with.
The next day we zero‚Äôed at my house, sipping some Pina Colada‚Äôs by the pool, hanging with Nicholas who truly lived up to all my stories about how entertaining, funny and friendly he is, and doing town chores.
Let me tell you. Town chores are SO MUCH EASIER WHEN YOU HAVE A CAR. Grocery store 2 miles away? We don‚Äôt need a hitch, I can get us there is 5 minutes. Mind blowing.
To all my friends on the island I didn‚Äôt see on my trip home, let me clarify: I didn‚Äôt have much spare time, it was the middle of the week, and I‚Äôll see you all soon. Sorry to anyone that wanted to see me that didn‚Äôt. My guess is the number is pretty low. I‚Äôm cool, but a break from me isn‚Äôt half bad sometimes ü§™¬†
We went into the city the next day with a plan, pizza, highline, REI, then train to trail. We arrived at Penn Station, I took them RELUCTANTLY to Times Square(Deferred really wanted to see the naked cowboy, personally, I don‚Äôt see it, he isn‚Äôt even naked!) to the Empire State Building, then down the Highline.¬†
If you haven‚Äôt been/don‚Äôt know what the Highline is it is a beautiful path on an old elevated train platform they transformed into a park. There are benches all along it, it‚Äôs got a lot more plants/growth than you‚Äôd expect in the middle of Manhattan, and has art pieces hidden throughout. Really a gem in the city.
I took them to Pizza Suprema(33rd&8th, Southwest corner of Madison Square Garden) and although it‚Äôs overpriced (6$ for some speciality slices) it has to be close to, if not the best pizza I‚Äôve ever had. Go there next time you go to the city. Tell them Sweet Talker sent you. They will look at you weird, and you will still pay full price. Actually, maybe don‚Äôt.
Either way we went throughout the city, didn‚Äôt get to see all the places I planned/pizza I wanted to get due to having to stop at REI(long walk to SOHO)‚Ä¶ but it was still a nice day with great weather and good friends.
We got the metro north train back to Pawling, camped at a ?Deli? then was back on trail the next day.
I was back on trail with a fresh memory of what home feels like and a reaffirmation of my determination to complete the trail.¬†

Well, maybe not the last part. But I was sure it was going to be easy.
NOPE
Constant up and downs with steep unforgiving climbs followed by wet and sketchy descents. Add in a constant barrage of mosquitoes. ¬†I said multiple times, there is no way in hell I could have done the Connecticut challenge. The only reason I think people do it is because there are no hostels or places friendly to hikers on the AT of Connecticut.
Up your game Conn.","

Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642024,"It‚Äôs been a long time I‚Äôve been out here. Over 100 days now. It takes a toll, lacking modern conveniences, having no goals beyond moving north and almost constant state of discomfort. I am more often uncomfortable than comfortable. It‚Äôs basically a rule that if it is not a zero or a night at a hostel there is a very high likelihood I am going to face significant discomfort throughout the day.
On the days it isn‚Äôt too hot, or too buggy, or raining, or brutal terrain, it is possible to stay mostly comfortable during the day.
Those days don‚Äôt really exist. The mosquitos have gotten out of control, swarms of them attack constantly, preventing you from stopping to take a break even for a minute. As I walk I have been getting about a bite every 5 minutes(this is with DEET and Picardin on) and if I stop for >30 seconds suddenly there are about 8-10 mosquitoes on top of me. Buzzing in my ears, biting my elbows, assaulting my sanity.
I knew this trip would be hard. I knew it would be gruelling. I knew moments like this, where I look and say ‚Äúoh my god theres at least another month of this‚Äù and think why am I doing this.¬†
Luckily I‚Äôm pretty stubborn. I don‚Äôt like being wrong and I don‚Äôt like failing. I have decided to complete this and I will see it through.
I will leave this trip with a few things:
A new appreciation for how easy and comfortable my life is. Not needing to worry about staying warm, dry, hydrated is something so easy to overlook.
SHOWERS ARE AMAZING
An appreciation for my friends and family, who I miss dearly on this trail. I‚Äôve barely been in contact with anyone because honestly it just makes me miss them more.
A shitton of stories about this incredibly strange and long journey.
My first tattoo!
Well I have to go now.I‚Äôm going to go put on my wet underwear, soaked socks, pack up my hammock and walk another 16 miles close to Maine.
Gotta hurry, I hear the mosquitoes calling me.","

Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642028,"We did an act we normally avoid like the plague today. We added an entire extra mile to our hike(.5 miles each way) to go to a shelter. This shelter was unlike every other shelter we had been to though.
This shelter had canoes. It was awesome.
Before I got to the shelter, I was hiking alone and thinking deeply about life. I had been having a rough stretch and felt the suffering was getting to me. As I was thinking about the suffering I was enduring I had a realization.
Suffering is a choice.
There will always be things in our lives with the capability to cause suffering. Stress at work, financial problems, aches and pains etc etc; too many sources to list. I realized, however, although these sources of suffering are present and can‚Äôt be ignored, what can change is how I view them. I can reframe these issues as challenges, pushing me mentally and physically, making me tougher and allowing me to grow.¬†
Smooth seas have never made a great sailor.
During this intense thinking I came across a young man around my age messing with his pack on the side of the trail. I looked at him and said ‚ÄúI think I just realized suffering is a choice.‚Äù He immediately replied ‚ÄúOh man, let‚Äôs have this conversation.‚Äù
We proceeded to have an in depth conversation about life, death, afterlife, meditation, vows of silence, philosophies on messing of life, it was amazing. After talking to him for a solid hour and a half I finally asked ‚ÄúSo what‚Äôs your name?‚Äù ‚ÄúSlash‚Äù(Super Long Ass Section Hiker). Incredibly nice, open minded and mature, and refreshing to talk to.
We eventually parted ways(I like to take a good amount of quick breaks) and arrived later than most the rest of the crew. When I did arrive I was disappointed to find out Caveman and Deferred had already been canoeing. My disappointment quickly vanished when they reassured me they would want to go a second time.
We set up and got ready to go out to an island not too far from our launching point. Me & Caveman took the 3 person canoe and Teflon & Deferred took a 2 seater. We got to the island tied off and began relaxing.
What was that sound?
It couldn‚Äôt be.
THERE WERE NO MOSQUITOES ON THE ISLAND!
Finally we had some relief from the non stop barrage of blood sucking pests. Caveman and I split a joint (legally bought, and legal recreationally in Mass) and we were having a very relaxing day basking in the sun.
I went down to the water were Deferred was soaking her feet and decided now would be a good time to quiz her on the cranial nerves. I had taught her the basics of the 12 nerves after we left Hazel‚Äôs, teaching her the very inappropriate ways to memorize them, because if it‚Äôs funny/raunchy, you will remember it.
I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs more a testament to her intelligence or my teaching ability, but she was able to recall almost all 12 of the nerves with very little help from me. I was thoroughly impressed. If I‚Äôm being honest it‚Äôs more a testament to her‚Ä¶
She, meanwhile has been attempting to teach me the Spanish alphabet, as she is convinced my horrid pronunciation is due to me never learning the letters. I disagree, as I‚Äôve known English alphabet my entire life and I am terrible at pronouncing words. She taught Spanish before so I guess I should trust her expertise. I‚Äôm getting better, but still have trouble grasping how to pronounce: J, Q, X and LL, which I think is BS that they added letters to the alphabet. You can‚Äôt just put two letters next too each other and claim a whole new letter, we live in a society!
That night we sat inside the cabin talking to Sticks, Slash and various other friends. It was a great .5 mile detour, one I really will cherish.","

Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643395,"Because you will inevitably become it. I read a lot of books about the Appalachian trail before coming out here: AWOL, Unlikely Thru Hiker, A Walk in the Woods(hot garbage IMO), How to Hike the AT, Sauntering the Appalachian Trail. I specifically read these books because they avoided the one thing that annoyed me most about these kinds of stories, the unavoidable talk about ‚Äúfinding God‚Äù.
I rolled my eyes so hard every time I read that phrase. I, as I have mentioned, have labeled myself as an atheist for about 4 years now. I was agnostic, but I decided religion was causing more problems for me than it was solving, so I decided to leave it completely.
So the idea of walking in the woods for a few weeks then suddenly believing in God again, or that ‚Äúhe spoke to you‚Äù is cringeworthy at best for me.
It was‚Ä¶
I‚Äôve had more in depth conversations about religion, faith, God, than I have in my entire adult life to this point. I have a genuine curiosity of how intelligent people could reject the need for definitive proof of something and simply have ‚Äúfaith‚Äù. When having a conversation with a religious person it‚Äôs often the end of the line of questioning, ‚ÄúYou just need Faith.‚Äù
I always found that frustrating. What is faith and how can one obtain it? Why would you want it in the first place?
I seriously did not intend to have any religious experiences on trail. I had one in the Smokies(which I describe in an earlier journal) where I was feeling beaten down, unsure of myself, miserable and the light shown through the trees for the first time that day, giving me new strength and vigor. I didn‚Äôt fully give God credit, but it felt like something higher was looking out for me and helping. I felt cared for.
Little events happened between which made me start to wonder more and more. I would look at the beauty of the world, of nature, and be so amazed by it I once again felt a force greater than myself. Greater than man. Greater than science or random chance. I felt intention in the beauty.
Finally, one night I noticed as I was practicing gratitude (a really healthy habit where you simply recognize the good things in your life and give thanks) my hands were interlocked over my chest and I was beyond having gratitude in general, I was thanking God.
I immediately became uncomfortable. It felt like running into an Ex at the grocery store after not seeing them for 5 years. It was awkward. Clunky. I was unsure how to feel and was hesitant to acknowledge the existence of a God. Yet it still felt right to be thanking this higher power and what other name is there than God?
The next day I admitted to Deferred‚Äôs not-so-subtle delight I had prayed the night prior. She was curious about what inspired me and what it was like. I was honest, telling her it was super awkward and I don‚Äôt know how I felt about it. But I also told her I felt compelled to give thanks and God was who I wanted to give thanks to.
A few nights later I was in middle of an intense debate with myself about how to proceed with a situation. My heart and my mind were at war and I had no idea who to trust. So I tried again. I asked God for guidance. I got a sign the moment I asked, and was unsure if it was a coincidence or not so I asked for another sign just to be sure. The next day the sign hit me like walking into a door. It could not have been much more obvious if you tried and I laughed to myself. God was really trying to win me over and guide me down the right path.
And he (she? it?) was completely right. I thank God for all the safety, love and compassion I have received, along with the aggressively obvious signs about which path to take.
I don‚Äôt know where my relationship with God will go from here. I‚Äôm unclear on my definition of God, but I am comfortable recognizing there is a higher power. As well, for the time being, I will likely be avoiding any organized religions until I find what I feel in my heart to be true. I don‚Äôt want to be told what is true by someone with an agenda.
But I walked in the woods, and God spoke to me.
So careful what you mock, because you will inevitably become it.ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è","

Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643394,"Today in the Whites should have frustrated me. I spent $31 on a buffet that had pork chops(my least favorite meat), zucchini pies, string beans and buttered noodles. Thats it. For thirty one American dollars.¬†
I should reflect back on this day with disappointment, or annoyance.
But I don‚Äôt. Not even a little.
Because of how it ended.
We made plans to push ~16 miles through not too tough terrain(there was actually flat and smooth walking!?!) and finish at a stealth spot at Webster cliffs. Deferred mentioned wanting to star gaze and I have enjoyed the few times I‚Äôve gotten the chance in the past.¬†
We got to the incredibly picturesque cliff and set up our hammocks on awkward trees covered in sap behind the cliffs. The stealth spot was open enough for probably 4-5 tents plus a few hammocks which was ideal for us because Slash(whose company I‚Äôve grown quite fond of) had begun hiking with us.¬†
After we got set up, we all knew it was going to be a cold night. The wind was whipping on the ridge and the temperature has dropped in the past week for sure. Who would think the further north you go the colder it gets? News to me‚Ä¶
We left the slight cover of the trees to go out on the cliff, just as twilight receded to night. The sky was bright with the half moon, and the wind was relentless. But I was embraced in the warmth of my sleeping bag and companionship as we laid gazing up at the infinity above us. There is no sight that makes me feel as small, grateful, amazed, overwhelmed; quite like looking up at the night sky does.
I enjoyed looking down in the valley below where the cars lights led the weekenders home, and I simultaneously felt envy and pity for them. They were going home to warm beds, loved ones, and probably had an amazing weekend in the Whites; but to me, I was already home. Anytime you live somewhere for long enough it becomes your home, your heart plants roots slowly but firmly where you feel complete, and my home is the woods right now.
I saw two shooting stars, and I didn‚Äôt make a wish. I could not want for anything from this world that could make me happier than I am.
I have never felt more love, joy, appreciation, gratitude, every thing under the sun, in my entire life. Thank you God.","

Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643399,"The White mountains are often considered one of the most difficult parts of the Appalachian Trail. For good reason too, the elevation gain and loss can be nothing short of absurd some days.
Our first day in the Whites, our introduction, was a 3,800 foot climb straight up Moosilauke Mountain. Three thousand. Eight hundred. Feet up.
That‚Äôs the equivalent of climbing 380 stories of stairs. Thats like climbing the entirety of the Empire State building. TWO AND A HALF TIMES. With rocks, roots and humidity to boot.
For one of the first times on trail I was nervous before the climb. I knew I could do it, but I was scared of getting lightheaded again, or being unable to continue after the climb. I could tell these fears were unfounded, but that‚Äôs the thing I have found with fear; even when it is irrational, it‚Äôs still very real.¬†
We were at least strategic in our climb, planning to have lunch at a stream at the midway point. The climb was intense, but luckily I am a strong climber and was listening to some good music, so it went smoothly. The most difficult part for me physically/mentally is how gross I feel when I am soaked in sweat. Once my shorts/boxers get soaked it‚Äôs so unpleasant I must distract myself or I may end up running through the woods naked.
I got to the stream before anyone else and immediately ‚Äúbutt plugged‚Äù the ice cold stream. This is a term I learned from Caveman(which I am now questioning whether he was messing with me or not) for when you sit in a stream and cause a pool of water behind your butt.
The cold water refreshed me more than I could ever imagined. I laid back into the stream and felt steam come off me as I did. I knew I was running hot, but DAMN. The water provided such cold, deep relief; my engine was running far too hot and it may have saved me.
We are lunch as a crew then we began the second half of our ascend to Moosilauke. I was hiking with Deferred(as I often do) and began to recognize how great of friends we have truly become. I am incredibly comfortable sharing difficult topics with her, feeling safe to express myself, even the rare times it‚Äôs critical of her. She impresses me beyond belief with her open mindedness, kindness and ability to listen. I mentioned to her how much our friendship has come to mean to me, and she shared similar thoughts. It was a really nice moment, one of many that I cherish with her. Hiking this trail without her would have been very different, and probably¬†1/5th¬†as fulfilling(and¬†1/10th¬†as funny, she can be hilarious when she wants to be). At this point she is 74% corrupted(we keep track) and I‚Äôm frightened for what 100% will look like.
Nonetheless, we got to the top of Moosilauke after climbing hand over foot up slick rocks, wooden steps bolted into rocks, and things that barely resembled a trail. And to make the understatement of the entirety of this journal, it was worth the climb. The views were breathtaking, the mountains painted the background as far as you could see. Each mountain was a little more blue than the one in front of it, until the blended into the sky itself. With the sun shining warming our souls, the wind cooling our weary bodies, a feeling of contentness descended upon me I haven‚Äôt been able to shake since.
I feel so happy here.","

How many miles are we doing today?What‚Äôs the weather supposed to be?(if they say rain follow up with 20 questions about when/where/WHY AGAIN?!?)Are your feet sore?(inevitable yes answer)
It‚Äôs funny how predictable this unpredictable environment has become.¬†

I have gotten to the point where I do not like candy anymore. I eat it out of obligation for calories and carbohydrates.¬†
But the interesting thing is this living, even though it is now familiar, predictable, grueling, and filled with mosquitoes; it is incredibly fulfilling.
Every day I wake up with a purpose. A goal. One that is slowly transforming from an intangible dream to a inevitable reality.

I am satisfied with my experience and think I received more from this than I ever bargained for, and I will be ready re-enter the civilized world with new purpose soon enough.
Some lessons I‚Äôve learned which I hope to carry with me is:
Deeper love for nature and how to respect it (leave no trace principles are VITAL, please look them up prior to going camping/backpacking).
The importance of genuine human connectionHow to listen with the intention to understand rather than respondHow to be patient for something you wantHow to push myself and my limitsHow to be comfortable with the uncomfortable (this one is toughhhhh trust me)
Hiking, hitchhiking, staying in hostels, talking with people for hours in the woods, digging a hole to poop in the woods, are all such a unique way to live. You see more kindness, generosity and love out here than I ever thought possible, often from complete strangers.
It‚Äôs smellier than your daily life. It‚Äôs more uncomfortable than your air conditioned living room. It‚Äôs not as convenient as your running water.

Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643397,"As mentioned in previous journals there are ‚Äùchallenges‚Äú and traditions a Thru Hiker can partake in: half Gallon Challenge, 4 state challenge, hike naked day, jumping off the James River Foot Bridge, and there was one more I wanted to do‚Ä¶
moon the cog.
There is a cog train that takes tourists to the top of Mount Washington and thru hikers have a tradition of showing their pale bony bottoms to it. Seeing as I am a thru hiker, and having the utmost confidence in my bodacious bottom, I was excited to partake in the tradition.¬†
The Whites overall have been difficult, but the weather has mainly held up and the climb up Washington was picture perfect. The sun was out strong, but protected by my hat and a 2 ounce tube of sunscreen I was managing to prevent any bad burns.
Before we started the climb we stopped at one of the most famous Huts in the White mountains, The Lake Above the Clouds. It‚Äôs a nice place, one I intend to revisit and stay at, but as a poor hiker 200$ for a night is near unthinkable. One nice thing is when you want food at a hut like this you can work for your food instead of paying for it.
Well I‚Äôm a cheap ass. I don‚Äôt mind sweeping.
So I swept the front entrance for 10 minutes and got 4$ of soup for the deal. Don‚Äôt judge me, I‚Äôve had 0 income for the last 4 months.
We ate lunch there, Deferred, Caveman, Slash and myself before beginning our trek up Washington. I spent the majority of the climb trying to hype up the others to moon the cog with me.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs tradition!‚Äù ‚ÄúYou can do it fast‚Äù ‚Äúthey‚Äôll barely notice it!‚Äù Were the bulk of my arguments, the only person I convinced was Slash though.
As we hiked down next to the cog tracks we heard the bell from above, signaling the train would be descending past us soon. Me and Slash got into position, about 100ft from the tracks, backs turned backpacks off. The train was slowly approaching and I told Slash to wait until we could see the whites of their eyes.
Before we had a chance to commit a minor felony the conductor began yelling out of the train. He recognized what we were planning on doing and was yelling at us directly to not dare do it or we would go to jail. He stopped the entire train and refused to move until we would put our packs on and begin walking.
I didn‚Äôt realize being a wet blanket was a prerequisite for driving a cog train.
Dear reader, I must ask you at this point, seeing as we have gotten to know one another pretty well(you probably know more about me than you bargained for); do you think I still mooned the cog?
You are damn right I did. Once it got a little past us I turned around with my pack still on and gave the people what they wanted. No joke because the people on the train started laughing and clapping, I guess seeing a hikers butt is not dissimilar from seeing wildlife. I mean, we smell interchangeable.
So, in short, I climbed a mountain and showed my butt to ~30 strangers, how‚Äôd your Tuesday go?","

Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643398,"There is nothing quite like a good vortex on this trail. An event or place that is so surprisingly good you just can‚Äôt justify leaving. Deferred and I were vortexed at the Hiker Hut and I could not have been happier‚Ä¶
We have been trying to make up miles because Deferred has felt sick and we fell behind Caveman and Slash. We needed to do about 16 miles per day to get where we needed to go (Rangely MAINE!!) and decided to resupply at the Hiker Hut right off trail. Deferred called at the top of a mountain to see about resupply and possible lunch options. Steve, the owner, asked us what we were looking for lunch and we replied burgers or something simple.
‚ÄúOh I can pick up some burgers and potato salad and make it for you.‚Äù
Oh really?
Well sir, you have some interested hikers for sure.¬†
He reassured us he had sufficient resupply and we set out to get there for lunch.
When we arrived we were greeted by a slightly off southbound hiker who seemed to be completing work for stay there. We got some fairly priced Gatorades and awaited the arrival of our host/chef, Steve.
When he arrived I could see right away he was a hard working man who did not have much help currently. I was impressed with how well he seemed to be managing everything, it seemed like a smooth operation.¬†
He cooked us 2 burgers each, gave us potato salad and only charged us how much it cost at the grocery store to buy the ingredients. For $6 for the both of us we got a pretty solid lunch in my opinion.
REWIND: As we were walking into the hostel Deferred said multiple times she felt herself getting vortexed. We had 12 miles on the day (below where we need but still respectable). It was a hot day and this place seemed to pull us in.
FAST FORWARD: I turned to Deferred and told her whatever she will say goes. If she wants to hike on I‚Äôd be happy to hike on and if she wants to relax I can relax. Let‚Äôs just say decisiveness isn‚Äôt her strongest suit so I needed to practice my patience while she weighed the pros and cons. If we shared a room it would only be 25$ each, we could shower, relax and go to town for dinner‚Ä¶
So we told Steve we‚Äôd like to stay. There were 2 cabins to choose from and we asked if it‚Äôs okay if we checked out both.
I‚Äôm glad we did.
The second cabin only had 3 walls, with one side open to the stream running past the hostel. It was a magical place, so calming.
To put a cherry on top we got to take showers in an outdoor shower right next to the stream, which was an amazing experience in the first place.
We went to town for dinner and in the meantime Steve had moved our bags into the cabin, and cleaned the cabin for us.
Hiker Hut Review:Food- Solid/AffordableResupply-Limited but fair pricesShower-Hot and Awesome environmentCabin-One of the most peaceful places on earthService- Astounding

Appalachian Trail Thru Hike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644819,"I am writing this journal long after I have summited. I often on the trail would wait a week, sometimes two weeks to write a journal. I felt this would allow me to process it, not focus on the minute details and tell the story the same way it plays in my head.Well here is the final story from the trail. Thanks for being patient.To summit Katahdin is a bit of a logistical hassle. The way I had pictured it in my mind for all the years leading up to it I imagined I would get to the mountain, my family would meet me, and whoever felt up to it would climb to the top with me to join me at the summit. There were 2 major issues with that.1. In order to get into Baxter State Park(where Katahdin is) and in order to summit you need to book a parking spot sometimes weeks in advance.2. It is a 4,600 highly technical vertical foot climb to the top.So, we as a tramily, concluded our best bet would be to climb the mountain together on our own and if anyone(Deferred) wanted to hike it with family they could summit a second time.Now came the second logistical nightmare. We wanted to summit the mountain by staying at Abol Bridge and the Birches campsite, making the final day 5 miles up Katahdin and 5 miles down. To stay at the Birches campsite you need to reserve a spot the morning of, and there are only 12 spots each day. So, it becomes a bit of a race to see who the first 12 people to get there in the morning will be. I deal with many things well, not a lot stresses me truly in my opinion, but uncertainty is one of my biggest stressors. I would rather know about suffering for sure, than be unsure about a good thing that could happen. Predictability and control are two things I seek, and I recognize they are illusions but that's a tangent I won't go on right now.Nonetheless, we made plans to reach Abol bridge, spend the night and wake up early the next day to reserve a spot at the Birches campsite. The hike in was fine, continuing the easy path we had been blessed with for the past week, and when we got to the bridge we were stunned with the best view of Katahdin up until this point. The mountain itself is incredibly impressive. It is enormous, seemingly standing alone, and often has a cloud cap hiding the top of the mountain. I can see why Native Americans(Indians?) revered this mountain so much. It truly has a spiritual feel, even just the sight of it.We reserved a camp spot for $27 each... yes, that much... then went over to our spot to see that there were 0 trees at the site we had. Luckily, Jetpack(a triple crowner) was set up nearby in a suitable spot and invited us to join her. I was more interested in taking a shower than setting up my hammock so I went over to the bathrooms and took one of the best showers of my life. 6 Days in the 100 mile wilderness, 140 days on trail, all the filth and knowing it would be one of the last times I would need to be this filthy for this long for a long time. When I got out of the shower I went over to set up my hammock, found two good trees,then the sky opened up. It rained with the scorn of a heartbroken ex. The trail knew our time was almost up and wanted to hurt us because it was hurting. I ran for cover under Deferred's tarp because she was in the bathroom and as much as I know Caveman wanted me as company it felt more natural near a hammock than in a *shudder* tent. I was sitting under her tarp just watching the rain and contemplating the trip. I am so grateful for every spot on the trail that had no cell service because it forced me to be present and reflect, as there was no easy distraction. And in my reflections, even now, I feel a swell of love, gratitude and warmth in my chest when I think about my time on the trail. I think about the people I met, the fantastic four: Deferred, Caveman, Steve; the fab five alternates: Slash, Entertainment, Tangles; the people we crossed paths with: Machine, Indie, Doc, Hermes, Trip, Deja vu, Smorito, Hannah, Nimblewill Nomad, Tow Boat, Perfect(Grizzly), Pillow Talker, Echo, Sparks, Vibes, Honey Boo Boo, Dan(Momma's Boy), the Flying Dutchman, Logan, Sweetwater, Touchdown, Quip(Tailgate), Hangman, Pickles, Cheeseburger and so many more. I think about the time spent with Josh on the trail. I think about the terrible stormy days and how much fun it was bitching and sharing the misery of the day. I think about how nice simple pleasure have become, drying out clothes after getting wet, warming by a fire, eating ramen with tuna fish and mike & ikes for first dinner, sitting in silence of the woods. I have nothing but love and gratitude for the journey I went on.As I sat there smiling, Deferred came back from the shower, which I thought was an interesting choice seeing as she probably got more wet on the way back from the shower than she did in the shower, as the rain and wind have become more aggressive by the minute. We sat and joked about how the trail was making up for all the rain we missed, and I was not-so-subtley saying I told you so to Deferred(she wanted to summit today). After a while the rain started to come at such an angle that Deferred in her hammock would stay dry, but me sitting on the ground was starting to get soaked. So I bolted for my backpack and then ran into the bathroom with plans to wait out the storm by eating snacks in there until it calmed down.I sat in the bathroom, continually turning on the hand dryer to warm myself and dry my now soaking clothes, and just cherished the warmth and the safety of 4 walls with a roof. After about an hour or so the rain died down, I set up my hammock and watched a beautiful sunset. We made plans to be up by 4am to reserve a spot as soon as we could.Tomorrow, we will make our way to the base of Katahdin, with plans to summit the mountain that seemed an impossible dream the next day. I still am shaky when I write about it now...","
