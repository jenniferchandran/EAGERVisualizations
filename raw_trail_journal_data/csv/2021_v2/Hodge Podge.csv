Hodge Podge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644377,"Following my high ankle sprain on August 22 while hiking the CDT with Daddy Longlegs, I have decided to hike the AT through much of Virginia. I have booked travel to Richmond VA to visit my parents for few days before starting at the north end of Shenandoah NP and hiking south. I do not have a distance set but would like to make it to Damascus VA in my time limit of four weeks, but that will probably not happen. Pearisburg or Marion VA seem like more reasonable targets. I simply plan on hiking what I can each day and enjoying being on the trail again.  My ankle is doing ok and I will be using a heavy brace to keep it stabilized for my hike, taking it day by day. High ankle sprains can take months to heal and this will be about 5 1/2  weeks in but is doing well. More to come...",,View Entry,"Sep 21, Tue",0

Hodge Podge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644379,"It takes three entries to go live so I did them in a very short time today to get this going. Daddy Longlegs, (check out his journals), and I wanted to hike the CDT together and after we knew I was not going to get better in a week he went back to Atlanta and made other plans this fall. Following Dead and Company around just like we both did with the Grateful Dead many years ago. I have to admit I am a little jealous of him. We have discussed hiking plans for the future but nothing is concrete as of yet. I will be doing this one by myself but the AT is so populous that I do not expect to really be alone too often. Off to pack some more. ",,View Entry,"Sep 21, Tue",0
Hodge Podge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644444,Putting everything together which has been much easier than hikes in the past. I contribute this to having done all the hard work on the CDT hike and still having everything ready to go. Afternoon flight out of Montrose CO with a late arrival in Richmond VA tomorrow will make for a tired Hodge Podge but looking forward to seeing my parents again. I have not been back since before Covid hit. ,,View Entry,"Sep 23, Thu",0
Hodge Podge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644672,"Up at 6am to make 6:30 breakfast mom made. Going to miss the yummy home food. Parents and I took off from Richmond at 7am with a 10am trail drop off. Said my goodbyes to mom and dad and headed into the woods from Chester Gap Trailhead. Short hike up to the good old white blazes, the AT. Great to see them again as it has been 3 years since I have hiked on the AT. Last time was a 2018 section hike sending the Dude off from Pearisburg in the snow.
Walked back to the SNP self permit station but they were out of backcountry permits. Will try to get one elsewhere in the park so I am legal. Happy to be hiking and the typical east coast rain came in only one hour into my hike. Rain came down hard with thunder and lightning. Did not last too long but was enough to soak everthing. Good thing I had my pack cover and rain skirt. Kept me from the worst of it. Only a couple views but nothing spectactular today. Made it to the shelter at 2:30pm which means I was moving well. Thought about moving on, but just coming back from the ankle injury kept me here fro the night. Ankle feels ok so far, I hope it holds up.
Shelter to myself tonight, surprised as the shelter log shows many visitors recently. Getting dark early, about 7:14, so off to enjoy sleeping in the woods!","

Hodge Podge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644690,"Little sleep last night as a mouse kept me awake running around my sleeping bag. Another beautiful day on the trail. Off about 8:30am to get to the Elkwallow wayside when it opens at 11am for an early lunch. Passed by two thru hikers that were finishing a flip-flop hike in Front Royal that very day. They were so happy, I know their feeling... bitter sweet.
Lunch at the wayside then a nice hike in great weather. Rolled into the shelter about 3pm hoping I would have some company for the evening. Fortunately, 4 guys came in and we had a good time talking through the afternoon into the evening.","Gravel Springs Hut

Hodge Podge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644709,"The tents close to me had stirring people about 6:30am so I started getting myself together at 6:45am to enjoy breakfast with the section hikers from last night. Hit the trail at 8am with a short down than the longest climb in SNP after Thorton Gap. Did well going up and am pleased about my ankle which is holding up well.
Had a very rare occurrence on the AT at Pinnacles Picnic Area... a water fountain right on the trail! Had to get my fill before moving on to Skyland. Stopped there for a late lunch and enjoyed a delicious blackberry cobbler for dessert before moving on to the shelter. Tenting with a couple guys from Brazil tonight. Going to get up early as the shut down was averted and I am close to a hot breakfast at Big Meadows tomorrow.","Pass Mountain Hut

Hodge Podge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644712,"Got a start just before 8am to make it to the Big Meadows Wayside before breakfast ends. The cafe was one of my favorite stops in 2017. Took a wrong turn as the signs are not great in this part of the park and ended up at the Big Meadows Lodge. So I had to hike another mile on the road to get to the wayside. Finally saw it and... NO!!!
They remodeled recently and removed the cafe! Really bummed so instead of a warm breakfast with good coffee, I had snacks and a cold soda.
Beautiful day, sunny, not too warm but not much to tell about the hike. I just cruised along all day and just kept going for a long day. Body held up great except for a blister and it puts me in reach of Waynesboro on Sunday. This is good as the weather is changing and it would be nice to be inside for the beginning of the storms. Might take a zero there as Mon is predicted to be nasty.","Rock Spring Hut

Hodge Podge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644804,"Hiking at 7:30am as I did not sleep well for some reason. Easy morning and I found myself cruising at almost 3 mph which is fast for someone just stating back again, so I slowed down so as not to injure myself and I wanted to enjoy the hike. No need to hurry. Warmer and more humid today, not used to that, and makes everything sticky. Highpoint was hitting the Loft Mtn store for a chicken salad sandwich, chips, soda and ice cream! Best part about hiking through SNP! tons of flying and biting bugs there but met some great sobo hikers that I am at the shelter with tonight. Fun to have a small group to hike with for a short time.
Moved on after my late lunch and tripped when a root caught the toe of my shoe. I am fine but when I fell I heard a rip. It was the toe of my shoe! Now I have a hole where there was none before. They still work fine and am enjoying the new ventilation. Got a nice tent spot here at the shelter and had a fun evening talking with the others.
Best part is I got to talk to Sharon for a few min before bed!","HHightop Hut

Hodge Podge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644805,"Up with the rest of the gang about 6:45am. They were all section hikers so they were taking their time getting ready so I left about 8am.
Easy trail as far as elevation today. The plan was to go 13mi to the next shelter but with such easy hiking I made excellent time and got there about 12:30pm. I did not want to sit there all day and I was feeling good, so off I went to the next one in 12.4mi. Day became muggy and hot, but I kept moving well. No great views except the old tractor seats near the end of the park, but I did leave SNP after an enjoyable experience. Passed Rockfish Gap and all kinds of traffic and headed up to the shelter. Found a hole in my pants right in the crotch today, will have to fix them soon.
In the shelter tonight as there is rain expected.","Black Rock Hut

Hodge Podge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644881,"With the rain last night, two section hikers I had met in SNP, Polly and Caboose, hung their hammocks in the shelter. We had fun talking the night away until the rain started putting us to sleep with the pitter patter on the roof.
Started hiking around 7:45am and was dragging all day. Just one of those days and the only thing to do is power through it. Another not very interesting section, but I did take a detour to Humpback Rocks which has a great view. Caught up with Caboose and Polly just before lunch so we found a nice spot and ate by the Blue Ridge Parkway. Walked with them till a roadside where they were going to hitch to a local brewery but I went on to the shelter. Decided to stay in the shelter tonight with another guy named Prof. I was just about to make dinner when Caboose and Polly came into camp all smiles and presented me with a delicious pulled pork sandwich they brought for me from the brewery! That was just what I needed and I cannot thank them enough.
In bed at 7:45pm as we are planning on getting on the trail at 6am to try and climb up The Priest mountain before the predicted storms hit in the afternoon.","Paul C Wolf
",Maupin Field Shelter,"Oct 04, Mon",16
Hodge Podge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644882,"What a day! Short milage but lots happened. Got up at 5:20am as Polly, Caboose and I wanted to do a side trail off the AT, the Mau-Har Trail, and we had the Priest to climb (3100 in elevation in about 3mi).
 We were hiking at 6am on the Mau-Har Trail down into a canyon that follows a creek with many waterfalls but had to go by headlamp as the sun did not rise till 7:15am. The trail became very difficult almost immediately with many wet rocks, creeks to navigate and blowdowns to climb over. Not to mention the steep down and 100% humidity that had us drenched through in 20 min. Took a wrong turn in the dark and had to find our way back to the main trail before a steep ascent out and finally reconnection with the AT. I had done this trail before but did not remember how hard it was. We were all glad to get down and cross the Tye River before the climb up the Priest. There was rain in the forecast for the afternoon and I was hoping to beat it to the shelter at the top. I put on some Neil Young and started hiking. Sweating bullets in the humidity and heat, and stopped for a much needed water break at Cripple Creek about 1/4 the way up. I continued on and plowed forward watching my steps rather than looking around to avoid tripping. After what seemed like hours, and 33 counted switchbacks, I made it to the cliffs where the overlook is. Spent about 45min enjoying views that would pop out of the cloud cover periodically before heading to the shelter. The Priest shelter is nothing special so when Polly and Caboose arrived, we decided to head back to the top and camp there for the night.
The rain held off and the sun came out allowing us to enjoy the views all afternoon while lounging on the rocks. Had a good meal watching the sunset and am listening to the pitter patter of rain on my tent as I drift to sleep.","Maupin Field Shelter
",Top of Priest Mountain,"Oct 05, Tue",10.50
Hodge Podge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644908,"Slept in some this morning as I knew it would not be a particularly hard day. Was kept up by a thunderstorm that roared over the mountains about 10:30pm. Being on the top can be unnerving with lightning shooting around, but nothing like the stuff DLL and I dealt with on the CDT this past summer in Colorado.
Packed everything up soaked, and joined Polly and Caboose for some coffee and fun morning conversation before heading down the trail. We were in the clouds much of the morning with visibility about 30 feet making for a wet but interesting hike.
 Passed the trail for Crabtree Falls where I used to go when I was younger. Brought back lots of fond memories, especially hiking with my mom, Milo and cousin Betty.
Easy trail day except for everything being wet. Like I jumped in a pool with my clothes on. Had a late afternoon break at a small overlook, took my pack off, settled onto my seat and started to relax. Polly showed up and sat down a few minutes later just as it started to rain. No, pour. So, soaked, we got moving again to a nice (but wet) camp in some pines with Polly and Caboose. They shared some yummy snacks with me as appetizers which helped lighten the mood. Heading to town tomorrow and plan on taking a zero on Friday. Really need a break to dry out, my hands and feet are prunes that need some attention.
Fortunately, it has not been cold which helps make the rain more tolerable. I am still in great spirits, body is holding up well but I need a day off!","Top of Priest Mountain

Hodge Podge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644911,"Heavy rain last night, kept me up much of the night it was so hard. Heading to town today so I made sure to be hiking by 7:30am to meet the shuttle at 10:30am. Another socked in morning, quiet, with low visibility, making everything pop out of the mist when you get close. I love hiking in this type of weather sometimes, with the additional aroma of freshly fallen leaves wet with last nights rain was just a great time to be out. Hiked up over a bald before heading down to our pickup at Long Mountain Wayside to meet our shuttle. Dropped Polly and Caboose off at the 'laundry mat and went to my hotel.
Got cleaned up before noon where I went to get food and resupply. Was craving a Burger King chicken sandwich for some reason and was glad to see one near the hotel. walked over and , damn, no walk-ins, only drive-thru. This does not work for hikers so I went to a local pizza and sub place for an excellent cheese steak and fries. hit the spot. Then to Walmart for food and fuel/
Got to watch the US mens soccer team win over Jamaica. Heading back to the trail tomorrow so off to bed.","Primitive Site
",Lexington Hotel,"Oct 07, Thu",6.40
Hodge Podge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644939,"Had a rough night in the hotel. Was really looking forward to sleeping in a bed but it was hot and humid so I had to keep the really loud a/c on. It also blew right on the bed so I was either hot or cold, so not good sleep.
Up earlier than I expected so got a nice shower in before packing everything up and heading to Waffle House next door for breakfast. Typical greasy spoon, but I enjoyed my sausage, egg and hash brown bowl. Lots of carbs and protein, good for hiking!
Piney, the shuttle driver, picked me up at 9am and had me at the trail by 9:25am. Cloudy all day with no views going through the green tunnel, so I just kept hiking. Got to my planned shelter at 1:30pm and could not justify stopping that early, so, off I went another 8.8mi to the next one. Some big ups and downs with a really steep down to the shelter making me glad I did this today rather than wait till tomorrow in the expected rain. Got to the shelter, did camp chores and got food out for dinner. Glad to have a new fuel canister but... what? The canister does not work with my stove! The Coleman fuel sold a Walmart has a deeper valve not allowing my stove to push it in and release the fuel. Fortunately, there are a mother and her daughter from Florida staying here who let me use their fuel for dinner. Thank you!Expecting heavy rain tonight, go figure, so in the shelter for the evening.","Lexington Hotel

Hodge Podge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645023,"My headlamp died last night so one of the girls gave me some spare batteries she had, back in business! 
A little late start as I only have 16 mi to do so I was taking my time getting going. Finally got started and made my way down to the James River. At one dirt road crossing there were three hunters right off the trail pointing guns into the woods I just left. Very unnerving making me glad my new pack has blaze orange. Went across the river which is the low point on the trail in the south and started heading up. Lots of elevation gain today making for slow going. Not to mention the rain and mist, again. No views again and everything is wet.
Finally made it to the shelter where I am sharing it with two section hikers, father and son, and Colleen, a SOBO I met at the Mau-Pin Field Shelter. The shelter was entirely wet inside due to the mist. Hope to dry out some tomorrow as my feet are prunes.","Johns Hollow Shelter
",Thunder Hill Shelter,"Oct 09, Sat",16.40
Hodge Podge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645055,"Up at 7 hoping to see the trees, but disappointment. Continued fog and thick mist instead. Day 7 of gray, mist, fog and rain. At least it is not cold!
On the trail at 7:30am for hopefully an easier day than yesterdays uphills. Right away went over Apple Orchard Mtn then the decent began. Long downs for several miles. Thought it was raining at one point but just the wind shaking the water out of the trees.
Hiked down to have lunch at Bryant Ridge Shelter, one of the largest on the AT sleeping 20. Stayed there back in 2000 on a section hike during spring break at Virginia Tech.
Started up, and low and behold, the sun poked through the clouds! Was so happy to see the light in the strangest of places!
Continued uphill to the shelter which I am sharing with a really nice father and daughter tonight. Excited for more trail tomorrow!","Thunder Hill Shelter
",Cove Mountain Shelter,"Oct 10, Sun",17.20
Hodge Podge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645062,"Up early as I knew I was going to put 20mi in today. Still did not get on trail till 7:30am as I was moving slow. I contributed this to waking to yet another gray foggy morning. I was bummed about this as the trail runs along side the Blue Ridge Parkway for much of the day typically affording great views. Not today.
The trail usually has a good view of the Peaks of Otter, but I just caught a glimpse. I remember my parents taking our family there a long time ago and I believe there was apple picking involved. Good times!
Another uneventful day... trail goes up, trail goes down.
At the shelter by myself at the moment but I expect two other thru hikers later, Colleen and Mellow.
Heading into Daleville tomorrow for a much needed nero (nearly no hiking miles in a day) and a zero (no hiking miles in a day). My body can use a rest!","Cove Mountain Shelter

Hodge Podge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647275,"Mellow came into the shelter around dusk giving me some company for the evening. We enjoyed our conversation well into the evening before falling asleep. I woke around 2am with a pain in my hip, rolled around and realized my sleeping pad was leaking air. Damn. I filled it back up and hoped for the best. Fortunately it was a slow leak and held till about 6am. So I just lay there before I got up at 7:15am. Said goodbye to Mellow as he headed off and leisurely packed up and had breakfast.
The shelter is on top of a mountain where a fire tower used to be which would give great views in the winter with no foliage.
Headed down the trail for a short day and into Daleville Super 8 for two nights. They are very hiker friendly and got me checked in and into a nice room and shower by 10:30am. 
Cleaned myself up, did laundry, washed my equipment and went to get some food and gear repair items.

Hodge Podge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645152,"Woke up at 7am in a bed nice and comfy, but knew I had to get moving. Checked out of the Super 8 and was back on trail in a few minutes. Sun was up which warmed my heart after the grey recently and temps in the 70s. Headed up to the first of the Virginia Triple Crown, Tinker Cliffs. The cliffs afford good views of a nice valley. Would have loved to stay but had to move on.
The trail follows a ridge for several miles before heading up to McAfee Knob. I kept passing backpackers all day, more people than even SNP, and wondered where they were all going.
Reached the top of the knob and, wow, what views! This is one of the most iconic spots on the AT and I loved it. I have been here many times as it is close to where I went to college, Virginia Tech, but I forgot about how great the views are. I finally pried myself away and headed down the trail to a shelter. When I got there, there were two early twenty guys making a huge fire and a massive tent set up in the shelter. They were playing with all kinds of knives and hatchets, so I just got water and decided to move on down the trail not wanting to deal with them all night. At the next shelter with a nice younger couple from Denver.
Big day tomorrow, so early to bed with me.","Super 8
",Johns Spring Shelter,"Oct 14, Thu",18.80
Hodge Podge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645191,"Up early to a beautiful sunrise. Hit the trail at 7:15am just as you could see the trail. Passed 27 people going up to McAfee Knob before I hit the parking lot at 7:30am. Nice walk to Dragons Tooth which I hit in the late morning. I forgot how steep, rocky and how many scrambles you have to do to make it to the top. I went up with gusto and just kept moving. It was then that the sun poked through making it harder with the heat. Finally made it up and had to sit for awhile to rest. The rocks were so packed with people that I did not take a picture and kept moving. Passed Colleen who was having lunch, chatted with her for awhile before moving on. Stopped at the Audie Murphy monument. The monument is where he died where his plane crashed into the mountain. The trail in this section goes along ridges for miles than drops into a valley before heading right up the next mountain to the ridge and repeats. Sounds easy, but the ridges are very rocky meaning you have to pick your way through making it slow going. Finally made it to the shelter just before dark after a long day. There is a homeless guy here who will not stop talking at me. Not crazy, just will not stop talking. About anything and everything. At me, not a two way conversation.Bed early as I have another long day tomorrow.
Four years ago today I finished the AT!","Johns Creek Shelter
",Niday Shelter,"Oct 15, Fri",23.70
Hodge Podge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645269,"Tried to leave as early and quietly as I could so not to disturb the homeless guy and have to listen to more of his talking. He got up as I was making breakfast and proceeded to talk about the difference between nazi belt buckles and telling me that I tossed and turned too much and was not getting sleep. I was awake because I was concerned about what he was doing. Oh well, left at 7:30. Hot night last night but there is a cold front coming through with rain expected today.
Straight up right out of the shelter to the top of a ridge for the next 6 miles. There were many pointless ups and downs (puds) here just like yesterday. This combined with lots of rocks on the trail will really slow you down. Rain started about 10:30am, fortunately I had passed most of the rocks on the ridge as they can be slippery. Went through some open fields with cows right when the sun poked out making for a beautiful fall farm landscape. Up and over the next ridge in more rain, getting colder now, which was leading to Kelly Knob. The knob is a very close to Blacksburg and Virginia Tech and I have been there many times. Went to the overlook rocks but was disappointed that trees had grown up blocking the view since I used to hike there. Oh well, change is bound to happen. Followed the trail down to the parking area for the knob and found three thru hikers talking. I joined in and enjoyed the conversation for a time before moving on to the Warspur shelter. The temperature had been dropping all day with a low of 41° expected in the lowlands, I predict it will be colder where I am. I got to camp, where I am alone tonight, did all my chores and was shivering while making dinner. My warm meal did the trick and I felt better immediately. In bed at 7:15pm to stay warm.

Wanted to put in a big day, approx. 25mi, so I was up at 5:45am and hiking at 6:20am in the dark. Do not like night hiking but you do what you need to. Sunrise was magnificent and I was making really good time till about 8:45am when I was navigating a steep, rocky section and I felt a small ping in my ankle. Not the ankle that took me off the CDT, the other one. I stopped, rubbed it down, did not feel anything as there was no trauma, roll or twist, and kept moving. A short time later, there it was again. Damn. I stopped and put on a compression brace I had for the other ankle and hoped I could walk it off. No luck. Started happening more frequently, especially downhill. No walking this off. With a heavy heart, I made the decision to end my hike in Pearisburg in about 30mi. I had to go slow with lower miles to not do more damage and with Colorado ski season just around the corner I was not about to take a chance.
I called for the extraction unit (my parents) and asked if they could get me on Tues in Pearisburg, no problem there, they will meet me at noon. It was a clear but cold day and I was shivering a bit. I had time, so I stopped at the Bailey Gap Shelter, and made some coffee to warm up. Did the trick and I kept moving. Made it to my stopping point at 2:15pm. Hung up some stuff to dry, did camp chores (get water, set up sleeping area, attend to any injuries, set up food hang, etc.) and relaxed as best I could.

Was in good spirits for my last full day on the trail especially when I hit all the switchbacks and did not have to go straight up the only climb of the day. Beautiful day, cool but not cold with crystal clear skies.
Trail had little views till I came to an open area leading to an old apple orchard. There was a forest service biologist looking for raptors in the sky so we talked birds for almost an hour. I pointed out a bald eagle (first one I have seen in VA and I grew up there) and he got pretty excited.
I moved on to the orchard and many trees still had fruit but anything within reach looked bad. Oh well, moved on down the trail and took a break at a nice spring and got water as the shelter is dry. Called my parents to confirm we were on for pickup tomorrow and had a few laughs with my dad. Made it to the shelter around 3:45pm and did chores before sitting down to enjoy the view while waiting for dinner. 46° when I climbed into my sleeping bag just after sunset. There is a very cold wind blowing making it much cooler. Glad I am in the shelter tonight out of the wind! Shelter to myself for the third night in a row.

Had morning coffee as two french hikers came by. Talked with one for some time before he pushed off down the trail excited about town food.
Started my final short day and made good time down the mountain to Pearisburg. Had to walk a mile into town to meet my parents but easier than meeting at the trailhead. They arrived from Richmond 10min before I got there, great timing! Bittersweet day as it was great to see them but sad that I was ending my hike.
