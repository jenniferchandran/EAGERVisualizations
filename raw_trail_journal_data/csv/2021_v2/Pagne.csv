Pagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626319,Well hello everyone!! As many of you know my name is Brandon and my Dad and I will be starting a thru hike of the Appalachian Trail April 1. We will be starting near Daleville VA and hiking north to Maine. We will then fly back to VA and finish our hike heading south to Georgia. This form of a thru hike is called a Flip Flop. Be sure to check back often for updates. Thanks for following along with me in my adventure and be sure to sign the guest book!,,View Entry,"Feb 20, Thu",0

Pagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633395,"Welcome back!!! As many of you know 2020 proved to be a year where none of our plans went according to, well, plan. Same for my Dad and I. We decided to postpone our thru hike to 2021. We will beginning our hike on April 3 (Saturday). We are still planning to start in Daleville VA and doing a flip flop of a hike. ",,View Entry,"Mar 18, Thu",0

My dad and I are both extremely excited to start the hike. A. So we can finally say we started. B. So we can stop planning, replanning, packing, repacking, researching, then looking up the same info tomorrow to see if it changed overnight. This is going to be an amazing adventure and I can't wait to see what surprises mother nature throws at us. Oh, one thing I just learned a few days ago is that this is the year for cicadas. So there's that... Wish us luck!!",,View Entry,"Apr 01, Thu",0
Pagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634254,"Pagne and I began our thru hike at Daleville Virginia at 10:37am on Saturday April 3. Ended up hiking 11 miles to a shelter to camp for our first night. So get this, I plan to hike and camp every night for the next 6 months. I have never in my life even hiked and found a camp site to stay at, set up, sleep, tear down in the morning them keep going. So this is all brand new to me!!! So exciting! The first mile or so we could still hear traffic from the main roads. But in about 6 miles we finally looked up and there was nothing in site. No roads, no houses, no barns, nothing. Flipping amazing!!! Woke up and it was around 30 degrees but throughout the day it warmed up. Highest I saw was 46 degrees. But I didn't check my phone often.  We saw about 12 people while we were hiking. And as we got to the shelter we ended with about 6 people camping here.","Daleville Virginia

Pagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634299,"First off Happy Easter!!!
Woke up around 7am and it was 45 degrees, I was expecting much much colder so that was awesome!! Had breakfast/tore down camp and were on the trail about 8:30. There were 2 other section hikers that stayed in our same camp last night. They were also headed north and left camp before us. We did end up catching up and passing them. Her name was Grits aka trail name. (girl raised in the south). We did see quite a few white tailed deer today. Stopped for lunch around 12:30 after 8 miles of hiking and it was 65 degrees. I actually took off my long undies and I didn't think I'd be taking them off till June!! I had a pretty graceful fall today, which means yes, I'm the first to fall... Haha. I wish I knew more about trees because that would make this next sentence more informative. But right now the only color is some green from pine trees, there are quite a few trees with white blossoms and just a few with red blossoms. Other than that all the trees look dead because they have no leaves. I'm super excited to see everything come into bloom while we are walking. Yes I have allergy pills and a handkerchief. We crossed the Blue Ridge Parkway road a few times today while hiking. Finally got to camp around 4:30. We hiked for 8 hours today and 14.2 miles. My body is feeling pretty good thus far with the exception of my shoulders. I really thought once I took my pack off my shoulders wouldnt hurt. Haha, what a lie. 

Ps. I can't believe I still have cell service. Trust me soon enough I won't be able to update this daily. But u till then, enjoy!!","Wilson Creek Shelter

Pagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634407,"Got up around 7 and we were still the only ones at our shelter. There was only one decent tent site so Pagne slept in the shelter and I put up my tent. Tore down, made breakfast and hit the trail around 8:30. So far we have been pretty consistent at that. Today it was in the 50s when we left the shelter so I actually didn't even put on my long undies, Under Armour shirt or my beanie. Met a trail worker. Sweet little old lady named Nancy who was helping maintain the trail. She was hiking with a rake and raking off limbs, and leaves off the trail. Got to the mid 70s today!!! I even rolled up my sleeves and unzipped my pants into shorts later in the day. Beautiful day!! But.... Today was our toughest day yet. There was soooo much up hill!!! Ended the day at 10.1 miles. Stopped at a campsite today so that makes the first night we haven't stayed at a shelter area. The main difference is a campsite is just ground... Maybe cleared off a little. A shelter has an actual structure, fire pit, picnic table and usually a bathroom. Met a few thru hikers today. (Cryptic, and Betty white). They have been on the trail for 47 days and started in Georgia at Springer Mountain!  That means they have done 750 miles in 47 days!!! Wow. They have done quite a few 25-30 mile days. Hopefully we will get to that many miles a day also. They did say that it took them about a month to get their trail legs... What's that mean you ask... Well I said today was tough and uphill. On these up hills Pagne and I would stop oh, 30 times to catch out breath. They didn't stop at all!! Insane!  Caught up to Oz and Bookworm, Oz completed a thru hike a few years ago. Bookworm (his mom) is attempting a thru hike herself (or until it's no longer fun, (her words)) . Oz is only with her for about a week then he has to go back to work.","Cove Mountain Shelter

Pagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634411,"Older couple at out camp who are section hiking got up at 6, so Pagne and I were up earlier than we have been even though they were being polite and as quite as they could. On the trail by 8am. Beautiful morning, starting off in the mid 50s. Black Rock overlook. Wow. First epic view. Alsoade our way to Thunder Ridge Overlook. Even more amazing! Met some new hikers today. Intruder was an older guy and got his name because that's the name of the plane he flew in the Navy. (not what you were expecting right.. Haha). He was with another guy named long walker (nicest guy ever). Not sure how he got his name. Ha. We are headed to a Hostel tomorrow evening and both of us couldn't be more excited. We end put in some extra miles today so we can get to town a little earlier tomorrow and enjoy relaxing. Pagne has one thing on his mind and it's not a shower... It's Pepsi! Ha. Another beautiful day that ended up in the low 70s. Today was a little easier of a hike, and by that I mean it wasn't strait up hill for miles and miles... Not alot of bugs out quite yet except for Gnats. They aren't bad when we are hiking but if we stop at all they are all over us. Like 40-50ish of them. And wow. They are little kamikazes. Flying directly into my ears or eyes, little F#&$ers. Soooo burping... How often do you burp? Once a day, once every 3 days?? It's crazy the amount of time Pagne and I burp everyday... Ha. (perhike is wasn't like that) Random info for ya. Made it to another campsite for the evening. Ended up with 14.5 miles today. I'm beat, good night.","Campsite 765.4

Pagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634483,"Got up at 7 and it was in the high 50s. By 10 it was up to 68. I can't believe we have had such amazing temperatures thus far. Headed towards a hostel today. Today will be the shortest hike yet. 7.9 miles. Made it to James River at 12:45. We had scheduled for a shuttle pick up around 1 pm to take us to the hostel. The shuttle picked us up just after the longest foot bridge on the AT. Funny thing is we didn't take the foot bridge. Somehow we missed it, I think it might have been the beautiful waterfall we were looking at on one side and the foot bridge was on the other side of the trail. But just past the foot jrodge there's a train Bridge... And since it's totally not illegal to hike across that Pange and I scurried across it quickly. Speaking of illegal while we were waiting at James River for the shuttle there were some kids jumping off the foot bridge. And since it of course wasn't illegal we were encouraging them with countdowns and clapping. One bonus was today there was a new color on the trail. We have seen the green of pines, the white and red blossoms mentioned in earlier posts. But today we c across some beautiful purple blossoms. Shuttle came and picked us up to take us to Stanimals Hostel. So this was my first experience in a hostel. All I know of hostels is what I've seen in those horror movies ""hostel 1-18"".... Wow. I am impressed with this one. Charlie runs this one in Glasgow. Charlie hiked the trail in 2019 and has so much knowledge on the trail and just the nicest, funniest guy. There was another guy here named Karhop. He hiked the trail last year and this year is just driving around doing trail magic for hikers. Another wealth of knowledge.. I laughed so much over the course of the evening it was great. Had an amazing experience here and will definitely be recommending this place to any hikers I see along the way. Off to bed, in a bed.... Feels a little weird. But it didn't feel weird for too long because I feel asleep extremely fast.
PS. be sure to click on the menu in the top right of my page (grey box with 3 lines) there's a photo page. I have only figured out how to get 1 photo in each posting but I have many more photos in the photo page. 

PSS. So on this website my pictures have to be under a certain megabite. Alot of my pictures are more than they allow. So on Facebook maybe once every 2 weeks or monthly I'll be doing a photo dump of all the photos I've taken and couldn't post on here. Some of the spectacular shots have been too big for this site. Look forward to that!!","Campsite 779.6

Pagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634515,"Woke up in a bed... Weird. Got up had coffee (with Creamer!! What a treat). Charlie (the amazing and funny Hostel host) made us sausage and French toast! I went ahead and took a second shower.. Ha. Yep. (yet I still smell... Even did laundry, shirt still smells) The shuttle was going to the trail at 10 so I'll start back on the hike around then. I did a food resupply last night. When Pagne and I started the trail we had what we thought was 5 days worth of food. On day 5 when we arrived at the Hostel we still had about 1/3 of that food left (if not a little more). Leaving the hostel today I have planned for 6 days of food on me. But realistically I probably have closer to 8-9 days of food. Not sure when I'll make it back to a trail town to resupply and I'd rather have more food than not enough. Also my appetite hasn't really been huge. I couldn't even finish a pack of Ramien a few nights ago. Got on the trail about 10:30 and it was 65 degrees. I don't know if I've mentioned this yet but wholy crap it's been such amazing weather and not at all the weather I was nervous/scared for! Blessed. Today was 10.9 miles. There were some pretty not so awesome uphill included in that but I must admit I am getting a little better at those. I've learned that uphill and downhill both suck for different reasons but my arch nemesis is really..... Stairs. I hate stairs/steps going up or down.... Idk. That's what I dread most so far. Made it so some awesome overlooks today first 2 were still overlooking the James River. The third and highest one was basically looking at the whole earth. It was amazing. It was slightly overcast today so the pictures don't do it justice you'll just have to take my word for it. Also saw some super duper sad. In 1891 a little boy named Ottie was found dead at the top of Buff Mountain. He got lost from school and wound up 7 miles away, 4 years and 11 Months old. There was a memorial in place for him. Very very sad. I did make my biggest mistake on trail so far today... So I'm dieing going up hill and I pass 2 women and just say hi, we chat for about 20 seconds and as the continue walking by one turns around and offered me an Orange. My dumb A** said ""no, I have enough food but thanks"" .  I've been thinking about how good that orange would have tasted ever since. Dumb dumb dumb. I won't make that mistake again... Ended up at a shelter with a group of boys scouts. Cool kids. Tonight it's supposed to rain from around 8pm-2am.. This will be the first rain I've encountered on the trail. Wish me luck.","Stanimals Hostel

Pagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634570,"Woke up around 8. Not raining anymore but still sounds like it's raining from the Dripping off the trees. 55 degrees this morning. Talked with the boy scouts for a bit and got on the trail around 9:15. Today was the latest that I've gotten on the trail but this morning also came with some more issues that I haven't dealt with yet. That being waking up and my rain fly to my tent being all wet from the rain. I usually roll the rain fly and tent together but that just seems like a bad idea when the fly is dripping wet. So I have a stuff sack that I have all my electronics in, and they are also in a zip lock. So I emptied that stuff sack and put the rain fly in there. We shall see if that was a good idea or not later on. Ha. This morning it was super foggy. I'd say I could see maybe an 1/8 of a mile. While walking I realize, I bet spiders hate the fog/dew. Usually I can hardly see the spider webs except for when they hit me in the face. Today I could see them all over the place which makes me think all the bugs can see them to. Maybe spiders go hungry when it's like that. Idk, just a thought. Fog lifted around 11am and it was up to about 62 degrees. Crossed a pretty cool suspension bridge. One the other side I met TentPole and her dog Beans. They started doing a flip flop in Harper's Ferry which is the unoffical 1/2 way point on the trail and where most that do a flip flop start. They were headed south so we chatted for a bit headed out separate ways. She did tell me about a pretty cool sounding camp site so I think I'm going to try to find that. Stopped for lunch around 12:30. Wanna know what I wanted for lunch? An Orange... Still thinking about that. Ha. There was a huge log there so I went ahead and set my rain fly out to try to dry it out some. It worked! Stayed there for about 45 min. Rain fly is still damp but not Dripping like it was. There was also a nice little waterfall so while letting my rain fly dry I washed my face, filled up my water bottles, back flushed my water filter a few times. While I was sitting there watching the rain fly dry another thru hiker passed me (also headed south) this was around 1pm, he said he was trying to do another 18 miles today!! YES you read that right at 1pm he planned on doing ANOTHER 18 miles! Not sure where he started the day at though, he didn't stay to chat long he was on a mission. Kept hiking and found the site TentPole was talking about. Got there at 3:30. I know it's early and I could keep going but this is a beautiful spot to chill for the evening. Partly because my next 4.5 miles I get to ascent 2, 800 ft. I think I'll save that for tomorrow. I ended up doing 10 miles today it was pretty flat and downhill so I made pretty good time. I don't think I want to ruin my day with this next climb. And... I still need to set my tent up and let it air out a little. I didn't get wet inside the tent last night but there's still quite a bit of moisture in/on the tent. Also in the area I'm camping tonight back in the 1900s a group of free'd slaves set up a little farming community. I can see where there was a stone wall built but I don't see any house/foundation remains. Pretty neat tho. When I wake up tomorrow I will have been out here a full 7 days and 7 nights. I posted a link to my father's trailjournal awhile back. I'm not sure how many of you have been following along with his side/take on the hike but I do have sad news. Pagne has decided to leave the trail. He is healthy tho. Anyone who knows my father knows that this decision was not made lightly. When I set off yesterday from the Hostel is when we said goodbye. I'm extremely sad to see him go but I understand and respect his decision. One thing I am going to do in honor of him is..... As you know his trail name is Pagne. I don't have one yet. Well guess what, I do now. ""Pagne"". Can anyone guess how my dad got the name Pagne?? As far as my health. My legs actually aren't sore hardly at all, what's sore on me is my shoulders. It's kinda funny when I'm hiking my left shoulder hurts the most. When I sleep my right shoulder hurts the most. But other than that I'm really feeling quite good. I saw a painting on a tree today, so if I would have started at the Southern terminus I would have passed the 800 mile marker today.","Punchbowl Shelter

Pagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634598,"I made it a week!!!!! Not looking forward to my first 4.5 miles today because I get to ascent 2,800 ft. But when I get to the top there should be some amazing views, weather permitting. One thing I learned last night... If you put your tent next to a creek and sleep there listening to the water you will pee more than you ever had before.. Ha. 8:30 on the trail and 54 degrees. There's a shelter 5.5 miles, camp site 11.2 miles or another shelter 15.7. Goal is the second shelter putting me almost at 16 miles for the day. Well I made it to the top! Took me 2.5 hours. I honestly expected that to take alot longer. I can tell my legs are getting stronger though. If I had done that se climb on day one I'd guess it would have taken me closer to 3.5-4 hours. Got to the top and I can't see anything. It's soooo foggy. Either that or I'm actually up in the clouds with the gods. At the top temp has dropped to 45 degrees. At the top there ended up being about 1/2 mile or just grassy pasture and with the fog being so thick I was kinda nervous about going the wrong way. I didn't stop or hardly turn my head so I knew I wouldn't get turned around. It was so foggy that my beard was Dripping with moisture. Crazy. When I was at the Hostel a few day ago I heard about a controlled burn they were doing ahead of me. Well today I found it. Walked 2 miles through the remnants of the burnt forest. The amazing thing was that the left side of the trail was burnt and the right side. No where was the actual trail burnt. I was pretty impressed by that. But now I smell like BO and burnt earth.. Yah! Ended putting in the most miles I have yet. Ended the day at 16.1 miles. Arrived at the shelter at 4:45 began raining at 5pm, supposed to rain all night. No one else is here so I set my tent up inside the shelter to keep it dry.","Brown Mountain Creek Shelter

Pagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634707,"OK so I kinda lied yesterday, well not so much lie as I was too tired to update my post. When I got to the shelter last night I was the only one there. About an hour after I got there Garrith showed up. He was out for a weekend hike. Lives around the area and runs a summer camp, so this was basically his last chance to get out and hike some before his season gets rolling. About 30 minutes after him Joe showed up, also out for a weekend hike. He's from the DC area and is going to be doing a 250 mile section hike in a few weeks so he was out testing his gear. Wow there was a huge storm last night. Crazy winds and alot of downpouring rain. I did wake up. Around 2am and I heard a few widow makers drop. Another reason I was lucky that I was able to set up my tent in the shelter to avoid those as well as having to try to dry out my tent this morning. I'm still not worried that I would have gotten wet inside of my tent but a dry tent makes for a much easier pack up in the morning. My rain fly did get rain on it even being in the shelter because of the wind so I'll still pack that separately from my tent. Sun is out even though it's only 50 degrees currently it's a beautiful morning. Hopefully when I stop for lunch I can air out my rain fly some more. I can say that the first few nights I didn't sleep well. It was just extremely hard to get comfortable. Well good news is that isn't the case as much as it was. I've definitely been sleeping better the past few nights and I can only hope that will continue to improve in the next week or so. On the trail at 9:30. In about 5 miles I'll reach my 100 miles mark!! Whoot,  pretty excited about that. Saw my first snake. I named him Snake1. I stepped over him and he didn't move. I stood there for a little bit waiting for him to move and he didn't. Maybe he was dead. Thought about touching it with my trekking pile but I figured if I did that he would attack and eat me. Made it about 6.5 miles to the Priest shelter, had lunch and aired out my rain fly. Beautiful and sunny out so my rain fly dried out quickly. This is where I reached 100 miles on the trail. Finished the climb up Priest Mountain in about a 1/2 mile from the shelter. Then... I didn't even realize what I was getting into... The next 4.5 miles were downhill. And this wasn't a nice easy dirt trail downhill. This was a trail of rocks. This was the hardest downhill I've come across thus far. Every step had to be planned, not a single step was onto flat ground. Needless to say it sucked. When I finally reached the bottom and made it to the Tye River my feet, ankles, knees were pretty mad at me. There are alot of camp sites here down by the river so I'm stopping here for the evening. I'm right by the river (so I expect to pee alot tonight, haha). Sat on a rock at the rivers edge for about an hour when I first got here and soaked my feet in the cold water up to about mid calf. Felt amazing. Still a beautiful day out. I have right about 30 miles till I hit Waynesboro, where there is another Stanimals Hostel. That will be my next resupply and I'll stay at the Hostel. Plan is another 12.5 miles tomorrow to a camping site, then on Tuesday I'll do another 12.5 miles to a shelter about 5 miles away from Waynesboro. That means when I wake up Wednesday morning I'll have an easy 5 mile hike, get picked up my the Hostel guys and hopefully be in town by 12-1ish. Looking forward to eating lunch, dinner, breakfast in town. On my way down the hill today a trail runner passed me (going uphill) must have made it to the top because he passed me again on his way down. On his way down he asked if I was a thru hiker, I said yes. He asked me if I needed anything and all could think was maybe I should offer this guy some water. He has nothing with him!! Shorts and a phone. I also passed a girl Peabus who was headed uphill. Seems like she had done a thru hike a year ago or so but for whatever reason missed this part so she was back completeing this portion. Apparently Peabus is something that when your in Costa Rica the locals will yell at you then slice off the top of a coconut and put a straw in it and hand it do you (for a small fee I'm sure). Ended at 11.7 miles for the day.","Steely Woodworth Memorial Shelter

Had my coffee down by the river and I could tell that the water level has fallen. I assume it was higher because of all the rain we had 2 nights ago. I'm used to seeing the tide rise and fall on the beach. Kinda cool to notice it happen on a river. 9am on the trail. 56 degrees but another beautiful morning, sun is out, birds are chirping. I'm basically climbing 2,000 ft today but it's very gradual. Yesterday I walked all the way thru the Priest Wilderness. Today I'm entering Three Ridges Wilderness. Oh! Random side note. When I was entering and exiting the Glasgow area a few days ago I saw a huge white building/factory. Found out that it is the largest carpet manufacturer in the US. So yesterday I talked about how Rocky it was and how each step had to be planned out. Well it was the exact same way today for about 75% of my hike. Only saw 2 other hikers all day till the last 3 miles of my hike then I saw about 10 more. Made it to the campsite around 6pm. Took my time today, even stopped and took off my pack about 5 times. Usually I'll take it off for a few minutes while getting some fresh water once or twice then maybe 30-45 min while I'm eating lunch. Today things got real tho.... The shelter I passed about 4 miles ago was the first one that I've seen that had a bear hanger. Basically a bit flag pole with hooks on top to hang your food from at night. They wouldn't put one there if there had never been a near sighting. I'm beginning to enter bear country. Kinda scary. Although really, how many bear attacks do you actually hear about? Hardly any, so the chances are pretty slim that I'll even see one. But, there's still a chance. Got some amazing views today and I even saw (I think) a groundhog digging. I took a video of it. I thought maybe he would poke his head out. He never did. Not the best camp site for the evening. Pretty Rocky and not so level. Lucky for me all I have to do is sleep and leave.","Tye River

Pagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634767,"Today is the first day that I didn't make breakfast or coffee. I'm going to hike for a bit and when I fill up with water next I'll stop and I have some greenbelly bars that were in a hiker box at the last hostel we stayed at. They are supposed to be super good and have alot of your daily nutrition in them. So I'm going to try one of those out. Each pack has 2 bars. I doubt I'll be able to eat both in one sitting but we shall see. Started to hike at 8:45, brisk 48 degrees. I'm actually planning on starting out with my puffy coat on. Haven't done that since the first day out here. Water isn't too far so I'll take it off more than likley when I get there. There's a saying on the trail that I learned from Karhop. ""be bold, start cold"". Basically saying start off hiking kinda chilly because you will just naturally warm up from hiking. So far this has been the case but either way. Today I'm cold. OK Change of plans, as I'm packing up camp an older gentleman hiked by, he was in a t-shirt. So I guess I've gotta take off the puffy jacket..(I'm keeping my sleeves unrolled tho, Ha) He's done just over 200 miles. Wow. It's funny. I always ask people where they started, they say some town I've never heard of and end up never have any idea where they actually did start. Ha. In the picture above I could see across the valley to the other side of a mountain and there was what looked to be either a golf course or a ski resort. Turns out it's wintergreen resort. A ski resort, there's still snow on some of the hills. Around 1 pm I caught up to the older gentleman who I now know as Goober. I stopped right after passing him to fill up with water and make lunch. A peanut butter and Jelly wrap. Ha. Yummy I know.... As I'm getting my food out of my bag another couple hike by and tell me that about 1 mile further there's someone doing trail magic. So needless to say I packed up and began to Sprint down the hill. Caught back up to Goober who had also just stopped to pull out his lunch. I told him about the trail magic and continued my sprint downhill again. There was a sign that said Appalachian Trail this way, and parking lot the other way. At the base of the sign was a box of individual potato chips with a note written on it. ""come to the parking lot for hot dogs"". So, I did... When I got to the parking lot Papa Muskrat was sitting there with quite a set up. He had a little grill he was doing hot dogs and cheese filled sausage, more chips, candy, oatmeal pies, soda, water, fruit (oh yeah.... He had mini oranges, the little halos). It was amazing. I had a root beer, a Mt dew, bag of cheetos, 1 hot dog, 1 sausage. And togo I took 3 little (Halloween size) bags of peanut m&ms and 2 of the halo Oranges. This was amazing. People on the trail that do this are called trail angels and what they provide is called trail magic. And it was magical. Papa Muskrat has hiked some sections of the trail but not the whole thing. He lives about 1.5 hours away and literly came to the trial just to be an awesome human. Wow. Goober made it down to us and ate auick then took off again. I stayed and chatted with Papa Muskrat for about an hour. Goober was trying to make it to Waynesboro tonight to stay at the hostel. But we have diffrent options on that. See he's going to get their 8pm ish, quick resupply, sleep and leave tomorrow morning. I'm going to wake up tomorrow do a short 5 mile hike to the hostel and I'll be there by noon and get to enjoy/spend the whole day in town vs only a few hours. I like my plan. While I was sitting there drooling over my rootbeer and hotdog a local drove up named Emily. She chatted with us a bit then began her hike. When I left the magical place I ended up crossing paths with Emily again. She's a local and is doing 10 mile hikes with aspirations of eventually doing a thru hike herself. Her and her husband own one of the gas stations in Waynesboro (where I'm headed tomorrow for the hostel). She said she has done the hike she was on many times and usually sees a bear!!!! WTF! But I learned from her that the bears in the area are herbivores so they more than likley wouldn't eat lil ol Pagne. Made it to the shelter I was intending to around 5pm. Another beautiful spot. If I were to build a fire there's already chopped wood and everything. It's a really nice set up, I found myself a nice tent spot down by the creek again. Which I had to use all my ninja/parkour skills to get across to actually get to the shelter. But my toes are dry! Oh I saw a floating tree today, what!!?? You ask... It was a dead tree that had fallen over and got stuck on another tree, it was hovering about an inch off the ground. I gave it a slight push just to confirm it was just floating there. I didn't push hard for fear it might actually fall over on me! It's been a great day, met some great people. This is why I'm out here. Ended the day at 13.2 miles. Most of my pictures from today are too large to upload on to the journal. They will be part of my Facebook week2 photo dump.","Campsite 847.0

Pagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634807,"Got up at 6, still a little dark out was all packed up and ready to go by 6:45. I'm not eating breakfast or coffee this morning. I'm in a hurry to get to town. As of last night it was supposed to start raining around 6am today but so far no drops. So I'm trying to make it to town before the rain. In town I'll get my Carmel latte, and a breakfast sandwich... I can't wait!! Oh I might even shower also. Haha. As of this morning it's 46 degrees (yes I'm being bold and starting cold) and less than 10% chance of rain till after 11am. So I should be good. Should be to town by 9-9:30. Found a new color today, pretty little red flowers. First time I've seen these on the trail. Made it to town. And by made it to town I mean made it to the spot where the hostel guys will come pick me up. I think I'm about 4 miles outside of town. Made it here by 9 and beat the rain! Whoot. Met a guy named Keith on my hike here. He was looking for another hiker called Smiley. Apparently they met randomly and he has been helping Smiley out when he's near this area. Smiley hiked from Pennsylvania to Georgia, and it now headed back north to Maine! Dude has done way more than a thru hike!! Wow. OK it's 11am I've checked in at the hostel, found my bunk. I've been to the outfitter and got some fuel for my stove, a new water filter system called befree. And a new bag for my sawyer water filter. Already got and chugged my Carmel latte and now I'm at Weasie's Kitchen for breakfast. Next I'll go back to the hostel and shower/laundry then I'll be thinking about lunch. And no rain thus far! So if anyone has been following closely to my mileage you might have noticed, for instance. I said a few days ago that from the campsite I was at on Monday night to the shelter I stayed at on Tuesday night it was going to be 12.5 miles. But on my journal I posted that I actually hiked 13.2 miles yesterday... Why the inaccuracies? So yes, from campsite to shelter was 12.5 miles. BUT... most of the overlooks are a little off trail, .1 or so, so if I walk there and back (off trail) your dang right I'm adding that to my mileage. And yesterday to get to the trail magic it was 1/4 mile to the parking lot and 1/4 mile back to the trail again so heck yeah I'm adding that. That's how I got from 12.5 to 13.2 miles.  When I post I've done 200miles on the trail ect that will actually be accurate with the trail miles. But not with all the off shoots I've done. By the time I'm done with the trail I will have hiked 2,200 miles on the trail. But my journal will read more like 3,000 miles hiked (or so). Not when I'm in town walking around... I'm not going to be adding that mileage. Only add ons while I'm on the trail. Today I'll end up walking an extra 4-7 miles. But I won't include that in my total miles. Does that make since?? Went to Walmart to do my food resupply. So I've been craving Skittles.. Ramdon I know and I haven't even had them in years! So I'm walking each of the Register Isles and none of them have Skittles. The manager sees me being a weird and asks if I'm looking for something in particular. I said Skittles. So they just took them off their shelves and replaced them with a new kit Kat. The remaining 9 bags were on the clearance Isle. She gave me all 9 bags for $3. I'm going to keep 2 and give the rest to hikers here. A little trail magic. Oh. And I bought an orange.
There are some really cool people here that I've met. Mighty Mouse, younger kid who has big ears and like to put in big miles (most so far was 49, hiked till 1am). ""Smokey"" , got his name because in the beginning he didn't have a stove and would make a campfire every night to cook his dinner. ""Not Today"" a kid from New Jersey who has a YouTube channel (Andrew live life). They guy at the outfitter recognized him and took a pic with him, a random guy stopped by the hostel looking for him to meet him because he follows his channel and heard he was here. And Goober is here, my older friend from yesterday. I've got everything I need done for the day. All I have to do is eat dinner, sleep and hit the trail again tomorrow.","Paul Wolfe Shelter

Pagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634915,"Weighted myself when I left Indiana on Friday 4/2 I was 168. This morinng I'm down just a bit to 164.5. My appetite hasn't been huge lately but it will begin to grow as I'm out here longer and start putting more miles in a day. My appetite has grown since I first started the trail.
I asked a few days ago if anyone had a guess as to how my dad got the name Pagne. So our last name is Krug, which is a fancy Champagne. So Pagne comes from the word Champagne. Since Dad left the trail I've enjoyed telling other hikers how I inherited the trail name Pagne. 
I can't say enough good things about the Stanimals Hostels. I've stayed at both of them now (Glasgow and Waynesboro). I've met so many amazing people, workers and hikers alike. I've laughed a ton, learned a ton and been re-energize to hit the trail the following morning.
I was in a bunk room with 5 other hikers, we all planned on getting up at 6:35. We were all awake by 6am. The hostel provided a small breakfast and then I walked down to get myself another Carmel latte. Headed back to shower one more time. Then back to the trail! My next trail town should be in about 6 days, 80 miles away. I'll stay at another hostel there and I'll be receiving my first shipment from dad with a resupply. Starting my hike today at 9:30 with ""No Bad Days"" he arrived to the hostel late last night from Arizona, today is his first day on the trail. We hiked together today, he's actually the first person I've hiked with since dad left the trail. Since this was his first day he stopped just over 10 miles. I continued on to 15.1 miles. About 2 miles after I left No Bad Days I can across a group of section hikers who I had met last night at the hostel. They had camp all set up and had 2 new friends join them. Their joiners were dropped off and brought Pizza. As I walked by they asked if I wanted pizza... Ummmm yes. (see my Skittles plan worked!! Haha). Great group. I chatted with them for about 20 min and headed on to find my camp site a few miles past. Thanks so much for the pizza guys!! My dinner after that ended up being a bag of Skittles. Saw snake2 today. Pretty sure he was the same type as the first one I saw. However I know this one was alive!! Made it past without being eaten whole. Saw another section hiker ""comphy"" who was actually headed the opposite way and headed towards the hostel I stayed at last night. Speaking of the hostel. So I did laundry yesterday and I have to tell you, I blew my nose quite a bit today but wow, my handkerchief smells AMAZING!!! After each use the smell was still on my beard for a few moments. Haha, it's the little things. I'm 100% in bear country now. There are signs all over the place warning about them. I set up camp literally right next to a parking lot. But.. I should have an amazing sunrise view tomorrow. I look forward to that. 45 degrees and windy right now. Going to get down to 36 and windy tonight. I think tonight will be the coldest night I've had. Definitely wearing my long underwear tonight.","Stanimals Hostel Waynesboro

Pagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634921,"It's freezing. Woke up at 7am and it's soooo cold. There's no way for me to not ""be bold and start cold"". I've got about a 6 mile hike to the next shelter. I think I'm going to wait till there to make breakfast and coffee. I should be there around 11. I'm starting out with all my base layers on, my puffy jacket and my gloves. Hopefully by the time I get to the shelter I'll shed a layer. No service last night or this morning but my thermometer on my backpack says it's about 37 degrees. I even put on my gloves for the first time ever while I tore down camp. I packed out a banana from town so I did end up eating that this morning and I'm back on the trail at 8:15.Made it 2.5 miles to the next parking lot area at 9:30. Stopped there and switched my beanie for my baseball cap, took off my gloves and my puffy jacket. Also stopped here and went ahead and made some cheddar grits for breakfast. These are part of the food that I got out of the hiker box (free stuff other hikers leave/donate) for my resupply. 
Last night within the last mile of getting to where I camped I started to feel a pain in my upper left ankle, on the exterior side. Above/behind my ankle bone. Usually when something starts to feel off, I sleep it off. Well this morinng it's still giving me alot of pain. So I'm taking it a little slower and stretching it about every 200 yards. When I strech it.feels better for a few steps. 
Ummm wow, these grits are amazing!! As I'm eating my grits my group of 6 pizza friends hiked by. I'll catch up to them at the shelter in about 3.5 miles. That's where I'm going to do my water refill. Shelter ended up being on a pretty steep downhill off trail so I didn't end up going down to it. I also still have enough water to get myself thru to the next water source. I did end up taking off my base layers at lunch. It's up to about 64 degrees and the sun is out for the moment. I had lunch with 3 of the 6 in group I mentioned earlier on the trail at the shelter exit. 3 went down to the shelter for lunch, 3 decided to stay up top on the trail where I was. I was hoping to do a 15 mile today but my ankle area is still bothering me. There's a campgrounds about 6 miles from here I think I'm going to stop there for the evening and let my ankle rest so more. Should be there by 3pm. Also since I'm in bear country the group of 6 is also stopping there. I think I'll feel a little safer in a group for camp than alone. After lunch idk what happened but my ankle started to feel better. I continued to strech it often but I'd say I'm back to 80%.
Made it to the campgrounds 3:30, it doesn't open till the first of May. I did find a power outlet that works!! So far I haven't been able to find any water except for a utility sink that pours out pink water. I'm not even going to mess with trying to use my filter on that crap. I did find end up finding a tiny tiny spring and was able to fill up my water bottles. Speaking of water. I mentioned that I got a new water filter in town 2 days ago. It's awesome! Using my old system (sawyer mini) it would take me 1:30-2 minutes to fill 1 of my water bottles and I would literally have to squeeze the bag and exert some energy. With this new system (Katadyn Befree) it took me about 10 seconds to fill a water bottle. Great investment! 
Near the summit awhile back I met a little dude dressed up as Batman. He was super cool and out looking for super villains, keeping us all safe.. Ha.. Cute. Since there's no one else here, I walked the entire campgrounds and picked out the best site. If the sky stays clear this will be an amazing sunset.  It's 5:30 now, I'm not sure what happened to the group of 6 that said they were going to camp here, I haven't seen them yet. They should have been here by 4pm ish. Hopefully my ankle still feels better in the morinng and it's not so darn cold!!","Wildcat Ridge Trailhead

Pagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634998,"I've officially been on the trail for 2 weeks!! Woke up at 7 and it's 34 degrees, with the wind chill it says it feels like 28. I haven't found the strength to climb out of my sleeping bag or tent yet. Supposed to be up to 45 by 10am, maybe I'll just wait.. Haha. I did get up and go pee last night and I must say. The stars were so bright and amazing! It was freezing otherwise I would have just sat there and looked up for awhile. Pretty slow moving this morning. Back on the trail at 9am its up to 43 degrees and the sun is out. Just alot of wind! The shelter I'm shooting for is 15 miles away. Yesterday luckily since my ankle was hurting me was actually the easiest hiking day I've had thus far in terms of uphills and downhills. Today I'm not so lucky. There are alot of ups and downs. But my ankle is feeling alot better as I'm moving around this morning. Hopefully it stays that way throughout my hike. Lol OK so I found the site with the best view but definitely the windiest!! I hiked for about 3 min rounded a corner and boom, wind is basically gone. Then I saw a deer who wasn't scared of me at all. I got to about 20 ft from it before it moved off trail.
Made to the turn just past camp and took off my gloves since the wind died. Then 1 mile in stopped and took off my puffy jacket. Another mile I stopped and took off my long underwear and under armour. Of course right as I'm taking off my long underwear 2 ladies walk by then a guy named uphill. Who I met at the hostel. Last year he did the Pacific Crest Trail. This year he's doing the Appalachian Trail. 
Passed by 9 ladies that were doing some trail maintenance. I made sure to thank each and every of them. They are out here working hard making the trail safer and easier to hike for all of us, no just thru hikers. 
I was going to stop for lunch at the first shelter I came to (6.3 miles from my camp) but..... Remember me mentioning Karhop? I met him in Glasgow at the hostel. He's the one that taught me be bold start cold. He's hiked the trail before and this year is just out doing trail magic. Well guese who I ran into at an overlook about 1 mile before the shelter. Karhop!!! He had some goodies for me so I ate with him and chatted for about 30 min. I had 2 halo Oranges, a coke, cheetos, and a chewy granola bar. Fantastic lunch!! People are awesome. Made it to the shelter at 12:30, currently 64 degrees. Didn't stop because I didn't need to stop for lunch any more. I have another 8 miles till I hit the next shelter which I plan to stay at for the evening. 
Made it to the shelter at 4:30. There are about 8 other thru hikers here. All started at Harper's Ferry. Nice bunch. I found myself a tent site. This is the first shelter that actually has designated tent sites vs just find a flatish spot around the shelter. There are 7  tent sites here. I'm pretty hungry tonight so I'm actually going to be a fatty and eat twice. I made dinner #1 (ramien and tuna) before I even set up my tent and everything. I'll make dinner #2 (Teriyaki noodles) here in about 2 hours, 7ish. I have an extra dinner because the other night that group offered me pizza and I got 2 slices and they were huge. Also trying to eat some of the weight that I've been carrying. Tomorrow I'm going to pass by another campgrounds where their camp store is open (I know this because Karhop is staying there) so I think I'm going to grab dinner there and some more candy.. Speaking of carrying weight. One thing I've adjusted since I first started the hike is I'm not always going to be carrying 2 full water bottles. Each full bottle (1 liter) is right about 2.5 lbs. So both of them full adds 5lbs to my bag. Ouch. So if there's a water source near ill fill up when I need to Instead of always filling both bottles when I cross a stream like I was doing in the beginning.. Usually if I have one full bottle that will last me while hiking till I get to another water source and then some. 
My ankle felt great all day till around mile 11. There was a pretty long/steep downhill and it really started to bother me again. However once I got to uphill and straits it was just fine.
Currently 52 degrees. Supposed to rain just a little bit in the next hour and get down to a low of 39 tonight. Ended the day at 15.4 miles.","Loft Mountain Campgrounds

The campgrounds that I spoke of yesterday is a little over 11 miles. Headed there first. Then I'll continue on to a camp site. There's a shelter about a mile past and the a few stealth spots scattered along the next few miles. So I've spoke of shelters, campsites and now mention the word stealth spot. So stealth spot is an unmarked, unofficial camp site. Usually at an overlook, or sometimes just in the middle of the woods, or by a stream. Usually not the flatest and usually only room for 1-2 tents. There are also these things called 5 star hotels but they are extremely elusive on the trail. Haha.I talked a little yesterday about the water weight. See week one I would have filled both of my water bottles before I left this shelter. Today I'm walking out of camp with only 70% of one of my bottles. There's a stream 3 miles ahead. I just had breakfast (grits which use water, and coffee which is water) so I've already drank over 1/2 a bottle so I'm confident that 70% of one will last me these miles. Also it's only 45 degrees so I'm not going to be dripping sweat anytime soon. This won't be the case in June/July though.
 9:15 and I'm on the trail. I'm the last to leave the shelter. Also starting off with just my regular clothes. No base layer, coat, beanie, gloves. I'm so hard core. Ha. 
Boom. I can feel myself getting faster. Made it to the stream. 3.3 miles in 1hr and 10 min. 
Made it to a picnic area. Going to have lunch here. It's 11:50 and 52 degrees. So far I've hiked 6.5 miles this morning. Only 5.3 more miles till I make it to the campgrounds which means... CANDY!! Hehe, I'm overly excited about that. Hope to be there around 2. 
Ok made it to the campgrounds around 2:30. Saw Karhop there and chatted with him. Also the lady who is running the campgrounds is a long distance hiker named Kris. Short for ludicrous she was super friendly. Also met Jimmy who is on day 3 of this flip flop thru hike. I ended up buying some candy and there was a hiker box there so I took a few items out of there as well. I'll post pics of what I scored at the store. Ended up being there for 1.5 hours. Charged my phone and just being chatty with everyone. Made it to the shelter around 4:30. I was planning on going past this shelter tonight but after lunch my ankle started to bother me again and I really don't want that to get worse as I still have 2,000 miles to hike. BTW. The shelter that I'm at tonight is the unofficial 1/2 way point thru the Shenandoah park. Also tomorrow when I reach the next shelter I will hit the 200 mile mark!! Tonight at the shelter there 2 other guys. Paul who is just out for a few days. He was actually at the last shelter I was at, I just thought he was with the other group. And there's turtlehawk... Yep. His name took alot longer to explain than mine does.. Nice guy though. Sounds like both of these guys will be with me for the next 2 days.. No service tonight. I had a good day today. Again, I wish I would have gotten a few more miles in but I don't want to push my ankle. 
The next shelter is about 12 miles away and I'm going to take it easy getting there. Maybe I was hiking too fast this morning and that's what upset my ankle. I was really hoping to consistently do 15 miles a day this week but I don't want to push my ankle when I still have so far to go. Ended the day at 12.8 miles.","Hilltop Hut Shelter

It didn't, I was hoping to have dinner there. So hopefully I'm not wrong about today, there are 2 spots that have the potential for hot food unless they aren't open for season yet, or it's not open due to covid. Fingers crossed one of them will be open. If not thats ok though, I still should have many great picture opportunities. And I do have plenty of food.OK woke up at 7:15 and it's raining outside. Went ahead and got up and packed up everything except for my tent. Went over to the shelter (out of the rain) and made breakfast and had my coffee. Once I was done eating the rain had slowed down so I tore down my tent. 9:20 was on the trail at about 46 degrees. 
Ended up hiking with Paul today. We made it to the first place with possible hot food at 12:45, up to about 60 degrees and the sun is out. Stopped in there and they of course did not have hot food and the next place north doesn't open till next Friday. But I did find out that 9 miles from here is a place thats open and serving breakfast/lunch/dinner. I did end up getting a chicken salad and a tuna salad sandwich. So finally tomorrow for lunch I'll get my cheeseburger or something hot! I guess now I'm excited about tomorrow. Lol.
Made it to the shelter around 4:30, currently 59 degrees.  We were at the wayside (basically a little gas station) for about 45 min eating and drying out our rain flys since it was sunny and they were soaking wet from the rain last night. Paul and I had some great conversations on our hike. So far we are the only 2 here but Turtlehawk said he would be here also tonight but it didn't appear as if he had even woken up this morinng when Paul and I left camp. Time will tell. I can happily say that my ankle didn't bother me at all today. So hopefully that's just a thing of the past. I have another short hike tomorrow to the shelter then I'll be in town at a hostel on Wednesday. 
Turtlehawk made it. Ha. So there's another cabin here down from the shelter. You can rent them. This one happens to be vacant so I'm down here going to watch this amazing sunset. Cabin is all locked up tight. This is the second cabin I've seen in Shenandoah like this (all locked up, reservation only) it's pretty neat.

Once I get done eating and have warmed up a bit ill go back and pack my backpack and tear down my tent.  Not raining today but I kinda liked my routine yesterday morning.

On the trail at 8:25. I think thats the earliest I've started. Made it to the Skyland Resort around 10:45. Again I was miss lead... This restaurant is open, but doesn't open till noon. So ya know what. I've got time. I'm going to wait. They did have a little coffee shop so I did get a Carmel Latte while I wait. And since I didn't have service last night I'll update/post yesterday's journal. Walked with Paul this morning but he didn't want to wait around so he went ahead and hit the trail. We did walk by a big stable facility. Looks like you could rent horses there and take them on trail rides. One thing about the Appalachian Trail that I really like and didn't even realize is it's only a foot trail. No bikes, horses, motorized vehicles. 
A random thing. So my entire life I've never really remembered my dreams. Maybe once every other month I'll remember one. Since I've been on the trail, today being day 18. I've remembered my dreams about 6 times. Crazy right! Does that mean I'm sleeping better out here??
I finally got my cheeseburger!!!
OK back on the trail at 1pm, 62 degrees and sun is shining.
Just found a third rentable cabin about 1 mile north of Skyland Resort. 
I'm 2 miles from the shelter I'm headed to so I'm not concerned about time. The trail goes right by a picnic area. I decided to stop because it's beautiful out and just sit for a bit. Otherwise I'm just going to do the same thing at the shelter, but for longer. Sunny, 72 degrees, slight breeze. Im sitting on a picini table and out of no where this girl comes up from behind me and asks if I'm thru hiking. I said yes and she gave me..... Some halo Oranges!!!!!! The world really is full of amazing humans. We all just get so caught up in whatever we get ourselves caught up in that far too often we forget to just be good and kind to others. 
Fun Fact. The Appalachian Trail runs through 102 miles of the Shenandoah National Park. There are a total of 511 miles of trails in the park. So far I've done about 70 miles of them.
I've really kind of taken it easy the past 3 days, trying to make sure my ankle area was doing OK (today it didn't bother me at all). Also the past 3 days have been pretty easy, no big elevations (except for the one your about to read about), low miles and I've had somewhere to stop and get some real food, candy, soda. I had no situations like that for the first 120 miles. So these past 3 days have been like a vacation. 
Ok, I'm kinda proud of myself. When I left the picnic area I knew I had a big ascent and decent coming up. So as I see the hill I see a marker saying. Pinnacle mountain. My dad had sent me a email a few days back saying that pinnacle was going to be a tuff climb 1,129 ft. I had totally forgot about that till I saw the sign. I decided to see how far up I could get without stopping. Well I made it all the way to the top without stopping. My legs felt great, I wasn't even concentrated on them I was concentrating on my breathing and heart beat. Got to the top and really wasn't out of breath. It felt great! Also Pinnacle is said to be one of the top ten view points on the trail. It was breathtaking.
Made it to camp around 4:30. 6 people here total. Me, Paul, Turtlehawk, a guy who's thru hiking and started in Georgia Feb 24th averaging 20 miles a day. And 2 teachers who are out hiking a loop because their students are in Spring break. It's really windy this evening. 
My photos of the view from Pinnacle Mountain are too big to load on this website. They will be on Facebook soon.

Paul and I hiked to the road where I was to be picked up. He continued on. Today is his last day on the trail. Made it to the road by 8:40. Turltehawk showed up about 5 minutes later.
We were picked up about 9:10 and brought to the hostel. Cute little house, extremely similar hostel to the other 2 that I've stayed at. However the big difference is apparently this one is pet friendly. Turtlehawk has a dog named KayLynn, the hostel owner has 3 cats and a dog. Anyone who knows me knows this is an issue. My day definitely went down hill from there. I was in the hostel for about 10 min and I could already feel my allergys bothering me. I can't stay here. I talked to the owner, she totally understood and is still willing to take me back to the trail in the morning. I checked Into a little hotel just down the road. A little closer to the resupply spot/restaurants/laundromat ect. I end up spending 3x as much to stay in town for the night. And I don't get to enjoy the atmosphere of being at a hostel with other hikers. So far Turtlehawk is there, Jimmy (who I met on his day 3 at the campgrounds store), and Jim who is doing section hiking. I'm dissapointed I won't be there to just enjoy the company and conversation. 
Got some breakfast, took a super long shower, now I'm at the laundromat. At the hostel they have clothes you can borrow while you do laundry. Laundromat doesn't have that option. Since everything I have is dirty I'm sitting here in my rain coat and rain pants. Lol. After this I'm headed to the store to get my resupply. This resupply should be similar to my last one in Waynesboro.. Dad sent me a resupply box and has basically everything I need. So my resupply should be fairly cheap again. I do need some packs of tuna or chicken to add to the ramien he sent. I also need a toothpaste some superglue to reinforce the front of my shoes. That's about it. Oh, and a little more candy. Ha. 
While at breakfast I met another hiker named Whistle. He got his name from night hiking, he was nervous about bears so he started to Whistle. Ended up at a shelter and didn't realize it since it was dark. He camped there and when he woke up the hikers that were already at the shelter all named him Whistle. 
I read through my guestbook on this journal and I saw 2 people following my journey had asked where I'm from. I lived in Indiana for most of my life. 0-10 Indianapolis. 10-20 Monon Indiana. 20-30 Indianapolis. 30's I've been to the St.Thomas Virgin Islands, Bend Oregon, and South Padre Island Texas. 
Made it back to the hotel around 4:30 and ate some Chinese food. Tonight I just relax in a comphy bed watching TV. I plan to be picked up around 10 am and back on the trail by 10:30am tomorrow. 
Just got a txt from Nobad Dayz. He's at the hostel also. Stupid allergies. But sounds like we will be dropped off around the same time tomorrow, maybe on the same shuttle. Both plan on spending the night at the same shelter about 15 miles north so we will get to catch up a bit then it sounds like.

Pagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635423,"Got a txt after I had posted my journal last night that the shuttle will be here at 9am, not 10am. Also found out that Nobad Dayz is going to take a Zero today so I won't see him tonight at the shelter. A ""Zero"" is a day where we hike 0 miles on the trail. Most oftenly used to rest up or heal something. What I did yesterday only hiking like 3.4 miles, thats called a ""Nero"" a day where we hike near Zero miles in the trail. So technically I still have yet to take a Zero. My next resupply/town visit will be in Harper's Ferry about 80 miles away. That's the unofficial 1/2 way point on the trail. Got another txt saying the shuttle back to the trail will now be closer to 10am. Ha.Woke up at 6:30 and definitely went back to sleep and actually slept till 8. I must say I slept like a little baby last night. Didn't wake up at all but also I don't remember any dreams. Says its 34 degrees outside so I put on all my clothes and walked across the street to the shell station for some coffee. As I walk over its sunny, no wind and actually feels amazing outside. I'm standing at the coffee station and I can't find the sugar. One of the ladies asked me if I was looking for something (I must always have that look on my face. Haha) I said sugar. She said they don't have sugar packets. This was the first time I'd seen they are actually in a machine. Just like you would for coffee, or Creamer, you press a button and it shoots out the equivalent of one packet of sugar. You just pick if you want regular, yellow, blue, pink kinds. I've never seen a machine like that. Have you?
I just ate my fortune cookie from Chinese food yesterday. I gotta say it's kind of perfect. ""It matters not what road we take but rather what we become on the journey""... Wow. Well played fortune. 
The worst part of leaving a town is I leave with a full pack. I came into town with about 2 lbs of food or less. I'm leaving with closer to 10+lbs. But... My lunch today is left over pizza! So I have that to look forward to!!
On the trail at 10:05, 46 degrees. 
Made it to a wayside for lunch at 1:15. Hiked 9 miles this morinng and have about 6 to go. Ran into the 2 guys that took the shuttle with me (both started at Springer Georgia) ""Long Shot"" who got his name from being a sniper and ""No Plans"". I just assumed where he got his name, I didn't ask. Yes I stopped here for lunch. But NO I'm not buying anything. I'm just using their microwave to warm up my left over pizza from last night. I had 6 peices of it left. When the sun is out and it's not crazy windy it's been beautiful outside. But thats only been for about 15 min prior to lunch. I've been hiking in the shade and with some crazy wind. I think I'm going to put on my under Armour shirt for these next 6 miles. 
Left the wayside at 1:45
Made it to the shelter at 4pm, still pretty early. There are the most people I've ever seen at a shelter here. There are like 20 people. I got the last tent site. Thank God, I'm not outdoorsy enough to judt sleep in a shelter next to a bunch of random people. I'm sure I'll get there eventually, just not there yet. 
Saw a wild turkey on the way here. The last time I saw one of those it flew into my RV's windshield and poked a hole in it!! 
For about 2 miles today after lunch I kept seeing what I thought were snow flurries!!!! Just a very small amount. I passed 3 ladies, then 2 girls, asked them all if I was crazy or if they saw the snow also. Turned out I'm not crazy! There is a freeze warning for tonight. Which means I have to sleep with my water filters. They can't freeze, if they freese they don't work (so says the rumors). They will be in my sleeping bag with me. Supposed to get down to around 29 degrees. Wind is still pretty strong so with the windchill it should be even colder! Yuck. It's going to be hard to get the motivation to get going tomorrow and I plan to do right around 17 miles tomorrow, which will be my furthest day thus far. High I saw today was 52 degrees. 
Ended my day at 14.8 miles.","The Cardinal Inn Luray, VA

Pagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635483,"Woke up at 6:30 and yep, it's cold. Didn't really just lay there for awhile though I actually got up and changed into my hiking clothes. Got everything in their stuff sacks except for my sleeping pad and tent. Went down and got my foog bag out of the bear box. Came back to my tent and made breakfast (2 oatmeal packs) and some coffee. It definitely got cold last night I ended up sleeping in my puffy jacket and my beanie. This morning the wind has stopped so that will help with the first few hours of my hike till it warms up outside. That wind yesterday was just cutting right through me. It was chilly.I found a puff ball of insulation when I was packing everything up. Had to have come from either my sleeping bag or my puffy coat. I can't find a rip in either of them... Hummmm. I'll keep you posted on that. Ha.
Turns out only about 1/3 of the people staying here are actually thru hiking the trail. Most were/are just out here for the weekend. I met Stitch, Thumbelina, boomarang, Happy (who I met in Waynesboro) showed up around 10pm and had to sleep on the picnic table he said. That's all the names I can remember. Oh long shot and no plan were here also. (also heard a rumor that long show is doing a yo yo.. So that means he's going to thru hike. Then turn around and walk back south and do it again!!!! What!! 
Yesterday I hiked just under 15 miles but got started at 10am. I had hoped I'd make it to the shelter by 5. Ended up making it here by 4. Today I'm going to be on the trail by 8:20 but planning for my longest hike yet. Right about 17 miles. Hopefully I'll be to the camp site around 4pm again. But the site I'm heading to says there are only 4 camp sites. Hopefully I beat some of this crowd there. 
So right when I was leaving camp long shot, no plans, and the other group of 4 were leaving camp also. All 6 of them started at Springer so they have 730 miles on me. So my goal was to see how long I could keep up with them. Well I was able to keep up with the group of 4 for about 3 miles. Then they slowly faded into the distance. 
Ended up passing the group of 4. They had stopped to rest/eat around 10:30 ish. I ate a gronola bar while I was walking so I didn't stop. They ended up catching up to me at a parking lot where there was a truck and in the bed was some trail magic. I had a cherry Pepsi and some beef sticks (like a slim Jim). Found out the fourth ones name is pickles. They are ages 19-21. I went ahead and kept going they stayed at the parking lot awhile longer. 
Today at noon I officially exited the Shenandoah National Park. I can now say I hiked the entire AT thru the park. Pretty cool. I must say that those last 100 miles have been my favorite in the hike thus far for 3 reasons. 
1. The terrain, it was flatter than my first 130 miles and the ups and downs weren't as steep or long. 
2. The availability of food. I mean I stopped 3 days in a row and was able to buy some candy, sandwiches, soda. I didn't have that opportunity the frist 130 miles, like at all. 
3. All the shelters have bear boxes. Which is so much more convenient than having to hang my food in a tree every night. 
Stopped at the first shelter north of the park for lunch. Got here at 12:30, 56 degrees and I've hiked just under 11 miles. 
I made it thru the Shenandoah National Park 100 miles in 8 days. I'm going to say 7 days since I spent one day mostly in town. There's a strech called the 100 miles of wilderness coming up in about a month or so. I hope to be doing 20+ miles a day and make it thru there in 5 days. There's also what hikers call the 4 State challenge coming up (before the 100miles of wilderness). It's a strech of 44 miles and takes you thru 4 states. Alot of hikers try to do it in one day. Just for bragging rights. I don't think I'll try it, I'll shoot for 2 days. 22 miles a day sounds much better to me. At least at this point in my hike. 
Leaving this shelter at 1pm, I have about 6.5 miles to go before I get to where I plan to camp tonight. 
Just saw a group of about 15 deer. They ran off before I could even think about getting my camera out.
Found MORE trail magic. This one had a cooler sitting there with Gatorade in it. I have enough water so I started to pass it buy then I remembered the orange. I know if I don't take one all I'll be thinking about for the next few days will be a darn Gatorade! Ha. I didn't chug it and leave the bottle there. Figure I'll drink it tonight with dinner. But dang I can actually feel the weight from the bottle on my pack. 
Wow so as soon as I left the Shenandoah park its like I'm in a whole different world. You've seen the pictures I've posted on here and Facebook and all the trees look dead. No leaves yet, hardly any green in the bushes. Well just North of the park it's completely changed. All the trees have green leaves on them. You can smell Spring in the air. It's quite amazing. I've been waiting to walk into an area like this. As I got close to Front Royal (small town on the trail, well near the trail) I saw my first house that I could like throw a rock and hit from the trail. I've seen about 6 or so houses that I could hit with a golf ball if I had my driver, but none this close. Also there was a huge fence around a big area of land. Fence lasted at least 1/2 a mile. There was a spot where the fence was down. All I could think was the velocis raptors have escaped!!! 
2:45 and I have 2.5 miles till I get to my camp site. Found a nice little stream and sat down for a bit had another cliff bar and the other peice of beef stick I got from the trail magic. It's turned into a beautiful day. I unzipped my pants into shorts awhile back and even rolled up my sleeves and I'm not cold! Finally. Sun is out and my phone says it's 59 degrees but it feels more like 65. 
Made it to this camp site at 4pm. So far I'm the only one here and there's another shelter 2 miles north so chances are I might be alone here. 
It's supposed to rain tomorrow. It doesn't look like it's going to start till between 2-3. I haven't had to hike in the rain yet and ya know what... I really don't want to. There's a shelter about 12 miles from here I'm going to try to make it to before it starts to rain. The shelter after that is 20 miles from here. NOPE. 
I feel like I just entered Level 3 of the hike. Level one was my first 130 miles. Tough terrain, no trail legs yet, not really sure what's going on. Lever 2 was Shenandoah, easier terrain, getting my trail legs, lots of goodies to eat. Level 3 I just walked into the Jungle!!! 
I'm so glad I stopped, took off my pack and say down for about 15 minutes by that stream since the next 2 miles were uphill..
Ended my day at 17.2 miles. My furthest hike yet. I really want to be in the 20 range by week 5. Oh guess what?? Tomorrow starts week 4!!!
Oh I forgot to say this yesterday.. When I left the hotel I filled up one of my water bottles. What a mistake. That water really tasted nasty compared to the water I've been drinking out here. 
Whats your favorite color of Starburst?? If it's pink you have to buy Wylees Strawberry Lemonade Singles Togo. They taste just like a pink Starburst. Amazing!! 
As I'm changing clothes to go to bed tonight I found my first Tick on my upper thigh. I have been checking myself to the best of my ability each night and tonight was the first one. It was very small I thought it was a mole!! It came off extremely easily so I don't think it bit me. Ticks are one of the main reasons thru hikers have to leave the trail. Because of Lime disease. I think I'm in the clear from this one. But I need to be very careful. Of course all my photos of the beautiful new jungle environment I've entered into are too large. I'll do week 3 photo dump on FB when I have a good signal.","Gravel Springs Shelter

Pagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635546,"Its the first day of week 4  being on the Appalachian Trail!!! Got up at 6:15 I want to make sure I make it to the shelter about 12 miles before 2pm when it's supposed to start to rain. Then rain all night... Made oatmeal and coffee, tore down camp and got the heck out of here!!Still trying to decide if I want to set up my tent or not tonight. When you sleep in a shelter you don't set up a tent. Just lay there on your pad, in your sleeping bag. I haven't done that yet. But to keep my tent dry tonight might be the first. Although starting tomorrow it's supposed to start to warm up and be in the 70s Tuesday and Wednesday!! 
Woke up to pee a few times and I kept looking around to see if anyone else had snown up. Just me still this morinng. Nice and peaceful. 
I've got my rain coat ready and my pack packs rain cover easily available just in case it stats to rain earlier than expected.. 
No service last night. We'll actually I had service for about 10 min then it vanished, came back and vanished again. On the trail at 8:15 48 degrees. Since I don't have service I bet some of you are wondering how I know the temp. I have a small Compass, thermometer, whistle, magnifying glass combo on my pack. One of the things I grabbed from dad when he left the trail. 
Made it to the first shelter (2 miles) at 8:50. Didn't stop. There's another shelter another 5 miles ahead. 
OMG it's a beautiful morning. Sun is out, birds are chirping, Perfect temp. I even already rolled up my sleeves.
I just passed the second person that is hiking with bells on. Their intent is to keep bears away. When I've passed both I've started to since "" I hear those sleigh bells ringaling ding ding ding dingaling ding"" haha. (then Xmas songs get stuck in my head for the next mile.)
Just got service when I reached a summit. And there just happens to be a little bench here!! So I updated yesterday's journal and sat here for about 20 min. The weather liar now say rain will be happening around 4-5 not 2-3. Maybe I can get a little further today.
I saw a puffy jacket hung on a tree. I bet that hiker is going to be pissed when they get to camp and realize it's gone. I've seen a few items like that but I can't take it with me and maybe catch the person because I don't know if they were headed north or south... 
Made it to the shelter that was 7.5 miles from where I camped around 11:45. Met to day hikers here Andrew and Carly. They were very nice and interesting in what I was doing. The sweetest thing. Before they left to hike back to their car they asked if they could say a prayer for me and my journey.. Gave me goosebumps. As I was about to leave the shelter 2 guys and a 5 yr old (Oliver) came hiking in to stay for the night.. Guy said mom and sister are getting pedicures while dad/friend/son do a hiking trip. Left the shelter at 12:15. About 4.5 miles to the next shelter that I might stay at. 
Made it basically to the shelter about 2p. There is a good stream near it so I filled up all my water because where I decided to stay doesn't have water and I need about 1.5 liters to make dinner, hot tea, breakfast, coffee. I passed a group 16 older folks earlier today then I passed a group of 20 boyscouts both were headed the opposite direction of me. I ended up chatting with one of the leaders of the boy scouts. He said they were just hiking like a mile up to grab some bear bags then going to turn around and go back... To the shelter I was going to stay at. Sooo.. Nope. Not staying there. 1 more mile there are some camp sites, and it's on grass which will be better for the rain tonight. Supposed to start around 5pm. 1.5 hrs. Right as I was passing the trail down to the shelter there were 2 other hikers headed there. I told them about the scouts. They went ahead and went down, also said they had heard there was trail magic down at the shelter. What!!! So I left my pack up top and hiked with them about two tenths of a mile down to the shelter (didn't wanna hike back up with all my water weight. I went from about 1lb of water to 7lbs.). Down there I found Andrew and Derek. They were just down for the evening to cook for the thru hikers. I told them about the boyscouts also. They weren't cooking for them.. Ha. Said they were cooking burgers, had cokes, beer, mandarin oranges!!!  I grabbed 2 oranges. They weren't staying the night. They walk by basically where I'm camped on the way to the parking lot where they are parked at. So they said if they have extra, if they saw me they'd give me one. I'm still going to make dinner and eat as usual just in case they don't have extra or even stop. 
Made it to the camp site around 3pm, set up and I'm just awaiting the rain... 4:10 I feel my first drops. 
Andrew and Derek found me on the way to their car around 7. They said there ended up just one couple and 2 groups of 20 boyscouts. Said I was correct in not staying at that shelter. They still had a coke and a few chocolate cream pies left and they took my trash, it's the little things. Ha. 
Started to rain harder around 5:30. It's a steady rain but not a down pour by any means. Hopefully it will stay this way and not pick up too much. So far I'm dry.","Mosby Camp

I don't hear any rain.. It definitely rained all night but never was like a crazy downpour. Just a steady rain. The inside of my tent only got a little wet, basically where the rain fly was hitting the mesh from the wind, causing some drops to fall. Hopefully I can get to camp and set my tent out to dry/air out. Currently 45 degrees and super duper foggy.
I'm so happy that so many people have been following my journey on the trail thru my trail Journal. As of this morning there have been over 10,000 views! Incredible! And all the positive comments, posts, txt, emails, messages I've received from friends and family have truly been a blessing. Wouldn't it be crazy if my journal got up to 100,000 views by the time this is over. Now thats not 10,000 different people reading my journal.. Everytime you click on the website it adds a view. So some people have probably clicked on it 30 or so times looking for updates. But still. Pretty Incredible! I'm bless and honored to have a fantastic following on my journey.
One thing I didn't really think I about was this morning my shoes were dry. But after tearing down my tent and walking in the grass to do so, my shoes are soaked. Oops. 
On the trail at. 9:30 still super foggy. I can probably see about 100 yards. Not too late of a start. Shooting for a little over 16 miles today. It's cold, still 45 degrees and windy. In about 4 miles there's a good water source which will be my first stop. I'm hiking out with about 60% of 1 liter of water and a coke. Haha, I'll drink that coke with dinner, after I let it set for like an hour so it doesn't explode all over me.
Passed one of the groups of boyscouts about 1 mile out of where I camped.
Made it to the stream at 10:45. I started out the day with my rain coat on Because walking under the trees im still getting rained on. Also it was windy and chilly. Took my rain coat off at the stream also up to 50 degrees and the sun is starting to pop out. Didn't fill my water yet. There's a shelter 3.5 miles ahead which has a good water source. I think I'll stop there for lunch and refill my water then. Maybe be able to dry off my rain fly while I'm there.
Made it to the shelter at noon. Not quite as fast this morning because everything is super muddy and slick. Some of the up hills were nearly impossible without my trekking poles, same with the down hills. Sun went away of course but did come out for about 30 min. There's not really a good place to hang my rain fly to dry but I do have it laid out. Anything will help. I have about 9.5 more miles to go this afternoon. Leaving the shelter at 1pm. Took a longer lunch than I anticipated. Hopefully be to my camp site by 5pm. I had good service at the shelter so replied to some emails, did a few things online, and called and made a reservation for my next stop in Harper's Ferry.. I should be in town by noon on Tuesday. Tomorrow I'll go thru a little bit of West Virginia. 
I passed the 1,000 mile marker today for people who started in Georgia at Springer. Where I plan to end my flip flop. 
Got to camp at 6pm. Yes... Later than I predicted and later than I would have liked. Let me tell you why. So.... About 200 yards past the shelter I stopped at for lunch there was a sign ""Hiker Warning, Entering the Rollercoaster enjoy the ride"" if you ever see this sign in the middle of the woods. TURN AROUND!! wholy crap! So remember me talking about how when I got to the top of Priest mountain I was excited for the 4.5 mile down hill which actually ended up being horrible because it was 100% rocks and just a hard hike. Well that was a cake walk compared to my last 9.5 miles. Look it up Appalachian Trail Rollercoaster Northern Virginia. I don't have the specs for it but it sucked. After already hiking 7.5 miles in the morning I start this. So many up hills, down hills, turn left, turn right, walk thru a stream for 1/4 of a mile.. All while stepping basically only on uneven rocks. There was 1 flat part... I walked across a road and thru a parking lot. That was the only easy part. Took me alot longer than I had planned to do those last miles. Everything from my waist down is soooo sore. My toes, my heels, my feet in general, my calfs, my thighs.. Everything. Nothing is in pain, but it's all mad at me. Oh and the best part. I still have about 5.5 more miles of it first thing in the morinng. 
I did get to camp when it was still daylight so I was able to set up my tent, let it dry out as well as my rain fly. So there's a positive. Ha. I'm making 2 dinners tonight and 2 candy bars. Oh and I have my coke from last night that I didn't drink (which is currently chilling in the stream near me with a rock on top of it getting cold). I'm exhausted and starving. When I get to town I'm going to have some extra food so I want to eat as much of it as I can before I get there. I'll also be getting my second resupply box from dad on Tuesday. 
A thru hiker that started at Springer Georgia passed me on this roller-coaster. I figured I'd give it a shot and try to keep up with him. That lasted about 1/2 mile (maybe). Kids name is ""Young Chef"" no he doesn't work in restaurants (that's what I assumed). He got the name because he's a vegan and packs out really weird stuff to eat but makes apparently really cool meals out of it. Said he packs out a bunch of vegetables, which you don't hear of often. He did mention avocados so I definitely am going to pick up a few of those in town. Just sound good!
I failed. I can't eat that much.. Ha. I only had 1 dinner. Didn't start to cook the second one either. I did have 2 candy bars though. Hehe
As I'm changing into my sleep clothes I keep checking myself for ticks. Just found my second one!!! This one like the first was very small and very easy to brush off and get out of the tent. Pretty sure if they are easy to remove like that, they haven't bite you. Today I didn't even unzip my pants into shorts honestly because I'm scared of ticks since I found one on me a few days ago.

Pagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635682,"Got up at 6:30, 39 degrees and it feels like it. Went and grabbed my bear bag and made breakfast (oatmeal, surprise surprise.. But I did something crazy, I used 3 bags of oatmeal today instead of 2) and coffee. It's really nice on these colder mornings to have the warmth of this stuff in my belly. Idk how amazing it will be mid July, but I'll cross that bridge when I get there. So I apparently still have about 5.5 miles of this dang roller-coaster.. I'm sure you can imagine my excitement. Ha. But. Today is right around 17 miles. That sets me up to do about 3.5 miles into Harper's Ferry Tuesday morning and I am going to take my first zero there on Wednesday. Harper's Ferry is the unofficial 1/2 way point on the trail. Alot of flip flopers usually start there. The ATC is there which I'll go in there and well.. I'm not really sure. Ha. I've heard it's a museum.. Also heard they will take my picture. But I've also heard that the ATC is not recognizing any thru hikes this year. So I don't really know what to expect there. I guess I'll let you know. I have a resupply box waiting on me and only have a few other errands to do. Oh... Shower like 4 times and eat so much I pass out from a food coma. I'll also do my Week3 PhotoDump on Facebook while I'm on wifi and laying in a bed.Going to try to make it about 9 miles before I stop for lunch. After this Rollercoaster the terrain seems to level out some. Finally. I will stop before for some more water. But I think I'll wait till I'm almost out of this Rollercoaster. There's a water source in about 4.5 miles. 
On the trail at 8:30, 45 degrees. Supposed to be up to 55 by noon. 
Bahahahha, I passed a kiosk that had some random info and a few jokes. The best one I thought was. 
""I made a hiking Playlist. I call it my trail mix. It has alot of Eminem"" haha.. 
10:45 made it the 4.5 miles to the spring. Chugged the last of my water and filled up my liter (added some pink Starburst flavoring. Yummmmy). Had another thru hiker pass me. He's in the same group as Young Chef. This kids name is Babushka. I didn't get a chance to ask him how he got it. He was literly running thru these rocks!!! I can't wait till I get those kind of trail legs. Ha. Went ahead and turned my pants into shorts. I figure this way at least if I do get a tick I can periodically look down at my legs to check. Passed into West Virginia about a mile ago also!! 
Hurray!!! 11:20 I found the sign at the other end saying Hiker Warning!!! I'm done with the roller-coaster!!!! The rest of my day just got a little better!! Oh also when I woke up today my legs/feet felt fine. That was a relief. The rocky terrain continued for about 2 miles but the crazy ups and down have definitely stopped. 
12:15 made it to the camp site, 8.5 miles so far today. Going to hang out here for 20 min then push on. I still have 8.5 miles to go till camp
Made it to the next shelter, 2pm. Stopped there to get my water for the evening. I still have about 5 miles to go but there's only 1 water source in between here and there and it's not a sure thing. So I'll just carry it I guess. This shelter is sweet. There's a shelter with a porch and a nice wooden bench. Theres also a cooking pavilion which a chair swing!! Every tent site has its own fire pit and bench! But... The spring is 1/4 mile downhill, which means what..? It's 1/4 mile back uphill also. This is the biggest most elaborate shelter area I've came across thus far (David Lesser Memorial Shelter). When I stopped at the campsite I only had a mandarin orange (the second one I got from Andrew and Derek). I'm going to finish my lunch on this chair swing. I'm not too worried about time. It's only 5 miles to where I'm camping and it's pretty darn flat. I should be there in 2 hours once I leave here. I'm only going to add two tenths of a mile to my mileage for that water hike instead of 1/2 mile. Mainly because I didn't hike down there with my backpack. Also tonight my journal is going to say that I passed 300 miles. Which correct I have hiked that far (with all the small side trips). I'll reach 300 Miles on the Appalachian Trail about 5 miles past Harper's Ferry so that won't be till Thursday morning. Ok, it's now 3pm, 61 degrees and the sun is out, slight breeze. I've been swinging on this chair for about 30 min just enjoying the peacefulness. I don't wanna get up but I've gotta push on... Maybe 5 more minutes.. Hehe
Walked with another kid from the group I mentioned earlier. This one's name is Hoilday. He's on Vaca. Just finished school and hasn't started his real job yet. So I mentioned the 4 State challenge a few days ago. Well apparently it's in a few miles ahead. It starts like 2 miles south of Harper's Ferry. The group of kids (ok young men) are camping at the state line and going to wake up at midnight and try to do it. It's 44 miles, 4 states, 24 hours. I had mentioned before that I was going to try to do it in 2 days, 22 miles a day. But.... If I were to do that then on Thursday morning when I wake up in a hotel bed I'd have to get moving at like 5-6 am.  And honestly I wanna get some breakfast somewhere, get another latte then head out at like 11-12 ish.. So... I might attempt to knock it out in 2 days still (doubtful) I'd end up doing like 10-15 the first day and still have 30-35 left the second day. I don't think I can physically do that. I've been making it up to 17 mile days and by Saturday I want to try for 20s (Saturday starts week 5). It's not that my legs can't handle it. My shoulders start to get sore around 10-12 ish. My feet start to get sore closer to 15 miles (depending on the rock situation...) I think after hiking Thursday and Friday I can get myself to the 20s. One thing I need to do is stop taking 2 hours to wake up and start hiking. Lol. I just dilly dally around. I can easily cut 30-45 off that by just moving. Ha. 
Anywho found out one of the other young men in this groups name is Dcap. Short for decapitation. He's always hitting his head apparently.
Made it to my camp site at 4:45. There's a mother/daughter doing a section hike basically to where I started. Daleville.. That will be 300 miles. They started in Harper's Ferry. So today is their day 1 and they knocked out 3 miles.

Pagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635769,"Woke up at 5:30. Thought that was too early, I mean the barista hasn't even clocked in yet. Haha. Fell back asleep till 6:10. Got up tore down quietly since the girls are still sleeping pretty close to me. Got everything ready to go by 7. I didn't eat breakfast or make coffee this morning because well  I'm going to pay someone to do that today. It's a beautiful morning. I actually the first morning in a long time that I didn't wear my puffy jacket or beanie. Sun is out, it was a beautiful sunrise. 46 degrees, birds are chirping, it's really green at this campsite so it just looks.. Freaking perfect.On the trail at 7:10. I have 3.3 miles till I get off the trail and where I'm staying is like two tenths of a miles from there. The exit point for the trail from Harper's Ferry is actually 4.3 miles from my camp. So Thursday morning I'll still have 1 mile till I leave Harper's Ferry area. I also looked to see where my 300 mile mark will be. And.. I'm pretty excited. You'll see soon enough. Walked thru the Harper's Ferry National Historic Park this morning it was beautiful. I could see the sun rising the whole way over my right shoulder. Great hike this am. 
Well I made it to town and was able to check into my hotel at 8:30!! Room was ready. When I made the reservation I said I'd be there around 11 and would love an early check in. Well I was super early! Ha. 
Basically dropped off my backpack in the room and headed out for breakfast. On my journey to breakfast I walked by the ATC HQ. It was closed. I'll call later to see if they have hours or something. Also walked by the post office where dad had sent my resupply. Picked that up then carried it all morning, ha. Found a little cafe on the river (Battle Ground Cafe) and got my latte and a bagel breakfast sandwich. It was delicious.. I inhaled it. Stopped by the Outfitters. I got my fuel and I was looking for a ""butt pad"". Basically it's a small foam pad that folds up pretty small.. I want one for when I sit on these random rocks/ground. Just for a little Cushion. It was going to be multi purpose. I haven't mentioned this but. I'm a side sleeper. Every night I wake up and have to turn sides because my hips are hurting. I think when I lay on my side most of my weight must land on my hip, so then my hip almost hits the ground, or maybe it does. So I plan to put the pad under where my hips are hitting. Hopefully that will help. They didn't have one but the shop owner (Harper's Ferry Outfitters) went in the back and came back with a big peice of thin foam. So I cut off a chunk and I might try that till I find my Cushion, super nice of her. What I'm looking for is called a Thermarest Z seat. It only weighs 2oz. So it won't be alot of extra weight but will hopefully help with my sleep and overall comfort. When I was buying my fuel the store got a phone call. A hiker wanted to purchase fuel over the phone and have it delivered to the same hotel I'm staying at. So I offered to take it since I was headed there anyways. 
Back at the hotel I asked front desk about the guy who's fuel I had. He wasn't registered there. So I called the other hotel in town.. Wasn't registered there either. Crap.... So I called the outfitter and apparently he's not in town yet, he plans on getting In after the outfitter closes so that's why he wanted it delivered. Ah, it all makes since now. 
Finally took a shower and did my laundry. I also went thru my pack and had a small pile of things I'm sending back to my dad that I haven't used and won't use for awhile/ever. I plan to send back about 1.5-2lbs worth of stuff. 
Left the hotel again and headed back to the post office to mail stuff back to dad. Walked into downtown (where I had breakfast, about 1 mile from hotel). I've been craving a Fried Chicken Ceaser Salad, add bacon bits. This morning I saw a menu that had one (Almost Heaven Bar and Grill). So went there for lunch and got my salad (they've got nothing on my salad from Montanas in South Padre Island). But it did hit the spot. I'm going to get a milk shake next door and head to this tiny tiny general store I saw to see if I can get the rest of my resupply there vs having to call a taxi/uber/shuttle to drive me to Walmart (5 miles away). Currently 84 degrees and sunny. It's an amazingly perfect day for a milk shake (strawberry). 
Bahahahha so I walked over to the general store. It's literally a museum. I did not do a resupply there. Ha. I walked in and was like.. Ummmm, OK. Haha. There's a bus that goes from Harper's Ferry to Walmart. I'll take that tomorrow and do my resupply.. All I have left to do today is relax and find dinner. Oh I did call the ATC, it's closed until further notice. 
Random but I still have no idea where that puff of insulation came from. I've inspected my puffy coat and sleeping bag. I don't see any holes. Weird. 
Everything closes so early here! The restaurant that was open the latest is the Rabbit Hole. They close at 7. So I walked down there (back downtown) about 6:30 got a bacon cheese burger. I'll probably eat 1/2 now and take the rest back to the hotel room to eat later in tonight. 
Also side note. Sprint service is no bueno in this town. 
Today was my Nero. 3.3 miles. Got up to 85 degrees here today. Fantastic day. All I have to do tomorrow is make it over to Walmart and lay in bed. *****Goodnight Tom*****","Campsite 1021.8

Ended up just staring at the ceiling till 7 so I went ahead and got up. There's a bus that runs from Harpers Ferry to Walmart and back (many other stops also). I walked downtown to get another latte and breakfast bagel sandwich. Got downtown by 7:45 (bus was supposed to drive by at 8:55). Once I got downtown... NOTHING was open!!! The coffee shops don't even open till 9!! I sat outside the place I got breakfast at yesterday and saw the workers walk in at 8:30. I asked the girl who made my latte yesterday if she could make me another by 8:50. She was happy to help. I explained I'd been waiting for an hour and the bus was supposed to be there before they opened. She was sweet.Made it to Walmart and back to the hotel by 10am. All my errands are finally done. So the rest of my Zero will just be laying in bed relaxing for the most part. I'm pretty excited!
Since I already walked downtown (1 mile there, where 95% of the restaurants are) today and I'm supposed to be taking a zero. Side note, I was dropped off by the shuttle at the hotel which was nice so I didn't have to walk back from downtown. I'm ordering delivery. I'm just going to get enough food for lunch/dinner combo. It should be here about 2:30.
I got everything pretty much packed back up and ready to go for tomorrow. 
Nobad Dayz just txt me and said he made it to the hotel I'm at. We are going to meet up a little later. 
Went to dinner with nobad dayz. It was great to catch up and talk about the trail. It's really cool how you just randomly make friends on the trail. We had a great conversation. I showed him the little bit I'd learned about the town while being here. I'm really excited to get back on the trail tomorrow. I hope to leave the hotel around 9, the trail actually goes from the hotel to downtown (basically). I plan to hike that 1 mile of the trail then walk back into downtown only like one tenth of a mile, get one more coffee and a breakfast bagel then be back on the trail by 11 at the latest. Today was a good relaxing day.","Harper's Ferry Quality Inn

Went down to the breakfast area at the hotel chugged 3 OJ, got some coffee and some fruit loops!Showered again (4th shower while in town) and finished getting everything all packed up. Left the hotel at 9:45. Took 1 mile of the trail from the hotel to downtown to get my coffee. Made it downtown by 10:15 and as I'm walking up to the coffee shop, what do I see?? My friends Bob and Pam!!!!!!!!!! They were waiting at the coffee shop for me. Wonderful couple. When I was in South Texas I worked with them at the KOA campgrounds. I've known them for about 4 years. They were working at the KOA here in Harper's Ferry.. They do quality inspections. We had a great coffee/breakfast chat. It was so good to see some people that I actually really do know not just a trail friend. They walked with me to the foot bridge leading out of Harper's Ferry and I was back on the trail by 11:15. Again I can't say how great it was to see familiar faces!!! There's a chance when I get to Maine they will be in the area and we might meet up again. That will just depend on timing. 
While we were sitting there drinking our coffee's it started to drizzle and well... Basically drizzled on me all day!  It never down poured so I never did put on my rain coat (partly because it was in the mid 70s all day and pretty humid). I did put my pack cover on and left that on all day till I got to Camp. When I arrived at camp everything in my pack was nice and dry. 
I did a thing today. I made it 300 miles on the Appalachian Trail!!!! My 300 mile mark was right at a cliff overlook. So I took off my pack and went and found a bunch of sticks to make my little 300 for a photo and as I'm walking back down to the cliff I fell. This is the second time I'm fallen, the first time was with in the first few days of being on the trail and honestly it was pretty graceful.. This one was not. I fell pretty hard.  Like I said it was drizzling pretty much all day and so the rocks were super slippery. My foot just slipped out from under me and I landed on my arm and scraped it up a little bit. No on going pain or anything. It could have been worse. (I manage to save the twigs!!!). 
After that I was headed to the next shelter to fill up water and have lunch. But at 3pm I came to a parking lot for a state park. There were restrooms, water, electrical outlet so I ended up staying there for about 30 minutes. Lunch was 2 Mandarin oranges, a pack of gushes and a cliff bar. Delicious!! As I was sitting there eating my lunch 3 ladies walked up to where I was and I recognized 2 of them. I had passed them earlier in the day (they were headed south which really confused me, ha).. They had hiked down to Harper's Ferry and gotten in one of their cars and came to the state park parking lot to meet their friend.. They are doing some sections of the trail and said they were going to be driving north and then hiking south again, so there's a good chance I'll meet them again at some point. Very nice ladies we chatted for awhile. Met a kid who had started in Georgia on Feb 11th. I passed right by him and haven't seen him since. His name was Tenacious. Also at the cliff overlook there was a group of 4. 2 parents and 2 kids (kids in their 20s). They had just started today in Harper's Ferry and were going to attempt a North Bound Flip Flop. I also met a girl who's name was Dorothy, she had a little dog named Toto... Haha. She seemed pretty lost and disoriented. I hung out with her for about 15 minutes and got her on the right track. It was an odd situation. 
Oh!!! I apparently made it to my Third State today!!! I didn't see any signage for it but... I'm in Maryland!! 
Made it to camp at 6pm. Got my tent set up (barley sprinkling right now). So that's all set up and I'll be dry tonight. Today was yet another great day on the trail. Yes I had to hike in the rain which was actually the first time (I know, hard to believe) but it wasn't too bad, again it wasn't a downpour. Of course it rained the hardest on my during my last 2 miles to camp. Got to camp and it basically stopped. Go figure.

Pagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635971,"Last night was the first night I actually slept on top of my sleeping bag and just covered up with my sleeping bag liner. Felt great, till about 2am. Then I had to get inside my bag, it got a little chilly.Woke up this morning at 6:15, 52 degrees and pretty windy out! Supposed to be winds 25-35mph with some gusts over 40 mph!! Wow. Got everything all packed up and went to make breakfast. Back to the usual, oatmeal and coffee.
Last night when I got into my tent I checked my self for tick again and no ticks!! Whoot. However after laying there for about 30 min I felt something on my arm. A freaking tick! Idk where he came from.. The only thing I can guess is maybe it came from my backpack or my clothes? But he was still crawling around and was again easy to remove and get out of the tent. Someone made a comment in my guest book to go to sleep with a Ziplock and if I feel something put it in there vs getting out of my sleeping bag and putting it outside my tent. Well. I did go to sleep with a Ziplock, I just forgot I had it when I was ""in the moment"".
I had a friend Sandy recommend getting some lemon grass oil, it's supposed to be a tick deterrent. So I did get some in town and put some on this morning before leaving camp..even if it doesn't work. It makes me smell petty darn good. On the trail at 8am.
Made it 3.5 miles by 9:10 to another state park parking lot with water, restrooms, power. Up to 57 degrees. Stopped here for about 15 min then pushed on. Im trying to do just under 20 miles today with the goal of being to camp by 5. We shall see.
Made it 9.5 miles by 11:30 to the Annapolis cliff overlook. I confirmed with a local that I'm looking out into Maryland. Stopping here for lunch. I'm making good time so I'll stay here 30-45 minutes. It's a beautiful overlook but wow it's windy on this cliff. I could hear the wind all morning but because I'm in the forest it doesn't hit me very much. Wow it's actually pretty darn cold on this cliff!!! Back on the trail at noon. Tenacious just walked by to go to the cliffs. He said he actually stayed at the camp just past the shelter I stayed at last night. At the cliff I met 2 nice ladies who were very enthusiastic for me and my journey. One of them gave me a bag of trail mix. 10.5 miles to go before camp.
So about mile 12 the trail turned to all rocks again. This lasted for about 3 miles. Not only was is all rocks but I was on the west side of whatever mountain and that's where the wind was coming from. It was so strong it actually made me loose my balance a few times. I used my trekking poles to help balance me so no falls. But man that wind is strong today. It's definitely much winder than it was this morning. This afternoon was actually kind of dangerous. With all the crazy wind branches were falling all over the place. I heard well over 2 dozen fall. I literly saw at least 5 fall with in 50 yards of me. No branches hit me or fell on me but I did get hit with plenty of leaves!! Ha. 
I ended up stopping about 2 pm for about 15 minutes after all the rocks to let my feet rest a bit. 
Whoa... Made it to camp finally at about 5:15. The water source at camp is four tenths of a mile down a hill so I opted to go ahead and carry my water in. There was a good source about a mile from camp. So for my last mile of the day I had all my water bottles full, it was uphill, and it started to rain. Perfect ending to a long and honestly pretty dang hard day. 
There's a family (well I'm sure there are many out here on the trail) named the Suttons. They have a YouTube channel (I've never seen) but I've heard about them from like everyone!! They started in Springer Georgia mom, dad and.... A 4 year old!! He had a birthday on the trail so now he's 5. They are at the shelter I'm staying at. It's kinda like meeting someone famous!! Ha. Super nice couple. And ""lil man"" the 5  year old is still running around playing with other people that are here not even phased by the miles they did today and it sounds like he's like that every night until he just passes out. Ha. I think I mentioned them before, when I was at Preist mountain I stopped at the shelter. In the log book was a log from them. It said something along the lines of "" forgive me father for I have sinned, I keep blaming my tent farts on my 5 yr old"". Haha.
Well dang. Every picture I took today is too big for this website. So I'll post this with a picture not from today. (Pic is from yesterday at my 300 mile mark) 
Currently 49 degrees and supposed to get down to 41 tonight..

Last night I was exhausted, I was asleep by 8pm and I didn't even wake up today until 6:40!! I'm late!! It's 39 degrees but feels like 32 with the wind chill. It's still windy this morning but not as windy as it was yesterday. Hopefully it dies down over the course of the day. Weather app says it's going to only be 10mph today and up to 55 by noon.
I do have 2 considerably big hills to climb today. I'm still shooting for 21 miles but if I end up stopping a little early that's ok. I'll have plenty of time to make those few miles up in the next 1900. Ha.
Leaving camp with my under Armour, puffy, and my gloves on. I don't think the gloves will last too long but they can easily fit in my pocket. The under armour will more than likley come off at my first stop which I think will be about 5.5 miles. I did ask the Suttons this morning how many miles they are doing a day and they said between 13-16. So I doubt I'll see them again. Even with getting up about 30 minutes later than usual. I'm on the trail at 8:20.
Ok 9 am gloves, beanie, puffy just came off. Lol. They didn't last very long. 
Under armour made it till 9:30.
Made it my first stop at 10:10, 5.5 miles. It's another state park (Pen Mar) with restrooms, water, and electric. So I'm charging my phone for a bit. I've got a charger but I still have a few days till I'm able to charge that, so I'm trying to use power elsewhere in the mean time. Phone was down to 48%.
Walked over to the restroom and there were banana sitting next to a sign. Trail magic. I definitely grabbed one. I think (I have no idea for sure) it was the Suttons, last night had a bunch of bananas and this morning they were talking about being picked up at this park to do a resupply so there's a good chance they are the ones that left them. 
I passed by 2 of the people who were at my shelter last night. Doe and Bushwacker. They are out doing a 40 mile section. Very nice couple. Also this morning as I was leaving camp I talked to Sundial. She's out here for the weekend with her 2 kids (guessing 13-16ish). They have never hiked before and did 4 miles yesterday and planning on doing about the same today. She was very nice. I was the most antisocial I've ever been last night, so I didn't get peoples names or story's (besides the Suttons). I was just starving and exhausted. 
Ended up staying at this park till 11:10. But my phone is fully charged! And... I'm off.
Made it 13 miles (from where I camped) to another park area by 1:45. I planned on stopping for Lunch at the next shelter which is only another mile but... This is a park with a restroom, and well just a nicer place to stop. Sitting in the sun on a picnic table. This is nice. I still have about 7.5 miles to go today to reach my goal. I'm guessing that will take me about 3 hours, maybe 3.5 hours. I've already completed one of the 2 hills for the day but the next one is the big one. It's going to be about 1100ft in about 1 mile. So it shouldn't be too terribly steep, I'm guessing it won't be as hard as I'm getting myself psyched up for but it starts just after the next shelter. The first hill I went up today wasn't too bad at all. But again, it was smaller.
Oh I got a little turned around this morning after I left the shelter area. So there was a bunch a graffiti all over the rocks so I was looking at all that. When I looked up I saw some white on a tree so just kept going that way (on the Appalachian Trail there are ""blazes"" painted on trees/rocks to guide the way. They are always white and always 2x6) well after walking only about a tenth of mile I realized that these were not AT blazes (the were miss shapped and had paint running down the tree). They were put there by I'm guessing the same Ahole who did all the graffiti. Lame. But. Only cost me about 10 min or less. But I think that's the first time I've accidentally gotten off trail.
I did a thing. State 4!!! Pennsylvania in inside you. 
At the top of the last hill was an over look named Chimney rock, that's where I found out I was in Pennsylvania. 
I passed another guy 2 days ago and he's apparently been at the same shelter as me twice. I've just never seen him at camp because he's a pretty slow hiker but still does 20ish miles a day. So he gets into camp late and wakes up and leaves camp early. His name is Papa Bear and he's got a super cool dog named Care Bear. He started in Georgia and his dog has been with him the whole time. The first time I passed him his dog actually started to follow me. We had a good conversation for about 10 min before Papa Bear finally called him back. Lol
Made it to camp at 5:30 (which was three tenths of a mile down hill, can't wait for that uphill first thing in the morning). I'm starving so the very first thing I did was get my dinner going. Well dinner #1. Ramien and tuna. As that was going and I started to put up my tent the Gnats are the worse they have been in a long time. So while Dinner #1 was cooling I actually made my first fire!!!! (and I got it going with only one flick of my lighter!) Gnats buzzed right off. I'm just going to keep it going for a little bit while I'm out here eating and relaxing before I head into my tent.
Started dinner #2. Ramien and tuna... Lol. Also today I had 3 packs of oatmeal and my coffee for breakfast. For lunch I had 2 gronola bars, 2 mandarins oranges, and a pack of gushers, which I'm pretty dissapointed with you gushers.. The first pack I had was filled with different colors/flavors. The next 2 packs have only been red... I'm also going to have 2 candy bars for dessert after dinner #2, needless to say my appetite has definitely caught up with me. I'm pretty much always hungry now.
I did wake up feeling good this morning after having such a hard day yesterday. Today when I got to camp I wasn't nearly as worn out as I was yesterday, so that's a good thing. Ended my day at 21.2 miles. I think a big part of yesterday was the rocks and the wind. Don't get me wrong, there were plenty of rocks today but just easier to hike on? Idk if that makes since but it's the truth. 
LOL, I have small tan lines from the wrist straps on my trekking poles. 
Trivia... Who doesn't love trivia. Me, I do not.. I never know the answer. Anywho let's play. 
The number one reason why I stop hiking for a few moments on the trail is? (now adays not week 1 or 2)
A. To comb my beautiful beard (yes I have a beard comb with me)
B. Blow my nose
C. Take a drink of water
D. Catch my breath
I'll give the correct answer tomorrow.

This morning is the frist time since I've been on trail that I actually took some tylonal. Tore down camp and then made breakfast.. 3 oatmeal and coffee. Some good news tho. About 3 miles down the trail I come to a road. Less than 1/2 a mile down the road is a burger/ice cream shop!!!! Hopefully I have service on the road or before so I can look up if they are open or not before I walk down there to check. Today I just have right about 18.5 miles to hike. There are 2 camp sites very close together. I'm going to see if hopefully one of them faces west so I can see the sunset. I haven't seen a really good sunset in a few days. Wow the Gnats are definitely back!! Ha. No fire this morning tho. Today is supposed to get up to around 84 degrees!!! Should be a beautiful day. But, I need to make sure I drink more water than I have been since I'll be sweating alot more today. I already filled one of my water bottles with a hydrating/ electrolyte mix. I think that should help.After I cross this road in about 3 miles I have my 1 hill of consequence for the day, another 1100 ft climb. Uuug. Although they are getting easier and easier. 
Today is also the first day I'm starting my hike in my shorts. It's already pretty warm. My thermometer says 64. 
Well crap. I just looked closer at my app and it says that this burger place doesn't open till noon on Sundays. I'll be there by 9:30ish.. I don't think I'll wait around. Darn. 
On the trail at 8:20. I kinda took my time getting to it this morning because well I'm not freezing and it's a beautiful morning. Also I still have my headache and... I have three tenths of a mile up hill to leave camp ha.
Made it 3.5 miles to another state park area. Went ahead and stopped for about 30 minutes. Charged my phone, chugged a liter of water, cleaned my little towel I use to clean my cook pot after each use, washed my face and cleaned my water filter. I was about to leave the park and ended up talking to a lady Kim for about 20 min. So I spend about an hour here!! Oops. 10:55, I'm outta here, currently 73 degrees. 
Made it up the hill. About 1/2 way up was a shelter. Quarry GAP Shelter. Wholy crap this is an amazing beautiful shelter and grounds. I took a bunch of pics. They guy who maintains this shelter apparently lives 30 min away and has a cabin very close to here. He's in his 70s and every weekend he comes up here to his shelter to maintain it! Wow. Flower pots, games, sundial, little yard figurines. Just a really nice shelter. I spent about 15 min here just looking around and filling up my water. 
It's 1:45, 83 degrees. I just made it to a little cabin that's privately owned but since no one is here I'm sitting on the front porch in the shade. It's Hot! I've drank about 4 liters of water so far today and I'm about to drink at least 1 more before I leave here. I'm having lunch here. I made the mistake of moving too slow this morning. At this point I still have about 8 miles to go in this hot sun. I spent about 30 min just outside of where I camped when I got cell service updating my journal and replying to people/emails. Mistake. I spent almost an hour at the state park after only doing 3.5 miles. Mistake. Then about 15 minutes at that well kept shelter. So I've ""wasted"" almost 2 hours of the cooler part of the day on chilling and not hiking. I should have stopped and had a longer lunch time in the shade instead of stopping when it's cooler. Lesson learned. I really shouldn't say that it was a mistake to stop earlier when I did. I just should have thought about it more and tried to do more miles earlier when it was cooler. I still plan to be at camp before 6pm.
Ate and cooled down, outta here at 2:30. Next water is about 4 miles ahead. That'll be my next stop. 
4pm made it to the next water source. Chugged some more water and splashed some on my face and hair. It's cold and feels amazing. Just before the stream I passed the 2020 half way point from Georgia to Maine. Just after the stream I passed the 2018 half way point. Every year the trail chances just a bit so there's always a new half way point. Unfortunately this is not my half way point. Lol. Actually I need to look that up to see where that will be for me!! !! 
My camp site is 3.5 miles away. I think I'm going to have two dinners again tonight (yeah I brought alot of food, ha). One thing I've noticed since being in Pennsylvania is there are alot more pine trees than I've seen in my previous miles. Ok rested for about 15 minutes at the stream, time to push on. 
Ok so earlier I mentioned that there were 2 camp sites near each other that I was going to stay at. Well I passed the first one and continued down hill to the second one because it was right next to a stream and I needed to fill my water bottles for dinner and breakfast anyways. Got down there, filled up my waters and walked around for about 15 minutes looking for some sort of anywhere to set up my tent. There's no where!!! Grrrr... So I went ahead and walked three tenths of a mile back up hill to the one I had just past. I'm super not thrilled at this point. And of course I step over a rock and into a hole and fall. No scrapes or anything just my pride was hurt a little. Talk about adding insult to injury.. Lol. Got back to the original camp and of course the Gnats are horrible again so I made another small camp fire. It's amazing how they buzz right off once there's some smoke in the air. Oh and neither of these campsites have a view of sunset. Boo. I did make 2 dinner again. Ramien and tuna x2. Right before Harper's Ferry I tried to do 2 ramien at once... That was a mess. They don't fit in my pot. 
I am by far the dirtiest I've been on this hike thus far and I don't get to shower till..... Thursday! Oh well. I've only seen 2 cute girls out here on trail and I'd bet they were pretty dirty also, ha. 
I never did see a sign for the 2019 half way point nor have I seen one for 2021. I did pass the 1,100 mile mark for people who started in Georgia!! 
Oh so Papa Bear and Care Bear did make it to the shelter last night, he said he hoped to be there around 7. I saw him walk by to get water around 7:15. But, I didn't see him this morning nor did I pass him on the trail anywhere today. Idk where he is? 
Trivia Answer.... The correct answer is B. Blow my nose. I'd say I stop approximately once a mile to blow my nose. I mentioned in an earlier post that I couldn't stay at a hostel because it was pet friendly and I could feel my allergies kicking in within 10 minutes of being there. Well here's the kicker. I'm allergic to everything on the trail also... Haha. Trees, dust, pollen, mold, grass, pine needles.. Not the dirt tho, me and dirt are A-OK. Lol. 
I have a special treat for myself tomorrow, I'm pretty excited. I'll tell you about it once it happens. Actually the next 2 days are going to be pretty exciting... But you will have to wait to see... Oooooo I just learned that there might be a second treat tomorrow.
Maybe TMI..... but today I think because it was so hot and I was soo sweaty I ended up getting some chaffing in a not so pleasant area. I felt it a little later in the afternoon but this evening when I was changing into my sleep clothes I saw it! Wow, not so cool, it's actually kinda bad... Hopefully it heals pretty quickly and I can remedy that since, well It's only going to get hotter and hotter as the months pass on. Not tomorrow tho, high of 64 and I should get rained on most of the late morning thru the night.","Rocky Mountain Shelter

Pagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636263,"Pretty significant day today. I started the trail on April 3. So today I've officially been on the trail for 1 month!! Crazy!!! Woke up at 6:30 and it was already starting to sprinkle!!! Last night my cell service was off and on, it was so werid but I did get a chance to check the weather and indicated it wouldn't start to rain till closer to 9am. Liars. I didn't make breakfast today I just got up, packed everything up and headed out. I was on the trail by 7:15. I had 5 miles till my first stop. Pine Grove Furnace State Park. This was my second treat I was taking about, my app said there were FREE HOT SHOWERS!!!! I didn't notice that till right before I went to bed. Other wise I wasn't going to shower till Thursday! Made it the 5 miles by 8:50. I was hustling! Got to where the showers were and there was a sign on the shower door saying that they weren't open yet!! I went ahead and tried the water and nothing.  Boo. There was a worker outside so I asked him about the showers and he said these showers weren't open for the season yet but there were showers in the camp grounds. Backtracking about 1/4 of a mile... So I did it. I was at the showers by 9:10. No soap or anything but I was able to rinse off, what I thought was a good tan... It was actually just dirt. Lol. Side note - my chaffing area actually healed up pretty darn good over night. I put some ""mom's stuff and antibiotic ointment"" on there last night and after my shower I put more of the ""Moms stuff"" on. (look that stuff up, it's pretty amazing). Showered and made breakfast/coffee there. I was outta there by 10:20. 9 miles to my next treat!!!! I was making pretty good time, hoping to be there by 2:30. Ended up catching up to tenacious. Now when I first met him just outside of Harper's Ferry I said I blew by him. That's true, but what I didn't realize was he was hiking slow waiting on his 3 friends to catch up from Harper's. I've seen tenacious pretty much every day since. Once I caught up to him today we stayed together till we caught up to his friends (they do exist, haha) Pippen, Zoomie, and Halo. 2 girls and Halo is a guy. Hiked with them till we got to the road that lead to the ""treat"". There is a general store that has all sorts of resupply snacks/food but they also have a grill!!!!! So we started down the road to Green Mountain General Store. About two tenths of a mile down the road I realized that yes, we could walk this road to the general store but it was seven tenths of a mile. Basically you could hike down the road to the store then catch the trail again just past the store. Missing about a 1/2 mile of the actual trail. So I turned around and went back to the trail, hiked it till I was just north of the store then hiked south to the store. This way I didn't skip any of the trail. They all thought I was crazy. But as I mentioned before apparently I'm called a purest. I don't want to skip and of the trail. I feel like if I do that I'll end up regretting it. So I did end up catching them at the store but they left before me. They are headed to Boiling Springs. I'm stopping a few miles south of there. I'll get to Boiling Springs about 9am tomorrow. Where my next ""surprise"" will be waiting!! Also I ended up making it to the store by 1:20!!! An hour earlier than I had expected! That was a nine mile stretch. Today I've been making great time. Once I leave this store I'll have about 7 more miles till I get to the shelter I'm staying at tonight. Before I met up with tenacious and his friends I passed the ""Official 1/2 way point of the trail"". At the store I got a cheese burger and curly frys. Ate that there and I also got a ham/turkey/bacon cold sub. I'm going to hike that out and eat that for dinner tonight! No Ramien tonight, Whoot!!!I plan to leave this store around 3pm. Since I still have 30 minutes I'm going to do my week 4 photo dump onto Facebook so look for that tonight!!! Ok Photo Dump Posted and I'm outta here 3:10. 99% chance of rain starting at 6pm. I hope to be arriving at the shelter right about then. 
Made it to the shelter at 5:45. Started raining on me about 20 minutes before I made it to the shelter. I was making fantastic time until about 3 miles from the shelter there was a strech of about 1.5 miles of boulders. Literly having to climb up and over them. Everyone has said that Pennsylvania is full of boulders. Well I got my first taste of them today. Usually on big Rocky sections I can use my trekking poles to help myself up and down the rocks. Not today. There were about 4 times where I would have to put my poles on top of the rock and literally climb up the rocks! I was able to use them each time to get down but wow. Actually rock climbing!! Ha. Before the rocky section I passed by Janice and Julie. These are the ladies I saw heading south just north of Harper's Ferry. I stopped later in the day at a park and was charging my phone, having lunch and I saw them again. I was so confused. They were meeting their friend at the park. They hiked to Harper's then drove north. They said they might see me again and low and behold! There they were. Super nice ladies. I believe Julie said her trail name was Kenner. But I'm not 100% sure on that. Julie if your reading this correct me if im wrong in the guest book!!! 
I've met alot of people out here on the trail and given many of them my journal page. If I've met you in the trail, please sign the guest book. I'd love to hear from you and know that you actually found me!! 
At the shelter I saw Sugar man again. I met him for the first time at the Waynesboro Stanimals Hostel. Super nice guy. He got him name partly because he tried to hike the entire Smokey Mountain section eating only snickers (and some instant coffee) he said he does not recommend that. Lol. 9.5 lbs of snickers!!! I think he said that section was about 75 miles long, he brought 75 snickers!!! Haha, crazy. 
Here's another thing about the trail most of you probably don't know. So there's a thing called ""slack packing"". I don't think I've brought this up before, maybe I have. Anywho. Slack packing is a pretty common thing. Basically instead of hiking a day with your full gear you get a day pack (usually a hostel provides this service) so you hike the day with only minimum weight. You can do more miles quicker that way. Alot of people do it in really hard sections. I mentioned earlier that I'm called a purest, I don't think the definition includes not slack packing but I will never slack pack. I have nothing against anyone else who chooses to slack pack. We each hike our own hike out here. But I won't do that. I will walk every darn mile of this trail with my full pack. I might regret it at times but that's just how I'm hiking my hike. 
Since it was raining when I got to camp I set my tent up in record time!! 
Ive seen alot of people eat in their tents, I've only done that once. But since it's raining and I set my tent up down by the stream (about two tenths of a mile from the shelter) and it's raining pretty hard I'm going to go ahead and not cook ramien but eat my sub in my tent. Shhhh don't tell anyone. I still have to go back out at some point and either put my food in the bear box or hang it. The rain is supposed to let up a bit around 8. Then a thunder storm around 9, die back down then storm again avout midnight. Rumor has it it won't be raining in the morning. I dont have cell service here so I'm just taking others word for it. 
Today I did end up back tracking twice which I haven't really had to do, and I got drizzled on most of the day. But all in all today was a really good day. I was able to keep a great pace all day. Do 20 miles and be to camp before 6pm. All while stopping for about 3 hours total, once to shower/breakfast and once at the general store for lunch/posting. 
I'm excited to share my surprise with everyone tomorrow. It's going to be a great day. Also tomorrow I'm going to hit my 400 mile mark!! Whoot!
It's definitely raining harder now than it ever has since I've been on trail. Yuck.","Campsite 1100.2

Pagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636324,"Today is going to be an awesome day. Woke up at 5:45. My tents rain cover is still soaking wet. At some point during the night the rain did finally stop. My tents lower area is covered in mud splatter. Got all packed up except for my tent, as I was folding my tent over to start to roll it up a freaking branch (small, maybe 2 ft) came crashing down from above and landed on my tent. I heard something crack so I stepped back just in time. Even if I hadn't stepped back it wouldn't have hit me. But wow if I hadn't gotten up early (blame that on the Carmel latte in my really near future) I would have still been in my tent and that would have scared the crap out of me!! Was out of camp and on the trail by 6:30. Last night with the rain basically everything in my tent is damp. There wasnt a leak or anything just damp from the water in the air. Except my shoes and socks are dry. 
As I left camp I had a little over 4 miles to town. About 2 miles into my hike I came to a big ol field. Ended up taking the trail thru this grassy field for over a mile. By the time I got thru there my socks and shoes were actually the wetest they have been since I've been on trail. 
Made it to town at 8:15. There's a Cafe just off the trail so I headed there and got my Carmel latte, went back outside and at this point the sun was out so I went across the street and laid out my tent, rain cover, footprint, pack cover to dry out in the sun while I waited on my surprise to arrive. At 9:15 my surprise arrived...... 
My dad is back in the trail!!!!!!!! I have my hiking partner back!!!!! The plan is for him to hike with my right around 100 miles then he's going to release me into the wild again. I'm so excited to have him back on trail. So that's the big surprise I've been talking about for the past few days. But another treat is he brought me my resupply. We have been emailing/texting every day so ce he left trail but the past week I keep adding to his list of things to bring me... So my resupply was more than just food this time. I did leave town with 7 days worth of food. Should last me the whole time he's with me. We plan to part ways in Port Clinton, and I'll have another resupply box waiting for me there. 
As well as getting my dad back today he also brought me a package from my cousins Brandy and Brittany. They included some candy (yes Skittles) as well as an essential oils spray that has all the bug be gone stuff mixed into it. I'm pretty excited to try that out. Smells amazing. 
Dad also brought. Another big trash bag, I have one in my pack that I put everything into to help water proof my pack, my current one had about 20 holes. My second pair of shoes (exact same as my first set just a different color), a short pair of socks, a duel usb wall charger so when I do find power on the trail I can charge more than one thing at a time. Some wireless ear buds that I had ordered and sent to him. A pair of running shorts with the liner in them, those should help with my chaffing. (which has pretty much cleared up since I've been waring my sleep shorts to hike in the past few days). A set of insoles for my shoes. A lighter weight under Armour shirt. The one I had was cold gear (to keep me warm) this one is heat gear (to keep me cooler) and it also weighs less. My light weight rain coat. A butt pad!!! Not the thermarest Z seat because it seems to be out of stock in the entire world. This one is REI brand and inflatable. A new water container because the new Katadyn one I got a few weeks ago already had a tiny tiny hole in it, this new one still fits the filter but is a little more durable. Ummmmmmm. I think that's all. So yeah I added some weight. But... I'm sending back with him... My cold gear under Armour (heavier than the new one), my heavier rain coat, 1 pair of tall socks, my pants (I still have my long underwear just in case it does get cold again, I mean when it gets cold again. Lol) my gloves, my old shoes... I think that's it. So I got some new stuff but I still lost some of my pack weight. When dad gets back home I'll try to narrow down my new pack weight and post that. After all that we were finally on the trail at 11:30. 
One of the first things dad mentioned is that the smells are alot different than when we were together 5 weeks Ago. Spring is in the air. It smells wonderful. Smells like lilac often. We got about 4 miles down the trail and started to hear tons of gun fire. Turns out we walked right by a gun range. I was nervous!! 
At 1:30, 6 miles past town I reached my 400 mile mark!!! Whoot!! Around 1,800 to go!! 
We passed a guy named Arizona, you'll never guess where's he's from.. Lol. He started in Harper's Ferry and is headed north. 
At 3pm it was 82 degrees and today was one of my least favorite hiking days. I really enjoy hiking thru the woods. I mean we are on a trail right. Well today I hiked thru that grassy field in the morning then this afternoon we went thru more fields. I'd guess at least 4 miles total today for me was thru these fields, and of course I found a tick in me. Found it right away and flicked him off (I didn't put any essential oil stuff on today I was too excited to see dad and my mind was elsewhere). 
We also did a good amount of road hiking which I hate hiking on the pavement. That was only maybe 1/2 a mile total, but still. 
We made it to the shelter at 6:15. Today with dad we hiked 14.3 miles. This morinng to get to Boiling Springs (where we met) I hiked 4.2 miles. 
When we arrived at the shelter we met buttercup, a pet name her husband of 55 years gave her. Copper, her real name is Penny and her hair is reddish/copper ish. Sound Scape. So I was really curious about his name... So apparently this guy is out here thru hiking but while doing that he's capturing sound clips at least every hour. He's got a friend who is doing the GPS positions and they are going to make a sound file of the entire trail, background noises... He explained it much better but it was really interesting!!
Supposed to start raining again tonight around 11 and pretty much rain till around 2pm tomorrow. Currently 73 degrees but should drop to about 63 once the rain starts. 
Oh I also saw 2 more snakes today. Another Garder snake and the other one might have been a copped head I'm not 100% sure. Both slithered off quickly as I approached. 
Thanks again Brandy and Brittany for the treats and notes. And of course, welcome back Pagne Senior.","Alec Kennedy Shelter

Pagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636403,"Woke up at 6. It had started to sprinkle.. I don't think it rained last night but I'm not really sure. I don't remember waking up and hearing it at all. (learned it did rain from about 10:30-11:30pm). Was out of my tent and all packed up except for my tent by 6:30. Took my gear to the shelter and went back to get my tent packed up as quickly as possible. Back to the shelter to have breakfast and coffee in the dry area.Still raining, on the trail at 7:45.
Wholy crap did it rain on us this morning. Today is the longest and hardest it's rained on my since I've started the trail. Of course had to walk thru another field but at that point didn't really care about my socks and shoes getting wet since they were already soaked. However there were a number of times (too many to count) where we were literly hiking thru a steam that on a dry day would have been a dry trail. Didn't matter if it was downhill or uphill, water was flowing and there was no way around it. After about 10 minutes of dealing with that we both just kinda got over trying to step around it and just walked thru the ""trail stream"". I wanted to take a picture of what we were dealing with but I also wanted to use my phone the rest of the trail, so I decided to keep it dry in my pack and not get it out. 
Finally made it 7.5 miles to the first shelter at 10:50. Sat there for about 30 minutes, tried to dry off just a bit and eat a little lunch. Outta the shelter and back on the trail at 11:20. Of course this shelter was about 1/4 of downhill, so of course that means when we left the shelter we had to go.... 1/4 mile up hill. 
Made it 3.5 miles to Duncannon at 12:40  where we are staying at a hostel, Kind of Outdoorsy. It's actually a small hiker resupply store that added about 10 bunks in the back last year. Not too shabby. When we got to the Hostel my friends were there and just about to leave. Tenacious, Pippin, Zoomy and Halo. Apparently across the street is a breakfast place and there's a pancake eating challenge. The goal is to eat 8 pancakes. Halo is apparently the pancake king!!! Well done sir! 
Had lunch at the Doyal (hotel and restaurant). Voted best burgers on the trail 2019.  Heard this from many people. I gotta say. I could have made it a double burger but it was darn good! For what ever reason I really enjoyed the bun. Ha, random I know.
Headed back to the hostel to get our dirty and now wet clothes together, there's a laundromat next door. Since we are at a hostel they have clothes we can borrow so I don't have to wear my rain pants this time. Even ended up putting our shoes in the dryer for a little bit to help them dry out. Oh and it stopped raining basically as we made it to town.
Took my shower, dried out or tents and got everything cleaned up from the rain. We went and had pizza for dinner. Relaxing evening at the hostel. Copper and Sound Scape are also here for the night.
We are ready to get back at it in the morning, shooting for around 16 miles tomorrow.

Finally got up and went to breakfast with Pagne Senior, Sound Scape, Copper and Buttercup. Buttercup made it to town last night but did not stay at Outdoorsy, she stayed at the Doyal. Got back to the hostel, I took another shower (can't seem to get ride of my stink.. Lol).
On the trail at 9:30. Our first 2 miles are thru town walking on the sidewalk. 
Finally made it to the woods at 10:20. Would have been there a little earlier but we had to stand there and wait for a train to pass before we could enter the woods. 
Made it 11.5 miles to a shelter at 3pm. We planned to stop and eat some lunch and fill up our water here. The camp site we are staying at tonight does not have water so we have to carry it there (about 5 miles away). While we were at the shelter we met a guy named CzechNeck. Got that name because he's a red neck from Czech Republic.. (his words not mine) Haha. He's been in the states since he was 12, so he said he's as American as Apple pie with a slice of cheese. Sound Scape showed up there to rest for a bit also. He's headed to the same camp site we are tonight. There was also a other couple who showed up at the shelter. Soooo nice. Their trail name was Praise Team. They got their name while in Glasgow at the Stanimals Hostel dad and I stayed at. Charlie the care taker there gave them that name because they are so up beat and optimistic. Just a extremely nice couple. It was a pleasure talking to them. At the shelter there was a sign that the spring was two tenths of a mile - 300 steps. Which didn't make since because two tenths of a mile is way more than walking 300 steps. We went to go get water and they weren't talking about foot steps. They were talking about freaking stairs (my arch nemesis)!!!! It took us about 30 min to get down there, get water, and climb back up. Wow... That sucked. Ha. 
Side note about Praise Team.. They have been on trail for 54 days. They started 20 miles south of where I did! I'm on day 34... They say the reason they are going so slow is because of their pack weights. They are married and share a tent. But she carries 45lbs, he carries 55lbs worth of gear/food/water. That's crazy!! With food and water my pack weight is about 35lbs or less. I couldn't believe it when she said it, then I took a closer look at their packs and both are bigger than mine and stuffed full!!! 4pm back on the trail. 
Made it to the camp site at 6pm. Set up and started dinner. As we were eating Sound Scape showed up and joined us. There was another guy names Kip here. Didn't talk to him much. 
It's supposed to start raining tomorrow around 1pm and rain pretty much the rest of the day/night. We plan to hike about 11 miles tomorrow to get to the next shelter before 1pm and basically just hang out there for the afternoon/evening while it rains.","Duncannon Kind of Outdoorsy Hostel

Pagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636596,"Woke up 6:15. Got up and went to go get my bear bag that was hanging in a tree down the trail. Figured I'd come back and slowly start to pack up all my stuff and get it in my backpack. Then think about tearing down my tent. But when I got out of my tent dad was already up, bag packed and starting to tear down his tent!! So I put it into a higher gear so I could try to catch up to his progress. Finally got everything packed up by the time dad was just finishing breakfast. As I was getting my breakfast made he was just kinda sitting there waiting on me. So I mentioned, why don't you go ahead and go, I'll catch up. All I thought I had to do was finish my coffee and hit the trail. So dad did, he left camp around 7:35. I figured it would take me about 10 min to get myself on trail. Well.... Kip woke up and it was just me and him at camp. So we chatter for a bit. He started in Harper's Ferry and is doing a thru hike flip flop. Then the Praise Team (Ken and Ally) walked by so I stopped what I was doing and talked to them for a few min. Then Papa Bear and Care Bear hiked past. Before I knew it Kip was all packed up and actually got on trail a few minutes before me!! I didn't leave camp till 8am!! I did not mean to give dad a 25 min lead!!!It was kinda fun hiking this morning because I knew I was going to be trying to catch up and pass everyone. First I passed Papa Bear and Care Bear (she's an Australian Sheppard I think he said, beautiful dog). Next I passed Kip. Then finally I passed the Praise Team. Passed all them by 8:30. I knew dad was going to be the hard one to catch up to. On the flat sections I just bearly hike faster than him. But I know I go faster on the downhills and uphill. It was fun playing catch up for the first hour then I just started to wonder if I would ever catch up to dad!!! 
Finally at 9:40 I caught up do dad! He was zooming!! 
At 10:45 we had already hiked 8.2 miles! We were moving quickly. But this is because we are trying to make it to the shelter and get set up before it starts to rain. Between camp and the shelter we only stopped once to take off our packs for about 10 minutes. We refilled our water and let our shoulders rest for a bit. 
Finally at 12:45 we made it to the shelter 13.1 miles we did this morning! We were cruising right along. Got to the shelter and Critter and Jazzy were already here inside the shelter hunkered down for the day to wait out the rain. Critter said he did a thru hike in 2015 and now he just gets out and does sections as often as possible, with his dog Jazzy. We got out tents up our tents, filled up with water and started to make some early dinner/late lunch food. Today for lunch I had the my first mountain home camping dinner, Beef stroganoff. It was extremely delicious!!!! While we were getting lunch ready Sound Scape showed up and put his tent near us. We all finished eating and around 2:30 it started to sprinkle. By 2:45 all three of us were in out tents to wait out the rain. Hopeing to emerge form our tents once the rain stops for a bit. We shall see. 
Today is the first time since I've been on trail that I'm actually going to try to take a nap. 
Retreated into my tent around 2:45, from 3-4 I actually laid here and watched part of a movie. One thing I haven't really talked about is on my phone I have quite a few movies downloaded. (I have 750GB of space on my phone so I have plenty of room). In the early days of the hike every night I would watch 30-45 minutes of a movie before falling asleep. As my hike has progressed I haven't been watching part of a movie every night but I'd say closer to every other or once every three nights. Earlier when I was stopping and getting to camp at 3-4pm I'd have extra time before it was dark. Lately I've been hiking till around 5:30-6pm so I haven't really needed anything to help fill the time between dinner and dark. When I get in to town and on wifi I'll delete the ones I've watched and download a few more. I've only bought a few movies since beginning the trail. I bought all the Rambo movies in a bundle pack. Once I've seen all the movies I have available to me I'll start buying more movies. That should take me at least another month or so. 
At 4pm I decided to try to take a nap and wow, I was asleep till around 7. Now that I'm back awake it's time to start thinking about dinner. Since it's raining I'm going to go ahead and cook dinner in my little vestibule/porch area. I don't usually like to cook/eat in or near my tent but when it's raining I'll make an exception. (like the other night when I packed out that sub and ate it in my tent during the rain). Started dinner at 8pm mashed potatoes with a salmon pack and a cup of hot tea. I was having hot tea almost every night for the first few weeks but as it's gotten warmer I really haven't made it very often. But with the rain it's a little chilly tonight. 
Dinner done and cleaned up by 9pm. The rest of the evening will just be finishing the movie I started earlier (Rambo 3) and passing back out.

Today it's not supposed to start raining till 4-5ish. So we have plenty of time to get to camp and set up before the rain.
Before leaving the shelter I walked around for a bit and Praise Team made it to the shelter so did Czech Neck and Kip. 
Papa Bear and Care Bear came to the shelter to eat last night then they continued on. 
I figured I'd catch up to Pagne Senior within 30 min today instead of the hour and 40 minutes it took me yesterday.. But..... 
So about a mile down the trail there was a flooded area with a dry route detour. I missed the detour and ended up in the flooded area, so I had to back track about two tenths of a mile back to the detour. The detour began on a long strait dirt road. I could see Pagne Senior wayyyyy up there so I knew I'd catch him soon. Detour turned right and then was a pretty decent uphill.. Once I made the turn and saw the hill I knew I could catch Pagne Senior. I could see pretty far up the hill I was climbing and I caught a glimpse of his backpack. Again, I knew I'd catch him soon. At the end of the detour the road kept going but the trail cut to the left. I cut left and headed up the hill, more uphill and didn't see dad. Kept going, didn't see dad. At this point I thought I should have caught him (and remembered that the road kept going, maybe he missed the turn) so I turned my phone off airplane mode and had a txt from Pagne Senior saying he was off trail but would keep checking his GPS and get back on trail soon. The next txt from him (I thought said he was at a stream) so I txt back that I'm about 1/2 mile from the stream. OK, so he's ahead of me so I hurried up to catch him. Then I get another txt saying there's a campsite just past the stream. I was reading the txt quickly so that I didn't stop for too long so I would catch him. He said basically for me to wait at the camp site not the stream. I thought he was saying he was passing the campsite. So I'm flying trying to catch him. Get to the campsite, he's not there. So I keep going, again trying to catch him. I get to a stream crossing and it looked like you literly had to walk thru the water (and correct that's where the trail went) but if you looked to the left there was a short trail to some logs that I was able to cross in and not get my feet wet. (I learned later that Pagne Senior did not look left and find the logs to cross at) So I'm still flying down the trail, trying to catch him. This went on for about 30 min then I get another txt from him asking if I took my shoes off to cross the stream.... Wait... What.... Crap, he's behind me!!??!!?? So finally after figuring out that I've been running away from him vs towards him I stopped for about 30 min till he caught me. I miss read his txt, he miss read mine. I missed the detour, he got off trail twice. So finally at 11:20 I saw Pagne Senior after 3 hours of being so confused. I just kept thinking how the heck have I not caught up to him. Lol. Wow. Eventful morning. The rest of the day was pretty easy. 
We got to about 3 miles from where we were going to camp and it started to rain so we stopped, put in our rain coats and pack covers. 10 min later it stopped raining. Ha. Of course. 
Finally made it to camp at 3pm, filled up our water bottles and set up our tents. 
Sound Scape made it to the same Campsite we did but we just missed each other. The shelter was on the right side of the trail and the tent sites/water were on the left. So we went left first, Sound Scape went right first. He had already set up his tent before he came to get water and saw us setting up. 
We all had dinner together in the shelter because it was sprinkling a little. 
We are all in our tents about 6pm tonight. It's supposed to keep raining off and on for awhile and it's cold! There's a frost warning for tonight. So we have to sleep with our water filters to keep them warm. They can't freeze or they are useless (rumor has it, and we aren't going to chance it). 
Tomorrow we are planning to do right around 10 miles and it's supposed to start to rain again around 11am and basically rain all afternoon/evening into the morning. 
Ended the day at 14.2 miles. Should have been 13.5 but I missed the detour then had to back track and then the detour it's self was 4 tenths of a mile longer than the actual trail.","Rausch Gap Shelter

Pagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636714,"First off Happy Mothers Day to all you mothers out there. Especially to my Mom. I love you so much. You are so sweet and kind hearted. You know just how to make a son feel loved. I have full faith you have been worried sick about me being out here in the woods!! I hope you have gotten at least a little bit of sleep over the last 6 weeks. I love you.Woke up at 5:45, 37 degrees! The high for today is around 50 degrees and the chance of rain is 100%. Last night the weather said it was going to start raining around 11. This morning it says around 12:00. I guess we will wait and see.
On trail 8:20. Alot of rocks today. But this morning was a beautiful morning, everything was still a little damp from last night. It was however pretty darn chilly. I kept my long underwear and my under armour on all day. We got to camp around 1:30 and it started to rain around 1:10. We should have made it to camp around 12:30. Somehow we completely missed the turn down to the camp site then got turned around and were headed back the way we came!??! I'm really not sure how or where this happened. We were both so confused. We had 1/2 a mile left. Then next time I looked because I thought it had been 1/2 a mile. It ended up saying it was 6 tenths of a mile ahead of us???? Needless to say we figured it out and made it down to camp. Not before it started raining. We got rained on for about 20 minutes. Our tents were at least dry from last night. But we did have to put them back up today when it was sprinkleing.
Ever since I've started using the essential oils I have had 0 ticks. So that's awesome!!! Thanks Sandy for the lemon grass referral.
Thanks Brandy for the essential oil mix. 
3:30 and it's stopped raining for the moment. I heard from Sound Scape and can actually hear from my tent that there's a waterfall down the trail just behind us. I made some mashed potatoes with a salmon pack and some hot tea and headed down the trail to see. It's 43 degrees out and well, rather chilly. So when Pange Senior and I got here we found a few sites and the trail kept going. I was in front and I could hear the water and had to bend over under some wet branches so I didn't continue we just came back to the few tent sites we had passed. This afternoon I walked all the way down. What a missed opportunity.. Wow. It's like a little paradise down here!!! My pictures won't do it justice. 
There's a damed pond that is this awesome blue/teal color. You can see the bottom of the water its so clear. There are 2 rope swings at different locations. There are 2 streams that feed into it, one of them ends in a little waterfall. The side where the dam is the middle is a little lower making a waterfall and there are some rocks build up on the waterfall side making the falls like pretty cool. There are 3 different camp sites down here each one with a rock made fire pit. Next time I'll continue down the trail to not miss an opportunity. In my defense it was raining, we had just made a big backtracking mistake on the trail. I just wanted to get set up quickly. 
One thing that I don't think anyone has asked me and I don't think I've talked about. If I were reading this, this would be one of my first questions. How do I know where I'm going and exactly how far everything is? I've mentioned there are white blazes to follow on the trail but when you can't find a blaze there's an App for that  ""Guthooks"". It's pretty amazing. This app has most trails you just have to buy the individual maps. The AT comes as a bundle of 10 smaller maps. Each section of the map has (most all of the....) towns, shelters, camp sites, water sources, peaks, view spots, parking, trailheads, privies. It gives a small description usually included is a photo or 2. And people an comment which is so helpful. Things like water flow is good, no water, ""whatever"" is closed, bee hive here... Anything. It also will real time GPS my location while my phone is in airplane mode! So I'm able to see exactly how far any waypoint is ahead or behind me. That's how I'm able to say ""I plan on stopping at the next shelter 5.4 miles away"" , ect... Just thought I'd share that tid bit of information. I also have a PDF of the AT Guide. Which is extremely similar just in a book form. So there's no ""you are here and looking this direction dot"" which is sooo helpful! I like the AT guide for more detailed town Information. That's really the only reason I even open that PDF. 
At 7:45 I started dinner, ramen and tuna. Ate that, hung my bear bag and now that it's dark and 9pm it's off to bed for me. 
We plan to do about 14.5 miles tomorrow to get to the next shelter. As of right now weather has changed to not raining in the morning so we should be able to get up and get on the trail pretty early (dry). High of 64 tomorrow which will be delightful since today was a high of 48.","William Penn Shelter

Pagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636767,"Woke up 6 and it was freezing cold. Phone said it was 43 degrees but feels like 37. I'd say the ""feels like"" was correct.. Ended up laying I my sleeping bag and since Pagne Senior has cell service also we txt back and forth a little bit about how neither of us wanted to get out of our sleeping bags. We ended up getting up and everything packed up around 7. Ate breakfast/coffee and were on the trail at 8:30, 45 degrees. And yes, today we were both on the trail as the same time so there weren't any mishaps. Ha. As we were eating breakfast Sound Scape walked by we chatted for a bit then he went down a random trail that neither Pagne Senior nor I would have ever thought was the actual trail. It was. Again, I'm not sure how we got so mixed up yesterday near the campsite but we would have been so confused again if he hadn't walked by and shown us where the actual trail is!! Wow.
Made it a few miles and everything was still pretty damp and muddy. We came up to a road and there was a big white SUV sitting there. It ended up being ""Mike"". Mike is a local shuttle guy who was waiting on a hiker at the moment, but he's also the one that tomorrow is going to pick Pagne Senior up and take him back to his car in Boiling Springs. We knew it was him because when I first met up with Pagne Senior last week while we were eating breakfast tenacious and pippen had called Mike to take them to a local outfitter for some new shoes. This guy's everywhere!! 
As we crossed the road where Mike was parked there was a little uphill and it was very wet and muddy, there were a few logs in place to help us thru the mess. Well my left foot slipped off and sunk in the muddy wet mess. Yuck. It was covered in mud. Oops. 
Caught up to Sound Scape around 10:30, 5 miles from our previous camp, he had stopped to make breakfast. 
Made it to the next Shelter 10 miles from previous camp at 12:15. Shelter ended up being three tenths of a mile off the trail, we decided to go anyways. We laid out or tent rain flys and footprints to dry since they were still pretty wet from the night before. I cleaned off my gaiter and left shoe from the mud. We ended up hanging out there till 1:15, then back on the trail. Up to 52 degrees. 
After leaving the shelter the trail narrowed for about 1/4 mile and was almost hard to see the bushes were so over grown. This was the narrowest I've seen the trail I think. It was hard to see what we were stepping on. All day today the trail was super rocky. Some spots had alot of smaller sharp rocks, some areas had big rocks where you couldn't even see the dirt In between them.
Finally made it to a Spring that was two tenths of a mile down hill. This wasn't actually just down hill. It was strait down hill!!! That wasn't fun. Up to 55 degrees. The weather liar was wrong again. Last night it said the high for today was like 64.... Nope. 
We made it to the camp site we were planning to stay at and there really wasn't alot of room, someone else had a tent there and we just really couldn't figure out a way to make our tents fit well. Port Clinton which is our destination for tomorrow is only 3 miles ahead so we went ahead and hiked into town. There's a hikers pavilion there we can camp at. On the way to town we knew there was going to be a downhill. For about 1/2 mile it was a pretty gradual downhill but the next 1/2 mile was extremely steep!! I seriously think this was the longest/steepest downhill I've encountered thus far. Needless to say both of us had sore knees when we reached the bottom finally. It ended right at a train station of sorts. Neat area. Walked to the pavilion, got there at 5:15. Since we are in a town (very small town) I spent the next 30 min calling everywhere trying to get someone to deliver us some darn food! What did I end up having for dinner..... Ramen and tuna. Haha. Oh well. There's a breakfast place right down the road we will go to in the morning. I have a resupply box waiting on my at the post office here but they don't open till 12:30!!! Crazy right. So between breakfast and 12:30 we are going to somehow get 2 miles down the road to a Walmart for a few extra things I need to pick up. There's a Starbucks right there also so I'll get a Carmel latte!! (maybe 2.....) and.... The grand finale.. We will enter ""The World's Largest Cabela's"".... Whoa!! It apparently has a pond in it and a restaurant! Look it up, it's in Hamburg PA. Then somehow make it back 2 miles to Port Clinton for my resupply box by 12:30. This is where the Pagnes will part ways till next time. Pagne Senior will get a ride from Mike back to his car and I will continue on about 8 miles to the Blue Rocks Campgrounds. I'm excited to get to the campground but I'm also not thrilled about the 1,000 foot incline I have coming out of town, its about a 2 mile stretch so it shouldn't been a super steep uphill, but still. I have a little cabin reserved for the evening so I can do laundry, shower and get all my electronics charged up for my next section which will be about 80 miles to Delaware Water Gap PA. Another resupply box is waiting on me there. 
Ended up being a very long day. The plan was to do about 14.5 miles. Then we added about a mile going to the shelter and back, then the spring and back. Then we went ahead and came all the way into town. Today was Pagne Seniors biggest mile day. 18.3 miles on the trail with over 1 mile of add ons! Well done Dad! Till next time. Journal says I reached 500 miles today. That's with all my additions. I will actually reach 500 miles early Wednesday morning!!","Hertline Campsite

Pagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636821,"Woke up at 5:10, 5:45, 6:15, 6:43. We had talked last night that we wanted to be walking to the breakfast place by 7 so I slept in a little too late, oops. Got up and started to pack everything up. Not making any breakfast this morning since we'll, I have none. This is the lightest on food I've ever came into a town. I usually have 1-2 days worth of food left over but not this round. Like I said my appetite has definitely increased and I've been eating alot more. All I had left over this section was some drink mixes, hot teas, coffee and sugar packs. Headed to breakfast at 7:10. Walked the 1/2 mile there and it's closed. Apparently they closed last year when Covid hit and haven't reopened. They should really update that online. So we walked to this place and it's 1/2 mile in the other direction of Hamburg where we are going to go to Walmart and Cabela's... So we started walking along the highway towards Hamburg with our thumbs out hoping someone would pick us up since there's no uber/lyft/taxi/shuttle in this area. We got about a mile and a guy stopped. His name was Steve and seems like he picks up alot of hikers. Said he was a shuttle service but online I didn't find him anywhere. Either way he took us to Walmart. I actually got his  number so he could pick us up and take us back to Port Clinton where the Post office is as well as the trail.
He dropped us as Walmart but we didn't go in. We walked down the street to Starbucks and I got my carmel latte then we walked to Cracker Barrel for breakfast. That was delicious!!! Cabela's was right across the street so we went there and checked that out. It's huge!!!!  They have a waterfall feature with a bunch of target practice animals/ taxidermied animals all set up (not for targets practice, just to look like nature).  Stayed there for about 15 minutes then headed to walmart. I did my resupply which this time included food, super glue (for the toe area of my shoes), and I also needed to get some bodywash/shampoo/towel/washcloth. The campgrounds that I'm headed to tonight doesn't have any of that so I'll pack it up there then leave the towels there. For this section of the hike I'm going to go back to carrying lunch items. I did that for the first 2 weeks but really wasn't eating that. Or I'd eat that and not eat any of my snacks. Well that's changed. So this time I'll be packout out more food than I have in the past. I also am packing out a footlong subway sub for dinner tonight since I'll be getting to the campgrounds after their shop has closed (5pm). I hope it all fits into my bear bag, Ha. 
Called Steve and he picked us up and brought us back to the Post Office. Got here around 11:15. Steve mentioned that he left his dog at the barber shop just down the street. Which reminded me that I've been thinking of cutting my hair. I need it. I was going to grow it out for the whole trail but.... Na, I'm good. So I walked over and got my hair cut. Amanda cut my hair and I ended up having her shape my beard a little bit I feel sooo much better. Got back to the post office at 11:50 for dad to tell me a guy came by and put a note on the door that he's not opening till 1. So I'm going to get an even later start out of town than I originally thought. Should be on the trail by 1:30 at the latest. I just have to organize the food that's in my resupply box and the trail is literly the next street over.  12:45 currently 61 degrees, it's a beautiful day. 
On the trail at 1:15. After saying farewell to my hiking partner Pagne Senior. Safe travels back home and I'll see you again hopefully for a other section. I probably just added about 12-15 lbs of food to my pack. I'm so excited to start eating it all!!!
Met another North Bound thru hiker at the post office as I was leaving. Batman was his trail name. 
So I was kinda nervous about this hill I had to go up first thing outta town. About 1,000 feet and 2 miles long. Even with all my extra weight. All the food from my resupply, towel, wash cloth, shampoo, bodywash, subway footlong, lol. I made it up like a beast!!! I was at the top with in 1 hour. So I still averaged 2mph. Which is a good pace for a day hiker with just a day pack on flat land. 
It was 7 miles to the trail head to the campground I'm staying at. I called yesterday to ask some questions (that's how I knew I needed my own towels, soap ect). I was told that their general store closed at 5pm. I brought the subway with me and when I made it to the top of the hill in good time I had a new goal. Make it to the campgrounds by 5pm so I can get a soda to go with my subway!!! Ha. So I was hustling down the trail. I only stopped a few times to blow my nose and take a chug of water. I ended up making it to the trail head and then 1 mile down their trail to the campgrounds by 3:50!!! Yep, I unleashed the beast. Haha. 
Supposed to get down to 39 tonight and the I saw online that you could request a little space heater for the cabins so I did. I'd already talked to the kid at the front desk so he knew I had hiked here but they require a $10 deposit for the heater. I told him I promise I won't take it, I'd have to carry it out with me!!! Haha. Still had to give $10 deposit. Lol. 
Checked in, got to my cabin and started to charge all my electronics first thing. Then got my laundry together and shower stuff. Went to the washer and put my clothes in, it had 36 minutes for the cycle so I went next door and took myself a fantastic 30 min long hot shower. I wanted to dry the towel I just got with my clothes so I can shower again in the morning!! (thinking ahead). Shower/laundry/a little exploring of the campgrounds and back to the cabin by 6:30. Now, all I have to do is rest, relax and eat my footlong with a soda. Check out is at noon tomorrow. I think I'll leave before then.... But maybe not.  We shall see. 
Ps, turns out the camp store doesn't close till 7pm, not 5pm. So I didn't have to hustle as much as I did to get here for that soda. Oh well, more time to relax. 
So what does my resupply consist of... Well
Breakfast. I have instant coffee, with sugar packets. I've been looking for the Breakfast Essentials Carnation mix to add to my coffee or just add water after my coffee and finally found some today. Oatmeal packs or grits packs (for a variety). 
Lunch. I have flour tortillas with cheese blocks and a mix of chicken salad, tuna salad, spam I'll make wraps with. 
Dinner. Instant mashed potatoes with salmon packs or ramen with either tuna or chicken packs. 
Snacks. Candy.. Alot of candy and a variety of protein/energy bars so theres something kind of healthy in my snacks. 
Extra. Hot tea packs for at night when it's cooler and flavor packs to add to my water. 
That's all... Haha. 
I couldn't make it all fit in my huge odor proof Ziplock at the post office, I was also in a hurry. So tonight I'll get it all in there hopefully and still be able to make that bag fit that in my bear bag. Wish me luck.","Port Clinton Pavillion

Pagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636939,"Made it to day 40!!!Woke up at 7:45, I slept in and I slept great!! The little space heater was wonderful since I got down to below 40 degrees last night. I did sleep with my ear plugs in because the heater was kinda loud and I didn't want it to keep me up, or wake me up. And... It didn't. I was nice and toasty. 
Finally got myself up and moving. First thing I did was go to get a cup of coffee at the camp store around 8:15. Not open. Boo. So I went ahead and took another nice long hot shower. Amazing! The soaps I brought with me smell amazing and were really sudsy on the washcloth. This hasn't been the case usually when I shower at a hostel/hotel. (oh how I miss my loofah). It's the little things. Haha. 
All cleaned up and the store still isn't open. So I explored the campgrounds a little more. There are quite a few older cars here. I mean nice olde cars that someone has restored. Once the camp store finally opened and I was waiting on my coffee to brew I asked the lady there about them. Apparently there are 2 brothers that own this campgrounds and they both are into older cars. Pretty neat. 
My next resupply/town will be Delaware Water Gap which is about 70 miles north. I have a resupply box waiting on me there and a compactor bag (thanks to my friend Sundial!!!) but the post office closes at 11am Saturday morning and doesn't reopen till Monday at 8am. So I can either do 20+ miles the next 3 days and still have a few miles left Saturday morning to hopefully make it in time. Or I can not rush myself and get there on Sunday to get my package first thing Monday morning. Yep, that's what I'm going to do. There's a hostel that's in a church right next door to the post office so I'll sleep there, shower, maybe laundry then Monday morning get my package and hit the trail again.
I'm excited about my hike today. There are a few view fantastic points and one of them is supposed to be the best view on the AT in Pennsylvania!! Also I'm going to hit 500 trail miles today!! What I'm not looking forward to is the 1 mile trail from the campgrounds back to the AT. It is not well maintained. First off it's basically uphill the whole way but there are at least 15 blown down trees on the path. Yesterday I had to actually crawl under 2 of them, there just wasn't a good way for me to go around them or over them. So my first mile today isn't going to be awesome. But thats OK, every mile can't be flat and easy. Ha. 
I got some wireless ear buds and today is the first day I'm going to do some hiking while listening to music. I've never done his but I see tons of people hiking with headphones. I'm just going to put one of them in and listen to it pretty low because I do really enjoy hearing all the nature around me. Since well, thats why I'm out here for and living in!
Leaving the campgrounds at 11:30, currently 55 degrees and sunny. Supposed to get up to 66 today. 
Made it 1 the mile to the actual AT at noon. 
Pinnacle overlook was about 3 miles away, I arrived there at 1:20, said to be the best view on the AT in Pennsylvania, also my 500 mile mark! Stayed here for a little while. Had lunch and back on the trail at 2:10. There were some locals there that I chatted with. Nice group. They pointed out a rattle snake to me. It was tucked in between 2 rocks under leaves. I could barely see a small part of it so I didn't take a pic, or mess with it. Ha
Back on the trail my right knee started to really bother me about 8 miles into the day. I mean my knees have hurt a little after the crazy downhills a few times but not like it was hurting today. It was honestly pretty flat from mile 4-8. I had planned on hiking about 15 miles total today to the next shelter but with my knee hurting, basically hurting on every step I choose not to and let it rest. I came across a stream with some camp sites and decided to cut my day short and just stay there at 4:30. Once I got here I started to look at my knee closer and there is a bruise on the left side of my right knee and it's a little swollen. Glad I stopped. I laid in my tent for about an hour watching a movie Pagne Senior had told me about (I downloaded it while at the campgrounds ""without remorse"") got up and walked around a bit jsut to work my knee a little bit and it's still sore but not in every step like it was. Had dinner, hung my huge/heavy bear bag and was back in my tent by 8pm. Going to finish this movie and fall asleep. Goal is right around 20 miles tomorrow. There are campsites at mile 18, 19, 20, 21 so I'll have some options tomorrow night. 
Oh, I'm not sure I'm a fan of listening to music while I hike. Idk, It wasn't amazing. Ha.","Blue Rocks Campgrounds

Pagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636976,"Woke up at 6. Got up and moving at 6:15. First thing I did was head over to where I had hung my bear bag to get that. As I'm walking down the trail I saw a Porcupine!! We scared the crap out of each other. I didn't have my phone with me to take a pic so I went ahead and got my bear bag down. Took that back to my tent, grabbed my phone and wow, he was still there! Got a few pics.This morning was the first time I tried the carnation breakfast essentials in my coffee. The pack said to add 1 cup of milk to the pack. My coffee cup holds 2 cups of water. So I added the whole pack in with my instant coffee. Wow. It tasted like hot chocolate! Ha. I couldn't even taste the coffee but I know I put it in there! Tomrrow I think I'll just add about 1/4 of the pack to my coffee just for some flavor. Then once coffee is done I'll put the rest in the cup with some water. Give that a go. 
I'm glad I stopped yesterday when I did with my knee hurting because the next 2 miles is basically a 1,000 foot uphill. This morning my knee still has the bruise in it and it's still pretty swollen but there's no pain. So thats good I think. 
As I'm putting on my shoes this morning I also put on my gaiters. Mine have an elastic band that goes from one side of my shoe, under my shoe, and to the other side. To help keep it secure.. Well on my right foot that finally snapped off. I ended up duck taping it. We will see if it holds. I really didn't have any issues with my gaiters till I hit these darn Pennsylvania rocks! 
I packed out an orange from town. One thing that I've learned is that when you put a bunch of open and empty tuna/salmon packs into my trash (a ziplock) they freaking smell. Pagne Senior and I got an orange from Czech Neck I put the peel into my trash and every time I opened my trash it smelled like orange vs tuna! So I ate my orange and my trash smells much less like tuna. Win, win! 
On trail at 8am. 50 degrees and it's a Beautiful morning the birds are chirping and the suns out. 
Made it 2.4 miles to first lookout Dan's Pulpit at 8:55. The hill really wasn't too bad. It wasn't too steep of an uphill and I only stopped once to roll up my sleeves. So far my knee feels pretty good. 
Continued on 2.2 miles to balance rock overlook 10 am, I have cell service so I posted journal. It's 61 degrees, sun is so warm I even took my shirt off while I was there. (I'm getting a farmers tan from hiking, lol). 10:40 back on trail.
Quick shout out to Julie at Marmot!! My sleeping bag is from this company and it goes into a stuff sack with compression straps to make it tiny tiny to fit in my pack. The seams holding the straps to the stuff sack are starting to give way a little. I'd say another month and for sure at least one will break off. Without those straps my sleeping bag will be too big to fit in my pack with all my other gear. I contacted Marmot and with in 1 day they have already shipped me a new compression stuff sack! Thanks Julie!!! 
I've already made it to 2 overlooks today and I still have 5 more to go! Those are where I get the amazing photos at! Some days there are none, never are there 7 in 1 day!! Exciting. 
Made it 7 miles to the shelter I was trying to get to last night at 11:35.  Had lunch, today was a tortilla wrap with spam and cheese. I definitely think I like the chicken salad or tuna salad packs vs the spam. But it's something new I tried. Not bad, just not my preference. 12:20 back on trail. 
Knee is feeling good. Still swollen a little but the pain is not nearly as bad as it was yesterday afternoon. 
1:40 I've gone 11 miles and that's with stoping for about 1.5 hours total, at the lookout and for lunch. Making good time. In the next 3 miles there are 5 more outlooks!
I have 6 miles till the next shelter which is the next water source. I plan to stop there, get water and then head 2-4 miles to the next Campsite for the night. I should be to the shelter between 4-4:30.
Wholy crap!!! I was soooo wrong. I didn't make it to the shelter till right about 6pm!! Those 6 miles (except for about 1/2 a mile that was on an old dirt road) were the hardest and most scary part of the trail I've encountered thus far. What should have taken me about 2.5 hours took me over 4 hours! 
So this is what they ment by Pennsylvania Rocks. I had one section before this about 10 days ago where I said I had to actually put my trekking poles down and climb up some rocks. Well that definitely happened again today. This part of the trail was insane. There was about 1/4 of a mile that was all hiking on a rock ridge with a drop of at least 100ft on either side. The rocks were all slanted so it was murder on my ankles. That part alone took me about 45 minutes. It was so scary that before I started it I took off my pack, adjusted it to make sure all my compression straps were as tight as they could get so my pack wouldn't slide around at all and get me off balance. I even went as far as, I had about 3/4 of a bottle of water. I evened it out into both of my bottles so the weight was the same on either side of my pack. I always have my trekking pole straps around my wrists (I have tan lines to prove it). I took those off and just held on to them, still using them but that way if I did loose my balance I wouldn't get tripped up trying to catch myself by my poles. I'd just let go and let them drop and deal with retrieveing them after. So that 1/4 mile was the scariest/most nerve-wracking part of the trail for me thus far. And stuff like that usually doesn't get to me. At all... I was just nervous, it's totally different doing things like that with a 35lb pack on your back. 
Even after that it was still a rock scramble for ever. I was climbing up rocks, climbing down rocks, and none of them were level so my ankles really got a workout this afternoon. None of the rocks were flat either so I was constantly stepping in sharp edges of rocks. The arches of my feet are soo sore. All in all those 6 miles really really sucked. My knee of course started to throb during all this a least tonight I know why it's going to be hurting. Yesterday, idk, it was weird. Just all of a sudden it started to hurt. 
Oh and about 2 miles from the shelter I drank the last of my water. But!!! About 1.5 miles from the shelter was a parking lot with about 10 gallon jugs full of water! Trail magic! I did fill up one of my bottles there so I could drink some then and have some for the next mile. 
Finally made it to the shelter/water around 6pm. I'm not going any further tonight. I'm setting up camp, making 2 dinners, eating a bunch of candy and passing out. My feet are throbbing and my knee is swollen. I did take some ibuprofen when I got to the shelter, hopefully that will help with the swelling of my knee and everything else that's sore from today. Man. Today started out great and ended well.. Not so awesome. 
The shelter I'm at is definitely the oldest most run down shelter I've seen on the trail. This is also the first shelter I've come across that doesn't gave a privy. 
I've met sooo many people along my journey on the trail thus far. There are so many that I have met that I'm actually nervous for them to get to the 6 miles I just did. Wow. I'm not sure how some of them will accomplish it. 
Wanna hear the craziest part... So in the Appalachian Trail Guide it warns if a steep rocky section and those 6 miles weren't it!!! it's 9 miles ahead of me so I get to go thru that tomorrow... If today wasn't mentioned as a hard area I can't even imagine what tomorrow is going to bring!!! One of the reasons I wanted to do another 2-4 miles today was to get closer to that section so my legs would be as fresh as possible for it. 
When I was getting ready to make dinner #1 a younger local couple hiked down to just check out the area. Gabby and Joey. They were curious about my journey and what gear they might need if they were to do a few days or a section of the trail. We chatted for about 30 min then they headed back to their car. Gabbys final words were a quote. 
""When it rains look for rainbows when it's dark look for stars"" I like that!! 
Speaking of dinner #1. One thing that I learned from Turtlehawk a few weeks ago is some hikers make 2 dinners (I'm not the only fatty!! Haha). So dinner #1 make Ramen, and for dinner #2 make mashed potatoes... When your done with the noodles of the ramen don't drink the broth. Add water to it and make your mashed potatoes with the flavored water. Fantastic idea!!! I definitely tried it tonight and yeah.... That's a game changer. Ha.
Of course only 1 of my 5ish pictures of the crazy Rocky parts will load on this site. I'll point them out in week 6 Facebook photo dump. The pictures do NOT do it justice tho.","Campsite 1235.5

Pagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637041,"5:50 woke up 37 degrees. When it's that cold it makes it really hard to get out of my warm sleeping bag and sleep clothes and put on my cold hiking clothes. Finally got moving, packed everything up, made breakfast 3 grits, coffee, and a cup of carnation chocolate milk. Well chocolate water but tastes like chocolate milk. 
7:40 on trail 43 degrees. For the first time in a few weeks I actually left camp with both of my water bottles full. Water in this area is pretty scarce. My knee swelling is down from last night and so far this morning there's no pain. 
I think it was a great decision not to rush it to Delaware water gap no way I would have made it by Saturday at 11 am. 
Made it 2.5 miles to a road that has a reliable water source (one of the last ones for many miles). Again there was some trail magic!! There were about 15 gallon jugs of water, some empty, some 1/2 full and some full. I didn't fill up at all because I still have my 2 full liters and I chugged a liter before I left camp. Also used over a liter to make all my breakfast goodies.
In the first 2.5 miles there were 2 about 1/2 mile sections that were basically what I'll call boulder jumping. Other than those 2 spots prerty easy trail. 
9:15 I stopped for a bit to take off my long underwear. Up to about 52 degrees. When I do this I have to take off my gaiters & shoes. Putting back ony left gaiter I noticed that it's about to break also. So I went ahead and was proactive and duck taped it. The right one seems to be holding up pretty good. I also put on my essential oils while I was here because I forgot to this morning before leaving camp. My right knee is already starting to swell back up. 9:25 back on trail. 
Saw another porcupine!!! This one was faster than the first one I saw. Just after that was about a mile of downhill. This is when my knee began to bother me. About 1/2 way down there was a shelter and just last the shelter actually on the trail was a pipes spring!!! I didn't read about that anywhere. I went ahead and drank so more water. Left there with both of my water bottles full and my 1 liter dirty water container. When I got down the hill I was at a road. I looked on Google and there's a gas station 8/10s of a mile down the road. My knee is hurting pretty bad and pretty swollen. I took the last of my ibuprofen last night. (I only had 6 pills to start the trail). 
11:30-1 I spent walking to that gas station and all they sold was gas. That was 8/10s of a mile. Another mile down the road was a real gas station with food/pills. I went ahead and walked to the next one and got my ibuprofen and.... On my walk back I had passed a hotdog stand. So I stopped and got 2 hotdogs!! Ha. At the first gas station I asked the guy if I could drop my bag there and pick it up on the way back. He said no problem. That was a huge help!! 
1:15 and 72 degrees. I made it back to the trail head. Good news is I've made it 7.5 miles... Bad news is I've only made it 7.5 miles. 1 more mile till the steep/Rocky section. 
Also I still have 38 miles to Delaware Water Gap.. At this rate I'm not going to get there till Sunday afternoon. I'm considering taking a zero there to let my knee rest. I'll see how I feel over the next 48 hours. 
Oh also there's not a reliable water source for about 15 more miles so I'm carrying 3 liters of water currently. (about 7.5 lbs) 
Why is there an 1,100 foot uphill BEFORE the steep Rocky part. Seriously!! 
At 3:30 I have made to a campsite 4.5 miles since 1:15. So I realized after rereading the ""caution steep rocky section"" that the 1,100ft uphill was actually the steep Rocky section. Not beyond it. On my way up I kept thinking crap, if this isn't the hard part I can't even imagine the hard part. That 1 mile section alone took me an hour. That part was in fact very hard. Again more actual rock climbing, pulling myself (and a 35lb pack) up these Rocky edges. There were many times that if I would have lost my balance well... Nothing good would have came of it. I ended up holding my trekking poles most of that mile. After the 1 mile of really hard there was about a mile of pretty flat ridge running thru a grassy path. In that path I ended up getting 3 ticks on my legs, felt them immediately and was able to brush them off. There hasn't been a good shady place to stop till I reached this Campsite. Sun is beating down and it's hot!! I still have over 2.5 liters of water on me so I have enough to make it thru the day, dinner and breakfast. Meals will be without hot tea/coffee unless I magically find more water between here and when I stop for the day. Going to hang out here for a bit and rest myself and my knee. Eating my lunch, a chicken salad/cheese wrap and a 3 Musketeers. Yeah I had those hotdogs but that wasn't lunch. That was luck. Ha. 
There's another camp site in 2 miles then the next one on the map isn't for another 11 miles from here! 
So far today I've done 12 miles on the trail and at least another 3.5 walking into town and back. 
Back on trail at 4:10. Still have 31 miles to Delaware Water Gap. 
4:15 I rolled my left ankle and fell backwards landing on my pack luckily. I stepped on a rock, that rock rolled along with my ankle. When I walked into the first gas station I asked if they had any ibuprofen he said they didn't sell any but asked the guy in the back if he had any. Ended up giving me some tylonal. Since I really wanted the ibuprofen to help reduce the swelling I ended up taking the pills he gave me and 2 of the pills I bought. After a few hundred yards my ankle started to feel better but I'm not sure at this point if it's good, or it's the drugs saying that I'm good. These past 3 days have not been my favorite on the trail... At all.... 
About 4:45 I came to another road crossing with a parking lot and thank the gods again!!! Water jugs!!! These are the same brand as the other 2 spots where I have found the water. My guess is it's the same guy. What an amazing human!!  I chugged one of my liters and refilled it. Back on the trail with all 3 of my liters full. 
5:20 I made it to the campsite. Since I'm not 100% sure I can find another spot to camp between here and the next shelter I'm going to stay here for the night. Let me knee and ankle rest. There's a shelter 23 miles ahead. Thats going to be my goal for tomorrow, leaving me a little less than 7 miles for Sunday to get into Delaware Water Gap. Even if I don't make it all the way to the shelter tomorrow I should be in a pretty good place to get to town by 1-2pm Sunday. 
Made a small fire to keep the bugs away. Had mashed potatoes and salmon for dinner. My day has come to an end. 
Oh on my way down the hill where I found the spring. Just past there was an odd looking abandoned tent, sleeping bag and blankets still in side. I checked for a body, no body. I checked for blood, no blood. Weird. Tent was fallen over and unzipped.","Bake Oven Knob Shelter

Pagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637155,"Welcome to Week 7!!!
Woke up at 5:50 again. 43 degrees so it's a little warmer than yesterday but today there's a breeze which makes it colder. Tore down camp, made breakfast 3 oatmeal and I did have enough water for coffee. Hiking out with 1 liter of water. I'll stop for water when I stop for lunch at the next shelter in 9.5 miles. The next shelter has 3 springs ranging from 1/10-6/10 off trail. Hopefully the closest one has a good enough flow. 
On trail at 7:50 48 degrees. I know I haven't been doing a very good job at cutting down the time from when I wake up till I'm on trail. Oh well. My ankle feels fine this morning and once again the swelling in my knee has went down. I'll see how my knee feels/looks when I stop for lunch. Hopefully I'll make it to the shelter by noon. 
At 9:10 I stopped for a few minutes to take off my long underwear, it's up to 60 degrees. I already stopped about 30 min ago and took off my under armour shirt and rolled up my sleeves. I really need to start taking karhops advice again and be bold start cold. Lol. I'm just not good at doing the chilly thing...  I've made it a little over 3 miles so far but I am taking it easy. So far my ankle still feels good and my knee has only bothered me for a few steps where the rocks were in the way. Lol. I did take another set of ibuprofen this morning with breakfast. 
One thing I've really noticed today is the amount of Flys!! They aren't bothering me tho (I must not smell bad enough) but all I hear all over the place is the buzzing of them flying around. 
11:30, 72 degrees. I made it to the shelter with water. Stopped here and had my lunch. When I got to the shelter there was a boy scout group there cleaning up the area, cleaning out the fire pits. Pretty cool to see. So far the terrain today had been amazing compared to the last few days. I think that's been really helping my knee. Walked down to the spring and the first one wasn't flowing but the second one had a great flow. Filled up all 3 of my liters because there's not much between here and where I hope to camp tonight. Oh, at this shelter I did a thing!!!! I made it 1/4 of the way thru my Appalachian Trail Journey!!! 550 miles down!! 1650 to go. 
So last night after I posted my journal a guy names Salt Lick showed up where I was camping. He's doing a flip flop also, he started in Harper's Ferry. We chatted a little bit last night. In 2005 he did a thru hike of the PCT. (the west coast trail, longer than the AT). This morinng he was on the trail at 6:45. I saw him again just before the shelter, he had stopped for lunch. He then showed up at the shelter I had lunch at. He came down to fill up water and when he came back up he said he had seen a huge rattle snake!! Said it was about 4 in round and a few feet long. Crazy! I was just down there and didn't see it, or hear it. 
12:50 back on trail. Salt lick left the shelter before me so I figured I'd never see him again until maybe at camp. About a mile on the trail I caught up to him and we ended up hiking all afternoon together. We had a great conversation. It was really cool to ask him questions and pick his brain since he's already completed a long distance thru hike. I learned so much from him. At 4pm we had completed 17 miles. My (I thought unrealistic) goal was to do 23 miles today to a shelter to put me only 6 miles from town for tomorrow morinng. 
Right around 4 I saw ""Jaws"" who I met at a camp the night before Boiling Springs where I met Pagne Senior. The odd thing was that JAWS was hiking towards me. We both recognized each and I asked what he was doing headed south??? He was confused.. Somehow he got turned around and had been hiking in the wrong direction for over an hour. I felt really bad for him, I'm so glad I saw him when I did because the only hill we encountered yesterday was right there. I was about 90% of the way to the top when I saw him. So he was about to go down it after he had already went up it once, then go up again pretty mad I'd assume. 
On down the trail Salt lick and I were making good time and with our conversation being so interesting I didn't really even realize how many miles we were doing. We ended up making it to the shelter!!! 23 miles!!!! Made it there at 6:30. I'm pretty confident if I wasn't hiking with him I wouldn't have made it that far, he felt the same way about hiking with me. Once we got to the shelter we found an area to set up our tents and ended up cooking dinner and talking till almost 9pm!!! I'm always in my tent by 8! What a day!
I also realized that when I leave Delaware Water Gap, I'm finally out of Pennsylvania!! 
A little side note about my right knee (which felt great all day) again I blame that on the easier terrain. Around 2001 Pagne Senior and I took a snowboarding trip and I ended up tearing my ACL and MCL in my right knee. It really doesn't give me any issue since then but I think that might also be part of the reason it was the first to hurt on trail.","Campsite 1266.5

Pagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637266,"Woke up 5:40 packed up my gear and tent and was on the trail at 6:25, 46 degrees. Salt Lick actually waited around for me this morning (only had to actually wait maybe 10 min). He was so impressed with how we hiked together yesterday and kept saying he wouldn't have made it that far without me. He only felt it right for us to hike into town together. I thought that was really nice of him. He also left me with a quote ""Can't quit on a bad day only a good day"". I like that quote.We exchanged a few jokes also. One thing that I'm always going to remember is someone asked us ""are you thru hiking?"". His reply was priceless... He said ""No, I have more to hike."" haha it was funny. 
8:45 made it to town!!! The church with the hostel is only 2/10s off the trail. So I stopped there, checked it out. There is a shower, about 8 bunks, restroom and a living couch/table area. I dropped my pack there and headed to Village Farmer and Bakery. Whoa it was amazing in there, home made cookies, candies, muffins, pot pies, dessert pies, breakfast sandwiches, jams, just all sorts of stuff. I got a blue berry muffin (the were out of the bacon glazed donut). A breakfast sandwich that came on a honey raisin bread. It was pretty amazing along with the muffin. The carmel latte... Boo. They have a nespreso machine that does the lattes and stuff. Don't get me wrong, when I first tired nespreso I thought/still think it's amazing. But that haven't dialed in the lattes yet. So that part wasn't awesome. Oh well. 
Came back to the hostel, showerd, set up my tent. I'm just going to stay in my tent tonight. I'm comfortable sleeping in there now and sleep really well in here. And the bunk room is a pretty small warm area. I'll still use their power outlets and sit on the couch some. They have a nice area outside also. And since that's what I'm here for I'll probably stay outside most of the day. 
I finally found a scale. On April 3 when I started I was 168lbs. In Glasgow at the hostel on Day 5 I was 164.5. Now on day 44 I'm down to 153. I promise I'm eating as much as I can carry. 
1:30 and 72 degrees a beautiful day. Time for me to go get a bunch of BBQ. There's a place here but they are closed on Monday so I'm going to stock up today, I'll eat some this afternoon and some this evening. I ended up back at the hostel at 2:15, sat outside under a covered porch and ate part of my coleslaw, potato salad, baked beans, burnt ends, pulled pork, brisket, cornbread, wild cherry Pepsi. 
At 3 it started to rain I was sooo full I went to my tent, watched about 20 min of a movie. Then I got ready to nap. Slept till 6pm, got up and headed to the Chinese place (again not open on monday so I wanted to get some for tonight and for tomorrow. The girl working at Sango Kura (Chinese food place) is freaking beautiful. Christina, I made sure to tell her just how beautiful she was. I got pork and chicken fried rice, ahi/salmon poke bowl. It was delicious. 
I have about 1/2 of the fried rice left I'll at that tomorrow with my BBQ. 
Tomorrow morning I'm going to walk to Dunkin Donuts for some donut holes!!! Then to the post office for my resupply box and compactor bag. I am going to zero tomorrow just to make sure my knee is good. I'll get a uber over to the Walmart to get a few miscellaneous items I need and a little more resupply which is about 6 miles away. Then just back to the hostel and relax for the rest of the afternoon.
I did find out that apparently this church hostel is the oldest one on the trail. It's been here for over 42 years. Pretty cool. 
Friends I've met here at the hostel include. 
Papa
Jaws who used to use the Jaws of life in Florida
Action & Adventure. A couple named by a canoe group they go with. 
Tim got his name from his parents. Ha
Spoon. Lost his spoon in Shenandoah. Used a tent steak, friends would replace his tent steaks with togo spoons.

Finally got up, it was weird getting up in my tent and not packing it up. That's the first time I've done that. Ha.Walked over to Dunkin donuts to get a latte and some donut holes. The lobby is closed so there's only the drive through open. I waited behind 2 cars and then walked up to the ordering speaker. The lady said ""no walk throughs"" oh crap. That's dumb... There were 2 cars behind me, I stepped over to the side and the first car came to the speaker. So I went ahead and put my thumb out and made eye contact with the car behind her. Just 1 guy in the car. He rolled down his window, I quickly explained and he let me ride with him. His name is Kevin. He works in the area. Yesterday was his birthday, at his work when it's your birthday you bring the goodies so he was stopping for 2 dozen donuts to share. He ordered then I ordered 25 donut holes and a latte. I was in a rush and excited to be in a car I forgot to say glazed only. So I got chocolate and blueberry ones also. Kevin even paid for my breakfast!!! Them he poceed to take me most of the way back to the church, he let me out at his turn. So nice. HAPPY BIRTHDAY KEVIN (yesterday). 
Back at the church I ate my holes, shared some and enjoyed a good latte. At 8:30 I walked to the post office to get my resupply and compactor bag. Pagne Senior had sent the resupply box and my new friend Sundial had sent me 2 compactor bags after meeting me and reading my journal about needing to get one. She also sent a little trail magic. So sweet, thanks again Sundial!! 
Back at the church I organized the new resupply with the left over food I had. Made a list of what I still needed and called an uber to take me the 7 miles to Walmart. 
Got my resupply/miscellaneous items and in the parking lot was an Arby's. Had to stop and inhale a 1/2 lb roast beef sandwich really quick. There was a Starbucks near so I went ahead and got another Carmel latte to make up for yesterday, haha. 
There's no laundry places in Delaware Water Gap and I didn't even think about bringing my laundry with me to this larger town. Oh well. It will be about 180 miles between laundry days for me. 
When I got back to the church after Walmart I had a surprise waiting there for me!!! John and Peggy where there to see me. This couple I've known for about 4 years. They are winter texans that came down to the campgrounds I worked at in South Padre Island Texas. I was totally shocked to see them. What an amazing surprise. They are into metal detecting and were at a retreat in the area. They have been keeping up with my journal and since they were driving with in minutes of where I was they stopped and waited for me hopeing to catch me!! They gave me a few goodies, we talked for awhile and I also received 2 cold cokes!!! Delicious!! Thanks again John and Peggy for taking time out to try to find me to brighten my day!! 
I reorganized my food and sat down to watch a movie. 
Ate the rest of my BBQ around 5:30.
At 6 I walked down to the gas station to get 2 new Smartwater bottles. Those are the ones I carry with me for my water supply. The ones I have are getting pretty beat up and I'm afraid they will start to leak soon. On my way down the street, who do I see??? Pippin, Tenacious, Zoomy & Halo. They just got back from Trail Days in Virginia and were headed out of town to continue hiking. What are the odds!! They had mentioned that I might catch back up to them after Pagne Senior left because they were taking days off for trail days. 
At the hostel some of my new friends include. 
Colonel B, he retired army reserve a colonel and is a retired banker. 
Donatello, hikes with a big staff just like the ninja turtle! 
Santa, he received got a huge resupply and had way too much to carry so he was giving away food to everyone awhile back. 
Free, this is his third time hiking the trail he likes to be free. 
It's 7 I'm going to eat the rest of my Chinese, a root beer and a little candy. Finish ensuring everything is full charged and going to hit the sack.

It didn't rain last night but the inside of my fly was all wet just from me breathing in my tent all night while it was in the 40s outside. Trying to let that dry out some before I hit the trail. I did some weighing of myself a my gear before I left. This is all approximately, I don't 100% believe the scale I used. Me = 153Me in hiking clothes = 159Me in hiking clothes + pack = 178Me in hiking clothes + pack + food = 192Me in hiking clothes + pack + food + water = 197Clothes 5, Pack 19, Food 14, Water 5 (2 liters of water). Carrying 38 pounds on my back. Uggg. I don't need to carry all this water weight out but I just bought these 2 smart water bottles and I seems really ""not smart"" to dump some of that water out. Right before I left the church I ran into Spatz, he did the trail a few years ago and is now a ridge runner for the area. I'm not 100% what a ridge runner is or does but it sounds awesome. I've heard the term a few other times along the trail. Back on trail at 7:40. Ran into Papa at 10:15 about 6 miles. He was relaxing by a pond, I joined him for about 20 minutes then was on my way. 12:45 I arrived at the Mohican Outdoor Center, 11.5 miles from the church and it's 75 degrees. Papa had told me about this place. Serve hot food. All I had was a banana for breakfast and I ate a few protein bars along the way. They were still serving breakfast!! I got the hikers platter. Pancakes, eggs, toast, sausage, hash browns. That was delicious.. When I got there Pippin, Tenacious, Zoomy and Halo had all just arrived also. They had been at Trail Days in Virginia the past weekend so they were moving pretty slow. Ha. I was surprised that I caught them as soon as I did. 2pm back on trail. By the way I hit my 5th state today!! So far I've been in Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and now I'm in New Jersey. Saw a black snake that was around 3.5-4ft long!! We looked at each other for a bit then he went into the brush. One thing I've noticed this morinng hiking thru New Jersey is the grasshoppers! I haven't seen them in trail before but this morinng they were jumping all over the place. From the Mohican place to the camp site is about 9.5 miles. I ended up getting passed by Santa, he was at the hostel last night. He started in Georgia on February 27th I kept up with him for about three miles, then I took a rest. Sat down for about 10 minutes then when I was putting my pack back on Pippin passed me. She was in a hurry. She has somewhere to be tomorrow night to get picked up to go be in a wedding. She will have about 5 zero days in a row. I kept up with her for about 2 miles then since I was almost to my camp site for the night I slowed down a bit. Arrived at camp at 6. It's right in a little pond and has a perfect view of sunset. I'm going to set up, make dinner and enjoy the view. 8:15 I'm about to go lay down.

That's where I'll have breakfast. 7:35 I made it to the approach trail to my treat. It's buttermilk falls. The highest waterfall in New Jersey falls over 200ft. My plan was to drop my pack at the top and hike down to there to have breakfast. Well it's 2 miles down and 2 miles back up. All the comments say that it is very steep and rocky and takes people usually 3-4 hours to hike there and back. With it being 2 miles down, dropping my pack at the top isn't a wise idea (bears). I wouldn't be back for 3-4 hours. Of course once I got down there I'd spend about an hour exploring and cooking breakfast. As I got to the the decision making point 2 hikers came up from the falls. Said that it's barely a trickle and definitely not worth the climb/time... So theres my decision. I just don't feel it's worth it. Stinks though because I left an amazing place to have breakfast just to come here and eat on a rock. Lol. Oh well. As I was getting ready to pack up Santa came up the trail. He had camped a little ways down the approach trail to the falls. He didn't make the trek down either there either though.Today is my day 47, on one of Pagne Senior and mines first few days out here we met Betty White and Crypto, they were on their day 47 since beginning in Georgia. They were at about 750 miles. So they definitely had a faster pace than me. 
While Santa and I were refilling water two of his friends met up with us. Whisper and Pneumonia. Whisper is just extremely soft spoken. Pneumonia actually did the trail last year and had to get off for a bit because he caught pneumonia. This is his second time hiking the trail. Those 3 took off and I didn't try to keep up. 
I ended up catching up to Kip who I met while Pagne Senior was on trail with me. He had gone the wrong way and I caught him at a trail crossing. We ended up hiking together for about 8 miles today. We walked right by a town and everyone had been talking about going to the tavern just off the trail. So we did also. Gyps Tavern. We got there at noon and it was 82 degrees. I got a burger, frys and a root beer! It was delicious! There were quite a few hikers there, everyone I've mentioned above also Snacks and Trebek. Snacks just enjoyed snacks alot he said he always has way too many in his pack. Trebek got his name because he asked so many questions in the beginning of his hike that the names him that after Jeopardy host Alex Trebek. 
Back on trail at 1. A few miles past the tavern I was still hiking with Kip, I leas leading and we came across a big rattle snake!!!  It was right in the right side of the trail and rattling hard!!! So we stepped back aways. It stopped rattling so we slowing started back up the trails and boom it started rattling again. So we went back and walked thrubthe brush around the trail all while still being able to hear this snake going crazy. Once we had passed it we got back on trail, I went a little ways back towards it to see if I could get a picture of it, but it was still rattling a bunch!! So I didn't get close, I did take a video of it so you could hear how hard it was rattling. 
While at the tavern I told a few hikers about not going down to the waterfall and I was kinda disappointed. They suggested that I hike to the next shelter and spend the night. There's a summit called Sunrise Summit 2.5 miles form the shelter that the trail goes over. So I took their advice.. 
I ended up stopping for the day at 3pm at the shelter they had mentioned. I'm going to set an alarm for 3:45am, hopefully I'll be able to get up, pack up and make it the 2.5 miles before 5:30am. I hope to make it to the summit and watch the sunrise while I'm eating my breakfast. That sounds like a pretty good idea. And this Sunrise Summit is my actual 600 mile marker. So it should be a good morning. 
I met Feral at the church hostel, there we only had a short convo, didn't even exchange names. But she was at the shelter when I came out of my tent for dinner this evening. When I got here at 3 the Gnats were horrible so I set up my tent and watched a movie. She and I had a grest conversation for about 2 hours this evening. She got her name from a friend back home who said she's farel, like free in the wild. I assume I'll cross paths with her again at some point. 
OK it's 8:30, I hope that I can find the strength to actually wake up at 3:45am. If I do that will be the first time I've hiked with my head lamp on. I've honestly only used my head lamp for a total of maybe 2 hours since I've been out on trail. 
Also tonight is another first, I've never slept in my tent without the rain cover on. But tonight is a beautiful evening so I'm going to try it.
Also.... I haven't mentioned it because there haven't been any and I didn't want to jinx it, but tonight I got my first misquote bite.... It has begun. 
Thanks so much to everyone who's been keeping up and reading my Journal!!! I really truly appreciate it and I'm so glad everyone has been enjoying the journey! As of today I have over 20,000 views of my journal!!! Wow.","Crater Lake Shore

Pagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637559,"Up at 3:45, stepped outside to pee and In that short time I heard leaves rustling all over the place. I decided not to hike in the dark. Went back to sleep and was up at 4:50. On trail at 5:30, 52 degrees. It's a beautiful morning thus far. 
6:20 I made it to sunrise summit. This is my 600 miles on the Appalachian Trail mile marker!! 1,600 togo! When I got there Forgetful was camping there. I didn't opt to camp here because online it said no camping. He started in Georgia on March 13th!!! That's the latest start that I've heard of thaglt I've been hiking around. Most of the Georgia hikers Ive met say they started around late February. I asked what kind of miles he was doing and he said consistently 20 miles a day. No Zeros, and only a few Neros. When he was putting on his boots  around 10 milipeedes fell out of each one!! 
7:30 back on trail. At 8:40, 63 degrees, and I've done 6 miles. I might be able to basically do the miles I did yesterday by noon. 
I caught up a girl name Rue, she started in Georgia. Ended up hiking with Whisper about  8 miles till I got to where I wanted to stop for lunch. It was a small picnic area around a pond. Had something different kinda today. I've seen people with BBQ pulled pork meat pouches. I finally found some at Walmart so I packed out 2 of them. So today instead of chicken salad wrap I had BBQ pulled pork wraps. When I find that again I'm definitely going to get some more. I got to the picnic area at 11:30, 12.9 miles so far today, more than yesterday's total, Ha. It's 75 degrees.
12:15 back on trail. Emerald I caught up to a girl who started in Harper's Ferry but she skipped around 100 miles of Pennsylvania.. 
Not Yet, passed him on the trail, are we there yet.... Not yet.... 
At 3pm I walked by the last shelter jefore town. It's called secret shelter. It's actually privately owned and on some guys private land he let's hikers camp there and has some amazing tasting well water. I just filled up some water and was on my way. The tryouts were there taking a Zero day. They are a family of 8!! Kids are pretty young, I think 7 is the youngest up to 17?? They started in Georgia and I've heard alot about them. The kids are home schooled. So I've heard a few funny storys where hikers have been around them and said something, and the kids ask ""what's that... "". Just let your imagination take the lead on that statement. Ha. Jake the donkey also lives there. He was super nice. I wa told he would let you pet him. I didn't.
I got to Unionville at 3:30. I had planned to stay at the shelter where I filled up water and met the trouts but at lunch I hear some other hikers saying you could camp in town. And there's a pizza place, Deli, tavern. So tonight it's pizza and tomorrow morning coffee and a breakfast sandwich then back on the trail. Hopefully another 20 miles tomorrow. When I got to town Kip and Colonel B were here. I went to the Deli whoch is where you sign in to camp in the park across the street. When I was signing in the girl without missing a beat said. "" oh and there's a bear that goes thru the park at night"" So. I might get to see my first bear tonight, obviously he hasn't hurt anyone since he's still here and every person I mentioned so far today, plus a few others said they plan to sleep here also. I was the first one to set up my tent. I checked my compass to make sure my spot would be in the shade the rest of the afternoon. 
Today was a pretty easy day for getting almost 21 miles in. I really enjoyed waking up and being on the trail early, the stopping within an hour or two then making breakfast. I think I might try that a few more times, not tomorrow though because I want a breakfast sandwich. It was really nice to have over 1/2 of my miles for the day knocked out before noon. Made the afternoon seem not as daunting and it was alot cooler hiking In the morning vs the afternoon. 
Between lunch and town I had to walk about 2 miles thru tall grassy fields. I probably stopped about 10 time to check for ticks. I found 3 but they were easy to brush off. 
Met a girl named Wicked, because she's wicked cool to hike with. Went across the street to Annabelle's pizza. Got myself 2 slices of pizza, garlic knots and a Dr pepper. Yummy. 
Back over near my tent around 7. Thinking of laying down, watching some movie and falling asleep. Breakfast place opens at 6. So I could be on the trail by 7. We shall see.","Gren Anderson Shelter

Pagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637577,"Woke up at 5:45 and had everything all packed up at 6:20. I didn't actually get to the trail till 8, I stopped at the general store for coffee and breakfast. A banana, a twist donut, and a breakfast bagel sandwich. It was delicious. I have 20 miles to the New York state line. In 17.5 miles there's a road you can take 2.5 miles and stay at a drive in movie theater!! I'm going to opt out of that just mainly because the first movie doesn't start till 9pm! That's bed time!! Ha.At 9:30, it was 72 degrees. Last night/this morning I met Tall son. Short for Tall SOB.
Gangster, got his name from the shoe saleman. He was trying on a pair of shoes and ended up bleeding on them. Salesmen said that was Gangster. LOL. Sweet Corn she's sweet and from I forget the corn part. Slippers. Day 2 he woke up and all his gear and his shoes were frozen. He hiked 2 miles back to the office in his slippers. Oak, not sure his name. and Most of them started In Georgia February 15-25th. 
Today we walked thru alot of muddy, boggy, swamp areas. Walked on little double wide board bridges alot! Also walked for about a mile on a really nice wooded bridge. One of the sets of boards gave way and was like a teeter totter!! I saw a deer while walking on the planks. Also crossed a long suspension bridge that was wooden.
10:30, 6 miles completed. Just climbed a 1,350ft incline. 72 degrees. I have another incline the same in 7 miles.  
11:15, stopped for a snack and to refill my water. Back ok trail at 11:30. I plan to stop somewhere in the next 3 miles ish to have lunch
Made it to a Creamery at 1:10 I've done 12 miles. I ended up having lunch there. I did get some ice cream (blueberry cream, and cookies and cream. Not together though) and a Gatorade. But I ate my tuna salad/cheese wraps. The Trouts are here. (the family of 7-8) Gangster, Oak, Slippers all were at the creamery also. 
Leaving Creamery 2:30. It's 84 degrees. It's pretty darn hot. Time for my second incline. Got about 2/3 of the way up the hill and Kip was stopped there refilling water. So I sat with him for a bit then we finished the hike into the shelter together. It was about 4 miles. 
Got to the shelter at 4:30, did 17.2 miles today. 
In 4 miles I'll cross officially into New York. That will be state number 6!! 
So New Jersey, it's been very pretty. There were a few pretty decent inclines the further north we got. South was still a little rocky. But a hard rocky area in New Jersey is an easy day of rocks in Pennsylvania. There were many stream crossing and small lakes. The water was the dirtiest I've seen it. Extremely brown, even in the moving streams. There were quite a few places very close to the trail to get food/drinks. All in all it was a petty good state. 
7:30, I'm in my tent. I'm going to watch a movie for a bit and fall asleep. I really hope to get up around 5. I really want to be on the trail by 6 at the latest. It got so hot today and the next 2 days are supposed to be even hotter. I really did enjoy my morning hike a few days ago. So I plan to start hiking sooner, stop for breakfast around 4-5 miles from camp. Find a good spot and enjoy my grits and coffee.","Unionville Town Park

Pagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637659,"Welcome to Week 8!!!!! 
Woke up at 5:30, got everything packed up and was on the trail by 6:15, 62 degrees. 
Walked about 1 tenth of a mile then took a side trail to a park office to fill my water for breakfast soon. 
7:35, I've made it 3 miles, and it's time for breakfast. Not a great view but a good log to sit on and eat. 3 packs of grits, coffee and a carnation chocolate milk. Yummy! 
8:10 back on trail and it's already up to 71 degrees. 
Made it to the New Jersey/New York State like at 8:45, 73 degrees. There's a spray painted state line! This isn't the first time I've actually been in New York, but this is the point where I don't return to New Jersey. 
I had forgotten till I got here but my Dad had emailed me saying there was a tough section at a certain mile marker between Delaware Water Gap and Fort Montgomery. Well I made it to the challenging section. Lots of rocks, there is definitely some rock climbing involved. I even stopped using my trekking poles and started hanging on to rocks. That lasted for about 2 miles. I didn't make very  good time thru there. Ha. 
10:15, 76 degrees. Gone 7 miles and there's another Creamery that everyone is going to for a afternoon snack. It's only a few miles up and pretty close to the trail so I think I'll stop also. 
11:20 made it 10 miles to a Creamery. They don't open till noon. Other hikers are already standing in line. Lol. I'm going to chug a liter of water and refill my water bottles and keep going. In about 4 miles is a waterfall. A 25 footfalls, I'm going to stop there for an hour + (hopefully it's a beautiful area) and weight out the heat. Lucky today is overcast so the sun isn't beating down on me. I still could ring my shirt out it's that wet. Lol. That will leave me with just over 5 more miles to do this evening.
Since I made it to the Creamery so early not realizeing they didn't open till noon at 9:40 I got my pack on and started to hike away when they opened and started helping customers! At least 8 hikers and quite a few cars had already shown up. So I put my pack back down and enjoyed a banana spilt! 
Back on trail at noon. I went thru a very narrow part that had 2 trees and one had some sharp branches. As I passed I thought I turned far enough to the side to miss it hit the sharp part hit my pack where I hold my water bottle and ripped some of the elastic area on it. Oops. I'm going to try to mend it at Fort Montgomery. 
Made it the 4 miles to the Water fall at 1:45. I made my lunch wraps and washed my self off some in the water. I really needed it. I even got my shirt wet and let it out to dry, hopefully remove some of the salt/sweat lines that are all over it! I have about 5.5 more miles to where I'm going to find a camp site. The waterfall was pretty. Not very wide so it made it seem pretty small. But always nice to sit and listen to a waterfall. 
2:45 back on trail. I can honestly say that so far New York is not one of my favorite states. Wow the rocks have been crazy. Small annoying rocks, huge slanted Boulder jumping, rock scrambling and climbing. There's been more swampy areas, had to walk along more planks today. Today I have brushed my head on more branches and had my arms hit more trees/branches than I feel like all my other trail days combined. The trail is really over grown. The blazes from the state line about 10 miles were all fades and very hard to see. My last 5ish miles someone has recently repainted them. The one positive thing is the further away from New Jersey I get the cleaner the water looks.
5:15 made it to camp. Nice little spot, just room for me. But!! Someone left a camp chair here!! Wow what a treat!! 
Oh yeah I saw another snake today. This one was not as mad about me being there like the Rattlesnake was. This one just looked at me then just slithered off trail.","Wawayanda Shelter

Pagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637761,"Up at 5:30. I could hear all sorts of bull frogs in the pond. I went ahead and made breakfast this morning. I was on the trail by 7:30 after going back to get a little more water for the day. It's already 70 degrees and going to get much hotter. When I went back for water I had everything packed up. I saw a 1/2 eater snake that still had the head 1/2 and was still moving around. It was crazy looking.Stopped at 9 for a few minutes, it's up to 75 degrees already, so far I've done 3.5 miles. 
At 11:15 I made it to a shelter that had been closed due to bear activity. I did walk down there and had lunch. I kept a much better eye on my surroundings than I normally would during lunch. 78 degrees and this morning terrain has been pretty difficult. So many more ups and down. There were many times I had to take off my trekking poles, I even had to take my backpack off to fit thru an area called the Lemon Squeeze. Tons of rocky climbs, it was slightly overcast most of the morning so that did help. My pace slowed way down this morning just because of the technical terrain. 
Back on the trail at noon. Ended up stopping at 1:15 to get some more water. Just did about 3 miles and I have around 6 more to go. The sun is really out now but there's a breeze that's helping to keep it a little cooler. 
Back on trail 1:30, 82 degrees. At 2:20 made it another 2 miles to the next shelter. It's so hot so I'm stopping for a rest and drink some water. Where I think I'll camp is still 4 miles ahead. Whisper, Yaks, Pneumonia were at that shelter for a rest also. They left basically as I was getting there. 2:40 back on trail. The terrain has gotten slightly better as the day went on. 
At 3:45 I stopped again for water. The three guys from earlier were there also refilling and chugging alot. I have 2 miles to where I'm going to find a place to camp. 
4:15 back on trail and finally made it to a Stelth site at 5:30, it's still 82 degrees.
Tomorrow I'll wake up early and head out. I'll arrive in Fort Montgomery NY around 10am is my goal. It's about 6 miles to where I'll leave trail for town, then another 1.5 miles into town. I have a hotel room for the evening so I can shower really good and do laundry. I haven't done laundry since I was at the bluerocks campgrounds the day Pagne Senior left trail. So it's been awhile. I do have a resupply package waiting on me also thanks to Pagne Senior. I carried out a ton of food this last section. I'm going to try to make sure I don't do that again. Although except for some of the food that I replaced with the ability to have town food, I did really well on eating it all. If I hadn't gotten all the town food I did this past section I'm pretty sure I'd be almost empty. The next section to Great Barrington is about 115 miles. I'm going to take 7 days worth of food with me. I should more than likley end up arriving on the 7th day.
Made dinner, got to watch the sunset from a rocky outlook. The best part of my day was my knee only hurting a few steps out of the whole day. It was still giving me some issues on the down hills for the past few days and yesterday it did really hurt from lunch-afternoon break, for about 2 hours. So I stopped, rested and it didn't bother me the rest of the way to camp. It also hasn't been swelling like it was last week. I haven't taken anything for it in about 3-4 days.
I also passed the 1,400 mile mark for the Georgia group this evening. I didn't see a painting or marking anywhere for it. I've seen a few of the 100 mile markers but not all of them.","Little Dam Lake Inlet

Pagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637813,"Woke up at 5:15 got everything packed up pretty quickly. I didn't end up having breakfast but I had a protein bar on the first part of my hike. On trail at 5:45 and 54 degrees. Last night I slept without my rain cover on and on top of my sleeping bag also out of my liner. That's the first time I've fallen asleep like that. Woke up around 11 and got into my liner. Then at some point I ended up getting all the way into my sleeping bag.
There were so many amazing view points today on my hike to town. At 7 I had made it 3 miles. There was a bench that was in memory of one of the chief park rangers. I stopped at the bench for a few minutes just to soak in the view. 
Today I ended up climbing bear mountain. The south side of it had alot of stairs going uphill and wasn't a blast. The north side was downhill and entirely made of carved stone steps! So again today did not have fantastic terrain in my opinion. Lol. I really haven't enjoyed the New York terrain thus far. Hopefully it gets better at some point, there have been some pretty darn good views tho. I have about 60 more miles in NY. Once I got between the steps and the trail zoo there was a big pond with lots of picnic tables and alot of trash cans. Trash was overflowing all over the place. By far the dirtiest place I've seen on trail thus far. 
Bear mountain has a trail side zoo that the AT literly goes thru, I was pretty excited just to see what animals where there or that I could see. But, when I got to the gate it was locked. They didn't open till 10:30 and I got there around 8. I remembered I had saw a detour sign for people with animals to take around the zoo because they didn't allow animals in the zoo. It was about the same distance as the trail. I was a little sad I couldn't go thru it. 
As I was walking the mile into town Snacks and Gangster were leaving town. They stayed at the same place I'm staying. 
By 9:30 I already had my resupply package picked up from the post office and was eating my breakfast. Only drip coffee available here. 
Headed to the hotel. I was able to check in early again. I was in my room by 10am. Walking into the hotel I met Forager another flip-flop from Harpers Ferry. He was a new face and headed back to the trail. 
I started my laundry which I truly needed to do. Showered and washed off my tan again. Went thru my food from what I came into town with and my resupply food. I only needed a few items and there's not a taxi, uber, lyft in the area and the nearest grocery store is about 2 miles. I just didn't want to walk that so I went to a gas station and did my small resupply. 
Headed back to the hotel I saw Gadabout and his son Track Star. I met them in Delaware Water Gap at the church hostel. 
There's a BBQ place right next door to the hotel and they opened at 4. So 4:10 I was there ordering some food for lunch/dinner. 
Pretty much just relaxed most of the evening. I did clean out the debris from my tent, washed off my sleeping pad, flushed my water filter, aired out my sleeping bag, cleaned my cook pot/coffee cup/spoon, got my electronics all charged up. And that was basically my day.","Stealth Campsite 1400.6

As I was get getting breakfast I ran into Action & Adventure heading to the trail (met them at the DWG church hostel). Gadabout and Track Star were headed out to the post office.
Today is supposed to get up to around 75. Wednesday is supposed to get up to 90, and scattered thunderstorms in the afternoon. So tomorrow I need to get on the trail early to knock out some miles before it gets super hot and wet. 
Took another shower and then got all packed up. I left the hotel at 10am to start my 1.5 mile hike back to the trail, 65 degrees. Also, I'll pick up the trail right at the trailside zoo. So I think I'll take a walk thru there just to see what it's all about since it will be open when I get there!!
Got to the Zoo and it was open. I went ahead walked around the zoo to see what animals they did have. There were lots of different birds woodpeckers, owls, bald eagle ect. The highlight was I finally saw 2 bears!! I also learned that hiking through Bear State Park yesterday I hit the lowest point on the Appalachian Trail! Only 120ft above sea level. 
11:20 I left the zoo and headed to the Hudson Bridge. This is a pretty big bridge but there's a nice walkway across the whole bridge. I got to see a train go into a tunnel.. Ha, it's the little things. 
At 11:45 I've hiked about 3 miles thus far today before I finally made it to the actual woods part of the trail after the Town/Zoo/Bridge (basically walking that entire way on a sidewalk). My goal is right about 14 more miles to camp. 
12:05 I just climbed a 850ft uphill. I have 3 more 400-500 foot up hills before camp. 
At 2pm I made it to the Appalachian Market. They are open 24/7/365 and serve breakfast all day. It's basically a gas station with a little grill area. Got a bagel bacon egg and cheese sandwich, another plain bagel , coffee and a Gatorade. 
8.5 miles to go. Hoping to be there around 6 this afternoon. Back on trail at 2:45. 
At 6 I ended up stopping about 2 miles short of the camp I intended to be at but that's ok. I found a place right next to a stream and it's a pretty good site, basically right on trail. The campsite I was headed to was about a quarter mile off trail. At the last stream crossing (about 2 miles back) I met a father/son hiking. They started at Bear Mountain and this was their second day on trail. The dad is just here for a few days to help get his son dialed in. The son hopes to make it all the way to Maine but didn't mention going back and doing the southern 1/2 of the trail. I talked to them for about 20 minutes. Shared some of my experiences with them and gave them all the positive advice I could think of. 
8pm, I've had dinner and now I'm laying in my tent just waiting for it to get dark. I'm not sleeping with my rain cover again, I really enjoy feeling the breeze all night. My goal is to get up before 5am and be on the trail by 5:30. I'll stop a few miles in and make breakfast. There's a shelter that's 13 miles ahead. I'm going to try to make it there by noon/1ish. I'll hang out there at least for awhile when it's the hottest part of the day and depending on what the rain looks like I'll either stay there for the night or continue on a few more miles.","Fort Montgomery Holiday Inn Express

I have 12.5 miles to a shelter and once I get there I'll decide if I'm going to stay there or keep going. All depends on the temp and the expected rain.At 7 I stopped for coffee/breakfast. 3 oatmeal, coffee and a carnation chocolate milk pack. My stomach was actually growling!! I tried to do that pretty quickly also and was back on trail at 7:40.
By 9 it's already 70 degrees. It's starting to get warm. By 10 it was up to 75 degrees. I still have about 5.5 miles to go till shelter. 
10:30 saw action and an adventure they were refilling their waters. I ended up sitting down for about 20 min around 11am, 82 degrees. My shirt is soaking wet. I chugged some water and got back on trail. 
I was about 1 mile from the shelter and I crossed paths with a couple. As she was hiking towards me she stopped and asked if my name was Pagne. I said yes. We chatted for a bit, they asked About Pagne Senior and when he would be rejoining me on trail. As our convo was wrapping up I asked if I had seen them before. (I was really curious as to how they knew me and of my dad). Turns out they knew me from my trail journal!!! They said I'm famous!! How cool is that to be recognized out here in the middle of no where by strangers. That was pretty darn neat. They had started the trail last year and had to get off. This year they are just doing a some sections. Said they were embarking on a 5 week hike. 
Made it to the shelter at 12:30. It's 84 degrees! Action and  Adventure showed up about 1 and a girl named Beast showed up around 2pm. 
3:45, it's 88 degrees. I'm pretty glad I didn't push on. It's supposed to start to rain and have severe storms starting around 6pm. 
This shelter is right on a road.... There's a pizza place and a Chinese place that delivers here!!! I've been going back and forth with myself all afternoon about ordering. I have plenty of food, but some combo fried rice she does sound amazing right now.... 
This shelter is also my 700 mile mark!! I can't believe I'm almost at the 1/3 mark!!  
OK I totally ended up ordering some Chinese. Action and adventure got some delivered also! It was soo good. I shared some with Free when he arrived because I was so full. 
7:00 it just started to thunder and rain. Pearl, who hiked the trail last year and her friend were out for a few days in a hike and showed up at the shelter. So did Free. I met him at the DWG Church hostel also. 
There was a 4 ft black snake hanging around the shelter today. He seemed pretty nice. Ha.","Stealth Site 1419.2

Pagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638022,"Woke up at 5:45, still sounds like it's raining but it's the water falling from the trees. I got up and packed up everything except for my tent since it was still pretty wet I figure I'll do that last to let it dry out some. I made my breakfast, 3 oatmeal, coffee, carnation chocolate milk. Finally about 7:30 the sun was coming out and starting to dry my tent out.I was on the trail at 8:15. Action and Adventure were on trail around 7. I was the next to leave camp. Everyone else was still there. 
This morning hiking was a little harder since all the rocks were wet and there were alot of up hills and downhills. None of them were more than I'd guess 300 ft but with the rocks being wet, leaves fallen all over the place it made for a little slower of a pace. 
There's a deli just off trail in 5 miles. Just like with the Chinese last night. I've been debating with myself about stopping there or not. By 9am it was 70 degrees. 
At 10:20 I stopped for a bit I've done about 5.5 miles.. And.... I didn't go to the Deli! We call thay self control! Haha. 
12:15, stopped for lunch. I've one 9 miles. 8 miles to go. There's a shelter just off trail so I stopped in there for my lunch and to rest for a bit. As I was getting ready to leave Free and Action and Adventure showed up. Free skipped the Deli also but Action and Adventure said they did stop for breakfast. 
By 1:20 I was  back on trail. 
At 4pm I stopped because I came to this little lake. I had a snack and just sat there watching the water and relaxing. I only have 2.5 miles to camp. 
By 5:15 I made it to camp. The father son duo I spoke of 2 days ago were here. I was so confused as to how they got ahead of me. Turns out because of the rain last night they ended up going into town and got a hotel room. When they were dropped back off In the morning they skipped part of the trail to make an easier hike to this shelter. There are also 2 guys who were out for a few days hiking. They are from New York City. Nice guys. Around 7:30 out of no where this guy Ami, real name not trail name showed up with Dunkin Donuts and sodas. He's from New Jersey but was in the area helping a friend and decided to do some trail magic. He hiked the trail in 2019. Really nice guy, just had some extra time and wanted to be an awesome human. And a awesome human he was.

Pagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638060,"Woke up to a beautiful, peaceful sunrise today at 5:30. Got everything packed up, I didn't cook breakfast today because in 3 miles I'm going to come up to Tony's Diner. I plan to get breakfast there. They are open everyday from 3:30am-midnight. They do allow hikers to came on the property. 
On trail at 6:45, 51 degrees. At 7:20 I hiked by the biggest oak tree on the AT. It was Huge!! It has a diameter of 6 feet and is approximately 300 years old. Pretty darn cool to see up close. 
Made it to the diner at 8. It was 1/2 a mile down the road from where the AT crossed a road. Breakfast was amazing and cheap! I got a sausage egg cheese sandwich, a plain bagel with butter, 2 donuts and a coffee for $10! I at it all except for 1 donut which I'm going to pack out and save for later!! Free made it to the diner first then me then the father son duo. 
After breakfast I headed back towards the trail and made it by 10:30. Today there wasore hiking on the plank walk ways there was also another nicer wooden walkway. I had to crawl under a tree. There was a 1.25 mile long detour around a bridge that was closed. Free and I decided to take out chances and not take the detour. When we got to the bridge we both agreed we shouldn't cross it but there were plenty of stones in the water to cross without getting wet. I also made it to my 7th State!!! Connecticut!! 
Today is going to be a bit of a shorter day because it's supposed to start raining around 4-5ish. I want to be at camp and have my tent set up before it starts to rain. 
I've passed back and forth with another hiker a few times, today we finally exchanged names. He's Captain America. He has a pack with a big Captain America shield on it.
Made it to camp at 3:25. Rain in 1hr ish. When free and I arrived there were 6 guys all kind of huddled together. One came over(Silver) and said if we have any questions they are the guys to ask. It's 6 ridge runners and they are having some training this weekend. The ridge runner that I met in DWG right as I was about to leave town is here (Spatz)! Such a small world. I talked to them for a few minutes then actually began to feel rain drops so I quickly set up my tent and got all organized. By 4pm it was full on raining. Looks like it's going to rain all night and tomorrow morning. Clear up for a few hours then start to rain again tomorrow afternoon/evening and continue raining into Sunday. Happy Memorial day weekend, haha. 
I did find out that a ridge runner is someone who goes on trail for 10 days at a time. They answer any questions people have, are familiar with the area and shuttles. They radio in big things that need cleared from the trail (fallen trees, ect). They help maintain the shelters and the privies. I'm sure they have more responsibility but that's all I got before it started to rain. 
I guess the rest of the night is in my tent, watching a movie or 2. 
Temperature really dropped once it started to rain. At 3:30 when I got to camp it was 68 degrees now it's 48 at 7:45. Should get down to the low 40s tonight and there's some wind with this rain which isn't making it any warmer. Have I mentioned how much I love my sleeping bag and liner. So warm!!

Pagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638134,"**!!Welcome to Week 9!!**Woke up at 6, 44 degrees. I couldn't tell if it was still raining or if the wind was just blowing and making the trees rain on me. Finally got out of my tent at 6:30. It's still raining. Not hard but definitely still raining. When I got up free was up and packing up. He said he ended up having about an inch of water in his tent last night. Everything he has got soaked. I feel really bad for him. He's going to make it 9 miles to the next town and go to the laundromat to dry everything out. Even his sleeping bag was soaked. I watched him ring it out! Wow. My rain cover is obviously all wet but the inside of my tent and all my gear is damp not wet and it's mostly damp just from all the moisture in the air from the rain. The outside bottom 3 inches of my tent is all covered in mud splatter from the rain but again, it's all still dry ish. My shoes that I left outside of my tent are pretty damp and mud splattered also. 
The high for the next 2 days is 49 degrees!! Whoa! I'm definitely going to be hiking in my long underwear and my under armour shirt. Maybe even in my beanie. It's supposed to keep raining off and on all day today. I'm not going to get packed up yet. Since everything I have is still dry ish I want to try to keep it that way. I'm going to go get my food bag out of the bear box and make some breakfast in my tent vestibule. Hopefully it will stop raining for awhile and then I'll pack up and get some miles in.
On trail at 9, it finally stopped raining. My goal for the day is 16 miles, there's a shelter there and since it's supposed to keep raining I definitely want to be near a shelter. Depending on how much and when it starts to rain again there's also another shelter in about 8.5 miles. 
I didn't even make it a mile and at 9:15 it started to rain on me. Not a down pour, but definitely not a light sprinkle either. 
At 11:30 I stopped for a few minutes to take my pack off and make sure the contents are still dry I still have 3.5 miles to the next shelter I'll stop there and hopefully be able to dry off my tent and my sleeping pad inside the shelter. I might just stay there depending on the rain. 
1pm I made it to the first shelter. I'm going to set my tent up inside of it and hopefully it will dry out. At 12:30 ish it finally stopped raining for awhile. By 2pm it was raining again. I decided to just stay here for the night. Since it started to rain before I was able to get my tent fully dry and set up, it got even wetter as I was moving it outside to set up. Uggg.. Luckily my sleeping bag is still dry. Whoot!! 
5:30 it's been raining off and on all afternoon, supposed to continue thru the night and rain all day tomorrow. I called and got a hotel room for tomorrow night so I can dry everything out vs sleeping wet again. I don't think it will be too much of an issue tonight. Nothing inside my tent is saturated, just all very damp. There's no way my socks and shoes will be dry by morning though so that should be fun tomorow hiking to the hotel. 
Oh!!!! I found trail magic about 3 miles into my hike today. I got a few honey buns, cosmic brownie, a little candy, gronola bar, fruit snacks and a coke/Mt dew.. Those are going to be great for dinner!! The trail magic was inside of a trash bag on the trail. At first I thought it was just a bag of trash. Then when I looked closer I realized it was all unopened food!! While digging thru the bag I found a note that said it was trail magic. (yes I dug through it then found the note, you read that correctly, haha). 
I hiked with Yaks and Pneumonia for about 2 miles today. They stopped off a few days ago and took a train into NYC for 2 nights. Sounds like they had a blast. I was happy they passed me because their pace was faster than I was going and I enjoyed keeping up with them since it was such a rainy/gloomy day. It was also fun to hear about their NYC adventure. 
When I got to the shelter there was a guy named Frogger there. He was in a sleeping bag inside the shelter. He was an odd character. Not thru hiking. Just out doing some hiking and decided to take a Zero today. 
6pm making dinner and going to drink my sodas with it. I'm watching cliffhanger, great older movie!! I didn't take very many pictures today since honestly I didn't hike very far to see much and my phone was packed away inside of my pack to keep dry.","10 Mile River Campsite

Pagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638220,"Rained off and on all night. When I woke up at 6:30 my rain fly was almost dry, so it must have stopped a few hours ago. Got up and slowly got everything all packed up. It's supposed to be raining right now but it isn't. I only have a short hike to the road where I'm getting picked up to go to the hotel for the day/night.On trail at 7:45, 46 degrees. Made it to the road at 8am and it began raining right as I got to the road. I waited about 10 minutes for the hotel driver and was at the hotel and checked in by 8:30. Yes I only hiked for 15 minutes. Ha. That's my shortest Nero yet. I'm in a small town called Cornwall Bridge Connecticut.
At the hotel I saw Captain America and Rapture. I had seen rapture before but never caught his name. 
There's small restaurant 1 block away, I'm going to head there for some breakfast.
Got a toasted plain bagel with butter, breakfast wrap, blueberry muffin and a tiny tiny banana bread. Headed back to the hotel to eat.
Finally took my shower. I went to ask about laundry and you just give it to the office, they do it and drop it off at your room. How nice. Before I went for breakfast I emptied out my pack and set everything out to dry. Again nothing is fully saturated but everything is damp. Cleaned out my tent, flushed my water filter, cleaned my tent footprint, cleaned my cook pot/coffee cup, recharged all my electronics. 
Around 1 pm I saw Free walk into the hotel. When he walked out of the office he came over and chatted, said they only had 1 room left and it had 3 beds for over $200 for the night. Long story short I ended up letting him stay in my room on the extra bed. Cheaper for me that way also. He's been alot of fun to talk to so it should be an entertaining evening. 
The restaurant closes at 3pm so at 2:30 we walked up there to get some lunch/dinner. It's still raining, 47 degrees and supposed to rain till around 10am tomorrow. I really hope it's done raining by then because I have no desire to start out hiking in the rain, just to get all wet and have it stop raining. And I finally just got everything all dried out. 
Back at the hotel and basically just going to lay here in bed all night. All 3 of the John Wick movies are on TV so I don't even have to touch the remote or anything. I'm set for the night. Food, good movies and alot of laughing.","Mt Algo Shelter

It's still raining out and the breakfast place doesn't open till 8. We ended up getting up around 7, it's still raining outside. I went ahead and took another shower, got everything all packed up and we headed to breakfast. By 8:15 we had ordered breakfast. As we are sitting outside Soundscape and his dad drove up!! Soundscapes parents live about 45 min away from here so his dad had picked him up and he hung out with them while it's been raining the last few days. He was headed back to the trail tomorrow but he's about 4 days behind me at this point. 9:15 headed back to the trail. As we were leaving town we saw a guy who was looking thru a dumpster. Free went over to him, they talked a little bit and I saw Free hand him $20. The guy immediately walked over to the breakfast place and headed inside. Free said he was homeless and trying to eat out of the dumpster so he gave him some money for breakfast. What an amazing guy. We had about 1.5 miles of road walking to get back to the trail head. By 9:45 we were at the trail and of course it starts to sprinkle on us. Free took off down the trail while I was putting my rain cover over my pack.Made it less than a mile down trail and I caught up to Free. He was in the river holding his shoes crossing!! I walked the shore for about 10 min trying to find a place to cross without taking my shoes off, there was no where! So... My first river crossing. I took off my shoes, socks, gaiters and pulled up my long underwear. Crossed this freezing cold river and made it to the other side. After the river crossing I passed a local guy who said he's lived here over 40 years and Memorial day has never been this cold. 2pm, 55 degrees I made it to Salisbury. I had lunch at La Bonnes which is the local grocery store/Deli. I got a sub and it was freaking huge!! I ate 1/2 of it and I'll pack out the other 1/2 for dinner. In Salisbury there's a 92 year old lady named Maria. Maria runs a hostel out of her house and Pagne Senior has a friend Shaun who hiked the trail back in 2015 and stayed at Maria's. Maria is said to be the nicest person on the trail. He had asked if I could stop by and just check in on her, so I did. When I got to her house she greeted me at the door. She was really confused since I said I didn't need anything from her or to stay the night, I just wanted to check on her and say hello. We talked for about 10 minutes. Super sweet lady. 2:45 back in trail. This afternoon the trail was super wet and muddy, it slowed down my pace since I was having to walk around all this water/mud spots on the trail, trying to step on rocks and roots to get around. There was another small rock climb but I finally made it to camp around 5:30.At the shelter I found Drifty and Ruin. They are a couple of chefs so we hit it off right away all being in the restaurant industry.. They told me they had slept here last night also. They spent today trying to dry out their gear and warm up. They also said that last night a bear had come up to the shelter, didn't really bother them and went away.. Oh wow, I might see my first ""wild"" bear tonight!! I ate the rest of my sub and then made dinner. Around 8:15 I headed to my tent for the evening.","Cornwall Bridge Hitching Post Country Motel

I could only see it thru the trees so it wasn't really a good picture but the colors were amazing. Crawled back into my sleeping bag and went back to sleep till 6:30. I did not hear or see a bear last night. Either did Ruin or Drifty.At 6:30 I got myself moving and started to pack up my stuff, it's 46 degrees. Supposed to get up to 70 today though so it's eventually going to turn into a beautiful day! 
Made Breakfast and chatted with Ruin and Drifty for awhile. We all got along really well. Finally got on trail at 9:30, 54 degrees. I only have 9 miles to hike but I do go over 3 diffrent peaks today. 
Made it to Bear mountain which is the highest peak in Connecticut. 2,334 ft above sea level. It was beautiful at the summit. 
Next up was entering in to Massachusetts at 11am. That's my 8th State. Hard to believe I've touched 8 out of 14 states that the AT goes through, so over half!! It has been really cool at a few of the peaks/overlooks I've been able to look down on hawks flying around. It's just really something spectacular to see them flying around from above them. 
At 1:30 I made it to Mount Race. I stopped there and had lunch. From Bear mountain to Mount Race I followed along a beautiful stream. There were many little waterfalls and I'll admit, knowing I only had 9 miles to hike I went rather slow and sat down quite a few times. It was beautiful. 
Just before I made it to the summit of my third mountain, Mount Everett. Yaks, Pneumonia, Whisper hiked past me. We chatted at the top for awhile then they took off down the trail. 
There were so many places today where the entire trail was just a muddy nasty mess. I also didn't have a great pace most of the day because I was trying to keep my shoes dry and as clean as I could. 
I made it to camp at 4:30. Set up my tent, had dinner, and I was in my tent by 7pm. I started watching the movie Monster Hunter. I had been wanting to see that pretty bad. Wow. I feel asleep watching it. It wasn't all I had hoped. Lol. I'm the only one at this shelter. There's one about three tenths of a mile away, I think that's where the other 3 guys are. Also Ruin and Drifty were heading South. Today was an amazing day. The scenery of being at the different peaks, walking along the stream, walking along the cliffs was just awesome. Today was a very good day on the trail. I was also able to stop as many times as I wanted for how ever long I wanted knowing that I only had 9 miles as my goal for the day. Where I'm ended is the last shelter before I get to Great Barrington. So I have an 8 mile hike tomorrow morning to get to the road that leads into Great Barrington and then I'll pick up my resupply package and get a hotel room.

I have about 8 miles to hike into Great Barrington trail head, then 2 miles to the post office then another 3 miles to the hotel. I went ahead and made breakfast today since I won't be to town till closer to noon. On trail 7:30 and it's 53 degrees. Beautiful morning. So in these 8 miles there was about a 3 miles strech just before the road that was very wet, boggy, walking on planks then through a pine forest. The mosquitoes were insane. By far the worst they have been on trail, thus far I think I've gotten 2 misquote bites in the past 2 months. I was hikeing so fast through that part because I remember SaltLick telling me that when he did the PCT if he kept a 3.75 mph pace the misquotes wouldn't keep up, so I was hustling!! Ha. Today marks the end of my second month out here on the trail. How crazy is that! 11:10 made it the eight miles of trail to the road that leads into town. I stopped at the first breakfast/coffee place I saw and got a Carmel latte. Definitely wasn't a Starbucks quality. I even went back and asked for more carmel, ha. When I was getting ready to leave that coffee shop a guy came up to me and asked if I was Captain America. Haha. I've met Captain America a few times so I knew who he was looking for. He apparently had picked up Yaks, Pneumonia and Whisper this morning and brought them into town from the trail head.  Captain America had called to get a ride but the driver had missed the call or something. I walked for about 3 minutes more towards the post office and here comes Captain America! Haha. I told him what had just happened and he said he called that shuttle guy like 3 hours ago. He had been in town for awhile already. Lol. Walked by a Dunkin Donuts... So I went in. Got another carmel latte and the last 5 glazed donut holes they had. This one they also forgot the Carmel!!! But it was so hot I didn't realize it till I made it to the post office. Got my resupply package from Pagne Senior.  At 1pm I started the next 3 miles to the hotel, and I'm carrying a 8lb(ish) resupply box. Ha. It's 77 degrees. The downtown area where the post office was is a really cool historic area. Lots of cool little shops and there are antique stores everywhere!! Made it to the hotel, checked in and took a shower. I'm meeting my friend Karen I used to work with at the KOA in South Padre, and her husband John. That's my treat for the day!! I'm really excited to see them. They showed up about 3:30. They just moved back to Massachusetts. We sat outside at the hotel for awhile then went and got some lunch. I ended up getting some togo food for dinner also. Karen brought me some trail mix!!! Thanks so much for taking the time out to come visit with me, trail mix and dinner! We were together from about 3:30-7.While I'm thinking about thank you's. For the first few 100 miles on the trail I was able to find Starbucks. I haven't found one since I ubered into a bigger town from Delaware Water Gap. My friend Ray had got me a Starbucks gift card and said he wanted to take care of a few of my lattes. He even emailed Starbucks to see if they would sponsor me!! How cool. Thanks so much for the gift card, hopefully I'll find a Starbucks sooner than later Ray!! I'm going to take a Zero tomorrow and stay at the hotel for the day.

Pagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638464,"Whoa.... Let me tell you last night was the worse night I've had on trail and technically I wasn't even on trail. From 10pm-11am I was Sooooo sick. I think I got food poisoning from something I ate yesterday afternoon. That was horrible and I can't even imagine what I would have done if I would have actually been on trail in the woods in my tent!! So glad I had already decided to take a Zero today. I hardly slept last night and I felt so weak all day, also I was afraid to eat, finally at 6pm I walked across the street to a brewery and ordered a cheeseburger.I also have some other news... Going into this hike I had never done anything like this in my life. Yes I have went camping (at campgrounds) and yes I have done some day hikes. But never in my life have I walked to a random place in the woods, set up, slept, woke up hiked to another random place in the woods, repeat... When I started this trail I had no idea if I was going to love it or hate it. I can tell you now that I have loved it!!!! This experience has been such a wonderful one. All the amazing people that I have met and hearing their stories has been so great. Being able to actually see a few of my friends along the way has been so fun!! I've slept in a tent in the woods for 51 nights!!! I've climbed mountains, seen waterfalls, hiked through pastures, hiked through dense forest, hiked across rivers, I've watched hawks hunt from above, saw 2 bear (at the trail side zoo in Fort Montgomery), saw a Rattlesnake, saw 2 Porcupine, saw amazing sunsets and sunrises, been at so many just breathtaking overlooks. What I came out into the woods to achieve, I have. I have learned about myself, I've learned to be even more minimalistic, I've reinforced my feelings for not being involved in the rat race of life, and so much more. This has been an epic journey, but...  I'm done. Ha. I've walked in the woods along the Appalachian Trail for 2 months (exactly 2 months), I've hiked right at 800 miles, over 1/3 of the trail. I'm so proud of myself but I really just don't want to keep hiking 15-20 miles a day for the next 3 months. I do intend to finish the trail at some point in my life. I figure it will take me 4 months. I can do the northern 1/3 in two, 1 month sections and the same with the Southern section. Another thing that I have learned is that people do section hike the AT. I never realized that. Again I was and never have been a backpacker. If anything I was a novice day hiker. So you can imagine all the things I learned out here. Also the respect I now have for anyone who says they have done a long distance through hike. Wow. The physical and mental toughness of these people is incredible!!! Yes I'm sad to be leaving the trail but I've been thinking about this for about 10 days now. I really love everything about this experience, I just have no desire to keep hiking this much, every day, for the next 3 months. If I could stay out here and only hike a few miles everyday I would. But they call those vacations, not thru hikes. I'm happy, I'm healthy, I'm physically fit, I'm not injured, I didn't run out of money, it wasn't the food, it wasn't the weather, nothing negative at all, I've gotten everything I wanted to out of this trail and I couldn't be more proud of myself for what I've accomplished. I'm already looking forward to returning to finish these sections.
Compared to some of the stories I heard on the trail about hiking, I honestly had a fantastic and easy hike. I was healthy the whole time, I didn't have any gear issues, nothing ripped or broke, get this.... I never once had a blister on either of my feet!!! I talked to a few people who had multiple blisters by day 2 or 3. By no means was this an easy hike, I'm not trying to say that but my issues and problems were very minimal compared to what they could have been. I feel very blessed to have been able to have such an amazing experience out on trail. 
Pagne Senior is going to drive out and pick me up on Friday. We are going to make a little side trip to Niagara Falls. He took the family there when I was young, but I've never been as an adult. I'm excited. I'll be back in Indiana by Monday for sure and then I have to figure out what I'm going to do. I honestly don't know...
Thanks again to everyone who has been reading this. To all the comments, positive feedback, friends that met up, friends I've made, friends who have provided me with trail magic, strangers who have provided me with trail magic, ridge runners & trail maintainers, hostel owners, and just the random day hikers I would run into. Thanks so much for making this such an amazing experience I will never forget!! Never did I think that I would enjoy writting this journal as much as I did or that I would have so many visitors to my journal (Almost 28,000). I'm so happy I have this journal documenting my journey and experience. It will be great to look back through this and continue to share my experiences with others. 
I will continue to post a few more things on this journal site. I want to do a gear review of sorts and maybe a few other things. I do apologize, but your going to have to find something else to read for 5 minutes a day my friends.
