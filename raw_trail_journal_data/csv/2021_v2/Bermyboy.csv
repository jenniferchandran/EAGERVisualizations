Bermyboy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607542,"For the past two weeks I have been hiking almost daily with my full pack at the Broad River Greenway here in NC...this is fairly near my house.
I have only been doing a short 4 mile trek each day but the hills and slick mud trails feel very comfortable so far to the feet, back and body. 
I also have been at the YMCA four mornings per week exercising on stair master/elliptical/treadmills and weights and attending either weight/power training classes or PIYO classes for the past six months.
This has helped my strength tremendously as I under went back surgery in 2017 and it has been a steady but lengthy recovery.
Next week, weather permitting, I will be doing a hike with my son in the Pisgah National Forest near Brevard NC. We intend to hike and fish along wild trout streams for two days and nights.
We have already completed a similar hike last September and all went very well...this is partly what propelled me forward into making the final commitment to start the AT this year.
These two days of hiking next week will act as a final shake down hike for my expected start on the AT by or near March 28th.
As I am only section hiking through the month of April, I only intend to complete 200 miles from Springer Mountain GA to Newfound Gap on US 441 outside Cherokee NC.",,View Entry,"Mar 03, Sun",0

It was 30 degrees and beautifully sunny on the trail. The hike went well and it was great to bundle up to start with.
We met four ladies horseback riding on the trail and had a chat. One of the ladies is an AT tail maintainer. She said her team had completely rebuilt a privy on the trail but couldn’t remember the location.
I had seen her once before and if I meet her again I will get her contact info and maybe join her team in the future to help on a project somewhere on the AT.",,Sandyrun creek trail,"Mar 06, Wed",0
Bermyboy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607783,"Hiked this afternoon in hard rain and cool weather. Temperature was 42 degrees when I started. 
It was very muddy from all the rain and horses walking through the boggy areas near the river and the valleys.
Used just my Frogg Toggs poncho today...no rain suit to see how dry I would be. The bottom of my pants were the only thing wet to be honest.
I was wearing my neoprene socks so my feet stayed nice and dry even though the boots were soaked through and very muddy.
Body is feeling great on these shorter walks of about 5 miles. 
Rain is forecast for tomorrow but I plan to set out again into the mud pits...

Bermyboy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609165,"Drove up to Springer Mountain parking lot early and started out just after 8 am.
A beautiful cold clear morning and I hiked to Stover Creek Shelter where people were just rising and getting ready to start out.
Then I headed up the trail towards Hawk Mountain shelter all alone and adrenaline kicking in overtime. Climbed up to 3220 feet to get there.
Ate an early lunch after arriving and a few other hikers showed up.
Got to meet James and his son who are section hiking and saw them every day thereafter at camp sites.
Had some trail magic by Cooper Gap after Sassafras Mountain. Ladies  trail name was “ankle weights”.
She had hot dogs drinks and honey buns for all hikers passing by. I only had a few snickers bars as it was in the afternoon and I wanted to cook my own dinner at camp.
I then climbed up Justus Mountain on toward a Creek site where I set up my hammock and cooked dinner. I really walked way too far but like I said the adrenaline was pumping.... but I learned my lesson and decided not to do that  too many more times.
Having trouble posting photos but I will get them up eventually... sorry","Springer Mountain Parking lot

Great panoramic views as I hiked along Ramrock Mountain at 3200 feet.
I ate lunch at Woody Gap GA 60 crossing where there a pit toilets and then hiked up Big Cedar Mountain where Preacher Rock is located. Beautiful view from here but it was a hazy view today.
This crossing road of GA 60 leads to the nearby town of Suches GA.
Lance Creek was beautiful but became very crowded with hikers and I didn’t get a good sleep as they partied long into the night.
There these three guys from Minnesota who are carrying 12 foot spears... they are crazies ?
I’m going to stay clear of them from now on before I hurt someone ha ha?","Justus Creek

Bermyboy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609177,"Hiked from Lance Creek to Neel Gap which was 7.2 miles that felt like at least 15 miles.
Started out at just before 6am using my head lamp to guide me over three mountains before I got to the main climb which was Blood Mountain at 4457 feet ?
This a restricted area for camping as you must use a hard shell bear canister to store your food in and I don’t have one so move along quickly ha ha. I did hear a pack of Coyotes in the dark at about 6:30am but they never came close to me ...thank you Lord. Several other hikers actually left before me although I only caught one up after daylight on the second mountain climb.
This was a rediculous climb up and down Blood and I’m surprised more people don’t get hurt on the crazy rocks going down. It’s not a path but a free fall scramble trying to balance yourself with that backpack.
My feet just ache and when I walk without my backpack I feel like I’m drunk on the moon!! Honestly.
Because I did more miles than I should I am going to hold up here in the Blood Mountain cabins for two nights... then hit the trail on Monday morning. 
Don’t think I can keep up these high mileage days anymore... so I will reset and stay to shorter distances than what was originally planned.
Adrenaline has gone and my age and weak back are showing up... but no injuries thus far thanks be to the Lord with his watching over me and providing safety always ?","Lance Creek

Today was filled with some big climbs but rewarded with fantastic views.
Cowrock Mountain, 3842 feet and Wildcat Mountain 3637 feet were difficult but beautiful.
Ate lunch while sitting on a fallen tree on Poor Mountain then hiked to Low Gap Shelter where lots of hikers were stopped.
Passed by towards a small stream coming off the cliffs on a mountain side to collect water for the night at about mile marker 43.
Set up for the nights camp at Poplar Stamp Gap by myself tonight as nobody else stayed here. Total hike today was 12.9 miles.
During the night it was very windy and noisy as branches fell all around nearby. Did I mention that it was also very, very cold in the 20s...Anyway, it was a long noisy night with little sleep for Craig as the Coyotes howled away nearby in the Gap...oooowwww!!!!","Neel Gap

Hiked for 8.3 miles today over the most horrible section of rocks and boulders I have ever seen on my way to Blue mountain... this killed the muscles in my legs and I am hobbling now.
Ate some angel food at Unicoi Gap provided by a Baptist Church from Alabama. Caught a shuttle into Hiawassee GA to stay at Holiday inn for the night and eat a steak!

Hiked up to Rocky Top Mountain at 4017 feet right away. After descending down to Indian Grave Gap at 3113 feet it was up up again to Tray Mountain at 4430 feet.
Not much at the top but a lot of Rhododendron trees to see but there were a couple of vistas through the trees.
Ate lunch at Sassafras Gap all alone and it was so peaceful and sunny but cool.
Continued on hiking up and down mountains with the final assault over Kelly Knob at 4126 feet to finish at Deep Gap Shelter.
It was another cold night at camp.","Unicoi Gap

After four miles I arrived at Dicks Creek - US 76 and hiked to Top of Georgia Hostel to resupply my food supply.
This was a 1.4 mile round trip which didn't count for my days total on the Appalachian Trail. So 1.4 + 8.1 totaled 9.5 miles hiked for the day.
Rain was expected and of course more cold and wind so I decide to sleep inside my first shelter.
It was quite an experience being around so many people for the evening instead of being off on my own in the hammock.
There were a few older men from Louisiana who were just hiking for a few days on the trail that were loud, drinking moonshine on the rocks...yes they ice as well...and told lots of 'true' Southern tales!!
They were cooking steaks for all on the fire pit right in front of the shelter...and arguing about politics with all present.
When they finally went to sleep they snored so loud all night that even with ear plugs I had inserted into my ears there was no peace...yes I carried earplugs for such an occasion but they didn't work!
Several other men had some sort of stomach virus that was going around and threw up outside the shelter all evening...and now you know why I don't stay in shelters.
Had so little sleep that I got up early and left in the cold wind and rain at 6:30 am with my head lamp on to get me away...","Deep Gap Shelter

I left at 6:30 am using my headlamp to pass along the soaked, muddy trail.
After hiking 5 miles in these conditions I arrived at the unceremonius tree that has a wooden sign showing the state line for GA/NC.
I was very cold and wet but managed to take a photo which I will post.
Immediately into NC I had to hike over one of the steepest accent I have seen on the trail to Couthouse Bald summit at 4708 feet. 
It was slow hand over hand grueling climb up the steep gradient filled with boulders, rocks and tree roots.
I think I was close to... if not in hypothermia as I arrived at this treeless summit in the screaming wind.
A mile later I stopped in Muskrat Creek Shelter to get out of the rain try and warm up and eat lunch.
Then it was off for another 5.5 miles to finish at Standing Indian Shelter.
Everyone at the shelter that night agreed that Couthouse Bald was one of the craziest, windiest climbs to date...search it on youtube.
It was another cold night so I ate then bundled up early in the Hammock and waited for the sun to disappear.","Plumorchard Gap Shelter

Started out at 6:00 am and immediately climbed over Standing Indian Mountain at 5435 feet. Saw my first rabbit just after the summit.
Descended over the next few hours and 8 miles to eat lunch at Carter Gap Shelter.
Hiked on towards Mt Albert and after crossing a forest logging road US 67 found some trail magic...free food set up for all hikers.
Ate a few hot dogs, potato salad and cookies before setting to conquer Mt. Albert at 5250 feet.
This again was a very steep accent and rocky descent which took time and toll on the body.
Arrived in Long Branch Shelter exhausted and discovered I had Poison Ivy on my hands and 'other' parts of my body!
This shelter is on the side of a steep mountain so camping outside was tricky and difficult to say the least.","Standing Indian Shelter

Bermyboy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609855,"Hiked from Long Branch Shelter to Winding Stair Gap - US 64 just outside Franklin NC for a total of 7.2 miles.
It started raining at 4:00 am and it was of course cold and windy once again. I was meeting Donna at US 64 so we could take a day off the trail together in Franklin NC.
We were to meet mid morning and I was excited to be seeing her as this marked the completion of 100 miles hiking on the Appalachian Trail.
So I packed up my gear in the dark, cold and rain and set off at 5:30am...I'm always up early so why lay in the Hammock listening to the rain when I could be hiking in it, right????
After about a mile or so in the wet, slick, dark muddy trail I slipped, tried to catch myself by steeping forward and pulled my right quadriceps muscle.
Actually it was my Rectus Femoris muscle on the top of my thigh and it went !!POP!! very loudly as I tried to step forward and catch my fall...
Then the pain began...I cried in the dark, cold, rainy morning alone on the trail...honestly...no lie...
Anyhow after almost being sick to my stomach...I managed to stand erect and slowly...very slowly start walking along the trail. I say walking because I was no longer hiking.
It was knowing I was coming off the trail to meet my wife Donna that kept me going...moving... hobbling along up and down the two mountains before arriving at US64.
It was one of the toughest days ever for me physically and emotionally but like all these hard days and night on the AT I made it through with Gods help...I'm very pleased.
Anyhow, Donna drove me away after an emotional hello...and I am home now and have been icing my leg all day. I
 am planning a visit to the Chiropractor tomorrow to get some ultrasound on this damaged/torn...whatever, Rectus Femoris muscle.
This will delay my return to the trail for now as I attempt to get up and walking again on legs that can hoof around a 40 pound backpack over these mountainous trails.
Please stay tuned and offer prayers for a speedy recovery so that I can complete the remaining 100 miles that are planned...
Thanks, Craig","Long Branch Shelter

Bermyboy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609938,"So I have to admit that it is official today that I am off the AT indefinitely.
I visited Doctor Brad today and after X-rays and probing, poking and moving my leg it is confirmed that I have a second degree groin muscle tear in the Adductor Magnus Muscle region.
There is blood pooling near the surface of the skin on both sides of my thigh area and quite a bit of swelling.
I underwent laser therapy immediately and will return many more days for this treatment to help the healing process. 
I also have KT tape on my thigh to aid in strength as I attempt to walk...which is more of a hobble like an old grandpa that I am!
Have been icing the area but really what I will require is 8-10 weeks of rest, therapy and healing before I can start to rehab this leg and begin exercising again.
Consequently the doctor suggest I don't set any time line or goals of returning to the AT this season....sigh...I'm terrible disappointed as you can imagine.
However life goes on and all the preparation and planning and excitement is over for this year.
Thanks to everyone who has supported me and followed my progress through the first 100 miles of my hike and hopefully I can reboot myself for next year to at least complete the next 100 miles which includes the Smokey Mountains.
I am disappointed that this injury has kicked me off the trail but I still am able to realize that I did and can complete 100 miles of hiking while carrying that 40 pound backpack, which is my house day after day...
To all the hikers still out there, be safe, hike your own hike, slow down and enjoy the views and your time on the trail...each day should be cheerished as it could be your last.","

Lord willing, I am continuing northward and will try and stay healthy this time with no falls!
My thigh muscle is still completely torn and will remain that way forever according to the doctors I have talked with, so I have adapted my hiking to the permanent 'disability'.
I have an instagram account as well that I will post to more frequently with photos should you wish to follow...bermyboy60...as it will be easier for an old man to post my progress from there.
I have been hiking three times a week for some months now and while my leg is no where perfect, I feel I will be able to hike on the AT again just fine. I joke that my leg only hurts when I fall...duhhh! But its the truth...if I stay upright all is well but when I stumble on slippery mud or rocks it hurts big time...keeps me awake and alert at all times while hiking!!While I did write a planner for the first stage of hiking... I learned from last year to NOT bother trying to following it in its entirety...this helps with less stress to the already stressful hiking everyday!I am following the words of many previous thru hikers this year...hike your own hike and embrace the suck! There are many days of bad weather etc that truly do suck!So the attached photo is just a planner for my wife and others to see my short term goals as I hike northward.

Hike up to Siler Bald but it is windy, rainy and very cold so I don't go up to the side trail...continue on to keep warm.
It starts to thunder and lightning around me as I head down towards Wayah Gap Road. I cross the road...eat a bit of food in the cold...shivering, then continue on.
The trail up to Wayah Bald is flooded and muddy water is pouring down at me as I head upwards...
My head is down and I know snot is pouring out of my nose but the water is washing it all away so I ignore this obvious fact...alone in the rain!
I arrive at the top to see two hiker ladies...so I'm not the only crazy one up here after all!
Climb up the tower in the fog, rain and wind just to say I did it...yay!
Hike down into slightly less wind and on towards the shelter. 11 miles hiking today.
Arrive at Wayah Bald shelter by 2 pm and change my clothes, eat then get into my sleeping bag to warm up.
After a few hours the weather starts to clear up...rain stops and the sun peaks out for a few seconds now and then.
Other hikers are arriving now so I pack up my gear and move outside to set up my hammock and spend the night nearby the shelter. No germs and snoring humans near me ...
Cold and windy all night...The moon is shining brightly all night, though it disappears behind the clouds from time to time.
During the night a pack of coyotes howl nearer and nearer then there is a loud commotion, barking, yelping and howling for a couple of minutes...then quiet. Nothing more.

The trees looked like they were either burnt or dead mostly as you crossed several narrow ridges.The drop offs on either side went straight down several hundred feet or maybe even more...the trail is no more than 4 feet wide and narrower in some places.Its rocky and slippery as you hike down the Jump Off section so movement is deliberate and slow. Spectacular views down the valley and out westward towards the Smokies. Clingmans Dome is easy to see and appears closer than it really is.Down down down I scrambled with my 40 pound house on my back, but no slips or falls...thank you Lord!This was a truly amazing hiking experience, I shall never forget...everyone needs to do this section in the spring time for sure.From the Jump Off the descent is about 2000 feet and the knees sure knew all about that pounding rocks and trail.

Snowing sideways and trying to take some memorable photos on a phone that is frozen with fingers that are also frozen...get the picture...well there are very few pictures taken by me here...A couple of quick photos of what was not the best views this spot could afford on any particular day and off down the other side to try and get warmer out of the wind...I loved it really I did...what I saw and remember of Cheoah bald.The hike down towards Stecoah Gap hurt the old knees but got better when I reached a favorite camp site of the lucky AT hikers called Locust Cove Gap. It was finally a degree or two warmer here and the wind was only at 30 mph now...much better here indeed!Seems like this would be great place to hang a hammock or pop up a tent on a nicer weather day. There is a stream nearby as well. But Not today so... I hike on down some more trails and over a few more hills(mountains) to finally reach Stecoah Gap located on NC 143.I have to walk back up onto the trail as it is too cold and windy out by the road, I hide in the woods behind the biggest tree I can find while I call for my shuttle to pick me up. But.......Its over...and I have the sore knees to prove it once again...also the unforgettable memories of another awesome day that tested the very core of my body, mind and spirit. Thank you Jesus, my leader and inspiration!","NOC

Bermyboy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626991,"Started out at Stecoah Gap by 7am. It is warmer today 28 degrees, no wind and clear. Yes I actually got to see the sun all day today.Starts out so beautiful as I head to Sweetwater Gap a very nice spot for camping, but...One more mile out and I get to a place known as, Jacob's Ladder....drum roll please...This is an unbelievably ridiculous hike literally straight up the side of a mountain...no switchbacks and you are forced to use your hands and knees on the ground in front of you as you hike/crawl upwards for half an hour...I thought this could actually be a place where hikers would code out with a heart attack..my chest was thumping like mad and catching my breath was impossible even after I stopped...crawled and stopped again.Long story short I eventually made it up past Jacob's Ladder but here is the crazy thing about it...the hike up doesn't take you over the top of this mountain..no no that would meet your goal and sense of satisfaction for all that work...Instead the trail turns to the right and goes AROUND the ""near top""...about 50 yards from the top...yes, around to the backside of the mountain...soooooo...After all that climbing you never actually summit this mountain!If they wanted us to get around to the other side of the mountain to continue on, then why in Gods name didn't the trail makers just take us around at the bottom...just asking...I said some naughty things at this point, aloud...I admit it. God punished me as my phone was so cold, again, that it wouldn't come on or take any photos...I prayed, asking forgiveness and telling God, he and only he knows why there were silly Appalachian Trail makers on this earth...sigh...Hiked on to the Brown Fork Shelter but didn't stop as I was still fuming about Jacob's Ladder, so much for forgiveness, and cruised along some more PUDS, Pointless Ups and DownS...to Hogback Gap where I stopped to chat with four nice gentlemen who had camped here last night. One even had travelled to Bermuda last year..bless his heart. They were just about done with packing up and heading out in the opposite direction to me...southbound...yes, they were going DOWN Jacob's Ladder...duh?? Why didn't I think of that?? mmm down Jacob's ladder, okay next time...Said good bye and hiked some beautiful miles past Cody Gap a very nice spot to camp, and crossed Yellow Creek Road # 1242 and on up to Cable Gap Shelter.I had hiked 9 miles so I stopped for lunch...unfrozen entries today...yayyy,  and put my phone in the sun so it would warm up in the 30 degree sunshine. It worked...I had a phone to take some pictures with later on...yay!Hiked up some more mountains then got to a place called Black Gum Gap where I saw the most unforgettable view...Fontana Lake and Dam about 6 miles away as the crow flies. It was sunny as well.It was along 5 miles down, down, down, some 1745 feet and oh did I mention how my knees felt?Passed through Walker Gap where people camp and there is trail head towards Fontana Village, a hotel nearby, well 6 miles nearby if you walk!On down some more and over some beautiful streams and footbridges to make it to NC 28 and cross over into an area known as Fontana Marina. See photos of that.Another 1.5 miles of hiking to the dam, but also passed by the Fontana Dam Shelter known as the Fontana Hilton.There is sleeping for 20 persons, a solar power charging station and bathrooms...yes bathrooms and showers that are heated...and oh what a view of the Fontana Lake to boot...awesome yet again.Talked to a lady hiker here I had met at the NOC for a short time and then hiked on to the actual Dam where I waited for a shuttle to remove me from such an ideal, beautiful place.Eight hours and 16 miles of trails hiked today...not too bad a days work for an old man, I would admit that proudly and aloud to myself! Only by your Grace and Mercy was the possible Lord.Taking a week or so off to heal up my knees but I'll be back to take on the Smokey Mountains real soon...patience ye little ones, patience...so looking forward to seeing Donna, the love of my life.","Stecoah Gap

Bermyboy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628401,"So on this day in history May 26th 2020 I am doing another section hike north on the AT. Be sure to look at my photos showing the views on this trip...scroll/click back through to the first May 26th photo on the drop down list to see the chronological order.I would have rather started hiking where I left off at the Fontana Dam but they are still closed due to COVID so I am skipping that section of the Smoky Mountains till later on in the not too distant future, I hope!It is cool, foggy and wet today but boy was I glad to get back to hiking the AT!My wife dropped me off at Newfound Gap by 7:30 ish and after a quick potty stop it was off to hiking...and on to Charlies Bunion. Passed through Ice Water Springs shelter on the way which was cool, damp, silent and empty...I seem to remember reading about a man who froze to death here some years ago on a cold snowy night. Okay I moved on without delay to hiking north, but still pondering about the past events that may have happened here on a cold lonely night...The fog somewhat lifted by the time I arrived at the Bunion and it was beautiful as my photos would show.Saw one day hiker on the way to the Bunion but that was the last human I would see for the rest on the day and night. The trail is eerily empty as I hike through the fog but I am happy about this time alone!The PUDS continued towards Pecks corner all day with the occasional view as the fog broke along the ridges. Otherwise it was foggy, rainy and clammy all day long.Stopped for lunch and to fill water from a slow dripping moss covered runoff spot along the trail as there were no streams/springs from Ice Water shelter to Pecks Corner shelter which is 8 miles.Arrived to find that there is a 0.4...say half mile...hike down into the Pecks Corner shelter...ugh.That means there will be a half mile hike hike back up to the AT in the morning before actually starting towards Cosby Knob...yummy!Anyway, the shelter is way down in a 'holler' so it was wet, damp and very lonely during my nights stay. The water source was, of course, another hike downhill and then it was a hike back up to the shelter itself!I did that twice actually...in wet flip flops that will never hike with me again I may add..don't ask why, but I am realizing that I am definitely getting older...say no more...Prepared and ate my Mountain House meal of chicken terriaki inside the porch of the shelter to keep dry and a little warmer before bedtime.The wind blew hard at times during the night as it came through the 'holler' and up to the ridges above but it didn't rattle me in my hammock and tarp at all as I was tucked into a nice spot between the trees some distance from the actual shelter and bear cables for safety.The moss covered trees through todays hike were absolutely magical and although there were some downed trees across the actual trial that I had to climb under and over the hike was beautiful.To see the Lords handiwork is always so calming to me as I hike along in peace...a great day was had to be sure.Onto Cosby Knob tomorrow...","Newfound Gap

Bermyboy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628402,"Well after a windy night and a rainy early morning pack up its back up the half mile hike to the AT from Pecks Corner. Not a human for miles I reckon...Woke at 5:30 to dawns light and hit the AT by 7AM...exactly...ha ha! So its still foggy and dreary and light rain but I am in a great mood to 'get to hiking' as my buddy Happy would say on his YouTube channel each episode!Happy on the trail hasn't posted since he got off for the COVID break so I'm hoping he is doing okay and look forward to some future videos on his channel...but I digress from my own adventure...Hiked the 5 miles or so to arrive at Tri-Corner shelter. I off loaded the backpack and stopped to filter some water into both bottles as there doesn't seem to be many more water stops ahead despite all the rain. I learned my lesson yesterday after getting very low on water...still about 8 miles to Cosby and I'm not taking any chances today!So the thing about Tri-Corner shelter that is strange today is that while nobody is here in a tent or in the shelter there are several backpacks hung up in the bear cables! See my photos.It looks odd and strange to me that there are packs hung but no signs of any humans here...my hair is standing on my neck is I pack up quietly, quickly, sniffing the air for death about the area but all seems quiet, normal, as I get back onto the AT.Once again, as when I left Ice Water shelter yesterday, I am left pondering the seemingly strange circumstances along this lonely hike...I continue over Mt. Guyot but there in no sign of a trail leading to the peak as Guthooks and AWOL book shows...another oddity today! I stop several times to verify my location but no sign of a trail just Nottingham Forest all about!I decide there will be NO stopping for lunch today as it is wet, gloomy and I am moving away from anything back there...so to speak.I eat Snickers bars as I hike onwards and down the trail for the next 7 miles.I am listening to my knees as I hike down into Cosby, carefully placing each foot softly down off these two foot wooden stairs that some idiot has built along the AT...What could their dastardly plan be for a 5'2"" old man carrying his 35 house/backpack on his back as he traverses down each drop offffff step mile after mile? Dunno but I would like to have chat with the team of AT workers that create each hellish stair climb along the AT...what is your plan?? Then it comes to me as I struggle along...they are somehow related to knee surgeons...thats what it is... they are making sure their livelihood remains intact in the near future!Anyway, I arrive into Cosby Knob Shelter soon enough, and guess what, it is not a half a mile off the AT like last night!!??!! Thank you Lord!It is a very nice setting here with a view down the valley towards I40 highway I assume...through the fog...I set up my hammock someways down from the shelter and bear cables as is always the best bet then collect/filter water right beside the shelter.Dinner is on the porch at this shelter with Mountain House beef stroganoff which is delightful.No wind tonight and warmer as well in the hammock make for a great nights sleep and ending another wonderful hike on the AT.Alone again, naturally...mmmm, good old songs come to mind!Thanks be to my Lord for keeping me safe and happy one more day.","Pecks Corner Shelter
",Cosby Knob Shelter,"May 27, Wed",13
Bermyboy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628407,"Awoke at 5 AM to light rain falling and started to pack up in the early dawn light. Left the shelter area at 6:30 to try and get up to Mt. Cammerer as early as possible.Beautiful morning with a sunrise...the first I've seen in days. Hiked down to Low Gap then up the next mountain and side trail to the lookout tower at Mt. Cammerer.With the sun shinning beautifully today, the views up here were some of the best I've ever seen from such a high vantage point. The elevation here is 4948 feet.Don't ever bypass the hike on this side trail if the weather is good. The hike adds just over a mile total to your hiking day but is well worth the effort! I climbed up onto the towers porch and took photos all around with such sunny skies.The trail to the tower is very rugged and rocky, I can not imagine how it was possible to load in all the supplies needed to build the tower. It was difficult enough to scramble over the rocks with just a backpack on let alone move timber and tools as well to the site. Awesome achievement indeed to build up here in such a remote area.I sat and enjoyed the peacefulness, solitude and rested for over 20 minutes. I prayed, and then texted my photos and location to family and friends as there was a strong signal up here.An old friend from college days said she would be driving through the Davenport Gap area in a few hours and wanted to meet me down at the trailhead. She had been following my journal entries and has hiked all through the Smoky Mountains and beyond towards Hot Springs.So I sprung into action, slipped my house onto my back and started hiking towards the AT and then down the 5 miles to the Davenport Gap trailhead.This was a long 5 miles as it was slow going to save the knees as the trail was slippery and of course filled with gigantic steps...again!I also developed a blister on each heel...something that has never happened to me before on the AT. They were burning so I had to stop, take off my house, remove my socks and shoes, and put Leuko tape on my heels.My Altra Timp 1.5 hiking shoes that I purchased new in January of this year developed tears along the toe box area after just three months and some 150 miles of use. I had to send them back to REI via UPS and so I am using a cheap pair of sneakers I had for this three days of hiking...thought they would do okay as I had been doing day hikes in them but it was a bad decision!So limping along with blisters on each heel and careful of the knees on this descent made for a long morning into Davenport Gap to meet my friend.Not complaining though as this ended a wonderful three day hike and I got to see an old friend whom I hadn't seen in many years at the trail head. I had planned to overnight at Standing Bear Hostel then continue on hiking towards Hot Springs but these heels hiking in less than fancy sneakers were not having any of that...Rather than call my wife to come collect me I persuaded my friend to drive me back home. She was headed in my general direction so she agreed to drive me. Wonderful to have great old friends in remote places isn't it?They say that the trail provides, and so does the Lord always provide! Thanks for the lift home and that time to catch up and reminisce along the way my friend! Hopefully we can hike together sometime in the not too distant future.Keep safe everyone...and remember to check back because I'll be hiking north as soon as I get to REI for a new set of hiking shoes.

Bermyboy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633398,"My wife Donna dropped me off at the Davenport Gap trailhead at 6:45 am. I hiked from there and over the Pigeon River, went below the I-40 Interstate and started the climb up Snowbird Mountain.It took a couple of hours of steady hiking through the switchbacks along this mountain before I reached the top and came to the FAA tower. Took some photos as it was cool, windy and clear. I could see Max Patch to the north in the distance...some 9 miles ahead. I ate a snack and headed down the mountain towards Brown Gap where I filtered and filled my two smart water bottles from the trickling yucky culvert using a scoop and then ate lunch...meals on the go package. I didn't stop at Groundhog Shelter as I passed through. I knew it was big mile day for me so I powered past.Started climbing again and arrived at the side of Max Patch. It was very windy and cold so I put on some more layers before hiking to the top. There were no people at the top but I could see some below in the parking lot. I took some videos and photos in the cold wind then took off back down to the other side. The wind was calmer below and I removed the layers I had put on before. I hiked on down towards Roaring Fork Shelter without see any hikers all day. I arrived by 4pm and setup my hammock under some rhododendrons to protect me from the wind. Ate a mountain house, drank some hot mocha coffee and prepared for sleep. A group of 6 young through hikers arrived as I was about to sleep and set up in the shelter.Feet are tired but no injuries, so thankful to Lord for safety. I awoke in the morning to my thermometer showing 15 degrees but I was warm all night in my hammock setup.From the Islands to the Mountains...Go North Young Man, Go North...","Davenport Gap

My thermometer showed that it gotten to 15 degrees at some point last night or early morning.Left Roaring Forks shelter by 7am and stopped to fill up my water bottles at the nearby stream which had ice everywhere around the edges. It was a lovely walk in the woods along winding sections of the trail until Lemon Gap. The weather is clear and warming up nicely...shorts and short sleeve T for the day.The trail started up again towards Walnut Mountain with a meadow opening up just before the shelter. This was a beautiful spot with evidence of campsites before Walnut shelter, there is also a meadow just behind the shelter area. Then it was another hike down into Kale Gap before the big climb of the day up onto Bluff Mountain. Upon arrival you are greeted by some large boulders and a campsite... not much of a view because of all the trees.  I stopped here to rest and eat a Range bar for lunch. The descent is about four miles and takes some time for an old grandpa with tender knees. Eventually I reached Garenflo Gap where there is an old roadbed. I hiked on to a few small puds then eventually down into Hot Springs.The group who were at Roaring Forks shelter last night caught me up a couple of miles just before getting into town, going like a freight train....ohhh to be young again! I arrived and checked into Laughing Heart Hostel at 4pm...a long hike and I am tired for sure, but after a shower I walked into to town and ate a meal at the Iron Horse Station...Chicken Alfredo Pasta....mmm large portion and very tasty after a long day on the trail!

Bermyboy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633485,"Woke up early and had breakfast in the Smoky Diner at Hot Springs this morning with Big Cypress and Sub Man. Big Cypress drove me up to Allen Gap so that I could slack pack south to Hot Springs, about 15 miles. Got a late start but thanks to the free transportation provided by Big Cypress as my shuttle driver never showed! Hiked over the usual PUDS and arrived at Spring Mountain Shelter and stopped for some water...lovely place.Hiked on to the Rich Mountain tower and what a view was seen. Clear weather and I could see miles in all directions. Hot Springs looked so close but it was some 11 miles away. Passed several day hikers near the tower that were up from Tanyards Gap a popular parking area to day hike out of. Then headed down to Tanyard Gap where the AT crosses over US25/70 on a roadway/bridge that leads to Cross Mill ridge recreational area.This area was once private land that was donated to the Forestry and the AT goes right through it, sometimes we walk on a dirt road and it leads to a secluded pond which has been damed up to hold the water. There are benches here to sit and enjoy the quiet. See my photos. I never sat on the benches...maybe next time...ha ha. I passed Suds, 1/2 of  Two Peas and later Tie Dye Willie, all were heading north. Today I saw my first butterflies, two small orange ones and a mauve one, which are common to see on the trail as it gets warmer.I also saw pair of bluebirds and several robins walking along the roadside. It was a long, steep, tough rocky descent into Hot Springs...only one fall and another stumble but nothing hurt...this time! Thank you Lord. Arrived in town and walked right through to the other side and got a well deserved shower at the  Laughing Heart Hostel. Returned later to Iron Station restaurant for a Ribeye steak with sweet potato fries...it was very nice indeed.

Then, Big Cypress drove me to Allen Gap where I hiked north and he hiked south towards Tanyard Gap.It was tough hike that went uphill for 6 miles to the top of Camp Creek Bald. Up up up to Little Laurel Shelter about half way up, stopped for water ...then start going up again...to the top! 2530 feet UP! There are towers up here..but you are not allowed to climb them so I didn't take the side trail leading to them...duh...Hiked past Jones meadows and stopped for another water refill and a bite to eat near a beautiful piped spring and campsite in a small valley...absolutely gorgeous place. Wish this place was more accessible to visit...but alas I will probably never see it again. Hiked on and up to take a few phots at a lookout on Whiterock Mountain and Blackstack Cliffs...beautiful view southward. Passed lots of snow on the north side of the mountain as I hiked on...got really cool here, felt like the temperature dropped 10 degrees. Then it was a rock scramble/hike up to Big Firescald Knob. Scary climbing through large boulders and rocks while on a small ridgeline...plenty of big air below on both sides here! This was one of the...if not THE best views I have ever seen on the AT. Words cannot explain...it was like sitting on the top of the world...everyone should hike here once. I yelled down to the valleys below and heard my echo over and over...nobody yelled back?? Hmmmm? Alone here indeed. Peaceful.The views went on and on for 50 miles or more. Saw the Smoky Mountains wayyyyy in the distance and in to the town of Greenville TN in the other directions. Called my wife Donna and told her how spectacular this place was...Gods creation unfolded before me...WOW!! Glad to say I lived to see this view at Firescald Rock and Howards rock...see my photos. Stayed here for half and hour....no noise....no people just me and the Lord, looking at and taking in His handy work... Sadly I had to leave ...via huge boulders and rock scrambles down to the forest below. Safely though. More small PUDS into Jerry Cabin/Shelter area which was as usual, empty. Nobody came to the Shelter at all through the night. Peaceful. I set up my Hammock in the Rhododendrons once again as I knew it was going to be a windy night. As I ate my Chili with Mac Mountain House dinner as the wind started to pick up and then blew for 12 hours straight. It was really cranking all night but not a cloud in the sky. I didn't put up my tarp so that I could look up all night at the beautiful starry night sky. It was noisy but beautiful. The trees thrashed around and branches broke but I was safe all night. At about 5am next morning the winds calmed and then many owls started to hoot nearby, signalling their roosting time, it was my morning wake up call! What an unforgettable hiking day and peaceful sleep I had this day/night. Amen Lord...Amen.","Allen Gap NC 208,TN 70
