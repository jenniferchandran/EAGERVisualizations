Tweeking ....Today and Tomorrow will be spent tweeking prepared trail meals. We dehydrated & vacuum packed them in 2016, over did it of course & became famous for the tastey meals we left in hiker boxes. Some we grew tired of, some we didn't like. This time, more just go with the flow eating and snacking. We both lost about 50 pounds in 2016 and would like that to be the case again.
Yesterday, I made straps for our Therma-rest Neo Lite pads. We are using down quilts, with added zippers to zip together for one big bag. Fern will be sleeping in it with us. We did a little test to make sure we all fit. Yep! 
We registered with the ATC at 4:30am on Dec.1st. There were already 318 hikers registered just for Jan1 to March30...wow!",,View Entry,"Dec 03, Thu",0

Suds & I stayed together all day, with Big & Sub leading the charge. Then Tribe (Al), we kept him in front of us to keep an eye on him. He's in need of pack shake down & needs to sit in order to put it on his back. He won't tell us how heavy it is, just says ""you don't want to know.""
I started having some knee pain on the downs. I struggle with the log steps that have big drops where the soil has washed away. Suds gave me one her Chopat knee braces in the late morning, then her 2nd one later in the day. We have 2 Chopats in the camper, as I needed one in 2016, definitely didn't think I would need it this soon.
At the water source .4 from the road crossing. Kathy showed up while we were getting water, we saw her and Mike this morning on top of Sassafras. We arrived at Woody Gap & stealth camped at 430pm.

He had a black eye from a fall on Saturday morning. 911 was called & Tribe was taken to hospital treated for severe dehydration. Head & eye issues are ok, from the fall. Kidney function is ok. He'll stay the night. His wife is on her way to the hospital.  Prayers appreciated for our tra-mily, Tribe!

I really need to be conscious of not turning on the down, so as to put pressure on the outer part of my knee. Merry said she sort of does the same, so tomorrow we will all be analyzing our form. Packs, are all repacked and I will be carrying a 9# pack, as Big Cypress will be carrying my things for a while.

We all got up & ready, with a wonderful potato & egg breakfast. Fruit, donuts & coffee. Sent Tribe a message to see how he's doing. He said all is well. Numbers are back to normal & being discharged today. It was severe dehydration. Which is easy to do in winter hiking. 
Left Woody at 9:50am. The 5 of us left home base & the girls left Woody & guys took jeep & Subaru to trail heads to get off trail for the bad weather due on Thursday. 
Today was Preaching rock... beautiful weather. Perfect for hiking. Chilly & very light breeze, sunny! We stooped at about 11 for a snack at a campsite. The guys caught us! We visited, took pics & Subman & Big Cypress, along with Fern went on. We met again at the water source & camel'd water, made a plan to the sleep spot tonight. Decided it was Slaughter Creek Campsite, instead of Woods Hole Shelter. The shelter is half mile off trail, Slaughter right off trail & water on trail right before it, so it made more sense! Merry, Suds & I arrived at the Slaughter Creek water source. Got water & here comes Big, with Fern. Well...Fern found something to rub in & let's just say it wasn't roses. So, Dr Bronner's soap & cold creek water equals, Fern that can sleep in the tent & out sleeping bags, as planned!! 
Suds knee is doing well. Mine were as well. Until I sat on a rock that had a nice form, like a chair, for about 10 minutes. We snacked & watched a hawk soar in the valley between the mountains we were on & next to. When I got up & started hiking, my right knee, Decided it didn't want to cooperate. My butt was sooo cold, I should've sat on my Reflectix hydration/warming food bag, also used as my sit pad. As soon as my butt warmed up, the knee went back to being ok. Just whispering at my a little on the Downs. 
Today was a gorgeous & great day of hiking! Breathtaking views of God's wonderful creations! Even green little beetles struggling to get around & crazy colorful fungus growing on trees. Little birds flitting about & squirrels chatting to each other!","Woody Gap

We arrived last night to our guys with tents up & an attempt of camp fire. Wet wood, so no fire, just some burning leaves, But nice to walk thru the smoke...aka a hiker shower!! Yes, I absolutely LOVE THAT! I struggled to get comfortable, but ended up getting some sleep. We switched out to our 2016 tent, Big Agnes 3 person. Figured we would try it & see if more comfortable with Fern being 50# size. It was good! So, we head out. Merry wasn't ready & said she would catch up. Suds & I arrived at Blood Mountain shelter. Big Cypress & Subman were there 20 min before us. We took pictures & hung out inside the shelter for about 30 minutes. Subman put on leggings to cut the wind. Fern sat on the emergency blanket to keep her warm on the concrete floor. Big & I decided to head down the mountain. Subman went back to check on Merry. Suds started down the mountain. We were happy to hear that Subman stayed with Merry to navigate down. The blazes aren't well marked & there are a couple places one could easily take wrong turn. Especially since her Guthook isn't getting her location on trail. After Subman got Merry down the tricky parts. She was ok on her own. Big even put rocks across the trail, marking Do Not Go This Way & a branch across the other. The branch wasn't obvious enough & Sub caught Merry before she got off trail. 
We arrived at Mountain Crossing & Just Bill chatted & helped us get a few things. I got a new pillow, poly/wool sensor gloves and Smartwool boxer briefs. I realized my tooshie gets cold & it must be playing a part in my knee issue cuz as soon as my butt was frozen again (like the other day, from rock sitting) and my knee just starts ""talking louder' to me. Basically from all day as a whisper to really a scream. Then once warm butt, back to whisper. 
We got the Subaru & went to Mucho Caliente in Ellijay. Home at about 4pm. Pack explosions, showers, laundry.... the usual. Grateful hikers in the warm house & hot tub for freezing rain & snow possible in higher elevations. Happy to be safe & warm. That's been the plan all along.

So....home we stayed. Suds knee & my right one, would appreciate the rest.  Breakfast,  chatting,  Netflix & then Suds napped until 3:20pm.

Subman led, I followed & Suds brought up the rear. Big Cypress dropped us & took the truck camper & flat towing the jeep. He dropped the jeep at the parking near Neel's & took the truck camper to Hogpen Gap parking and then he hiked South. We saw each other on the trail about 11:30am. Orginally we were going to eat a hot lunch, but snacking was good & the trail wasn't conducive to hot meal. Big is a strong hiker & started hiking at 9:52am. He got to Neel's at 1pm, after an added .4 mile walk to the parking lot. Big drove to Hogpen and made hot coffee & Subman arrived about 2:30pm & Suds & I at 2:56pm. 
We had coffee & chatted. Subman n Suds resupplied their food bag. Tomorrow we will tent & then arrive at the camper for next sleep.
The trail was nice today. 1 or 2 inches of snow. Suds fell directly on her bad knee at Mountain Crossing. Some of the trail was icy & that was the first of many spots. Some muddy & some wet snow. The trees were covered in snow, it was so beautiful!! It was obvious that the wind was pretty strong during the snowfall, as the snow was hanging on an angle. So crazy & so cool. The skies were sunny, but the high today was only about 37°. We had a snack on Cow Rock lookout and took lots of pictures today! I forgot how hard the mountain climb was out of Tesnatee Gap. It was .9 miles of switch backs going into Hogpen. Actually, I remembered it was out of Neel's Gap, but it was up the trail, almost to Hogpen. In 2016, I recall Rabbit passed us & commenting on the quantity of switch backs. Let's say, too many to count.

We left the Hogpen at 7:55am under cloudy skies. Big Cypress drove the truck camper to Unicoi Gap & will hike south & meet us. 
We were soon greeted with snowie conditions. It seems to be snow pellets then snow flakes. That lasted about an hour maybe less. The trail was snow covered & hiking ""seems' easier. Probably because the snow packs down & fills in the gaps and covers the obstacles to some degree. We had some ups, and some straightaways and of course couple memorable downs, but nothing too awful. 
We passed Low Gap Shelter at 10:30am. Subman was surprised, every time he looked back for us, he could see us. He said we were doing well, even though we felt slow. From there it was only 2.7 miles to the sleep spot. 
We came around the mountain at Noon & arriving at the water source was Big Cypress & Fern, just a minute before us. It was past the sleep spot for Big & .3 more north for Suds, Sub & me. Big said he saw several deer. Later, a mama bear on the ground with 2 Cubs up in a tree above her. She didn't seem to mind Fern & Big's presence. Fern hikes with a tinkle bell, so mama bear knew they were coming, the reason the cubs were in the tree already! Big got one photo. They also saw lots of coyote foot prints & a rabbit. Suds & I heard a blue jay, that's the extent of our wildlife for today. 
Water was gotten, fingers were frozen, all in all it was a good day. We were blessed with the chunky type of rain (snow). Set up camp, changed into dry warm sleeping clothes. Heated water for Mountain House meals of Chicken Teriyaki, oh so delicious! Followed by a cup of coffee. It's 4:16pm, snow has turned to a light mist/sprinkling.

Left at 8am Arrived at Unicoi at 12:45pm.
We struggled last night, snow turned to rain. Snow on the ground and just all around wet, led to wet tents & damp sleeping bag tops. We all have experience tenting...we all vented well, but maybe being hold up from noon-ish until almost 8am played a part. Big Cypress & Fern headed south & the three of us north to Blue Mountain and Unicoi Gap. The trail was slush, yep, some areas as deep as 3 to 4 inches. Better that than the dreaded 3 letter word...Ice!
We left the gate hawling butt, up hill, because we were cold and once warmed up, dialed down a notch. A few ""car washes"" to start the morning. (That's what Big and I called the various bushes that keep their leaves & gather snow). Rocky sections were a challenge, due to slushy snow, that made it slippery. We were cautious and had a few slips and slides, but nobody fell! We made it to Blue Mountain Shelter turn off at 11:30am. where Subman met us. He went ahead to use the privy at the shelter & was surprised to see us as he was getting back on trail. Some big climbs today & going to Unicoi was a rocky slush mess, but quickly switched to just wet & leafy, big down. Praise The Lord for that. Our legs are fatigued more than they have been. Big was at the parking lot, he waited for us for a couple hours, even after needing to do car shuffling & hooking jeep up to flat tow. He and Fern are fast and strong hikers, sooner ya get it done, sooner ya can get off your feet! 
Spirits were little low this morning and since we are doing lower miles now & can't have a campfire or socialize without turning into hiker-cicles, Suds said she would like to use their camper also. This was our original plan back in October, but then we wanted more traditional thru hike. With Covid, many hostels closed, we wouldn't be wanting to use them even if we could, winter weather & not too much traffic on the trail for camaraderie, we will use campers as resupply & staying warm while not having to stay in our tents, flat on our backs. 
Until we decide otherwise tenting one, two or three nights then getting to the campers to regroup, resupply or whatever is needed. 2016 we embraced the suck, this time is slower with hopefully less aches & pains and more smiles!!
We arrived at home & few minutes later we were greeted with cheerful hello from Grambo. Subman and Suds talk of Grambo a lot over the years and we had never met, even though it feels like we already know her. She brought trail magic of Shanes BBQ ribs with the fixin's & even peach cobbler.  We were so hungry and it was sooo delicious! Grambo visited a bit, it was so nice to meet her and lunch/dinner was such a wonderful blessing!","Stealth spot at mile 45.5

After placing the truckcamper at Dick's Creek Gap, we all loaded into the jeep and head to Unicoi to hit the trail. The sides of the mountain that didn't too much sun and is cold & blustery, snow and ice were present. On the big up, leading to Tray Mountain required gripping devices. Big & I have YakTrax, Suds has a velcro strap for her midfoot, that has tiny spikes, called FANBX. Big didn't use his yet. Suds & I said we would have still been down at the bottom...the gripping devices really made a difference, like a HUGE difference for us. The guys were at the lookout at the top. 
At the bottom of the mountain we saw Butter. Subman n Suds know him, from prev hiking trails. He decided to turn around, and hike north with us & come to the house to visit. 
The trail going down from Tray was also icy. Suds and I played the ""velcro"" devices, put them on take them off game at least half a dozen times. 
At Steeltrap Gap we decided to continue on to a tenting spot at Sassafras Gap & John's Spring water source. The water was down the hill .2 miles.

The rest of the day wasn't too bad. Suds & I wore our snow grip ""velcro"", so we will stick to the mountain. There's more snow & ice, again on the not sunny, but good n windy n cold. 
The last 3-ish miles were down and the sky turned blue and the sun was shining the trail was nice going into the gap. Big last checked on us at 2.6 miles left to hike and went on his way, with Fern. We got to the parking 30 minutes sooner than I thought we would. We all loaded up, head to get the jeep. Butter was meeting us at the house. We needed to stop for fuel in both truck and jeep. I ran into Ingles for rotisserie chicken for Big, he was starving. He and Sub made it disappear quick! We got home at 2pm, showers, food, pack explosion.

Tomorrow Butter will hike back to Dick's Creek Gap, where he's parked. The climbs were tough, up Bly Gap & Sassafras Gap and Courthouse Bald. We donned our velcro devices, several times! There was a lot of snow on the windy side of the mountain, and where the sun doesn't hit the trail. The snow melted & froze, so it was kinda icy.

We departed this morning at 740am, under clouds & rain. The rain started about 4am. We had our oatmeal & coffee, in our tent. Big heated the water in the tent vestibule. 
The hardest climb was Standing Indian Mountain. It was extra rough because the snow was about 2 to 3 inches deep and pure slush. We had wet feet and wet all over from the rain. Thank goodness we are wearing 260 weight base layer merino wool. It really helps keep you warm even when wet. It the stopping and the gusty winds that make ya get cold quick. I wore my merino wool leggings with my insulated rain pants, worked well except the rain pants are little too big, can't keep them up and I drag the hem & even got caught on a root a couple times. No falls from it though, thank goodness! 
Traction devices were used, but still tough to hike, because it was slippery slush. Suds lost one of her velcro strap on micro spikes. It came off on the Standing Indian climb. 
There were a lot of down trees, mostly small ones that are easy to get over. The doosey was a big one that Suds and I needed to sit on and slide off from about 2 feet up. Should have taken a picture, but we were closing in on the sleep spot & that was the focus, get in and get warm. 
We arrived at about 4pm and Subman had their tent in camping area near the blue blaze for the water. Big Cypress had our tent in the shelter so it could dry. A perk of hiking early in the year, little to no hikers & no one else in the shelter. Big was struggling to get warm and I was still warm from hiking, so I went and got our water for dinner & breakfast and filling bottles. We hung our wet items to dry. The rain finally stopped mid afternoon. Packs hung, too. All Zippers unzipped so when a shelter mouse wants to nose around, it doesn't have to chew thru experience gear, just pop in and out.

We didn't sleep exceptionally well, as ""Jerry"" the shelter mouse (I named him, since we got a little close) was hungry & Big hung our food bag from one of the hooks with the plastic mouse ""preventer"" that are in pretty much all the shelters on the AT. We unzipped & had all potential curious points open. At about 1am we here plastic being gnawed....loud, hard plastic, that's the Opsak, Odor proof bag. I got out of the tent, grabbed a trekking pole & tapped on Big pack...little Jerry came up to the top & looked at me, I used the pole (after I screamed of course) to fling him off. He landed an Olympic style dismount & ran under the shelter. I took the trash compactor bag out of the pack with the Opsak inside, tied a loose knot to hang from a different hook & moved the pack to a different hook as well. No more issues. When we got up at 530 to start breakfast, Jerry had made a quarter size hole, but I stopped him before he actually got to the Kirkland Nut Bar that was closest to the hole. 
Today was a big day of hiking. The narrows, as I call it with great views. Mount Albert at mile 100. The first boulder scramble and force to be reckoned with. Suds and I took it slow and I did better than I had in 2016. After our pictures and celebration of 100 miles down, we started down. Snow & Ice, ""velcro"" was used. The hike was mostly down into Rock Gap. We were slower and tired, but did well arrived at the campers and our hubbies smiling faces at 4pm. 
Big Cypress and Subman arrived early enough that Big went to get the jeep. We loaded up and went to the next Trailhead at Burningtown Gap. 
We arrived at the FS Road to Trailhead, Subman was in the lead, he asked another AT shuttle driver about the road. They said it was good, it wasn't. We needed chains! Roy & his wife Gretchen live at the bottom of this road. Roy saw the jeep sitting on the side of the road, he came to investigate. Big disconnected the jeep & got it to the bottom & main road, only .2 away. Roy, asked if we had a problem, were we ok. I said we need chains, he had a brand new set of Emergency style. We already had our Yak Trax on & I walked them up to Big, then went to the jeep to sit & pray! Big Cypress backed the truckcamper down and only with God's hand we were back on solid ground & off the sheet of ice. The right side of that road was dirt & mud so, Big kept to that side which helped! We dropped Roy's chains off & offered to buy them, as one broke & one was missing & we looked but never found it. He refused & said they were new & never used them, but have a lifetime warranty, so no worries!
As for Subman and Suds. We didn't have a cell signal and it was 2 miles to the Trailhead. We decided to drive back to Franklin & sleep at the Walmart parking lot, where we knew we could call them. We finally had a signal while driving to Walmart, When I called Suds, she was so upset, as they didn't know what happened to us & the same for us, we didn't know their status. She was relieved that we got out ok & Subman walked down the 2 miles to see if we were ok. We all got a good sleep and we will figure out the rest tomorrow!

Big called several auto parts stores and O'Reilly's in Sylva, NC, was the only one willing to go the extra mile to get them in a matter of hours. 
We arrived at the bottom of the road. Roy drove by a few minutes later. I went and chatted with Roy and Gretchen, used their landline phone to call Subman to tell them, Big's on his way up with the chains. Roy told me the story of how he just got the Emergency Chains this past Christmas eve. A snow storm was coming & he ran to the grocery 30 min away from home & when he was 15 min away from the grocery it started snowing and it took him 3 hours to get home. So...he got chains for backup. Gretchen was feeding their chickens, afterwards she went in the house, Roy and I chatted a bit more and then, Roy realized that Big's new OR wool gloves were in the chain bag.

Subman was there when we arrived, after snacking, we all left at 11am, but Sub was soon out of sight, as he is faster. After an ok hiking day, on a light dusting of snow on most of our trail today.  We watered up from the piped spring at the Cold Spring shelter .2 miles south of our tent site. We had enough water for today, that we didn't need to stop for water earlier.
We met Preacher, hiking south, and chatted a few minutes. He knows the hiker, Travis, that preformed Subman and Suds wedding ceremony.

Then Left knee not whispering, but yelling, so Suds gave me her extra knee wrap to use along with the Chopat I was already wearing, and a Tylenol Arthritis! This took it down to, inside voice level of talking to me. The trail today chewed us up and spit us out, but....we survived and only had sleet falling on us for the last 20 minutes into the NOC. Thankful we made it safe and before the rain set in. 
Big and Fern had a good hike, he said. Arrived at the jeep at 11:20am and got to the camper at 12:20pm. Along with meeting us at the road, our guys made us food. Big made us shrimp & veggie stir fry... 2 servings went down fast and hot chocolate was just what I needed. Then, we had hot showers. The showers at the NOC are heated and super hot water!!

That's why we are watching the weather DAILY, not just for the Smokies.  ATweather.org is great and hikers need to know what they are heading into or what is coming at them. Subman took Pepper to Grambo's house, for the next few hiking days. Fern has been eating soft mixed with dry dog food. She's a picky eater, and this helps her eat more & not lose weight.  Pepper has been getting to lick the gravy from the soft container.  Yesterday morning or maybe the night before,  I put a splash of water in the Gravy & then added the juice to her kibbles....she then gobbles it all down, while Fern eats her own too.  We all re-packed our backpacks, got the rigs prep'd and waited for Big's new sleeping bag to arrive, UPS came and the new bag is amazing!  Mine won't arrive until next week.  Our next 30-ish miles will be hiking vehicle to vehicle. Thursday night rain/snow into Friday afternoon.  Not sure if we will hike Friday,  we shall see!","

We had a not so great, but better than tent, night sleep. The road is busy and a lot of people pull off in this parking area, to take photos of the view or... to puke! Yes, someone pulled off around 11pm and was getting sick right outside our open window....eeewww! The 4 of us took the jeep to the NOC this morning and started hiking at about 730am. We decided to hike together, because of the terrain and mileage, in case we couldn't make it the whole way. The decision was mine & Suds to make and we decided at Locust Cove Gap, 3 miles from the rigs, we were gonna press on and not tent it! The climb out of the NOC is 6 miles of climbing out of the gorge of the Nantahala. We saw Subman and Big Cypress n Fern at Sassafras Shelter turn off, Big had been there an hour, so we only chatted a few minutes and he and Fern went on because they were getting cold.
We found ourselves finally reaching the Cheoah Bald at the highest point for the day. Suds and I arrived at the bald under cloudy skies at 1:30pm. Snapping a couple pictures and heading down, it was cold & breezy on the top. Big Cypress stayed close by, keeping an eye on us. At about 4 miles from rigs, Big asked how we were doing & if we thought we wanted to tent or go to the rigs. After we told him rigs, since rain was impending and we were ok, we think due to snow covered trail as a cushion, even though it's harder to hike in, it does create less impact on feet & knees. Big Cypress and Fern hiked on and told Subman the plan & Subman waited for us at Locust and hiked with us until the last climb...which was a tough one at the end of the day too! Meanwhile, Big was doing the vehicle shuffle, which he's done with by the time Suds and I arrive. Critter Report: Big and Fern followed coyote prints in the snow off and on the trail, all day. One section included bear tracks, for about 8 miles. The bear even marked a tree or should I say, shredded it and scent marked the trail also! Fern had to leave her mark there too!","NOC - Nantahala Outdoor Center

We thought we were going to Zero today, because of the cold rain, but it gave way early-ish to sunny skies. So, we hiked out of Stecoah Gap at 10:10am. Big & Fern took the jeep to Yellow Creek Rd to hike south to the rigs. The struggle was real. Back to the rig for traction devices, water bottle malfunction...which resulted in it sliding down the mountain, Twice! So...we really started hiking at about 10:30am. The hike was good, snowie but good. Tribe went ahead and at about 12:30pm, we caught up to him chatting with Big. We all snacked, visited and went on. We took some pictures at the views. Suds & I took some funny ones along the way, like the meat stick ""cigar"". Yaktrax pretty much all day! Sunny skies & good trail, even with the hard ups! Like almost 90° angle up at Jacob's Ladder at mile 151.5 for about 6 tenths of a mile. We arrived at Yellow Creek Rd and the jeep at about 3:45pm. We stayed at Stecoah only long enough to download an offline map for Tribe. Big Cypress didn't waste any time to hook up the jeep so we could get to the Fontana Marina before dark. Before we arrived at Stecoah, Big heard someone talking...and making a video. When he knew he was done making the video, he opened the camper door to see who it was, it's Quicksand! We met and hike near each other on our 2016 thru hike up in Massachusetts area maybe. He's from FL originally and we've been watching his videos. They are really good! A lot of work and thought goes into each one and it shows!! Big invited him in while he waited for Lonny to pick him up. They chatted about 15 minutes, then he went to the Wolf Creek Hostel, also where Tribe is staying. Critter Report: Big & Fern kicked up a deer and saw lots of squirrels today","Stecoah Gap Rd

Snuggled till 6am and I prepared breakfast this morning and gave Big Cypress a break! He's so good about making breakfast, he feels the best in the mornings. We had water in our coffee pot, but just heated it for instant coffee & oatmeal. Subman had told Tribe to arrive at the Fontana Marina at 7am. We made quick work of getting ready, blessed with heated, real, bathrooms and at 730am, still no Tribe. We wondered if he got lost. I download Google Offline Map yesterday before leaving Stecoah, since there was good signal. Drooed 2 pins for him, the Marina and the Wolf Creek Hostel. Sub & Big went to see if they could get cell signal up the road to send text. When they came back, we decided to give him until 7:40am then we needed to go. The weather is going to turn from sunny to possible freezing rain later today. We need to get the 9.1 miles done & get the rigs out of NC sooner rather than later! We were loading the jeep & Tribe arrived! Thank goodness! Big Cypress and Fern head out asap, South bound and we took the jeep to Yellow Creek Rd. Started hiking 8:05am, under sunny clear skies! First stop for a couple pictures, Cable Gap shelter at 8:37am. The trail turned snowy, so Tribe, Suds & I stopped to put on our YakTrax. Today was Tribes 2nd go with them & yesterday we helped him put them on, but in order for him to be more self sufficient, we showed him how to get them on easier. * We stop at a good sturdy tree, if no tree, trekking poles stuck into the hill upside (never the downhill side, for risk of pole falling & sliding down the hill for God knows how far). Use tree or pole for stabilizing. Lift your foot in front of the opposite knee & put the trax over the toe & pull the trax over the heal. Usually you'll need to secure the sides, but it works better than removing pack or sitting & much faster!! When we take them off we try and put them in a location that we can get quick & without help. Suds puts on her waist belt & I clip with carabiner to a stretch loop.
We stayed behind Tribe. Stopped for wardrobe malfunctions...Suds shorts were twisted & wouldn't go straight...I stopped for a yodeling video & a good laugh! And couple pictures. At 9:30am we met Big Cypress and Fern...they were flying, as usual! At 10:30am we stopped to eat our wraps & take in the pretty view of Fontana Lake. Hiking and the trail were good today. Several rock scrambles, most covered in snow. One completely a sheet of thick ice. Thankful that a good sturdy tree was there to swing down the ice on. We wore our Yaks most of the hike into the marina. The snow was gone the last mile or two, birds were singing and the sky was cloudy. The temp was around 40 no wind. We arrived at the campers at 1pm. I changed my shoes, Suds used the potty & Tribe sat and had a snack. We had 3 miles to go, first mile switch backs & pleasant trail up and around the lake & when we got close to the Fontana Hilton Shelter, Subman was up on the hill singing to us. Big was at the camper when we arrived at 1 o'clock, he left the jeep at the boundary with GSMNP. Subman got the jeep key from Big to stay warm, while he waited for us. Once we popped out of the woods, it was 2 miles of road walking over the dam & to the boundary! We took lots of pictures and finished the hike at 2:45pm. Now... the wait - waiting for good weather window & snow melt in the Smokies! Our goal was to get to mile 167.5 by February 1st. Not too late, only 5 days!

Anxiety is high, the Smokies are no joke, especially in the winter. We head out & the trail was nice, but we went up all morning. Shuckstack came upon us fairly quick, we didn't go to the fire tower. Millie's Ridge shelter was quiet, Tribe tucked in fir a snack & to sit down for a few minutes. The area around the shelter has grown with briers, a single tail out of the ground with thorns. In 2016 it was more grass & open for tents. The trail turned into a frozen fauna wonderland. It wasn't snow, it was the clouds and or fog that blows thru and the cold high humidity forms ice on everything!! It was so beautiful, like walking in a snow globe!! 
We hiked into the shelter area, Big Cypress and Subman had tents up and dinner started. They were worried, because we were so late. Subman would walk south to check on us... it was a slow day because we lost our trail legs, from the Florida break.","Fontana Dam

We met several hikers today, Blue Beam a NOBO from California hiking SOBO thru the Smokies. He was doing 30 mile days. Then we chatted with Miss Bennett from Chicago area. She was hiking south for as long as she felt. We learned some local info from meeting Mr Bill Webb. At the bottom of the climb to Rocky Top & Thunderhead Mountain. He said the area we were in used to be large open fields. Now it's all grown up with various bushes & small trees. The skies were so blue, but the wind was fierce! 
Big Cypress, Tribe & I slept in the shelter tonight. The shelter has a nice stone fire place built in. Suds had a piece of fire starter, Big tried to start a fire and it was tough. The fire starter was perfect and I had a roaring fire in no time. Someone had gathered branches & twigs under the front ""porch"" of the shelter. We used a good bit & I put all of the remaining inside the shelter since rain is expected. At 730pm a hiker came into the shelter...I could only make out his profile from the trap covered entrance with his headlamp lighting up the area. His size & beard... I yelled out ""is that Trail Marshall?"" He replied, ""yeah, who's that?"" I said Moonbeam and we know you from your YouTube videos. (Trail Marshall Hiking) He hiked part of the Smokies when it was crazy deep snow! We had a good sleep, not too many mice. As Quicksand said, ""there will be offerings."" We left out our little bit of empty wrappers in the quart Ziplock, as a distraction to leave stuff alone.

When we hit the trail this morning, it was raining, then sleet. During the night it was snow & freezing rain. The wind were 45mph gusts, the tarp on the front of the shelter was a blessing and curse, as it made a lot of noise all night, but really helped keep wind out. I actually had to take my puffy jacket off, because I was too warm. Our new Western Mountaineering Terralite sleeping bags are all we had hoped they would be. Warm and roomy! 
So... attempted to leave at 730am, but I had to dig another cat hole & it was easier than doing it on trail, since I can leave my pack in the shelter while I went. This also gave Tribe time to put his rain pants on. It's gonna be one of those days...miserable & cold! Thank God it was a short miles day. I led the charge today, to try and get us out of the weather as soon as possible. Silar Bald was blustery & around that time, near Silar Shelter the weather started to turn sunny! Thank you Lord! We hiked some of the wet out of us. So much different types of precipitation today! CRAZY! I even had to take my gloves off to pee & wring them out to put back on! We arrived at the shelter to Big & Subman on the top floor, tucked into sleeping bags to get warm & dry clothes. If your hiking clothes aren't dripping wet, you can wear them dry, sometimes! Or put them in the sleeping bag with you to dry. I prefer the wear in the bag, to dry. Big's were dripping & he used Fern's 550 cord leash as a clothes line. (The reason for her to have this type of leash while hiking) Big's stuff went from dripping to wet. He wore his puffy jacket & pants to sleep. 
At around 6pm, Subman found a tent spot, so they moved outside. We stayed in the shelter with Tribe, until the army of mice, running 6 inches from our faces, took Big outside to find a tent spot. Near Sub & Suds. We talked until 9:15pm. Big Cypress is fighting a migraine, the talking helped the stress & anxiety keep him from getting to the puking level. The tent spot was nice under an evergreen, but we had some roots that required some puzzle making to sleep flat-ish. My backpack under my feet & the rest of my gear, mittens, rain jacket under my mid & torso. Fern's new sleep system has been working great too. She sleeps on a piece of Reflectix and my fleece layer with her down throw blanket in between us near our knees. Big Cypress's Thermarest XTherm started making a pop sound few times recently and well, today he has a huge pillow at the top where the sections seperated & now it's not keeping him warm from the snow covered ground. We used an emergency blanket as a liner on the floor of the tent to help. We are just happy to be out of the invasion of shelter mice!

The road to Newfound Gap closed after the extreme weather, but it opened up at 1:30pm. Suds had enough signal to check and then we text Subman to see how he & Tribe were doing. They were ok. We were 1.5 miles/hour hiking away from Newfound Gap. We called Big to see if he was ok & he arrived at 11:30am. We decided to do the vehicle shuffle, since it was going to be about 200 miles & several hours. The Great Smokie Mtn National Park is big, so... it is what it is. We are just so thankful to Big for going through the hassle for all of us. Subman hiked with Tribe and Suds and I were determine to get to the gap while everything was still frozen. The warm temps make the trail slushy & harder to hike. Even though traction devices are necessary, frozen trail is much easier than slush & mud. Big & Fern broke trail for all of us today. Suds & I stepped in his steps, which made it easier on us. One big boulder was too big a step, I decided to slide down it, we had about 6 to 8 inches of snow. My slide wasn't very graceful about the same as the other day. Sometimes butt skooting is better! Clingman's Dome was snow snow snow, and very windy, but with the road closed we had the park to ourselves, or at least just a handful of hikers. Which is so cool! Tribe & Sub took the side trail to the lookout, we opted to skip & press on. It was good trail. With the snow, soft on the long down. All 5 of us wore our yak tracks all day. So helpful and allows for faster steps! The trail in the Smokies is like a trench most of the way, which sometimes is a pain in the neck! Narrow & like a river of water at times. Argh!!! Suds & I took few breaks, ate our snacks while we walked sometimes to keep a better pace. We went so quick, we even zipped past a turn off for Mt Collins shelter! Suds got low on water & thought she might scoop snow into her bottle to let melt while we hiked, but I had enough to share. Some of the views around the dome were amazing and the 3 miles before the gap are thick with evergreen trees! So beautiful!!
We arrived at the gap took some celebration pics & hung out at the Gap waiting for the guys. About an hour after we got in, Tribe & Sub arrived, in good spirits. Jaymee is coming to pick Tribe up tonight, so he can gain some weight & also wait for warmer temps. Suds fed us and we visited while we waited for Jaymee & for Big Cypress too. Suds and I chatted with Larry from Michigan. He's interested in thru hiking the AT some day. He owns his own business & struggles with who will run it in his absence. Tribe and Subman arrived an hour after Suds and I. We had called Big at 1:30 and told him we were ok and the road had opened. He said he'd wait for us to arrive, but I said it's ok... get a head start and get the jeep. It took him 200 miles and several hours. Suds fed us and we hung out in their rig until Big got back from placing the jeep at Tobes Creek Rd at 730pm. Tomorrow is a Zero so we can dry wet gear.","Double Spring Shelter

I explained we are thru hiking and we had set up permission prior to parking and gave dispatch all our info, back on the 18th of Feb and again yesterday. The weather was supposed to be winter mix until 7am, but it never happened. Our morning was an hour of going up, with lots of ice. There are plenty of rocks to aid in navigating the ice. Then it was ups and downs and ridge walking. Suds and I stopped to snack several times, tinkle a couple times & for me to take my rain jacket off. It was pretty windy this morning, but tapered off as the day went on. At 12:30 we were pleasantly surprised to see our guys in the sun, resting & eating. The spot was perfect, grass, no wind side of the mountain and sunshine in abundance! We visited, they pressed on, with 3.5 miles to go and we followed at 12:45. This morning we saw several day or overnight hikers. They had talked with Big and Sub. We only chatted a moment & pressed on. Suds got water at Ice Water shelter and she was glad she did. I had camel'd a liter before we left this morning & drank one bottle & then camel'd again at the water source on the side trail leading to Peck's Shelter, our sleep spot for the night. 3pm, While we were on the spur to shelter, Big Cypress was coming up the trail to get water. It's 3 tenths of mile from the shelter, so a bit of a walk, and all up hill from the shelter. So tomorrow morning we will get warmed up heading out. The guys found flat-ish spots near-ish the privy, instead of going all the way to the shelter. There weren't really any tent spots near the shelter. Which is good anyway, since the shelter mice, don't necessarily stay in the shelter! We are sleeping in the Zpack Duplex tent for the next 2 nights. It's about 3 pounds lighter than the Big Agnes. We got a Jetboil stove, so we can save fuel & eat quicker. Wow is it ever faster!! We had Beef Stew for dinner. It's 5:09pm. Fern is in the bottom of Big's sleeping bag & my hand is frozen from typing. The trail was good all day. Ridge walking with spots of ice and some very narrow ridge, barely wide enough for you and your trekking poles. We are so thankful to be on the trail again. We weren't sure until Monday morning, after Suds ortho Dr appt. He gave her the all clear to hike. They went home to GA & we went to IN to pick up Oliver from my folks & thought we'd go out west, if we weren't getting on the trail. But, here we are less than 48hrs later!

Which was Great idea, and her tent was small with plenty of room for others to hike past her. Today was a day with about 5 big climbs. The last one 1.6 miles before out sleep spot. Destination was Cosby Knob shelter, but the guys found a nice spot just before the turn for the shelter, next to a stream. The trail had some ice and hard snow, where it had drifted. No traction was needed, just cautious steps. The skies were beautiful blue & sunny. After a very chilly & windy morning. Really the wind was a factor all day, but depending on what side of the mountain it was either, calm, dry, warm & sunny or cold, ice/snow & wind. We stopped at Tri Corner shelter at 11am or so for snack, privy and water. I had a signal so I posted a couple pics on FB, so everyone knows we are ok.

It was pretty good! So, this morning we had a Alpine Faire Mexican Black Bean & Rice with beef. It wasn't a conventional breakfast but good & hearty. We shared one meal, it was plenty to start the day. Sherpa popped in to say hello at 6pm last night on her way to the shelter. She had a good day, but said it was hard for her. We left camp at 715am & stopped at the privy. Started out hiking day at 730am. We had a gradual down to Low Gap and then a big up to Mt Cammerer. From there the trail was 7.9 miles of down. It's tough on knees, but we guard them with good form & use our trekking poles as stoppers or to slow us down, by putting them out front. We made good time zipping past Davenport Gap Shelter and reaching the N Terminus of Great Smokie Mountain National Park at 11:55am. We dropped our passes in the box took a few pics & pressed on. The trail was sunny warm and dry. The guys met us at the Pigeon River bridge, at 1pm. We chatted a minute & crossed the bridge and did our road walk to the steep steps to the last big up for the day. Finished at 1:30pm. Big Cypress, Fern & Subman met Dan, from Ohio. He came to the Pigeon bridge to do trail magic, but never saw any hikers except the guys, Who didn't need anything. The conversation was magic in it self, giving all of them renewed faith in the kindness of strangers & humanity! Also, the guys met a UPS semi truck driver at the I-40 ramp and his job gives him an hour lunch break & he uses it to hand out tracks (pamphlets telling you about Jesus and how He loves you) to hikers at this spot. We loaded into the jeep, and made our way to the Gas Station & Subway for food & fuel, on the way to Newfound Gap. We drove thru Gatlinburg, holy moly was it a mob scene....lots tourists. We arrived at Newfound & in less than 15 minutes we were on our way. We had made the next few days plan while driving. The weather is going to be in our favor, so we are staying stinky hiker trash & moving rigs to the next spot to keep on hiking north. The driving was long today, but worth it.

We look like hiker trash & smell like it too. Today's trail was nice terrain, but a lot of big & steep ups. We pressed on & kept our pace.

We were greeted in return, ""at least you have one good knee between ya!"" I'm wearing 2 ChoPat knee braces & Suds is wearing 1, well actually 3 devices on one knee. We meet Miss Linda, she is section hiking and doing this area. We chatted a bit and ran into each other again at the top of Bluff Mountain. After Bluff Mtn is a very long down! At 0.4 miles from the jeep, Suds son called her. So...her I sit on a log waiting for her. Miss Linda calls out, ""are you ok?"" I reply ""yes."" As she passes by Linda said ""I thought you abandoned her. I felt like on the farm when the sheep or cow starts to walk in circles. They do that just before they die."" ""In case Suds starts to circle, lol."" The trail was amazing in the morning, we seemed to be flying, then it turned a bit narrow, and on the edge of the hillside and more rooted after Bluff. We had a good day none the less. The worst was a blow down that fell from right to left. We had to navigate the right side that is now super steep & very narrow above the now giant hole on the left where the root system used to be. We managed! Praise The Lord!
We would have arrived at the jeep at 230, but did at 3pm. It took 40 minutes to make the drive to the rigs at Max Patch. We loaded up & hit the road for Hot Springs. Arrived around 5pm & made quick work of chores, laundry, filling water jugs, etc... then I visited with Timber & Turner aka Just Not Florida. Caboose is the live on premise Manager & he with those two & Ice Age are helping him with work for stay. Laundry done at 8:15pm, time for bed!","Max Patch Rd

We had a rough night sleep, well Fern and I did. I finished laundry and got to bed about 830pm last night & Fern got up at 1130pm and was acting weird. Not scratching to go out, but just sitting at the door. I took her out and she tinkled. Then refused to come to bed, for almost 45 minutes. I got up and fed her, she chow'd it down and then I took her out again and she pee & poo. Now it's late & sleep interrupted... I didn't want to get up early, 645am alarm to be at Smoky Mtn Diner at 7am. Big was up at 5am and Fern and I were NOT happy. Breakfast of the Southern Living Magazine famous, Skillet Breakfast! It was amazing and Big! Eggs and toast on the side of smothered potatoes. I couldn't finish it all, but I'm sure Big Cypress can have as midnight snack.
I washed our bed linens and Big took Fern and headed south on the trail at 915am. We finally got in the jeep to drive to the Trailhead at 10:10am, started hiking at 10:40am. When we were just getting on trail, who do we see coming up the trail, Butter! He got dropped off in the end of the Smokies and caught us, to hike with us a while. The trail was nice, not too many roots n rocks. Suds and I hiked for almost an hour up hill. I struggled from lack of sleep and Suds being behind me, could tell without me saying anything. We stayed close proximity to Subman and Butter. We greeted Big and Fern nearby each other, but seperate, at about 11:30am. We hiked on and saw Butter & Subman at about noon. Suds and I hiked and didn't take any pictures and arrived at the rigs at 1:30pm. At about 3pm we went to the outfitters and grocery, gas station and Dollar General (DG). Butter was doing laundry and got a shower after he was finished and we w were done too, we went to the Smokey Mtn Diner.","Garenflo Gap

Suds and I decided to skip breakfast or at least the trip to the diner. The guys went at 6am, too early for us, even though last night I fell asleep within 5 minutes of the 630pm national news. So... we were spoiled and the guys brought us breakfast at 7am. Big and Fern left for hiking at about 8am. He took Bermi-boy to Alan Gap first so he could hike South back to the hostel. He had a shuttle scheduled to pick him up at 730am, but it was no show. Subman left at about 9am. Suds and I did some journaling & pics posting to TJ & FB. We head out for our hike at 10:15am. The trail took us through town. The train went by, but it was past by the time we got to the tracks. Daffodils are blooming. We took pics of Blue Forget Me Nots, blooming near a couple water sources. We even saw a brown butterfly and a few tiny sulphur or butterfly. The hike up to Lovers Leap was strenuous as expected, but we managed as always. We got worried at 11:16am as we hadn't crossed with Big & Fern. So we took phones off Airplane Mode and right away got a text from Big Cypress saying he's at the rig and he must have missed us, when he ducked off to tinkle. We passed Bermi-boy at about a mile from the jeep. Suds & I enjoyed a few minutes snack at the pond. We saw a few day hikers also. Arrived at the jeep at 1:40pm. While on the bridge going over the highway a semi truck was coming and we got him to honk for us. Sub was disappointed now cell signal at the gap, so he was bored. Another jeep was parked & left a rubber duck on an Adventure, It's from NM. Kinda like the painted rocks, fun & cool. Once back at the rigs, we went for ice cream and I got new dirty girls afterwards at the outfitter, then to DG then back to hostel. I wanted another pizza, but it was 2:50pm, they close at 3pm. Oh well! At least we had 3 pc left over from last night. Showers, jeep hook up, water refills, phone & bricks charged then visiting with Caboose, Timber, Mule & Bermi-boy. Some of the other hikers were out front on the lawn getting haircuts... too funny! One from Maine, got 80's style or Flock of Seagulls style, even with a cropped tank top! 7:28pm, past hiker midnight and the plan is to leave by 7am to drive to the Trailhead at Tanyard Gap.","Laughing Heart Hostel/AT Trailhead

We Left the trailhead at 7:40am and we stopped a few times for clothes removal and water stop we hiked 3.3 miles by 947am.
We saw Big Cypress and Fern at their 6 mile mark. We visited a minute and then we all pressed on. I struggled today, due to lack of sleep with seasonal allergies and post nasal drip and sneezing in the night. Plus after much up and down, I finally got up at 1am and took Fern out to the bathroom. She pee'd and poo'd quickly and then it took me a little while to get back to sleep. Nice weather, not too bad trail, big ups & downs. Arrived at the jeep at 1:15pm. Went & got the rigs, hooked up & moved to next spot. Quieter road & better parking area.We all repacked our gear, as tomorrow we sleep in the woods, for one night. Butter popped out of the woods a few minutes after we arrived at the trailhead. He visited with Sub & Suds a while & then hiked north. We had sardines n crackers with Tabasco as an appetizer. Then for dinner we had potato mix up. It's 620pm & this chic has had it. Fern at dinner at 4:40pm. Tried to get her to poo, but only pee'd a few times.

We left the rigs at 7am. Started hiking at 730am. Some steep ups this morning. Saw Timeout from NC, with his pup Charlie. He camped with JT and we arrived at Little Laurel Shelter at 10am with 4.8 miles hiked. Snacked with everyone including Mule, from NH. We stayed until 10:30am and had a hard time with the climb. It was a big climb and stopping makes your trail legs have a hard time gettin' going again. We made good time. We saw JT at the tenting area, by the piped spring 4.8 miles from the shelter. Suds got water & we went on. The Whiterock Cliff trail is closed for the Pergrin Falcon's nesting. It's on the way to Big Firescald Knob. Which is a ridge walk with some rock scrambles. At the top is a great view, one side is the wilderness of NC and the other side is towns & stuff of TN. We visited with Timeout and Charlie they were enjoying the sun & having a snack at the memorial at the top, At Howard's Rock. I took a pic of Charlie napping on Howard's Rock.
Suds and I stopped at 2pm, after taking 1 and a half hours to go 1.5 miles at the Big Firescald Knob ridge walk. We stopped at a big flat rock that had cell signal to post a little bit to FB & upload our Trail Journals. We got to Jerry's Cabin Shelter at 3:25pm, greeted by Big & Fern who had 9.3 miles of hiking and arrived at 10:30am. Mule & Timeout were there. Dinner was a Peak, Beef Stroganoff. It was delicious!! While we were eating the 6 showed up. TinTin, Madeleine, Smiles, Double Young aka Picky and  Aspinock an Algonquin name for NE Connecticut And Pippin' they are tramily and we were all at Laughing Heart Hostel at the same time. Big visited with Bermi-boy for a long time this morning, as they past each other on the trail. He saw several people today, some thru hikers Spoon & Wolfpack.
Critter Report: several Dark Eyed Junco, lots of Woodpeckers debris from dead trees that must hold lots of delicious bugs. Highlight of the day was a big white tail doe, she was on our right and was pretty close to the trail & us as well. She didn't stick around, she was off in a blink.","Allen Gap

Left camp at 7:10am. The trail was up for a bit, that's usually what happens when you leave the shelter area, then super nice and then rollers, but pretty smooth. Subman was with us until the big butt rock. We took a few pics & he sped away. There were a few bigger size rock scrambles & then later a few small-ish rock scrambles. Kinda like PA rocks, without the points & edges sharp enough to slice meat on. The trail also had areas covered with leaves. These areas are a struggle because you don't know what toe grabber or ankle twister is lurking, hidden under the leaves.
We played leap frog with Timeout & Charlie. As they stopped to poo (Charlie) & eat snow (Charlie). Mule passed us by around 9am. Going the big up towards the Flint Mountain shelter, Aspinock passed us. Then when we got to the shelter Subman, Mule & Timeout were there eating. We didn't stop for long, just to say hello and we kept going! We cruised along and at 1.5 miles from the rigs Suds wanted to text while she had signal. Sub said he'd hike with her. I did the 1.5 in about 40 minutes and arrived at the rigs at 11:10am. We are feeling like thru hikers now, as Suds put it. We have been hiking at 1.5-ish mph, but today's time was 2.3mph. It really depends on the terrain of the trail. Big Cypress and Fern arrived at the rigs at noon. They did the 12.1 at 2.7 mph. The skies were dramatic for Big on top Big Firescald Knob, rain in the distance and difference kinds of clouds. He spoke to John, yesterday & today. He's Retired Army and they chatted a bit. Big also talk CVS, she got her name because she has a Medical kit/First Aid from CVS and that's how she got her trail name. Big Cypress and Fern also chatted with several section hikers. At the rigs, it was showers immediately and then food. Egg sandwiches & Newfoundland hot cocoa. Followed by snacks of various types. Then repack for tomorrow's hike and then we visited and talked about the next few days with Subman n Suds. I took Fern to tinkle & visited with weekenders out hiking. They moved on after a snack on the grass. Then John, popped out of the woods. He's waiting on a shuttle. It's 4:16pm, tired hikers resting their bodies to the sound of a chain saw and the occasional car. The air smells like rain, it's a cool 58° and overcast. John said it poured rain a few times on his 14 miles today. We only had a light mist fall on us a couple times.","Jerry's Cabin

We averaged 1.8 mph. Big arrived at the rigs at 10:45am. We sat in the jeep for a few minutes to update the socials and I called my sis, Julie. Suds & I were slower today because of steep ups. Plus the trail was a little slick with mud & leaves. We had a laughing fit about 11:30, laughed so hard we almost pee'd our pants. We literally had to stop to pee, so we wouldn't wet ourselves. All due to a tiny thing resembling a rat with long white hair, but it was a dog. Suds said not all dogs can be as pretty as Fern. Big saw Mule, Airdrop, FreebirdSuds & I saw total of 8 day hikers going south, group of 4 men, husband and wife and then the 2 women the the dogs. Once at the rigs, we didn't waste any time & hooked up to go into Erwin to Tractor Supply for propane, fuel up rig & jeep and to resupply at Walmart. We were going to wait until we got closer to Erwin, but had the time and I'm sure we will go again in few days. Plus we ate at the local Mexican restaurant and boy was it delicious! We moved the rigs to next sleep spot back in NC from shopping in TN. We've been on the border bouncing between the 2 states for a while now. Pretty soon we'll say goodbye to North Carolina. We aren't very excited about the time change and losing an hour of sleep. I don't really think it's the loss, more of the adjustment to the new wake up time. Our guys tend to get up anywhere from 4am to 5-530am. Subman even came over to our tent the other day at 4am, for coffee emergency....he forgot to pack theirs. The weather held out and was foggy & mysterious today. No rain, but we did have ""tree rain"" drops of dew or fog build up falling from the branches. We saw waterfalls or cascades really. Lots of moss covered things.
Critter Report: The birds were very active all day. Mostly the Robin's, but Juncos, Woodpeckers, maybe a Nut Hatch or something tiny that clings to the tree like a woodpecker but with it's head not necessarily in the up to sky direction.

She said ""remind me, why I keep seeing you?"" Big said he's a BoBo. Yes, a NoBo hiking SoBo. Ramdino coined that phrase, for thru hikers that use vehicles to hike north.
Suds and I arrived at Big Bald at 11:30am. Subman was there too. We took some pics and had a snack & kept hiking north. It was tough ups today. Some steep, some root infested, some rocks. Then some amazing trail, like a sidewalk. The worst was the narrow path on the edge. It makes you walk awkwardly & my left foot and achilles are sore. I put some pain cream on them and took some Tylenol PM to help sleep tonight. One good thing about the little bit of rain, our seasonal allergies are not as bad. I believe it was all the dust we've been kicking up, especially since our feet are so dirty, when we remove our socks & shoes at the end of the day. One bad thing about the rain...mud. There was some very muddy sections today as well. We stopped at 2.1 miles from the rigs and ate our last snack & Suds wanted to check the socials. After 25 minutes of log sitting, it's hard to get the legs going again and on an up to boot. The last big up for the day to High Rocks. There's a section of easy rock scrambles, but we weren't expecting them and they slow us down a little. It wasn't the only rock scrambles today, there were a few, but mostly rock ""steps"" the trail maintenance clubs have put in place. We arrived at the rigs at 3:55pm. With our stops for pics, snacks & socials, we did pretty good. Plus, the downs were sometimes steep & we slow down to protect our knees. Subman got to the rigs about an hour before we did.

There was a lot of leaf litter, that always hides toe grabbers or sticks that roll under foot or that you step on one end, it lifts & catches your other foot. Bam...booby trap. We haven't been falling, just tripping and our trekking poles keep ya up right! It's just makes your nerves sketchy! We took pics of the river & Erwin from up top and arrived at the jeep at 12:45pm.

We were thankful that the train only went past once during the night, as we were parked next to the tracks. Our Orginal plan was to hike 10.5 to the Beauty Spot, but after 2 hours of driving around to get to it from different roads, we had to hike to Indian Grave Gap. All the Forest Service Roads were gated. I was worried that we hadn't seen Big and it was 10am already & no sign of him & Fern. So, I took my phone off airplane mode & sure enough, a text from him at 9:27am. He had the issue with parking. Thank God it was just that, I was worried he got hurt. We pray every morning, before we hike. Asking in the name of Jesus, to please keep us safe, keep Big & Fern safe, guide our steps & watch over us and our loved ones at home. We had sprinkles on our heads most of the hike today, but made good time & the trail wasn't bad, so it was a good morning of hiking. We arrived at the jeep at 11:30am, Suds named it Bumble Jeep or just Bumble.
We got to the next trailhead and I saw to thru hikers, while I was digging my morning cat hole. The one said, ""watcha mining for?"" ""I said it's for the morning"" and he said ""well aren't you a planner."" Later, while I was making salmon for dinner I saw a smile and wave from a young lady hiker, it's CVS. I finally got to meet her. We had dinner and went to talk about the next few days of hiking & what our plan looks like. Thursday is supposed to be thunderstorms so we will zero that day & rest. We haven't zeroed since Newfound Gap since the Smokies. It's 5:55pm, we are all tucked in for the night. The sun popped out for a few minutes. The sky is overcast, but it hasn't rained since this morning.
Fern ate her dinner and went to do her business when I took her out, so hopefully she sleeps all night. It's been a good run of not getting up in the middle of the night, Praise The Lord!

We froze this morning, I struggled at keeping my fingers from hurting from being so cold. My gloves didn't dry completely, so that didn't help matters. After about 30 minutes and the climb we warmed up enough to remove our fleece layer. At 930am, we saw a happy dog and her man. Big said he knew we were close, because Fern started getting excited. We chatted and Caruso hiked up and said good morning. We haven't seen him since GA. The trail was icy but rocks helped feet stick to the mountain, when we got close to the Roan High Knob shelter we decided to Yak up, it made us more relaxed hiking, that we weren't about to fall with every step.

The sun was a welcomed sight today. The rain & cold yesterday was hard on hikers brains & feelings about staying on the trail. Caruso said his hiking fam sent him messages that they were calling it quits. Hiking in damp gear was something we try to avoid & thank you to sunshine today...all gear is dry! Praise The Lord!
Tomorrow is going to be our longest mileage day. It's 6:05pm, getting colder. It's supposed to be around 28°. Feeling tired, Fern is already asleep. We've been blessed that she eats her dinner about 430pm, then poops. So...no middle of the night potty trips!","Hughes Gap

Big & Fern left in the jeep about 650am and started hiking at about 745am. They had a VERY difficult morning with hours of climbing in elevation. 5860 feet of elevation gain to be exact. The weather was cold, we woke to 31°and very windy. Gusty & sustained winds. Subman hiked with us all day. We had a very worn out trail, loaded with frozen deep mud. It's extremely popular with locals & tourists, we've seen several cars from Florida even. We climbed up & over Jane Bald and saw Big & Fern at 10:30am. Everyone was too cold to dilly dally, so quick kiss & we all pressed on. Big did say the balds in our near future, blustery & ""put on everything (clothes) you have to stay warm."" He was right. I even had to wear my mittens that had toe warmers stuck in them. The climbs up Little Hump & Big Hump, were frozen trees prior to the balds. As the fog all morning had enough moisture to freeze on the trees. Little Hump was more photogenic and not as high and we did take several pictures. Big Hump on the other hand, squishy mud, hard to walk upright from wind & walking on the side of the trail, which is grassy & bumpy. No stopping for pics. We did meet to NoBos Not yet from Canada. He got the Covid vaccine & started a thru hike last year, but had to go home & is back at it this year. We also met & leap frogged several times today, Tall Son. Towards the end of our hike today, we met Madison from GA doing a FlipFlop, started in Damascus. Big said he saw too many people to count, and the only thru hiker he can recall seeing was Tall Son. The trail became better & the weather got sunny & warmer. We arrived at the jeep at 3:40pm. Big arrived at the rigs at 12:50pm. Our longest mileage day was a struggle. Mud is slick as ice. Sub fell once & Suds twice. I slid a couple times, but stayed upright. Suds helped me in the climb today. I was having a hard time catching my breath, the wind was taking it, as well as the climb itself. We slowed down until I got back to normal. Blessed that we all arrived safe & happy the Humps are in the rear view. Met Mr Lynn Gillum Waters and his date in the parking lot at Carver's Gap.","Carvers Gap

We made arrangements prior to parking. Subman n Suds, are friends with Shannon & David and they are all looking forward to seeing each other. We didn't dilly dally & Big dropped us off at the trailhead at 19E and we started hiking at about 7:40am. Big then drove north to Walnut Mtn Rd to hike south back to the rigs. Suds and I stopped for water at about 9am. Suds needed to hydrate. While at the water we met Robert aka Close Enough from Roan Mtn gonna hike from Springer to Roan starting next week. He was out for a day hike to the waterfall. We also saw, Not Yet & Tall Son, they are hiking together with Viking Man, who we haven't met yet. Then later we saw Skelator. Today was a nice trail surface day, Not too many roots n rocks. We had a pasture walks & we were serenaded by cardinals. We hiked along the Elk River and the daffodils are blooming bright yellow. We had our meeting at about half way, 4 for us and 6 miles hiked by Big & Fern. They did well and Big said it was kinda like a walk in the park. We moved along, passing the cemetery and then the Buck Mountain Baptist Church, where we can use the outside spigot to fill water jugs. I filled Suds bottle for her, so she didn't have to walk the extra across the road. I had camel'd up a liter this morning and was ok, as my 2 bottles were still full. As the day went on, the sun was shining. We saw little blue/purple butterflies and also a Queen butterfly. The temps went higher than we've seen so far, maybe about 60°. I was ready for the hike day to be over. Suds said ""mother nature"" must be bi-polar. Yesterday we were freezing to death & today we are sunny n hot and sweating to death. It's like the weather, just went B A M...it's spring!
We arrived at the jeep at about 1:30pm. Drove back to Mountain Harbor and showered and started chores. The usual, laundry, water refilling (jugs & camper), showers, rig tidying up, dumping trash & eating. We waited until 4:30pm for the food truck to open David, runs that! We met Zig or Ziggy and Chains, husband and wife who stay in the tree house & do work for stay. We ran up to the DG at about 3pm, To get the rigs replenished with staples, we were running low on. We had a lovely evening listening to the ducks quack and the river flow, right outside our door. Soothing!!

Two Peas - Moonbeam & Big Cypress ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633823,"Today was an unplanned Zero. We wanted to get the most famous and voted BEST breakfast on the AT. Mary, the original owner/operator with Shannon, David put on an amazing and delicious spread. Three young hikers actually arrived this morning, after hiking 31 miles, just so they could be here at 8am for the feast and then are zeroing today, to have the breakfast again tomorrow, before they hike on. After breakfast I chatted with Shannon & Mary. Mary's husbands lived/stationed in Newfoundland for 2 years with the US Military. He absolutely loved his time there & Mary said he spoke about it for their 50 years of marriage. She has since seen the 9/11 Documentary about Gander hosting the stranded travelers and understands her late husband's love for the little island in the Atlantic. I know we LOVE Newfoundland, and the friends we've made there and can't wait to return! We've been the last 3 years and Covid ruined plans with dear friends from La Scie NL to travel to Ireland together. Hopefully things get back to normal sooner rather than later.
We took the jeep to Elk River Falls, a short walk from the parking lot. It's a nice waterfall & it was suggested not to be missed. We left the rigs at the hostel and when we returned hooked up and head for Dennis Cove Rd. Trailhead. As soon as we parked there, we met Mike (USAF) who owns KOA in Pueblo CO (not Pueblo South) with Stowe, his wife, who is trail supporting with truck camper, not every night, but often. They keep seeing the rigs, and Mike was surprised to see us when we arrived at the Trailhead this afternoon. We chatted a while and he hiked on. We will probably see him as he is doing low miles as well. We went up to Black Bear Resort. Miss Linda & Travis, have an awesome hostel. We stayed here in 2016 and rented the Overlook cabin then and it's still as amazing as it was back that Easter weekend. This hostel is quiet and not a party place. The resupply store is well stocked. Small fuel canisters trail & meals. We hung out and chatted with Linda this year and had a pizza and ice cream. She took us around in the golf cart to give us the grand tour. They have 23 acres and WiFi & landline phone. Lots of tent camping along the creek. Cabins and RV campsites with partial & full hookups. They even have a house that sleeps 12 and a weddings/ reunion room that holds around a 100 people. This is all separate from the hostel part of the property. Suds and I sat and planned out the few days ahead going into Damascus and a way to avoid hiking a 20 mile day, into Damascus as it's a long down for us, but it would be a long up for Big and Fern! 7:39pm now and I hear a Phoebe bird singing, the frogs croaking and the creek sounds like wind blowing through the trees.

We woke to overcast & 53°. Forecast is high of 67°. We left the rigs at 6:50am, started hiking at 7:55am. Big and Fern started hiking at about the same time we drove away. We stopped to gas up the jeep along the way.
When we all hit the trail it was sprinkling a bit, nothing major. Pack covers were on our packs. Suds & I started out with our ponchos on, that lasted about half and hour or so. It started to get too warm and it wasn't raining, so no sense in it. We saw Big Cypress and Fern at about 10:30am. Chatted a few minutes, snacked while standing and talking and then continued hiking. When we had about 2 miles left we saw Subman, he was on top of an area that had signal, so was taking advantage of it. I haven't been fiddling too much with the socials or texting while hiking lately. Suds & I arrived at the rigs at 3pm. Big had made us fajitas and it was ready to put in the tortilla, when I arrived, boy were they delicious! I got a quick shower and changed into my non hiking, hiking clothes. Still hiking clothes, just not prev hiked in, so not stinky! We went over to talk about the next rig move. We were going to go park at Wilbur Dam Rd, but The AWOL Guide says no overnight camping, picnicking, or lingering between Road 321 & Wilbur Dam Rd. Critter Report: Suds and I heard Eating Bird at 8:32am and another one little while later.
At about 830am, we met Sundance from N.VA, he's 67yrs old & started 17 Feb, he was hiking south, slack packing, from USFS 293 back to 19E and Mountain Harbor B & B. We said he's Platinum Blazing. Then around 1:30pm, we met Frosty the SNOBO started Oct 15, 2020 from NH. He will do the Whites & Katahdin after he reaches Springer.At 6pm, I saw Plantsie & Mr Miyagi. They are tenting along the Creek, behind the rigs, tucked in the rhododendrons. We sat with them at Mtn Harbor at breakfast. Along with Fred & her mom. Maverick & Goose, her dad n brother sat in the kitchen area. Big Cypress and Fern met NOBO's - Care Bear, Jeff, More Energy, Doolittle and No Plan. Big's right knee has been talking to him, Along with Suds knee, Subman's cough & hard time breathing on the up hills.

Big Cypress and Fern left, at 6:40am, in the jeep to park at Wilbur Dam Rd. We left the rigs at 7:20am and Laurel Falls was first on the agenda. Lots of boulder rock steps and pictures were taken of the falls. Then...we lost the blazes and just went in the general direction we remembered. Well, we followed a worn path and pretty much bush wacked our way. Then...we saw the trail off to our right. Frustrating, but we made it. The trail was ok, considering, we had a long climb. It had lots of switch backs, so that helped. The clouds turned to mist (930am), then to sprinkles (10am) then to off & on showers around 11am. We had a signal at 9am, I got a text from Big saying he would be late seeing us. He parked & started hiking and went about 2.5 miles and got to a shelter...he realized he should not be at a shelter and went north instead of south. So, 5 extra miles of hiking and not too happy! Suds & I saw Jersey a thru hiker, slack packing to Black Bear Resort and then we saw 59'r, from NJ. He's almost 80 and been hiking the AT since 1959 and has about 400 miles left to finish. The rain was a pain. We camel'd and got water at the summit of the big climb at 11am, just as it was beginning to rain a bit more we started hiking again. The rain & terrain didn't make it easy to stop and enjoy a snack or drink or pretty much anything. So...we hiked on! Trying to make up lost time from the bush wacking at the falls this morning. Around Watuga Lake was pleasant trail. Then a road walk over the dam, we think we should be at the jeep, nope! 0.8 miles to go and back into the woods & rock scrambles & now just plain over it, tried chics want to be done, dry & warm. Plus, there were a few rolls of thunder around 1 and 2 o""clock. We got to the jeep at 2:45pm, cranky & wet. Then we get the rigs hooked up, go into Elizabethton to Tractor Supply, for propane and to Walmart. After town stop we arrived at the new sleep spot at 6:15pm. Cat holes dug for morning, Fern potty break, shower, rotisserie chicken from Walmart in our tummies, Fern's too. 8:12pm, rain falling, well past hiker midnight, which is 7pm.

Our longest day. The weather was beautiful today. I was not in a good place. Suds asked me if I cried last night, I said no, why do you ask. She said you aren't taking any pictures, you don't seem to be enjoying the hike. I said I'm not, I don't want to be out here anymore. I just want to hike to the camper and be done. I'm over it. We listened to some music and it made me cry. We saw going south, Plantly & Mr Miyagi. They got a shuttle from the hostel to hike south, back to the hostel. They are excited to have their son and 2 grandchildren coming on the trail with them in a few days, for a few days of hiking. Later we met Onward a Section hiker from Harrisburg PA. Then at the Nick Grindstaff memorial we see Jersey. We chatted a bit, mostly Suds and him. I wasn't as chatty. We were glad to see him safe n sound, yesterday he was hiking in the bad weather late in the day.
We hustled to get to the rigs, we heard there was trail magic. We didn't want to cook. Big Cypress said he would trail magic me and made us cheese burgers for dinner. I got a shower and told Big how I was feeling. Not as concerned with the destination, feeling like the journey is more important and I haven't been enjoying the journey the last few days. I feel like I'm letting everyone down, feeling like this, because everyone wants to get to Katahdin, especially our husbands. Suds gave me encouragement today, that remember it's hard, we knew that from the start and we will make it!! All the way.","Wilbur Dam Rd

The 3 of us hit trail at 7:25am. The sun was up for a few minutes. We strolled thru the farmers rolling pastures and took lots of pictures this morning. The weather is supposed to turn and thunderstorms are expected about noon. We hiked at a good fast pace, sometimes a 20 minute mile. We stopped for water & treated it, not filtering to save time. When we had about 2 miles to go, we could hear the thunder quietly rolling, it was off in the distance. But at about 1 mile to go, it was on us. The lightening was too close for comfort. I was taking longer strides and Suds stopped to put her poncho on, later she said she was almost running to keep up. She told me to go!! So, as I'm struggling to know if it's better to curl into a ball to avoid being a target for the storm or just keep going, I kept going and there is a shelter, I didn't realize was coming up & I jumped inside, barely damp, as it really wasn't raining yet. Then I see Suds coming and then the sky opens up and it's crazy rain, then hail just as she makes it into the shelter with me. We had a signal so we text Big Cypress and Subman, letting them know we are ok and only 0.3 from the jeep. There was an alert from the NWS some hail was ping pong ball size, thank God that wasn't what we experienced, it was a little bigger than pea size. We then checked the radar and there was a break coming, but only about 20 minutes. The lightening stopped, it wasn't really raining and we took off!! Arrived at the jeep at 11:55am. We are so thankful and I was asking Jesus during the whole ordeal, praying and asking Him to keep us safe, that I trust Him and Bam, He gives us a shelter, cell signal to look to see if we are ok to leave and a few minutes to hurry to the jeep! We made our way to Damascus, after a little while at the trailhead. Larry owner of Crazy Larry's & Mr Steve Mann, owner of The Bike Station Thank you so much for your help.","TN 91

We went to breakfast, delicious meal at Damascus Diner last night, as well as this morning. We took the jeep and after eating dropped our laundry off to Crazy Larry. We saw Hawk there. He was also on the ridge, a few miles behind Suds and I. He got video of his intense encounter with a very very very close lightening strike, on that same ridge line.  The tree & flames of the lightening strike!  He said he took cover in that same shelter too. That shelter is old and tiny, and not in use!  It's not in the AWOL Guide or on the Guthook App,  so it really did appear from no where!  God knew all along!! And he covered us!! 
Suds came over to our rig to make a plan & then later the four of us reworked the next couple weeks, so we hike higher averages and still have a Zero day a week if needed for weather or injury.
