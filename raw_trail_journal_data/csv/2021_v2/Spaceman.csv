Spaceman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610314,"The idea of quitting work and taking off on an AT thru hike was hatched about 16 mo ago at New Years, as I wondered ""have I had enough?"" And ""do I have enough?"" After pondering this a while, I came to the conclusion that it was reasonable to work a few more years, and that the answers to both of these questions would be more safely ""yes"" by then, but I would still be in good enough shape to endure it (I hope). Adding a few months to get me into the April time frame brought me up to a proposed 40 month countdown to retirement. While anything can happen in such a long period of time, here I am at the 24 month-to-go mark, and my interest in moving forward with this plan has gotten, if anything, stronger. So I thought I would make my first post, but of course not with my real name just yet.
It almost feels like I am doing something underhanded, planning to quit like this and hiding it from my employer. Rediculous, isn't it? Should I not think about my future and make plans? And is it anyone's business but mine in this ""employment at will"" world we live in?
I'll probably post again in another year.......happy trails!

Spaceman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628748,"Amazing that it is half way through 2020 already. That makes it only 10 months to go for me! Went through about 9 months of knee pain, and tried some injections, which didnt seem to help. As I was wondering if I could actually hike 2000 miles, or if I had missed my opportunity....they amazingly started feeling better on their own (or maybe it just takes 9 months to recover when you quit running?). And of course, we are all living through Covid-19 now. I am hopeful of a vaccine by end of year and that this will no longer be an issue in 10 months. But who knows? There could also be a new problem by then.Meanwhile I did just make it out for a good pre-hike test  - 56 miles on the Shawangunk Ridge Trail in NY in three days. I am in good shape and so pushed the miles - did pretty good and learned a couple minor things. Anker power bank was a needed addition. Probably I will still get an improved tent. And I think it would be good to have a bucket. But overall I was prepared and it seems I can handle it....knees were OK. Saw a black bear who took a dump on the trail in front of me! And a snapping turtle laying eggs right on the trail along the Bashakill Wildlife Management Area (not to mention lots of deer and other wildlife in this area). This trail isnt traveled much until you get to Sam's Point in Minnewaska State Park, so the wildlife is not so much scared off. Down side of the first part of the SRT is that there are too many sections of road or railroad connecting the sections of state forest, though.Happy trails! ",,View Entry,"Jun 23, Tue",0

Life will completely change for me...and my wife, who has been nothing but supportive. Thank you Schatzi! I am quite the lucky man for my good health, my wife and her support, and for the financial ability to take this break (even if it doesnt turn out to be permanent). And in case this adventure isnt enough for 2021, my wife also plans on retiring, and we are selling our house, getting an RV and a truck, and becoming homeless nomads wandering the country, all still this year.

My coworkers had a nice lunch gathering with me, and went out to a brewery for some beers late in the week. Check out the tattoos on my coworker’s arms! On Sunday I flew to Atlanta, but took a detour to Florida to get my license, since we are also moving. I stayed at Holton Creek River Camp, a nice free campsite intended for river travelers and thru hikers. They even have hot showers!

It was 430 already, but I decided to head off of the approach trail anyway. I made it the 7.8 miles to Springer shelter by 8 o’clock but then ran into another issue. My water filter wouldn’t hardly pass even a few drops of water. It took a lot of work backflushing, and a full hour to get some water.

Spaceman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635825,"Today was a day of flowers all along the trail. So nice! Also, along the way was scattered equipment, left by those that didn’t want to carry it anymore. The largest item was a folding chair that had to weigh 3 lb or more. There were a lot of clothing items, and in one spot, a shirt, pants, and shoes were neatly arranged as if to advertise them. Probably the local AT club has to remove most of it.
My legs were doing well, so I probably overdid it. Carb loading at lunch was the key to covering the miles. I reached Neel’s Gap and the Mountain Crossings store after 15 miles at around 2:30. They say that 20% of prospective thru-hikers quit already at this point. Got a sun hat and some snacks with a gift certificate from my coworkers (thanks!) I decided to continue on another 5 miles but I may have to back off tomorrow, as I am wiped.

Spaceman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635899,"Today’s hike was more moderate for much of the day, which is exactly what I needed after yesterday. At the end I decided to do the steep descent into unicoi gap and ascent up Rocky Mountain, and that was enough. The pic was earlier in the day and shows a view of the ridges I subsequently hiked over
This mountain top site has great views, but no water. So I lugged about 7 lbs of water up myself, but only from the mid point. The good news (for me)is that such a site is therefore less popular and I am here alone. But the wind is pretty strong, so I have put some large rocks on my tent pegs.","Baggs Creek Gap

I didn’t get much sleep, afraid me tent would tear apart or blow away with me in it. Well, it didn’t, and by morning the sky was clear again. 
I hiked a long day with a lot of climbs, somehow making 20 miles, but totally exhausted again","Rocky Mountain

Spaceman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636058,"I have a reservation now for a room at the Nantahala Outdoor center at mile 137. If I keep a fast pace and ration my food a bit, I can get there. If I eat as much as I want, or go slower, I will run out. If I get a ride into town to restock, I will lose too much time and will miss my reservation. So I am pushing on with some rationing, which seems like less of a good idea now at the end of the day. I didn’t feel that well in the AM, and clearly did better after eating a decent lunch. 
Anyway, it was another beautiful day, and I managed to make it the planned 20 miles. Tomorrow is another nice day, but then rain hits Mon and I will need to hike the whole day in the rain. At least I will be at the NOC for the rain Tues and Tues night....if I can keep up that pace to get there","Plum Orchard Gap Shelter

Spaceman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636153,"I had been concerned that I wasn’t feeling well because of too little food. But in the AM it was worse, even after more food, and it seems the issue was electrolyte loss. This is something I had forgotten to pick up, but it’s never given me a problem before, and I was taking calcium and magnesium and putting salt on my food....wasn’t that enough? Answer: No. When fellow hiker “Gravy” gave me an electrolyte packet, I did much better, but I knew I needed more. Then two weekend backpackers offered to take me into Franklin, to a Walmart, and I got loads of them. Plus some extra food, and after the second dose I was feeling pretty much back to normal. Chalk it up as another rookie hiker mistake.
Those two hikers were from Huntsville AL, and had a 4+ hr drive home, but they took an hour out for me. Great guys. I’ve heard many more stories like this - The hiking community takes care of each other out here.

We must have had 2” of rain (forecast 1-2”) as it poured all day until 2PM. But a lady and her sister fed me a coffee at the first shelter, and the rain never came back until I had a chance to dry out my tent a little, have dinner with the hikers at this shelter, and get back in my tent. 
Not my favorite, but not nearly as bad as I feared in the end. Tomorrow there is more rain but I have an easy 7miles into Nantahala Outdoor Center for my first NERO (near zero miles) day and some rest, washing, and resupply

The downpours and thunderstorms came again, but I was lucky enough to escape Mother Nature this time by staying at Rufus Morgan Shelter and having a second coffee as I watched the rain pour down. 
At NOC, the general store clerk said it was the highest the river has been in 4 years. (The pic shows it encroaching on the restaurant patio area). 
This was a much needed break out of the rain, getting resupply (thank you Connie and Dori!), recharged, washed and dried. Tomorrow I climb from 1730 ft back up and over 5000 ft at Cheoah bald.","Wesser Bald Shelter

Starting elevation was below 1800 and Cheoah Bald was above 5000, not to mention the many other climbs. Overall this was probably the most climbing in any one day, but tomorrow won’t be much better, as I get to Fontana and then the Smokies.

The last Shelter before is generally known as the “Fontana Hilton”, because it has drinking water, solar phone charger, and even a hot shower available. After lunch I took the shower, washing shirt, underwear, and socks, and just put them on again wet (all synthetic, they dry quickly). 
Then it was time to cross the dam and enter the GSMNP. Immediately it starts climbing, and after a very long day, I am at the shelter, at 4580’. Tomorrow I go higher as the GSMNP has a long stretch around 6000’. It remains chilly at these elevations - low tonite forecast is 39. Hope I can stay warm!","Cody Campsite

It won’t be much better tonite as I am up another 1000’ to 5500’ at Double Spring. At least is shouldn’t rain at all tonight but wind gusts forecast to 30mph.Tomorrow I move into the 6000’s starting with the climb up Clingman’s to 6650, the highest point on the AT.","Mollies Ridge Shelter

But the afternoon was easier, and I reached my planned destination still feeling good, so I pushed further for my longest day, arriving 6:45 pm. Unfortunately, I lost my tent pegs and had to whittle wooden ones. Also, this shelter is very crowded, and it’s almost impossible to find a tent spot. 
On the bright side, today’s hike had more outstanding views of the mountains than I have ever seen in one day. This is a beautiful national park.","Double Spring Gap Shelter

Spaceman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636707,"It was still a cold windy morning at tri-corner knob, and I got out quickly. Apparently it was a zoo because the next shelter was closed due to bear activity, and going to the next shelter beyond was a big increase in mileage.
There were at least 6 bear poops directly on the AT - maybe they are trying to tell us what they think of it.
The day warmed and was nice, but I dragged and the long downhill from high altitude was tough on the knees. But a second lunch at the Standing Bear Hostel (pulled pork sandwich, chips, etc) got me moving late for another long day. This shelter is not crowded, but there is rain tonight and tomorrow to deal with.","Tri-Corner Knob Shelter

I hiked through drizzle all day, but rarely had a raincoat on. Made it the 23 miles to Deer Park despite feet aching all day (this has been getting worse for some tile) which was doable because there was also much more long steady moderate downhills than anything else today. No views, but the trail is full of flowers this time of year and quite pretty.

An 11oz burger and home made kettle chips from the local diner (I skipped the 20oz burger they offer!). Sunnybank took care of my laundry and will serve me a big homemade breakfast in the morning.

That’s saying something because I can’t resist nuts. But after the sandwiches, burgers, chips, beers, etc and then a home made breakfast at Sunnybank, I was too stuffed. But it only took till afternoon for my appetite to return...

Highlight of the day was the beautiful but difficult Howard’s Rock section. Lowlight of the day is that 10 miles of tha AT today was due South! So while I did a lot of miles, I didn’t progress north very much at all.","Stealth site just past Little Laurel

I continued on the extra 4.3 miles to the shelter, although many young folks were already hanging out at the hostel right at the river. I picked up a couple snickers ($.40!) and was on my way. There was no one at the shelter, until around 7:30 when a family showed up, including a 2.5 year old boy and 7mo old girl....and they were not short distance hikers - they started at Springer and plan to go to Maine!

The PM was easier thankfully. Lots of sunshine and great hiking weather through the pretty North Carolina mountainsides. Tomorrow I go back over 6000’ for the first time since the Smokies, over Roan High Knob. For the second time, the shelter is not overcrowded...It seems most of the young crowd shuttled to Damascus for the well known  “hiker days” celebration/party.

The Roan Highlands is a huge, expansive area of balds and views that I have taken numerous pictures of, but of course they don’t do it the justice it deserves. The hiking here is very different than I am used to in the northeast, and it’s great to have the chance to experience it.

A couple of issues though - I have the private room in the hostel, but you can only get to it through the bunk house, and there are just two bathrooms serving 11 beds total. Also they apparently don’t give rides into town, but also don’t have a restaurant open for lunch...so I went to their competitor The Station and had a very good lunch. Burgers from the “Truck” in the evening were great though and the MH is very convenient to the AT.

But with a heavy stomach and after too many beers, I skipped breakfast and headed out. The terrain was not quite as tough, and despite the high mileage, this was not a tougher than average day. Views were not as majestic as in the near past, but numerous creeks, streams, and waterfalls were the big highlight today.

Lake Watauga is another TVA lake, and is 16 miles long. Most of the day was spent hiking in view of it, first at near water level, and then while climbing Iron Mtn ridge back to 4000’ levels.

I came pretty close to them and their calves, and several of them looked straight at me and nodded (what does that mean?). 
Then I met local hiker “cob-web clearer” (he was quite tall) who gave me a sprouted pumpkin seed bar that he claims is the best for hiker energy. 
Then the highlight - I surprised a big mama bear and her cub as I came around the corner (and they surprised me!). They ran off into the woods, and mama was too fast to get a picture of, but baby climbed a tree and I tried to get a picture. But with a phone camera and some distance, it’s tough to get a good shot. That is, until I heard a scratching noise above....another cub over me! I backed up and took a quick shot, and then high-tailed it out of there, fearful of the return of a protective mama.

First order of business was a big breakfast at the Damascus Diner - 17 of us were there for the opening at 8. Then the dollar store for resupply, the outfitter for fuel, and the post office for a replacement for my leaking air mattress (thank you, Big Agnes!). And then unlike most everyone else, I was on my way back down the trail.
The Rhodies are in bloom now, at lower elevations and where there is enough sun filtering through. They are the primary undergrowth, and going through “tunnels” of them is common. 
After 19 miles I felt like I had enough, and set up my tent. But then I discovered I had no cell signal, nor did I have any if I climbed the hill to the left, or to the right, or if I walked a god distance down the AT. 
I knew my wife would be worried if I didn’t call, and so I took my tent down again and continued on. It was another 2 miles up the next mountain before I could reach her. After that, I found myself on the side of a steep mountain with boulders and no flat spots for another 2.5 miles. It’s good that the frustration gave me the renewed energy to complete the long day.

They are not afraid of us humans at all, and I gave one a quick pat as I squeezed by him standing on the AT. Later on there were also some long horn cattle, and I came across a couple of snakes hanging out on a rock at a stream crossing. 

The highlands scenery was once again beautiful, and although there wasn’t so much elevation climbing in the AM, it was still a trusting day because of all the rocks and boulders along the way. 

With all the animal life and scenery, this was one of the great days. But being a nice Saturday, it was also one of the most crowded. Lots of people of all walks, including large Boy Scout groups","White top Mtn Spring - Stealth site

The excitement for me ended up being an afternoon sharp rock on the trail, that tore through my lone peak shoes. I duct taped them and continued on. Except that I also noticed a tear developing on the other side, and of course, as is normal with LP4’s, the toes have been delaminating for some time. I checked the soles, and they are at least 2/3 of tread gone in the high wear areas as well. I think it’s time for new shoes.
If this were approaching Damascus, that would be easier since there are several good outfitters. But nothing good now along the trail. Need to figure this out.

 Nice view from my tent atop chestnut knob, and the stone shelter here is very interesting, but the lack of water up here means you need to mule it up the last 500-600’ of vertical yourself.

Due to my mileage, I don’t usually see the same people for very long, but my short day into Long Neck Lair dropped me behind some hikers I had met the prior day, and then I saw them again yesterday. And surprise, I saw them again today, but hiking the opposite way without their packs. This is called “slackpacking”, and is done via shuttling by hostels. This slackpack had two benefits for the hikers - a day without the weight of their packs, as well as easier terrain. You see, the shuttle brought them not only further north to hike south, but also to a higher elevation, and picking them up at a low one. This they are able to do that 2000’ climb I did late Tues as a descent instead. It’s not what I would choose to do, but as they say, “hike your own hike”.
Slackpacking has multiple benefits for the hostel as well - they can charge around $20 for the service, which is good if they can get a whole carload to do it. Plus the slack packers are hiking back to their Hostel for a second night stay, food purchase, etc. A nice win for the Hostel.","Chestnut Knob Shelter

So nice.  Even though we have had no rain for two weeks, the falls were not at all..... dismal.

Anyway, my duct taped shoes survived the trip, and new ones were waiting for me. And the staff of Angels Rest was very helpful and accommodating. The only thing that is not my cup of tea is that it was crowded with lots of tents and dozens of 20-somethings that wanted to party and enjoy their social stay. Which I don’t blame them for; it’s just not where I fit in or what I am here for.

Spaceman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638278,"I came out of Pearisburg having eaten too much as usual in-town. The lunch-thru dinner feeding frenzy included a qt of Chinese food, 1/2 lb burger, 19oz beer, 10 oz Doritos, a couple of candy bars, and then a whole lb of nuts. But after a half day walking I was ready to eat some more! This hiker hunger is almost limitless. 
It was a wet, foggy, slippery, dreary bay with no views and not much to report. Just cranked out some miles. It was almost a mistake to go beyond Bailey Gap Shelter, as the next “reliable” water source was just a trickle and difficult to collect, and the terrain got rocky and steep, and it was hard to find a stealth site. But these problems were resolved, and my trowel made a decent spout for the spring. It became very cold quickly so I’m glad it didn’t take me any longer.","

And it was 42F. And it was foggy, with now views, with slippery, rocky trails. Thank goodness for new shoes, as my duct taped ones would never have made it.
Most uncomfortable of all, the trail was on a high plateau with lots of grasses that bent over the trail holding liters and liters of cold water ready to dump on your feet. My feet were cold most of the day as the water poured through. It felt like I was walking through a cold mountain stream all morning. The going was slow on slippery rocks, and by the time I reached Sarver Hollow I was beat. I set up my soaking wet tent and got in my damp sleeping bag as soon as possible. Not a great day.","Stealth site at mile 662

I headed out early to meet with Ulrich, a friend and co-worker at my former employer Lanxess. He hiked with me 1500 of the 1700’ up brush mountain before having to head back. It was great to see him and learn of some company news. 
The toughest part (but also most beautiful) was the part of the trail leading up to and following Dragon’s Tooth. This was real rock scrambling, and cliff-edge walking, and with a loaded pack and carrying 4 liters of water, it was at times a real challenge. Once or twice it felt like my pack was pushing me over the edge of the path and into a big fall. In some places there were iron rings installed and one had to descend backwards. In other areas the rock had been chipped out a little to allow for a foot hold. It was the most challenging of the AT so far, hands down. 
Great day, except I banged my knee and overworked other muscles getting through it. I hope all is OK after some rest.","Sarver Hollow Shelter

But my next Nero is coming and there was no need to do big miles, so I took it a little easier and had time to enjoy McAfee’s knob and Tinker Cliffs, great spots that together with Dragon’s tooth make up the Virginia Triple Crown of views. McAfee is one of the most photographed spots anywhere on the trail, and Tinker Cliffs reminds me of the Shwangunks in NY again.
At the end I have chosen this nice campsite that has a stream, a picnic table, and bear box - you don’t normally see all these amenities unless its a shelter site.

In town, I of course ate too much. And with my weight down, I am nervous about food and being too hungry, and so even added to my wife’s resupply care package from the local store. There aren’t really any good resupply options for a long time within 5 miles of the trail, and one would have to hire a shuttle for a ride into town, and then back again. I will carry the most ever instead, and try to last 7 days.

Not much in the way of views but I saw 2 fawns, a snapping turtle, large black snake, and an interesting orange lizard. I camped at Cross Jennings Creek, camped nearby, and was able to cool off with a swim. What’s not to like?

Spaceman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638491,"So many mountains to climb today, and while their elevations here further north in VA are getting lower, they are making up for it by sending us lower in the valley between them, often making the climbs just as large or even larger. I did over 6000’ of climbing today, and whatever the real number is, I’m sure its a new record. I’m beat. Views now tend to be more of villages in the valley, as surrounding mountains are shrinking. But there comes a point to a hiker where views and wildlife are secondary highlights in the day - the biggest highlight is food. And while I may have a heavy pack, my wife has really taken care of me in that department. I am eating better than most everyone on the trail - except those that keep shuttling off to towns all the time.

Spaceman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638582,"Today was the first truly hot, oppressive day, particularly at lower elevations (88F). I clocked long miles by virtue of many hrs on my feet - 7AM until just after 6PM. But this positions me well for tomorrow’s big elevation climb (2700’) first thing in the AM, as well as for my reservation Tuesday at Stanimal’s 328 hostel.



The big news for me today is that I am changing my plans, which I have been thinking about doing for a while. Instead of continuing through to Maine, I plan to hike Shenandoah National Park and end shortly after that.
I believe I have already accomplished my goal of taking a break from the “real world”, dropping all responsibilities, resetting and rejuvenating. It has been a great sabbatical, and I am ready to move on. 


I also miss being with my wife, whom I will have been gone from for 7x as long as ever before - I think it’s been long enough. I also have the attractive alternative of living on a lake for the summer as a fully retired person for the first time, and I could also really use the time for preparing for our RV adventure coming next.


I am glad I have had the chance to hike the full southern mountainous region of the AT - it’s been a great experience. For me the next ~600 miles or so have somewhat less allure; also a factor. As for some of the most attractive northern sections I will be missing, like the ME100 mile wilderness and the portions of the NH whites I haven’t done yet, I think that I may enjoy them more as shorter sections in the future.


So for me, this is the right decision, and I will turn this into a mere ~1000 mile LASH (long-ass section hike). To all of you continuing through to Maine, best of luck and happy trails!","Marble Spring Campsite

When I check the stats afterwards, I expect it will show it to be the most for the whole southern AT. Add the heat of the last couple of days and it becomes a real physical challenge.

Of course, then they have you climb to 4000’ again. Humidity was about 100% on the climb, and there were no views, just fog. In fact I couldn’t wear my glasses as they were too steamed up. But there are like that on the AT until the northeast. The mountains of Shenandoah are tame by comparison as they form a nice ridge line and your elevation can be maintained. This puts me 12+ miles out from the pickup point for Stanimals 328 Hostel, and my short day tomorrow.","Priest Shelter

I had to pack my sleeping bag and many other things damp, and when I deflated my mattress, there was a small pond underneath. It’s good that I didn’t even know.
I couId tell that my back was going to be a problem still, so I downed 4 Advil. I packed my tent wet, put my wet things on and headed out. At least it was warm enough so that this was no problem. I ended up walking more slowly and in pain all day, with my hip belt loose and the pack weight only on my shoulders. It was my toughest day of the whole trip but somehow I made it here late, only to find all camping spots taken. I stealth camped nearer the AT and set up my wet tent in the rain.

As it turns out, we bagged out a day early on the second day due to one of our group falling sick. So although we made it to the Elkwallow wayside in the AM, we then proceeded to hike the ~9 miles back to the car and skip the last day of camping out and hiking. The weather also called for severe thunderstorms, and we were also afraid we would not make our scheduled shuttle at Front Royal, so all things pointed to pulling the plug early. 
So I am back home and recovering. After several days, my feet still ache, and I am still low energy. Plus my back pain is back now that I am not taking the Meloxicam, but that is slowly improving. I think it will take several more days to get back to “normal” - I guess while you are continuing to push, you don’t realize the toll your body has taken....until you slow down enough to give it a full chance to complain. 
It was a great hike, a great opportunity to do the mountainous region of the south, and I think the right length for me.
