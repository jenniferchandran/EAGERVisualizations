Chippin' Away,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632689,"In  preparation for this year's hike, I made some gear changes.
 With great angst I retired my favorite, a huge, well used Golite backpack, and switched to a lighter, smaller (but not too small) Gossamer Gear Mariposa.  I tried it out on a thruhike of the Foothills Trail last fall and it worked well.  Also discovered that I needed to go back to a full length sleeping pad (at least in colder weather) rather than using a torso length pad with the pack to support my legs.  In part because I switched to a down sleeping bag after years of using synthetic bags.  No fooling that the top keeps you warm but boy it flattens out underneath you. Another reason to go with a full length pad with decent R value.
So overall base weight is about 22# (that is, not including food and water.) Not too bad but not great.  Hahaha - My downfall is throwing in last minute items that aren't on my carefully constructed spreadsheet.",,View Entry,"Feb 18, Thu",0

Tevis water sandals worked great!  The 2nd stream was only about ankle deep but dutifully took boots off to keep them dry inside.

Worse, the 2 miles from trail turned out to be ""as the crow flies"".  Later, Google maps showed it to be 5.1 miles each way.  So to make a long story short, ended up stealth camping near the hostel/retreat (no one there but clearly being renovated), met a lovely German Shepherd who was so glad to see someone and stayed close by all night (what an angel!), stayed dry in tent as 3 rounds of major thunderstorms passed over at night (had to sit up and help brace the tent against strong winds each time.)

Btw this is part of Virginia scenic highway.  Horse and buggy caution signs for motorists (Amish or other sect?) Interestingly each of the two intersections had white painted signs with the names of the residents and the distances to each farm/home.  As this was before dawn on a Sunday, only saw a few farmers up and lots of cows in pastures. 
Back on trail by 9:30 am.  Trying not to think about the 10 extra miles for naught but cows.  Trail was wet and slippery. Passed by 9 southbound section hikers.  Luckily they called out a greeting each time as I couldn't see well with wet/fogged glasses and a rain hood riding low.  Was tired by that time and, sure enough, slipped on a wet rock and landed like an upside-down turtle on my pack. Not hurt but the adrenaline rush drains you once it wears off.  Stayed overnight at Jenkins Shelter.  Multiple hikers arrived over time.  Another excellent dog, Alice, a Siberia husky, section hiking with Todd, helped lift my spirits and kept the mice away in the shelter.  Damp and cold overnight.

Very pleasant hiking. All nobo hikers pass me sooner than later, as expected. Some are trying to make it to Brushy Mtn.

Hike today was in Harriman State Park. Very lovely green, open woods.  Clouds concealed the lake.  Early on went through the so called lemon squeeze, a tight rock formation, easily without my pack on. The vertical climb that followed was too wet and difficult for me, so took the short side trail around it.  No other tough spots but was careful on all rocks to avoid slipping. 
The old, stone shelter was just off the trail. Rather unique in that a huge boulder was used as the back side of the shelter (damp as water seeped down.) Stayed in shelter because of expected evening shower.  Sparks and Skittles, two hikers I had met earlier in Pennsylvania were already there.

Started off at 6 am in fog and very wet conditions.  No views all day.  By passed Bear Mountain with its rock scramble, took Undermountain Trail, then Paradise Lane Trail which rejoined the AT (1.7 miles longer). The Sages Ravine creek was gorgeous and roaring. Trail followed the creek downstream for a while, then crossed it. No bridge!  It really did look impossible to cross safely.  In my first attempt I immediately slipped on a rock and sat down right next to the creek bank. Lost a pole but Sage pinned it down before it floated off too far.  Water temperature was lovely!  I've also double plastic bagged the inside of my pack so not worried about contents getting wet.  Only worried about injury or drowning! Looked for a better crossing (none). Then a southbound hiker, Geo, appeared and made it easily across the creek.  He graciously offered to help us across.  He advised me to face upstream and move feet and poles side to side, holding my arm in case I needed steadying. Amazing the difference body position made!  From impossible to do-able!  Then Geo helped Sage across.  Thank you, Geo!

Some sketchy board ""bridges"" were helpful but nerve wracking.  Made good time and arrived at Pierce Pond Lean-to in early afternoon.  Tented as I heard a large group of thru hikers were on the way (10-13.)  Just as well as stomach troubles hit just after arriving.  I've learned to leave my backup light (Petzl) on in the tent so I can find the tent easier after a night time walk to the privy.   Light rain and mist most of the night.","West Carry Pond Lean-to

Then decided to call for the shuttle to Sterling Inn (not far but far enough if walking.) With heavy rain forecasted, arranged to stay at the Inn.  Received mail drop packages, including replacement power bank for recharging phone on trail.  Staying in bunk room.  Not sure about plans for tomorrow.  Depends on weather.","Pierce Pond Lean-to

Suspect I've contracted Giardia, so not feeling great.  My bad for not replacing my failing (abused?) water filter earlier.  Or not being careful enough when getting water from ponds?  Stopped early at shelter as more rain is forecasted even though the afternoon turned partly sunny.  Sure enough,  heavy rain started after midnight.  Two other hikers at shelter and a couple others tenting.  Could hear some locals partying down at the Pond after dark.","Sterling Inn, Caratunk, Maine

Not true at Bald Mountain Creek right before the side trail to the shelter.  Lovely, roaring creek was maybe 8 feet across but no way to cross without getting ones feet wet. Current strong enough to require caution.  Forgot how unpleasant and cold wet boots and socks can be!  Only 1 southbound hiker at shelter area that night.  He advised that the upcoming West Branch and East Branch of the Piscataquis River were too high to cross safely.  Recommended calling for a shuttle around these.  Frankly, didn't realize how much rain this area had gotten!  Guide book warns against crossing during high water but doesn't offer any alternatives.","Pleasant Pond Lean-to

Early in the day, the Long Pond Stream crossing was as challenging as I expected. Any more so and I would not have attempted it.  Another hiker had sent me a text with a suggested crossing upstream after bushwhacking 200 yards.  I was wading barefoot (feet are numb from the cold water) and thought I was at the spot.  Turns out that I wasn't, but did make it across.  One deep hole wet my pants up to the crotch.  Current was strong but manageable.  Finally, almost on shore when I slipped on the smooth rock bank and fell forward on hands and knees in relatively shallow water.  Unfortunately my boots, tied together and hanging from my hip belt,  did dip into the water and get soaked, as did the wool hiking socks stuffed in them. (Not sure why I thought that was a good idea.)  Takes days for the boots and socks to dry when there's no sun.  Other hikers didn't seem to have the same difficulty so I'm sure I just don't have enough experience yet to pick out a good route.","Stealth camp at old logging road before Long Pond sfeam

Very clear skies.  Perfect blue as was the pond.  Hiking through red and gold carpets of leaves.
