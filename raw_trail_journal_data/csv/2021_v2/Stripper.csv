Stripper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641652,"I will work my shift tomorrow at the Nantahala Outdoor Center tomorrow, be done around 5p and finish up a few last tasks before hitting the road at 6 am on Sunday morning to head to New Hampshire.  I am looking forward to continuing my journet that began in 2008.  While I did thru-hike in 2018, I feel like I've left something undone.  I plan to finish it!",,View Entry,"Jul 30, Fri",0
Stripper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641709,"Edith and I hit the road at 6:30 am and are still 90 minutes away from our destination! We will be on the road for right at 12 hours today and have another 9-10 hours tomorrow!  But it hasn’t been all that bad, I guess!  We’ve gotten stuck behind at least 2 wrecks which have slowed us but we’re still having a ball.  I am looking forward to the Notch and climbing through that huge jumble of boulders again!  Mahoosuc Notch:  I’m coming back for round 2!!",,View Entry,"Aug 01, Sun",0
Stripper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641822,"Well, our first day out did not go as planned!  We were to be dropped off at the Notch Trailhead to hike the Mahoosuc Notch; however, the road was washed out and we were unable to find a way around it. But all was not lost as we did actually do some great hiking anyway!  We did the Table Rock loop and while it was very challenging, it was a great introduction for Edith to the AT in New Hampshire and Maine!  We had some boulders to scramble over, rebar to scramble up and some tight squeezes to get through!  So, while it was not the Notch, our feet did hike on the AT for a bit and we did get a workout!  We will come back and get the notch in a couple of weeks!  Today we are heading up to Crawford Notch and we will do some hiking up there—tomorrow we begin the Wildcats!! Then we will go back and work on the Presidential Range!",,View Entry,"Aug 04, Wed",0
Stripper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641952,"We had a fantastic day of hiking. The elevation gain was pretty intense, but we still made good time and had fun. We walked by some really pretty waterfalls and have an amazing view of the Presidentials from our tent site. Tomorrow we will be at the Lake of the Clouds hut and then on to Mount Washington. We’re supposed to be getting some rain over the next few days, but hopefully we can make our miles without too much trouble. The trail still feels like home to me and I am so very blessed to be able to be out here again. I am looking forward to the challenge again.","AMC Highland Center

Stripper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642677,"Well, I can say I have done the Mahoosuc Notch to Grafton Notch for a second time and to be honest, if I had remembered how difficult it was to go over that stupid unnamed peak between Speck Pond and Ole Speck I might have not done that section. But we did it and it’s complete. I’m satisfied. But it did take us over 12 hours and we finished at 8:30pm. We were so very thankful to see Mark from West Bethel motel as we were over an hour late getting in. Mark and his staff are just amazing people and I cannot say enough good comments about them. We are currently at the Sterling Inn in Caratunk, ME and will be heading to Monson, ME to figure out we will do the 100 Mile Wilderness and Katahdin. We were so very blessed to be able to spend some time here with Nimberwill Nomad. We had a great day of rest yesterday and my knees are feeling better today. We will get with Poet and Hippie Chick today and get the logistics of finishing solidified today and get this thing done!!","
