Crawl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632834,"Started hiking today at about 7:45am, got a shuttle from Amicalola Visitors Center to Springer parking lot,  pack weight was 38lbs at home. Tough going, the last .9 miles SOBO from the parking lot is really rocky. Got there, pictures and drank water, started North! Past the parking, the trail is much smoother and mostly downhill towards Stover Creek shelter. I have stayed there several times before,  love that shelter,  only 2.8 miles from Springer but my legs are jello, and that's where my day ended. Swamp was there, Gandalf came in and tented right behind the shelter.  Wind blew pretty stiff but it was no match for my Zpacks 10° classic sleeping bag! Dehydrated spaghetti with 2 parmesan cheese packets! Prefect!!! Tomorrow,  hoping for more! ... Crawl","Springer Mountain
