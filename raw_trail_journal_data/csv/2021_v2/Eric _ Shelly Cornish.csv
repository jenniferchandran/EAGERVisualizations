April 30


We hiked 22 miles today so that we could say that we stayed at Matt’s Creek Shelter(mile 785) .  In my family, I have three family members who are named Matthew or Matt. It seemed appropriate that we stay in this shelter tonight. The hike today was beautiful. Spring has definitely come to the mountains in Virginia. Leaves are filling out trees, trillium blankets the forest floor, and dogwood trees smell divine with their small white flowers (photos to come later).   We even saw a pair of Scarlet Tanager birds (red with black wings).  We also have been seeing these burgundy centipedes that are all over the trail. I don’t know what they are but they are creepy. Photos to be uploaded when I have WiFi. 




We had some big climbs today: Apple Orchard Mt (4,225’) which allows you to pass through the Guillotine.  The Guillotine is a medium sized rock that is being held up by two larger rocks. It looks Iike the rock might drop and behead you at any point. Thankfully Grasshopper and I both still have our head intact after passing through the guillotine.  We also climbed Highcock Knob (3,073’). 


Tonight we are only 4 miles from a road. Some hikers pushed the extra miles to get off trail at Glasgow but we’ve decided to hike until Lexington before we jump off trail for food and a shower. 


 It was a beautiful day and sun was out BUT that wind was fierce. The weather service issued a high wind warning with gusts around 35-40 mph.  We’ve had wind on three trail but never like this 😬.  Trees were moving and the wind felt like it would push me over at times.  It was scary when loose branches would conf crashing down around you as we hiked. Thankfully we both navigated the wind and falling branches.  As we hiked I must have picked up 10-15 branches that were blocking the trail. I could have picked up more but the longer we hiked the more tired I became which meant less cleaning the trail. I also reminded myself that there are other hikers on the trail besides me 🤪.

Eric & Shelly Cornish,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632392,"Why are we hiking the AT?
Perhaps the biggest question we get about our hike, is why?  Why are you leaving the comfort of your house to sleep in a tent?  Why do you want to hike 2,193 miles in the rain, snow & wind?  Why?  
The why questions we have faced from others have no simple answers.  The answers are very personal and sometimes difficult to explain to others.  Many of our friends and family do not understand why we are embarking on this journey while others applaud our courage and determination to set off on the trail.  Ultimately, Eric and I feel that it is the right time in our lives to undertake a journey of this magnitude.  We have the finances, time, health, and desire to hike the Appalachian Trail.  Today is the youngest we'll ever be and now is the time.
As a married couple, Eric and I both enjoy travel and adventure.  Together we’ve sought unique travel experiences and due to COVID we are not able to travel around the world like we once did. Hiking the AT will help fulfill some of our wanderlust.  We will cross varied terrain, visit 14 states, and stumble into small towns scattered along the trail.  We will encounter people from around the United States as we hike.  We will view the world from above tree line and experience the awe of nature on a daily basis. We will soak in the sun and the rain.  We will stop to rest among the flowers and admire the views presented to us.   We will celebrate the daily exhaustion and the simplicity the trail provides.  We will stop and live in the moments of the hike.
Our why is also rooted in a desire and curiosity we share with those who have hiked before us.  For 10 years, a map of the Appalachian Trail has hung by our bedside inspired by a book I read by Jennifer Pharr Davis.  Jennifer came to Alpena on a book tour and I voraciously read all her books. A seed was planted and a dream to hike the Appalachian Trail grew.  A thru-hike offers  purity of purpose, continuity of a challenge, and a sweep of the trail that section hiking does not offer.  We feel ready to embrace the physical and emotional challenges of a thru-hike.
As part of our preparation, Eric and I have hiked sections of the trail over the years and have hiked throughout Northern Michigan.  This past fall we had the opportunity to participate in the Appalachian Trail Institute taught by Warren Doyle . Warren does a great job of presenting the realities of the trail while sharing stories about the trail. The ATI strengthened our desire to hike the trail and connected us with fellow hikers. We begin with one step on February 26 and hope to summit Mt. Katahdin on August 9th.  

We will do our best to update our Trail Journal throughout our hike and we look forward to sharing our travel stories with those who choose to follow us on the trail or virtually.

Eric & Shelly Cornish,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632613,"Getting ready for the trail has felt like a full time job but one of the best jobs I've ever had.  Over the past 6 months, we've spent way too much time reading, researching, and watching YouTube channels on the AT.    At night, we search YouTube for things like: the hardest part of the AT, staying warm and dry in a tent, resupply boxes, hiking in the rain, and how to poop in the woods.  As I type, Eric is reading Appalachian Trails by Zach Davis (Appalachian Trials | The Good Badger (zrdavis.com) which is a great book on the emotions and psychology of doing the trail.  
My morning consisted of small tasks. I sprayed down our packs and a few of our ditty bags with a little extra waterproof spray.  Nothing is truthfully waterproof when you are outside 24/7 but I figured it wouldn't hurt.  I added addresses into my iphone contacts so that I can send a postcard to my family and friends.  I emptied my pack and decided to add another pair of long johns just for sleeping.  I made some yummy GORP out of some peanuts, chocolate chips and raisins.   Finally, I also searched a few of the blogs I follow and I found a fun and interesting article by Zach Davis that I thought I’d share with you:
21 Appalachian Trail Statistics That Will Surprise, Entertain and Inform You
 
ZACH DAVIS
There’s a better than good chance that you’re familiar with the Appalachian Trail. Perhaps you’ve even hiked a bit of it.
But how much do you know about the United States’ original long trail? Test your knowledge and wow your friends with some fun facts about the AT.
How many miles is the AT? 2,200
The approximate length of the Appalachian Trail in miles. It’s not that the length of the trail is unknown, but rather that the distance changes year to year, based on trail modifications such as switchbacks and reroutes. This year, 2015, according to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy (ATC) Data Book, the AT is 2,189.2 miles. Last year, it was 2,185.3. This amounts to approximately 5,000,000 steps, a number sure to fill your step-tracker-wearing friends with envy.
How many states does the AT cross?   14
The number of states the AT crosses. From south to north: 1. Georgia 2. North Carolina 3. Tennessee 4. Virginia 5. West Virginia 6. Maryland 7. Pennsylvania 8. New Jersey 9. New York 10. Connecticut 11. Massachusetts 12. Vermont 13. New Hampshire 14. Maine.
How many times would a thru-hiker climb up Mt. Everest while hiking the AT?  16
The number of times an AT thru-hiker would climb up Mount Everest. Compared to trails in higher elevation mountain ranges, many falsely assume the AT to be relatively flat. In fact, over the course of the Appalachian Trail’s 2,189 miles, thru-hikers gain and lose over 464,464 ft., or more than 89 miles.
How many days on average does it take to finish the AT?  165
The number of days it takes the average person to complete a thru-hike. Thru-hike durations can range from a full-year to a blistering 46 and a half days (the current speed record), but most will complete their 2,189 mile trek in five to seven months, with the average being “a week or two shy of six months,” according to the ATC.
What's the highest peak on the AT?   6,643
The highest elevation in feet along the Appalachian Trail, at Clingmans Dome in Great Smoky Mountains National Park.
What's the lowest elevation on the AT?  124
The lowest elevation in feet along the Appalachian Trail, at Bear Mountain State Park in New York. (Although many report their low point being the day they finish.)
What percentage of the AT has been rebuilt or relocated?  99
The percentage of the trail that has been relocated or rebuilt since its creation. The ATC estimates rebuilding or relocating nearly all of the trail since its creation in 1937.
How many volunteers manage the AT in a given year?  241,936
The number of volunteer hours that went into maintaining the Appalachian Trail in the federal fiscal year ending in September 2014. This amounts to over 10,000 days of volunteer work from 5,617 volunteers, the second highest number of volunteer hours since the ATC began tracking this information in 1983. (source: the ATC’s Laurie Potteiger)
How many maintenance clubs serve the AT?  31
The number of maintenance clubs that serve the Appalachian Trail. The ATC oversees 31 distinct clubs, whose duties range anywhere from “maintaining existing trails and painting blazes to excavating trail reroutes and building new shelters,” according to Appalachian Trails.
How many white blazes mark the AT?   165,000
The approximate number of white blazes marking the Appalachian Trail, according to the Georgia Appalachian Trail Club. This averages out to about one white blaze every 70 feet. Since the trail is so well marked, many thru-hikers forego carrying maps (87% according to a recent ATC survey), and instead opt to carry a guidebook.
How many calories per day does the average hiker need to consume to maintain their body weight? 5,500
The number of calories required for a hiker* to maintain his or her body weight during a typical day of backpacking. In other words, a hiker could eat 11 Big Macs throughout the day and still be at an energy deficiency. Typically, after a few weeks on trail, many thru-hikers achieve the celebrated “hiker hunger,” a near-inability to be sated by any amount of food. Oftentimes, it’s a hiker’s budget, not appetite, that constrains their in-town binging.
How many gallons of ice cream does the average thru-hiker eat in a single sitting at the halfway point? 1/2
In gallons, the amount of ice cream many thru-hikers eat in a single sitting at the halfway point. It is customary for AT thru-hikers to attempt (and typically, succeed) to eat a half-gallon of ice cream at the convenience store closest to the halfway point on the Appalachian Trail. Many need less than 15 minutes to accomplish the feat. For those keeping score at your desk, a half-gallon is four pints, or 2,300 calories. Don’t try this at home.
How many pounds on average does a thru-hiker lose while hiking the AT?  30
The average number of pounds lost by thru-hikers during their journey. Despite the halfway-mark ice cream, the vast majority of hikers face severe calorie deficiencies during the span of their thru-hike due to a strenuous workload. Although most hikers practice a “see food diet”—see food, eat it—it’s not uncommon for thru-hikers to lose upwards of 50, 70, or even over 100 lbs. during the course of their half-year trek. This is not a hard and fast rule, as some hikers lose no weight or even gain a few pounds.
How many pairs of shoes does the average thru-hiker go through on the AT?  4-5
The number of pairs of shoes most thru-hikers go through. In general, if you can get 500 miles out of your footwear, you’re doing well. Some can stretch this even further, depending on the shoe’s durability, a hiker’s weight (including pack), maintenance protocols, and ability to avoid stepping on sharp edges. Certain terrain, like the extremely rocky trails of Pennsylvania, will chew through footwear at a much faster clip. This is an anecdotal estimate, although I do have the good fortune of interacting with many dozens of AT thru-hikers each year.
What is the average number of miles between road crossing on the AT?  4
The average number of miles between road crossings on the AT, according to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy (ATC). “How do you eat?” is a common question of those who are planning on thru-hiking. The answer is, “quite easily,” as access to the closest town—and thus grocery store, deli, or post office—is typically never more than a few days away, and often much less than that.
What percentage has the traffic on the AT increased between the 20th and 21st century?  78
The percent increase in 2,000 milers in the 21st vs. the 20th century per the ATC. Due to the skyrocketing popularity of the AT and thru-hiking in general, the number of 2,000 milers, “a hiker who has walked the entire length of the Appalachian Trail,” over the last 15 years will likely double that of the previous 63 years. For reference, the first reported 2,000 miler was in 1936
How many shelters exist on the AT?  262
The number of shelters on or along the trail. The AT is lined with more than 250 three-walled structures which serve as refuges for hikers, averaging out to approximately one shelter every 8 miles.
What percentage of thru-hikers are female?  25
The percent of female 2,000 milers. Although anecdotal reports says that the percentage of female thru-hikers is on the rise, the ATC reports that only one in four 2,000 milers are women.",,View Entry,"Feb 10, Wed",0

Eric & Shelly Cornish,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632795,"Eric and I had flew out of Alpena on Wednesday. It was great to have a few friends and some family see us off at the airport.  We connected with two girls from the ATI(Appalachian Trail Institute) and their friend Alison.  Together we drove up to Amicola Lodge in Georgia.  We start the hike tomorrow😳.  We are excited to start this journey.  As we checked into the Lodge tonight, a mother walked up to us snd asked if we were thru hikers.  She said her son, Daniel started the trail today and with tears in her eyes she asked us to check in with home if we see him on the trail.  I’m certain my own mom is worried at home tonight as I prepare to hike the trail tomorrow.  Speaking of moms, The girls families will be slack packing us tomorrow(taking our packs and meeting us at a road crossing for lunch to give us our gear). This will make the big climb a little easier 👏 and will allow us to get done mikes in our legs. Our goal right now is Stover Creek tomorrow.

I’ve not been able to post the past few days due to poor service but for some reason this morning I have some service.  The trail has been nothing short of amazing, wonderful and difficult. We thought we would be hiking more than 8-9 miles a day but our legs and lungs are not used to the Georgia mountains. Miles will come in time. 
We’ve stayed near shelters and have been surrounded by other hikers every night but when we hike, we often feel like we are the only ones out in the trail. 
Yesterday as we crossed Woody gap we were able to drop our garbage and eat lunch at a picnic table. All things that felt like gifts. It’s the simple things on the trail that bring joy. 
Today we will hike to over 5,000 feet to Blood Mt and then descend to Neel Gap.  The uphill will be tough but It’s the descent that I’m not looking forward to(joint pain!).  Thankfully at Neel Gap we will have our first opportunity to resupply. Right now, my motivation is a cold drink and some hot food!

Many quit the AT after Blood Mountain but thankfully we feel excited by conquering the mountain.  Since we came in so early & we smell worse than a locker room full of sweaty hockey players, we checked into Blood Mountain Cabins.  It felt amazing to take a shower and they caretakers will do your laundry!😳.

Tonight we are camping at Low Gap Shelter. There are about 15 tents currently but I’m sure a few more hikers will come in later tonight. The miles today are NOT Michigan miles. We did over 2,000 ft ascent and 2,000 ft descent. These are not Michigan miles! Unfortunately, my knees felt today 😩 but I’m hopeful tomorrow they will feel better. Prayers appreciated 🙏
Tomorrow we set off for Cheese Factory camping site on Tray Mt.  We will increase our mileage to 13.5 but we have an alternative stopping point if we cannot do the whole 13.5.  Unfortunately at Cheese Factory there is no cheese or factory.  Instead it’s the site of an old cheese factory.

Today’s hike was an ass kicker!  We hiked 13 miles on a roller coaster - one mile up then one mile down.  My legs are feeling the burn of too many climbs and my knees are feeling the descent.  But at the end of an exhausting hike, we were met with our first Trail Magic👏.  


Trail Magic is when people position themselves along the trail & typically at road crossings to provide food/drinks to hikers. Today the Kentucky Krew a family of AT hikers from 2020 made us hiker trash food. 😳. The meal consisted of a pancake with peanut butter, maple syrup and a hot dog. You roll the pancake around the hot dog and eat. Truthfully it was really good but I was REALLY hungry. The family providing the meal were extremely nice and they even had a beautiful chocolate lab we could pet🐶. 


We then hitched into Hiawasse, GA and are spending the night at a Holiday Inn. Eric and I had dinner from a local restaurant and are looking forward to sleeping in a bed tonight. 
Tomorrow we will head back out to the trail but we are doing a “Nero” day (Nero means you do not hike a full day), we will only do 4 miles tomorrow. It will be nice “rest” day❤️

We crossed into North Carolina today 👏 One state done and 13 more to go😳 the NC-GA line is at mile 78.5 and shortly after is Bly Gap which is known for the oldest tree on the AT. Once I have better service I will post a picture of the crossing and the tree. 


Today’s hike was good. My legs and lungs are feeling stronger with each day. The sun helped ease the coldness of the day. We spent the day hiking with hats, gloves & puffy jackets. Tonight we will wear all our clothes as we snuggle in our sleeping bags.  


Tonight we are staying at Standing Indian Shelter(mile 86.3).  Our 12 mile hike was easier than the last few days. We even had a few “Michigan Miles” (we call anything flatish a Michigan Mile).

Eric & Shelly Cornish,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633013,"Our night in Hiawasse left us feeling refreshed and today we only hiked 4 miles to Plum Orchard Shelter(mile 74.1). We were not exhausted from the hike so we could socialize around the fire with a few other hikers. We met a nice crew of similar aged hikers from Pennsylvania. As I write Eric, is still hanging out at the fire. I think for him, it was nice to have some male companionship since he’s been hiking with a group of girls since Springer. 


Tonight it is suppose to get down into the 30s, so I’m hoping we stay warm in our tent😳🙏.  Thankfully the days have been sunny and clear sky. Hiking is so much more enjoyable in the sun.  


Tomorrow we cross the line into our 2nd state, North Carolina👏.  We will cross between NC and Tennessee for the 386.7 miles.  Georgia was only 78.5 miles which took us 9 days.

We flew through that first 100 miles by doing 16 miles yesterday😳.  Many of the miles were Michigan Miles and the warmth of the sun helped the miles to fly by.  However, climbing Albert Mountain (5,250) was extremely technical and difficult. I was physically spent by the time we set up camp at 4:30 and Eric confirms that I was snoring by 8:00.


Trail Magic👏❤️.  The first was at Rock Gap and this lovely couple whose son was hiking had fresh fruit and candy bars. They also had a yellow lab dog that provided plenty of puppy love ❤️🐶 These people are from Florida and they are slack packing their son the first two weeks of his hike and providing trail magic during the day. They were so kind and it’s such a surprise to receive Trail Magic, that I cried😢.  


Second Trail Magic-This woman from New York (actress) was slack packing her boyfriend while he hiked.  Just like the other couple, she was doing trail Magic during the day. She served us Yuengling beer and pretzels. Eric was super excited to by drinking a beer at 11:30am!


Tonight we are staying at Grooder Grove Hostel. Eric and I have a semi private room (ie, a futon in their living room...but we are showered and laundry will be starting soon. The rest of the hikers are in a bunk room in the basement.  We both weighed ourselves on the scale in the bathroom.

Names typically come from something you do as a hiker or are given to you by another hiker. We’ve encountered a variety of hikers with some great names: 9 to 5(a stock trader who is still working from home & brought a laptop), bake potato( a kid from CA who sleeps with a fool emergency blanket wrapped around him), Tinker (70 year old guy who has thru hiked many times and is full of stories), Deadman(a minister from Mississippi), and Dash(Alison who hiked extremely fast).  
My trail name came from an incident that happened on the first day. It was rainy and cold and when we stopped for lunch, we made a hot meal. Eric was still cold so I offered to make hot chocolate.  I rummaged through my bag and found what I thought was a cafe latte, not hot chocolate. I poured it into the cup and added extra because the color didn’t look quite right. Eric took one sip and about spit it out. It turns out that cafe latte wasn’t cafe latte, instead it was Metamucil!  The drink tasted like warm orange slime. The girls immediately said, your name should be Meta for Metamucil🤪.
Eric has been resistance to a Trail Name but the girls helped name him.  Eric has been a gazelle on the trail. He leads the way and with his long legs he bounds up the mountains.  He also is wise and helpful to the girls. He has helped with broken gear and hanging bear bags.  The girls felt he should be called Grasshopper and he accepted 👏.","

We spent our Zero day eating, drinking and relaxing around the cute city of Franklin, NC.  Staying in the hostel allowed us to reconnect with hikers we met earlier on the trail. It also allowed the girls we’ve been hiking with to take some much needed rest and buy some new shoes.  The girls decided to sleep in and do a shorted hike today as they continue to heal their feet as well as break in their new shoes. Eric and I decided to hike ahead today as we have a zero day we are taking next Monday. 


Our hike today started at Winding Gap and as we entered the trail we were immediately hit with the smell of smoke from the controlled burn last night. The trail itself was untouched but all around us the charred land looked eerie.  It was almost like being in a movie for a dystopian story.  I was amazed to learn that yesterday around 30 hikers waited at Winding Gap  for the trail to open. The fire fighters opened the trail at 6pm and many hikers decided to begin hiking. 😳. This morning as we hiked the smell was strong, I cannot image hiking in last night!


We past through the burn zoom about 5 miles into our 11 mile hike.  The sun was shining and it was warm enough to hike in only a T-shirt.  My legs and knees felt refreshed from our zero day.  We had some interesting and engaging conversations with a 72 year old hiker named Der, Die, Das(he was born in Detroit but know lives in Kansas).  I think Eric enjoyed having a guy to talk to for once on the trail. We crossed over a handful of roads and were able to see some great views from Wayah Bald(5,342).  Tonight we camp outside the Wayah Shelter(mile 120).  


In the morning we are hoping to hike 16 miles to the NOC. The NOC has a Outfitter store, cabins and some restaurants.  Our goal is to eat dinner at the NOC.  Also we have packages waiting for us and we are excited to get our Girl Scout cookies!

 Today marks two weeks on the trail!  Wow! In some ways it feels longer and some ways shorter.  But what I can say is that we both are really liking the rhythm & challenge of being on the trail.  


We’ve also learned that occasionally comforts go a long way. I’m writing this journal from the comfort of a king sized bed😳. Eric and I hiked 16.5 miles today to the NOC (Nantahala Outdoor Center)-mile 137.  We decided that whenever the trail crossed a place that offers housing, we are happy to spend the night off trail. It’s makes pushing 16.5 miles a little easier when you know you’ll get a shower and a comfy bed. 


Today we summited Wesser Bald (4,627’) and the descent was one of the most technical we’ve experienced so far. I’ll try to post some pictures but I’m not sure they will accurately capture the difficulty of the descent.  Thankfully we had sun and not rain for this descent.   


One of the interesting parts of being on the trail is that Eric and I are both having some pretty crazy dreams. I truthfully do not ever remember dreaming so much. Other hikers are reporting the same.  The other crazy part is my hair and nails are growing rapidly.  Eric is sporting a start of a beard and my legs/pits look like a pre-pubescent boy. Even my crazy single chin hair seems to sprout faster on the trail🤪


At the NOC we picked up our first packages. It was great to have a little touch of home and the notes from friends and family made me cry.  Eric just cleared a whole box of Girl Scout cookies in about 10 minutes and I’m working my way through a sleeve of Thin Mints.  I think we earned these calories👍.


My feet are tired and I’m ready to call it a night. Sweet dreams my friends. 


Blessings- sun, making it safely though the tough descent, and Trail Magic this morning that included a beer and wine!

Eric and I left the NOC with packs that were overflowing😳. I sent way too much food in the resupply box and we decided to take it all so that we don’t hsve to resupply prior to the Great Smokey Mts.  This was a BIG mistake!  The extra food added an additional 10 pounds to each our packs and made for a slow climb today.  The climb out of the NOC is probably the toughest climb we’ve ever done.  It varied from rocks to roots to steep inclines. The extra weight made every step difficult and the rain from last night made the trail slippery.  We left the NOC at around 2,300 feet and climbed to nearly 5,000 feet over the course of 7 miles then we descended again!  Somehow we managed to pull off 10 miles today. I believe I’ve gotten my trail legs and am surprised at how strong we both were today. We hiked part of yesterday and today with Orlando (guy from Orlando🤪).  The good conversation helped to pass the time. Orlando is also 49 and he said that I hike at a faster pace then him.  I’ll take the complement today 👏


Tonight we are camping with a few others at Locust Cove Gap (mile 147.5). We ate the heaviest items in our pack which included the last sleeve of Thin Mints❤️.

We woke up to rain and with the time change, it was still dark out at 6am.  I went outside to pee and decided it might be good to stay snuggled in our tents for another 30 minutes to an hour. Eric and I set out in the rainy most but it soon turned partly sunny. We spent the day hiking in a humid rainforest .  Spring is definitely on the horizon and we’ve noticed many signs: small buds on trees, green moss covering rocks and ferns are starting to peak out. Yesterday I saw my first snake😳. Thankfully it was a baby snake & only about 5 inches long.  I’m not happy that it’s warm enough for snakes to come out!


Strangely enough on Day 17 we did 17.7 miles!  Eric and I pushed to Fontana Dam today(mile 164).  We will take a rest day on Monday because I have a board meeting and Eric has some emails he needs to address. We also will prepare to enter the Great Smokey Mountains. Once we enter GSM we will be in the park until
we finish the 70 miles. I’m not sure what our phone service will look like but I may be out of touch for week. 


Last night we camped with Orlando (who does look a little bit like Orlando Bloom) and two other men who are Eric’s age. I cannot remember their names but it we joked it was the retirement section of the AT🤪.  It actually was fun to sit around and talk with guys and they all were impressed that Eric convinced his wife to hike.  Eric quickly told them that it was actually my idea to do the trail.  The guys were impressed ❤️.  As we were talking one of the young gun hikers we know, Jake Ryan (yes, his mom named him after the character in Sixteen Candles) came hiking by our camp. Jake (trail name -Flash) was going to hike into the night and complete the 17 miles to Fontana which would bring his daily total at 28😳.  What’s so amazing about Flash is he is 17 & just graduated early from a high school in Texas. He also fuels his body with Cheetos, gummies, and peanut M&Ms!  Eric and o met him a few days ago and we watched him consume his junk food dinner.  Eric gave him a high five when Flash finished the bag of Cheetos🤪


We are now are at Fontana and we see no sign of Flash.  Perhaps we will catch him in the GSM.

span class=""Apple-converted-space""> The day started with rain and wind but as we hiked into the Great Smoky Mountains, the rain stop but the mist/fog circled around us all day.  


We hiked from 1,650 ft to almost 4,000ft with a 16.5 mile day and we are spending the night at Russell Field Shelter.  We also hit mile 180👏. It’s our first night in a shelter and I’m a little nervous about mice and bugs😳. The National Park requires hikers to stay in the shelter but they’ve opened up some tenting due to Covid. To protect myself from mice and germs, I slept cocooned in my sleeping bag liner. Most of the people around us have been on the trail for weeks, so we are praying everyone is safe. It is also going to thunderstorm tonight and we don’t want to have a soaked tent. Prayers for a safe night 🙏


Orlando and Jake Ryan are at that shelter with us. Jake had his typical M&Ms, gummy & Cheetos meal. I’m really not sure how he powers himself on this junk food diet but his feet carry him far each day.  We just met another hiker couple, Chia & Mocha. It was fun to talk to another hiker couple. They have had learn how to pace together. Much like Eric, Mocha  long legs means he can hike faster than Chia.  Most hikers are single males either in their late teens/twenties or just retired.  There are a handful of girls on her trail but they are outnumbered by boys. Married couples are a rare breed in the trail.

Finally at a little before 6am, I woke Eric and he went out with me to pee. We tried our best to be quiet but it was clear that we woke others.


Now it appears that someone is beginning to get ready for the days hike. They are packing up their gear even though it is not yet light out.  Eric and I like to leave camp early but I like to have at least the sun up for us the hike. 


Our plan today is to hike another 16-20 miles. We are headed toward the highest point in the AT, Clingmen’s Dome.  We will pass through Rocky Top and Thunder Mt. The GSM are 70 miles long and we are hoping to finish the park in 4.5 days. The park services provides guidance of taking no more than 7 days to hike the entire 70 miles. 


Well best laid plans...we hiked only 9.5 miles today. They were tough miles and included a great panoramic view of the Smoky’s from Rocky Top. We ended up stopping for the night at Derrick Knob Shelter due to rain, wind, and tired legs.

Well it stormed all night 😳.  The Smokies were hit with a severe thunderstorm with high winds and hail.  Thankfully the storm did not hit until we had finished hiking for the day. Once again, we stayed at a shelter and were relatively warm.🙏❤️.  I woke up throughout the night to the sounds of the storm and I prayed that those sleeping in their tents were safe.

We were hoping for a slight break in the weather before we headed out. Looking over Guthooks (app that uses GPS and overviews the trail) we knew we had 6 miles to the next shelter and over 16 miles to a road were we might be able to get a shuttle. We set off planning on 6 miles but hoping for 16 miles. 


>span class=""s3"">👏. 


At the end of the day, we completed 13.5 miles and spent the night in Mt Collins Shelter. 


— Day 22


We woke to snow covering the ground, which is not surprising for Smokies but not what we wanted today.  Last night we slept as well as you can in a shelter and were warm in our sleeping bags.  Reluctantly we slid our dry socks into ziplock bags and then into our wet and cold boots.  We set off before anyone else left the shelter and the hike out was beautiful (see the pictures). 


Despite being warmish and happy to be hiking,  my mind began to think of what tonight would be like. We were wet. It was cold.  This was not a good combination for a hiker in the Smokies in March.  I began to worry that it might not be smart to push through the last 35 miles to exit the Smokies.  Our food supply was considerably low and I knew we’d have to ration to make the 35 mile hike 😬.  Eric and I had talked about making the push to get out of the Smokies but I was beginning to doubt that push. 


As we neared Newfound Gap(5 miles) we began seeing day hikers which meant the Gap was open 👏.  I could hear the cars before I could see them but as I turned the corner into the parking lot, I was shocked to see so many cars and people.  The group we’ve been hiking with were sitting along a brick wall and as we approached them, a man stepped out of a red van. Normally this would be a creepy encounter but on the AT, this is always magically.  Shawn(the red van man), asked if we were thru-hikers and if we were hungry.  Before we could even answer he brought out donuts, soda, and snickers👏.  Accepting food from a stranger has become one of the blessings of the trail.  Shawn hiked the PCT and now is a family man who dreams of hiking again. He does Trail Magic to stay connected and give back.  As we talked more, Shawn offered to give our group a ride into Gatlinburg👏. Again, this would be creepy and ill advised in the real world but on that trail, this is considered Trail Magic.  Fast forward 8 hours and I’m happy showered, well feed, and sitting in a warm hotel room!  


Tomorrow we will head back out to finish the Smokies. We have 35 miles until we are out of GSM and 70 until Hot Springs, NC.

Gaitlynburg was good for a quick resupply, shower and sleep but the city itself was a cross between LasVegas and a trailer park. Too many people, strange entertainment like Ripley’s Believe It or Not and street food. It is a sharp contrast to the peacefulness of hiking the trail. Some hikers decided to take a zero day but Eric and I were ready to be back on trail. 


We headed back to Newfound Gap with Orlando and Happy (a good Iowa boy who is super nice). The trailhead was packed with day hikers and it was crowded all the way past Charles Bunion. The trail was also slippery and icy for a good portion of the 11 mile day. Snow still covers some of the ground and ice was falling from the trees. Thankfully even though we felt a little bit like Bambi on ice we were able to safely navigate the trail (pictures and video to come as service allows).  


span class=""Apple-converted-space""> Hemlock and evergreen trees filled the trail and it’s a wonderful smell that I wish I could bottle.  I did tuck a small twig of an evergreen leaf(?) into my bag as a reminder .

We had the coldest night we’ve had on trail and the hike out in the morning was really cold as well. Snow still lingers on the ground and ice has formed on the trail. We were sleeping at about 6,000 ft but as we descended in elevation the weather warmed up and the sun came out👏. I ended the day with only a short sleeve shirt. 


We left early from Peck’s Corner Shelter and decided to spend the day hiking as far as we could go. In the Smokies you have to stay in designated shelters due to bear activity which limits where you can sleep.  Around 3 we summited Mt. Guyot (6,360’) and decided that because it was such a nice day we’d push ahead to Davenport Gap Shelter which made fir a 21 mile day 😳. Needless to say my feet are tired!

We left the Smokies this morning!  They were beautiful beyond words but the Smokies makes it’s own weather.  We experienced the scariest thunderstorm of my life and the most extreme weather (I can say this now that we are through the Smokies)😬.  It also had the best views and such diverse terrain.  I consider it a milestone to have completed a hike through the Great Smokie Mountain👏.


We crossed under I-40 on the AT which was a a strange experience. The blazes were painted along the guard rail and the traffic wizzed by.  It was a stark contrast to the peaceful start to our morning.  


We hiked 10.5 miles today due to the fact I have my first blister on the trail. I think we might have overdone it yesterday. Tonight we are staying at Groundhog Creek Shelter (mile 248).  In the morning we will summit Max Patch which is one of the famous landmarks on trail.  It also was made famous in the movie,  “A Walk in the Woods.”  As I hiked today I was reflecting on Bill Bryson’s book and movie.   It was an enjoyable read but now that I’ve lived the trail for 25 days I have to say that the book should be retitled, “A Walk Up and Down Every Mountain Range Between Georgia and Maine” My title is definitely wordy but it’s a far more truthful🤪.

We had surprise Trail Magic at a small service road. The guy was a former thru-hiker and had donuts, beer, TP, and a charging block. Since it was only 9:30 in the morning, Eric and I split a beer and decided to carry one out for dinner. He and his girlfriend are starting that CDT next week and they wanted to spread a little Magic before they left.  We certainly appreciated it., especially the TP...we were almost out 🤪.

We woke up early and we’re hiking by 6:45am. I was fueled by the fact that we’d be in Hot Springs today and my mind was full of food wishes.  Our headlights blazed the trail but the foggy conditions made the miles seem slow until the sun came out.  The terrain was a little easier today and we quickly covered the 11.5 miles in to Hot Springs. 


We arrived at Laughing Heart Lodge around 12 and immediately jump in the shower. It’s amazing how much dirt, body odor, and pee smell you can take on without showering for 4-5 days. We don’t wear deodorant because it’s extra weight and it’s impossible to stay clean while wearing the same clothes every day(we each have one set of hiking clothes, one set of sleeping clothes and one cold weather layering pants/shirt).  Then we gather all our dirty clothes and wash them while wearing either or rain jacket & rain skirt or borrowing “loaner clothes” from the hostel. 


Once clean, we head into town to eat a late lunch. We decide to eat at the Smokey Mountain Diner because we heard they have great food. I order a fried green tomato BLT sandwich with a cucumber salad and Eric orders a Philly Cheese Steak with sweet potatoes fries.  Eric walks around the restaurant as we are waiting for our food and notices that Warren Doyle is there!  Needless to say we were excited to see him and spent almost an hour catching up with him about our thru-hike.  For those who don’t know, Warren Doyle has hiked the AT 18 times and we took his Appalachian Trail Institute course in the fall.  It was great to catch up with him.

It will be great to see them and catch up with them🥰.  I can hardly wait to see my niece and nephews! 


We plan on heading back out tomorrow after meeting with Meredith’s family. We head into a 70 mile section of the AT which should take us about 4-5 days.  We will jump to over 300 miles on this section and will likely duck in for a week quick resupply in Erwin, TN.  Some of our trail friends are already on the trail today 😳.  But one of the best things about the trail is that we know we will leapfrog each other and then catch back up in a day or so. 


Today we’ve also enjoyed our luxury item which is a Kindle Paperwhite. I’m a book girl and I knew that carrying books would add extra weight to my pack but with a Kindle I could have a whole library in my pack. Even though I has previously fought buying a Kindle, it seemed like the only way I could keep my books with me on the trail.

We start hiking and a mile of two down the trail we will stop to admire a view and eat our breakfast.  For lunch we typically stop for 30-40 minutes either at a shelter or a view.  We often take off our boots for a minute while we eat to give our feet a rest. Lunch is usually a combination of one of the following: tortilla with tuna or peanut butter & then nuts/dried fruit. We might also snack on some nuts or if Eric has a bag of cheetos, then we indulge🤪.  We also eat cheese and salami for lunch with a baguette if I’m lucky to find a baguette at a local grocery store.  Usually a snickers or payday bar will conclude lunch. Dinner is typically a hot meal (boil water and add to a dehydrated meal). We do a rota of the following: Mountain House dehydrated meals, instant potatoes with bacon bits, oatmeal with added fruit/nuts and ramen noodles.   It’s all about light and convenient foods and food that can fill you up. 


Here’s an example what’s is typically in our food bag:


Oatmeal packets 
Cashews
Pistachios without shells
A mix of dried fruit-coconut, mango and raisins
Tortillas
Peanut butter
Small honey packets
Cliff bars
Tuna packets
Pepperoni
Slim Jim’s & Beef Jerky
Sharp cheddar cheese or Gouda
Fig Newton’s 
Rice Cakes
Fig Newtons

Bacon bits
Stove Top Stuffing-dinner mixed with the following:
-gravy packet 
-chicken packet
Smarties or Sweet Tarts
Parmesan Crisps
Snickers and Payday bars (so far we’ve eaten 27 candy bars since we started the trail 😳)
M&Ms
Dried spinach to add to Ramen or potatoes 
Dried strawberries to add up oatmeal or PB
Taco Bell sauce (compliments of my brother Christopher) 
A few packets of Mayo and mustard from fast food places 
We also might have a small bottle of whiskey or a airplane sized plastic bottle of wine. 




On the trail you dream about food😳.  Typically as we approach a town Eric and I are trying to figure out what we want to eat - burgers, salad, big breakfasts, pizza, ice cream, and fried chicken👏","

Today we took another Zero Day 😳.  Ironically Eric hurt his foot in our room and not on the trail. We thought one day of rest would be enough but when we tried to hike out today, Eric was limping before we even got to the trail.   We felt it was better for him to be off his foot for another day. He stayed at Laughing Heart and I brought him food and beers. He made friends quickly because I bought a case of Bell’s Two Hearted IPA  and he spent the afternoon drinking 🤪.  Prayers that he’s able to hike tomorrow 🙏


My sister Meredith and her family met us for breakfast this morning in Hot Springs. It was great seeing them! They are on there way to Florida for Spring Break and they brought us some new gear & supplies. We also sent home our heavy sleeping bags, some extra clothes. and our REI 3-season tent.  Our packs feel lighter with the new gear and we weighed them at the local outfitters. With full gear, hiking poles, water and 6-7 days of food we both weighed in at 29 pounds👏.  


It was great to catch up with them and they are doing a great job on the trail.  They sped through the Smokies in only 5 days👏.  I’m certain they will speed past both Eric and I. 


Tonight we enjoy the comforts of a cozy bed but I’m anxious to get back on the trail tomorrow.

The trail greeted us with a series thunderstorms and fog. Despite the weather, it felt good to be back on the trail. Eric’s foot is still tender but he felt good enough for us to hike 13 miles today. We actually were trying to push a few more miles but thankfully we came upon one of our friends, Papa Root(retired military from Illinois).  We decided to camp along side of Papa Root at a trail crossing (mile 287).  I think it was good for Eric to get off of his feet.  Prayers that he didn’t over do it today.


Our hike today consisted of walking down the Main Street of Hot Springs (one of a few towns in which the trail actually runs on a city sidewalk), then up Lover’s Leap, past a pond, over many small mountains, crossing a few service roads and finally arriving at our camp site. 


About 10 miles into our hike, I stopped because I thought I heard a bell ringing lightly. When I looked around, I didn’t see anyone else coming down the trail. Then I thought perhaps something on my pack was jingling but the ringing continued.  Once Eric caught up with me(today was the first time I was a faster hiker than him) I asked him if he heard the ringing. He did not hear anything.  


I surveyed around the trail and I found that there were about 5 large stones all in a circle😳. Now as an avid fan of The Outlander series, I immediate turned to Eric and said, “I think I’m a traveler! I hear ringing while standing near a stone circle. Should I touch these stones?”  Eric’s response was, “The Fraser’s did live for a time in North Carolina. Perhaps we are on Fraser’s Ridge.” I thought for a moment about touching the stones to see if I might fly back in time but I decided against leaving my wonderful life.  ❤️


We continued our hike and I realized that I didn’t take a picture of the stones😳. I didn’t want to hike back to grab a picture, so I took one looking back at the stones ( I’ll post when I have WiFi). I told Eric that someday I’ll come back to these stones with all my girlfriends who also have read The Outlander series or watched the movie.  Any takers?!😳🤪

It rained most of the night but I did hear some owls hooting sometime during the night.  A few times I hear a loud crash and I worried that it was our bear bag falling out of the tree. Last night we had a difficult time finding a suitable tree to hang our bear bag(a bag that contains food and anything smelly like wipes).  We did our best but it wasn’t very high.  I’m praying that out food is still there🙏 


Today we are hoping to push to 20 miles and stay near Flint Mt Shelter. Obviously it will depend on how Eric is feeling and what the weather is like.  We always start the day with two plans: one a moderate length and the other one a little shorter.  


It is now 5pm and we hiked through rain all day long😳.  Needless to say our shoes are soaked and our rain gear is wet. Rain gear is strange because it does keep you dry but as you hike you sweat which causes wetness to increase on the inside of the jacket! 🤬 It’s a no win situation. You are wet both inside and out! 🤪.  We pushed hard today and managed to hike 14 miles to Jerry Cabin Shelter which is mike 301.7👏.  It was a hard hike today because the trail was full of water and we felt like we were waking though a stream for most of the day.  Tonight we are sleeping in the shelter because the ground is soaked and we are trying to dry both our gear and ourselves out!

I’ve mentioned before that things on the trail seem to go in extremes.  Yesterday we experienced bitter rain and wind all day long. Then last night the temps dropped down below 30 and today I was hiking in a tank top with the sun shining down.  


With the extreme temperature drop my 20 year old Kelty sleeping bag was put to the test!  I was cold from being rained on all dry.  Everything on me was wet and I put on ALL my dry clothes before bed. I used both my sleep liner and Eric’s. I slept with my winter hat and gloves on. I was still cold!  Papa Grout gave me an emergency bivy to put around my bag and I finally feel asleep.  Around 1am I woke up freezing and woke Eric to see if he would give me his puffy jacket.  Thankful he did & I wrapped his puffy around my legs. I was not warm but not freezing throughout the rest of the night. 


The first few miles of hiking I felt like I was walking on an ice cube and I truthfully worried I would have frost bitten toes😳.  Thankfully the more we moved, the warmer everything became and as the sun came up we were finally warm enough to begin the hiker striptease (taking off clothes throughout the day). 


As we hiked we decided that I needed a new sleeping bag(truthfully I shouldn’t have sent home my winter sleeping bag -rated to 15 degrees). We called a shuttle driver we found on Guthooks, Zach from Traveling Light.  Zach turned out to be a great blessing. Instead of taking us off trail to buy a new sleeping bag, Zach picked up two sleeping bags and brought them to the trail!  He literally met us at a road crossing with the two bags!  We paid him for the new Marment bag and a small amount for his service.  Zach is a former thru hiker and his goal his to keep hikers on the trail. He definitely helped keep me on the trail today. I was able to hike a full day and right now I’m snuggling in a WARM sleeping bag👏.  I’m very thankful that I reached out to Zach(picture of Zach will be posted when I have WiFi).


We hiked 15.7 miles today over both Big Butt Mt(4,750’) and then over Frozen Knob(4,579’). Tonight we are camping at Hogback Ridge Shelter(mile 317). It turned out to be a great day for hiking! 


Tomorrow looks like another sunny day but the rain comes back on Wednesday. We are hoping to hike on Wednesday but stay in a hostel Wednesday night so we can dry out from the rain.

It was a great day to hike even though the day started cold it ended with a sunny sky. We hiked 13.5 miles today over both Big Bald(5,516’) and Little Bald. The views from Big Bald were stunning. We could see mountain ranges for miles and the perfect blue hue created by North Carolina mountains. 


Our day started with Trail Magic at Sam’s Gap (US 23 & I-26). We were greeted with scrambled eggs, hash browns, Orange Crush(Eric’s favorite), and he offered to take our garbage.  Quiet Paul, retired Marine and thru-hiker, whipped up 8 scrambled eggs for Eric and I.  Thankfully Eric helped me finish my plate 😳.  Quiet Paul used a phrase I’ve heard a few times on the trail, “No rain, no pain, no Maine.”  You cannot make it to Maine without walking in the rain & we’ve certainly had our share of rain lately.  


Tonight we are camping at Whistle Gap (mile 330).  We’ve been hiking with Papa Grout (retired military from Indiana) and Wallsy (retired Marine and firefighter from Pennsylvania).  Both are great guys.  


It is suppose to rain tomorrow and then snow the next day. Together we decided to hike tomorrow to Erwin, TN and stay the night at a hotel. This will allow us to dry off before the snow comes. We will get up at 5am to hike the 13 miles to Erwin.  I’ll be motivated by clean clothes, a shower, and a restaurant meal👏.

We woke up to rain this morning and at first I was not happy to be hiking in the rain again, however, the day turned out to be pretty amazing.  I’ve discovered that most day hikers do not hike in the rain and as a result, we felt like we had the trail all to ourselves this morning. 


We left camp at 6am and as we were packing up I discovered that the battery to my headlights was dead. The sun would not be up for another hour and a half. I plugged the battery into the Anchor battery pack and prayed that I could get an hour charge out of a quick charging session.  The hike was foggy and misty but thankfully the charge held out till the sun came up.  I even snapped a picture of us hiking this morning in the rain with the headlamps.  The 13.5 miles were fairly easy compared to many of the miles we’ve done up to this point which made the hike fun. The rain lasted most of the morning but it was not cold or windy.  By the time we hit the trailhead at Erwin, TN the rain had stopped. 


Tonight we are staying in a Super 8 Hotel to dry out our wet gear and to avoid the impending snowstorm forecasted for tonight.  We hike a full day and it feels good to take a shower, wash our clothes, and dry out our gear(Eric is taking the blow drier to our shoes as I type this journal!). We enjoyed dinner at a Southern fast food chain, BoJangles (pimento cheese, fried chicken and mashed potatoes).  


Tomorrow we are slack-packing (not taking our full packs) which will allow us to add some miles. Our driver will drop us off at Iron Mt Gap and we will hike 20 miles back to Erwin(going South instead of North but covering miles we have not covered yet).  Slack-packing will give our bodies a break from our 30 pound packs and allow us to add some extra miles to our legs.  We are hoping to finish Tennessee/North Carolina by Sunday which means we will jump into Virginia👏.

I thought about playing an April Fools joke and telling everyone we’ve decided to get off the trail but I decided against it. One of our trail mates called his wife and told her that he was coming home and fell for the joke.  We actually didn’t hike today, so the April fools joke was on us today.  We had arranged a shuttle to take us up and take us to Iron MT Gap and we would hike 20 miles back to Erwin. We woke up early, got breakfast at both McDonalds and Dunkin Donuts. Yes, hiker hunger has kicked in 🤪


We then waited and waited for our driver.  I finally texted him.  Unfortunately I made a mistake when I texted him originally and I asked him to pick us up on Friday instead Thursday...I’m blaming it on my middle aged brain🤪.  So we are taking a rest day.  Eric is taking a nap and I’m relaxing.  Truthfully it is very cold today and snowing on the mountain so a Zero Day is probably a good thing. 


I’ve confirmed and reconfirmed that we are all set for tomorrow mornings 20 mile hike. 


Tonight we will head out for a big meal and either an Italian or Mexican restaurant.  It will be nice to have another restaurant meal👏

On a side note, I’m not sure if I have talked about the demographics of the hikers we are around.  Initially on the trail the population was more diverse with ages and genders.  Now that many hikers have gotten off trail, the  demographics seem to have changed.  Now it appears to be older (40<) or younger (25 >).  Hikers tend to be mostly male (70%) and during the last five days of hiking I’ve been the only female at a campsite.  We’ve also met many students taking gap years between high school and college OR after college before the real world.  There are many retired military, law enforcement, and those in academia.  We’ve not met anyone else from Michigan yet but we’ve encountered people from all over the states.  It will be interesting to see how the demographics change as as continue our hike.

We were able to slack pack today and not having our 30 pound back on our back meant we could move faster than we normally do. We were dropped off at Iron Mt Gap at 10:30 and it took us until 5:45 to hike 20 miles (mile 364) back to Erwin. The first part of the day was cold and snow covered the trail.  We moved fast so we could stay warm. As hikers moved past us going North all commented on how cold the trail was last night. Those who slept on trail reported temps in the low teens and that their water bottles all froze😳.  Eric and I are thankful that we stayed last night in a hostel and that we are staying tonight. We were even fortunate to have a trail friend bring us dinner tonight so that we didn’t have to cook❤️. 


We ran into the girls we started the trail with and it was fun to catch up with them.  They have been slack packing and Mossy’s mom has been taking great care of them with home cooked meals.   We hiked the last four miles of our day together which helped the last miles to fly by👏.  The girls all have trail names now and they fit them perfectly: Giggles, Goose, & Mossy. 


20 miles was a good day and I’m exhausted.  We will head back up to the trail tomorrow and hike up Roan Mt.

Unfortunately the shelter had NO views and it smelled like pee😳.  It was also like ice skating today with ice covered trails.  We decided to hike on and are staying on a bald that has amazing views!  


We had a great day of hiking with sunny skies and very little wind. At one  point I had stripped down to just a T-shirt but now I’m back to my puffy/hat.  For dinner we will dine on mashed potatoes with dried spinach and Parmesan crisps.  Yum!

We slept near Carver’s Gap at a stealth spot but it turned out to be a terrible site for a tent. The area we picked was super windy and I got up twice to make sure our tent stakes were holding down the rain fly. The wind was relentless but I’m thankful it did not rain. Instead I was dry and warmish but was kept awake by the extreme wind.  Needless to say. I did not sleep well. 


Our hike today covered 14 miles and is known as the Roan Highlands. It was beautiful crossing balds and small forests.  We hike both Little Hump Mt and Hump Mt(both over 5,000’ and each had a climb of almost 2 miles to the summit😳). Both mountains kicked my butt and my lungs. I’d say they are both Big Hump Mt! 


We ended our day crossing out of NC👏.  Both TN and NC crisscross the AT but today we finished our 2nd state! Tonight we are sleeping at Mt Harbor Hostel (mile 395).  This hostel is right off the trail and was hard to pass up. They offer free laundry, a food truck with great burgers, and a variety of beers. They even have Bell’s Oberon👏❤️.  We followed a group of 20 year olds off the trail to the hostel who were determined to eat and drink themselves silly before heading back on the trail. They spent the afternoon hanging out and now are back on the trail. I cannot imagine hiking after drinking now but in my 20s, I probably could drink and hike.  Eric and I happy being the middle aged couple who is “platinum blazing” because we occasionally sleep in a real bed.

Yesterday we indulged and decided to stay another night so today we slacked-packing 10 miles today. We hit 400 miles today 👏.  


  Our hike today was glorious! It was sunny and warm.  We took a side trail and saw a big waterfall (picture to be uploaded soon).  It was nice to be hiking on our own time and know exactly where we are staying.

Since we started the trail we have noticed one bird more than others, Dark-eyed Juncos.  These sparrows are birds of the ground and are almost like a mouse. They hop around the bases of trees and shrubs in forests looking for food. I’ve been hiking and these birds will hop around the trail in front of me. They have a high chip and fly low across the ground. I’ve tried to snap a photo but mine have not turned out. Here’s one I took off google images:





 Spring is definitely in the air. Leaves have not started to come out yet but we have noticed flowers and ferns.  I noticed a small critter in the leaves today but I’m not sure what it was. The movement startled me and I about fell over thinking it was a snake😳


Today we hiked 16.5 miles through some of the most beautiful waterfalls and rock formations.  Laurel Falls is stunning and it’s one place we will definitely come back to hike. The trailhead is right out of Hampton, TN. If you’d like to hike part of the AT, I’d definitely recommend Laurel Falls(pictures to come). We are at mike 425!  Only 45 miles till we hit Virginia.

Tomorrow presents the opportunity to stop at The Rabbit Hole Hostile for a famous AT milkshake.  It’s very tempting to take a break from hiking for one of these shakes.  I’ll share what we decide to do in tomorrow’s update.  Tonight for dinner I tried to get a little fancy, aka hiker gourmet. I ordered dried eggs off Amazon and I tried to create a burrito (Taco Bell sauce -thanks to brother Christopher, bacon bits and dehydrated eggs.

Milkshake, milkshake, milkshake, and one more milkshake! Four milkshakes for Eric and two for me😳.  We hiked 11.5 miles to get a milkshake at the Rabbit Hole Hostel on Hopper Lane(you cannot make up stuff like this!).  We started with a strawberry shake and then had a second shake(cookies & creme for me and a peanut butter for Eric). Eric and our friend, Der Die Das each had a third milkshake (chocolate).  Eric’s forth was another peanut butter shake 😳.  All I can say is that we are hungry!  It’s impossible to keep your body full of calories so when we can eat, we eat!  
After our stop at Rabbit Hole, our bellies were overflowing.  We got back on the trail and hiked another 3.5 miles to Double Spring Shelter(14.5 miles total). The weather turned a little cooler and overcast but it was a nice change from yesterday’s heat. 


Once we started the last part of our hike today, we instantly recognized it as part of the AT that we hiked with Warren Doyle as part of the ATI back in October. In fact we are camping next to Double Spring Shelter (mile 452) which is that first shelter on the AT we ever saw.  Actually we’ve hiked the next 25-35 miles with the ATI.  It’s kinda fun to recognize parts of the trail.

April 9 we hiked 18 miles to get us into Damascus, VA.  We crossed the state line from TN to VA. 👏  Thankfully the terrain was full of sections that were flat.   We’ve been told that now we’ve left the 50% up and 50% down part of the trail. VA is 1/4 of the trail (almost 500 miles) abs should be 33% up, 33% down and 33% flat.  Fingers crossed that the trail gets a little faster🤞. 


In Damascus we stayed at the Dragoon Fly Inn which is a small B&B right in the heart of Damascus (mile 470). The owner also owns the local Diner.  It was great to shower, do laundry and eat some real food. We debated about getting ice cream or another shake as we left town but we decided against it.

It must mean we are getting faster and having more fun. Today a family passed us and the two little girls asked us questions about our thru-hike.

Rogers climbing 4,800 feet today. We are camping near Thomas Knob Shelter in Grayson Highlands State Park.  We also have hike the highest point in Virginia(Mt. Rogers).  Grayson is known for its wild ponies and we are looking forward to seeing them tomorrow.  Eric and I are both exhausted and our feet hurt but we had a great day of hiking. 


Today we hiked much of what we hiked back in October. It has been fun to know some of the trail. Eric’s memory is always right on but it always surprises me how crazy accurate his memory is😳.  He can remember the smallest details.  We were hiking and he literally is telling me what the trail looks like ahead AND he was right!  His brain is sometimes like a computer🤪.

April 12


Ponies, sore feet and crazy wind😳.  Day 46 can be summed up with those three words.  It was a delightful day full of sun but we experienced wind gust so strong I felt like it was going to push me over. Eric thinks the wind was between 20-30 mph (as a seasoned sailor, he knows his wind🤪).  The terrain was extremely rocky and often I didn’t look up at the trail for a stretch because I was looking at my feet. Then I would not know if I was really still on the trail.  Today was probably the second or third time since we started the trail that we often felt a little unsure of the trail. Normally the trail seems obvious and you can find a blaze easily, not today.  Thankfully once we stared looking we would find a blaze or we would check Guthooks to find the trail.


Grayson Highlands State Park is known for a herd of wild ponies that roam throughout the park. Last night we didn’t see or hear any ponies but other hikers reported them by their tents. Throughout the morning we must have seen two dozen ponies. We saw more ponies today than any other wildlife (minus birds) since we started the trail. Most were feeding and wanted to be left alone.  We respected them but I did snap a few pictures.  However, at lunch two ponies were very interested in our lunch.  The circled around us and tried to grab food off of the picnic table. As we were leaving the area, I broke a carrot in half and gave each pony some. Yes, I had a carrot in my pack 😳.  We are trying to add more fruits and veggies to our meals. 


You are never totally stable on rocks and your ankles twist or you roll your foot to the side. The rocks also test the tread on your shoes and the constant pounding leaves a full ache.  On one stretch of the trail the wind was so strong that it pushed me sideways and my foot twisted on the rock resulting in a rolled ankle.  Thankfully just rolled and not broken or sprained. Tonight I’m one happy girl that we stopped early to camp.  


We hiked only 10.5 miles today and are still exhausted. The crazy thing about miles on the trail is that they are not all equal. A mile can feel much longer and take more time for a variety of reasons:


Elevation changes Terrain- rocks, roots, fallen trees, etcWeather- rain, wind, fog, etcHow you feel-start of day or end of day 




Tonight was will dine on ramen noodles with freeze dried broccoli. A few days ago we met two engineers from Lynchburg, VA who are section hiking, Casey & Eric. We continue to cross paths on the trail with them and it’s been fun getting to know them. Tonight we sat around the picnic table and played the game Farkle with them. It was a fun game and Eric was the big winner.

 We hiked 18 miles today. The miles were easier and smoother today than yesterday.  We crossed a pasture, two roads, climbed a small mountain and walked the ridge, and took a 1.5 mile detour due to a bridge collapse which took us on a paved road😳. The detour was AT sanctioned because the river was too high to cross safely.  Truthfully the hot pavement on the detour was my least favorite part of the day but we didn’t want to risk fording a fast moving river. 


The excitement today is that I saw a four foot black rat snack cross the trail in front of me!
😳😬!  I am NOT a fan of snakes and I instantly freaked out. Thankfully Eric was a calming presence and reminded me that black snakes are not poisonous. We waited till it crossed the trail and then I made a wide berth around the snake. Picture to be uploaded! 


Tonight we are camping at a campsite along with a few other hikers, including the section hikers from Lynchburg and Galtica from 
Michigan who is hiking with his dog🐶. We actually have met more Michigan hikers in the last few days than we have since we started the trail.  It’s been fun to share common Michigan connections.  


We dined on my oatmeal recipe (oats, Chia seed, wheat germ, flax seeds, coconut, dried fruit, and brown sugar) and Eric finished with our last snickers bar. Thankfully we are heading into the town of Marion, VA to resupply tomorrow.

Last night we hung our bear bag(bag with all our food and anything smelly) and prepared for an evening of listening to a book on our kindle.  One of the guys at our campsite said that he’s been sleeping with his good bag since the start of the trail😳.  This statement stopped me in my tracks. We hang our food so that bears and other critters don’t bother us at night. I don’t want to have a possibly unpleasant interaction with an animal but especially a bear.  We went to our tent and when we woke in the morning, the other hikers were already gone. I’m not sure if they hung their bear bag or not but I’m glad we all slept safe. 


Today we did a Nero which means we only hiked a few miles.  We hike 6.5 miles to a road crossing for Marion, VA(mile 534). We needed to resupply and the weather forecast was calling for a thunderstorm tonight.  This combination means a night in a hotel for me! Marion is a cute little town with a free shuttle for hikers.  Tonight we are staying at the Econolodge and are happy to be showered, well feed, and wearing clean clothes. I did laundry while Eric got his hair cute and his beard trimmed. I’m happy to report that he still has a beard but he just had them trim it up.👏.   


For lunch we had Sonic with its famous cherry limeade and Eric had just ONE milkshake.  For dinner we sat went to a local Mexican restaurant.  It was really good but we both are and drank a little too much. 


Tonight we both are catching up on emails abc the news.  Tomorrow we will head back out on the trail❤️.

Tired feet today with 18.65 miles hiked.  It was a good day with some flat miles but many climbs that were straight uphill😳.  The climbs were lung and leg burners.  We stopped at a one room school house and a farmstead from the 1890s.  It was fun to sit and relax on the porch swing of the farmhouse for a few minutes. The schoolhouse was similar to the one at Besser Museum but not as well preserved as the one in Alpena. 


Marion was a great little town to stay in.  Eric got a hair cut and trimmed up his beard!  I’m thankful that he kept the beard but I’m disappointed he didn’t let the length grow in the beard. No hair cut for me yet and I decided I’m not shaving until we finish the trail🤪.  Eric is disappointed that I’m not shaving😂. 


 We had a great dinner at a Mexican restaurant and resupplied at the local Ingles store. We added a few new things to our rota: bagels, cream cheese, apples, and yogurt(we eat on the first day out).  The Marion Transit offers free shuttles & they picked us up at our hotel and drove us back to the trailhead. We started around 9:00 and finished hiking around 6pm.   We are camping at mile 552 with a few other hikers.  


It was a great day that ended with a campfire and then Eric and I listened to our Kindle. We are listening to pure entertainment, Matthew McConaughey read his book Greenlights.  It’s truthfully not a very good book but we have laughed aloud a handful of times as we listen.

We are liking the variety of miles in Virginia.  Instead of just hiking up and down mountains, we are crossing meadows, pastures and many roads. It was a cooler day (50s) but a great temp for hiking. We hiked 19.5 miles and are camping at small campsite at mile 571.
During our hike we encountered a few interesting things. First, there was a crew of 12 people who were with a trail club and a ATC(Appalachian Trail Conservancy) representative. The group was doing trail maintenance. It was fun to talk to the group about the project to reroute water off the trail.   Eric and I said after that we should help the trail groups in our local area when we return. 


The second thing is that we had to ford a small creek. We took off our shoes & socks and rolled  up our pants to ford to creek. We then began crossing the cold water.  Thankfully the ATC strung a line between two trees to help guide hikers across.  It was a fun experience and the water was refreshing on our feet.


We talked with some forest service employees and they shared that they believe a human started a fire  that burned 23 acres of land. Thankfully they were able to contain the fire but it was creepy to walk through the area that had been burned.  Thankfully no one was hurt but I feel terrible for all the trees that burnt. 


Finally, we had a little Trail Magic! It’s been awhile since we’ve received Trail Magic and it was fun to find a bag full of a variety of Pop Tarts at a trail crossing. Eric and I both took a strawberry Pop Tart. Everything on the trail tastes good because you are so hungry but this Pop Tart would have been better if we would have toasted it.  Regardless we were thankful for the snack. 


It was a good day and tomorrow we will hike some more!  We are excited to close in on 600 miles!

Eric woke me with the following statement, “I hear they are serving coffee and breakfast on the Lido deck.”  I immediately laughed and we began talking about our vacations on cruises. We would dress up, eat well, see exotic locals and have breakfast on the Lido desk. As a thru hiker my life is drastically different.  We are dirty, wear clothes over and over, rehydrate our food and spend the whole day hiking but it’s still an adventure and we are enjoying much of what the trail has to offer. We do, however, still dream of traveling the world and having breakfast on the Lido deck. 


We talked about our travels all morning which helped with the difficult hike. My legs felt like lead and we weren’t moving fast along the trail.  The morning was full of climbs and rocky  ridges.  We thought we could push to a campsite that was 24 miles away but I was too tired.  We decided to find a stealth camping spot(a camping spot on the side of the trail typically for 1-2 tents).  Eric and I stopped hiking at mile 586  which means we hiked 15.5 miles today. Just as we put up our tent rain drops started to fall😳.  I’m happily laying on my sleeping pad typing this entry instead of hiking. 


Tonight we will dine on dehydrated chicken curry given to us by fellow thru-hiker’s Mark & Linda Stender.  If you have not read their book, you can find it in Alpena or on Amazon.

Our day was a day of quests.  We were thirsty and seeking a place to camp.  First we realized that there was NO water on the trail for 7 miles this morning. Unfortunately we drank all but about 8 ounces of water that night before at dinner.😳. Typically there is water all through the trail but Virginia has been much drier.  There is always water at a shelter so we hiked 7 miles to the first shelter and then realized that the shelter and water are an extra 1.5 miles!  We had no choice but that hike the extra miles(these don’t count toward the 2,193 AT miles).  


Next around 4 we started to look for a place to camp.  Every good stealth spot we came upon was already taken by another hiker. We ended up hiking for another hour and a half to find the spot we are in tonight. The hike was up Brushy Mt which was full of rocky outcroppings which tested my patience as well as my sore feet.  Internally I was frustrated and tired as we hiked.  As we approached another rocky outcropping, I finally just gave up on the frustration and let the trail decide how long we needed to hike tonight. Thankfully we found a great campsite at mile 608. 


We ended up hiking a total of 22 miles today!  


Tomorrow we will hike 17 miles to Woods Hole Hostel so that we can take showers, wash clothes, resupply (we are almost out of food & Eric is dismayed that we have no chocolate), and I can attend a Zoom call on Monday night.   Most thru hikers get off trail to do the list above about every 5 days.  We find it a bit easier to carry only 5 days worth of food vs 7 days of food.  We’ve been hiking with some college kids who resupply food every chance they get but the don’t stay in town or shower.  When we were in Marion they were resupplying at Walmart and getting back on the trail.  Yesterday they finally decided to stay at a hostel so the could take a shower and wash their clothes.  They haven’t showered or done laundry in over two weeks😳.  Oh to be young again.

Bears and breakfast sandwiches!  


 I had a Zoom meeting tonight and we wanted some time to shower prior to the meeting.  About 10 minutes into our hike, I heard some sticks snap and I looked down the trail to discover that 3 bears were crossing in front of us 😳.  Thankfully the bears were easily 100 feet ahead of us and continued straight up the side of the mountain without really noting our presence on the trail. I definitely saw one little cub but I’m not sure if it was a second cub or another full sized bear.  This was our first bear encounter and I’m thankful it was safe.  Unfortunately, I did not snap a picture because it all happened so fast. 


We then hiked on and were able to take a road to a small grocery store, Trent’s Grocery Store.  Trent’s could fit into Alpena well. It’s a bait and tackle store that sells ammo and food.  We were able to grab a breakfast sandwich, tater tots, and juice.  It filled out belly for our long day.  


Much of the hike today was flat but the last half was a climb from 2200’ to almost 4000’ (Sugar Mountain).  Eric and I hiked hard and as a result we made it to the hostel in time for my meeting. Unfortunately, the WiFi connection would come and go during the meeting.  Once I was kicked off my meeting due to mountain WiFi, I was able to enjoy dinner.  The hostel made dinner for the group of hikers staying here and it was one of the best meals we’ve had on trail (pumpkin soup, salad with homemade dressings, bread with farm fresh butter and tofu Thai noodles).  Yum!

We left Wood’s Hole Hostel with full bellies and hearts.  Eric and I slept  well in the Loft and it felt great to have clean clothes and bodies.  Our hike this morning crossed the ridge line and provided amazing views of the valley below.   We hiked to Angel’s Rock and enjoyed a snack with a view.  We also hiked with a new hiker friend, 3 Jack a section hiker who completed a thru hike in 2016.  He stayed at the hostel and he’s a great story teller.  His stories helped pass the 12 miles in Pearisburg (mile 637). Oh, we did see one medium sized snake on the trail.😳 Thankfully we could easily go around the snake and continue on the trail. 
When we got to our first road, we had to hitch into town and Stuart was our trail angel. His wife is section hiking and he’s supporting her while she hikes.  He was happy to provide a shuttle for us and I was thankful that we didn’t have to hike up the steep hill into town.  Im sure some if you are wondering why we don’t just walk into town but once you are off trail and the miles don’t “count” I’d prefer not to hike the extra miles 🤷‍♀️.  


Today we head out to hike only 5 miles. The trail is closed for 15 miles due to a series of down power lines from a storm in February. The ATC has closed this 15 mike section of the trail and there is no detour.  The ATC is recommending that all hikers shuttle ahead 15 miles to avoid the danger. All the hikers we are with are following the guidelines and we are doing the same jump ahead.

Cold, wind, snow and a little sunshine sums up the weather for today’s hike.  The terrain was full of mountain climbs but also a few Michigan miles👏.  We also did quite a bit of rock scrambling today. We climbed Wind Rock (4,100’) and took a moment to capture the view from Kelly Knob. A large beige owl flew right by us early in our hike today.  I think a South bound hiker scared the owl and it flew right towards Eric and I (we are heading North).  It was pretty magical to see it in flight. Again, it happened so fast I wasn’t able to snap a picture.  Tonight we are tenting next to the Laurel Creek Shelter(mile 675).  Right now we are the only people at the shelter 😳.  We think everyone was scared by the cold and are staying in town.  Eric and I ate dinner quickly and ate snuggled in our sleeping bags.  Prayers that we stay warm tonight. 


Despite the cold or maybe because of the cold, we hiked 18.5 miles today.  We are also counting the 15 miles we skipped due to the closure in today’s total mileage (33.5 miles).

We slept cold but we slept well last night.  We were the only ones at the campsite last night.  Today the sun warmed everything up and it was great weather for hiking.  We left camp by 7:30 and hiked until almost 7:00pm😳. We hiked 21 miles!There was variety in our hike today. We hiked through a pasture, went over many footbridges, stopped at the Keffer Oak tree(largest oak tree on the AT, over 18’ around and 300 years old), climbed Sinking Creek Mt, passed over the Eastern Continental Divide, stopped to see the Audie Murphy Monument, and now we are stealth camping at mile 695 👏.  There were many amazing views of Virginia farmland and it is clear that the trees are budding.  Overall, it was a good day and my feet are sore!


Eric and I did our best to stay hydrated and eat more often when we hike.  We were able to weigh yourselves at the last hostel and I’m down 22 pounds and Eric is down 20!  I definitely needed to drop a few pounds but Eric really doesn’t have any pounds to loose. When we resupplied we added more food to our bags in hopes that we both will eat more!  The strange thing is that we both are often not really hungry while we hike.

Rocks, cows & rain! 


Wow! Today was a great hike but I’m happy we only hiked 15 miles today.  We’ve been kicking up the miles and it was nice to slow down a bit today.  We started out with a climb that turned into miles of rock scrambling. It’s very technical and slow when you hike in a rock scramble. I’ve tried to capture the difficulty with photos but pictures never do it justice.  We hiked to Dragon’s Tooth without our packs (it was a blue blaze) and it was amazing how much quicker we moved.  Pictures to come that show the magnitude of the size of the rocks. The descent down Dragon’s tooth was very technical with steep descents over large boulders.  Our packs made it difficult and sometimes I found it easier to slide down a boulder on my butt😳. 


We knew that rain was coming and we wanted to hike through the rocks.  Thankfully we were able to get through Dragon’s Tooth and have lunch prior to the rain.  We then hiked all afternoon on the rain and thankfully the terrain was much better. We even hiked through a pasture and some cows shared the trail with us👏.  The cows were the highlight of my day. 


I’d been watching the weather and I knew it was going to rain/storm all night.  I’d made arrangements for a shuttle and a hotel at the end of our hike today.  We approached what I thought was that side trail to the highway.  In the cold and wet rain,  I tried to look on my phone to make sure the trail was correct but I wasn’t 100% sure. I figured at least we’d be down on a highway and not in the woods.  The trail turned out to be the wrong trail😬.  Thankfully I had cell service and was able to call our shuttle driver.  Eric and I stood on the side of the road in the rain for 45 minutes as we waited for our shuttle😳.  At this point we are soaked, cold and tired. I was upset about having chosen the wrong side trail.  Our shuttle driver took us to our hotel and we were thankful for a shower, bed, and food that we delivered to our door.  


We slept well and are heading out to the trail again. It is cool but there are clear skies today.

McAffe’s Knob, Tinker Cliffs & Friends!


On Sunday we woke up early with the intent of hiking 20 miles to Dalesville so that we could catch up with some friends who were flying in from Michigan on Monday.  We summited McAffe’s with its iconic view but we really liked the underrated Tinker Cliffs.  The Cliffs were more extensive and provided some amazing views(I’ll posted pictures later). Once we passed both McAffe’s and Tinkers our goal was to get to Dalesville so that we could have dinner at the Three Pigs BBQ👏.  


We made it to the BBQ place and proceeded to gorge ourselves on pork, sweet potatoes, coleslaw, banana cream pudding & peanuts butter pie! Yep, two desserts.  Then we were off to bed at the local Holiday Inn Express. 


Monday we caught up with our good friends, Bryan and Lesslee❤️.  We spent Monday hiking some of the AT with our friends. They were able to see McAffe, shelters, water purification, and they got to meet some of our trail friends.  It was awesome for us to share some of our AT journey with them. 


We spent the night with them at a lovely house they rented.  We ate the best we have since we started the trail and enjoyed many laughs with our friends. 


On Tuesday we took a complete Zero Day from the AT and played tourist. We went to Thomas Jefferson’s Poplar Forest & went out for lunch. We also snuck in a walk around the city. Back at the house we enjoyed some wine, a fire and some awesome conversations with our friends. 


Today (Wednesday), Lesslee day hiked with us on the AT. We left Daleville and hike 8 miles with her. Bryan met us with lunch and our real packs.  After lunch our we parted ways with our friends & they jumped in the car to finish their vacation while Eric & I hiked another 10 miles.

We stopped hiking around 3pm because of the heat but also we had a huge climb that we didn’t want to attempt in the heat.  We are at Bryant Ridge Shelter(mile 762). The shelter is huge(double decker with a big porch).  It’s suppose to rain tonight, so right now we set up our tent on the porch. If others come we can move it but this allows us to stretch out in the comfort of our tent (no rainfly but protected from bugs).  Fingers crossed we can kept the tent on the front porch of the shelter.  Picture to come.

The past two days have been two great days of hiking and we were so tired that I didn’t write a post for May 1st. Sorry!   All I’ll say right now is that we hiked 13 miles up some pretty big mountains in 80 degrees😳


Today- May 2
Virginia continues to be beautiful and we are astounded by the views.  Last night we stayed at Punchbowl Shelter & enjoyed talking around the campfire with other hikers: Rookie, Compass & Jamaica.  We were the middle age group and all the kids stuck together in the shelter. 


Virginia is just beautiful right now with fresh green leaves and wildflowers.  I wish I could capture the smell💐


 The 12 mile hike went faster than we thought today. We scheduled a shuttle for 2pm to take us into Lexington to resupply.  We arrived at the trailhead at 12:30.  Eric and I both had no service so we set our packs under a tree to wait for our ride. Thankfully it was beautiful out  and we were happy to wait for our ride. We noticed a guy sitting in his truck and I went over to see if he had cell service. I thought I’d just send a message to our shuttle driver to let him know we were already at the trailhead. Barry, the guy in the truck, started talking to me. His wife has been hiking the AT in sections and he said that she’s always hungry and thirst when she comes out to a trailhead.  Before I knew what was happening Barry pulled out food.  I flagged Eric over to the truck.  He handed us a plate with pimento cheese sandwiches, chips, key lime pie and a coke. It was amazing. Like all Trail Magic, the whole experience was a blessing. Barry is a true gem.  He even shared his pimento cheese recipe: shredded sharp cheddar, Monterey Jack cheese, cream cheese, Mayo, garlic salt, pimento, cayenne pepper & a splash of Worcestershire sauce.  I’ll definitely be making this when I get home! 


Eric, Barry, & I talked about hiking  and the time passed quickly. Our shuttle driver arrived and we soon were at the hotel.  It was great to shower, do laundry, resupply, and consume as many calories as we could. Last night, I woke up hungry and I dreamed about my possible food choices once we went into Lexington.  Hiker hunger has definitely kicked in!

We were rested and clean from a night in a motel but as always we now are sweaty/dirty🤪. The realities of life on the trail. Thankfully our full bellies and rest bodies were able to hike 20 miles today.  Tonight we are sleeping at mile 830 @ The Priest Shelter on Priest Mt.  This shelter is actually famous on the trail for the entries in the trail log. People confess to The Priest and will write about all their trail sins😳.  Unfortunately due to Covid there is not a trail log to read tonight. I was looking forward to reading it and adding my own confessions!


Today was a day of climbing.  Two miles up 2,000’ out of the gate this morning. Eric’s watch shows that we climb 4,000’ today.  It was rainy and foggy all day today which made for a different hike. Thankfully the rain subsided in the afternoon but the fog lingered. It was a little freaky to only be able to see a few feet ahead of you on the trail.  At times the fog would lift and then you could see the entire trail(it was almost like magic when this happened).  


When you have hikers pass you going southbound you always take a few minutes to talk.  They have already hiked the trail we are heading to & we always ask questions about the trail. We also ask about weather updates if they have service on their phone. Finally, we will ask them who they have passed today. This is always fun because sometimes we will find out that someone we know if only a few miles ahead of us.  


We only passed a few people today. One was a single guy who was hiking in a long tunic with a rope wrapped around his middle. He looked like he walked out of Biblical times.  He was really an interesting character. He’s been on the trail two months(started at Harper’s Ferry, WV) and he’s only hiked 200 miles😳.  He’s not moving very fast at all...perhaps it’s because of the tunic.🤪


We had a family pass us going south bound & I thought I recognized the family. It turns out they are the Kentucky Krew.  They have been f doing Trail Magic up and down the trail.  They actually gave us our first Trail Magic back in Georgia. If you’ve been following my journal, it was called Hiker Trash (pancake, peanut butter, hot dog & maple syrup all rolled up together). I think I may have a picture posted.  It was fun to catch up with the Kentucky Krew today. 


Tonight at the shelter we ran into a few hikers we know which is always fun as well.  Yesterday when we got off trail we said goodbye to section hikers, Compass & Rookie.  However we are happy to have caught up with them at the shelter. 


It’s suppose to storm tonight so Eric and I are sleeping in the shelter.  Prayers that no snakes, bugs or mice come near us 🙏.

We woke up to sunny skies but as the day progressed the sky turned dark and thunderstorm loomed.  Eric and I hiked as fast as we could but the sky opened up with rain, hail, and wind.  We hiked as fast as we could but we knew we would be drenched before we reached the shelter.  The 13.5 mile hike seemed to take forever but once we hit the shelter we were able dry off (mile 843). 


At the shelter we found our friends Compass and Rookie and a lost dog🐶!  The dog was hiding under the shelter scared from the thunderstorm.  I enticed the dog to come out with some ritz crackers. We tried to call all the numbers tag but no one answered.  I was able to get the dog up in the shelter and it laid down . It was shaking and seemed scared.  We  spent the afternoon waiting out the rain with the lost dog. I was already planning to take time tomorrow to reunite the dog with its owner.  I tried all the numbers on the collar again and finally someone answered!  The owner was not worried about the dog(named Floyd). He said the dog loves the AT and will find its way home!  I told him I’d happily walk the dog down to the gap and wait till he came to pick up the dog but that owner replied, he’s only 4 miles from home and he knows the way!  


After the call I let the dog off the rope thinking it would go home now that the storm had passed. Instead the dog spent the entire night interacting with all the other hikers (Goose, Moss, the Cornell kids, Compass and Rookie).  In the morning I predict the dog will follow me along the trail but others think that dog will head home.  It’s crazy to me that a dog spends time away from home. It makes me wonder what it’s home life is like.

When we woke today Floyd, the dog, was gone!  As we hiked I saw doggie footprints in the muddy trail and I assumed the dog found it’s way home. Later in the morning, Chef (one of the Cornell kids) texted me about the dog.  Floyd ended up following a group of boys out of the shelter last night and he hiked with the kids.  When they pitched their tents the dog laid down by them and in the morning they continued their hike with the dog. At the road crossing the guys called the owner and he picked up Floyd🐶❤️.  


Our hike today was beautiful and sunny. It was a sharp contrast from yesterday.  The trail was smoother and easier than the day before which was a relief to my feet.  We hike 15.5 miles and are camping at the Paul Wolf Shelter (mile 859).  Tonight there are only two other people at the shelter, section hikers Rookie & Compass.  We’ve enjoyed getting to know them and are sad to see them get off the trail tomorrow in Waynesboro.  


We packed our food better this resupply than the last. We are hiking out with just enough food to get us through breakfast and some snacks tomorrow.  Less food means our packs weigh less & my legs are thankful for the lighter pack. 


Tomorrow we will hike into Shenandoah National Park and have a ride scheduled to pick us up at Beagle’s Gap.  We will spend the night in Waynesboro and resupply before we head back to the trail either Friday or Saturday. I’m getting my second Covid vaccine tomorrow afternoon so our departure will depend on how I’m feeling. Prayers that I’m feeling good.🙏

Waynesboro, VA is a great little town!  We got up before 6am and started our 10 mile hike into Waynesboro.  The first five miles were easy and we flew through them in 2 hours!  Once we hit Rockfish Gap and entered Shenandoah National Park, the miles slowed down because it was more technical and it took 3 hours to do five miles.  We ended our hike at Beagle Gap.  Our shuttle driver picked us up and we were showered/feed by 1pm👏.


Eric and I resupplied at Kroger and I got my second Covid vaccine.  We are taking a Zero day on Friday in case I don’t feel well and because it’s going to rain!  It will be nice to relax a little bit.  


We caught up with Bake Potato and Waymaker for dinner. Section hikers Compass and Rookie joined us for conversation as well. We sat outside and ate at a local place, The River Burger Bar. Hiker friendly and good food. The night ended at Kline’s Dairy Bar a local ice cream place, Eric had only ONE milkshake and I had a banana split. It’s been fun to eat as much as you want in trail towns. We are burning thousands of calories each day & cannot carry enough food in our packs.

A Zero Day means no hiking and today was a great Zero day. We slept in till 7:30 and had breakfast at the hotel. Then I was able to get my hair cut (2 inches cut off) at a local salon. The hairdresser Garrett reminded me of Larry B who cut my hair for years. He would look straight into the mirror and talk to himself, not you. He was fun to talk to👏 


Eric and I then went to the local outfitters. I ended up buying a new pair of hiking shoes. Mine are worn out and I’m hoping for a little more support on the rocks(better treads on the new shoes).  We also stopped at the post office and mailed home our stove which saves 1.5 pounds in Eric’s pack. Lunch was at a Chinese restaurant and dinner was a The River Burger Bar with a group of hikers (Baked Potato, Strider, 3 Jacks, Der Die Das, & Pino).  We sat outside and it was cold😬...but we felt like we were back on the trail. 


Tonight we are finishing laundry and packing up our packs.  We will head out on the trail tomorrow!  It’s likely that cell service will be sparse throughout Shenandoah. I’ll do my best to update my journal as service allows.

We both slept well and were ready to hike this morning.  My arm is sore but otherwise I feel good.  The miles were easier and the weather was cool which made for a nice day to hike.


About an hour into our hike, Baked Potato caught up with us and hiked with us today.  It was fun to catch up with him.  We crossed the Skyline Drive about 4 times today. The trail will cross Skyline 25 times throughout the park. The trail runs along the road and many times we could hear cars. It definitely takes away the feeling that you are walking in the woods when you head cars😬.  We did have some Trail Magic today, water and sodas were left on the trail.  It’s always fun to stumble upon a little magic. 


Tonight we are tenting at Blackrock Hut in the Shenandoah National Park (mile 885). The site is full of other thru hikers & a few section hikers. Der Die Das just arrived at camp.  Most of the other hikers here tonight are young kids who started almost a month after us!  It’s crazy how fast they hike.  


We are stoveless so tonight’s dinner was a baguette, sharp cheddar cheese, pepperoni, dried apricots, nuts and a beer we carried out. It was pretty good but I wish we would have had a nice bottle of some red wine🍷. Next time, I resupply I have to remember the wine.

It’s Mother’s Day and I called my mother when I had service but I had to leave a message.  Unfortunately, at camp tonight we are in a valley so I do not have service tonight. Tomorrow I’ll try calling my mom again as I hike.  Cell service can be hit or miss on the trail.  


Today we only hiked 13.5 miles and are staying at Pinefield Hut (mile 898).  We wanted to hike a little further today but the next spot to camp would make this a 21 mile day.  I had my Covid shot a few days ago. I still have a sore arm but I feel fine. The only strange thing is that I’m exhausted in the afternoon and want to take a nap😳.  The past three days I’ve napped as soon as we set up our tent.  I’m hoping that I’ll feel good all day tomorrow because we have to hike 21 miles tomorrow to the next shelter. We don’t think we can stealth camp in the Shenandoah National Park (we couldn’t stealth in the Smokies).


It was breezy and cool today which made for the perfect hiking temperature. We have seen far more section hikers and day hikers than we’ve seen since we started the trail. I’m certain this is due to better weather and that fact that we are in a National Park. The trails are really well maintained and are pretty well marked.   The highlight of the day besides the great hiking temperature was that we had lunch at at camp store.  This store was stocked with a variety of food items including hummus, hard boiled eggs, sandwiches, and junk food.  Eric and I ate well👏.  


Tonight Baked Potato and Der Die Das are at the shelter.  There are also a handful of section hikers and a few other thru hikers staying at the site but I’m the only female here tonight.

We hiked 20 miles today and are staying at Lewis Campground which is a campground open to the public. It feels really civilized because we are camping next to RVs and families.  The campground has flush toilets, running water & showers!  




At lunch we knew we’d be cutting it close to make the opening of the camp store, so we sent Baked Potato ahead with a list.  We arrived with about 45 minutes to spare before it closed but Baked Potato had already purchased food and drinks for us.  We ate like hikers eat, fast and furious.  We had 10 minutes to spare before that store closed.  We bought some more food(sweet rolls, Twinkie’s, Gatorade, fresh fruit, etc) and paid for showers tonight!  They even provide soap, shampoo and towels. It feels like we are in a resort🤪.


Shenandoah is beautiful and the trails are well maintained but today the blazes were a little off.  Eric and I had to double check a few trail crossings because it wasn’t clear which trail was the AT.  Thankfully we didn’t get lost but I could see how someone could get lost.  


Hopefully we sleep well surrounded by the noises of cars and RVs.  Truthfully in Shenandoah we constantly hear cars because the trail is not too far from the road.

So I forgot to mention a few things in yesterday’s post. First we hit 900 miles on the AT👏 and we are half way through Shenandoah.  Then on the trail yesterday I saw a huge black snake blocking the trail!  I stopped and screamed. Eric caught up to me and we paused for a minute but the snake did not move.  We inched closer thinking it would sense that it should move but it still did not move.  Then we both noticed that it seemed too straight to be a snake...it turned out to be a long black hose that went over the trail. We have no idea why this hose was on the trail but I was certainly glad it wasn’t a snake.  


We have experienced some amazing Trail Magic in that past two days.  Last night a couple heard we were thru-hikers and offered us some chicken stew. It looked great but unfortunately we had just eaten and didn’t have room for any more food on our bellies.  This morning a retired military guy gave us his extra coffee and as we drank the coffee we had fun checking out his small trailer -Inreach Flyer.  


Right before we were heading out for the day another guy came over to our campsite and said that he’d heard that we had taken Warren Doyle’s class (thru hikers talk—word trails up and down the trail).  We spent time talking to him about the class and his 2011 thru-hike.  He then offered to slack pack us for the day. He and his daughter are section hiking and his wife was driving an RV.  We agreed to give her our packs and we set off on our 8 mile hike to Big Meadows Campsite. 


We stopped at the Wayside for lunch and were disappointed to find the grill was closed. We dined on convenience food and cold beverages.  We then hiked to the campsite to pick up our packs.  Once we had our packs we decided to hike another 4 miles to Rock Spring Hut (mile 930).  


Tonight as we ate dinner a friendly doe grazed around the shelter.  She obviously is used to hikers staying at the shelter.  She stayed around for almost 30 minutes. I grabbed a video of her I’ll post when I get WiFi.  


Today the trail was full of section/day hikers and other thru hikers.  Shenandoah is the busiest we’ve seen the trail since the Smokies.  Many of the day hikers ask us questions about the trail and being a thru hiker. I can remember when Eric and I section hiked and we’d talk with thru hikers. We were in awe at their attempt to hike the trail. It’s strange to now be the thru hiker.  


This morning Baked Potato told us someone recognized him from Meandering Meaghan’s video (see link below).  He asked all kinds of questions and even wanted a picture of him.  Kinda fun for him to be recognized. 




In the morning we are going to get up early and hike 4 miles to Skyland Resort for breakfast.  Due to Covid they are only open from 7:30-9:30 for breakfast and then they shut down until 12 for lunch.  I’ve already looking up the menu and am excited for a big breakfast👏.

Last night we came up with a plan. If we started our hike early, we could eat breakfast at a restaurant today!  Eric, Baked Potato , Der Die Das and I were hiking by 6am and eating breakfast at Skyland Resort by 8:00am.  The motivation of a big breakfast meant our feet moved fast across 4.5 miles of the trail.   We ate everything on our plates and I ordered a side of pancakes that I polished off. We then grabbed sandwiches, chips & Gatorade for lunch before we left the restaurant .  Truthfully we’ve eaten our way thru Shenandoah.  For anyone thinking of hiking the AT, Shenandoah would be a great place to start.  The trails are easier, there are many hikers, and you can get food every 25 miles or so. Eric and I hiked here five years ago and this marks the last portion that we’ve previously hiked on the trail prior to our thru hike. It civilized hiking and you never feel alone on the trail. 


Last night I had trouble sleeping and I heard a variety of animal noises but especially an owl hooting.  Around midnight I heard the hooves of a deer pass close to our tent.  I’m betting it was the doe we saw eating by the shelter earlier. 


We ended up with a total of 16 miles of hiking today and are staying at Pass Mountain Shelter (mile 945). 


We have two more hiking days until we are out of Shenandoah and we will spend the night in Fort Royal on Friday. We will shower, do laundry and resupply before we head back to the trail Saturday morning. Typically I’m starving when we get off trail but I think this week we’ve eaten more than we typically do because of all the Waysides/restaurants in Shenandoah.

Truthfully, the Shenandoah’s have felt like a vacation. We’ve hiked less miles and the miles are easier terrain.  We’ve eaten more because of the restaurants and Waysides than we’ve eaten on any other stretch of the trail. It’s been my favorite part of our hike so far.  


Today we slept in and didn’t start hiking till almost 8:30.  The miles were easy and fast this morning and we had lunch at Elkwallow Wayside.  We made three trips into the Wayside for food.  First for lunch food, then we added ice cream and some snacks. Finally we went in for breakfast food and snacks.  The lady at the cashier just laughed. She says she sees this all the time with thru hikers.  


We finished our day with 14 miles and are tenting at Gravel Springs Hut (mile 958).  There are lots of other hikers at the shelter tonight. It’s fun to meet either hikers and hear their stories.  Most of the hikers here tonight are young and full of energy (hiking 25-30 miles a day). We will likely only see them once, unless they zero or get hurt.  One guy proudly told us that he’s eaten the same dinner every night on the trail (beans, rice, Fritos, etc).  It looked good but I don’t think I’d be able to eat the same thing every night.  


Somehow I walked by TWO snakes today 😬.  The first one I noticed once I went by and thankfully was a black snake that was far off the side of the trail. The other I did not see but the guys behind me did see it.  I’m thankful that I safely walked by these snakes but if does make me wonder how many more I might have walked by?!


Tomorrow we will exit Shenandoah and we will stay at a local hostel. Laundry, showers and resupply are in order.  I’m sure we will eat out but this is the first time I’m not dreaming about food prior to heading off trail. I’m sure it’s because I’ve been eating my way thru Shenandoah 😜.

It was a fast hiking day because it was downhill and we were motivated by showers & food.  We are waiting for our shuttle driver at US Route 522-Front Royal.  Today we hiked 14 miles and have officially left Shenandoah(mile 972). The sun was out and the green tunnel was beautiful for our hike.  


Right after we exited from the park, Baked Potato saw a bear about 20 feet from him. Thankfully it immediately ran away from the trail butI was able to catch a glimpse of the bear.  It looked like a medium sized cub.  We only saw the one bear but we left quickly in case mom was around.  This is my second bear sighting.  Last night around 1am I woke up hearing what I thought was a person.  They passed right by our tent but then seemed to walked through the woods.  Der Die Das heard the noise too bug he thinks it was a bear.  Thankfully whatever it was left our campsite quickly and without any problems. 


Tonight we are at Stumble Inn, a hostel run by former thru hikers, Stumble & Texas.  This is the nicest place we’ve stayed at on the trail. It’s a beautiful log cabin house and the hostel is in the basement.  We were shuttled into Front Royal for food and resupply. Eric had Mexican food and I split a pizza with Baked Potato.  Each of us finished off dinner with a pint of Ben and Jerry’s ice cream.  We weighed ourselves tonight and we are both down another 5 pounds.  It’s almost impossible to consume enough calories on the trail.  We are burning 4,000-6,000 calories a day depending on the miles/terrain.  


Tomorrow we are slack packing a 20 mile section of the trail and we will stay another night at this awesome hostel.  We will start our hike at mile 999 and head south toward Front Royal. We will have to wait till Sunday to officially hit the 1,000 mile mark👏.

Today was one of my favorite days on trail.  It was sunny and the trees were standing majestically tall.  The 20 miles of slack packing  were easier with only 10 pounds on our back. Stumble Inn cooked up and amazing breakfast of biscuits & gravy, eggs, and hash browns.  Hiking in Northern Virginia is so beautiful and we definitely will be visiting again soon. 


We hiked quickly and stumbled upon Trail Magic from a former thru hiker, Summer Camp.  She had an amazing spread of watermelon, veggies, hummus, pretzels, beer and Oreos.  We spent an hour talking to Summer Camp and her friend.  It was fun to hear about her through hike and we shared many similarities such as loving Laurel Falls, VA. She also had a great little AT tattoo on her foot.  I don’t have any tattoos but I’m tempted to get a small AT tattoo once I finish the trail.  We will see.  


We ran into a French journalist who is writing a story on the Appalachian Trail.  She interviewed Eric and I about our trail experience.  She gave me a card and once I email her she will send us a link to the story. I’ll share it here once it’s published. The story won’t be out till this summer.  It was pretty cool talking to her about the trail and it will be fun to see the article when it comes out.  


Stumble Inn is definitely one of the best hostels on the trail.  Texas and Stumbles have gone out of their way to make us feel at home.  Tonight they ordered BBQ for dinner and they made us a peach cobbler that was amazing.  They also talked to us about how a portion of the money they bring in from the hostel will go to helping kids get active in nature(hiking, kayaking, etc).  It sounds like an amazing opportunity for kids to get out in nature and experience things they might not be able to in their normal lives. What a great way to give back.  If you are ever thru hiking in Front Royal, you should definitely stay at Stumble Inn. 


Our hike today was South bound.  We started at Ashby Gap (mile 992) and ended back at mile 972.  Tomorrow we will start at Ashby Gap and will head North.  We will hit the big 1,000 miles tomorrow👏 and will be getting closer to the half way point of the trail.  It amazing how we’ve gotten to this point on the trail.  It seems like it’s taken forever but it also seems to have happened so fast.  I’m still amazed that every day I wake up ready to hike and that I’ve not grown tired of the trail. My feet may be tired but I’m still ready to hike.  One of the things I love is that every day is different and that we’ve met some really amazing people on the trail.

Virginia’s motto is that Virginia is for lovers.  Tonight we crossed out of Virginia and into West Virginia.  We’ve loved our time in Virginia with the varied terrain and easier miles.  We are excited that we completed 1,000 miles today and that tomorrow we will cross into Harpers Ferry.  It’s surreal to think we’ve hiked 1,000 miles through 4 states and we will spend only 17 miles in West Virginia.  


Today we hiked 17 miles and are camping at mile 1009.  We “rode” the 13 mile roller coaster today.  The roller coaster is a series of smaller hills that resemble a roller coaster but trust me it was not much fun. We climbed almost 5,400’ and the terrain was rocky.  As we started the roller coaster we joked about fastening your seat belt and we threw our hands up in the air with the first down hill but the difficulty of the ride/hike made us soon get down to the business of hiking a seriously difficult part of the trail. 


We stopped at the Bear’s Ben Hostel which is right off the trail.  The hostel serves frozen pizza and Ben & Jerry’s ice cream.  It was a fun break from that roller coaster and we couldn’t resist the opportunity to eat on the trail.  


Tonight we crossed into West Virginia right before we made camp.  We were excited to move into a new state and we are looking forward to crossing states off quicker during the second half of the trail.

Harper’s Ferry is a historic town and I wish I had time to play the tourist. Eric and I are making a list of places to return to and Harper’s Ferry is definitely on the list. Instead of touring the town, we showered, ordered pizza, did laundry and I participated in my Zoom board meeting.  Eric napped and caught up of emails while I Zoomed.  Now I write my journal but I’m excited to have the tv on in the background.  I turned on The Voice. I watched the beginning of the season but I missed the rest of the season since I’ve been on trail.  It looks like tonight is the finale.  It will be fun to see if I recognize any of the singers😳


We will head out in the morning and will be heading North.  In the next few days we will hit the “official” half way point on the trail and we will participate in the famous half-gallon challenge (eating a half gallon of ice cream!). Photos and videos will document the occasion😳.  Anyone want to place bets? I think Eric will eat all his ice cream and that he’ll help finish mine🤪.

We had a slow start this morning. We slept in a little than normal and after breakfast we headed out. The trail winds through some forest but then it heads into Harpers Ferry.  It is always fun when the trail goes directly through a town.  We stopped at the Appalachian Trail Conservancy to take a picture. We knew that the ATC was closed due to Covid but a volunteer came out to talk with us.   The volunteer, Samurai Blue, hike the AT a few years back and it was fun talking to him about his hike.  He gave us some AT stickers, stamped my AT passport book and gave us some 2020 Hiker Tags (ATC was not planning on handing out tags this year since the trail was technically not open...but they decided to begin recognizing 2021 thru hikers starting May 26.  The next chance we will have to pick up tags will be when we hit Maine 😳.  Thankfully we are not hiking for tags). 


We then stopped at the coffee shop for drinks & a snack.  Feeling like tourist while we strolled through the historic streets.  We definitely plan on returning to Harper’s Ferry in the future so we can indulge in all the historic sites. Eric bought new shoes because his shoes were completely worn out (Ultra Lone Peak 5).  This is his third pair of shoes on the trail.  We debated about staying in town longer (we were getting pulled into a city vortex- this happens to hikers all the time- you don’t want to leave the comforts of the town).  Thankfully we decided to hike on but we needed to hike back to catch a part of the trail we missed.  We dropped our packs to head up a steep street and a woman turned to us and said, “Are you in the show Amazing Race?”  As a super fan on the tv show, I stopped to talk to her and explained what we were doing(thru hiking but we took off our packs to hike a steep section of the trail we missed. I also told her that I’ve applied to the show five times & that hiking the AT sometimes feels like we are on the Amazing Race).  We went up the steep hill and walked to the place we stopped before heading right back down to grab our packs. We are doing our best to ensure that we walk all the miles and see all the blazes.  The hike out of Harpers Ferry takes you on a footbridge over the Potomac River and while we were on the bridge we crossed into Maryland(only 41 miles of the AT in Maryland. The trail started flat and we hiked 3 miles on the C&O towpath before finally climbing the Weaverton Cliffs. Tonight we are staying Crampton Gap Shelter(mile 1036) after only hiking 12 mile today due to the fact that we got a late start.  Truthfully it felt nice take it easy today.

One of things I don’t like to do is to get out of the tent in the middle of the night. It’s tough to climb out of the tent but there is also the fear of what could be lurking around the campsite.  I woke up with a very full bladder and tried to willed myself back to sleep.  No luck.  I turned on my flashlight and headed out to relive my bladder.  Thankfully there were no surprises and I safely made it back into my tent. 


Today was a beautiful day to hike in Maryland and I’m trying to soak up the state since we will go through it tomorrow.  It was a warm one today!  Temps were in the mid 80s and as a result we are both sweaty & smelly tonight!  The terrain is easier but we took our time to enjoy the historic sites in Maryland: Washington Monument and lists of Civil War signs. Eric read as many signs as he could and he found a panel on Confederate soldiers. The sign explained their packs, clothing, and diet. One line made him laugh aloud because it describes thru-hikers perfectly. “Confederate  soldiers were a a smelly and hungry lot.” I can honestly say I am beyond smelly and hungry🤪


The excitement of the day is that we orders food from a local restaurant (Vesta) that delivers to a road crossing.  There is a restaurant, Mountain Inn at the road crossing but it’s only open on the weekends and today is Wednesday.  Thankfully Guthooks had comments about Vesta delivering. Our food  came and we quickly devoured it.  We then started to pack up our garbage.  There was no place to throw out the garbage so we would have to carry it with us.   Then a car pulled into the lot. A fellow thru-hiker, Aqua Dog was in the car with his girlfriend and they were headed back to get her car.  We chatted with him and then he offered to take our garbage for us.  The trail provides!  


 We also hiked by the  Greenbrier State Park and tonight we are camping at Annapolis Rocks (mile 1050).  We watched the sunset tonight with our hiking friends, Baked Potato and Reset (we’ve been hiking with Reset for about 10 days. We started one day apart in Georgia but just met him in Shenandoah).  


Tonight I’m sweaty and my feet are tired.  It was a good 16 mile hike today. I’m excited to cross into Pennsylvania tomorrow!

It’s another sunny and warm day for hiking. We     hiked 16 miles and are sleeping at the Pennsylvania/Maryland state line.  We are stealth camping (mile 1066).  The terrain was rocky with mix of smooth miles but it was definitely more challenging than the previous days.  We stopped at High Rock Ledges which was littered and full of graffiti which was a huge contrast to Pen-Mar Park.  Pen-Mar Park is a hikers dream: bathrooms, water, garbage cans, a little museum, great overlook, and local pizza places deliver!  Needless to say, we ordered dinner😳.  We may have lost weight in the first 1,000 miles but I may not loose weight in the second half of the hike 🤪.  


As a side note, Pen-Mar was the site of a dining hall, dance hall and a train station. The little museum does a good job of capturing the parks history.  It’s definitely worth a stop if you are in the area. 


Maryland is not as remote as our previous states. We continually hear road noise while we hike. We like the availability of road crossings but miss the quietness of many other parts of the trail.  I’m excited to see what Pennsylvania brings.  I’m hoping for farmland and cows but I’m thinking it will be rocks and rattlesnake😬.  Oh, I did see a baby black snake on the trail today. It slithered away quickly and hid its head in some leaves.  It was kind of cute and I could tell it was more scared on me than I was of it.  This is my kind of snake.

We crossed into Pennsylvania early this morning.  Last night while we stealth camped I was woken up by thru hikers who were celebrating their arrival at the Mason Dixon line.  One hiker, around 3am, was playing music while he hiked. His song was Leroy Brown🤪.  It obviously woke me up but I silently celebrated his hike and knew he was trying to keep himself going. I’m  sure he was attempting the four state challenge(VA, WV-17 miles, MA-40 miles, Pa). You leave early from VA and have 24 hours to make it into PA.  It’s a grueling day and needless to say we didn’t attempt this crazy challenge. Hiking in a daily basis is tough enough for me. 


We’ve been hiking with Baked Potato and Reset for the past two weeks. They are both great guys. I’m not sure if I mentioned it or not but Der Die Das got off trail in Harpers Ferry. He’s taking two weeks off to change his gear and to gain some weight.  We miss hiking with him and look forward to him catching us soon.  


It was another hot day but thankfully the breeze and the green tunnel kept me cool enough to hike.  We hiked over some technical rocks and the forest looked very similar to Michigan(pines, oaks, & ferns). The 18 miles took us to Calendonia State Park.  The park has showers and flush toilets.  I made friends with a woman who lent me shampoo and body wash so that we could take a shower.  We were hoping to have dinner at a local burger place that is a half mile from the campground but unfortunately it was closed when we arrived.  All of us were disappointed and we sat down in  front of the closed restaurant trying to decide what to do.  A trail angel showed up in a red van.  John, offered to take us to a local gas station for cold drinks. We jumped at the offer.


It was a great night complete with a shower!

Tonight we sleep at the Ironmasters Mansion Hostel (mile 1105) which is in Pine Grove Furnace State Park. The Hostel is in a historic building that was build of bricks made right in the park.  It was also a stopping point on the Underground Railroad which makes me wonder if slaves walked some of the trails we’ve been hiking.  


Once we started our hike today, the terrain was flatter with the exception of a few big climbs.  We thought we’d hike 12-15 miles today but the miles kept ticking away.  We ended up hiking 20 miles today which allowed us to cross the official half way point of the trail AND the 1,100 mile marker👏.  Big day!  


Eric and I had a scare on the trail.  The trail was wide, so we were hiking side by side talking.  Baked Potato came up behind us to show us a picture he had taken.  All of a sudden we heard a rattle noise😳.  On the trail right in front of us was a rattlesnake!  It was only a foot or two in front of us!  Thankfully it was moving quickly across the trail and disappeared into the brush.  I was surprised by how we didn’t see the snake before we heard the snake. I’m thankfully it rattled otherwise we would have stepped right on it!  


It was a great day to be on the trail.  We met some MIT students who sail collegiately and a family with FIVE kids who were day hiking part of the AT this weekend.  The trail was full of day hikers and we did see our friends Drifter and the Hun and Wing Nut.  I appears that the bubble of thru hikers is still behind us on the trail which makes us happy but I’m sure it will eventually catch us.  We worried that the hostel might be full tonight but there are only two other thru hikers. 


In the morning we will have ice cream for breakfast as we do the “Half Gallon Challenge” as a sign that we’ve completed half of the trail.  I didn’t eat dinner tonight except for some Thin Mint Girl Scout cookies from my care package.  I want to make sure I have enough room in my belly for ice cream🍦.

Anniversary ice cream. Today is our 12th wedding anniversary❤️. I never would have predicted I’d be 1,100 miles into an AT thru hike on my 12th anniversary but I’m certain we won’t ever forget what we did this year.  The half-gallon challenge marks the half way point of the AT. Here’s how the challenge works: you pay for your ice cream(about $10), time yourself and then eat.  If you finish in under an hour you receive a small wooden spoon and you have bragging rights.  The quickest time on record is 1 minute 45 seconds.  The hiker let the ice cream melt and then drank it. Many don’t like his title because he didn’t eat the ice cream, so they also display another winner with a time of 5 minutes and 39 seconds.  


For the challenge, I chose orange sherbet and a small tub of moose tracks.  Eric chose raspberry and moose tracks. I did my best but I couldn’t finish my ice cream.  Eric finished his in about 32 minutes and the in typical Eric fashion he tried to finish mine😬.  Thankfully he gave up on finishing my ice cream. Reset finished his challenge first and then Baked Potato.  All three boys are suffering right now and I’m guessing we won’t be doing a ton of hiking today.  Right now it’s 11:30 and we haven’t hiked yet today.  We visited a AT Museum and are now resting on the porch of the hostel. 


We have three possible camping locations for today.  Once we start hiking we will have a better idea on what our bodies can handle with ice cream bellies and 87 degree heat.  I’m hoping for a nice leisurely 8 mile hike today.  


Later in the day...


 We stopped at the James Frey shelter for the night (mile 1112) only hiked 8 miles today. I’m thankful for the easier day today!

No pain, no rain, no Maine. - AT saying 


Many have been asking about our aches and pains on the trail. My knees have held up well thanks to cortisone shots, knee braces and my personal Orthopedic surgeon.  However, my feet are a completely other story.  By the end of a hiking day I feel like my feet have been pulverized and sometimes my big toe is numb.  Eric has faired better and only occasionally complains about his toe hurting(he broke it back around mile 300).  Honestly, everything hurts at different times but thankfully we both wake up ready to hike again.  


It was cooler and it rained today. It actually felt nice to be sprinkled on by some rain and everything dried out nicely by the end of the hike.  We hiked 20 miles over many wheat fields, boulders, and small mountains.  Tonight we are Carlisle, PA and are sleeping at mile 1131 ( Super 8). We were not planning on staying at a hotel but there is a 14 mile stretch of the AT in Pennsylvania that runs between farms and houses so there is no camping allowed on this stretch of the AT.  My feet were done by 20 miles and I didn’t think I could make the additional 6 mile stretch, so we stopped for the night. Tomorrow we will get back on the trail and finish the no camping stretch. So far PA has been pretty tame but I know the rocks are coming😳😬.

It was the perfect day fit hiking: 70s and overcast.  The terrain was varied (farm fields, rock scrambling, climbing 1600’ straight up a mountain, and small rolling hills). We hiked fast so that we could make the Duncanon post office before it closed.  We made it right before it closed (4:30) and we mailed home some extra clothes (3 pounds between Eric & I).  We’ve been trying to lighten our packs but like all things, it takes time.  Our base weight is around 15 pounds but then you add in food and water and that adds another 10-15 pounds. In Pennsylvania the water is scarce so we’ve been carrying extra water.  


Pennsylvania is known for its rocks and rattle snakes. We’ve gotten a taste of the rocks but thankful we’ve not seen any rattle snakes yet 😬.  Tomorrow is suppose to be 90’...it makes me nervous that I might see some snakes. Prayers that we don’t.🙏

Muggy, Buggy & Stormy!




Last night we stayed at a local hostel and then enjoyed a nice breakfast at Goodies in Duncanon.  The trail mess as meanders two miles through town, over a bridge, and then over a railroad track. At the railroad track we either had to go under a train that was stopped on the tracks or around the train. We choose to around the train but it was a little unnerving as we crossed three railroad tracks. We scrambled as fast as we could and made it safely to the trail.  We started to hike up the mountain and in less than 10 minutes we heard a train roar through the tracks we had just crossed 😳


Our hike was a rocky scramble up a mountain and then over a rocky ridge line. Bugs swarmed around us as we hiked.  The rocks were slick because of the muggy weather and both Eric & I slipped on the rocks. Thankfully nothing major happened & we both are only a little bruised.  


We checked the weather and knew it was going to storm.  We hiked quickly but could hear the rumble of thunder in the West.  The wind began to pick up and the temperature dropped. The sky turned a gray green color and we no longer heard any birds. The storm was almost on us. We hiked faster hoping to beat the storm.  We were ok with getting wet but not getting caught in a thunderstorm. Two thru hikers were struck by lighting in Smokies after the last severe thunder storm. We made it to Peter Mt Shelter (mile 1160) just as the storm unleashed itself.  It is good to be inside a dry shelter instead of stuck in the storm. 


We set up our tent in the shelter -this helps me feel protected from mice and bugs.  And then set off to get water.  Water was straight downhill and I counted over 400 steps.  Thankfully the water was ice cold and flowing right from a mountain stream. After getting water, there was a couple at the shelter who hiked in Trail Magic. They brought fresh pineapple, salad fixings, homemade brownies, and beer!  It was a pretty amazing spread.  We’ve never experienced Trail Magic at a shelter.  Tonight the shelter is full👏.  The girls (Moss Rock, Giggles & Goose), the Cornell kids, and a Michigan couple we met last night.  We even got a game of euchre in tonight because we had 6 Midwesterners who all knew how to play.  I hate to admit that Eric and I lost our game. We are a little out of practice and miss your euchre playing friends🥰

It was a beautiful day for hiking. The sun was shining but the weather was cool, perfect for hiking.  I keep expecting the terrain to be difficult and rocky but so far it’s terrain typical for the AT.  Pennsylvania is known to hikers as Rocksylvania but so far the rocks have not overpowered the trail. I’m guessing since I just wrote about rocks that tomorrow the rocks will start😳.  


We started hiking by 7am so we were able to hike 18 miles by 3pm.  Since we got in early, I  was able to take a nap👏.   Tonight we are camping next to a creek at mile 1178. The Cornell kids, the girls, the Little Hotties and other hikers are all staying at the campsite. It’s crazy how everyone is bunched up. 


Tomorrow we have to cross part of the trail that is flooded by Beaver activity.  We have the option to take a mile detour or we can brave walking through a flooded trail for a quarter of a mile. It’s supposed to rain all day tomorrow so we will be wet either way.

We woke up early and were hiking by 6:30. The terrain was easier but we are starting to see more rocks.  The rocks vary in size from small ankle turning rocks to boulders that we have to climb over.   I’m dreading the end of Pennsylvania because it sounds like it’s all rocks & snakes. I’m praying for cold temps to keep the snakes away 🤪. 


We have exactly 100 miles left in Pennsylvania so we should be in NJ next Friday.  We’ve been hearing that we will see more bears in NJ than anywhere else on the trail. We’ve seen two sets of bears so far on the trail. 


Eric continues to call our life on the AT, summer camp. He’s right about the comparison. We all have trail names/nicknames, we do crazy things you’d never do in the “real” world, we can eat whatever we want because we are burning so many calories, and your only real responsibility is to hike the trail.  You also make friends quickly like you would as a kid. It’s easy to strike up a conversation about hiking gear or trail gossip with a fellow hiker as you are hiking. Like summer camp, most nights end with a camp fire with the occasional musical instrument.  Even on the tough days, hiking the trail is still like summer camp. 


Today we hiked 18 miles quickly because we knew that rain was in the forecasted for the afternoon.  We had arranged to be picked up and tonight we are sleeping at the Quality Inn in Pine Grove, PA(mile 1195).  We will be shuttled back to the trail in the morning for a day of hiking in the rain!

The trail is a funny place.  You can hike all day and not see another person or you can feel Ike you are on a sidewalk because the trail is so busy. Today was busy likely because of the holiday weekend.  We got a late start today because I was tired this morning.  About an hour into our hike we came upon a group of women and I thought one of them looked familiar.  It turns out one of the hikers attended Warren Doyle’s ATI in October with Eric & I.  LuAnn (Featherweight) started a thru hike in April but had to get off for a variety of reasons. She is doing section hikes instead of a thru hike. It was great to hike with her and catch up on her life.  Ironically if we had not slept in we would have missed her on the trail.  I’m glad I slept in👏. 


The terrain is definitely getting more rocky but we’ve been told the REAL rocks start after Port Clinton.😬.  My feet already throb at the end of a long hiking day but I’m certain they will feel terrible after hiking on rocks all day. In the midst of these mile long rock scrambles, I’ll have to remember Warren’s famous saying, “You cannot change the trail, you can only change yourself.”  


It rained all day yesterday and we decided to get off at a small hostel, Rock & Sole.  We only hiked 10 miles today but with the rocks, time spend with LuAnn, and the late start we decided to get off trail so we could sleep in a warm & dry bed.  I’m thankful for the hostel because it rained all night. We were the only ones at the hostel so it felt like a small resort.  The owners were great and they drove us to get takeout at a local Italian restaurant (Eric got seafood lasagna & I got eggplant Parmesan).  We even got a local Yeungling beer(Pennsylvania brewed).  It was a good night. 


Today we will hike 15 miles in the cold & rain to Hamburg, PA.  We are catching up with our friend Baked Potato & are picking up a package that was mailed to us.  We will stay in a motel tonight (yep, 3 nights in a real bed but trust me we needed this!).  On Monday we start the final 80 miles of Pennsylvania and will be in the woods without a break for a number of days. I’ll do my best to post as I have service.

Approximately 3,000 people attempt a thru hike each year.  A thru hike means that you hike continuously without long interruptions and complete the AT within one calendar year.  The last day to summit Katahdin is October 15.  We started February 26 and are hoping to summit Katahdin on my 50th birthday in early August.  What is interesting is the 3,000 who start the trail all do not finish the trail. In fact, 25% get off trail by Neel’s Gap, GA.  Then another 25% get off trail before they hit Harper’s Ferry. We know many hikers who had to get off due to injury but we also know a few who were healthy enough to get back on the trail 👏.  We consider ourselves lucky enough to still be on trail and we pray that we are in the lucky 25% who actually complete their thru hike in one year.  


It was a cold and rainy day again!  For me this meant I didn’t have to pay as much attention to looking for snakes but it meant that I needed to watch the slippery rocks. We hiked 
15 miles today without taking a break. It was raining just enough to keep the temps cool.  If we stopped hiking our bodies got cold, so we kept hiking.  By the time we arrived at the road crossing in Hamburg, we were hungry and tired. The trail goes under a highway bridge and we climbed up the bridge with a plan to walk the 2 miles to the hotel.  A car immediately pulled over and offers us a ride. Janet has friends who did a thru hike and now she offers rides/help to other hikers.  We jumped in the car and she drove us to our hotel.  


Once we checked in, we ate then shopped at Walmart.  We ran into many other hikers and it’s always fun to catch up with them about their hike. A few were only stopping to resupply and then they’d head back to the trail.  We caught up with Baked Potato and he had an amazing afternoon full of Trail Magic. First, he got a ride, then a couple asked him if he needed anything (he was sitting outside Walmart condensing his resupply into his pack).  He told them he’d like a ride to Cabelas.  The couple gave him a ride then offered to pay for his hotel room😳 so he could get out of the rain. They also gave him a bag with food in it(grapes, cheese & trail mix).  Finally the couple took Potato’s old sleeping pad and they promised him they’d mail it to his house. This nice couple’s son hike the trail a few years back and they look to repay the kindness their son received while on trail.  It really amazing how generous and kind people have been.  


Eric and I are heading back to the trail this morning. We will start to walk the 1.5 miles back to the trail but I’m anticipating a stranger will offer us a ride and we will gladly accept.  I’d never do this four months ago but it’s crazy how my perception of strangers has changed while on trail.

We ended up walking the 1.5 miles to the trailhead.  We didn’t really try to hitch a ride so no one stopped to pick us up.  Oh well, it was a flat and easy hike.  


Once on trail we started with a steep climb but once we were on the ridge out hike was stable except for the rock scrambling.  We climbed up Pulpit Rock and the Pinnacle for the views but we were greeted with a timber rattlesnake. Thankfully it was safely curled by sunny itself next to a rock but Potato was brave enough to snap a picture!   It was a beautiful sunny day with temps in the low 70s. A perfect day for hiking.

Today was a wildly wonderful day on the trail. I woke up at 3am by a thru hiker who was night hiking.  I eventually fell back asleep but then woke up at 6am.  We decided to start hiking early and as the climbs started, I thought to myself, I cannot do this today😬.  But somehow the miles kept ticking by and we were at 9 miles before lunch.  The terrain was mostly rocks but there was occasional stretches of flat trail. 


Baked Potato and AZ (a former thru hiker & now section hiker) caught up to us at lunch.  We tackled the crazy rocks of Pennsylvania together.  Eric overcame his fears and we hiked the famous Knife’s Edge.  It was a crazy rock scramble that was pretty scary at times. It wax one of the most technical stretches of trail we’ve ever hiked.  I’ll posted pictures. 


After scrambling over Knife’s Edge, we stumbled upon Trail Magic. First we noticed a cache of water next to the trail. Pennsylvania is very dry and Trail Angels will leave water for hikers. Then as we approached the road, Baked Potato noticed smoke from a grill. He literally started running toward the grill.  Two former thru hikers from 2019 were grilling burgers & hot dogs.  We were in heaven!  Beer, chips, cookies & watermelon all appeared like a smorgasbord in front of us.  We all had a burger and a hot dog but Eric went back for a second hot dog.  We sat around eating and drinking for an hour or so but then we remembered that we had to hike to camp tonight.   The final mile into camp tonight was a rock scramble and it made me regret the second beer I had 😳.  Thankfully we all made it into camp safely tonight after a rock scramble of a day.  Oh, no snake sightings today👏17 miles (camping at mile 1252) Baked Oven Knob

Pennsylvania has become Rocksylvania.  Today we tackled tiny rocks, big rocks, sharp rocks, car sized rocks & everything in between.  


Eric’s war cry was Veni Vidi Vici!  He’s not a fan of heights and was not looking forward to the climb out of Lehigh Gap but he embraced it like a badass hiker.  Truthfully it was so overwhelming that we just had to hike/climb & not think.  The climb out of Lehigh Gap was 1,000 ft in 1.5 miles.  The climb was entirely on rocks & at times it went straight up.  Honestly it was one of the craziest things I’ve done and I’m proud to be writing about the climb we did today.  Pictures will not do the climb justice but trust me, it was pretty technical. I am glad that we went up instead of down the rock face. 


Tonight we are relaxing at the Filbert B&B.  Our bellies are full and our bodies are clean.  We planned a night in a real bed as a reward for such a tough hike.  I also carried out a beer to celebrate the climb we did today but the beer sprang a leak.  At lunch I thought I smelled beer but thought I was crazy.  Then as we began hiking I felt drips coming from my pack.  I asked Eric to investigate what was dripping all over me & he pulled out the beer.  We ended up drinking what was left prior to our hike up Lehigh Gap.   It gave us a little liquid courage.  


Today hiked 14 miles and are sleeping at mile 1265(Palmerton).  We only have 30 miles left in  Pennsylvania👏and I’m excited to cross into New Jersey. 


As a side note, I forgot to mention that the trail from Lehigh Gap north is a deforested ridge due to zinc smelting from 1898-1980. Hikers are advised not to camp or drink water from the ridge due time high metallic content.  To be safe we decided not to camp or drink water close to this site & instead are staying at a B&B.

Blessings - we packed out extra water from the Trail Magic yesterday.  We ran into a guy from Oklahoma whose water was empty.  We gave him our extra water & he was extremely thankful. I’m glad we could help him.


Merit Badge - Grasshopper for tackling the climb today. I should add that he was so nervous that he was sweating so much that he to change his shirt out once we got to the top of the climb.

June 3- We knew the rain was coming but we hiked as fast as we could.  The green tunnel kept us pretty dry all day until the last mile or so of our hike.  The rocks of Pennsylvania showed themselves today but it was a much easier hike than the previous days or perhaps we are getting better at hiking on rocks. 


Truthfully it was a great day to hike and the miles ticked away easily and we reach 1280 (15 miles) by 3pm.  Once we hit Wind Gap, PA we thought about continuing on but we decided to call it a day.  Eric found a local barber and was able to get his haircut & beard trimmed.  I grabbed some food & drink while he was sitting in the barber’s chair.  We called it a night early and slept well. 


June 4- I didn’t check the forecast today but I thought it might rain today. The first 9 miles of our hike were typical of Pennsylvania full of rocks of various sizes. We enjoyed the quietness of our hike; no other hikers were on the trail until mile 6.  We stopped for lunch at Leroy Smith Shelter and caught up with some fellow trail friends.   AZ hiked in and met us at the shelter.   We were greeted with cookies and apples!  It was fun to catch up with everyone at the shelter.  


As we started our last 6 miles of the day, the sky turn dark and we could hear the rumble of thunder.  Soon the sky opened up and pour rain on us. The rain was soaking but warm. I didn’t put on my rain jacket and instead enjoyed the coolness of the rain.  We continued to hike as the trail became a stream of water.  Thunder and lightning struck close to us a few times and it made me hike faster.  The rain then turned colder and hail started.  The trail filled up with water and at times we were literally walking though water up to our calf. We all decided to embrace the craziness of the storm and we started to sing: Rain Drops Keep Falling on My Head. We laughed and talked as we hiked quickly down the trail.  


I wish I could have taken pictures if the trail today but the rain was so wet we did not stop and my phone would have been soaked. We hiked 15.5 miles today and ended at Delaware Water Gap.  Tomorrow we will leave PA and enter New Jersey!  


AZ had a rental car and this allowed us to quickly get to a nearby hotel to dry off.  We weren’t planning a night in a hotel but we were soaking wet and the staying in a tent didn’t seem like a wise option.

We crossed into New Jersey this morning. The AT crosses between PA & NJ over a bridge.  The mile long bridge is a toll road for 80 and it was a busy stretch of the highway. Thankfully there is a dedicated pedestrian lane for hikers.  


Once we were off the bridge, the climb up was slow and a long but beautiful.  It was seriously one of the easiest ascents we’ve had on the trail. The green tunnel kept us cool in the 90 heat.  We crossed over the 1300 mile marker but somehow missed it by 2 miles. We didn’t want to go back so we made a marker out if sticks. Later in the day other hikers told us that they took pictures at our handmade marker 👏. 


We slacked packed today & AZ meet us for part of the hike.  It was great conversation and the 15 miles flew by.  We ended the day with double Trail Magic. At mile 1310, Hungus (a 2018 thru hiker) and AZ provided some amazing hot dogs, burgers, beer & chips.  We enjoyed talking about the trail and both AZ and Hungus shared some great stories about their thru hikes.  We were the only hikers for the first few hours but then hikers began rolling in. We had quite a crew of hikers show up and the conversation was lively.  


So far New Jersey has been a nice mix of rocks, small climbs and stretches of Michigan miles.  We are thankful to be out of Pennsylvania & the crazy rocks 👏.

I’ve gotten behind with my trail journals...sorry!  Our hike has been good and time has just gotten away from me.  Tonight I’ll catch up by only writing a short entry for the days I’ve missed. 


—-


We are loving New Jersey!  The terrain is easier and varied. The miles flow by quickly despite the 90 degree heat. The miles have definitely easier because we’ve been slack packing with AZ’s help and it’s been a blast.  It almost feels like a vacation without a heavy pack. 


On June 6 we hiked 20 miles and were able to stop at Gyp’s Restaurant for lunch. We met up with a great group of hikers & it was fun to relax next to a small lake while we ate.  




June 7, it was hot again (90s) and we were thankful to be slack packing !  We hiked 16 miles today. The highlights of the day:

Eric & Shelly Cornish,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638894,"I’m still behind in my Trail Journal but I’ll do my best to get caught up today!  


Today was a crazy day with so many events that I kept a list 😳.  We started the hike early because we knew that we’d experience some rain today.  


It was HOT! I mean crazy hot.  No wind and high humidity.  As we hiked all I could think of was that if we were not on the trail I would NEVER go for a hike on a day this hot. But I’m now a thru hiker on the AT and I don’t have a choice, so I hike when it’s crazy hot.  


I’ve mentioned before that many hikers do crazy challenges on the hike and today we participated in our own way.  Some hikers are doing, “No Shirt New Jersey” as a challenge.  Today was so hot that I announced that I might need to pop hike in my sports bra today. The rest of the group laughed but as the miles ticked on the heat increased and soon everyone was hiking shirtless😳.  Truthfully taking our shirts off actually cooled us down quickly and with the green tunnel we didn’t worry about getting a sunburn. We took a selfie as a reminder of the crazy stuff we’ve done on the trail. 


The weather turned stormy as the day progressed. The rain turned to wind, thunder and then lightning quickly. We walked faster in an attempt to get off the trail sooner. We were 4 miles out from a late lunch stop and we navigated the trail as quickly as we could in the storm. 


Baked Potato was in front, then me, Grasshopper, and then AZ as we hiked. We came to a turn on the trail and I told BP that we should wait for the boys to catch up. Just as I was turning on the trail, my left foot landed on a Snake!  I screamed, stepped back, threw my poles down and screamed some more.  Grasshopper and AZ came running from behind and BP was at my side wondering what had happened. I told them I had stepped on a snake and when they went to investigate they saw the largest black rat snake we’ve seen on the trail(6-8 feet long).  It had slithered off the trail and was protecting itself from both the rain and humans.  


Thankfully it was a black rat snake.  I then worried that I hurt the snake but the boys reassured me that the snake appeared to be fine.  We continued our hike in the storm and my legs moved fast because of adrenaline.  We ran over wooden bridges and passed by cows as we scrambled to get out of the storm.  


We made it to a garden center/bakery for cover and food.  As soon as we got there a lightning bike struck nearby and the power went out.  Thankfully a generator kicked on and we were able to purchase a variety of treats and drinks.  Soon there were about 10 hikers and we ended up sitting on the floor of a garden center eating our treats & lunch. The owners were very hiker friendly and they even invited hikers to tent under the covered part of the awning. We waited out the storm for about an hour but decided to call it a day. We had hiked 14 miles and we were soaking wet. 


We headed back to that condo we were staying in to find that the power was out.  Thankfully it came on about 2 hours later and we were able to shower and have dinner.  


It was a crazy but great day on the trail!

I’ve gotten behind in my journal and I think the only way out of the whole is to combine my entrees.  We’ve been hiking well with the support of our awesome friend, AZ.  We’ve slacked packed until today (June 11) and have been enjoying the luxury of having access to a car (laundry, real beds, food, etc).  It’s been an amazing few days and at night we’d fall asleep exhausted.  


Here’s a breakdown of our mileage:


June 9 - 15 miles ending at Greenwood Lake, NY - staying in a condo


June 10 -17.6 miles ending at Palisades Interstate -stayed in a hotel 


June 11 - 15.3 miles camping at Hemlock Springs Campsite (1408.9)




Highlights of the last few days:


Stopping at a creamery and I ate a banana split while Grasshopper had 2 milkshakes.  The shakes equaled the 4 shakes he consumed at The Rabbit’s Hole.
Hitting the 1400 mile marker which means we only have 785 miles left to hike as of tonight. 


Our good friends from Michigan, Lesslee & Tina joined us today for a few days of hiking. We hiked the Trailside Zoo in Fort Montgomery and then climbed 600 feet to a Hemlock campsite. It’s great to see them and I’m excited for a day of hiking and talking❤️","

Our day started with light rain and overcast skies but the day turn into a nice day. Temperatures were in the low 70s and it was perfect for hiking.  It was great to hike with our friends, Tina & Lesslee. They did a nice job navigating the rocky trail and carrying backpacks for the first time.  We took our time and stopped for breaks including the Appalachian Market for breakfast sandwiches.  In total, we hiked 12 miles today and are camping at Dennytown Road Campsite(mile 1421).  It’s impressive that they hiked 12 miles on their first full day on the trail!


Baked Potato and Grasshopper would hike ahead which meant that we could have some girl time to hike and talk. It was great to catch up with my friends. It’s been a long 106 days and I value their friendship so much. Not many friends would drive 13 hours to hike 22 miles over two days on the AT. I’m one lucky girl with a full heart tonight. 


On a funny note, today Eric discovered that on both of our packs a built in whistle!  It’s right on the breast strap. Somehow we’ve hiked for 206 days without noticing this😳.  At camp Prime and Hiccup came in and we asked if they knew about the built in whistle.  They both had no idea and were excited when they found them on their pack. Sometimes it’s the small things that major you happy.

We woke up to dew covering our tent. It was so wet that we could almost ring it out.  Unfortunately all you can do is pack out a wet tent. If the sun comes out later in the day, you can put your tent out to dry out but today we know we are staying in a hotel tonight. We can hang it in our shower. 


Everyone woke up early and we prepared to 9 miles today to Tina’s car. Thankfully the sun came out and our hike was good. We even got to stop for lunch at a deli along the trail.  Both Tina and Lesslee hiked well with their full backpacks. It was fun to catch up with them as we hiked along old stone walls, large trees and a few rock scrambles. The trail seemed to endlessly go upward but the miles were easier with friends by your side.  


We reached Tina’s car by mid-afternoon after hiking 9 miles  and were all happy to shower. It’s amazing how dirty you get hiking.  We all enjoyed a pizza with some very large beers as a reward for our hike. Then Tina ran us around so both Eric and I could get some new gear/shoes.  


In the morning of June 15, my friends drove us back to the trail. We were sad to see our friends go but I’m fueled by their love and friendship. I’m impressed that they hiked 24 miles with us!  As we walked the trail and they drove off, I thought to myself, that I’m one lucky girl to have friends like them.  The sooner I finish that trail, the sooner I can get back to ALL my friends and family 🥰




June 14- Today’s entry is short & sweet. Eric and I hiked 19 miles and are staying in the shelter at Telephone Pioneer Shelter (mile 1448).   We are staying in the shelter because it’s suppose to thunderstorm tonight.

We are in Connecticut and are excited to be one state closer to Maine!  This is our 20th state out of 14 states.  Connecticut should be a fast state because it’s only around 45 AT miles. The terrain has changed with more climbs and rocks. Today we climbed over 4,000 feet while we hiked 19 miles.  It was a great day for hiking and we are camping at mile 1467 Schaghticoke MT Campsite.  730 left to the summit in Maine. 


We experienced two Trail Magic offerings. The first was a cooler left by the trail with Gatorade’s and sodas.  It came at a perfect time, right after a long climb. Then Stick’s mother (who happens to also be a graduate of Hope College!) set up some great snacks and some sparking wine🍷.  It was great to meet her and talk about Hope.  


Today we saw THREE snakes on trail😳.  The first was just a garter snake but the other two were copper heads or something similar. One of my biggest fears about the trail happened today. We were on a boardwalk with marshy waters all around us and we see a snake in the middle of the boardwalk.  We cannot walk around it so we have to wait till it moves!  We stomped our feet and poles but the snake didn’t move. Then we decided to wait. Another hiker, Sheep came up and she started throwing things at the snake to get it to move. I was worried this would make the snake mad but thankfully it slithered off to one side of the boardwalk. We carefully & safely walked past the snake. Then we saw a third snake!  Thankfully we safely past by all three snakes. What a day!

Connecticut is a beautiful but tough state to hike.  The climbs & descents have been more technical and they are littered with rocks. The trail is well manicured and we even saw a crew of volunteers working on the trail. We did have a nice 3 mile walk along the Housatonic River. We also saw the longest waterfall on the AT as we climbed some mountain that I do not know the name🤪.  


We are sleeping at a campsite at mile 1483 after hiking 18 miles. It was a long hiking day (7:30am till 7:00pm) and I’m exhausted. I’m definitely not in the middle states anymore. I was told that the trail would get tough again in New England and Connecticut is definitely tough.

It was a slow start to our day. We slept in a bit and were not hiking till 9am.  I had fallen yesterday and I didn’t sleep well due to some pain.  Thankfully tonight I’m feeling much better.  Eric and I have both fallen many times and thankfully we were just bruised.  We both know that one fall could end our hike😬.  We’ve seen too many of our trail friends get off due to injury.  When I fell yesterday, all I kept saying was “please don’t let this fall take me off the trail.”  I’m thankful to be slightly sore tonight and I hope sleep better. 


Our hike was bizarre today.  We went through a large section of trail that looked like something out of a Sci Fi movie.  Gypsy Moths have eaten away most of the leaves along the stretch of trail we hiked today. I don’t know much about Gypsy Moths but I can tell you they multiply in large numbers and eat any green leaves. The green canopy was gone and we walked among the partially dropped leaves.  It was eerie.  The Ridge Runner at our campsite told us that the Gypsy Moths pose a huge threat to the trees and today we saw the devastation. When I have WiFi, I’ll post pictures. 


The highlight of the day was having lunch at Mountainside Cafe. This cute cafe was only .30 miles off the trail. We had great fresh lemonade, falafels, and sweet potato fries. Eric indulged in a milkshake.  Milkshakes are now his AT tradition. We carried out two brownies that we ate tonight at camp.  We should have eaten the tuna we’ve been carrying but the allure of the restaurant was hard to resist! 


Tonight we are camping at mile 1498 camping at Limestone Spring Shelter (15 miles today).  Tomorrow we will hit the 1500 mile marker & Saturday we will enter Massachusetts.  It’s a big week!

Today was all about climbing!  We climbed nearly 4,250 feet today and we have one more big climb tomorrow morning. We climbed Bear Mt, the highest point on trail in Connecticut and than Race Mt.  Both were full of rocks scrambles on the descent but Race Mt was a rock face on top.  Hiking along the exposed rock face even made me a little nervous as it wove close to the edge of the mountain.  We were both glad it wasn’t raining or windy.  We also left CT and entered Massachusetts . We are now in our 11th state out of 14 states😳.  


Somehow we have managed to hike 1,500 miles and we passed the official  marker today on our hike!  We only have 679 miles to hike before we finish the trail. Thankfully the miles seem to be moving faster now than they did at the start of the hike.

Today was a hard day for me.  Last night when we got to camp we thought there would be water but the water was not good(stagnant). We rationed our water hoping that in the morning the water sources listed on Guthooks would be flowing with water. Unfortunately, the water was not moving and we wouldn’t get water until we were off trail!  


We started our hike early (6am) and began our climb without eating or drinking.  We knew Mt. Everett was rocky and we wanted to hike the 10 miles to Great Barrington before the day heated up.  The climb wasn’t too bad but that descent seemed to go on for miles. My legs felt weak and I’m certain my thirst/hunger played into my emotions.  I cried and hiked, then cried and hiked some more.  Eric did his best to keep me going on the trail but all I wanted to do is stop.  


Eventually we stopped and ate some breakfast (tortilla with honey, PB & raisins) and we took a few swigs of water.  My energy levels returned and we entered a flat section of the trail.  Soon mosquitos were swarming around us and bitting me, not Eric. I threw on my head mosquito net but should have also put on my long sleeve shirt.  My arms and legs are covered with bites😩.  Grasshopper had only a few bites.  He must not be as sweet as me.  


We made it to US Route 7 and our shuttle driver picked us up.  I was so excited get out of the woods today.  It had been 6 days since we’ve had a shower and we truthfully were thirstier and  hungrier than we’ve ever been on the trail. 


I’m happy to report that we are showered, well feed and I’ve done my best to ensure that I’m properly hydrated.  One of my trail fears is running out of water and today we came very close. I’m thankful that we were only hiking 10 miles and that we had planned to get off trail for the night.  Prayers that this doesn’t happen again.

Massachusetts is beautiful: tall pines, large rocks overgrown with moss, and a variety of trees including birches.  Today was all about climbing and our feet took us up 3,500 feet.  Somehow the climbs were balanced with stretches of somewhat flat trail which made the climbs easier. 


We booked our shuttle for 7am to head back to the trail.   At 6:30, we went to get breakfast at the hotel but found out it didn’t start till 7. We decided to walk to McDonalds but that too didn’t open till 7.  Then we tried the grocery store. It didn’t open till 7 either🤬.  At this point I started to cry. I was hungry and wanted some breakfast.  All we could do was walk back to the hotel and eat something out of our bags.  Our shuttle was waiting for us as we arrived at the hotel but Grasshopper went in to see if the hotel had any food.  He came back with bananas and blueberry muffins.👏. I’m  thankful for the food, especially the fresh fruit. 


Our hike was full of short stops to admire views (The Ledges) and we also walked around Benedict Pond. It was hot today (80) and little breeze, so we took our time. 


Tonight we are tenting at the North Mt Wilcox shelter (mile 1537) after hiking 13 miles. It wasn’t a large mile day but my legs tell me I’ve hiked enough and it’s time to call it a day.

It’s been 45 since we’ve had a Zero Day(a day off from hiking).  The last Zero was in Waynesboro, VA on May 7 when I had my second Covid shot.  We decided to hike 16 miles today to Lee, MA so that we can take a Zero Day.  We left camp early, 6am so that we could make the most of our time off.  


Thankfully the miles were easier despite climbing almost 3,000 ft.  We are staying at Chamberly Inn which is a former school turned into a cute B&B.  We booked the “smallest room” in New England (100 sq. ft) and have enjoyed lounging around.  Our Zero Day consisted of sleeping, eating. and watching TV.  It was awesome and much needed.  We did find a few moments for Eric to get a beard trim and I bought a new pair of Merrill hiking shoes.   Eric and I are both on our 4th pair of shoes so far on the trail. It’s amazing how quickly that trail wears down your shoes.  


Tomorrow we will head back out on the trail as we head toward Mt. Greylock (highest point in Massachusetts).  I’m hoping that the Zero Day has refreshed our legs! 👏

We slept well and got up early ready to hike.  We scheduled our shuttle back to the trail for 8am which gave us time to grab breakfast.  We walked over to Joe’s Diner and discovered it has been family owned for 60 years. It also inspired Norman Rockwell to sketch a father & son sitting on the bar stools.  The food was great and it was fun to see all the memorabilia about that Diner & Rockwell.  Truthfully much of Lee looked like it was out of a movie or magazine. In fact the downtown reminded me of Main Street at Disney.  


Our hike started with a big climb but the rest of the day was spent walking the ridge line.  The trail was not technical so we were able to pound out 19 miles.  Tonight we are camping at mile 1572.  We are actually in a neighborhood in Dalton, Massachusetts and are camping in the yard of Trail Angel, Tom Levardi. Tom is a great guy and he opens his yard up to thru hikers👏.  I’m not sure his neighbors appreciate his hospitality but we certainly are happy to be camping here.  For dinner we walked just down the road to Dewey’s.  Grasshopper and I filled our bellies (salad, burgers & dessert).  In the morning, we will walk right through town and back to the woods.  It’s fun when the trail passes through these trail towns. It’s nice to get a glimpse of these towns and it’s also great to fill our bellies at local restaurants.  


In the morning we will start our hike to Mt. Greylock and depending on our legs we will either summit tomorrow or first thing Friday morning. Thankfully the weather looks good (70s and sunny) both days.

We enjoyed staying in Dalton, MA in Tom’s yard. He is a true gem and has been helping hikers for over 42 years. Grasshopper and I packed up in the morning and prepared to head out for the day. Tom brought out coffee, fruit and hard boiled eggs.  We sat down at the picnic table and Tom began telling stories.  We drank coffee and listen. Tom has so many great hiker stories and we could have stayed there all day.  Tom mentioned that he helps with slack packing and we decided to jump at the opportunity to hike without our full packs.  


Tom drove us up to the top of Mt. Greylock (3,489’) and we hiked back to his house in Dalton, MA.  We climbed the 93 foot tall lighthouse style monument at the top of Mt. Greylock. The view was perfect and we could see so many mountains in the distance. I’d recommend visiting Mt. Greylock if you are ever in the area, it beautiful.  


As we hiked South, we ran into many thru hikers we know.  It was fun to chat and it helped pass the 18 miles (Aqua Dog, Sticks, Ranger,  Whistler, etc).  Every hiker we talked to was staying the night at Bascom Lodge (located the summit of Mt. Greylock & built by the CCC).  Eric called to see if the Lodge had any extra rooms and we were in luck.  We then had to arrange to be driven back up to the top of Greylock once we had finished our 18 mile hike.  Thankfully everything worked out perfectly and we were able to spend the historic Lodge.  We even got an amazing dinner and breakfast.

We are sleeping in our 12th state tonight, Vermont👏 and are camping at Seth Warner Shelter(mile 1602) after hiking only 13 miles today.  We crossed the 1600 mile marker.  It’s a big day! 


The descent off Mt. Greylock was really no big deal.  Other hikers had warned us that it’s a technical/steep descent but either we took the wrong way down or we are now badass hikers 🤪.  


We hiked quickly and were able to grab lunch in Adams, MA at The Breakroom.  It was a cool restaurant in an old factory. The place was hiker friendly and they even gave us a free pastry to take with us.  


It was an easier day of hiking with less miles.  Tomorrow we are hoping to wake up early and hike 21 miles😬.  Prayers that our legs are strong enough to hike 21 Vermont miles.

Blessings - chatting with thru hikers tonight and at the Trail Magic.  It’s always good to talk to others who understand exactly what you are doing.

Bugs, slugs & mud!  Vermont is called Ver-mud by hikers and it is living up to its name.  The trail is full of rocks & roots, huge climbs(we climbed 5,000 ft today), and crossed at least 30 mud puddles.  We were trying to hike 22 miles to the next shelter (Goddard Shelter) but my legs would not let me finish the miles.  Tonight Grasshopper and I are stealth camping  after hiking 17 miles (mile 1619.7). The campsites are spaced out weird for our hiking pattern. Tomorrow we have a shelter opportunity at mile 8, 13 or 24😳.  We likely will push as far as we can and stealth camp again tomorrow night.  


Trail friends, Sticks & Ranger just passed by our stealth spot.  They are pushing to the shelter so they can watch the sunset over Glastenbury Mountain. 


As I was unpacking and getting the tent ready, I found a slug that hitched a ride with me today. It was in my outer mesh pocket and it had slimmed up everything it touched🤢 including my water filter.  Oh, the joys of living in nature.






Blessings- the cool breeze that was steady all day!

Today was our longest hike yet on trail.  We woke early and set off with the goal of getting to over Stratton Mt and staying at that shelter(a 23 mile day😳).  We pounded out 4 miles and caught up with trail friends, Sticks & Ranger.  Together we hiked the remaining miles together and the conversation helped all of us to climb almost 5,000ft of ascent over the 23 miles.  


About 15 miles into our hike we found Cokes chilling in a stream. It was like a dream because we all were so tired and thirsty.  We appreciate the efforts of the mystery Trail
Angel.  
The trail was a nice variety of rocks, roots, sweet smelling pine trees and small annoying bugs that would not leave you alone. Vermont is green and lush(the Green Mountains do not disappoint).

Blessings- hiking with Sticks & Ranger.  We enjoyed good conversations which helped the miles to fly quickly.

We woke early full of anticipation of clean clothes, food, showers but mostly seeing my sister Amy & nephew Ezra.  We’ve not seen Amy and Ezra in over a year!  Ezra is coming to hike with us for two weeks on the AT. He just did his shakedown hike in the Manistee National Forest for 4 days. During his shakedown got to experience consecutive rain days which is great training for the AT🤪.  The weather looks like rain for us for the next few days🤷‍♀️


Our hike was typical Ver-mud but we did see some moose droppings!  We did cross a marking indicating that we’ve crossed 3/4ths of the trail!  It’s amazing to think that we only have a 1/4 of the trail left.  


Our 10 mile hike went quickly and as we got to the trailhead we found that we didn’t have any cell service so we hitch hiked! Grasshopper and I put our thumb out and in about 10 minutes a couple in a large white pickup stopped. They stopped because her brother had hiked the trail and she knew how important rides/Trail Magic are to hikers. They drove us down to the hotel and as we pulled in, Amy & Ezra were just pulling into the hotel👏.  


We enjoyed great food, rest, and showers in Manchester.  It’s a wonderful town & we’d like to come back to check out the flagship Orvis store.

Grasshopper and I were refreshed from good food, showers, sleeping in a bed and hanging out with family.  We prepped our daypack and helped Ezra prepare for his first AT hike.  My sister, Amy, shuttled us to the trailhead and we headed onto the trail.  


Amy prepared Trail Magic (fresh fruit, lemonade, cookies & candy) and she drove 5 miles down trail to set up. Our hike started with a climb up Bromley Mt (3,363 ft) and we were delighted to discover that it is a ski resort. We hiked up an easy green run to the top with the main chairlift.  It would be a great place to camp.  Once we headed down the mountain we met Amy with her Trail Magic.  It was fun to hear her talk about the other hikers she met as she waited for us.  We were thankful for the break and the yummy food.


We continued our hike and were impressed with Ezra’s athletic ability. He sprinted up the trail and leaps from rock to rock with ease. He is clearly comfortable walking in the woods. We hiked over Styles and Baker Peak. Ezra looked like a Mountain Goat as he nimbly navigated the rocky terrain.  We told him his trail name should be Mountain Goat and he happily accepted the name.  Unfortunately, right after receiving his name he fell about 2 feet off a rock he was traversing😳. Thankfully he is ok from the fall but now we tease him that his name is really Falling Mountain Goat. 


Rain began falling and we walked the remaining miles in the rain. It’s really no big deal to hike in the rain especially when you know that you have dry clothes and a dry bed to sleep in.  Amy met us at Mike 1671 which made for a 17 mile day.  We were all soaking wet and pleasantly tired from our hike. 


Back in Manchester we ate big burgers and peach pie for dinner.

We slept in which was awesome!  When I woke, I laid in bed for a few minutes just enjoying the comfort of the clean, dry & warm bed.  I knew we were headed back to the trail and that the forecast calls for three days of rain😬.  Hiking in the rain is something we’ve done often but it always adds complication to the day (rain jacket on but then you get sweaty, setting up or packing up in the rain, rocks/roots are slippery when wet OR pooping in the rain).  Rain adds new dynamics to the hike .  


Amy drove us to the trailhead and we set off on our 12 mile hike.  We started at USFS Road 10 and had an easy start to our hike. The terrain was easier and we climbed up to a beaver bog/lake that was really pretty. The trail follows the edge of the lake and then disappears into a pine forest. The forest was enchanting and reminded me of hiking to Clingman’s Dome: moss, pines, rocks covered in moss, and ferns.The rain cooled us down and we were not soaking wet.  Tonight we are camping at mile 1683 Minerva Hinchey Shelter. We were hoping to stay inside the shelter but it was already full when we arrived. We are camping near the shelter.  Everyone at the shelter had received Trail Magic from my sister and they were excited to meet us. They raved about how kind Amy was and they were impressed at the spread of food as well as the fact that she took people’s garbage. There was a family with twins (Henry & Finn) and it was fun for Ezra to talk to other kids.  


Ezra did well today but his backpack was riding funny on him. About 4 miles into the hike, I traded him packs so I could figure out what was going on.  We hiked and I rearranged how the back was packed as well as played with the straps. The food was up top which put too much pressure on his neck.  We also put his sleeping pad on the bottom of the pack instead of the top.  I ended up hiking the remaining miles with his pack & in the morning I’m hoping he’ll do better with his own pack.

I’m falling in love with Vermont. It’s beyond beautiful and is tough but not crazy tough to hike.  Today we hiked 14.5 miles and are sleeping atop Mt. Killington(mile 1697).  The climb up Killington reminded me of Mt. Rogers in VA & the hike up Clingeman’s in the Smokies.  The smell of fresh pine and the mossy rocks created a fantasy-like climb to 4,235 feet. 


Today we did a good job of taking breaks and eating snacks. Our food bags are heavy and we are trying to lighten them before we pick up a resupply box tomorrow.  We were fortunate to not have any rain today but as soon as we climbed in our tents the rain started. I also had one bar of service but now with the rain, I have no service.  The weather and mountains always seem to impact my cell service.  


We stopped for lunch at Governor Clement Shelter and we discovered that the privy was brand new!  It is the largest and nicest privy we have seen on the trail.  As we left, I called it the Taj Mahal of privies and that I would consider sleeping in the privy if the weather was bad. Mountain Goat, my nephew, look at me like I was crazy and then said something along the lines of, “you’ve been on the trail too long if you’d consider sleeping in a privy.”  Perhaps, I have lived in the woods too long 🤪.  


Today we hit the official 500 miles to Mt. Katahdin sign👏!  We love these small symbols of process along the trail. In the morning we will cross 1700 miles on the AT.

Rain, rain, rain!  We set up camp last night atop of Mt. Killington and we woke up in a puddle.  Everything was wet, even our shoes were already wet before we started the day.  This isn’t the first time we’ve been wet but it’s tough when you see it’s going to rain again all day.  Our gear was not going to dry out and we’d be sleeping our soaked tents again.  We made the decision to get off the trail to dry out. 


We hiked only 8 miles today and are staying at a great little hiker place, the Inn at the Long Trail.  This place has a great Irish bar/restaurant and very cozy rooms.  It also has a washer & dryer and is steps from the AT.  My sister had dropped a box off at the Inn for resupply and originally we had intended to only pick up the box.  We feasted on burgers and beers at lunch; Mountain Goat isn’t old enough to drink so he had a water. Tonight we had Irish Strew and Chicken Pot Pie; Mountain Goat had another burger.   http://www.innatlongtrail.com


We plan on heading out in the morning but we know it will rain.  Fingers crossed that we stay as dry as possible.

Rain, rain, rain!  Mountain Goat says he is cursed. It rained while he hiked in Michigan and now it has rained 4 out of the 5 days he’s been hiking with us. Today we started in rain then the rain stopped for a few hours but it started again by mid-afternoon.  We are now sleeping in Winturri Shelter (mile 1724) after hiking 18.5 miles.  I’m listening to the pound of rain on the shelter’s roof. We are thankful to be somewhat out of the rain and mostly dry.  




Initially we planned on stopping at a shelter around 16 miles into our hike but we actually missed the shelter.  We saw a sign for “The Lockout” but we assumed it was an actual lookout. Instead, it turned out to be the actual shelter.  Once we realized our mistake it didn’t make sense to go back.  We pushed on another 2.5 to the shelter we are sleeping in tonight.  


Mountain Goat was a strong hiker today.  He actually hiked faster once he realized we missed the first shelter.  I had a hard time keeping up with him.   It was awesome to see him move swiftly up that trail toward the goal of the further shelter.  A few days ago he said the following after a long hard day, “Hiking is torture you choose.”  He’s definitely going to be able to tackle a thru hike of his own.

Hello New Hampshire!  




We really loved hiking in Vermont but are happy to be sleeping in our 13th state, New Hampshire. We had hoped we’d make Hannover by the 4th of July but we were short by 10 miles. Finally at 4pm, we decided to call it a day of hiking so that we could enjoy the holiday.  


One of my good friend’s daughters is a student at Dartmouth and Shelby has been our Trail Angel the past two days. Shelby picked us up on the 4th and drove us to our hotel.  She also let us do laundry at her house because there was not an open laundry service drying the holiday weekend.  She also drove us to resupply.  She also shuttled us so we could finish the 10 miles we missed.  I’m thankful for her help and happy to say we are officially in New Hampshire. 


NH scares me as a hiker but I’m hoping all that I’ve learned over the past 1700 miles have prepared me for “The Whites.”  We will be hiking above tree line and over some technical terrain over the next week. We are hoping to slack pack some of NH to ease the difficulty. I’ll do my best to capture the trail but pictures never do it justice (angle & difficulty).  Prayers that we can safely handle “The Whites.”


We will leave Hannover in the morning & service may be spotty. I’ll do my best up update my Trail Journal as service allows.

New Hampshire welcomed us with some steep climbs but some easier terrain.  We climbed over 4,700 ft today.  After a breakfast of pastries and yogurt,  we left around 9:30 and hiked until almost 7:00.  We were happy to catch up with Prime, Hiccup, Sticks, & Ranger. We all were exhausted by the time we got to camp.  I’ll keep this post short and sweet. 


Tonight we are camping at mile 1767 after hiking 17 miles.

Wow! I was one tired girl last night. The hike was not technical but we climbed and descended almost 5,000 feet😳.  We also started hiking at 7am and did not get to camp until almost 7:30pm.  Thankfully Sticks and Ranger helped to motivate us.  Mountain Goat did a great job motivating me to finish the last few miles.  Mountain Goat has also found his trail legs and is moving quickly up trail.  Grasshopper has been carrying Mountain Goat’s stove and I’m carrying his tent. We did this at the start to help ease the weight of his pack.  Now that he’s sprinting ahead of us on the trail, it’s time to add his gear back to his pack. 


When we got to camp last night it was busy with a group for a local high school. The advisor was taking this group on their first hiking trip.  It reminded me of the Sierra Club/Bike & Boot Club from my local high school.  These kids are lucky to be experiencing a hiking trip like this & I’m certain that it will leave a powerful impact on their lives much like the trips I took in my younger years.  I’m hoping Mountain Goat will take memories of this trip with him forever.  I’m certainly glad he joined us on the trail.  


We summited Smarts & Cube mountains today.  We could see the fire tower on top of Smarts Mt as we hiked toward it and then on top of the fire tower I could see mountain ranges that seem to stretch for miles.  It was breathe taking and I did my best to capture a few photos.  
 
Last night we camped at mile 1786 Ore Hill campsite after hiking 19 miles.

It rained all night and we woke up in a puddle!  We had set our tent up late and the sites were all less than desirable.  Mountain Goat thankfully was perfectly dry aside from the typical wetness on his rainfly. 
We packed up and began our 7 mile hike to the Hikers Hostel in Glencliff, NH.  The hike was easier and we were motivated by showers and food. We arrived by noon and were happy to be out of the rain.  Our food bags were almost empty and we did our best to polish off what was left since we knew we’d be buying more soon.  
Baked Potato arrived at the hostel and it was great to see him.  We’ve been hiking with him for hundreds of miles and he had gotten off trail for a few days to visit friends.  While off trail he discovered that classic bulls eye from a tick bite and was treated by a physician; thankfully he’s feeling much better.  In fact he hiked 43 miles in two days to catch up with us!   It will be great to finish the trail with Baked Potato. 
Blessings - We stopped hiking at mile 1794 after only 7 miles of hiking. It was nice to take a Nero(a day with less hiking miles than you normally hike).

Zero day!  We decided not to hike today.  Hurricane Elsa is heading our way and the forecast looked a little crazy. We also all felt that the terrain of Mt. Moosilauke was best on a non-rainy day.  Tomorrow looks like clear skies so we are sitting out today. 


 The day is all about catching up on sleep, calories, emails, phone calls, texts and relaxation.  We did a resupply last night at the local connivence store and we’ve been shoveling calories into our body all morning. Truthfully it’s good to have a day off and my feet are thankful.  


In the morning we will head back up the trail to hike over Mt. Moosilauke(4,802’) and head toward the Kinsman Mountains.  We are entering some of the toughest climbs and descents on the entire trail.

We’ve discovered that hiking in New Hampshire changes everything. We are used to hiking between 15-19 miles a day but big miles are impossible in the White Mountains. The climbs are steeper and the rocks are bigger.  Thankfully the trail has prepared us for big climbs and rock scrambles.  We’ve also learned when we should stop hiking for a day.  Our miles are less these last few days but that’s what our body needs.


On June 12 -we left camp early and we hiked down to Lomesome Lake Hut. We were happy to grabbed a few snacks and a cup of coffee.  Then we headed down to Franconia Notch to meet my sister and her family.  Mountain Goat is leaving the trail so that he can go back home for Band Camp.  We loved having Mountain Goat on trail and were impressed with his ability to quickly move over rocks. He also got his trail legs quickly and typically led our group down the trail.  I’m certain he will be back out hiking in Michigan soon and perhaps he will embark on a thru-hike of his own someday. 
 
My sister met us at a trailhead with Subway sandwiches and our resupply for the next 5 days. She and my niece did our shopping for us last night. They were so kind to open all the packaging and to put everything into ziplock bags for us.  It was great to see them and we are thankful for the help.  


We hike up toward Mt. Lincoln and stopped at Liberty Spring Campsite for the night after hiking only 8.5 miles (mile 1822).

We woke early and were excited to hike Franconia Ridge today.  We left camp by 6am and the hike started out easy despite a steep climb to Little Haystack Mt.  As we crested Mt. Lincoln (5,089 ft), the wind picked up and the sky grew dark. A storm was approaching quickly.  


As we hiked toward Mt. Lafayette (5,260 ft), it started to rain.  Then the wind increased to the point that it was difficult to hike; Grasshopper thinks the wind was over 20mph.  I was glad for the weight of my backpack because at points I felt like I would be blown off the trail. We hiked as fast as we could so that we could get down to tree line.  Franconia Ridge has over 3 miles of exposed ridge line and we were caught in the middle of a storm.  Sleet started pelting our bodies but I was thankful that due to the direction of the wind the sleet was hitting my back. We hiked as quickly as we could so that we could get below tree line. 


As we continued to hike we could see a Southbound hiker sheltering from the storm.  She ended up following us in the tree line so that she could get some protection from the elements. We saw other hikers in a makeshift huddle under tarps as they waited out the storm.  Thankfully we were moving off the ridge and into the tree line. 


Mt. Garfield was our last climb of the day (4,500ft).  As we descended Garfield the trail turned seemed to turn into a waterfall.  The trail became a jumble of rocks that had a large stream of water cascading down. I would NOT have believed this was the trail but there were four blazes that lined the start of the trail. Ironically, New Hampshire has been a poorly blaze state.  The trail seems to just be trail.  Most of the time you know you are on the trail except at interchanges.  When New Hampshire does decide use a blaze, they do it their own way. White blazes as supposed to be 2X6, the size of the US dollar bill.  We’ve seen super small blazes, drippy blazes, wide blazes, square blazes, and just plan huge blazes in New Hampshire.  I’ve taken pictures of some of the crazy ones & I’ll upload when I have WiFi.


We ended up hiking to Galehead Hut to eat our late lunch but we decided to stay the night because we all were exhausted and cold. I’m now laying in my bunk with my belly full and I’m thankful to be at the hut tonight.  All of our thru hiker friends are braving the elements tonight and I pray that are safe.

Grasshopper joked that New Hampshire imported mud from Vermont since we’ve seen so much on the trail these past few days.  Then we began to think of all the things in New Hampshire that we’ve experienced already on that trail:


Rocks of varying sizes & shapes scattered across the trail - Pennsylvania 


Fog socked views - Georgia 


Rain, wind & fog - Tennessee & North Carolina 


Descents that wind down rocks and a river -Virginia 


Climbs that go straight up without any switchbacks - Vermont & Connecticut 




Today was a good day for hiking. We woke up dry and warm thanks to a nights stay in Galehead Hut.  Then we enjoyed a great breakfast before heading out. It was misty and foggy when we set off but soon the sun came out.  We even got a few views later in the day. 


We had a great lunch at Zealand Falls Hut and tonight we are sleeping at Ethan Pond Shelter (mile 1845) after hiking 12 miles. The afternoon we hiked a flat section of trail that felt like we were hiking in Michigan. It was a refreshing change from the climbs we’ve been doing the past few days.

We had amazing weather today which meant the views were out of this world.  We started our day under tree cover as we left Ethan Pond Shelter and ended our day walking below tree line for almost 7 miles.  The views were as far as the eye could see and up the ridge you could see people moving ahead of you on the trail.  When I have WiFi I’ll post pictures and video.  The views were truly breathtaking. 


Today we climbed Mt. Webster (3,910’) and Mt. Pierce (4, 310’) before walking the ridge line to the base of Mt. Washington. We stopped for lunch at  Mizpah Hut and a woman  who we’d met a few days before decided to buy our lunch. She is a day hiker and enjoys talking with thru hikers.  It was so kind of her and this is a great example of the Trail Magic we’ve had along the trail.  


It’s only 7:30 and I’m laying on my bunk after an amazing dinner at Lake of the Clouds Hut. The huts are a little pricey but the benefits of a warm bed and fresh cooked meal make the cost reasonable in my opinion.  


My alarm is set for 4:30am.  We will be on the trail by 5:00am so that we can summit Mt. Washington before the rain that is forecasted for mid morning.  We will hike to Pinkham Notch so that we can stay in a hotel tomorrow night. It has been 5 days since we’ve showered or done laundry.  We are really smelly and our food bag is almost empty. If we didn’t eat in the huts these past few days we would have run out of food. 😳.  I’m so thankful for the huts! 








We hiked 14 miles and are sleeping at the Lake of the Clouds Hut (mile 1858).

We moved quickly up the side of the mountain despite the steep incline and rocky path.  As we hiked the wind speed increased to the point that we could not easily hike without falling over.  Then fog rolled in and we could not see more than a few feet ahead of us.  


We summited Mt. Washington and it was clear that the conditions were dangerous. The wind was so strong that we couldn’t hike without almost falling over.  Grasshopper thinks the winds were between 40-50 mph.  We looked for a place to get out of the elements but all the doors were locked at the summit. Our cellphones were not working so we couldn’t check the weather or see what time everything opened at the summit. We sat inside the opening of a doorway and debated what to do. Should we wait if out at the summit and perhaps the storm would pass?  Should we attempt the descent and the 7 miles above tree line?  Should we head back down to the Lakes of the Clouds Hut?  


We debated the options and one thing was clear, it was NOT safe to hike.  After over 1800 miles of hiking North we decided to turn around and hike South to the safety of the Lake of the Clouds Hut.  On the 1.6 mile descent we stayed together for safety but between the rocks and extremely wind, I fell two times.   Thankfully, I  am only bruised and scraped up.  Nothing was broken.  Once we made it back to the Hut, we knew our only option was to take a side trail down the mountain.  


For those who don’t know, Mt. Washington is known to have some of the most extreme weather conditions in the USA. Over 200 people have died hiking Washington due to the extreme weather conditions. Article: https://snowbrains.com/mount-washington-nh-home-of-the-worlds-worst-weather/


We were lucky enough to secure a shuttle to Gorham, NH and we enjoyed a night in the luxury of a town.  We were all thankful to be safe, warm, and dry tonight. 


July 17 - After the stress of summiting Mt. Washington,  we decided to take a Zero Day today. Our goal was to relax, eat as many calories as possible and to recharge. 


 
We hiked 5 miles & will return to Mt. Washington when the weather is safer.

Blessings -We are blessed to have safely descended Mt. Washington safely.

It’s raining again! We are packed but I crawled back into the warm & dry hotel room bed. I want to savor a few more minutes of luxury before we head back out on the trail.  We’ve had so much rain lately and the forecast continues to call for more rain.  


After the scare on Mt. Washington we skipped ahead to Pinkham Notch (2,050 ft) and will complete the descent off Mt. Washington when the weather is favorable.  We started the rock scrambles up the Wildcat Mts (4,442 ft) right after we began our hike. These scrambles were fierce: large boulders with steep inclines and the rain made it difficult to climb. We climbed as quickly as we could but Baked Potato was slowing down due to a sore hip. He’s been nursing a hip injury for weeks and it flares up every once in awhile. About an hour into our hike, he was having difficulty moving.  We decided to push toward Carter Notch Hut so that he could stop for the day.  As we summited one of the Wildcat Mts, we noticed we were on top of a ski resort.  Our plans changed and we decided to hike down the easy green run to the ski resort lodge.  The easier terrain allowed us to safely get Baked Potato off the trail so that he could rest his hip.  We secured a ride with Bruce, a 87 year young former thru hiker turned shuttle driver.  


We decided to stop for the remainder of the day and enjoy the comforts of the hostel. We are excited to see Moss Rock & Goose at the hostel. The girls and the rest of the Cornell kids have either been a day or two ahead or behind us on the trail. It’s always fun when we run into them.  


In the morning, Grasshopper and I head back to the trail to finish the Wildcats.  Baked Potato stays behind at the hostel to rest.  The trail is very wet and soon it starts raining again.  It’s impossible to avoid stepping in calf deep mud/water.  I’ve given up trying to go around mud puddles instead finding some joy in walking right through the middle like s kid.  


We hike for over 10 hours in the cold rain. At one point, I slip and fall on my left knee.  The fall opens up a floodgate and I begin crying like a baby. I’m exhausted, cold, wet, and sore. I declare that New Hampshire is too tough and has broken me.  I say aloud, I’m done.  But I have no choice but to hike on.  There is no easy or fast way to get off the trail.  We continue to hike.  


At the end of the day is a rainbow. Our friend AZ and his wife Elizabeth are picking us up at the trailhead. Dinner, a shower, warm bed, and the comfort of friends await.  Grasshopper and I are also done with the White Mountains and the Presidential range!  It has been the toughest part of the hike but I’m thrilled to say that we are only 298 miles away from finishing the trail!  And only 30 miles from leaving New Hampshire and entering our final state, Maine!




-
Blessings - We are thankful for our friendship with AZ!  It’s great that he is back on the trail for a little but with us.

Welcome to Maine! We were happy to get out of New Hampshire and excited to be in our 14th and final state!  The finish line is getting closer every day👏


We are still on the trail and are chipping away at the miles.  Our days have been busy and as a result I’ve neglected my journal.  Here’s a quick overview of the past few days: 


July 20- I took a rest day while Grasshopper and our friend AZ took the Cog train up to Mt. Washington.  The boys decided to hike Washington together since we abandoned our hike previously due to poor weather.  I think Grasshopper needed some time with a friend and I enjoyed getting to know AZ’s wife, Elizabeth.  


July 21- We hiked from Gorham and headed into Maine.   It rained and the miles were difficult but we crossed 1900 miles & slept in Maine!  16 miles hiked


July 22- I was honestly scared of today’s hike.  Hikers talk about how 7 miles of today’s hike are the hardest miles of the entire trail.  Last night I stayed up thinking of Mahoosuc Notch & the Arm (3,985’). I worried that we’d get lost or that it would be too difficult but honesty it was kinda fun but still scary. We didn’t get lost and it was almost like a choose your own adventure.  You could go under the boulders or over the boulders.  I did slip once as I was trying to climb up a large Boulder scramble and I almost fell into abyss😳.  Thankfully I caught myself, otherwise I’m certain the fall would have ended my hike. If you have a chance, google Mahoosuc Notch and check out images or videos from other hikers.  I’ll do my best to post the few pictures we took. 14 miles hiked 




July 23- Beautiful day to hike!  Sun❤️ The mikes flew by and we were greeted by our friends AZ and Elizabeth with Trail Magic(cold beers, hot dogs, chips & salad).  They met us on trail with the awesome dog Rangeley and we were happy to snuggle in the back of the car with their dog as we drove to the hotel. Our friends literally gave us the clothes off their backs to help us stay on trail. Eric’s pants split on the backside 😳 and my knee brace was no longer working.  We looked at Walmart and I couldn’t find the right braces. Elizabeth kindly gave me her braces.  We are so thankful for their friendship and support while we’ve been hiking. - 10 miles hiked 


July 24- We had a sunny day for hiking and the terrain was not too bad. Maine is full of rocks and roots!  Great day for hiking. Staying at a really cool hostel. It’s a a dome that tucked in the woods and it has an awesome view of the trail.  The owner, Ryan Holt has been on the tv show Naked and Afraid. I’ve never seen the show but it sounds like he was on the show a few times. http://www.humannaturehostel.com. - 10 miles hiked 


-
Blessings - Finally having sun again to hike!  It’s amazing how much easier it is to hike on a beautiful day! 


Merit Badge - Trail Angels AZ and Elizabeth for going above the call of duty to keep Grasshopper and I on that trail.

It’s raining again but we are heading out to hike 13 miles today. Thankfully the finish line today means that we will shower and sleep in the hostel for one more day. 


We started the day with a big climb from 1420 feet to 3600 feet up Ole Blue Mt. No views because of the rain but after the climb the trail was pretty easy compared to New Hampshire.  We hiked while it sprinkled and were thankful that we didn’t get the thunderstorms that were originally forecasted.  The miles went quickly and soon we were at the end of the hike, Maine Route 17 with spectacular views known at the Height of the Land with views of the Bemis Mts and some lakes.  


We hiked alone all day and only saw two southbound thru hikers all day. The rain must have kept all the hikers away today.  At the trailhead we ran into a few hikers who were also slack packing and they started the day after us in February.  I recognized them but we’ve never spoken till today.  Unfortunately I cannot remember their names but I’m hoping our paths will cross up trail.

I’ve gotten myself behind in my journal entries but I thought it would be easiest to start with today since it’s freshest in my memory.  


We woke up wet from rain last night but thankfully the day eventually was sunny.  We took time at breaks to dry out our gear. Our tent is dry but tonight as we brought out our sleeping bags we found the feet wet.  We should have dried our bags in the sun with our tent.  


Maine is beautiful and the terrain has been easier than New Hampshire!  We did have a long stretch that felt like a Michigan Mile👏.  We met a number of South bound hikers and only saw Sticks & Ranger as North bound hikers.  One of the South bound hikers was this fresh eyed kid who was so adorable. When I asked if he was a thru hiker, his response was, “I hope to be.”  I used to respond similarly to that question when asked early on the trail.  I told him together we make a full thru hiker since we’ve completed all that he hasn’t and vice versa.  It’s fun to chat for a few minutes with the hikers you meet along the trail.  


We hiked 17 miles stealth camping at East Carry Pond (mile 2032) with Sticks & Ranger. We sat on a large rock and ate dinner together over looking the pond. The sunset was clouded but the conversation was lively.  We even shared some airplane bottles of bourbon I’ve been carrying in my pack.  It was a fun way to end the night.  


-
Blessings - We are extra food tonight because we will resupply tomorrow at a local hostel.  It’s always fun when you know you can eat extra food because you are resupplying👏.

Today was the perfect hiking day. We woke up early and were on the trail by 6:40am.  The sun was up and it was a crisp summer morning. About a mile into our hike a saw a female moose coming down the trail!  Once it saw me, it turned and ran into the woods.  Thankfully, Grasshopper saw the Moose too.  


span class=""Apple-converted-space""> The ferry is the official way across the river and the 100 feet count in our miles.  Some hikers try to ford the river but it’s a strong current and a few have drowned attempting.  We decided to opt for the safe route. 


After the Kennebec we stopped at the Sterling Inn.  This hostel picked us up at the trailhead and we showered, did laundry, resupplied, and ate a pizza all in 3 hours. We also saw Dallas & Hamlet at the Inn.  They are both staying the night at the Inn but I’m sure they will blow by us on the trail tomorrow.  We hiked an additional 5 miles today after the stop at the Inn. 


As we were hiking we stopped to talk to a Southbound hiker.  The hiker looked at Grasshopper and said, “Are you Dr. Cornish?”  😳  He recognized Grasshopper because he is from Alpena and Grasshopper was his doctor.  The hiker is Josh Ayers from Alpena.  I told him I’d look up his mom, Dennis Ayers when I return to Alpena in a few weeks and let her know we’d connected on trail.  What a small world! 


Tonight we are tenting at Pleasant Pond Shelter.  There are a number of other hikers but no one we know aside from Sticks & Ranger. 




We hiked 16 miles today.

It was a great day for hiking! Sunny and cool weather which made the miles fly by.  We hiked 
13.5 miles over Pleasant Pond Mt and Moxie Bald.  Both climbs and descents were easier and less technical than other mountains.  Maine is beautiful and is a nice change from the ruggedness of New Hampshire. The views from the tops of the mountains were all lakes and trees for as far as the eye could see.  Maine is super remote and feels to us like being in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.  Oh, we saw two snakes on trail today. Thankfully, the snakes moved off trail for us. 👏


Tonight we are in a shelter at Bald Mt Lean-To
at mile 2060.  We stopped so that we could sleep in a shelter rather than tent in the rain tonight.

It rained all night but we were dry in the shelter. We packed up dry but then hiked in the rain for most of the day.  We forded a few rivers today and debated about changing our hiking shoes for camp shoes.  We opted to change and I’m glad I did because leeches were attached to our camp shoes😳.  They were easy to see because of that drastic color contrast (green shoes vs black leech).  If we had worn our hiking shoes it would have been difficult to see the leeches.  


The terrain was the easiest we’ve had on trail and it felt like hiking in Michigan. I told Grasshopper that I should section hike this part of Maine with my girlfriends because it’s both beautiful and easier.  Anyone interested next summer?  


We are staying tonight at Lakeshore Hostel and then we move to Shaw’s Hostel for our Zero day tomorrow.  We stopped at the ATC center and finally have our official thru hiker tags!  The ATC didn’t start handing out tags until after we’d gone through Harper’s Ferry so Monson was the next place we could pick up our tags. 


Lunch was at a local deli and we sat outside with Ranger, Sticks & Dallas enjoying the now sunny day.  We talked about the trail and then reflected on our epic adventures along the way.  It was a good afternoon and we all enjoyed an adult beverage as we talked. 






We hiked 18 miles and are in Monson, Maine, the last town prior to finishing the trail!

Zero day!  This is our last day off before hiking the 100 mile wilderness and summiting Mt. Katahdin.  I was hoping to sleep in but unfortunately our roommate didn’t allow that to happen (this is one crazy story that I’ll share once we get home). 


We were up early and headed to Monson General Store to grab breakfast and resupply.  We sat eating with Nic who owns Lakeshore Hostel and we exchanged stories about our roommate from last night. We headed over to Shaw’s Hostel so that we could coordinate our food drop for the 100 Mile Wilderness.  We are thinking that it will take 8 days to hike the wilderness and then summit Mt. Katahdin. We’d prefer not to carry 8 days of food and for a small amount of money the hostel will coordinate a meeting point/date/time to meet to deliver food.  We choose 60 miles into the hike which should be 4 days. We filled our bucket with Gatorade, canned fruit, granola bars, and the other hiker essentials. The driver will take out your garbage, so we are planning on eating the canned fruit and drinking that extra drinks right away. Many hikers are taking 8 days of food but we are happy to pay for this service.  


Today Grasshopper’s cousin Kathy and husband Dave came in to visit us from California!  They also are visiting friends out East and we were delighted that they wanted to see us.  We enjoyed a good lunch and caught up on their lives. We talked about the trail and they had fun meeting other hikers as well as seeing the hostel. Tomorrow they will hike out with us for a small bit of the trail.  Tonight they took us to dinner and surprised us with a gift.  They shared our journal with their friend’s Tom & Denise who live in New Hampshire.  Together they created a plaque with a stone shaped like New Hampshire and added a quote from my journal, “We’ve discovered that hiking in New Hampshire changed everything.”  On the back they added that July is the wettest month in New Hampshire history😳.  I can attest to the fact that it was extremely wet and I’m proud of the fact we survived hiking in New Hampshire.  It is such a kind and thoughtful gift. I’m feeling very blessed right now. (I’ll posted pictures!)


We are packed and ready to head back to the trail tomorrow.  The hostel is full of fellow thru hikers who will head back on that trail toward Katahdin: Sticks, Ranger, Hamlet, Dallas, Hiccup, Prime, Savage, Bess, PB & Jazz, and J-peg.  Everyone is talking about the last 100 miles and are excited but sad to be nearing the  end of our journey. We are ready to finish but want to enjoy the last week of hiking.  It’s likely that I won’t have much cell service moving forward until we summit but I’ll do my best to post when I’m able.  We are shooting for a summit around with August 11 or 12.  I won’t know the exact date until that day before we summit (depends on weather and availability if slots. Only 12 spots given per day to summit)

Shaw’s Hostel makes an incredible hiker breakfast: three eggs, four pieces of bacon, home fries and blueberry pancakes. After eating we headed to the trail with Grasshopper’s cousins Kathy & Dave. They hiked with us for a mile and then turned back as we hiked on. It was fun catching up with them and sharing trail stories. 


The terrain was varied and we had smaller climbs throughout the day.  We forded one stream, walked by two picturesque lakes, walked around a beaver dam, and tonight are sleeping next to Long Pond Stream at mile 2093 after hiking 15 miles. Sticks & Ranger, Bess, PB & Jazz, Nick & Jazymn are camping with us tonight.  We soaked our feet in the stream and ate dinner on the rocks. We joked that we were drinking fancy drinks at a speciality resort as we soaked our feet.  


In the morning we have a huge climb (4 miles of climbing) and then a day of ups & downs. The climbing will be put hardest day until we climb Mt. Katahdin.  We are hoping to hike 16 miles tomorrow and keep on pace to summit on August 11 or 12.  


It was a good day and I’m off to bed early so that I can rest up for the climbs tomorrow.

Blessings - sleeping next to a stream!  And eating fresh peaches on the trail(thanks to Kathy & Dave).  All the hikers were super jealous of the fresh peaches.

We woke up early and were on the trail by 6am.  It’s a big climbing day, lots of ups & downs over 5 smaller mountains (4,200’ ascent & 3,600’ descent).  We hiked for 10 hours and finally stopped because we were too tired to make the shelter which is 7 miles away.  


 We crossed the 2100 mark👏. Someone made a marker out of pebbles and ferns. It fun to celebrate small victories on the trail.

Despite raining all night we woke up dry and our hike today was sunny.  We hiked our last big climbs until Mt. Katahdin today. 👏. We had a series of 4 Mountains: Gulf Hagas, West Peak, Hay & White Cap with over 4,500 in ascent and another 4,000 in descent. We covered 18 miles & I’m one tired girl today. 


Tonight we are tenting East Branch Lean To (mile 2125) and Gaget is here with us.  Sticks & Ranger pushed ahead yesterday and we’ve not seen them all day.  A few southbound hikers are at the campsite but it’s early and others will likely still come into camp…Prime & Hiccup just got into camp. We’ve not seen them since we left Monson. 


Blueberries have lined the trail and it’s been fun to stop and pick some berries along the way. Maine has been full of blue berries. 


At camp I’ve gotten good at throwing a line for our bear bags(food). Grasshopper and I divide the camp chores and lately I’ve enjoyed throwing the bear line. 


Today felt like our last big day because of the climbs.  We believe it will be faster and easier terrain from here to Abol Bridge/Baxter State Park. We are starting to feel the end of our hike  ❤️

We woke up early and hiked to meet our food drop. We eat a can of fruit cocktail and drank a beer before the driver left. He took our empties and our garbage. Our resupply felt heavy in our packs and it’s likely we have too much food for the last 4-5 days of hiking. Thankfully, the terrain was Michigan like and the sun was out most of the day. 


At one of the road crossing we were surprised to see Trail Magic: burgers, sausages, fruit, chips, soda and beer. We stopped and enjoyed the food with our trail friends. I even had a beer Baxter Brewing Company, A Couple More Miles IPA.  The food and beer made the last few miles difficult but we spent the time chatting with Gaget along the way. It’s always a good day when you pause for surprises along the trail. 


Today we hiked 16 miles and are staying at the Antler’s Campsite (mile 2141). We thought we’d push further but a storm began to brew and we discovered that we have service at this campsite! It’s now raining but we are dry in our tent. The girls we started the trail with, Emma & Jadyn summited today. It’s so awesome that we were just days apart from each other most of the hike. Our paths would cross on occasion as we hiked and it was always fun to catch up.  It seems like just a few weeks ago we were starting the trail in the rain in Georgia❤️.  I’m super proud of both girls. 


Tomorrow we will get up early and hike 16-20 miles with the goal of summiting on August 11.  If we push and hike more tomorrow the 11th will be more realistic but if we fall short on miles, we will likely summit the 12th. If I have service, I’ll update you on our summit date.

We’ve not seen as much wildlife as we thought we would on the trail. It’s been weeks since we’ve seen a deer and we’ve only seen two moose in Maine. We do see lots of squirrels, chipmunks, frogs and birds.  This morning we heard and then saw a pair of loons on the pond. One of the loons dove into the water to fish and was underwater for about 10 minutes. Other hikers commented that loons can swim underwater for up to 30 minutes. I’m not sure if this is true or not. I have no service right now so I cannot verify using Google. 


Today’s hike felt like a test of strength. We thought it was going to be an easy day but it was actually pretty difficult. The trail provided us with the following tests: small rocks, big rocks, sharp rocks, roots of all sizes, many trees blocking the path requiring us to up or under, fording, rock jumping over streams, board walks, steep climbs, steep descents, leg & lung burning climbs, hiking on a beach, hiking almost entirely around Crescent Pond, and hiking next to a waterfall.  It was a fun and tough hike.  Tonight we are tenting at Rainbow Stream Lean-To (mile 2163) after 22 miles of hiking!  Yep, it was a big mile day too. 


We will leave early in the morning to hike the 15 miles to Abol Bridge/Campsite which is the end of the 100 Mile Wilderness and the start of Baxter State Park. We will secure a place at the Birch’s Campsite for the next night and then we will get permission to summit Mt. Katahdin 👏. The journey of a million plus steps is almost done❤️.

We finished the 100 Mile Wilderness! What a good day. 👏 The miles were easier and we arrived at Abol Bridge by noon but we did stop pick some blueberries along the trail.  There were so many berries and we kept stopping to pick more.  Once we arrived at Abol we were eating  ice cream and socializing with other thru hikers. 


We didn’t realize that Abol is a private campground with laundry & a hot showers.  We were excited to shower after 6 days on that trail. We booked a bunkhouse cabin that had three bunk beds so we invited Sticks, Ranger, Bess, PB& Jazym to share the bunkhouse with us.  We all sat around the picnic table and soon we had an impromptu birthday party.  Sticks was looking at some wine in the camp store and a trail angel bought that wine for me for my birthday.  Then the boys bought beer, chips & salsa; we had a party.  Hiccup, Prime, Nate, Jazymn, J-Peg, Jeff, Chaser, Sticks, Ranger, Bess & PB & Jazym all helped celebrate my 50th birthday. We ended the night standing on Abol Bridge looking at a clouded over Mt. Katahdin. 


We hiked 15 miles today and on the morning we will wake at 5am to stand in line for the chance to summit Katahdin on August 11.  If we get a slot we will hike 10 miles to the Birch’s Campsite and spend that night.  Than early on August 11 we will hike 5.7 miles to the summit of Katahdin.

What a fun day. The trail was beautiful and easy to hike.  We woke up at 5am so that we could get the the Ranger Station at Baxter State Park by 6am.  A queue formed with thru hikers who want to summit Katahdin. Only 12 hikers will get to stay at the Birches Campsite and then summit the next day. We wanted to be one of the 12 so we got to the Ranger Station early & it paid off. We secured a spot for camping tonight at the Birches & will summit early in the morning on August 11. 


After checking in, we hiked 10 AT miles to the campsite. The sun was shining and the trail followed the water and a waterfalls. We took our time and stopped often to chat with other hikers.  At one point the entire group of thru hikers was sitting next to the falls just chilling for an hour or so. It was nice to take our time.


We checked in at Katahdin Stream Campsite and learned that we will be hikers #338 & #339 to summit Mt. Katahdin this year 👏. It’s amazing to think that we are some of the few who actually finish the trail.  It’s a miracle that we survived the trail without any major injuries. We received a card from Baxter State Park which gives us permission to summit. We are two of eight thru hikers who plan on summiting tomorrow.  


We stumbled upon Trail Magic at the campsite. A mother of a thru hiker was serving up burgers, beer, fresh fruit and chips. Her daughter, BeBop, was summiting today and she was waiting for her to come off the mountain. A large group of hikers sat around all afternoon as she served up food. It was fun to greet the hikers as they came down from Katahdin.  Bug’s mom came to pick her up and brought more Trail Magic: carrot cake, cheese, hummus, etc. It was a true feast. 


I truthfully was nervous about climbing Katahdin. I was worried that it would be too much or that the weather would turn bad making the extreme rock scramble impossible. It seems like our fears are always worse than reality. It helped talking to the other hikers who summited today. They told me that it’s tough but that it’s nothing we haven’t already done on the trail. 


Tonight we are sleeping at the Birch’s with Rhino, Moser, JPEG, Sticks & Ranger. In the morning we will leave at 5am👏




Blessings -The day was full of blessings!  It was truly a great day.
