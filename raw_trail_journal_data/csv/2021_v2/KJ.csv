KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633842,"If you're looking for another of my journals, they're listed at https://www.trailjournals.com/...My hiking buddies Shoelace and Neon invited me to join them for a short southbound Appalachian Trail (AT) hike in southwestern Virginia. Although I really wanted to do the hike, I've been feeling some trepidation. An injury to my Achilles tendon four months ago has been very slow to heal. As recently as a month ago, I could walk only a couple of miles without pain. I've been steadily increasing the length of my walks and carrying a weighted pack. I'm not in hiking shape, but the short 5-day itinerary with modest daily distances just might be within my ability. 

I parked my car at the Relax Inn this afternoon in Altkins, and Neon drove us in his car to our starting point at VA 608 in Lickskillet Hollow. We hit the trail at 6:00 PM. The rain, which had been falling moderately during our respective drives to Atkins, had stopped. It was a short, pleasant walk to Jenny Knob Shelter. 
We pitched our tents near the shelter, and then we chatted with Michigan Millie and Wicked while we ate dinner. They're hiking together. Michigan Millie is finishing a southbound (SOBO) thru hike that she started last year. Wicked, from Marblehead, MA, is doing a long-ass section hike (LASH).

We said good night as it grew dark. I crawled into my tent at 8:30, and it started raining just minutes later. Perfect timing!

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633898,"It rained most of the night, with thunder and lightning around 2:00 AM. I awoke at 7:00 to find a puddle of water under my sleeping pad in the middle of the tent. Fortunately, my sleeping bag didn't get wet. I couldn't find any apparent puncture in the tent floor or loosening of the seam tape, so the source of the leak remains a mystery. 

Neon's friend White Lightnin' arrived as Neon and I were finishing breakfast. He had slept in his car at the trailhead. He and Neon left around 9:00, I about twenty minutes later. By then the sun had come out and it was a balmy 55 degrees. 

The sky remained clear and bright all day, with a breeze (mostly at our backs) and a high in the mid-60s. I changed into shorts and lollygagged all day, enjoying the sunshine, taking in the views from the ridgeline, and being in absolutely no hurry to cover today's short distance. Near SR 611, a white hat and a fresh floral arrangement served as an unmarked memorial. The hat was dry and spotless, so it couldn't have been there overnight.

I pulled into Helveys Mill Shelter at 2:30, just after Neon and White Lightnin'. Wicked, from last night, had also just arrived. The warm sun and the breeze quickly dried out my tent and damp belongings. 

Also tenting nearby was Sunkist, from Massachusetts. She has been section hiking the AT for the past ten years, and with her current hike will complete the trail. She ate dinner and chatted with us for a while before heading to her tent. She expects to be hiking by 7:00 AM and is heading NOBO, so we probably won't see her again. 

Finally, around 7:00, Shoelace rolled in with his friends Taco Cat and Yardsale. They had just completed their second consecutive 17-mile day. That's an ambitious way to start a hike. We socialized until 9:00, well after dark. 

My Achilles tendon flared up today despite the short distance and leisurely pace. I'm beginning to wonder whether I'll be able to complete this relatively easy, short hike. But I'm not letting that bother me... it has been a great day in the trail!

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633943,"Yesterday's beautiful day was capped by a crystal clear full moon sky last night. Headlamps not required. 

I savored the sunrise from an east-facing seat at the picnic table. Ten minutes later, it felt as if the temperature had climbed ten degrees. Yard Sale fetched water for me--a significant favor since it was a quarter-mile to the stream, one way. It was another slow decamping for me, not hitting the trail until 9:00. I started out at the same time as Shoelace, with only Yard Sale behind us. 

The first two miles were pleasant and mostly downhill to a road. That was followed by more than a mile of uphill road walk, aross I-77 and through the outskirts of Bland. Shoelace, White Lightning, Yard Sale, Neon and I crossed paths several times along the way. 

The sun seemed to disappear just as we reentered the woods. Neon, taking a break, offered me some ""vitamin I"" (ibuprofen) to help reduce the swelling in my Achilles tendon, which had bothered me during the night. It must have helped, because I almost immediately picked up the pace. 

It started raining just before 12:30. I opened my ultralight umbrella and ate my lunch on the move. The rain varied from light to heavy more than an hour of thunderstorms. I was glad this section of trail stabbed the side of a mountain instead of following the ridgeline. 

At 2:30 I pulled into Jenkins Shelter in moderate rain. Yardsale, who had arrived a little earlier, had just started setting up his tent. I left my pack in the shelter and pitched my tent as the rain was starting to taper off. I managed to keep my belongings and the inside of the tent dry. 

Michigan Millie, from Thursday night, was in the shelter, as was Taco Cat, who had arrived an hour and a half earlier. Wicked, Shoelace, Neon, and White Lightnin' arrived between 2:45 and 4:00. We were once again fortunate to have a break in the rain for socializing and dinner. 

The forecast is calling for all-day rain tomorrow, with an inch of accumulation. Our initial plan was to camp at Chestnut Knob Shelter, but spending a cold, wet night on an exposed bald at 4,300' doesn't sound appealing to any of us. We all agreed to hike beyond that point so we can sleep at a lower, presumably warmer, location tomorrow night.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634043,"It rained hard most of the night, with frequent thunder and lightning. There was a short respite just before dawn so I got up and packed most of my gear in the dark. I struggled to untie a clove hitch in the thoroughly-soaked paracord that was holding my food bag in a PCT hang. Eventually i discovered that the screwdriver/nail file in my backpacking knife makes a serviceable marlinspike.

Shoelace had packed his tent, but his tarp was still up when it started raining again at dawn. I carried my freestanding tent (Big Agnes Copper Spur UL-1) to the shelter of his tarp to make it a little easier to pack it without getting the inside any wetter than it already was. 

I headed out with White Lightnin' around 8:00 as Shoelace was finishing breakfast. Taco Cat and Yardsale had left earlier, planning to hike 22 miles to a hostel. They'll meet us at the Crawfish Trail campsite tomorrow night. White Lightnin', Neon, Shoelace, and I planned to stop at a campsite just across Lick Creek, about 17 miles away. The footbridge across Lick Creek had been washed away last year, so we'd need to ford the creek. We figured it would be better to do the ford at the end of a rainy day when we were already wet and had dry sleeping bags to crawl into afterwards. A NOBO hiker told us it had been shin deep yesterday morning, before the rain. 

The hike from Jenkins shelter began with a 1400' climb. Grateful for my backpacking umbrella, I warmed up and started removing layers as I climbed. At one point I was wearing rain pants, a T-shirt, GoreTex shell mittens, and an umbrella. I'm sure I looked weird, but I felt quite comfortable. In fact, I was thoroughly enjoying myself in spite of the weather. There weren't many other hikers out on this rainy Sunday, and I felt very much at home in the wilderness.

The temperature dropped through the day, the rain continued, and the wind picked up. By noon, I was adding layers. Just before I reached Chestnut Knob Shelter at 1:30, a gust of wind broke my umbrella. Chestnut Knob Shelter is a stone building with a door, and it provided a welcome break from the wind and rain. As I was eating second lunch and examining the damage to my umbrella, a very fit-looking NOBO hiker arrived. He showed me a video he had taken this morning of his hiking partner crossing Lick Creek. The water was chest-deep and flowing fast. The video showed his partner holding on tightly with both hands to a rope stretched across the creek. When his partner arrived a few minutes later, he said that it had taken a lot of strength just to hold on to the rope. Neither could remember seeing a usable campsite on either side of the creek. This didn't bode well for our original plan. 

With no sign of Shoelace, Neon, or White Lightnin', I left the shelter hoping for more clement weather at lower elevations. I was relieved to reach the tree line after walking a mile or two into driving rain on the open bald of Chestnut Ridge. The rain tapered off as I descended, and I noticed a village of miniature gnome figurines next to a stream. It seemed like a good place to stop for water. As I was filtering, the sun came out for five minutes. Nearby, I came across a campsite that had ample flat spaces for all our tents. It was only 3:30, the sun had disappeared again, and it was getting colder, so I decided to continue down to Lick Creek to check out the situation first-hand. 
A mile before Lick Creek, I stopped at an unnamed stream. A photo in the Guthook app showed a mere trickle, but today it was knee-deep and flowing fast. My feet had warmed up and my socks had stopped squishing, and I wasn't tempted to get cold and wetter again. I was pretty sure our group wouldn't cross Lick Creek anyway, so I turned around and head back up toward the campsite near the gnome village. Just before reaching the campsite, I crossed Shoelace coming down the trail. He seemed relieved I hadn't attempted to cross Lick Creek. We walked to the campsite and set up our tents. 
I had inflated my pad and spread out my sleeping bag when Neon appeared at 5:00, not with White Lightnin' as I expected, but with Michigan Millie. White Lightnin' had developed GI issues and had decided to spend the night in the stone shelter at Chestnut Knob. (There's a privy outside the shelter.) Neon had felt regret leaving him behind, but White Lightnin' had cell service at the shelter. He wouldn't be alone, as Wicked had also decided to overnight there. There was good news, too: Michigan Millie had arranged for a shuttle to pick us up at 6:00 on VA 625, just 0.8 mile from where we were. Shoelace and I re-packed our gear, and we all walked down to the road together. 
6:00 came and went, then 6:30. We were getting chilled from standing around as the temperature dropped. At 7:00, we concluded the shuttle wasn't coming, so we scouted for level, unflooded ground suitable for tenting. We dispersed, and I found a spot in a rhododendron thicket where there seemed to be less wind. After eating, we conferred and decided to start walking down VA 625 toward civilization at 8:30 tomorrow morning. I crawled into my sleeping bag cold and tired.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634048,"It was clear and cold last night. Neon's thermometer registered 32 degrees outside his tent this morning. I was glad to have camped out of the wind.
Water flow in the ditches and streams nearby had abated overnight, but only a little. We didn't need to visit Lick Creek to know that fording it would still be dangerous. At 8:30, Neon and Michigan Millie set out on VA 625 toward the nearest paved road, eight miles away. Shoelace and I followed ten or fifteen minutes later. The gravel road was well graded and the walking was easy. 
On a rise, Shoelace and Michigan Millie found cell service. Yesterday's shuttle driver, Bubba, texted Michigan Millie that he had waited an hour at the wrong trailhead; this morning he told Neon that he wasn't doing any more shuttling until his doctor cleared him to do so. Michigan Millie called a different shuttle. This driver, Donny Duck, said he was taking another hiker to his car. While she was giving Donny our coordinates, she heard a familiar voice. At that moment, Donny was driving White Lightnin' to his car at Lickskillet Hollow. An amazing coincidence! It was reassuring to learn that White Lightnin' was safe and was headed home. Donny told us to expect him in an hour. Shoelace texted Taco Cat to advise him of our situation and ask him to wait for us at the hostel.
Although we had a ride coming, we decided to keep walking on the gravel road, in part to feel we were making progress, but mostly to stay warm. The sun was shining, the sky was blue, and the air was dry, but a light breeze was blowing and it was still chilly. It turned out be one of the prettiest road walks I've done. Forest scenes were accented with streams, ponds, pastures, and some modest but remarkably well-maintained clusters of vacation cabins. We walked and chatted, enjoying the scenery and the company. At the four mile mark, a large tree had fallen across the road, completely blocking vehicular access. More than an hour had passed and there was no sign of Donny. As we were regrouping beside the fallen tree, an SUV pulled up. It wasn't Donny, but it was the owner of Bear Garden Hostel, where Taco Cat and Yardsale were awaiting us. We negotiated a price, masked up, and climbed in for a ride to the hostel. As we were driving down VA 625, a pickup truck came speeding toward us. It was Donny, who apologized for being late, and who appreciatively accepted a $20 bill from Neon for his trouble. 
Reunited with the rest of our group at the hostel, we conferred about what to do. Michigan Millie opted to shower and launder her clothes before continuing on her thru-hike. Neon, Shoelace, Taco Cat, and Yard Sale all decided to shuttle to their cars. The arrangements were such that I had no shuttling duties. With the AT at hand it seemed wasteful to spend a beautiful afternoon in a car. I had come to VA to hike, and I had no reason not to. Hostel owner Bert offered to drive me to the trailhead, saving me a 1.5-mile walk on the shoulder of a busy road. I wished my friends happy trails and hopped into her car. The hike to Atkins was shorter than I expected, due to my misunderstanding of where she would drop me. The walk was delightful on this cool, crisp day. The weather had been lousy the last time I hiked this section, which helped me appreciate the scenery even more. At 3:30, I arrived at our planned campsite, Crawfish Trail. It was a pretty spot to camp beside a stream, but it was too early to stop for the night. I still had legs and plenty of daylight so I continued on. My injured Achilles tendon wasn't happy about the last climb, but it held on for the last few miles. I gobbled some extra snack food while I was walking so I wouldn't bonk, and I reached my car at 6:30. The innkeeper handed me two jars of homemade spaghetti sauce that Shoelace had left with her earlier. I changed into dry socks and shoes, started my car, and headed for home... tired and happy.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634094,"For a relatively short hike, this one had a full share of adventure. I'm extremely pleased and more than a little surprised that my injured Achilles tendon held up as well as it did. It was great fun to reconnect with my hiking friends Shoelace and Neon. I enjoyed meeting White Lightnin' and Yardsale for the first time, and doing a little hiking with Taco Cat. (We had met briefly a few years ago but hadn't hiked together.) In spite of the obstacles we encountered, everything turned out well in the end. The coincidences on our last day (White Lightning in the shuttle, SUV pulling up just as we reached the downed tree) were remarkable. It's an overused cliché, but the Trail does provide.",,View Entry,"Mar 31, Wed",0
