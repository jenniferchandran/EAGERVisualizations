G,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635806,"I attempted a Thru Hike in 2020 but COVID got in the way.  After 9 days and 109 trail miles (118 with the approach trail), the ATC asked hikers to leave the trail and go home.  After some thought, I decided leaving the trail was the best thing to do.  It was very disappointing after all the training and working out to get ready.  But, on the bright side, only 1 family member got COVID and recovered.  Others were not so lucky. Now I am fully vaccinated and can feel confident around everyone.I did do some additional hiking in 2020.  The Colorado Trail (CT) in July and some AT in MD and PA in October.
Fast forward to 2021 and I am again ready to hike.  Just not a thru hike.  I will pick up where I left off and hike until I have had enough or Harpers Ferry, WV.  There is a certain amount of psyching up that has to take place to do a thru and I just don't have that again.  I may try a thru in the future, but not in 2021.
I've reduced pack weight, worked out hard at the gym and am ready to go.  I will be one of the old guys out there at 57 but I tend to be one of the faster hikers.  Hopefully things will go well and I will reach my goal. 
See you on the trail.

I was up at 4am for my flight at 6. Both flights were on time and I arrived in Asheville just as my shuttle driver Nate “Zach Galifinakis” arrived. We had a good discussion during the hour drive to the gap just past Franklin, NC. I would recommend him if you need a ride in the Asheville area. 
I got started hiking at 1123 and planned on an 11 mile day. Of course, coming out of a gap it’s all up.   There were some views but it was mostly cloudy. I went to Siler Bald Shelter to have a quick lunch then moved on. The balds in this area are mountains that are partially or totally bare of trees. There is mixed scientific opinion if they were cleared long ago for grazing or occur naturally. Either way, they are interesting and provide great views from the top. 
The next stop was Wayah Bald. But just before the summit I visited with the resident gnome (see photo). At Wayah Bald there is a stone tower that provides great long range views. From there it was about 1 mile down to my camp for the night at Wayah Shelter. I arrived at the shelter area at about 515. There are a few other hikers here. Most are thru hikers and all have been friendly.  Dinner was a pork jambalaya meal. 
Overall it was a good day. I got to where I planned with no injuries or issues. The weather was good and looks to remain that way for a few days
Until tomorrow.","Winding Stair Gap

It’s cold in the mountains on a clear night at 4500 feet. Probably about 40 at sunrise. Surprisingly I slept OK last night. I don’t tend to sleep well the first few nights out when hiking. I was moving by 615, took care of camp chores, packed up and on the trail by 740. With almost 15 hours of daylight I don’t need to hurry in the mornings. 
From the shelter the trail was . . . flat and easy for about 2 miles. That is rare for the southern end of the AT. Finally there was a moderate climb to Cold Springs Shelter where I refilled my water bottles. The spring had a pipe and was right next to the shelter.  From there it was a long descent into Tellico Gap where I had some snacks. 
Next was an 800 ft climb to the Wesser fire tower. Today was clear and calm and the views were spectacular. Few clouds or any haziness.  Leaving the tower it is 5.7 miles mostly downhill to tonight’s camp. I had heard this section of trail was very difficult and is known to ruin knees. There were a few steep rocky parts but I didn’t think it lived up to the difficult billing.
I got to camp about 420. I thought about going on, but it’s only day 2 and there will be plenty of opportunities to push the miles. I had a Mountain House meal of chicken fried rice. It was OK. My son makes a version that is better but he doesn’t deliver here. 
Tomorrow’s plan is to go down into the NOC and see what’s there. Then climb for about 8 miles. Assuming the climb doesn’t kill me I plan to make it to Sweetwater Gap at 15.7 miles. The guide says there are some tent spots there  
Overall today was excellent. The great weather doesn’t hurt.

A loooonnnnggg day. Didn’t sleep so well but did get a few hours in. Started breaking down camp at about 7, enjoyed 2 packs of Pop Tarts and left by 8. The plan was to get to a gap that may have camping spots. But that’s why they are plans and not reality. 
The trail started out with an easy .8 miles down into the NOC at 1727 feet. This is a large kayaking, rafting, and outdoor adventure area on the Nantahala River. Unfortunately I was there before anything opened and I did not need any supplies so I moved on. From the NOC the trail heads west and climbs for about 7 miles. Some steep and some not so steep. But it keeps climbing. I stopped in at Sassafras Gap Shelter for lunch then did the final 800 feet to the summit of Cheoah Bald at 5052 feet by 1pm. The trail then is mostly down to Stecoah Gap at 3127 feet. 
From this gap I had planned to stop early at Sweetwater Gap. The guide and comments implied there was space for tenting. I was tired and my legs were done by this point.  When I got there it was obvious I was not staying. There was nowhere to set up a tent. Now what to do?  It’s 1.4 miles to the next shelter. Not far at 530. However, there is an 800 foot climb in .5 miles. A local passed me at the start and said this straight up climb is called Jacobs Ladder. It was a brutal way to end the day. But I made it by taking 20 steps at a time then resting. 
The shelter is not the best. I prefer to tent but there is no flat ground. So the shelter it is with 4 other folks. It is supposed to get into the upper 30s tonight. We’ll see how the mice and snorers do tonight.
Tomorrow I am only going 5.4 miles where I will tent in a person’s yard. They will pick me up from a road, wash my clothes, take me into town to resupply, I can take a shower and they will return me to the trail in the morning. All for $20. 
Today there was about 5700 feet up and 4300 feet down. Tough day.

The first reason I prefer not to sleep in the shelters is because there tend to be mice in and around those shelters. Last night there were no mice but there was an axman who had a very loud and large chainsaw. What he really needed was some good oil and lubrication to quiet down that chainsaw. I have never heard snoring that loud. I did eventually get to sleep but only for a few hours so I  will try hard to avoid sleeping in the shelters and go with the tent.
I got going this morning later than normal because I only had 5 miles to go. Such a short day makes this a Nearly Zero (NERO) day. I left camp at approximately 915 this morning. The trail overall was very good, smooth, good grade with few rocks or roots and I arrived at Yellow Creek Gap Road at about 1145. There was one good spot with views into the Smokies. Unfortunately my ride is not going to arrive until about 1 o’clock so I’ll work on this journal until then and eat some more food out of my food bag. I’ll also put together a resupply list. It will be interesting to see if I come close to it. 
I was picked up right on time  brought into Robbinsville for resupply, lunch and to go dinner.  I should have enough food to get through the Smokies.  
Tomorrow’s plan is to leave as early as possible from the home where I’m staying tonight and get into the Smokey mountains. In the Smokies you must stay at designated campsites or shelters. There is a campsite approximately 14 miles from my starting point tomorrow. That will be the goal. We’ll see how that goes.

I’m back. Not much cell coverage in the Smokies and when I did it was cold and rainy. Last nights stay At Creekside Paradise worked out very well. Their house was very nice, set out in the woods with plenty of space for me to tent. There was another couple there who sat out by the fire pit but I had no problem falling asleep with the sound of the creek rushing by. Cynthia and Jeff were excellent hosts and I would recommend this establishment to future hikers. Additionally, I was able to get a good nights sleep which hasn’t happened yet on this trip. That extra sleep paid off greatly today. They had me back to yellow Creek gap Road by 7:45 and I was on the trail shortly after.
Today’s hike was really two separate hikes. It was the park before Fontana Dam and the part after the dam in the Smokey Mountains. There was a long climb right to start but it wasn’t that difficult. The trail was clear of rocks and roots which made the going much easier. Once I made the crest it was downhill for a few miles to the famous Fontana Hilton Shelter. I thought I would get some good views of the dam on the way down but the trees are leafing out quickly now. This Hilton is quite the set up. It can sleep up to 20 people inside (with snorers?), has space for plenty of tents, has running water, and it even has a charging port for phones. At the Hilton I had some lunch and snacks and filled up my water bottles ready to go for the big climb in the Smokies.
To get to the Smokies you first have to do some road walking. That leads down to the Fontana dam. This dam is somewhat famous in that it provided jobs in the 40s to a very depressed area. It also provided electricity to this area of North Carolina which did not have any electricity at that time. Overall it was a win-win for both the workers and the residents of this area. The dam itself is quite long it took a while to get across. After getting across the trail turns to the right and follows a road up to the actual trail head entrance into the Smokies. At this point it’s up and up and up. Similar to the climb out of the NOC this climb in the Smokies is somewhat notorious for being incredibly difficult. Like the climb out of the NOC I did not find this climb to be all that difficult. It did get my lungs going, though. It was hard and it was slow going but it was very bearable. Just before the end of the initial climb a hiker pointed out a mama bear with 3 Cubs.  They were about 100 yards away. I saw a black thing moving around. We’ll call it a bear. Once you reach the first summit and go along a Ridgeline you then go up steeply to reach a fire tower called Shuckstack. There were a few people hanging around the fire tower snacking and commenting on the poor condition of this fire tower. It appears it has not been used in an official manner in quite some time. I walked this far, so I was going to see what the view was like from the top of the tower. It was worth the climb up the tower, however, the tower floor at the summit leaves a lot to be desired. Also when I reached the top the wind begin gusting which caused the windows in the tower to pivot. If I hadn’t been paying attention I may have been hit by one of those moving windows. After a few pictures it was time to go back down. From there it was a few miles along the rolling Ridge line with minor ups and downs to reach a campground area. I considered going on to the next shelter however with rain in the forecast, it was best to stay put. That made for a 14 mile day and it was overall a pretty good day. I feel good so far with only normal muscle tightness. 
So far on this trip I have had fantastic weather with almost 5 full days of hazy sunshine. I knew that my luck was going to run out and it finally did. While I am dictating this post in my tent the rains have begun. It’s not too hard yet but the potential is there for heavy thunderstorms later. I am also seeing that I am not in the best camp spot as I am sort of in a low spot and I hope it doesn’t flood. Only time will tell. Additionally the winds are supposed to begin gusting tonight up to 30 miles an hour. Wonderful.
Tomorrow’s goal is to get Derek Knob Shelter which is about 17.5 miles away. The terrain does not look that tough and it probably just runs along the ridge line of the Smokies.

Both of my camp predictions yesterday came true. The heavy rains did indeed come. It rained hard for at least two hours. And, my tent was not in a good spot. It was a built up tent pad but had a low spot that allowed the water coming off the hill to flow under my tent. Once set up and pouring there was not much I could do about it. The new tent (ZPacks Duplex) did very well and I stayed dry all night except for a light spray coming in. Under the tent and my ground sheet were a muddy mess. I scraped off what I could but probably ended up carrying an extra pound of dirt, mud and water today. 
I was up early today. The camp area had a lot of tents and I was certain the next shelter was probably going to be full. All those hikers may want to get to the same place I did. That meant I may have trouble getting a tent spot. Also, it was over 17 miles so an early start was needed. I was packed up and hiking by 720. The weather was foggy and wet but only a few light showers. I had 2 packs of Pop Tarts in my pocket for breakfast on the go. Right off the bat was a steep climb for almost 1000 feet. It then dropped back down where I was able to top off my water bottles. Then right back up again where I would snack at one of 3 shelters I would pass today. I think the shelters in the Smokies are closer than usual on the AT because you have to stay at them. Elsewhere on the AT you can setup your camp anywhere. 
This shelter/snack routine happened 2 more times today. 
After the third shelter, I climbed the famous Rocky Top. Nothing against Tennessee or people from Tennessee, but Rocky Top is a nothing summit. Maybe if it was clear it would have good views, but it just doesn’t justify a college fight song. I doubt many Tennesseans have even been there. 
Next up was Thunderhead Mountain. Sounds big and tough. Worse than Rocky Top since it is overgrown so you would never have a view. 
The last part of the day was a series of steep up and downs. It was the end of the day and I was tired. I made it to the shelter at about 530. First I needed to get my ground sheet out and tent set up to dry. It turns out the shelter is not that crowded. I could have stayed in the shelter but after my experience a few nights ago, tenting it is. Maybe when the weather is bad I’ll opt for the shelter. 
One thing I noticed today. All of the trail in the Smokies up to Rocky Top has water diverters in the trail often. These force the water as if runs downhill to leave the trail and cause less erosion to the trail. After Rocky Top there were hardly any diverters and the trail was grossly eroded, rocky and rutted. Maybe it has to do with the trail maintenance group responsible for those sections are 2 rather than 1. It don’t know, just an observation. 
Tomorrow I plan to go a short 13 miles to Mt. Collins Shelter or 18 miles to Newfound Gap. The gap is the road the bisects the park and leads to Gatlinburg. I have no desire or need to go there. 13 miles may be too short but the shelter after that is at 21 miles. I will also go over Clingman’s Dome tomorrow, the highest point on the AT.

Today was a tough but rewarding day. The miles were lower than hoped for but that is due to shelter distance and no desire to go into Gatlinburg. I got camp packed up quickly, had a couple of oatmeal packets and hit the trail. The weather was great from the beginning with just some thin clouds and cool temperatures. 
The trail started off easy then got tougher through the day. It was mostly walking in the trees so views were limited to start. Then some climbing began. Sometimes steep. I made it the 5.7 miles to Silers Bald Shelter by 10. Had a snack and moved on. Next up was a short stretch to Double Spring Gap Shelter where I topped off my water bottles. Next up was a 1200 foot steep climb to Clingman’s Dome. It was tough and some of the steep sections were quite steep. I arrived there at about 1. When you get close to the top the tourist numbers begin increasing. When you pop out onto the path to the summit spaceship tower it’s a zoo. Since I walked 91 miles to get here, I was going to the top. The views were great and the air was clear even with the clouds. Snapped a few pictures and got down from the tower. I chatted with a ranger and some other hikers then headed out. 
The trail down from Clingman’s was treacherous. Very rocky, rooty and eroded. I finally made it to the side trail to Mt. Collins Shelter and had to decide what to do. It was .4 miles to the shelter that don’t count as trail miles. It was 8.3 miles to the next shelter. And Gatlinburg was out. I didn’t think I could make 8 more miles, and that ranger I spoke to said the next shelter, Icewater Springs, is the busiest in the park due to its proximity to Newfound Gap. I chose to stay. It’s a small group here tonight. Probably due to the distance from the trail. It is supposed to get down to the upper 30s tonight. It’s before 7 and most hikers are settling in.

Today was wet!  I got up to pee at about 1am and the sky was crystal clear with stars. By 4am it was raining. I was up early and decided to quickly pack up, eat a pop tart and go. I was on the .4 mile shelter trail by 730 in the rain. The rain wasn’t heavy and soon became a mist that gathered on the trees and dripped on me all day. The trail was a shallow creek in many places. However, hiking in the misty rain was enjoyable. The downside was there was nothing to see today. 
The first stop was Newfound Gap. On a nice day it’s a crazy place with tourists. Today there were 8 or 10 cars and few people around. I went in to the bathroom to warm up and have a snack. Then headed on. Next up was Icewater Spring Shelter where I had lunch. Finally, a long stretch to my destination, Peck’s Corner Shelter. In this stretch, the trail ran along the ridge line and was only as wide as the trail in some spots. Due to everything being wet I am staying in the shelter again. While cooking dinner I totally screwed up and spilled my cook pot with my food. This was doubly bad in that I now had a cold dinner and I had to clean up the mess so as not attract bears. And, I sliced my finger cutting salami, just for good measure. I crossed the grate in today’s photo somewhere in the afternoon.  This is to keep the wild pigs out of the fenced area. They destroy the areas they dig in and this area has trees only found in this area.
Tomorrow should be interesting. The shelter I would have wanted to stay at is closed due to bear activity. Therefore I will need to go 20.3 miles tomorrow. That will get me in late and may have to tent. Hopefully the weather is nice and things dry out a bit.

It got cold last night. Down to around 35. I really did not sleep well due to the cold. Live and learn and pack better next time. Today, the weather was perfect for hiking. Cool, clear and dry. 
I knew today was going to be a long day so I got going early. I was on trail by 725. First I had to do the .4 miles up back to the trail. As usual it was up coming out of the shelter. The first part of the day was a series of long ups and downs. I made great time except avoiding some of the muddy areas. I took a snack break at TriCorner Knob Shelter and spoke to the ridge runner. These are people paid to check on the trail, hikers and facilities. She had some good information and answered all my questions. Throughout the morning there were a lot of good long range views. Finally around noon I reached the high point of the day near Mt. Guyot at 6239 feet. The rest of the day was spent working my way down to my camp for the night at 2579 feet. 
Unfortunately Cosby Knob Shelter is still closed due to aggressive bear activity. So on to Davenport Shelter it would be. On a the way down is one more rise where a side trail to the Mt. Cammerer Lookout Tower. This is a .6 mile side trail to an old structure for fire spotting. The views were 360 degree and great. I’m glad I went. Yesterday, due to the rain and fog I passed on a Charlies Bunion, a large rock outcrop with great views.
After Cammerer it was 4 miles all downhill. The first 2 miles were very rocky and I ended up with a blister. I’ll deal with it in the morning. The last 2 miles were clear and quick. Surprisingly, there was room in the shelter when I arrived but now it is packed. Plus a couple of stoned women who are loud and obnoxious. 
Tomorrow I leave the park the get my resupply box. Hot Springs, NC in a few days.

Davenport Gap Shelter is an interesting shelter. There is a chain link fence on the front. You would think that’s to keep the bears out. But, maybe the bears installed it to keep the humans in. Either way, no up close bear sightings in the Smokies. I did see a rabbit the other day. In all honesty, it has been unseasonably cold in this area and the animals may be struggling with what to do because of the cold 
The shelter was full last night; like sardines. There is a gate in the chain fence you have to open to go out once closed and latched. The gate is very noisy. Once the middle of the night pee trips started good sleep was not going to happen. 
People started to pack up around 6 and I followed suit. It’s tough to deflate an air mattress quietly. I had a couple of oatmeal packets, topped off my water and headed out at 710. From the shelter it is downhill for about 3.5 miles to the Pigeon River. On the way I passed through Davenport Gap and dropped the 2nd half of my permit in the box. 
As I was reading the news on the bridge, another hiker (I forgot his name) came by and we walked together up the hill to the I-40 underpass. We then followed the dirt road around to the right and up the hill towards Standing Bear Farm Hostel. We then realized we had not seen a white blaze in a while. While we were talking, we missed the turn into the woods. The road met the trail again in a short time so we just stayed on the road to the hostel. 
I had my resupply box at the hostel. The hostel has a very 70s hippy vibe about it. Everyone was nice and accommodating. I dumped my trash and other junk, packed up my food, gave away unneeded food, and charged my electronics. Payment for store items is on the honor system. Finally, at about 1015 I decided it was time to move on or I would get sucked into staying. 
The bulk of today’s hiking was long steep uphills. The first was up to Snowbird Peak. This was a 2500 foot climb over 4.5 miles that took about 3.5 hours. My trail guide had a comment about a power outlet near the summit. It was right and I charged some more while eating lunch.   I think the USB plug I use is just a trickle as it is very slow. At the top of Snowbird there is an FAA communication building that looks like an alien ship. From there it was a long down to Deep Gap. I sat for a bit and took my shoes and socks off to let my feet air out. Still just the one blister from yesterday. From the gap it was mostly uphill for 6.5 miles to my destination for tonight, Max Patch. This is a bald mountain that is very popular with the locals. There are about 100 people here to watch the sunset and maybe 30 tents. The sunset was nice. The views of the nearby towns is incredible. It is a bit cold but the wind has died down. Might get to 40 tonight. 
I have a reservation for a hostel on Sunday in Hot Springs. A bed should be nice. I also need to eat as much as possible as I feel like I am dropping weight fast. I only need to go 20 miles in 2 days so I can (will I?) take my time. 
One more thought on the Smokey Mountains and their hiking rules. I think my past comments were somewhat negative about the rules that hikers had to stay in designated sites. No hiker likes that rule but I totally understand the need for it. With the huge number of hikers on the AT and the hundreds of miles of other trails, if the rules were not there the trails would quickly become lined with toilet paper and garbage piles. These rules force the human impact to small manageable areas. I did enjoy the hiking in the Smokies but am glad to be out and free to camp when and where I want.

Max Patch was cold and quiet last night. People were stirring before 6am to watch the sunrise. I got out of my tent a few minutes after 6 to view it also. It was pretty spectacular as it came over the mountains. After that I ate some Pop Tarts, packed up camp and headed on. 
Today’s walking was along well graded and maintained trail. Few rock or root areas. First was a gradual 5 mile downhill to Lemon Gap. More of a trailhead for day hikers. I had a snack and talked to a day hiker for a while who had lots of questions about long distance hiking. From there it was up for 700 feet to Walnut Mountain Shelter. This was a very rundown place I am glad I did not stay at. I had a tortilla with peanut butter for lunch and moved on. Then it was down for 600 feet only to be followed by a 1000 foot climb up Bluff Mountain. No views from this mountain so I headed for the descent. This down was long and hard on the feet. Down 2200 feet and it seemed like it would never end. Finally there were some rolling ups and downs to my camp for the night. 
There were few things to see today. That’s just how it goes some days. I am now camped far away from the shelter down by the creek. There is some sort of youth group tenting near me so it could be a loud night. 
Tomorrow I go into Hot Springs. It’s only 2.7 trail miles to the hostel. I will shower, wash my clothes and eat as much as possible. I know I need more calories.

Slept well last night down by the creek. A hiker I’ve been seeing a lot, Sven, camped nearby. The youth group was ok at night but in the morning when they needed to get water they had to loudly discuss everything that transpired last night. Luckily I was awake so it didn’t matter. 
It was a quick 3 mile walk mostly down to Laughing Heart Hostel which is right on the trail when you pop out of the woods. Check in is not until 11 so I’m just hanging out at a table. 
The hostel is nice. Got a shower and cleaned my clothes. Both needed a good cleaning. I then headed to town with Sven for food and beer. We ended up at Big Pillow Brewing which also had a taqueria next door. Both were good. I may go back into town later for some dinner. 
So I did go back for more food and beer at the Spring Creek Tavern. I had the catfish tacos which were good and a couple of local NC beers. I was joined by Sven, Odie and Garfield. Bruiser, the guy whose name I forgot the other day, also joined us. It was a good time and good hiking conversation. 
I hope to get up early tomorrow and eat breakfast at the Smoky Mountain Diner then head out to the trail. The restaurant is actually on the trail as it runs right down the Main Street in Hot Springs. My first goal is 11 miles. After that there does not seem to be much until the next shelter at almost 20 miles. That may be too far. We’ll see.

I got a Greek omelette with home fries and a biscuit. While waiting for my order Bruiser came in. We talked while we ate then it was time to move on. 
I wasn’t sure how far I would get today. The first shelter was only 11 miles and with the early start that would not work. The second was 20. Maybe too far. Once out of town the trail runs along the French Broad River for a ways. Then it turn up the cliff. This was a tough climb. There were a few good views back into town including one from Lovers Leap. After that I was in the woods all day with no views. I am quite a bit lower now and everything is really green. It sort of pops out in its brightness. I got to the first shelter before 1. I had some lunch and decided to try for the next shelter. There were a couple of long ups and towards the end of the hike I needed more food. I need to be sure to keep more snacks handy. I finally arrived at 530 for my first 20 mile day to on this trip. There are only a few hikers here. There is room in the shelter but I chose to go with the tent. It was calm on arrival but the winds have picked up. We had a good fire going tonight. We’ll see how the tent holds up. 
Tomorrow is like today with regards to shelters and distances. I just have to play it by ear. According to a couple of the hikers here tonight the next section has some good views and some more technical climbing. That should be fun.

Today was a great day for hiking. Slightly overcast, mid 60s, no rain and some views. Last night while sitting around the campfire, a day hiker heading south, Dan (now known as ‘Duct Tape’ because one of his shoes disintegrated and was being held together with duct tape), heard me talking about my fuel being low. I am not sure I would make it to Erwin, TN on that little fuel . He offered me his fuel canister since he has to get a ride to town for new shoes. That was very nice of him and much appreciated. So this morning once he was done cooking I got the canister and went north on my way, leaving the shelter area at about 840, late for me. 
The trail for the most part was terrific today. After the initial 1100 foot climb from camp, it was smooth or gradual inclines/declines with 2 notable exceptions. The first was after 5 miles. There was a very rocky stretch for just under 2 miles around Big Firescald Knob (why isn’t it just a mountain?). This was some tough slow going but fun. The views at the summit were good but hazy.
Next it was on to Jerry Cabin Shelter for lunch. The trail to and from that shelter was covered in pine needles which feel great on the feet. There was a long gradual up from the shelter ending at the top of Big Butt Peak (I don’t make the names). This too was a rock scramble that was challenging. Leaving the Big Butt it was smooth sailing for 5 miles down to Flint Mountain Shelter where I arrived at about 415. I passed an interesting site this afternoon  it’s called the Shelton Graves. It’s the burial site of 2 Union soldiers who were killed on the spot by Confederate soldiers while visiting family during the war.  Out in the middle of nowhere.
This was a bit early for me to stop so I needed a plan. I decided to eat my freeze dried chicken and rice dinner and move on a few miles. I left the shelter at about 520 and got to my campsite partway up tomorrow’s big climb. I am about 100 feet from a creek by myself relaxing while typing up this entry. And to top it off, I passed 200 miles and am right on schedule. I planned 100 miles for each of the first 2 weeks. 
One thing I’ve noticed; I have not been passed by other northbound (NOBO) hikers in 3 days nor have I passed more than 2 NOBO hikers in 3 days. I am at the tail end of the NOBO thru hikers but there were a lot of hikers in Hot Springs. Where did they all go?
Tomorrow’s plan is to get to the top of Big Bald, 14 miles ahead. Mostly uphill. I will try to make Bald Mountain Shelter at 15.3. That would leave me 17 miles, mostly downhill to Erwin. This might be a bit optimistic but I would like to arrive late in the afternoon and stay at the hostel right on trail. They shuttle hikers to town for resupply. Then I can get out early the next morning.

Today was tough. Coming out of camp it was up for almost 1000 feet. And it was very steep. That climb completely drained me. I don’t know if I overdid it yesterday, need to take a day off, or maybe I just need to eat more. With a town stop likely tomorrow, I will be sure to pack more snacks and protein bars. I did not have enough of that kind of food this section. 
There were some good views today. The trail actually heads south for a while today. At one point I could see across the valley to Big Bald, my later destination. It looked very far away through the morning haze. Next was High Rock. This was only fair because you only had a narrow window through the trees to view. 
I stopped in to Hogback Ridge Shelter for an early lunch to see if that would give me some energy. The trail then dropped into Sam’s Gap and under I-26. The climb up out of the gap was long and very steep in spots. Lunch didn’t seem to increase my energy level. Next the trail went through a meadow. At this point my energy seemed to increase. Good thing since I had come all the way around heading north and it was time to climb Big Bald. 
It was slow going for me but I got up the 1000 feet to the top. It is indeed clear at the top and the views are great. I hung out there for 30 minutes, texted home, had some peanut butter and talked to some tourists. It was now time to head to the shelter for the night. 
I am here with one other hiker.  He got quite the fire going. I am in my tent now as the shelter was quite dirty. It’s getting cold fast but the tent stays pretty warm. A few creatures can be heard wandering around. It made a noise therefore it must be Bigfoot. Then it crossed near camp. I was disappointed that it was only a deer. Tomorrow I hope to make it to Erwin, TN and stay at the hostel.

Bigfoot did not get my food bag last night so maybe it really was only a deer. I was up early, packed up, ate, and was walking by 730. Last night was clear and quite cold up high. 
There wasn’t much to see today as I proceeded to lower elevation and the trees have really filled in. It was also very warm in the sun  Spring has arrived at lower elevations.
A few miles in I almost had a big problem. I had just gotten past the summit of High Rocks, a rock outcrop with a view, I chose to not visit. On the way down a long step off a rock I placed my foot into an unseen hole that was filled with leaves. My ankle turned hard like a high ankle sprain. It even sounded bad. I thought I was done. But, after a few minutes I got recomposed and realized it would be ok. A couple of Ibuprofen and crisis averted. 
The trail continued mostly downhill throughout the day. I had more energy today as well. I think the tough up to start yesterday may have been the issue. I stopped at the No Business Knob Shelter for lunch and finished off everything except my emergency instant potatoes. An hour later I called the hostel to reserve a bunk. A resupply/dinner run was at 430. That meant I had 2.5 hours to go 5.4 miles to make it. Challenge accepted. It was mostly downhill and no views until the Nolichucky River. I made it with time to spare. 
The hostel only gets a fair from me. First, the hot water is out. They should have told me when I called or when I was handed a towel. Second, it’s pretty dirty overall. The location is right next to the trail. I got my resupply done and have too much food. I shouldn’t have low energy from lack of food. 
Tomorrow’s plan is to settle my tab when they open at 830 and hope to get to Unaka Mountain to camp. It’s a long way up.

My thoughts on the hostel did not change overnight. It is very convenient and the people running it are nice, but it needs some work and a good cleaning. Another washer and dryer would help as well. The office didn’t open until 830 which is late for me. I ate my super high calorie cinnamon thing from Walmart and a package of Pop Tarts and waited. I had no room in my food bag so I left the remaining Pop Tarts, some peanut M&Ms and the remaining cinnamon roll things for other hikers. When the office opened I got right in and paid my tab and was on my way. I weighed my pack, now that it was fully loaded, and it came in at 25 pounds. That’s great with all the food I had. I was expecting 30 because that’s what it feels like. 
One more thought on hostels that is just my observation. They seem to be a black hole for many thru hikers. Everything is easy at them. There’s easy food, drinks, no work, etc. Many hikers have a hard time leaving. I realize every hiker has to hike your own hike (HYOH) but if you are going to make it to Katahdin by October 15 when it closes, taking 3 or 4 zero days at each hostel won’t work for most. The hikers at Uncle Johnny’s that had taken multiple zeroes are the ones, at least to me, that can least afford to lose hiking days. 
So, as usual, leaving town is an up. Today’s up out of Erwin was pretty tough for the first 2 miles. It was steep and ran along a nice creek for a good part of the climb. It was only 4.4 miles to the first shelter of the day. I stopped to rest and eat the apple I packed out. 
From there it was a steady ascent until a dip into Indian Grave Gap. At this road there were some hikers I’d seen at the hostel. They were doing a 20 mile southbound (SOBO) slack pack hike today. Slack packing is where you get a ride out somewhere down trail with just a day pack of essentials. This lighter load allows you to move much quicker enabling higher miles hiked. You then end up back at the place you’re staying for another night. It works for the hikers and the place of lodging. In talking to these hikers I learned that water would be sparse for some miles. They offered to let me have some of theirs since they would get some in 2 miles. I accepted. That was very nice of them. Trail magic just when I needed it. I ate some jerky and M&Ms and started the climb. 
The next stop would be Beauty Spot, another bald mountain. The climb was about 1100 feet and very hot. The trail is on the south side of the mountain and had few trees. The extra water was welcome and needed. The views at the top were good but not as good as past balds. Next up was a dip down then another 1100 foot climb up Unaka Mountain. But at the bottom of the dip there was a small spring where I could again top off my water. Unaka was also tough but I think my lungs are getting better at the climbs. Most forests are hemlock (I think) in this area. At the top of Unaka it was a dark mossy pine forest. I was expecting elves and nymphs to be wandering about thinking I was Frodo Baggins or Samwise Gamgee. I stopped for a snack among the pines and needed to decide whether to stay or hike on. It was only 445 and I came here to hike. So move on to the shelter it was. 
I covered the mostly downhill 3.4 miles quickly. There’s a few people here. I ate a noodle pack and some snacks, set up camp, got water and it’s now almost bed time. 
Tomorrow I should get to another high mountain, Roan High Knob. The extra miles at the end today should help. I believe after Roan the big mountains are over for a while. I may also get up earlier to try and beat the heat.

Big tough day today. I did indeed get moving early, about 615. I quickly broke down camp, ate some instant oatmeal and was on my way. Most of today’s walking was in the forests with minimal views. 
There were 3 minor climbs this morning. Nothing too long or steep. I stopped at Clyde Smith Shelter for lunch. I ate a bunch to try and lighten my food load. I really need to get better at resupply. I have way too much. I topped off my water at the shelter. That was a long ways down and up. Then I was off. There was one more minor climb then a drop down into Hughes Gap Road. I had passed a hiker earlier in the day who said he had drinks and snacks at his pickup. I picked up my pace hoping there was some left. A few SOBO day hikers said I was coming onto some trail magic and I thought it was the pickup. I got to the gap and grabbed a Powerade then saw a tent down the road. A family had a full spread set out. I grabbed a PB&J and topped my water. I thanked them and started up Roan Mountain. 
This was a 5 mile, 2200 foot climb. It was tough. The forest was nice throughout, going from hemlock to pine, similar to yesterday. As I got higher the temperature kept dropping. It took about 3 hours of tough climbing but I made it to the summit. The first peak is Cloudland Peak. This area was the site of the Cloudland Hotel, a high society retreat opened in the late 19th century. It lasted about 20 years and is almost completely gone now. From there the trail drops a bit and then rises to Roan High Knob. I am tenting near the Roan High Knob Shelter, the highest shelter on the AT at 6270 feet. I can see how it could get quite cold up here but for tonight, the forecast low is about 50. 
Tomorrow I hope to cover 16.3 miles to Rt 19E to stay at a hostel. There are 2 and they both get good reviews. When I get enough signal I will call them and see what happens.

Wow! What a day. For days on end you hike in the green tunnel. Then one day you just pop out of that. But first ......
It got cold last night at 6200 feet but not that bad. In my tent last night I realized that the Roan Highlands where the pines thrive is very similar to lower elevations of northern NH and ME. Pine smell, tightly packed trees and very dark. It’s very pleasant hiking in it except for the part of the trail that was over an old gravel road. Very tough on the feet. 
I was up early. It was quite windy so I decided to pack up and start hiking and eat breakfast later. As the trail descended the pines gave way to hemlocks and I came out of the woods at Carvers Gap. It was packed with cars and it didn’t immediately register that it was a weekend morning and people like to camp on the balds. Balds would be the theme of the day. 
First up was Round Bald. A pretty easy climb up and great views. This was just the start. Next up was Jane bald. It too had great views. The trail then went by the side of Grassy Ridge Bald. I chose to pass on the 1.2 mile round trip to that summit. The views had been great so far. Little did I realize these views were weak. The trail then dropped down into Yellow Mountain Gap only to begin an 800 foot climb up to Little Hump Mountain (I told you in a previous entry, I don’t make the names). On the way up the very steep beginning of the climb I got a view of Overmountain Shelter. This shelter was formerly a barn and a very popular destination on the AT. It was condemned a few years ago and is off the trail so I passed. From the summit of Little Hump Mountain the views were spectacular. 360 degrees and the air had cleared. After a short drop the trail then climbed 600 feet to (did you guess where?) Hump Mountain. This one was the tallest and by far the best. I could see where I’d been and where I will be in a week in VA. Photos can’t do it justice. 
But, for everything that goes up, it must come down. 5.4 miles of down. The first mile was treeless and ok. Once in the trees again, it was rocks, rocks and more rocks for about 1.5 miles. I did pass a sign that said I had now completed NC. That’s 3 states done. (GA, NC, and MD last Oct). Finally the trail mellowed and I cruised along to RT. 19 and a short walk down the busy highway to Mountain Harbour Hostel. So far it’s good. Hot shower, quiet, beer for sale, and hopefully the food truck guy shows up. There’s another hostel on the NC side of the gap but it sounded like more of a party scene so I chose the one I’m at. 
Tomorrow starts off with a big climb then is pretty mellow the rest of the day. I will get 2 Mountain House meals here and should be good to my next resupply. It’s all good.

I slept well in the bunkhouse last night. There were a couple of other people in there along with some more private rooms. In the morning I had the breakfast that is pay and more a part of the B&B side of things. It was excellent and well known as being the best breakfast on the entire AT. I would agree. 
After gorging myself I hit the trail at about 855. It was about 1000 foot climb to start the day but few areas of it were steep. About half way up I met a thru hiker, Boston Bill. We have similar hiking styles. I am slightly faster but he is more consistent on the uphills. We started talking and ended up hiking together all day. He is also at this campsite tonight. 
Unlike yesterday, there was not much to see other than the green tunnel. We did take a short side trail to see Jones Falls. Due to the large breakfast I didn’t need to stop much. Just a snack and numerous stops for water. The hiking today wasn’t hard but it did tire me out. Lots of short ups and downs   It was a bit warm in the sun and very humid. A young couple, Rocket and Pop Tart, are also camped here. 
Tomorrow there are 3 options; go to the Black Bear Resort (more of a hostel) at 8 miles, go to Laurel Fork Shelter at 11 miles, or get up and over a 2000 foot climb to Boots Off Hostel at 17 miles.  We’ll see how things go.

I had all kinds of energy today. I think the breakfast yesterday, although great, weighed me down and left me sluggish all day. That was not the case today. I slept well last night at the campsite. Boston Bill and I couldn’t decide if we were at the campsite listed in the guide but decided to stay where we were. That was a good move because the campsite at the mileage marker listed could barely fit 1 tent. I got up to pee at about 1am and (I think) a screech owl let me know it was not happy I was disturbing it’s feeding. If you have never heard this owl, all 1 ounce of it, it is LOUD. I also heard some small critter(s) rustling around most of the night. 
Speaking of critters, here is an estimated tally:
Chipmunks - 100sSquirrel- ~50Turkey - 2Snakes - 2Rabbit - 1Bear - 1 (if you count the black thing in the distance in the Smokies)Bigfoot, Sasquatch, Yeti, abominable snowman, Swamp Ape (combined) - 0
Today I was up by 6, got packed up and headed out. I planned to cook some oatmeal in 2.5 miles at the shelter. It was a good thing we stayed where we did as the climb to the shelter was pretty steep. That would have been tough late with low energy. I got water on the way and arrived ready to eat. At the shelter the hikers that had not left yet were talking about a guy who was tented away from the shelter but snored so loud that everyone in the area couldn’t sleep. Again, glad I stayed where I did. 
After eating, my energy was even higher and I powered through a couple of short but steep up and downs. From there it was a 4 mile down to Dennis Cove Road and into the Laurel Fork area. After the road the trail follows a dead flat dirt track for a mile. On the way, there was a camp area on the Laurel Fork River. I stopped to eat lunch. There were 2 unopened cold cans of Coors Lite. I didn’t want it but gave one to the next hiker to come by, Ducky. It didn’t last long. While eating I watched a boy about 10 catch 2 good sized rainbow trout. He was thrilled with his nice catch. 
From there it was on to the Laurel Fork Falls. After the flat dirt road the trail meanders through some canyon like formations before entering the gorge. This is a long, steep and slow descent down hand cut rock to the river. Story has it that when the trail was being built back in the 30s, it was an all women team that worked this section. They did a hell of a job. It’s almost a vertical drop. The waterfall is nice and the air near it very cool. I scooped water onto my head, arms and legs to cool off and wash off some salt and dust. It felt great. From there the trail ran along the river for a ways with one big climb and then back to the river.
Next up was ‘The Climb’ of the day. This was a 2000 foot ascent to Pond Flats. Nothing to see here. I suppose this climb was needed to get out of the River gorge. Usually I stop often on these kind of climbs. Not today. I powered up with few stops as the sweat flowed freely in the humid air. At the top was a camp area where I rested and snacked. I noticed a tick on my leg just above my sock. I think it just started burrowing in when I pulled it out/off. I will have to keep an eye on that area for the ‘bullseye’ rash of Lyme disease. I check my legs often and my clothes are treated with Permethrin so I don’t think it was there long. The final part of the day was the 2000 foot descent into Hampton, TN and the Boots Off Hostel. 
The hostel is right near the trail. I am in the bunk house which is interesting. There are 4 bunk beds for 8 people. It’s a tiny little building but seems to work. There are also mini cabins and tenting available. The shower was outside but was nice and hot. There was a shuttle into town for resupply and a stop at Subway/McDonalds for dinner. All things hikers like and need. 
As I said, I felt great all day today. My only issue now is my pack. It doesn’t ‘arc’ like its supposed to and can be uncomfortable. In 3 days I will be in Damascus, VA where there is a full outfitter. I will look into a new pack. Other hikers with the same pack as mine are having the same issue. 
The terrain should be relatively easy into Damascus so we are planning to do mileage of 16, 16 and 10 to get there. There is a Methodist church there that provides a hostel to hikers and bicyclists (the Virginia Creeper Trail is very popular for bikers).  A few of us will try and stay there and take a Zero day (a no hiking day). I have not had a Zero yet and other hikers are amazed and/or confused. I don’t feel I’ve needed one yet. I seem to have the magic power today.
Heck, it’s 920 and I still have energy.

The hostel worked out well last night. Nice place overall and very convenient to the trail. I was up by 630, ate some honey muffins I had bought at the market and was hiking before 8. The trail immediately goes down to Watauga Lake. First impression, it’s a dump. Looks like everyone that uses the area just dumps their trash at the beach area. It’s unfortunate that the town doesn’t encourage users to take better care of it. I didn’t see a single trash can. This area could be a real boon for a rather depressed town. Once up on the ridge the lake looks gorgeous. From the beach area the trail then winds its way around the SW shoreline with a few small ups and downs. It eventually reaches the Watauga Dam. Similar to Fontana, this dam is part of the TVA. It’s an earthen dam and the power generation was way down from the dam itself. After a rather steep road walk, the trail goes up into the woods. After a mile it crosses a road and then heads up steeply to make the ridge line. I went through a lot of water as the sweating was profuse in the morning humidity.
About 8 miles into the hike, my head was down watching the tread and I heard the rattle and stopped on a dime. Right in the middle of the trail was a huge rattle snake. It was kind enough to pose for a picture then move off the trail. That was a huge adrenaline rush. Of course, the rest of the day I was expecting big snakes under every plant and rock. It didn’t happen.
I hiked most of the day with Boston Bill and Goob. I have been leapfrogging Goob for a few days now. Bill retired from his auto body shop. Goob just retired from the AF. He was a refueling boom operator then a navigator on KC-135s. Goob is videotaping his hike and has a YouTube channel, Goob’s Adventures. Check it out. We all ate lunch at Vandaventer Shelter. The afternoon was uneventful and generally easy walking. It should be like that into Damascus. We are staying at the Iron Mountain Shelter tonight. They are in the shelter while I am in my tent. Just before getting into the tent a large deer walked through the shelter area. Now while typing this entry I hear all sorts of small critters moving around.
Tomorrow’s plan is to do another 16 miles then 10 on Friday. It may be crowded in Damascus due to Memorial Day. We’ll see.

Today was rather uneventful. Gorgeous weather once again; cool in the morning, mostly sunny, only warm for an hour or two in the middle of the afternoon. We were all up just after 6. I packed up and we, Boston Bill, Goob and I, were hiking by 7. The terrain was very gentle all day. There were a few steeper ups but they were short compared to some past climbs. 
After a short distance we came to the Nick Grindstaff Monument. He was a hermit in the mid 19th century who lived out in the woods. There is a whole backstory to him I need to look up (no cell coverage tonight). 
A while later we crossed highway TN 91. From here the trail goes into a handicap accessible field for 1/2 mile. We stopped for a snack on some rocks and a bench. A local runner came by, a talker, who told us more about Grindstaff. It seems the hermit had a very loyal dog. When Nick died in the woods the dog would not leave the body. To get to the body and bury it, authorities had to shoot the dog. The local guy told us he has been trail running up near the monument after fresh snowfall and there will be dog prints in the snow but no entry or exit tracks. It seems the dead dog may still be loyal to old Nick. 
The trail continued to be easy and we stopped at Double Spring Shelter for lunch. We finished lunch and thought about going on to Damascus for a 26 mile day. No!  Next we dropped down to US 421 and topped off water. A few miles later we topped off again at a stagnant but clear pool. We kept the water topped off because the spring at the shelter is a long way down. At 421, as we just started up the trail from the road, a skunk walked 10 feet in front of us. I had to yell at Bill to stop. We/He was close to an issue. It was odd that the skunk did not smell at all. 
We arrived at the shelter before 4. Socialized with some other hikers that were going into Damascus, cooked and ate dinner and got set up. I also made some calls and was finally able to get bunks for the 3 of us for Friday and Saturday in Damascus. Holiday weekend and it’s going to be busy.  And, it is in fact a very long way down to the spring for water. 
Tomorrow is less than 10 easy downhill miles to town. We should be there by 11. Also, my food bag is almost empty. Walking into town with an empty food bag is the goal but I thought I bought too much in Hampton. I have finally started eating bigger lunches and dinners. And, one final but important lesson I learned. Caramel M&Ms are terrible. Flavorless. The Hampton market didn’t have regular, peanut or peanut butter in the size I need so I went with caramel. Lesson learned.

It was a mostly uneventful night. Around 3am it rained some. It sounded torrential in the tent but when I got out in the morning it looked like just a quick shower. 
I’m still with Boston Bill and Goob. We were on the trail just after 7. Today was a short and easy 10 miles into Damascus, VA. Not much on or about the trail to talk about. No views and we didn’t need to get water. We did leave TN for good and now have 550 miles in VA, a full quarter of the trail.
We rolled into Damascus at 11. The trail comes into a town park then ends up on the main road. We ate lunch at the diner. It was quite good. Goob went to the library to try and upload his YouTube videos. Bill and I went to the outfitters as we are both having issues. The guy in the store was able to quickly identify Bill’s pack issues. Then I showed him mine. He just looked at it and said you’re not doing a long distance hike with that ZPacks backpack. I have heard that from many hikers who have or had that pack. Basically, it has rods that are supposed to arc away from my back so the pack only touches me at the shoulders and hips. The rods always bend to the sides and cause neck and back pain and fatigue. I ended up purchasing an Osprey Exos 58 liter pack. It felt really good in the store. I will send the ZPacks home as it would be ok with a very light load. 
Tomorrow I am taking my first zero day; no hiking miles. I’ll eat, resupply, eat, send the pack home, then eat again. My weight is only down about 10 pounds so I must be getting enough food.
We are staying in a new hostel, Lady Di’s B&B/Hostel. It is very nice, new, includes laundry and breakfast, and very clean. Best hostel so far.

Zero day on Saturday. Still plenty of steps, though. The idea behind a Zero is to take a break and let your body heal a bit from the pounding you put on it while hiking. I did that. Started with a great breakfast as part of my stay. Went to Food City in the morning for a 4 day resupply. Stopped at the outfitters but he wasn’t open so we went to the other outfitters. Got a pack cover for the new pack and stove fuel. The old poorly functioning pack did not need a cover. I got a box to ship the old pack home. We then went back to the first outfitters because his freeze dried meal prices are much lower. He was open and I got 3 of them. Then it was back to the hostel for a relaxing afternoon of nothing. Some of the hikers soaked their feet in Epsom salts. I passed as my feet feel good and I don’t want to fix what isn’t broken. Dinner was at 7 Trails Grill. I had a (whole) pizza and a beer. Back to hostel early, relaxed and asleep early. I still feel good and am ready to eat breakfast and head out. We are planning to go 75 miles over the next 4 days to Marion, VA.  Hopefully we will get a visit from the wild ponies in the Grayson Highlands.

The last day and a half was restful but I am ready to be hiking again. Lady Di’s has been the best hostel so far by a longshot. Breakfast today was large and delicious and a bit earlier to accommodate hikers heading out. If you’re hiking through Damascus or riding the Creeper Trail you should try and stay here. 
I’m still hiking with Goob and Boston Bill. We left the hostel at 8. It was cold this morning at around 48 degrees. We cut down the alley to avoid the traffic then met up with the Creeper Trail for about half a mile. Finally the trail turned left and headed up into the woods. This climb was about 1000 feet but was not very steep. After some downs it then climbed again for about 800 feet. This climb had lots of switchbacks and seemed a lot longer than it was. At the top we went into Saunders Shelter for lunch. It was cold up there. I inhaled a tortilla with peanut butter and some jerky. I was getting cold sitting there so I moved on. 
The afternoon was easy. A long down from lunch led into us walking for about a mile on the Creeper Trail. There were plenty of bikers. It seems tour companies shuttle people and bikes from towns to the top of Whitetop Mountain where the Creeper starts and we passed by. The Creeper is a former rail line used for moving trees from logging operations. From the top it is almost totally downhill for the bikers. I didn’t notice anyone peddling except over the bridges. Eventually we turned off the Creeper. From there it was about 2 miles of gradual up to the shelter. There are a lot of hikers here tonight. Maybe due to the distance from Damascus. The shelters for most of the next 50 miles have bear boxes. These are metal boxes with latches to keep the bears from getting to hiker food bags. They worked in MD and PA. I hope it works here. There was a hiker back at the hostel who had his tent torn by a bear before Damascus. 
Tomorrow we hope to go 17.5 miles or more and get well into Grayson Highlands. Perhaps I’ll have a selfie with a wild pony. 
Not much to see today but very satisfying hiking. 
That’s all for now. It’s going to be cold tonight.

Rocks! Today was all about the ankle twisting, knee jarring, enough already rocks. Today was a great day but the rocky terrain takes its toll. And, the thru hikers passed the 500 mile mark. I’m coming up on 400.
We were up early. It was C-C-C-Cold this morning. 38 according to one hiker’s thermometer. I had my usual 2 packets of instant oatmeal, packed up and we were on trail at 653. The trail started down for about a mile and the tread was good. Then we crossed a road and started the big climb of the day of 2000 feet. Almost immediately the trail became much rockier. It wasn’t steep but was challenging due to the rocks. We made good time getting to the top. We traversed the ridge for a few miles then dropped down a bit. We got to route VA 600 about 11 and ate lunch on some rocks. The parking was crowded with day hikers out for Memorial Day. 
After lunch we began a slow ascent into Lewis Fork Wilderness. As you climb up the terrain gets rockier and more like something out in Utah or Nevada. Eventually the trail works it’s way through various large rock formations providing excellent long range views on this mostly sunny day. We then got to Thomas Knob Shelter where we topped off water. There was a former thru hiker giving out treats to hikers. I didn’t get her name but thank you. From the shelter we continued to climb to an open area where 3 of the ponies were hanging out. We stopped for pictures and a quick chat and moved on. More rocks, rock climbing, and rock hopping were in store. At one point you have to get through a tight spot called Fat Man Squeeze. I’ve lost a lot of weight so I was able to make it. A few more climbs took us over more rock outcrops with great views. 
Finally we reached Grayson Highlands State Park. There were plenty more ponies to greet us and all the other tourists on arrival. On the trail we passed a guy who gave us cookies. Thanks. Following more rocky roads and trails we reached our destination of Wise Shelter. This shelter is in the state park and does not allow tenting. But, Boston Bill, Goob and I have the shelter to ourselves at this point. I know there are lots of other hikers around but have no idea where they all went. 
Food bags are in a bear box. Plenty of horse land mines (bombs is more like it) are around so I have to be careful when I go pee in the dark. Clearly the ponies come near the shelter so we may get a visit. 
The plan is to go 20 miles tomorrow. Goob’s feet have been hurting so hopefully there are less rocks tomorrow. The elevation profile doesn’t look too bad for tomorrow but that view of the trail has not always been honest with us. Regardless, tomorrow we will walk.

I crossed the 400 mile mark this morning. I’ve now been out here for 4 weeks (tomorrow) and still having a good time. It’s tough but rewarding to see the distance keep going up. 
No one else came to the shelter last night. Seemed odd, but so be it. There were some deer running around the shelter area as well as the biggest bunny I’ve ever seen. No Bigfoot. 
I’m still hiking with Goob and Boston Bill. I slept in the shelter last night as tenting in that area was not allowed. We were up at 6, with the sun. Chores got done, ate some oatmeal and off we went at 655. 
We were in and out of Grayson Highlands State Park for the first few miles and it remained rocky. There were some good views back to some of the areas we climbed yesterday. A few miles after the park the rocks dissipated to a more normal level. From here on out we were in the woods with little to see. The ups and downs were much gentler today. 
We stopped at a shelter for snacks then another for lunch. We rolled into our destination, Trimpi Shelter, at about 540. This shelter is an old stone structure with an odd layout not made for vertically superior hikers like myself. I chose to tent down below the shelter. There are a good number of hikers here tonight. 
Tomorrow we thought of going 21 miles and stay in Marion, VA. Now we’re thinking 10 but still going into Marion. Goob’s feet have been hurting him so he needs rest and try to resolve that. Since I got the new pack I have had no neck pain but my left middle back has been hurting. I try stretching it all day with little relief. I did lower how I wear my pack and that helped. I borrowed a cork ball from BB and roll on that to loosen the knot. It seems to help. In Marion I will get plenty of Ibuprofen as they also seem to help. I think I can beat this with the right combination of remedies. I might try some yoga stretching tonight. 500 miles to go (now sing the song).

Today was a rather uneventful day. Up real early and hiking before 7. We agreed to do 10 miles and get a ride into town. The terrain was mostly easy with a few small steep spots. Only one place with a view down into Rye Valley. My back felt better today but it usually doesn’t hurt bad until later in the day.  Ending early today should help. I got a tennis ball to roll on to try and loosen it up.
We stopped at the Grayson Highlands State Park HQ. It was closed due to COVID. Why?  There is a phone outside and Goob called the shuttle driver. He arrived in 15 minutes and got us to the Travel Inn in Marion. Good enough for 1 night. We couldn’t check in so we ate lunch at the Mexican place and resupplied at Walmart and Ingles. Laundry is in work. It is all good. 
Tomorrow I will walk. Boston Bill and I will get a ride back to where we left off today and continue north. We plan to go about 70 miles in 4 days to a hostel that provides rides to somewhere for resupply. Goob will take a zero day and see if his feet feel better.

Today was a very satisfying day. The Travel Inn of Marion was fine for 1 night. I was up early but we were told by our driver, Jim, to call him at 8 in the morning and he will come get us. Goob was staying another night to work on his feet so Boston Bill and I were packed and ready before 8. At about 5 to 8, who comes driving into the Inn parking lot? Jim. We grabbed our stuff, tossed it and us in the minivan and off we go. Things like this just seem to work out on the trail. Some hikers say “The trail provides.” I don’t think like that but there does seem to be some truth to it. Even better, there was another couple already in the van going to a remote destination on a forest service road. BB and I got dropped off first. 
We were hiking by 820. The first 6.5 miles was 2 big pointless up and downs (PUD) over very rocky terrain. Nothing at all to see. We got to the Chatfield Shelter a little before noon and ate lunch and topped off water. From there it dropped a bit more, crossed a road and the rocks disappeared. The trail was much more level and our pace greatly increased. We went a few more miles, some in fields that had the trail mowed, and reached the Settlers Museum. We did not go in the museum but we went in the old one room schoolhouse from 1894 called Lindamood School. It was interesting how things were done back then. 
Back through more fields and gradual ups and downs. We were heading to the quickie mart near I-81 for some junk food. The last mile took forever. Maybe the guide was off a bit. When it said .2 to go it seemed more like .6. I loaded up on calories with a Moon Pie, large Milky Way and regular Mountain Dew. A quick 1000 calories I would never eat normally. I don’t really have a ravenous hunger like a lot of hikers but if it’s there, no matter how much, I will eat it. 
After this feast it was about 6.8 miles to our desired camp spot. No shelters in this area. We passed through some small fields and woods then reached a large open cow pasture. Had to watch out for large cow pies. The views back through the pasture were nice. After a series of decent climbs we reached our destination at 545. Good mileage in good time, even with stops. It’s just us at the campsite. Water is close and there are few bugs. 
Today was the first day on this hike I have hiked in rain. It was light for about an hour. I did put on the pack cover because you don’t want to do that once it is raining. The rain jacket went on for 5 minutes but the rain quickly stopped and off came the jacket. Really, an insignificant rain, but some hikers in Marion chose to take a Zero because of the rain potential. I don’t get it. You won’t get to Maine without the pain and the rain. But, HYOH. 
Tomorrow we are looking to get an earlier start as there are some good climbs and we prefer doing them when it is cooler early in the morning. If we make the 18 miles as planned we will camp at an old fire wardens hut that has been converted to a shelter, is in an open field and should have great views. We’ll see. Regardless, tomorrow I will walk.  And on that thought, the simplicity of what I am doing may be at the core of why I enjoy it. I don’t have to worry about anything except breaking down camp in the morning, walking until I don’t want to walk any more and setting up camp in the early evening. Really, that’s it. Sure, resupply, cell coverage, electronics charging, calories, etc. are in the back of my mind, but they aren’t that important to the daily activity. Just get up and walk.

Great day today. Up early, packed up, ate Pop Tarts and walking at 710. Today had a lot of climbs. The first was immediately out of camp and steep. Both up and down. Boston Bill and I crossed a road and entered a cow field. Other than avoiding the mines it was great climbing through the grass. The views back were good. 
After the descent we entered another pasture area. Then along the north fork oh the Holsten  River. More cows above the river. Then 2 large PUDs. I did go over a number of large stiles through the pastures. I also saw an orange salamander. I missed 2 rattlesnakes BB saw right where I had been. I had to ford a creek where the bridge was out. Only a foot deep in my Crocs.
Finally we started the big 2300 foot climb up to Chestnut Knob Shelter. The first half of this climb was steep and tough through the woods. It then mellowed a bit through a burn area. Finally it entered a field or bald area for about 3 miles. There was a spring 2 miles from the summit where I topped off my water. No water at the top. After some more fields I reached the top and the old stone building. I decided to tent for the views.
This summit overlooks Burke’s Garden, a unique geological area in VA. A bunch of other hikers have shown up. I have no idea where they are all day. If my apps are right, the sun should rise at 604 directly in front of me.  Also, Mount Rogers and Whitetop are visible behind me. They are 31 crow miles and 77 trail miles. 
Tomorrow, Boston Bill will go to a hostel for a day off. I plan to go longer miles in this area as the terrain should be easier. I will need to go into Bland, VA for a small resupply to get me to Pearisburg, VA in 3 or 4 days. 
All’s still good. My back still hurts on the ups but not as bad. I hope the flatter terrain will help with that.

Today did not go as planned. Everyone tenting at the shelter area was up before 620 to see the sunrise. It was worth it. Stunning, with a low layer of clouds hanging in the Garden valley. 
Boston Bill and I were hiking by 6. After the downhill both of us were feeling drained. We should not have been tired after such a short distance. I think I am not getting enough calories. We slowly made our way to the dirt road where BB would call to get a ride to the hostel. And then it happened; I was way ahead of BB and came up on 2 bears near the trail. We looked at each other, they knew who the boss was and ran off. 32 hiking days to see a bear reasonably up close. 
BB’s driver was dropping off other hikers when we arrived at the dirt road, one of 2 exits from the valley. He said he had room if I wanted to stay. I would have had to get off trail for resupply tomorrow anyways so figured why not go today. 
We told the driver we wanted to eat and resupply first. He took us to an Amish bakery/restaurant/store in Burke’s Garden. There is a large Amish population here. I had 2 big glazed donuts, a cream filled donut, a sarsaparilla and a root beer. Not a bad start to adding calories. Never had a sarsaparilla before and it was good. Sort of like a mild root beer. BB had a nice looking burger. Everything is grown or made locally and all was excellent. I wish we were a bit later for when the meatloaf was ready. We waited for an hour in the grass for our ride to come back. We then left Burke’s Garden via the only paved road out of the valley for the Food Lion in Tazewell, VA. I resupplied for 3 days. With what I had left I will make Pearisburg even if it takes an extra day. 
The hostel is OK, but not great. It’s an old house with a bunk room and some other private rooms. It could be great with some fix up and cleaning. Laundry is working and I had a shower so all is good. Many more hikers are arriving but I can’t tell where they all will stay. BB and I bought steaks, salad, and potatoes at Food Lion for dinner. 
The talk is potential rain tomorrow. It doesn’t seem to rain on me so unless it’s pouring, I’m heading out.

Some thru hikers will tell you VA is flat. Definitely not flat, but it is a more gradual grade and today was one of those days. 
Most people staying at the hostel liked it. Overall, I didn’t care for it. The people running things were nice and went out of their way to do things for guests, but they were very disorganized. The house is in a great scenic location but needs a lot of work. The bunk was ok but not the most comfortable. What got me was how dirty everything was. From the kitchen, the floors, the porch, etc. I know it’s a communal kitchen but someone needs to make folks clean up after themselves. And, the doors are left open during the day and the house is loaded with flies. Compared to some of the other places we’ve stayed, I would pass on this in the future. I would, though, find a way to get to Mattie’s place, the Amish restaurant. 
As I said, today’s hike was easier than most days. I hiked with Boston Bill for the first few miles but then pulled way ahead. There were climbs but also some very flat or near flat areas. I was in the woods most of the day with nothing to see. After about 15 miles I popped out onto a gravel road that then became paved and then went under I-77. It then curved down further before finally going back into the woods. The road walk, longest so far, was about 1.5 miles but at least it was downhill. And, as usual, the AT likes to end on a high note. The toughest climb of the day was at the end to get to the shelter. 
I rolled in at about 345 and thought I would get water, eat and move on to find a tent site. I decided to get water first. It is a long .3 miles downhill to the water over many switchbacks. At the end of a long day this is walking you don’t want to do. This is on top of the .25 miles the shelter is off trail. I got my 2 liters and filtered it. I ate a Mountain House chicken fried rice dinner and a few scoops of peanut butter. I couldn’t decide to move on or not as the distances to things are not made easier by a few more miles tonight. I finally decided to set up my tent behind the shelter. There are about 10 hikers here. I am dreading getting more water in the morning but there is none for the next 10 miles so I need to be topped off when I leave.
If you’ve been following along and reading each day, you’ll remember I made the statement ‘The trail provides.’  It did once again this evening. I was in my tent typing this entry when I hear a vehicle coming very close. Everyone was wondering what or who could get a four wheeler up here. I climb out of the tent to check it out. A local guy whose property borders the National Forest land the trail is on comes up here with a 5 gallon jug of water for the hikers. He also brought snacks and a bag to get rid of our trash. This is great unexpected trail magic that saves us all from going back down to the water source. Everyone was thrilled. He gets here on a trail on his property that gets close. The trail is also used to maintain the shelter and privy here so the people doing the work don’t have to climb that big hill with their tools, supplies and lumber. A good end to a great day. 
Tomorrow BB and I will go about 20 miles to set us up to go to Woods Hole Hostel the following day. My back is still hurting and they may offer massages. Nothing else has worked so it may be worth a try. Goob is just a few miles back so we may see him in Pearisburg.

It sure was nice not to have to go down that hill this morning to get water. And I was able to properly dispose of my trash. I was up early as usual. Had 2 oatmeal packets and packed up. Boston Bill was ready before me so he headed out. I never did see him again today. I was hiking by 650. The elevation grade looked very favorable today and it turned out the profile was right. No large ups or downs and just a few rocky areas. BB and I talked about getting to Dismal Creek where there were some tent sites. 
I was rolling along at a good clip but my middle back was hurting, as it has for 2 weeks now. I think it started with the ZPacks pack bending to the sides instead of how it was supposed to. I was out of balance which strained by back. I had hoped the new pack would solve it. It helped for a few days but today was really painful. I know what it needs; a week with no pack. It doesn’t hurt at all with the pack off. Unfortunately that isn’t going to happen when hiking or backpacking. Unless I get a miracle cure tomorrow, I think I will end my hike in Pearisburg. I told myself if I wasn’t having fun I would stop and today wasn’t fun when it should have been. I’ll see how tomorrow goes then decide what to do. Enough whining. 
I got to the first shelter about 1030 and wanted to eat. The trail to the shelter was downhill and I did not want to have to climb it when done. I continued on another mile to a road and ate there. I suspect BB was at the shelter, that’s why I never saw him today. 
After lunch there were just a couple of easy climbs then a long stretch of flat to get to the tentsite. Even on flat ground I had to keep stopping to stretch my back. On the way I passed the 500 miles hiked mark. No views at all today. Then out of nowhere, the unthinkable happened. For 33 previous days this hasn’t happened to me. It rained!  Pretty hard thunderstorm for a few of the 30 minutes it rained. I already had the pack cover on. I got under a tree and got my rain jacket on and just waited it out. When it slowed down I threw on the pack and kept going. I got to camp about 515. Great time with all the stops, stretching, and breaks for 22 miles. I got a text message from BB saying he bailed out and went to Weary Feet Hostel. I think he made the right choice. I think Goob was trying to get there as well. Also, I saw a lot of deer today. Certainly more deer than views. 
It’s now 730 and it is dripping on the tent. I had just enough time to cook up some noodles and eat a protein bar before more rain came in. I had to eat in my tent; a real no no when it comes to keeping bears away. I was very careful not to spill anything. There’s some thunder in the distance but none in the valley I am in. I was hearing something large on the other side of the creek and investigated. More deer. Now owls are hooting. 
Tomorrow we are going to Woods Hole Shelter. It’s sort of a hippie type place where everything is grown on the property, there’s afternoon yoga, and lots of animals running around. My trail guide said they offer massages but the response I got from the owner is not at this time. Probably a COVID thing. I thought a massage might be what my back needs. 
I’ll end this entry to the pitter-patter of rain drips on the tent. One other first just occurred to me; this appears like it will be the first night I am camped alone.

Short day today. I was indeed alone at the Dismal Creek tentsite by myself. It never did rain anymore last night. I didn’t need to be at the hostel until 1 so I took my time, packed up, ate and was on my way at 750. I made a point of taking vitamin I (Ibuprofen) right when I woke up to see if that helps my back. The Dismal Creek area is quite dismal; dark, eerie and the water is a bit stagnant.
The trail started out very gentle today, weaving through the dark green tunnel of rhododendrons along the creek. After 2.5 miles things turned upward into steep, rutted and rocky trail. It took about an hour to get to the top. Once up there it was a pretty mild trail except for some rocky areas. I did get 2 rock outcrops with views down to the valley below.
After a long gradual down I reached a service road, found the sign to the Woods Hole Hostel and walked the final .5 miles off trail on the gravel road, downhill. Leaving will be up. Yuk. 
This hostel is very nice, clean and well organized. I got here before 1 and they gave me the rundown on how things work and where everything is. I first needed to eat and got the bread and cheese. It was a lot of bread and cheese. I couldn’t quite get the end of the bread down. I also had a few sodas. I got a shower and did laundry. Lounged around. Then at 4 you can get a fruit smoothie. It was tasty. For dinner it was salad grown in the garden here, cheeses made here, breads made here and dressings and dips, also locally grown. All very good. I got my calories today. They have 2 scales. One new digital device in the bunk room and an older slide style scale on the house porch. The fancy scale said 150. The simple weight scale said 170. If I’m 150, down 30+ pounds, I could not hike 10 hours a day. I feel about 170. 
So my back was still bad. It started hurting in the middle of the first long climb. I tried lots of things to no avail. I talked to my evac ride and we have a plan. I am going to hike into Pearisburg tomorrow and see how I feel. I’ll call him when I get to town. When I have the pack’s hip belt really low I feel better but the top of the pack moves a lot. I will also increase my vitamin I to 800mg 2 times a day as that is prescription strength. I am also thinking about a few days of slack packing to give my back a chance to rest and heal. Maybe if I’m a bit smarter I can get to Daleville in 105 miles and reevaluate the situation. If I am totally miserable tomorrow, I’ll get my ride and bail out.

The Woods Hole Hostel was a good place. Clean, comfortable and friendly people. I got plenty to eat while there and slept reasonably well. I was up before 6, quietly got my things down from the loft, ate some oatmeal and hit the trail with Boston Bill by 7. It was to be a short day into Pearisburg. 
The hike started by walking uphill from the hostel back to the trail. Then it was uphill for about 2 miles. The elevation profile looked steep but it was a very gradual up. I was concerned that my back would have issues right away. I had taken some vitamin I last night then more this morning. My hope was that if I can keep the pain away on the climb I may be able to get through the day and it can heal a bit. A few times I thought it might start hurting so I took short pack off breaks. That seemed to help. Before I knew it we reached the top. No views as we were in the green tunnel. 
From there it was small rolling up and downs for about 4 miles. Again, I was conscious about relaxing my back and taking my pack off. Next was a 2 mile climb that was gradual. Again, I felt my back wanting to hurt but was able to hold it off. At this summit, Pearis Ledges, there were rock outcroppings overlooking the valley near Pearisburg. It was nice to have a view after the climbs. 
Finally, it was 3.5 miles down to the road that the hostel would pick us up from. The initial descent was very steep but eventually eased, although still steep. The tread was very slick from the previous night’s rain and high humidity. I almost went down a few times and once turned me knee at a bad angle. Luckily no damage. My hiking poles to the rescue again. 
This hostel is a lot simpler than yesterday. Bunk room, bathrooms with shower, laundry. All I need. Dinner at the Mexican place was good as was a Blizzard at DQ. We got some freeze dried dinners from a mercantile. I got snacks at the Food Lion. I did not resupply yet. 
Why?  I am going to slack pack 20.7 miles tomorrow. My goal is to not have 25 pounds on my back and give my back another day to recover. I will carry a $2 Walmart book bag pack with some snacks, 1 bottle of water, Tp, water filter, rain coat and wallet. Maybe 5 pounds. I, and a few others, will get a ride to a road crossing down the trail. I should be able to fly. Also, I will be going southbound (SOBO) which means I will avoid the big 6 mile climb out of town. Based on how I feel I will determine if I’m going forward. I think I will be ok. Then the next day I will get a ride to the road crossing where I start tomorrow and head NOBO. Also, I will meet up with BB and Goob that night at the shelter. Goob seems to have improved his feet situation. 
Until tomorrow.","Woods Hole Hostel

Slacker! I have now slack packed. I understand why so many thru hikers go out of their way to slack pack. I had a book bag size pack with just essential items. Maybe it weighed 4 pounds. It was like floating on marshmallows. I feel like I cheated.
I was up before 6 because I wanted to make sure I was on the 7am shuttle to the Peter’s Mountain trailhead. Everything worked out and I was hiking SOBO at 730. There were 2 girls doing the same thing and I would see them a few times in the afternoon when I took breaks.  The trail started up from the trailhead for about 3.5 miles. There were a few steep spots to start but it didn’t matter. I powered up that hill in no time. No huffing and puffing and no sweating. I was feeling good. Then there was 9 miles of rolling trail. There were a few miles of slippery rocks. It had rained the previous night. I went through a grassy field for about a mile. The grass had gone to seed and it was soaking wet. I thought the grass held an incredible amount of water considering it had had time to evaporate. A short time into this grass and my shoes and clothes were soaked. It wouldn’t matter. 
I stopped at an open spot in the grass that had a view to the west into WV. While on the 9 mile ridge walk the trail crossed many times between WV and VA. At about 1230 I crossed paths with Goob and Boston Bill. They had made great time coming up the big climb out of Pearisburg that I would go down. We traded intel and went on our ways. I should catch them somewhere tomorrow. I noticed a lot of trees down and snapped and the trail wound around the spots. I wasn’t sure what had happened. Goob pointed out that back in February there was a huge ice storm that took out trees and big power lines I crossed under later. This area must have been quite a mess.  Thank you to all the trail maintainers and other volunteers who made this area passable.
At 1 the skies opened up and it rained hard for at least an hour. Once wet, there’s nothing to do but keep walking. So that’s what I did. It stopped raining as I crossed a meadow with views again into WV. But once in the woods it started to rain again. The pack I had was so small it fit under my rain jacket. BTW, rain jackets become useless when hiking because you sweat inside them and the moisture collects inside. Luckily the rains were warm. 
My intel told me my down into town would be gradual with good tread. It was right. I could go full speed most of the time without concern of tripping or sliding. Popping out of the woods brought me to some big factory, then up some stairs and onto a sidewalk on a busy bridge over the New River. A somewhat hidden turn after the bridge and a short distance later I was at the pickup spot. 
I couldn’t reach the hostel for a ride so I chatted with one of the girls that also slack packed, Mighty Mouse. I kept calling the hostel and texted with no reply. I finally got a text stating they were all out shuttling people and it would be 45 minutes. We decided to walk to the hostel once the other girl arrived. Not 1 minute up the road, the girls stuck out their thumbs and a car stopped. It was their waitress from the Mexican restaurant the previous night. She gave us a ride to the restaurant and it was a short walk to the hostel. 
I ate at the Mexican place again and got my resupply. On the way back I slipped on the muddy trail to the hostel. No damage other than pride. Crocs and steep muddy trails don’t mix. 
My vitamin I regimen seems to be working. No pain at all today. I did think it might flare up a few times but it didn’t. I have committed to going on to at least Daleville, VA, 73 more miles. There are some very scenic spots in this stretch, weather permitting, that I really want to see. Tomorrow I’ll start with a big steep climb with a heavy pack. That should tell me how the back is doing. 
It’s hiker midnight; 9pm.

Sort of a strange day and we did not make our goals. I was up early and got packed up quickly to ensure I was ready fo the 7am shuttle to Peter’s Mountain Trailhead. I sucked down 2 oatmeal packets and away we went. 
Goob and Boston Bill stayed at the shelter just .4 miles south of where I was starting so they were just a short distance ahead of me. The trail meanders for the first 2 miles along or near a stream. It crosses over a nice bridge, a road, then begins the climb. It was quite steep at first and then mellowed some. I got to the last water source for many miles, went down the steep path and filled up. Goob and BB were at the water also topping off. We then hiked together for most of the day. 
Once at the top of the climb things got fairly level but very rocky. This was challenging walking and you had to have all your concentration on the next step. Additionally, it was wet from last night’s rain. After 2 miles the rocks eased and we made better time. 
Across the ridge there was only 1 spot with a view, Wind Rock. It looked NE and was a huge forested area with only 1 visible building. Odd to see so little civilization in such a wide scene. 
Just before the downhill BB was complaining about his right side being numb. I guess he felt like this for a few days. He previously told me he had a mild stroke in the past. I was concerned he may be having some stroke-like issue. I pushed him hard to take some aspirin just in case. He seems ok, but is understandably concerned and is considering getting off trail. Goob had gone ahead, not knowing what was going on. BB and I got to the first shelter about 315 where Goob was waiting. Too early to stop normally but with how BB felt, rain coming in and the guide showing a monster climb soon, we decided to stay where we were. The shelter is nice and water is close. BB seems to feel better and the rain did come, but light. We’ll see about the killer climb tomorrow. I ate a freeze dried Pad Thai meal that was good and was about 1000 calories. 
Tomorrow we hope to get up early to do the climb when it is cool. BB is looking to get to a road to try and get a ride to get evaluated. There is a gravel road before the climb and a rural major road in 8 miles but he’ll have to do the climb. Goob and I plan to go 18 to a shelter. This will allow us to begin the Virginia Triple Crown on Sunday with Dragon’s Tooth. It is a popular outcrop shaped like a ......  Then on Monday we can hit McAfee Knob and Tinker Cliffs. Both of these are crowded on weekends and the weather is questionable. Monday is forecasted to be better and less tourists. 
My back was ok today, not great. I think the rocks caused a lot of torque and stress. It never got painful, just uncomfortable. I’ll keep taking vitamin I and hope for the best.

There was something to see today other than woods. We’ve been in the forest for most of the past week. It’s in the woods but it’s nice to get some variety. 
There was a train wreck at the shelter last night. Not literally. A hiker came in, smoked way too much pot, spread out stuff in the shelter including an open food bag, then disappeared. We were in sleeping bags ready to sleep and never noticed the food. It could have been ugly but luckily no bears came around. 
Goob, Boston Bill and I left at 643; nice and early. We had a long day planned. BB was not any better and decided to bail out. It was the right decision. But he had to get to a road with traffic. After a short down we came to the first dirt road. BB never would have gotten a ride here. He decided to join us for the big climb. It was tough but not the climb of death a commenter posted in the guide. The last 500 feet of elevation was very steep at about 1000 ft/mile. That might be the steepest climb yet. We traversed the ridge for a while then Goob and I went out to Kelly Knob, a rock outcrop. No views but we did have phone service. BB continued down to the shelter. We got to the shelter just as he was leaving to get to a road. Goob and I snacked at the shelter then moved on. 
After a short while we came out to a huge pasture. The first time in about a week. Great views all around. We got to the main road and other hikers said BB did indeed get a hitch. It was fun hiking with him the past couple of weeks. 
After the road we had another climb up to the Keffer Oak, the largest oak on the southern AT. It was large at over 18 feet circumference. It was indeed large but is showing wear and tear of its 300+ years. 
Another long climb got us back on the ridge. A mile on we came to a series of rock cairns. There doesn’t seem to be a consensus on what, when or why they are there. Farmers moving rocks, storage for apples long ago, hikers having fun.....
A few more miles led to some nice views to the SE. then I got to the ledges. This was a long series of rock slabs angled about 45 degrees down. The views were great but the hiking precarious. One wrong move could be trouble. Obviously I made it. It was fun but tiring. Next was a sign indicating the Eastern Continental Divide. Why there?  We’ve been on the divide a long time. I peed on the Atlantic side. A few more miles down and I made it to the shelter at 5. Goob came in a bit later. 
Another freeze dried meal of chicken with risotto. It was good. I am staying in the shelter again. I wasn’t sure about the weather but the humidity dropped and skies cleared and the weather looks good going forward. 
Tomorrow Goob and I should hit 2 key sites. The first is the Audie Murphy Monument. If you don’t know who that is, please look him up. A very brave American. The second site is Dragon’s Tooth. Some big climbs again.

A few days ago I made a comment in an entry about a lot of trees being down and why weren’t they cleared. I thought I was taking a jab at myself for not knowing why so many trees were down. A person commented on that day’s entry that I was speaking negatively about trail maintainers. That was not in any way my intent. I went back and reread the entry and the person was totally correct in their interpretation of what was written. Thanks for calling me out on that. I have tweaked that entry to better reflect what I was thinking. 
On the topic of trail maintainers, thank you for all the hard work you do. Nothing but respect and awe for the efforts you put in to allow us to walk this great trail. All the thru, section and day hikers really do appreciate the work you do. I think most maintainers are unpaid volunteers who put in many hours to keep the trail in great condition. The trail for me this year has been immaculate. Few blowdowns, good tread. It really is amazing what they accomplish over rugged challenging terrain. Again thank you and sorry to any maintainers that read my post and were offended. 
As for today...I was up early, took care of chores, ate and headed out. The first few miles were gentle down to a forest road then gradual up. We made sure our water was topped off as it would be sparse today. We then began a long 1500 foot climb. It was graded well and the tread was excellent but the morning humidity was brutal. The sweat was flowing freely after a short ways up. It seemed to take forever but we reached the top where there was a well placed bench. There was cell coverage so we hung out for a while. Goob got us rooms in Daleville for Tuesday night. 
We continued on over mostly level terrain until we reached the short side trail to the Audie Murphy Monument. I know after yesterday’s post you went and looked him up. For those that didn’t, he was the most decorated soldier in WWII. His accomplishments are legendary. Unfortunately, he died in a plane crash near the monument site in 1971.
From there it was 3.5 miles downhill to another road crossing. And by now you know what we do after road crossings. We go up. Right after we eat. This was a long grueling climb. It started off easy enough but seemed to go on forever. There were some rocky areas and rock scrambles. Eventually we got to a series of ledges and rock outcrops. The views were great to the valley below. Further on were more rock scrambles on up and down terrain. Then we steeply went up to get to today’s primary goal, Dragon’s Tooth. There is a short side trail down to this rock feature. It’s impressive. Who knew dragons had such big teeth. There is a whole line of these tall monoliths. I thought about climbing up one for a picture but then remembered I still need to climb down. Goob and I had some snacks and started down. And what a down it was. Rocks of all kinds, shapes and sizes. Scrambling on your butt, going down on rebar, hand over hand, etc. it was fun but very tiring. We were both done but still had a few miles to go to get to the road. Near the road crossing there is a gas station convenience store so we went there for a minor resupply and a burger. It was good for a gas station. I also had a pint of ice cream and a Hershey’s Bar. 
We decided we needed to go on another mile to a water source. We were empty. On the way I was able to check the weather and it looked bad. We got our water, quickly found a camp spot and set up. The thunder started shortly after and now it’s raining. The skies did seem to brighten a bit so maybe the worst of it will miss us. 
Tomorrow we will get to McAfee Knob and Tinker Cliffs. We plan to go 15.5 tomorrow leaving us under 10 on Tuesday into Daleville. 
My back hurt off and on today. Bearable. My knee started hurting as well. Then, to top it off, my 2nd and 3rd toes on both feet on the bottoms are getting chafed. I think it is from being in wet shoes and socks for too many days. I hope to air them out well tonight. Perhaps I do need a day off.

Awesome day today. Great trail, incredible views and a lot of happy hikers. 
Last night it did rain a lot and some intense lightning. I don’t think it was right over us but each flash is very bright in a tent. It then dripped from the trees all night. By morning the tent was only mildly wet but my ground cloth was soaked. Luckily, that goes on the outside of the pack. We were up before 6, packed up and walking by 645. Some quick Pop Tarts for breakfast. 
The trail quickly popped out of the woods into some farm pastures. Crossed a road then continued through pastures up into the woods. I like the pastures because of the great views but after a rain or on a dewey morning, it is really wet. Today was soaking. It’s amazing how much water a blade of grass with seeds can hold. The climb into the woods was steep but short and soon we were on the ridge. This lasted for 3 miles. Near the end of the ridge there were some cliffs to traverse with great views. I also passed the 600 mile mark. We then reached the parking area for the hike up to McAfee Knob. The trail up started steep then became more gradual and was excellent tread the whole way. On the way we passed a couple and the guy stops us and realizes he recognizes Goob from his YouTube channel. We stopped and chatted with them for a while. The gave us some food so that was nice trail magic. The guy had a lot of good hiking questions and hopes to thru hike next year. Goob and I stopped at Catawba Mountain Shelter for lunch and to get water. I headed up first from the shelter. Lunch and lots of water gave me a huge boost and I was able to power my way to the top. The trail in this area was perfect for me; good tread, when there were rocks they were spaced perfectly for me, and it wasn’t too hot. 
Some tourist sites get a lot of hype and never quite live up to the hype. McAfee Knob lived up to the hype. Incredible views from the overhanging rocks, few people and perfect weather. I got lots of pictures, drank plenty of water and relaxed while enjoying the view. Almost everyone gets their picture with their feet dangling over the edge. The view included Tinker Mountain which holds our next destination of Tinker Cliffs. After about 40 minutes at the knob, Goob and I headed out. 
After a down that wasn’t as steep as the guide showed, we ended up on the ridge line to Tinker. Most of the ridge was easy walking. We soon reached the start of the climb. It was steep and the afternoon got hot. We powered uphill and reached the cliffs. It starts out with some large square boulders then some ‘pre-cliffs’. Finally we reached the Tinker Cliffs. They too lived up to the hype. Incredible views of the valley as well as back towards McAfee Knob. We hung out here for a while. We talked to a young hiker wearing flip-flops. Not for me but if it works for him, HYOH. We left there for the short 1.6 miles down to the shelter. I ate 2 rice packet sides to basically empty my food bag. 
People are starting to come into the shelter area. One guy is hiking in an authentic WWII army uniform in honor of his grandfather who served in Germany in the war and recently passed away. He tries to do as much as possible with gear and cooking from that era. Very inspirational to see him do well out here while most of us have lightweight high tech gear and complain about little things. 
Tomorrow’s plan is to go under 10 miles into Daleville. Mostly downhill into town. My back was pretty good today. However, my left knee was bothering me some and may be slightly swollen. Also, those 2nd and 3rd toes on each foot feel lousy but I can’t figure out what’s wrong with them. If things don’t feel better tomorrow I may push the tap out button. Past hikers say you should quit on a good day and today was excellent. We’ll see how tomorrow goes.

A quiet night in the shelter. Up before 6 as usual. It was nice and dry this morning. Even the tall blades of grass were dry. There was a light breeze all night which must have kept the dew down. Packed up this morning and Goob and I were on trail at 640. Getting out of the shelter was fast because we don’t have to deal with a tent. 
The NERO into Daleville was on great terrain with a few rock outcrops for views. We went under power lines numerous times. There were no big ups or downs today. We arrived at the very busy road at about 11. The Super 8 was across the street and over 100 yards. Very convenient. They had our 2 rooms ready. This is a very nice motel with a hiker price. 
We went to eat lunch at Three Li’l Pigs BBQ and it was excellent. The sweet tea reminded me I am in the south; it was sweet. 
After 9 miles of thought today I have decided to stop my hike here. My initial arbitrary goal was to get to Harpers Ferry. I also wanted to hike the Shenendoahs. However, I have seen so many great sights and met tons of great folks, I want to end on a high note. The last few days were that. I believe stopping here is that note. The guide does not indicate much to see over the next 130 miles to get to Shenendoah and it is going to be hot. I think picking up here next year and going to Harpers would make a great 3 or 4 week section.  My aches and pains are minor and go away without the pack and shoes.  I don’t want to make them worse if I can help it. I had a great time hiking with Goob and Boston Bill for the past few weeks. I have had remarkably good weather for 6 weeks. All in all it’s been great and I am glad I was able to get out here. Thanks to my wife, Krispy, for indulging my desire to get away for a while. 
Finally, as mentioned in previous entries, the trail, shelters, facilities and people associated with the AT have been incredible. The tread is always excellent (really, no matter how much I complain about rocks). With the bubble of thru hikers just ahead, I expected to see more TP near the trail and candy wrappers on the ground. There was almost none. I may have picked up 8-10 pieces of wrappers over 600 miles. The shelters were all clean. The privies were in good shape even after all the thru hiker use. The people in towns, hostels, and restaurants were friendly and very accommodating to hikers. Thanks to everyone that provided trail magic. It always gives you a little boost up the next hill. I saw bears, snakes, deer and many other animals, except Bigfoot. No cicadas that I could hear. 
Good luck to Goob on his continued adventures. Be sure to check out his YouTube channel, Goob’s Adventures. And subscribe to his channel. Look for the good looking co-star lurking in the background. Hopefully BB is doing better and can get back on trail.

It’s time to hike again. Everything from the hike earlier this year has healed up. Our house is being remodeled and we need to be out for at least 3 weeks. Why not pick up from where I left off in June. So it was up early, fly from FL to Roanoke, get an Uber, and start walking. 
Other than the heat, the trail was great today. Gentle grades, few rocks and almost no roots. I was in the woods all day with no views but it felt good to be back. Water was sparse all day. I expected to pass lots of SOBO thru hikers but only saw 4. Just before the shelter a couple small streams were flowing. I needed that as the sweat flowed freely all day. It was hot and humid for October. I arrived at the shelter at about 5. Not bad for starting at 1130. There is 1 SOBO thru hiker and a couple of ladies walking the trail in VA in sections. At dinner at the picnic table I was offered trail magic next week. One of the ladies lives near the trail where you can get to Devil’s Backbone brewery. She offered to shuttle me there when I reach that road. The brewery has beer, obviously, but also good food and they let you tent on their property. 
Tomorrow’s plan is to go 17 miles to a campground near the trail. They have food and will pick up hikers. The elevation profile ‘looks easy’ but it often lies. I hope the smooth tread continues as well.

First night out on a hike I don’t sleep well and last night was no exception. That’s alright. I was up around 6, packed up, ate some oatmeal and was walking by 730. The woman who offered the ride to the brewery next week reiterated to call when at that crossing. To a brewery?  Ok. 
The terrain was gradual ups and downs most of the day. Few rocks and virtually no roots makes for pleasant hiking. After a few miles the trail began to parallel the Blue Ridge Parkway. This went on for about 6 miles and a few places went by viewing areas for cars to stop. The views were good but the skies were a bit hazy today. Like yesterday it got very warm in the afternoon up to around 80° and humid. Near the Blue Ridge Parkway I encountered a deer on the trail. It wasn’t interested in moving to let me pass and I was only about 10 feet from it. I snapped a few pictures of it and it finally moved off trail and I proceeded on. It had absolutely no fear of me. After one final short but steep incline the rest of the day was smooth or lightly rolling hills and eventually a long downhill to my destination for the night.
At the destination I tried to call Middle Creek Campground for a ride but was unable to get through. It’s about 1.5 miles of road walking. Without a ride I wasn’t as interested. While sitting on the bridge that crosses the river there, a couple pulled over and asked if I needed a ride. It turns out they are hiking the trail using two cars and switching cars and moving to their next area. It’s kind of a convoluted way to do it but it does work out very well and you always have a ride if needed. They took me up to the campground, thank you, where I got checked in. Got a quick shower, set up my tent and am now relaxing next to the creek. I was able to get a cheeseburger, a beer, and a vanilla milkshake. It all hit the spot. Hiking’s  tough. 
Looking at my guide, rather than go back where I came from I can actually take a dirt road from this campground and it will lead me to a blue blaze trail that eventually meets up with the AT. I was able to confirm this as thru hiker Twig showed up coming from the road I plan to take in the morning   The part of the trail that I’ll be missing is a pointless up and down (PUD).  The distance it will take me to get to the blue blaze trail and back on the AT is about the same as what I would do if I stayed on the trail and walked the PUD. So, distance wise I’m good, but I will have skipped a small section of trail. I am not a purist about these things so I am not too concerned about it.
Overall, today was an excellent hiking day. A little bit long for my second day out but the terrain was very pleasant and made the task that much easier. Tomorrow’s plan is to climb Apple Orchard Mountain. This looks like a sustained 6 to 7 mile climb. It may not be steep but it sure will be long. I hope the tread is similar to the last two days because it has been excellent. The forecast for the next 5 days is rain but I think it is hit or miss. And on a side-note, thanks to the trail maintainers, as I have yet to hit a blow down across the trail that I was not able to step over.

It rained for about 2 hours last night after the sun went down. It sounded torrential in the tent but I think it was just a steady shower. I slept ok, not great but probably got 5 hours in. I get a bit antsy getting into the tent early so I read for awhile and checked the guide. 
Started packing up just after 630, in the dark. Skipped breakfast and had a protein bar, and headed up the road at 710. The road went up about a mile then went left for .7 to the blue blaze trail to get back on the AT. This 2.5 miles is less than the 4 miles if i had gone back to where I left off yesterday. Plus, I would have had to walk back to that spot. Maybe if I am in this area in the future I will cover that short section. 
The trail today was predominantly up. Maybe 80% of the time I was climbing. Some of it was steep in places but overall it wasn’t unbearable. The immediate goal was to get to Apple Orchard Mountain. This would be a climb of about 3000 feet while on the trail and probably close to 3500 from the campground I stayed at last night.  Water would be an issue today as well. The first 4.5 miles were all up. Nothing to see as the trail was always in the woods. Just below that first summit I stopped in to Cornelius Creek Shelter. The water was low but flowing nicely. I topped off my bottles and added another liter in my water scoop bag just in case. Next up was Black Rock Overlook. Nice views, likely to the north. 2 more miles of rolling hills with some rocky stretches brought me to the base of the climb to Apple Orchard Mountain. After the first short rocky section of the climb, the grade got a little gentler but still up. I eventually reached the cleared summit with the giant golf ball. Actually, it’s an FAA communications site. I found a rock to relax on and eat some lunch. Just when I finished a day hiker came by. Nice guy, and a talker. 
After lunch and a chat, I pressed on the short distance to the Thunder Hill Shelter. On the way I went through ‘The Guillotine’, a famous AT landmark. I arrived at the shelter at 2. I was undecided about staying since it was so early. However, tomorrow I am going in to Glasgow, VA and stay at a hostel. They have a resupply box I sent before leaving home. If I keep going today I’ll get to the road too early and have to hitch or wait for the hostel shuttle at 5. Timing and distance work out better if I just stay here. Plus, there is water, a privy and picnic table. I am right on with my initial schedule. 
And then at about 6, the rains came. There’s about 10 hikers in and around the shelter. Some cooking dinner when the rain hit. One advantage of getting to your destination early. 
There were many more SOBO thru hikers today. I usually step aside and let them pass. I also noticed the incredible volume of acorns on the ground and how many are constantly falling off the trees. Squirrel paradise yet there’s very few. And, when they hit the shelter roof, it’s loud!
Tomorrow it’s about 15 miles to where I hope to get a ride and get cleaned up and do laundry.  Luckily, it’s almost all down hill.

A good day today. The rain stopped by 8 last night, but the acorns continued to hit the shelter roof. I got used to it pretty quick. The shelter dwellers started stirring at about 6am.  Once 1 person gets up, everyone gets up. I packed up, ate a couple of oatmeal packets and was on my way. 
Today was 80% downhill. Most of the tread was good with only a few rocky areas. A lot of flat spots were a pea gravel that is great to hike on. It was overcast or foggy all day so no views, not that there would have been many anyways   There were 2 climbs that were fairly steep but not too long. After about 10 miles it was all down to the James River. This is a very large river. There is a footbridge across it which is longest foot only bridge on the AT. When I got across the shuttle driver was waiting, but not for me. I had passed the hiker he was waiting for and knew she would be a while. So he took me to the hostel. 
Stanimal’s Hostel is basically a house converted to a hostel. It’s clean, has everything a hiker needs, and the guys running it are very nice. I got a shower, did laundry, organized my food drop and went out for dinner (at the only restaurant in town). In 5 days I will likely stay at Stanimal’s in Waynesboro. 
Tomorrow is again mostly uphill. There is a 9 mile section with no water. I will have to top off my bottles and fill my scoop bag. This will be a heavy carry with both full water and full food. And uphill. That’s ok. It is what it is. I’ll just have to eat a lot tomorrow to lighten the load.

It’s nice when the plan I put together a month ago fails up. But more on that later. 
I didn’t sleep well at the hostel. I think the Mt. Dew I had with dinner may have contributed to that. I know not to have caffeine too late but did not heed my own advice. After getting back from the (only) restaurant, Charlie, the caretaker of the hostel made peach cobbler with ice cream. Then in the morning he makes pancakes. Both he and his helper, Longwalker, do a good job. I particularly like that they keep the house real clean. 
3 of us were on the 7am shuttle back to the James River trailhead and I was walking before 720. Right off the bat the trail was . . .Care to guess?  . . . Wrong. It was flat for the first mile. You guessed up I’ll bet.  Then, it was up and up and up. Overall the climb was 2700 feet spread over 3 peaks. Of course you have to drop between the peaks meaning more climbing. The first peak was by far the longest climb. Then after a short drop it was up the 2nd peak which was by far the steepest. Then a few miles of relatively flat terrain lead to the 3rd climb which was somewhat in between. No views at all today as I was in the clouds all morning or thick woods in the afternoon. The moisture was collecting on the leaves and drenching me with each slight bit of wind. At the summit I drank the Gatorade I lugged with me. From here it was a short down to the Punchbowl Shelter where I ate lunch and was able to talk to the contractor doing our home remodel. 
The Punchbowl was my original planned destination for today. I was not sure what time the shuttle back to the trail would be or how tough the climb would be. Both were in my favor. At 1245 I moved on ignoring my plan. There was another camp area in 5 more miles. When I got there it was only 3 and the site didn’t look so hot. The guide showed the next shelter in 5 miles and gentle terrain. So off I went. The last 2 miles dragged on but I made it at 5. Pretty good time for 20 miles. 
I had a freeze dried spicy chicken curry for dinner. 2 other hikers are here for the night. I suspect some SOBO thrus may show up in the dark. 
I passed only 4 thrus today and 2 more stopped in to eat here at the shelter. Everyone I talk to says there is a big group of SOBOs coming. We’ll see. 
Tomorrow’s plan has 2 options. The day starts with a 2700 foot climb straight up. From there it is (relatively) small ups and downs for 18 miles. There is a shelter at 15.8 and another at 22.4. I know I can do more than the first shelter. But, the second may be too far. We’ll see.

Prior to sleep last night I noticed it was incredibly dark out. Maybe the low clouds and new moon. It rained hard for a bit last night. I was actually sleeping well and it woke me. That’s ok, we need the rain. The springs and creeks have been better the past 2 days. 
Unlike yesterday, today really did start . . . Up. 2700 feet. It was tough but I thought easier than yesterday. Today was continuous up. I think mentally you just get it done vs. yesterday where there were downs and flats between peaks. Or maybe just personal preference. Again, the clouds sat on me, soaking the leaves and dripping. I made the peak quickly. I left the shelter at 815 and was at the summit before 11. I have now completed 3 of the 4 big climbs on this hike. 
Now, a sidebar on mountain names. The long climb today was up Bald Mountain. Picture a large open field at the top, some grasses, maybe a few scattered small trees. No!  This Bald Mountain is a viewless tree covered summit. In the clouds I would not have even known it was the summit without my guide. Now, just 2 miles further I go up Cole Mountain. Probably going to be just a high point covered in trees and rocks. No!  This is a bald summit with grasses and views (limited due to low clouds). What gives?  Maybe a little southern moonshine involved with the namers?
The rest of the day was along rolling ridges and typical forest. Nice walking for the most part. I came out at Salt Log Gap where a few forest service roads intersect. There was a guy there looking lost and confused because he couldn’t figure out which road to take to get to the river he wanted to fly fish in. I got him steered in the right direction. 
I got to the shelter at 4. A bit early but there’s no way I would have made it to the next shelter. There are camp sites but I suspect it will rain again tonight. I’m the only one here now but I know of at least 1 hiker planning to stop here. 
Tomorrow should be fairly easy as it is rolling hills then a long down. I am trying to set myself up to get into the Devils Backbone Brewery on Saturday. It is supposed to rain a lot Saturday so I don’t know if camping at the brewery is a good idea. I will try to go for lunch then get a ride back to the trail for a few miles. We’ll see how it goes.

A lot to relay so this entry may be long. Last night was strange. I was alone at the shelter but that doesn’t bother me. It was foggy and the trees were dripping moisture. A very ominous feeling. Acorns and other nuts were falling out of the trees. The drips and drops made it sound like someone was shuffling their feet. It was incredibly dark again. I woke up around 1 to pee, and lo and behold, the sky was crystal clear with stars, the air was dry, and maybe I’d see the sun in the morning. I awoke before 6 and you know what happened?  Thick fog. A bit disappointing. But, when hiking you make the most of it. 
I left the shelter at 650 in the dark with head lamp on. There were many deer out near the trail. I sent them all running while I jumped a little each time they took off. The ground really shakes when they scurry. The first 6.6 miles would get me to the Priest shelter over some rolling hills. They weren’t that large but I found them very challenging both ups and downs. I don’t know why because I felt good. At one point I climbed above the clouds and did see the sun. I was at a viewpoint called Spy Rock. I took the long .1 side trail and was rewarded with great views of the surrounding mountains and the clouds down below. The Priest Shelter is within the Priest Wilderness area. The shelter has a reputation where hikers attempt to document their sins while on trail in the shelter logbook. Usually this is mostly comedy and silly type things. It’s very entertaining to read this logbook to see what people have come up with. Unfortunately, the logbook was changed out just a few weeks ago. Usually the north bounders put some very interesting comments in that logbook but I didn’t get the opportunity to see them. So be it. Not being a thru hiker I chose not to sign this logbook. I had a tortilla with tunafish as a snack at the shelter.
From the Priest Shelter it’s a short climb up to the summit of the Priest. From there it is approximately 5 miles all downhill to get to the Tye River. Now things start to get a little strange. While at the shelter a southbound hiker came in and mentioned that there were some dogs hanging around the summit with no people there. She said they were friendly and there wasn’t anything to worry about. Really, on the trail dogs can be the scariest animals you encounter. When I got to the summit, the dogs were there. There were three of them. Some kind of hound, probably a bear hound. They looked a little like tall beagles. They were emaciated with ribs showing. Each of them had on a very expensive looking radio collar. Clearly, these dogs have to be hunting dogs and were lost. All three of them were skinny but at least they were friendly. I started down the mountain and now I had three followers. I kept checking on them to see if they were going to leave and go back where they came from but they seemed more interested in following me. One of them was very friendly and kept right on my heels. The other two were a bit more standoffish but continued to follow. After about 2 miles of rugged rocky downhill, other hikers were coming uphill. At this point my new companions disappeared. I suspect they simply climbed back to the top of the mountain with these other hikers. When I got down to the parking area at the Tye river I was hoping to see a sign about lost dogs. There was no such information so off I went.
Once at the bottom the trail crosses a Virginia highway then crosses on a suspension bridge across the Tye River and begins to climb up. At this point I had done 11 miles. My initial goal was to reach the Harper River shelter. That would take another 3 miles of hiking and over 1000 feet elevation gain. The grade in this area is very steep. I also now entered the Three Ridges wilderness area. Once I got to the shelter I was beat. However, it was only 230 and that’s far too early to stop. The problem was that it was over 6 miles up over the Three Ridges peak to the next shelter. Furthermore, it is all uphill, over 2000 feet of steep grade. The grade mildly bothered me but the terrain would crush me. After a quick snack and some fluids, I started up. I was doing well for a while but then the dreaded rocks showed up. There were cliff climbs, rock climbs, all kinds of climbs. Rocks were loose and solid and went on in places for tenths of a mile and were very challenging. I spoke to a few folks coming down this mountain and they said I had a long way to go in a lot of rocks. But, I committed to going over the mountain now so I had to do it. It took over two hours to climb those 2000 feet but I finally made it to the summit with a lot of choice words coming out of my mouth along the way. One other thought on the climb up the Three Ridges peak. I mentioned yesterday that I had four climbs that were large on this trip and I had completed three of them. I can easily say that the first three climbs were for the rookies, they were weak compared to this climb. This mountain reminded me a lot of the Smokies or Georgia for the steep terrain and the rugged jagged rocks. After the summit, it was about 2 1/2 more miles to reach the shelter for the night. The terrain down initially was very rocky like the ascent. After about a mile the rocks eased a bit and I was able to move more quickly. I arrived at the shelter at approximately 6 PM. It was still light enough to get all my chores done before dark. I gathered water, set up my tent, cooked my Mountainhouse meal, and I’m now laying in my tent while I write this. I chose to tent because the shelter was damp and there were reports of spiders.
Today was a very long challenging day, but in a good way. I enjoy challenging myself when I am out here. It keeps me just a little bit out of my comfort zone and that’s what I enjoy.
Tomorrow’s plan is now changed a bit. I am only 2 miles from the road that can take me to the Devil’s Backbone brewery. At that point I will either hitch a ride to the brewery and have lunch and a few beers or I will call the trail Angel i met last week to give me a ride. I will be in no rush in the morning because it should only take me about an hour to get to that trail head. At this point I am undecided whether or not I will stay overnight at the brewery’s camping area or get a ride back to the trail and continue on. Unfortunately, the brewery no longer provides shuttle rides to hikers. I have been told that it is 5 miles all uphill from the brewery to the trail head, not something I have any desire to walk. I suspect I will just play it by ear.

Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth. No violence here but the plans got changed up. 
I was sleeping well last night when a group of hikers came in at about midnight. They weren’t overly loud but they all had their headlamps on max and struggled with the bear pole. Once they got set up things quieted down. I thought it was a large group of SOBO thru hikers. While eating breakfast I saw it was a church group of 20 kids and adult leaders. I should have set up my tent further away. Also, it rained lightly a good part of the night. The constant dampness, mist, rain and sweat has given me quite a funky aroma. I badly need a shower and to do laundry. 
My plan was to go 1.8 miles to the road and get a ride to the Devil’s Backbone brewery. I took my time packing up and left just about 9. It was an easy walk to the road. However, I was unable to get a ride the 5 miles to the brewery. I waited around for 30 minutes and decided to take that punch. I wandered around the parking area until I got enough cell signal and called Stanimal’s Hostel in Waynesboro, VA. They had a bunk available so I arranged a pickup at 2 at a Blue Ridge Parkway (BRP) pullout in 5.8 miles. I really wanted to try that brewery but I don’t know if I could have enjoyed it with my stench. I certainly would have scared other customers. So on I hiked. 
This short section sucked. It was very rocky. And the rocks are very slippery whet wet and covered with moss. It wasn’t steep, just real slow going. I arrived at the crossing just before 1. My ride showed up at about 150 and got me to the hostel. 
I got cleaned up, laundry done, and went to an excellent Mexican place. It was a combination restaurant, pool hall and Latin supermarket. But very good food. 
Tomorrow I am going to shuttle back to where I stopped today and slack pack forward. Slack pack is where you borrow a small day pack and only carry a few essentials. This allows you to move quickly (assuming minimal rocks) with less strain on the body. I need to go about 14.3 miles to Rockfish Gap, the southern entrance to Shenendoah National Park (SNP). Then I will stay at the hostel another night. Also, the forecast going forward is looking much better. I’ll believe it when I see it.

Slack packing is nice. I was up early but the ride wasn’t until 8. I made some eggs and bacon for breakfast. I was back at Dripping Rock parking area and hiking at 845. 
With the light load the rocky gradual ascent was not too bad. The rocky trail went on for about 3 miles. After that, the rest of the day, 11 miles, was very easy. It was cloudy and rainy again and everything was soaked. The sun showed up for about 10 minutes early in the afternoon. With the low grey clouds there were no views. I stopped at a shelter for a quick lunch then pushed on. I made it to my pickup spot by 230 and was at the hostel just after 3. A good day overall. 
I got a shower and will do laundry again so I start with non-stinky clothes tomorrow. The forecast is great. Hopefully it it accurate. I will head out for a food resupply soon and find some dinner. 
I’m about 1 day ahead of my original plan. If the Shenendoahs are as easy walking as the last 11 miles today, I should be doing near 20 mile days through the park.

Only 4 or 5 hikers at the hostel last night. Much quieter and easier to get into the bathroom. I was up by 6. I got packed up, inhaled some Pop Tarts, grabbed a Gatorade and was driven to the trailhead at Rockfish Gap. I was hiking by 710 into Shenendoah National Park (SNP). The first 6 miles was up over rocky terrain. I also had to fill out a permit upon entering SNP. Once I made the ridge the rocks lasted about another mile then smooth sailing. I was going to go into the first shelter to eat lunch but it was .3 off trail. Too far so I kept going. I ended up eating lunch at one of the Skyline Drive pullouts. Unfortunately, there would be no water for 13 miles at the shelter I would stay at. The trail crossed Skyline Drive many times and will continue to do so the length of the park. 
SOBOs had said the trail in SNP was like someone raked it and cleared the rocks. At times that almost seemed true. There were many ups and downs but they were all gradual. And the sun tried to make an appearance around 3. 
A couple times I came across deer in the trail. They had no fear or interest in me. I did startle 1 that scared me when it jumped away. No bears or Bigfoot. 
Tomorrow the trail grade looks good. I will stop at the Loft Mountain camp store for an ice cream and drinks. I won’t need to carry as much water because I can top off there.  There are 2 possible shelters tomorrow. One at 13 and one at 21. I’ll just wing it and choose when I need to.

Big day. I was up at 640. A bit late for me but it’s real obvious the days are getting shorter. Sunrise is not until about 730. I had a Pop Tart, packed up and was out the door. There were 2 huts today but one was too short and the other too far (I thought).
As every morning, the fog was thick. It’s a half mile climb out of the hut (notice they are huts, not shelters, in SNP) to the top of Blackrock Mountain. At the top there is a huge pile of boulders. The view from the top would be excellent if not for the fog. I passed on the tough rock climb over wet jagged boulders for no view. 
From there the trail was mostly flat for about 7 miles to the Loft Mountain camp store. The trail goes right by it so I might as well get some snacks. I ate some of my cheese and pepperoni and had one of those ice creams with the 2 chocolate chip cookies and ice cream in the middle. Tasty and lots of calories. I also got a Milky Way and Gatorade for later. After the store, it was a series of short ups and downs to the first shelter. This was at 13.4 miles. Good distance but it was before 2. Way too early to stay. So I topped off my water and continued for 8.2 more miles. These miles were a series of 3 peaks each progressively longer. There were some areas that were surprisingly steep. By this time the fog was settling back down, humidity was way up and the sweat was pouring out of me. I also crossed Skyline Drive about 10 times today. I got to the shelter at about 530. I was going to stay in the shelter but it looked like there may have been recent mouse activity. Tent it is. There are 5 other hikers tented around me. 
It was a good day but the climbs were tough. 22 miles in these hills is about my limit, especially with the shorter days. Tomorrow I would like to go 20.5 and get to the Big Meadows campground. There is a lodge with a restaurant and tap room nearby as well. The climbs look smaller so I should be able to make it.

Another big day. Last night was incredibly foggy. The moisture was dripping profusely off the trees. I was up about 615 and could barely see with my headlamp to pee. I broke down camp, ate a Pop Tart, topped off my water and was hiking by 725. 
There was little noteworthy during the day today other than the sun. The fog burned off quickly and most of the morning was sunny. Unfortunately, the trail did not take me to any views. The drier air was welcome. 
Before 1 I stopped on trail and ate the last of my cheese and pepperoni as well as some M&Ms. After lunch there were two long climbs. Water was scarce and I hadn’t eaten enough, and I could tell. But once I reached my destination I would resolve both. At the summit of the final climb of the day I was rewarded with a nice view to the west. After that it was just get there. 
I arrived at the Big Meadows Campground about 430. Checked in at the ranger station and got a site. I set up my tent and sleeping gear. I then had a 2 wet wipe shower to get the salt and funk off of me. It actually worked pretty well. I put on my clean (formal?) clothes and headed up to the lodge. There is indeed a taproom in the basement of the lodge. It’s quite good for being in a National Park. I had a personal pizza, a very large piece of blackberry ice cream pie, and an assortment of craft beers. That was a quick 2500 calories that I definitely needed. 
It’s a bit chillier tonight, probably due to less moisture in the air. My next resupply will be Front Royal, VA in about 45 miles. After 3 20+ mile days I will back it off a bit and try to get to a hostel on Saturday. Tomorrow I should be able to stop at the Skyland Resort for lunch. That should give me the fuel for the afternoon. 
The trail in SNP has been excellent. I just wish there were more views to make the climbs worth the effort. 
It’s 8pm. I am beyond exhausted. 3 straight 20 mile days will do that to an old guy. And, there was trail magic when I got back to my tent. Someone left a protein bar on my tent. That’s it. Good night.

The campground worked out fine although there were some kids up until about 2. I started stirring at the usual time of about 630 but laid in the tent a while as I was in no rush. When I finally got out, everything was soaked. The condensation was incredible. I shook the tent and ground cloth out to lose some moisture but it wasn’t doing much. I ate some Pop Tarts and a breakfast bar, packed up, topped off my water and was hiking by 830. Late for me. 
Today was wonderfully sunny. Warm with a slightly cool breeze. The terrain was good all morning with gentle up and downs and few rocks. I should have felt good but was just tired. I’ll blame it on the 3 previous long days. Today did have some great long range views to the west. 
About noon I got to the Skyland Resort. There was a wacky detour due to some water work near the resort. Signage was tough to follow. I eventually found the restaurant and got right in. I had a meatball sub, fries and blackberry lemonade. It was all good. I was also able to get a freeze dried meal for tonight, a 3 Musketeers bar and a Gatorade. The sun was warm so I took out my tent and ground cloth and let them dry off. Around 2 I hit the trail. 
It would be only 6.5 miles to the Hut for the night. It was a long 6.5. Very rocky terrain the whole way. The rocks wear you down and slow you down. On the plus side there were quite a few great rock outcrops looking west into the valley. 
I arrived at 445, set up in the shelter and ate the freeze dried meal. Water was .3 miles down a very steep forest road. It was flowing great but that walk back up was the toughest climb of the day. 
I plan to go 17 miles tomorrow. I need to set myself up to get into Front Royal, VA as early as possible on Saturday because a line of thunderstorms is forecasted for early afternoon. At least if I am close I won’t be on any open ridges. The hostel I wanted to stay at is full so I will have to find a ride to town to stay at the Super 8.

The other guy staying in the shelter last night planned to get up at 530. That was fine by me as I wanted the option to get to the next shelter or continue on and stealth camp further up trail. I was up when his alarm went off. I packed up, took care of all the usual morning chores then waited a bit for some light. I could hike by headlamp only but no need. After about 20 minutes I was hiking. It was about 640. 
The trail started with a short rocky climb to the summit of Mary’s Rock. There were some good views to the west into the valley prior to the sun rising. On the way down, the rocks got worse. I started thinking this may end up being a miserably slow day. Luckily, after about 2 more miles the rocks stopped. There wouldn’t be any more really rocky sections the rest of the day. 
My first goal was to get to the SNP Elkwallow Wayside. It was just under 12 miles. Once the rocks were done I was really moving. The grade was quite easy all the way to the Wayside. I got there before 1130. There’s a grill and a small store. I got a cheeseburger, fries and the SNP famous blackberry milkshake. They were all good. I needed the calories. I had been hearing about these milkshakes for some time. It was good, not great. I also got a large Gatorade to take with me. That was a mistake as it was very heavy. I was also able to put a bit of charge into my electronics. I only need 1 more day until town. 
I left the Wayside before 1. I felt like I was struggling after all that food. The terrain was easy and I got to the shelter turnoff about 315. I hemmed and hawed about what to do. I knew I would tent because this shelter probably has a couple of bats living in it. I finally decided to stay. Down the side trail I went and . . . WHAM!  Down to the ground I went. Landed on my left wrist and I think my left chest caught a (luckily) flat rock not far out of the ground. Both are sore but nothing seems broken. There was a large stick in the trail. I guess my shoelace may have gotten caught around it and to the ground I went. A couple of Ibuprofen (vitamin I) should help. I suspect in the morning I won’t be happy. I’ve hiked around 1500 miles now and this is the first ‘real’ fall I’ve had. Not too bad. 
The tent sites at this shelter area are pretty lousy. Small and up a rocky trail. Oh well, it is what it is. 
So the wind and rain are forecast for about 1 tomorrow. I hope to wake early and get moving. I plan to make it out of the park and to either the road to Front Royal or just beyond to the hostel that was full. I have a reservation at the Super 8 and the woman I spoke to at the hostel implied they could shuttle me there. If not, I’ll find a local shuttle person to get me there. 
Until tomorrow.

The tent sites around this hut we’re pretty lousy. They were small, rocky and up a rocky trail. I was afraid of killing myself stepping out of the tent. Combine that with sore ribs and it was clear I should have continued on yesterday. 
Every time I moved in the tent my ribs screamed. A bruise hurts more the next day than when you hurt it. That was very true today. I got packing before 6 and just left. I had water and would eat some breakfast bars when it was light out. I was walking by 640. It was a climb to start but not long or steep. There were some views at the top, similar to yesterday. From there it would be almost all downhill today. The tread was good all the way to the SNP boundary. On the climbs, leaning over, my ribs hurt a lot. Down and flats were not too bad. Shallow breathing was the key. 
Heavy rain was due at noon. I kept up a good pace all day. I got to the kiosk for the SNP permit. Deposited my copy in the box. About a quarter mile later was the sign for the official park boundary. Then the rocks showed up in force. I just had to laugh. Either the park boundaries were set based on the terrain or the rocks were cleared from the trail. All I know is the trail in SNP is pristine in most places. And the club that maintains that section does a great job. Also, I did 12 by 12.  Meaning I hiked 12 (actually 12.5) miles before noon.
I got to the road crossing for Front Royal but continued on to the B&B Hostel I had hoped to stay at. Maybe there was a cancellation. No such luck. I did have a glass of very tasty lemonade and Lisa was kind enough to bring me into town to the Super 8. The rain started in force 5 minutes after I got to the B&B. Good timing. 
I did a small resupply at the market and went to the brewery for beers and dinner. The brewery has a room with washer, dryer and shower for hikers, all free. All was good because my clothes stunk. I have coordinated a ride back to the trail in the morning. 
4 days to go. I am going to set my mileage for the next 2 days to try and stay at the Bear’s Den Hostel. Everyone has been saying good things about it. That would leave me 2 short days into Harpers Ferry. The weather is supposed to be excellent the next 4 days. Day 5 is rain all day. We’ll see how it goes and if my ribs are up to it. 
Until tomorrow.","Gravel Springs Hut

The Super 8 worked out fine but pricey.  Very convenient to everything. My ride showed up 5 minutes early and I was hiking by 8. It was a day of no views. At all. Just walking through the woods. The terrain was mostly mild with a few rocky areas. I made good time all day. The ribs still hurt but at least not on every step like yesterday. 
I rolled into the shelter at 330. There are now 5 in the shelter and 2 hammocks set up out back. Took care of chores and am in my bag at 7. 
The weather today was finally fall. Cool, breezy and clear with just a little bite in the air. It’s cold tonight. I put on my long underwear that I’ve been carrying and I may need my puffy jacket to sleep in. 
Tomorrow I hope to push to get to Bear’s Den hostel. That’s 18+ miles. The first half should be easy. The second half is the Rollercoaster. More on that in tomorrow’s entry.

It wasn’t a buzz saw. It was more of a chain saw that never needed to refuel. A guy in the shelter last night snored ALL night. No breaks, no roll over and pause, constant. Rather miserable. I was up and packing early. I just wanted to get out of there. I was hiking by 650 and glad to move on. 
The climb back to the trail was tough then a gradual climb to Sky Meadow State Park. Nice sunrise. From there it was a gradual descent to US50. A few more miles of easy ups and downs got me to the start of the Rollercoaster. This is where you put your pack in a cart and it’s wheeled along a track for you. Or, it’s a series of steep but relatively short (?) ups and downs with lots of rocks. I completed 9.6 miles of the 15 in the coaster. It was tough but no worse than some sections of GA or southern NC. No views at all, again. 
At the summit of the current peak is the Bear’s Den Hostel. The former home of a doctor, it was sold at his death to a development company. They had grand plans but couldn’t get something to do with septic systems approved and gave up. Eventually it and the property were purchased by the ATC and now the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club maintains it as a hostel. Nice stone building and nice grounds. I got the whole deal: bunk, shower, laundry, pizza, soda, ice cream, all for $35.  Pretty good. I was going to walk to a nearby brewery but it was dark and down a busy road  so I came back to the hostel and finished my ice cream.
I was going to finish tomorrow with a 20 mile day. That would mean rushing all day. Instead I will go about 15 miles to a listed tent spot. Then I will have 4 miles into Harpers Ferry the next day. I’ll take the 1130 train into DC where J will pick me up at a metro station. Retirement and flexibility go hand in hand.

The hostel worked out well. I slept better. Certainly compared to the previous night. In the morning they have pancake mix and a griddle so you can make your own. I made 5 large ones and inhaled them all. I gathered up my things and hit the trail at 820. 
It was a perfect hiking weather day. Cool with a light breeze and sunny. Right back on the trail and there is Bears Den Rock which has a good view to the west. From there it’s back to the Rollercoaster. I had 4.5 more miles of the ups and downs with 4 peaks to make. There was a nice view at Raven Rock but the rest was in the forest. The trail for much of the morning was very slow and rocky. 
Once out of the coaster, the elevation changes the rest of the day were minimal. With one exception. I planned to stop for the night at a dry campsite. I stopped at the David Lesser shelter to get water. The spring was .25 all down steep trail from the shelter. Neither down or up were fun. But now I have water to get me to Harpers. After the shelter the trail really flattened out and the rocks were minimal for about 6 miles. My feet were happy. The I crossed the road at Keys Gap and they started up again in force. The last 2 miles to the tent site were rough. I was tired and sick of the rocks. The tent site is right next to the trail and quite flat. Some deer were wandering nearby while I was eating dinner. I hear something moving in the trees near me I should check out. . . . More deer. I’m in my tent ready for bed at 6pm.  Yikes!
Today was tough. The rocks really take their toll, both on the feet and tiredness.  
Tomorrow is a short 4.2 miles, mostly downhill into Harpers Ferry. I need to be there by 11 and it should take about 2 hours, depending on the rocks. I already bought a ticket for the Capitol Express to Union Station. I’ve hiked enough. 
BTW, the ribs still hurt but continue to improve.

The final hiking day. The campsite was fine last night. It was a full moon and the sky was clear so it was bright all night. I was up early, as always, and packed up quickly. I noticed on my phone I had a new voicemail. Cell coverage was great at the campsite. It was Amtrak telling me there was a delay. No information about how long so not very useful. Without an estimate of the delay I still needed to get to town. 
The first 2 miles were very rocky but flat. Slow going. The rocks subsided and the trail headed down. Eventually I crossed a major highway bridge over the Shenandoah River. I then turned towards town and up. 
Once near town I had good cell coverage again so I downloaded the Amtrak app hoping it would give me the length of the delay. It did. 2+ hours. So, I would see the town. I went to the ATC office in town. Checked out the college for former slaves, walked around the old cemetery and walked through the old Armory. I still got to town by 10. I got a snack and soda and hung out in the warm sun. Checking the app often, the delay kept increasing. 
I got some lunch and a beer, wandered some more and got a milkshake. I finally headed to the station to wait. The train showed up almost 3 hours late. That seems to be the norm on this line. Oh well. The ride was nice but slow. I learned the delays are because the freight rail companies own the track. They are supposed to give Amtrak some priority but don’t. We got to Union Station about 5. I went to the Metro station and hopped on the red line then switched to the silver line. My ride was waiting for me at the end of the line. Dinner, a couple of beers and bed was calling by 9, like on the trail. 
It was a good hike overall for 19 days. I ended up 2 days ahead of my plan. I definitely underestimated mileage for a couple of days coming out of towns. I had great weather overall, some humid foggy days to start then brilliant sunny days to end. I never hiked in rain, although it did rain some at night. The one day it did rain hard I had just made it to the B&B outside Front Royal. 
I have now completed through Duncannon, PA. Perhaps next year I’ll pick up there and do battle with the rocks of eastern PA. 
Until next hike.","4 Mile Campsite
