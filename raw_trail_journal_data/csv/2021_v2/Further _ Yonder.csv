Further & Yonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633278,"Almost a year later and we are ready to try this again. Our proposed start date this time around is 3/28/21 but I won’t fully believe it until we actually set foot on Springer.
For those of you just following us for the first time we had tried to do this last year but the pandemic happened before we could even get started. All the basic info on us can be found in last year’s journal here … https://www.trailjournals.com/journal/entry/625278 and from a local newspaper article from last April here … https://www.metrowestdailynews...

Yonder has secured a leave of absence from her job and I just left my job (something I have been wanting to do for awhile now). Somehow we also managed to rent out our house for most of the time we'll be gone which is a huge relief financially (especially since I no longer have a job)!
All we have left to do now is get all our gear figured out, put together all of our mail drops and pack up all of our belongings so that the renters can move in.

Further & Yonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633327,"This third post should trigger the journal to go live so hopefully our next post will actually be from the trail.
Things have quickly begun to fall into place and it looks like this is really going to happen this time. Finally! We were in a similar situation last year when the pandemic ruined all of our plans so I am not taking anything for granted. But we are less than two weeks away now so it’s looking pretty good.

Our friends Doug & Lynda have once again agreed to drive up from Florida, pick us up from the Atlanta airport, shuttle us around and hike the first couple of miles on the trail with us. It will be great to share the start with good friends and it also takes a lot of the stress out of having to find a shuttle service. We will still have plenty of opportunities down the trail to enjoy the whole finding a shuttle thing.

We do still have some stuff to figure out with our gear but we have the basics. Our biggest problem now is that we are second guessing everything. Our packs will likely weigh somewhere around 30-35lbs each with food and water. By today’s standards this is on the heavy side but we don’t have unlimited funds to spend on all the overly pricey ultra-light gear and we might not even like it anyway. Unfortunately our local gear shop does not carry some of the specialty gear that we covet (z-packs, hyperlite, etc) so we don’t have a good way to try these things out to make sure we like them. Instead we will be using most of the gear we have already been relying on during our section hikes which we know will work even though it might not all be the latest and greatest and lightest.

Well that’s it for the pre-hike info. Right now we are busy dehydrating, bagging food into ziplocks, and boxing up maildrops so no more journal entries until we are actually on the trail.

To save money we paid for a tent site instead of a room or bunks and was still able to take full advantage of the showers, laundry and free shuttle to town. We were excited to stop in to the nearby brewery but it was closed because today just happened to be Easter Sunday. Instead we went to the grocery store and loaded up at the salad bar to counteract all the trail food we’ve been eating. After buying some more food for the next few days we shuttled back to the hostel and hung out with all the other hikers. We learned that some people have already quit their thru hikes by now which seems unbelievable to me since the trail has been awesome everyday so far.

Pretty much everyone we talked to were planning on taking a “zero” today to avoid the projected rain. We decided to risk it and get out of town before spending any more money.

Ron from Baltimore Jacks where we stayed last night drove us back to the trail and we were hiking again by 10am. It started raining by 11am and was off and on light rain for the next few hours. Not bad at all really and the temperature was perfect for hiking so we had a much better day than expected. The other bonus is that we got ahead of the bubble we were trapped in so it was not crowded on the trail or at our chosen campsite for the evening which we had all to ourselves.

As we were choking down the last bites of our oatmeal a trail angel named Lucky Moon came walking up to setup for a morning of feeding hungry hikers as they passed on by. If we had only slept in a bit longer we could have had eggs instead of the oatmeal we are already quickly becoming sick of. 
Later in the day we reached the top of Wayah Bald and found a nice parking area with bathrooms and trash cans. Yonder gets excited for bathrooms on the trail and I get excited when I can get rid of trash and lighten the pack. It’s funny what simple things you get excited about when backpacking. Or maybe we are just weird. 
After a long break on top of Wayah we stumbled into more trail magic when we came across a group calling themselves a frontier brigade dressed up in pre civil war garb and cooking up fresh chili and biscuits.
Worried about the heavy rains predicted overnight we arranged to stay at another hostel even though we had just stayed in one just a couple nights ago. The term on the trail for this is “Platinum Blazing”. If we keep this up we will run out of money before we get to the end of our hike.

It would have made more sense to stay overnight tonight at the NOC which is what most of the other hikers near us were doing.

Near the end of the day the rain let up as we climbed above the clouds and got some incredible views. Another great day on the AT!

Today’s highlights include a river crossing, a steep rock scramble and getting our tent setup just in time for the rain (we weren’t so lucky the previous night though). Lowlights include the bugs that have finally found us on this trip. We have carried bug head nets for almost a 1000 miles and today was the first time we actually needed them.

One bad thing though is that we are almost completely out of food and I spilled most of our dinner into the mud when a big gust of wind came through. Tomorrow we will resupply in the afternoon but will be really hungry by the time we do.

The bug nets got alot of use today except for about an hour when it poured rain in the middle of the day. When we reached the road where our car was parked we were treated to our first trail magic in Maine with cold beer, sodas and ice cream. After resupplying at our car we hiked a little further to Antlers Campsite which is easily the nicest place we have camped this entire trip.

We met a hiker headed south, a SOBO, today with trail name “Greg in Wild”. He was the first PCT thru hiker that Cheryl Strayed met during her PCT hike that she wrote about in her book “Wild”.  He has since also hiked the CDT and is now going for the triple crown with this AT hike.Jo Mary lake is gorgeous and we are camped right next to it.

The highlight of today was our first moose sighting since we have been in the 100 Mile Wilderness. The hiking was a little easier but the bugs and the rain made up for that to make it another challenging day in this section. We finished hiking early today and hid in our tent to avoid one last rain shower.

The hiking was easier (by Maine standards anyway) and we got some awesome views of Katahdin. We got to Abol really early expecting to meet our friends who were planning to pick us up but they were not there and we had no way to reach them because of the lack of cell service. Eventually we got ahold of them using the camp’s satellite phone and they picked us up and drove us to Moosehead Lake for a couple of days off from the trail.

Further & Yonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640490,"I have thought about summiting Katahdin since I was 12 years old and today, 46 years later, it actually happened. The original plan was to hold off on Katahdin until every mile of the AT had been hiked and of course to do it together. Unfortunately neither of those things happened and I summited anyway so now I’m left with mixed emotions and wondering if we made the right choice.
Everyone had told us that summiting this mountain would be hard. Yes, the trail up was challenging, but for us the hardest part by far was in dealing with Baxter State Park’s red tape. We only chose to summit today because they make it so hard to hike up it. Unless you have reserved a campsite or a day pass weeks ahead of time and happen to pick dates with good enough weather you can’t just show up and hike. The exception to this is for long distance hikers who have hiked through The 100 Mile Wilderness or longer. For long distance hikers they allow us to stay at a specific campsite the night before and will only issue you a permit to summit provided you meet their criteria. They also expect you to leave the park immediately unless you happen to have a reserved campsite for a second night which of course nobody does since they have all been sold out for months. 
We also still have close to 200 miles of trail to complete so we definitely jumped the gun on this. As it turned out Yonder did not feel well enough to summit today and eventually decided to turn around at about the halfway point. If she didn’t turn back there would be no way we would have gotten back down in time for our shuttle out since she was hiking slower than usual. Yonder had already summited Katahdin years ago so after successfully dealing with all of Baxter State Park’s red tape and considering the perfect weather today we made the decision for me to keep going to the top without her so that I could finally get my own summit in. It was pretty amazing to be standing on that sign after all these years but I’m still not sure if we made the right decision. It just did not feel right to be up there without my hiking partner.

Unfortunately we have run out of time to get the rest of those 200 miles of trail finished before Yonder is due back at work on Monday. The plan now is to chip away on these final miles over long weekends but it could take us some time as life gets in the way. Once we finally do complete those sections we will reserve a few days in Baxter State Park way ahead of time and will visit that sign on top of Katahdin again but will do it together the way it was meant to be.  

So after 100 days and over 1000 miles our adventure is now over. It is time to re-enter the “real” world (aka The Matrix) and put aside the ramen, snickers and pop-tarts for awhile.

Further & Yonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643722,"Eight weeks after driving home from Katahdin we finally made it back to the trail to start filling in some of those miles that we had to skip over. The goal for this trip is to finally complete the remaining miles in NH and to find out first hand just how hard the ""hardest mile"" on the AT is through the Mahoosuc Notch.
Instead of dealing with shuttles we decided to take two cars. We left one at the Grafton Notch parking area where we plan to finish and then drove together from there to Gorham where we left the other car at our starting point. Getting ready this morning was a bit of a fiasco since we were out of practice and somehow never found the time over these past eight weeks to get ourselves packed and ready ahead of time. I guess some things never change. Luckily most of our gear was still piled together and we had enough left over food for what we needed for this outing. 
It was pushing 4pm by the time we finally stepped onto the trail so we knew we would not be reaching our original goal and would have to stealth camp at an undesignated site. Luckily we found a great spot right as we we running out of daylight where we were able to setup camp. Soon after we started setting up another section hiker named Green Blaze along with his dog Chevy arrived and then in the middle of the night a thru hiker arrived by headlamp. It is hard to imagine night hiking over this part of the trail but the days are getting shorter and alot of hikers are forced to do it.
For dinner we had another round of Further Trail Casserole which, surprisingly, still tasted pretty good even though we had been off of trail food for so long. We quickly fell back into our usual routines and found ourselves happy to be back in the woods again.

Further & Yonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643724,"Soon after getting setup last night it started to rain which continued to come down all night and into the morning. We were not psyched to hike in the rain but luckily by the time we got up it had finally stopped. We quickly packed up the wet tent and hit the trail deciding to eat breakfast later in the morning. Eventually things dried out enough where we were able to find a dry spot at a nice viewpoint where we dried out the tent and cooked up some breakfast. One of our favorite things to do on trail is to have a good breakfast with hot coffee while sitting on top of a mountain looking out over the wilderness so this day was off to a good start.
As we continued on through the last miles of NH we couldn't help but notice how slow we were going. For the second night in a row it was clear that we would not be making our original goal. We almost made it to the Carlo Col campsite before dark but expectantly came upon a treacherous rock scramble that we were too tired to navigate and decided to backtrack to a stealth spot we had noticed a little ways back. After getting setup we were surprised by how many other hikers walked by so late in the day. It seems that we were not the only ones going much slower than planned through this section.

Further & Yonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643726,"After hiking most of the trail (approx 2000 miles so far) over the years, today could very well be the hardest terrain we have faced yet so far on the AT. We have heard about how difficult Maine was going to be and have already experienced some of that in the 100 Mile Wilderness but today was ridiculous. It was also extremely fun and ranks up there as one of my favorite sections.
We started the day in the rain (actually sleet) having to negotiate the treacherous downward rock scramble. After that we soon crossed into Maine where we were greeted by numerous roots, rocks and bogs. Oh boy, the bogs were something else. We are the type of hikers who like to go around the mud and keep our feet dry for as long as possible but that was a losing battle today. These bogs were so crazy deep that if you took a wrong step you could easily be waist deep in the mud. Even though the rain stopped early we hiked with wet feet the entire day due to all the bogs we kept stepping into. Yonder got the worst of it when she decided to trust one of the bog bridges that submerged when she was halfway across it.
By the time we reached the infamous Mahoosuc Notch section we were already tired and it was getting late in the day. For the third day in a row we found ourselves moving too slowly to reach our intended campsite but by now this was no surprise so we had already decided to camp just over the other side of the notch thinking that we would have an early day with plenty of time to relax. But the notch slowed us down so much that it was already dark before we emerged from the other side. It took us over 3 hours to crawl under, climb over, pass our packs through and perform all the required gymnastics to get through the giant boulder field that was the trail. And when it got dark it got that much harder but also somehow even more fun while doing it with headlamps on. By the time we got to the campsite on the other side we were completely exhausted and it was starting to rain again so we quickly setup and ate dinner inside the tent.

Further & Yonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643727,"Any sense of relief from having gotten through Mahoosuc Notch quickly disappeared as we found ourselves hiking equally challenging terrain up the Mahoosuc Arm and over the top of Old Speck on our last day this time out. This was another tough day which got tougher at the end when it started to downpour on us for the last couple of hours of the trip. Maine kicked our asses again today but continued to amaze us as well and is definitely our favorite AT state. Luckily the hike down off of Old Speck was not as crazy as the rest of the trail had been on this trip and we were able to hike quickly through the rain back to where we left our car. By the time we got to the parking area the rain had stopped and the sun had come out. 
After a quick visit to the nearby brewpub we drove back to where we left the other car and headed back home. It was sad to be getting off trail again but we were both so exhausted by the past few days that we were happy to do so. Definitely looking forward to getting back to Maine for more of this but at the same time it's nice to be doing this section in pieces with lots of time to recover in between. A lot of the thru hikers we had met this weekend were just wanting to be done and are not able to fully enjoy what I consider to be the best part of the entire trail. I still think it sucks that we had to end our hike back in July but I am definitely starting to appreciate the advantages of being a section hiker versus a thru hiker, at least for when it comes to these ass kicking sections here in Maine.
