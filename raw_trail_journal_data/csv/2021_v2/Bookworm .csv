In the autumn of 2019, I made the decision to thru-hike the Appalachian Trail. Prior to last September, the thought of quitting my job and temporarily leaving my family for a hike that may take 5-6 months was not something I had previously considered. A few years prior, in fact, the idea would’ve seemed preposterous and impossible. Perhaps crazy. 
However, circumstances are always changing. With our daughter now done with college and embarking on her own and with changes in our financial obligations and standing, such a venture became more possible in recent years. The idea became something worth consideration after an unexpected encounter with a friend: suddenly, the thought of hiking 2193 miles from Georgia to Maine seemed like an adventure I couldn't pass up. And the time to do it was now. A day after running into my friend Dave at the Borderland Music Festival and hearing that he had just finished hiking the Appalachian Trail a few weeks prior, the idea was planted in my mind and began to infect me (dare I make the analogy?) like a virus. Over the next few weeks, I kept considering it and then dismissing the idea. I read and researched, learning as much as I could about what it would entail. This would be very difficult physically and mentally on me and my family. But I was at the point in life when I must either choose to do it or let the idea go. I couldn’t let it go.
I have many reasons to attempt this monumental journey. Some are easier to explain then others; some are nuanced and have always been a part of who I am. Briefly, here are some primary reasons. I’ll elaborate in future posts.
This will be an adventure of a lifetime, a physical and mental challenge; I have always enjoyed the outdoors and the natural world we live in, I like the idea of being immersed and a part of it so completely. I want to see some of the grand vistas of the eastern U.S.; I want to meet new and interesting people; I want to do this for my late  parents, who both loved animals and the outdoors, I’ll carry their spirits with me.
I want to show my son, daughter and granddaughters what's really possible when you put your mind to it, no matter what adversity may get in the way. I want to be my authentic self, as my wonderful wife of 37 years, always encourages me to be. I want to raise awareness and support for Lewy Body Dementia and LBDA in honor of my cousin Tim and everyone else who struggle with this difficult disease. 
I also want to do this just for myself because it's a part of who I am, it’s who I  have always been. I can hear the trail calling  me.

Bookworm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632153,"In preparation for my hike, I’ve read several books, online sources and watched quite a few YouTube videos and movies about thru-hiking the AT. Every hiker’s story is unique. If there's one thing all thru-hikers seem to agree on its that a thru-hike is far from easy. Hiking up mountains to an elevation of up to more than 2000-4000 feet day after day while enduring rain, wind, cold and maybe even some snow make this adventure very difficult at times. Hiking 15-20 miles, sometimes more, through the woods for several months will, no doubt take a toll on my body. I’ll rest every so often and do stretches every morning to minimize the physical pain but I expect to still experience the morning ""hiker hobble.""
In addition to the physical toll, being away from my wife, kids, grandkids and friends for six months will be very difficult for both me and them. Not since my service in the U.S. Coast Guard, during our first few years together, have my wife and I been apart for more than a week. Marie is making plans to meet me at least twice during my adventure, for short visits. That won’t make the rest of the time we’ll be apart any easier. Even though we’ll talk, text and occasionally facetime, I will still miss being with her.. I will talk to my kids and grandkids as often as possible but I know it won’t be as often as I do when I’m home. 
When I reach Katadhin and return home, to my family, the loneliness from being apart will be over and the pain from hiking will begin to subside. For someone struggling with Lewy Body Dementia, the challenges they endure don’t subside or go away.  
After deciding to hike the Appalachian Trail, I thought I could use this big adventure to benefit others, possibly raising funds for an important cause. My cousin Tim had been diagnosed with Lewy Body Dementia in the fall of 2018. Prior to Tim telling me about his diagnosis, I had never heard of this disease. I suspect most people are not familiar with it, even though it's the second most common type of dementia. It affects almost one and a half million Americans. Maybe I could do my small part to raise awareness of this disease while I face my own challenges on the trail. 
Tim had a doctor and neurologist who recognized early on that he had LBD. Most people with LBD are initially misdiagnosed.  In fact, actor/comedian Robin Williams was not diagnosed with LBD until after his death. LBD shares some of the same symptoms as Alzheimer's and Parkinson’s Disease. However, the treatment for LBD is different from those diseases and some medications used to treat Alzheimer's or Parkinson's are not helpful for LBD patients.  
LBD is caused by the buildup of abnormal protein structures in the brain called Lewy bodies, named after the man who discovered them while researching Parkinson’s, Friedrich Lewy.  They cause symptoms such as confusion, hallucinations, sleep disorder, short attention span and Parkinson's like movement problems, posture and muscle stiffness. It usually affects individuals between 50 and 80 years old and gets progressively worse over time. Men are twice as likely to develop LBD than women. As of now, there is no cure.
If you would like to help with this cause, please share this information with others to raise awareness. Please consider making a donation to LBDA through my donation page. I’m also offering The Mile Marker Challenge: Each time I reach a notable milestone on the trail, please consider making a donation {the milestones are: every 100 mile marker, and the especially significant mile markers:1000, 1500, 2000 miles and, of course, Mt. Katahdin (2193 miles)
You can find a link to the LBDA donation page on my Facebook page and my trail journal page. 
I highly recommend the new movie (on Amazon Prime) about Robin Williams struggle with LBD, “Robin’s Wish”. You can learn about other symptoms of LBD visit: Symptoms

June 21, 2020: Allegheny National Forest 
Although I still had the gear from my trips to Algonguin, I knew I needed to upgrade to modern and lighter gear for this trip. I read lots of gear reviews at sites such as The Trek, Outdoor gear. I also watched quite a few gear reviews by YouTube ""stars"" like Darwin, Bigfoot and the the ever popular Dixie among others. (I had discovered the amazing online subculture of hikers on YouTube.). I spent months researching gear, making trips to the REI store in Rochester to take advantage of their sales,  and making not a few purchases from cottage businesses that specialize in lightweight hiking and camping gear, such as Enlightened Equipment and Zpacks. 
Setting up the tent in the backyard wasn't going to give me a sense of what it would be like on the trail that I needed. It was time for a ""shakedown "" hike, a chance to test my gear, myself and work out the flaws in my choices, if there were any.
I made plans to go hiking in the Allegheny National Forest because it was a mountainous wilderness area within easy driving distance and dispersed camping was allowed. I told my friend Dave about my plans. He asked if he could join me. This sounded like a great idea- an opportunity to test my gear, test some of my ideas about food and the chance to spend time with Dave and learn more from his experience hiking the AT.
We arrived at the Morrison trailhead in Allegheny National Forest, near Bradford, PA  about 11 am on Friday, June 19th. It was a warm, sunny and pleasant day as we set out on the trail. Dave is a seasonal hike, having completed the entire AT in 2019. I enjoyed his company and hearing his stories and insights from hiking the AT.  
The Morrison trail was mostly easy, with a few ups and down giving me a gentle reminder that I needed improve my fitness level if I was going to be walking up much higher mountains than these. I loved how the trail wound through a variety of micro climates and scenery: we hiked through woods with hardwoods and a carpet of bright green ferns, dappled with sunlight. Minutes later we were walking through a fragrant gauntlet of tall mountain laurel bushes, purple and white flowers all around us. After more hiking we entered what looked like a rainforest, dark and moist with giant moss covered boulders, left behind by retreating glaciers over twelve thousand years ago.  
Late in the afternoon we discovered a site for dispersed camping (an unmarked, unofficial camping area). It was a few hundred feet from the trail, hidden among the trees and near a clear running creek. With  flat areas for our shelters and a fire ring it was perfectly secluded and quiet. The fast running, cool stream was a source for water to filter for drinking. The sound of the stream also provided comforting white noise at night.
The short two-night excursion left me with a lot to reconsider about some of my gear and ideas about food preparation. The big three: shelter, pack and sleep system still seemed like good choices. With nine months until my AT hike is to begin, I had time to work out my plans. And there was time for more shakedown hikes, too.

Shakedown #2: The Seward Range
Having dialed in my gear, I wanted to get out and test myself physically. Do I have the physical skill, strength and stamina to hike some of the more challenging sections of the AT? After twenty years of portaging in Algonquin, I had plenty of trail and wilderness experience. I am accustomed to walking a rugged trail through the woods wearing a backpack or carrying a canoe while negotiating slippery roots and rocks without twisting an ankle. In fact, in all twenty years of portaging in Algonquin Park, I never injured myself and fell only once while crossing a slipper footbridge with two heavy packs strapped to my back for reasons that now don't make any sense. 
There are four mountains in the Adirondacks’ Seward Range, near Tupper Lake, New York: Donaldson, Emmons, Seward and Seymour. This range is among the most remote in the rugged Adirondacks region. 
On Saturday morning, August 1st, my friend Dave and I left my house and drove 5-1/2 hours on the New York State thruway, then north through Watertown, NY to the northwestern part of the Adirondack region. We arrived at the trailhead early afternoon. There were a surprising number of cars parked along the remote gravel road. This is what people do in the time of Covid-19: they head into the woods and mountains. Dave and I hiked the 2-1/2 mile trail to the Seward range trailhead camping area. There's a small lean-to and areas around it where dispersed camping is available. You just needed to find a level spot. We set up camp among the trees, not far from some other campers. 
There was a small group of guys camping together nearby. When we told them we planned to hike the four mountain peaks in one trip. They warned us that was too ambitious, especially for someone who hadn't hiked this range before. It was better, they told us, to do the three peaks and climb Seymour, which stood alone, another time. Later, after our trip, we read that the ADK Mountain Club, which rates hiking difficulty of the Adirondack's 46ers peaks, had rated the Seward Range 7 out of 7 for difficulty. 
We had our dinner, topped off our water bottles and hung our food bags, ready to settle in for the evening. Dave, being more social than I, asked the family of three at the lean-to if we could join them enjoying their camp fire and some socially distance style conversation. They readily agreed. They were very nice, friendly couple with a ten year old daughter. They were both grade school teachers, escaping the Covid crisis unfolding in New York City where they lived and worked. They were really fun to talk with but soon we had to turn in to get sleep for our early morning start.
The next morning, after breakfast and refilling our water bottles, we headed out about 6:30. A stream paralleled much of the trail to Seward so I only brought one liter. This turned out to be a dangerous mistake. Though I never ran out of water, I was forced to drastically ration more than I should have on the summit ridge line. The hike up and down the Seward range would turn out to be the most difficult wilderness hike I have ever experienced. The trails began as a relentless uphill climb with a constant struggle for good foot placement. All the way up to the first summit we endured a cold driving wind and rain. Everywhere there were jagged tree limbs to watch for and several nearly vertical rock walls to scramble. Near to the summit, we had to carefully negotiate through large bogs of black, soupy, gooey mud. When I tested for foot placement with my trekking poles, I didn’t always find bottom. 
When we finally reached the first summit, I felt exhilarated. Although Dave was chilled by the wind and rain, I felt like my body was overheating from the hard work. Although it was cloudy and still raining, the views were pretty spectacular. I was so excited that we had finally made it, and saw I had cell service for the first time, I called my Marie. It was only 9 am but we still needed to cross to the other two summits and then make our way back down the mountain range. 
After eleven hours day of technical hiking up then down, enduring rain, mud and pushing every major muscle group in my body to the absolute limit, we made it back to the car. I was exhausted but also exhilarated from the accomplishment. Hiking the Seward Range required a lot of determination and strength every single step. A more experienced hiker, in better shape than I would likely completed it quicker and with less aches and pains but I had done it. 
As we were nearing the car, I asked Dave how often he’d encountered hiking this difficult during his thru-hike of the AT last year. He told me that the Whites in New Hampshire and the mountains of southern Maine were very challenging, but no part of the AT was as challenging and difficult as the hike we’d just accomplished.

On Thursday, I drove across New York state, over the border into Massachusetts and to the town of Dalton. I arrived at the Gulf road trailhead of the Appalachian trail about 3pm. Getting out of my car, I immediately saw a white blaze on a nearby tree, the marker for the iconic trail. I was on the AT, the trail I’d been reading so much about for the past year. I was here for my final shakedown hike before the weather turned cold. 
It took about 90 minutes, not seeing another soul, to reach Crystal Mountain camping area. Within a few minutes of setting up my tent, three hikers appeared: two middle-aged men and a teenage boy. They were section hiking southbound, the opposite direction I was hiking. We had an enjoyable conversation well past dark, while the two men sipped whisky from their flask. 
I slept comfortably in my tent and woke the next morning about 6am. I cooked oatmeal and enjoyed a hot cup of coffee while making small talk with the other hikers, as they crawled out of their hammocks. By 7:30 I was back on the trail. It was a beautiful sunny autumn day for a hike in the New England woods, a day Thoreau would have appreciated.
Hiking was easy, gradually climbing up to The Cobbles, a shelf of marble rock overlooking the town of Cheshire with an amazing view of Mount Greylock towering over the town. A mile past The Cobbles, the white blazes led me downhill, out of the trees onto a residential street. The AT goes down the sidew and acros the town of Cheshire towards Greylock, the highest peak in Massachusetts.  
Since every stream I had crossed so far was completely dry, I conserved the two liters of water as much as I could. Now I was getting dehydrated. Luckily, there was a Dollar General store on Route 8 just a few hundred feet from where the trail crossed. I bought two liters of water and a bottle of Snapple lemonade, downing the lemonade as soon as I stepped outside. 
The trail heads upwards through a meadow. No longer in the shade of the woods, I was feeling the heat of the sun. Up ahead, I could see a lone tree at the top of the rise. Arriving, I was thrilled to find plastic lawn chairs waiting for me in the shade of the tree. I rested a few minutes, drank some cool water and then continued on. 
The hike to the Mark Noepel shelter was a steady upwards climb. I arrived at the shelter at two o’clock, with a mere 3-1/2miles to the summit of Greylock. But it was also another 1000 feet of elevation in that short distance. If I went to the summit, I would need to turn around and hike back down to this very shelter. There was no where else to camp between there and here. I was already tired of hauling myself up this mountain. And, I reasoned, the purpose of this hike was not to cover miles or even reach the summit of Mount Greylock. I was here to simply test my gear, food ideas and get some experience on the AT. I'd have a chance to climb Greylock next year after having much more mountain hiking experience. I stayed the afternoon at the shelter. I finally had cell service to call home, I'd only been able to text occasionally before this. This was an issue I'd need to rectify before next year's adventure.
I woke the next morning to discover that another hiker had arrived during the night. He slept alone in the shelter. We had breakfast together and talked. Brian was from New Jersey and an ex-Marine. He  was running, not hiking, the trail from Mount Greylock to the New Jersey border. He said he'd covered about 35 miles a day. He also told he planned to run the entire AT next year. Perhaps would meet again.
As I was hiking back to Cheshire, I spotted a grey cloth bag lying next to the trail. I suspected someone had accidentally dropped it. I picked it up and looked inside to see it was full of ent stakes. That could be a big problem for someone when they went to setup their tent. About 15 minutes later, I came upon an older bearded guy resting on his pack in the middle of the trail. ""Looker"" told me he was retired from the Air Force, and completing a flip-flop thru hike he’d nearly finished in 2016 before getting injured on Greylock. The tent stakes were his. Like everyone else I'd met on the trail this weekend, he turned out to be very interesting to talk with.
I hiked back through Cheshire, to the Crystal Mountain camping area again for my last night on the trail. After arriving at the camping area, two middle-aged guys and their father arrived. Minutes later a woman arrived and also setup camp.I had some enjoyable conversations with them all.
I felt like I learned a great deal from my three day hike on the AT. I learned that pack weight is really important, especially when you’re hiking up steep mountains. I also discovered that my ideas for food and resupply wouldn’t work as well for me as I’d thought. The most surprising thing I learned was that I could meet a wide variety of interesting people on the trail if I'm open and willing  to be more sociable than I tend to be.

Bookworm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632051,"“They carried all they could bear, and then some, including a silent awe for the terrible power of the things they carried.""  from The Things They Carried, by Tim O’Brien.
With 6 days of food to start my hike from Amicola Falls State Park, my backpack weighs a respectable 24.5 lbs. I'm carrying everything I need to survive: food, water, shelter, cookware, and clothing.  I'm also carrying some of what I don't need such as my fears and expectations. The combined weight of the things I carry, physically, mentally and emotionally will determine the liklihood that I'll reach Mount Katahdin in Maine; too much or too little could impede my progress. 
I researched and researched some more in every corner of Google and YouTube, looking for the best advice about long-distance hiking gear. Over time I gradually acquired the gear I thought I needed. For each new item, I considered the price, weight and usefulness (not always in that order). As my friend and trail mentor Dave advised me, “Ask yourself, 'does this help me get to Katadin?'” After all, this is a six month hiking excursion, not a vacation or camping trip.  In a sense, this is my new job; I’m an adventurer with a mission and a goal. I don't want to bring anything extra that doesn’t help me fulfill this mission. This includes both the physical, mental and spiritual weight I carry. Isn’t that always the truth in life? Of course, as in life, the path may be the same but the journey is different for each person. What aids my journey may not help another person heading north to Katadhin. As the trail saying goes, we all must hike our own hike. 
Although I tried to keep my base pack weight as low as possible, I didn’t strive for what is considered “ultralight”, a pack base weight below 10 lbs. I have been able to get close with a base weight, including cold weather gear, of 14 lbs. I am carrying the necessities for warmth, safety, security and just a little comfort. When the weather is reliably warm enough, I'll send my cold weather gear home, to be returned to me when I reach the New England states. 
The pack I chose is an Ospry Exos 58, a popular choice for long distance hikers due to its room, affordability, durability, and Osprey’s great customer service. For a shelter system I have one person tarptent, Gossamer Gear's The One, which uses trekking poles for support (for weight savings, multi purpose gear is optimal). My sleep system includes a lightweight insulated sleeping pad, an ultralight down quilt, rated at 20 degrees and pillow. I have merino wool sleepwear, gloves,  beanie, midweight fleece and an ultralight insulated puffy jacket. And, finally, for rain protection, I have a ""Packa"" raingear that can be worn as a rain jacket, poncho and also serves as a pack cover, all in one.
I carry a hygiene kit, first aid and blister treatment kit, gear repair patches, the AWOL AT trail guide, a notebook, Swiss Army knife and, of course, a poo kit.
Though not always visible to the casual observer, I also carry the fear of getting injured; a fear of not having enough food, concern I have too much, the fear of running low on water and dehydration; concern that I'm carrying more water than necessary at 1.5lbs per liter; fear of  contracting Lyme disease, norovirus or Covid-19. I will carry the yearning to see my wife, son, daughter, granddaughters and many other family and friends back home. I will carry the anticipation, of meeting new people, making new friends and seeing extraordinary vistas, beautiful scenery and wildlife. I will carry persistence, determination, love of adventure and the pursuit of my dream for a successful journey to offset the weight of the other burdens I carry. 
These are the things I carry.For my complete gear list click on link: https://lighterpack.com/r/vs7p

Bookworm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632901,"Benton MacKaye first proposed the idea of the Appalachian Trail in October 1921. He dreamed of a wilderness trail, the length of the Appalachian mountain range, as a utopian refuge from urban life. He understood the importance of having a connection with nature for one’s mental and physical health. The Appalachian trail was completed in 1937. 
The first person to make the claim of hiking the entire trail was WWII veteran, Earl Shaffer, in 1948. In 1955, Emma Gatewood, nicknamed “Grandma Gatewood,” was 67 years old when she became the first woman to complete a solo thru-hike. Since then, hikers of all ages, 5 to 82, have completed the trek, as have several blind hikers and an above-the-knee amputee. Each year more people attempt a thru hike. The numbers have especially grown after the release of Bill Bryson's 1998 book, A Walk in the Woods and the 2014 movie ""Wild.""
In 1968, Congress designated the Appalachian Trail (and the Pacific Crest Trail) as a National Scenic Trail under the National parks system. The AT is cared for by 31 trail clubs in coordination with the Appalachian Trail Conservancy (ATC) and the National parks system. 
The Appalachian trail is currently 2,193 miles (the length of the trail changes every few years).
The AT crosses 14 state borders: Georgia, N. Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, W. Virginia, Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine. 
Over the course of a thru hike, a hiker gains and loses over 464,464 feet, or more than 89 miles in elevation; the equivalent to climbing 29,035 foot high Mt Everest 16 times.
The highest peak is 6,643 foot high Clingman's Dome in the Smoky Mountains of Tennessee.
The lowest elevation is 124 feet in New York's Bear Mountain State Park.
Approximately 2500 people attempt a thru hike each year....
Of those who make the attempt, only one in four successfully complete it.

Bookworm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633450,"Last Thursday, while I was out hiking and training my body for the AT, I slipped and fell. I initially thought I had badly sprained my wrist. In a few days, it would be fine. After a week of it still not feeling healed, I had it examined and x-rayed. The doctor determined that it was actually a minor fracture. It could have been much worse but is bad enough to prevent me from starting my hike on schedule.
So, with my arm in a cast, I am forced to delay the launch of my thru hike. The delay may be one week, two weeks or possibly more. When the doctor gives me the ok, I will adjust my plans on how and where to get on the trail and go. I am determined to persevere and get on the trail.

Bookworm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633542,"At the follow-up medical visit, I was advised to give my wrist another couple of weeks to heal before starting my hike. I just need to be patient...and have an alternative plan.
In the meantime, I am now eligible for and was able to make appointments to be vaccinated against Covid-19: the first vaccination is this Saturday and the booster will be administered on April 17th. I am thrilled to be vaccinated against Covid-19 prior to hitting the trail, for my own safety and those I encounter. Fortuitously, the vaccination schedule aligns with the healing of my wrist. 
With my delayed departure, the window for a NOBO thru-hike is quickly closing. Starting my hike in Georgia so much later would increase the risk of treacherous weather in northern New England or that Baxter Park (where the trail ends) closes before I can get there. However, there is more than one way to thru-hike the Appalachian Trail.  
The most common method is the ""NOBO"" or northbound hike from Georgia to Maine that I was going to do. However, an alternative is a ""Flip-Flop"" thru-hike. Instead, I will start near the middle in Harper's Ferry, West Virginia and hike to Katadhin in Maine then ""flip-flop"" back to where I started and complete the trail hiking south to Georgia. This will allow me to get to Katadhin in July or August, well before the cold and then hike south in late summer and early fall. Also, since far fewer hikers do a flip-flop, there should be more room at hostels and shelters (which is safer during the pandemic), and there'll be more resources available in towns. With fewer hikers, it will be a less sociable experience than hiking NOBO in the ""bubble"" of hikers moving north. However, for those who prefer some of that solitary time on the trail, like myself, that's a bonus, too.
I will arrive in Harper's Ferry on April 18th and begin my ""Flip-Flop"" thru-hike the next morning.

Bookworm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634238,"I was initially upset at having to delay my hike.  Plans I’d been working on for a year and a half were turned upside down just two days before I was to head to Georgia. But I understand that resilience and adaptability are two characteristics very helpful to completing a 2,193 mile thru-hike, and in life genrally. Perhaps this was just an early test of my fortitude.
Rather than cancel or postpone a year, I adjusted my plans. I am doing what is necessary to heal my wrist and go forward with revised plans. It is still sore but significantly better. As a consequence of the change in plans, I missed out on the damaging winds, rain and generally awful weather that swept across the south, including Georgia. I am also missing the dangerously cold temperatures in the Smoky Mountains that have occured the past two weeks, where I would've been now had I started last month. Many hikers have been forced to leave the trail for their safety. And a stroke of good luck and serendipity enables me to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 before heading to the trail. Sometimes, things have a way of working out for the better. 
So now I will start my hike, 4 weeks later than originally planned, in Harpers Ferry instead of on Springer mountain. It seems only fitting that I would start in Harpers Ferry, a town that played an important role in American history. 
Both my cousin Tim and I have always loved reading about and studying history. (I earned my Bachelor of Arts degree in History.) Whenever Tim and I get together, the first thing we do is share what history books we'd been reading most recently. We both read about a wide range of historical topics, however, Tim's favorite focus of study has always been the Civil War. He was active as a Civil War reenactor, traveling to various battle sites.
In 1859, as part of a plan to instigate slave revolts across Virginia, John Brown led a raid on the Federal armory at Harpers Ferry. The raid failed and Brown was captured by Colonel Robert E. Lee.e  He was convicted of treason and hung on December 2nd. Southerners saw Brown's raid as a symbol of the north's aggression and determination to destroy the southern way of life and the institution of slavery. Abolitionists viewed Brown as a martyr to their cause. Attempts at compromise had failed, the only option remaining was violence. A year later, after the Presidential election of 1860, South Carolina seceded from the Union and the war between the states soon after erupted. Harper's Ferry continued to play a role in the war, changing hands between the Union an Conferderates multiple times.
As I begin my hike in Harper's Ferry in 12 days, I'll be thinking of mine and Tim's shared love of history, the events that happened in Harper's Ferry over 160 years ago and the journey and struggles ahead for both Tim and I.

Flip flippers are just starting out, getting their trail legs. About a dozen or so are spread out over this section north of Harpers Ferry into PA. Hikers of similar pace will, no doubt, form into small traveling groups. The past few days I’ve been hiking mostly with Dabney, an experienced and strong backpacker. We both spent last night freezing at the Raven Rock Shelter. The temperature dipped to a bitter 34 degrees with winds howling all night long. I wore every stitch of clothing I had and barely stayed warm. After last night, I’m ready for a brief period of rest, recharge and resupply. Staying one night in Waynesboro, PA.  
Although the climbs up and the rocks on the trail have been difficult at times, I feel confident my feet will be able to endure the punishment and my legs will get stronger as I progress. I’ve only had minor issues and muscle soreness so far. I intend on doing low miles the next few days. 
I joined Dabney, Stretch and Surefoot, who I had camped with at Pine Knob Shelter, for dinner in town. These two amazing women, Stretch and Surefoot, are section hiking a little further into Pennsylvania. We all met up with and and received trail magic from Bluebell and Tree, who gave us Dabney and I food supplies to get to the next resupply point. Such a kind and interesting couple. They have a very interesting life of world traveling. I hope to see them again. I’m amazed at how many good people I’ve met the past four days.

I also picked up a small sub and banana for later on the trail. I ate breakfast and waited for the shuttle driver to take me back to the trail. Roger arrived about 10am in his black Hyundai four door. 
Roger is 74 years young and has been shuttling AT hikers to and from the trail to anywhere they need to go for about 5 years. He is a retired Army MP. Sadly, he lost his wife to COVID-19 at the end of March. 
Hiking from route 16 to the Tumble Run Shelter was relatively easy. There was not much elevation and the trail was negotiable. I just had to be mindful of the rocks, especially the ones hiding under dry leaves. A thru hiker mostly hikes looking down at their feet. As I hike through rocks and roots, ups and downs, I make sure to firmly plant my trekking pole before moving my foot. With my wrist nearly healed (still wearing a splint), a fall is the last thing I need. 
Arriving at the shelters, I found a suitable tent pad and set up my tent. Then I’ll fill my water bag at the stream and filter it into my two liter bottles. I blow my air pad pillow, put my night clothes, pad, pillow and quilt in my tent so it’s ready the night. Then I’ll socialize with nearby hikers, prepare a meal and eat. After eating and brushing my teeth, everything that smells like food to an animal, including toothpaste, goes in my Bear bag and gets hung on the Bear pole for the night. Before sundown, I climb into my tent and settle for the night. 9pm is referred to as hiker midnight. 
Tumbling Run has two shelters, one is humorously designated for snoring and the other for non-snorering. This is one reason I sleep in a tent, besides not wanting mice run over the top of me all night (and covid safety).

To make that more difficult, I had to collect extra water since the stream near the shelter is dry. 
At the Alec Kennedy shelter we met Blue. He’s in his mid 60s. He hiked from Springer mountain to Erwin, TN then flipped up to Harpers Ferry. Seemed like a nice guy. Perhaps I’ll see him down the trail.

Though some was fairly easy, much of it was full of large rocks as if someone had thrown them on the trail like rolling dice. The rocks are at every angle and some are pointed. I had to watch every step. It was a difficult, slow and tedious hike. And, about 4 miles into my hike, it began to rain. I had my pack covered but there seemed little purpose in putting on my rain jacket/poncho since the humidity and exertion had me pretty wet already. 
After hiking every day for 11 days, it’s time for a short break, a “zero”. A zero is a day with no miles hiked, a day of recuperation and rest. And probably boredom, too. I was reluctant to stop for a full day but realize it’s best. 
I’m spending two nights in Kinda Outdoorsy Hostel in the town of Duncannon, PA. The hostel is very clean, the shower water is hot and the owner is very nice. The two people I’ve been hiking with, Snapdragon and Pootz, are also taking a zero. And Mr. Blue, who we met two days ago, is also staying. Also here is Pastor Plaid, a section hiker heading south.

Bookworm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636053,"Zeros are nice, too nice. It is enjoyable to take a hot shower, sleep in a bed and eat regular food. But that lifestyle won’t get me down the trail. So I hiked out of Duncannon this morning, heading to the Peters Mountain Shelter camp area just over 11 miles away. I walked through a neighborhood, crossed busy route 22 and went over railroad tracks and around train cars parked across the trail. That was all followed by a steady but manageable climb but soon I was into the rocks again. Even watching every step I took, it was still hard to make it through the rocks without tripping. Once I nearly fell. Another time I had to use my hands to climb over boulders. But the views of Duncannon, the countryside far below and the Susquehanna river was spectacular. 
On the trail, I saw Snapdragon making her way to a parking lot where her fiancé waited with a new sleep system. I was also passed by the Strawbridge family: a couple with 4 teenagers who are thru-hiking NOBO from Georgia to become triple crowners*. Arriving at the shelter, I met my new friends Blackhawk and Freebird, the section hiking elderly couple, and Mr Blue, the 72 year old thru hiker. They had stayed at the hostel the night before, also. Inevitably, the question arises: “why are you attempting a thru hike of a long trail?” I’ve asJed other hikers and get a variety of answers but most seem drawn by the challenge of the hike, seeing the views from mountaintops or the beautiful country. For me, all those reasons are true. But I also think this is a journey of my own self discovery and a sort of pilgrimage to find the next phase of my life. I suspect other hikers feel the same but don’t express it openly. One thing is for sure, walking for hours and hours every day gives one time for contemplation. 
*Triple Crown refers to those who have completed a thru hike of the three major long trails: Pacific Crest Trail (PCT), Continental Divide Trail (CDT) and the Appalachian Trail (AT)

The combination of torrential downpours this morning and the fact that there were no rooms available in Hamburg on Friday, forced a change in plans. So I am doing a Nero in Pine Grove instead and hiking to Hamburg. In Hamburg, I plan to resuppply and get back on the trail that day. Snapdragon and I are still hiking together. We’ve been staying at the same campsites and coordinating since my first day on the trail when we met. A few days ago we met Thanksgiving and Baby Steps at the Peters Mountain Shelter. They’ve been hiking with us since. We don’t always hike together during the day but may see each other throughout the day as one or another stops for a break. At the end of the day’s hike, we set up camp at the same campsite or shelter. Over dinner, we talk about the challenges of the day and plans going forward.
It seems a “tramily” or trail family is forming. But that is always subject to change. We heard from our previous hiking partner, Pootz. He had gone home from Duncannon to his heal hip pain. He’s doing better and is having his wife deliver him back to the trail to join us on Saturday. At least, that’s the plan. Hiker’s plans and situations sometimes converge and a tramily forms. And sometimes injury or other issues force them to fall behind or get off the trail. If they return, they may catch up to their new friends or join a new group of hikers. 
Although each hiker must hike their own hike, it’s helpful to hike with or, at least coordinate with other hikers. They may have helpful ideas and they understand what others on the trail are enduring. I like hiking with people who have more relevant experience than I do. And, half-joking, have more common sense than me. Note: A Nero is when a hiker gets off trail, goes into town, does chores, stays one night and goes back to the trail the next morning.  A Zero is a day with no hiking, staying two nights in town.

Of course, there were the notorious Pennsylvania rocks in some parts of the trail. Not enough to complain about. Today I thought about what it took to place those rocks there. Millions of years of heat and pressure to form the rocks, eons of plates movement and upheaval, followed by the glaciers 10,000 years ago picking them up and dropping them across the northeast, some on the trail. It almost made me want to appreciate that I could walk over them. Tomorrow I’ll go to a store in Hamburg, Pa to pick up tape to patch the holes those rocks are tearing in my hiking shoes.
As I was hiking through the woods, miles from anything, I saw what appeared to be a graveyard headstone in the middle of the trail. When I got to it and saw the front, I was shocked to see it marked the site of a fort from the French and Indian War of 1755. As someone who loves history, especially North American history, this was a real thrill. I won’t get sidetracked into a history lesson here.

I bout some tape and glue to repair the holes in my shoes. Altar Lone Peak trail shoes are the most popular shoes for thru hikers on the AT. They have great traction, a wide toe box and are comfortable. Unfortunately, they’re also known to not be very durable. The 4.5 version, which I have, tend to get holes in the fabric on the sides. My shoes  still have some miles left in them, except for the holes. So I patched them inside with tape and shoe glue. I have a new pair at home.

We’d met Forager at the shelter the previous night. Forager was somewhat of an expert in wild edibles and was from Sherman, NY, just an hour south of Buffalo. I enjoyed a strawberry milkshake and hot fudge sundae. For some reason, that wasn’t enough so I had one of their amazing banana splits, too. That hit the spot. After a piece of pizza, I knew I could skip dinner when we arrived at camp.

We had hiked less than a mile when we came upon the “lemon squeezer.” The trail led between two huge rock formations that were about two feet apart at the entrance but closed in at the exit. Easy attempted it first. He needed to remove his pack to get through; then CB made it through and finally me. I was able to pull myself up and out just as it got too narrow. Right after the lemon squeezer was a very challenging short but vertical climb. You had to be very aware of where you placed your hand to hold on and the weight of your pack to prevent you from falling backwards. There was a sign nearby pointing to an easy alternative around the climb but someone had written on it, “Bill Bryson would have gone the easy way.” An attempt to shame true hikers into going the hard way which is the actual path of the AT. Bryson, author of A Walk in the Woods, (about his attempt to thru hike the AT) skipped large parts of the trail. The shaming worked. No AT hiker wants to be compared to Bill Bryson like that.
Most of the day’s hike was through Harriman State Park so it was relatively easy. We had views of the NYC skyline in th distance and of the Hudson River. All day while we hiked, we could hear in the distance the boom of canons at West Point Military Academy just north of us. They were being fired off for graduation weekend. 
We setup a stealth* camp for the night on a ridge overlooking the Hudson. The wind is strong and it looks like it may rain during the night. But that’s ok because we only have a six mile hike in the morning to Fort Montgomery, NY, where we’ll enjoy town food, a real bed and- best of all- a hot shower and clean laundry. Finally, after 10 days, I will take a nero.
Tomorrow, CB is getting off the trail. She has to return to her family snd job. Easy and I will hike on. I enjoyed hiking with her and am sad to see another of my most recent tramily leave the trail. And I heard from Snapdragon and Baby Steps. They are only a day behind so we may reunite soon. 
* A stealth campsite is one that is not officially a campsite. It may be used frequently enough to have a fire ring.

We hiked down from the ridge above West Mountain Shelter and across to Bear Mountain. The air was cool and humidity was low for a change. I heard the same morning bird trill I’ve yet been able to identify. As morning wore on and we got closer to Bear Mountain Park, we saw more rand more people out for a short hike or walk. The trail turned into a gravel path. The trail enters and winds right through Bear Mountain Zoo. The zoo appeared old and underfunded. The red Fox looked sad in his small cage; the two black bears looked bored, surrounded by vultures, in their pen. I don’t know if they were born in captivity or there because they were injured, unable to survive in the wild. But they looked pathetically out of their element.
Throughout the day, a few NOBO hikers, who’d started on Springer Mountain, went by us. They’re easy to spot- walk very fast, very thin and usually a little unkempt. We’re seeing more and more every day. A family came along, all fitting the aforementioned description. I stopped the dad, who sported a very long beard. He said they were the Trout family: mother, father, five kids and a dog. The oldest appeared to be about 14 and the youngest about half that age. 
We met some of the kids again at the vending machines near the tower. I showed them how to use the machines as I purchased mint chocolate chip ice cream sandwich. This is the first ice cream vending machine I’ve ever seen. What a concept!
Grandpa, the owner and proprietor of Bear Mountain Bridge Motel picked us up in his Chevy Tahoe. We stopped at a takeout place for subs then, at the hotel, enjoyed them at a picnic table. He took all our dirty clothes to wash and we settled into our rooms. A hot shower, ten days since the last one, was terrific. I’ll probably take more before we leave in the morning.

We ate breakfast and then hiked. 
We crossed Bear Mountain Bridge over the Hudson, watching a freight train running alongside the river and a barge crossing. The trail took us right past the Appalachian Deli, where we stopped for an early lunch. The Beast, a young woman I’d met on the trail a few times over the past few weeks, was there. Yak and his two hiking partners were there. And Action and Adventure, a couple who started in Virginia, came in just behind us. I’d met them on the trail a few times and at the Bellvale Creamery. All eight of us hikers, packs and trekking poles strewn about, sat at the picnic tables under umbrellas enjoying the terrific lunch fare from the deli. 
Off the AT, we took a road, The Franciscan Way, to the Graymoor compound. Its operated by Franciscan friars and has allowed hikers to camp on the baseball field since the 1970s. There’s an outdoor shower ( cold water), picnic tables and potable water. It’s also rather quiet and peaceful.
When we arrived, there was a guy already here who I understand is not a hiker but more of a wanderer. Soon after we arrived, Top Chef and Greybeard came along. 
Casses, who LT and I met several days ago on the trails New Jersey boardwalk section. He’s more of a wandering section hiker. He’s friendly, knowledgeable and talkative. “Casses,” he explained, is Latin for “justified.”  He told me how he spent several days helping Jim Murray, clean up the Secret Shelter. 
The Secret Shelter is just before Unionville where CB, Easy, LT and I went to General Store and pizzeria on the day we all started hiking together. Earlier, just before going into Unionville, LT and I had taken a short detour to see Jake the donkey. Jake roams the property around the shelter, requesting attention and food from hikers. LT gave him lots of positive attention.

I have hiked from West Virginia, across Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York State and into Connecticut. 
The hiking in this state started easy and pleasant, with beautiful views of the Ten Mile River with its fast raging waters, due the recent rains. 
Easy snd I took a side trip across the Bulls Bridge, a one lane covered bridge, to the Bulls Bridge Country Store for lunch. I had a chicken salad sandwich, cheese-it’s, an ice cream sandwich and a few of East’s chocolate chip cookies. We talked with Zoomy and Halo, thru hikers who’d started on Springer mountain in February. 
After lunch the hiking became much harder. The climb up Schaghitcoke mountain, at 1380 feet, was endless and relentless. It was an exhausting climb, winding its way to a summit that seemed it would never appear. The gnats made it worse flying into my ears and eyes. Then the trail became rocky, Pennsylvania style rocky. Finally, the last mile before the Mt Algo shelter, the terrain became a little easier. 
We got to the shelter and found it to be a sad establishment. But the areas around were level and clear, perfect for tenting. Which I prefer since I asleep best in my tent. There was a woman tenting alone and a woman with her two daughters in another tent. They had their laundry strung out on a line next to their large REI tent. A flowing stream in front of the shelter provides plenty of drinking water and a bear box was also available for putting our food bags in (the agonizing task of hanging a bear bag is dreaded by hikers everywhere).

About a mile out, Snapdragon continued on. Someone was picking her up for a zero. Easy and I walked off trail to the Mountain Cafe in Falls Village, CT for a second breakfast. We had both cooked our usual (grits for me) but felt we weren’t eating enough.

I eat as much as I can when the opportunity arises but it’s hard to carry enough healthy calories to replace the ones I’m burning climbing up and down mountains. If my phone is accurate, I’m averaging around 39-40,000 steps per day. Sometimes more. Unintentionally, I have lost at least 20 lbs since I started. The more food I carry, the heavier my pack is (approximately 2 lbs per day of food). The more weight I carry, the more calories I burn lugging it up a mountain on my back.

The woman who used to live there was known to give home baked cookies to hikers passing through for over 30 years. She also let hikers camp in her yard. When she moved out recently, she sold the farm and property to the Sangree family with the understanding they would continue the tradition: Cookie Lady 2.0.
We arrived early in the afternoon. Soon others arrived and there were a dozen hikers hanging, eating chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin cookies and drinking sodas. I love oatmeal raisin cookies. Karl and his girlfriend Elly said they’d go to the store for hot dogs and burgers so we could all have a cookout. Some of us searched the property and located a cast iron gas grill someone had mounted on the body of a push mower. Peculiar but functional. 
Then we formed up teams and played several innings of whiffle ball. Harvey’s team won. After the game, Roots grilled up burgers and dogs. We had onions, tomatoes, condiments for the dogs and burgers and potato chips. 
After the game and food, we all relaxed in chairs and the picnic table around the backyard. As the sun set, we crawled into our tents for the evening.

The Father Tom Campground is a large grassy area in town where hikers can setup tents or hammocks, charge their electronics and get water. There’s also picnic tables snd bicycles available to use. Also camping there were Spoon, Hanalei and Shaka. Hanalei and Shaka, who are section hiking with the support of their car, drove Lieutenant to move her car from Dalton up here to Cheshire. She’ll be getting off trail to go home tomorrow. 
Roots took one of the bicycles to explore town. Easy and I stayed snd made our dinners. Suddenly, a man wearing a white straw hat and a backpack rode into the campground on a bike. He opened his pack and dumped a variety of chips, homemade pizzelles other snacks and drinks onto a picnic table and said, “I’m the Polish Hermit. Take whatever you like!”  Those of us there took some snacks to add to our meals. 
Later, Hanalei, Shaka, Easy, Spoon, Roots, Lieutenant, and I sat and enjoyed conversation until “hiker midnight” (I.e. 9pm) arrived and then crawled into our tents for the night.

At 5am I awoke to the sound of thunder. It was a storm rolling through the mountains and it was getting closer. The shelter I was camping near in my tent was at about 3000 feet, not much lower than the storm. Through the fabric of my tent and the trees above, I saw a bolt of lightening. Immediately after, a crack of thunder crashed. I could feel the ground vibrating. There were two more before the storm began to move away. I’ve never been in a storm so loud and close. 
The rain continued off and on through the morning. The trail was inundated with water, flowing down hill. The trail went through the town of North Adams. 
As Easy and I hiked up the mountain, we saw where a forest fire had destroyed acres of woods about a month ago. Just then Hanalei and Shaka came along, hiking south. They’d previously seen Roots who told them I was concerned I had a blister and immediately gave me bandaids. Such thoughtful people. 
Within a few miles, we crossed the border into Vermont. This is where the AT and Vermont’s Long Trail join. The Long Trail is the country’s oldest long distance hiking trail. 
We finally arrived at the Seth Warner shelter area. There we met a group of men out for their annual “adventure.” They had all graduated from college over 30 years ago. They were all architects. 
I slept well in my tent.

On he way, she stopped at a local takeout place, Bonnie and Clyde’s, where we picked up breakfast sandwiches and coffee. (When she picked us up at the trailhead on Thursday, she gave us each a bag with two large chocolate chip cookies that her mother makes for hikers.)
Melanie-Ann and her partner build tiny houses for their primary income. The homes are custom designed and built, with amazing detail and woodwork, by the two of them. I asked why they named the lady house “Hemingway”. Apparently, Chris (Melanie-Ann’s partner) was a college professor and Ernest Hemingway scholar. This peaked my interest, I’ve been a fan of Papa Hemingway’s literature for many years. In fact, one of the few books I included on my phone to read on the trail is Hemingway’s short stories. 
We hiked 5 miles to the summit of Stratton mountain at 3940 feet. There we climbed the ladder to the top of the fire tower at the summit. From the top, there’s a 360 degree view. To the west are the Taconic Mountains on the New York border (Albany is visible in clear weather). Greylock in Massachusetts is visible to the south, and several mountains in New Hampshire to the northeast. Several mountains in Vermont are visible, including Glastenbury and Bromley.
Near the fire tower is a small, one room cabin that was built in 1929. We met the caretakers, Jeanne and Hugh Jouday, who live in the cabin together from May until October. They have been caretakers and fire watchers there for 53 years. There’s a video on the Green Mountain Club YouTube channel about them, 50 years on Stratton. Please check it out. (Jeanne and Hugh are originally from my neck of the woods, Buffalo, NY). They recommended we leave our backpacks with them and hike 7/10 of a mile down a side trail to the ski gondola. So we did. 
The gondola carried us down to Stratton mountain village, where there are shops primarily focused on skiing. But we did find a coffee shop that also had ice cream. Roots bought us all milkshakes. I had a coconut milkshake. There’s a fee to ride the gondola back to the summit but, as thru hikers, we were able to ride for free. 
We returned to the summit, got our packs and hiked 3 miles to the Stratton Pond Shelter where we setup for the night. I changed out my tent, when my wife Marie visited. I sent home my single wall tarp tent in exchange for a semi free standing double wall tent, a Big Agnes Tigerwall UL 2. It’s a little heavier but more suitable for the cooler weather I’ll encounter going north and into higher elevations. I also added cold weather clothes to my pack. After eating, I put my food bag in the bear box and put my other items in my tent, about 30 feet down the trail from the shelter. I returned to the shelter, where the other hikers were gathered around a fire talking. As I approached, I saw that the three college-aged women and the three young kids were doing yoga together. So I walked up and joined them. Soon Roots joined us doing yoga poses (except down dog, because no one wanted to put their hands in the dirt). It felt good to stretch before heading off to my tent for the night.

Bookworm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639612,"Today we hiked down Stratton mountain and up Bromley mountain, elevation 3263 feet. We stopped at Prospect Rock on our way, for a bird’s eye view of Manchester Center where we took our zero on Thursday.
Before heading up Bromley, a woman approached Easy, Roots and I and offered trail magic. We had soda pop, freezy pops and she gave us bananas. 
On the summit of Bromley is a ski patrol lodge, open for hikers to sleep on the floor if they want. We set up our tents behind the ski lift, which is shut down for summer. Out my tent window I have a south view of the Green mountains and, in the distance, Greylock mountain in Massachusetts (which we hiked over several days ago). 
Today is Father’s Day. In my first journal entry, I wrote that one of the many reasons I embarked on this adventure was for my parents, another was for my kids. On this holiday I’m reminded of those reasons. My father loved the outdoors, including hiking in the woods. He taught us to respect and appreciate nature. Our family went camping in the Adirondacks and Allegheny every year when my  sisters and I were young. My father often took me fishing, also. If he were alive today, he’d be proud of my attempt to hike the trail and would understand the appeal.
However, he passed away at age 49. He made lifestyle choices, particularly excessive drinking, that led to poor health snd an early death. He missed out on so much in his kids’ lives and never even met three of his four grandchildren. 
So on this Fathers Day, I’m thinking of him and how he’d feel knowing I was doing this. I also think of how I am able to do it because I made some better choices regarding my health and lifestyle than he did. I think he’d be happy about that too. 
Also, I am doing this hike for my own kids, showing them that if they take care of their health- eat healthy and exercise- they too can live  a richer, better life. Some things are beyond one’s control of course, but healthy choices are within our control and can make a real difference in the quality and longevity of one’s life. 
Happy Fathers Day to all the dads

However, the shelter we were going to spend the night had reports of bear disturbances. Bears climbed a tree and took a hiker’s food despite people yelling and making noise to scare it away. Apparently bears had been retuning to the shelter in search of food. So, we opted to stay at the hostel in town and hike out tomorrow morning, going to a further campsite. 
The hostel at the Yellow Deli is unique and has a good reputation as a place for hikers to stay. It’s very clean snd offers all the amenities a hiker needs, particularly hot showers, beds and  laundry. The deli has delicious food. 
While we were sitting outside, Action and Adventure showed up. We hadn’t seen them in a week or two. Also, Richard I’d staying here. We last saw him in Connecticut. And a hiker we met at the shelter last night, Wiki, is also staying at the hostel. Wiki is 74 years old.

Bookworm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639827,"The good people at the Yellow Deli hostel provided us with a free breakfast this morning: poached egg, homemade toasted bread, strawberry jam, sliced apples and oranges and coffee. They provided breakfast at no charge. The Yellow Deli is owned and operated by members of The Twelve Tribes, a religious group community that bases their beliefs on the Old and New Testament. Some refer to it as a cult. However, I do not know enough about them to have an opinion on that though I did notice a frequent tendency of the women behaving subservient to the men. They certainly treated me and the other hikers with kindness and generosity. They are very nice, kind people who take the teachings of the Christian Bible to heart. And they make really great food, a variety of inter and delicious tea drinks and even nice smelling organic soaps. Cathy, this morning’s shuttle driver (wife of Tom, who shuttled from the trail yesterday), picked us up at 8:15am. During the 20-30 minute drive, taking us back to the trail, she told us about some Vermont history, what she thought were some peculiarities of Vermonters and, most interestingly, her take on Ethan Allen and the Green mountain boys. It was fascinating to hear her talk extensively about the little-known side of a hero of the American Revolution (he captured Fort Ticonderoga from the British during the Revolutionary War and was a founder of Vermont). She said she was a social historian and had a less than favorable opinion of him. We spent the day climbing up and down until finally reaching Cooper Lodge shelter near the summit of Killington Mountain. Killington is 4235 feet high, the first 4000 foot mountain I’ve climbed on the AT and Vermont’s second highest peak. It’s also home of the most popular ski resort in the northeast. Cooper Lodge shelter is a stone shelter with 4 bunks inside and a door (most are open front lean-tos). It’s one of the oldest shelters on the AT, built by the CCC (Civilian Conservation Corp) during the Great Depression in the 1930s. We setup our tents in an area near the shelter. 
After setting up camp, we climbed the 1/4 mile up to the summit. Luckily, we could leave our packs behind for the very steep rock scramble up. We had a stunning clear view of faraway mountains to the north towards Canada and what were probably the Adirondack mountains of New York to the west.  
After climbing back down to camp, I made a typical trail meal, 1/2 a package of knorr’s sides: chicken, noodles and broccoli in a creamy cheese sauce, adding olive oil instead of butter. I also fried up a package of spam and mixed it into the noodle dish. It was surprisingly delicious though I’d never eat it at home. For dessert I had a package of fruit snacks and piece of dark chocolate. 
When Marie visited me, I swapped my single wall tent for my more spacious double wall tent, Big Agnes’ Tigerwall UL2. As I head north, the nights will be cooler resulting in more condensation inside. The condensation gets my down quilt damp, making it less effective and also hard to dry out. The double wall is a few ounces heavier but worth it because condensation won’t be as much of a problem.

Bookworm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639863,"I awoke at 5am to sunlight and the sounds of birds singing, as usual, but went back to sleep for another hour. Due to our original plans, which didn’t include the stay at a hostel, we already had reservations at the Inn at The Long Trail. The inn is right where the Long Trail and Appalachian Trail split. The LT continues north to the Canadian border; the AT turns east towards New Hampshire and the infamous White Mountains. 
It was cold this morning but I changed out of my thermals and into my T-shirt and shorts,?the same clothes I wear every day to hike. I took down my tent and packed up. Then I went up to the shelter to make the same breakfast I make every day on the trail. Since there’s no bear box or cables at the shelter and all the nearby trees are pines (with short branches, not suitable for hanging a food bag), we hung ate food bags inside the shelter. 
Like everyday, I boiled about 3/4 cup of water. I pour the heated water into an envelope of oatmeal (the paper envelope it comes in), stir and pour in a second envelope of oatmeal into the first; add more hot water until the consistency is right. Then I pour an envelope of hot chocolate mix and a stick of instant coffee into the remaining hot water, stir and add cold water so I can drink it right away as I eat the oatmeal. I supplement with either a package of pop tarts or Belvida breakfast bars. This holds me over for about 3 hours of hiking. Luckily, I like oatmeal and it comes in  a variety of flavors.
Later in the morning, I’ll eat a Cliff bar or Luna bar. For lunch, around noon or 1 o’clock, I put peanut butter and dried fruit on an English muffin. Tortillas taste like paper and, like wraps, are too heavy compared to their calorie and nutrition count. I tried bagels and mini bagels but they’re too heavy, also.
We hiked only 8 miles to the Inn where I had a cheeseburger and Smithwicks red ale in the Irish pub. Just as I was finishing, in walked Snapdragon. She stayed the previous night and was slack packing. Later, Baby Steps also arrived to stay at the inn.
Slack packing is a way to hike a section of the trail without carrying a full backpack. A hiker takes only water and food for the day, leaving the rest of their gear at a hostel, hotel or with a shuttle driver. Usually they get shuttled somewhere north, as Snapdragon did, then they hike back south to the place they’re staying or a pickup point. The next day they get driven back the same place so they can continue hiking with their gear. It saves on effort and may result in covering more miles but it can also be expensive. 
The day ended with Roots, Easy, Baby Steps, Snapdragon, another hiker named Pacer, and I enjoying dinner, conversation and Guinness in the Irish Pub.

I chose the chef’s special: a broccoli and cheese omelette with a side of bacon, potatoes, English muffins, orange juice and and coffee. It was as a delicious meal and filled me up for the long hike ahead.  Other than two Cliff bars, it was all I ate until my dinner at 6pm. 
We hiked 13.6 miles today, with two long climbs. Rather than hike another three miles (which included another big climb), we stopped at a clearing by a dirt road and stealth camped. It seemed like the middle of nowhere until a bicycle, two motorcycles and a couple walking their dogs went by. The day’s hike was uneventful except when I walked into a fallen tree and almost knocked myself out. It’s not uncommon, (especially in Vermont where trail maintenance is lacking), to see blowdown blocking the trail. Trees of all sizes topple over from storms and wind. Sometimes you just step over them or, if they’re large, climb over them. Sometimes you can walk around them. Occasionally, they’re laying high across the trail and you can crawl or stoop to go under them. The problem is that, like most hikers, I was watching my feet as I negotiated the rocks and twisted roots on the trail, not looking up very much. Suddenly, I felt something slam the top of my head and heard a thud. I had walked into a large pine tree lying horizontally across the trail about 5 foot and 11 inches (my height) above the ground. I toppled over backwards onto the ground, my trekking poles flying through the air. I was stunned and confused for a second. Roots was hiking just ahead of me, with earphones in but heard the loud thump and my groan, spun around and saw me on the ground with my feet in the air. I was stunned but didn’t fell any pain or blood on my head. So got up, dusted off and resumed hiking. It could’ve been worse. A I’m sure I’m not the only hiker to walk into that tree. During our hike we met a few thru/hikers we hadn’t met before. We met two young girls, Ladybird and her cousin Lindsay (no trail name) heading to Katadin from Pearsburg, Virginia. We also met Portrait, who  started in Georgia on April 1st and was doing his second thru hike of the AT. He’d hiked it in 2011. He carried a large camera in a front pouch, hence his trail name. He was amused to see Easy, Roots and I all sporting white beards and wearing similar blue T-shirts. As we sat together on a log , he pulled out his camera and took our picture.

The air was a few degrees lower in the water but still uncomfortable. The climbs we did were all difficult and very steep. It wasn’t long before my T-shirt was completely soaked through with perspiration and my legs were dirty from the dust and dirt on the trail. After about 8 miles of hiking, I passed the 700th mile I’ve hiked since leaving Harpers Ferry on April 19. Reaching mile 700 on day 70 means, of course, that my average thus far is 10 miles per day. For the majority of hikers, the average is 13 miles per day over the entire 2193 miles. I expect my average will go down or remain the same through New Hampshire and Maine but go up when I hike the southern half, which will be less difficult (note: the whole trail is difficult, some sections are less so than others).About 11:30, my stomach growling with hunger, we came out onto VT Route 12 and walked 1/2 mile to the On the Edge Farm. There’s a water spigot, picnic tables and a port-a-pottie for hikers. I bought blue Gatorade, blueberry pastry and a pint of Hershey’s Raspberry chocolate ice cream. It was the first ice cream I’d had in a very long e time. Sitting at the picnic table in the shade, other hikers joining us, felt a perfect summer day. After finishing up the pastry and ice cream, I went back and got a blueberry lemon soda. It was also delicious. We all continued on our hike. Roots and I hiked to a stealth site on top of a small mountain, 1700 feet, where we setup camp. It was too far to the next shelter but we wanted to go far enough that we can make tomorrow’s hike to Hanover more manageable. Easy finished his hike somewhere short.

We packed up, had breakfast and started hiking by 6 to, hopefully, beat the heat. No such luck. It was very warm and humid already. In fact, temperatures were in the low 90s and humidity was oppressive. Late in the day it rained a little but that only made it more humid. 
We hiked the trail, some moderate climbs, some roots and rocks. Much of it was easy packed dirt or covered in soft pine needles. About 11am we came to a trailhead where the trail turns to a road walk to go through the little town of West Hartford, Vermont. There at the trailhead was a cooler full of soda pop and water on ice. There was a book inside to sign and leave comments for Karen, the trail angel who left the cooler there for hikers. I left a nice comment and my signature Bookworm. On such a hot, sultry day the cold orange soda I drank was an absolute godsend. 
Roots and I set off on the walk through town. We walked past one beautiful house with a large front porch. As we both admired the late 19th century New England house, a young boy about 10 years old came walking down the driveway towards us. Elliot, our second trail angel of the morning, said we were welcome to some fresh baked coffee cake, as he held out a plate. We each took a piece and thanked him. 
We crossed the bridge in town over the White River and continued past other beautiful homes. I noticed a sign in front of one yellow house that said “Captain Stash” with a picture of a tent and a faucet. So we walked around back and filled our water bottles. Just then Captain Stash opened a window and welcomed us to drink lots of water, keep hydrated with this heat. Behind the house he had a large boat that he told us he takes to Florida every year. We thanked this third trail angel for the water and hiked on. 
The trail took us back into the woods for a long climb before heading back down to Norwich, Vermont. I took a break at a shelter while Roots went on ahead. 
I struggled the rest of the day in the heat and humidity with sore feet and an aching back. I had drank all my water by now. I stepped out of the woods onto Elm street in Norwich and there, again, was a cooler with soda and water left by the local hostel, Adventure Tours. Another trail angel!
From there the rest of my hike was a very long road walk in the blazing sun through neighborhoods and then to Main Street and along a highway. The trail turned east and took me to the Connecticut River. Just before 4pm, I stepped into New Hampshire, my ninth state (WV, MD, PA, NJ, NY, CT, MA, VT, NH).
Finally, I met Roots at his room at the Sixth South Street Hotel in Hanover, NH. I took a shower there and the two of us went to a nearby restaurant for dinner and a beer. Easy decided to take an extra day to get to Hanover so he was staying at a hostel in Norwich, meeting up with me in a day or two.  Roots’ three weeks on the trail had come to an end. He’d hiked from Great Barrington, MA to Hanover with Easy and I, some of it with LT. He was going to NYC to visit his daughter and grandchildren then back to Florida.

There was a lot of rock climbing and steep inclines making my progress very slow. After almost four hours I had hiked only four miles. I grew concerned because I had ten miles more to go. 
Luckily, the trail got easier. I walked into the Hikers Welcome Hostel at 2:30pm.

Bookworm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640376,"This morning I took the hostel shuttle up to Kinsman Notch trailhead to slack pack southbound. I hiked up and over  Moosilauke mountain south back to the hostel. It turned out to be good decision. I put a few snacks, latrine kit, puffy jackets, crocs and a first aid kit in my pack. It probably weighed around 6-7 lbs. 
The trail immediately goes upwards at a steep angle that seemed at times almost vertical. It follows alongside water cascades keeping the rocks wet and slippery. Some of it consists of rock “steps” and some is just roots and boulders. It is several thousand feet of some of the most steep and difficult hiking on the AT. A northbound hiker who chooses not to slack pack this section would need to negotiate these slippery rocks, with a full pack, going down. One slip and one could be seriously injured. 
The alpine scenery going up the mountain was beautiful, The landscape was covered with pines and bright green ferns. As I got closer to the summit, the trees gave way to open grass and lichen covered rocks. Above tree line, the trail was marked with large rock cairns. When I reached the summit, there were about a dozen people enjoying the view. 
The summit was just at cloud level with the sun burning off the cloud cover. In most directions the cloud cover obscured the view. But looking north, the clouds broke up revealing mountains in the distance. It was stunningly beautiful. Difficult to capture in pictures or words.

It was much better. There I was able to get a good nights sleep. 
Snapdragon and I got back on trail early, after breakfast sandwiches from the local store. The hiking today was some of the most difficult I’ve done on the AT so far. Much of the trail was extremely steep and covered with wet boulders and twisted root. It was very slow going up Wolf mountain to the Eliza Brook Shelter. We hiked an average of less than a mile per hour.
Considering how difficult the hiking was, we decided to stay at the shelter and start with fresh legs in the morning for Kinsman mountain. Will snd Dan, two high school graduates we’d met on Smarts mountain, we’re already at the shelter. Richard, who I’d been seeing on the trailhead since Graymoor in  Massachusetts, also showed up. 
Porcupine, who I had not met before, set up her tent near the shelter. Porcupine is hiking the trail from Georgia with her husband’s support. He camps in his van at nearby campgrounds and supplies her with food. Occasionally, she stays with him in the van, before heading back on trail.Several other thru hikers showed up and setup hammocks and tents for the night. One young woman was Pickle who was from Darien, NY not far from my home in Elma.

The trail crossed the stream snd then followed it upstream for a while. After crossing, I stopped to watch Snapdragon snd then Porcupine carefully make their way across the stream. Snapdragon said, ”There’s a porcupine.” Just ahead of me, on the trail, was a real porcupine. Porcupine the hiker, who had crossed safely, joined us. The animal dodged towards the stream. I took a picture with my phone, Just then, feeling cornered, it started coming towards us. We quickly backed up, giving the porcupine an opportunity to escape. Which it did. 
The trail today up to the summit and over Kinsman was not as difficult as yesterday but it was still fairly difficult. Again there was a lot climbing up boulders, steep hiking up rock steps and pulling myself up by grabbing trees or roots. 
After several hours, we reached the south peak of Kinsman, 4358 feet high. The views were spectacular. In every direction we could see mountains that went on forever. On the way down, we passed quite a few south bound hikers as well as many day hikers. 
We hiked first to the Lost Lake Hut next to Lost Lake. Inside I bought a chicken sandwich and Berry smoothie and talked with Porcupine snd her husband. It was a nice break before hiking down to the parking lot several miles away where we were to call for a shuttle. 
Just as Snapdragon and I stepped out of the woods we saw Richard. He asked if we we’re going to the Notch Hostel. A couple that had been day hiking offered Richard a ride to the hostel. They agreed to take Snapdragon and I, too. They were true trail angels.
After dinner I had a FaceTime call with my granddaughter Alaina to wish her a happy 5th birthday. Since her parents were taking her for ice cream, I joined them in spirit by eating a pint of Birthday Cake ice cream. Delicious.

Snapdragon and I decided we would wait it out and get back to the trail on Saturday. She went to stay with friends in northern Vermont; I’ve accepted the invitation of Dr. Peter Crane to stay at his home near Conway, NH. 
Peter is a trail angel who reached out to me early in my AT adventure with an offer to assist with a place to stay and help with resupply when I reached the White Mountains near his home. Thursday morning he drove over an hour from N. Conway to pick me up at the Notch Hostel and host me in his home for two days. On the way back, Peter took me to the REI outdoor store in Conway where I was able to purchase much needed trail shoes. My second pair, with over 450 miles on them, were beginning to fall apart. He also drove me to the grocery store for food resupply. 
Peter made a delicious dinner of lasagna, salad, bread and wine for dinner. For dessert we had, of course, ice cream. Friday morning he made cranberry scones along with scrambled eggs and sausage for breakfast. 
Dr. Crane is a curator for the Obs’ Gladys Brooks Memorial Library at the Mount Washington Observatory. He hikes the AT as well as other trails throughout the White Mountains and elsewhere in New England. He’s an active volunteer for a local trail club and was previously employed by the NH forest service. 
Peter lost his wife Holly in July 2019 after her “long journey with dementia and Lewy Bodies.” They’d been married over 20 years. Like Peter, Holly loved the outdoors. She was a day hiker on local trails and mountains. She also enjoyed mountain biking and downhill skiing near her home in the White mountains. Peter noted that her journey with dementia with Lewy Bodies “was unwanted, yet it was traveled with grace.” 
Saturday Peter will return me to the trail. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with him and am very grateful for his kind generosity and hospitality.

He drove me back on a different route then when he’d picked me up at the hostel so he could show me some of the other parts of the White mountain region. We went through Crawford Notch, past the Wiley house (where a landslide killed a family in the 19th century). We also went by Breton Woods, a well known resort and where President Roosevelt and Winston Churchill famously met during  WWII to make plans for a post war Europe. Then we headed west to Franconia Notch and to the Liberty trail head where I got off the AT on Wednesday. We said our goodbyes. I can’t thank Peter enough for all he did for me and hope to return with my wife for a visit after this adventure is over. I was back on the trail at 8am. 
The climb up to Liberty campsite was long and steep. At Liberty, I ran into Richard who was also going to Garfield Ridge campsite. The trail continued upwards to the Franconia ridge. The rain had passed, skies were blue and clear and it was comfortably cool for hiking . In addition, it was a Saturday so there were a lot of people heading to the ridge and mountains for the views. The views of the mountains from Franconia ridge were extraordinary, like nothing I had ever seen before. At an elevation of about 4200 feet, I could see hazy blue mountains in the far distance. The surrounding mountains were rugged and rocky with lush green pine woods all around. The trail continued along the ridge, above tree line snd then over several mountains. I hiked over the summits of Little Haystack, Lincoln mountain and Lafayette mountain at an elevation of 5260 feet. They all presented clear views under blue skies. Clouds moved in over Lafayette but soon cleared when I was on the summit. From there it was a long, steep climb down Lafayette and then a very steep and technical climb up Garfield. Then down again  to the Garfield Ridge When I reached Garfield I found that it was full of people setting up tents. Rather than wait for the caretaker, I immediately grabbed a small rocky and less than ideal area in the “overflow” tent area near the shelter. Porcupine occupied  the rest of the area; our two tents were crowded next to each other but, thankfully, we’re far enough from everyone else to give us one of the quietest areas in the camp. Painless, Random and Lost Bells were in the shelter with heavy duty snorers. Richard managed to get on a tent pad in a crowded area and Snapdragon set up her hammock in a less than ideal site under dead trees. As I crossed Franconia Ridge earlier this morning, I also walked the 800th mile (from Harpers Ferry,WV) for the Lewy Body Dementia Association.

This, plus the cool night and high humidity of the woods resulted in a lot of dew. I packed away my tent with the fly very wet. I made my usual breakfast of oatmeal and coffee in the eating area (consists of stones to sit on). I hiked out at 6:20am. 
The trail started immediately with a steep, difficult descent down Garfield mountain . The first part of the trail was a stream. I had to walk down slippery rocks with the stream flowing over them. After a while, I caught up to Random and Lost Bells. We stopped at the Guyot Hut for a break.  I bought a cup of coffee, peach cobbler and a slice of challah bread and had a piece of blueberry coffee cake which was free for thru hikers. The huts are run by the AMC (Appalachia Mountain Club) and offer bunks and food. Thru hikers get a baked good at no charge. I hiked out ahead of Random and Lost Bells. The  terrain continued to be rocky with a steep descent for hours. Then there was a difficult and steep climb up over Twin mountain, Guyot mountain and finally Zealand mountain. I eventually caught up to Snapdragon, who had started earlier. The hiking was very difficult and exhausting. By the time we reached camp my legs and feet were sore and I was mentally drained from the work of negotiating rocks, roots and boulders. In the afternoon, Snapdragon and I stopped at the Zealand hut where I bought cheesy pesto pasta and had a piece of carrot cake (free fir thru hikers). We had originally planned to camp at Ethan Pond campsite but, after the overcrowding at Garfield the previous night, we decided to check a stealth site two miles before Ethan Pond next to the Pemiwasset River. It was large enough for my tent and Snapdragon’s hammock. We had a water source and the sound of the river to make sleep easier. It was a nice, quiet spot. Better than a crowded campground.

Bookworm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640897,"This was, by far, the most difficult day on trail yet. Random, Lost Bells and I were up at 4:30 am because we knew, despite the short mileage, it would be a difficult day. The trail went above tree line where the terrain is very rocky and the weather is unpredictable. Camping is not allowed above tree line where the environment is very fragile so we had to get through the 10-11 miles of trail to get from where it goes above to where it goes down below treeline. 
Almost immediately out of the Mitzpah camping area, the trail starts upwards. From there it was a long, slow climb over jumbled boulders and rocks, first through scrub trees and then to an erie landscape of boulders and rocks covered in green lichen with grass and small evergreen bushes. Walking over the rocks was a precarious endeavor, trying to place each step on an angled or pointed rock, hoping the foot would hold and not slip or turn my ankle. This is how it went for the next several hours. As we climbed over one mountain and then another, the clouds from below rose up and the wind began to howl. And soon we felt raindrops. I quickly put the rain cover on my pack and my new rain jacket on (thankfully in my hands due to the efforts of my friends Magda, Tomek and Peter). I didn’t put on my rain pants because I thought they’d be too warm and maybe the rain would end soon anyway. The rain and wind grew stronger as Random, Lost Bells and I followed the rock cairns towards Mount Washington. It was like being in the midst of a hurricane with winds in excess of 50 mph and a driving rain that stung my face. Finally, we made it to the Lake of the Clouds Hut on the side of Washington. Porcupine was already there, sipping hot tea and waiting out the storm. I tried to warm up in my soaking wet pants and socks. I had curry pumpkin soup, tea and gingerbread. After an hour, the rain stopped. I was still feeling chilled. I put on my rain pants this time (which helped  me warm up) and we headed up to the summit. It took about an hour to get to the summit. The cloud enveloping the summit of Washington was so thick I could only see a few feet in front of me. Through the fog I could see the silhouette of the observatory. Inside, there were crowds of people who’d driven or taken the cog train to the summit (next time, that’s how I’m going up this mountain). Random, Lost Bells and I bought lunch and enjoyed the warmth inside. We left and continued our hike over more boulders and rocks. There were totter hikers making their way up to Washington. We came upon an older couple. The man had fallen and hit his head. They were hiking to the observatory to get help for him. They still had a mile to go. After a while, I got ahead of Random and Lost Bells. I made my way over torturous rocks for hours. I arrived at the spur trail to Valley View tent site and hiked the steep 1/2 mile down wet rocks, finally arriving at 7pm, the latest I every set up camp. Spoon and some others were camping there also. During the night I realized my tent was on a big rock but I was to tired to go out and move the tent.

It was not easy and my knees took a pounding but it was not as challenging as struggling through a boulder field in the fog. I was relieved to come out at Pinkham Notch where the shuttle from The Barn hostel picked us up.

For the semi slack pack, I removed everything from my backpack that I thought I could do without and included only enough food for one day. I left everything including my cook pot and stove behind at the hostel, taking instead snacks and a full size spicy Italian sub from Subway and bag of chips for my dinner. For breakfast I brought a Subway breakfast sandwich. 
Wildcat mountain faces Carter dome across Carter notch and Mount Washington across Pinkham notch and has five summits: wildcat A, B,C, D and E. The AT climbs up from Joe Carter Lodge and crosses all five peaks to Carter Dome. This was my first real experience with rock climbing. 

The hostel shuttle dropped us off at the trailhead about 8am. The trail quickly becomes a nearly vertical climb up a rock pile and then up a series of rock faces. Trekking poles were not helpful. I needed to use my hands to pull myself up and some very careful placement of my knees and feet. A fear of heights would’ve immobilized me but, luckily, I’m able to focus on the climb and not on the potential for a precipitous fall of several hundred feet. 
The trail continued up and over the peaks, up and down some difficult climbs. It took us 6 hours to “hike” six miles to the Carter hut where stopped for s break snd had tomato soup and bread. Random and Lost Bells stayed for a longer break, I moved on expecting they woul catch up. 
The climb up the mountain was slow but not difficult. From there it was more like a real trail but eventually there were several difficult descents down rock faces that made me uneasy. It took me five and half hours to hike the 7 miles to the Imp shelter campsite. I worried, as the light faded, that I’d be hiking this dangerous terrain in the dark. I was able to get in at 7:30 pm, setup my tent and inhale my sandwich before collapsing in my tent. Random snd Lost Bells struggled with her sore knee, arriving at the campsite in the dark two hours later.

After setting back into the hostel, we all went to Walmart for our resupply. Random and Lost Bells bought food to make a Mexican dinner Saturday evening and I purchased food to make breakfast Saturday morning. 
When we returned, several of us met at an Noona’s Kitchen, an Italian restaurant in town to celebrate completing the White mountains. Painless, Freefall, Snapdragon, Soma, Blueberry, Random, Lost Bells and I shared an Italian meal and stories from the trail.

It wasn’t too bad. There were even a few switchbacks, rare in the northeast for some reason. Trail switchbacks make a climb less strenuous and also minimize erosion. They are more common in the southern Appalachians and out west. For the rest of the day, we went up and over the Goose Eye peaks. They were some of the most difficult climbs and descents I’ve seen yet. In between peaks there were a lot of bogs. Bridges had been put in to make crossing the bogs easier but they were probably decades old and not maintained. In fact, the entire trail section looked like it had been maintained in many years. Some of the big bridges were actually under water. Between the rain, water rushing down the trail (due to a lack of switchbacks) and sunken bog bridges, I hiked the entire day with wet, cold feet. Tomorrow I get to put my wet, cold socks on again. It took us about 10 hours to hike the 9.6 miles.

The Mahoosics notch is a a deep gap in the mountains of Maine where there is a one mile section of trail filled with boulders. To traverse this section hikers must climb over, around and sometimes under these giant boulders. Several times we had to remove our packs and push them through a hole for someone else to grab while we squeezed through. It was like a playground but would’ve been more fun and less exhausting without a pack. It took us a little over two hours, which is faster than average. 
After the notch is Mahoosic Arm mountain, said to be one of the steepest climbs on the entire AT, a 1500 ft climb in one mile to an elevation of 3790 feet.

Belch and Hangin’ were at a shelter in Virginia in 2019 when James Louis Jordan showed up. They had met him earlier and recognized he was someone they should avoid, if possible. They had heard he’d gotten off trail but here he was, back on it. Jordan wasn’t a hiker. He was a drifter living in shelters on the AT. And he was someone with mental issues. Some time during the night of May 11th, Jordan began acting erratically and pulled a knife. About 1am he chased Belch and Hangin’ through the woods with his knife drawn. Belch talked about how frightening it was to be running through the dark woods with a mad man coming for them. Luckily, they had headlamps and Jordan did not. Unable to find them, Jordan finally gave up the chase, returned to the shelter and murdered Ronald Sanchez, Jr. and critically injured another hiker, Kirby Morrill. Jordan was eventually caught. 
Jordan was arrested and charged but declared mentally unfit, suffering from schizoaffective disorder and acute symptoms of psychosis. He was committed to a mental institution. Although crimes do occasionally occur on the Appalachian Trail, violent crimes are extremely rare. There have been 10 murders in nearly 50 years on the AT. Statically, the AT is hundreds of times safer than any US city. Belch and Hangin’ felt safe and confident enough to return to the trail and finish their hike.

The trail wound through pine forests, up and over 3360 foot high Lone mountain and just below the summit of Spaulding mountain. Then there was a long descent to the west branch of the Carrabasset River. The descent was difficult- a very steep climb down a boulder covered mountainside.
I met several SOBO hikers (southbound, Maine to Georgia) at the start of their journey, and a few day hikers. An older woman and a woman in her thirties told me they were hiking two 4000 foot mountains though I wasn’t sure which ones since these were below that height.
 I crossed the river and made my way on a rock strewn trail through moss covered woods finally arriving at the camping area about 2:30 pm. The others who’d left before me had their tents setup. We’re camping near Crocker Cirque, an amphitheater shaped valley formed by glacial erosion. Also said to be a spot where moose hang out. Though I’ve seen a lot of moose scat on the trail, I’ve yet to see a moose in New Hampshire or Maine (I’ve seen many on my canoe trips in Canada). Since hiking through remote parts of Maine, cell service and internet has been sporadic. Sometimes I have service near mountain tops, other times I don’t. In low lying areas I never do. Most shelters and camp areas are in low areas. Crocker Cirque campsite is an exception. It makes keeping in contact with home challenging.

It was steep at first but then got a little easier. There was a short spur trail on top of south Crocker to an open area for views looking south. North Crocker was tree covered with no views. The hike down was long but not too technical, mostly just rocks and roots. Painless and Gadget arrived at the trailhead on ME 27 long before I did and, instead of waiting for the 1pm pickup, they called the hostel for a special pickup. When I arrived about 11:30 I ran into Dan, Porcupine’s husband. He was waiting for her; she came along shortly after me. Dan offered to drive me to the hostel, I accepted. The Hiker Hostel of Maine is the nicest hostel I’ve stayed at yet. A large log cabin with a long front and side porch, it’s beautiful and inviting. There’s private rooms and bunk rooms. The bunk is comfortable and clean. They also have the food for sale most hikers need for resupply. They served a spaghetti dinner with Italian bread and salad, donation based. As well as a breakfast before taking us back to the trail. Unlike most hostels, which sometimes resemble frat houses for hikers, this is a place anyone could stay and feel comfortable at.

Justin, the owner of the hostel, drove five of us hikers to the trailhead. Solitaire, a SOBO (southbound from Katadin) headed south, the rest of us- Gadget, Painless, Hamlet and I- hiked north. 
Hamlet, who also stayed at the hostel, is a thru hiker who started in Georgia in late February. He attained his trail name because he memorized the soliloquy from Shakespeare’s Hamlet (“To be or not to be…). He has memorized other quotations such as Theodore Roosevelt’s famous “man in the ring” speech. Hamlet retired from the Coast Guard Reserves as a Master Chief (E-8) in public relations. He’s the third former Coast Guard member I’ve met on the trail. 
Most of the trail today was full of ankle torturing rocks and roots but some of the trail was almost devoid of rocks and roots, almost a red carpet of pine needles. However, with 4-5 miles to go, near the end of the day, it began to rain. 
The others made it to camp earlier, before it rained much, but Hamlet and I hiked in pouring rain. We arrived late and setup our tents in the rain, never an easy task. I cooked myself a dinner and ate, even though I just wanted to go to sleep. 
It was a long, exhausting hike but we had completed the Bigelow range, the last big climbs until Katadin.

One thousand miles. I did it but I can’t quite believe it. That’s a lot of hiking, a lot of mountains, a lot of rocks and roots to stumble over. But I did do it. I walked 1000 miles for several reasons, one is to raise awareness of LBD and donations for LBDA. I want express my appreciation to all who have donated thus far. Thank you.
As usual, I was the last to get on trail this morning. No one else cooks a breakfast, plus I’m just kind of slow. I hiked alone, listening to an audible book much of the time. The trail was full of rocks and roots but there wasn’t much elevation since conquering the Bigelow range. 
After several miles, I caught up to Hamlet. We hiked together for awhile, occasionally talking. About noon we stopped and sat on a log to eat lunch. As we were sitting there, along came a young woman I recognized. It was Beast, who I first saw in Pennsylvania and last saw at the church hostel in Delaware Water Gap, hundreds of miles and many, many weeks ago. 
We all ended up at the Pierce Pond lean to (note: shelters are referred to as lean-tos in Maine). The shelter faced the pond, really a small lake, and a strong wind was blowing off the pond. So I setup my tent behind the lean to hoping it would block some of the wind. It did but the ground was sloped so I spent the night sliding down my pad.

Harrison’s is a traditional Maine sporting camp, catering primarily to hunters snd anglers. The main building is rustic log cabin with smaller cabins nearby for guests to stay while they go fishing or hunting in the ponds or woods. It was built in the 1930s and has the look of what was popular than, hunter trophies mounted on the walls, a big fireplace and dark, wood panel decor. 
But of course, hikers go their for its food: it’s big pancake breakfast is talked about on the trail. We went the night before and made our reservations with Tim, the owner. 
Nine of us sat around the big wood table, talking and drinking coffee. Tim, a scruffy, unshaven man in his mid-60s came out with plates piled high with pancakes. The pancakes were full of raspberry, Apple and blueberries - red, white and blue. He placed a plate of twelve good sized pancakes in front of each of us. Then he brought out a plate for each with scrambled eggs and sausage. I’m not sure what is more amazing- the amount of food we each had or the fact that I knew I could eat it all without a problem and possibly room for more (ice cream, perhaps?). 
As we devoured the delicious breakfast, Tim went over to the piano and sat down. He looked at us, satisfied that we were enjoying his cooking and proceeded to play music while we ate. It was a truly magical morning. 
After breakfast, we thanked Tim, put on our packs and continued on the trail. About 4 miles of fairly easy hiking later, I arrived at the Kennebec River. The river is known to raise dramatically, without notice, when the dam upstream is opened. The AT continues on the far side so there’s a ferry to safely transport hikers. Every day from 9am to 2pm, a man and his dog wait for hikers to transport them, two at a time, in an Old Town canoe. 
There were ten of us this morning, each taking their turn to cross the river. Once on the other side, we hiked a short distance up to Route 201 where a van from the The Sterling Inn picked us up and brought us to the 150 year old inn. Painless and I shared a room in this beautiful, renovated building that has welcomed travelers to the north woods since before the Civil War. Ironically, the current owner of The Sterling Inn grew up in East Aurora, New York just a few miles from Elma where I currently live.

He hiked as fast as any twenty year old I’ve seen so I was unable to keep up with him. 
The trail was not too difficult, not a lot of elevation change. I made it to the shelter about 3pm. It looked like rain was coming so I claimed a spot in the shelter rather than put up my tent. I usually prefer my tent. It’s more comfortable and private. But it’s no fun taking a tent down in the rain or putting a wet tent in my pack. 
Shortly after we arrived, a southbound hiker came along and joined us in the shelter. Mermaid lived in Los Angeles, originally from the Czech Republic. She said she’d already hiked the Pacific Crest Trail. 
We all crawled into our sleeping bags and listened to the rain on the shelter’s metal roof.  It rained all night.

Shaw’s is probably the most well known hostel on the trail. It has been in operation for over 40 years. It’s a popular stop for northbound hikers about to enter the 100 mile wilderness. 
The mix of hikers is surprising. More than half the hikers staying at the hostel appear to be in their 50s and 60s. The balance are in their early 20s. Here at Shaws I see more twenty somethings than I’ve seen in the past week or two. I have not seen many of the younger hikers that I was seeing often. 
I’ve heard many older hikers comment recently on the amount of drug us on the trail. Like them, I find it sadly disturbing. I’ve bee told there is some using powerful illicit drugs but I’ve only witnessed pot smoking. The majority are younger people, occasionally I’ve seen a few older people smoking pot. What I find most disturbing is that they seem to be smoking it all through the day, like an addiction. They smoke when they wake up, at the end of the day and take breaks throughout their hike to smoke. It appears that many cannot function without it. 
Sadly, this is probably the future of the trail, contrary to its original intent of bringing people out into the natural world.

Tomorrow we enter the “100 mile wilderness” section. This part of the trail between Monson and Abol campground, approximately 100 miles, takes 6-7 days to hike through. There’s no easy resupply points, no hostels or anything else easy to access so it requires more planning than usual. 
Seven days of food weighs about 14 pounds, which is a lot of added weight to carry. So five of us, Painless, Hamlet, Detox, Redman and I agave agreed to join in Shaws resupply drop. For $95, someone from Shaws will meet us at a pre-designated location and time near halfway with the food we need to complete the 7 day journey, cutting in half the food weight we need to carry.
Through this next section I expect to only have cell service briefly on mountain tops. When possible, I’ll text my wife and let her know I’m ok. I’ll need to conserve my phone battery and charger for the long duration. Nor will I have cell service to update my journal or post on Facebook.

For some reason the GPS AT guide, Guthooks, stopped working. I need it to know where I am on the trail and where shelters and water sources are. Luckily I caught up to Fresh Air who was able to tell me where I was and how far the lean-to was. 
Guthooks works by GPS and doesn’t require cell service. For most hikers today it’s indispensable. On the rare occasion when one gets off trail, a look at Guthooks will help you quickly find it. Guthooks shows where all the shelters, camp sites and water sources are, as well as where views and other significant locations are along or near the trail. Also, there’s a place for hikers (and others) to add comments with updated information such as when water sources are flowing well or dry. Most thru hikers have it on their phone. 
Like most, I also carry Awol’s AT guide (Awol hiked the trail in the late 90s and then created the annual guide). “Awol,” as it’s referred to, is available in paper and pdf (for the phone). It has information similar to Guthooks but does not work with GPS. However, it has lots of information about hostels, hotels and other services for hikers (Guthooks is not as useful for this information). Awol is used primarily for planning.

A few minutes after leaving I came upon Hamlet videoing something. Then I saw a moose walk-in away. Later we met hiker porcupine on the trail, hadn’t seen her in a while.
Hiking was difficult today with several steep ups and downs, rock climbs. Very exhausting. The Chairback mountain range is the most difficult climb in this part of Maine.Eventually, I was at a high enough elevation to get cell service. I deleted Guthooks from my phone and was able to reload it. It took a while and used precious battery (I had to rely on my Anker portable charger until I got to Miller’s in more than a week). Like many who started in Georgia, over 2000 miles ago, Detox is struggling with knee pain. He says it’s probably from hiking so many big mile days up and down mountains. The steep downhills can be especially tough on the knee joints. Your body weight plus pack weight come crashing down over and over again for hundreds, sometimes over 1000 feet of descent. Going up a mountain, you sometimes must lift all that weight with one leg. I use my trekking poles all the time to distribute some of the downhill weight or uphill climbs to them. Detox is so close to finishing, he is pushing through. Hopefully there’s no permanent damage and his knee fully recovers. I’m amazed at those who rarely or never use trekking poles. Dozens of times a day they’ve prevented me from losing my balance and falling. Every day they’ve been helpful when climbing up or descending a mountain. Most hikers do use them. 
Redman has trekking poles but he rarely uses them. Yet, he goes downhill with such speed and flexibility I can’t keep up with him. He’s slower going up. But for a seventy year old man, he hikes just fine. I not only hope I can hike like Redman when I’m his age,? I hope I can hike like him when I do the southbound hike in about a week.

But we all agreed, if the trail was not as difficult with rocks and big roots we would probably go further to a lean-to at 17 miles. It seemed like a long hike with four mountains of the White Cap range to go over. But if we could do the longer miles, we’d have no more mountains until the big one, Katadhin. I hiked most of the early part with Hamlet. When we got to the summit of the second mountain and stopped for lunch, Redman came along. He had stopped for lunch at the lean-to we’d just passed. We should have stopped there, too. At least to get water from the stream. 
When we got to the campsite we’d planned to possibly stay at, I went to get water from the spring. However, it was barely a trickle. I couldn’t seem to get any water. Hamlet and Redman were low on water and I was almost out. They both shared a little of their water with me to help me get the remaining 5 miles to the lean-to, which was by a stream. I was clearly getting dehydrated. Luckily, the trail was not too bad, except in places. The summit of White Cap was a boulder field, making it very difficult to cross. It was open and exposed which wasn’t good since we heard thunder approaching. Soon it began to rain.

With the trail so much better and faster, Hamlet and I planned to take advantage of the extra time. We wanted to stop at Crawford pond to wash and possibly swim in the water. Not having taken a shower since Thursday morning, before leaving the hostel, plus hiking in the heat, humidity and rain, we felt very dirty. As we got closer, we met Porcupine on the trail and let her know our plan. 
At a road crossing just before the pond, someone from The Appalachian Trail Lodge in Millinocket was dropping of a cache of food for some SOBO hikers. We talked to him for a few minutes. He gave us information about getting a campsite in Baxter park. 
Porcupine, Hamlet and I Athena went to the pond. There was a nice, white sandy beach. As we arrived, the sun came out. All three of us waded in and washed. Then I heard someone call out, “Hamlet?!” from the woods. It was Painless who was hiking by and heard Hamlet’s deep voice. Soon all of us were in the water. Hamlet, Painless and I went out in deeper water and went under. It was so nice and refreshing, almost as good as a shower. 
When I made it to Cooper Brook Fall Lean-to I found Redman and Detox were already there. They had passed by the pond. Cooper Brook Falls cascaded down to a pool deep enough to swim in right next to the shelter and camping area. We all set up our tents in a row next the Brook. Redman, Detox, Hamlet and Painless all went for a swim. I relaxed on the rocks. 
Later, as we were standing around talking about the upcoming days while eating our dinners, a man who was staying in the shelter came down to talk to us. Preacher (his trail name because he actually was a Baptist pastor) had hiked the trail twenty years ago when he was 50 years old. He told us what it was like being on the trail when the 9/11 attacks occurred. Some, he advised, needed to leave the trail and return to their families immediately; others, he said, could do nothing more than continue their hike.
He talked about how he’d found it to be a life changing experience. He got emotional remembering the day he climbed Katadhin. He remembered in that moment all those who’d helped him complete the journey: family, friends, trail angels and other hikers. 
It struck me, as he spoke, that I too was on a personal journey guided and supported by so many, including my wife, Marie, my kids Brian and Monica, other family, friends, Peter Crane, the trail angels, shuttle drivers, hostel and motel owners, and, especially , those I’ve hiked with and am currently hiking with. 
After the other guys drifted away, Preacher leaned over to me and advised that I try to use all that I learn and experience on the trail when I return to my regular life. For Preacher, this hike is a sacred journey, not to be taken lightly.

The sky was overcast but it looked like it might clear. 
Hamlet, Painless, Detox, Porcupine and I hiked in a line. The trail started out very easy and gradually became more rocky and full of roots. It also became a little steeper. As we hiked up the mountain, the trees around us were shorter eand shorter. Hamlet, Detox and Painless, anxious to complete their hikes of the AT, were soon far ahead of us. 
As we got closer to treeline, the terrain became steeper and more rocky.  Then it turned into a boulder climb. For almost two miles above the tree line, the hike was a climb up boulders. The clouds cleared away to a blue sky and views as far as the eye could see. We were going to be lucky with the weather. 
The boulder climb was fun but a little scary, especially if you have a fear of heights. Pulling myself up by my hands and trying to get my foot in place, I could look over my shoulder and see miles below to the wilderness below the mountain. 
With Redman leading us up through the boulder climb, Porcupine and I followed. Eventually we reached the top of the climb to a path that went across a large flat plane covered with boulders, rocks and grass. The path, mostly rocks, wound it’s way over a mile and up a to the summit. From a distance, we could see hikers gathered around the famous sign. 
When we reached the summit and the sign, we found Hamlet, Painless, Detox overjoyed have reached the northern terminus the Appalachian Trail that they had all hiked from Springer mountain in Georgia, 2,193 miles away. Also there was Strider, who we had first met in Monson. Strider took a group photo of all of us who’d hiked together for several weeks: Painless, Hamlet, Porcupine, Redman, Detox and I.

Although I have almost half of the trail to hike, I found it exhilarating and emotional to reach the sign I’d heard and read so much about. Summiting Katahdin, the “greatest mountain” was a major milestone for me similar to the way it is to Hamlet and Painless. I had completed more than half the trail and, most importantly, the much more difficult half. I had climbed Katadhin to the northern end of the AT. **********
I don’t think it can be emphasized enough: most of the “hiking” from Hanover, New Hampshire through southern Maine and a little of the 100 Mile Wilderness- the Bigelows, Chairback mountain ranges and, of course,Katahdin- is not easy hiking. In fact, some of it is not hiking at all, it’s rock climbing. In those parts where there weren’t boulders to climb over, around and under, there was a tangle of giant tree roots and large, slippery rocks to stumble over. 
Much of the trail from Harpers Ferry to Hanover was difficult but it hardly compared to The White mountains through southern Maine.  Some of it, particularly the Wildcats and into southern Maine was sometimes very dangerous and frightening. In some places I feared a slip could end with broken bones or worse. I had never expected the trail to become so difficult and dangerous. But I made it through safely without injury, as did most of my hiking partners. Others had minor injuries that ended their hike. I commend all those who struggled through the northern sections. 
I congratulate all those who successfully completed the trail, especially my friends Hamlet, Painless and Detox. What an accomplishment!

Bookworm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642607,"I’m on the trail again. I took a break at home to visit family and friends as well as to rest. I also repaired and replaced some gear. Having completed the northern half and with my break now over, I have resumed my flip flop hike of the Appalachian trail and returned to Harper's Ferry, West Virginia to hike south to Georgia (SOBO).
My hiking partner Easy would often start our morning hike by playing a song on his phone or singing a few bars of Willie Nelson’s song, “On the Road Again” substituting his own lyrics….”on the trail again. Just can’t wait to get on the trail again….” So, here I go- on the trail again... 
I'm anticipating this leg of the hike will be different than the first half. The terrain and elevation will be more forgiving, I'm a more experienced and physically able hiker than when I started in Harper's Ferry in April (I already have ""trail legs). The weather will be different. Its hot in the south and its hurricane season. This will be a new and different adventure. 
My wife Marie and our son Brian made the six plus hour journey to return me to Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. We had breakfast at the Waffle House, my first visit to this important southern institution. We visited the local sites and historic park. Then the three of us walked on the section of the AT from the Maryland border and south across the bridge over the Shenandoah River.
We visited the Appalachian Trail Conservancy headquarters, which was closed (due to the pandemic) when I was here to start my hike in April. The volunteer at the ATC took my picture and officially added me to their logbook of 2021 thru hikers.
I also hiked a section of the trail between the bridge and the next road crossing south before Brian and Marie picked me up, sort of a very short slack pack (I had no pack).After a lot of walking in the heat, we stopped at a local creamery in the village to enjoy ice cream cones. Brian had cappuccino, Marie ate candy bar ice cream and I had Blackberry ice cream in a waffle cone. First ice cream of the SOBO hike.
Tomorrow morning they’ll drop me off where I finished today so I can hike south towards Georgia.

Bookworm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643348,"Marie, Brian and I said our sad farewell when they dropped me off at the road crossing I’d hiked north from test. I’m glad I did the one mile downhill leaving me only a few hundred foot climb this morning. It made it much easier. After 40 minutes, I entered Virginia, my 11the state (WV, MD, PA, NJ, NY, CT, MA, VT, NH, ME and VA). Virginia is over 500 miles of the trail so, it’s approximately 1/4 of the total or 1/2 of my hike from West Virginia to Georgia. Hikers refer to as having the “Virginia blues” because one goes so far without the uplift of crossing into another state.It was around 90 degrees and very humid all day. A little rain might’ve cooled it off. Despite the rumbling of thunder and a few dark clouds, it hasn’t rained yet. I was headed for a stealth site a little further but since it is on a ridge, a risky place to tent when there’s lightning, so I opted for a lower elevation stealth site near a terrific water source. 
The stream near my tent is flowing good and cold (which means it’s from an underground spring- clean and cold). I changed from using the popular Sawyer Squeeze water filter to a Katydin BeFree filter I saw others using when I was hiking NOBO. It seems to filter faster and easier. 
There was very little hiking up or down today, a few times there were climbs of 2-400 feet. I was surprised to see sections with Pennsylvania style rocks. There weren’t a lot but when there was, it was bad. 
My new shoes, Inovo-8 G270’s (made in England) seem good. They are as light as the Altra Lone Peaks but much more durable. The bottom and sides are made from a harder rubber. Lone Peaks are popular because they’re light (helps prevent fatigue) but do not hold up or protect my feet from the violence of rocks and roots. 
In eight hours of hiking today, I saw a grand total of seven hikers. Based on their packs and dress, two appeared to be out for a few days. Four others had no packs and were clearly out for a day. I met one SOBO thru hiker, “Thighclops”. He started in Harpers Ferry to complete a hike he started in 2018. He said he was out of shape. He was upset because, when I came upon him, he had just realized he’d been hiking the past three miles in the wrong direction, north instead of south. It happens. 
Because there were so few others on the trail, it seemed the task of clearing cobwebs was left to me. I didn’t count but I’m sure I took down at least 100. I hope this isn’t a daily task.

But the remnants of hurricane Ida are forecasted to bring rain today and all day tomorrow. There will be strong winds with over 3” of rainfall. It would be unpleasant and even dangerous to be on the trail. Like every other hiker, I’m seeking refuge from the storm. 
I arrived at the Bears Den Hostel before noon. I would’ve liked to hike further but the next safe refuge is too far to hike to within a day. 
There are three others staying here, all beginning their hikes to Georgia. One hiker, Soundscape, summited Katahdin August 9th. He knows Porcupine and hiked with  Snapdragon and Baby Steps. The trail is a unique community. The three of us, Sick, Soundscape and I walked over to the Bears Den Brewery for dinner and a beer. When we returned, some new hikers were at the hostel. One is Blueberry who I had met when he was hiking with the Sutton family (Little Man, the 5 year old that just finished the AT). Blueberry got off the trail in Gorham, NH, after an injury.

As the storm cells passed we experienced periods of torrential rain. The winds picked up as the day went on and the weather service issued a tornado watch. In some areas they issued a flood watch. 
During the night I could hear it raining hard. I doubt my tent or even a shelter would’ve been able to keep me dry or safe. 
It’s difficult to sit around all day, wanting to hike and knock out some miles. But it would’ve been miserable hiking in this weather and dangerous to be in the woods with limbs and trees coming down. During a lull in the rain, some of us visited the Bears Den Brewery less than half a mile away. Most of the day I read a book on my phone, “The Pioneers” by David McCullough or looked on line at the weather. 
Bears Den Lodge Hostel is a good place to zero, if one has to be off trail. It is short walk off the AT so there was no need to call for a shuttle. It was built in 1933 as a summer home for Dr. Huron Lawson, a professor emeritus in obstetrics and gynecology at The George Washington University, and his wife, Francesca Kaspari, a soprano singer. It was designed to look like a medieval castle, like ones they had seen in Europe.The living room was designed to be Francesca’s recital room, a curved room with good acoustics. There are also two small stone structures. One was used as a ticket booth for admission to Dr. Lawson’s petting zoo. He charged five cents as admission to the zoo and for visitors to picnic and access the Bears Den overlook. The other stone structure was the well house.
After the Lawsons died the property changed hands a few times. After the AT was rerouted nearby, the PATC (Potomac Appalachian Trail Club) acquired the Lawson property in 1984. Today the Bears Den Trail Center is a nonprofit organization offering an array of services, including a hostel with full services, accommodations for group or private party rentals and retreats, a primitive campground and a there’s a rustic cottage for rent.
There are no bears dens in the area, the origination of the name is unknown.

You hike up a few hundred feet and down a few hundred feet several times over 14 miles. I found it mildly annoying there were no views when I reached the tops of the hills but, other than that, it was no big deal. I wouldn’t have noticed them except for the signs telling me I had entered and then left. The trail, with a few exceptions, was surprisingly easy today. There were hardly any roots or rocks at all- just a flat gravel trail. I had to duck or climb over blowdown-huge trees laying across the trail- from yesterday’s storm in quite a few places. 
The intense heat and humidity let up finally. It was pleasant and sunny all day. A great day for hiking. I got to know Sic a little better, hiking with him part of the day. He’s a retired Army flight medic who did time in Iraq and Afghanistan and earned a Bronze Star. He seems like a nice guy.

It hurt quite a bit but the pain gradually subsided and was gone. 
In Shenandoah National Park there are a few wayside restaurants within reach of the trail. We were going to stop at Elkwallow Wayside for lunch. We hiked the six miles and arrived by 10am. We decided to wait until the restaurant opened at 11. 
Before I began my hike, Todd Graham, Executive Director at LBDA had contacted me about my efforts to fundraise and raise awareness of Lewy Body Dementia. He lives in Virginia, an hour and a half from Shenandoah National Park and was interested in meeting me when my hike brought me through the area. I had let him know I was in the park so he and his friend (and supporter of LBDA), Bill Reap drove out to see me. 
It was great to meet Todd and Bill. We had a nice visit talking about Lewy Body, LBDA and the trail. He gave me some t-shirts and also brought drinks for me and my hiking partners. And he bought us all lunch. We enjoyed the burgers, fries and blackberry milkshakes at a picnic table under a tree. After about two hours, Bill and Todd- trail angels from LBDA-headed home and the four hikers went back on the trail.

The young woman who registered us took our hiker humor in stride, quickly fielding jokes about having to walk uphill or wanting a shuttle.

We started our hike this morning about 7:30, went 3 miles across the Tye River to the base of The Priest mountain. It was not a technical climb, like the mountains in New Hampshire or steep like Vermont. It was just a long slog uphill. It’s 4062 feet to the summit, an ascent  of approximately 3000 feet over 4 miles. There were switchbacks, which are also rare in the north. It took me 2-1/2 hours to reach the summit. We stopped at The Priest shelter for lunch and a nice long break. The climb in the morning heat taxed all of us. Then we hiked on, completing 14 miles for the day. 
Of course with my trail name “Bookworm” I do read some before sleeping. When I hike, I sometimes listen to audible books- something I picked up from Dallas and a few other hikers. If the hike isn’t technical or require exceptional attention, I’ll listen to a book for an hour or two. 
When I’m hiking I sometimes listen to C.S. Lewis’ “Mere Christianity”, a book I’ve previously read. I found it a little dry to listen to and, unfortunately, Lewis tries to use a form of reasoning that seems unsuitable for his argument. The past few days I’ve been listening to Philip Roth’s “A Plot Against America.” Roth, now deceased, is one of my favorite fiction writers and certainly one of America’s greatest authors having received numerous awards, including the Pulitzer. It’s an alternate history in which Charles Lindbergh defeated FDR to become President. Lindbergh (who was known to be an anti semite and admirer of Hitler) turns the US towards Facism. It probably seemed far fetched when the novel was published in 2004.
At night, when I have energy, I’ve been reading David McCullough’s “The Pioneers”, about the settling of the Northwest Territories of the US. I sometimes read a short story by Ernest Hemingway or an essay from the recent climate change book, “All We Can Save.”

As we started back on the trail, Blueberry spied a huge caterpillar. It was light green, segmented and about 5” long, and almost an inch across. It also had two sets of antennas that looked like horns. We marveled and took pictures for a few minutes, this was the highlight of the day. Soundscape looked it up on his phone app and concluded it was a Regal Moth caterpillar.
The trail made its way down the mountain across two short wooden foot bridges that spanned a stream in a rock canyon and then across the James River Foot Bridge, the longest foot bridge on the Appalachian Trail. 
About five miles into today’s hike, I crossed the 1400 milestone: 1400 miles hiked for the Lewy Body Dementia Association. 
After 13 miles in the heat, humidity, sun and almost no breeze, we finally made it the shelter area. Butterfingers was already there and setup in the shelter.. We setup our tents, made our dinners and talked about our plans for the remainder of the journey. 
We would all like to stay together. Soundscape is committed to being completed by November 14th. That date aligns with a commitment 2HATZ has and my desire to finish before Thanksgiving. Blueberry has a conflicting commitment that may make it difficult for him to stay on our schedule, however. 
That’s the nature of a thru hike. Most people start alone and join with others. Sometimes events or conflicting plans cause hikers to separate from each other. I guess that’s what HYOH, “hike your own hike” means. 
After having our dinners and hanging our food bags (there are no bear boxes or poles in this part of Virginia), everyone drifted away to retire to their tents and hammock. Minutes later it began to rain. It sounds like an all night rain.

Bookworm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644269,"It rained lightly all night but it was over before I woke at 6:15. I usually carry 1 to 1-1/2 liters of water to hike around 10 miles. Usually there are water sources along the way. 
I remember Kindle, a hiker I met up north, once said she doesn’t “carry water to water.” At 2lbs per liter, it doesn’t make sense to carry excess water if you can get it along the way. Of course, I don’t want to stop every few miles to filter water but to carry a liter and stop every 5-10 miles is fine. 
Some people don’t filter water if they see it coming out of the ground or think it’s a pure source. For the few minutes it takes, I don’t believe it’s a good idea to drink unfiltered water: I always filter unless it’s from a tap. 
On the AT, there are many sources: ponds, streams, rivers, lakes and springs. I avoid all except springs, if possible. My second choice is streams. Pond, lake and river water tends to smell unpleasant. Filtered, it may be safe but less so than a spring. Filtered water from a spring coming right out of the ground is the best. It’s clear, cold and refreshing. It is, in fact, much better than tap water. 
The water sources going south from Harpers Ferry have been scarce in many stretches. Today was no exception. I filled a liter and a half from the stream at Matt’s Creek Shelter, hoping it was enough to get me to the next source 9 miles away. 
It was not as hot today but it was very humid. I perspired all the way, soaking my clothes. The water source at  9 miles was from a spring. Unfortunately, it wasn’t a flowing spring but a puddle where the water seeped up through the ground. According to comments in Guthooks, the water source at the shelter we were going to was doubtful. And the next reliable source was 5 miles past that. 
We needed water to drink on the way to the shelter, as well as water to make dinner and tomorrow’s breakfast. Plus we needed water to get us to the next source tomorrow. So we each scooped 3-4 liters from this source and carried it the 3 miles and 1000 feet up to the next shelter. An extra 6-8 lbs in my pack felt like 100 lbs going uphill. Lucky we did because the spring at the shelter was completely dry. Without water, you can quickly get into a crisis situation. 
A northbound hiker stopped and talked to us. He said water sources are unreliable the next 80 miles heading south. We’ll have to plan carefully. Today was my 38th wedding anniversary. All day I thought about how I wished I was home with my wife, Marie and how much she’s enduring while I’m out here hiking. It’s days like this when I doubt this was a good idea. I wish we were together today and every day. She’s the most important person in my life. I’m forever grateful that I married her 38 years ago.

Bookworm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644270,"About 3 miles into our hike, I made a wrong turn down a side trail. It wasn’t marked so I didn’t realize it for quite a while. When I did, I turned around and hoofed it uphill back to the intersection. I assumed that my detour put me well behind everyone else so I did double time to catch up. 
I was hiking along pretty fast with my earphones in, listening to music. Suddenly I heard howling which I didn’t think was part of the music. I pulled out one earpiece. I heard the howling and barking of dogs. And it was getting closer. 
Suddenly, a pack of hound dogs came around the corner on the trail in front of me, about a dozen dogs running right at me. I was stunned but not frightened. They all wore collars with antennas and didn’t appear threatening. They began circling me, running into the woods and back towards me. Eventually, all but three took off back down the trail. The three hounds followed me for about 2 miles despite my telling them to go home. It was a very strange experience. Apparently, bear hunting dogs are allowed to just run around in the woods.
Despite hiking as fast as I could I never caught up to the other guys. I believe they probably got off trail for a break and I may have passed them. 
Eventually I met 2HATZ at a shelter, taking a break with Butterfingers and PBS. We saw Butterfingers off and on the past few days. I’d heard of PBS but hadn’t met her before. We were going to Middle Creek Campground but they were hiking on further. 
2HATZ and I hiked on to Jennings Creek road where a shuttle was picking us up to take us to the campground. When we got to the road, PBS and Butterfingers were there. 
“We reconsidered when we saw the sign.” Behind them was a sign for the campground, advertising ice cream and milkshakes. 
We booked a cabin for all six of us. It had bunks and air conditioning. Shortly, Blueberry and Soundscape arrived, too. Soundscape, Blueberry, PBS and I enjoyed some time in the pool. Then we took showers, did our laundry and had dinner at the camp store. 
The skies darkened and it began to pour. PBS and Butterfingers were glad they changed their plans and joined us.

Bookworm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644303,"We had breakfast at the campground store. I had scrambled eggs, sausage, a biscuit, coffee and orange juice. It was pretty good. I like eggs for breakfast because it holds me over longer than many other breakfast foods. After breakfast the woman at the store drove us back to trail. The store didn’t open until 8 so we didn’t get on trail until almost 9am. 
It was a long hike but much of the trail wasn’t too hard to walk on. I hiked mostly alone with the others behind or in front of me. I was going to stop for a break at a shelter. But notes in Guthooks indicated there might not be water there. So I hiked another 2 miles to the Harvey Knob Overlook. 
I was surprised when I got there to see about 30 cars and lots of people with binoculars. Then I saw a sign that read, “Harvey Knob Hawk watch” I sat down on a hill to enjoy the view, the birdwatchers and eat my lunch of tuna on crackers. 
It began to sprinkle so I moved under one of the few trees which happen to be near a table set up with food for the hawk watchers. Soon after Butterfingers showed up, a few minutes later, a man offered us water, fresh grapes and an apple and cinnamon dessert he had in a crockpot on the table. 
A few minutes later, Soundscape arrived and, after him, PBS came along. We all enjoyed the delicious food offered by the birdwatchers. After our lunch on the lawn with the terrific view and trail magic, we went back on the trail. 
This section of the AT follows the Blue Ridge Parkway. It winds alongside the road and every few miles crosses it. 
Less than a mile later, the trail went across another overlook. PBS arrived first and was offered a soda and a candy bar by another birdwatcher. When I came along a minute later he gave me his last soda, a can of ice cold Orange Crush, a soda I actually like. Soundscape came along and ws offered candy bars. 
As we continued hiking across the parking area, a car pulled up with two young women in it. “Hey, are you all thru hikers?” I told her we were. She gave us three apples she happened to have. She told us she’d hiked up Katadhin on August 10th, the day after Soundscape and just three days before me. Its amazing how people like to help thru hikers when they see them. And it’s usually just what the hiker needs. Arriving at Wilson Creek Shelter, we had to be careful. Notes in Guthooks said there was  hornets nest under the shelter. There was a section hiking couple from Floida also camping there for the night. We all sat at the picnic table making our meals and talking. I attached my stove to the fuel tank and fired it up to heat water for my meal. 2Hatz, sitting across from me first saw the flame coming from where the stove and tank connected. I immediately reacted by throwing the assembly away from the table. The tank is under pressure so I feared it may explode. Luckily, the flame went out. I disposed the stove and will get a replacement at the outfitter in Daleville.

Bookworm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644386,"I woke around 4am to the sound of 2Hatz rummaging in his tent, the buzzing of hornets and raindrops falling on my tent. 2Hatz makes himself coffee at 4am every morning, I don’t know why. I’m a light sleeper so I usually hear him, if I’m nearby. I usually fall back to the. This morning I woke and didn’t go back to sleep. 
There were several day and section hikers at the shelter, in addition to the four of us. Notes in Guthooks indicated there was a hornets nest under the shelter, which is one reason no one stayed in it. They were flying all around the campsite which made me especially nervous since I’ve been stung four times in a little over a week. Luckily, no one was stung. 
It had rained off and on through the night. After getting dressed, I was able to make my way with my headlamp in the pitch black to use the privy and bring down Soundscape’s and my bear bags. I’d hung them together last night. Just as I dropped Soundscape’s food bag at his tent and climbed into mine, it started to pour. 
Since my stove malfunctioned yesterday, I asked Soundscape to boil a cup of water for me so I could make oatmeal and coffee while sitting in my tent.
Soon it stopped raining and I was able to take down my wet tent and pack up my wet backpack. Wearing my wet clothes and a wet pack, I hiked out of camp with Soundscape and 2Hatz. We had decided to hike 20.5 miles to a shelter, and then 10 or 15 tomorrow. From a road, we’d then be picked up and shuttled back to Daleville to stay off trail until Thursday. The forecast calls for light rain Tuesday and downpours on Wednesday. No need to hike in the rain.
Blueberry decided not to hike with us but is instead hiking only to Daleville. He plans to get back on trail on Wednesday. He said he doesn’t mind the rain. He could be right. Sometimes it’s ok hiking in the rain. And sometimes the forecast is wrong. 
The longest I’ve hiked prior to this was 20 miles. Today I hiked 20.5 miles. Given the trail is fairly graded for many stretches, it’s not too hard on the feet, though the soles of my feet are a little sore. I find that hiking for that long gets very monotonous. For some parts, we were together, hiking and talking but for most I was hiking alone. I listened to an audible book, “The Plot Against America” for a few hours but even listening to an audible book can get boring. 
The trail goes through the town of Daleville, right next to a convenient store. Soundscape and I got there just before noon so we each bought Barbecue pork sandwiches, a slice of pizza, homemade fried cherry pie and Gatorade. After eating that, I went back in and bought some more high calorie junk food to supplement my food supply to get through tomorrow’s hike. 2Hatz showed up and did the same. 
We hiked the balance, 9.4 miles, to the Lamberts Meadow Shelter. We setup our tents and had dinner before settling for the night. Pappy, a SOBO thru hiker, who started on Katadhin in June, came along and stayed in the shelter.

I don’t mind hiking in a light rain, as long as it’s not cold. It’s not fun putting up or taking down the tent in the rain, trying to keep water out of it. I particularly like tenting near a shelter so I can get out of the rain while making meals or packing up. 
I hiked about a mile to the first of Virginia’s “triple crown” sites on the AT, Tinker Cliffs. Tinker Cliffs, at an elevation of 3000 feet, are limestone cliffs that offer stunning views of Catawaba mountain, McAfee Knob and the Blueridge mountains..or so I heard. When I arrived I could only see fog hanging just off the cliffs with any views completely obscured. I took a few pictures of the rocks and hiked on to the next site in the triple crown.
Soundscape, 2Hatz and I arrived together at McAfee Knob, the most iconic and photographed site on the Appalachian Trail. It’s named after James McAfee, an 18th century Irish-Scottish settler and is located on Catawba Mountain at an elevation of 3197 feet. The climb up is a steady 1700 feet over4 miles. In good weather, which we didn’t experience, it offers a 270 degree view of the valley. 
There were some other hikers up there who took pictures of the three of us together while we tried out different silly poses. 
Afterwards, we continued hiking south. In a few minutes the light rain turned to a downpour. We stopped at Catawba Mountain Shelter and had lunch. With it still raining, we decided to cut our hike 5 miles short and get picked up at route 311, just 2 miles from the shelter. Soundscape called the shuttle driver, Homer. 
Back at the motel in Daleville, we did the only sensible thing: we hung out at the Mexican restaurant next door and had appetizer and drinks. We weren’t the only hikers staying out of the rain. Jersey, who Soundscape hiked with and I had met when we were going north in Pennsylvania, was there. Soon PBS and Butterfingers came back from their slack pack they’d started at route 311. And Blueberry was here, too. 
About 4:30, Pootz and M&M checked into the motel. I had met them in Waynesboro, PA when I was hiking with Snapdragon. Pootz joined us snd hiked off and on until he got off due to an injury the trail in Delaware Water Gap on the PA and New Jersey border. 
They were on their way to South Carolina but stopped to visit me and to help out me and my hiking companions any way they could. 
Later, Josh Sutton (father of 5 year old Little Man) and a filmmaker friend arrived at the motel to film an interview with Blueberry for the documentary they’re making about their history making hike. 
We all got together for dinner at the Mexican restaurant, 10 AT hikers and one filmmaker sharing Mexican food and stories of the trail.

PBS and Butterfingers had slack packed from there; Soundscape, 2Hatz and I had ended our hike there due to the weather. 
Since we all hike at a different pace, we quickly spread out with Soundscape and Butterfingers in the lead, followed by 2Hatz, me and PBS. After a 3-4 miles, I crossed a cow pasture and looked behind me to see Butterfingers coming up. He and Soundscape had taken a wrong turn somewhere and hiked on the wrong trail. Now 2Hatz was in the lead. 
After about 5 miles, I realized I needed to use a restroom or dig a cat hole. I had cell service and saw on Google maps there was a gas station only a few minutes walk off the trail at a road crossing. So I went there, used the restroom, had a chocolate milk and took a short break. Then I headed back to the trail. Now I was bringing up the rear. 
When I arrived at the blue trail to Dragon’s Tooth, the last of Virginia’s triple crown,  I found PBS eating her lunch and joined her. I looked at my phone snd found messages from 2Hatz wondering what happened to me. Soundscape came walking up from Dragon’s Tooth and let us know the other guys were there. So we went to it and took pictures. It’s an impressive rock feature. 
Butterfingers, 2Hatz and I hiked the remaining miles to the shelter we decided to stay at. PBS and Soundscape hiked on. 
Soundscape, who will be getting off trail on September 27th to spend 2-3 days with his daughter, is trying to get a few days ahead of 2Hatz and I so that when he comes back on trail we will be together again. 2Hatz and I, meanwhile, are slowing down to allow Soundscape to get ahead. 
We chose to hike only 12.6 miles to Pickle Branch Shelter, in part, because water is reliable here. Going on from here, water is sparse and unreliable, despite the rain. We’ll need to carry more water than usual to get to the next water source, 6 miles before the next shelter. Water at the next shelter is not certain so we’ll need to carry a very heavy 3-4 liters that six miles.

He was planning to hike 21 miles to Bailey Gap Shelter and needed to get started early. 2Hatz and I didn’t want to hike that far, considering the climbs but the shelters are spaced at inconvenient distances so we decided, instead, to hike 16 miles to an unofficial campsite. The problem then becomes finding water sources nearby. The notes in Guthooks, though a week or two old, said many were dry including the one nearest the campsite. We hoped that wasn’t the case but couldn’t take the risk. 
Butterfingers left before light. We hiked out about 7:15, just as it started to get light down in the hollow. The hike out of the hollow up to the trail was almost half a mile climb. When we did up out of the hollow, we could see the sun had been up a while. I decided then that I needed to move my wake up alarm to 5:30am so I’m ready to hike out at first light. 
2Hatz and I hiked together most of the day. We found that if he led on the downhills and level sections, he was faster and pulled me along. Going uphill, I lead because I’m slower and I force him to slow down and keep from burning out. 
About 11:30 we stopped in the woods and sat on a big log to eat our lunch. I had a bagel with tuna on it, some Chitos and a piece of chocolate. Though the bagel is fairly high in calories, it still didn’t seem to be enough. 
As we were sitting there, a young woman in her early 30s came along. I saw she had a thru hiker hang tag on her pack. She stopped to talk a minute. Her trail name is Zebra. She was hiking SOBO, started her hike on Katadhin. Essentially, she started with the hardest climb and proceeded through Maine to New Hampshire and through the White Mountains, the most difficult part of the AT before proceeding to the easier parts. She said she’d also hiked the PCT (Pacific Crest Trail).
Zebra might be, what I call, a serial long distance hiker. I’ve met a number of hikers who hike as many long distance trails as they can, Serial long distance hikers seem to live life different than most people. Long distance hiking is a whole different lifestyle than life the real world. Day to day life requires only a handful of decisions: food supply, water sources and how many miles to hike. It also requires minimal contact with other people. Perhaps this is what draws some to spend so much time on long distance trails. 
2Hatz and I were considering stocking up on water at the stream next to the War Spur Shelter and carrying it to the campsite 4 miles up the mountain. Water is critical but also very heavy. When we got to the shelter, we met Buckeye who was sitting there eating his lunch. 
Buckeye is an older guy who was out hiking a section of the trail. He said he’d hiked the entire AT many years ago. He was hiking north so he’d come from the direction we were headed. Though the notes in Guthooks made us cautious about he upcoming sources, Buckeye said all the water sources seemed to be flowing due to rain we’d had on Tuesday and Wednesday. So we opted not to carry water up but to get it a spring 2 miles from our campsite. 
Buckeye was right. When we got to the spring, it was flowing good.
I filled 3 liter bottles at the spring. 2Hatz was done filling his bottles first so he put on his pack and proceeded up the mountain. I packed my bottles of water, an additional 6-8 lbs of weight and followed. 
The climb was steep and rocky. After a while I started sweating profusely, despite the cool breeze. I started feeling a little weak and tired, like I was running out of steam. I realized I was hungry and my blood sugar was probably low. Luckily, I had a snack bar in my pocket. I ate that and felt a little better. I stopped several times on the climb to rest. I realized that my lunch of about 300 calories wasn’t enough to sustain me through the afternoon and I would need to make some changes to my diet to increase calorie intake.
Our campsite was just a grassy area on top of a mountain, next to the trail. We were at nearly 4000 foot elevation so I expected it to get cold during the night. 
After eating at about 6pm, we both climbed into our tents for the night.

Bookworm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644581,"2Hatz and I reconsidered our hiking plans. If we hiked a longer distance today, it would put us closer to Pearisburg so we could get there early enough to get our chores done and still have some relaxation time. 
Looking at the climbs for the day, we decided we could make it to a shelter 8 miles from town, 21-1/2 miles from our campsite. Anything over 15 or 16 miles usually becomes a grind. I have to push myself hard to go that distance with the the hope of getting to the shelter before dark. After yesterday, I also realized I needed to energy boost from lunch to major that far. Luckily, I had an extra freeze dried meal in my food bag, 300 calories. 
I woke at 5:30am and had my usual breakfast of oatmeal, coffee and Belvida bars. We hiked out before 7. We completed the first 10 miles by 11am. We stopped for lunch at a shelter. I had a bagel with tuna but also pulled out my stove and cooked the freeze dried meal, too. 
The extra calories definitely helped. I had te energy to hike the remaining miles. With me in the lead, going over some rocky terrain and some climbs, we averaged about 2-1/2 miles north hour. 
While we were hiking through an area of thick rhododendron trees, which are like a dark tunnel, there was a sudden loud roar. I couldn’t see it but it sounded like a fighter jet. It was so sudden, so loud it seemed as if it was right on top of us. I’ve been to air shows but I’ve never heard one so close. It must’ve flown very close above the mountains we were on top of. Even several minutes later, I felt shaken by it. It was actually quite frightening. When it happened, 2Hatz, who served in Iraq, immediately hit the ground covering his head. As scary as it was for me, I can’t imagine  it must’ve felt for him. 
I assumed there was a water source near the shelter, like every other shelter I’d been to. But this one was unusual in that it was up on a hill, not in a valley near a stream. If we’d read the comments for the shelter I Guthooks we would have brought water from the source a mile prior. 2Hatz had a liter for tomorrow but I had nothing, not even a drop. 
Guthooks showed a spring .6 miles ahead. So I grabbed my water bag and headed to it. I had to get water to drink and make dinner and breakfast. Since it was downhill, I jogged to the spring and headed back. Thus I added 1.2 miles to my 21.5 mile day. They don’t count as hiking miles, however.

I took down my tent, packed up and went to the picnic table in front of the shelter. The sky was just starting to lighten. Before making my breakfast, I walked up to the top of the hill in front of the shelter. The sun was just coming up, Ray’s of orange and yellow spread out across the blue sky with a blanket of cotton white clouds hanging over the landscape below. The mountains poked above the clouds like islands. 
Most shelters and camp areas are in low valleys where the sunlight doesn’t peak through until an hour or more after sunrise. This was a rare opportunity to see the sun come up. And a rare opportunity to take a picture of a sunrise for my wife, who likes sunrise & sunset pictures. 
2Hatz got way ahead of me on the trail so I just took my time and listened to music on my phone. I didn’t see anyone else as I walked through the woods.

Woods Hole is one of the most iconic hostels on the AT. Neville, who operates the hostel and b&b, serves vegetarian meals with vegetables grown on the property. There’s cats and dogs to welcome visitors and goats, too. Neville offers meditation and yoga classes.The log cabin was built in the 1880s right next to the trail. Neville’s grandparents turned it into a hostel. Neville spent her youth there and took it over with her husband, remodeled and developed it into the hiker hostel and b&b it is today. 
I had Neville’s home baked bread warmed in the oven by HaHa, who helps with chores around the property. She served it with a block of Muenster cheese. 2Hatz and I relaxed in the bunk room lounge area. We met Polar Bear, who’s hiking from Springer mountain north to Harpers Ferry. He already hiked Harpers Ferry to Katadhin, going up 2 days after I did. 
Mongo also arrived today. He’s hiking from Springer to Harpers Ferry this year and completing his hike, going north from Harpers Ferry next spring.
Neville arrived late in the afternoon with 2 boxes for me and a car load of groceries. I helped her bring in the bags of groceries. Then I opened the boxes. 
One contained five days of food, which I had boxed up when I was home in August. The other had my cold weather gear that I might be needing sooner than I expected. I had Marie send me a fleece hat, wool gloves and lightweight thermals. She kindly added her own trail magic: 2 apples, chocolate, homemade chocolate chip cookies and homemade banana bread. I shared the cookies with the other hikers, 2Hatz, Mongo and Polar Bear. I gave Neville the banana bread to put out with our breakfast tomorrow morning. 
Later, Mongo and HaHa started a fire in the fire pit. A few of us sat around it and talked until dark.

Bookworm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644660,"There were only 4 of us staying at Woods Hole plus HaHa who worked there, Neville the owner and her friend from North Carolina, who was visiting. The 4 of us hikers and HaHa were hanging out on the front porch drinking coffee and talking, as the sun came up this morning. Neville came out and called to stand in a circle on the lawn and take turns telling everyone our trail name, where we were from and something we were grateful for. 
When it was my turn, I said I was Bookworm from Buffalo, New York. I was grateful for my wife, Marie, and all the support she’s given me while I’m on this journey. 
Afterwards, we went to an eating area in the back of he house where plates and food was spread out for us. Neville had made scrambled eggs with peppers and tomatoes, a big pan of garlic cheesy grits, fresh sliced tomatoes, homemade bread, butter and apple butter. And she had warmed snd sliced the loaf of banana bread Marie had sent in a box to me with my cool weather clothes. Nearly all the food was eaten, including the banana bread. 
Afterwards, I helped cleanup and wipe down tables before settling my bill. 2Hatz and I left our backpacks to be delivered to the next hostel before hiking out with Polar Bear. 
Polar Bear headed north on the AT, 2Hatz and I continued south, hiking 15 miles to another hostel. Angels Rest, Woods Hole and Weary Feet (a new hostel) are sometimes called the triple crown hostels because you can hike from one to another. Considering their low prices and proximity, it makes sense for 2Hatz and I because we’re pacing ourselves to meet Soundscape on October 2nd just after Bland. 
Weary Feet is an old home turned into a hostel. It’s not big or fancy but it’s clean and has bunk beds. Also, they serve dinner and breakfast. 
Soundscape stayed here yesterday and slack packed. He was dropped off at Route 52 in Bland and hiked back to this hostel. This morning his daughter picked him up so they can celebrate her 21st birthday in Nashville. She’ll drop him off on Route 52 where he’ll hike south to a shelter to meet us. 
Julie, the owner of Weary Feet made a delicious dinner of roast beef, mashed potatoes, gravy and beans. She gave us dinner rolls and fresh strawberries. For dessert, she baked an eclair cake. Dinner was awesome. 
Woods Hole and Weary Feet hostels are hosting a 3 day presentation for people interested in hiking the AT. Blueberry will be presenting about hammocks. Also in attendance is Bruce “RTK” Matson, coauthor of Platinum-Blazing the Appalachian Trail, a book about the best places to stop such as hostels, restaurants and views. 2Hatz, I and a few others enjoyed conversation with RTK after dinner.

We put food and 2 liters of water in small packs and hiked out. 
The trail surface was graded and nice but the climbs and downhills were steep and tiring. Still, it only took us 6 hours to make it to US route 52. Theres a small shop there, Brush mountain Trail Shop. They don’t have much but they did have ice cream. So I had a bowl of strawberry cheesecake ice cream while we waited for Julie from Weary Feet to deliver our  backpacks. 
Shortly after she dropped them off, my friend Chris arriving to pickup 2Hatz and I and take us to his and Donna’s home 30 minutes away in Wytheville, VA. 
Until just 2 months ago, Donna and Chris lived in western New York. We’d been friends for several years. Knowing I was going to be close by on the trail, they invited 2Hatz and I to visit. 
Donna made a delicious dinner of pulled pork sandwiches, baked beans, potato salad and a green salad. We ate, talked and enjoyed the view from the back deck of their nice Virginia country home. After dinner, Donna offered me Talentaia ice cream!Friday morning, Donna made a big breakfast of scrambled eggs, sausage, fruit, yogurt, muffins, toast, juice and apple. We were both well fed and rested when she took us back to the trail. We had a wonderful visit with Donna, Chris and their cute little dog, Gulliver. Awesome trail magic!

That may help but not necessarily. Sometimes springs continue to be low or dry even after rain. The dilemma is deciding how much water to carry. With cooler temperatures, I can go 6-8 miles with one liter. If I’m going to a shelter that has no water source, as is the case with both Jenkins and Knot Maul shelters, I also need water to make a dinner and a breakfast- total is about 3/4 liter. And more water to get to drink until the next source.
Water is very, very heavy. One liter weighs 2.2 lbs. I can feel the added weight on my shoulders, in my knees going downhill especially, in my hips. The more water I carry, the more I’m slowed down climbing mountains, the more I sweat and therefore the more I drink. The dilemma is carrying enough but not too much and paying the price with more aches and pains. 
From Jenkins Shelter, the next reliable source of water, according to comments from previous hikers, was Lick Creek 16 miles away. We had climb a 4000 foot and 3000 foot mountain to get there. Going up with 5 days food and 1-1/2 liters of water was slow and agonizing. Going down was just as difficult. A lot of the trail is gravel and steep so I have to be careful not to slip, made more challenging with the weight of my full pack, added water and gravity. 
We made it to Lick Creek with barely a lick of water in our bottles, filtered 2-2/2 liters and hiked 4 more miles up and over a mountain to Knot Maul Shelter. The forecast called for rain so we stayed in the shelter instead of putting up our tents. 
We only saw a few day hikers and weekend hikers on the trail all day. It feels like most of the hikers we know are a few days ahead of us. We did see hunters, however. I saw three deer hunters today. They were wearing camouflage and carrying bows. One was standing on the trail watching for deer. They’re quite aware of the trail being there and frequented by hikers. I have a red bandanna hanging from my pack but am hoping to find one that’s blaze orange soon.

The owners of the hostel were at church so we made ourselves at home until they arrived. Like most, this hostel has all the basics. It’s clean but not glamorous. There’s a separate building with a gravity fed hot shower and washing machines. Another small building is the privy, essentially an outhouse. Also, this is the first hostel I’ve ever been to that has a chapel for the hikers. They also have a large cross in front of the hostel. 
2Hatz and I decided to stay here to give Soundscape a chance to catch up with us. It is essentially a zero. Also here is Waterbug, Tolkien and Upbeat who we first met at Bears Den Hostel waiting out hurricane Ida. We couldn’t remember Upbeat’s trail name. He had short, curly black hair and a moustache that I thought made him resemble 70s actor Burt Reynolds. When we saw him again we would refer to him as “that 70s guy.” The three of them are SOBO hikers, having started on Katadhin in Maine in early June. We haven’t seen any sign of Soundscape. But much to our surprise, Jersey showed up and is staying here at Bear Garden Hostel. He’ll be hiking out with us tomorrow to the same location. The last time I saw Jersey was at the Super 8 motel in Daleville. Before that, I met him in Pennsylvania and later met him on Mount Greylock in Massachusetts. He has a YouTube channel: EB on the AT.

Waterbug, Tolkien and Upbeat (aka “that 70s guy”) stayed in the private cabin. 2Hatz and Jersey started rustling around 5am. Soon we were all up. Breakfast was a make it yourself cold cereal and toast with homemade blueberry jam and blackberry jam and coffee. I had several helpings of both. 
It wasn’t cold or raining but very misty when we hiked out. The trail wound through the woods. It crossed two cow pastures. There were ladders to climb over the barbed wire fences. 
Soon, 2Hatz was ahead of me somewhere. I put in my earphones and listened to the book I’ve been trying to finish. As I slowly climbed, Tolkien, Upbeat and Waterbug passed me. Then it started to rain. Then it poured. But I had my packa covering my pack. I pulled out the arms and hood. It kept the rain off me. 
After hiking 11 miles through woods and cow pastures and about a mile road walk that went under I-81, we made it the Alpaca farm and hostel. The bunk room is still under construction but comfort. There’s 6 completed bunks and 4 incomplete. Each is partially enclosed and has outlets and a light. Unlike the Bears Garden Hostel, the mattresses are soft and comfortable. 
Our next order of business was lining up a shuttle driver for tomorrow’s slack pack and finding a place to eat. So we called a local guy, Jimmy, who shuttles hikers. Jimmy showed up in his van, decorated with colorful pictures, the words “Love” and “Trasher” in big letters, a picture of Donald Trump on the window and thousands of hikers’ signatures. Jimmy wears a Vietnam Veteran hat and had a scratchy voice that sounds like Wolfman Jack. 
“Trasher” Jimmy told us there wasn’t any good restaurants in Atkins but he’d take us ten miles to a Mexican restaurant in Marion and a Walmart nearby for our resupply. And he’d pick us up in the morning to take us to our starting point for the 20 mile slack pack hike. And take us back on Wednesday morning. 
We all went to the restaurant and did our resupply shopping. Jimmy came in the Walmart in a motorized shopping cart for handicapped and elderly (he’s 72). We put our groceries in his cart and he took them out to load the van. 
When we returned to the hostel, Cindy the owner introduced us to a few of her alpacas. Just then, Soundscape arrived.

Our packs only contained basic necessities, food and water for the day. My pack probably weighed less than five pounds. Jimmy dropped us off at Route VA 670 trailhead at 8:05. The ride there was a little scary as he was driving fast on the curvy roads while smoking a cigarette and playing with his phone. We started our north bound hike back to the hostel. 
We all quickly spread out, hiking at our own pace. I’m significantly slower than 2Hatz and Soundscape but a little faster than Jersey. 2Hatz wanted to prove to Jimmy that we could hike the 20 miles faster than 10 hours so he took off. Shortly after starting, along came Butterfingers hiking south. We talked for a minute. Then we both hiked on. Moments later came two more hikers. Suddenly I recognized Trek Star and Gadabout. I never knew them well but had seen them a few times on the trail through New England.
Six miles into my hike I came to the Partnership shelter, one of the nicest shelters on the trail. It even has a shower. Unfortunately, due to Covid, the shelter water is off snd the shelter is off limits to use. I used the privy and sat there to eat a snack. Tolkien, hiking south. Jersey showed up, too. After eating, I continued on. 
A few minutes later, Upbeat came along. And after him, Waterbug, too. Waterbug stopped and said she’d seen 2Hatz running down the trail. I replied that trail ahead must be nice. She sai, “No! It’s not good for running.” 
Waterbug had fallen on a rocky section of trail last week, near Woods Hole Hostel. She sliced open her knee and had to go to a hospital for sutures.
Near the end of my hike, I came upon the Settlers museum, an 18th century farmstead. It was only a short distance off the trail so I went down to it and walked around. 
I finished hiking about 3:30, coming off the trail near a gas station. I boos feel items to supplement tomorrow’s breakfast and headed to the Mexican restaurant nearby. 2Hatz finished safely almost an hour before me. He met me at the restaurant. Jersey and Soundscape showed up at the hostel an hour after me. They went to the restaurant for dinner. 
I showered and called home. Then I packed up to be ready to go back to the trail. Then I relaxed and ate a pint of Blue Bell cookies and cream ice cream.

Bookworm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644890,"It’s helpful to have hiking plans for the day and days ahead but also to know they may not work out. Or, as General Eisenhower once said, “In preparing for battle I have always found that plans are useless, but planning is indispensable.” 
We started today with a plan and ended it with all new plans. Soundscape was hiking to a road crossing, two miles short of where the rest of us were hiking, where Jimmy the shuttle driver would pick him up. He had to get off trail again for a zoom call job interview. He would take a zero in Marion, VA and catch up with us on Friday.Soundscape and 2Hatz were far ahead. Jersey was ahead of me as the trail went through the woods. We came to a gate to a cow pasture. We hiked across the pasture, cows nearby watching us. A large black bull started following Jersey. Then a nearby brown cow followed the bull and a calf, seeing the others, fell in line behind the cow. Looking like a bovine pied piper, Jersey led the three cows across the pasture to another gate. I came along, far behind and, careful to not get to close behind the bull, went through the gate. The three cows watched me with indifference.
The forecast called for light rain in the morning, ending in the early afternoon. As Jimmy drove us to the trailhead this morning, I noticed the rain had stopped and the sky looked like it might break up giving me hope the rain wouldn’t be an issue during our hike. I was wrong. 
As Soundscape, 2Hats, Jersey and I began hiking the rain started again. After a few minutes, it began to rain harder. Then it began to pour. And it kept pouring. In fact, it poured rain for the next six hours without letting up.
We had agreed to stop at the aptly named Hurricane Shelter, about 11 miles into our hike, for a lunch break. I arrived to find Soundscape eating a lunch snack snd 2Hatz getting dressed in dry clothes. Jersey arrived a moment later. 
I had worn a Packa, pack cover and rain jacket. But when it rains so hard for so long, no rain gear will keep you dry. All the clothes I wore, including my socks and underwear, were thoroughly soaking wet. I looked at Soundscape and said I wished I was going with him. Soon we all agreed it was suitable to reevaluate our plans. We hiked with Soundscape to his pickup location.There was Trasher Jimmy waiting. 
The forecast called for three more days of rain. We were a day away from another famous AT location, Grayson Highlands. If we stayed with the original plan we’d be hiking through the highlands in a rain storm tomorrow and the views would be obscured- just like when we were at Tinker Cliffs and McAfee Knob. We needed to hike three more days south to reach Damascus, VA.
Jimmy suggested an alternative plan: take a zero Thursday with Soundscape in Marion. Then, on Friday morning he would take us to Damascus, VA where we could hike northbound for three days. We’d hike in the rain Friday and Saturday. When we reached Grayson Highlands on Sunday, the rain would be gone, according to the forecast. It was worth a try. It’s also nice to be off trail with a chance to dry out.

Our new team member was there waiting for us. LT had driven about 11 hours from Connecticut the day before and stayed the night at Crazy Larry’s. 
I had met LT in New Jersey at the Mohican Outdoor Center the day I left Delaware Water Gap, where Pootz had to get off the trail. LT was section hiking. We hiked together and soon met Easy (who I hiked with all the way to New Hampshire) and CB. LT got off in New York. She returned to the trail when we reached Great Barrington, MA and hiked with us again for about a week. Now she was back to hike southern Virginia. She’s a good friend and hiking partner so I was thrilled to have the chance to hike with her again. 
LT, 2Hatz, Jersey, Soundscape and I hiked north out of Damascus. LT let us know her experience at the hostel was not good. It was small and cramped. The owner, Crazy Larry, smoked pot inside the hostel and it was noisy with him coughing through the night. We all had reservations to stay there Sunday night but were now reconsidering. 
We met a couple hiking south who told us they were staying at a different hostel, Lady Di’s. They said it was nice, reasonably priced and, the best part, they served breakfast. Jersey texted Lady Di and soon we had our reservations for their. 
We also learned from the hikers, as well as others we’d met, that there was a bee’s nest right in the middle of the trail not far ahead. 
When we came to the nest, LT led Jersey, Soundscape and I bushwacking through the woods around it. We made it safely by and continued on our hike. 2Hatz, well ahead, apparently jumped over it. 
Much of the trail today went alongside a stream. There were lots of tall green rhododendron. The trees, however, were quickly changing colors for the fall. Some were yellow, others were red and some leaves were almost pink in color. The leaves were falling, covering the trail in wet leaves over the rocks at roots making it more challenging to hike. I enjoyed the colors but had to watch my steps carefully so as not to slip and fall.

The early morning sun sending its rays through the golds, pinks and bright green leaves was spectacular. The ground was covered with golden aspen leaves. At times, the trail went through dark rhododendron tunnels to emerge again into the sun washed woods. 
Like yesterday, the trail again went through a cow pasture. Several black cows stood nearby and watched us walk by. As she is apt to do to any creatures on the trail , LT talked sweetly to them and wished the cows a good day. 
Although the elevation grade was not too challenging, the trail was more rocky than it has been recently. That made the going a little slow. 
We stopped at Elk Grove Meadow parking lot and had a short break to eat. The lot was full of cars, many from North Carolina. We expected a lot of people, off for the Columbus Day holiday weekend, would be camping in the area we we’re going to.  As it would happen, this would be the most people I’d ever seen at an AT shelter campsite.

With my headlamp on, I went down the trail to the privy. Coming back, I looked up and saw more stars than I’d ever seen before. We were camping above 5000 feet, above the clouds.To the East and north the view of the sky was wide open. It was cloudless and full of stars. I stood and looked for several minutes before heading back to my tent to change my clothes, take down my tent and pack up. 
As the sun came up, we sat at the picnic table by the shelter and made our breakfasts. After eating, we hiked out in the direction of Grayson Highlands to see the ponies. 
The landscape was very different than what we had been hiking through. There were fewer trees obstructing the view so I could see mountains in the distance and the fall colors beginning to emerge. The trail was rockier than it’s been. The trail even went between boulders, almost like the lemon squeezer. 
We hiked over a rocky ridge into an open grassy balds where the feral ponies graze. They were first introduced in the 1970s to maintain the grass. Today there are several small herds roaming the area. They’re accustomed to hikers passing through, sometimes feeding the animals so they are not afraid and will come up to people. 
We spent some time petting the ponies and taking pictures before hiking on.  The trail went through woods and later emerged into “The Scales,” a ranch with horses and longhorn steers. 2Hatz, Jersey and Soundscape were ahead while Lieutenant and I hiked together. We heard someone call us and saw hikers we’d met in the trail several times, Lady Di and her husband who we referred to as “the guy from Vermont.” They were getting trail magic from a former thru hiker, Mile to Go. We stopped and talked a moment but had to keep moving to catch a shuttle. 
We made it to the parking area where Jimmy was waiting to take us to the hostel in Damascus. After checking into the hostel and taking showers, we headed to the 7 Trails Grill for dinner. The service was slow due to a work shortage, but eventually a guy came and took our order. He was very funny, doing the best he could under difficult circumstances. Meanwhile, Jersey was getting frustrated, his attention absorbed watching his football team, the New York Giants losing badly on the tv. In the corner of the bar was a loud but very talented musician playing guitar and singing a wide range of songs. We had a great time listening to the music, eating great food and drinking a few beers. In the midst of the fun and noise, I received a phone call from Roots. Roots had hiked with Lieutenant, Easy and I from Great Barrington, MA to Hanover, NH. He saw that Lieutenant was hiking with me shy and called to say hello to us. It was great to hear from him.

Crossing the Virginia/Tennessee border means I have hiked through 11 states: West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine and Virginia. At 544 miles, more of the trail goes through Virginia than any other state. 
Our shuttle driver, with her little dog,  arrived promptly  on time this mornings. Angie was a nice woman with a difficult past. She told us how her snd her husband became addicted to meth and struggled to get their lives together. Their one son abandoned them but the other son helped them get the treatment they needed to stay sober. She seemed like someone with a big heart and the will to get her life back on track. But it was very sad to hear the depths of suffering she endured. 
2Hatz hiked well ahead of everyone. Lieutenant and I hiked together all day, talking much of the time on a wide range of topics. It was fun to talk with her snd it made the miles of trail go by faster. As we hiked, we would occasionally run into Soundscape and Jersey taking breaks. We took our break with them. Alongside the trail there plants with small purple flowers, Gentians. The flowers were tubular and closed but looked like they should open at some time. Suddenly, Lieutenant stopped. She had spotted one of the flowers with a bee in it. The bee’s rear end was sticking up out of the closed bud, as if it was trapped. We stood and watched it for a moment. It was amazing to see nature in action. So beautiful. It wriggled its way out and flew to the next flower. 
By 3pm, we had hiked into Damascus. We stopped at the outfitter where I bought a new water filter and a few souvenirs for Marie. (Lieutenant will mail them to her for me). 
Then Soundscape, Lieutenant and I did what is always required after a great day of hiking- we went to the ice cream shop. We each had a double scoop ice cream in a cone. Mine was the best pumpkin pie ice cream I’d ever had. It was delicious. 
We returned to the hostel. After washing up, all sat on the comfortable front porch watching the cars and people go by while talking with Lady Di, the hostel owner. She thru hiked in 2019. Afterwards she bought a home in Damascus, moved from Minnesota and turned the home into a B&B. The home is tastefully decorated inside, including lots of posters of and a bookshelf full of books about Bob Dylan. Dylan (I’m also a fan), is originally from Minnesota. 
Soon, Lieutenant packed up her belongings and said her goodbyes to each of her new hiking friends. It was time for her to begin the long drive home to her husband and girls back in Connecticut.
We all had a wonderful time hiking in the beautiful weather, seeing the autumn colors, visiting the ponies of Grayson Highlands and enjoying Lieutenant’s company. Of course, I was sad to say farewell and see my good friend and hiking partner depart but, I know we’ll hike together again.

We went back to the hostel where Lady Di had another awesome breakfast ready for us. She made quiche with bacon, orange juice and homemade sourdough bread. Not only do I like making scones, I also made sourdough bread from scratch at home. Lady Di and I talked about different ways to make the starter and breads.

Wolf was smoking a pipe, something I hadn’t seen in decades except in old movies. I stopped and checked out the monument to Nick Grindstaff, a lone headstone in the woods, next to the trail. It said, he “lived alone, suffered alone and died alone” in 1923. To make the hike go easier, I listened to a new audible book for awhile, “The Art of Solitude” by Stephen Batchelor, an author who books I’ve read before. It seemed appropriate for the occasion. Later, I listened to a new release by Neil Young, one of my favorite musicians, “Concert at Carnegie Hall, 1971”. Then some random music on my phone. Suddenly, in the middle of an Allman Brothers song, I was at the shelter campsite. First, I went to get water. Unfortunately, the water source was a long 1/3 mile down a very steep side trail. It took me awhile and the climb back up was difficult. Next, I setup my tent. Then I sat in the shelter with the Otho and made my dip. I had a freeze dried meal, noodles with spicy sausage. It was tasty and about 600 calories. I had a piece of dark chocolate for a dessert, as I always do. Then I had one of the scones. I hung my bear bag, brushed my teeth and climbed into my tent for the evening. Besides not having a picnic table, there’s also no Bear box or privy. I’ve heard there are no privies in Tennessee. Unfortunately, everyone has to find a good, private location to dig a cat hole. I don’t like it but have no choice and will have find a spot first thing in the morning.

Bookworm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645111,"We were planning to hike 16 miles today to the Laurel Fork shelter. Jersey read comments from previous hikers that there were rats at the shelter and they weren’t afraid of humans. So we decided to hike an additional 2 miles to Black Bear Resort that had a bunk room for hikers. 
The trail went up a mountain but the trail was nicely graded and there were switchbacks. So, not much to complain about except it was a long climb. 
It brought us to one end of Watauga Dam lake. The dam was built in the 1940 by the TVA (Tennessee Valley Authority) to bring electricity and flood control. The TVA was established as part of FDR’s New Deal in the 1930’s to bring electricity and improve the economy of this poor rural part of Appalachia. 
The trail went around the lake with stunning views of the lake and surrounding mountains. The mountains in Tennessee look bigger and more rugged than in Virginia. The trees are turning colors but seem to be behind the trees north of Damascus. 
Soundscape and I came upon Jersey sitting on a log, starting to make his lunch. I pointed out that there was a recreation area a quarter mile ahead. Then we got a text from 2Hatz telling, who was ahead of us on the trail, that there was trail magic. 
A short hike later, we came upon a woman sitting next to her car, hatchback open. The rear of the car was full of hiker foods: chips, honey buns, cookies and other assorted goodies. She offered us drinks. I had an Orange Crush and Gatorade. 
Marlene Simpson hikes the trail, but, she said, is not a thru hiker. She also gave each of us a paper with some of her poetry that she’s had published. She said she has a Facebook page, too. 
It’s amazing how some people go out of their way to be kind and generous. Trail magic is not a given. People like Marlene buy what they believe hikers will like or want and provide it out of the goodness of their heart. In Marlene’s case, she sat behind her car waiting to see if any thru hikers came by (day hikers don’t need anything). Some days there’s a few, other days there’s none. 
After eating our fill of goodies, talking with Marlene for awhile from the comfort of the chairs she provided, we hiked on. 
The hike down to Laurel Falls was beautiful. There were Rhododendron everywhere. Some trees were changing color. The river water rushed over rocks, several foot bridges crossed it. Then I had to climb out of the gorge. There were rock steps going up what seemed like forever. With the weight of my pack, I slowly walked up the steps, sweating profusely. 
After walking through a rhododendron forest on a wide, flat trail I came to a road. I walked another half mile to the Black Bear Resort. 2Hatz was already checked in for a bunk and shower. My feet hurt and I was hungry. We each bought frozen pizzas to share with the other guys. 
Then I saw a freezer with a sign on it saying ice cream. Linda, the owner, said the freezer had briefly lost electricity so she wasn’t going to charge me. She had Talenti gelato. I had Southern Pecan gelato, it had a little frost on top but tasted delicious.

Bookworm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645173,"This morning we had a half mile road walk past several homes before reaching the trailhead back into the woods. Shortly after getting back on the trail, we came upon an old log barn. There was nothing to indicate the age of the barn but it looked like it was over a hundred years old. 
I started out with only one liter of water this morning. Since leaving Damascus, water sources have not been an issue. Today, the first stream was after 4 miles of hiking. There was a spring or stream every few miles, sooner, after that. 
The trail continued up White Rocks Mountain to just under 4000 feet. It was a long climb. Since it was a graded trail with switchbacks it wasn’t too difficult. The rest of the hike consisted of lots of short ups and downs. The hiking today was nice. My only complaint is there were a lot of leaves on the trail. They covered the occasional rocks and roots so I had to go a little slower and be careful. Several times I stubbed my toes on a rock or a raised root. 
My shoes are holding up, however. I now have 622 miles on them, twice as many as the shoes I was buying before. They are Inovo-8 shoes, made from graphene rubber; a new and much more durable rubber. They may get me to Springer. Mountain. Of course, the trail is also much more forgiving than it was in Pennsylvania and New England. 
As I was hiking alone most of the day, I was enjoying the views of mountains, the changing colors of the trees, the forests of rhododendron trees, the beautiful streams I crossed and the nice grade of the trail. Now, I have little more than 400 miles to go before this adventure ends. 
During some of my hike, I listened to another audible book. I had finished “The Art of Solitude .” Most of it was good but not what I hoped for. Next I listened to a book, “The Wisdom Jesus:,” by Cynthia Bourgeaut. It also seemed to suit the environment I was  hiking in. It was much better than I expected. I highly recommend it. 
I recalled something my friend Lieutenant said several times when she was hiking with us. With amazement and a hint of jealousy, she said, “You get to do this every day!”  As the final weeks pass by, I can’t take any of this adventure for granted. I’ve been able to experience and see so much that most people can never experience. I need to savor every single mile remaining.

Bookworm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645246,"Mountain Harbor Hostel has been voted to have the best breakfast of any hostel on the trail for many years. This morning they did not disappoint. There was pumpkin bread, pastries, several egg dishes, pancakes, biscuits, gravy, jams, juice and coffee. It was an amazing spread. Possibly the best breakfast ever. 
Since it was raining after breakfast, we waited until it stopped before heading out. We had an eleven mile hike, the first part a long climb up Hump Mountain to 5560 feet. We expected it to take about 5-6 hours. We started hiking about 9am. 
The climb wasn’t too bad. The trail was nicely graded and the switchbacks moderated the climbing. About 10am it started raining again. I had my packa cover on already and only needed to pull out my sleeves and hood.  It wasn’t too cold so I unzipped the packa armpits and put my arms through to wear it as a poncho. 
The trail went higher and higher until it went above tree line. This was my first time hiking across a bald. Balds are mountains in the south that are grass covered on top but don’t have trees. They are wide open so in good weather they offer terrific views. That wasn’t the case today. 
The top of Hump mountain was socked in with clouds. The wind picked up to about 35-40 mph and the rain picked up to. Going across the bald for several miles, it was raining sideways and the gusts were powerful enough to make walking difficult. The path got very wet, muddy and slippery. Jersey fell a couple of times. Occasionally the trail went back into trees or behind a ridge giving us protection from the wind. I felt a little cold, my shoes, socks and feet got wet. As long as I kept hiking, I stayed warm enough. 
2Hatz hiked fast and far ahead of us. He doesn’t have some of the cold weather clothes we have. As the temperature dropped, he was concerned about getting hypothermia. 
We came upon a sign indicating we had crossed the border into North Carolina. Another state line crossed. Here’s the list of states I’ve hiked: West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, Virginia, Tennessee, and now, North Carolina. That’s 13 states. The AT goes through 14 states. 
Also, at the state line is the point at which I hiked 1800 miles for Lewy Body Dementia. 
Gradually, the sun began to peak through the cloud cover. Each time it did, my hopes renewed and I felt warm again. Eventually the clouds went away and the suns rays washed over the mountains. The worst had passed.
When we arrived at the shelter, I setup my tent with the feet towards the direction the wind was coming from and lowered the profile. I wanted to make it as conducive to warmth as possible. It was going to be a cold and windy night. Since we were above 5000 feet, it could get into the 30s. 
I changed into my long sleeved shirt and put on my puffy jacket and fleece hat. I also put on my wool gloves. I filtered water and made my dinner, even though it was only 4pm, so I could get some warm food in me. While I made dinner, I talked with the two young guys staying in the shelter. They were environmental studies students at Tennessee State University. 
After a while I realized I’d made a mistake in not changing my socks. Now that I was sitting, my feet started getting cold in the wet socks. Soon, my toes felt very cold, like ice. After eating and hanging my food, I climbed in my tent to change into my thermals and dry socks. I had intended on going back out to socialize since it was only 5pm. But even after changing, my toes felt like frigid. I rubbed my toes for several minutes until they warmed up and climbed into my liner and quilt. Besides my thermals, I also wore my puffy jacket, fleece hat and wool gloves for the night. I put my wet socks under the quilt with me to hopefully dry out or at least warm them for putting on tomorrow. 
2Hatz had warmed himself up in his sleeping bag. The other guys seem to be warmed up also. Now, we all just hunker in our shelters for the long, cold night ahead.

Bookworm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645249,"I woke at 6am. It was still dark and I was not ready to get out of tent. With the little cell service I had, the weather app said it was 36 but felt like 33. We were at over 5000 foot elevation so it may have been colder. My water wasn’t frozen, however. 
Once it was light out we all began to move. We agreed to stay together since it was dangerously cold. None of us were quite prepared for these temperatures. It diotake long for my toes, in damp socks and shoes, to get cold. We were all stomping our feet trying to Lee the blood circulating. 
Finally ready, we hiked out about 9am. The trail went up to Jane Bald at 5800 feet. The trees leading up were covered with frost. Luckily, though it was still bitter cold, the sky was clear and allowed for dramatic views of the mountains. 
The trail then went down to Carvers Gsp. We saw dozens of people coming up for the views from the parking lot in Carvers Gap and several dozen cars parked there. Some people that went by, with dogs, children and even babies, clearly were not prepared for the cold bitter wind blowing across Jane Bald. 
We then hiked up Roan Mountain. There’s a very old log cabin style shelter near the summit, at 6186 feet- the highest shelter on the AT. The area leading up to the shelter was all spruce pine, reminding me of some the mountains in Maine. 
Thankfully, the trail then went down. I could feel the temperature go up a little as we descended. It was still cold but not as bitter. 
The shelter we’re camping near for the night, Clyde Smith Shelter, is at elevation 4486. The forecast is for another cold night in the low 40s but the winds are not as strong and there’s more trees for protection.

As the day progressed, the trail wasn’t too difficult and the climbs were manageable. So we pressed on, eventually settling up at a stealth site near Indian Gap Road. We hiked a total of 18 miles putting us only 8 mil from Erwin, Tennessee for tomorrow. During our hike today, we met Wolf on the trail. We had seen him 100 miles north a week ago. He’s 82 years old and goes out for day hikes. We need to go into town for food resupply. I also want to get wool socks for cold weather sleeping. I realized today, feeling every rock through my soles and that my heels hurt sometimes, indicating possible tendinitis. Although they still look ok, I believe my shoes cushioning is shot. If I don’t replace them soon, I could injure myself. Serious tendinitis could take me off the trail. With only 352 miles to go, I don’t need that risk. I’ll look in town tomorrow for new shoes.

The elevation at the intersection of River road and Unaka Spring road is 1707. For the next 17 miles we mostly hiked uphill. There was some downhill but then I’d be climbing again even more. Several parts were steep without switchbacks. It was a long, slow hike to our destination, Bald Mountain Shelter at 5064 foot elevation. 
The sun was out all day and did get a little warmer as the day progressed. It was probably in the low 40d this morning and low 60s by  afternoon. It was the the first time in a few days that I could hike in shorts and a t-shirt. All the climbing heats the body up quite a bit so it was necessary for me to peel off the layers to Lee from getting sweaty.

Bookworm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645347,"Hiking up to Bald mountain, I noticed someone without a pack on the trail ahead. Then I saw another person walking across the field. There was, what looked like, a hunting blind. On some of the trees and posts there were pictures of birds pinned. 2Hatz and I came upon a woman who explained they were scientists studying migratory birds. 
The views from the bald were good but the sky was cloudy. Soon it started to sprinkle. I hiked a few miles before I decided to put my pack cover on, in case the rain increased. But, as is usually the case when I go the trouble of putting the pack cover on, the rain stopped. 
I saw several day hikers on the trail. I came upon two women headed towards me who appeared to be out for a day hike. They stopped and asked me if I was a thru hiker. When I said I was, they offered me a Kind bar. I accepted and enjoyed it. I never turn down food offers. And if someone wants to be nice and do trail magic, I don’t think I should turn that down either. 
Today was nearly the opposite of yesterday. Instead of climbing upwards all day, much of today was downward. I hiked a total of 18.9 miles. Of that, I climbed 3931 feet, and descended 5466 feet. Yesterday, I climbed 6121 feet and descended 2727 feet over 17 miles (according to Guthooks). 
I arrived at tonight’s shelter about 5:30, not long before it became dark. This was the first time I had to eat dinner with a headlamp. With the miles we need to cover, it will be dark when we start and dark when we finish until daylight savings time begins.

I got dressed, packed up, had breakfast. We were on the trail by 7:30, just as daylight broke. Today was a typical day of climbing up a mountain, though the trail was steeper than usual. Hike up, hike down, hike up again. 
Around noon, Soundscape caught up to me on the trail. I noted that it was almost time for lunch and that Jersey was ahead. Unlike 2Hatz, Jerzey never skips lunch. The food energy is needed to finish the long hike. I don’t know how 2Hatz keeps going on just oatmeal. 
I mentioned that Jerzey is probably about to stop for lunch, I’d probably do the same. Soundscape passed me and hiked ahead.
A few minutes later, I came around a bend I the trail and saw Soundscape standing, his pack off and on the ground.  Jerzey was sitting in front of him on the trail, his pack and belongings scattered about.
He’d caught his toe on a leaf covered root snd fell head first into a tree. It’s the sort of stumble that can happen a hundred times a day. The head butt had dazed him but, other than the red mark on his head, he was ok. 
The trail wound through the woods, up and over hills finally coming to a deep descent to the French Broad River. The trail going down to the river was very steep and rocky, going down many rock steps. At the bottom, the trail follows the river for a ways up to a bridge over the river and down Hot Springs’ Main Street. 
In most towns someone walking through town wearing a backpack might draw attention. Hot Springs and it’s businesses, however, thrives on the hikers that pass through town all through the hiking season. It has been a hiker friendly town since the trail was initially completed in 1937.
We decided to stay at a hostel recommended by RTK (author of “Platinum-Blazing the Appalachian Trail,” who we met a few weeks ago). The trail passes by the front steps of Elmer’s Sunnybank Inn. It’s within easy walking distance of downtown and all the stores and restaurants. 
With a forecast for rain on Monday and all of us needing some time to regroup and rest before we head into the Smokies, we decided a zero in Hot Springs was in order.

The shuttle driver, Jason, drove us in his van down a winding road through the mountains past nice, expensive houses next to old falling down houses and tobacco barns. Most of the nice houses had pontoon boats parked in the front yards. People use them in nearby Douglas Lake, Jason told us. The van radio played a mix of bluegrass and gospel music. Eventually the paved road became a winding gravel road. There was no mistaking we were in Appalachia. With nothing in our packs except water and snacks for the day, we began hiking north back to Hot Springs. 
We hiked to the top of Max Patch mountain, formerly known as Mack’s Patch. Originally cleared of trees for grazing, the elevation of 4629 feet offers stunning 360 degree views of the Blue Ridge Mountains. There were a number of people who’d camped below tree line and were up on the bald to watch the sun rise. They probably saw the sunset last night, too. With clear skies, the view from Max Patch is one of the most amazing views I’ve seen on the AT. 
We hiked on through the day. I completed my hike of 20 miles after 8-1/2 hours, returning to Elmer’s Sunnybank Inn and Hostel in downtown Hot Springs about 5pm. 
Hot Springs, originally named Warm Springs due to the 108 degree spring waters nearby that made this a resort town since the early 1800s. During WWI, the town served as an internment camp for 2700 German Naval. Officers. Prior to WWI, the Gentry family took over the Sunnybank boardinghouse, and it remained in the Gentry family for over 50 years. Sunnybank became associated with the Dorland-Bell Institute, a Presbyterian school for Appalachian girls. Msny teachers boarded at Sunnybank.
Jane Gentry was a musician and folklorist who taught music and shared mountain foods, song and tales with the students, boarders, and others.  Cecil Sharpe, English folklorist and noted authority on ancient ballads, was touring the mountain areas collecting tunes for hs volume, English Folk Songs of the Southern Appalachians, when he visited Sunnybank to add to the collection. Today, Sunnybank is on the National Register of Historic Places. 
Earl Schafer, the first person known to have completed a thru hike of the AT in 1947, stayed at Sunnybank. Elmer Hall has run this establishment since 1978, just two years after completing his own thru hike of the Appalachian Trail.

It was raining but not windy. I put on my headlamp (standard gear for hikers) and got dressed. Soundscape and I went across the street to the Hillbilly Market but the power was out there too so it was closed. No coffee or breakfast food for us.
I received a message from legendary trail Angel, Fresh Ground, saying he’d meet us at Brown Gap to provide breakfast. Snapdragon, who I’d hiked with in West Virginia to Pennsylvania and later in New Hampshire, put me in touch with Fresh Ground. He was looking for thru hikers to provide magic for. I’d met him once in Pennsylvania where he was cooking breakfast for hikers. Now he was in Tennessee. 
Seven of us were shuttled to the Max Patch trailhead. We hiked a few miles, arriving around 9am at Brown Gap in the rain to see Fresh Ground’s van. He had tables and chairs setup under a tarp. He made everyone breakfast to order: blueberry pancakes with real maple syrup, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage and ham. He also had hot coffee, juice and an assortment of fruits. He kept giving me pancakes and I kept eating them. Finally, after close to an hour, I hiked out. 
Just a mile before the shelter we were staying in we came upon Fresh Ground again. He parked in Davenport Gap, where the Smokies begin. This time, he made us tacos with rice and beans. Again, we enjoyed a full meal. 
Full from eating, we hiked up to the shelter where we stayed for the night. I usually don’t stay in shelters, preferring my tent. But there were no good spots for tents. The shelter was unusual in that it has a fence with a gate to keep bears out. It doesn’t have a privy, any bear cables or boxes so we hung our food in the shelter behind the fence. 
It got cold, probably in the low 40s. But I was warm enough in my quilt and sleeping bag liner. But colder weather is coming to the Smokies. Fresh Ground provides trail magic up and down the AT and is supported by donations. He posts photos of hikers he provides magic to.

I started at 2592 feet above sea level at Davenport Gap shelter and climbed all day to elevation 5338. There were plenty of switchbacks and the grade was moderate. But it was still a long, slow upward climb. Today was beautiful but cool. The sun was out and temperatures were in the high 40s, suitable for hiking uphill.
The weather forecast, however, doesn’t look good. Rain is moving on Thursday and then turning colder with snow. It will be especially cold and snowy at the high elevations in the Smokies. Temperatures could get into the twenties.  None of us are equipped to deal with weather that cold. We’ve decided to get off trail for our safety tomorrow.

We were separated but in touch, as service came and went. Just as I got close to Peck’s shelter, I saw 2Hatz. I received a text from Soundscape that he heard the main road through the park was closed due to high winds and trees down across the road. We needed to stop or get stuck where there was no shelter. 
Just then we met a local hiker. He showed us maps and told us about a series of side trail that would take us down near the other side of the park. From there, we’d either get a ride into Cherokee or to Gatlinburg (a long 1-1/2 hour drive due to the road closure). We had two options: stay in a shelter for two days in possibly extreme cold or hike out on the side trails. We opted to escape. I took pictures of the paper maps. 
Jerzey’s niece, hearing of our predicament, volunteered to drive from her home in Bristol, Tennessee and rescue us. She had to drive almost 3 hours. We had to hike 11 miles to the pick up point. 
It proved to be a very tiring hike down out of the Smokies. It was windy and cold but as we went further down, it got warmer. It sprinkled off and on but never rained very much. 
We arrived at Smokemont campground and waited. There was no cell service so all we could do is wait. We cooked something to eat, talked and waited. Around 6pm, Jerzey’s niece showed up and whisked us off to Gatlinburg. Exhausted from the day’s hiking, we checked into our motel rooms.

I’ve hiked over two thousand miles for LBDA! From the end of today’s hike at Derrick Knob shelter, 2003.3 miles done and 189.8 miles left to complete the Appalachian Trail. This morning’s hike up from Newfound Gap was not much fun. The trail was essentially a cold river of water with occasional sections of sloppy, slippery mud. I hiked to the summit of Clingmans Dome, the highest peak on the Appalachian Trail at 6658 feet above sea level. The Smokies were still locked in a cloud so there was no view to be had. One hiker told me it was like being inside a ping pong ball, just a white cloud all around. Reminded me of McAfee Knob.

I should be warm enough. I’ll keep my phone and water filter in the liner with me to keep the cold from damaging them. The hard part will be dressing in damp, muddy clothes tomorrow morning.

Bookworm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645611,"At 4884 feet, the shelter camp area was essentially in a cloud when I woke up. Both the outside and inside of my tent had moisture. I get mostly concerned about my down quilt getting wet. Down loses its insulation properties when wet and it takes a long time to dry. Given the nigh time temperatures have been in the 30s, that would be a problem. 
My quilt was damp but seemed ok. I pack my quilt, liner and pad in a heavy duty plastic bag inside my pack to make sure no water gets to them. I put my wet tent in on top of the bag. 
I packed up. I made my breakfast in the shelter. Cactus, Hop-Skip, Rippin were there also. They had also gotten off trail when the cold weather and snow came through. I had met Cactus in Daleville but Soundscape knew her from hiking north. After breakfast, I hiked out. 
About five miles into my hike, I went over Rocky Top mountain. It was rocky on top and offered great views of the surrounding mountains. The 1960s country song of the same name, written in a Gatlinburg hotel room according to a sign in town, refers to the mountain. 
When I stopped for lunch at a shelter on the trail, I pulled my tent out to dry it in the sun. 2Hatz and Soundscape came along shortly after and did the same thing. By the time I was done eating lunch, my tent was dry and good for tonight.

It stopped so I made my breakfast outside by headlamp. Then it started to rain again so I ate in my tent. Then it stopped so I figured it was done. But shortly after I started hiking it rained again. So I put my packa on. 
After a few miles I came to the short side trail to a fire tower that Jersey had mentioned. I went up to the tower an climbed the rickety metal steps to the top. I was behind the others but expected to find them at the tower but they’d all passed it. I found at the top one of the most spectacular views of the Smokies I’d seen the entire time we were in them. 
I hiked on snd eventually caught up the others. We crossed the Fontana Dam and were now out of the Great Smokies Park. I hope to visit again when it’s not so cold and I have a tent more suitable for the moisture. 
On the far side of the dam we met Fresh Ground. He made us banana pancakes, bacon scrambled eggs and coffee. And he had a pot of homemade chicken soup for us. It was all delicious and gave us the energy to complete our hike. I had a box of resupply food at the Fontana Lodge. I called them and had them deliver it to me a few miles away where the trail passes a marina. Although I needed 2 days food, I now have 5 days of food- a heavy pack to hike with tomorrow. 
At Yellow Creek road, Cynthia, the owner of Creekside Paradise Hostel picked us up and took us back to the hostel. She took us into town where the others bought food for resupply. Cynthia, unknown to Soundscape, picked up a big birthday cake at the store that his wife had ordered. 
After we ate dinner, Cynthia brought in the cake snd we all sang to Soundscape. He was genuinely surprised. It was a nice way to end the evening.

I hiked 7 miles to Stecoah Gap parking area to find Fresh Ground there. He had hot soup, coffee and snacks for us. Soundscape and 2Hatz were already there. 
Fresh Ground checked the weather. It showed the temperatures staying in the mid 40s and rain moving in early evening and continuing through the night into tomorrow morning. We reconsidered our plan to stay at a tent site after hiking over Cheoah Bald at over 5000 feet and then setting up and taking down in a cold rain. 
Instead, we could hike another 3 miles to the Nanatola Outdoor Center and tent an inexpensive cabin. However that would mean hiking a total of 21 miles with the 5000 foot climb. Fresh Ground said he was heading to NOC and could take our extra gear there for us. We could hike the 21 miles with only what we needed. For me, that meant a ten pound backpack instead of thirty pounds. 2Hatz and I both lit up at the suggestion. Fresh Ground doesn’t slack pack hikers. That’s something others do for a fee. He was just dropping off our gear since he was going there anyway. He goes out of his way for hikers everyday. Fresh Ground is the ultimate trail Angel. 
The additional 14 mile hike was long and tiring. It took me about 5-1/2 hours to reach the NOC. My legs were tired. When I got there I heard 2Hatz and Fresh Ground calling me. We went in the restaurant where I ordered a beer. Fresh Ground ordered two pizzas. We all dived into the pizza. It was delicious. After a while Soundscape arrived. An hour later Jersey completed his hike. Fresh Ground ordered another pizza for us. It was a nice way to end a long day.

We left all unnecessary gear at the NOC so we could more easily hike the 21.4 miles back to the NOC. For those who hike south, the climb up from NOC is very dip. By slack packing north to the NOC, we had a smaller climb up Wayah Bald mountain to 5342 feet in the beginning and a long hike down to the NOC at the end. 
It had been raining all night and was still misty.  The mountains were encased in a cloud. As I neared the summit of Wayah, the rain turned to a light snow. It was like a wintertime post card materializing around me. The snowy, wet leaf covered trail became very slippery. As I descended in alto, the snow returned to rain. 
Today I met several hikers on the trail I hadn’t seen in awhile. Near the summit of Wayah I met Butterfingers with Peaches. Later I met Old Army 1775 who I met at a shelter a week ago. 
Around noon, I rounded a turn in the trail to discover, much to my surprise, Fresh Ground setup. We had thought he’d left the area. He purposely doesn’t let hikers know where he’ll be so they don’t follow him, instead of him following them. 
Soundscape was there already. I ate two cups of his awesome beef chili and a cup of coffee with hot chocolate mixed in it. Fresh Ground grilled several thick slices of buttered bread to go with the chili. Fresh Ground fed us four times on the trail. What an amazing trail Angel. A mile after we had lunch with Fresh Ground we met Handbill, Cactus and Hop Skip heading south. We made plans to have dinner with Cactus and Hop Skip in Franklin. 
It was another long, exhausting hike like yesterday of over 21 miles. Again I finished before it got too dark.

Zen from Gooder Grove Hostel picked us up at the NOC this morning at 8am and drove us up the winding mountain roads to the trailhead. The drive was long but beautiful. The road followed a river, beautiful waterfalls all along the way. 
The trail was exceptionally easy. The grade was very moderate until the last 1/2 mile. We hiked slowly up and over some minor hills and then up Albert Mountain to elevation 5250 feet. We then ascended the stairs to the top of the Albert mountain fire tower. The 360 degree views from the tower were spectacular. The surrounding mountains were awash in fall colors. 
We hiked down from Albert where Zen picked us up and took us to his hostel in Franklin for the night. When we arrived, Zen gave me a box: it contained trail magic from Painless (We hiked together in New Hampshire and Maine and up Katadin). It was packed full of good snacks for us all. His kindness and generosity are much appreciated. 
We went to a local restaurant for dinner. Before leaving, Soundscape played us a video his daughter made. She expressed her feelings of amazement at what we had accomplished and how wonderful it was that we’d made this journey together. She ended by reading the closing passage from Tolkien’s The Hobbit. And she asked us to give her Dad a hug for her, which we all did.
I had shrimp and grits with garlic bread, a salad and a local made porter. For dessert I had chocolate cake. Since it was Soundscape’s birthday, I asked the waitress if she’d sing to him, which she did. She was very loud and theatrical. We enjoyed our time together knowing our journey would soon be over. Please watch episode 194 of EB on the AT on YouTube

The air was nippy all day during my 14 mile hike. The elevation changes were not too difficult so I didn’t get overheated. I started with my fleece hat, jacket and gloves and kept them on much of the day. 
A few minutes after Jersey, Soundscape and I passed the 2100 mile mark we met a group of 10 young hikers heading north. One asked if we were thru hikers.

Three days later, we met and started hiking with CB snd Easy, also section hiking . CB left after 10 days to return to work; Lieutenant returned to her family but hiked with us again in Massachusetts, joined by Roots (Easy’s friend) who hiked with us for three weeks. Easy and I, however, hiked together continuously from the High Point Shelter in New Jersey all the way to Hanover, New Hampshire, about 400 miles. He had to go home due to an injury.
With 69 miles left to go on my adventure, Easy drove up from his home in Florida to join me and the other guys for the final week of our hike. He parked his car near Amicola Park, where the trail ends, and got a shuttle to Dicks Creek Gap. 2Hatz and We met him there about 9am. Soundscape arrived shortly after. Jerzey was already on the trail. 
It was a late start for us but we only had 13 miles to go. Today the weather was exceptionally nice. It was sunny and warmer than it had been. We hiked up and over Kelly’s  knob. Then we hiked over 4400 foot Tray mountain. Our campsite for the night is Cheese Factory, I assume there was a cheese factory here at some time in the past. 
In the fading light, I setup my tent. Then I went down the blue blaze side trail to the water source. The trail went about 100 yards, crossed a gravel road and then to a spring. I filled my water bag and carried it back up the side trail. As I crossed the road, I saw two wild pigs, or boars, about 50 feet away. One started walking towards me. Knowing they can be viscous animals, I quickly walked away.

Easy and I left just as it began to get light, around 6:30. We wanted to get to Mountain Crossing at Neels Gap early to have time to recharge our phones and get resupplied before hiking over Blood Mountain. 
The hiking was easier than any of us expected. Again, we had clear blue skies and it was warm. 
I arrived at Mountain Crossing about noon. Soundscape was there, eating a pizza. 2Hatz had already come and gone. 
The tip on one of my trekking poles broke so I needed a replacement tip. The pole slips when I use it and I use the poles to hold up my tent. A broken tip was a problem. But the guy at Mountain Crossing was able to replace and fix it. 
He had leftover birthday cake from an employee’s party yesterday and kept insisting we eat it. I ate two big pieces. Then he baked a frozen pizza, which I also ate. This was probably the last time I’ll be able to eat so much. I don’t expect to burn so many calories in my non-trail life. 
Jerzey, Soundscape and I relaxed at the picnic table while eating and charging our phones and battery packs. After awhile, Easy arrived and joined us. Easy, not hiking at our aggressive pace, is going to a hostel and plans to reunite with us down the trail. He stayed, waiting for a shuttle to the hostel. 
The three of us began our hike up and over Blood Mountain, the last difficult climb on the trail. The mountain is the highest peak on the Georgia section at 4458 feet. The trail was mostly easy with some rocky sections. And the climb up was not too hard. It’s probably difficult for new hike starting at Springer mountain but after hiking up hundreds of mountains and over 2165 miles, it was just another climb for us. 
On the way up I met a day hiker coming down. He recognized Jerzey and I from Jerzey’s YouTube video (EB on the AT). Someone had recommended it to him; he doesn’t know Jerzey or any of us. Suddenly, we were YouTube celebrities. 
We arrived to setup camp at Woods Hole Shelter to discover 2Hatz wasn’t here. I turned on my phone and received a text he’d sent the three of us earlier. For reasons he didn’t explain, he decided to finish the hike without us. He expressed his admiration for what we all have accomplished and thanked us for sharing our knowledge and trail experience. Sadly, after hiking with Soundscape and I for 1000 miles, he won’t be there to see us finish. Nor will we have the opportunity to say farewell to each other in person.

I woke at 5am, reluctant to get out of my quilt. But nature called so I put on my shoes and headed to the privy for the last time on the AT. Today, I would end the journey I began on April 19. 
I made coffee in the vestibule of my tent, protected from the cold. No oatmeal this is. I ate two Pro-bars and a pop tart. I packed up and took down my tent. Soundscape and Jerzey were also packing up. We hiked out of the Springer Mountain Shelter camp area together.
The summit of Springer was a ten minute hike south. We arrived at 7:25am. There it was: the bronze plaque on a rock designating this point as the southern terminus of the 2193.1 mile-long Appalachian National Scenic Trail. 
One by one, we each approached the bronze plaque and placed our hand on it. Jerzey stepped up and kissed the plaque, as if it were a hiker’s version of the Blarney Stone. Seeing the plaque, touching it, I immediately felt overwhelmed with emotion at what I had accomplished. 
Jerzey yelled, “We did it, boys!” We all whooped with excitement. Just then, two dogs from a nearby campsite came barking and running around us. After a minute, their owner showed up and asked if the dogs were bothering us. “No,” I said, “They’re celebrating with us.” He offered to take our pictures. 
After a few minutes of picture taking and each of us signing the log book (kept in a drawer built into the rock), we started our hike down the AT Approach Trail to Amicalola Falls where our families would meet us.
The 8 mile hike took us five hours, mostly because we took our time and stopped for a few short breaks. When we reached the falls, I was amazed at how high it is. It’s a beautiful site. There were throngs of people viewing the falls. We made our way through the crowds, our packs occasionally bumping people. 
Finally, we neared the famous arch where NOBO hikers launch their thru-hike in spring. Before I saw the arch, I heard our family members begin to scream. They had seen us coming. Jerzy yelled out his wife’s name. 
Brian and Monica were holding up a colorful banner, “Congratulations father, Bookworm!” My wife Marie gave me a hug and kiss. My kids hugged me. I hadn’t seen any of them since August. Soundscape’s wife Tara was there. Also, Jeremy, a man Soundscape had rescued at sea in his capacity as a NOAA ship’s captain, was there with his wife and kids to greet Soundscape. 
Afterwards, we all went to a cabin that Jerzy and his wife, Rosemary, rented. There was a large spread of assorted foods. We all enjoyed food and drink and talked for a few hours. It was a fun gathering to celebrate our accomplishment.

Bookworm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645784,"It has been nearly a week since I touched the plaque on the summit of Springer Mountain, the end of a 7 month, 2,193.1 mile long journey. I can hardly believe the amazing adventure is over. I finished without any injuries, the one thing that was most likely to end the hike prematurely. Although  I'm still processing and reflecting on the journey and all it encompassed, I wanted to share my thoughts so far.  
This was one of the most challenging things I've ever done. It was hard, both physically and mentally. There are no easy days on the trail, just some that are less difficult than others. I expected that getting up at the break of dawn and walking through the woods all day carrying a 25-30 lb backpack, hiking up and down mountains and sleeping on the ground would be tiring. I knew that being away from my family, friends and my daily life for half the year would be difficult, too. It was much more difficult than I anticipated. I did not anticipate the rock climbing in New Hampshire to be so frightening or how difficult it would be to walk over miles of jagged rocks in northern Pennsylvania. Nor I did I anticipate just how emotionally taxing it would be to be away from my family for so long. 
As I built up the miles, my legs, lungs and heart grew readily stronger making the physical challenges less insurmountable. As I conquered each challenge before me, my fortitude and confidence grew. I resolved to never quit, to just keep going forward. When the trail went up and over a mountain in the wind and rain, that's where I hiked. If it went through a boulder field, I climbed over it. If the trail led me through a black, muddy bog, I slogged through it. It didn't matter if there were clear, blue skies or I was in a thick fog and pouring rain, I went where the trail led me. No matter the challenge, I followed the white blazes and rock cairns- north to Katahdin, then south to Springer Mountain. I sometimes doubted myself. I often grumbled and complained but, I always accepted the challenge. I always ""embraced the suck,"" as the saying goes, willingly or not.
I believe this adventure helped me to grow as a person. I've become more adaptable and less resistant to change than I had been. As I noted in one journal entry, planning is important but plans are useless. The situation on the trail constantly changes due to weather and other factors, its useful to be able to readjust one's plans in real time. It's helpful to not become too attached to a plan. 
I knew before I started this hike that I was unlikely to quit, short of an injury. Having conquered this challenge, I know I can do anything I put my mind to. Having struggled with long, hard days, wind and rain, cold nights, endless climbs up and precipitous climbs down and all the other rigors of the trail, I feel more confident in my ability to overcome adversity and not let my fears prevent me from moving forward. I know that I can push myself both physically and mentally beyond my self-perceived limitations. 
On the trail, I found that if I hurried to the next destination I was likely to miss a great view or a new experience. On a clear day, it was imperative that I stop and take in a view and worry less about making miles because tomorrow there might not be any views. I took the time to enjoy every experience and every new thing that appeared because I was probably never going to come this way again. Slowing down, having patience and living in the moment made the journey more enjoyable and memorable. 
I am grateful that I was able to see so much of our beautiful country from locations and in a way very few people do. It was wonderful to struggle to the top of a mountain and be rewarded with grand vistas. Few experiences can compare to being on the summit of Katahdin on a clear day and seeing rugged mountains and the blue lakes of Maine far in the distance. Although I took thousands of pictures as I hiked, they can never quite capture the full experience: the feel of the wind, the sounds of birds and insects, the fragrance of the woods or the sound of a stream. Or, sometimes, the silence and solitude of nature. It was overwhelming to be so fully immersed in the beauty of the natural world- insects, animals, birds, trees, fungi, plants, rocks, sand and soil. I was able to experience the full community of nature- the dance of all the living things together in their environment, interacting like a beautiful symphony. I was in this world for almost 7 months and never grew tired of it, never stopped being amazed. I believe too few people get to truly experience the world they are a part of in all its complexity and beauty. I am grateful to have been one of the few. 
As I stated in my first journal entry, I hoped to meet interesting people on the trail. My hopes were fulfilled and exceeded. I met lots of amazing and interesting people from every walk of life, all ages, and from a diversity of backgrounds and careers. There were military veterans, lawyers, dentists, engineers, a surgeon, an oceanographer, college graduates and recent high school grads. Some people had extensive experience with backpacking or long distance trails, many had no experience at all.  
The most amazing aspect of hiking the Appalachian Trail is the community: people running the hostels, those who shuttle hikers to and from the trail and anywhere else they need to go, the people at the businesses catering to hikers in the trail towns, the countless trail angels who provided beverages and food and, of course, the hikers themselves (day, section and thru hikers). The divisions that keep people apart and in a constant state of conflict in the ""real"" world don't arise in the trail community. One's gender, race, political or religious views are irrelevant. Those topics don't come up. The daily chatter of 24 hour news is absent from the trail. I almost never knew whether someone was a liberal or conservative or what religious beliefs they held, if any. When I did know, it didn't matter if they were different than my own; we were all their to help one another make our way on the Appalachian Trail. Everyone was kind and helpful to each other. News of the very few bad apples quickly spread up and down the trail. If the ""real"" world could be more like the trail community, it would be a much better place for us all. The kindness and generosity I encountered every day was amazing and gave me hope for humanity.

Bookworm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645921,"Tomorrow is Giving Tuesday, the perfect time to make a donation to LBDA! 
When I decided to attempt to hike the entire Appalachian Trail, I dedicated my epic adventure of 2200 miles to my cousin Tim, raising awareness of Lewy Body Dementia and donations for Lewy Body Dementia Association (LBDA). I am proud to have had success with all three goals.
Tim received a diagnosis of Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) in 2018. LBD, the second most common form of degenerative dementia, affects over 1.4 million Americans. Unfortunately, LBD is commonly misdiagnosed as a psychiatric disorder or another form of dementia. In fact, the actor and comedian Robin Williams who died from LBD in 2014, was initially misdiagnosed; it wasn't until after his death that it was determined he had LBD (I recommend the film about Williams and his struggle with LBD, ""Robin's Wish""). 
LBD shares some of the same symptoms as Alzheimer's and Parkinson’s Disease. However, treatment is different and some medications used to treat those diseases are not helpful for LBD patients. Some symptoms include impaired thinking, behavior and mood symptoms (including depression, anxiety, apathy and paranoia), hallucinations, sleep disorder, and movement problems such as tremors, stiffness, and difficulty walking. It more commonly affects men between 50 and 80 years old and is progressive. There is currently no cure.
As stated on its website, LBDA is a nonprofit organization dedicated to raising awareness of Lewy Body Dementia, supporting people with LBD, their families and caregivers and promoting scientific advances. The Association’s purposes are charitable, educational, and scientific. You can learn more at the LBDA website, https://www.lbda.org/
 My FirstGiving donation page will remain active and accepting donations until December 31. To avoid the service fee, you may also donate by mail directly to LBDA (for more information visit the LBDA website at https://www.lbda.org/contact-l).  
Thank you to everyone who made a donation.

Bookworm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646163,"A local reporter contacted me to setup an interview withy my cousin and I about my hike of the AT and Lewy Body Dementia. Heather Ly from WGRZ TV arrived on the morning of December 19th with her TV camera. My cousin Tim also came to our house, driven from his home in Rochester, NY by his daughter Jen. Heather visited with my wife, Tim, Jen and I for about three hours. She interviewed Tim and I on camera individually and filmed us interacting with each other. Afterwards, we chatted over coffee and the  cranberry scones I had baked earlier that morning. It was an wonderful visit. The spot Heather made aired on WGRZ TV on December 26, 2021. A link to the video and the story that appeared on WGRZ's website are below:

WNY man hikes Appalachian Trail in honor of cousin; raises money, awareness for Lewy body dementiaDennis Pack knew he wanted to make his nearly 2,200-mile journey about something bigger than himself, so he dedicated his hike to his cousin, Tim Perkins.Author: WGRZ Staff, Heather LyELMA, N.Y. — It wasn't long after Dennis Pack met someone who completed the Appalachian Trail hike when he decided he wanted to take on the challenge himself. 
Pack's wife and children gave him their blessing, and on April 19, he began his nearly 2,200-mile journey between Maine and Georgia.
""I did what's called a flip-flop hike, so I hiked from near the middle at Harper's Ferry, West Virginia, and hiked all the way to Katahdin in Maine, central Maine. Then I flipped back to Harper's Ferry and continued and hiked all the way to Springer Mountain in Georgia,"" said Pack, 60.Pack enjoys the outdoors, but he knew this trek would be unlike anything he had ever done before. 
He camped and slept in a tent 90-percent of the time. He met dozens of people along the way. Other hikers knew him as ""Bookworm,"" his trail name given to him by his wife because of his love for reading. He signed trailhead logbooks with a little cartoon bookworm drawing as a sign he had passed through.
Some finished the journey, while others were sidelined by injury. Pack completed the thru-hike on November 13th, six and a half months after he started.
""Over mountains and through woods and everything else I had to walk through. Bogs, rocks, roots. I am still amazed that I was able to accomplish it,"" said Pack.
Pack's accomplishment was even more special because of whom he dedicated it for.
""I came up with the idea of doing it for Lewy's body. There are a lot of good causes out there, but I thought Lewy body would be a good thing to do it for because of the fact that a lot of people have never heard of it,"" said Pack.
Pack admittedly didn't know about Lewy body dementia until his cousin, Tim Perkins, was diagnosed a few years ago.
""I was now aware that there are people with this disease that could never do this [hike], and in a way, it kept me going knowing that I was doing something like that, on those days that I wanted to quit,"" said Pack.
The pack started on the online journal to document his journey and began a fundraising campaign raised money and awareness for the Lewy Body Dementia Association.
The finish at Springer Mountain, GA was emotional for Pack, but it was also emotional for Perkins, 67.
""I cried. I love all of my cousins dearly, but to think that one of them would go to this extent just to raise a few bucks and get the awareness out there that's so sorely needed? I think it's one of the greatest honors that's ever been bestowed on me, and I am so proud of my cousin,"" said Perkins.Devastating Diagnosis
It was Perkins' wife that noticed something wasn't quite right. Soon after, coworkers noticed a change in his behavior.
""One of the symptoms is you walk to the left. I was bouncing off the walls all the time,"" said Perkins.
He thought his stumbling was due to an inner ear problem. 
""I really thought I would go to the neurologist and they would give me a pill and say see you in six weeks,"" said Perkins. ""When my neurologist told me I had Lewy body, you might as well have told me I stubbed my toe. I had never heard of it, had no idea what she was talking about. (Reporter Heather Ly: Were you scared or thought no big deal?) I didn't know what to be scared of. I had no idea what it was. I looked at her and said at least I don't have Alzheimer's. Woah, sometimes I wish I did,"" said Perkins.
According to the Mayo Clinic, Lewy body dementia is the second most common type of progressive dementia after Alzheimer's.
Perkins has tremors, problems with balance, anxiety, hallucinations, problems with swallowing, difficulty with speech, and REM sleep disorder which brings on vivid, violent nightmares. 
""I'm on 24 medications, maybe 23. There is not one drug for Lewy's body. Not one. We borrow all of our drugs from other diseases,"" said Perkins.
Perkins said Lewy's body dementia steals his mind and his words.
""The part of the brain that has something to say, wants to say it, has to go through other parts of the brain, and other parts of the brain will block it. You've got to fight around it. That's where the stuttering comes from. I'll be in a conversation, and I know what I want to say, but I just can't,"" said Perkins. ""You just lose words. Some people don't want to listen to you because they're uncomfortable.""
Perkins said he often misplaces things or can't see items hiding in plain sight.""I put the toaster in the refrigerator, and if you don't laugh at that, you're going to be crying all day long because you do that stuff all the time. I put all my baking utensils in the dog food bucket. Trying to find those things, geez,"" said Perkins.
On one hand, he has a sense of humor. On the other, he has come to terms with dying.
""It's difficult. It's very sad because I know it's happening, and I know there's not a damn thing I can do about it. It's an absolutely hideous disease. It's stealing us a little chunk at a time. We know it. We know there's going to come a time where I won't know any of my relatives. I'll be virtually a dead mind, and then I will die. It's terminal. There's no way around it,"" said Perkins.
Perkins has been living with Lewy body dementia for almost four years now.
""I also know there are a lot of people who have 10, 11, or 12 years. I don't count it because I don't give a damn. The only thing that's important to me is today. That's all I have. I don't know what tomorrow will bring. I don't know what Lewy will slap me with next,"" said Perkins.
Perkins wants to use whatever time he has left to raise awareness about Lewy body dementia in the hopes that someday doctors will find a cure. He hopes people will take time to ask questions, listen, and learn about the disease that is slowly robbing him of his mind.
""People will say [I forget things too], and they think it's well-meaning but it's not. If I just walked into a room and say I can't remember what I was looking for, you hear it all the time, 'I do that too.' No, you don't. The difference is you're not dying from it. I am,"" said Perkins.
Perkins credits his family with helping him through, especially his wife.
""I know I am putting my wife through hell. She didn't buy into this. This is not something she asked for any more than I did,"" said Perkins.He is also a part of an online support group for people with dementia. Click here for more information on the Dementia Action Alliance.
