So after waking up again and started going in the rain this was not going smooth. I called Linda at Spivey Gap and she was still at Johnson City so she came back to get me and help with getting the pole fixed. We ended up going to REI and the guy took it apart and repaired it which was great but I still ended up buying other stuff. Then lunch. Then the Chiro again. 4th time In 3 days. Not so good.

After that the day breezed by, not much to report till I got to the shelter where I saw Rambo, haven't seen him for about 400 miles, pretty cool how that happens, there was one other younger hiker there, seemed a little lost, quits early and starts late ? But an older couple came in to eat there dinner there, I knew them before they confirmed, I had been reading there journals well before starting the trail. It was Third Monty and Mr Fix It , they are in there 70s and this will make there triple crown, a lot to learn from them, I had a great conversation with them and feel I will see them again sometime?

Shooter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645357,"Today Started kind of early, we headed to the Kiosk at about 3:30 am to get in line, they only accept the first 12 at the Birches to stay over, otherwise you have to hike all the way there and summit the same day. So Evan at 3:30 we were# 5 and 6 in line and had to wait till 7am for the rangers to give us the talk and confirm that once we sign in we cannot go back out or we lose our turn, no problem everyone wanted to complete. Then a nice leisurely 9.5 mile hike, following lots of water and pretty nice terrain, we got to the Birches and got another talk from the rangers about the dangers and once we got okd went to a nice shelter where it started to pour almost right when we got there so that was extra nice. Still some in tents not sure why, the only other hikers I knew here were Slim Shady only from giving rides to in Gorham and Tangles, she was a really strong hiker that we crossed paths all the way from Mass to Maine. So after we were settled and watching it rain it finally stopped, still kind of early so me and Nerddle walked to the campground, not much there but just enjoying the area, wouldn't you know it while we were gone and on air way back about a1/2 mile it started down pouring again , so even our 2nd to last day we got soaked, oh well dried off and had a nice Ramen","Abol Pines Campground

Shooter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645686,"Last Day !
¬† Got up or usual time and put on my dry socks I have been saving the last couple days and headed out, got a few pics and enjoyed the early hike, after getting up to the line we had to dress up, cost, hat, gloves it was getting really windy and being about 40 must have brought it down to low 30s , there is a good amount of hikers on the trail and pretty challenging, foot hold , rebars and straight ups , once we got over the crest the visibility got worse to. When we reached the Summit we had to get in line and there was a large group ahead of us that wanted every picture combination , ughh. Took our few pics and moved out the cold was setting in, made it back to the Abol Trail and took that, it was a little steeper but got us out of the wind really quick and it was the route most took , the sun came out of course and warmed up quickly, made it a pleasant hike down , but now it started to sink in that this was it and almost over, made it to Abol campground and sat for a while with so many other hikers , then started our 2 mile walk back to the Birches where Wifey will pick us up. Got picked up and headed out of the park Me, Nerddle and Slim Shady we dropped him in town, checked in to the Millinocket Inn cleaned up and supper, just hung around and had a great night¬† the next day we will take off with Nerddle , we will give him a ride to the Bangor Airport and head home.","Birches Lean to
