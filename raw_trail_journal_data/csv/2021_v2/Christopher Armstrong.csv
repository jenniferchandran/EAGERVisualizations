Christopher Armstrong,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626020,"16Jan20 - Today I submitted my retirement letter for 01 June 2021.  I will be on terminal leave starting on 12 March 2021 with an expected start date of 22 March 2021. For those not familiar with the military, ""Terminal Leave"" is the time before your retirement date that you use up all the rest of your vacation time.  We are allowed to carry up to 60 days a year without it expiring.  It is not as hard as it sounds since there isn't much time for vacation depending on the job you are in.  If one does it correctly, you can end up with 110 days of vacation at the end with everything added in.  I will be lucky enough to end up with approx 80 days of vacation on the books allowing me to finish my job on 12 March 2021. Now I have 59 weeks until my last day and have to start planning this next adventure.",,View Entry,"Jan 16, Thu",0
Christopher Armstrong,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626021,"23Jan20 - I figured the best way to start prepping is to actually purchase something.  I figure if I have gear sitting around the house, it will be hard for me quit before I even start. I have been doing a lot of research over the past year on gear and following certain people on YouTube for reviews and feedback. I received a few gift cards to REI for Christmas and that is where I am starting to purchase my first few items.  My first piece of gear finally arrived today. I was surprised at how light it actually was.",,View Entry,"Jan 23, Thu",0
Christopher Armstrong,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626022,"29Jan20 - I had some left over gift cards to REI from Christmas and had a bad day at work. The two combined could only be cured by more purchases for my AT trip in 2021. Also if you wish to follow my pics for preps and eventually the trip, you can find me over on Instagram @ chrisuscga01",,View Entry,"Jan 29, Wed",0
Christopher Armstrong,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626023,"31Jan20 - Needless to say I have gotten soft over the past decade.  Growing up, I was an avid runner and skinny as a pole.  Over the years I have gotten lazy and turned to food as my coping mechanism to counter stress in my life.  The past 7 years have been a rough one to say the least.  12 funerals in 7 years. Now I have to work on getting in shape for the constant mileage on my feet in the next year.  Starting off slow and hoping to build up to 5-8 miles a day of either walking, running, or a combo of both.  Cold outside so having to stay indoors for next few months.",,View Entry,"Jan 31, Fri",0
Christopher Armstrong,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626136,05Feb29 - It’s that time again. The beginning of the month when I get paid and have to purchase gear. This is my next round of gear. By doing the purchases once a month it helps spread out the cost and has the added benefit of boosting my morale monthly.,,View Entry,"Feb 05, Wed",0
Christopher Armstrong,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626090,"07Feb20 - Today I am working on more gear prep.  I am doing my best to enter everything into a spreadsheet to allow me to track cost and weight.  This way I can hopefully see if things are getting out of control.  While I cannot share with you the ever changing spreadsheet, I am using a website to document my gear set up along with the gear section in this journal.  The website can be found at https://lighterpack.com/r/9vj6... and it is currently listing all the gear I have narrowed down that I plan on purchasing.  I am using the gear section in this journal to document the ""actual"" gear that I have purchased so far.  I hope that makes sense to the 3 of you reading this.",,View Entry,"Feb 07, Fri",0
Christopher Armstrong,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626293,"19Feb20 - From what I have heard, once you make it past the first 250 miles or so it turns from a physical battle to a mental battle. I'm doing as much research as I can to prepare myself for this journey. I highly recommend reading this book ""Appalachian Trails by Zach Davis"" if you are planning your first long hike.  It doesn't matter if you are doing the AT, PCT, CDT, etc.  This book applies to all trails.  It covers the psychological piece of trail and is a very quick and easy book to read.  
One of the sections in the book covers ""I am Thru-Hiking the AT because...."". I think this is a great idea to have completed ahead of time so you can reflect on why you are on the trail when it sucks. Here are a few that I either stole from the book (b/c they were relevant) or that personal to me:
1. Need some time to figure out what I want to do in life after I retire from the Military.  Right now I have a ton of options in my field of specialty (IT).  However, there are too many options and I could use some time away from everything to figure out my next step in life.
2. I want to try something new.  Over the past 18 years, my wife has pushed me outside my comfort zone (couch / tv / xbox / repeat) to take me on some outstanding adventures.  It is time to do something adventurous on my own. 
3. I have the time now before I start a new job. 
4. I need a change of pace. Currently I am in the rat race of life and work and it is killing me...literally.  My health has been on the decline over the past few years and it is 100% attributed to my job.  I am hoping to slow things down, de-stress, and get the old body moving again to get my health (mental and physical) back on track. 
As always any questions let me know.",,View Entry,"Feb 19, Wed",0
Christopher Armstrong,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626390,"24Feb20 - My goal was to not purchase any clothing until next Fall / Winter.  I am hoping to ""slim"" down a few pounds and want to make sure items fit.  However I have a ski trip coming up next month and need more clothes. I broke down and purchased the Melanzana Micro Fleece Hoodie.  You can only get this item locally at the store OR.....on ebay.  You are going to pay 1.5-2x more in price than at the store.  However, as someone who lives on the East Coast, purchasing this product on Ebay is still cheaper than me flying to the store location.  As far as form, fit, etc....this item is light.  I mean really light coming in at around 12oz. The fit is slim so make sure you measure correctly.  This cut is not meant to be bulky but rather a base layer.  More to come on review after use.",,View Entry,"Feb 24, Mon",0
Christopher Armstrong,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626613,"01Mar20 - It is the beginning of the month and gear has arrived again.  I have settled in and will be going with a Zpacs Arc Blast 55L Backpack.  With that in mind, this round of gear includeds:
1. Zpacks Wallet
2. Zpacks Bag Liner
3. Zpacks Stake Sack
4. Zpacks Shoulder Pouch
5. Zpacks Belt Pouch (2x)
6. Zpacks Front Utility Pack Accessory 
7. Zpacks Bear Bagging Kit8. Zpacks Sit Pad - I may be changing this out for the Therma-Rest Sit Pad.  The Zpacks Sit Pad is a little on the small side. 
Pictures can be found under the gear section. Have a good month.",,View Entry,"Mar 01, Sun",0
Christopher Armstrong,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627232,"21Mar20 - Today marks the 1 year mark until I am hoping to start the AT in 2021.  As I look towards the future, I'm doing the best I can to prep my mind about what is about to come.  Today I received ""Hiking Home"" in the mail.  It is one of many books I have been scouring to glean some knowledge I have missed elsewhere.  I also want to send a shout to the class of 2020 who are dealing with whether to stay or to leave the AT after calls to get off the trail due to the coronavirus (and lack of TP). Hope that those get off are able to get back out in 2021.",,View Entry,"Mar 21, Sat",0
Christopher Armstrong,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627969,"15MAR20 - Just checking in.  It has been a while since I have posted due to this COVID outbreak.  As a status update, all gear purchases are on hold until the fall.  Hopefully by then we will know more about whether the trail will be open in 2021 or not. I know it is officially open still, but with all the uncertainty of another flare up in the winter, who knows.  Also my start date my shift from 22Mar21 till 15March21.  With the lack of vacation being taken right now, I may be able to retire earlier than anticipated.",,View Entry,"May 15, Fri",0
Christopher Armstrong,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629390,21JULY20- Greetings. I'm still here. COVID (cough cough) has put most of my purchasing on hold. I am still waiting a few more months to see how things play out. I am hoping the trail is open in 2021.  Plan is still mid-May to get on the trail. I'll update again once I start purchasing my big three.,,View Entry,"Jul 21, Tue",0
Christopher Armstrong,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630427,6 Sept 20 - Well here we are. Things are starting to sink in that this is possibly going to happen. I have 170 days till terminal leave starts in the military.  This is the time before retirement where you are on vacation based on how much you saved up.  For me its close to 100 days or a little over three months.  So the first half of my time on the AT will be paid for by the US Gov't which is really nice. By my estimates I have 189 days till I start off on 14 March 2020 (that is the current plan). I have started purchasing equipment again and it looks like Christmas from Amazon everyday at my house. I will continue to post here as I receive gear.  For some reason I am having issues uploading to this site my gear so will have to get back at it later this month.  As always you can follow me over on Instagram @ chrisuscga01 . Thanks for following.,,View Entry,"Sep 06, Sun",0
