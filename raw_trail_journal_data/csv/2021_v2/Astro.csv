So we actually hiked 9.1 miles. On the way there I learned for the first time from my Dad that we are related to Daniel Boone. Starting base weight was 35 pounds (not including food and water). And for food we were carrying things like apples, apple cake, bagels, PBJ sandwicheds, etc.. Needless to say over time I would learn a lot to get my base weight down to less than half of that. That night at the shelter we fortunate to have a Science teacher explain a lot to us about the stars and astroids, etc. It was such a clear sky with out interfering lights out in the woods. The great adventure had just begun.","Springer Mountain

We shared a Mexican Chicken and Rice that another hiking father and son gave us. Learned two things: 1. definitely need to buy a stove (JetBoil), 2. bring a Mountain House for each of us so we do have to share. The other hiking Dad had AT&T so we let him borrow our Verizon phone. Also yogied a bottle of water from some day hiking women. Learned not to be so picky about water sources in the future, but they really helped us out this time.","Gooch Gap

Unfortunately I did not teach him that a double white blaze means the trail is about to turn. On Blood Mountain it was raining and foggy and after we passed the shelter you supposed to take a left from the rocks into the trees. Well after going straight down the rocks for at least 15 minutes I realize it was getting more difficult and we had not seen any white blazes. So now we had to climb back up the wet rocks and after around 30 minutes sure enough I saw the double white blaze on the rocks and then the white on the tree. Stopped to take a break before carrying on and sure enough another couple came up and were about to go down the rocks too, but I told them the trail went to the left in the trees. They were grateful and I now use this an example in my classes of the difference between experience and wisdom. Experience you learn from your mistakes like we did, Wisdom you learn from someone else's mistakes like they did.My sister Sandy and Micah picked us up at Mountain Crossing at Neels Gap. From there we went to Big Al's Pizza Buffet in Hiawassee. Timmy and I smelled like hikers and we really cleaned up on that buffet!Timmy really enjoyed it and we were looking forward to our next section at spring break.

There were soft drinks, honey buns, snickers, etc.. I was getting tired of the PBJ sandwiches which we were eating for lunch, so I left my last one in the Trail Magic cooler. I figured if someone wanted it they could eat it, and worst case it would just get thrown away. That night at the shelter while eating our Mountain House meals Crank Daddy came up to eat by us. He asked if we had any of the Trail Magic at Unicoi Gap and we said yes, he then went on to brag about the wonderful PBJ sandwich he had. He had not been off the trail since Springer Mountain and needless to say he had enjoyed it a lot more than I would have that day. Later I would read his Trail Journal and sure enough he mentioned meeting us and about the wonderful PBJ sandwich he got from the Trial Magic box. Someday maybe I will let him know it was mine.That night the other hikers wanted to name Timmy Sherpa for the way he kept gathering firewood for us.

I told him if I was cutting off the handle of my toothbrush, I certainly did not want to add that type of weight (never mind the issue of it was legal). So only a few miles after he dropped me off this morning what do I run into but a 6 foot rattle snake in the middle of the trail. The mountain ridge was straight down on one side, and the other side was very heavy brush, so there was no way to walk around. And the snake was not going to move as long as I was standing there.

Albert Mountain required some rock climbing, so I more or less toss my poles ahead as I climbed up the rock. The views were nice at the fire tower. This would be my longest day to date on the trail.

Interesting thing was up until now I had never carried bug spray or needed. But this trip I would use it everyday. I assume that is related to the record rains.

I am guessing him to be in his early 70s and he was in great shape and a strong hiker. He had graduated from the Naval Academy, then flown planes in Vietnam. After that he had worked as stock broker and appeared to have done well for himself, but was very humble and always friendly and helpful. He chose the trail name NAMI for his work with the National Alliance on Mental Illness. Pocahontas would also be at the shelter with us. Another man section hiking was at the shelter with us (Jim I believe) and had planned go from Hot Springs to Erwin, but instead would get off the next morning due to all of the rain.

I buy 3 32oz ones, drinking one, filling my Nalgene water bottle with one, and making the other my ""new"" other water bottle.

Back in 2016 I had taken the Northern part of the Sherburne Pass after Maine Junction to stay at the Inn. It also helped me avoid a one mile road walk.Skipped Killington Peak, but I could hear the gondolas or ski lifts clanging. At first I thought it might be lightning, especially with the rain yesterday. Speaking of rain some wet rocks and mud but overall not too bad. A little ways after heading down from Killington you run into the crazy roots all over the trail. They are a pain and really slow you down.I got really lucky and caught a ride into Rutland before dark. Still had to walk a little over a mile to catch the bus back to the Inn, but I was grateful for that ride. Unfortunately past 9pm when I showered and came down to eat, and no dinner menu. But I did get some of their stew with bread and I believe some kind of desert bread. It was good, but after the day I had I could have used more.

Tougher climb at the end of the day up Smarts mountain. The rain made the rocks slick, and I fail pretty good one time. Finally make it to the cabin just before dark and go to get some water and it starts to rain. Water trail longer than I thought it would be and it poured heavy on me before I could make it back to the cabin.

A pair of women were section hiking to try and complete the AT. I had been passing and being passed by them for a few days. One from Baltimore had made it as far as Mt Garfield, but was redoing some of it to get her legs back before the Whites. Her partner was from Idaho and told how she had once kept hiking on plantar fasciitis for five days, and then could not go hiking a gain for over a year.  That was a little concerning. Then I met a SOBO named Gas Tank that trying to finish up his Thru attempt from last year. He had gotten hurt in ME last year and then skipped ahead to Rutland. To keep my hike alive I was considering jumping past the Whites, and doing some of ME, and then picking up the Whites next summer. His advice was not to bother, with all the roots and wildness of ME it would not be any easier.
As I was climbing Mt Cube it started to rain some to make the rocks nice and slippery. A little before the peak I misread a double blaze to mean go straight up instead of trails goes to the right (would have expected the higher blaze to offset to the right for that). After making what was for my short legs and arms seemed like a ridiculously hard climb pretty much straight up, I had some great views (better than what I saw later at the actual peak). But after taking some pictures, I started looking for some blazes, and none were to be found. Of course every set of loose rocks you start wondering was that supposed to be a cairn. So I started walking around in circles of increasing size (after going a little bit down some pseudo trails that were not the AT, until eventually I saw a blaze, and it led back to where I had climbed vertically up. So now I could turn around and look for the blazes and cairns in the other direction. A least being ""lost"" for a while served as a distraction for a while from my foot. But by the time I made it down Cube Mountain, I felt like it had made cube steak of my foot.
I loved the signs put by the Dartmouth Outdoor Club (DOC). I also like the white streak through the rocks like a big white blaze. Some may think it was God's way of telling Myron Avery where to route the trail.","Fire Waredens Cabin

So I got up early and when I got to the spot on Cape Moonshine Road where his red truck was supposed to be parked, it was empty. But just as I was about to walk on, his red truck was coming down the road.Carl retired from construction where he used to restore historic buildings and now does trail magic. He made me an awesome omelet with peppers and onions.He had asked if I wanted 12 eggs, but I said 8 would do.He said the record was 24. I also had a corn muffin with honey.He also had bananas, gallons of water and fruit drink, and of course coffee.Since I was the only one there that early I had a great conversation with him.

Earlier that day I had taken the picture of the fake moose, and just after that as I reentered the woods from the road I saw the deer just a few feet away. The last picture is of how the rain was causing a pipe someone had set up to really flow.
The rain was harder and much longer today than any other day, but the elevation of the trail was milder.I did slip once off a rock into ankle deep mud. As usual I could hear Highway NH 25 long before I reached it, but the last .3 of mile on it was a pleasant stroll relative to the last few days and in anticipation of the hostel with a shower, laundry, and a roof for the rain which was pretty steady for the rest of the night. I got to stay in the new bunkhouse and it still smelled like cedar (at least I believe that is what it was). It is always nice to have a shower, clean clothes, and a real bed.

By the end of the day my knees were hurting more. 3,000 feet uphill and 3,500 downhill can do that to you.  Not for sure pictures do the panoramic views justice. Hiked in shorts and short sleeves, but put my jacket on at the summit due to viscous wind.

Ankle was fine, and only fell once this time on a wet rock, but my pack softened the blow. Did start feeling my knees. Woke up that night with pain in my legs. My daily 4-6 mile walks with a pack were just enough to prepare for this. Ended up the only one at the campsite and the shelter was, but if caretaker showed up I thought he might not appreciate me putting my tent in there. Used the bear box although the clips didn't close. Jammed one in sideways just in case there was a smart bear.  Never really saw any good views from Mt Wolf. Did grab this quick one by the power lines before Elza Brook.

Well around a mile later (and the trail not really been heading downhill like I expected), I realized I had gone south. So now I have to walk a mile back to the Hut. But this time I remembered to ask a Croo guy for some pliers, and at least I was able to tighten the lock which kept slipping on one of my poles. I bet I adjusted that lock over 100 times yesterday. So now I can start my 3 miles to Franconia Notch, and it was so much easier trail than I had be doing the past few days. Which my body so appreciated (note to self: the Whites is not the place to try to get your trail legs). Also got to walk across a couple of brooks.
Bisquick from the Hikers Welcome Hostel had contacted me that they needed the key from my van, so I had agreed to leave it at the Flume Visitor Center. I figured a mile in and a mile out on a paved road should be worth a hamburger (although it was not as flat as I had expected). The plan was to next climb the 2.7 miles to Liberty Springs Campground. Well with the earlier mistake of my 2 extra miles I decided a shower might be nice, and after headed to The Notch Hostel instead. Well I walked 6 miles, but it will only count as 3. I may be working on the slowest traverse ever through the Whites, but I guess the real key is that I get through them, with my body in one piece, not how long it takes.

Instant pain and my pants leg covered with blood. First reaction was to wipe blood away, but it just kept bleeding, so quickly got leg horizontal so it would clot and then put band-aid on it.

Astro,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597436,"Started day off by taking Mountain Pete with me to Gorham. He thru-hiked in 2016 and was doing a flip-flop from Harper's Ferry. Unfortunately he needed to go home and take care of his elderly father. Gorham is much better for logistics in his getting back to Michigan than Glencliff would have been. He called me a true trail angel, but I was just paying forward from James helping me get down from Mt Lafayette to treeline.
I picked up my maildrop from Rattle River Lodge and Hostel to supplement getting me from Rangeley to Stratton. I also stopped by the sporting goods store to buy a new pack cover. Best I could find was a 5oz Mountain Hardwear one. It appears a lot sturdier than the 3oz ULA one that flew off some where on Mt Lafayette. I think the extra space it took up in the Circuit mesh pouch was more of a drawback than the extra 2 oz.  But it should hold up better against the tree limbs, rocks, and wind I have been running up against lately.
Drove on to Rangley to try and find a hostel I might be able to park the van at. Really didn't feel good about leaving it at the trailhead for multiple weeks. Finally lady at Ecopelagicon agreed to shuttle me to the trail head at ME 4 and arranged for me to park at the Congregational Church (for a donation).  
Along the way I bought a new pair of shorts to replace the ones a slip on Kinsmen had put a whole in. I didn't think duct tape was the best long term solution. Treated them with permethrin, but unfortunately forgot to grab the belt out of my old ones.
Loved the trail to Piazza Rock, reminded me of the AT in the south. Interesting rock formations, unfortunately trees made it difficult to get good pictures. 3 father's were there with their sons. One man was from Brazil, so I had a fun conversation with him about the times I lived there. Mentioned forgetting to grab my belt off my old shorts, so he gave me some parachute cord. Good thing I already have a trail name, I would hate to end up with Jethro Bodine. Please note the following on yesterday June 15 0.2m back to Garfield Trail and then another 4.8m down to trailhead. Slept last night on all the dry clothes I had left other than a pair of socks.  After my experience thus far with the Whites especially with Mt Lafayette, decided to move on to Rangley, ME. That will give me a chance to do another 220 miles this summer. Then pick up southern ME and the rest of NH when my body is in better shape.  On the far right is the hiker who helped me down off Mt Lafayette. In between is his best friend from childhood who is visiting from London.  I thought it was nice for trailhead to bench while I was waiting for my shuttle back to Hikers Welcome Hostel.","ME 4, Rangely, ME

Awesome day I will always remember! Beautiful day with around 3,500 feet of elevation gain, but great views that made it worth it! Started day off early with over 2,100 feet up to Saddleback Mountain. Awesome panoramic views and I sat and ate lunch reading Happy Father's Day text from my three son's. My wife even made a nice post about me as a father on Facebook. There were lots of false summits going up Saddleback, but they provided nice views. Next was the Horn, and then at the end of the day Saddleback Junior.
By the time I made it to the shelter it was dark. Usually I set upbmy tent, but since it was so late and was going to rain I just joined the two SOBOs in the shelter. Because of bugs I use my loose tent as a bivy. It really does not take up any more room than my pad and sleeping bag. In NH I was being passed by a handful of NOBOs and an occasional SOBO each day. After jumping up to ME it is just the opposite.

Astro,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597438,"Original plan was 8.0 miles to Spaulding Mountain Lean To. But it rained during the night and most of the day. This made for slippery rocks, so I decided once I forded Orbeton Stream and gathered water I would camp at the first flat place I could find. Fortunately going down to the stream there actually were some rock steps that trail maintainers had built.
Fortunately just after the stream was what AWOL called Woods road. My map said it had been a railroad at one time. Not only was it flat, but it also had a rock I could use to sit and cook on. About this time the rain had stopped so I set my tent up and cooked a very early supper. I was even able to dry my pack cover, jacket, and rain kilt a little.
But eventually the rain came back so I went to bed early. After all the mountains the day before I knew my knees could use the break. That afternoon a SOBO named Colorado (probably at least in his 50s) had the same idea and set up his tent on the same road a little closer to the trail. It was nice talking with him before I took off in the morning. No beautiful mountain views today. Just the stream I forded.

Astro,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597440,"Got off to an early start after the long night's rest. Started off with 1700 feet up Lone Mountain. Had multiple areas I needed to ford due to all the recent rain. The first picture is of where the AT basically became a stream. Lone Mountain had no views, thus just a picture of the sign. I was surprised how small Moose scat is, included my foot in the picture to help give a scale to compare it to.

Ate lunch at Spaulding Mountain Lean To. Like all the other shelters in Maine the water was close and easy to get to. Since I ate dinner/supper so early the day before I got my Jetboil out and made a Mountain House scrambled eggs, sausage, and hash browns. Added a couple of packets of grits to make it a southern boys feast, and then felt good to keep on hiking. Views from Spaulding Mountain we're obscured some by trees. Got a picture of the bronze placque signifying where Myron Avery and crew completed the last section of the AT.
Views from Sugaloaf were much better! Before heading down Sugarloaf there was what AWOL and my map made look like an ""easy"" level section. Unfortunately with all the rain, it more like playing hop scotch to get across the rocks without soaking your socks and shoes. During this time my right knee I had originally hurt on my trial hike for my plantar fasciitis of Pinnacle Mountain (the Thursday before I left AR) began to hurt more. My thoughts at the time were I need to go a Doctor when I get to Statton.
Once I started the steep descent down Sugarloaf things quickly got worse. I believe you go down 1500 feet in a mile with quite a bit of rock to scramble down. It got to where I could not stand to put weight on my right foot due to my knee. I started to take the most Advil gels (Ibuprofen) I had ever taken in my life. My only thoughts were focused on I have to some get down out of these rocks before dark. Fortunately there were some good views along the way. Every time any weight came down on my right leg, my knee felt intense pain. Somehow with prayer, Ibuprofen, and determination I made it down to ford the South Branch Carrabassett River just before dark. By the time I was on the other side and put my shoes back on it pretty much was dark.
I walked on through the campsite I had planned to stay at and 0.1 miles to Carribou Valley Road and called the Stratton Motel and Hostel. He said if I would walk another mile down the gravel road he would he meet me at the trailhead parking lot (a gate blocked him from coming further). I basically drug my right leg along for a mile and was so glad when he showed up. As much as I had enjoyed the past few days, I knew something was seriously wrong with my knee. It was a sharp pain just to walk.
