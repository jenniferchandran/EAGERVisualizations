Pappy and Grammy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632641,"It was a sad day last spring when we decided to cancel the trip upon the recommendation of the ATC.  We ended up taking our grandson Jack up to the Superior Hiking Trail and had a wonderful time, but not the same as our beloved AT.  We spent all winter working out and trimming our pack weights.  I still need to edit our gear list here in Trail Journals but will get to that later.  I purchased a Zpacks tent and backpack and our Hammock Gear has been lightened as well.  We are going to hike the Shenandoah National Park this year and hope to hit the Smokies next summer.  More to come....",,View Entry,"Feb 13, Sat",0
Pappy and Grammy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632782,"We made our reservation for Stanimals in Waynesboro.  Heard so much about how good it was and watched some vlogs.  The constant logistic work is the carrot that keeps us walking and working out.  I am doing lots of stretching this year too to limber up those joints.  We are in our Mid 60's and want to savor every moment of the hike but it will help us keep up with the Grandkids too.  I usually wear Saucony or Peregrines, light and good grip.  Looking at some Altras for my wife as her old shoes are getting a bit slippery on wet rock.
Starting to find food on sale here and there.  We are big PackIt Gourmet fans but love a Mountain House Beef Stroganoff or Chili Mac occasionally.  Our favorite Packit Gourmet is the Shepherd's Pie but also like the Dottie's Chicken and Dumpling and the Texas State Fair Chili.  They have great desserts too.  Sean Emery's videos or Shug have really helped us prepare.  Check him out on YouTube.
Hope all the hikers missed that ice storm last week and were safe, best to all!!!",,View Entry,"Feb 24, Wed",0
Pappy and Grammy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632936,"As our first prep hike looms closer, I begin to wonder about why we love to backpack/hike as much as we do.  I have been following a few of the current AT Hikers, like Underdog and Taylor the Nahamsha Hiker.  When they discover a view or suffer through a mountain (like Sassafras!) it all comes fresh to my mind, the sounds and the smells particularly.  This year I vow to enjoy each step and each raindrop and not always be thinking of what is next.  By trimming our packs down to 20lb or sub (Thanks John and Mary from our hike to Greylock and VT) I hope to have more energy and time to look around and be in the moment.  We walk nearly every single day several miles at a time but it is not the same.
Made some key gear changes.  Instead of the fold up Therma Rest mats we put under our air mattresses we purchased roll up foam rubber mats from Gossamer Gear, 4 oz lighter and we only use them to protect the air mattresses from rocks and such.  I also purchased those fold up silicone cups for our coffee and oatmeal, lighter and smaller than our others.  Each week I cut an ounce or so off, hopefully we can pack our luxury items, a chair and a kindle.",,View Entry,"Mar 04, Thu",0
Pappy and Grammy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633661,"We have been experimenting with some other foods that we may take with us.  The Peak Fuel meals have been really tasty!  Trailtopia's desserts are really good especially Lemon Cheesecake and Triple Berry Crisp.  For lunch we usually eat tuna and cheese on a tortilla but sometimes have a hot lunch with Packit Gourmet's Ramen Rescue.  It is just a little bag of chicken and veggies with hot sauce but it really makes a difference.  I do sometimes dehydrate my own fruit slices such as banana and apple also blueberries for snacks though we don't eat as much trail mix or Gorp as we used to (darn you Snickers!).  Breakfast is usually oatmeal packets but I had one of those Greenbelly Meal Bars and they are quite good.  We stopped at the Cookie Lady's House in Mass and she let us pick blueberries and sold us hard-boiled eggs so now we crave those eggs at convenience stores.The photo shows a MiniMo Jetboil which we no longer use, now we use the Pocket Rocket and sometimes a Fancy Feast with Alcohol.  The photo also shows one of our favorites, the Mountain House Beef Stroganoff, yumm!  This photo was taken at the Shaker Campsite.  Someone camped next to us and fried McDonalds Chicken Nuggets and hot dogs right by our tent.  The next morning there was a Mama bear and her cub just 50 yards away.  We tried to catch them but they are too fast!",,View Entry,"Mar 23, Tue",0
Pappy and Grammy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635345,"In order to prepare for our summer AT hike of the Shenandoah National Park we are going to climb Black Elk Peak with packs.  It is a beautiful hike in the Black Hills of South Dakota.  We will camp nearby by Sylvan Lake.  There are two other fun trails in the area, Lovers Leap and Sunday Gulch that should help us get ready.  We are going in mid May which can be quite chilly in the Black Hills.  I worked at a Summer Theatre nearby where it snowed once in early June.  This will be our first chance to check out our new gear in real situations.  We work out daily and try to hike at least 3-4 times per week.",,View Entry,"Apr 22, Thu",0
Pappy and Grammy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639347,"Lots of prep hikes.  Driving to Stanimals in Waynesboro, VA in 1 1/2 months.  Following the other hikers and learning a lot!  Thanks to the trail maintainers for all their hard, hard work.  We got to help a bit with a bridge a few years back near Upper Goose.  Very hot here in Iowa now.  I am debating whether to bring a puffy to Shenandoah hike in early August?  ",,View Entry,"Jun 16, Wed",0
Pappy and Grammy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641554,"Doing the final packing and prepping.  Looks for good weather in SNP for our hike.  It is almost 100 degress here and more with the heat index.  We feel ready but it will change about 3/4 up the way of the first mountain.  We are vaccinated but will follow CDC guidelines, mostly camp in our tent.  Got our packs to 20lbs which was not easy.  I will miss some of my gadgets but will be bringing lightweight tarp and hammock.  Hoping for good water sources from Rockfish Gap to Loft Mountain Campstore.  We will stop in Mass and visit our son and his family for a few days.  Hope all are doing well on the trail.  -Pappy and Grammy",,View Entry,"Jul 28, Wed",0
Pappy and Grammy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642617,"We finished our hike and it was amazing.  Started out with three hot days and couldn't drink enough water!  Coming into Black Rock Hut we were dizzy and fell asleep in the shelter, too tired to set up tent.  The next day we got an earlier start and hiked to Loft Mountain Campstore.  A friend had reserved a campsite for us and it was right on the AT.  We watched an amazing sunset and did laundry and resupplied.  Our next journey was to Lewis Mountain Cabins where I had reserved a cabin.  I highly recommend a night in the cabins if you can.  The next day we started before dawn and hiked to Big Meadows camping there, again right on the AT.  We took a visit to the Tap Room and ate dinner in the Dining Room.  Left early and made the next day to Skyland where we ended our journey.  The views were amazing and the people we met were great.  Our new Triplex tent worked well and we love our new Nemo Tensor air mattresses.  Pictures to come!","Rockfish Gap

Pappy and Grammy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643009,"Though usually we left the berries for the wildlife, some hot days we could not resist.  It was a tough day from Calf Mtn to Blackrock Hut, in the 90's and we were starting to dehydrate.  We ran very low on water and I approached a young couple and they gave us a bottle of water or otherwise I am not sure we would of made it.  Once at the hut the spring was strong and cold!  We were so tired we slept in the hut that night but didn't get much sleep.  Many furry friends were curious and we could hear them all night.  The next morning we hiked to Loft Mtn where our hiking buddy Die Maker, from CT, had reserved an amazing spot for us.  The campsite was right on the AT and the Park staff were helpful and fun.  Our first stop though was the campstore.  A cold coke never tasted so good and my Grammy discovered the Smoothie machine.  She became addicted to the Strawberry Banana Smoothies!  The next day we showered and did laundry.","

Pappy and Grammy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643010,"On our 43rd anniversary we rented a cabin at Lewis Mtn Cabins and Campground.   While fixing some Rissoto (Mountain House) this deer and her fawn visited us.  A family from Italy was next door and brought us some wine as we had helped them start a fire to grill hamburgers.  We saw several deer and an owl up close.  I recommend stopping by the campstore at Lewis Mtn.  The staff fellow is super nice and they have a lot of good stuff including ice cream!  Right on the trail really, 50 yards.  Beautiful hike out to Big Meadows in the morning.","

Pappy and Grammy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643013,"We debated whether to bring the hammock and tarp but ended up using it in several locations.  We had our lightweight HG Dyneema tarp which is hand for a quick rainstorm and a parachute fabric hammock 7 oz.  The danger is always how easy it is to fall asleep in them.  This shot is from Loft Mtn Campground.  By the way we had an excellent stay at Stanimals in Waynesboro before hiking, we highly recommend them.  They also shuttled us back to our car when done.","
