RJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635600,Started out today at about 9:30 from behind the AT Conservancy in Harper's Ferry.  There were two other hikers doing the same but they were headed north.  No terribly steep climbs today and was at the shelter by about 3:30.  I passed a lot of hikers and all but two were headed north.  It was cool and overcast today and I'm feeling good!,"Harper's Ferry

RJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635680,"Rough day today as I began what is called ""The Roller Coaster"".  It's a stretch of steep close together climbs that really got my knees to burning.  9 more miles of it to do tomorrow.  It's all rocks and the ups and downs are pretty constant and I'm exhausted.  Started at 8 this morning and quit about 4:15.  All that time to do 11 miles! Staying tonight at a nice hostel where I had pizza for dinner and will sleep in a real bed tonight.  Looking forward to pancakes for breakfast tomorrow.  ","David Lesser Memorial Shelter

RJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635770,Tough day today.  A fellow hiker told me that this part of the trail is considered to be the third most difficult and I believe it.  It really was a roller coaster over rocks that took me all day to cover.  Also had battery issues with my phone and hopefully will get those figured out.,"Bears Den Rocks

RJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635805,"Not sorry to leave the Roller Coaster behind me.  Today's climbs are much more manageable.  Is it every hot!  I'm slowing down, drinking a lot of water and deciding to take an extra day to reach Front Royal.","Rod Hollow Shelter
",Whiskey Hollow Shelter,"Apr 28, Wed",8.40
RJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635880,Another challenging day but this time due to weather.  It is extremely hot with high humidity.  Got good phone coverage at the Ridgetop clearing at mile 979.  Feel good and am headed to Jim & Molly Denton Shelter for the night.  Only 5 miles tomorrow to Front Royal for resupply.  I'll totally run out of food after breakfast tomorrow.,"Whiskey Hollow Shelter

RJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635969,Another tough day.  Finished the last of my food for breakfast so the last climb was really hard.  Stopped 32 times to get up the last hill.  The good news was that the heat broke.  Another hiker said it was 90 yesterday and 87 the day before.  The humidity was really high too. Tried to hitchhike off the trail into Front Royal but guess with COVID no one will take a chance so walked 3 miles into town.   Have a hotel room tonight and tomorrow night and will find out tomorrow after a night's sleep if this pain in the hip will subside.  Very high winds today.  Crazy weather!  Would like to go into Shenandoah on Sunday.  We'll see...,"Jim & Molly Denton Shelter
