Rowdy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632092,"I am still holding on to hope that I will be permitted to hike the section from Low Gap (Shady Valley, TN) to Damascus, VA. I know it is only a few short miles, but I am the sole care-giver to my wife who has ""progressive geriatric Dementia"" and not fully capable of caring for herself. Our daughter, who lives in N. Las Vegas, is moving back home after the first of the year, and it is my hope that she will take some of the care for the wife which will free me to do this section. At 81 years young, time is fast slipping away for me. Prayers are appreciated and desired.

Rowdy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632103,"WOW! Yesterday the temperature here in Moss, Tennessee only rose to a whopping 18 degrees, with a feels like temperature of 6 degrees. I can only imagine how cold it must have been on the tops of some of those mountains. Today, it is supposed to rebound to around 45 degrees. IF you are one of those ""out there"", please be safe. I, for one, do not like reading those death notices on White Blaze and other locations.   I have a Montbell 20 degree sleeping bag, but I am looking for a 0 degree Montbell (used). Oh, well, have a great day and God be with you in your daily pursuits.",,View Entry,"Dec 26, Sat",0
Rowdy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641421,"Thought I would take a few minutes and update my Trail Journal with entries and equipment. I have been unable to do any backpacking due to my wife's health. Her memory has gotten to the point that she can't be left alone for any period of time. Physically, she is doing well, it's just her dementia.",,View Entry,"Jul 25, Sun",0
