Silver Streak,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633335,"If not now, when?
I’m 67 and will turn 68 in July 2021.  I’m at the age where you are one bad fall away from having a broken hip. So I want to complete my AT thru hike before it’s too late. 
Why not wait until next year after the COVID pandemic will hopefully be controlled? My wife Nancy and I plan to thru hike the PCT in 2022 and if all goes well the CDT in 2023.  I’d like to get my triple crown at 70. 
I retired from teaching in 2018 and was ready to experience the adventure of completing a thru hike of a long trail in 2019.  I started the trail on 17 February 2019 and discovered that I am capable of surviving the rigors of hiking long days in snow, sleet and rain during the early months of my hike.  I got off the trail in Harpers Ferry and went home for about 2 weeks during spring break to get evaluated for a swollen leg that I thought might have been infected due to a deep wound I sustained from a bad fall I had at the end of the Shenandoahs.  Luckily, I didn’t have any fractures or infection and after some rest my leg returned to normal and I returned to Harpers Ferry to continue hiking.  
I completed 1846 AT miles but had to leave the trail due to severe fractures of my left pinky finger due to a fall I sustained while descending Mt Moosilauke. The fall was my fault because I was trying to unwrap a Cliff Bar instead of paying attention to the steep technical downhill.
I was thinking about finishing the trail last year but the COVID-19 pandemic put an end to that. 
I was planning to start the AT this year on 7 March but changed my mind after a shakedown hike I did on the Foothills Trail (South Carolina) at the end of January 2021. I completed a 154.6 mile YoYo of the 72.3 mile Foothills Trail in 7 days.  It was a cold hike with nightly temperatures in the low 20s which was great for testing out my cold weather gear. It rained one night which got me thinking about how tempting shelters would be during those multiple day AT  rain spells.  Being unvaccinated at the time I didn’t think it would be a great idea for a 67 year old hiker to spend the night crammed into a shelter with strangers during the COVID pandemic.  So I got home and cancelled my AT registration and Amicalola Lodge reservations.
Then within a week I was able to schedule my first Moderna vaccination at CVS.  This seemed like a good omen and my mind returned to thinking about another AT hike.  It didn’t take long to decide to start my hike on 21 March which would be almost 2 weeks after I got my 2nd Moderna shot.  
Today is 17 March and I am almost done with my pre hike preparations.  I am mailing the 2nd of my 19 resupplying boxes today.  I will post a summary of my resupply strategy soon.

Silver Streak,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633342,"I hope to write a few entries detailing some of the gear changes that I’ve made for this year compared to my 2019 hike.   
The first big change is my backpack.  In 2019 I carried the ZPacks Park Haul.  Before I explain why I switched backpacks I want to clarify the ZPacks offer great customer service to thru hikers and honors their warranty.  In 2019 I had constant problems with the Arc Haul.  When I first got the pack I took it out on  Foothills Trail for a shakedown hike.  One of the vertical carbon fiber rods kept going out of alignment and would fall toward the edge of the pack and throw the pack out of balance.  At first I thought it was my fault, that  I just wasn’t packing it correctly so I tried and tried and tried different ways to pack my bag and it never worked.  I contacted Zpacks and they offered suggestions which seemed to help.  So I started the AT with the ARC Haul and after having several weeks of constant rain the middle horizontal frame support started popping out.  This was annoying because I would have to stop in the rain and reinsert the support. I actually ended up losing the support on the trail after it fell out without my knowing. I was also having trouble getting the pack to balance correctly, no matter what I tried it kept listing to the left.  I finally got fed up with the pack and decided that I must have a lemon so while going into Hot Springs I emailed  ZPacks and explained my problem.   They told me that they would send me a new pack to Boots Off Hostel (mile 428).  This pack worked great until just before Duncannon (mile 1149) when the left vertical rod poked a hole thru the pouch that holds it in place.  I emailed ZPacks again and they agreed to mail another pack to Delaware Water Gap (mile 1296).  They also agreed to replace it with a small size pack.  This pack worked perfectly for the rest of my hike.  I still had problems with the middle support occasionally popping out but after I lost it I just decided to lived without it.  I didn’t feel any difference in the way the park rode on my back without the support.
Overall the Arc Haul is very comfortable and I was planning on using it for this years hike.  As luck would have my wife’s old Osprey Exos wore out.  I bought her a new female specific Eja pack for Christmas so she didn’t need her old pack. The Exos small was too large for her anyway.  So I packed up her small Exos and sent it in to Osprey for repair hoping that the pack would need to be replaced.  Lucky for me the pack needed to be replaced and Osprey agreed to replace it with a medium Exos which fits me perfectly. 
I took the Exos out with 8.5 days of food for my YoYo of the Foothills Trail in late January (see my trail journal for this hike).  After I learned how to adjust the load lifters the pack felt great.  I consider the comfort of the Arc Haul and Exos to be equal.  I decided to take the Exos on my 2021 AT thru hike because I believe it will be more durable.  It weighs about 1.5 pounds more than the Arc Haul but that is a small weight penalty to pay for not having to worry about a repeat of the problems that I had in 2019.",,View Entry,"Mar 17, Wed",0
Silver Streak,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633343,"I will once again be using the ZPacks Duplex tent.  I bought a new one during their 2020 sale to replace our 4 year old duplex.  This year I’m bringing the flex poles to give me some flexibility and speed of setup in challenging campsites.  With enough room I can set my Duplex up with trekking poles in about 3 minutes.  I have no problem with getting creative in the routing of my guy lines in areas where roots, trees, or rocks call for a creative set up.  I even set up my Duplex on those wooden platforms that are found in various places along the AT.  However getting creative takes time and it can be very frustrating after a 25 mile day or during a downpour to juggle the guy line positions.  For this reason I am biting the 10 oz weight penalty to make the Duplex “freestanding”.  I prefer using the trekking pole method but will use the flex poles in challenging camping areas.  You can also modify the width of the tent to squeeze it into an area that would be too narrow for a Duplex.
II also played around with rigging up by Zpacks rain poncho in the windward vestibule to block frigid winds or splashback from hard rains.  I had to do this during a night of 30 mph 25 degree winds that I encountered on the Foothills Trail in January.  I found out in 2019 that the wind blows in and sucks the heat out of my sleeping bag. This gave me the choice of lowering the tent which would lead to less air flow and increased condensation which could make my down bag useless or wake up shivering every couple of hours.  
I’m still using my 2015 Zpacks 20 degree sleeping bag with a silk liner to keep the inside of the bag somewhat free from my hiker trash filth.  I discovered that on really cold (19 degree) nights If I placed my sleeping bag inside the liner my bag would keep me much warmer.  I found that this trick also works to keep condensation off the footbox of my sleeping bag.  I washed my sleeping bag this week and it lofts just like it did when it was new.",,View Entry,"Mar 17, Wed",0
Silver Streak,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633384,"Why am I going stove less this year. I don't feel like heating up my dinners after a long hiking day.  I also save about 1 pound (cook set + fuel canister). I use a Talenti Ice Cream jar for cold soaking my meals. I cold soaked my breakfast in 2019 and it worked well This year I'm going to cold soak my dinners.  The chili bean mix requires about 45 minutes to cold soak.  The refried beans and couscous take about 15 minutes.The table includes my recipes and caloric content.  I practiced hiking with these meals during my Foothills Trail YoYo in January.  I didn't cold soak my dinners then because the days were short and the temperatures dropped into the low 30s by dinner time.

All of the mail drops are at locations within 1 mile of the trail.  Page numbers correspond to the 2021 AWOL guide. I know that conventional wisdom tells you that resupply boxes are not necessary on the trail or that you will get sick of the food in your boxes. I'm doing mail drops because it makes Nero resupply days less stressful.  I won't have to hitch or get a shuttle into a town and then have to walk up and down the grocery aisle looking for acceptable food.  Then I will have to spend time repackaging the food.  Minimart food is too expensive.

Silver Streak,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633525,"Yesterday we drove 5.5 hours from Charleston, SC to Amicalola Falls State park where the famous Archway to the Appalachian Trail is located. We spent the night at the lodge and enjoyed our first sit down in a restaurant meal since the pandemic shutdown everyones normal lives. 
This morning I checked in with the AT register and I was hiker # 965. Nancy and I got our pictures taken by the arch and we started hiking around 9:40. The morning temperature was in the upper 30s and it was breezy. Perfect hiking weather. 
The hike up the falls is beautiful. The path up is a mixture of trail, road, and wooden steps. The hike definitely gets your heart rate up but by AT standards it’s not that bad. 
Once you reach the top of the falls you enter the woods and can start enjoying the serenity of hiking in nature. 
The trail from the arch to Spinger Mountain is 8.8 miles.  Once you leave the falls the trail gradually climbs up to Springer. The trail is nicely graded with only a few short steep sections. You basically climb up to a ridge line follow the ridge for awhile and then climb again. You repeat this pattern until you get to Springer. 
Luckily it was a cool day because there wasn’t much water available on the trail. We stopped to get water at the spring by Black Gap Shelter. The spring was supposed to be 0.1 miles off trail but it seemed a lot longer. The spring was flowing great and it was a perfect place for a snack break. 
We made it to Springer Mountain just before 3pm and it was packed with day hikers. We continued on another 0.2 miles to camp in the Springer Mountain Shelter camping area. We were the first ones there and had our pick of the campsites. 
We set up camp and headed down the trail to get water. We were fortunate enough to see a beautiful garter snake by the bear box. The water source was flowing great. We enjoyed a juicy grapefruit that Nancy hiked in for us. 
Tomorrow morning we will hike back to Springer Mountain and I will touch the first blaze. Nancy will hike back to the car and I will head 2193 miles north.  
Hopefully I will remain upright and headed in the right direction. 
Happy trails

19 miles to Ramrock Mountain 
Last night was cold, my watch read 35 degrees this morning.  The wind was blowing all night long. I typically find it hard to get a sound sleep the first few nights of a backpacking trip. 
We both got up about 7:15  to the sounds of birds chirping. 
We left camp around 830 or so and I hiked back to Springer Mountain so I could touch the first blaze and officially start my 2021 thru hike. 
It was nice to have nice weather so Nancy and I could have time to hug and say goodbye for 4 months. In 2019 it was raining and our goodbyes were rushed. I headed north around 9:00 am and Nancy headed back to Amicalola park. 
Heading down from Springer was easy hiking on a nice grade but I had to be careful of my foot placement because the trail had many sections of rocks, roots and slabs. One of my goals is to stay upright and not get injured. There were also a lot of muddy sections that you could carefully rock hop across. 
When I got to the Springer Mountain parking lot it was kind of confusing because there were several trails to choose from but no white blaze on a tree.  Another goal is to keep heading in the right direction so I was going to check the Guthook App but a ridge runner was there scattering rocks from an illegal firepit and pointed me in the right direction. 
Once I left the parking lot the trail became a wonderful smooth trail surrounded by the sights, sounds and smells of the forest. 
The Georgia Appalachian Trail Club does a great job maintaining the trail. 
Eventually the trail flattens out and it follows streams through a rhododendron lined path. It’s very enjoyable to hike in a green tunnel while being serenaded by the sound of cool mountain water cascading down a stream. 
I took a break around 10:30 to get water from the Three Forks River next to a bridge. The trail follows this river for quite a while and the river corridor has an abundance of campsites. 
One of the lessons that I learned from my 2019 AT hike was that everything should be kept in the same place at all times.  During my water stop I was going to mix my protein powder, chia seeds and oatmeal shake. I couldn’t find the funnel that I made to pour the ingredients into my SmartWater bottle with. I didn’t feel like exploding my pack to find it. It’s very hard to pour powder into a narrow mouth bottle. 
For some reason while I was getting water I got an music stuck in my mind.   The song was White Rabbit by Jefferson airplane What triggered that song memory I don’t know but it kept repeating over and over for a long time. 
Around 2 o’clock, as I was coming down the trail to Carvers Gap  I noticed a bunch of hikers hanging around a van. They were either waiting for a shuttle or there was trail magic going on. I couldn’t believe my luck! On my first day I was recieviy trail magic from the legendary or as she puts it, the infamous Miss Janet. I only got trail magic once on my 2019 hike. I thankfully accepted a Mountain Dew and a moon pie. I left pumped up with sugar and caffeine to power me through the next 6 miles to Ramrock Mountain. 
Ramrock Mountain is a dry camp so I stopped at the Gooch Gap  water source to get water   I needed to fill up my 2 water bottles and my 2 cold soak containers. Tonight I’m cold soaking dehydrated black beans,couscous and powdered cheese. 
I arrived at camp around 5pm. The views from the mountain are spectacular. I’m the only person camped here. I can hear owls hooting and coyotes howling. I noticed a big pile of scat by the trail. Could be from a big dog or maybe a bear. 

Tomorrow I don’t have any firm plans on how far to hike or where I’ll stop to camp. I will let my body be my guide. 
I plan on making it to Dicks Creek gap early Wednesday and taking a Nero at the Hostel Around The Bend. I sent a resupply box there.

23.8 miles to Low Gap shelter. 
It was a long day of hiking and socializing. 
I had wonderful night on Ramrock Mountain. The sunset wasn’t anything special but the sunrise was great.  The wind was gusting and occasionally my tent fabric would bow in and hit me in the head. The coyotes were busy howling and yipping off and on.
 It was 41 degrees when I got up around 6am. I ate my cold soaked oatmeal concoction and then went out to the view point to enjoy the sunrise. I hiked out of camp around 7:30. 
Today was a great initiation for some of the difficulties the AT will throw at you, albeit on a smaller scale. There were some steep climbs, mud pits, rocks,  boulders and slabs. Some of the decents like the one going down Blood Mountain required careful foot placement and a little rock scrambling. 
My highlight of the day was taking with two of my favorite YouTube hiking vlogers. IBTAT and Feathers. They have both completed the AT and PCT. They plan on hiking the CDT this year. Feathers is going to hike it with her pet goat.  IBTAT works at Mountain Crossing outfitters in Neal Gap. I stopped there to get some snacks and water. I was hoping for ice cream but they didn’t have any. 
I also got another round of trail magic at hog pen gap. It was perfect timing because it was a hot day and I was running low on water. 
I got to Low Gap shelter around 6pm to find tent city. I was able to locate a small tent site away from most people. The problem with putting in long days is that it’s hard to find campsites when you roll in late. Another problem is getting all of the camp chores done at a decent hour. It’s 9:29 as I write this. 
I had cold soaked refried beans, cheese and ramen tonight. It was a winner. 
I called the Hostel Around The Bend to reserve a room for Wednesday. Tomorrow I hike around 23 miles to a campsite around 5 miles from Dicks Creek Gap where you walk ½ a mile to the hostel. This will give me a short hiking day on Wednesday so I can maximize my recovery time during my Nero.

23.2 miles to Deep Gap shelter campsites.
Last night was uneventful and I didn’t check the morning temperature. 
I got up around 6am and was hiking at 7:20. The sunrise was starting and I made it up to a ridge to see another spectacular sunrise. 
The trail once again was full of good introductory AT hiker lessons. We had the same conditions as yesterday but the climbs seemed longer and steeper.
I spent most of the morning hiking with a guy called Blood Beard. He was on his last day of a shakedown hike to test his gear for his upcoming PCT thu hike. He has already completed the AT.  I enjoyed talking with him about my favorite hiking trails in the Sierra. 
We were joined for several miles by a young woman who goes by two trail names depending on who she is talking with. The PG name is Peanut because she carries two massage balls in a sack and it looks like a giant peanut.  Her other trail name is Ball Sack”. 
The last climb of the day was a long steep one up Kelly Knob. I remember from my 2019 hike that the last climb always seemed to be the hardest. 
I got to Deep Gap shelter camping area at 4:15. It was nice getting to camp early after getting to camp at 6 yesterday. I had good pickings of the tent sites.
Dinner tonight was a chili soup mix, instant potatoes and crushed Fritos. 
My body is filthy and smells like nasty socks. I noticed the stink yesterday and smelled my socks but they smelled better than the rest of me. The days have been sunny and warm. I work up a good sweat going uphill. I actually had sweat in my eyes going up Kelly Knob. 
There’s a good chance that it might rain before sunrise. I hope not. Thursday is supposed to be horrendous unless you like hiking in downpours. The hiking in rain isn’t as bad as setting up and taking down your tent in the rain. 
I only have 4 miles to hike down to Dicks Creek Gap where I will have a ⅓ mile road walk up to the hostel. I can get showered and my laundry done. They shuttle you into the nearest town for groceries or restaurants. 
The T-Mobile cell service has been poor today and yesterday.

3.6 miles to Dick’s Creek Gap plus.0.6 bonus miles to the hostel. 
Last nights dinner of chili soup mix and mashed potato was not a winner. It was a good thing that I bought some Fritos from Mountain Crossings to make it more palatable. The mashed potatoes seemed to feel like a clump in my stomach and they made me dig an extra large cat hole in the morning. Luckily it had stopped raining. On the subject of poop my little bidet attachment has worked great and cuts down on the amount of toilet paper I need to use. 
The campsite that I selected was as far away from the shelter as I could get but the youngsters were having a loud good time (as they should).. Luckily they observed hiker midnight and were quiet by 9pm. 
 The rain started right on schedule at 4am. It was done raining by 6am. I always like  it when the weather cooperates with breaking down camp. 
I left camp at 7:40 and was at the hostel by 9:10. 
It was a joyful experience to clean the filthy stink off of my body.  
I had to get a hiker woman to start the washing machine for me. I thought that I had pressed all of the right buttons but I guess it didn’t like me. The washing machine did a great job cleaning what ever nasty stuff was making my clothes stink. I don’t remember ever smelling so bad in 2019, but I left a month earlier so it was a lot colder. 
The hostel shuttled everyone into town this afternoon. Some people went to a Mexican restaurant for lunch but I eat cold beans every night and wasn’t about to eat beans in town. I got a huge turkey sub, a pint of Talenti ice cream (for a new cold soak jar) and a venti caramel macchiato from Starbucks. I also got two new smart water bottles replacements. I mix hot chocolate and coffee in my bottles for breakfast and my protein shake concoction for lunch so I like to replace them whenever I can. 
Tomorrow is going to be a terrible rain event day. Thunderstorms and a flash flood watch. Most of the hikers at the hostel are going to take a zero day tomorrow. I have a schedule to keep if I want to summit on my 68th birthday so I don’t want to get behind this early in my hike by taking a zero because of rain. I guess that I will get ahead of this hiker bubble this way. I’m sure that there are plenty more hiker bubbles up ahead. 
My next stop will be the NOC in 3 days and a wake up. I should get there after a full hiking day so I’ll get a room. After that it’s 1 day and a wake up to Fontana Dam. I will stay a night in the lodge and pick up my 3rd resupply box. Then I will get to hike in the Great Smoky Mountains!  Hopefully I will have better weather this year.

21.1 miles to Beech Gap
One of the topics of discussion at the hostel last night was the severe weather blowing in on Thursday. Flash floods and severe thunderstorms were forecast for all day Thursday and ending around 5am Friday morning. Most of the hikers were going into Hiawasse for a weather zero. 
I decided to hike out and hope for the best. I was motivated by the old AT thru hiker adage “no rain no Maine”. I have a pretty good rain system so I wasn’t too worried about getting wet. I figured that If the weather got really bad I could take shelter in my tent or one of the 3 shelters. My goal was to make it 20 miles to Beech Gap. 
I checked the weather channel radar one last time at 7am  and it looked like the worst of the weather was northwest of me. The hourly forecast was still foreboding but it could always change for the better. 
I hiked back to the trail head with just enough rain to put up my umbrella. This morning reminded me of 2019 when I started at this trailhead in the rain. The temperature was as in the 30s then and some of the rain was sleet  
I started hiking just before 8am. After 30 minutes the light rain actually stopped. I didn’t want to jinx myself by taking the umbrella down too soon. 
I caught up with another older hiker that left the hostel before I did. We were both feeling pretty good about our decision to hike today. 
The rain held off until I got on the windward side of the mountain and then strong gusts would blow rain on me from far away. The gusty winds would cool you off after heating up climbing a steep grade in rain gear. 
My rain gear consists of a Enlightened Equipment rain jacket with the pit zips open unless the rain is blowing sideways. Over that I have a Zpacks rain poncho that covers my pack. The poncho has large arm openings which helps keep me from overheating. I wear my hiking shorts with a rain kilt (skirt) to keep my shorts dry. I don’t want to get my hiking pants wet. I top it off with a hiking umbrella that I attach to my pack with a Gossamer Gear umbrella clamp. 
I passed by the first shelter and all of the tent sites were taken. I didn’t bother checking the shelter because the weather was nice. 
Just around 12:30 I heard the first thunder and it started to rain. I was close to Muscrat shelter and I wanted a dry place to get water and mix up my lunch concoction. 
As I approached the shelter area I saw tent city first.  No chance getting a tent site here even if I wanted to. The shelter was packed with hikers. I told the shelter dwellers that I was only stopping for water so they wouldn’t think that I was going to try to cram myself in with them. Within one minute the thunderstorm was over our heads and it was pouring rain.   A nice young hiker gave me enough of his water to get me through the day. 
I had no choice but to hike out in the pouring rain. 
I was climbing up the mountain and thunder was booming but it didn’t seem to close. Just before the top the thunder was overhead. I figured my only choice was to run up the rest of the climb so I could descend to a safer place. 
This is when I saw a flash just ahead of me followed by a boom. I ran as fast as I could to get the heck out of there.  This happened multiple time up on the ridge  
Unfortunately instead of descending after I got to the top I had to follow a ridge with only a slight loss of elevation. Thunder was still booming nearby and overhead. I continued to run where I could and hike my fastest in sketchy rocky areas. 
I kept shouting “Lightning, Go On Git”.  (From a Jimmy Fallon bit). 
Just when I would think that the storm passed thunder would boom again. I would climb up to another ridge and be terrified again. The windward side winds were now cold and I had to zip up my rain jacket to keep my body warm. I was still dry underneath my layers. 
I got to Deep Gap and saw 6 hikers. They all had been through the same near death experiences as I had. The applauded me as I came out of the woods. They were all waiting for shuttles into Franklin to get out of the weather. I was very tempted to go along with them but it was only 2:30 and it seemed like the thunderstorm had passed so I bid them “Happy Trails” and hiked on. Standing Indian shelter was only 1 mile away and I was hoping that it would be vacant or tent sites would be available. 
Well the tent sites were pools of water and a group of guys out for a long weekend hike filled up the shelter. They had parked their keep at the gap and only hiked 1 mile. If not for them I would have had the shelter to myself. 
A song that popped up in my head was “I feel the earth move under my feet “ because the dirt was so saturated that no matter how carefully you stepped you could feel the dirt/mud slide. The worst places are big step downs where there aren’t any roots or rocks to use for steps. I had a nice butt slide because the trail gave way. 
So I hiked out again to my goal campsite at Beech Gap about another 4.5 miles. The thunder had moved on and only made an occasional appearance. 
The rain stopped when I was about 30 minutes from camp. I picked up the pace in the hopes that I could get my tent set up and get water before it started again. 
I was in luck. There were two tents already set up so I went in search of a campsite that wouldn’t have pooling water. I picked a site that had leaves on the ground to help prevent heavy rain from splashing up into my tent. 
I went in search of the stream to get water. I followed some pink ribbons that I thought might be marking the trail to water. I found a drainage followed it until I found a good flow. After getting water I started to head back to camp but didn’t see any of the ribbons. Luckily I had my Guthook GPS app and was able to get turned around in the right direction. 
I got back to camp minutes before the rain started up. A thunderstorm started at 6pm and it’s still booming as I write this at 8:30. 
The foot of my tent is in a low spot and a little water is pooling beneath it. It drains pretty fast after the torrential downpours stop. 
It’s 11pm and I woke up to quiet skies and no rain. I don’t know how long it will last but it was good for getting out of the tent and checking the guy lines. I checked out my feet and I have a nasty looking blister on my left pinky toe. ILightning and periodic torrential downpours continued well past midnight. I got up during a break and tied my Ursak food bag off to a tree.","Dick’s Creek Gap and Hostel Around the Bend

I set my bird alarm for 6:10. I knew that it would take me more time to get ready when I have to deal with wet gear. 
The weather was perfect AT hiking weather. Other than the climb up Albert Mountain the trail was fairly easy with long ridge walks. 
I got to Silver Bald at 5:30 and there were slim pickens of tent sites. I scouted the for a secluded spot but no luck. 
I wouldn’t recommend this campsite  It’s a long hike down to the shelter which means a long hike back up  Of course the next camp is about 4.5 miles away so your choices are limited unless you know of stealth spots

23.3 miles to the NOC (+ 0.5 bonus miles from Silver Bald campsites back uphill to the AT)

My post from yesterday was very brief so I’m going to elaborate on how I dealt with the many challenges of tenting during Thursdays torrential rainstorm.  It rained so hard that I couldn’t even hear my mp3 (with headphones) because of the force of the rain hitting the outside of the tent.  As my wife can tell you I am no fan of tenting in the rain or during a hail storm.  During the first hail storm that we encountered on the John Muir Trail I was sure that our MSR Hubba Hubba tent was going to be ripped to shreds and we were going to die from hypothermia.  In the Sierra you don’t have the option of hiking less than 10 miles to a parking area where you can get shuttled into town.  I also spend the first hour of a rain storm expecting the worse and continually check the edges of the tent to check for leakage.

I’m glad that it didn’t rain last night at the Silver Bald Shelter campsite because my tent site was so slanted that I spent the night with my sleeping pad pushing against the foot of my tent.  The Zpacks Duplex sheds rain outside of the bathroom floor with no problem unless you press against the bathtub floor and push it out past the top of the tent, then the water pours in.

When I got to camp yesterday I had to dry out my tent, rain gear and Ursak (grizzly bear resistant bag) food bag.  Fortunately my  cuben fiber tent and rain poncho don’t hold water like silnylon equipment and they dry quickly.  
Thursday night I slept with my Ursak food bag until I woke up to silence around 1am.  The Beech Creek area has known bear activity so I put a plastic bag over the Ursak and tied it off to a tree.  Not long after I got back into my tent it started pouring rain again.  In the morning I retrieved my food bag and found out that the plastic bag was a failure because you have to cut a hole in the bag to pass the Ursak’s lines through to tie it off to a tree.

I was also disappointed with the seepage of water I had in the bathtub floor of my Zpacks Duplex tent.  I had selected a tent site that appeared to have good drainage because there wasn’t any sign of pooling water from the 5 hours of torrential rain the site already had.  But from 6pm to well past midnight periods of torrential rain would pass through the area and last for up to an hour before it would let up for 30 minutes.  During this time I had minor pooling of maybe a shoelace depth form under the foot of my tent.  The bottom of the tent got wet enough to get anything I had placed in that area wet. The water didn’t pool inside the tent, the wetness was more like the condensation you might get inside a poorly ventilated tent. I can understand the bottom of the tent leaking water if I was set up in a pool of water but not with the insignificant amount of water that was under the tent.  My Tarptent Notch has performed better in worse conditions and it has a silnylon floor.  One night during a wild and crazy Sierra thunderstorm I was camped by the lower Palisade Lake.  I woke up after the storm passed to find a small stream running just outside the vestibule of my Notch.  I placed my flip flops in the water and they started to float away in the current. Luckily I had my tent placed on a small patch of sand that was just high enough to keep me out of the stream that was flowing down the mountainside. 
 I placed my rain poncho and sit pad (I made from 4 folds of an old Z-lite pad) across the bottom section of my tent and under my inflatable pad.  I placed all of my stuff in the trash compactor bag that I use to blow up my air mattress and placed my other compactor bag over the foot of my sleeping bag to keep it dry in case I slipped off my sleeping pad in the middle of the night.  Wet tent floors are one of many reasons why it is a good idea to have an inflatable sleeping pad instead of one of the foldable foam pads because it keeps your bag higher off the wetness.

I woke up Friday morning thankful for surviving the lightning and rain and grateful that my sleeping bag, puffy and night clothes were dry.  
At my Silver Bald tent site I discovered that a lot of my food was soaked.  I used an Opsak (thick plastic bag) to line my Ursak food bag and it had water pooled in the bottom of it.  I organize all of my food for each day into a gallon plastic Ziploc type bag.  The only bags that didn’t have water soaked trough were the heavy duty freezer bags.  My oatmeal and hot chocolate packages were soaked on the outside.

At Silver Bald a young woman from San Diego was complaining about condensation inside her tent.  I don’t know what brand of tent it was but it was the most ridiculous tent I’ve ever seen.  It didn’t have any mesh lined opening.  Even the entry way didn’t have a bug mesh window.  No wonder she had constant condensation problems. A man pitched nearby had a Big Agnes Copper Spur that I recommended she look at.  
My sleep Friday night was interrupted by a hiker in a nearby tent that had a habit of snoring.  Not his fault but I’m a light sleeper and wake up easily.  Just another reason to avoid crowded campsites. 
I woke up early Saturday morning because I wanted to leave just as the there was enough light to keep me from tripping while hiking up the trail.  I felt refreshed and ready to go hiking.  I knew that this was going to be a spectacular hiking day because the Wood Thrush were out singing for the first time this trip.  They have a beautiful song and I loved to wake up to their melodies during my 2019 hike.  In New England they would start singing about 30 minutes before sunrise.  My hiking partner and I had an agreement to get up at the first bird song. 
The bonus 0.5 mile hike back up to the AT should have been annoying but the songs of the Wood Thrush and Robins made the time pass quickly.  
I had 23.3 miles to hike to the NOC today.  I estimated that I would get there between 4:30 and 5pm.  More thunderstorms were forecasted for the late morning into the midafternoon.  I didn’t want to get stuck up on the balds or ridges during a lightning storm so I kept a steady pace. 
There was a long climb up to Wayah Bald but it was well graded with switchbacks.  I got up to Wayah Bald around noon.  The good news was it still hadn’t rained and I was able to dump a bunch of food that I wasn’t going to need in the trash.  The bad news was the bald was in the clouds and I didn’t have any views.  
I then had a long descent and several climbs and descents until I got to Tellico Gap.  Sometime between Wayah Bald and Tellico Gap a light rain started and a few bouts of thunder could be heard in the distance.  Very brief period of rain would continue off and on throughout the afternoon but thankfully the thunderstorms moved out of the area.  I arrived at Tellico Gap around 2 pm and noticed an awning set up with trail magic going on.  I had my hopes up for a caffeinated sugary soft drink and maybe and moon pie like I got from Miss Janet.  Unfortunately a hoard of hikers were ahead of me and all that they had left were diet cokes and beer.  Once again I was foiled by the huge number of hikers out enjoying the AT this year. 
I was lucky enough to stop for water at a magical stream.  The environment looked like it was created by an artist for a Fairyland landscape painting.  As you can see from today’s picture there is a little Pixie’s house set into a tree.  I appreciate the imaginative hiker that helped add a little mystique to this special place.

The trail continued the pattern of long gradual climbs and descents until I got to Wesser Bald.  I was treated to some great views here.  I passed the Wesser Bald shelter and camping area at 2:30 and all of the choice tent sites were already taken.  I couldn’t believe that people would stop hiking so early on such a beautiful day.  No wonder I can’t find a decent tent site after hiking a long day.

I remembered from 2019 that the trail to the NOC will soon be mostly downhill with a few minor climbs.  I stopped to talk with a young through hiker and we discussed the crowded trail.  He thought that shelters should be reserved for thru hikers.  I told him that I disagree because thru hikers may think we are special but everyone had the right to come out and enjoy nature and this beautiful trail whether they are day hikers, out for a long weekend or sections hikers.  After all the AT was not built for the exclusive use of thru hikers.  It might suck not to get good tent sites but that’s the AT.

The Rufus Shelter is about a mile from the NOC.  I didn’t stop to check out the shelter but the area around it was a wet mucky mess.  There were already several hammock campers set up.  I’m not sure because I didn’t thoroughly investigate the area but it didn’t look like a good place to set up a tent during or after a storm. Hammocks seem like the way to go on this crowded section of the AT.  You can pick up some water at a stream and then find a nice place to stealth camp away from the crowds.

I got to the NOC at 4:38.  I was pleased with my time estimate.  I would have made it at 4:30 if I hadn’t have stopped to chat with several hikers along the way.  
When I got to the trailhead I saw the beautiful site of my wife walking across the street to give me a big hug and kiss.  She said that I didn’t smell that bad.

I decided to call her on Friday and asked her to drive the 5.5 hours to the NOC to pick me up.  After a week of crowded campsites I decided to call it quits.  This wasn’t the AT experience that I signed up for.  I started my hike on 17 February In 2019 and never had to deal with the crowds.  The campsites and hostels were never crowded in 2019.  Even when I got up to New England and the spring temperatures brought out more hikers to explore their beautiful mountains I didn’t have these types of crowds.

With the exception of the 3 hours of terror that I spent hiking on ridges during Thursdays extreme lightning storm, I enjoyed and celebrated every step of the trail that I was privileged to take on the trail. I woke up each day feeling refreshed and ready to experience new adventures.  My 67 year old body felt stronger than it did in 2019.  
I love to hike long miles in the mountains. I don’t really hike fast, I average 2.5 mph which includes hiking up and downhill and breaks.  I just start hiking early and stop hiking late.  I take short breaks about every 2 hours and eat while I’m hiking.  I enjoy experiencing the forest as much (or more) as I do views from the overlooks.   
I started out this years journal with a prehike entry that said “If not now, when”.  Well I guess the when will be never.  I only have about 350 miles left to finish my 2019 hike.  I might still complete those miles this June but I doubt it.  My goal for the AT was to complete the trail as a thru hike, not a section hike.  Not that there is anything wrong with section hiking the AT but just finishing the trail wasn’t my goal. 
I guess I’ll have to wait to earn the designation “Thru Hiker” until next year when I attempt to thru hike the PCT with my wife.  We head out west this August to hike about 600 miles of the PCT southbound from Sierra City to Kennedy Meadows South or further if we want to.  We have family that live close by the famous McDonalds at Cajon pass so maybe we will just keep hiking.   We’ve never hiked the area from Sierra City to Tuolumne Meadows.  We also have never hiked the Sierra in September.  
It was a pleasure sharing my hike with you.  
Happy Trails

Silver Streak,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637934,"I’m heading back to the AT to finish my 2019 thru hike attempt. I had to get off trail in June 2019 due to a severely fractured pinky finger. Yes (all you hardcore macho hikers) you do need your hands to hike the mountains of New Hampshire and Maine. I tried hiking 3 days in the White Mountains, with what I hoped was just a bad sprain, and it was not pleasant scrambling up slabs and grabbing trees and roots to help maintain balance on the slippery downhills. 
Some of you may know that I started out in March to hike the entire trail so that I could earn the designation of long trail thru hiker as opposed to thru hiking a shorter trail like the JMT. I was feeling strong and having a great time hiking through the beautiful Georgia and North Carolina forests. However, I found the campsites too crowded by the time I showed up to pitch my tent. I was going to be headed into the Smokies during spring break and didn’t want to deal with anyone tent cities so I had my wife pick me up at the NOC after 7 days on the trail. 
Once I got home my mind started drifting back to the trail. The fact that I still had 360 miles of the trail to finish was always there prodding me to get back up to New Hampshire and finish the trail. It’s no fun to say that you have hiked 1846 miles of the AT but didn’t finish due to an injury. So I made the commitment to figure out a way to get back to the trail and finish the AT. I might not be an AT thru hiker but hopefully I will have finished it. 
I’m extremely fortunate to have a hiking buddy (Scarlet) that lives in New Hampshire. We met Scarlet (trail name) in 2014 while we were doing our first JMT thru hike. We hiked with her most of the trail and my wife kept in touch with her. She joined us for park of our 2017 Sierra snowfest which was a choose your own route type of adventure filled with type 2 fun. She is picking me up from the airport and putting me up for a night at her home. She has a lot of experience hiking in the White Mountains and her advice so far has been invaluable. 
She is going to hike with me on my first day/night. Our plan is to hike up to the Mizpah Hut campsite. It’s about a 6.5 mile hike but it is up a very steep grade with lots of rock climbing/scrambling involved. There’s supposed to be a 4 hour period of rain that will make the trail slippery and hazardous.

6.4 miles to Mizpah Hut campsite 
AT mile 1847 is at the Route 302 trailhead in Crawford Notch This is where I ended my 2019 thru hike attempt due to a fractured pinky. Yes I value the function of my fingers more than a hike. 
Scarlet parked her car at the trailhead parking lot. We started hiking up the Webster Cliffs trail around 9:45.
 Our goal for the day was to hike safely up the challenging Webster Cliffs trail to the Mizpah Hut campsite 6.4 miles up a trail that wasn’t designed for backpacking. A good portion of the trail required the use of all 4 limbs to scramble up and around steep granite slabs and huge boulders. The decents required slow careful foot placements and occasional butt skidding down steep slippery slabs until you could touch the trail with your foot. The poor trees next to the trail were used to help pull me up a huge step up or to provide security against falling on the slippery wet granite on the descents. Scarlet had a frightening fall when she slipped trying to scale a ridiculous section and ended up sliding 10 feet down the slab and going over the edge free falling 4 feet onto the trail. It was a miracle that she didn’t break any bones. She just wiped the muck off and attacked the slab again. 
Luckily most of the hike was in the forest which did an amazing job of sheltering us from the 40+ mph winds we encountered in the exposed sections.  We were only exposed to the wind at view points. I got blown off balance multiple times at these view points when a strong gust of wind hit me. 
We were fortunate because the 3 hours of rain that was forecast ended up being brief periods of light wind blown rain. We were in the clouds the entire day. 
We got to the hut around 4:30 pm. It took us almost 7 hours to hike 6.4 miles. Once we got over Webster Mountain the trail was less treacherous and we were able to hike a little faster. 
The hut was open for hikers to get water and use the restrooms. The campsite had nice large wooden platforms for tenting. A large microburst storm hit the campsite several years ago and there’s still evidence of the damage to the trees. It also has food lockers and a privy. 
Today was a very stressful tiring day.  Welcome to hiking in the Presidential Range!

14.8 miles to the Osgood campsite. 
I didn’t sleep well last night. The temperature got down to the upper 20s and my sleeping system didn’t keep me toasty warm. We had to pitch our tents on a wooden platform and I think that cold wind was blowing up through the slats and making me cold on the bottom. I guess that I should have brought my xtherm pad. 
I got up around 4:45 with the first light, excited to hike the Presidential Range.  The trail either passes over the summit or passes near the summit of several mountains named for presidents. 
I left camp around 6:15 and headed out looking forward to the summit of Mt Washington which was about 6 miles away. The hike involved the typical climbs and descents made difficult by the huge boulders in your way. I had to use my micro spikes in two places that had a steep slope covered with hard snow or ice. The flatter sections were made challenging because of swampy mucky trail that I had to concentrate on to keep my feet dry. 
I made it up to Mt Washington around 10:30 and I was the only person at the summit sign. During the busy season you might have to wait for 30 minutes for your turn to get your picture taken. Mt Washington is known for extreme weather and I was fortunate to have clear blue skies and light winds of 10 to 15 mph. There tourist shop had opened recently and I hung out in there for about an hour. 
I left at 11:40 and was treated to a trail that consisted of huge boulders that I had to hop from one to another. Once I got out of the boulder field the trail went back to its normal smaller sized bout. I encountered many section of trail that were covered with snow and ice. The danger of this is if your legs plunge through the snow down into hidden rocks and streams. Some hikers have broken bones postholimg. I tested the firmness of the snow with my trekking poles to avoid postholing. My leg did plunge through the snow into ice cold water once. 
There is a snow field that I was concerned about that leads down a steep ravine into a boulder field. I’ve seen video and heard stories about this section. I wasn’t too worried because I had my spikes in case the snow was icy. The snow was soft when I got there and I was able to kick in stable platforms for my feet. Reminded me of the Sierra. 
The vistas made all of the hard work worthwhile. The best views of Mt Washington are north of the mountain. You see magestic Washington and the steep ravine that plunges into a valley. 
I talked with many day hikers who were out hiking the Prezies. I also talked with a couple of guys carrying their ski equipment. They showed me the crazy steep ravine they skied down. 
The hardest part of my hike was at the end of the day. I had about 3 miles of hellish trail. First came a very steep climb up Mt Madison that involved using my hands and bear crawling.. 
Once over the top I had to descend 1 mile to tree line that was horrible. I was constantly taking huge steps down from one boulder to the next. This might be fun with a day pack but the weight of a 25 pound backpack results in a lot of jarring pressure that is absorbed by my feet, knees, and back. I had to go slowly to pick my way down so that I wouldn’t trip and fall on my face. It took at least an hour to cover a mile. Once below tree line things improved but it still was slow going because of all the rocks and roots. 
I finally made it to the Osgood campsite and had to set up my tent on another platform. Hopefully it will be warmer tonight. I had the area to myself. 
I’m beyond tired. Hiking the rugged trails of the White Mountains isn’t for couch potatoes.

18.7 AT miles (.3 bonus miles to camp) miles to the Imp campsite 
The birds woke me up at 4:30. I left camp around 5:50. 
I stopped at the Pinkham Notch visitor center to refill my water and buy a Turkey sandwich. Yummy. 
The first challenge of the day was the climb up Wildcat D. It had to be the longest and most strenuous climb yet. I put my trekking poles away and spent most of the climb bear crawling from boulder to boulder. It may have been tough but the trail looked like a trail should, not the awful mess that I had to deal with yesterday. I had a better feeling of what was to come because of the Wildcats trail. Not that there wasn’t scary sections but overall I felt like I was back on the horse steps found in the Sierra. 
I climbed up the other Wildcat, Carter Dome, and 3 other Carter Mountains.
 Carter Dome was almost as tough as the first Wildcat Mountain. Once I summits Carter the trail got amazingly easy. Easy until the countless icy snow fields appeared. I picked my way through the snow by stepping into boot tracks left by lucky fella that showed me where not to step to avoid postholing. I did posthole one up to my knee and my foot got soaked in the cold stream flowing under the snow. Luckily most of the snow patches were in relatively flat sections and not steep climbs or decents. 
After I passed the summit of the last mountain of the day (North Carter) I started the decent from hell. I spent most of the time butt scooting down slick wet granite slabs. My shorts were wet and filthy. I basically eased myself slowly down until I could gain a foothold in a small crack. Not fun and very nerve wracking. 
I had to hike another.3 miles to the Imp campsite. I would have stayed in the shelter but two women were already there. All day I saw only one other hiker going the opposite direction and then I find the shelter occupied. I had to pitch my tent on a platform and there wasn’t enough places to tie my tent down so it wouldn’t blow away in the gusty winds we had. I didn’t use a big enough rock to secure on of my guylines and tent occasionally blew in on my head.

Major wind gusts last night. The birds got up late and didn’t wake me up until 5am. 
I climbed only one mountain today, Mt Moriah. The trail up to Moriah was a dream. Most of the trail was on long granite slabs with reasonable inclines. 
The climb down the other side was nerve wracking because of the fairly steep slope combined with wet slippery rocks. It took more effort descending than climbing the mountain. It wasn’t a dangerous as yesterday. 
With about 2.5 miles to the trail became a beautiful trail groomed for tourists. 
My attempt to rock hop across the Rattle River was a big fall. The rocks I chose were as slick as ice. I feel forward and got my feet wet. I took the opportunity to clean the blood off from the numerous scrapes and gouges that the White Mountains inflicted. 
I’m staying at the famous Libby House in Gorham. The house is very old so I asked if it was haunted. The only showed me a paranormal investigation show that featured the house. I guess that I might have a visitor tonight. 
I leave at 6 am to get back on thy trail tomorrow. I should be in Maine!

17.6 miles to Carlo Col Shelter
I had a great night sleep at the Libby House. The resident ghosts left me alone. 
Paul dropped me off at the trailhead at 6:15. You have to do a short road walk and then the trail heads back into the woods. The mosquitoes came out and I had to stop and put on Picardin repellent. 20 minutes later the mosquitoes were gone. 
The trail starts off with pretty easy climbs and fairly smooth trail. After such an easy start I had great expectations for my days mileage. An hour and several grueling climbs later I reevaluated my goal for the day. 
The trail actually resembled North Carolina AT trails (the hardest ones) for most of the day.
Most of the hike involved long fairly steep climbs that slowed me down to a turtle’s pace. I couldn’t make up time on the descents because of all the lrocks and roots scattered across the trail demand slow careful foot placement. 
The trail maintenance volunteers haven’t been out yet to clear out the blown down trees. The most dangerous trees are the ones that fell down and got stuck at head level. It takes so much concentration to watch the trail for trip hazards that I seldom look up to see what’s at eye level. Today I got knocked down by trees 3 times in the space of 5 minutes because I walked head on into a blowdown tree. I was lucky that I didn’t get knocked out or get a concussion. 
I was very happy to finally get out of New Hampshire and enter Maine. Maine didn’t take long to let me know that New Hampshire has nothing over Maine in terms of crazy extremely dangerous trail. Within less than ½ mile I has staring down a jumble of truck sized rectangular granite blocks arranged haphazardly. I checked my navigation app to confirm that I this mess was part of the trail. I basically had to use rock climbing skills to wedge my body between two slabs and ease myself down. Just another of many times that I look down and say “You freakin got to be kidding”. 
I got to the campsite at 5pm which is nice because I could do all of my camp chores at my leisure. I’m alone at the campsite this evening and decided to sleep in the shelter.  It provides shelter from the wind and is much warmer than being in my tent on a windy night with sub freezing temperatures.

17 miles to Baldplate Lean to 
I knew that I had a big day today so I wanted to get up with the birds. They did their job and woke me up at 4:15. I was hiking out of camp at 5:30. 
The trail started off on a climb up to a ridge that would eventually take me up and over a mountain. Up on the exposed parts of the ridges the wind was howling and the temperature was below freezing. Many of the alpine boggy areas had frozen water. The views were spectacular. I could see many of the mountain ranges that I had passed over. 
The main event for today was the Mahoosuc Notch and Arm. The Notch is advertised as either the hardest or most fun mile on the trail. It is a labyrinth of truck sized boulders randomly positioned by hiker hating aliens. You have to navigate over, around or under the geological mess for one mile. The trail was made harder and downright frightening for me because the first half mile was filled with snow and ice. Luckily I had microspikes with me or I wouldn’t have had the courage to continue. A special hazard with the snow was the possibility of postholing into a huge void between the boulders. Some of the pits are deeper than most humans are tall. If I postholed into one of these areas I probably would have got stuck and they would have found my body in July. Some of the boulders make little tunnels that you have to pass through. I had to take my pack off 4 times to squeeze through the crevices. It also wasn’t marked by the white blazes very well. I knew the general direction to go but there were multiple options of which huge boulder to climb. I frequently chose the wrong one and got on top to find that there was no safe way down so I would have to climb back down into the icy mess and try a different route. It took me 1 hour and 45 minutes to pass through this 1 mile section. I didn’t think this section was fun or that hard. It took me so long because of the poor markings and I had to periodically stop to put on or take off my spikes. I lost my warm gloves in this section. I didn’t think this section was fun or that hard. I’m sure it would have been fun if I was with other hikers and it was ice free. 
Next came the Mahoosac Arm which is 1 mile of the steepest grade on the AT. I misread my guide and thought that the start of the climb was a half mile up the trail so I got really grumpy as I climbed the steep trail while thinking that the steep section was still to come. It took me more than an hour to complete it. 
I felt really good having survived the hardest 2 miles that Maine can throw at me. I know that the hiking will still be hard but not Mahoosuc hard. 
The rest of the day was spent hiking around a mountain lake, over Mt Speck, descending to Grafton Notch and then hiking back up another mountain to a campsite. 
I arrived at camp at 6pm which ended a grueling 12.5 hour day of hiking. 
I’m sleeping alone in the shelter. It’s not as warm as last nights shelter because this one only has 3 walls. Another AT hiker is here camping in his hammock.","Carlo Col Shelter

18 miles to South Arm Road trailhead 
The lazy birds slept in and didn’t wake me up. Luckily I set the bird alarm on my phone for 4:45. I got to sleep in an extra half hour. 
I wanted to get an early start so that I could make it to The Cabin hostel for dinner. I called them yesterday from a mountain to let them know that I would get there today and Honey (a long time icon of the trail) told me that she would make some lasagna and apple pie for dinner. 
The morning started with a long steep climb up to Baldpate Mountain. The climb was worth it. There weren’t any vistas because the strong cold winds were blowing clouds up and over the ridge. Just being able to experience the beautiful alpine environment with the majestic granite domes, stunted alpine plants and lichens was well worth the energy it took to climb up. The trail conditions were almost perfect and the trail followed the ridge through the alpine area for a long time. 
This was the best day of hiking I had for the week I’ve been on trail. However, of all the crazy rock and boulders I’ve stepped during the week, all  it took was to step wrong on a small inconspicuous rock on a beautiful trail that almost did me in. I stepped on a rock and my shoe slid just enough to twist my ankle and my knee. My ankle felt fine but my knee hurt and started getting stiff. The pain eventually went away but my knee stayed stiff the entire day. I’ve been fortunate to never have knee issues before so I hope that it works itself out. 
My final climb of the day was up Moody Mountain. The climb was described as a one mile rugged steep climb. The climb was made harder because of several spots where huge trees blew down and obscured all evidence of the trail. I would stop and look up the mountain in multiple directions for white blazes. When I couldn’t see a blaze I would just pick a direction and climb up until my chosen path became so ridiculous that it must be wrong. I would back track and try again. Finally I would have to resort to using my navigation app to find the trail. Usually I would have to bushwhack through vegetation and loose soil to regain the trail. Definitely not what I needed for my last climb with lasagna waiting for me. 
I called the hostel from the top of the mountain to let them know that I was on my way down. Don was waiting for me at the trailhead. 
The family style dinner didn’t disappoint. Honey and her son Don were very welcoming and shared some great stories.

Silver Streak,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638261,"I took 2 zero days at “The Cabin”,  a hiker hostel near Andover. I wanted to avoid the cold rain that showed up yesterday afternoon.  The rain will continue on into tonight. If I was thru hiking I would have just kept hiking because “No Rain No Maine”. Well I’m in Maine so that old hiker adage is mute. I’m also not in a hurry so I figured why get hypothermic if I don’t have to. 
I had to take one zero to rest up from the 100 miles, 7 days excursion that took me through the famous Presidential Range, Wildcats, Carters, Mahoosuc Notch and Arm, Baldpate mountains into Andover. 
The Cabin is the perfect place to take a double zero. Honey, the owner is a very friendly, welcoming and delightful woman. I’ve enjoyed the family style sit down breakfast and dinners that she serves.
 She loves the rugged mountains of New Hampshire and Maine. She started hiking when she was 2 years old looking for the “soft rock” that her mother told her to find. At 88 she still enjoys hiking. She showed me picture albums of her family celebrating her 84th and 85th birthday in the White Mountains. 
Honey is a historian of the AT. She has known and been friends with many of the icons of the AT. One of her AT buddies was Earl Shaffer who was the first person to hike the entire AT. Her brother is responsible for making hikers go through the Mahoosuc Notch and then the Arm. 
I’ve 100 miles and have 245 miles to Katahdin. I leave at 6am tomorrow to get back on the trail. Warmer weather is coming and along with the warmth the bugs will come out. An equipment note; My BeFree water filter only had about 3 weeks of use and it’s already clogged and slow flowing. The BeFree work great until they don’t. I tried their swishing and shake cleaning methods which seemed to make things worse. Luckily I brought my Sawyer Squeeze along for a backup. I would be out of luck with out my Sawyer because there is only one store still open in Andover and it’s not equipped with hiker supplies except for food. My Osprey Exos has worked great. I’m so glad that I chose it over my Arc Haul even if it weighs an extra 1.5 pounds

Honey dropped me off at the South Arm trailhead at 6:39. 
It felt great to get back on the trail. I started off with a long climb up Big Blue mountain. The grade wasn’t too taxing but the terrain was filled with rocks, roots, streams, and mucky bogs. The trail was wet from the last 2 days of rain. It was very tedious having to carefully place your feet in a dry safe spot for hours. On a normal trail with such an easy grade I could have been moving much faster. There were metal rungs installed on several steep granite slabs to keep hikers from slipping. 
The next mountain was Bemis Mountain. The climb up to it was fairly easy and the trail spent a lot of time on a ridge with dry granite slabs that allowed for fast hiking. The views from Bemis were outstanding. 
The descent from Bemis was terrible. The granite on this side seemed to be much more slippery than the other side. There were many steep granite slabs to negotiate. I always try find a safe path along the edges of the slabs. If it looks really slippery I get down on my butt and ease myself down. 
Even though I was treading carefully I still slipped numerous times because of hidden slippery roots or rocks. 
I happened to break both of my trekking poles within 30 minutes of each other during this decent. Luckily there is still enough usable pole sections so that I can still use them. 
After finally getting down from Bemis I followed the trail up and down several rollers that gave me some great views of the surrounding mountains and lakes. 
I had to ford a river that didn’t have any safe way to rock hop across so I had to get my shoes wet. I’d rather just walk through the water then risk slipping off a slippery rock. 
I’m camping in my tent even though the shelter is empty because I figured that the bugs would be annoying. 
The pond by the campsite is very pretty  I sat on a log next to the pond while I ate dinner. I could see fish breaking the surface of the water. 
An owl has been hooting several times tonight.

20.1 miles to Poplar Ridge Lean-to
I left camp at 6am excited to get to the Saddleback and Horn mountains because there was supposed to be a long alpine ridge walk. I had a big 20 mile day planned. 
The first 11 miles of the day were easier than I expected. The trail was so nice that it reminded me of a typical trail found in the southeast. There weren’t too many rocks and roots to mess up my hiking rhythm. 
I noticed that the forest was different today. Thus far Maine’s forest looked and smelled like Christmas trees and the forest floor was covered with thick mats of moss. Today the forest had a mixture of conifers and the ground was covered in dead leaves with patches of ferns scattered about. The wildflowers are blooming and today I saw scores of various types of butterflies. 
That all changed after about 11 miles and the trail reverted back to a Maine trail full of rocks, roots, wet granite slabs, mucky bogs, and streams flowing down the trail. 
The hike up to Saddleback was long and steep. The summit always seemed to be just over the next rise but it wasn’t. Once I got to the summit the views made me forget the hard leg burning effort that was needed to get up there. It was a beautiful sunny day with just the right amount of wind to cool you off. 
Next up was the mountain called the Horn. I could see it in the distance from the top of Saddleback several miles away. Before I could climb the Horn I would have to descend Saddleback. OMG what a terrifying descent. I found myself just shaking my head in disbelief as I stared down a super steep section of huge smooth boulders jumbled around. Imagine going to a tall building and looking out the window toward the ground that’s how steep it was. I guess that hundreds of hikers of all ages successfully down climb these ledges but I think that it’s ludicrous to make hikers with heavy packs risk life or limb. There also were plenty of moderately steep granite slabs made wet by spring water running down them. I spent a good portion of my time on my butt carefully sliding down to my next foothold. 
The Horn had similar views as Saddleback. After the Horn came Saddleback Junior. Once again the descent of the Horn was slow going and dangerous. The climb up Saddleback Junior was very strenuous particularly because it came at the end of my 20 mile day. 
I got to camp at 5:30. The campsite doesn’t have any good tent sites so I did the unthinkable, I pitched my tent in the shelter. There were too many mosquitoes and gnats to sleep exposed in the shelter. I figured that my odds were good that no one else would show up. If they did I would take down my tent.

14.3 miles to Crocker Cirque campsite 
I was glad that I set up my tent in the shelter last night because it rained. It’s annoying to have to pack up a wet tent. 
I woke up at 5am and it was still raining. I wasn’t in too much of a hurry to get going because it was supposed to stop raining at 6am. 
Last night I discovered that the heel sole was separating from my Altra Lone Peak shoes. The toe areas are also getting holes. I was hoping that they would make it to Monson which has an outfitter and marks 100 miles to go. The shoes only made it 150 miles but those were insanely rugged miles. 
So I ordered a pair of shoes online and paid for overnight delivery. I hope that they arrive at the hostel I’m going to stay at tomorrow. 
Today’s plan was to hike a mere 14 miles to set me up for an easy 8 mile day to the road where I will get picked up by folks from The Hostel of Maine. I will take a NERO day and pick up a food resupply box. 
The rain made the rocks and roots more slippery than usual. My first 20 minutes of hiking downhill consisted of slow careful foot placement and butt slides when the slabs were steep.  For awhile I was getting frustrated at the slow pace because I could never make it 14 miles going this slow. 
I was happy when the trail mellowed out and the hiking became enjoyable. I was trekking for miles through lush forests with fields of ferns and wildflowers. It looked like great moose habitat but all that I saw were tracks in the mud and poop. 
I came to the first of two rivers that I would have to wade across. Half of an aluminum fishing boat was stuck in the rocks about 5 feet above where the current water level was. During river crossings I leave my trail shoes on for better traction and foot protection. 
The trail spent a long time within a drainage that included waterfalls and gushing streams. 
The four miles between Mt Abraham and Sugarloaf Mountain was an obstacle course of blown down trees. I spent a lot of time climbing over, crawling under, or bushwhacking around trees that were blocking the trail. I kept reminding myself that this was infinitely better than dealing with wet slabs. 
I passed the 200 mile to Katahdin point. The climbs up the mountains weren’t too bad. The trail was wet and rocky but I will take wet and rocky over wet granite slabs any day. 
I was feeling like this might be the first day that the trail wasn’t out to kill me, but then the last descent of the day had to ruin it for me. There weren’t too many granite slabs but there were huge boulders to navigate around and down on the steep descent. 
I got to camp around 4pm and have the place to myself. It is nice being able lounge around camp and complete camp chores at a leisurely pace. Of course I rather hike more hours and miles.

The birds woke me up at 4:15 this morning. I was wanting to sleep in because I only had about 8 miles to the trailhead where I was going to get picked up by The Hostel of Maine. I’m going to take a NERO and get my penultimate resupply box. My new shoes should also arrive. 
The trail was about as perfect as any mountainous trail could be. The climbs were still steep but the terrain didn’t involve scrambling or huge steps. I quickly made it up South Crocker and then North Crocker. As I rested at the summit of North Crocker I thought that this has to be a trick. I was sure that a hellacious descent was coming up. Nope, for the first time since I started the hike on 23 May the mountains didn’t try to kill or maim me. The 5 mile descent was glorious even though I still managed to slip on slick granite twice. 
The hostel is extremely clean and still follows Maine’s COVID-19 protocols. 
I’m finding that my hiker hunger is starting to kick in. I ate a large pizza with a beer for lunch. 
My shoes arrived so I don’t have to stress about them anymore. I also found some spare parts to fix one of my trekking poles in the hiker box. 
Tomorrow I start my next leg of my journey which will take me 73 miles to Monson. I have the Bigelow Mountains to hike up and down tomorrow. Hopefully they will be kind to this old hiker.

15.3 miles to Little Bigelow Lean-to
I had a great night of rest at the Hostel of Maine. Unfortunately I woke up at 5:30 instead of the 6:15 that I had my alarm set for. The hostel provides a shuttle back to the trailhead at 7:30. Given a choice I would have requested a 6:00 shuttle. I had the Bigelow Mountains to hike over and there was a good chance of thunderstorms in the afternoon. I didn’t want to to get stuck on waiting out a thunderstorm below tree line. The Bigelow Peaks are above tree line and it would be foolish to hike over the top during lightning. 
I felt fresh and energized when I started hiking. Today I would climb over the last 4000 foot mountains until Katahdin. The trail miles should get significantly easier after today. Fingers crossed for that. 
The trail was again in great shape. I’m fairly sure that the CCC constructed the past 2 days of trail network. I could tell that the MATC volunteers had been out clearing blown down trees because of the fresh sawdust. 
My first climbs were up 2 mountains called the Horns. I stopped at the summit for a picture and snack. The views were hazy from the overcast weather. I chatted with a 24 year old thru hiker named Two Tents. 
Bigelow West peak was next. This was the second to last 4K footer. This one was exciting to climb because the last section was above tree line in the alpine zone. The climb reminded me of reaching one of the major passes in the Sierra. The wind was blowing strong and I got blown to the side of the trail on my way up. There was a young couple at the summit and they agreed to take my picture. I grabbed the signpost and it tipped over because it was only being loosely supported by big rocks piled around its base. 
Less than a mile away was Bigelow Avery Peak. It was also windy and above tree line. The views were nice but not spectacular because of the haze from the humidity. 
My last Bigelow peak was almost 5 miles away. First came a steepish 2 mile downhill that had a lot of rocks and roots to carefully maneuver around. I keep reminding myself of the hellish trails that I have been on and am thankful for the annoying little rocks and roots. Towards the end of the the descent I felt like a drunken sailor because of being off balance for more than an hour from constantly stepping on irregular shaped rocks and I think I was getting dehydrated.
 I finally reached the bottom of the descent and came to a trail junction that leads to a campsite with guaranteed water. A couple of hikers just came from there and said the water was flowing but the mosquitoes were relentless. I had a choice of hiking a quarter mile to guaranteed water at the campsite or keep climbing another mile where the guide said there might be water. I knew that I couldn’t make it another mile without water so I decided to brave the mosquitoes. The mosquitoes were swarming at the spring but my treated clothes and Picarden on my exposed skin worked surprisingly well keeping the vampires away. 
I felt refreshed and ready to go after my water break. The trail became easier and I made good time on my way up to Little Bigelow Mountain. 
The 2 mile descent to my campsite from Little Bigelow had a mixture of good trail and rooty rocky trail. 
I made it to camp at 5:30. The campsite has a shelter, 2 wooden platforms and several ground campsites. The ground sites would have been nice if it wasn’t supposed to rain tonight. I could tell that water would pool under the tent in a rain storm at these sites due to some low spots. 
The first platform that I chose was just a bit to small for my tent. So after flailing about trying to get my tent to fit I had to move to the larger platform. 
The water is from a beautiful stream that has several deep pools along its way. If it was a sunny warm day I would have taken a dip. The sign marking the trail to the stream is called the “Tubs”. 
Tomorrow I plan to get up early to hike 18 miles to the Pierce Pond campsite. This campsite is only 4 miles from the Kennebec river that you have to take a canoe ferry ride across. The ferry only operates between 9 to 11 am. This is a major milestone and indicates that the end of the trail is getting very close.

My birdie friends woke me up at 4:15 just as it was getting light enough to see. I’m always thankful for their bright and cheerful songs. 
I left camp at 5:45 to head out to Pierce Pond campsite which is a typical stopping point the day before you have to take a canoe ferry across the Kennebec River. It operates from 9 to 11 am. The campsite is less than 4 miles from the river. So it should not take me more than 2 hours to hike there. 
I was eager to start hiking and see what hiking for a a day in Maine with out 4K mountains will be like. My legs felt tired this morning, I guess yesterday’s traverse of the Bigelow range took its toll. 
The trail conditions were mostly smaller rocks and roots. Just tricky enough to slow me down so I wouldn’t trip. It didn’t take long to realize that I was in for a long day of “Silk Blazing”. This is when the first hiker on the trail in the morning clears out the spider webs that extend across the trail. It’s not too bad unless you hit one with spider at eye level. I now had to watch my feet and glance up for spider webs. If I see the webs in time I use my trekking poles to clear the path. The most disgusting thing is when you see the web just before you hit it with your face. I actually ate a large bug that flew into my mouth, disgusting. 
The mosquitoes and other annoying biting bugs were out looking for an easy meal of hiker blood. I knock on wood as I type this but so far my Picardin repellent and insect shield treated clothes have kept the bugs from biting. They still occasionally buzz my ears and try to fly around my glasses to get to my eyes. 
The trail went up and down a few rolling hills. It ran along the edges of multiple ponds. A very pretty day for viewing nature. 
I saw hundreds of toads and 4 garter snakes. I’m still on the lookout for a moose. Tonight I should here the Loon’s call. I had heard their call somewhere else and it wasn’t as pretty as I expected. 
The big factor for hiking today was the hot and humid conditions. It felt like South Carolina to me. I made sure that I took more breaks, slowed down my pace and drank lots of fluids. 
I got to camp at 2:30. Even though I would never stop this early it was kind of nice to leisurely go about my camp chores. 
I have a picture perfect tent site just above the pond’s shoreline. I’m sitting on the bank of the pond right now as I write this. I can here the water rushing out of the pond’s outlet, various birds singing, fish breaking the surface of the water as they snatch up bugs and of course the occasional mosquito buzzing around my head. Surprisingly they haven’t been bad at camp. There is a chipmunk hanging around camp looking for food. I usually make sure that I hang my food bag up in a tree whenever I stray from camp. My food bag is made out of some tough material that is supposed to be bear resistant. 
After dinner I walked back to the shelter to see if I had any neighbors. There was a 72 years old gent who had been doing trail maintenance. He had a lot of interesting information on how the trail gets maintained. He also said that I was lucky because apparently the black fly season has already passed. I don’t know much about them but people say they are like flying teeth out for a bite of your flesh. 
A few fly fishermen went out on their boats before sunset. I’m pretty sure that all they caught were big bites. 
Today marks the 3rd day in a row that Maine didn’t try kill or maim me. I could get used to this. Tomorrow I climb over 4 smallish mountains in the 2K foot range. I’m sure that the climbs will be steep because of course this is New England a region that believes switchbacks are for whimps.

I wanted to sleep in this morning because I had less than a 2 hour hike to get to the canoe ferry that doesn’t start until 9. 
I asked the trail maintenance guy if there was a way to avoid getting your feet wet by crossing at the pond outlet. He told me to take the blue blaze trail that led to a fish camp and that there was a bridge. Well I took the blue blaze and then lost the trail where a bunch of trees fell down. I knew the general direction to go but I didn’t want to bushwhack anymore than necessary so I got out my navigation app and followed the arrow back to the AT. 
The rest of the hike to the river crossing was enjoyable. The trail followed a drainage system that had a large whitewater flowing. My uncle would have enjoyed fly fishing there. 
I got to the river crossing at 7:45. I spent time drinking a lot of fluids to get hydrated for the hot and humid day. I also used my Seek App to identify some plants and a spider. 
Another hiker named Uphill showed up and we crossed in the canoe together. There is a certified wilderness guide that operates the canoe. We both gave him a tip when we got to the other side. I’m return he used his paddle and some river water to give us a blessing for a safe journey. 
The next 7 miles were easy on great trail that allowed me to hike at a good pace. I got to a small brook to fill up with water. This was going to be my last water source for over 7 miles. I drank a water bottle and filled up three 750 ml water bottles. I’m glad I did because with the outrageous heat index I would need every drop. 
Pleasant Pond Mountain didn’t live up to its name. I didn’t see a pond on the mountain and the steep climb up wasn’t very pleasant in the heat. I didn’t want to overheat so I took frequent breaks. I came to an area where the trail was obscured by huge blown down trees. I saw an obvious trail that appeared to be a bypass trail and heading up it. After a few minutes I realized that this was an old trail. I checked my app and sure enough I was on the wrong trail. I didn’t want to to hike back down to try and find the AT so I got my app out and bushwhacked my way back to the AT. 
I finally made it to the summit and sat down for a break. Within minutes I was swarmed by a bunch of tiny black flies that seemed undeterred by my insect repellent and treated clothes. They didn’t really bite ther were just a nuisance. 
The next couple hours was spent trying not to overheat and run out of water before the next water source. 
I was so thankful when I finally found a stream. Now all that was left was a gradual climb up to the campsite. 
I pitched my tent in a pretty little spot away from the shelter. Uphill and 3 friends who have been section hiking the AT since 2002 were also here. It was enjoyable eating dinner and talking about each other’s exploits. 
There must be an ATV trail nearby because at 8:30 pm I could hear there engines roaring as they passed by. 
Tomorrow it’s going to be up early so that I can hike the rest of the way up Moxie Bald Mountain before it gets too hot. I have 22 miles to Monson where a shower, laundry and good food awaits. I will also pick up my last resupply for this journey. The next stop will be the Katahdin summit sign and the end to my AT adventure. I’ll have to be careful because any misplaced step could end a hike. 
It’s very humid tonight. Every night I sleep in the same disgusting shirt that I wore all day. Usually I take off my hiking shorts and sleep in my long pants. Tonight it’s so hot I’m sleeping naked.

Last night some ATV people were riding their ATVs up and down a nearby forest road until 10 pm. Not enjoyable for a tired hiker. 
Just after midnight I heard a creature creeping around my tent. It sounded like it was going to chew a hole in the tent so I turned on my flashlight and tried to see what it was. 
I laid there for awhile hoping that it would go away.  As was worried that it might chew holes in my backpack that I had left hanging from a tree. So I shined my light around and saw something scurrying about with a hoping motion.  At first I thought that it was a huge toad or a kangaroo rat. In town the next day I asked Uphill if any creatures were messing around his tent. He said that something actually jumped up on top of his tent and made the fabric bow in and hit him in the face. 
The birds woke me up before 4am. I didn’t mind because I wanted to get the 2 mile climb up Moxie Bald Mountain done before it got to miserably hot. 
I started hiking at 5am, a record time on trail for me. The climb up had some steep sections and blowdowns but it was overall pretty. I especially enjoyed the above tree line section and the summit had great views. 
The rest of the day should have been the easiest and most enjoyable trail thus far in Maine but the weather was so steamy that my glasses would fog up if I stopped. 
The trail followed a drainage with a nice whitewater river that I could have stopped to collect water and cool off in but I would have had to bushwhack through poison ivy and other thick plants. 
It’s so hot that some hikers were calling the hostel to try and get picked up in remote forest roads. The problem is (from bits and pieces that I’ve heard) a lot of the roads are private and have fences. 
To prevent heat exhaustion I tried to keep my pace reasonable and timed the interval between taking in fluids. My water filters were getting clogged so they had a low flow rate. This was frustrating when you had to take several minutes to fill a water bottle when mosquitoes and biting flies were swarming around. Anyway I made it work and stayed just hydrated enough to avoid dehydration. 
The only time that the heat was affecting my pace was going uphill when I couldn’t control my heart rate. I use heart rate as a  measure of how exertion. I don’t actually stop to measure my actual heart rate but after 40 years of endurance sports I can tell when I need to slow my heart rate down in the heat. Sweat would get into my eyes and I would have to take frequent short breaks to lower my heart rate. 
I was climbing up out of a stream bed and huge trees were blown down over the trail. As has become a daily occurrence for me I took what looked to be a logical way around the blowdowns but ended up a short distance off trail. I thought that it’s too hot for this crap, wasting time, energy and fluids because of these dang blowdowns. I got my app out and bushwhacked back to the trail. 
At the end of the hike I was only 1.3 miles from the trailhead and I only had 2 swallows of water left. I passed a stream that had a trickle of water flowing into some small pools that were just deep enough to collect water from. I passed the stream thinking should I stop or push on. I decided that one more aggravating stop with a clogged water filter was better than getting severely dehydrated. I went back and felt better after downing some much needed fluids. 
My final misadventure came within eyesight of the highway. Another blowdown obscured the trail, I went the wrong way and lost the trail. I started to bushwhack back but finally I thought the heck with this mess I might as well bushwhack down to the road. I did and popped out about 100 yards from the trailhead. I was lucky because if I had started down to the road 20 yards to my left I would’ve ran into a high rocky road embankment. 
I called the hostel and they picked me up. Nicest hostel and owners ever.

We made arrangements to skip breakfast and get shuttled back to the trailhead at 5:30. I was supposed to get a picture of the entering the 100 Mile Wilderness sign but I forget and I didn’t see it. 
The first 9 miles was through a beautiful drainage that included a waterfall and a river running through a slate lined gorge. I also got some views on the some ledges and cliffs. The trail had its ups and downs but the grade wasn’t too taxing. It would have been a great section to pick up my pace if it wasn’t for the many roots and rocks that demanded a slower stride and more careful foot placement. 
I had to get my shoes wet 3 times today because of river fords. The current wasn’t too strong but the water did come up to my knees. The biggest hazard was the slippery slimy rocks. I made it across all of them without slipping. 
The trail got more tricky on a long steepish downhill because of the thick layer of dead leaves. The leaves can be almost as slippery as ice. 
Then came another you better slow down section where the trail was covered with moderate sized boulders from a rock slide. 
So far the trail was challenging because of the obstacles but not a steep grade. Then came the long steep climb up Barren Ledges and Barren Mountain. The climb was very steep but the trail had reasonable sized slabs boulders to negotiate. None of the trail was wet and slippery. The climb came at the end of the day and it really tired me out. 
I had to take a 0.4 mile side trail down to Cloud Pond where the campsite is located. I scouted around for a good tent site and found that the best flat spot was right on the trail leading to the shelter. No one else was here so I set up my tent and partially blocked part of the trail. A pair of hikers showed up later and just walked around my tent. 
I had to get water from the pond. The shoreline stunk but the water seemed okay. The bugs came out in full force as I sat by the shore filtering water. I was glad that I purchased a new water filter at Shaws Hostel because the new one filters much faster which kept my time with the bugs at a minimum. 
A cool breeze started blowing so I got into my tent early. 
Tomorrow’s plan is to get up with the birds and hike close to 19 miles to a campsite. I will be going over several mountains in the Chairback range. 
Water has been an issue because Maine is in a drought and hasn’t had the normal amount of rain. Once you climb up a mountain and out of the drainage there normally hasn’t been any water.

Silver Streak,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639394,"19 miles to Sidney Tappan campsite 
Once again my alarm clock was nature. This time it was birds singing and frogs croaking. I hit the trail at 5:15. 
I started off in a gung-ho let’s get it done attitude but it didn’t take long for my attitude to change for the worst. The trail was a jumble of giant roots and rocks, which are infinitely better than wet granite slabs and huge boulders, but they made for slow going. Plus I felt hungry and in the need for coffee. Later on I discovered that I didn’t put chia seeds in my  cold soak breakfast mix. 
Things improved for 5 minutes when I crossed a bog on a board and saw flowering Purple Pitcher plants. A Guthook user had commented to keep an eye out for this carnivorous plant. Such beautiful flowers and plant body. 
My foul mood reared its ugly head again on my first steep climb  I think that my legs are getting tired from the cumulative exertion I’ve put them through since I started hiking through arguably the hardest sections of the AT back on May 23. The Presidentials, Wildcats, Carters and Southern Maine are filled with large rugged mountains. 
The downhills were even worse. It seemed like I could crawl down the mountain on my hands and knees faster than I was going. I didn’t want to trip so I had to patiently look at each foot placement. 
I was rewarded with some nice views at the summit of each mountain I climbed. Once again the it’s my problem because I set a destination goal and get frustrated when I think that I’m going too slow to attain that goal. It always seems to work out and I’ve met my daily goal everyday except one. 
Right after the start of the descent of Chairback mountain there’s a rock slide area that some people have commented on as being particularly difficult. It was actually not that bad compared to southern Maine. 
Past the rock slide the trail started to resemble a groomed trail that you might see in a city park. Hardly any rocks or roots to trip you up. I was able to reach a nice cruising speed. After this my attitude started improving. 
The trail was so nice that I went too fast downhill and did something to my left quadriceps muscle. I knew better than to push the downhill pace but I couldn’t help myself because I wanted to make up for the time I lost earlier. I was really worried because I’ve never had this issue before and I thought that I might have done some long term damage. It was very painful on the steep uphills and downhills. I paused numerous times to try to stretch it out. 
The finale for the day was a 6 mile climb up Gulf Hagish mountain. The majority of the climb was easy. It didn’t get hard until the last 2 miles and then it was steep. My quadriceps still hurt which made the climb more unpleasant. I hate to stop hiking once I start a climb because I like to keep my focus on getting one foot in front of the other until the climb is over. This time I stopped, took off my pack and did a series of my favorite stretches. I rested and talked with a few southbounders for about 20 minutes. My quads felt much better and within several minutes the problem seemed to have resolved itself. I was thankful when I finally reached the summit. 
With all of the southbounders I’ve seen today I was concerned about finding space at the campsite. I was relieved to find only one southbounder shared the campsite with a southbounder who was getting ready to set up his hammock. He made sure to leave me the best tent site with minimal roots and slope. The hammock setup looked so easy and he didn’t have to look for a flat campsite without roots. 
The water source for this site was a nice cold spring coming out of the mountain.

Silver Streak,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639406,"25 miles to Antlers campsite. 
The birds woke me up before 4am. I was hiking by 5:15. Today was going to be an exciting day. My last big climb was 3600 foot White Cap mountain in around 4 miles and 2 other mountains away. I was sitting on Whitecap at 7:30. White Cap and the other 2 mountains I just climbed weren’t very difficult. 
Going down the mountain I saw a great view of Katahdin rising above all the other mountains in the distance. My end goal, Katahdin’s summit, is only 51 miles away from where I’m camping. I’ve done 2141 miles on foot to get here. 
The hike down White Cap was going to be interesting.  The descent down Whitecap started with some large boulders and loose scree or talus. I didn’t want to have a mishap hiking down the last big mountain so I started picking my way carefully over the rocks and boulders. Just as I got into tree line I hit a tree root stub with my foot and fell forward towards a big rock that was aiming for my head. Luckily I turned and landed on my side. I was very upset that I could have had a extremely serious accident on my last descent. I walked away shaken and with blood pouring down my right pinky finger which had a flap of skin ripped off the knuckle. It was a freak accident, I was going slow and watching the trail but my right foot veered slightly to the edge of the trail and caught a nub of a root poking up through the dirt. 
About halfway down the 3 mile descent the trail got less steep and the number of rocks and roots lessened. Soon after I was able to keep a steady but cautious pace. Everything was just perfect until I saw a sign for Little Boardman Mountain. I thought that I was done climbing mountains. Apparently I misunderstood the whole Whitecap was the last mountain thing. Anyway I was very disappointed and my mood soured. I had to listen to music to take my mind off the injustice of having to climb another mountain. I know whaa suck it up crybaby. For such a short mountain (2100 feet) the climb seemed to take forever. I rejoiced when I finally got to the summit. A short way down the other side I met a grandmother and her 2 grandkids doing some trail maintenance. She informed me that I have another mountain to climb tomorrow. 
Soon after the descent of Boardman mountain the trail turned into the perfect example of a city park trail. I took off at a brisk careful pace. There were occasional obstacles but overall the next 10 miles were the easiest of this trip. I was a happy hiker. 
I got to Antler campsite around 5. It’s a beautiful place situated on a peninsula that juts out into a large pond. This is one of the most wonderful campsites on the AT. I think that it’s my all time AT favorite. 
There was a group of 6 young southbounders set up in a large campsite. They were very friendly and I enjoyed talking with them. I set up my tent further out towards the end of the peninsula for some treasured solitude. I ate dinner on the pond shoreline watching the sunset behind a mountain. A nice cool breeze was keeping the vampire insect numbers down to a minimum. All was good until I noticed that the youngsters weren’t observing traditional hiker midnight. They were up being loud until well past 10. Aggravating when I knew that I’d be getting up around 4am. 
I hope to hike another 25 miles to another campsite tomorrow.  I decided to put in two 25 mile days in a row because the grade is easier with only one mountain to climb each day and I wanted to get to Abol campground early so that I could enjoy the beautiful views of Katahdin and the river. I will only have 12 miles to hike Abol Bridge where I will camp on Monday

Silver Streak,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639444,"25.3 miles to Rainbow Spring campsite 
The birds let me down this morning and I didn’t wake up until my bird alarm woke me up. I started hiking at 5:30. 
On the way past the young southbounders I stopped and explained the concept of “Hiker Midnight”. It means that thru hikers need their sleep because they get up early so other hikers need to observe quite time when the sunsets. I tried not to come off as a cranky old man but they probably thought I was. 
I had one mountain to climb about 15 miles into the day. The name is hard to pronounce and harder to spell so I won’t try. 
The trail to the mountain passed some beautiful drainage systems and ponds. Whenever the trail is close to water the trail gets congested with larger rocks and massive root systems. This is annoying because you have to slow down and step very carefully.  Occasionally the trail would climb up and over a rocky outcrop and then drop back down to the pond. There were several areas where the trail actually traveled across a beach made up of sand and pebbles. 
The whitewater rivers were very tempting for me to stop and cool off but I have the Atlantic Ocean at home to play in and I really wanted to go surfing or stand-up paddling, something that uses my arms more than my legs. 
This pattern repeated itself for 13 miles and then the climb began. It was steep in places but there were also some switchbacks which gave me a rest on the way up. When I climb I try to keep putting one foot in front of the other, no matter how slow I’m going until I reach the top. 
I finally made it to the summit around 12:15 and took a nice long break chatting with other hikers before I started the last 10 miles of the day. It’s funny how quickly I forget how steep the climb was once I get to the top. 
The trail on the other side had fewer sections of massive roots and I was able to make better time. The trail traveled through several gorges which had cool whitewater rivers rushing through fascinating rock formations. If I wasn’t in a hurry there were plenty of places for fishing or soaking in a pool of cool water. The temperature was in the low 80s but the humidity seemed a lot lower than it was several days ago. 
I pulled into camp around 5pm. There was another hiker here with his dog. I recognized his trail name from a YouTube video put out by a guy that started hiking in January. He had issues with a hiker with the same trail name as this guy at the Fontana Dam shelter which is right before you enter the Great Smokie Mountains National park. The guy that I was now talking to freaked out the YouTube guy so much that he feared for his life and left the trail (massive amounts of snow was also a factor). So I sat down and chatted with the guy and got to know his cute dog. He seemed like a nice guy and had been doing some campsite maintenance while he was at the campsite. He even set up some rock cairns to help alert other hikers that they were at the campsite. Sometimes you might miss a trail sign hung on a tree if you’re busy looking out for trip hazards. He definitely had a unique personality but he wasn’t an ax murderer. A pair of hikers that I had met on top of the last mountain pulled into the campsite. I was kind of relieved to have company with the questionable hiker around. I asked them about their impressions of the odd hiker and they both had gotten weird vibes from him and they didn’t even talk with him. 
Strange dangerous characters hits close to home because in 2019 a hiker that I had dinner with at a shelter just north of Max Patch was murdered on the trail about a month later by a character that was harassing hikers for days. 
Tomorrow I leave the 100 mile wilderness. I have around 11.5 miles to hike to Abol Bridge where I will get a campsite and food from the general store. The next day I have a 10 mile hike into Baxter State Park where I will get a permit to Katahdin and pay for a space in a campground set aside for northbound thru hikers.

Silver Streak,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639515,"I’m sitting on a picnic table at Abol Campsites looking up at Katahdin. The view starts at the campground with a lush meadow that has a slow moving river running through it. Then as I look up I see multiple layers of forest rising above the meadow up into low hills. From the top of the hills juts Katahdin rising several thousand feet above everything else. A spectacular scene. Worth hiking 2180 miles for, maybe. 
I just finished off a Wicked Woopie pie for dessert. It is like a sandwich with huge pieces of chocolate cake instead of bread and an insane amount of delicious cream filling. Only something that long distance hikers should eat. 
This morning I was lucky enough to score a campsite in Baxter State Park. The advantage is that I will have a shelter to myself tomorrow when it’s supposed to have some serious rain. My other alternative was to stay with every other northbound hiker that shows up tomorrow at a group campsite reserved for northbound hikers that have hiked at least through the 100 Mile Wilderness to get there. Hikers can stay only one night before they summit Katahdin. 
I have about 10 miles to hike tomorrow to Katahdin Stream Campground (KSC) and then just over 5 miles on Wednesday to reach the end of my adventure on the summit of Katahdin. 
This morning the birds did what they do best and beat my alarm. I was hiking by 5:30. I took off joyful and excited to getting out of the 100 mile wilderness and checking off another milestone of reaching Abol bridge. 
For some reason I was expecting a nice smooth trail for cruising to the finish line. The AT had other plans. There were plenty of roots and rocks to keep me honest and slow down my pace. Just to keep things from getting too monotonous the trail added some huge boulders for me to navigate over or around. I’m so over having to step over roots and constantly worry about tripping and ruining my hike. I kept reminding myself that at least the trail isn’t trying to kill me like the White Mountains and Southern Maine. 
I got on top of rainbow ledges and stopped to send out a Inreach position to my family. I wanted to see if I had cell service to check the weather. Hurrah for my prepaid Verizon phone which works in this remote area. For some reason I decided to check the weather on the Baxter State Park website. Then I got the idea to see if they had any openings in their private campsites. They did but I had to have an account to reserve one. I filled out their form 3 times to register and each time the website would not let me submit the information.  I located the reservation phone line and called at 8:02. They opened at 8:00. I was the 3rd in-line. I finally got connected with a reservation person and secured my campsite. Such luck. I was supposed to get a confirmation email. I didn’t. So I called back and this time I was 7th inline. By the way it’s cool and breezy on the ledges. The lady checked my email and it was copied down wrong. She said I was lucky to get the campsite and I was supposed to have a paper copy of the reservation. I told her that I was on of a mountain finishing my AT hike and I didn’t have access to a printer. She told me the rangers would work it out. About 30 minutes later I called again because I still hadn’t received an email. The same lady answered the phone and said she would radio the rangers to make them aware of my situation. She still didn’t have my email correct so we carefully went over each letter of my email address. Last time I checked I still have not received the email. But she said don’t worry about the email. I’m the kind that likes to have everything worked out perfectly or I worry that something will go wrong. 
The rest of the hike was more of the same as far as the trail conditions go. Several southbound hikers came by only 20 or so miles into their journey. I didn’t envy them hiking through the summer heat, humidity and bugs. I started in February 2019 and the 23rd of May this year to avoid the heat. The bugs have been crazy but once again my anti- bug system has worked great. Not 100% effective but close. 
I finally made it to the opening of the woods that marked the end of the 100 mile Wilderness. I looked for the famous sign that warns people to be prepared for the next 100 miles but I didn’t see it. 
I celebrated seeing the Abol Bridge and felt great relief and excitement because there’s a great view of Katahdin dominating the horizon from the bridge. 
I checked in at the campsite and decided on a private bunkhouse because I didn’t want to break camp in the rain tomorrow morning. I bought an ice cream and some other junk food. Their restaurant is closed because they can’t find seasonal workers so I settled on buying some ramen noodles and a flavored tuna packet. I cold the soaked ramen noodles, dumped out the water and added the flavored tuna. A lot of thru hikers eat this combination on the trail but I don’t because the thought of carrying trash that smells like fish disgusts me. 
The campsite comes with a continental breakfast. At first I told the owner that I would be hiking out too early to partake and asked him if I could get something the night before. He agreed. Later I thought, why rush, I only have 10 miles to go and I already have a campsite reservation. So I decided that I would try to sleep in and enjoy a leisurely breakfast before I started hiking in the rain that was supposed to be coming tomorrow morning. It’s hard to break my thru-hiker mentality of early rising to hike more miles.

2187 miles down 5.2 miles to go. 
I’m so glad that I decided to sleep in at the Abol Campground and enjoy a complementary continental breakfast. The breakfast items included some of what is offered at a typical hotel. I had coffee, biscuits, the weird eggs that look like an omelette and a yogurt. I actually slept in until 6:20. 
I was hiking at 9. 
My first highlight was to stop near the park boundary and register with a ranger as a hiker and if needed to sign up to stay at the Birches hiker campsite. I had reservations at another campsite so I didn’t need to sign up for the Birches. 
The 10 miles to Katahdin Stream Campground (KSC) in Baxter State Park was through some beautiful forest and watershed areas. It was a perfect penultimate day of hiking and the miles clicked by quickly. The closer I got to KSC the more day hikers I encountered out enjoying one of the many other trails that they have in Baxter. 
I was anxious about my reservation and was worried that the rangers might not know about my unique situation of not having an email confirmation. 
I got to KSC and the ranger was out doing ranger things. This didn’t help bring closure to my anxiety. I didn’t know if I should go set up in my campsite or wait. I decided to go for a tour and maybe I’d find the ranger. On the way back I saw the ranger’s truck parked and noticed the ranger working on a campsite. I introduced myself to him and he immediately commented on my name, Rick James, which was made famous by a comedy skit of Dave Chapelle. He said that he heard my name on the radio yesterday about my campsite and he wondered what this hiker Rick James would be like. I don’t know if I disappointed him but I did repeat the phrase from the skit that gets people laughing. 
I felt relieved now that all was settled. We had a good chat while he registered me and gave me my permit for hiking up Katahdin where I will touch my final white blaze and finish the Appalachian Trail. 
I setup my tent in my shelter to get away from the bugs. It’s still supposed to thunderstorm later tonight. 
Hopefully the birds will wake me up early tomorrow so I can get an early start on the final leg of this adventure. I have a 10.4 mile round trip to the summit and back.

The birds woke me up at 4am and I was out hiking at 5:10. 
I was excited to finally be hiking the final miles to the Katahdin summit sign. I knew that there was going to be about a mile of hands on rock scrambling on the way up. How sketchy it might be I didn’t know. The weather was cool and windy. 
I got to the rock scrambling section and just took it slow and steady. I made sure that my foot and handholds were secure and I wouldn’t slip. They have blazes on the rocks marking the suggested route which helped a lot. The sun was in my eyes on the way up so I would have to shade my eyes to look up and find the next blaze. The rock scrambling was fun and not too difficult. There was a long section where I was on a very narrow “knife edge” path which was unnerving because the wind was strong. 
After you get past the steep scrambling sections there’s a gradual climb up to the summit. Eventually I could make out the famous summit sign. I got there around 8:30. I felt a feeling of accomplishment at having attained my goal of finishing the AT and a sense of relief that my adventure was finally over. No one else was around so I had to take my own selfie summit sign pictures. I stayed up there enjoying the views but it was cold and windy so I headed back down after 30 minutes. 
I knew that the adventure wasn’t over until I safely down climbed the sketchy part and then take the final footsteps into the campground. 
Descending the sketchy part for me was 1 hour of terror. I was so worried about slipping or tripping and breaking something. I was super cautious and spent most of my time on my butt easing myself down from foothold to foothold. Just looking down from the top section towards the people coming up in the distance made me anxious. 
I tried not to look to far past my next move and inched myself down. I breathed a sigh of relief when I finally got below tree line and the sketchy part ended. I still had to be cautious the rest of the way down because there were many rocks and roots that I could still slip or trip on. 
I made it safely down to KSC around 12:30.
How do I feel having accomplished the remarkable feat of hiking the entire AT?  Well in the words of Forest Gump:  “I’m tired. I think I’ll go home now”.  
 My shuttle wasn’t supposed to be here until 3pm so I asked a ranger if he could help me get ahold of the place that I’m going to stay at to see if they could pick me up early. He drove me to a place where he had cell service and I had to leave a message. So he drove me back to KSC and I tried to send out an Inreach message. Well it’s now 2:15 and no one has shown up to pick me up early so I guess that they couldn’t get me early. 
The shuttle driver arrived exactly on time. The driver is the daughter of the Inn owner. She’s a Special Education assistant that specializes in teaching life skills to those that need it. 
The 100 Mile Wilderness Inn is a very nice B&B type place. I had a comfortable bed and room. I went to dinner at the only restaurant within walking distance.  I enjoyed a celebratory pizza and beer. For desert I walked across the street to a soft serve ice cream truck and bought a hot fudge sundae and a chocolate shake. Yummy.

My wife and I are going to start a 500+ mile section hike of the PCT starting in early August. We will start at Sierra City in central California and hike south towards our beloved Sierra mountains.  The picture of my wife and I was taken on Forester Pass in 2017. An example of why the Sierra keep calling us back  


She just retired from teaching so next year we will be thru hiking the PCT from the Mexican border to Canada. The PCT has been a goal of ours since we completed our first JMT hike in 2014 and discovered that the PCT existed. 
Some of my 2021 favorites things:
Campsites. Antler and Pierce Pond campsites in Maine. 
Views: looking back towards Mt Washington and the Tupperman Ravine from the north side.  The Bigelows and the scrambling zone going up Mt Katahdin had magnificent views. 
Alpine areas: I enjoy all of the alpine areas regardless of “views”. I just love looking at the terrain and vegetation in the alpine zone. I also love feeling a brisk cold wind in these areas. Baldpate and the Bigelows were my favorites. 
Scrambling:  I enjoy scrambling up the mountain because it’s fun using your whole body and problem solving skills. My favorite rock scrambling was up the first Wildcat mountain after Pinkham Notch and the scramble up Mt Katahdin. 
Hostel:  Shaws (friendly and great breakfast) and The Cabin  (Honey’s company and homemade Lasagna)
Haunted house: The Libby House in Gorham. A ghost stole my favorite Patagonia town shirt. 
Gear notes: 
Osprey Exos 58:  it was comfortable and rugged enough for me by The front stretching pocket got one large and several small holes due to all of the blowdowns and bushwhacking.  The bottom fabric that encloses the frame rods got worn due to all of the butt sliding I did to safely make it down wet slippery granite slabs and huge boulders. 
Lone Peak 5:  I’ve worn Lone Peaks since the 2.5 version in 2016. I’ve always had durability issues with them but I keep using them because I have wide feet and they are usually comfortable. My first pair of Lone Peak 5s didn’t even last 100 miles before the sole in the heel area started separating from the upper. I had to overnight a new pair to the Hostel of Maine. The new pair have almost 200 miles on them and have held up well. The 5s feel too wide and sloppy on my feet. I know that the toe box should be wide but I prefer that the rest of the shoe hold my feet tighter. This sloppiness was especially evident in areas with many irregularly shaped rocks that I had to walk on. 
Zpacks Duplex freestanding pole kit:  I bought this kit to make the tent easier to pitch on wooden platforms and narrow tent sites that had obstacles to the guy lines. I have pitched the tent on solid rock, wooden platforms and narrow spaces plenty of times without the freestanding kit but it takes extra time and energy at the end of a long hiking day so the freestanding kit was a time and aggregation saver. I still prefer to pitch the tent with trekking poles and guy lines because the tent is slightly quicker to set up and take down the traditional way. 
Insect protection:  I would coat all of my exposed skin with Sawyer Picardin in the morning before I got out of my tent. This one coat would last all day no matter how much I sweated and I didn’t have to reapply after water crossings. I had my hiking clothes treated by Insect Shield and I sprayed permethrin on miscellaneous items like my hat, pack, and shoes. 
Rail Riders shirt:  Favorite clothing item. It has a zippered chest pocket that kept my IPhone 12 mini secure. It also dries quickly and has ventilation.
Phone provider. T-Mobile worked surprisingly well everywhere except for the last 50 miles of the 100 mile wilderness where I had to resort to my prepaid Verizon phone. 
Water filters:  I brought an almost new Befree filter and an old Sawyer Squeeze that I had to unclog before I left as a backup. The Befree started flowing extremely slow within the first week. It happened after several nights of sub freezing temperature. I slept with the filter but didn’t always keep the filter next to my body while I hiked. Perhaps it got too cold and was damaged. I had to resort to my backup Sawyer attached to a Smartwater bottle. This was faster than the Befree but annoying. I wish that I’d brought my Sawyer Squeeze compatible CNOC water bladder with the wide opening. I finally had to buy a new Sawyer Squeeze at Shaws. 
Zpacks Carbon Trekking Poles. I broke both of the poles in different places within 20 minutes of each other. Luckily I had enough good pole left to make them work the rest of the hike. I initially covered the end of the exposed carbon poles with a rubber pole protector. These lasted almost 100 miles to Shaws Hostel. The carbon pole eventually pushed through the rubber and I had to hike using only the exposed carbon poles. At Shaws I bought a pair of rubber poles tips designed specifically for hiking.
