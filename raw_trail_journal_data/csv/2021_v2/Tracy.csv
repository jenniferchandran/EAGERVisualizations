Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/466267,"As a young girl, I loved riding bicycles, roaming the woods, playing softball, and being outside with friends. I was a reliable, hard worker and earned money baby-sitting and collecting soda bottles from nearby construction sites and returning them for their deposit money. During my senior year at a small Christian school, my classmates and I pondered what unusual and memorable senior trip we should take.   Someone suggested backpacking on the Appalachian Trail and the idea appealed to us.
On May 24, 1976, eleven students, one male teacher, and one student’s father met at Fontana Lake at the entrance to the Smokey Mountains. Some of us had never been camping. Even fewer had been backpacking. Equipped with slumber-party sleeping bags, borrowed backpacks and tents, and an assortment of freeze-dried foods, we set off on a week-long adventure.
After a year of college, I spent a summer working at a youth-camp in Plumtree, NC.   I loved teaching the younger campers how to ride a horse, tube in the creek, cook over a campfire, and many other things. I dreamed of backpacking on the Appalachian Trail again one day.
After working my way through college and graduating with a degree in teaching English, I got married and began my teaching career. Soon there were four children in the family. I took my children hiking and camping and tried to instill in them a love for God and for the outdoors and dreamed of backpacking on the Appalachian Trail again one day.
I watched my children grow up participating in sports and spending summers outside playing and camping. I saw each of them graduate from high school and head off to college. Two of them graduated from college and got married. I welcomed two grandchildren into the family.  I loved being a wife, a mom, a teacher, and a nana. My days were full and rewarding but I wondered if I was getting too old to fulfill my dream of backpacking the Appalachian Trail.
One day, I happened to pick up a book written by a middle-aged man who had thru-hiked the Appalachian Trail after he had lost his wife to cancer. For Christmas a few months later, one of my sons gave me a book about another thru-hiker. The dream of backpacking on the Appalachian Trail began to occupy many of my thoughts. 
My husband eventually told me that I should follow my dream. I began checking out books from the local library and reading trail journals online. I attended Warren Doyle’s Appalachian Trail Institute and hiked 16.7 miles over the course of three days (467.6-484.3). I made a new friend who also wanted to backpack the Appalachian Trail. I began accumulating gear. I began counting down the days until I would meet my hiking buddy at Springer Mountain in Georgia and my AT dream would become a reality.  After so many years, I would finally be backpacking on the Appalachian Trail.","US 58, footbridge over stream

Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/466300,"I made one last trip (hopefully) to REI today for some last-minutes odds and ends. I had all the food items I would need (hopefully) for a two-week backpacking trek. We planned to start at Springer Mountain carrying 4 days of food, mail 7 days of resupply to ourselves to be picked up at Neels Gap, and get the last 4 days of supplies at Wayah Bald. I separated my food into three piles and got them packed. It was so hard to know how much I would be eating. I didn't want to pack too little, but I didn't want to be carrying too much either. This two-week trek would teach me a lot and make future preparation lots easier. After all, experience is the best teacher!",,View Entry,"Jul 16, Wed",0
Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/466482,I mailed my first resupply box today. My husband made reservations at Fontana Village for him to meet me there the day I should arrive at the end of our hike. Knowing these things (along with the balance on my REI VISA) should be great motivators for me to keep on hiking if I feel like quitting. I have waited a long time and invested much in preparation for this hike and I want to get my money's worth!!,,View Entry,"Jul 17, Thu",0
Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/466705,"This was my last night at home, inside a house, in my own bed, before I would drive to Springer Mountain for my first two-week trek on the Appalachian Trail. So much was going through my head that I could not sleep. For months I had been pondering trail names. I did not want to earn a trail name for something stupid I did on the trail.  I wanted something appropriate, meaningful, and clever; but I was at a loss. 
I realized that tomorrow would be the day I finally would be backpacking AGAIN after my first backpacking experience 38 years ago. I also realized that I would have to keep coming back to the trail every year for several years AGAIN and AGAIN to complete the entire AT. If I was to reach Fontana Dam by our two-week deadline this trek, I would have to pick up each foot AGAIN and AGAIN and AGAIN. I would have to get up and get moving AGAIN after each rest stop. I thought of the Disney movie ""Miracle"" which my family had watched many times and how the coach made his players repeat drills AGAIN so many times. In my mind, I could hear Johnny Cash singing about ""The Highwayman"" coming back ""again and again and again.""  I decided that my trail name should be AGAIN.",,View Entry,"Jul 18, Fri",0
Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/469260,"I woke up to the sound of rain in the night. When I got up in the morning, it was still raining HARD. Not an auspicious start to a two-week backpacking trip. I savored what I knew would be my last shower for days to come.   My backpack, complete with 4 days of food and two 32 oz. bottles of water, weighed 31.8 pounds when I put it into the car for the trip to Springer Mountain.    My husband and I drove the two hours from home to Dahlonega in pouring rain. Most of the trip, my wipers were on full-blast. We met Iris at the closed Tritt's Grocery Store at US 19 and USFS 42. I said good-bye to my husband there and rode down the forest service road with Iris and her husband to Big Stamp Gap. It was noon and still raining lightly when we arrived there to begin our hike.
We put on our backpacks and rain ponchos and began the .9 mile hike to the top of Springer Mountain in light rain. A couple of day-hikers were at the top of Springer and took pictures of us there. In the excitement, we forgot all about signing the trail register there. We hiked back down that .9 mile of the Appalachian Trail and continued with our hike, eating lunch as we went. The rain finally stopped, but the trees continued to drip on us for the rest of the day. 
Knowing that we were going to be starting around noon, we had planned to stop at Three Forks campsite after 5.7 miles, for an easy first day. When we arrived there, we decided it was too early to make camp and we should push on 2.3 miles to Hawk Mountain Shelter for our first night. Somehow, we missed the shelter and before we knew it, we were at Hightower Gap, the junction of USFS 42 and 69. It seemed pointless to backtrack .5 mile to the shelter, so we set up camp at the crossroads, boiled water for our Mountain House meals, ate dinner, hung our bear bags, and collapsed for the night.
We fell asleep listening to what sounded like repeated gunfire in the distance. It was a little disconcerting.   We learned the next day that it was probably from ARMY Ranger training that was taking place nearby.
It rained more in the night. I was very thankful for my dry, cozy tent and rainfly. My REI 1 1/2 inch air mattress and ThermaRest pillow were definitely worth their cost and weight; they allowed me to get a good night's rest.  I was finally backpacking on the AT again!","Springer Mountain
",Hightower Gap,"Jul 19, Sat",8.60
Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/469263,"Even though the rain had stopped by morning, packing up under the dripping trees was a challenge. Just as we were finishing our packing and breakfast, a truck pulled into ""our"" campsite and parked. Two guys got out to begin a day-hike. After they left, I took the opportunity to look at myself in the outside mirror of their truck. That was probably a mistake. 
We didn't get on the trail until almost 10:00am. We met a group of five from Florida calling themselves Dead Men Walking. The three guys had been section hiking together for a few years, and this was the first year that one of them had brought his two sons with him. I really wish I had done this years earlier with my own three sons! They had been going up to Springer when we were on our way down, and they had spent the previous night at the shelter we had passed accidentally. At Horse Gap a trail angel had left three gallons of water, and we all topped off our water bottles. We leapfrogged with this group of hikers the rest of the day. The rain finally stopped, but it was misty all day. Sadly, there were no views anywhere.
We met Dead Men Walking again at Justus Creek. They were just finishing filling up with water when we stopped there to fill up ours. Doc, a chef, let us know he was planning No-Bake Oreo Cheesecake for an after-dinner treat that night and offered to share with us if we made it to the same shelter where they were planning to stay. After they continued on and our water bottles were filled again, we peeled off our shoes and socks and soaked our feet in the COLD water. It was refreshing but we could only stand it for about five minutes. Then we hiked another 1.4 miles to Gooch Mountain Shelter. 
Shortly after we arrived, a father-daughter team, Mike and Morgan, joined us. A little later a solo hiker stumbled into camp. Like Mike and Morgan, he had started at Springer that same morning. He said he had not felt well all day, and he spread out his sleeping bag immediately and collapsed on it. He slept while the rest of us talked, made dinner preparations, ate, and hung our bear bags. True to his word, Doc pulled on latex gloves after dinner and prepared the No-Bake Oreo Cheesecake and shared with us all. It was definitely a treat we all enjoyed.
It was nice being in a shelter, with a real roof overhead, but with ten people in the shelter, it was not exactly a restful night. I woke up every time that anyone got up to take a potty break; and I think every single person must have gotten up at least once in the night.","Hightower Gap
",Gooch Mountain Shelter,"Jul 20, Sun",7.20
Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/469264,"It was a little comical in the morning with ten of us trying to get up, get water, eat, pack, and use the privy. Iris and I left first about 9:00am. After about a mile and a half, Dead Men Walking passed us. Then the solo hiker, who was feeling much better, passed us. Then the father/daughter passed us. We never saw any of them again. We only saw a few other day-hikers on the trail. Up and down. Up and down. Up and down. All day.  Each has its pros and cons. I had to treat some blisters that were developing on both feet today. At Jarrard Gap, still 1.5 all uphill to our shelter, I was going pretty slowly. I asked Iris if she would like to hike ahead of me so she could go at her faster pace and I could take the hill at my pace without worrying about slowing her down so much. She took off, but I was pleased when I saw her sooner than I thought I would, at the blue-blaze trail to the shelter. There were a couple of guys setting up camp at a campsite right on the trail, but we took the supposedly .2 mile trail to the shelter. It sure seemed much longer than .2! We had the Woods Hole Shelter all to ourselves. We also had cell service, so I got to talk to my husband for a few minutes. As soon as we ate, hung our bear bags, and collapsed into sleeping bags, an owl began hooting. I counted 11 times before it finally quit and I was able to fall asleep. Another good day of backpacking on the AT!","Gooch Mountain Shelter

Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/469265,"We got a good night's sleep and were able to leave the shelter by 8:00m. Shortly down the trail, we met Bionic Woman, Frodo, Samwise, and Jake from State Farm filtering water. They pumped water for us too. Thanks friends! 
Then we started the ascent up Blood Mountain. Because it was raining again, there were no views.  It was a tough mile climb in the rain to a nice stone shelter. There was a group of 7 FAU kids there, still making pancakes for breakfast. Dead Men Walking had spent the night there with them, but were already on the trail. We rested for a half hour, hoping the rain would quit. 
It was a tough two hours downhill, over large, slippery rock sections, into Neel Gap. On our way down, we passed a large extended family group of about 30 of all ages hiking up Blood Mountain. 
At Neel Gap, we picked up the re-supply boxes that we had mailed to ourselves the week before -- 7 days worth of food. I bought long pants to replace my shorts. I cut off my camisole into a bra to get rid of the hot, tight portion around my torso. After sorting through all my new food items, I put some of it back in the box, along with my shorts, rain pants, sunglasses, and a deck of cards, to send back home. No sense carrying any extra weight. We ate lunch there and filled up with water and I enjoyed getting a peppermint patty.   We got to see what their hostel was like. It was great getting to wear my Teva sandals the whole time we were there.
Eventually, we made ourselves shoulder our newly packed backpacks, which were heavier than ever with 7 days of food. They felt even heavier because the first 1.5 miles were all uphill out of the gap. At least the weather cleared up finally, and we were able to get some pictures of the views from Leveland Mountain, Wolf Laurel Top, and Cowrock Mountain.
    Pictures of the hostel at Neel Gap kept floating through my head all afternoon, and we tried to call them from the mountain tops in the afternoon to arrange a shuttle back to stay there for the night. No one ever answered, so we kept hiking on. 
I had a really rough time making it the last half mile up Wildcat Mountain. It was steep and seemed even harder since it was 7:00pm. I was regretting having spent so much time at Neel Gap by then. We had intended to make it to Whitley Gap Shelter. When realized the shelter was 1.2 off the trail, we decided NO shelter could be wonderful enough to warrant that far of a hike each way to and from it!
We stopped at a campsite atop Wildcat Mountain. It didn't take long to rehydrate our dinners, eat, set up tents, hang our bear bags by headlamp light, and collapse into sleeping bags! We woke early, hoping to see a brilliant sunrise. Even though it was clear weather, we were on the west side of the mountaintop so we missed it.  It was still great to finally be hiking on the AT!","Woods Hole Shelter
",Wildcat Mountain,"Jul 22, Tue",10
Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/469266,"I took extra time to reorganize my pack with all the new food from yesterday's resupply box. It took valuable time, but made things work better for me. We left camp about 9:00am.  We had no water left, but were heading to a water source at Hogpen Gap about .2 from our campsite. We had to adjust our plans for getting water and go farther downstream because when we arrived, we found a four foot long timber rattler stretched out right where we wanted to fill up our water bottles. Upon further scrutiny we saw a little chipmunk which had evidently already been bitten by the snake. The chipmunk was barely alive. We watched, horridly fascinated to see this drama as it unfolded. Each time the snake would flick his tongue near the chipmunk, the chipmunk would muster up what strength it had to move a few inches farther away. The snake would then take its time and close the gap. Several minutes would pass with neither moving. Finally the snake's tongue would flicker against the chipmunk, and the chipmunk would rouse and move a few more inches away. This happened numerous times while we treated our water, and watched and waited. Finally we shouldered our packs and left, wondering how long it would be before the snake finally finished off the little chipmunk. At Hogpen Gap, a section hiker was coming down the mountain and getting into his car. We chatted a few minutes and then asked if he would mind taking our trash bags with him. He agreed and we left with our backpacks a few ounces lighter. He was the first of several total strangers who performed this nice service for us along our trek. Thanks guys! We only crossed paths with two other southbound hikers the rest of the day. We had lunch at Low Gap Shelter, then a gradual uphill climb all afternoon to Tray Mountain Shelter where we would stay the night. The last .6 to the shelter was rocky and rough.  It was 7:30pm when we arrived at the shelter. There was a father/son team from Florida already there. They had been hiking with their boy scout troop but the son had pulled a groin muscle, and these two had to let the others go on without them. They planned to rest at the shelter a couple of days and then meet the rest of the troop at Unicoi Gap where their vehicles were parked. They had camped the night before at Whitley Gap 1.2 miles off the AT, where we had originally planned to camp. They warned us that they had heard a snap in the woods near this shelter and turned to see a bear moving through the woods twice already this afternoon, so they had named the bear ""Snap"". We never heard or saw it ourselves. Thankful for the bear cables at this shelter so we did not have to throw our own bear ropes over a branch tonight. It was nice sharing the shelter and swapping trail stories with new friends after another day of hiking on the AT.","Wildcat Mountain

Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/469267,"When my sons were junior high age and I would ask them what they were wearing to school the next day, they would always answer ""whatever is on the top of the stack in my drawer"". On the trail when I wonder what to eat for my next meal or snack, my answer is always, ""whatever is heaviest"". It just makes sense to lighten the load in my pack the quickest, easiest way.
Today I have been remembering the old Sunday School song, ""There was a wise old king, who had a thousand men. He marched them up the hill, and he marched them down again."" Even as a kid, I did not think that was really a very wise thing to do. As a hiker, I am wondering if that same old king is the one who designed the AT. It seems there are way too many pointless ups and downs, with no spectacular views or other reasons for being at the tops.
On the way to Unicoi Gap this morning, I heard my phone give me the low battery signal. I had been keeping it on airplane mode and I was only going thru minimal charge each day. Somehow, in my pack the airplane mode was turned off and the phone is now down to 11%. At Unicoi Gap parking lot, I was hoping to find someone in a car who had an iPhone5 car charger. A couple of guys stopped to day-hike and I asked them. I got really excited when they said yes, but their charger was for an iPhone4 and would not work for my phone. oh well. At least they agreed to take our trash bags.   We also met a family of five starting off there for a day-hike. We let them go before us, because with our newly restocked backpacks weighing at least 35 lbs., we knew we would be going slow on the uphill trail out of the gap. 
We scaled Blue Mountain, Rocky Mountain, and Tray Mountain and stopped at the Tray Mountain shelter at 5:00pm. It was only an 8.1 mile day, but it was a lot of elevation change. We actually got our water, ate dinner, hung our bear bags, and were in bed BEFORE dark for a change, resting up for the morrow which was going to be our longest day yet. It was difficult to fall asleep with a constant buzz of insects in the shelter but it was still a good day to be on the AT.","Blue Mountain Shelter
",Tray Mountain Shelter,"Jul 24, Thu",8.10
Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/469268,"In my sleep last night, I felt something on my cheek. I brushed my hand across the side of my face thinking I would be brushing my hair out of my face, and I displaced a small, warm furry body of some sort. Mouse? Bat? I don't know, but I pulled the drawstring cord of my sleeping bag and situated my pillow in the small opening that was left and settled for breathing my own stale air for the rest of the night. I could hear bats or birds winging their way through the shelter whenever I was awake in the night. THEN, something heavy enough to move the rocks around the campfire area woke us both up at some point. It was hard to relax enough to go back to sleep after all that.
We were up before 7:00am, but still not on the trail before 9:00am. Through the morning we crossed paths with a group of five SOBOs, then a solo SOBO, then two trail maintainers weed-whacking on Kelly's Knob. That was a steep mile ascent with lots of rest stops for me. On the top finally, I broke out in Karen Carpenter's ""I'm on the Top of the World"", though not quite as good as she sang it. After lunch and rehydrating there, I was hoping for an easier second half of the day. I got some pictures of some interesting mushrooms and flowers today, as well as some shots from the top of Kelly's Knob.
There were no usable water sources for the afternoon, so we had to ration our water. It was great to get to Dicks Creek Gap at US 76 and finally get more water. We decided to fix our Mountain House meals and eat our supper at the picnic tables there. While we were relaxing there, a van stopped and a guy bounded up the steps to our table. It was Sir Packs-a-Lot. I had read of him in some trail journals and knew he was from my hometown of Conyers, GA. He now operates the Top of Georgia hostel in Hiawassee and stops at the Gap often to shuttle hikers to the hostel. It was good to meet and talk to him, and even though we didn't need to stay at his hostel, he graciously agreed to take our trash bags for us. 
After we ate, we hiked past Cowart Gap where we had intended to camp and on to the top of Buzzard Knob for a total of 14.1 miles. It was a cool and windy night at 3750 elevation so I was glad for my warm cozy tent. I was not happy to notice two more blisters on my poor aching feet.","Tray Mountain Shelter
",Buzzard Knob,"Jul 25, Fri",14.10
Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/469269,"We crossed the GA-NC state line, then stopped at Bly Gap .1 mile into NC for lunch and water refills at a great piped stream. It was a warm, clear day; we have had no rain for two whole days now thankfully. We crossed paths with a father/son hiking team, a solo hiker, a young couple, and two more trail maintainers today. I am very thankful for the many volunteers who trim and maintain the trail so that hikers can use it. After lunch we took pictures of a very unusual twisted tree just inside NC. We had a series of two steep inclines leading up to Courthouse Bald, but then the rest of the day was not so difficult.
I discovered that I had poison ivy on both hands. I probably got it from retrieving the bear bag rope in the dark after missing the branch I was aiming for in the dark and having to reel the rope back in to throw it again and again. Having poison ivy could be a really aggravating out here in the woods where I cannot treat it. 
My sons and I watched a tv show this past year about infomercials for crazy things. One of them was for a band that hikers could put around themselves and a tree to help make squatting in the woods for potty breaks easier. At the time it sounded ridiculous, but now ..... I thought I just might be interested in trying one.
We got to lighten our loads again by dropping off our trash at the receptacles at Deep Gap at US 71. We did not reach our shelter until 8:30pm, so it was a rush to fix dinner, eat, and hang the bear bags. There were no cables for bear bags and no privy.  We saw a bunny at the shelter and one mouse right before we turned in for the night.
This stop marked the half-way point of this trek. I missed my daily showers, soap, shampoo, and clean clothes, and I was over the novelty of using the woods for my bathroom necessities.  I was still glad to be hiking on the AT.","Buzzard Knob
",Standing Indian Shelter,"Jul 26, Sat",13.60
Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/469270,"It took me about twenty minutes to treat and bandage all the blisters and sore spots on my feet in the morning. Then I laid out all my remaining food and divided it up into what I could eat for each meal between now and when Iris' husband meets us at Wayah Bald with our next resupply boxes. It didn't look like much, but it would have to work because it was all I had. I was not going to starve, but I would need to be careful not to run out of food. I had been eating much more on the trail than I thought I would be eating.
We had some great views and got some great pictures from Standing Indian Mountain this morning. The cool breezes helped us hike down into Beech Gap to a great water source, which seemed really far off the trail, even though it wasn't marked as such in AWOL's guide. Then we passed several other streams right on the trail that would have worked just as well. Oh well! 
Unfortunately I had diarrhea three times today. I finally got out the Immodium and took two doses. Thankfully I felt better quickly and was back to normal by lunch time. 
We only crossed paths with two other guys day-hiking today. We reached Betty Creek Gap before 5:00pm. We had intended to camp there. We rested and ate there and also met a young couple with a one-year-old there who had just hiked in to see the Appalachian Trail. They graciously agreed to take our trash bags out with them. Thanks y'all. We decided it was too early to stop for the day, so we kept going to Mooney Gap at USFS 83. We ate, hung our bear bags, and were in tents for the night by 8:10pm. 
Tomorrow morning would be a steep, tricky ascent up Albert Mountain, which would mark 100 miles of trail for us! We needed a good night's rest to be ready!","Standing Indian Shelter
",Mooney Gap,"Jul 27, Sun",12.10
Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/469271,"So much for needing a good night's sleep! I woke up in the midst of a horrific thunderstorm about 2:00am. We were camped under tree cover, but the rain was pelting my tent like crazy. Lightning was flashing, thunder was crashing, and the ground was shaking! It lasted over an hour. I was so thankful for a warm, cozy tent and very thankful that a tree did not fall on me during the storm!
It was hard packing up in the morning, with everything, everywhere so wet. We decided to skip a regular breakfast and just eat granola bars on the trail. In just 1.4 miles we were on top of Albert Mountain. The last .3 mile was like hiking back from the Wilds' Fourth Falls, only with no rope hand holds and with a 30 pound pack on my back! There were scrambles over rocks, grabbing roots and trees for support. We had to collapse our trekking poles and attach them to our packs because they were of no use. Iris had done this section before and had offered to go to the top, drop her pack, and come back to take my pack from me, to help me out, but I managed to get to the top on my own, several minutes after she did. What an accomplishment!!
It was VERY WINDY at 5250 elevation, but I did get cell service and was able to call my husband for a few minutes. We took pictures from the top of the fire tower and ate breakfast and relaxed. Iris also talked to her husband who was planning to meet us at Wayah Bald tomorrow. He asked if we wanted him to bring us Subway sandwiches and we jumped at the offer and gave him our orders. 
The rest of the day was ""less difficult"" thankfully. From Rock Gap we called Budget Inn in Franklin, NC to try to arrange a shuttle to pick us up at Winding Stair Gap so we could stay in town for the night. The hotel only provides shuttles during thru-hiker season, but they gave us a name and number to call for a possible shuttle driver. Thankfully Beverly answered and agreed to meet us that afternoon at Winding Stair Gap. She picked us up, took us to a Chinese buffet for dinner, took us to WalMart, and then graciously asked us to stay at her house instead of the hotel.   We showered and did laundry, while she played the piano. (She is her church pianist.) We loved the fellowship time with her. She was a true trail angel!!
I enjoyed sleeping in a nice clean bed for the first time in ten days! I realized how thankful I am to have had this two week opportunity to hike on the AT. I have come to realize that although I do want to backpack more, I don't think I want to spend the next ten years trying to complete the whole trail. I think I would rather enjoy shorter times on the trail, without having to obsess about completing long sections so I can finish the whole thing before I am too old. I think one week might be my limit in the future. I have pushed myself to my limits on this trek and enjoyed it, I might be giving up the goal of finishing the whole trail.","Mooney Gap

Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/469272,"I woke up refreshed and clean about 4:40am and could not go back to sleep. I charged my phone, checked emails and facebook, sent texts out to my family, and kept my feet elevated.   After breakfast and packing, Beverly drove us back Winding Stair Gap by 10:00am where she had picked us up the day before. We hiked mostly uphill 4.2 miles to Siler Bald where we had lunch about noon. It didn't take long before our freshly laundered clothes were just as sweaty as they had been the day before. At lunch I had to take off my shoes and socks and elevate my feet to rest them. By midafternoon, my blisters were causing so much pain that I changed into my Teva sandals and finished the day hiking in them. Hiking in the Tevas was much easier on my toes, but much harder on my soles and calves.We crossed paths today with a group of nine college freshman from Bowling Green Ohio. They said they were hiking south to their vehicle at Rock Gap. We had seen a large white van there earlier and wondered if it was for a school group out hiking. We also chatted with a teacher from Florida who was enjoying her last week of summer break by hiking to Siler Bald. We met two older guys dayhiking southbound and two other ladies backpacking southbound. There was also a family of four out on one of the USFS roads we crossed. I think seeing 18 people in one day was a record for us. A couple of days, we have not seen a single person on the trail for the entire day.We stayed between 4000-5000 elevation for the afternoon as we made our way to Wayah Bald, where Iris' husband was to meet us with our next resupply boxes. We thoroughly enjoyed the foot-long Subway sandwiches he brought us; it was the first time I had ever eaten an entire foot-long by myself. Hiking sure works up my appetite! It was great to use the real restrooms there too. There were beautiful views from the stone tower at Wayah Bald, but it was way too cool and windy for us to camp there like we had originally planned. We went through our resupply boxes and packed our new supply of food in our backpacks. It was very tempting to end our hike while we had a getaway vehicle, but we decided to finish what we started.
We hiked another .9 mile downhill to the Wayah Bald Shelter. I managed to get the bear bag rope over the tree limb on the second try tonight - a new record.   Since we had the shelter all to ourselves, I set my tent up inside it to let it dry out and air out, and also to keep small creatures from crawling on my face during the night. The night got fairly cold and Iris said she slept in every layer she had with her, even her rain pants. I was nice and cozy in my tent inside the shelter.","Winding Stair Gap

Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/469273,"Having a dry tent dry made packing much easier. Things compact better and weigh less when they are dry. Even still, we were moving slowly and didn't get on the trail until almost 10:00am.
The terrain made hiking less difficult, except for the fact that my left little toe was digging into its neighbor and killing me with every downhill step. We had a nice lunch at Cold Spring Shelter. It was a tiny shelter; but it was right on the trail, and it had a privy and a great stream for water. I changed into my Tevas at lunch again and wore them for the rest of the day for some relief.
We crossed paths with yet another group of college kids, a dayhiking couple with their 12-year-old daughter and dog, and a father/12-year-old son team (PacMan and PacMan Jr.), all of whom were heading southbound.
I got cell phone reception from the observation tower on top of Wesser Bald and was able to talk to my husband again, as well as my daughter and granddaughter. 
I cut up two of my cheddar cheese sticks and added them to a Mountain House Chili Mac and Beef dinner along with some of Susan's crushed Fritos. It made a very satisfying dinner. I liked being able to add boiling water right into the foil bag, seal it to let it rehydrate, and eat it right out of the bag. I only used my stove for boiling water, so I didn't have any dishes to wash. I can't believe these dinners were supposed to be TWO servings though. I had no problem eating a whole bag, so I doubt a whole bag would fill up a young male hiker. 
Since we were at a shelter by ourselves again, I set up my tent inside the shelter again, to keep me warmer and to keep out little critters.","Wayah Bald Shelter

Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/469274,"We left Wesser Bald Shelter about 9:15am and hiked 4.9 miles almost all downhill to A. Rufus Morgan Shelter by noon. It was a nice shelter, but it had no table. It did have a nice stream for water. We ate lunch and rested there.
I got stung by a bee this morning on my wedding ring finger. I immediately began tugging and twisting my ring and finally got it off. My finger and hand was really swollen. ouch!
We only had one more mile to hike downhill after lunch to get to the Nantahala Outdoor Center. It seemed surreal to step out of the woods, cross a busy street, and be in the middle of so many people and so much traffic and noise. We really enjoyed using real restrooms. I used Susan's poison ivy cleanser to wash my hands and arms in the restroom too. I bought a Hershey bar with almonds, a pack of fruit-flavored lifesavers, and a Mountain House scrambled eggs and bacon meal. Susan bought a new headlamp. 
We left the NOC and started a very long uphill stretch of trail. It was four miles to a spring, but there was nowhere to get off the trail and camp, so we kept going and going . . . uphill . . . another two miles to the top of Swim Bald. It was a long exhausting day and by the time we set up camp, we actually ate in the dark. 11.7 miles may not sound like much and I was completely spent, but it was still great to be on the AT.","Wesser Bald Shelter

Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/469275,"Today I realized I only had one more night on the trail. On the one hand, I was ready to be done with the hike. On the other hand, I didn't want it to end.  We slept in after yesterday's grueling hike out of Nantahala Gorge. We got on the trail late and then stopped .9 mile away at Sassafras Gap Shelter to use the privy and to get water and eat some snacks. I enjoyed reading the trail journal there. It was almost noon before we left, and we had almost 9 miles left before our intended shelter for the night.
We only saw one southbounder who started at Katahdin and was almost finished with his thru-hike. I bet he had some great stories to tell, but he was in thru-hiker mode and didn't waste much time talking before he kept on hiking.  At Stecoah Gap at NC 143 a nice girl took our pictures by an Appalachian Trail sign for us. She also agreed to take our trash bags for us. I am really thankful for the many people who have been willing to do this little act of kindness for us and lighten our loads a little.
Even though today was a shorter mileage day, we got a late start and took long breaks mid-morning and for lunch. Consequently, by the time we got to Jacob's Ladder, it was already supper time. It was aptly named, because it really did feel like we were going to hike straight up into Heaven. IT WAS A LONG, STEEP STRETCH OF TRAIL!
Just as we finally got to the end of Jacob's Ladder, the rain started.   A gentle rain actually feels good after hard hiking, but this rain was pouring and pelting us for the last .2 mile to the shelter. We tried jogging, which I'm sure would have been comical to see with our thirty pound backpacks bouncing up and down with each step. Since it was getting dark already, it was got cooler quickly. I was totally exhausted by the time we made it to the shelter, made dinner, and got things ready for bed. Iris went to fill her water bottles and returned to let me know there was a great spring, but there was a steep trail to get to it. I was too tired and decided to wait until morning and hope I was refreshed by then. After we ate, Iris took my water bottles back to the spring and filled them for me. I was so thankful for her act of service for me!
The rain let up some as we were getting ready for bed. I had cell service and was able to text my husband and talk to my daughter for a few minutes. The rain returned in the night with a vengeance. It pelted the tin roof all night, while lightning flashed, and thunder crashed around us. Branches and acorns sure can make a lot of noise on a tin shelter roof! Even the sleep-aid I took and the ear plugs I used did not help much. It was a long night and I was thankful to be in a shelter.","Swim Bald

Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/469276,"It was still raining lightly when we woke up this morning. We were 13 miles away from the Fontana Dam Visitor Center where we would meet our husbands and return to the civilized world.
We hiked 6.1 miles to Cable Gap Shelter and had lunch there. We chatted with a couple of southbound guys who were eating lunch there when we arrived - a young teacher/coach from Plant City FL and a 15-year old guy. We stopped there after them and left before them.
We made pretty good time from the shelter to Fontana because it was mostly downhill. It was wet though, and the slippery rocks were our nemesis today. I was the first to slip and fall. I scraped my right shin, banged my right elbow, and landed on my backpack like an overturned turtle. It took some doing to right myself. Later Iris fell on a tough rock scramble. I fell a second time later in the afternoon, this time banging my left knee and left elbow.   I guess I will be taking home some souvenirs to help me remember my last day on the trail.
We finally crossed NC 28 and headed toward Fontana Dam Shelter. We stopped at the HUGE shelter to enter our last trail register entry and then headed toward the Visitor Center. It was uncomfortable hiking on the asphalt in the sun after being in the woods on the trail for two weeks. 
What a relief to walk down a hill and see our husbands waiting there for us! We did it!

Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/469856,"It was wonderful to reach our hotel room, shower, get dressed in clean clothes, and go out for dinner. Eating from the salad bar was a real treat, and our pizza was a welcome change from granola bars and dehydrated meals. As soon as dinner was over, I was ready for bed.
Getting in the car the next day to drive home was a little like being on an amusement park ride. Going 60 mph on windy mountain roads was just too big of a change from the previous two week 1-2 mph speed.
My husband and I stopped at NOC and Winding Stair Gap just so he could walk onto the AT a few feet and experience the immediate change from the ""real world"" to the quietness of the trail.
It was weird finally being back in my own home after two weeks on the trail. There were so many options when I needed to dress and eat. It was a bit overwhelming. 
I learned a lot about backpacking ahead of time from attending Warren Doyle's Appalachian Trail Institute. I learned a lot by reading numerous books and online trail journals. People at REI were very helpful as I was shopping for gear. I was really happy with the REI tent, backpack, sleeping pad, pillow, stove and fuel, and the dehydrated meals I bought. My sleeping bag, rain poncho, and other odds and ends came from WalMart and worked just fine. My new hiking shoes seemed to fit well when I wore them before the hike, but I did have problems with blisters during the hike. Maybe due to rain, maybe I needed a half size bigger, I don't know. I plan to take them back to REI and see what they recommend. They have very knowledgeable employees and also advertise a great return/exchange policy, so we'll see what happens.
One of the first things I did Monday morning was call my foot doctor. I wanted a professional to look at my poor toes. Thankfully, none were infected. Her advice was to soak in Epsom salts and keep the blisters covered in Neosporin and bandages. After this treatment and a few days wearing flip-flops instead of hiking shoes, they were looking and feeling much better.
I lost 7-8 pounds during my fifteen days on the AT. What a weightnumber loss plan! LOL There is absolutely no way to carry enough food to replace the calories burned while backpacking. I slowly began gaining a few pounds once I had access to such a wonderful variety of food all day.  I was sad to learn that James Garner and Pete Van Wieren both died while I was on the trail. They will be missed them.
I spent the week catching up on home chores, shopping, and recuperating. I made another trip to REI. The only item from my hike that I wanted to replace was my spork. Nothing was really wrong with the one I used, but I bought a longer handled spoon to make eating out of Mountain House bags much easier.
After one week home, I lost my first toenail. Two more would come off within the week.  The finger that was stung by the bee was finally back to normal and I could wear my wedding rings again. My poison ivy all dried up. I still had some bruises on my elbows, shin, and knee; but they began to fade. The memories of my hike will be with me much longer, and I am so very thankful for the opportunity to have spent time on the Appalachian Trail. I have begun planning my next hike for the fall.","Fontana Dam Visitor Shelter

After 38 years, I will be hiking the same stretch of AT that I hiked in 1976 with my high school classmates. After that trip, while staying in Gatlinburg, we heard a bluegrass group singing, ""Don't let the Smoky Mountain smoke get in your eyes, If you do, I'm telling you, You'll want to live there for the rest of your life, Once that Smoky Mountain smoke gets in your eyes."" I haven't been able to live there all my life, but the Smokies have been pulling me back for many years now.This will be a different kind of hike. The weather will be cooler.

This was a shorter section hike than our last section, only 72 miles, and we had decided it would be less difficult to hike southbound into Fontana Dam, rather than northbound. 
There are a lot of rules for hiking in the Smokies. First, we had to get a permit. We are not allowed to tent. We had to register for a specific shelter each night. On the plus side, I could leave my tent at home and that made my pack 3 pounds lighter; my beginning pack weight for the hike, with food and water, was only 27.6 pounds. Also, every shelter we were scheduled for had a privy.   
We started at Davenport Gap at 11:00. We had a short mileage day of only 7.7 miles. The first 4.8 were pretty much all uphill, then about 2.1 downhill, then another .8 uphill stretch to the shelter.   There were many people on the trail: section hikers, day hikers, SOBOs, a ridge runner, even six on horseback!! With all their rules for hikers, I never expected horseback riding to be allowed! It was beautiful weather for hiking...during the day.
But...at bedtime, I forgot to take ibuprofen and sleep-aid. I also forgot to brush my teeth. There were eight of us in the shelter. Two snored all night. Everyone but me got up to pee at least once in the night, maybe twice for some. I did not sleep much. Plus, it was cold. I was warm enough except for my feet.   I forgot to change socks at bedtime, and the socks I wore all day were a little sweaty and damp and made my feet cold.","Davenport Gap

After beginning with another uphill stretch, we leveled out on a ridge for most of the day. We passed some volunteers doing trail maintenance in the afternoon; I am so thankful for all those who volunteer their time and effort to keep the trail usable. We also passed a section where we could see plane wreckage from a military exercise gone wrong, right off the trail. It was windy, but sunny. We got to our shelter by 3:30 and enjoyed getting water, having dinner, and hanging bear bags leisurely. We were glad to be in a spacious shelter when the rain began.

When we were on the sunny side of the ridge, all was fine; when we were not, it was much cooler. There were gorgeous views today, Eagle Rocks, Bradley View, and others.
Linda started having back pain and also pain in her feet due to her plantar fasciitis. She had to take it very slowly.
We were passed by several SOBOs finishing their thru-hikes. They had been on the AT for 5+ months already and were in great shape, moving fast, and looking forward to finishing at Springer in just a couple of weeks. I looked forward to hearing their stories at the shelter at night.
Susan hiked ahead of us, intending to take the side trail to Charles Bunion and meet back up with us. When Linda and I finally made it to the trail turn-off, we found Susan's note that she had already been there, did the side trail, and left for the shelter. 
Linda and I stopped for water at a nice spring right before the shelter and it was after dark when we made it the rest of the way up to Icewater Springs Shelter. A fire had already been started in the fireplace of the shelter which was a real blessing. We ate in the dark and crawled into our sleeping bags for the night.

Last year, we did not meet very many other females on the trail. Carrie and Alyssa left before us, but we caught up with them at Brown Gap. They had received some bad news and were waiting for a shuttle to take them off the trail. We prayed with them and then parted. We had a couple steep sections in the morning, but we took our time and rested frequently for snacks and water. Just before Max Patch, it began raining. We took our time getting water, eating lunch, and resting in the cover of the woods until it seemed the rain had passed. About half-way up Max Patch, the rain returned with a vengeance. We got our ponchos out quickly. There were a couple bolts of lightning way too close for comfort on the exposed bald; we couldn't get down from there fast enough. The views were still great in spite of the rain but we didn't slow down to take pictures. Later, we heard that recently a young man had planned to propose to his girlfriend after climbing Max Patch but lightning struck them and she was killed there. How tragic!  It stopped raining a while later and the sun tried to come out, but the trail was mushy and full of puddles. We got to Roaring Fork Shelter early in the afternoon and enjoyed a leisurely supper. This shelter was donated by the Mountain Marching Mamas in 1989, but was replaced in 2005 for some reason. I'll be interested in researching that to find out why. We hung our wet clothes and wet backpacks to dry and chatted with Cracker Jack from Springfield MA (a middle aged male section hiker who only has two small sections left to be finished with the whole AT) and Sandy from PA (who section hikes 300-400 miles each year). We were joined later by Pink (pink dyed hair) and Stink from Texas and Utah who both just graduated from Emory in Atlanta and later by another young make hiker, all of whom will be pushing the 18 miles into Hot Springs tomorrow while Susan and I break that trek into two days. It was a relaxing afternoon and we were in bed by 8:00 when it started raining again. Thankful to be in a shelter instead of the tent. Thankfully there was no cramping in my legs today.

I had told Susan I would wait for her at that shelter if she hadn't already caught up to me, but she caught me about halfway up Walnut Mountain.It was a tiny shelter, but it had a picnic table, so even though it wasn't 11:00 yet, we sat and ate. There was a privy there, so it seemed a shame not to use. It had no door; that was a first for me. Stink and Pink caught up with us there and we leapfrogged with them and Sandy from PA the rest of the day. 
It rained once enough for us to stop and put on our ponchos, and again once after we took them off; the second time not so long thankfully. Rain does cool things off, but getting soaked then makes you too cold. 
We crossed many lovely streams today. It is soothing to hear the waer flowing and they are vital sources of drinking water for us. We made it over a no-name mountain and into Deer Park Mountain Shelter before 6:00. We were joined by SOBOs Rick and his son Rick from Cleveland OH on the first day of their first ever backpacking adventure. They had lots of questions about hiking, gear, etc. 
 We thought our tiny shelter would be crowded when Bahalla-na (Guinea for whatever may come) joined us, but he quickly set up his tent. It began raining around seven and we had to retreat to the cover of the tiny shelter. We finished eating, stringing up bear bags, talking, watching the rain, and finally turned in about 8:30. A few minutes later Thundercat strolled in. Some friends had offered to slack pack her and she still had to hike 3 more miles by headlamp in the pouring rain into Hot Springs. After a quick cigarette and chat with us to catch up, she took off. 
As I listened to the rain and thunder, I prayed for her safety as I was falling asleep - safe, dry, and warm.

A creepy guy showed up walking with a beautiful Weimaraner. He asked way too many questions about our plans for hiking, and we were deliberately vague. We started the 3.2 mile downhill trek into Hot Springs and never saw him again thankfully. On the way we met SOBOs, Turbo and Turtle, a couple of 70-ish section hikers from Peachtree Corners GA coming up the trail. They said they would be 92 by the time they completed the trail. Gotta love hiking to do that!
We got our resupply boxes from the post office in Hot Springs and sat in rocking chairs on the porch of Hiker Ridge Ministries Resource Center repacking our packs, watching hikers and town folk pass by, just like Mayberry. I was glad to see Thundercat walking down the street in freshly washed clothes. I was relieved to know that she made it safely to town through the night's storm. Susan and I both still had food left in our packs and were packing our new food from our resupply boxes, so we shared some with her, rather than carrying the extra weight

We had lunch at Spring Creek Tavern outside on their deck overlooking the creek. It was a restful spot and the best bacon cheeseburger I have ever had. The fries and spring mix, carrot, and cucumber salad were also a welcome change from camp food. Our waitress brought our own pitcher of water to our table and still had to refill it twice for us. After a long, leisurely lunch and three trips to the restroom, Sue's friend Janet joined us there to hike with us for the next two days. 
 
The hike out of town was steep as usual, and our packs were full from our resupply, but we had nice views of the town and the French Broad River from several spots. Along the way we enjoyed talking with some SOBO German day hikers with interesting accents on our way uphill. There was a wonderful strategically placed bench by an old mill pond by Pump Gap Loop Trail. The water there smelled and tasted of sulphur but it was a nice place to rest and enjoy the serenity of the view. 
We tented in Tanyard Gap close to the U.S. 25/70 overpass where Janet's car was parked so we left our packs in her car for the night instead of having to rig our own bear bags in the trees.

Another car parked next to Janet's car about 2:30 am and the doors were opened and shut multiple times. I assumed there were multiple  people.We slept in until about 8:30. In the morning we saw a fairly large tent in the hollow right below us, again assuming there were several campers in it. We ate our breakfast in the gravel parking area and we're surprised to meet the lone camper, ChewHawk, when he came out to his car. He is driving his car along the trail and slack packing himself up the trail and then back to his car for the night each day. Then the next day he moves his car to another spot farther up the trail and does the same thing. Since he isn't carrying it on his back all day, he enjoys the luxury of the large tent.
Janet left her tent and sleeping bag in her car and graciously offered to carry some of our food in her own pack for the day since Susan and I had such full packs. We hiked up to Rich Mountain Lookout Tower and had a long leisurely lunch there, with gentle breezes and gorgeous views. 
ChewHawk drove into Hot Springs for breakfast and back to Tanyard Gap and still caught up with us at the tower. We learned that he recently graduated from college with a degree in photography. He took pictures of the three of us on top of the tower. Sandy from PA joined us too. The tower would have been a fun place to camp.
At Hurricane Gap we had to take our food bags back from Janet so she could hike back to her car to go home. We continued to Spring Mountain Shelter and met Sandy and ChewHawk there again. She hiked on north and he left to return south to his car again. 
Since we got a late start and took a long break at the tower, this was a short day for us. Since it was earlier than we normally stop, I had time to gather wood and coax a campfire into life. I always enjoy a campfire.
We were joined by Len, his grandson Haven, and granddaughter Jessica (a UK student) from TN and then Jolly and Roger, a young couple from Boston doing big daily miles. Pink and Stink also arrived about 8:00. Haven showed me his hammock and how it worked. It is much lighter than a tent so it was interesting to see it .

They had just recently bought the old place and were remodeling before moving in. Peggy graciously shared filtered water with us. Thank you Peggy!
It was a 3.3 uphill climb to Little Laurel Shelter and we crossed paths with several SOBOs. We ate lunch in the shade in the grass by the shelter with Sandy from PA and Pink and Stink. 
We still had 1.3 uphill before 5.8 more or less downhill to Chestnut Log Gap and Jerry Cabin Shelter. Along the way we had great views from Whiterock Cliff. It poured on us a couple times in the afternoon so I chose to take the bad weather bypass trail around the rocky and strenuous Firescald Knob. Everyone else enjoyed the views from Firescald Knob but I made the right decision for me. It was a lonely afternoon hike for me since everyone else was on the other trail.
We all got to the shelter wet and tired. Then it rained some more. Jolly and Roger, Pink and Stink, and Sandy from PA are all here. SOBOs Redbeard and a friend also joined us.

We hiked through Bald Ridge (chest high wild grasses wet from the rain) and up Big Butt Mountain and finally found a spot off the trail to stop for breakfast right by a large split rock formation (the Big Butt??).

I didn't feel up to heating a dehydrated meal for dinner so I ate tuna packets with extra mayo, peanut butter crackers, and dried fruit. I began feeling better once I was warm and full. Like most shelters, this one has a privy, but it is only three sided. There is no door; at least it is facing away from the shelter! I guess the builders wanted us to be able to enjoy the views while we used it? It was so full that Sue even took a stick and tried to knock down the tower. Yuk!We were asleep by 9:00.","Jerry Cabin Shelter

Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/502246,"We took our time getting ready this morning. Pink and Stink left before us, and then Woofie and Wooly Booly left before us too. Sandy from PA had camped nearby and came through while we were still at the shelter. We passed a couple of girls hiking southbound early, Coyote and Haiku. I am still surprised at how many females we are seeing this year on the trail compared to last year. We leapfrogged with Sandy from PA and Woofie and Wooly Booly. It's always fun to see familiar faces on the trail.   
Right before Sam's Gap I stopped to read a large stone monument from Atlanta's Moye family who had previously owned this tract of land. There were Bible verses by each family member's name. I think I should try to track them down once I am back home near Atlanta and thank them for their part in my AT adventure.
We got to Sam's Gap at I-26 about 10:30. I was looking forward to throwing my trash away there and was disappointed not finding trashcans there as AWOL had noted in his guide. Thankfully the parking lot was full and I saw a young couple getting into their truck. I asked them if they could do me a big favor. They graciously took my gallon Ziploc bag full of four days of food wrappers. They were thankful that I had not asked them for a ride, and I was thankful my pack was a pound or so lighter.
Some areas of rock scrambling made the already steep uphills even tougher, but we were rewarded with beautiful wildflowers and 360 degree views from Big Bald at 5516 feet above sea level. Big Stamp was pretty too. There was cell service there too, so I got to talk to my husband for a few minutes. I haven't had service as often on this stretch as I had in North Georgia last year.
Sandy from PA was the only other one at the shelter with us this evening, just ""we three wives who left our husbands at home to come backpacking"". After we had settled in and had our dinner, a father and his 12 year old son stumbled in. They were tenting so we still had the shelter to ourselves.
There was a paperback Bible in this shelter, so Sandy from PA looked up her favorite backpacking verse and shared it with us.   Deuteronomy 23:13 gives the Israelites instructions for relieving themselves outside the camp while they were wandering through the wilderness. Sandy likes to share it with other hikers who do not follow the protocol of digging proper catholes. Gotta love trail talk.  
We were really excited about being in town the next night. Showers, shampoo, beds, town food, and flush toilets are just of a few of the things that I miss while on the trail.","Hogback Ridge Shelter

Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/502261,"We got up with the birds and were packed and out of camp by 6:30. Morning light was just barely filtering through the heavy tree cover as I fell in behind Susan on the trail. I am not usually a morning person but the incentives of town food, showers, and beds are great motivators. 
After just a few minutes on the trail, we stopped in our tracks when we heard some loud crashing to our right. By the time I looked up, the crashing had continued to our left. Susan, being in front of me, had looked up soon enough to see the back end of a bear crossing the path in front of us and heading back into the woods. If we hadn't been awake before, we were both FULLY awake by then!
We stopped about 8:30 and had our breakfast. Sandy from PA caught up with us there and passed us. She has been having some foot problems and found out a friend from home was in Erwin and could take her home if she could make it there today. She was originally planning to split the hike to town into two days, but has decided to make it in one day like us. 
Our morning was generally downhill and we were making good time heading to Spivey Gap, where the AT crosses US19. There weren't any good water sources though and we had drank almost all our water. As we neared Spivey Gap there was a group of day hikers coming up the trail, and we asked them how far we were to a water source. They informed us that there was trail magic at the Gap if we hurried. That got us moving faster!""Trail magic"" is something unexpected that someone does for a hiker along the trail. Most trail magic happens when the ""thru hiker bubble"" is in the area.  My section hikes haven't coincided with that bubble, so this was one of my first experiences. I think it would be fun to pick a gap, take a grill and cooler, and provide trail magic myself some time.
Rob Bird used to operate the Bird Cage hostel in Maine but has now moved to Unicoi, GA. His kids Sharp Knife and Hiccup thru hiked a couple of years ago.   They were all at the gap with cold drinks and snacks. I am not normally a soda drinker but I thoroughly enjoyed a Mountain Dew and a strawberry soda. I haven't had a soda in years, but those two hit the spot. We even got to sit on folding chairs while we visited. Sandy from PA was there too; she left before we did.
As we crossed the road and headed back into the woods, the van packed up and left. We were the last hikers they served,  and we had arrived just in time.
We walked along a nice stream with several cascades for quite a while. It was cool and refreshing listening to the water. We filled our water bottles and I wet my handkerchief. The cool water felt great on my neck, face, and arms as we heated up on the mile and half uphill section out of the gap. 
We made it to No Business Shelter about 3:00. It was our 2/3 mark for the day. A couple miles later we were in Temple Hill Gap with 3 1/2 miles to Erwin and I was running out of energy. The next uphill section seemed to drag on forever, but it was really only a mile or so. Every few minutes I was eating another fun-size Snickers for energy. 
After finally reaching the final rise, we had two more steep downhill sections. Glimpses of town and train whistles and traffic teased us long before we actually reached Erwin. Just as we got to the road, we saw Sandy from PA about a quarter mile ahead of us down the road, we tried calling out to her, but she didn't hear us. We never saw her again. We crossed the road and sat on the bridge over the Nolichucky River and waited for Sue's friend Ellen to pick us up and drive us to her home in Mar's Hill.
After hiking 16.4 miles and then riding a half hour or so in the car, we were so stiff, we could barely get out of the car. It was great to shower and wash our clothes.   Ellen and her husband fixed a delicious dinner of pork loin with plum sauce, mashed potatoes, peas, and spinach and then brought out banana ice cream with caramel sauce. What a welcome change from rehydrated trail meals!
I was able to recharge my phone and chat with my husband and with my daughter before I fell into bed for the night.","Bald Mountain Shelter

After driving back to Ellen's home, I took a nap, worked on uploading some of my trail journals, facetimed with my granddaughter, and talked with my husband on the phone.

Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/502263,"Ellen drove us back to Erwin in the morning and we were back on the trail by 8:30, heading uphill as is the case most of the time after being in a town. The uphill out of Erwin wasn't as steep as some are, but it was long. We made it to Curley Maple Gap Shelter by 11:30 and had an early lunch. There we met Dan and his son Mason slackpacking southbound back to Uncle Johnny's hostel in Erwin where they had stayed the night before. I told them I had a son-in-law named Daniel and a grandson named Mason.Afer lunch we followed a nice strem for over a mile. It was picturesque with many cascades, and the sound of it was soothing as we hiked. There were several footbridges over it and many easy places to refill our water bottles.After Indian Grave Gap, there was a long, winding uphill stretch to Beauty Spot, which I did not think was nearly as beautiful as Max Patch or Big Bald. The hike uphill was exposed and today was pretty hot, so maybe I just wasn't in a mood to appreciate it.We had intended to camp shortly after coming down from the Beauty Spot, but the water source was dry and there ""Bear Activity in Area"" signs posted, so we kept hiking. We finally found water a mile later, but there were more ""Bear Activity"" signs so we kept hiking up and over Unaka Mountain to the Cherry Gap Shelter. We finally arrived at dusk. Our 12.7 mile day turned into a 17.5 mile day, and I was beat. What a welcome back to the trail after a day off in town!We caught up with Pink and Stink at the shelter. We also met ""Stick"" after reading his trail register entries for the past week. There were only four in the shelter so there was room for us. Others were in tents and in hammocks. There was no privy or bear cables, but at least we had company. It took us a few tries to get our rope over a suitable branch to hang our food bags. We were spoiled by the bear cables that were at so many of our previous campsites. By the time we ate, hung our food bags, fixed our sleeping areas, and turned off our headlamps, it was just after 10:00.","Erwin, TN

Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/502264,"After that long day yesterday, we slept in until 7:00. I had been too tired to fix a hot meal for supper last night and had just eaten sausage, cheese, crackers, and dried fruit. This morning I fixed a chicken rice meal and downed it all. I was moving pretty slowly after the long day, and everyone else had packed up and left before we did. 10:00 is a late record for leaving camp for us.During the morning hike, we crossed paths with a co-ed scouting group of 9 or 10 from Florida hiking southbound. We were all able to get water at a beautiful little waterfall. We drank what we had carried from the shelter and refilled our bottles.We leap-frogged all day with a couple who had tented at the same shelter where we stayed last night. They plan to hike to the same shelter we are aiming for tonight; it is always fun to see familiar faces.At 11:30 at Iron Mountain Gap at TN107 we caught up with a couple of guys who also had been at the shelter with us last night. One was being picked up there by his wife for a family reunion, and he offered to take our trash bags with him. We had an early lunch there, gave him our accumulated trash, and hiked on with packs a few ounces lighter. Mike would be hiking on alone and was heading to the same shelter we were headed to. We learned that Mike had retired after 30+ years at Lifeway Christian Bookstore.When we arrived at the shelter, Stick was there already. He is a RN from Iowa enjoying this year's section hike of the AT. He had a campfire going, so I helped scrounge up some fallen branches for firewood. Another couple was at the shelter with their college-aged daughter. They said they had been section hiking a few days each year since the daughter was in fourth grade. They joked about whether that was considered quality family time or child abuse. Mike joined us in the shelter a short time later. The other couple from last night's shelter was in the area also, but they set up their tent and we didn't see them much.I sure did enjoy sitting around the campfire after doing my camp chores. I always love a good fire!","Cherry Gap Shelter

Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/502265,"Stick stayed up at the fire until around midnight and came into the shelter with his headlamp blazing. Charles had warned us that he was a heavy snorer and he was true to his word all night long. I didn't get much sleep and was ready to get up about 5:45. We packed up and got on the trail in record time. After a steep uphill mile to the top of Little Rock Knob and two downhill miles, we stopped for breakfast in Hughes Gap. Mike caught up to us and ate with us. He left before us and we never saw him again.After rationing water on a seemingly never ending three mile uphill stretch, we stopped at a campsite at Ash Gap for lunch and water. Water was supposedly only .1 east of the trail downhill. It seemed much longer than .1 going downhill to the water, and even longer coming back uphill. 
The couple who had tented near us the last two nights caught up with us while we ate lunch and rested there. They are Soul Food and Jumpstart from New Jersey. They have hiked the trail in their home area and now are hiking north from Springer back toward their home. Then they plan to get to Katahdin and finish the trail southbound. 
My 2014 guidebook said it was only 1.3 to the top of Roan Mountain, but we saw that the trail had recently been rerouted. This made the AT less steep but also added more mileage to the day's hike. I'm not sure which would be wore, the steeper uphill section or the more mileage?? Regardless, we hiked through dense red spruce forest with cedar club moss. It was cool and smelled like Christmas. I have been very thankful for the temperatures being cooler than yesterday.
The top of Roan Mountain has road access. It is always strange seeing cars and dozens of people in one place after being on the trail. The noise seems so much louder too. It was a real treat to use the restrooms, wash our hands with soap, look in a mirror, and get water from a fountain. Jumpstart and Soul Food were there too. Someone had given them a ride to the nearby Rhododendron Gardens which they really enjoyed.
There were lots of rocks to step on and climb over on the way up and down, which made things tricky at times. After passing Carver Gap, there were two long exposed climbs up Round Bald and Jane Bald. There was parking at Carver Gap and so there were many day hikers on the trail there. We got to see the gorgeous Gray's red lilies in bloom on this section; we were told they only bloom one week each year and we just happened to be there at just the right time.
Susan twisted her ankle on this stretch. We rested at the summit of Grassy Bald and had our supper there. We had spotty cell service and were able to talk to our husbands briefly. While we ate, Soul Food and Jumpstart caught up to us again. We have enjoyed talking with them and hearing their story.
We got water shortly after the summit and had a generally downhill hike toward the shelters. We had considered hiking to Overmountain Shelter, which is a converted barn which sleeps 20. We decided to stop at the Stan Murray Shelter instead. It is much smaller and older, but also nearer. Jumpstart and Soul Food and stopped to tent before the shelter. This was the first time on this entire hike that we had been at a shelter by ourselves.   
We got our food bags hung and I had time to gather wood for a campfire. We were in bed for the night by 9:00, watching the fire as it died out. Then hundreds of fireflies put on a show for us. We were wakened in the night by terrific thunder, lightning, and rain. We were very thankful to be in the shelter.","Clyde Smith Shelter

We called our husbands from there and let them know our change of plans. Today's hike was not too strenuous, although there were several false summits going up Hump Mountain. 
Today we ran into the same large group of trail maintainers that we had talked to days ago. It is amazing that the whole 2200+ mile trail is maintained completely by volunteers who coordinate their efforts to keep the trail usable.
We finally passed the NC/TN border at Doll Flats. Then it was mostly downhill with several stretches of stone steps and plentiful streams down to US19E. We were only there a few minutes when Susan's husband arrived to pick us up. We drove into Roan Mountain just in time to get our boxes before the post office closed, and then we stopped at Subway for sandwiches.

We hiked .3 to the spot on the trail where we stopped last year and were ready to begin this year's hike.  Imagine our surprise when Janet recognized a caver friend who was waiting at this same spot for a ride to pick her up from the trail.  After chatting with Janet's friend, it was 2:15 before we got on the trail.  We hiked six miles or so, had dinner by Jones Falls, then continued hiking to a nice campsite along the Elk River.  I love camping beside running water and hearing the running water all night.

We got moving before 8:00 am.  The mountain laurel was in full bloom and we saw plenty.  Pink Ladies' slippers also bloomed in many places along the trail.  There was a great sheltered picnic area with restrooms by Watauga Lake at the Shook Branch Recreation Area where we stopped for lunch.. We enjoyed the picnic tables, flush toilets, bathroom sinks, and access to potable water.  Evidently there is more water in the lake than last season, because we noticed a few of the picnic tables were actually in the water this year.

We saw notices that there was bear activity in the area and that Watauga Lake Shelter was closed because of bear activity. Notices said no picnicking, loitering or overnight camping is allowed.   Nevertheless, we noticed two tents set up near the park.  Some people just aren't very smart.  

When Tagalong and Iris stopped to take pictures of more flowers they recognized, I continued hiking with Mariposa.  I knew they are stronger hikers than I am and that they would catch me sooner or later.  Mariposa is an ER nurse from out West.  She had wanted to hike the AT for years and actually went back to work for a time to be able to afford lightweight gear.  Now retired, her husband was slack packing her for a few days.  She was planning to meet her husband at Wilber Dam. Tagalong and Iris caught up with us there and the three of us hiked on to Vandeventer Shelter.

There was a German woman and a Swiss man there already.  When we noticed the mice getting bolder in broad daylight as we fixed our dinners, I decided to set up my tent and sleep without being bothered by them.  

Later a man arrived at the shelter with stories of a group of five hikers who had been charged by a bear at Watauga Lake Dam.  They had waited an hour or so and tried to pass again and got charged again.  Finally they banded together, waving their hiking poles, blowing their whistles, and yelling.  They had picked up rocks and sticks to throw at the bear if necessary.  Finally the bear left.  And this is why I do not want to hike alone!  There is truth to the ""safety in numbers"" adage and also in the saying, ""I don't have to outrun the bear, I just have to outrun my hiking partner.""  :)

As we ate, we were joined by a former Marine who had thru hiked a few years previous and was now a trail runner.  He was full of braggadocious stories that he assumed we would love to hear.  Wrong!  While we endured his self-promotion, we were joined by our Swiss shelter friend.  His knees were really bothering him and he decided to try to get a ride into town while he had the chance.  The long descent into town would not have been nice to his knees.  We wished him well and continued down the trail.

At some point we crossed paths with Odie who is the guy who puts together the Hike Yearbook annually.  He pulled out last year's yearbook from his pack and began to tell us all its merits.  He gave us each a sticker to remind us to email him a picture to be put into the yearbook and of course told us how we could order a copy for ourselves.

At the Hiker Inn we met a Canadian hiker who had come to hike the trail with her son.  At the border they had been questioned endlessly about their intentions and accused of trying to immigrate illegally.  They had to cancel their flight from Buffalo to Atlanta and return the next day to provide extra documentation to the border agents.  Eventually they were able to convince them that their intentions were legitimately to hike the AT and they were allowed into the US.  They decided to take the trail names Detained and Denied.  Now the mom was tending her problem feet in Damascus and the son was hiking farther north with a new group of friends.","Double Springs Shelter

We could hear several voices on the way to Rod Hollow Shelter around 5:00 and were concerned that it might be full and we would have to tent in the rain.  Thankfully it was a group of Boy Scouts.  They were on a preparation hike to get ready for their annual scouting competition at Philmont in Cimarron, New Mexico.  They  were doing their cooking and eating under the pavillion but they all had their tents set up.
There were only two guys from Wisconsin in the shelter, so there was plenty of room for us.  We got our water, made our warm dinner, and changed into warm dry clothes quickly.  I was in my sleeping bag journaling by 7:45 when Shooting Star a young Amish woman joined us in the shelter.","Manassas Gap Shelter

It was wonderful to finally reach the turn off for the hostel.  We checked in and got showers and dry clothes. We put all our wet stuff in the washer and dryer.  When we were finally clean and dry, we took advantage of the hiker special - a frozen pizza, a pint of Ben and Jerry's ice cream and a soda. I definitely don't eat a meal like that very often, but here on the trail, it seems perfectly acceptable.  Shooting Star was there and we met several others also.  Steve and Erik, retired soldiers, were hiking together.  We had seen some of their SEGA stickers in registers already (Steve and Erik's Great Adventure).

 We turned back and called John to meet us back at Newfound Gap so he could drive us to Clingman's Dome and let us start hiking there instead. That way, we would only have 3.1 miles, instead of 10.8 miles, to hike to the shelter. During that time, Linda decided that she was not going to be able to keep up with us and she decided to drive back home with John.
 Carolyn and I quickly rearranged our day packs and backpacks. It was almost 4:00 before we set off down the trail. It was more downhill than uphill hiking and we covered the three miles to Double Spring Gap Shelter in good time. We had a leisurely dinner and raspberry dessert. I showed Carolyn how to set up her sleeping area.  We shared my stove for dinner and hung our bear bag. There was a nice spring very close to the shelter and the privy was one of the nicer ones I have seen.
 There were already three young guys at the shelter when we arrived. They were two brothers and a friend, all from Key West. It was windy and rained some in the night, There was some sort of fruit tree next to the shelter that dropped fruit on the roof periodically during the night, but we managed to get a good night's sleep.","Clingman's Dome

We stopped at Silers Bald Shelter for a short break and got to Derrick Knob Shelter by 1:00. There was not much elevation change, just short ups and downs. There were no good views or interesting landmarks either, but it was good to be back on the AT.
 While having lunch there, we contemplated pushing on to the next shelter, Spence Field. Then a northbound guy arrived and told us about a bear encounter he had had there the previous night. He said he had been at the shelter alone and a bear had wandered in. It wasn't aggressive, but it wasn't intimidated by his presence at all. He said he shot a few stones with his slingshot at the bear's feet and it left the shelter, but circled around and came back in again. He said at that point he shot a stone right at the bears forehead and it ran off.
 We decided to stay where we were, even though it was early. Carolyn took a nap and I talked to this young man for awhile. We figured that being younger, he would have plenty of energy and he would move on . It began to rain though and he announced that he was going to stay at the shelter with us. Something about him was making us uneasy, so we were really glad to see another couple of northbounders stroll in. They let us know that there were two more coming behind them too. We were glad not to be the only ones with this guy. I think this is the only person I have encountered in my hiking so far that has given me bad vibes and I was glad we would not be the only ones in the shelter with him for the night.

They said they were there in honor of Pat Summitt, Tennessee's basketball coach who passed away earlier this year due to complications of Alzheimers. I told them I had lived in CT for years and was a UConn and Geno Auriemma fan, but even so I had to admire someone like Pat Summitt.
We stopped at the turnoff to Spence Field Shelter for lunch. Mothership and her friend caught up with us there. They continued down the cutoff to the shelter for their lunch break, and we continued on toward Mollies Ridge where we planned to stay for the night.
There was no one at Mollies Ridge when we arrived, but there was an inflated air mattress in the shelter. Carolyn is now its proud owner. Mothership and her friend arrived shortly after us. Later a group of four northbounders joined us, two fathers with their teens. The fathers said they were boyhood friends who had been spending time in the woods together for 40+ years.

 When we finally left the woods, we still had a mile road walk to the Visitor Center. It was extremely hot crossing the dam in the blazing sun, especially after being under tree cover in the woods for three days.

Today I made a special trip to hike the remaining 7.7 miles between Clingmans Dome and Newfound Gap, which completes my trek through the Smokies, once and for all.  I left home early and drove to Clingmans Dome, parked my car and began hiking north.  It was a gorgeous fall day.  I hiked alone for 4 hours to Newfound Gap.  No big views, a very uneventful day.  The parking lot at Newfound Gap was full and there were tourists everywhere,  but I didn't find anyone leaving there to drive up to Clingmans Dome.  
I started walking along the road.  I have never hitchhiked before, but I figured this road only lead to one place and I would be safe.  I stuck out my thumb.  After a few cars passed me, a van of Middle Easterners stopped and picked me up.  I tried to explain what I was doing out there on the road.  They spoke limited English, but they picked me up.  After a ten minute ride of odd silence, we arrived at the parking lot for Clingmans Dome.  I thanked them profusely, got out of the van, took a few pictures of myself at the scenic view, got in my car, and drove back home, the Smokies finally completed.","Clingmans Dome

We chatted with ""Gibson"", a thru-hiking guitar enthusiast who was waiting for a ride to the post office to get his monthly check so he could continue hiking. This was our third time at the park and the bathrooms were locked again.  Only once have they been open when we have been there.  What a pain that must be for local parents at the park with their kids!

Today was short ups and short downs all day.  Somehow, we missed the water that was supposed to be just after Rocky Mountain Shelter.  Thankfully, a day hiker we met as he was just finishing his hike gave me a liter of his water.  
It was nice walking through Caledonia State Park.  So many people were out with their families.  We got water from the fountains, got rid of our trash at the dumpster, used the restrooms, and washed our faces, arms, and hands.  What treats!  We had a flat mile or so walking on a paved path beside the river through the park and then a long uphill mile to Quarry Gap Shelter.
What a treat to come out of a rhododendron tunnel and into Quarry Gap Shelter!  It was a idyllic retreat from the hardships of the trail.   A welcoming gate, blooming daffodils, a babbling stream,  hanging flower pots, colorful Amish hex signs, and a wooden swing are a few of the adornments at this shelter. The spring right in front of the shelter is a great water source.  The privy was one of the cleanest I've seen on the trail. As we sat marveling at all the little touches the caretaker had added to make this such a pleasant place, an older couple joined us.  They were personal friends of the caretaker and were just hiking up from Caledonia and back for the day.  
Later another couple, Rawhide and Bubble Toes, joined us at the shelter.  They had met while thru hiking some years ago and gotten married a couple years later.  He worked at an REI.  They were out for an overnight to try out their new tent. The weather helped them really test it by pouring on us all night.
Iris and I chose one of the two  6-person shelters and were the only two people in either of them.  As we started settling in for the night, we found that the side of the shelter she had chosen had very squeaky floorboards.  She tried scooting around but it was still squeaky.  In the night when she got up for a bathroom run, she just moved to the other shelter by herself where squeaky boards would not be an issue for the rest of the night.","Tumbling Tun Shelter

They packed up and left before we did. We had breakfast at the shelter and took our time packing up and donning our rain gear. As we were packing, a guy with earbuds jogged past the shelter; later in the day he would pass us heading back the way we all had come in the morning. We finally started hiking about 9:30. We made good time to the PATC Milesburn Cabin and had our lunch on the front porch there, used the privy, and filled up with water at the stream there.
We got to Birch Run Shelter and had a second lunch there. We passed two different AT midpoints today. Since the trail is often rerouted slightly, the midpoint varies from year to year. We took pictures at both midpoints. There was a nice stream about a half mile before Toms Run Shelter where we intended to stay for the night. We stopped at the stream and got water and soaked our feet for as long as the cold water allowed. It was refreshing!
There was only one another hiker at the shelter with us tonight. He is a SOBO and is tenting so we have the shelter to ourselves again. We have decided that we do not want to tent at the campground when we return to Duncannon so we started trying to call local hotels for that night.  Unfortunately there was a car show in nearby Carlisle and all the hotels were full.  We finally got a room when we called Gelinas Manor, a bed and breakfast in Boiling Springs.  At first we were told she was closed, but I guess I sounded so desperate that she told us she would take us if we had cash and we agreed.

Because it was cool and windy, we didn't eat breakfast at the shelter.  We bundled up and were hiking by about 8:00.  We reached Pine Grove Furnace State Park after 3.7 miles in less than 2 hours.  Most thru-hikers indulge in the half-gallon ice cream challenge at the General Store here to celebrate passing the mid-point of the AT.  The store wasn't open for the season yet, so we just charged our phones on the outside outlets and ate our breakfast in the sun on the patio.  The nearby AT Museum was not officially open either but work was being done to get it ready for the season so we were able to get inside and enjoy its exhibits and use its restroom.
I got to talk to a young couple with three young children who were staying at a cabin in the park.  The husband mentioned that he would one day thru hike with his son (who was in the baby carrier at the time).  Seeing him holding his little baby made me homesick for my new grandbaby.
It was a treat to walk through the park under shady trees on crushed gravel walkways beside a river.  The weather was gorgeous and there were numerous water sources and road crossings again today.  Later there was an endless uphill over stones and countless switchbacks to get us up to the Rock Maze.  What an incredible experience navigating through the Rock Maze.  I felt proud that I did not have to resort to taking off my pack or sliding on the seat of pants at all to maneuver through this area.  This section is a great day hike for those lucky enough to live nearby.
After the Rock Maze we still had several miles to go before our intended shelter.  We came upon a couple of guys at a campsite and I was ready to stop, but there was no water so we hiked on.  We finally reached a campsite by a lovely stream about dusk.  There were already three others camping there but there was plenty of room for us to join them.  They mentioned twice that we were only .1 from the nearby shelter, but we were too tired to continue.

It was misty or lightly raining most of the day, but this was probably a good thing because we were walking through little villages and AT Farmlands all without the normal shade of the trail most of the day and would have been sunburned in  sunnier weather.  We hiked along Conodoguinet Creek and saw many varieties of flowers and crossed numerous footbridges.  We leap frogged during the day with the two guys from the campsite we passed up last night and a retired firefighter from Toledo who called himself Sir Dickspatcher  because of how his job title dispatcher had been mangled by a new employee at one time.  The worst mile of the day was the last one uphill to the shelter.  
Lone Wanderer was the only one at the shelter when we arrived and he had a fire going.  Sir Dick joined us later.  The two other guys came in also, but set up their tents away from the shelter and never joined us.  The privy at this shelter was bigger than my own bathroom at home!  We changed into dry clothes and enjoyed our dinner.  Sir Dick strung a line by the fire and we hung our socks to dry.  He and I propped our shoes and insoles near the fire to dry out after the long day of hiking through the wet grassy trail.  I was standing apart from the others and talking to my husband on my cellphone when I saw my shoes smoking.  By the time I reached them, one heel had melted from the heat of the fire. As the rubber dried, it made a hard golf ball sized lump inside my shoe.  This was not a good way to end the day. 
I told Iris that the strikes against me were accumulating.  I began praying that God would make it plain to me if I should be off the trail for the time being.  I bargained that I wanted it to be plain, but I didn't want a sign that would be too painful or too expensive.

We stopped at Cove Mountain Shelter for water.  The front steps had been removed from the shelter and metal flashing had been added all around the floor; there was a note explaining that these measures had been taken because of porcupines causing problems there.  There were also bees buzzing all around the shelter.  I was glad that we were not planning to stay there for the night.  
We met Renee from Springfield MO near the shelter.  She had just flown in and was on the trail for her first day this year.  She was hoping to complete the rest of her section hike of the AT this year.  She and Iris exchanged phone numbers in hopes that they might meet up the trail later this summer.
It was a rough rocky steep  downhill into the town of Duncannon.  Then it was a long hot walk through the town sidewalks through rundown neighborhoods to get to our campground. Miles on city sidewalks are much harder on the feet than miles  on the trail.

Kitty Gelinas is a fascinating and entertaining hostess.
We left about 11:00 to drive to Hamburg.  There we used the laundromat, organized our resupply for the next leg of our hike, went to a grocery store, got new shoes and an air mattress for me at the world's largest Cabelas store, and ate at Logans Roadhouse for dinner.
We drove to the home of John 'Mechanical Man' Stempa in Kunkletown where we had plans to stay for the night.
What a switch from Gelinas Manor!  At Stempas' home we slept on the concrete floor of his garage.  There was already one hiker there; we talked only briefly while getting our sleeping areas arranged and then it was lights out.","Gelinas Manor

There were views from Council Rock and Lookout Rock on the uphill stretch out of town  Since it was Saturday there were more people than normal out on the trail.  One family was out with a basket looking for Morel mushrooms.  A scout troop was out.  Several young men were camping at one of the lookout points for the weekend.  
We got to Kirkridge shelter earlier than we usually stop.  It had sprinkled on us most of the day so it felt good to change into clean dry clothes and eat a hot meal.  There was no bear pole or bear box, so I got to throw the bear rope over a tree branch for a change.   There were two young men here going north; they are not very talkative.  We went to bed before dark just because we were bored and cold.","Kitatinny Visitor Center

We were undecided if we should stay at the next shelter tonight or push on to Stempas for the night.  Iris' poison ivy is really bothering her so in the afternoon we made the decision to head past the shelter and on to Stempas.  
I was still struggling over my decision to stay on the trail or head home to see the new grandbaby.  I kept praying about it and thinking of the strikes against me so far.  I kept praying  that God would make it clear to me, but that it would not be too painful or too costly. About a mile from our destination for the day, my pole got caught between rocks and I fell flat.  My pole has snapped in two pieces but thankfully my wrists and knees were ok.  Iris had broken her nose on a similar fall in PA last summer.  This was my final strike.  We hiked on to Smith Gap Road where John Stempa picked us up in my truck and took us to his home.  
We dropped him off there and drove into Kunkletown to eat at the only place in town, the Kunkletown Pub.  We got off on the wrong foot by coming in the back door, which was in our defense, closest to the parking lot.  Then Iris who is gluten free, asked for the steak and was told they were out of it.  The waitress didn't know what gluten free was so she couldn't help.  We finally ordered and ate and went back to Stempa's home again.
After showers, we slept on the floor in the garage again, this time with a different hiker.  This year's section hike is over for me.  I am sad and relieved at the same time, and excited that I will get to see my new grandbaby soon.","Kirkridge Shelter

We were hiking by 9:00.  We enjoyed the views from Bears Den Rocks.  It was a terribly hot humid day but at least not rainy.  We stopped frequently to rest and drink water.  Lunch was at Raven Rocks with more great views.  We met about 25 people on the trail today. Most were day hikers and two were hiking with dogs. We moved slowly through the heat of the day. I rejoiced when we finally finished the Roller Coaster.

We did have rain for about an hour late in the afternoon. By then I was so hot and sticky that the rain felt nice.  It became evident that we would not make it to the David Lesser Shelter before dark, so we took the side trail to the Blackburn AT Center.  Three college guys from Michigan showed up to tent.  After dinner and a recuperating rest on the screen porch, we used the solar shower and got our things settled into the Hiker Hut for the night and talked about our options for the following day.  

We had planned for two ten-mile days.  Now we had only done 8 and had 12 more to get into Harpers Ferry.  Cheryl the caretaker was planning to drive into Harpers Ferry the next day and offered to take our packs with her so we could slack pack the 12 miles.

We had the hiker hut all to ourselves.  I was glad to be under a roof when I awoke to a terrific thunder storm about 10:00 that lasted for a couple of hours.  Emma slept soundly through it all.","Bears Den Hostel

We made it to Keys Gap, the halfway point for the day,  by lunchtime.  We thought we were almost to town when we began to see the Shenandoah River.  We still had a hot hike over the long bridge across the river, and then the trail turned back along the river and went back uphill into town. There were not nearly as many hikers on the trail today.
We finally made it to the ATC visitors center just before the 5:00 closing time. We took pictures and Emma was entered into their book as a section hiker.  Then we had another half mile to walk down the sidewalk to the Teahorse hostel.
After showers and clean clothes, I offered to take Emma out to eat to celebrate but she really wanted ramen noodles for her supper. So I called in a take-out order for a steak dinner for me, picked it up, came back to the hostel, and made ramen for her.  We both enjoyed our dinners.  
There were several others at the hostel with us: two couples from Michigan, a young woman finishing a Thru-Hike she had begun last year, and an Australian military guy here in the US for college classes.  Emma enjoyed talking with all the other hikers, and they all let her know how brave and strong she was for hiking.

We got up early and were on the trail by 7:30.  We had an easy 2.5 miles downhill into Elk Garden at VA 600.  We ate breakfast there and chatted with a couple of Boy Scout leaders from Raleigh.  Their scouts had already gone on ahead.  We stopped at Thomas Knob Shelter for lunch (where we intended to sleep last night).
Even though rain was forecast for 90%, we only had about 20 minutes worth.  We made it to Wise Shelter about 4:00, used the privy, had a snack, got water, and continued on.
In Grayson Highlands, we only saw a few of the wild ponies at a distance.  We heard others in the distance several times but didn’t see any up close. We did see several cows as we hiked through their pastures.  
We crossed paths with too many people to remember today - thru-hikers, section hikers, and day hikers — notably three or four Boy Scout troops preparing for Philmont and a group of about 20 ladies in their 60s and 70s just out for the day.
Some guys had a huge fire at The Scales and were doing trail magic.  We enjoyed their meatball wraps immensely. They also had lots of booze and some hikers were really enjoying it.  Some had been hanging out there all day!  It was an exposed area and super windy.  It also seemed like it would it might be loud late as the booze was flowing so we decided not to camp there and hiked another .3 to a campsite.  
Since we had just eaten, we only had to hang our food bags, set up our tents, and get ready for bed.  I managed to get the rope for our food bag over a suitable branch on my first throw again.  Four young people were also tenting at this campsite for the night.  Rain started shortly after we set up tents.  We all retreated to our tents about 7:00, trying to fall asleep while listening to cows bellowing in the pasture next to us and hoping to stay dry and get a good night’s sleep.","Campsite at Whitetop Mountain Road / USFS 89

It was sunny by then so I hung my tent over Janet’s car to dry and we sat in the parking lot to eat a late breakfast.  When it began raining again, we packed up quickly and got back on the trail.  We had a rough two mile uphill section.  Janet left her pack in her car and hiked up with us, then turned around and hiked back down to her car to go home.  I think she might’ve been crying when she had to leave the trail.  We had a long easy downhill stretch past Hurricane Mtn Shelter and into a gap.  It rained on and off all morning.  Around 3:00 we made the decision to get off the trail at Dickey’s Gap at VA 16 and try to catch a ride to the Baptist Church hostel in Troutdale for the night.   While we were trying to hitch a ride, another hiker joined us. A van stopped for us within a few minutes.  The driver  was a ridge runner who had thru hiked himself last year.  He took us the 2.7 miles down the road to the hostel and dropped us off.  He wouldn’t accept any cash from us, so we just thanked him profusely.  For a donation to the church, we got a shower, charged our phones, and are in a bunkhouse with four other hikers and a 65 year old NY lady biking cross country.   We are clean and dry, with full tummies, and a roof over our heads for the night.  We’ll hitch back to trail tomorrow morning.

We started walking but got a hitch after walking about a half mile.  We started our hike with a two mile uphill then two+ more downhill through a cow pasture to the Trimpi Shelter area where we had originally planned to stay last night.  The weather was beautiful and clear.  The trail was a good mix of ups and downs and ridgewalks, with plenty of water sources.  
We heard we can order pizza from the Mount Rogers Visitor Center next to  Partnership Shelter so that was our goal. My feet were complaining and I decided I would stop at the stream a mile or so before the Shelter to rest and soak them.  Around 4:30 while we were up on a ridge, the wind started picking up and we started hearing occasional thunder.  Not wanting to get drenched made me ditch the stream idea and push on as fast as I could go.  I succeeded in acquiring huge blisters on the balls of both feet.  It only sprinkled a bit on us just before we got to the shelter but then it stopped.  
This shelter is two levels.  Since we got here late, we are up an awkward  ladder on the second level.  That’s going to be tricky to maneuver for bathroom breaks in the night!  There are probably 25-30 people either at the shelter or tenting nearby.  
I was offered an leftover slice of veggie pizza and a tangerine by those already here eating so I took it gratefully.  I pretty much inhaled the food, hung my food bag, and dressed for bed. I managed to get the rope for our food bag over a suitable branch on my first throw again - three for three on this trip! 
I really enjoyed using the REAL bathroom at the visitors center and getting to wash my face and hands with soap there before bed.  I was able to get a call out to my cousin Mike about plans to meet him tomorrow in Atkins.  I also called mom for a few minutes before losing reception.  By 8:15 I was going to bed!

Dogwoods were starting to bloom.  Not many trees were leafing out yet in the higher elevations.  We had very pleasant hiking about three miles in late afternoon alongside a stream in rhododendron tunnels.  
There was trail magic at the old Lindamood School near the Settlers Museum.  What a blast reading the rules for students AND teachers from a century ago.

Esther gave me essential oils to treat my blisters. Sue and I reworked our plans for the next few days to do less miles and hope for my feet to heal.  After repacking the resupply boxes we had sent to their house earlier and stopping at the grocery store for a few additional items, Esther dropped us off at the trail in Atkins about 1:00.  
We walked along the road and under the  highway before turning into a cow pasture.  It was all exposed and very hot.  I have never been so close to so many cows!  One was right on the trail heading our way.  Thankfully another hiker has just passed us and was twenty yards in front of us.  He and the cow faced off for a few seconds and then the cow turned aside.  She looked like she was coming right back to the trail so I picked up my pace and she veered back away until after we passed.  
We hiked a short way to the old Davis Shelter spot.  The shelter has been torn down but the picnic table and privy were still there for use.  We had plenty of water so it made a great place to stop.  We set up tents and took a short nap.  I got the rope for our food bag over a suitable branch on my first throw again - four for four.  
Several hikers passed through and chatted.  It was an easy “nero”  (nearly zero) day.  It was relaxing to stop early without feeling pressure to make more miles.  I wouldn’t want this much free time every day but it was great this day for my feet.  An early bedtime should mean an early start tomorrow morning.","Atkins VA 683 / US 11

We were up, packed and gone in the morning before they even got up.  We had to hike four miles to the first water source.  It was a pleasant clearing so we had breakfast there and rested while we enjoyed the sound of the stream.  
A half mile down the trail we were stopped dead in our tracks by an ominous rattle.  It was a 3-4 foot rattlesnake coiled in front of us, and it was in no hurry to get off the trail.  We waited 10-15 before it finally slithered over the sloping side of the trail.  We had another relaxing stop by a beautiful spring and chatted there with a solo sobo hiker.  
Today we climbed Little Brushy Mtn, Walker Mtn, and Brushy Mtn.  Between them, we walked through a couple of large cow pastures and through gaps and along ridges.  We finally got to the night’s destination, Knot Maul Branch Shelter, about 5:30, just beating the rain. It only lasted a few minutes and then last night’s threesome arrived (much earlier than last night thankfully) and joined us in the shelter.  We’ve eaten and hung food bags and had time to hang out before bed.  Three others are tenting here also.

We had a pleasant shady walk almost two miles alongside Lick Creek before crossing VA 625 and starting a 4+ mile uphill to get to tonight’s shelter.  The first mile was very steep before the grade became a little easier to handle.  I took too many rest stops to count, two miles through the woods then a two mile clearing and open ridge line.  Unfortunately the thunder began in the distance just as we got to the open area.  The thunder and lightning got closer and then rain started.  Then it was hailing pea-sized hail for 15-20 minutes, although it seemed longer.  
We finally struggled into the Chestnut Knob Shelter, a concrete block fully-enclosed structure with a door.  I was soaking wet from head to shoes.  There were a few hikers there waiting out the storm.  When it quit, they moved on but other wet hikers straggled in.  By 6:00pm,  I’d eaten and changed into dry clothes and had my sleeping area set up on a bunk. 
There wewre posters up in the shelter advertising a “Hillbilly Hiker Feast” the next day from 7:00am to dark thirty. That was only 1.3 miles away so it became our incentive for the next day!  If it’s still raining in the morning, we’re just going to stay here though.

When we got to the Gap, we met a local guy who had section hiked the whole trail with his dog Apache over the last several years. Now he takes a whole day every year in May to provide trail magic for other hikers.  His whole extended family helps out.  
They had hot dogs and beans and chili, chips, fresh veggies and dip, fresh fruit, several sheet cakes, and cold sodas and milk.  What a feast!  And they had several camp chairs for hikers to sit in.  We filled our plates and cups twice and enjoyed chatting with them as we ate.  
With full stomachs we tackled the next mountain.  The temperature was rising and without leaf cover yet, it got hot quickly.  The heat, my feet, and my uncomfortably full stomach made it slow going for me.  After a couple of painful hours I was beat.

The forest floor was soft from recent rain but not too muddy and it was covered in cushy pine straw in many places.  There were many wooden bridges across streams and ravines.  There were not many rocky sections so it was easy on our feet again.  It was sunny and clear but only in the low 80’s, there were nice breezes much of the day, and we hiked near Dismal Creek most of the day so we had plenty of water.  It was perfect hiking weather and terrain!  We saw two men fishing in the distance at one point during the day but did not cross paths with any hikers all day.

We arrived at Wapiti Shelter about 5:30 and had plenty of time to eat, hang our food bags, and set up our sleeping area in the shelter.  No other hikers ever joined us so we didn’t have to share the shelter.","Lickskillet Histel

The first 2 miles were uphill and seemed to take forever.  There were a lot of rocks today too. The weather was sunny and clear with mild breezes almost all day.  
We talked with a group of 9 guys at one of the road crossings.  The were mostly from Raleigh and just out for a few days, heading southbound.
We passed several areas that had been burned and were just growing back.  We wondered if it had been a prescribed controlled burn or a forest fire.  We got to a nice rocky overlook about 3:00 and enjoyed a rest with the view.
We made it to Doc’s Knob Shelter about 4:00.  It is a small shelter but has a newly built deck, picnic table and Adirondack chair.  Those maintaining it also included interesting laminated news articles about the local area in with the shelter register.  No other hikers joined us and we were in bed by 7:15 just waiting for it to get dark.

Since it was a Saturday close to town, there were more people hiking today.  We met a sobo guy running early this morning and then he passed us going the other direction right before we got to town.  He said he had “only“ gone ten miles out today.  There was a single VA Tech girl, 3 recent Clemson grads, three different couples, and another group of young people. 
The weather was perfect again today!
There wasn’t much elevation change until we started descending into Pearisburg, then it was steep switchbacks for a couple of miles.  We got picked up by Mongo and shuttled to Lickskillet to get the truck, drove back to Pearisburg to check in at Angels Rest Hiker Haven, went out to eat at a Chinese buffet, picked up a few things at WalMart, got our showers, and were in nice soft beds in the bunkhouse by 9:00.  Only one other hiker was in the bunkhouse with us.

We had lunch at Kelly Knob with three local ladies who were out hiking for the day.  We had been hearing dogs barking during the way up to Kelly Knob.  The ladies filled us in on the cause.  They had seen some hunters out running their dogs getting ready for bear season and they had seen the dogs tree a bear on their hike up to Kelly Knob.  We didn’t hear or see the hunters, dogs or bear on our way down that trail.  
After the long steep downhill we began an even longer steeper uphill.  We passed War Spur Shelter and were tempted to stop for the night.  There was only one guy there. We decided it was too early to stop and began an uphill climb, never fun or easy at the end of the day.
We had planned to make it to camp at Wind Rock, but stopped where the War Branch Trail intersects with the AT.  It’s not an official campsite, but it worked.  Thankfully I got the rope over a great branch on my first try.  Our tents are up, supper is cooking, and our sweaty clothes are drying out some.  I hope to be in bed by 8:00.","VA42 at Sinking Bridge Creek

Good thing we didn’t stay there.  As we were packing up, two of the others from the shelter passed through.  
We got on the trail just before 8:00.  On our way uphill, a day hiker crossed paths with us.  He said he was surprised to see so many of us out this late in the season.  We hiked about 3 miles before stopping at Wind Rock (last night’s intended campsite) for breakfast.  
The rest of the day was more level but very rocky so we weren’t coasting. We ate lunch at Bailey Gap Shelter.   
During the day we crossed paths with Grace from ATL as she was going northbound.  She belongs to the AT Women’s Group (Bethann Johnston).  She’s doing a four week section.  We also met Pathfinder, a 70ish year old who started at Springer and wants to get to Harpers Ferry this season. Since we’re going southbound back into Pearisburg, we may see them both again on our Pearisburg-Daleville section.  We also met a group of 10 kids out from Washington and Lee University.
We stopped around 3:30 to soak our feet in the river then hiked another mile or so to Pine Swamp Branch Shelter.  Since a long uphill was beginning and there wouldn’t be another campsite for three miles, we decided to stay there the night.  
There were also a couple of thru hikers there with us.  Windrider is a sobo flipflopper our age who has done Harpers Ferry to Maine, and now is hiking south from Harpers Ferry to Springer Mtn.  
Webster was thruhiking nobo and had to get off the trail in Damascus because of his grandmother’s death.  He rejoined his tramily (trail family) in Pearisburg a few weeks later and finished at Katahdin with them.  Now he is filling in the Damascus to Pearisburg section he missed.  Tonight is his last night on the trail.
A trail maintainer came by the shelter and let us know he was working on some of the blowdowns that we’d be encountering tomorrow.  We all thanked him for his volunteer work maintaining the trail.

We started with an uphill as usual when leaving a town.  It was a hot day and that it made the uphill a killer. it began with a walk up and over a grassy sunny meadow, so we were soaked with sweat before we even hit the tree line.  
We stopped to see the the Keffer Oak,  the largest oak tree on the AT in the South, at over 18’ around and over 300 years old.  We chatted with a local guy taking his cousin from Indiana there to see it.  We also crossed paths with two SOBOs flying down the trail.  
We had to do about two sometimes steep miles up to the Sinking Hill Mountain.  We passed through an old apple orchard with piles and piles of rock cairns.  We thanked those farmers from long ago who had cleared those rocks off the trail for us!  
We were looking forward to what appeared on the map to be a ridgewalk but turned out to be two miles of exposed sunny slanted granite that dropped off straight down to our right!  No relaxing ridgewalk today, but there were beautiful views.    
Finally we started heading downhill, but it was not easy either, still with some steep sections and lots of rocks.  It was on this section I finally saw my first bear.  It was a cub climbing out of a tree and taking off away from us and the trail.  It was probably only 50-60 pounds.  It happened so fast I couldn’t get a picture.   It did make us nervously watch for mama bear for the next few minutes.
We heard voices before we saw the shelter.  Upon arriving at NiDay Shelter, we met another group of 8 students from Washington and Lee University. They explained that they had 12 or 13 small groups on the trail before classes begin; we had crossed paths with another group of them a couple days ago.  They have a tradition of a few upperclassmen taking a few underclassmen out for bonding before classes begin.  There was also one sobo about our age, Ole from Minnesota.  We had good talks during dinner but they were all tenting so again we had a shelter to ourselves.","VA42 at Sinking Creek Bridge

We filled up and began our uphill for the day.  It wasn’t as steep as yesterday’s and it wasn’t as hot either, but it was longer.  I started the day with a dull headache,  maybe from lack of water yesterday. I was moving very slowly and had to take several breaks. 
When we finally made it to the top, there was a nice wooden bench waiting for us.  While we were enjoying our lunch there, we saw our first hiker for the day, a local guy our age named Rusty.  
We chatted briefly and he continued up the trail to the Audie Murphy Memorial. Murphy was the most decorated American soldier of WWII.  He died in a plane crash here on Brush Mountain on the AT. He is buried in Arlington, and I had visited his grave when I chaperoned our PCS juniors on their trips to DC.
We covered the 3.7 downhill miles much quicker than we had gone uphill.  We caught up with Rusty and we all filled up with water at Trout Creek Footbridge and had another mile uphill to get to the shelter.  
Pickle Branch Shelter is a long .3 off the trail.  We had originally planned to tent on the side trail to the shelter.  With some menacing thunder and lightning getting closer and closer, we decided to go all the way to the shelter.  If it did rain, we wouldn’t have to pack wet tents in the morning.  We knew we would appreciate having use of the privy too.  
As we got closer to the shelter, we heard several voices and thought it might be full and our .3 walk was in vain.  It was another group of Washington and Lee students. They were hanging out around the shelter and had all their food on the table covered with a tarp and all their gear under the table or in the shelter.  
They told us we could have the shelter because they were sleeping under their tarps.   Even though it seemed like it was going to rain, the kids did not set up their tarps or cook their food.  They sat around talking and playing cards.  We cleaned up and ate.  When it began to rain, we all moved into the shelter.  It was after 6:00 but getting dark because of the rainy weather and they were still sitting around playing cards and having fun, but making no preparation for eating or sleeping.  We already had our rope in the tree so we hung our food bags, packed up, and moved away from the shelter.  
If they had just told us when we arrived that they would all be staying in the shelter, we could have moved then and set up our tents before the rain began.  Instead we took them at their word and when it was apparent they were not leaving the shelter, we left in the rain and set up camp away from them in the rain.  The two other groups that we met from the university were very polite, courteous, and friendly, but this third group did not make me a “happy camper”.","NiDay Shelter

Today would’ve been my fathers 90th birthday.  I shared a few stories about him with Susan as we hiked.
Today was a short mileage day. We crossed paths with several sobo thru hikers trying to get through the Smokies and finish at Springer Mtn before weather gets cold.  There were also several section hikers like us.  It’s always interesting to hear an individual’s story for why he is hiking.  Because it was a long holiday weekend, there were many dayhikers on the trail too.
Our hike today included Dragons Tooth.  We had to collapse our poles and stick them in our packs so our hands were free to navigate the sheer rock descent.  It was actually fun, but I wouldn’t have wanted to do it in the rain! 
Just before the end of our hike, I whacked my left knee in a rock.  The scab from a previous fall ripped off and the blood seeped through my pants and dripped down my shin.  Good thing we were headed to a hostel for the night!  
When the AT crossed VA624 about 2:30, we caught up with Rusty.  He was waiting there to be picked up his nephew whenever he got off work.  
We hiked along the road for .3 mile to Four Pines hostel.  While walking on the paved road,  I slipped on the wet slimy edge of the road and my feet flew out from under me.  I landed hard on my right hip.  Ouch!
Joe and Donna have converted the 3-bay garage on their property into a hostel called Four Pines.  We got showers, washed our clothes and hung them to dry, hung our tents to dry, and will be spending the night inside clean and dry.  All this for a suggested donation of $15 each.  We enjoyed watching the chickens and Guinea hens roaming the yard while we waited for our clothes to wash and dry.
The couple also let us use their old van to drive to the nearby Home Place restaurant.  When we passed the trail crossing, we saw Rusty was still sitting there.  We stopped and invited him to join us for dinner but he declined saying his nephew was finally on the way.  
The Home Place serves family style meals and we had plenty.  We definitely got full and got our money’s worth of good southern home cooking!  I put the leftover country ham and bits of fried chicken into two biscuits and will have them for lunch tomorrow.  As we were finishing our meal, we saw Rusty and his nephew arriving.  Within a few minutes the hostess seated them right beside us.  We enjoyed chatting with them as we finished our dinner.  
Now we’re clean, fed, and ready for bed!  We have heard that this hostel is a party place during the thru-hiker bubble but there are only two others here with us (both thru-hikers in our age bracket - a woman of Japanese descent from San Diego and a man from Canada), so we should get a good night’s sleep.

The rooster woke us early and we packed up and left Four Pines Hostel and walked down the road .3 mile back to the AT.  Our first 2 miles or so were easy ones through pasture land.  After walking through the fields of goldenrod and ragweed, my pants looked like I had rubbed up against the old chalkboard, covered in yellow “dust”.
Then we walked along a ridge for a few miles.  As we crossed VA Route 311, we began the 4 mile ascent to McAfee Knob.  Being a weekend, there were many hikers out for the day.  There was sporadic thunder rumbling as we hiked.  
We stopped at Johns Spring Shelter hoping to refill our water bottles but the spring was bone dry.  It began to rain while we sat in the shelter there, so I set my bottles on a rock, hoping to collect some drinkable water.  I didn’t accomplish much.  
We stopped a mile later at Catawba Mountain Shelter and managed to fill our bottles from the puddle that was listed as a stream.  We finished our lunch there and then began the final hike up the mountain.  
There were probably 25-30 others already there when we reached McAfee Knob.  We enjoyed the view and took some pictures.  Someone was using a drone that was really annoying.  
We finally headed down the mountain to the Campbell Shelter area for the night.  We chose a campsite near four young men from First Baptist Church of Cary NC and one other guy from Roanoke VA section hiking. Several others are camping in and around the nearby shelter.
We enjoyed talking with the guys as we set up our tents and fixed and ate our dinners.  On our way downhill to the water source, my feet flew out from under me again and I landed on my right hip again.  Bruises upon bruises!  I’ve taken my nightly ibuprofen, so hopefully I’ll be good as new tomorrow morning.

It was a relatively easy slackpacking 10.9 mile day so I had time and energy to take pictures of the views and flowers and critters.  We saw a 3-4 foot black snake, a lizard Susan thought was a skink, and many wildflowers.  We took our time and enjoyed the views, took a long lunch break, and talked a lot, unlike yesterday when we were racing against the clock to meet our shuttle driver by 6:00. 


Since we were hiking sobo we crossed paths with several nobo hikers that we had seen yesterday.  It’s always fun to recognize a hiker coming toward you and stop for a few minutes of trail gossip.

After supper, we emptied our packs and resupply boxes and organized and repacked everything.  We needed to be ready for the shuttle driver that would come at 7:00am.  I bought two Naked Mango juices and a chocolate milk to go along with my bacon jerky for breakfast.","Punchbowl Overlook

Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617470,"Our shuttle driver arrived early and six of us with full backpacks crammed into the Ford Bronco with him.  Along the drive he regaled us with stories from his youth, growing up in a farm nearby in these mountains - plowing behind a horse, baling hay by hand, roaming the hills, hunting squirrels, and raising almost all their own food. It’s a dying way of life.


He dropped us off at the same place he did yesterday.  One day we hiked sobo with only daypacks; one day we hiked nobo with all our gear and enough food for five days.  What a big difference all that weight makes!


Our hike began leisurely with gentle terrain but I had to run into the woods for two hurry-up calls.  Maybe I won’t drink so much fruit juice next time I’m in town.  We heard the jets again today but we were too deep in the woods to see them.  Yesterday we had great views of them.  


We made it 9.1 miles to Brown Mountain Creek Shelter about 12:30 for lunch. We met a couple of guys there from TN and WI that had been on the top of Bluff Mtn with us yesterday watching the jets. It was a killer climb and took me almost five hours.  For those who started thru hiking at Springer Mtn, it is on this stretch they hit the 800 mile mark.  There were several “800” spots spelled out with sticks or stones along a short stretch of trail.  


After finally trudging to the top, we fixed dinner at the summit and ate there.  One by one a group of eight young people passed us by.  We were all heading to the Cow Camp Shelter so we weren’t sure what to expect.  


When we arrived all the young people were setting up their tents so we had the shelter to ourselves. We’ve stayed two nights in a hotel, two in a hostel, two in our tents, but this was our first in a shelter on this trip.


A group of four young men, recent grads from Liberty University, came into camp while we were eating, but decided to go elsewhere so they could be by themselves.  They said we “real hikers” intimidated them! LOL  They set up camp just a little back up the approach trail to the shelter. It was a refreshing change talking to them compared to most of the young guys we meet out here who can’t seem to speak at all without including the  f-word at least once every sentence.


At 8:50 it was pretty dark down in the gap and we were ready to call it a ni","Punchbowl Overlook

Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617471,"Susan has found a red itchy sore on her side that looked similar to poison ivy. She said it also looked like a shingles outbreak. She has had shingles before and it put her out of commission for two weeks. She made plans to walk with the Liberty guys to the trailhead where they had parked and they agreed to drop her at an urgent care.


I planned to hike on alone and wait to hear from her up the trail.  My day began with .6 uphill walk just to get back onto the real trail.  The rest of the day was only moderately strenuous, no huge ascents or descents, just half-mile stretches either up or down.  


One by one the younger hikers from our campsite passed me by.  I caught up with them at Seely Woodward Shelter about 1:30 where we all  stopped for lunch.  Another group who had camped even farther away also joined us there; they had already done almost 20 miles for the day.  We all intended to get to the Priest Shelter for the evening. Because of the name, it is to be a tradition for hikers to confess their trail sins in the shelter log.  That should make for interesting reading! 
If Susan has shingles and has to cut her hike short, I think I plan at least to try to tough it out until the day John is planning to meet us in June. I might try to arrange more slackpacking and hostel stays though.  I’m not sure I’m ready to be a solo hiker.   


Susan is a great encourager and has helped me immensely through my hiking.  Just yesterday as she was encouraging me as she patiently followed me on that long uphill climb, I asked her if she felt like a parent teaching their child to ride a bike running behind them and helping them balance. I’ve never hiked without a partner.  It comforts and calms me just knowing someone else is out here with me.  As we parted at the shelter this morning,  I said it was “time for me to take off the training wheels.”


As I had no one to talk to during the day, I found ways to occupy my mind.  I quoted all my memory verses - James, Philippians, I John, and many single verses.  I sang.  I quoted the books of the Bible.  I tried to sing as many songs as I could that started with A, then B, then C...


I finally made it to the base of Priest Mountain about 5:00.  Knowing I had a steep .9 up to the shelter, I stopped for a rest, a drink, and a snack.  I was really just putting off the inevitable.  I finally trudged uphill to the shelter.  It took me almost an hour.  


All the young people from both groups I had seen during the day were there already.  Legacy was eating at the picnic table too along with a few unfamiliar faces.  I felt I deserved a standing ovation for doing the same mileage most of them had done for the day, but my entrance went unnoticed.


Most had tents set up, so I claimed a spot in the shelter and began fixing dinner. About that time, Susan walked in.  She had found a shuttle back to a nearby trailhead and hiked in from the north.  The doctor she had seen was not sure whether her sore was shingles or some type of contact dermatitis.  She has prescriptions for both that she will take as we continue  hiking, and time will tell.  For now, I’m glad she’s back on the trail.  


All the young people are planning to start early start and do big miles to get to a trailhead where they will be picked up for a trip to Devils Backbone, a local brewery.  They are so excited for beer. 


Legacy has plans to stay at the same next three shelters that we do as we head into Waynesboro.  We three may be the only ones at them.  We’ll see.","Cow Camp Gap Shelter
",The Priest Shelter,"May 23, Thu",16.80
Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617472,"There was a brief but powerful rainstorm in the night.  We were safe and dry in the shelter. Some of those in tents or hammocks got a bit wet.  Everyone started stirring between 5:30-6:00.  They were all anxious to meet the shuttle to the brewery.  Many left before us.  We started about 7:30.


We had a brief climb to the top of Priest Mountain then a long, twisty, rocky, tedious downhill stretch to a nice water source. I slipped once and landed hard on my seat but I’m lucky to have plenty of padding there.  My neck felt whiplashed from the jarring fall.  That three miles was possibly the hardest downhill section I’ve done.  We stopped at a rocky ledge overlook for a well-deserved break and took pictures there. 


At the bottom of Priest Mtn is a parking lot.  We started talking to a young couple who were just getting out of their car to hike up and back down for the day.  They agreed to take our trash and also gave us each a Gatorade.  Nice folks!


We crossed a highway and then went over the Tye River on a suspension bridge. We leapfrogged with Legacy all morning and agreed to meet him at the next shelter for lunch.  As we took a snack break, a young couple from last night’s shelter passed us.  I thought all of the younger hikers already had gone by us by then.  We had heard them coming, arguing, but they stopped as they passed us.  Twenty yards up the trail they started in again.  They were NOT happy campers.  


From the Tye River at 901 elevation we climbed almost six miles to Three Ridges at 3956 elevation.  Most of it was rocky and steep.  Once I even had to collapse my poles and stick them in my pack so I could use my hands to help get up the trail. It was probably THE HARDEST DAY I’ve ever had on the trail.  It was almost 6:00 when we finally summited, so we ate dinner at the top, and then we continued almost 3 more miles mostly downhill to Maupin Field Shelter.  
There were several large family groups camping because of Memorial Day weekend.  Because it was late, we had a hard time finding spots.  And I had thought we might be the only ones here!!  We were in our tents by dark and it completely quiet at 9:00pm so I guess everyone was as dead tired as we were.","The Priest Shelter
",Maupin Field Shelter campsite,"May 24, Fri",13.80
Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617473,"It was a really quiet morning as we all got up, used the privy, ate, and packed up.  Susan was starting to feel really tired, a symptom of shingles.  As we looked at the AWOL guide, we saw a potential place where we could be picked up in 6.5 miles.  We had to hike uphill to find a place where we had phone service.  We called Stanimal’s in Waynesboro and made arrangements to be picked up at 2:00.  It’s always a gamble trying to figure out how long a section is going to take.  We always try to err on the side of US waiting, rather than a shuttle driver having to wait for us.  


We made good time so we stopped at a nice shady spot along the trail for a leisurely, early lunch. At Cedar Cliffs we were taking pictures and a young couple was there with two children.  We chatted for some time and answered all their  questions about backpacking.  I even took off my pack so their 9 year old daughter could try it on. I told her about Emma backpacking with me as a 7 year old and about the trip I have planned with her for later this summer.  Maybe I planted backpacking seeds in her young mind.


I have turned my left ankle over and twisted it many times in the last few days and it always seems fine after a few tentative steps.  I have been thanking God often for good ankles these days!!!


Today we met Buttercup and Boots. Buttercup is a military veteran hiking with her little support dog.  She made special boots and gaiters for him, hence the trail name.


We got to our pickup point about a half hour earlier than we needed to be.  Our ride was not there yet, but there was trail magic!  Three friends had chairs set up in the shade for hikers.  They had served pancakes and sausage to hikers for breakfast and were offering pork chops and baked potatoes for lunch along with cold treats.  Knowing we’d be leaving soon, we each just took a Gatorade and a big chunk of watermelon. Good stuff!! It’s such a blessing and encouragement to run into folks doing random things like this!


Our ride came shortly and we were delivered to Stanimal’s hostel in Waynesboro VA.  We met Adam Stanley who immediately squirted heavy duty soap (the orange GoJo kind like John uses when he works on the car) into our hands and had us scrub before giving us the tour and rules of the hostel. 


We both claimed bottom bunks upstairs and showered.  Susan napped while I did laundry.  Later we walked downtown for a steak dinner.  We met two sisters our age at the hostel with the husband of one of them.  He has been slackpacking them as much as possible while they dayhike in the area.  


Meanwhile John was in Charleston for Memorial Day weekend with our sons Matt and Kyle and their families.","Maupin Field Shelter campsite

Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617474,"Glenn cooked breakfast for those of us at the hostel - portobello egg frittata, sausage links, and blackberry pancakes for $6.  Susan stayed at the hostel in bed to recuperate while I got shuttled back to Dripping Rock to hike into town.


I started with a gradual 3 mile climb up Humpback Mountain from 2964 elevation to 3600.  I took a break and enjoyed the views on a beautiful  clear day.  There was a small group doing trail maintenance along the way and I made sure to thank them for their efforts at keeping the trail in such good condition.


Since it was Sunday and I was hiking alone, I spent some time talking to God and praising Him out loud.  Later I started with A and sang all the hymns or choruses I could think of that started with A.  Then I moved to B and eventually went through the whole alphabet. It was fun.


I probably crossed paths with 30+ dayhikers all heading up to Humpback Mountain and the views there while I was gradually heading down into a gap and the Paul Wolfe Shelter.  It’s easy to distinguish a dayhiker or someone who just stayed in town the previous night from a thruhiker who has been on the trail multiple days.  The “clean” smell of soap, shampoo, laundry detergent, etc. is almost overwhelming; sometimes it feels like I get a whole mouthful of it.  That makes me wonder if my smell is also so obvious to them.


Mill Creek in front of Paul Wolfe Shelter provided my water and would have been a tempting spot to bathe if I had not been at the hostel last night and going to be there again for another night.  It cooled things off at the shelter and provided me with background “music” during lunch.Just as I was finishing two thruhukers stopped in for water and lunch.  i figured they would probably breeze past me on the way into town.


It finally happened.  I hadn’t seen anyone else for a half hour or more.  I was about 10-12 feet off the trail, finishing using my pstyle and a male dayhiker calls out, excuse me, can you tell me if I’m on the right trail to humpback rocks?  I had my back to him and didn’t answer immediately, so he kept walking nearer while talking, while I was frantically trying to zip my pants and put away my bright pink female urinary device.  It was not as embarrassing as it would’ve been getting caught squatting with my pants all the way down!  #onlyontheAT#traillife 


Along the trail today, I passed a really long section of low stone wall and found it amazing that there were still so many stones in the trail even after that wall was built!  I also stopped to see the old Lowe family cemetery and the old W J Mayo homeplace with a chimney still standing.


About a mile out of town some sobo hikers said they had seen a mama bear with three cubs  between me and town.  I was on alert but only saw one cub scurrying down the trail away from me.  It is unnerving to know there must be a mama nearby and yet not know where she is.  I was glad when I finally came out of the woods at the road crossing so I could stop looking for bears.


I was also pleasantly surprised that the two male thruhikers with their trail legs from hiking all the way from Springer Mtn this year that I had left at the shelter did not overtake me on the trail.  Maybe they just took a really long lunch break or naps!


I crossed the busy Blue Ridge Parkway and ambled over to the picnic tables by the popcorn stand, called Stanimal’s for a ride about 4:00, and sat down to wait.  Adam Stanley arrived in his Suburban in just a few minutes, but he had just picked up some new mattresses for the hostel.  The middle and back seats were folded down with mattresses crammed inside and others tied on top.  We managed to get my pack and poles in the back and I got to sit on the console between the front seats for the 3.5 mile ride into town.

Susan had been up some during the day and had gone to a store and had a special treat waiting for me in the fridge - a Naked Mighty Mango Juice, my favorite!
After showering and getting laundry done, I got to watch NCIS and see what happened with Ziva!  I also caught up on the Amazing Race and was very disappointed that it was not an elimination round because I was so read for that team of Reilly sisters to be gone.  They are so annoying!

I heated the tea to go with my breakfast.  Yum!


I got dropped off first about 8:00 at Turk Gap to hike back southbound to Waynesboro with a day pack.  The others were all heading north with full packs. 


After yesterday, today was really “a walk in the park.”  The trail here in SNP was so neat and manicured.  Even the rocks were more manageable and the uphill grades were not so steep.  Maybe all of Shenandoah will be this way; I can hope so anyhow.  


I encountered 8-10 nobo hikers in my first hour, including the Nashville TN couple we met a few days ago.  Later I met the Terry and Kate, the sisters who had been at Stanimal’s with us.  


I also talked with Angie, a young woman out on her own from MD trying to do SNP in a week.  I told her about the AT women’s Facebook group and that it was a great group for encouragement and collective knowledge of women hikers. I found out later that she did join that group.


We’ve had temps mostly in the mid 70s and low 80s and breezy.  It only rained about an hour one morning out of 11 days on this trip so far and twice in the evenings when we were already in a shelter or a hostel.  


Another first for me today. I came around a curve and see a guy standing directly in the trail ahead of me, peeing.  I just kept my head down like I was concentrating on going uphill and didn’t know what he was doing and called out Good Morning as I got nearer. He quickly turned away. #traillife#onlyontheAT


Lunch was my subway sandwich and chips at Beagle Gap where I got to use  the portapotties that were in the parking area.  Then I went up Calf Mountain whose peak is marked by a huge pile of rocks in the middle of the wooded trail and Little Calf Mountain whose peak was a sign in a meadow with beautiful views. There were stretches through head high grassy fields.  After McCormick Gap there was a half mile steep uphill stretch where I met many of the young people who had been at the hostel with us and the two guys I had met at yesterday’s shelter at lunch time and Buttercup and Boots.  I only crossed paths with nobos all day; no sobos passed me.  


About three miles from the entrance to SNP, I went through a stretch with several trees and branches over the trail.  It made things interesting, trying to get over, around, or under them; and it slowed me up a bit.  It looked almost like a tornado might’ve come through recently. So much for my hopes for endless manicured trails through the whole park.


I made it back to Waynesboro by 3:00, called for a shuttle, and got picked up. Its great to shower, do laundry, and eat town food multiple nights in a row.  Town stays can get expensive but it is worth it to shower and sleep in a bed each night and be able to hike with only necessities for the day in my pack.

Once inside the park in the car, we saw a skunk scurrying across the road, then a deer on the side of the road, and then a good-sized black bear scampering up the hill beside the road — all before we ever got into the woods!  During our hike, we only encountered one deer on the trail.  

Since we hiked south, we again crossed paths with many of the same hikers we had hiked with before.  We saw sisters Kate and Terry, Buttercup and Boots, and Legacy all headed to the Blackrock Hut for the night - all friends of ours but none of whom have met each other yet.

It was another great weather day but there were no water sources on the stretch of trail we travelled today.  We had each only brought two one-liter bottles, so we had to ration.  I could’ve easily used another liter or two today.  


Adam picked us up about 4:00.  He already had another hiker from WI in the SUV.  I asked him if there was a Chick-fil-A in Waynesboro.  Adam said there was but it wasn’t walking distance from the hostel.   He asked if I wanted him to drive by it on our way back to the hostel.   I told him I’d buy him a lemonade if he drove us there.  I placed a mobile order for four lemonades.  When we got there, I saw a sign outside advertising peach milkshakes and quickly placed another mobile order for a milkshake.  it was great getting both a CFA lemonade and a CFA peach milk shake.

We stayed at the hostel for a fourth night.  We showered and did laundry and walked down the street for a buffet dinner.  A sign on the door said they were closed because of electrical problems.  We walked down the street another half mile to a grill and got there at 7:10 to see a handwritten sign on the door saying they were closing today at 7:00.  SO, we walked across the street to a Walmart neighborhood market and bought dinner to make ourselves- steaks, watermelon, baking potatoes, fresh spinach and tomatoes, and frozen broccoli and cauliflower.  Of course we had to carry it all back to the hostel and make it then.  Finally about 8:00, we had dinner and enjoyed every bite!  I cut the watermelon and offered it to everyone else in the hostel.

The woman working at the camp store warned us that rain and hail were being forecast for late afternoon or evening.  


We finally started hiking about 8:30. It was tough getting used to having a full pack after three days of slackpacking.  There was a lot of up and down too which made it even harder. I planned to eat the heaviest food first to lighten my pack faster.  


Susan stepped off the trail to take a potty break this afternoon.  When she started to use her heel to dig a hole, she almost came down on a rattlesnake!  Yikes! Later in the trail, she asked me if I had seen the rattlesnake I had just passed.  It was coiled up asleep right on the edge of the trail and I had not seen it as I passed by.  I turned back and took its picture. Later in the afternoon we had to stop to let a five foot long black snake slither his way off the trail before we could pass.  Four snakes in one day was definitely a record for us.  We’ve done some whole two week hikes before without seeing even one snake.


It was a struggle at the end of the day.  We had only seen a handful of people all day and thought we might be at the shelter by ourselves.  


When we arrived there was a group of high school senior boys here with a teacher and there were several section hikers and thruhikers.  A dozen or more came in after we did too.  There are a dozen or more tents scattered around but only four of us in the shelter - me and Susan and two GA brothers, one from Jackson and one from Alpharetta.

Chicken and dumplings with extra dehydrated peas added is a great way to start a day on the trail.  


We were hiking by 7:15 or so.  Today was a relatively easy mileage and terrain day, but there was not much water on the trail.  We took a side trail about noon to a picnic area in order to eat at a picnic table, use the bathrooms, and get water.  Unfortunately when we arrived, there were signs posted that water was turned off because of low availability.  What a disappointment!  We enjoyed the bathroom and picnic table and were able to deposit all our accumulated trash in the dumpster so it was still a good detour.


As we were coming down a steep section close to a road crossing, I slipped and slid down hard on my right thigh.  Of course, it was also right on a rock. My first thought, “That’s gonna leave a mark!” And it sure did.  


After lunch we pressed on.  The next water source was supposed to be a spring beside a cabin for rent by the PATC.  As we got closer to it, the skies were getting darker, the wind was picking up, and we began hearing thunder.  Just as we came within sight of the cabin, the rain began. Thankfully no one was renting the cabin.  It was padlocked so we sat under its porch at its picnic table watching the rain and we even had phone service! 


There is a hiking saying “The trail always provides.”  I personally think God is the One Who provides and am thankful He provided this spot. We took the time to take off our shoes and let our feet air out.  Susan took a nap and I had a chance to talk to Bryndal my daughter-in-law and wish her a happy four-year anniversary.  The rain tapered off, the birds began singing again, and it got lighter.  While we waited, I called ahead to the campground we were heading to and reserved us a cabin with a real bathroom for the night.  Woohoo!

It was an expensive treat and it is the only time a critter got into our food!   We did enjoy the shower and bathroom, and we each had a separate room with a double bed.  


I laid out my supplies for breakfast right before bedtime to make things easier in the morning.  Everything was in the original packaging.  In the night I heard scratching noises several times.  In the morning several of my food items had been nibbled on.  Susan said she had heard the mice also and had actually gotten up and taken our trash to the outside bin hoping to end the problem.  
That fall yesterday did leave a nasty deep bruise.  Each time I rolled over in the night, it woke me up.  I felt like The Princess and the Pea!


After the night's storm, we had a day of beautiful hiking weather and moderate terrain.  We began by climbing Bearfence Mtn.  Only three miles into our hike this morning we came upon trail magic at Bootens Gap.  I  enjoyed an ice cold can of Coke there, provided by Papa Dude, a Native American former thru hike attempter from OK.  I NEVER drink carbonated drinks except on the trail.


We climbed Hazeltop Mtn and then did a long stretch of ridge walking around Big Meadows Campground.  There were some far-reaching views of the valley below from rock outcroppings along the way.  A half mile or so before we reached our intended shelter, we were resting near a parking lot and met a couple from Worster MA out for the scenery on their drive home from visiting relatives in FL. We chatted with them a bit and they graciously agreed to take our trash out to their car for us.  


We got to Rock Spring Hut before 4:00, a relatively early day, and were surprised to find K1 and K2 there.  We hadn’t seen this husband/wife team since the hostel in Glasgow and thought they were far ahead of us.  It was fun catching up with them. The four of us were the only ones in the shelter.


We got our water from a great spring and had a leisurely dinner.  A doe and fawn wandered through the campsite about twenty feet from us.  We were looking forward to seeing a beautiful sunset as our shelter was open to the west.  As we ate dinner, it started to sprinkle and by the time we finished, it was full out raining.  There was no sunset watching. 


Other hikers started coming in to the shelter area as we were getting ready for bed.  They were tenting but wanted to eat under the shelter roof because of the rain.  That meant there was no early bedtime for us either. By 7:30 they had eaten but couldn’t  seem to bring themselves to go back to their tents.  Their stinky food smells were lingering.  Susan, K1 and K2 were in their bags for the night already at 7:30.  A little courtesy and quieter voices would have been surely been appreciated.","Lewis Mountain Campground Cabin

After 4 1/2 miles we were at Skyland Resort & Restaurant.  We stopped in for their $15 breakfast buffet. It was delicious but it was hard to hike uphill on a very full stomach.


Shortly after we left the lodge we came upon a large group of dayhikers stopped on the trail.  They were watching a bear 25-30 feet off the trail foraging without a care in the world.  He was not concerned about all the humans watching him and nobody seemed concerned about the wild animal so close to them either.  We watched for a few minutes and shot some video and continued on our way.  



The rest of the day was moderate in temperature and terrain.  It was a steep 1.6 mile downhill section from Mary’s Rock down to US211.  My knees and ankles both were aching by the time we finished the descent.  When we finally reached the gap, we used the restrooms, washed up, and filled our water bottles.  Then we took our shoes off and laid down on a picnic table for a little rest.


I was dreading the last 1.4 mile uphill to our shelter but it turned out to be a very moderate grade.  I only had to stop once to take a breather.  I was sweating like a pig though.


We met K1 and K2 (from New Zealand) at the shelter.  Sharp Shin from Nebraska was planning to stay in the shelter also and was gathering firewood for a campfire; he tried to shame us all into helping him gather firewood.  Several others were tenting in the area also.  


We set up our sleeping area, fixed our food and ate, and gathered firewood.  There was a bear box so we didn’t have to throw a rope over a tree branch to hang our food bags.  We enjoyed the fire until we were ready to go to sleep.  By 8:30 it was getting dusky so it was time for bedWe went to bed looking forward to finishing Shenandoah and the state of Virginia the next day and to John picking us up for some well earned rest!","Rock Spring Hut

Again, the weather and terrain were almost perfect.  The rocky steep sections weren’t too long or bad.  We leapfrogged with several hikers from last night’s shelter all day.  When we stopped for lunch, we realized we were ahead of schedule. We tried calling John to let him know but never had service all day.  Around 1:00 a fellow hiker told us he had heard a weather forecast of thunderstorms due about 3:15. 


We picked up our pace hoping to beat the rain.  It began sprinkling just as we reached the road crossing where we were to meet John.  Making it to this road crossing finished my Virginia AT miles!! We were there early; John was not.  Those forecasters nailed it almost to the minute.  Since we were earlier than we had told John, we tried to take shelter under the info kiosk at the trailhead but got drenched.  


We soon accepted that he was not going to be there early and set up Susan’s tarp for some better shelter while we waited.  Wet and still, we got cold quickly.  When the rain let up a bit, I dug through my pack to get my dry sleep clothes out.  It seemed to take forever to peal off my wet things while sitting under the tarp but with some interesting gymnastic moves, I finally managed to get the wet things off and dry ones on.  
The rain finally tapered off and John arrived about 4:30, right on schedule. We loaded our gear into the truck and set off.  John stopped at a few of the overlooks so he could enjoy the views and then we left the park.  


We left VA, stopped at a Cracker Barrel for a hot meal, drove through WV and MD, and arrived at our Airbnb in Enola PA about 9:30.  We unloaded the truck quickly. Even though I was exhausted (on the trail we are asleep by 8:30), I knew I’d sleep better if I showered so I did.  Finally got in bed by 10:30!","Pass Mountain Hut

Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617483,"Even though we went to bed at 10:30, I woke up at 5:30 when it started getting light, just like on the trail.  I was, however, able to pad across the carpeted floor to use the bathroom in the house instead of having to walk through dewy weeds to a smelly privy! I was wide awake so I sat up in bed and balanced my checkbook for the first time in two weeks, read my Bible, and worked a couple Cross Sums.  John had brought groceries from home so I got up and had bacon, a fried egg, an English muffin with jelly, OJ, and milk for breakfast.  I put our wet clothes from yesterday into the washer.  Then I went back to sleep for an hour.  


By then Susan was up and eating so we began going through the stuff we had brought in from the truck so we could organize our next two weeks.  We realized John had not brought any of her boxes of resupply.  Somehow he left them at our home even though they were right next to my boxes of stuff.  We both decided to go back to sleep again, but planned to go shopping later in the day.


I had a nice second nap, dried and folded our clothes, and relaxed on the couch with my puzzle book.  I soaked my feet in Epsom salts while shaving my legs for the first time in two and a half weeks.  


Later we made a trip to Walmart for Susan to resupply.  John grilled steaks and corn for supper and we had watermelon, baked potatoes and broccoli to go with it.  Jon the Airbnb owner came over and brought us a jar of honey just harvested the day before from their hives.  How nice!


It was an easy relaxing day in a comfortable Airbnb.  I got to talk on the phone with Mom, Natalie, Joel, and Matt.","

John dropped us at the trailhead north of Duncannon at PA225 so we could hike south into town.  It was fairly level at first, but rocky, with some actual rock scrambling.  There  were steep downhill switchbacks and a mile or so walking on bridges over the Susquehanna and Juniata Rivers.


When we met John in town, we drove to the infamous Doyle Hotel, a trail icon.  Vicky had cut her iconic long gray braids and now had a short haircut.  I had sweet potato fries and a cheeseburger.  John was not impressed with the Doyle at all and ate nothing.

By 8:30 we had said our goodbyes and John was headed south to home while we were headed north on the AT with full backpacks. The trail was fairly easy to begin the day.  We knocked out 5.1 miles with our full packs in 2:10 and then stopped for a little snack break.


Twice today a military helicopter has flown overhead.  It was extremely  loud.  The first one was just barely above the treetops directly over us.  I wonder if they are looking for someone or just doing training exercises.


We leapfrogged today with one young woman, a couple of young guys, and one single guy.  Except for one slightly uphill two mile stretch in the afternoon, the trail was moderately level and easy, but rocky. 


We had a nice lunch spot in a gravel parking lot by PA325 and Clark’s Creek.  It’s always nice to sit and listen to the water.  A nice young man walked out of the woods up to his car there while we were eating and we chatted.  He was a local realtor and years ago had hiked sobo from Katahdin to here.  Now he is married with two little girls.  He had just been in the area today and stopped to walk into the woods for a few minutes.  He gladly took our little trash bags when we asked; that meant we have a few ounces less to carry.


We got to the Yellow Springs campsites about 6:30.  Only one other girl was there, already in her tent with her food bag hung in a tree.  We set up our tents, fixed our food and ate, and hung our food bags.  The mosquitoes were bad so we were in our tents for the night by 8:00.  There was no phone service at this site.


The next two days are scheduled to be 18 miles and 19.2 miles, in order to get to shelters. If we can’t go that far,  we’ll pick a stealth campsite along the trail somewhere.  Then the third day will be 9 miles into the town of Hamburg, a hotel stay at Microtel, and resupply boxes.","PA225 North of Duncannon PA

It finally happened.  Susan got up about 3:00 to go to the bathroom in the woods and got turned around.  She didn’t make it back to camp until after 5:00.  Since she was up with adrenaline flowing, we got dressed, packed up, and were on the trail at 6:00.  We hiked about a mile to a stream and got water.  We hiked another mile or so and stopped for breakfast at 7:00.  Four guys passed while we ate.  


At Rausch Creek, beavers had built a dam and the whole area was flooded.  We had to wade through below the dam, ankle deep to knee deep water probably about .2-.3 miles.  What an experience!


We stopped at the PA 443 road crossing to call John.  We had to give him info about mailing Susan’s resupply boxes to the right places.  While we were there, a young woman hiked toward us from the east, not from the AT.  She had hiked four hours off the trail and finally found her way back. She is from Finland and started her thru hike March 1.  If she doesn't get better at following white blazes, she won’t reach Katahdin. 


We made it to the next water source by noon and stopped for lunch.  Several thruhikers passed by us while we ate there.  After lunch there were two separate uphill climbs, one was only a half mile or so, the other one was closer to two miles.  


When we finally made it to the top, we were expecting a nice ridgewalk, but we were faced with three miles of rocks of every shape and size.  It was hard to even see a path through them.  


We finally passed the bulk of rocks and had a two and a half mile generally downhill sloping path to our shelter.  We hadn’t had any water source for hours, so we were rationing drinking when we needed it most.  My legs were like rubber.  


We finally got to the shelter, got water, had dinner, and got ready for bed.  Four male thruhikers were with us.  All of us were in bed before 9:00.","Yellow Springs campsite

Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617487,"We were all up and stirring by 5:30 and the four guys actually left between 6:00-6:30.  They’re young and going to hike the 28 miles to get into town. We took our time packing up, eating, getting water, and using the privy.  We didn’t start hiking until 7:30. 


It was a good morning with more beautiful weather.  We met Getaway (formerly Grumpy), a guy our age who has tried thru hiking the last two years and stopped in VA both times. He’s picking up where he left off and trying to finish this year.  We also met two young women, Snack and Late Start, who just started their flip flop in Harper’s Ferry June 17.  We leapfrogged with the three of them through the day.  We had a lovely lunch spot near a rushing creek and got to wash up and soak our feet a few minutes. 


I’ve had a swollen red sore spot on my right shin for a few days.  Every step made it hurt.   I thought maybe I’d hit it on something but it never bruised.  There’s no bite or rash.  When the spot became hot, I realized it was an infection of some kind.  It may be cellulitis according to Google.  If so, I will need antibiotics; there is no self medication.  We were already planning to be in Hamburg PA tomorrow so I decided I’d find a clinic to go to then. The longer I hiked today, the worse my leg felt.  When I studied the tough terrain there would be going into town, I started thinking about getting off the trail as soon as possible. 


We came to a road crossing and sat down to talk it out.  Only a minute or two later a teenage guy showed up from a different trail.  We asked if he knew any clinic or urgent care nearby and he said there was one about 4 miles straight down that road.  It sounded like he’d had experience there.  


We chatted and he explained that he and a friend were camping out for the weekend and had forgotten to bring toilet paper.  His mom was on the way to bring him some.  We asked if she might be willing to take us to the urgent care clinic.  He texted her and she agreed and she arrived within a few minutes. She dropped us off and we went in.  There was NO ONE else in the waiting room.  I signed in and gave them my info and was taken to a room immediately and seen within minutes.  The PA said it looked like cellulitis.  Thanks, Google. He gave me a initial dose of antibiotic and a prescription for more. It was the quickest and cheapest urgent care visit I’ve ever had.


We got a lyft ride to the hotel  we were supposed to be at in another day anyhow.  They had only one room left because of a wedding, a conference, and a reptile show in town.  We took the last available room. It was a nice suite but more expensive than I liked. There was a WalMart with a pharmacy right across the street that stayed open until 9:00 that filled the prescription.
So many “coincidences”!!  Thank you Lord!!!
Susan saw a couple of the young guys from last night’s shelter in Walmart about 8:00pm.  They had done a 28 mile day to get to town.  They had to be wondering how in the world she got there at the same time as them.  She just smiled at them but didn’t stop to talk and left them guessing.","William Penn Shelter

About 4:00 we walked across the highway, ate at Logan’s Roadhouse, and got a few things from Walmart.  


On our way, a van from Cabela’s stopped and picked us up. The worlds largest Cabela’s is in Hamburg PA just across the highway from our hotel, and they provide shuttles from the hotel to Cabela’s and to the trailhead all day.  How cool!


Susan’s caving friend Buzz will pick us up between 9-10 in the morning, drop me at the trailhead, and take Susan to his home in NJ.  From there she will ride the train into NYC to visit her aunt and uncle Monday.  Buzz will bring her back to the trail to meet me Tuesday.
The red spot in my shin is getting a little smaller. It still feels like someone kicked me there with a steel-toe work boot, but it’s not quite as painful to walk.  Hopefully it will continue to heal with a couple of shorter hiking days.  


Since I am so far away from home,  I really want to continue to hike.  I will plan to go a little slower so I won’t get quite as far as originally planned, but I'll still make progress!","

We packed up and checked out of our hotel room and waited in the lobby until Buzz picked us up about 9:30 or 10:00.  He dropped me off at the trailhead to hike back toward Port Clinton.  While we were there, four middle-aged guys hiked across the street.  As soon as they crossed back into the woods, they stopped for a break and I hiked past them.  I expected them to catch me again quickly.  


I hiked 1.8 to the first creek crossing and stopped for a snack break.  Since it was Sunday and I was alone and on fairly easy terrain, I enjoyed reciting James and Philippians out loud and meditating on them. I had not yet decided if I would stop at the shelter after 6 miles or try to do the whole 15 back into Port Clinton.  


While I ate, two young guys passed me, then two girls and a guy passed  me. Once I started hiking again, I came across one of the girls and a guy who had stopped to eat.  They are from Titusville FL, a father-in-law and daughter-in-law.  She is a middle school English teacher named Booboo.   He is One Croc. He got this trial name when blisters  caused him to hike in one regular shoe and one croc.  He had cellulitis in one of his legs and had to come off trail during his thru hike attempt a few years ago; now he’s back section hiking.  


Three of the four middle-aged guys passed us while we chatted. I caught them and hiked with them for awhile. Two are from Fort Payne Alabama and one from St.Louis.  After hiking with them and chatting for some time, I realized I was hiking their pace and tiring out.  I stopped for a drink and let them hike on so I could hike my own hike. I've spent several days hiking without Susan this trip.


Even taking my time, I got to the Eagles Nest Shelter before 2:00.  The fourth guy (Papa Smurf) got here after a bit.  The father in law and daughter in law team from Titusville FL here too.  One other female thru hiker from Tampa, Won’t Get Up, also arrived.


At some point in the afternoon a hiker with a purple bandanna came into the shelter area which was .3 off the trail, sat on a rock by himself, looked at his phone, then got up and left without ever saying a word to any of us.  After he left, the others all filled me in on how they had camped with him before and  how argumentative he had been. Won't Get Up recounted an earlier confrontation she had had with him.  I was glad he had moved on.


We all had a leisurely dinner, got our water, set up our sleeping spaces in the shelter, hung our food bags, and had lots of time to talk.  There were five of us in the shelter and four or five more tenting.  


Won’t Get Up asked if it was okay if she burned a little incense at bedtime and we reluctantly agreed.  She says it helps her sleep. Then she walked behind the shelter while talking on her phone and came back giggling and smelling like pot,  She said it was medicinal. It was forecast to start raining in the night or early morning.  Everybody talked about getting up early to try to beat the rain into town.","Microtel to PA183

Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617490,"It never did rain in the night. Papa Smurf had his alarm set for 4:45 to try to beat the rain into town.  I figured since I was awake at 5:00, I might as well get up too.  I left about 5:45 and it was just starting to sprinkle.  The others were not stirring when we left. Thankfully it was about 60-65 degrees.    


We did not beat the rain. The wetter I got, the less appealing staying at the free outdoor pavilion in Port Clinton sounded. I took my phone out in the rain on the ridge and had service, so I called Microtel in Hamburg and arranged for a room again.  


Along the way I got to watch a tiny fawn wobble across the trail only 10 feet in front of me.  Later I saw two more grown deer at a dirt road crossing.


I passed Papa Smurf after an hour and a half or so and hiked by myself for the rest of the morning.  When the steep downhill began, I stopped to adjust my poles and he caught up and passed me.  My leg was beginning to hurt more on the steep downhill.  I was having to lead with my left leg all the way.  Just before the trail leveled out, I tried to lead with my right (sore) leg and it slid out from under me.  I landed hard in the mud.  


Papa Smurf and I came into Port Clinton together and were walking toward the pavilion to call Cabela’s for a shuttle.  A shuttler name Steve stopped to give us a ride.  He offered to bring us both to Microtel for a total of $10. We jumped in the truck with him and his dog.    


Thankfully the hotel was not as crowded as it had been the before and we were able to get checked in early at 10:20am. I had hiked 9 miles, got a ride from Port Clinton to the hotel in Hamburg, and was already in my room, unpacked, showered, with my gear drying out, and my laundry going by 11:30.  I chuckled, thinking of that old ARMY commercial, “We do more by 9:00am than most people do all day.”


After all the adrenaline of getting off the mountain and into the hotel in the rain, reality settled in and I realized that not only was my cellulitis really hurting again but I must’ve twisted my knee when I fell because it was  hurting too, all on the same leg. 


I ordered Pizza Hut and hung out in the laundry room talking to other hikers while waiting for pizza delivery.   Getaway was taking a zero day here.  One Croc and Booboo had a room too.  I met some others for the first time.  We all plan to be heading out in the morning together.  


Pizza Hut not only delivered to the hotel but straight to my room.  Woohoo!  With my laundry done and half a pizza in my belly, it was the perfect time for a nap! After nap time, I chatted with my Mom and John and caught up on NCIS New Orleans.  I’m finally all caught up on all my shows now.  I took my leftover pizza into the breakfast area of the lobby to reheat it for supper and had three cups of hot chocolate to go with it.  


Back in the room I iced and elevated my leg and knee, hoping to go 14.8 miles tomorrow.  I got to talk to my daughter Natalie and her kids and my son Matt and his son Nolan tonight. I need to do 52.2 miles to finish PA and then all my sections will be connected!!!!","Eagles Nest Shelter

Trail Magic - - Getaway paid the shuttle driver for all three of us.
The two of them got dropped off first, close to Hamburg.  I was driven back to Port Clinton and hiked back to Hamburg.  It was cool and windy but I knew I’d work up a sweat so I started in my short sleeves.  It was a long steep uphill climb out of town 1000 feet of elevation change in about 2 miles with wind gusts up to 28 mph.  It was mostly tailwind so it helped propel me up the hill.  I saw another deer in the woods right off the trail this morning.


When I got to the top, there were crosswinds and I was sweaty and cold so I got out my rain jacket to use as a windbreaker.  Pop and Peabody passed me while I was digging thru my pack.  I passed Peabody as soon as I started hiking again.  


I caught up to Pop and Getaway at the next water source.  Pop left first.  Getaway and I passed him again in Windsor Furnace Park about 11:00. He was going to wait for Peabody so they could lunch there together.  Getaway and I decided to keep hiking uphill to the junction with the Blue Rocks Campground trail and have lunch there.  I got there first and finished lunch but Getaway never arrived.  Either he got lost or decided to stay down at the Windsor Furnace Shelter.


On the uphill climb I passed a couple out dayhiking fiddling with their camelback.  I offered to trade packs with them but they didn’t take me up on my offer.  When I stopped at the trail junction to eat, they caught up with me and complimented me for how fast I was powering uphill with my loaded pack.  They have a friend thruhiking now who is already up in New York. 


After lunch I hiked up to Pulpit Rock.


“Astronomical Park, or as it is locally called, 'The Rock,' this 4.3-acre mountaintop site sits 1,600 feet above sea level on the Appalachian Trail. The installations and equipment at Pulpit Rock offer the serious amateur or the novice an opportunity to contribute meaningful scientific information to the astronomical community or to simply view the splendors of the heavens from our several acres of landscaped grounds.

As the LVAAS became involved in Kawecki's efforts, a more usable road was built and the site soon blossomed into a small campus of observatories. The dark skies on Blue Mountain were a welcome getaway from the light-polluted cities.
In the mid 1990's, a renaissance was under way at The Rock. A new three-story building was under construction for a 40"" cassegrain, the other observatories were cleaned up and repainted, and the grounds got a major overhaul. Trees were cut back, weeds and overgrowth were completely eliminated, piles of debris were trucked out, the road and a new loop were freshly graveled, the whole landscape was graded, and a magnificent new lawn was sown. Through these incredible efforts of the members, LVAAS's Pulpit Rock Astronomical Park is the highest and finest amateur observing site east of the Mississippi.”


(Copied from Lehigh Valley Amateur Astronomical Society website)


The rocks at the top of Pulpit Rock were tricky.  It was hard to follow the trail through the rocky maze.  I met Google and Mary Poppins from Facebook’s AT women’s  group.  As I clambered in the rocks, both of my water bottles fell out of my pack’s side pockets at different times. Thankfully I was able to retrieve them. I fell twice when my poles gave way through the dirt between rocks.  One of my poles bent.  It was an adventure for sure, but I survived and succeeded.  




When I finally got out into the clearing at the end of the rocks, I had a hard time finding a blaze.  Peabody came out of the woods on a different trail than I had used. He couldn’t find the next blaze either.  We decided to go to the rock overlook to see the view and once there, we found our elusive blaze and knew which way to go.  


Going down the north side of Pulpit Rock was just as tricky as coming up from the south side.  At least I didn’t fall or drop my water bottles on the north side.  A uple coming toward me told me to watch out for a big rattlesnake they had just seen.  As they walked past me, they hollered, "" it’s just past that big rock.""  I literally laughed out loud; everywhere I looked there were big rocks!!  I never did the the rattlesnake.


Eventually the rocks tapered off and then I started looking for a place to get off the trail, into the woods, to use the facilities. I finally picked my spot and started digging a hole.  I lucked out; I dug up a 6 inch long oblong rock which left a perfect hole for me to use.  


After picking through rocks for two hours, I was pleased and surprised to see the trail turn onto an actual gravel roadbed.  I followed it a couple miles to Panther Creek where I stopped to chat with Pop who was waiting there for Peabody.  


Black Forest, a 40something from Germany, caught us there.  He had been at Microtel also.  He wasn’t stopping so I fell in step with him and chatted for the next two miles to Hawk Mountain Road.  He slowed his pace a bit but I still had to quicken mine some to keep up with him.  I would’ve lollygagged those last two miles if I hadn’t been trying to keep up with him so it was good.  


When we came to Hawk Mountain Road, Iceman was waiting there with a cooler of soda and Powerade.  More trail magic!  Black Forest and I each took one and chatted a few minutes with Iceman as we guzzled our cold drinks. Iceman has section hiked the whole trail over the course of seven years. 


We had a simple .1 mile walk down the busy road to Eckville Shelter which had three bunkbeds in an outbuilding in the backyard of a house on the road. There was a separate building with a flush toilet and a shower.  There was a picnic table and a spigot with potable water and a charging station on the caretaker’s porch.  Such luxuries!


Susan was waiting there with my resupply box that we had mailed to Buzz.  My leg and knee were both feeling okay. Susan and I had bottom bunks in the bunkhouse with Mountain Goat, a young man from TN and Physics, another young guy from UT.  Probably 10-12 others were tenting on the grounds.  About supper time, Getaway strolled in too.","Port Clinton

I struggled today though.  Lots of rocks all day loose underfoot.  We stopped at the Allentown Shelter at 2:00 for lunch and a nap. It was a beautiful new shelter.  I would’ve agreed to stop for the day there with any encouragement at all.  My head was not in it.

Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617495,"The weathermen were correct.  It began raining in the night and was still raining in the morning.  It was forecast to rain all day.  We sat in our tents trying to decide what to do.  Our campsite was only 1.1 mile from the Knife Edge, a sketchy slanted granite rock slab area.  Sue did not think it would be safe to try it in the rain.  We managed to call John Stempa and arranged to be picked up to go to his “hostel”, which is his garage.  Sue and I parked my truck there and stayed at his place in 2017. 
I managed to take down my tent from the inside while leaving my ground cloth and rainfly attached to the tent poles.  It was tricky, but it allowed me to pack up while staying relatively dry on my ground cloth under the rainfly.  It would’ve been interesting to video the maneuvers I went through to accomplish it.  
We had to backtrack 1.8 miles to get to a road crossing we had passed yesterday.  Instead of making forward progress today, we actually went backward.  We passed Getaway's campsite and told him our plans to avoid hiking the slick rocks of Knife Edge in the rain.  He decided to join us. We all got picked up by John Stempa about 10:30.  He stopped for gas in Palmerton so I bought a chocolate milk, a Powerade, and a Naked Mango at the station.


Our tents and gear got strung up to dry everywhere in Stempa’s garage from the rafters and a makeshift clothesline.  A dehumidifier and a fan ran full blast.  We made plans to leave our stuff in the garage while Stempa drops us off to slackpack two days, and sleep in the garage a total of three nights.

It was a very cool and gusty day.  The winds dried the wet rocks and the rain puddles but there was still plenty of mud around all those notorious Pennsylvania rocks.  


Soon we were at Knife Edge, about 1/4-1/2 mile long section of large sharp rocks seemingly placed pointing upwards in a ridge, like shark fins.  To have fallen off either side would’ve meant a serious injury at the least.  There were times we had to throw our poles down a short section and slide down a rock or two on the seat of our pants to get to the next level.  It was precarious and we were very glad we had not attempted it in yesterday’s rain with our fully loaded packs.


After completing Knife Edge, the rest of the day did not have much elevation change, just more of Pennsylvania’s rocks - big rocks, little rocks, sharp pointy rocks, rocks that tipped when we stood on them, more and more rocks.  At one point I counted over 100 steps taken without my feet ever touching dirt, then I got tired of counting and quit and just focused on not falling or twisting an ankle or breaking another trekking pole.


We stopped at Bake Oven Knob Shelter for lunch about noon and 7-8 other hikers joined us there.  They told us about a woman who had just died of hypothermia while hiking up Mount Washington in New England.  


A mile or two after lunch we came to a road crossing where there was trail magic.  Jimmy from Louisiana who does YouTube interviews of AT hikers was handing out cold drinks. His wife thruhiked a few years ago, and since then they’ve spent a month or so each summer doing trail magic on the AT.  I guzzled an Orange Crush, my second soda of this trip. We got more sad news that Ironman, a hiker just in front of us, broke his arm today and was scheduled for surgery tomorrow.


When we passed George Outerbridge Shelter, a dog barked ferociously at us from inside the shelter and someone inside yelled at the dog.  The front of the shelter had been covered with pieces of tyvec so we couldn’t see inside.   Outside there were two big heavy pots for dog food and water.  It seemed someone who was not a hiker had taken up residence there.  I was glad we hadn’t been planning to stop there for the night.  


We called John Stempa to let him know we were close to town. After another quick half mile downhill, we crossed the Lehigh River, walked along PA248, and made it to the AT parking lot.  He picked us up there.  He said he would call the AT ridge runner to report the person at the shelter. It seems a common place for the homeless to settle in since it is so close to town. 


On the way home he told us about a post he had read about a hiker causing grief up the trail for some others.  Turns out it was Won’t Get Up that I had camped with one night near Hamburg being harassed again by the guy with the purple bandana.  


John brought us back to his home where we showered and ate and chilled out until bedtime at 8:30.


Too much bad news today.","New Tripoli Campsite

Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617497,"John Stempa dropped us off about 8:30 in the morning in Palmerton and we started hiking up Lehigh Gap.  Lehigh Gap is the site of an old zinc mine that is now a superfund cleanup area.  It is not recommended to drink the water there, so we had to carry extra water for the day.  I was totally psyched out about this climb.  Getaway told us yesterday he planned to take the alternate trail around it.  This morning just as I was about to say I would take the alternate route also, he said he was going to do the climb with us.  I couldn’t back out then.  
After a half mile or so, the hiking became rock climbing.  There were some sketchy places where we had to stop and plan out our next several handholds and footholds.  I cannot imagine doing this climb with a full pack.


Several times we had to stop for a break and scoot out of the way so others could pass us.  Once we started into it, we were committed; there was absolutely no way I could have gone down that section, so I had to continue upward.  Several times I had to hug the rock face as I inched my way forward and upward. Several times I had to sit and scoot sideways on my rear.  I kept thinking about the opening of the Mission Impossible movie where Tom Cruise was rockclimbing.  


When we finished, we waited at the top to get the next hiker to take a group picture of us.  We heard voices coming.  I was thinking that I was really going to feel like a wimp if it was an overweight mom with a couple of young kids with her.  Worse!  It was a young couple with a two year old in a backpack!!  I cannot imagine doing that climb with a child on my back!!


I may need new pants now that this is over.  I probably wore out my seat in this pair, sliding on the rocks so much.  It was such a relief to finish, but what a sense of accomplishment!


After that climb, we still had a little over 10 miles to actually hike.  Of course Pennsylvania threw all its rocks at us on this, our last day in PA. There were all sizes of loose jagged rocks to navigate.  We stopped at a nice campsite for an early lunch and rest after that climb.  At Little Gap Road we came upon Jimmy of the Appalachian YouTube videos and his wife with drinks and snacks again.


We met the ridge runner for the area, SMatt and chatted briefly with him.  We gave him what details we could about the guy and dog we had encountered at Outerbridge Shelter.  He had already heard about him and been up to check him out once and was planning to go back again the next day.  


We hiked for awhile with a guy from Cheshire CT who has been doing sections of the AT for 32 years and still has 500 miles to go.  He and a friend were out for a few days.  They both brought cars and they park at opposites ends of a day’s hike.  One of them hikes north while the other hikes south between the cars.  When they meet in the middle of the day, they swap keys. There are many ways to hike the AT.


We only did a total of 12.1 miles but we took our time and took breaks and it took us until close to 4:00.  When we made it to Smith Gap Road, I was done with Pennsylvania, because I had already done two days of hiking in northern PA in 2017.


John Stempa picked us up and brought us back to his house.  We all quickly showered and changed and drove to Easton to an Italian restaurant for dinner.  John’s 21 year old son John and his friend Miranda perform as “MoJo”.  They bill themselves as “acoustic rock”.  They have attended School of Rock in Easton for years. The show began at 6:00.


I had pasta e fagioli, salad, and baked lasagne and I was FULL.  We are used to going to bed when it gets dark between 8:30 and 9:00 so we left about 8:00.  We stopped at Walmart for a few things and got back around 10:00.  It was a late night by hiker standards.","AT parking lot just before Lehigh Gap

Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617498,"We woke about 6:00, pleased to see that it was not storming as had been the forecast.  We packed up, ate, and left John Stempa’s house about 7:30.  We dropped Getaway off at the trail at Smith Gap Road; he was heading north, planning to get to Wind Gap and take a zero day.  


We then drove to Delaware Water Gap and stopped at the Church of the Mountain Hiker Hostel to use the facilities.  Then we drove to the trailhead and were dropped off with our full packs.  It wasn’t raining but it was very humid.


We hiked across the Delaware River Bridge, taking great delight in getting a picture of the PA/NJ state line drawn on the bridge.  We stopped at New Jersey’s Kittatinny Visitor Center and used the facilities there also.


We hiked along a busy road briefly, then under I-80, then through a parking lot, and finally into the woods again.  We had about 3.5 miles of uphill trail but only 1000 feet of elevation change so most of the trail was not drastically steep.  Along the uphill grade I passed my 1300 milestone.  Woohoo!!


We met the ridge runner for the area and chatted briefly with him.  These ridge runners patrol their assigned area, talk with hikers, try to educate hikers in the Leave No Trace (LNT) principles, and try to head off any problems they see, among other things.


We met a retired mail carrier from Wallingford CT who started his hike in Harper’s Ferry a few weeks ago.  He is called Gravity because of the number of falls he has taken.  He actually passed out twice after hitting his head on one fall and a friend had to call 911.  He spent a day and a half at a hospital undergoing multiple tests but no conclusive evidence of a concussion.  We got passed by one young solo male thruhiker who was not very talkative and Blue and Honey, a husband and wife team, who were at the Microtel in Hamburg with us.  


It began to look like it might still rain so we did not stop for lunch.  We wanted to make it to the Mohican Outdoor Center before we got soaked so we really hustled.


We came to Sunfish Pond, a glacial pond and National Natural Landmark.  It was beautiful. The trail skirted the huge pond and we had views from all angles and we took several pictures.  We crossed a pretty stream but didn’t even need to stop for water.   We climbed Kitatinny Mountain and had 360* views from its rocky summit and took more pictures.  


After another stream crossing we were at Camp Road, and we turned off the AT onto it and hiked .4 down that gravel road to the Mohican Outdoor Center.  We arrived about 2:30.  Blue and Honey were already here eating.


We checked into the bunkhouse, where we were given a private room with one single bed and one bunk bed. There were several similar rooms and several bathrooms also. We rented towels for our showers and placed orders for sandwiches to be ready in an hour.  


We unpacked in our room, washed our clothes in the shower as we cleaned up, dressed in our sleep clothes, wrung out our washed hiking clothes, hung them all over our room, and went back to the checkin area to get our food.  While we ate, Gravity came in and decided to eat and bunk here also.It’s funny that we have hiked several days with three guys our age all with G - Y names this trek...Legacy, Getaway, and now Gravity.


We had a relaxing afternoon hanging out. The girl at the office told us someone else had a reserved spot in the bunk room in the room right next to us and that they would be arriving later.  We stayed up until 9:30 swapping stories with Gravity and finally got ready for bed, hoping the latecomers wouldn’t be too noisy when they finally arrived.


We hiked 12 miles but I had already done 1.3 of it on a previous section hike, so I could really only add 10.7 to my AT total.","Delaware Water Gap
",Mohican Outdoor Center,"Jun 16, Sun",10.70
Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617499,"We woke up briefly around midnight when the latecomers arrived.  Thankfully they were not too loud and we went back to sleep quickly.  We enjoyed a leisurely morning, staying in bed until almost 6:30, eating our breakfast with Gravity, and packing up.  Gravity left first, and we left about 8:30.  We never saw the latecomers.


According to the AWOL Guide, today's hike is 1307.4-1320.2.
According to the Guthook app, it is  1305.9-1302.2.


We started the day with a good uphill climb with high humidity to get us really sweating.  We caught up with Gravity and climbed up the Catfish Lookout Tower with him.  We did not see many others today.  It began raining around lunchtime, so we stopped at Blue Mountain Lakes Road, set up Sue’s tarp, and ate under it.  The rain tapered off as we ate.  


Buckshot (VA), Meep (OH) and Fumble (VA) passed us.  They are thruhikers who met on trail early on and have been hiking together.  After lunch, we had to be careful because the rocks were slick and slippery from the rain for the rest of the day.  


We got to the Brink Shelter just before 5:00.  One young male hiker got there just before us and was sitting at the picnic table when we came in.  When we said we intended to stay in the shelter, he moved to the tenting area and set up his tent.  I guess he wasn’t interested in socializing with us old folks.  Gravity got here about 6:00. 


We all set up our sleeping areas, fixed our dinners and ate, and put our our food bags in the bear box.  One other male hiker came into the area as we ate, but he also set up his tent away from us.  


Just as we three were ready to crawl into our bags early, Buckshot, Meep and Fumble arrived to stay in the shelter.  They had taken a sidetrail into town for real food so at least they didn’t have to fix food here and eat.  It was tight quarters with six, but always fun to meet new hikers. More rain was expected overnight.  


12.8 miles?","Mohican Outdoor Center
",Brink Shelter,"Jun 17, Mon",12.80
Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617501,"When I covered up completely in my sleeping bag last night , I woke up soaked in sweat.  If I unzipped the bag and uncovered my arms, I got bit by mosquitos.  Either way, I lost. It made for a long night.


I woke up just after 5:00am and headed to the privy.  It was sprinkling. By the time I got back to the shelter it was raining a bit heavier.  The 6 of us discussed the upcoming miles and the weather forecast. Buckshot, Meep, and Fumble began packing up first. The rest of us waited until they were gone to start moving around.  We ate breakfast and began packing up.  


Our original plan was to hike 15 miles to Rutherford Shelter. Plan B was to hike 6.4 miles to the Gren Anderson  shelter.  Plan C was to hike 3.6 miles to the nearest road crossing and find a ride to Unionville where we were planning to spend the night with an aunt of a friend of Susan.  That friend had left a gift certificate at Annabel’s, a local Italian place, so we could have lunch whenever we got there.



After a couple miles in the pouring rain, it was pointless to try to avoid puddles.  We were already drenched and our shoes were already oozing water with every step, so we just marched right through the puddles.  It was very tedious to be careful of every step so as not to slip on a wet slab of rock.  


My glasses were wet and foggy and almost useless.  At the grassy exposed top of one particular hill, I followed a path across the top and into the woods only to have the path end. I was not on the AT. I turned around and Susan was not behind me.  I had to backtrack, calling out for her.  She was at the crest of the hill where there was a right angle turn I had totally missed.  Thankfully, we got back together.


We made the decision to act on Plan C and stop at the next road crossing.  There was a sign business there that was closed for the day.  We sat under their roof overhang and arranged an Uber ride to Unionville.  


By 11:15 we had arrived at Annabel’s in Unionville.  We changed into our dry sleep clothes and crocs in their bathroom, and they graciously gave us a large trash bag to hold our soaked clothes and shoes.   Once dry, we were able to think about other things.  Sue called her friend Terry’s Aunt Patti to let her know we were in town.   We looked at the menu and ordered hot tasty food.  Sue had a salad and tuna steak and broccoli.  I had a slice of Hawaiian pizza, a bowl of chicken tortellini, and an order of garlic bread knots.  mmmm!


Aunt Patti arrived and drove us to her home in nearby Greenville, NY.  I called John to let him know we were done hiking. We both had warm showers and started our load of laundry.  Aunt Patti had to attend her church’s VBS meeting so Susan and I are both took naps while she was gone.


It was a delight talking with Terry’s Aunt Patti.  She shared with us her photo album of a Coast to Coast hike in Britain with her sister-in-law from 2003. A few years ago I had read a couple’s account on trail journals of this hike and have been talking to John about us doing it so it was nice to get another firsthand account.  


We went to Bottoms Up Restaurant and Pub for a wonderful dinner.  I had prime rib, a baked potato, seasonal veggies, rolls and butter. It was incredible.  There was so much food, I brought home half of it to eat for breakfast.","Brink Shelter

She had a appointment for her niece to cut and color her hair at noon and she called to get us last-minute appointments too. After we were all trimmed, we went to the DLux Diner for lunch. 


My husband called to say he and Jorge were finished at the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown and on their way to pick us up. We had to hustle back to Patti’s to meet them.   Then we drove with John and Jorge to Edison NJ to eat at Harold’s Diner.  We had enough for dinner and leftovers for the next day’s lunch in the car.  We continued driving and stopped at Aberdeen MD to spend the night at the exit where our daughter lived when her husband was stationed at APG. I never thought I’d be back there once they got transferred to Texas.","

It was good to reconnect with her.  I had a wonderful night’s sleep and enjoyed a nice hot shower in the morning.  She fixed me a lovely breakfast of hot tea, bacon, toast, scrambled eggs with smoked Gouda, and a fresh peach off her peach tree.


Deb from the Facebook group met me at Patti’s house at 9:00am and Patti drove us to Branchville, NJ.  We planned to take two days to hike 23 miles back to Unionville and stay with Patti again.  We got on the trail about 10:30am.  Patti hiked a half mile or so with us before heading back to her car.


We saw more people during the day than we thought we would.  A young sobo couple at the Appalachian Deli where Patti parked her car, a group of 15 or so high school freshman and sponsors from Philadelphia out for a week to start off their school year, a couple of older ladies with their dog out for the day, three younger sobo guys, a dad and his two kiddos out for the day, a young couple dayhiking, a young couple from Germany here on a three month visa, another three solo sobo guys, and then another young sobo couple.  We haven’t seen anybody else heading north like we are.


We had nice views from the Culver fire tower. We stopped for a late lunch on Sunrise Mountain where we had cool breezes, a pavilion, and benches.  It is one of the highest spots on the trail in NJ.  We could just make out the New York City skyline far in the distance because it was such a clear day.


We got to Mashipacong Shelter about 4:30.  The shelter was conveniently placed right on the trail and had a privy and bear box but no water source, so we rested a bit and moved on another 2.6 miles north to the Rutherford Shelter which is .4 off the trail but supposedly had a nearby water source.


We arrived there about 6:00 and found the stream sluggish and yucky looking.  It would have to do for the night.  Guthook says there are multiple water sources tomorrow so we’ll be okay.  No one else was at the shelter.  It cooled off more overnight.  We set up in the shelter and fixed dinner.  Deb had a rough time with leg cramps.  I shared some Propel packets with her and hoped they would help.","Branchville NJ

I tossed and turned alot but finally slept. The birds started chirping shortly after 6:00 so we started stirring then too. It was about 7:40 when we left the shelter.  We had .4 to walk to get back on the actual trail.  Yesterday we heard rain from hurricane Dorian was due to hit here today but it was clear for the moment.


We made it 2.9 miles to High Point State HQ where we stopped for breakfast. We ate at a picnic table, used the indoor bathrooms, and filled our bottles from a spigot. Then we had an uphill climb to a neat little observation tower.  We bypassed the High Point of New Jersey which was a war monument off a steep side trail and kept plodding along.  
We only saw 8-10 sobos all day.  All were heading south from Katahdin on a mission to get to Springer as quickly as possible.  The only two interested in slowing down to chat were a couple guys slack packing nobo today even though they were really sobo hikers.  


We had several road crossings, walked along pastures, balanced on the boardwalks through swampy areas, had some rocky stretches that weren’t too bad, and had one last steep but short climb before reaching Unionville.


Patti picked us up about 3:30.  It started raining as we drove to her home. We showered and cleaned up at her house and put our stinky hiker clothes in the washer. Then we took Deb’s truck to leave at the Tuxedo Motel and made a reservation to stay there Monday.  


Patti offered to slackpack us tomorrow’s 16.8 miles so we drove to the trail crossing where we plan to meet her tomorrow at 6:00pm with all our gear so she knew exactly how to get there.  Finally we stopped for dinner.  I immensely enjoyed a French onion soup and a chicken spinach salad.  I noticed a dessert case and ordered a carrot cake with cream cheese frosting.  I was too full to eat it so I decided to take it on the trail tomorrow.  mmm 


We had a lot to do when we got back to Patti’s home and it was later than usual for bedtime.  It was raining outside thanks to Hurricane Dorian but we were dry and warm in real beds and it was supposed to be done by morning.  Tomorrow we will just need to carry lunch, water, first aid, and rain gear.  Yippee!!  Patti  has been a true trail angel for us!!

We loved Wallkill Reserve and all the boardwalks today.  In the afternoon while I was hiking ahead of Deb, I saw a bear much bigger and much closer than I wanted to, probably only 30-40 yards away.  

Late afternoon we climbed the Stairway to Heaven, which I think I would rename for a different location. It was a steep rock climb just over a mile long.   Because it was a weekend, between the boardwalk and the stairway, there were probably over 100 dayhikers.  

I developed a huge blister under my right big toenail that I had to pop to get some relief.  These shoes were great earlier this year but I think my feet have expanded from all the hiking and I need a bigger size already. 

We met Patti at Barrett Road two miles from Wawayanda Shelter.  We took all our gear from her car and loaded our packs. She brought a gallon of water for us so we filled out water bottles.  


We finally got to the shelter about 7:00.  Susan B was already there.  We set up our tents and sleeping things quickly.  I could not find my stove.  Someone else boiled water for me on their stove.  I messaged Patti and she found it in her car.  I’ll get it back in two days.  We fixed dinner and ate in the dark.

Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623210,"We packed up and were on the trail by 8:30.  One of today’s highlights was crossing the NJ/NY line on a rock slab ridge. 
We met a nice local dayhiker up on Prospect Rock, the highest point on the AT in NY.  He pointed out the skyline of New York City in the distance and gorgeous Greenwood Lake at the base of the mountain we were on.  Most of the day was spent climbing over rocks, sometimes on our hands and knees, and navigating down them gingerly, sometimes on the seat of our pants.  There was even one section with seven or eight rebar handholds. 

With a couple miles to go to the shelter, we detoured .2 mile down the road to Bellvale Farms Creamery for ice cream. There must’ve been a hundred people there.  We decided to settle for getting water from their outdoor spigot.  Deb decided to stop hiking there and called an Uber from there to the hotel for the night.  She will shower, eat, spend the night, and go home Monday.    

Susan B and I headed back down the trail for the final two miles to Wildcat Shelter.  We traversed the rocky Eastern Pinnacles and Cat Rocks, both rather sketchy rocky areas that I would definitely avoid in the rain.  

Travis and the other couple from last night’s shelter were already at Wildcat Shelter when we arrived.  It was already close to getting dark so I decided not to set up my tent and just slept in the shelter.   We ate quickly and were all ready for bed before 8:00.  It was another tough day, but I’m glad I spent it moving north on the AT.","Wawayanda Shelter

Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623211,"Susan B and I were last to leave the shelter, about 8:00.  The trail began gently enough but in a couple miles we were climbing steep rock steps up the side of the almost dry Fitzgerald Falls.  


Somewhere this morning three large dogs came bounding over a rise barking at us.  We froze.  Within a couple minutes three older women came over the rise and saw us and began calling the dogs.  None of the dogs listened to them.  I was seconds away from using my pepper spray when they finally backed off.  I would’ve liked to use it on the dogs AND the women who didn’t bother even to apologize until after I told them their dogs almost got pepper sprayed. 


Most of the streams and brooks in this section are dry.  Thankfully trail angels are leaving jugs of water near road crossings.  We joked that only on the AT would we even consider picking up a jug of water on the side of the road and drinkin from it.  


Mombasa High Point, Buchanan Mountain, and Arden Mountain tried their best to kick our butts today, but we conquered them all.  So many times today, we came over a rise or around a curve and looked at a rock wall or pile of rocks we would have to go up and over and I would say  “Oh crap! Another one!”  There was more rock scrambling, bouldering, and steep uphills and steep downhills.  Again, I would avoid this section in the rain.  I’m very thankful it was dry and we had reasonable temperatures today. 


As we faced yet another tough section about noon, we decided to stop for lunch before tackling it.  Just as we finished eating and were strapping on our packs, we saw Travis coming over the top, heading toward us.  We hollered up at her, “Why are you coming this way?” She asked if she was heading south and we told her she was. She turned and headed north and we never saw her again that day.  That  .1 uphill rock climb and the corresponding .2 downhill rock climb took us an entire hour to complete. 


We finally made it to NY 17 where we arranged a lyft ride to the Tuxedo Motel.  Showers, hot meals, and beds!!

There were gentle inclines and descents for about two miles.  We leapfrogged with a young couple from NYC out for the day (Angelica and Enoch) and got to the Lemon Squeezer just before them.  We took pictures of each other there.
The Lemon Squeezer is a tight crevasse between boulders.  If we had our full packs, we would’ve had to take them off and push them ahead of us.   We barely made it through with our daypacks on. 
The young people climbed up the vertical rock section after the Lemon Squeezer before us and let us throw our packs and poles up to them.  I managed to climb up the right side.  Susan tried but eventually took the blue-blazed easier trail around.  I am so proud of myself for that little rock climb !!
Whoever laid out today’s section of the AT was a much kinder soul than those who did yesterday’s!  The inclines have been much gentler and less rocky.  The leaves have begun to change and the acorns have begun to fall.
The climb up Black Mountain began shortly after a snack break at William Brien Shelter, an old, dark, damp, gloomy, CCC-built stone shelter.  From the rocky outcrops at the top of Black Mountain, we could see the Hudson River Valley and the skyline of NYC again. On a clearer day, the views would’ve been even better.
We made it to the Palisades Parkway about 4:45 and crossed the two eastbound lanes safely into the median, then walked .4 to the visitor center.  We got there about 5:02; it had closed at 5:00. The bathrooms were locked up inside. There was no cellphone service, BUT WAIT, there was a pay phone; never mind, it ate my 50 cents.  I was not loving New York right then.  
Susan walked around trying to get enough cell service to schedule a lyft driver and finally managed, but it would be a half hour wait. Not a great ending to an otherwise good day.

We ate in our trucks on the half hour trip to Bear Mountain Bridge Motel.  We left our vehicles there and got a lyft ride back to where we stopped yesterday where the AT crosses the Palisades Parkway to hike back to the hotel.  

We had a gentle climb up West Mountain and were rewarded with views of the Hudson River again.  We could look across the valley and see Bear Mountain and its mountaintop tower where we would be hiking next.  

We hiked down West Mountain and crossed Seven Lakes Road for the third or fourth time in two days.  Then we began on a winding rock step staircase about 2.1 miles to the top of Bear Mountain.  Somewhere along the way, we caught up with Travis again and we enjoyed her company to the top of the mountain and down the other side into the zoo. I kinda felt guilty slackpacking whike Travis was carrying her full pack.

She is from NYC and is only out for a week this time.  She seemed to be interested in my plan next year with Steve supporting me through MA and VT.  Susan B is also interested in joining me for some or all of that section.  

Since this day was going to be a short mileage day, we took our time, taking pictures, clowning around, and enjoying ourselves.  We got cold Powerades from vending machines for $3 each at the top of Bear Mountain, climbed to the top of the lookout tower, and talked with a local couple about our section hiking.

After descending, we walked around a beautiful lake through picnic grounds.  The AT went straight through Bear Mountain Zoo.  We saw a statue and tribute to Walt Whitman and his Song of the Open Road.  We watched the bears in the zoo at the lowest spot on the AT, 120 feet above sea level.  We left the park and were picked up by the owner of the motel.

Susan B showered and left for home in PA. Susan K is driving up to meet me for the rest of the hike. 

I did laundry and showered and enjoyed a brisket sandwich and sweet potato fries at a bbq place right across the street from the motel.  I made a trip down the road to RiteAid for a bucket and Epsom salts and watched the Braves beat the Phillies while soaking my feet and waiting for Susan to arrive.","Tuxedo Motel

Graymoor is a huge Catholic complex of a retreat center, nursing home, nunnery, friary, book store, gift shop, offices, etc.  The AT runs right beside it and they allow hikers to park cars in a special part of their parking lot.  They also allow hikers to camp on their ballfield or under their picnic pavilion and even have a portapotty and outdoor shower there for hiker use.
We parked there, found the trail by 10:45, and hiked south back to Bear Mountain.  It was a short mileage day of moderate elevation.  It was cool and breezy but only a few drops of the expected rain came.  We ended the day crossing the Bear Mountain Bridge and being picked up about 2:30 by our hosts from the Bear Mountain Bridge Motel.
My hair has been driving me crazy this trip.  Since we were back at the motel and cleaned up before 3:00, I called around and scheduled a haircut for 4:15.  It is very short, definitely a wash and go style, so easier for the trail.  I hope I don’t regret it.

Even with stopping to talk to a couple of people we were averaging 2mph. We talked to Brian a guy our age from NC who was section hiking. Since we were going south we met Travis again.  We only saw one sobo guy all day.  We met two older ladies and one single young guy dayhiking.  

We made it back to Graymoor before 3:00, got my truck, drove to pick up Susan’s car, and headed north.  We stopped for gas, cash at an atm, and dinner at When Pigs Fly South BBQ, and arrived at Bearded Woods in Sharon CT about 6:30.  

Hudson and Lu have a wonderful hostel in their basement with bunks for 8 and a large living area.

Lu drove us south to Fahnestock Park and we began hiking north by 9:00.  We arrived at RHP Shelter about 12:30 and stopped to the use the privy and eat lunch with several sobos.  Two trail maintainers were there digging around the root system of a huge tree that had been felled in a tornado some time ago.  They told us how many cords of wood had been  chopped from the fallen tree.  It was a huge number that I do not recall now.


We had made better than 2 mph but still had 9 miles to go to reach Morgan Stewart Shelter for the night.  It began sprinkling in the afternoon as we crossed I-84.  It rained lightly most of the rest of the day.  About two miles from the shelter, Susan was starving and stopped to eat.  It was going to be mostly uphill to the shelter so I continued on, thinking she’d catch me, but I arrived alone by 6:00.  A German guy was tenting there, but we would have the shelter to ourselves. I immediately threw a bear line in a tree while it was still light, swept out the shelter and set up my sleeping area.  Then I started worrying about Susan.  


She arrived about 6:30 and by the time we fixed our dinners it was dark and raining harder.  As soon as our chores were done, we hung our food bags.  In the dark and rain we struggled to find our way back to the shelter but finally located it and got ready for bed.  The rain was only supposed to last through the night.

We met up with Susan B at a rocky outcrop in West Mountain.  She had driven from her home early this morning to hike two more days with us so she could finish NY.  We hiked as a trio for the rest of the day.  


I think we met more sobos today than any other day, plus because it was Sunday, there were many dayhikers out.  We crossed the railroad tracks where hikers can get a ride into NYC right from the trail.  


We stopped at Native Landscapes and Garden Center where I had a Klondike ice cream bar and an ice cold lemonade while sitting in their gazebo.  We also used their restroom, washed up a bit, and filled our water bottles from their outside spigot.  I am very thankful for businesses along the trail that cater to hikers!


After finishing our break, we started a two mile uphill climb.  The first mile was over three stiles and through open fields exposed to the sun.  It was much cooler once we were back in the woods, but we continued uphill for a second mile.  


I was just trudging for the final .2 uphill and .2 downhill.  Two 16+ mile days in a row had about done me in.  I’m glad tomorrow will be less mileage!


The German guy who tented near us last night was also tenting at this shelter.  We quickly set up our tents while it was light, then fixed our dinners and ate by the light of our headlamps.  


While we were eating, a huge dead tree branch came crashing down right where I ALMOST had set up my tent.  I am so thankful I had changed my mind about where to set up my tent.  There is a reason those kind of limbs are called “widow makers”!

Susan K and I hiked on.  Almost immediately we were trudging up a mile ascent.  The mile descent was just as long obviously, but much easier and quicker.  By 11:00 we were at the Ten Mile River Shelter, taking a break, using the privy, and refilling our water bottles. As we sat and talked, we both decided we were ready to end this section.  Back to back 16+ mile days were tough on this 61 year old.  We messaged Hudson and Lu at Bearded Woods and made arrangements to be picked up at Bulls Bridge Country Store.  


We enjoyed the mile walk in the crisp New England fall along the Housatonic River with cool breezes and the soothing sound of running water.  When we reached Bulls Bridge Road, we walked off trail .4 down the road, through a covered bridge, and into the tiny town of Bulls Bridge.  I was enjoying a deli sandwich, a fresh apple, and a bottle of juice when Lu arrived.  


We enjoyed her stories and the beautiful rural countryside and small CT towns we passed on the drive back to Bearded Woods.  We cleaned up quickly and drove two hours back to “Aunt Patti’s” in Middletown NY for the night.  After dinner at a local Italian place, clothes were washing and we were ready for bed.

Steve volunteered to support me a couple of weeks.  My husband John agreed to support me a couple of weeks.  Seven different hikers committed to hiking certain sections with me.
I stockpiled food supplies all winter.  Then in the spring, COVID derailed our plans. The New England states did not want any visitors. The ATC was strongly urging all hikers to stay off the trail.
Disappointed, I found ways to hike closer to home.  Non-AT miles.  I thruhiked the Foothills Trail along the SC/NC border with Susan and Steve.  I hiked a few days with Susan and Gene on the Mountains to Sea Trail in NC, beginning at Clingmans Dome. Susan B joined me as I hiked again on the MST with Susan K, Gene, and Janet.  I did countless boring laps on pavement through my neighborhood.

Steve shuttled us to Bulls Bridge and we three girls began hiking. It was up or down all day, not much level ground, lots od steep grade, and rocky. I had not been training much and I could tell it. 
The Gypsy moths are rampant here. Many whole stretches of forest are defoliated. The caterpillars drop their poop out of the trees on unsuspecting hikers all day and caterpillars are everywhere on the ground. If I stand still more than a few seconds, the caterpillars crawl onto my shoes.
After 10 miles, my thighs were cramping on the uphills and my calves were cramping on the downhills. I began having serious doubts about my plans to finish the AT this year. I wasn’t even sure how I was going to finish the day!
The thing is, when you are in the middle of the woods, you don’t have a choice about finishing or not. The only variable is how long it will take you to finish. I dragged myself up the last uphill, looking forward an easy downhill to the parking lot where Steve would be waiting.  The section is called St John’s Ledges.  It was not an easy downhill. It was huge jumbled up rocks and stone steps with a three foot drop. It took me about  an hour to complete that last mile.

Lu served us another delicious breakfast - fried egg sandwiches, fresh cut up fruit, orange juice, and coffee or tea. Hudson suggested we do this section southbound to do the hills in the morning while we were fresh. We took his advice and had the five miles of hills first thing. 
There were numerous stream crossings with log bridges and one wider crossing that had no bridge. We took off our shoes and waded across. The cold mountain water was only a few inches deep and very refreshing. 
By noon we were at the Silver Hill Campsite area. There was a picnic pavilion with picnic tables, a porch swing, a wooden deck with benches, a nice privy, and space for several tents.  We enjoyed an hour long lunch break.

I just barely made it to Pine Swamp Brook shelter privy in time to use it. It was FULL of those pesky caterpillars. There was a trail maintainer there. We thanked him for his volunteer time in maintaining the AT. He said he had just swept out the privy five minutes before we arrived but the caterpillars were already back in force!
For about 3 hours, we could hear the cars from Limerock Raceway. Somewhere along the trail we finally saw it through the trees. We got some cool video of cars on the track. We were definitely in the nosebleed section or cheap seats to watch that race!
We walked through the town of Falls  Village on city roads after lunch.  We passed some kind of ceremony in a big tent outside of the local high school. The speaker probably hated having to compete for attention with a bunch of hikers passing by. 
We hiked on a new iron bridge over the Housatonic River.  Along the riverside we had good views of Great Falls. Somewhere between Giants Thumb and US44, I passed the 1500 mile mark of AT miles hiked!

We walked through a gorge called Sage’s Ravine. There were multiple waterfalls along a mile-long stretch, in a primordial hemlock forest. It was gorgeous with cool breezes. We saw several young thru-hikers swimming in one of the pools, but we only stopped to soak our feet. The water was COLD! This is one of my favorite stretches on the AT. 
We summitted Bear Mountain, the highest point on the AT in CT, and it was a BEAR! It was a steep climb up rock slabs. There were nice views and wonderful breeezes at the top, and we had a late lunch there. 
We talked with other hikers as we sat in the shade at the top of Bear Mountain. One was a veteran who had been met there by a buddy he hadn’t seen in twenty years. This buddy hiked up the mountain carrying oranges, soda, veggies and ranch dressing. He had brought enough to share and we happened to be the lucky recipients. This is what we call trail magic. 
The rest of the day was more moderate terrain and we were able to hike much more quickly. We were glad to be going southbound as the northbound eta had much longer ascents.  We started about 9:30 and finished just before 6. 
Steve had moved all our stuff from the hostel to a Berkshire Lakeside Lodge, a 60’s? era motel in Beckett MA, and we had an hour drive there.  Our plan is to stay here for several days while we continue hiking north in MA.  After showers, we ate at 51 Park in Lee MA.

Nothing was covering his back but his lack. Thankfully we did not see any other naked hikers during the day!
We started the day with the descent down Mt Everett which gradually became an challenging rocky area called Jug End. AllTrails site says the trail from Bear Mountain to Jug End “is only recommended for very experienced adventurers.”  We managed to navigate it so I guess that makes us experienced mountaineers.
The middle part of the day took us through AT farmlands which was flat easy terrain, but we roasted with temps in the high 80s.  We crossed a long swampy buggy area on numerous bog bridges.  There were hordes of mosquitoes in the muckiness but no suitable water sources and we were parched.
After passing yet another murky stream, I began praying that someone would have left water jugs at the next road crossing. I was very disappointed that there were none when we arrived. We found a spot in the shade to eat our lunch daydreaming about cold drinks and ice cream.
Just another mile down the trail, a sign announced “trail magic” and pointed down the road. A huge tent was set up and was being operated by a church group from Sheffield MA. They offered water, watermelon, dill pickles, and chairs in the shade. They also grilled burgers and hotdogs.  It was incredible! I told them they were an answer to my prayers.  They have been doing this for three years during the “hiker bubble” and we stumbled on their first day of 2021.

We stopped at Tom Leonard Shelter after only 3.5 miles. It felt good to get out of the rain, take our wet shoes and socks off for awhile, and have an early lunch. 
There was one other guy there eating when we arrived.  As soon as he left, Janet and I went beside the shelter to pee, not too far away since it was raining. In the process we heard a guy’s voice.  Another hiker had showed up for a break right at that inopportune moment.  We finished quickly while SusanK and SusanB talked to him and distracted him from our precarious position.
After another few miles, we came to the area called The Ledges. Rain had tapered off so we sat on wet rocks and snacked and appreciated another slightly less foggy view.
The rest of the day was uneventful, just slogging through mud. The terrain was not too bad, so we could move along at a pretty good pace.  
We distracted ourselves by counting the many red efts that were along the trail. The seem to come out en masse when it rains; otherwise we rarely see them.  In a 3.5 mile stretch, we counted 99.

The elevation stayed between 1000-2000 feet almost the whole day so the climbs weren’t too bad. We passed through several fields, some flat marshy areas on boardwalks, and a cow pasture.
We’ve met several thru-hikers heading northbound. Many of the younger guys like to wear thrift store swim shorts and Hawaiian shirts. They seem to think “the gaudier, the better.” Some of their outfits are quite amusing.
It was cool and breezy all day. At one road crossing, a local guy had set up a tent and chairs and had cold drinks and snacks for hikers. Janet and I split a little cherry pie and an orange. The sugar put some pep in my step and powered me up and over the next hill.

Today we hiked southbound from Blotz Road back to the Berkshire Lakeside Lodge where we’ve been staying. We were hiking by 8:30 and had very easy terrain today. There were numerous big bridges and I slipped on one and did a half twist somersault into the muck. No damage done except to my pride. The day was beautiful, warm, and breezy.  
We could hear what sounded like a chainsaw in the distance and we were concerned that someone might be cutting down trees close to the trail. When we finally caught up to the sound, it was a only trail maintainer with a gas powered weed whacker.  
We stopped for lunch at October Mountain Shelter, a large, bunk-and-loft style shelter  and a picnic table. It’s always nice to get to sit at a table for a meal.
Because we were hiking southbound, we saw many of the northbound hikers we’ve been meeting the past few days. It’s always fun to run into hikers you’ve already met. Sometimes they get confused looks on their faces, wondering why they’re passing us going the opposite direction.
We hiked along Finerty Pond for a quarter mile or so and finally found a path to actually get to the water’s edge. We saw some huge bullfrog tadpoles, some of which were starting to grow legs, a few swimming salamanders, and one leech. They didn’t deter us and we had a great cooling swim for a half hour or so.

Our first stop was Tom Levardi’s house. Tom is a legendary trail angel who keeps water jugs on a picnic table in his front yard for thirsty hikers, and he allows them to camp in his yard. His yard is decorated with hiking poles.  He came out to greet us and offered us fresh fruit and sodas. I had a ripe peach and a can of Mountain Dew.

Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640171,"We drove to the post office in the town of Cheshire MA. SusanB left her truck there and Steve drove her to the top of Nt Greylock. She would hike south to her truck then drive home. She had to work for a couple weeks then will rejoin us in the Whites. SusanK, Janet and I started walking along the sidewalk and through a cornfield and back into the woods.  We met Susan B about halfway up the mountain for a brief chat and we continued trudging upward.  5 hours and 8.3 miles later, we were at the top of Mount Greylock.
It was a long tough climb and I took many breaks and was drenched in sweat. A Patch the Pirate sing kept running thru my head, “Little by little, inch by inch, by the yard it’s hard, by the inch what a cinch. Never stare up the stairs, just step up the steps. Little by little, inch by inch, it’s a cinch!”
The closer we got to the top, the more spruce pines there were; it was like walking through a Christmas tree farm … in summer temps.
We had looked ahead of time at the online menu for Bascom Lodge which is at the summit. I was looking forward to a spinach, bacon, and hard boiled egg salad when we got there. It turned out they were short handed and not serving any salads, so I was quite disappointed.  Instead we had hotdogs and orange juice from their very limited menu. We walked around the war memorial tower and enjoyed views of five states.  It was in the high 80s and humid, but at least it was breezy all day.
It was 6.4 miles down the other side, with only short uphills sections to Mt Williams and Mt Prospect Ledge. My legs were shot from the uphill, so the steep downhill was slower than normal. 
After meeting Steve, we had to stop for gas on the hour long drive back to the motel. We got back shortly after 8:00. I showered, heated my microwaveable meal, gathered our dirty clothes, and headed to the laundromat. 
I ate there while the clothes washed. After sorting four peoples clothes back at the hotel, we were missing two socks. I drove  back to the laundromat and found them.
By 10:45, I was finally sorting food and gear and packing my backpack for the next four days of hiking. The rest of the extra resupply food and gear got boxed up to stay in the truck. It was midnight before I turned out the light. It was the longest toughest day of the trip so far.

We were soon in the woods going uphill. The first few miles were tough but then the terrain turned to more rolling hills. 
We crossed the MA/VT line where the AT is the same as Vermont’s Long Trail. We had lunch there and talked to several make hikers and one lady, Liz, who were all starting the Long Trail. We also passed the 1600 mile point today. 
We made it to Congdon Shelter about 7:00, set up our tents in the spots that were left, had dinner, and went to bed. We are tenting close to two women hammocking who have a large German shepherd with them; they are doing the Long Trail.
The shelter is full and several others are tenting.  After dark, we heard several other hikers arrive at the site, set up tents, and crash for the night.  The German shepherd barked at me in the night when I got up to pee and scared me to death!","MA2/Williamston/NAdams

Both Susan and I had to put in knee braces to deal with this area.  After this tedious descent, we crossed the highway and went down to the river for water and began the equally steep ascent up the other side.The rest of the day continuall trended uphill. We leapfrogged with the women with the German shepherd all day. The final two miles up to Goddard Shelter were tedious after a long day but we finally arrived about 7:00. The shelter was full and there were numerous tents scattered around the surrounding woods. There was a great piped stream right on the trail before the shelter which was very convenient after a tortuous day. We quickly picked out our tent doors, cleaned up, fixed dinner, and collapsed into our tents for the night.","Congdon Shelter

Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640175,"We had breakfast and packed up early. We talked to a young couple at the shelter from WI who were out for her first backpacking trek.  We were looking forward a little shorter hike with less strenuous terrain this day.  In only .3 mile we were at the top of Glastonbury Mountain. Janet snd I climbed the lookout tower and had amazing 360 views.   We stopped at Kid Gore Shelter after about four miles and had another meal. 
After another 4 miles, we stopped at Story Spring Shelter for another meal. We reached Steve on the phone and made plans for him to meet us the next morning and take our gear so we could slackpack again because we were planning a 17.5 mile day.
  We were joined by the WI couple and the women with the German shepherd. The wind was picking up and we could hear distant thunder, but we’d had similar conditions the past two days without ever getting rain. 

Within fifteen minutes of leaving the shelter, the rain began. Soon it was pouring and the wind was gusting. It was scary for a half hour but we kept hiking. We eventually stopped trying to avoid puddles because the trail became a stream.  The rain stopped after an hour or so.  We actually stepped in a real creek to clean our shoes and hiked on. At least the trail was trending downhill so it was somewhat easier hiking.
When we finally arrived at the campsite we were greeted by an off-leash springer spaniel running up and barking at us. We tried to find places for our three tents away from the dog and his owner but finally had to return to the area where they were. There is nothing quite so annoying after a miserable day of hiking in rain as a dog owner who pretends that his dog will listen and obey his commands. He eventually put the dog on leash and we set up tents just before the rain began again. We each cooked our meals in our own tent vestibules and ate alone in our tents, talking back and forth. When the rain finally stopped, it was too wet to sit outside and talk so we did our food storage and retired early.","Goddard Shelter

Steve met us and we gave him our wet tents and all our non essential gear.  We kept only our rain gear, first aid, and lunch for the day.  We began the day with a four mile ascent up Stratton Mountain.  It gently rained on us as we hiked upward.  I had been dreading this climb  after my long trudge up Mt Greylock. I was pleasantly surprised with the much easier grade and totally shocked when we arrived at the summit after only two hours. It had stopped raining but was foggy so I didn’t bother climbing the observation tower.Knowing we had a long day, we pushed on and limited our breaks. We made good time with the less strenuous terrain. It rained on us again two separate times but we still managed to get to our pickup point ahead of our off he annex time.Steve had already Che Jed us into the Green Mountain House Hostel and carried in all our gear earlier in the day.  When he picked us up, we stopped for dinner before even cleaning up.

He is a fundamental independent Baptist pastor from MO who was at the hostel with us.  He began hiking in Harpers Ferry WV and has lost 55 pounds already!  He plans to hike to Katahdin where his wife will meet him and drive him to GA to hike back to Harpers  Ferry to complete a flip-flop hike.   
We first climbed Bromley Mountain which is a ski area. As we came up the hill, the ski lift looked like a UFO. There were only limited foggy views from the summit but we got a group picture with Polar Bear there.
Everything was wet and slippery from the rain. I slipped and fell 5 separate times during the day.  Thankfully, no injuries. Just mess.
We passed Styles Peak and Peru Peak but did not stop for lunch until about 2:30 when we’d hiked 10.1 miles and finally arrived at Peru Peak Shelter. It’s not much fun taking breaks along the trail in the rain.
Our shoes were soaked and muddy and oozing with each step because the trail was a mess. After awhile we stopped trying to avoid puddles and muck; it was pointless. We even purposefully stepped in a clear stream toward the end of the day to try to clean our shoes. The trail was literally a stream. There is a reason the state is nicknamed Vermud. 
We did begin to see lots of moose poop which was a first for us.  We never actually saw moose though. 
When we finally arrived at Big Branch Shelter, there were only two teen guys in it.  They had a good fire going which we enjoyed. They are doing the Long Trail. Polar Bear had camped with them before.  We four quickly claimed our spots in the 6-person shelter with them so we wouldn’t have to pack wet tents the next morning. It had finally stopped raining but the ground was still a mess.  
I had decided not to bring my crocs for this section to decrease pack weight. I really missed them! I had to wear my wet shoes and socks until bedtime. I will not leave those crocs out of my pack again!

Polar Bear left early with the long Trail boys, intending to do bigger miles than us.  We took our time packing up and eating breakfast after they left.
We were walking in puddles and muck right away.  We stopped at the first road crossing and had cell service do we each called our husbands.  We stopped again at Little Rock Pond Shelter for a snack. We passed a beautiful pond but it was too cool to swim.
There were lots of Sunday dayhikers on the trail.  We passed Greenwall Shelter where we  intended to have lunch but day hikers told us there was a waterfall just ahead. We kept hiking and soon ate lunch by the cascades of Bully Brook.
We climbed another Bear Mountain in the afternoon; it seems every state on the AT has a Bear Mountain.  We were at Minerva Hinchey Shelter by 5:00.  There were

That means the next day will be 13.7 to Gifford Woods and a hotel. It turned out to be a great decision because I woke up with an upset stomach.  I had to make two trips to the privy before we left  camp and more quick trips into the woods through the day. It left me really draggin’ and I adopted that trail name. When I meet new people, I say, “Hi, I’m Draggin’.”
We made multiple long stops throughout the day.  1. There was a neat view of Rutland Airport just a mile uphill from the shelter.  2. There was a huge suspension bridge over Clarendon Gorge.  3. There was another viewpoint up the other side of the gorge where we could see the airport again. 4. There was a steep rocky climb up Beacon Hill to a nice level lunch spot. 5. There was a large stream where we soaked our feet and tried to clean off the last few days of trudging through rainy mucky Vermud.
We finally made it to the shelter just before 5:00. We met Pink Lady, an Israeli thruhiker, but she only stopped long enough to cook and eat dinner and then hiked on.

SusanK and Janet were still eating and packing when I left.  It was not too steep a climb but the rain and wind and mud made it strenuous. I was surprised to reach Cooper Lodge Shelter at the summit with only one male hiker, Perch, passing me on my climb.
I quickly changed out of my wet shirt and fixed my breakfast. Janet joined me shortly thereafter. The four ladies we had met at Green Mountain House stopped in for a minute on their daily slackpack. After SusanK joined us, we all finished eating and began descending in the wind and rain and muck. It was tedious; the rain eventually stopped but the wind still shook water out of the trees onto us. 
We slogged through mud and muck most of the day.  At the division of the AT and the LT, we arrived simultaneously with Liz. It was neat to talk to her again before we parted ways.

They would give him the truck so he could come spend ten days with me and they would get a rental car to drive home.  


It was fun running into nobo hikers that I had already met since I was hiking sobo for the day.


First I met the young woman from the Cooper Shelter wearing the new shoes she had reserved the day before. Then I met Pink Lady and a couple who the girl has my same pack, and of course I met our dog friend. The dog was off leash but when he heard me, the guy commanded ‘hold’ and the dog actually stopped.  No barking either. I talked to him a few minutes; he said he had just got the dog at the VT border. I guess I’ll cut him some slack. I passed 2 other couples and 3 other guys. Like Liz said, they all look alike with their dirty clothes and long beards. 


Around noon I had a snack by Thundering Falls.  There are many day hikers in this area. Perch also came by. He had stayed at the Yellow Deli in Rutland and said only good things about them.  He said they had not tried to convert him. 


I passed a gorgeous lake with a dock and some folks kayaking. I wanted to swim so bad! I decided to keep hiking so I could get back to the hotel and clean up before John arrived. I made it to Gifford Woods State Park a bit after 1:00. I then had a 1.3 mile road walk uphill back to the hotel.   


I called the front desk to ask why our room had not been cleaned. They offered to move me to a queen room instead of the two double bed room I’d shared with SusanK. I quickly gathered all my stuff and made that switch. 


When John arrived, I had to go through all the stuff I had asked him to bring me. Then we found the only laundromat in town. We went to eat at the Inn at Long Trail and came back to the hotel to sit in the hot tub before calling it a night.","Stony Brook Road

Late in the day, we passed our dog friend guy walking with his dog and carrying a grocery bag on the sidewalk in Norwich.  I pulled over to offer him a ride.  He didn't recognize me at first. He had done 20 miles already and was only four houses from his destination so he didn't need a ride.

I saw my first five sobos, 1 nobo trail runner, and 1 nobo section hiker who was hiking south for the day; his wife is following him up the trail in an rv. 


I had a nice chat with a woman and her two year old while I stopped at a water source.  She and her husband were 2016 thruhikers .  She was out putting up posters and looking for a lost dog. 


I ate lunch at top of a no-name peak on a bench with a view with a sobo from Gainesville GA whose mom teaches at Hightower Elementary in my former hometown of Conyers GA.  She started at Katahdin 6/1. A young nobo passed us while we ate and chatted. Silver Goat stopped to chat a few minutes; He and his wife started at Springer.

An older local couple were day hiking and stopped to fill us in on local history.  After lunch the trail starting trending downward. It seemed like I spent half the day in the woods and half walking through open fields. 


When I stopped for water later, 3 more nobo guys passed me. Later as I took a break before my last uphill, two young women section hikers stopped to chat as they came southbound.

I took my first sit down break for a half hour to write in my journal and send some texts. Silver Goat passed me and we chatted. He’s probably older than me. Two other nobo guys passed me at my break spot also.


After a half hour break,  I started moving again. I caught up to Silver Goat as the trail became a road walk through Norwich VT.  We chatted as we walked down a street, onto sidewalks and through town. Soon we were at the CT River bridge; halfway across was the VT/NH border. 
In town, Silver Goat wanted to find a drug store to get compression socks. I suddenly realized I had eaten nothing since breakfast at the hotel and I had many choices of town food within reach. I passed up the street hot dog vendor and went looking for pizza, but the outdoor seating at Murphy’s on the Green caught my eye. I scanned the menu and became a customer. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger and mixed green salad and called my mom while waiting for my order. Seeing my backpack on the sidewalk beside me, several passers by stopped to ask AT questions. I felt like a celebrity.


It was hard following blazes and hiking through town on such a full stomach. I was glad to get back into the woods finally.  The trail was uphill and not easy to follow for a mile or so out of town.  


I met John right at 4:00. 15 miles in 8 hours, which included a lunch break of over an hour.  I was amazed that I didn’t even feel tired! After cleaning up back at the hotel, we ate microwaved meals and I did my laundry before bedtime.

When we got to the trailhead at 8:00, John hiked in with me .63 of a mile until the trail got messy. The rain had tapered off but as soon as he left, I went through a field of overgrown whatever.  I could not even see my feet, but by the time I made it through, my shorts, shoes, and socks were soaked. Even without new rain falling, water still dropped from the trees when the wind blew fir the new few hours. It was still overcast until around noon.


I made it 4.41 up Moose Mountain in about 2.5 hours; the view from the south peak was socked in with fog. I stopped at Moose Mountain Shelter which was just off the trail because I had heard about the privy there. It has no walls; it’s just a throne under a roof.  It truly gives new meaning to the term “open concept”.  I kept going across the ridge to the north peak of Moose Mountain, where there was no view either.


Along the way I was passed by one young nobo, and I crossed paths with three sobo section hikers.  I picked what seemed like a nice rocky outcrop for my lunch spot but must’ve killed at least 30 mosquitos while I hurriedly downed my lunch.  Just after I began hiking again, I met 2 young sobo guys. They started at Katahdin 6/8. They were going faster uphill than I was going downhill!


I enjoyed a nice walk between Goose Pond Road and a beaver pond; the pine straw carpet was cushy under my feet. I saw stacks of lumber on that stretch in two places and wondered why it was there. Then I got to the pond and found most of the boardwalks around it were in sad shape, rotted away. I guess some much-needed trail maintenance is being planned.


I met a local woman with her dog coming down while I was trudging uphill.  The weather had cleared up and after I finally made it up and over the peak, I was rewarded with several gorgeous view from Holts Ledges.


I passed the blue-blaze trail to Trapper John Shelter. It was named for Trapoer John McIntyre from M*A*S*H who was a Dartmouth alumni but it was .3 off the trail so I did not check it out.


I struggled the last two miles between Grafton Turnpike and Lyme-Dorchester Road. I was tired, and all the mud and rocks really got to me and slowed me down. I finally met John at 4:15.

The weather report said it should stop around 10 and just be overcast for the day, so I set out for the trail .  The 3.8 miles up Smarts MountaIn took me from 8:10-10:45. It was windy, wet and cold. There were many sections of slanted wet granite slabs to be navigated.  The trail was often a stream.  The uphill was tedious and monotonous and lonely. I prayed for someone to hike with for the day.


When I finally reached the fire tower at the top, there was one woman there trying to get cell service. It was too foggy to bother climbing the tower for non-existent views so I quickly made my way into the 4-sided fire warden cabin and closed the door to be out of the wind. I pulled off my wet shirt and put a dry one on. I sat down on the wood floor to rest and eat an early lunch.  


The woman from the fire tower came in shortly and introduced herself as Buttercup. She is a 73 year old from Galveston Texas who began her hike in Harpers Ferry.  She intends to hike to Katahdin, then flip back south and hike back to Harpers Ferry.  She had spent the night there in the cabin with several male thruhikers (including Polar Bear) after hiking only 6.2 miles the previous day from the Trapper John Shelter. All the others had left much earlier in the morning, but she had hung around hoping for the rain to stop.


When I finished eating and began packing up, Buttetcup asked if she could hike with me. I agreed and we set off. I had to slow my pace for Buttercup as we descended Smarts Mountain, but it was nice to have someone to hike with and talk to. Even though it wasn’t raining anymore, the trail was a mess; we slogged through mud and puddles all afternoon. 


As we began to ascend Mount Cube, the trail got worse and Buttetcup got slower.  She had her full pack and I only had my gear for the day. There was so much running water that there were several places where it seemed we were hiking straight up a waterfall. When we finally topped Mount Cube, I took a picture with the sign because there was still fog blocking any views.  I messaged John to let him know I’d be later than I anticipated because I had slowed down to hike with my new friend. 


Buttercup  had wanted to get down the mountain to the Hwy 25 road crossing and get to The Barn Door Hostel for the night, but their last pickup was scheduled for 4:30 and there was no way she would make it down in time. I told her we would take her if she kept up with me.


As the afternoon progressed, it got cooler and darker. After an hour, I finally told Buttercup I needed to hike at my own pace and get down quicker so that John would not be worried that I was so much later than we planned. I had no cell service to reach him and explain. After being sure she had her headlamp, I left her and hiked down alone. I didn’t even bother trying to avoid puddles or mud or look for rocks for stream crossings; I just slogged through it all.  I actually went in up to my knees in one stream.


I finally reached the road crossing and John and the truck. It felt so good to peal off my wet shirt and shoes and socks and put on dry socks and shirt. I cleaned the mud off my legs with my wet bandanna. John had bought KFC chicken strips and I had one cheese stick and a Baby Ruth left in my pack. I devoured them all. 


It was just over an hour later that Buttercup emerged victoriously from the woods. We drove her 15 minutes to the hostel and I went in to catch up with Polar Bear. John and I still had an hour trip back to our hotel. We stopped at Burger King and had burgers, fries, and milkshakes in the car.


Back at the hotel, I enjoyed a hot shower and clean, warm pajamas. It took a half hour to rinse out my muddy shoes and socks.

It was nice to dress in clean cotton shorts and tshirt instead of stinky drifit hiking clothes. It was even nicer to wear flip flops instead of wet socks and shoes!


John and I walked a half mile to the Four Aces Diner for breakfast. He had his usual pancakes and bacon while I enjoyed a tasty ham, egg and cheese quesadilla and a hot sweet tea. On the wall were many quotes, among them “I’d rather be morally right than politically correct.” and “THINK! It’s not illegal yet.” 


On the walk back to the hotel, we meandered through the Veterans Memorial Park, saw the sculpture honoring each of the military branches, and stopped at a kiosk showing the points of interest for a walking tour of historic White River Junction. 


I caught up on my trail journals while doing laundry in the hotel laundry room. I took a nap. I retreated my clothes with Permethrin for the second half of my trek. I began sorting and packing things to send home with John, things to leave packed in the truck for my drive home in August, and things to carry in my backpack for the rest of the trip.  We made another Walmart trip for John to get supplies for trail magic tomorrow.  We found a place to eat a late lunch at a cafe in Dartmouth.  All in all, I got much done and had a very relaxing and DRY day!","

We bought sodas, bananas, little oranges, snack cakes, mini bags of fruit snacks, and mini candy bars. He has hand wipes and trash bags and camp chairs. I bought a spiral notebook for hikers to sign their trail names and when and where they started.


I’ve worn my new shoes around town a few times. Today I wore them on the trail. I put the old ones in the truck so I’d be able to switch if I needed to when I met John for trail magic. 


I hiked a total of 4.9 miles to the road crossing where John was providing trail
magic in a little over two hours.  I had an early lunch there since I had a chair, along with two cans of Mountain Dew and a banana to go with the chicken wrap and chips I had packed. 
I met up with John at the next road crossing about 1:30.  All in all, I did an easy 9.8 miles for the day in 5 hours even with my long sitdown lunch break.


We made yet another Walmart stop on the way back to the hotel. After cleaning up and eating, I had time to catch up on my trail journals before SusanB arrived. Tomorrow, we hike Moosilauke!","NH25A, Wentworth

SusanB drove up from PA yesterday and spent the night at Hotel Coolidge last night. John dropped us off about 8:45 to hike Mt Moosilauke.  He went into Lincoln for breakfast and then drove to our pickup spot to do trail magic again.


Everyone had advised us to hike sobo so we did. The first 3.8 miles was steep and rocky, mostly along side a stream with beautiful cascades. There were several sections with rebar or wooden blocks bolted into the flat rock face of the mountain. It was strenuous hiking. We barely averaged a mile per hour.


We got pictures by the sign marking the top at 4802 feet. We hiked on, eager to get below treeline and out of the wind.We met several nobo hikers who told us about John’s trail magic.  One dad out with his sons and nephews, a group of six, was a group we had met in CT and taken pictures for them two weeks ago.  At the time, they had two dogs with them that were really struggling in the heat and humidity.  They have since sent the dogs home. One of the teens said about John’s trail magic snack cakes, “Those were the best DingDongs ever!”


We made it to the road crossing about 4:45. We were cleaning up the leftover sodas, candy, and fruit when more nobo hikers came by.  We offered them goodies.  One guy was heading to the nearby Hijers Welcome Hostel so we gave him a ride and also donated our leftovers to the hostel.  


We had an hour drive back to the hotel, but we stopped at Price Chopper for SusanB to get a few things and at Panera Bread for supper on our way. Once we showered, I did one final load of laundry and then packed my full pack for the next day, the bag of things I would not need in the huts to leave in Peter’s car, the duffel bag with clothes and toiletries for my ride home after Katahdin, and my storage box of extra resupply stuff that needs to go home. It was late when I finally went to bed exhausted.","Kinsman Notch

We wanted to hike hut to hut in the Whites but the huts we wanted were already booked in November when we tried to make our reservations.  We had to jump ahead to hike the northern half of the Whites first to get hut reservations for consecutive nights.  So we’ll hike hut to hut there for six days, then shuttle back to Kinsman Notch and fill in the miles we skip.   We drove almost two hours to Kinsman Notch at AT mile marker 1846.3 with John and SusanB. We met Gene, SusanK, and Janet there.  They had driven up the last two days with Gene’s husband Peter.  We all left our  tents, stoves, sleeping pads that we would not need as we stayed in the huts, in  Peter’s car. Peter left to do some birding and visit his MA friends.  John left to visit the a historic Presidential spot and then drive to New Haven CT. He will have dinner with friends there, leave my truck to be fixed and detailed, and fly home Sunday.


We started our Hike to Mizpah Spring Hut about 10:00.  The first three hours were all uphill, with many steep sections and many technical rock scrambles, some requiring “Spiderman moves”.  I was very thankful for my long legs and how far I could reach between toeholds and fingerholds . We barely averaged a mile per hour.  It was strenuous but there were some great views along the way. 


The second three miles gave us a mixture of uphill and downhill at least, but none of it was easy!  In several places, I had to sit down and slid down a rock face on the seat of my pants.  At one point I complained out loud, “I came out here to HIKE, not to ROCK CLIMB!” 


We met a couple our age thru-hiking who was going to the same hut as us - Amy (LILO- last in, last out) and John (Sweep) from Michigan. He wears a plaid hiking kilt and has long gray curly hair and beard. 


We finally arrived at Mizpah Spring Hut about 5:30. When we checked in, they did not have SusanB’s reservation. Thankfully there were not full, so we all got our bunks, unpacked, changed out of wet clothes, and cleaned up some. There are inside toilets snd dinks, but no showers here. There is a solar powered kitchen but no power in the bunk rooms or bathrooms.  


Supper was served by the hut “croo” at 6:00 - curry pumpkin soup, herb bread and butter, salad, roast turkey, corn, mashed potatoes, gravy, cranberry sauce, and chocolate cake. It was all good and all we could eat.  Staples are flown in by helicopter drop at the beginning of the season; perishables are packed in twice a week by the croo on foot.  There is no road access to the huts. 


We had a couple named Pat and Robin at our dinner table. He’s trying to finish section hiking the AT this year and she has joined him for this section of the Whites.


After dinner the croo introduced themselves; there were five girls and two guys.  They each said “I use she/her pronouns” or “I use he/him pronouns” to show us how progressive they are I guess.  The men’s and women’s bathroom doors each have paper signs tacked to them saying, “Anyone can use this bathroom, regardless of gender identity and/or expression.”  It is odd to be sitting in a stall and hear two guys having a conversation at the sinks just outside the stall door.  BUT we are inside in dry bunks and had a delicious hot supper so we’re happy. The five of us are in a bunk room with Christina “Sheep” from Dallas TX.

I slept well.  It rained in the night.  The hut croo woke us all up at 6:30 singing. I felt like I was back at summer youth camp.  We had a huge breakfast at 7:00 with oatmeal, scrambled eggs, sausage, coffee cake, and cocoa or coffee.  We packed up and headed out into the rain about 8:45.  


The trail leading away from the hut was steep rocky steps and a few rock climbs, but then it returned to actual hiking.  The trail was much more moderate than it was the day before.


We went over Mt Pierce, Mt Eisenhower, and Mt Franklin and skirted Mt Monroe. Because of the rain, the trail was flooded in many places and we had to pick our way carefully around and through huge puddles. The trail was continually heading up over treeline and then back into the trees. We leapfrogged with both Pat and Robin and with Sweep snd Lilo.  At one point we saw huge bags of rocks and stacks of lumber that had been brought in by helicopter in preparation for trail maintenance.


We arrived at Lakes of the Clouds Hut before 2:00.  We checked in, unpacked, and changed into dry clothes in our bunk room. Christina, Pat and Robin are here again also. There are about 40-50 guests here, including several children. 


Before dinner there was an informative talk about the green practices of the huts. Dinner was barley mushroom soup, salad, cheesy bread, stuffed shells, and chocolate cake.  After dinner there was another informative talk about the history of the huts and the local flora and fauna. We were all warm, dry, fed, and ready for bed before dark.

Steve messaged us saying that when he hiked from Lake of the Clouds to Madison Spring, he didn’t arrive until just before dinner so we should leave as soon as we could after breakfast.  


We made the gradual climb up Mt Washington in about 1 1/2 hours, right before the rain began. Inside the visitor center, we bought and sent postcards to family and friends. I bought a magnet  to add to my collection.  I enjoyed a slice of lemon cake and hot chocolate.  We watched the cog railroad trains depart down the mountain.


All supplies for the huts have to be packed in, they use composting toilets, and they have no trash cans. They use solar power, so there was no hot water or outlets for guest use. Whatever we packed in, we had to pack out. Since there is road access and railroad access to Mt Washington, there were also trash cans. We got rid of three days of trash. We used flush toilets and hot water in the bathrooms. We also found outlets to charge our phones.


By the time we were ready to leave at 11:00, the rain had mostly stopped. Amazingly, there were no winds on the mountain known for the worst ever recorded winds.  We got pictures outside, then crossed the railroad tracks, and began descending.  


span class=""Apple-converted-space""> We had several falls between us. We again leapfrogged with Swerp and Lilo and with Pat and Robin.
My stomach began rumbling, and I had to run off the trail twice to attend to business.  I took Imodium and hoped for quick relief.  


We FINALLY reached Madison Spring Hut just after 6:00. We unloaded gear in our bunk spaces and cleaned up quickly so that we could join dinner which had already begun. The baked chicken, rice, broccoli, salad, fresh baked bread, black bean soup, and glazed gingerbread cake were all delicious.

We left the hut about 8:30 after another  hearty breakfast. The goal for the day was 7.8 miles to Joe Dodge Lodge at Pinkham Notch. This was not another ordinary hut.  It was more of a hotel with road access. We would have a private room and shared showers! What a treat to look forward to all day!

The day began with a .5 rock scramble ascent up Mt Madison in 40 mph wind gusts above treeline. It took us about an hour. Then began a torturous 2 mile steep downhill over large loose boulders most still above treeline. Even Warren Doyle in his Appalachian Trail Institute called this “a BAD descent”. 


This took us close to three hours. At least we did not have any rain to make the rocks even worse. I have been wearing shorts and my legs were bleeding in several places from scratches from tree branches, brush and rocks.


On the way down, we took a snack break on the side of the mountain.  There was a nice rock slab for us to sit on just off the trail. There was just a small space where we all took turns peeing.  Across the valley, we could watch hikers walking along a ridge coming toward us. One tall hiker with a huge backpack and a smaller hiker in a red jacket stood out in particular.


When we started down our side of the mountain and finally met them coming up, we saw it was a father and son.  We  told them we had been watching them across the valley and they said they had been watching us too. We all started giggling and wondering whether they had seen us all taking turns peeing!


We leapfrogged with Pat and Robin all day. Finally around 2:00 the trail gave us a break. We got below treeline, the wind stopped, and it warmed up.  The terrain became more of a trail than a rock scramble. We had several beautiful waterfalls and cascades. We made much better time. As we crossed one stream I tripped and fell face forward on some rocks. I hit just the side of my kneecap. It did not break the skin but it hurt the rest of the day. 


We made it to Joe Dodge Lodge about 5:15, checked in, took showers, and enjoyed a wonderful buffet dinner of roast beef, carrots, mashed potatoes, peas, bread, salad, soup, and lemon blueberry cake.I had a big pity party in the room after dinner as I iced my knee. I was afraid my hike was over and I hated that thought.  I did what I could do: I ordered a bag lunch from the cafeteria for tomorrow (thinking positive) and took ibuprofen and iced my knee as I fell asleep.

We had another yummy breakfast.  I picked up my lunch - Ham, cheese, and lettuce on thick slabs of whole wheat bread with honey Dijon mustard and apple butter, chips, apple, m&m trail mix and a raspberry fig bar.  


While looking in the gift and gear shop, I learned that they participate in the Darn Tough socks lifetime guarantee and exchange wornout socks for free. I had just noticed a hole in one of my socks (that I bought in 2014) the last time I did laundry.  I hurried up to my room to get them and exchanged them for a brand new pair.  Thank you Darn Tough!!


I called Rattle River Hostel where we will be tomorrow night and added a second night so we can take a zero there. We finally left about 8:30. 


Gene hiked the first easy mile or so away from the lodge with us. She decided she would not be able to do the next two days with us and booked another night at the lodge. When rhe trail started it’s ascent up The Wildcats, she turned back. 


The next two miles were mostly steep uphill steps and rock climbs. There were. Some sketchy climbs but the four of us managed them. We had several great views from ledges along the way where we could see all the way back down to the lodge.


After lunch we finally summited Wildcat D Peak where a ski gondola operates in the winter. There was a field of wildflowers there where I channeled my “inner Maria” and sang “The hills are alive with the sound of music.”  From there we hiked up and down Wildcat Peaks C, B and A and then descended a mile of steep stone steps and skirted a pond before finally arriving at Carter Notch Hut.


This hut is actually four separate buildings: a kitchen/dining area, a bathhouse, and two bunkhouses. The four of us are in our own room in one of the bunkhouses. There are only 16 guests, which makes this the smallest of all our hut stays.


We unpacked in our bunk room and cleaned up quickly. The croo did a talk about their green practices before dinner, then served us lentil soup, homemade rolls, salad, roast pork, green peas, wild rice, and vanilla cake with buttercream frosting. We ate with a mother-daughter duo from WV and a couple from MN.  As usual, we were clean and full and ready for bed by about 8:00.

Matthew 14-17
Somehow I counted the day’s mileage from Carter Notch Hut to Rattle River Shelter (13.3), when it should’ve been to Rattle River Hostel(15.4). We realized my mistake last night. This meant our already tough day of 13.3 miles would really be 15.4. Yikes!


We packed our headlamps close to the top of our packs in case we got caught out after dark, and we left immediately after breakfast.  SusanB had not felt well after supper last night and was still not feeling great in the morning. Our first uphill stretch was steep and she was having a hard time. 


span class=""Apple-converted-space""> We made it to the top of Carter Dome and then over to Mt Hight, where we had clear 360* views. We continued over to Middle Carter Mountain and North Carter Mountain, where we stopped for a lunch break. A young family joined us there for their break. They were “peak bagging” - climbing all the 4000+ high peaks in their home state of NH with their three kids (a 6 and 8 year old, plus a 2 year in old in a backpack).  We took group pictures for them and they did the same for us. 


Shortly after lunch, SusanB made a tough decision. She was still not feeling well and did not think she could finish the 15+ mile day before dark.  She took a side trail down to the highway and would find a ride to the night’s destination hostel and meet us there.  


We continued on and soon were climbing large steep rock slabs up to the top of Mt Moriah.  It was much easier on this dry day than it would’ve been in the rain!  Once we finally topped it, we had 6.7 downhill miles to get to US 2 where Rattle River Hostel would be within sight.  


span class=""Apple-converted-space""> Between the steps and slides, we were still negotiating thick black patches of watery mud.  


Gradually the trail became somewhat gentler; and even though we were tired,  we picked up speed. We finally made it to the hostel at 8:18, without having to hike in the dark using our headlamps.


SusanB had found a ride with some dayhikers and arrived around 4:00. Hostel rules were to leave poles and shoes outside in the covered area, come into the check-in room to pick out loaner clothes and towels, and go directly into the showers, putting dirty clothes in a mesh bag to be laundered. 


SusanB ordered us pizza and salads while we showered. Gene also brought Subway sandwiches and visited while we ate. We ate the hot pizza and saved the sandwiches for the next day’s lunch.  Of course, our bunkroom and the bathroom are on the second level of the hostel so we must go up and down the flight of stairs  repeatedly with our aching feet and knees.  Shortly after eating, we collapsed into bed by 10:00.

We decided to depart from our planned schedule and take a zero day at Rattle River Hostel. We had a DIY breakfast of blueberry pancakes between 6:30-8.
Gene and her husband Peter had spent the night at a local hotel, and they came back to our hostel at 8:30.  


We had all left our tents and stoves (which we didn’t need at the huts) and our resupply stuff in their car. It took us an hour or so to go through it all, pack what we needed in our backpacks for our next leg 7/24-28 and box up what we’ll need 7/29-31 to be picked up when we return here in a few days. Gene and Peter visited with us while we sorted through our stuff. We all sent some things with them when they left; we’ll get them back from them in September when we finish our trek. 




We caught the hostel’s Walmart shuttle at 11:30 and bought fresh food for tonight’s dinner along with a few other things. I had only brought one knee brace and I NEEDED a second one for my other knee.  I had also run out of sleep aid which I take nightly to help deal with all the snoring in the huts and hostels. I really wanted an apple fritter but they only sold them in boxes of six; a kind lady in the bakery repackaged one box of them into three boxes of two each just for me so I could enjoy my special treat! 


Back at the hostel, we enjoyed the Subway sandwiches Gene had bought us last night, along with juice and chips and snacks we had bought at Walmart. I had not had a meatball sub in a long time and it hit the spot.


I spent about an hour talking to the shuttle driver Bill who would be picking us up in the morning to take us to the trail, changing all our future hostel reservations back a day because of the unplanned rest day, adding a stay at Zeeland Falls Hut for our next section, and scheduling an AMC shuttle from our endpoint back to Rattle River Hostel.


We each took the opportunity to recharge our phones. Then we began sharing our pictures with each other and updating our trail journals and Facebook posts.


We had frozen lasagne and broccoli for supper and lots of fresh salad fixings!

We were picked up at Rattle River Hostel by Bill the shuttle driver at 9:00 and driven 53 miles in about 1:15 back to NH 112 at Kinsman Notch just past Mt Moosilauke   and we began hiking north. It was an uneventful day. We hiked about 5 miles gradually up Mt Wolf and then 3 miles down the other side. 




The weather was beautiful but there was still much mud and many puddles on the trail. We took our time and arrived at the Eliza Brook Shelter about 6:00. No one else was there so we set up in the shelter and began making our dinners. The shelter was built in 2010 and still looks new.


Three sobos joined us. The two young women from Utah (Zombie and Timber) are in the shelter with us and a guy from Philadelphia (Tarzan) is tenting. The girls met him on the trail and they’ve have been hiking together for several weeks. As we ate, it began cooling off.

I made it through the night without having to go to the bathroom but woke up about 5:15. I could hear raindrops just beginning to fall. I quickly  got up and went outside to take cate of business. No one else in the shelter was stirring so I crawled back into my sleeping bag for another hour.


By the time others began getting up, it was raining harder. We all ate breakfast under the shelter overhang and set out on the trail.  We began hiking uphill right away alongside a waterfall.   It didn’t take long for the rain to soak us. 


Thankfully the rocks were “grippy” and we were able to climb without mishap. It did take almost four hours for us to summit South Kinsman and North Kinsman. There were no views because of the rain. We came to the Kinsman Pond Shelter a third of the way into our descent and stopped there to eat lunch out of the wet. The had rain stopped but everything was wet.  The trail was a stream in many places and every tree or rock we passed got us wetter.


We stopped at Lonesome Lake Hut to use their bathroom and fill our water bottles. By then the sun was shining snd Janet actually went wading. SusanB and I continued our descent, knowing the Janet and SusanK would catch us quickly. 



There was a bridge out over one rain-swollen stream. We had to hunt upstream to find a safe place to ford it. We just walked through the knee high water with our shoes on. As we continued downhill, there were several other streams we just sloshed right through.
We finally made it to our pickup point about 6:30 and called for a shuttle. Ten minutes later we were picked up and we arrived at the Notch Hostel about 7:30. We had to leave our packs and poles in a shed and bring only necessities for the night inside.  We were shown to our bunks and picked out towels and loaner clothes. 


As soon as we showered, we dropped off our disgusting trail clothes to be laundered and raided the hiker kitchen for free food - chicken noodle soup, chicken salad sandwiches, and cheese crackers. As soon as laundry was done, we sorted our things and were in bed by  10:15.

The Notch shuttle back to the trailhead was scheduled to leave at 7:45. There were six of us on it.  We started hiking about 8:30, and we had to hike .7 mile just to get back on the trail.  It was about 3 miles uphill to the Liberty Spring Campsite where there was a great water source.  We barely averaged 1 mph, so I was ready for a lunch break when we got there.


Shortly after lunch we were on Franconia Ridge and were above treeline for two miles or so.  We summitted Little Haystack at 4800 feet,  then Mt Lincoln at 5089, and Mt Lafayette at 5254. The weather was gorgeous and allowed us great views.  These trails are popular for dayhikers and are almost manicured. 


Our descent was not. The rocks were rougher and there was much more mud and muck. We hiked around Garfield Pond. Mt Garfield was only 4453, but at the end of the day, it seemed pretty rough.  We did get nice views from its summit. 

The .3 mile descent to the Garfield Ridge Shelter about did me in. We got water from the stream just before the shelter area and got checked in about 7:30. We had just enough daylight to claim our spots in the shelter, fix our suppers, and stow our food bags in the bear boxes before dark. 
This shelter and campsite is one of the ones run by the AMC. We had to pay $10 each to stay there. We were each given a thru-hiker card which entitled us to half-price camping at any of their other sites and two free baked goods and a bowl of soup from the huts.


We were in the top level of the shelter with Popeye, a retired Navy section hiker from Maryland.  There were five younger hikers on the lower level.  I was in my sleeping bag by 9:00.

Somehow we all slept until 6:00. By the time we ate, packed, and used the privy, it was 8:00. We took the spur trail away from the shelter back to the AT. At the junction of the two trails, we crossed a stream and stopped to get water. Ken and Allie were just finishing with their water and started north just before us. They are from WV, so they started their hike in Roanoke VA, will hike to Katahdin, then return to Roanoke, and hike to GA.


As we started north on the AT, we followed that same stream which soon became a waterfall. We literally had to climb down the waterfall.  With the rocks wet, it was terrifying.  Ken took pictures of us as we came down behind them but they do not show how bad it really was.


When Popeye caught up to us, he couldn’t remember our names so he referred to us as Dash 1, 2 & 3.  We are not fast compared to most of the others out here hiking but it felt good to think someone considered us fast.  We leapfrogged with Ken and Allie and Popeye as we climbed up Galehead Mountain, and we all stopped at Galehead Hut.  


We went in to claim our free baked good and enjoyed the glazed pumpkin, pecan, and raisin cake.  We ended up getting free lentil soup too for an early lunch.  Popeye was staying there for the night.  We left him and Ken and Allie there after taking pictures with them and Janet offering to help when they flip down south. 


It was another steep rocky mile up to the summit of South Twin Mountain at an elevation of 4902. From there we had 6.2 miles to go and it was already 1:20.  We wanted to get to the hut by 6:00 dinner time.  


It was rocky as we came down from the summit, but generally less strenuous terrain. Although we were always being passed by many younger hikers, we did pass one other guy along the way. He commented about how fast we were.  Two fast comments in one day!!


It started sprinkling on us when we were about two miles away from the hut.  When it started getting worse, we had to stop to put on our rain gear. We arrived to the hut at 5:56, with 4 minutes to spare before dinner. 


We quickly checked in, claimed our bunks, cleaned up, and sat down to dinner.  We had kale chickpea soup, salad, bread, enchiladas, corn and lemon poppyseed cake. There was enough cake for me and Janet each to put a piece in a ziploc bag for the next day. 


As we ate, the hiker we had passed came in, almost an hour after us, and commented again about how fast we were. He asked our age and said he was 59.","Garfield Ridge Shelter

We had to hike 7.7 miles by 1:05 to get to 1846.3 where SusanB and I started hiking with Gene, Janet and SusanK.  The first half of the trail in this section is on old railroad bed so it was fairly easy terrain. The second half was a little rocky but still fairly easy. Along the way we actually overtook and passed some younger hikers!


We arrived at our destination in 3 1/2 hours and had time to sit down, relax and eat a snack while we waited.  The AMC shuttle bus picked us up and took us back to Gorham to stay at Rattle River Hostel again. 


Once there we showered, went through our resupply boxes, got our laundry done, and caught a shuttle to Dollar General for a few things. Back at the hostel, we repacked our food, did laundry, and ate supper.

Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641351,"We were supposed to leave Rattle River Hostel and hike 11.8 miles to Gentian Pond Shelter.  Rain was forecasted to begin in late afternoon and last all night and tomorrow. At our hiking pace, we figured we would not arrive in time for shelter spaces and would be setting up our tents in the rain in leftover spaces and packing up wet tents the next morning. 


At breakfast we heard a hiker telling someone he was getting shuttled to Gentian Pond Shelter and hiking sobo back to the hostel. This sounded like a great option for us so we checked into it. Unfortunately, the hostel was booked up already for the night. We called another hostel in town and they had bunks available. We quickly booked the shuttle with Rattle River and bunks for two nights at The Barn. 


We unloaded our backpacks of all that we would NOT need for a day hike (tent, sleeping bag, stove, extra clothes, extra food) and each stowed our gear in a large garbage bag. We arranged for a shuttle driver to pick up the bags and move them to The Barn during the day and we were shuttled by Rattle River to our drop off point. 


Because of the last minute arrangements, we did not leave the hostel until 8:30 and were dropped off to hike about 9:00.  What we didn’t realize was that we would have to hike 1.5 miles up a steep side trail to reach Gentian Pond Shelter on the AT before we even began the 11.8 miles sobo back into town.  We finally hit the AT about 10:00 with 11.8 mikes to hile before rain started.


The day was pleasant to begin with - nice temperature and moderate terrain. We crossed paths with several hikers we had met at the hostel all going nobo while we went sobo. We enjoyed lunch at a nice spot by a stream.  We had a great view from Wocket Ledge of mountains we’d already climbed . Somewhere along the way, I passed my 1900 miles hiked mark.


Around 4:00 it began to sprinkle and it gradually increased. We arrived at the road crossing in town about 6:00, called The Barn, and were picked up quickly.  We each showered, ate, and crawled into warm beds for the night, thankful we weren’t setting up wet tents in the woods.

Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641352,"We had booked two nights at The Barn, which is pretty much exactly as it sounds - a large rustic two-story barn attached to a much nicer bed and breakfast in an old Victorian home. (And the clientele do NOT mingle.) 


We three had beds downstairs in nooks in the open kitchen/living area and there are 15 or so more beds up in the open loft area, with one bathroom to share. Others are tenting in the backyard and constantly in and out, to use the kitchen or bathroom.


We slept in and leisurely ate breakfast scrounged from free food in the kitchen.  Janet did our load of laundry while I took a city bus to Walmart for a few supplies. For $2, I got a bus pass to use as much as I wanted all day.   I checked out at Walmart and went outside to wait at the bus stop an hour early and Paul from the hostel pulled into a parking space. Perfect timing! He had to get shampoo and conditioner for the hostel shower and said he could give me a ride back to the hostel.  I was thankful I did not have to wait for the bus.  


We did take the bus later to the local Chinese buffet where we paid $9.99 for all we could eat. Several other hikers from the hostel were there too. I’m pretty sure we all got our money’s worth!


Back at the hostel, we traded pictures we’ve taken and caught up on phone calls, Susan napped, and I arranged my bills to be paid in August. Janet and I played ping pong. We ordered pizza and salad from Mr Pizza for supper. Our backpacks had to be repacked.


I know I had my puffy jacket Thursday morning at Rattle River Hostel.  I know did not carry it when we slackpacked Thursday. The shuttle driver brought our bags of stuff from Rattle River to The Barn.  When I emptied the plastic bag to repack my backpack Friday, my puffy jacket was missing. I called Rattle River and they had not found it there. I prayed it would come to light before we had to leave Gorham in the morning.

Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641353,"In my Bible reading in Mark this morning, I read the account of the father who brought his demon possessed son to Jesus to be healed. Jesus told him if he believed, it was possible. The man said, “Lord, I believe.  Help thou my unbelief.” I prayed that I wanted to believe that my jacket would be found and asked for help with my unbelief.  


Bruce our shuttle driver picked us up just before 8:00.  He took us to Rattle River Hostel first so I could check for my puffy jacket before we left town. It was laying right on the counter as I came into the hostel.  I was so excited I ran out to the shuttle van waving it in the air, praising God! 


Bruce then drove us back to the Austin Brook Trailhead.  We had to hike that same 1.5 mile uphill trail to get back on the AT at Gentian Pond Shelter. The day before we snack packed south; this day we had full packs snd headed north. It was almost 9:30. 


We had to hike about two miles up Mt Success. The summit of Mt Success is the northernmost peak in the Mahoosuc range before it crosses into Maine. It was extremely windy as we crossed the summit ridge of glacially smoothed granite slabs mixed with alpine bogs.


After hiking about 5 miles on the AT, we crossed into Maine, the 14th and final state! We cheered at the sign and took pictures.  The rest of the afternoon was spent climbing Goose Eye West Peak, Goose Eye East Peak, and Goose Eye North Peak, and battling the gusting wind on the exposed summits.  After managing to stay out of the mud and puddles all day, all three of us ended up stepping in ankle high water and having wet shoes and socks.
The descent to Full Goose Shelter was steep and rocky and slow, and it was almost dark when we arrived. There were only 6 hikers spread out in the 12-person shelter and they begrudgingly made room for Susan and me. Janet tented.  I snacked while unpacking and went straight to bed in the shelter without fixing a hot meal. Susan stayed up later cooking and eating, and I didn’t even hear her come to bed.","The Barn Hostel

Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641976,"After a warm-up of hiking 1.5 miles, we entered Mahoosuc Notch. The  AWOL Guide says it is  “the most difficult or fun mile of the AT. Make your way through a jumbled pit of boulders.” It was fun but very tiring climbing up and over and through the huge boulders. It was often unclear where the trail actually was. I had to take off my pack five times in order to fit through some of the tight places. 


We ate a late lunch after spending three hours completing the mile long Mahoosuc Notch.  Then we had to ascend Mahoosuc Arm.  It was very steep in many places and involved technical rock climbs and scaling of steep granite slabs. It took almost three hours to summit. Janet pulled ahead of us; Susan and I took much longer to ascend.


A much less strenuous mile descent brought us to Speck Pond Shelter about 5:00.  It was right on beautiful Speck Pond, but it was too cool to swim. We always seem to be at the ponds at the wrong times.  


We secured spots in the shelter with six sobos. We fixed dinners, chatted with teens on a trip with a Maine summer camp, and got ready for bed.

Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641977,"We awoke to the sound of rain.  As we ate breakfast and packed up, the rain stopped ; but the trees and vegetation along the trail dripped on us all morning as we climbed Old Speck. It was just a little over a mile to the summit BUT the last .3 was steep granite slabs above tree line exposed to gusting chilly winds. We called Pine Ellis Lodging from the summit to give them our location and set an approximate pickup time from Graftin Notch/ME26. 


I was talking to a young woman today on the trail who was hiking sobo from Maine. She said she was from Central SC, close to where I live. I mentioned that I had friends there. She asked who. I told her Jorge and Debby Calzadilla. She actually worked in a chiropractor’s office where Debby had been a patient.  Small world!


The next 3 1/2 miles were generally downhill but lots of mud patches, slick boardwalks, and big stones slowed us down. We finally made it to the parking lot about 2:30 and our shuttle was there waiting for us. 


We checked in at Pine Ellis, unpacked, took showers, started laundry, and walked a short distance to the only market/diner in town for chefs salads and sweet potato fries for supper. There was a guy from Cumming GA and one from AL at the hostel with us.   


When we checked in, the owner said that a 73 year old woman was being brought in by a couple of hikers who were “helping her off the trail after an accident.”  It was Buttercup. She had fallen and hit her head. She has a lump and a black eye. Shortly after arriving, she was taken to the nearest ER and told she had a probable concussion. The doctor told her to take five days off and rest, drink, and eat. 


She had messaged me a week ago saying she’d fallen in the Whites and had to take a side trail off the AT to have shin X-rays. Nothing was broken then so she rested a couple of days and continued hiking, skipping some of the more strenuous sections and moving up the trail by shuttles, doing what she can.


Susan, Janet and I are up a steep flight of stairs in a gabled attic bedroom by ourselves. We arranged for a shuttle back to the trail for 9:00 am and fell asleep listening to the local church bells chime every hour on the hour.

Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641978,"Buttercup was planning to shuttle to Walmart for groceries today since she had to stay at the hostel and rest a few days.  She agreed to pick up some things for us too so we put together a list of produce and microwaveable meals. 


Our shuttle left the hostel about 9 and dropped us back at Grafton Notch about 9:30 to begin hiking with just our day packs. Almost immediately we were  hiking uphill Baldpate Mountain. Along the 4 mile climb, we stopped for a snack break and continued on.  


Our packs were light and the weather was beautiful, dry and breezy - perfect for hiking. We eventually summitted West Baldpate, East Baldpate, and Littke Baldpate. There was much steep granite slab to be hiked over closer to the top, some of which had to be done on my hands and knees. 


From the open summit we had 360 degree views from wide, open slab rock. We snacked on Maine blueberries and cranberries growing beside the trail as we hiked between the summits. We shared the trail with several dayhikers, some sobo thruhikers and a group of teens from a youth camp.


Our downhill trail was steep at first and gradually became more moderate as we descended.  Susan had been hiking much slower than usual since her fall and head bump last week. She decided today that she should go to the ER tomorrow and be checked out. 


We finally reached our road crossing about 6:45 and had to wait until 7:30 for our scheduled shuttle back to the hostel.  Buttercup had been able to get almost everything in our list.  We took turns showering and heating pot pies in the microwave and took our food upstairs to our bedroom to eat.  The common areas (kitchen and living room) of the hostel were closed because of COVID, so we had to eat outside on the porch or upstairs in our own room.

We were dropped up to hike southbound by 7:30 and immediately began the almost two mile climb up Mt Moody.  It involved a lot of stone steps and winding trail so it was not too steep or difficult. It was longer and steeper coming down the other side.


We arrived at Sawyer Notch and Sawyer Brook about 9:50. We refilled  our water bottles and noticed a picnic table at the nearby campsite. It was a very pleasant spot to have a snack break.


The climb up to Hall Mountain Shelter was steep with many series of stone steps also. I had to take several breaks during the 1.4 ascent. Once at the shelter, we had lunch. As we started to leave, I knocked my left shin against a large rock.  It instantly began to bleed and swell. I cleaned and bandaged it as the goose egg grew.
Thankfully we just had another short climb to the top of Wyman Mountain and then we began a gradual 4.5 mile descent to our pickup spot. Close to the end of our day, we stopped at a brook to soak our feet for, which is always refreshing. We arrived a few minutes ahead of schedule to find our shuttle driver there already. 


After driving back to the hostel we went out to dinner and the market with Susan and Buttercup. It was a fun time. Susan filled us in on her  ER visit and concussion diagnosis and her options for the rest of our hiking schedule.  For now, she’ll stay at Pine Ellis to rest and eat and drink like Buttercup is doing, while Janet and I hike alone the next two days.","East B Hill Road

Of course, it began uphill. There were several benches along the trail. Since this is so unusual, we stopped to sit on every one of them and take pictures.


David our shuttle driver had told us that it was raining in the coast and was forecasted for our area about 5:00.   We wanted to finish before it began.  


We completed the first  3.1 miles in 2:20 to the top  of Second Bemis Mountain. The blueberries were ripe and abundant along the trail across the summit and we snacked frequently on handfuls of them.  We arrived at Bemis Mountain Lean-to after 4.6 miles at 10:10 and had an early lunch.  


A light mist began as we began the long climb up Old Blue and it was refreshing. It never got any stronger than a mist. From the top of Old Blue we called the hostel to give them our approximate finish time of 5:00.  Then we began the downhill  section.  It was a slow, steep descent and very hard on my knees.  We could hear traffic for an hour as we descended and finally emerged from the woods at 5:05. David said he had heard our pomes clicking on the rocks for an hour as we made our way downhill through the rocks. 


SusanK booked a flight home for Sunday.  Janet and I will continue toward Katahdin without her.  SusanB still plans to join us for the Hundred Mike Wikderness snd Katahdin. We made arrangements for our final Pine Ellis shuttle for the morning; Janet and I would be dropped off to hike north and SusanK would shuttle with all our gear up to The Hiker Hut in Rangeley. The Hiker Hut is a rustic off-grid hostel just .2 off the trail. It has no electricity, no WiFi, no cell service, but they have tiny cabins for individuals or couples, a six person bunk room and a propane outdoor shower. 


We showered, did laundry and ate dinner at the hostel, then began packing so we would be ready to leave at 6:00am.

We left Pine Ellis at 6:00 and were hiking by 7:00. It was a beautiful day with much less strenuous terrain. The drive had left me queasy and I had to stop for a couple bathroom breaks before I finally took some pepto and Imodium.  Thankfully I began to feel some better but felt sluggish all day. 
There were no stunning mountaintop views, but we hiked along several huge beautiful ponds: Moxie Pond, Long Pond with a small sandy beach where Janet went wading, Sabbath Day Pond where we watched loons, Little Swift River Pond where we ate lunch and Janet took a canoe out for a bit, and finally South Pond.



Later in the afternoon we stopped at a small brook to soak our feet and rinse the day’s grime off our arms and legs with our bandanas and the refreshing cool mountain water. The final gradual descent downhill to ME 4 went by quickly. 


Even with all our stops, we were at the highway by 3:30. A couple in a van there offered us cold drinks and pointed us in the direction to The Hiker Hut. I drank an ice cold strawberry lemonade as we hiked along the highway to the hostel. 
There are several hikers at the hostel that we’ve been seeing in the trail the last few days: Trash, TieDye, Pilgrim.  Susan was there already and had our gear on our bunks, so we picked out loaner clothes and towels and took turns enjoying the outdoor shower by the stream, and then got shuttled into town for supper along with Pilgrim, a NC superior court judge.

We took a ZERO at The Hiker Hut in Rangeley, Maine. The Hiker Hut is advertised as 'Quiet and rustic off-grid oasis to rest and rejuvenate. Flower gardens, pet chipmunks and hummingbirds.'  They didn't mention the marijuana plants being grown in the little garden. 
Trash offered to let us use his car for the day if we left at 7:30 to drive him 20 minutes back to the trailhead where we started yesterday so he could slackpack that 13.2 miles back to the hostel.


We dropped him off and drove into town to recharge our phones at the laundramat, take care of bills, catch up on trailjournals, text and call family, and eat lunch at Sarges. I splurged on a can of shave gel and a cheap pack of razors and shaved my legs at the outdoor shower for the first time in weeks; it made me feel so much better!  I called the Hostel of Maine to confirm our night there in three days and add an extra night for a zero so we have plenty of time to resupply and do laundry before our final push to Shaw’s.


After all our errands we came back to The Hiker Hut to lounge and relax and hang out with others hikers. The town food and time to rest was very beneficial! We snacked around the picnic table for dinner, moved to talk on the bunk room porch during a brief rain shower, and stayed up until 9:00 talking around the fire pit.","

SusanK had a shuttle to the airport this morning. Janet and I rode in Trash’s car back to the trailhead .3 from the hostel and we started hiking just before 8:00.  He stayed at the parking lot for a few minutes as we left. As we took a break after 1.5 miles, he  caught up to us and passed us. We never saw him again. 


We stopped at Piazza Rock Lean-to after another .5 to see its somewhat famous double privy with a cribbage board between the seats.  We had come 3.1 miles in 2 hours. It was a pleasant slightly uphill walk by Ethel Pond and Eddy Pond.  


We had a 2 mile climb up Saddleback Mountain, above treeline, to 4120 feet elevation. 1.6 later we were atop The Horn at 3975 feet, 2 miles later we were atop Saddleback Junior at 3665 feet. The weather was clear and the views were 360 degrees.  Because it was Sunday and there were shorter, easier access side trails, there were many dayhikers heading up Saddleback.  


As we descended Saddleback Junior,  we crossed paths with Scott Jurek (one-time FKT AT supported record holder) and his entourage; he was trying to reclaim the record. He had started at Katahdin a few days ago and was planning to do 45 miles this day!


We were happy with doing just 10.7 miles to get to the Poplar Ridge Lean-to. There were two young nobo thruhikers already in the shelter when we arrived, Goose and Oatmeal.  A young man called Tobaggon who slept in the same bunkhouse as us last night was tenting nearby.  Tentpole and her dog Beans who had also been at The Hiker Hut with us were also tenting near the shelter.


We claimed our spots in the shelter, made dinner, ate, hung our food bags, and were all in our bags on our phones by 7:00. I tried to clean my retainer after supper and used water that was too hot and the retainer melted a bit. John is overnighting my spare to our next hostel.

No one wanted to get out of the shelter, but eventually nature called.  We began to stir, got dressed, ate breakfast, and packed up. Our two younger shelter mates left first. Janet and I left about 8:00. Tentpole and Beans and Tobaggan would leave later but pass us in a few miles. We would leapfrog with them throughout the day.


We went downhill to Orbetron Stream which was a challenge to rock hop over.  There was a smashed canoe midstream that had been there a long time; hopefully no one had been in it when it wrecked. The climb up Lone Mountain seemed long; it followed Sluice Brook so we had plenty of water sources. 


We arrived at Spaulding Mountain Lean-to around 2:00 where we planned to sleep.  It was too early to stop so we filled up with water and kept hiking.  We passed a bronze plaque marking the completion of the last section of the AT 8/14/1937 by the CCC.  


We finally stopped at a stealth site at mile marker 1993.1 and set up our tents.  We cleaned up and fixed dinner and ate.  I was in my tent by 6:30, working on my trail journal before bedtime.

We woke early but had to deal with fixing and eating breakfast on the ground and packing up our tents and NOT having a privy at our unofficial tent site. At least it was not raining!  We finally started hiking about 7:30. 

It was a rough rocky steep descent to the South Branch Carrabassett River.  It reminded me of Mahoosuc Notch with a general direction to follow, but options on which particular rocks we chose to go over. We rested and got water at the river in the gap.  Then we started up the equally rough rocky steep, but even longer, ascent on the other side of the river. 

We were behind a group of about 10-12 teens from a Maine summer camp.  They were very loud and we finally took a snack break just to let them get ahead of us. Going up wore me out but we eventually summitted South Crocker Mountain.  At the summit, we met the group again, and the leader asked if one of them who had an orange left in his lunch to share with us. Immediately, my opinion of them changed as I pealed and ate a fresh orange while answering their questions about thru-hiking the AT.

We had only to descend about .5 before going back up again to the peak of North Crocker Mountain. Neither summit had much of a view. The weather was great though.  

We had a more gentle grade for the most part of our 5 mile descent. Somewhere along this stretch I passed my 2000 mile mark! We were racing the clock to get to the road crossing of ME 27 by 4:30, which was our pickup time.  We made it with a few minutes to spare and were ready and waiting when the hostel van pulled up.

Within minutes, we were at the Hostel of Maine, taking showers, ordering supper, and having our laundry done. We were in a bunk room with four guys who said they lived near Raleigh. I told them my son had lived in Cary but now lived in Fuquay-Varina. One of them said he was born in FV and another lives there now less than 10 minutes from Matt.  Small world!

We weighed our options - doing a long tough day as a slackpack or breaking the miles into two days carrying full packs. With some misgivings, we decided to fo the slackpack. 
Trash was staying nearby at the Maine Roadhouse and offered to pick us up for lunch. He came about 12:00.  Most the the local restaurants had odd schedules and were closed this particular day, so we ended up driving all the way back to Rangeley to eat and go to the IGA for groceries. I had not had much for breakfast and the combination of driving on the windy road for 30 minutes, getting to the restaurant about 1:00, ordering and waiting for food was too much for me. I felt my blood sugar level crashing. Trash went to his car and got a couple Nutrigrain bars for me to eat while we waited for our food; that helped stabilize me.
We got back to the hostel about 4:00 and I took a half hour nap. In the afternoon I talked to SusanB to confirm her plans to meet us at Shaw’s, to my friend Carolyn in SC to catch up, to SusanK to hear about her flight home and about her concussion recovery, and to my Mom.


We cooked a frozen pizza to share for supper.  As I fixed the pizza I saw a guy throwing a Naked Mango bottle in the recycling bin. I checked the refrigerator, and sure enough, one of mine was gone.

Our shuttle left at 6:00am to be at the trailhead at 7:00. Our driver soon recognized a car in front of us as a local shuttle driver; he seemed to be heading the same place we were. The van began experiencing problems and we had to pull over. A diagnostic device said it was an alternator problem. 


Justin our driver called the other shuttle driver.  He only had one passenger and agreed to come back and help out.  His original passenger was Big Heart from GA whom we had met at the Pine Ellis Hostel.  Trash, Janet, and I loaded our gear and piled in the backseat. We saw a moose in a boggy field about 100 yards off the road as we drove. We arrived at the trailhead at Flagstaff Road about 7:30. 

The trail started moderately and we made good time up Little Bigelow Mountain. We had some great views! Trash pulled ahead of us when the uphill began in earnest. The van got a new battery and dropped off the other guys from our hostel 45 minutes after us. The alternator would be replaced in the afternoon.
Since we were going sobo, we crossed paths with several of our nobo friends: Tentpole and her dog Beans (she’s going to find out about boarding her dog when she gets to Shaw’s and might be doing the Hundred Mile Wilderness with us), TyeDye (who took a few days off when his 40 year old son joined him in Rangeley), and several others we know by face and clothes but not name.


The younger guy soon passed us. He would finish the 16.7 miles by 1:30. The other guys all leapfrogged with us up Little Bigelow, Avery Peak, West Bigelow, South Horn and North Horn, and then began to pull ahead of us.   


About 4:00 or so we were getting ready to pass a nice pond and we talked about jumping in for a quick swim. Then the skies started growing darker and before we knew it, it was raining, hard. No swim, but we cooled off quickly. About two miles from our destination, I felt my energy taking a nosedive again. I had to sit down and drink and eat something before continuing. 


The Raleigh guys all finished in 10-11 hours and said Trash had finished just ahead of them and left to drive home. Janet and I arrived at the trailhead finish at just under 12 hours, at 7:14pm. We averaged 1.4 mph for the day on some tough uphill terrain.


On the drive back to the hostel, we stopped at a small market and picked up deli sandwiches, salad, juice, and klondike bars for dinner. Back at the hostel, we ate and showered.

The young guy who finished our hike yesterday so quickly was planning to head nobo 21 miles. One young woman from the hostel was heading sobo for the 16.7 mile stretch we did yesterday. The four Raleigh guys were being dropped off farther north to hike sobo to the same shelter where were hiking nobo for the night.


We had planned only 6.3 miles for the day, to recuperate from yesterday.  We got started about 9:30, but stopped at Flagstaff Pond for a quick refreshing dip after only 1.2 miles. Within a mile we were hiking uphill and hot and sweaty again. 


We stopped to read a sheet of paper in the trail held down by a rock. “Bee hive ahead. Be careful!”  There was a tree leaning across the trail with a huge active beehive hanging from it. Since we had a warning, we gave it a wide berth. 


We had relatively gentle terrain with no big climbs and not much muck to navigate. We stopped by a nice dry stream bed about 1:15 for lunch and we arrived at West Carry Pond Lean-to about 2:30. 


We had a leisurely afternoon, setting up our spots in the shelter, getting my rope thrown for my food hang, checking out the privy, and then going for a swim in West Carry Pond. We joked about having “ a spa day”.  We swam, we trimmed our nails, we sunned on the warm rocks trying to dry our clothes, and I used the rough granite like a pumice stone on the callouses on the sides of my feet.  


Back at the shelter, we had plenty of time to gather kindling and firewood for later.  About 5:00 two young men arrived, set up their tents nearby, and went down to the pond to swim. We ate dinner and got a fire going. 


When I went to hang my food bag, I realized the two guys had taken my rope down and strung it by their tents for a clothesline. I took their stuff down and left it in a pile by their tents and rehung my rope for my food bag.


About 6:30 the Raleigh guys strolled in. We each told the others what their trail would be like the next day. They plan to get up early to meet the shuttle by 9:00 to go back to Hostel of Maine, clean up, get their stuff, and head to the airport to return home.","Flagstaff Road

Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641989,"The Raleigh guys were up by 5:00 and had left by 6. We were on the trail by 7:30. It began to rain soon after we started hiking. It rained until 9:00, so we were drenched. 
The trail was fairly easy all by day and we made good time. We especially enjoyed a half-mile walk around East Carry Pond with a beautiful sandy beach where we would’ve loved to stop to swim and picnic in nicer weather.
We took a snack break just before 10:00; we had come 5.52 miles. That was good time for us. We passed a group doing trail maintenance just before the next shelter; we thanked them for their work. We arrived at Pierce Pond Lean-to arrived at the shelter about 12:15. Ten miles in under five hours.


We quickly unpacked and set up our sleeping area in the shelter. A young nobo from Key West (Ice Bear) joined us soon; he had come 18 miles in one day. Others came and went through the afternoon. We enjoyed a swim in the pond in our clothes to launder them. After wringing them out and hanging them to dry I changed into sleep clothes about 3:00. 


About 4:00 the shelter and campsite started filling up. We re-met Silly Beans who had bunked with us at The Notch Hostel weeks ago.  Everyone gathered around the shelter for supper. There was lively discussion on thruhiking, slackpacking, speed records, and what each individual considered cheating in a hike.  


By 7:15, everyone was drifting off to their tents. There are five of us in the shelter and at least a dozen plus the trail crew tenting.  Janet and I watched a sunset over the pond and listened to the loons on the lake before crawling into our own sleeping bags at 7:30.","West Carry Pond Lean-to

Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641990,"People started stirring early in anticipation of crossing the Kennebec River at mile 2040.4. The canoe ferry only operated 9:00-2:00.  We let all the younger hikers leave before us, knowing they’d out-hike us to the river. We leisurely ate and packed up and still left the shelter by about 7:15.


We stopped along the 3.6 mile trail to the river many times to enjoy the many falls and cascades.  We were joined by PBS who we’ve seen a few times in passing on the trail. She is an ICU nurse from Roswell GA.


We finally saw our first sobo couple of the day about 9:25. They had been the first sobos to cross the river. We arrived at the Kennebec about 9:30. There was still a line of 14 nobos waiting to be ferried across, two at a time.  There were huge shady oaks and a nice breeze while we waited our turn. 


We were the last in line for an hour wait but were joined by Maple Leaf from Nashville and her golden doodle Yankee (trail name Marshmallow).  Because it was becoming very windy, the ferryman explained that she was going to have to sit in the middle of the canoe and hold the dog and he would need one of us to ride with her again to help paddle. I volunteered Janet:)
The next six miles were only slightly uphill and went by quickly, and we arrived at Pleasant Pond Lean-to about 2:30.  Shortly thereafter Tentpole and Beans showed up.  We all walked .2 to the pond which is on private property but allows hikers to swim.  


When we returned to the shelter, Silly Bands and three of her tramily from last night’s shelter were there. They had all gone into Caratunk for showers and food. Ice Bear also strolled in. They all chatted and then left except Ice Bear. He, Janet, and Tentpole all chose tent sites. I claimed a spot in the shelter. 


A 73 year old father (Festus) and his son (Skidmark) joined me in the shelter. They’ve been section hiking together for 23 years; today began their last section of the trail. Skidmark is an LA Times journalist (Ben Poston). They plan to finish around the same time we do. Two young women (Auggie and Fun Facts) came in a little later; Auggie joined us in the shelter and Fun Facts hammocked. 
One other single nobo guy came in later and set up his tent but did not join us.


We all ate dinner together and then worked to get a fire going for our evening entertainment. Festus had a neat lightweight curved blade saw that came in very handy.  The two women shared some hilarious stories about Duncannon and the Doyle. We fell asleep as the fire burned down.

Maple Leaf and Marshmallow were Slackpacking sobo and crossed paths with us. We stopped in the middle of Baker Stream on some nice warm flat rocks and soaked our feet while we ate lunch.


We had a two mile climb up Moxie Bald Mountain later in the afternoon.  The AT walks beneath a large overhanging slab of rock on the uphill, forming a fascinating cave system. Janet especially  enjoyed all the nooks and crannies there.  Our reward at the top of the mountain was cell service and loads of blueberries.  I confirmed with John what he needed to mail while grazing on fresh berries.

Two miles of downhill trail brought us to Moxie Bald Lean-to.  Tentpole and Beans were the only ones there. Others began showing up shortly after us and we all claimed tent spots and started setting up.  Someone alerted us to a moose grazing on vegetation in the shallows of the pond and we all grabbed phones to watch and take pictures for the next fifteen minutes or so.

We were at ME to be picked up by Shaw’s in Monson before 9:00.  A lady had just dropped off five hikers and she offered us fresh fruit while we waited for our shuttle.  

When the shuttle arrived, 13 hikers and backpacks were unloaded to begin hiking north into the Hundred Mile Wilderness.  It was like watching the little car full of clowns at the circus. 

At the hostel, we showered, started laundry, and hung our wet tents to dry. By 10:00 we were heading down the road in town to shop and eat at the General Store. 

I bought chocolate milk and OJ to have for my breakfasts at tge hostel.  We ordered huge deli sandwiches, broccoli salad, dill pickles, and chips for lunch. We ate on the patio under an umbrella with several other hikers.  We took half of our sandwiches, some juice and macaroni and cheese back to the hostel to have for supper.

I picked up a package at the post office from John with my summer sleeping bag in it. A birthday card from my mom arrived with a couple weeks of Jumbles.  In the afternoon hikers began arriving.   All 30 bunks inside were filled and the yard was filled with tents. 

One of the young guys in our room was hiking to raise money for a youth camp in Brevard.  He grew up in Anderson SC and his parents still live there, a few minutes away from me.  

We visited the ATC office in town and got information about entering Baxter State Park and summiting Katahdin. There are a multitude of rules and procedures and no guarantees that we will be granted entrance when we arrive.  

After talking to Poet and Hippie Chick back at Shaw’s, I called her parents, Ole Man and Navigator, who operate The AT Lodge in Millinocket. They happened to have a park entry permit for 8/20 and bunk spaces for four.  Uncharacteristically for me, I made a quick decision to shuttle up to Millinocket 8/19, summit 8/20, and hike sobo back to Monson.  Janet and SusanB agreed and Tentpole Sarah decided to come with us.  SusanB arrived at Shaw’s about 7:00. 

We went to bed with our plan to drive to Millinocket in the morning, but lots of chores needing to be done before we could leave.

Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641994,"Shaw’s served a huge breakfast to 48 hungry hikers at 7:00.  We each had 3 eggs, 3 bacon strips, hash browns, blueberry pancakes, OJ, and coffee or tea. With breakfast done, we went through our resupply boxes and sorted food to take with us to Millinocket and food to leave in a resupply bucket for Shaw’s to deliver to us at Johnson Pond Road in the Hundred Mile Wilderness.  We had to go grocery shopping for a few things; the nearest real grocery store was about 20 minutes away. 


It was almost noon before our resupply  buckets were correctly filled and we could leave Shaw’s. We drove almost two hours to Millinocket, took Tentpole’s dog Beans to be boarded (pets aren’t allowed in Baxter State Park), and finally checked in at the AT Lodge.  We were scheduled to leave at 6:00am with Papa John and a young male sobo to shuttle to Baxter State Park and hike Katahdin.


It was close to 3:00 when we went out for lunch. I had been dreaming on the trail of a steak dinner and the others offered to buy my birthday lunch. For some reason, the restaurant was out of beef; I settled for teriyaki chicken, SusanB had a lobster roll, and Janet and Tentpole had scallops.


We walked to a nearby store to get breakfast foods for the morning, took showers, set our alarms for 5:30am, and went to bed.","Shaw’s in Monson

Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642183,"Our shuttle left the hostel at 6:00. It took about an hour to get to Baxter State Park and drive on its dirt roads to our intended trailhead. We hiked up Chimney Pond Trail to the Saddle Trail. Papa John from the hostel took off up the trail ahead of us. We would not see him again for hours. There were beautiful viewpoints and stops at two gorgeous ponds along the way. 



The trail was literally all uphill, and it got rockier and steeper as we went. Eventually we had to put our poles in our packs and were rock scrambling. 
Janet and Tentpole pulled ahead, I was a good bit behind them, and SusanB brought up the rear.


I cried as I reached the summit and finally saw that famous sign. It was a surreal moment. There were probably 25-30 hikers at the summit. We all took turns getting our pictures and lunching. It was somewhat a subdued celebration. There were mixed feelings of being thrilled to be finished but sorry it was over. 


Ole Man had told us we should allow  about four hours to go up Chimney Pond and the Saddle and allow five hours to get down the Hunt Trail. He would meet us at 4:00 and wouldn’t wait long if we were not there.  It took us five hours to summit so we were a bit worried about meeting him on time. 


The Hunt Trail started off ambling gently downhill but soon began to drop sharply. I asked the others, “Are you sure this isn’t the Knife Edge?” Some of it was reminiscent of my least favorite spots in The Whites; some of it was terrifying.  There were huge boulders to maneuver around and over. There were two sketchy places to descend using rebar holds that took us some time to get down. I kept reminding myself that a five year old had done it and an 82 year old had done it. We caught with Papa John and passed him as we descended.


When we were finally back on a real walking trail, I relaxed and asked, “Now that I’m pretty sure we’re not going to die, what do we want to eat for supper  tonight?”  We decided to get pizza at the same Millinocket restaurant where we had eaten the previous night.


We started going more quickly as the trail got less strenuous.  Janet and I pulled ahead of the others. We met Ole Man at Katahdin Stream Campground at 4:15, got our park permits from the ranger station there, and waited for Papa John.  Ole Man decided to leave without him at 4:36.  


We went straight from the hostel to the restaurant without even showering.  Before our orders arrived, Papa John showed up freshly showered.  He had arrived at the trailhead three minutes after we had left.  When Ole Man had driven into the park, he had given three hikers a lift to Katahdin Stream Campground where their car was. They were still there when Papa John arrived, and they gave him a lift back to the hostel.


It was a Friday night and the restaurant was packed and loud.  It seemed like everyone was celebrating with us. Ole Man came and hung out with us there. After eating, we went back to the hostel, showered, and collapsed in our bunks for the night.

Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642184,"Our shuttle left at 6:00 again.  We were dropped off at Katahdin Stream Campground in Baxter State Park to hike sobo. While we were taking turns using the privy at the campground, Tentpole ran into her friend Biscuit. We enjoying chatting with Biscuit but had to start hiking. We had about 10 miles to hike still inside Baxter State Park.


We stopped to admire and take pictures at Little Niagara Falls and Big Niagara Falls. We hiked along the river with much easier terrain than we had yesterday.  There were two river crossings that normally would’ve been knee-deep fords that were easy dry rock hops for us. The terrain was so easy that I was able to leave off my knee braces for first time in weeks!


Along the way, we crossed paths with a Baxter State Park Ranger. He checked our permits and we had an interesting chat with him.  We finally left the park and came to Abol Bridge campground store. We had to wait there for Ole Man from the AT Lodge to bring us our gear and Tentpole’s dog.  


While we waited, I had a moose tracks waffle cone, some Vermont cheese, a bottle of apple juice, and a bag of peanut M&Ms from the store - a true hiker snack. Tentpole had arrived before us and had booked a campsite, already taken a shower, and bought a carton of her favorite Twisted Tea.  


While at the store, a family recognized us from yesterday on the Chimney Pond trail.  Their teens had been hiking ahead of the parents and we were between the two groups. We had stopped at a view and the parents had asked us if their kids had been polite when they had passed us.  They were happy when we told them they had been very polite.  


We reached the Hurd Brook Lean-to early enough to set up tents leisurely.  There was another couple our age at the site from Louisiana: Sugar Gal and Swamp Irish. They had alot of questions for us about Baxter.","Katahdin Stream Campground

There was only about 800 feet of elevation change in the first 2.7 miles to get to the top of Rainbow Ledges.  We snacked on by blueberries and huckleberries while we walked across the summit.  We had cell service there and sent a few texts before moving on.  We had light sprinkles all morning and high humidity.  

We crossed paths with 27 nobos, many of whom we had hiked with earlier. They were all on a mission to get to Baxter, get one of the 12 shelter spots at The Birches, and summit Katahdin the next day. I was so thankful we were not in that frenzy!

We met Buttercup on the trail. Her eye has healed and she seemed perky.  She was planning to hike 11 miles to meet her husband at Abol Bridge Campground; they had reservations for several days at Daicy Cabins in the park. She planned to go both up and down the more moderate Chimney Pond and Saddle Trails and avoid the more strenuous Hunt Trail. I thought that was a smart plan.

She told us she had stayed at Rainbow Spring Campsite the night before and that it had a privy, a cold piped spring, and a picnic table (one of the few in Maine). We stopped there to have lunch about 12:30 and made use of all those amenities.

Our trail was filled with rocks and roots but not any serious elevation so we made good time. We hiked along Rainbow Lake for quite a while. It was beautiful but there was a lot of vegetation in it around the shore and never a good access spot for swimming.  

We covered 11.5 miles to Rainbow Stream Lean-to by about 3:30, set up our tents, cleaned up in the stream running in front of the shelter, and were fixing our dinners by 4:30.

Between 5:00 - 6:00 we were joined by Goose and Oatmeal (who we met the day we saw Scott Jurek), then Silly Bands (who we first met at The Notch Hostel), then three others of their tramily (who we first met at Pearce Pond.)

We started our morning with a 2.7 gradual climb up Nesuntabunt Mountain. We had cell service and patchy views from the top.  There was a road crossing a mile before the peak and we met two families with six kids just out for a day hike to the top

With rain in the forecast, SusanB and I joined Auggie and Fun Facts in the shelter, with Dora the Explorer, a sobo. Tentpole always tents with her dog Veans.  Janet tented also. It was all girls at the site which is very unusual. They are all planning to get up by 5:30 to do 20+ miles tomorrow.  We have to do 15.9 ourselves to get to the shelter where we want to be.

As we set up and ate, the rain began. It lessened enough for us to get our food bags hung and fill our water bottles and then got heavier again.

We stopped by Potaywadjo Shelter to get water from the ice cold artesian spring. It was wonderful. Hikers were calling it “the fountain of youth”.

Our next stop was Antlers campsite.  It was huge and could accommodate a large number of tents. We ate our lunch there next to Jo-Mary Lake.  We heard there was trail magic at Jo-Mary Road m, just four miles away, and hoped to arrive there in time.  Since the terrain was still fairly level or just slightly uphill, we made good time.  Along the way we stopped to chat with Skidmark and Festus as they headed north to finish their 23 year long AT section hike. 

We arrived at the road to find a cooler full of ice, sodas, beer, and hotdogs. There was a note from Biscuit, Tentpole’s friend, with the trail magic goodies.  Big Heart, who we first met at Pine Ellis Hostel, and another hiker were there waiting for their food drop from Shaw’s.  We ate the last two dill pickles in a jar, a banana, and a whole can of Dole pineapple slices. Janet and I stuck hotdogs on sticks and grilled them over a fuel canister flame. Janet took a beer to carry to the campsite for dinner.

It was just a little more than four miles to Cooper Brook Falls Lean-to.  We passed the time singing hits from the 70’s that we remembered from our high school years, loudly. 

As soon as we arrived at the shelter, I dropped my pack and poles and started  looking at tent sites. Another older hiker walked by and picked up my poles. When I said I thought he picked up my pokes, he argued with me. When he walked over to his tent and realized his poles were already there, he brought mine back and said we had the same exact poles. He did not apologize at all.  Some people refuse to admit when they make a mistake.,

We chose tent sites away from the grumpy guy, washed off in the brook,  fixed our dinners, and ate.  Janet tried wedging her beer between rocks in the brook to chill it and punctured the can and got sprayed; she quickly popped the top to salvage what she could. 

I spilled my Mountain House dehydrated meal on the large rocks where we were sitting and had to scoop the powder and pieces of meat, carrots and potatoes back into the bag to rehydrate. I ended up with some extra spruce debris mixed in the meal. It was the last day of food we had so there was no choice but to salvage as much as I could.

It was too late to use the swimming hole and have our clothes dry, so we didn’t get in the water. We tented close enough to enjoy the sound of Cooper Brook Falls, a series of cascades just upstream from the shelter.","Nahmakanta Stream Lean-to

On the way we stopped to chat with a nobo hiker I had met back in Vermont 6 or 7 weeks ago. His wife was traveling up the trail slackpacking him as much as possible. It was his second AT thruhike. He  recommended we read Walking with Buddy, the story of his first thruhike.

We reached the road crossing early about 9:00.  Biscuit was there with trail magic again.  I had another hot dog, a dill pickle,  lemonade, a Rice Krispie treat, and some peanut M&Ms. When our food drop arrived, we spent an hour going through our stuff, donating to Biscuit what we didn’t need or want. Just as we were leaving, Biscuit gave us a fresh avocado.

SusanB banged her toe the other day and decided to get off trail to take care of it. Biscuit agreed to shuttle her to Millinocket to get her truck.  She’ll stay at Shaw’s a night or two abd rejoin us in a couple days if she can. Janet and I went through our entire packs and gave SusanB any extras we could get rid of to lessen our weight and make room for all our new food.

We had a 1.5 mile climb up Little Boardman Mountain that had us sweating and soaking our shirts.  The next three miles were downhill to the East Branch Lean-to.  We stopped there for a snack and water.  We had a mile or so level terrain before the trail got steeper and more strenuous and soon our shirts were soaked again. Halfway up White Cap Mountain we finally arrived at Logan Brook Lean-to.


We joined the others at the shelter for our supper.  Janet and I split the avocado and added it to our dinners for a nice treat.  


After one of the guys climbed the steep rock steps up to the privy, he said, “You don’t want to start that climb if the turtle is already sticking his head out of his shell.” We all just shook or heads at that one. I’m going to have a hard time getting that saying out of my head. 

At dusk four nobos came charging in one after another, got water, and moved down the trail. All of us already at the shelter were relaxed and having a good time, but these four were on a mission to do big miles and finish.

He was celebrating his 500 mountain climbed by bringing cookies in ziploc bags to pass out to all the hikers he met. That was a nice treat for us.

We knew we had a tough day with four peaks to climb so we planned only 7.2 miles for the day.  Even Warren Doyle at his AT Institute warned us that this was a tough section.  He was right.

After White Cap Mountain, we summitted Hay Mountain, West Peak, and Gulf Hagas Mountain, taking rests and snack breaks at each peak.  Along the way we crossed paths with PBS. We last hiked with her the morning we crossed the Kennebec River. She’s probably the last of our nobo friends we’ll see.  

Most have already passed us.  Many have already summitted Katahdin. I got texts and pictures from Silly Bands and her tramily and from Buttercup today with their Katahdin summit pictures.

We reached the Carl Newhall Lean-to around 2:00.  We got water, chose tentsites, unpacked, and set up our tents. We took our dirty clothes down to the brook and washed them and ourselves.  We put on our sleep shirts and rain skirts for the rest of the afternoon and hung our clothes on a line to dry.

One nobo about our age from College Station PA came to our area to tent for the night.  We ate early about 4:00.  Another nobo joined us about 5:00.

We were packed up and on the trail by about 7:30. Our morning trended gradually downhill and the miles went by quickly. It was typical rocks, roots, and mud, separated by some nice spruce needle cushiony trail sections. We covered 5.44 miles to West Branch Pleasant River by 10:00.  There was no bridge and we had to take off our shoes and socks and wade across the river.  A quick .6 mile later, we were at Katahdin Ironworks Road and there was trail magic. Three days of trail magic in a row!! 

A 2010 thru-hiker calling himself Kentucky had a cooler of sodas, water, and Gatorades. He also had mini bags of chips, snack cakes, and assortment of other goodies. I ate a bag of sour cream and onion chips and chugged a  Gatorade. We had heard from nobos that the water at the night’s shelter tasted like sulphur, so I took an extra bottle of water to go also.  

When we left the road, we immediately began a steep ascent up Chairback Mountain. After a half mile or so the incline became more manageable. We passed a group of 10-12 older ladies out for a day hike and lunch. We climbed 2.5 before stopping for a lunch break on some nicely placed rocks. 

Closer to the top there was a short rock scramble reminiscent of the Whites.  The views from the top were breathtaking!  Chairback Gap Lean-to was just .5 downhill from the summit, and we arrived about 2:00.  SusanB arrived about 3:00 with stories about her adventures with Biscuit on her “days off”.  

We set up our tents and aired out our gear in the afternoon. It was breezy and the temperature was dropping. The heat wave has finally broken.  It was nice to have a warm dinner and crawl into my tent. It was only 6:00 and still early, but being in the tent was warmer. We each got in our own tents; SusanB kept us entertained reading aloud from The Old Lady on the Trail.  One passage described how she reached the exact shelter where we were spending the night. 

I only have 26.2 miles to go to finish the AT.  If I were a marathoner I could run it in a few hours, but I’m a 63 year old with a 30 pound backpack so I’ll take two days to hike it.

Our first climb was Columbus Mountain. Our second was Chairback Third Mountain.  Our next climb was to The Ledges which gave us a great view of Chairback Fourth Mountain that we would climb next.

We walked across Fourth Mountain Bog, an alpine bog below the peak of Fourth Chairback Mountain. The trail traversed the bog on a nearly 100 yard bog bridge. There we saw purple pitcher plants and the round leaf sundew, both carnivorous plants.

Our last climb was up Barren Mountain, the western end of the Barren-Chairback Range, which is home to a partially dismantled fire lookout tower. We had a steep rocky descent to the Barren Ledges where we had a gorgeous clear view of Lake Onawa.

We had originally planned to stop at Long Pond Stream Lean-to after 10.9 miles, but kept hiking downhill and found a great campsite along Long Pond Stream with plenty of flat space for all three of our tents, an existing fire ring, and easy access to the stream for water.  It was just about perfect for my last night on the trail. When I was hanging my food bag, there was even a huge nail in the tree I chose, which made it super easy to tie off my rope.

We all got our tents up, fixed and ate our dinners, heated water to clean up, and got a fire going. We sat around the fire talking until dusk and then SusanB and I climbed into our tents. Janet stayed up to sit by the fire a little longer. 

It was hard for me to believe that my section hiking of the AT that started in 2014 would end the next afternoon, in just 14.4 more miles.","Chairback Gap Lean-to

Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642192,"It was bittersweet packing up in the morning to leave. I had been pushing my physical limits for 11 weeks on the trail and I was tired and ready to be done. At the same time, I didn’t want it to end.
The elevation for our last day looked relatively mild, hovering between 500-1200 all day. In reality, in was constant little ups and downs all day.  There were no big summits or views, just continual ups and downs. There were no named mountains and the elavation line in guthook looked like a serrated saw blade, so we called the whole day The Sawtooth Range.
The AT gave us little bits of it all - little rocks, big rocks, rock slabs, rock climbs, rock ledges, mud, roots, muck, bog bridges, a knee deep stream crossing, a railroad track crossing, a picnic by a waterfall, a few easy level stretches, and lots of hikers along the way. The weather was beautiful. 
About a mile before we finished the Hundred Mile Wilderness, we crossed paths with 8 year old Supergirl and her Supermom. I’d been following their hike on their YouTube channel sporadically through the summer and was thrilled to meet them.  They had just left Monson on their final stretch and would summit Katahdin about a week later.   
As we neared our final destination of ME 15 about 4:00, Janet and SusanB hung back and I reached the parking lot alone. It was surreal; I was done section hiking the entire AT!  I choked up and began to weep. It started to sprinkle, so we took a few pictures at my last white blaze and called Shaw’s for a ride. Poet arrived quickly to whisk us away to the hostel. 
We chose loaner clothes one last time, unpacked in the hostel bunk room, got lukewarm showers, started our load of laundry, and walked into town to celebrate. It was Sunday and the only restaurant in town and the General Store deli both had closed at 7:00.  Fittingly, we ordered takeout pizzas from the gas station for our last trail meal and ate them back at the hostel.","Tent site by Long Pond Stream

Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642193,"In the morning as we were packing to leave Shaw’s and head south, we saw familiar faces. We had last seen Ken and Allie at a hut in the Whites July 27. Today they were taking a zero at Shaw’s before heading into the HMW, then would flip flop to do the southern half of the trail. It was fun to meet them again after a month.
SusanB drove us to CT where I was reunited with my truck. After a long-anticipated steak dinner at Longhorn, we said our goodbyes. SusanB headed home to PA, and Janet and I headed south. We stopped in NJ for the night and finished our trip home the next day.
I took it easy for several days at home -  unpacking, cleaning and storing gear, catching up on home stuff, eating, and napping. John had invited friends to celebrate with us on Saturday. 
Within days of my arrival home, that bottle of untreated water I’d had on 8/23 began to take effect. The doctor and stool sample confirmed that I had giardia. After a week on antibiotics, I was back to normal again.  
Adjusting to the “real world” is rough after 11 weeks on the trail. My ankles and knees are recovering but my head wants yo be back in the trail.  I can only imagine what thruhikers go through.",,View Entry,"Aug 30, Mon",0
Tracy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645299,"I’ve been home almost two months now.  I spent the first week mostly sleeping and eating.  I spent the second week dealing with Giardia.  Getting my head back into the “real world” has taken much longer than I expected.  I have only been back on trails a few times but I have begun jogging again.  I took a short trip to Georgia for a leisurely overnight from Amicalola Falls up the Approach Trail to Springer Mountain. When I was first on Springer in July of 2014, it was raining and we barely took time for a picture before beginning our AT adventure. This time, the day was gorgeous and I took more time for reflection.
I went back through my journals and tried to do some math. The numbers may not be exact, but they’re close.  The farther I got from home and the older I got, the more I spent on slackpacking and hostels/hotels.

The only gear I did not replace over the course of my AT hike was one bandana and one pair of Darn Tough socks. Everything else either wore out or got upgraded. I didn’t keep records of how much I spent on gear, food, overnight stays, and travel. It’s probably best I don’t know.  Regardless, it was worth it!",,View Entry,"Oct 20, Wed",0
