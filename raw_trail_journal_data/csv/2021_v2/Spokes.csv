Spokes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632151,"Temps were in the upper 20s this morning as I left my warm vehicle and started up the blue blaze trail at Snickers Gap, headed for Bears Den. Passed a number of day hikers and then met a man carrying a backpack and asked him if he was training for a thru hike.  He said he was planning on doing a flip flop, starting in April headed for Katahdin. We talked for a bit until the cold motivated us both to go our own way. Today’s hike was great!  Made it to the Sam Moore shelter and wanted to go longer but had an appointment later in the afternoon so turned around and headed back to the car.  Got back to the car after about 8 miles and really felt great. No foot or leg pain. I think the Merrill MOAB wide with a size up might be the ticket for me!

Thought about hiking today but the weather and the fact that my beloved Buffalo Bills are playing this afternoon kept me home bound.  I know, “no rain, no Maine” but I guess I can still be finicky this far out. I’ll probably hike 2 or three times a week until March and then hit it hard. 
Today’s picture is looking over the northern cliff near Bears Den. Been here many times either camping with my sons during their scouting days or on day hikes. Really pretty.
I mentioned my bike trip yesterday and thought I would include the blog I maintained during the trip.  www.crazyguyonabike.com/doc/ak...  I apologize in advance for my less than perfect writing but I think the pictures taken during the trip speak for themselves.
Also, a big shout out to those of you that have taken the time to document your hikes on this site!  I can’t tell you how many I’ve read and enjoyed as they are full of great experiences and a wealth of knowledge for me. Thank you!

I got hired by Habitat for Humanity the other day as a Construction Assistant.  I was a regular volunteer and was pleasantly surprised when they offered me the job. I explained about my hiking plans and they said, no problem. The pay kinda blows but the karma and ability to help people in need is priceless.  Anyways, to today’s hike. 
From Snickers Gap I hiked north, headed for the views at Raven Rocks (I think). The day was clear and sunny and I was eager to get to the top. Passed other day hikers both on the way up and down. Total distance was about 6miles. I cut it short because again, my beloved Bills were playing at 1300hrs. 
I heard a saying “Start bold, start cold”, and went with only a sweatshirt and base layer. Yeah, it was a cold start (20s) but after a mile or so I really didn’t feel it at all. Great therapy hike today given all that’s going on. 
Tomorrow I’ll head south and break into the double digits on my mileage. Pretty much stuck with weekend training hikes until I take a hiatus from my new job on April 1st.

Started out in the high 20s and eventually made it in the upper30s by the time I finished. It was a gorgeous winter day on the trail and I only saw perhaps a handful of hikers out today. Spooked a couple of deer while passing near the Sam Moore shelter then it was up and over the next roller. Stopped at a stream on the other side and took off my pack and had some snacks and water. Didn’t eat much for breakfast and could feel the affects. Decided to turn back and call it a day after 4.5 miles. In retrospect, I really wished I would have gone up and over the coaster. Next time. Been thinking about water filters and decided to go with the Be Free system and 3 liter bag.I have 3 water filters, the Sawyer Squeeze, Be Free, and a Katadyn pump filter. I like the be free because the flow is great and cleaning is really easy. It was close between the sawyer and be free but I liked not having to carry and keep track of the back flow plunger on the sawyer. Any advice on filters is greatly appreciated!Until next time...",,View Entry,"Jan 12, Tue",0

Did a little over 8 miles walking from my house, through Morven Park, and up the Ridge top trail. Temps stayed in the 30s and the sun peaked out from time to time. I really like the Ridge Top Trail. My youngest son earned his Eagle cleaning up and marking a pretty dilapidated, little used trail.  I noticed as I walked, a well used and well marked trail. Nice job son!
Been thinking about rain pants. Yeah, my life is that exciting!  I think I’m going with a rain skirt vs rain pants.  I’m a big sweater and I can’t imagine hiking in hot, constrictive pants. When not raining, I can use the skirt as a welcome mat outside my tent, saving me from bringing dirt and debris into the tent. I love multi use gear!  Another item with multiple uses that I’ve decided to bring is a sit pad.  I can obviously use it as a sit pad but as a stomach sleeper, I can use it to cushion my elbows.  If you have any multiple use items, please give me a heads up.

Spokes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632322,"Since I had the day off today figured I would hit the trail and head northbound from Snickers Gap.  Temps were in the 30s with overcast skies so I went with hiking pants, base layer top, sweatshirt , and gloves. Worked great and ended up taking the gloves off on the return trip.
The hike was great!  Passed Raven Rock and had pretty good views, weather permitting. It was up and down until I got to the northern end of the roller coaster and then it became a nice ridge hike for a couple of miles. Wanted to get in double digits today and turned around when I got a bit past 5 miles.  Stopped at Raven Rock on the return and had water plus the last bit of my Christmas candy. Man, I was flying back.  Passed a bunch of hikers making their way to RR; big ones, small ones, 4 legged ones, etc.  Got back to the car with a little over 10 miles in the books. Nice!  Most importantly, my feet and legs felt fine.
I’m thinking of driving to the Blackburn Trail Center on my next hike and head north. While hiking the coaster is great exercise, I need to mix up the scenery a bit.  Also, going to REI on Wednesday to look at clothing for the hike. Merino wool worked great for my Alaska trip but I don’t think I can ask the same garments to make a thru hike.

Also, went to REI this past week and picked up a pair or Hoka Speedgoat 4s since my Merrill MOABs were showing significant wear despite only having around 200 miles of use. The stitching around the toe boxes was coming undone due to perhaps all the rocks on the trail. Anyways, as a bonus, the Hokas are much lighter than than the MOABs.  Back to the hike.
Drove up to the Blackburn Trail center which is just north of the roller coaster and had a nice warm up hike on the blue blaze trail to get to the AT.  Once on the trail, I was greeted with pretty stiff chilly winds from the north when I was hiking the ridge lines or on the northern exposures.  Otherwise, it was down right pleasant hiking on the southern sides or coming into most of the gaps.  
Stopped at the David Lesser Memorial Shelter after about 4 miles for a snack and was surprised at the number of trees down, particularly in the camping area. I was here in the fall and remembered enjoying my nice shaded campsite.  Perhaps a reminder to choose my campsites wisely in inclement, windy weather. Sure hope no one was hurt.
My goal today was to hike 10 miles with my base weight so I continued north for another mile or so and turned around.  Saw more deer today than people and think this cold weather kept all but the hardiest hikers home.  Hiked back to the car with a little over 10 miles and 3.5 hours in the books.  Never got to cold for me even when I stopped at the shelter so I’m pretty pleased with my cold weather hiking gear. Also, no issues with the new trail runners.
Snows in the forecast for the early part of this week and I’ve got Tuesday off so I’m thinking of driving to Harpers Ferry and hiking south.  There is a pretty good climb headed southbound out of HF that I’m eager to try!

My hat is off to those folks!  While I don’t have a problem dealing with a cold patch here and there, I can’t imagine facing a month of cold weather!Had to get a COVID test this morning. A future homeowner came out to put in some sweat equity working on her future house. She was excited and jumped in knocking out drywall, hauling trash, etc.  Well, the next morning I get a call from my construction manager informing me that she tested positive and to go ahead and get tested. What?!  She must have been tested a day or two prior based upon a suspicion that she had been exposed. If she believes she had been exposed, why in the world would you expose others!  I don’t get it.

This way I get a chance to see a little of Atlanta as I blow thru.Met my first thru hiker on my training hike yesterday. I was up on Raven Rock, admiring the view, when a gentleman around my age passed by.  He had a pretty big back so I thought perhaps he could be at least a secction hiker.  A few minutes after he passed I took off in the same direction, headed back to the car.  Came down the hill, crossed the creek and looked up the next hill and there he was sitting on a log halfway up.  I approached and asked where he was headed.  He said, Georgia, god this trail is f’in hard. Hardest thing I’ve ever done. He said he started yesterday in Harpers Ferry on a flip flop. I told him he had a pretty big pack and said he might want to off load some items at the hiker box at Bears Den.  He grunted. I asked him how many days of food he had on him and he said 10 days worth. Asked him if he had a trail name yet and he said no. I told him Sherpa might be fitting.

I had the privilege and honor of working alongside both officers during my 28 year career with the Department.  Whenever I look at this pin during my hike I will be reminded of them, their sacrifice, and their commitment to duty.

Wasn’t to worried about it since the weatherman predicted clear but seasonably cool weather in my future. Survivor Dave’s Shuttle service arrived at 0700hrs and whisked myself and a young couple up to Springer.  Met Zack and Erin from Maine who are hiking north, towards their home. I would end up leap frogging with the couple most of the day and spend the night camped out together at Justus Creek.
Dave dropped us off at Big Stamp Gap and we hiked the .9 miles to Springer then turned around and started our official NOBO (north bound) hike. As we hiked the weather kept getting better and better. When we started the temp was 49 degrees and overcast.  The hike took us down Springer and up Hawk Mountain.  Rested and had lunch at the top and had a chance to talk with several hikers.  Everyone was excited to be on the trail and headed north. Was able to get a bar of service and sent a missive to loved ones back home. 
Finished lunch and headed down Hawk Mountain and up Sassafras Mountain.  I gotta say that mountain kicked my butt!  About a mile and half of steep climbing. Took a short water break then moved down to Coopers Gap. I passed a couple of  hikers coming up out of the gap and they told me there was trail magic at the gap. Trail magic!  Yes, please!  Trail magic comes in many forms and it basically consists of a stranger giving of themselves to help you make your way. Well, Running Baer, a two time thru hiker, was handing out hot dogs, cold sodas, and just about anything a hungry hiker would need. I had a dog and a cold coke then gave him my sincerest thanks and moved on up the trail. 
The remainder of the 2 or 3 miles to Justus Creek was nice and easy, hiking through a rhododendron tunnel. Looking forward to future blooms!  Anyways made it to the creek and nabbed a beautiful, level camping spot overlooking the creek. I look forward to being lulled asleep by the creek!
 Beautiful hike today and managed to cover over 15 miles but only 14.2 counts. I’m ok with that!  What a great first day!

Spokes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634952,"Woke up at 0600hrs and made myself last nights dinner for breakfast this morning. The trail magic was nice but it didn’t do anything to lessen the weight of my food bag. As I ate breakfast in bed with a cup of coffee, I contemplated today’s plan. I had two choices. I could go 17 miles up and over Blood Mountain to the outfitter at Mountain Crossings or hike 10 miles to Lance Creek campsite. I chose the latter and packed up my gear, content with my plan.  The problem is there is a lot of bear activity in those 7 miles and you can only camp if u have a bear proof container. I don’t so I have to stop short. I’m ok with that, its a marathon, not a race. 
Another gorgeous day for hiking. The sun was out and the views were awesome. Passed Gooch Gap and was excited when I saw trash cans and real privies. Yes!  I can go to the bathroom AND get rid of my garbage at the same time. Score!  Mission accomplished I’m proud to say!  Climbed over Ramrock Mountain and Big Cedar Mountain. Some pretty good climbers but the views at the top were amazing!
Stopped at a spring and had a water and snack break when Zack and Erin caught up to me. We were joined by another Mainer by the name of Logan, nice young man. Logan and I ended up hiking together the remaining 4 miles into Lance Creek around 1230hrs. Set up camp and am in the horizontal position just stretching and relaxing. 
It’s supposed to rain tomorrow morning then clear up for the afternoon. My plan is to get up, eat on the trail, and cover the 7 miles over Blood Mountain to Mountain Crossing Outfitters. I may pick up a couple of meals to give me rations for three days then continue the hike north.
Finally, I expected a lot more hikers on the trail. Not that I’m complaining!  During my 10 mile hike today I saw perhaps 8-10 hikers. I know that may change as evening approaches and hikers start to settle down for the night. I’m developing a strategy. Start early, get the miles in then set up camp around 1500hrs. I think the key is just getting up early, especially when it starts getting hotter.

Spokes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635017,"Woke up this morning at 0500hrs and heard the light sprinkle striking my tent. Rain was forecasted this morning with it letting up as the day went on. Put my head back down a got a few more winks when I heard Logan taking his tent down. Time to move!  Went over to the bear cables to retrieve my food bag when I learned one of many lessons I’m sure to receive; One must be able to distinguish there food bags from the many hanging from a bear cable. My name is on the side but a bright sticker should do the trick. Had to go back to my tent, get my headlamp, go back to the bear cable, lower it, and identify my bag in the light. Argh, lesson learned!
The rain stopped as I packed up my gear and moved onto the trail. Today’s plan was to hike over Blood Mountain and get into Neels Gap where there is an outfitter we can get another 3 day supply of food. The hike going wasn’t the lung buster I expected but the climb down was a knee crushing boulder hop for a couple of miles. My left knee was talking to me but thankfully, minimal pain. Made our way to Mountain Crossings outfitter, topped off the feed bag, got snacks, used the bathroom, got rid of trash. Yeah, covered the basic necessities of a hiker returning to civilization.
Left Neels Gap and headed up Levelland Mountain. On the other side of the mountain we stopped for our second lunch. This time it was Spam and cheese wrap. I’m not crazy about spam and was kinda surprised it tasted pretty good. I think the hiker hunger is coming my way!   Anyways, Logan Ian’s I looked at the map and the next shelter was 11 miles away and it was 1.2 miles off the trail. Yeah, not going to happen!  There was a campground about 4 miles up the trail with a water source close by at Baggs Creek Gap. Made our way there and got a couple of great sites. Cot camp set up just before a fast moving, light rain fall came thru. As I write this 5 to 7 other hikers appeared out of the trees to join us. Perhaps a fire this evening!  Nice!

Had my first reach for the earplugs last night. A guy came into camp a little bit before sunset and set his tent about 20 ft from mine. Well no more than 20 minutes later the walls were vibrating on his tent!  It was perhaps the loudest snoring I have ever experienced.  I thought the guy was going to stop breathing. Other campers were upset and shouting but the guy just slept through it. Amazing!  He was still sleeping when I left in the morning. 
Today’s plan was to get a little over 14 miles into Blue Mountain Shelter. Climbed over Cowrock Mtn down into Tesnatee Gap and up over Wildcat Mountain. A couple of good climbs to get the blood pumping first thing this morning. Then a wonderful thing happened, the trail was smooth and mild. Made the miles fly by. Why can’t all the trail be like this!  
Stopped at Low Gap shelter for lunch and water. Lunch was the MH breakfast skillet which didn’t impress even though I tried really hard to enjoy the freeze dried eggs. I went with mostly freeze dried food to start and definitely feel a menu change is in order when I hit the next town. Drank a litter of water and carried two out of the Gap. It’s been pretty warm and dry down here in GA and I think I consumed about 2 gallons today and yet to pee. Get to drink even more water!
The next 4 or 5 miles the trail ran up an old train tracks and it was awesome!  Saw 2 snakes today, a garter and a black snake. The black snake was about 4 ft long and gave the Mainer Logan quite a start. He said they don’t see snakes in Maine. I said Logan, go to your happy place because you are going to see a bunch more on this trail!
Well, the railroad tracks eventually ended and we were left with the days final climb up Blue Mountain. The water source is about a quarter mile down from the shelter and we packed the evenings water up the hill. Yogi wanted to get into town at the gap, north of the shelter, but I wasn’t ready to go to town since I still had a couple of meals in my food bag. I’ll get there in a couple of days and refuel and shower....I desperately need a shower!  I feel like Pigpen walking around in a cloud of dust. Everything is dirty but life is good on the trail

Keeping my fingers crossed!  Anyways, had a decision to make this morning. I have 2 freeze dried meals, a Cliff bar, and some jerky. Unicoi Gap is about 2.5 miles down the trail and is an access point for the small towns of Helen and Hiawassee. I could do the short hike or I could hike 19 in a day and half and get to the next Gap with town access at Dicks Creek Gap. I chose the later and thought about meal planning. It’s going to be a hungry hike!  Let’s go!
As I was hiking down into Unicoi Gap I spotted a vehicle with tables set up near the access point. Could it be?!  Yes, trail magic!  George, who is planning a future thru had coffee and tables all set up with trail goodies. I told him he saved me from a hungry hike and his presence in the gap changed my total outlook for the day. Thank you trail angel George!
After resupply, it was nice steep climb out of the Gap topping Rocky Mount at 4000ft. Then it was a plunge to Indian Grave Gap and the an ascent up Tray mountain to about 4400ft. Good leg day today. Stopped down the side of Tray Mountain and a great lunch with a view. Forgot to mention, coming out of Unicoi Gap I hiked with a couple of older ladies carrying day packs. We talked all the way up the mountain. Page and Sandy tell me they climb the summits of Tray and Rocky Mountains at least twice a week. You guys rock!  Enjoyed talking with them
Hiked with Logan for about eight miles and he said he was stopping at the Tray Mountain Shelter for the night. I told him I was going to head for Addis Gap in another 5 or so miles. I hope we get a chance to hike together again. A really squared away young man!  Enjoyed our time together on the trail. 
Half way to Addis Gap I ran into Yeti, who had spent the night in Hiawassee and started out in Unicoi Gap. Yeti is from Israel and just arrived in the states to hike the trail. This guy is a globe trotter and has done the Pacific Crest Trail as well as a number of popular trails around the world. Great getting to know him but I doubt I will see to much of him since his minimal distance is 17 miles. Oh to be young!
Got my tent set up at Addis Gap where I’m about 5.5 miles from Deep Creek Gap.  My plan is to do a Nero (near zero) to the Gap and get a ride to Hiawasse and zero (no miles) to rest up and resupply. Knee felt good today but I’m sure it could use a day iced and elevated.

I assume no one wanted to stop because Deep Gap Shelter, which is closer to town and the pick up point, Dicks Creek Gap, is a mile and a half up the trail. But I gotta say I was smoked when I came into camp and perfectly fine with a 5.5 hike in the am. 
Yeti gave me some trail manic today!  He knew I was stopping for the night and he was going to keep going to get his 17 mile day in. Anyways, he offered to fill up my 3 liter camp bag. Of course I said sure til I realized the creek was a half mile off trail. He said no problem. Thanks bro!  Man, the people I meet out here!
Got up this morning a little sluggish. Didn’t think much and packed up camp, filtered water, and headed up the trail. First order of business was a 1000ft climb up Kelly Knob. Ugh!  Half way up I stopped and ate the last cliff bar with a half liter of water. Man, those 5.5 miles bonked me right out!  I knew I didn’t eat enough since I didn’t make dinner last night. Just didn’t feel hungry. Well today was a reminder to get those calories in no mater what.
The views on the way down Powell Mountain were gorgeous!  I could see Hiawassee off in the distance and that put a little effort in my trudging pace. It was a nice decline and I was relieved I had minimal pain going down hill like the past couple of days.  Perhaps my body is adjusting?  We’ll see
Made it to Dicks Creek Gap with about a half hour to spare and low and behold, who comes down the trail 15 minutes later?  Logan!  We took the free Budget Motel shuttle to town. Logan got the last room available and I went over to the Holiday Inn Express. We plan on meeting for dinner at the AYCE steak house near me. I’m so hungry!
Got the town chores done and am settled down for the zero (no trail miles) tomorrow. Want to give my body an adjustment day, particularly my left knee. Really enjoying the trail, seeing the gorgeous scenery, meeting fellow hikers, and living the hobo lifestyle.  Life is good!

Looking forward to getting back on the trail!
Great rest day in Hiawassee!  Went to Daniels Steakhouse last night and crushed the 8.99 buffet!  Had at least 4 or 5 plates of fried chicken, fried pork chops, and salad. Waddled back to my room and was able to FaceTime with the family. Life is good!
Went down to breakfast this morning and they had quite the spread; pancakes, cereal, oatmeal, biscuits and gravy, among other things. There was probably 8 other hikers there feasting on the goodness. It was good to commiserate about the trail and our strategies moving forward. Spencer (I named him Dogs because he has size fifteen ft) stopped by and we ate and discussed the weather moving forward. It’s supposed to drop into the upper 20s at elevation tonight with 20-30 mph gusts. Glad I’m off the trail but getting antsy about hanging out while it looks like decent hiking weather outside. Also, it’s supposed to rain on Saturday.  I gotta say, have had no real rain on this journey so far and am looking forward to it...kinda!
After breakfast I swung by the post office and sent about 1.5lbs of equipment I wasn’t using home. Then I went over to Ingles grocery and bought more food than is reasonable for a 3 day hiking trip into Franklin, NC, my next town stop. I just don’t want to experience the “bonk” effect again. The struggle with carrying the optimum amount of food for the effort expended is real!  Hopefully I can get it dialed in down the trail. 
Logan came by this afternoon and said he thought twice about continuing on a decided to stay in town another night. Glad to be hiking with him again and we spent the rest of the afternoon planning the next few days. We made plans to eat at Daniels again tonight. Best hiker deal in town!

Shower was awesome and strolled down to the lobby to enjoy another breakfast feast. Wasn’t disappointed!  The plan was to get down to the Budget Inn where Logan was staying and pay $5 for a shuttle back to the gap. It was about a half mile walk and I started around 0715hrs. As I was walking thru town with my pack on a car pulls over and asks if I want a ride back to the trailhead. Sure!  I noticed he has a Hiawassee PD cup on his console and I ask him if he’s with the Department, he says, I’m the chief. I tell him I’m retired LEO and where from.  He looks down at his hands and says, I’m really sorry for what happened to your colleagues. I was truly touched and amazed by the scope and reach of our big blue family!  He pulled over in the gap parking lot after our 5 minute drive and said he had to take off because he was conducting a car seat seminar in the next town over. I chuckled, yeah, been there, done that and got the merit badge. Have fun and thank you for your service Chief!
Not much of a signal from the gap so I had to climb out and when I got a signal, texted Logan to let him know I was on the trail and headed north. Another gorgeous day but a little on the chilly side with temps in the 30s. I was excited to cross my first state line and put my head down and made the 9 miles to the boarder before noon. What a great feeling!  One down, 13 to go!
I took a break at a log about 100 yards from the sign and proceeded to filter water and make lunch.

As the day hiking group passed one of the party go all excited and started reaching into the underbrush.  I was intrigued so I walked over and asked what they found. Ramps!  They gave me some to try and I enjoyed the garlicky/onion bite and immediately thought of adding to my ramen bomb (ramen and instant mashed potatoes) if I happen to find any myself. Sorry to say it didn’t happen despite my pulling and smelling anything that I though resembled a ramp. Argh!
Immediately after passing the famous oak tree that welcomes you to NC, the trail goes up and up. Ugh!  It wasn’t bad after the initial climb to altitude and was a ridge walk for most of the remainder with a few more up and downs. Made it to Standing Indian Mtn shelter and was relieved to find adequate tenting spaces and got settled for the night. 
Rain is forecasted to start tomorrow night and dump a total of two inches on the trail. If I can do another 16.7 plus tomorrow then I will have about a 7 mile wet hike into Winding Stair Gap and the small town of Franklin NC. We’ll see
P.S.  We got this FRU/USCP!  Let’s go!

Spokes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635495,"It was cold last night on Standing Indian Mountain!  Got up around 0630hrs to temps in the low 30s but fortunately the wind was nonexistent.  My hope was to get over Albert Mtn and position myself close to the town of Franklin, NC so I could get out of the rain and into town. Yeah, I know, no rain, no Maine. I guess the real draw of the town was that I read so much about in my studies of the trail that I had to see it for myself.  Also, I think Logan must be a few miles behind me. We were supposed to meet up at the Longbranch shelter but I got there around 1400hrs and pushed on because the hiking has been so nice. The trail is long and I’m sure we’ll meet up again. 
The first part of this mornings hike was about keeping the fingers warm. I rotated the poles between my hands so I could stuff a hand in the pocket. After a couple of miles I was swinging both poles without a problem. Still a little chilly but at least I wasn’t sweating. A little over 5 miles into today’s hike I stopped for coffee and breakfast. As I was enjoying my break, a man about my age passed and we exchanged greetings and he continued on his hike. Finished breakfast and headed down the trail. Eventually caught up the the gentleman and he introduced himself as Silva (Latin for forester). I hiked with Silva for the next 10 miles together and boy did I receive an education on the flora and fauna of the area. Great hike together. We stopped at Betty Gap and had lunch and met Grunts and Ragnar. They joined us for the botany lesson until Silva had to end his hike and walk back to his car but not before he left us at the steep section of the big climb up Albert Mtn.  Boy, that was an intense, steep climb!  Got to the top and we were rewarded with passing the 100 mile mark. Great feeling to have passed that land mark!  Only a little over 2000 left!  
Grunts, Ragnar, and I hike another 8 miles and made it to Rock Gap Shelter after a 19.7 mile hike. I gotta say, I really have enjoyed these NC trails so far!  Sure there are some steep sections that will have you sweating and breathing heavy but for the most part the trail is a dirt path with minimal obstructions. Really made good time. Enjoyed my ramen bomb dinner with a young group at the shelter until I retired myself to my tent to write this blog. Long day and I’m really surprised I don’t have any significant aches and pains. Great long hike today!

Now let me say that rain at 5000ft is a lot colder than rain at sea level. Brrr!  Grabbed my food bag and brought it back to the tent and began stuffing everything into my pack. Last item to go into the outside of my pack was my tent. Thank god I do not have to carry a wet tent in my main compartment!  What a wet mess that would be. Got my rain shell on and decided to go without the rain pants. If it got cold enough I would put the on but I just didn’t think I would be comfortable hiking in complete rain gear. 
The hike to the road had me climbing up a small mountain to reach the gap and road on the other side. Well, the hike up kept me warm and of course the easy climb down had me kind of chilled. Slipped on the rain paints and walked around the parking lot in the gap to keep warm until the shuttle arrived. It came within 30 minutes and we were off to pick up a couple of hikers back up the trail. When we arrived I saw Logan waiting for another shuttle. Great to see him again!  It turns out we are staying at the same motel, the Sapphire. Decent place

Got dressed for the day and went across the street to Hardies and had breakfast and coffee. My shuttle wasn’t arriving till 0900hrs and I had some time to kill. Walked back across the street to the motel and there was a guy there ready to take hikers back to the trail. Grabbed my stuff, turned in my key, and threw my gear in the back of the pickup. Let’s go!
Weather was a little cool to begin with but as the day progressed, I’d say we got into the 50s. Great hiking weather with clear skies. Also, the rain we got yesterday kept the dust levels down to a minimum. Nice
Today was all about climbing!  Climbed out of Winding Stair Gap about 1500 ft to about 5000 ft over Siler Bald. The views were nice over Siler but the best was yet to come. Climbed down Siler Bald to Wayah Gap then commenced a long climb up to Wayah Bald. The views at the top of the bald were amazing!  Clear skies and I could see for miles. Had lunch at the tower and got a chance to FaceTime with my oldest son. He was able to see why I was so excited when I got him on the phone and switched to FaceTime.  What a grand day of hiking!
After Wayah it was another 5 or so miles until Cold Springs Shelter where I was stopping for the night. This shelter was built in the 30s by the Civilian Conservation Corps and its still standing and in pretty good shape. It’s a small shelter so when I got there I had to look for a camping space since it looked like it was full. I walked up the hill from the shelter and found. A beautiful campsite with great views of the next valley.  Should sleep well tonight after this tough but beautiful day.

Got up around 0700hr and wasn’t feeling it. I had lost my groove. I needed to get it back. Packed up camp and headed down the trail and stopped at the first spring I got to, perhaps two miles down trail. At the spring all ready was Rootbeer ( AW are her initials) and we talked as I boiled water for coffee.  She is attempting a thru hike but has only done it with personal friends so far. She tells me she is running out of friends to hike with. I told her the trail is full of friends, just trust your instincts.  About that time, along comes Cole (NTNY) and the three of us settled down for breakfast. I gotta tell ya, the coffee, honey bun, and 2 protein bars got me back in my groove. Yes!
Today was another beautiful day!  Blue skies and cool temps. Great hiking weather!  An Initial look at the trail showed me dropping 3500 ft in about 5 miles distance, a knee pounding decent. But first was a climb out of Tellico Gap to the Weser Bald fire tower. Good climb and the views at the fire tower was amazing!  360 degree views and it was awesome. Next came the downhill. I remember reading something about a pleasant coast down hill into the nantahala outdoor center. Well, this wasn’t it. It was a tough down for sure!  Stumbled into the NOC and parked myself in front of the general store and had a couple of gator aides and ate a wrap sandwich to finish up my food bag. Went and re supplied at the outfitter when I bumped into Cole again. He mentioned something about a stealth site just out of town and along the River. I thought yes, after the pounding my knees took coming down I don’t want to go climbing up the same distance. 
Grabbed my gear and me and Cole went to a place called hobo river. It’s about a quarter of a mile outside of town and fit perfectly.  Headed back into town for tonight’s dinner and met up with Easy Eddy, an older hiker like me, and he followed me back to camp. It’s three of us set up so far. Texted Logan to head this way if he made it to the NOC. We’ll see. 
The plan is to sleep well and begin the ascent back to elevation. I gotta say it’s pretty warm and buggy at 1500 ft. Looking forward to getting back up in the mountains!

I was camped with Cole and Easy Eddie and I think we all slept good.  The plan today was to at least get to Sassafras Shelter, about 8.3 miles up the trail. Now today was going to be tough and we all knew it. It’s a 6.25 climb out of the NOC and if it was anything like going down into the NOC, it was going to be tough. Cole was staying back to pick up some last minute thing from the general store and Easy Eddie ( really easy going) had to use the bathroom before attempting the climb. 
I started off by myself and was about 2 miles into the steady climb when I saw this young person limping down the hill. He told me he twisted his knee and was going to pull the plug on his AT thru hike. Wished him the best and wondered what I had in store for me this day. Well, the climb went from 1500ft at the NOC to back over 5000ft in the space of 6.25 miles. For the most part it wasn’t that bad but there were a few really steep sections that got the blood pumping.
Reached Sassafras shelter at about 1130hrs and stopped for lunch. At the shelter there was 0B1 and Sherpa. I enjoyed my chili Mac mountain house while hearing about how Sherpa did a section hike with his 12 year old son. He got his name for carrying all the equipment for the both of them. Way to go Dad!
I quickly pondered staying but there was no way I was going to waste the remainder of the day sitting in the shelter. The next shelter was between 8-9 miles away. Let’s go!  Passed over Cheoah Bald and had a great view despite the hazy conditions. Forgot to mention it was in the low 80s today. A lot warmer than I am accustomed to.   Sweated bullets and started to worry about water. Was intending to get water at a marked spring 4 miles down the trail but when I got there the spring was dry. Argh!  Alright, so I had about 2/3 of a liter to get me over Mount Possible and into Stecoah Gap were there was a water source just off the road. Well, Mount Possible got its name because the person who named it didn’t think it was possible, lol. Got into Stecoah Gap and drank two liters of water and had a couple snacks
It was very fortuitous that I took the time to drink and get something to eat because my next climb was Jacobs Ladder. A hell of a tough climb 14.5 miles into my hilly hike and right before getting to the shelter. That my friends was a tough climb!  Staggered into Brown Fork Gap Shelter and just wanted to throw my tent down and climb in. But alas, camp chores had to be done including cooking dinner, setting up the tent, filtering water for the night, etc. good but tough day!

Called the Fontana Lodge , where I had shipped a package, but there was a Mini Cooper convention in town and all the rooms were booked up. Argh!  Ended up calling Creekside B&B and they had a tent space open with an indoor accommodation available for my zero tomorrow. I’ll take it!
Today was cool and overcast with temps in the 60s. Great hiking weather!  Looking at the guide it looked like today’s hike wasn’t going to be that bad and it wasn’t. Hiked a couple of climbs and ridges until we were about 3 miles outside of Fontana then we walked with the lake in the background. Really nice view. Hiked with OB1 and Kittyhawk (likes cats, notices everything). When we got to the famous Fontana Hilton shelter,OB1 decided he was going to stay there while Kittyhawk and I left for the camping at Creekside BB
Owner Cynthia picked us up at the visitor center, took us to the Lodge where Kittyhawk and I got packages shipped to then took us off to Creekside BB.

Boy was that a mistake!  Went to bed fairly early, around 1900hrs, with the intent of starting a new historical fiction I had downloaded to my phone. 2 hours later, the couple occupying the room above me went to bed. Not 15 minutes later I hear the loud guttural cough that goes on for about 5 minutes then I hear the sliding glass door open and then close 5 minutes later. This went on EVERY 2 hours!  Come to find out the guy staying upstairs was a chain smoker who had part of his right lung removed already. Said the only way to stop the coughing was to go outside and smoke. Argh!  
Today was about entering the Smokies. I got shuttles back to the visitors center around 0830hrs and there seemed to be a hiker parade leaving the Fontana Hilton headed in my direction. Walked quickly across the Fontana Dam, got my picture taken in front of the Smoky Mountains National Park sign, and commenced the climb up the mountains. The climb went from around 1800ft and topped out about 5000ft. A good climb and felt pretty good. My intention was to pass the first shelter(Mollies Ridge) and push on another 3.4 miles to the Russell Field Shelter in order to get away from the bubble of hikers following me up the mountain. We’ll see
The hike was great with bright skies, a stiff breeze and temps in the 50s. Gonna have to put my long sleeve on when I get to camp. About .75 miles after passing the Mollies Ridge Shelter I hear about 3 or 4 coyotes howling what seemed about a couple hundred yards off to my right. They must have a den close by. When I got to the RF Shelter, people were talking about a bear and Cubs the had seen about a mile back. Didn’t see a thing!  Not to worried about and will hang my food bag, as usual.

Blew it back up and of course two hours later I was back on the ground. Either have to find a creek that’s big enough or bite the bullet and wait til I can fix in Gatlinburg. No creeks in my future so I think I’m stuck with option b. Oh well
Today was another great weather day!  Clear skies and cool temps. Didn’t eat breakfast this morning and would pay for it later on in the day. The first 10 miles was all about going up and coming down, nothing in between. My first climb was tough making my way up Rocky Top..which by the way puts me on my 3rd state!  Yes!  Then it was a continued climb up Thunderhead Mountain.  Was really feeling the food deprivation by then and figured I could wait until Derrick Knob Shelter.

The rest of the day was a lot smoother as I worked my way up Siler Bald, getting to the base of Clingmans Dome, the highest point on the AT.

Good to see those guys again!  A lot of talk about getting up at 0400hrs and hiking to watch the sunrise in the morning. I wasn’t to inclined because I knew my mattress would be flat during the night and I wouldn’t get a good nights sleep. The third in a row if I chose the early departure and I wasn’t interested. 
Got up at 0600hrs this morning on a flat mat after hearing at least half the shelter move up the mountain in the darkness. Packed up and knowing I only had a little over ten miles to go today, didn’t eat breakfast but stuffed a couple bars in my pocket to avoid bonking on the hike. The climb up Clingmans was difficult and I enjoyed the transition in nature of the forest. Moved from a deciduous forest to one of pine trees and moss. Reminded me of the Pacific Northwest. 
Got a little off track when I followed the trail to what I thought was towards the summit only to find out I had gone nearly a half mile down the summit bypass trail. Argh!  Didn’t see a blaze and Guthook confirmed I was on the wrong trail turned around and thought to myself, if I can stop someone from making the same mistake it will be worth the trip. Soon enough, I met a young lady by the name of Trip (trips a lot) headed down the bypass trail. I told her she was off trail and confirmed it with Guthook. She hiked back up the trail where we met her friend, Fireplug.  The three of us hiked together until I  stopped for breakfast. They hiked farther along and I eventually caught up to them enjoying a break at the top of an incline. I hiked pass and in about 10 minutes, Fireplug whizzed by me exchanging greetings. I expected Trip to come by but she never did. Stopped for water at a spring and no Trip. Wondering what happened, I made my way to Newfound Gap. 
The Gap was packed with tourists, motorcycles, vehicles, and hikers. Met up with Kittyhawk. He was going to hike on but I was headed to Gatlinburg. Shooter also met up and continued on. Shortly thereafter, Trip comes into the gap and I wave her over. I guess her and Fireplug had a disagreement. I told her a shuttle should be coming in the hour but we could try and hitch at the stop sign. She agreed to hitch and of course, I stood behind her while she had her thumb out and was all smiles. Had a ride in under 5 minutes. Nice and thanks Trip!  I would have been there for hours.

Alright, let’s go, we got this.  Well, about a half mile into the climb we start to get thunder and lightning.  I turned around to check on Trip and she wasn’t there.

I initially tried to avoid the creek but after a while it just didn’t make sense to avoid it since my feet were already soaked.  So I charged right up/down the creek for just about 16 miles today. I gotta admit it got pretty hairy at times crossing the ridges with lightening around. I was going to stop at the second shelter I got to today after about 10 miles only to find that the shelter was a half mile down the trail. Ah, no that was not going to happen and just sucked it up for 6 miles to next shelter. 
One observation today. I passed 6 hikers in the rain today and all but one were women. I stopped at the first shelter I passed and 6 guys were sitting in the shelter along with a lone woman. My hats off to the women on this trail knocking out the miles in inclement weather!  You go girls!
Got to the shelter around 1500hrs and of course with the rain it is standing room only. Saw Logan, 2 packs, and Mighty Mouse as well as a bunch of other hikers I recognized.

Once I was walking they were fine but just not how I wanted to start the day. 
Logan and I planned to get out of the Smokies today. We had a couple of decent ups then about 5 miles of straight downhill. The rain from yesterday kept the trails wet but certainly manageable but I gotta tell my dogs were screaming after about 3 miles of those downhills. Wet feet on a long continuous downhill don’t mix well. Anyways, got it done and was able to change into my dry bed gear at the end of the day. Nice!
Not to many views with the overcast clouds today which was a disappointment.  After such an epic journey through the Smokies I was hoping for some beautiful parting shots. Go a couple but not to many. I can’t complain though because I have had some fantastic weather to this point of my journey.

Today’s hike was all about getting up to elevation after coming down out of the Smokies. To prepare myself, I had 2 packets of powdered donuts washed down with 2 hot cups of coffee. Perfect start to a day!  I climbed up Snowbird mountain for about 2 hours to reach the (I assume) FAA antenna at the top of the mount. Then it was straight down several miles to where I had lunch at Deep Gap Shelter. A hand written note at the shelter stated to be aware of a mother bear and 2 Cubs who were not at all shy harassing the area.

I also drank and filtered a liter of water since there didn’t seem to be many water sources until after Max Patch, some 5 plus miles away
I passed a couple of slack packers headed south. Slack packing is when u leave your pack, typically at a hostel, and take a day pack with water and food some distance away and hike back to your pack. I also passed a number of day hikers headed for Max Patch. Max Patch is a beautiful grassy patch about 4600ft up with 360 degree views of the surrounding mountains and today the scenery did not disappoint. The weather cleared and the views were absolutely amazing. All I could think of was Julie Andrews and the sound of music.

I gotta tell ya, I almost gagged putting my pack over my head and onto my shoulders this morning. Have not washed it it nearly two weeks and the sweating/rain have produced a really foul odor. The things hikers must endure!
Nothing more demoralizing than waking up after dealing with rain the last 2/3 days and hearing the tapping of raindrops on your tent. Come on!  Yesterday was a gorgeous day and why couldn’t it last!  No such thing. Packed up my tent and met Juice and Steady Eddy at the shelter. We conferred on a plan which involved us hiking a little over 10 miles to hit a hostel which was about 6 miles short of town. This would give us a nice warm place to stay before taking a nearo into Hot Springs. Sounded like a good plan. 
Today’s hike involved mostly just 2 big ups and a long down. The weather had stopped raining but as we topped the second up, Bluff Mountain, it began sleeting and the winds picked up. Truth be told, I always prefer sleet over rain. Anyways, made it over the mountain and started down the other side. We were in the clouds dropping down in elevation when the sleet/rain stopped. The trail was pretty muddy and really slippery on some steep parts. As we were coming down, we met a group of about 15 trail maintainers who were diligently working on the trail in muddy conditions for our benefit. Couldn’t thank them enough and one man bestowed my 3rd experience of trail manic by gifting us a Snickers bar. Thank you!  Powered our trip down the trail. 
Around 1200hrs, got to Garenflo Gap and called the place for a pickup since it was 1.5 miles off the trail. They said they were all booked up. Argh!  No one had passed us that morning so it meant all the hikers staying there were taking zeros and not moving today. Do people hiking this trail only hike on sunny days?!  That left us little option than to hike the additional 3.4 miles to Deer Park Mountain. Our plan is to get up and get into town early for a big breakfast, get our resupply for Erwin which is about 4.5 days down the trail, and eat a big lunch. I’m hoping there is lodging available but don’t have much hope. Most likely we will have to hike out of town with full bellies and food bags.

It was a little chilly last night and I felt I tossed and turned all night. Regardless, got up this morning at my usual 0630 only to find out Juice had bugged out while I slept and was down the trail. Can’t blame him, town food is such a powerful draw!  Quickly packed my gear up and headed down the trail after him. It was an easy 3.2 miles to town and I enjoyed the morning hike. 
Got to town and spotted the Smokey Mountain Dinner a little off trail. Done deal!  Walked in and met Gabriel who was waiting for a table by himself and eagerly joined him for breakfast.  Low and behold, they had everything I was fantasizing about last night, chicken fried steak, hash browns, 2 eggs over easy, gravy, and a biscuit. Score!  I was in heaven. Thank you god!
Stumbled out of the dinner and met up with Juice who recently resupplied and we looked for a place to get laundry done and cleaned up. Walked up to the Iron Horse Station and inquired about a room. She told me they were all booked up but welcomed us to hang out, which we happily did. After about 5 minutes she came back and told us if we got our laundry together quickly she would run it their washer/dryer before they started the Inns laundry. We said sure, thank you!
Walked around town in my clean clothes and resupplied at the dollar general and outfitter. Need about 4.5 days of food to make it to the small town of Irwin a little over 70 miles down the trail. Always like a little buffer just in case. Anyways, after resupplying I went back to the Iron Horse and was told if I could shower in less than 10 minutes then one was available. Sure thing!  I was out in 7.5 minutes. What trail magic!  We were also told that if everything was booked we could go across the river and hobo camp. With that said, that’s just what we did. Planning on walking back to town and getting dinner at that great establishment with awesome owners. Thank you for a magical day!
Tomorrow’s plan is to hit the dinner one more time for breakfast and start plugging along to Erwin. 
Good day!

Nice and filling. It must be obvious by now that food is becoming my main focus during this hike. Lol. I think about food ALL THE TIME!  There is no doubt in my mind that I have the “hiker hunger”. Food is good!  
Woke up this morning and knew we had a climb getting out of town. However, today’s climb was a little bit tamer the the usual town exodus climbs. First part was steep and then pretty subtle after that. On one of the ridges I got a pretty good signal and was able to FaceTime with the family and wish the wife a happy Mother’s Day. Forgot to mention that yesterday I bought a Mother’s Day card and got to the post office at 1045hrs to mail it out. Well, the post office closes at 1030hrs. I called my wife in the post office and told her I was bummed out because I couldn’t mail the card and that the next chance I could mail it out would be in Erwin, TN, 70 miles down the trail. Well, someone must have heard me because a nice lady opened a door and asked if I need anything. I said, Yes, please!  What an angel!  Got the card off. Will still be late but not as late. 
Had a bear sighting about 2 miles outside of town. I was coming off a ridge into an old campsite and saw what at first I thought to be a medium sized black dog. It quickly noticed me and scampered up a hill. I suddenly realized it wasn’t a dog but a juvenile bear, perhaps a yearling. My first bear encounter on the AT.  Hopefully not my last. 
I also saw my first rattlesnake of the trip. A hiker named Flash (he’s fast) passed me and we exchanged pleasantries.  I was about a quarter of a mile behind him when a heard a slithering close by off to my left. The rattlesnake was about a foot off the trail heading away. He must have been right near the trail when Flash passed. I got a couple of pictures. Big guy, must have been 3-4 long. My head was on a swivel the next few miles just in case he had a friend. 
Overall a great hike they the forest today. Nothing to difficult but lots of rhododendron tunnels which I really enjoy. I was perhaps 3 miles from my destination for the day when I come around a corner and find trail magic. Yes!  So unexpected and so appreciated!  Minnie and Mickie, 2016 thru hikers, got a cabin in the woods close by and spent the weekend providing trail magic to passing hikers. Thanks guys!  At the magic was Flash and I was able to show him pics of the snake he must have almost stepped on. He was amazed to say the least. Lol
Finally got into camp after a long day and have yet to see Juice today. Perhaps he took a long time wishing Mom and Grandma a happy Mother’s Day. I’m sure he will show up later. 
It’s getting windy and rains are expected to move in tonight and remain most of tomorrow. Great!  It’s been at least 24hrs since I’ve been rained on. I must be overdue. Debating a long day tomorrow but the weather will play a factor. 
P.s.  Taken tons of pictures and will upload the next chance I get.

Spokes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636753,"Juice made it in just before the high winds and rain started about 1900hrs last night. The wind and rain was really howling. At one point during the night a tent stake came loose causing a little water build up inside. Must have slept right thru it. Wasn’t to bad and ended up packing up a slightly damp bag and gear with the hopes that I could lay out my gear when the sun came out later in the day. 
Today’s hike was all about making miles in the rain. Wasn’t much to see and the trail almost seemed like an obstacle course. Nice and flat for a mile then came a boulder filled jungle gym I had to navigate followed by a climb/decent. Enjoyed a nice wet hike in the Tennessee hills until about 1400hrs when the sun started peaking out.  Passed Flint Mountain shelter after about 14 miles and thought about stopping at 1430hrs. I just couldn’t stop because everything was still wet and there was no way I wanted to sit around and watch my stuff dry. Figured I’d push on to the next shelter, a little over 8 miles away. 
A couple of miles down the trail I see a sign nailed to a tree advising that Laurel hostel was at the next road crossing. With a little more than a mile to go, I quick stepped to the idea of getting my clothes and gear dried and perhaps a shower. Bingo!  Got a bunk for $20 bucks and quickly spread out my gear to dry. Also jumped in the shower only to quickly jump back out because the water wasn’t heated. The smell won out and I endured an eye opening showers and got clean again. Nice to be clean!
Gathered around the picnic table with few other hikers for a self made dinner when a hiker, Justus, pulls out his ukulele and is playing some great tunes. He’s pretty good!  Life is good.

It was just the 3 of us in a 6 man bunkhouse...and no one snored!  Texted Juice but he had no signal and didn’t get my message until he was 2 miles down the trail. Will catch up tomorrow. 
Great hike today!  Weather was a little cool but the sun was out and the cool weather went well with all the climbing today. I gotta say, being able to dry out all my gear at the hostel was clutch. Of course, the food and shower, though cold, helped too.  Anyways, stopped at Hogback Ridge shelter for breakfast and met back up with Juice and Flash. Water was limited over the next miles so I thought it prudent to make the .33 mile hike down to the water source from the shelter. 
The big test for the day was climbing to Big Bald. Took a couple hours to make our way up to the summit but the tiredness, hunger, and thirst were all replaced by euphoria once on the top. The views were amazing!  360 degree views with mountains all around. Just breath taking. 
Hiked down the bald and stopped at Big Bald shelter. Bear cables were down and there was trash in the fire pit. Pretty soon Juice, Brew, and Shooter showed up and we discussed moving on. Rain is set to move in overnight and we did not want to be so high up on the mountain and made the group decision to move 3 or so miles down the mountain to Whistling Gap. Hiked down and got the tents set up ready for bed. Great day!
Tomorrow’s plan is to hike into Erwin and take a zero day tomorrow. These old joints of mine can use the day off!Also, will upload a bunch of photos while on my zero.  Signal has been pretty bad for uploading photos.  Stay tuned

Quickly got my gear packed up headed out with Shooter with a little over 13 miles to go until town. I got to tell ya the motivation of reaching town, let alone the rain, put a motivational step in my hike. So much so that I was hiking out with Shooter and never saw him again. He was headed past Erwin so hopefully we meet up again. 
The hike wasn’t to challenging. A couple minor ups then a hard down hill into town. However, I did fall for the very first time in 340 miles. Wasn’t a bad fall, hurt the pride more than anything when I stepped on a bunch of wet roots and went down on my right hip. Minimal pain so I just kept on going thinking I’m glad I’ve got that behind me. 
Finally made it to town and was coming out of the trailhead when I saw a familiar vehicle. Was thinking trail magic when my wife of 26 years jumps out of the car and says, Happy Birthday!  What!  You drove 6 hours in the rain to wish me a happy birthday!  I dropped my poles and gave her a big hug and kiss. Thank you darling!

My plan was to check out by 0800hrs and walk the couple of blocks to Dunkin’ Donuts where we could call for a shuttle around 0900hrs.  Unfortunately, options for a shuttle prior to 0900hrs didn’t exist. Kittyhawk and I got there around 0730hrs and hung out drinking coffee and eating donuts. A great way to start a day!  A gentleman came in, ordered a muffin and asked if we wanted a ride to the trailhead. Sure thing!  We were able to grab Juice and get over there just before 0900hrs. 
Today’s hike was once again about getting out of town which typically means climbing. Which we did but it wasn’t to bad. First order of business was climbing up to Beauty Spot, about 12 miles up the trail. It was gorgeous, 360 degree views for miles. On top of that Clover, a 2019 thru hiker, offered trial magic in the parking lot adjacent to Beauty Spot. Had a full food bag so I just had a couple of cokes. Thanks Clover!
After Beauty Spot we had another good climb up Unaka Mountain. There are no views on Unaka but what makes it special is the pine and moss forest at the top. Thick primordial pine forest with moss growing up the sides of the tree and on virtually everything in the understory. Just a beautiful green environment. While up there dark clouds started moving in and my pace quickened to the shelter about two miles away. When I got to Cherry Gap Shelter after 17 miles, the threat of rain dissipated and Kittyhawk and I made the decision to hike another 4 or so to a camping spot with a piped spring. 
We are camped at Apple Orchard Gap after my first 20 mile plus day. Felt really good despite the climbing. Great hiking day with the weather threatening then clearing. There may be rain tomorrow, keeping my fingers crossed. 
Packed out probably more food than I should have but my plan is to eat every chance I get. I’ve lost a good bit of weight and need to make sure I eat enough to make the long haul. Great diet plan, right!
Tomorrow’s plan is to make as many miles as we can to Damascus. Trail Days is this weekend in Damascus and I’m totally ok with missing out on the festivities. I just want to get a new pair of shoes when I get to town at one of the outfitters there.

Got my gear packed up and passed Kittyhawk as he was taking down his tent and advised him I would see him down the trail. Within two miles I had spotted two large piles of bear scat on the trail. Didn’t think much of it and was just glad we didn’t get visited during the night. While I was thinking this, I heard a hound dog off in the distance just barking away. I was thinking wow, it’s got to be really hard hiking the trail with a hound dog and all the animal scents.  Well, the barking gets closer and I quickly realize the barking is getting closer and it’s not on the trail. At this point I’m on a minor ridge overlooking a draw in the valley. I stop and listen and hear something coming thru the vegetation directly below me. Not ten seconds after I stop a black bear of about 200lbs comes charging out of the brush panting, coming towards me.  He stops about 20 feet away, panting heavily, and takes off to my right. Meanwhile, the dogs seem to have gone to the left away from the bear I surprised. I kept on hiking and finally heard when a group of dogs finally treed a bear. I figured they did since I only heard the hound then all of a sudden I heard a bunch of dogs barking. Didn’t hear a shot fired and can only assume it was a tracking effort on the wild life services or perhaps a hunter getting his dogs ready for the fall hunt. Who knows. 
Today’s hike was awesome once again!  Weather was fantastic and the plan was to get over Roan Mountain, the last 6,000 ft mountain until perhaps New England. I gotta say I rather enjoyed the climb perhaps just because it was the last high climb in a while. The incline for the initial climb was moderate and consisted of a dirt path. It later turned into a rock ledge climb that brought me into another spruce forest above 5000 ft. Didn’t have any great views but that would change. Stopped at the Roan Mountain Shelter for lunch and it got pretty chilly quick.  Kitty Hawk and I moved off the mountain down into like a visitors center where a ton of day hikers had parked and were exploring the surrounding hills.  We soon found out the draw was hiking over Round Bald and Jane Bald. Just amazing views!  Came down off Jane Bald and eventually worked our way to the Stan Murray Shelter after a good day of hiking. 
Tomorrow’s plan is to hike the 12 or so miles to Rte 19 and stay at the Mountain Harbor Hostel. Supposed to have the best breakfast trail. Cannot wait!  Yum!  Juice is staying at the Roan Mountain Shelter tonight (brr!) and we are hoping he catches up with us tomorrow at the hostel. Great day!

Little did I realize then the the trail passed through the Roan Highlands. Getting a little ahead of myself..
Started out of camp and passed many day campers and hikers traversing the area. Not thinking there was anything special about the area I was kinda surprised. All I saw when I looked at the map was “one up, a down, another up, and then a big down”.  Went up the first up and passed a bunch of people camping and a few day and section hikers. Coming up the next up I realized I was getting into something special...the Roan Highlands!  Gosh, I gotta read my maps better at night!  The place was gorgeous!  Being a Sunday, there was a lot of people enjoying the area.  I’ve never been to Scotland or Ireland but picture the Highlands being very similar, high rolling grassy countryside with incredible views all around. Great climbing up these big bluffs with my head on a swivel. Views everywhere 
Enjoyed the climbs but I gotta tell ya it was pretty chilly with the cloud cover and winds sweeping the area. Made my way down the highlands and was greeted to a boulder scramble for a number of miles as I worked my way down the Mountain. KittyHawk and I made our eventual way to Mountain Harbor at the bottom of the climb. This is an awesome place for hikers but was kind of quite with Trail Days going on in Damascus. I’m hoping the food truck opens for dinner otherwise it’s back to my food bag. No big deal. I did however pay $13 for breakfast and am looking forward to it.

It was wonderful!  
After I ate I told KittyHawk I was headed out and would catch him down the trail. He’s a very fast hiker and I had no doubt he would catch up. With a full belly, I hiked the .25 miles back to the trail and immediately went up out of the Rte 19 gap. First couple of miles was uphill but then a beautiful thing happened. The goat trail of a roller coaster that has been the AT suddenly mellowed to smooths ups and downs. I was moving!  I passed Mountaineer Falls and stopped at the shelter after 9 miles feeling pretty good.  I had my eye on on Morehead Gap Shelter at about 18 miles and when I got there KittyHawk had caught up and we discussed strategy. We could hike to a campsite with water and make it a 20 mile day or go a little over 4 miles farther into the Black Bear Resort for a camping spot, cold drinks, and frozen pizza. Frozen pizza won out. I don’t think I will ever say again in my life that a frozen pizza inspired me to hike a 24 mile day. But there it is. 
Great hike again today!  Temps were in the upper 60s and low 70s. Could really feel the uptick in humidity but it was ok. The waterfalls, smooth trails, and rhododendron tunnels were the highlight...not to mention the fantastic breakfast that made it all happen!  Great day and really beat but I have a smile on my face at the end of the day.

In fact never even saw the owners as KittyHawk and I stepped back on the road for the .5 mile walk back to the trail. As I walked, I tried stuffing protein bars and snack cakes down my gullet just to ensure I had enough energy for a good days hike. 
The first part of today’s hike was about getting down to the Laurel Falls where the namesake falls came tumbling down the mountain side. Definitely to cold to swim but the thought did cross my mind. We hiked along the Laurel river for a mile or so then it was time to tackle Pond Mountain. This beast requires a climb of 2.5 miles and with the rising humidity had us soaked and wishing we would have jumped in the river. 
Once down Pond Mountain we came upon Watauga Lake and walked around the lake for a couple of miles then straight up and away from the dam. Another really good climb. Looking at the map it didn’t look that tough but it really put me thru the ringer. I think yesterday’s long mileage day really did affect today’s hike. Oh, forgot to mention, once down Pond Mountain we stopped at the Boots Off Hostel for frozen sandwiches to power me thru the remainder of the hike. I gotta say though, those sandwiches were only good for a couple of hours at best. 
We climbed out of the lake and went straight up while enjoying views of the lake from the ridge line overlooking the lake as I climbed. I spent so much time wiping the sweat out of my eyes that I probably missed a couple of nice shots. Eventually made it to the Vandeventer shelter after a 17.7 mile day. Not as long as I wanted but the climbs and humidity really took their toll today. At least it didn’t rain!

I quickly ate a Snickers and stuffed two Luna Bars in my pocket and ate them for breakfast as I picked up my poles and headed north. 
Today was another gorgeous day but the humidity and haze didn’t help the views and therefore my photography opportunities were limited. But really, today’s efforts were all about making miles. Stopped at the first shelter after 8 miles and wolfed down a wrap with a foil packet of chicken and some slices of pepperoni. Also consumed a peanut butter cookie cake for desert. About 3 miles down the trail a section hiker told me there was trail magic at the next gap. I was hiking with M&M and we quickly picked up the pace. Yes!  
Beth and Bernie who were out supporting their son Bitcoin on the hike had a wonderful trail magic setup complete with everything the wandering hiker may need. I had 2 Cokes, a Mountain Dew, two Gatorades, a bologna sandwich, corn chips, 2 large homemade oatmeal cookies, and a large slice of watermelon. It was awesome and gave me an opportunity to catch up with hikers I haven’t met and one, Flash, that I thought was way ahead of me. Turns out he hurt his Achilles and is taking a couple days off. Gave our most heartfelt thanks to Bernie and Beth and continued north. 
Myself, Kittyhawk, and M&M stopped at a picnic table four miles further up were I enjoyed 2 snack sized Snickers and full sized one along with a new item I never tried that I picked up at the trail magic, a bag of Sour Patch candies...meh. Finally, after 22 miles, I stopped at the Abington Gap Shelter where I fixed myself a quarter pound of hard salami and a packet of pulled pork on my last remaining wrap. I also consumed the last of my Gorp, about 4 handfuls. 
We held a quick meeting between the 4 of us and decided to push on just a bit farther so that we may get breakfast in the morning at the Damascus Dinner. We kept going and found a campsite a couple miles down the trail putting us up for an 8 mile sprint into town for breakfast. Can’t wait!

It’s pretty much a declaration that I’m awake and you’ll soon be too. Let’s go!  And that’s just what we did. 
The weather was beautiful and the trail was tame for the most part. The highlight of the day was crossing the TN/VA border. What a great feeling to have gotten through one of the toughest sections of the AT being the southern Appalachians. Nothing came easy and I’m sure nothing will but to check that completion box in my adventure itinerary was awesome!  3.5 miles down the road KittyHawk and I passed they the Damascus arch. What a great felling!
Nearing 0900hrs, we quick stepped it to the Damascus Diner and I treated myself to the Mount Rogers breakfast, a heaping pile of food. It was awesome!  I then went to the outfitter in town and was able to replace my hiking shoes for exact replacements. Nice!  I was worried I would have to swap up and didn’t want to change since I experienced no foot issues to date...knock on wood!  We then went over to a couple of B&Bs but they were all full. Finally stumbled upon the Barrett House and were soon joined by M&M. 
Was able to FaceTime with the family, resupply, and do laundry before the four of us went to Wicked Chicken for dinner and met up with Brews Traveler and Sweetwattah for a mediocre dinner at best. The company made the meal.  Got a text from Trip and Juice saying they would be getting into town in the am. I guess Juice did over 26 miles to pull within 6 miles of town. Way to go hard charger! 
Going to zero tomorrow and am looking to get in summer hiking gear mode with some light weight hiking apparel. Will hold on to my puffy and use my 20 degree bag as a blanket unt I get over some of the higher elevation VA mountains.

Enjoyed breakfast with KittyHawk, Juice, and Gypsy. Going to miss those hiker breakfast servings at the diner!  I’ve really enjoyed my rest day Damascus. It’s kinda has a Mayberry charm to it. No horns honking, everyone knows everyone, and the houses are well maintained, and the people are friendly. May have to come back some time. 
Said goodbye to Juice and Gypsy and Kittyhawk and I headed north up the AT which for a time shares the Creeper Bike trail. It being a beautiful Saturday morning, there were no kidding, hundreds of cyclists on the trail. It was like playing Frogger when I spotted 50 Boy Scouts coming down the trail at me. For the most part it was fine but you always had a couple of kids that had to ride side by side no matter what. It certainly kept us on our toes!  Eventually, we made it to the AT cutoff and as expected, the trail climbed out of town. The climb up Whitetop Mountain was about a 4 mile climb straight up the side of the mountain. Thank God the humidity was no where close to where it had been a couple days ago. 
Made it to the top and met a couple of day hikers who told me there was trail magic in the parking lot about a half mile ahead. At this point I was out of water after the climb and excited to get something cool to drink. KittyHawk and I had the pleasure of meeting Chloe ( future 2022 thru) and her parents as they handed out food and refreshments to hikers just after climbing Whitetop. Thank you guys and I wish you the best of luck on your future thru Chloe!  So unexpected and so appreciated!
We spent a good bit of time enjoying the magic in the comfy camp chairs that i didn’t realize it was after 1800hrs and we still didn’t have a place to camp. Water sources were pretty sparse but we found one about 2 miles down the mountain, adjacent to the Elk Gardens parking area. We were able to get a couple spots and were also delighted to see that they had a privy and Bear proof trash cans in the parking area. Nice!
Tomorrow we are in perfect position to get into the Grayson Highland in the morning. This place is special not only because of the views but also for the small ponies that occupy the area. I heard they are attracted to sweaty hikers so I should be a big hit with the little guys!
Weather has been great so far but I’m worried about water. Passed a number of springs which are marked on Guthooks as reliable or nearly so only to find them down to a trickle. Not good. We really need some rain. 
Looking forward to the views and ponies tomorrow!
Until next time...","Damascus

Spokes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637760,"Last night we tented adjacent to a parking area which was filled with cars. When I got up this morning very few cars had left during the night meaning there were still a bunch of people in the mountains.  Kinda to be expected on a nice sunny weekend. I was hoping all the people didn’t scare the ponies away. I didn’t have to worry!
I climbed up from the parking area and opened one the many gates I would go they today and started up the mountain. First order of business was to climb Mount Rogers, Virginia’s highest peak. The climb wasn’t difficult but I could tell I was in for a Rocky day and stopped to put a knee strap on my left knee. We passed many people coming down from the highlands and also saw many more tents on the way up. Stopped at Thomas Knob Shelter for a quick 2nd breakfast and continued thru more gates into the Grayson Highlands. 
I think KittyHawk and I were so intent on looking for ponies that we missed the sign marking a significant milestone on this journey, the 500 mile marker. Dang!  When I looked at the Guthook app it said I was at 500.5. Argh!  I had that crazy song by 10,000 Maniacs in my head about walking 500 miles. Oh well. To this point we hadn’t seen any ponies but Immediately after cresting a small hill I saw perhaps 20 in an open field. Went down and stood around them taking pictures. There were a couple of small foals hanging with their mothers. So cute!  One pony ignores all the other nice smelling tourists and came right up to me for the perfect picture moment. I said it was my animal magnetism but really it was my sweaty stench that attracted the pony. Lol.  Also, made my way thru the Fatman Squeeze Rock tunnel without a problem. Nice!  Hiked through the rest of the park and the rocks were relentless. After yesterday’s 24 miles, my body took a beating today. I gotta slow down on the mileage. 
Stopped at the Wise Shelter for lunch and had to defend my food bag from a couple of ponies that had parked themselves between the picnic table and shelter. They weren’t overly aggressive but it’s difficult to eat with two 350 ponies staring at you while you eat. Needless to say I ate fast and packed up quick. 
Our goal was to reach the Hurricane Mtn Shelter after 20 miles but there were no tent sites available so we pushed on for another mile or so until we found a couple of tent sites by a small creek. Set up camp, washed a bit in the stream and ate a quick dinner of mostly spam and almonds. Hopefully it’s enough to get me started in the am. Took 400mg of vitamin I and am eager to put my head down. Long, rocky day on the trail.

Spokes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637797,"Had a great campsite last night by a small babbling brook and slept the best I can remember on this hike. Morning came to early and was packed up and on the trail before 0700hrs. Today’s plan was to get to the Partnership Shelter where a hiker could order a pizza for delivery or take a shower if so inclined. My plan was to get there and catch the free town shuttle at the adjacent visitor’s center and have it whisk me away town of Marion, VA for resupply. But first I had 18.3 miles to cover and the free shuttles came at 0815, 1115, and 1415hrs. Therefore, I had 6hrs and 15 minutes to catch the bus. Let’s go!
The weather was clear and warming as I stepped down the trail. The grades were fairly moderate and I soon found myself entering the green tunnel; green canopy above with a dense green understory. I was surrounded by green. Stopped at the Trimpi Shelter for a quick pepperoni wrap and water refill and still had a little under 10 miles to go. At 1300hrs I still had 3.1 miles to go. Looked at my watch and didn’t know if I was going to make it. Alright, I’ll push hard and see were I get in 20 minutes. 20 minutes later I had 2.2 miles to go. Argh, gonna be close. My knee was really starting to bother me on the down hills. I had less than a half mile of down hill and then the rest would be a a moderate uphill. I can do uphill. At 1340hrs, I had 1.1 miles left to go with a little more than 20 minutes left. I passed several hikers with the same idea and encouraged them, we got it, let’s go!  I rolled past the shelter at 1358hrs now I just had to get passed the visitor’s center and onto the main road. I made it, threw my pack down and drank my remaining water. A couple of minutes later the free bus showed up.  What a great feeling. 
I’m sitting in my motel room with ice on my left knee. I paid the price and know I have to slow down to finish this hike. Got together with my hiking partner, KittyHawk, and explained my dilemma. I’d take an unplanned zero tomorrow and ice and elevate the knee while he continues on without me. KittyHawk is a great hiking partner and will be missed but I gotta slow my roll if I’m going to finish this adventure. My knee isn’t to bad but I feel if I keep pushing it the way it feels now it will only become worse.  I definitely don’t want that to happen.  I got this!
My plan is to take a zero and limit my miles for a couple of days to around 15 and see how it goes. 
Still having an awesome time!

Spokes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637843,"Tough day to spend pent up indoors with partly sunny skies outside perfect for hiking. Knew it was for the best and spent most of my day with my knee propped up watching movies on HBO. I’m rather pleased with the nondescript Travelers Inn in Marion. Doesn’t look like much from the outside but it’s clean and has everything a hiker needs. Did take a walk to Walgreens for some Epsom salts and plan on soaking in the tub later. Knee felt pretty good and will pop some vitamin I and strap on the knee brace before heading out in the morning. 
Heard from M&M and KittyHawk telling me there is plenty of food and a good Mexican restaurant right on the trail in Atkins. Nice!  My plan is to eat a hearty breakfast at McDonalds and then hit Atkins for lunch.  Also heard from Juice and he is about a day behind so I don’t think I’ll be hiking solo for to long. 
Will be good to get back in the woods.

Spokes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637925,"The free shuttle back to the trailhead was scheduled to pick hikers up in front of the Walmart at 0815hrs so I headed to McDonalds for a couple of biscuits and a cup of coffee before heading out. I took some vitamin I after eating and made sure I had the knee brace tightened down. Walked over to Walmart and met Bandit, Rage, and Giggles as we waited for the shuttle. At 0845hrs there was still no shuttle so I called the number and was told that the shuttle bus had already came by at 0830hrs. I said that’s impossible because I’ve been here since 0800hrs. I was told I would have to wait for the next bus at 1100hrs. Argh!  Well, shortly afterwards another city circular bus came by and I complained to the driver about no bus showing up at 0815hrs. He got on the radio and lo and behold the trailhead driver admitted he never came by Walmart and would come pick us up in a few minutes. Alright, no damage done just a few minutes later than planned. Bus showed up and we got back on the trail around 0920hrs. 
Hiked up out of the gap and could tell it was going to be a warm, humid day. Hiked slow and took it easy most of the day. The highlight of the hike was discovering the rhododendrons were starting to bloom. I was surrounded at times with beautiful purple flowers against a vast green landscape.  Beautiful!  I passed the Settlers museum which was closed but was pleased to see the Lindamood School house (1894) was open and enjoyed taking a look inside for a flashback to the late 19th century. After about 7 miles I stopped at the Chatfield shelter for water and a break. Decided to take the brace off because I was still feeling pain and thought it was perhaps cutting off circulation to the knee. The downhill into Akins didn’t look to bad and figured at that point why not try something new. Didn’t feel any different but I really slowed down the final four miles into Atkins. 
Made it to town and met back up with Bandit, Giggles, and a bunch of others hikers I recognized. Ate a fantastic lunch at the El Burrito Loco and got a room at the Relax Inn and am  icing down the knee. Looks like the weather is going to get cooler over the weekend. Should be great hiking weather coming up.

Spokes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637995,"Got up this morning and almost fell to the floor when I put weight on my left knee. Not good. I gotta get this checked out. Waited until around 0800hrs and asked the hotel clerk if they knew of a shuttle service. The nice lady at the counter said, Sure, my son Ben can take you but he doesn’t get up until around 0900hrs. No problem!  Thank you!  Ben showed up around 0945hrs and said he would take me to the Marion Hospital for $15. Done deal. Got in his car and off we went. 
The short story is tendinitis of the patella and bursitis of the knee. The cure, a couple of shots in the hip, rest, ice, and ibuprofen. No permanent damage, just overuse. So the plan going forward is to rest and recuperate at the motel for the next two days. Ibuprofen 3 times a day with ice.  I’ll start once again Saturday morning with an easy does it approach.  I know I’m going to get antsy sitting around a motel all day. Argh! A bit of a setback for me for sure but it’s a lot better than having to get off the trail.

Spokes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638123,"Got up eager to get back on the trail this morning. I had packed up most of my gear yesterday and the last thing I did before leaving was to put on the knee brace and say a quick prayer. Didn’t feel to bad after the first mile and felt it was possible to continue on. I passed a significant milestone today with passing the quarter way point. Nice!
With all the rain we had yesterday I thought today was going to be a muddy mess. It wasn’t. I guess the ground was so dry it soaked it all up. Passed thru a number of pastures and climbed more than a few stiles. About 6 miles in I stopped for a second breakfast and water break. Once I got started I began having pain issues with my left knee again. Argh!  Went really slow on the downhills but I couldn’t get any relief. This is so frustrating!  My mind is full steam ahead but my body isn’t cooperating. Started thinking of options. I could really scale my miles back and pull into Pearisburg by the 13th when my wife is going to pick me up so I can attend my sons graduation or I could ask my wife to pick me up now and spend two weeks recovering and then jump back on the trail. The latter made more sense to me. 
I asked my wife for advise and she thought spending 2 weeks healing the knee made more sense. Sold!  My plan is to take a couple weeks off the trail, see a specialist, and jump back on at Snickers Gap, right after Bears Den. From there I will hike to Maine then return and finish the Virginia section. In order to qualify as a thru hike, my hike has to be completed before April 15, 2022. 
I’ll put the blog on hold until I get back on the trail.
