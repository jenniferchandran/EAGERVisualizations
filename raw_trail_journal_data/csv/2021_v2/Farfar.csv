Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639921,"I've made my list and checked it twice.  Also did an overnight on the AT last week.  Started at the Elk Pen parking lot off Rt 17 in NY, hiking north through the Lemon Squeezer, camping at the William Brien shelter. All went well except I had to stand and stare at my ridge line and tarp, guessing how to pitch them.  Happens every year.  I practiced back home and think I've got it straight now.
I'll be hiking with Gayle ""Rainbow"" again this year.  She's an excellent hiking partner and, though she actually completed her section hike last year, has agreed to hike with me this year as I attempt to complete my own section hike.
We'll be heading into New York City on July 14 to take the Dartmouth Coach up to Hanover, NH where we'll be met by old friend Jennifer.  We'll have dinner together and Rainbow and I will spend the night at the Hanover Adventure Tour Hostel.  We start hiking north from the VT-NH border the next morning.",,View Entry,"Jun 27, Sun",0
Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640887,"Hiking partner Gayle, Rainbow, arrived yesterday evening at Newark Airport where I picked her up and headed off to dinner at our dear friends Dotty & Steve’s home. We enjoyed a fine homemade Mexican-ish meal and lively conversation topped off with homemade ice cream. 


It’s 11:00 and we’re waiting at the River Edge, NJ train station to be whisked away to Penn Station in New York. From there we hike to Port Authority Bus Terminal where we mount the Dartmouth Coach to take us to Hanover, NH where we’ll be met by my friend Jennifer. We’ll have dinner together at a local eatery and she’ll drop us off at a nearby hiker hostel for the night. 


Tomorrow will be our first day on the AT, hiking from the VT-NH border at the Connecticut River to Moose Mountain Shelter, 11.5 miles north. 


I’m starting off with a base weight (excludes food and water but includes fuel) of 24.4 lbs which is a bit heavy. My food bag weighs 8.1 lbs which is also a bit heavy, but contains more food than I need to get me to our first hostel stop after four days of hiking. 


I really want this hike to be successful. I turn 70 in October and think it would be nice to finish the Appalachian Trail before that particular milestone. Barring serious injury, I believe I can accomplish this. Wish me luck. 


Now it’s 2pm and we’re on the Dartmouth Coach after a bit of drama. I had assumed this bus would be leaving from the PA Bus Terminal. When we got there we learned there was no such bus. After calling the Coach we learned that it leaves across town from near Grand Central. After two cab rides (don’t ask) we arrived at 150 East 42nd St and the bus was there with a line of waiting passengers. Thank Gosh this bus comes with a potty and free snacks. This is good because a) I needed to pee and b) we hadn’t had time to grab lunch. I’m settled in my comfy seat for a 5.5 hour ride to New Hampshire. And now I’m in bed at Hanover Adventure Tour’s hiker hostel in Norwich, Vermont.  Our bus arrived in Hanover on time and Jennifer was there to meet us. We enjoyed a nice dinner together reminiscing over old times. This is a nice new hostel. I’m showered and ready for a 9:00 AM shuttle to the New Hampshire border at the Connecticut River.

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640934,"Our first day. After walking through the town of Hanover, home of Dartmouth College, for a half hour, we headed into the woods where we belong. It was a definite climb out of town (isn’t it always?) but the morning offered a decent amount of superhighway, our term for easy-to-walk portions. We stopped for water and snacks around 1:30 and then proceeded to hike uphill for the rest of the day. We arrived at our shelter seven hours after our 9:15 start. 
It’s a nice shelter area with a view from Moose Mountain, apparently so named for its distinct lack of moose. No droppings encountered. I had nice chats with other hikers here including with Daybreak and her pooch Clara. 
Dinner was mac & cheese, peanuts and dried fruit topped off with a cookie bar baked by Gayle’s friend. I consumed lots of water today. Five or six liters. It was warm and super humid. Even so, my legs cramped up shortly after climbing into my hammock. This always happens to me. Fortunately they stop happening 2 or 3 days into my hikes. 
Tomorrow the plan is for a short day, but we may continue farther up the trail in order to avoid a 12-miler up Smarts Mountain the following day.","VT-NH border

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641049,"I’m lying in my hammock at 3:20. It was a short day in terms of miles (8.6), but a tough day. Day 2 of hiking can be challenging with your body beat up from yesterday’s first day and you’re not yet conditioned for big miles on tough terrain. Our plan, therefore, was to hike a short day today of 5.7 to Trapper John Shelter. But my plan didn’t make sense. We made it to that shelter a little before noon. Way too early even for us elderlies. So we hiked an extra 2.9 and set up camp just before a gravel road after which begins the long slog up Smarts Mountain. That will leave us 9.4 to get us to tomorrow’s planned shelter and a 2115 foot climb. And don’t count on us sticking to tomorrow’s plan either. The AT Guide says, “Shelter on steep .3 mile side trail, unreliable stream…”.  We may need to improvise again.
Stealth camping is when you make camp at a location other than a designated shelter or campsite area. We found a nice spot with a babbling brook. It’s funny that my hammock is tied to a tree with a wooden sign nailed to it that probably read “No Camping”, but has since faded away to nothing. 
Rainbow, hiking behind me, commented that my pants were so soaked with sweat that it looked like I’d been swimming in them. I wear long pants to help keep the ticks at bay, but I’d be cooler in shorts. Pretty much all the young hikers who make up the majority of long-distance hikers wear loose fitting shorts. 
Here’s another funny. Background:  This is about water treatment. Gayle uses the Sawyer Squeeze filter system, by far the most commonly used method on the trail. I use a SteriPen, a UV method. On the evening prior to starting this hike, I asked Gayle if she carried a backup means of treating water. She said she didn’t. I’d been considering ditching my backup which were Aqua Mira drops. I decided to keep my backup as it’s light and compact. Yesterday, on our first day of hiking, Gayle went to filter water at our very first water stop. It was clogged. Just dripped out pathetically and only after a hearty squeeze. So I zapped water for both of us with my SteriPen. That worked just fine. But… I left its protective cap there. So now the business end of my UV light travels with me unprotected. And they’re pretty fragile. So on day 1, we both had failures. I will replace my SteriPen when I get a chance. Gayle’s thinking about getting one too.There is absolutely no internet here which is sad. I was looking forward to chatting with Joan who’s hanging with buddies Dotty & Steve. Sadly I fear there will be many such nights along this wilderness path.Today’s photo is of the privy at Moose Mountain Shelter.  Not so private  Carl “Farfar” Hagelin","Moose Mountain Shelter

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641080,"The rain started mid morning and quickly became heavy. It didn’t stop till around 3:00. The AT was mud and pools of water. After a while there was no point even trying to avoid the mud. Streams of water were flowing down the trail. But that’s OK. As the saying goes, “No pain, no rain, no Maine”.
I’m happy to report that my legs are holding up. Despite hiking for 11.5 hours today, I managed to keep going. We hiked a paltry 12.4 miles. That’s a tiny bit over 1 mile per hour. No doubt about it, we’re in New Hampshire. We summited two mountains today. Smarts Mountain was the higher of the two but Mt Cube was the killer with miles of ridge climbing across great slabs of granite made slick with the rain. It was slow going and a bit scary. Most of our falls today were slip-sliding in mud and we didn’t get hurt. 
As predicted, we didn’t camp at our plan’s shelter, Hexacuba. We passed there shortly after 1:00 and decided to move on in order to make tomorrow’s hike to Hikers Welcome Hostel a bit shorter. It’s a good thing we did. Though we only hiked an additional 3.3, those 3.3 took us 5 hours. That’s Mt Cube for you. We’re stealth camping again at Brackett Brook. It’s a nice spot and thank Gosh we didn’t have to make camp in the rain. Wouldn’t you know. As soon as typed this last sentence, I hear the pitter-patter of rain on my tarp. 
It’s 11.5 miles tomorrow to the hostel and the terrain doesn’t look too bad. We shall see. This state is known for tossing the unexpected at hikers. 
Again, no cell service tonight. (sad face)","Lyme-Dorchester Rd

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641100,"It rained all night and most of the day today. I’ve never seen the trail this wet and muddy. Water crossings were high. Sometimes we had to be submerged up to our ankles. But overall the terrain was easier than yesterday’s and we made the 11.5 miles in 7.5 hours. We arrived at 2:00. Had we not hiked the additional 3.3 yesterday, we’d have arrived here at 7:00. (See yesterday’s post)
After a short road walk from the trail, we arrived at Hikers Welcome Hostel. They’re best known for facilitating northbound hikers in getting over Mt Moosilauke, the first of the high peaks of the White Mountains. They do so by shuttling hikers to the bottom of the north face of the mountain at Kinsman Notch so they can hike southbound back to the hostel. This is helpful because the north face is very steep and, for hikers like me, going up is far safer than going down. The south face has a longer, less steep descent. I’ve signed up for tomorrow’s shuttle. Unfortunately I’m the 7th person and they can only take 6. That means I’ll miss the 7am shuttle and will need to wait for the 9am. As a slow hiker, I don’t like starting out late. 
I was speaking with a young southbound couple who had just hiked Moosilauke today.  I asked them if they thought climbing its north face in the rain would make it more dangerous. “Just watch your footing on the wooden steps and you’ll be fine”.  They felt that in general the state of New Hampshire did a lot more than Maine in order to make their challenging sections safe. That’s good to hear.

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641146,"Mo, Kenwood and I were on the late shuttle to Kinsman Notch this morning for our 3759 ft climb of Mt Moosilauke.  We rode through very heavy rain. After hearing so much about this climb over the north face, I was feeling apprehensive and the rain didn’t help. As soon as we hit the trail we came to a water crossing. Any stones in place for hopping over were submerged so right off the bat we had waterlogged shoes. With two pairs of socks, hiking shoes and gaiters, that’s a lot of extra water weight to sling around with every step. Good thing we were slackpacking, carrying just a little food, a headlamp, first aid kit, water, and water treatment. The three of us decided to keep together for safety.
Soon enough we were climbing the most vertical slope I’ve yet to encounter. I was grateful to the Appalachian Mountain Club, the organization that maintains the AT through the Whites, for building features designed to make the ascent safer. In addition to the steps fashioned from granite boulders, there were wooden steps and some rebar grab bars in spots that otherwise would have been treacherous. The trail parallels a waterfall partway up the mountain. Today this waterfall was a powerful, raging spectacle. To be that close to it was awesome and intimidating. What if I were to slip off the trail and get washed down this waterfall? (I get these thoughts sometimes as I hike.). The good news is that death would come quickly as I’d be dashed against the rocks, bones snapped like dry twigs and be gone before I even had a chance to drown. 
After an hour and three quarters the trail diverted from the waterfall and became less steep, just another long uphill rocky climb. Mo and Kenwood were waiting for me at that point and we decided to split up and meet back at the hostel. I was glad to no longer be holding them up. There was still a long way to go to reach the summit which turned out to be our first exposed alpine summit. No views for me. Just cold mist blowing from the east. I needed to get back into the woods before I got too cold. The descent was longer, much of it was picking my way through rocks. But the last couple of miles had a lot of superhighway with a gentle downward slope. With my light pack, I felt like I was flying down the trail. 
Gee Farfar, with all the rain in the last few days, the trail must have been mighty wet. (I know that’s what you’re thinking.) We’ll I’ve never seen so much water on the trail. It was liberating in a way to be ok with walking straight through streams of flowing water and pools of standing water. No need to hop from rock to rock to avoid pesky puddles. And the water crossings, of which there were many, were the deepest and fastest I’ve experienced. The last one was up to my thighs and moving fast. 
All in all it was a very good day. Quite an experience. Not a walk in the park.","Hikers Welcome Hostel
",Hikers Welcome Hostel,"Jul 19, Mon",9.30
Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641240,"With my previous hiking, I’d come establish a rule of thumb when estimating arrival times. Assume an average of 2 miles per hour and then adjust up or down based on the elevation profile and trail conditions. It’s usually worked well for me. But now, here in New Hampshire, I’m defaulting to 1 mile per hour as my starting point. Today, as a good example, we hiked 7.5 miles and it took us 7 hours. 
We’re here at Eliza Brook Shelter as are Mo and Kenwood, the NOBO thru hiker duo that shared the shuttle with us this morning. The forecast called for yet more rain at 2:00. Aside from two 1-minute sprinkles, there’s been no rain and it’s now 7:00 in the evening. The sun has even made some brief appearances. I’ve even strung a clothes line. 
I’ve got the post dinner chills as most of my blood has vacated my extremities to focus on dealing with the massive dinner in my tummy. This is a common experience for me.   In this case dinner consisted of an entire box of mac & cheese. While that was cooking I snacked on salted peanuts (love that salty crunch) and for dessert I ate a Bobo’s muffin. This morning for breakfast I heated up two slices of last night’s pizza of which I’d eaten only half. If that sounds like restraint, it’s not. It was a huge 12-slice rectangular number with enough grease to make this morning’s paper trash fire a bonfire. This is why I hike. 
It took a while getting used to my full pack again, and climbing out of Kinsman Notch was another one of those now-familiar long, rocky climbs. We stopped twice to snack and once to gather water, of which I consumed four liters. And once again, no views were had. I’m sure it will clear up some day. No superhighways today and lots and lots of mud, which does slow us down. 
Tomorrow is an 8.8 mile hike over the Kinsman Mountains and past the first of the AMC Huts, Lonesome Lake Hut, and down into Franconia Notch where we’ll stay at The Notch Hostel for two nights, taking my first zero. 
I’m looking forward to zeroing on Thursday. I need to resupply and rest my limbs. There’s an outfitter in Lincoln I need to visit. My water bottle rig is failing. My 1-liter bottles hang from cords clipped to loops near the top of my shoulder straps and are secured from flopping about with elastic loops down at my hip belt. This works great as they’re always at the ready. But here in New Hampshire, each time I take a big step up, which is frequently, my knee hits the bottom of the bottle and out it pops, now dangling free and getting in my way.  It’s become a major nuisance. There I am trying to remain upright while fitting the bottle, often both, back into their holding loops. While this has always been a downside of this design, it’s more so up here.
I’ve called for an early start tomorrow, 6:00. I’m concerned about these Kinsman Mountains.","Hikers Welcome Hostel
",Eliza Brook Shelter,"Jul 20, Tue",7.50
Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641264,"After writing yesterday’s journal and reading a few pages in my book, I was ready for sleep. It wasn’t long before I saw the first flash of lightning followed by long rolling thunder. Soon the rain started. Lightly at first, but soon heavy. The thunderstorm kept on for a couple of hours, keeping me from falling asleep. The thunder claps would start off loud and crisp and bounce around the mountains and valleys and resolve into deep bass rumbles you could almost feel. What especially concerned me were the occasional drops of water dripping on my face. Will I wake up soaking wet?
As it turned out, by the time my alarm sounded, the rain had stopped. But oh what a mess the heavy rain had made. The torrents of water running off my tarp had splattered mud and leaf litter on all the gear and clothes I’d carefully stashed under my hammock. A new step in breaking camp was born:  wringing out my socks.
Because of the earlier 6:00 am start, I skipped breakfast and coffee and stopped for snacks along the way. In hindsight, not a good idea. Gayle commented that I seemed a bit sluggish as we picked our way up the Kinsmans. 
It was another day of overcast and occasional drizzle leaving me still wanting for a view. The hike up included many opportunities to puzzle over how to navigate climbing up or down giant boulders and granite slabs. Kinda fun. But the relentless rocky descent was slow and the days of rain had turned the long section into a stream. I will admit to entertaining thoughts of quitting, thinking about how much I wanted to be back to the comforts of home. It was then that I tripped on a rock and fell, landing twisted up on top of my new poles. I lay there, half submerged in water, thinking maybe I’m not good enough for this. 
But I made it to Franconia Notch.  We called the hostel and got instructions for how to get there which essentially involved another mile of road walking and a call to a local taxi service. The driver agreed to stop at a local store to pick up dinner. A cob salad and a tuna wrap.
They say never quit on a bad day. And when all was said and done (and thought), I enjoyed my evening at the hostel and was cozy and warm in bed. Tomorrow’s a zero and we’ll be boxing up much of our gear to ship six days ahead while we slack pack through the AMC Huts.  More on that later.","Eliza Brook Shelter

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641279,"Happy Days!  The sun is out. The birds are chirping. It’s a zero mile day here at The Notch Hostel. I was up early so as to not waste a minute of this. We set out and hung our wet gear outside to dry and booked a taxi into Woodstock for breakfast. We had an outdoor table and truly enjoyed ourselves. Back at the hostel we divided our gear between what we’ll be carrying as we slack pack through the AMC huts for the next six days. We won’t need our hammocks or cooking kits and we’ll only need snacking material as we’ll be feasting on great breakfasts and dinners at the huts. Off next to Lincoln for the post office. I mailed two boxes ahead to Joe Dodge Lodge where we’ll land after our hut crawl. We then hit the grocery store to resupply food and finally to the outfitter where I bought a new SteriPen and a bottle harness to replace my failed method. It’s mid afternoon now and I’m chilling on the deck. We’ll probably head back to one of those two towns for dinner.
The big highlight for tomorrow is walking the 2-mile Franconia Ridge, all above tree line. It’s considered the most beautiful stretch of the AT aside from standing atop Mt Katahdin. We’ll pay our dues though, getting up there with a huge climb up Mt Lincoln, the first of the Presidentials.","The Notch Hostel

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641476,"Dear readers, I’ve not been able to post journal entries for a while. I know you must be thirsting for more tales of high adventure and daring-do.
Last night while Gayle and I were out for dinner at Black Mountain Burger (excellent burgers), I checked the forecast and saw thunderstorms predicted for today. That certainly put a damper on my mood. Though I very much appreciated the nice sunny day we’d had for our zero, it would be nice to hike without rain. As it turned out, we had nice weather for most of today’s hike. On the shuttle ride to the trailhead this morning the driver was telling us about the mountains we’d be hiking. From down in the Notch they looked formidable, towering above us.   There were the 4000+ footers we were about to climb. Little Haystack, Mt Lincoln and Mt Lafayette, with Franconia Ridge running across their peaks. 
The weather held throughout our long climb. We stopped for food and water at Liberty Springs Tentsite along the way and donned jackets as the temperature had fallen. Once atop Little Haystack we began our traverse of Franconia Ridge. Eventually we rose above tree line and out popped the spectacular view we’d been waiting for. Big mountains in every direction and the tiny ribbon of I-93 below from which we’d looked up this morning. It’s a popular stretch of trail and there were plenty of other hikers up there including groups of day hikers wearing shorts and t-shirts. When the predicted rain came on our climb up Mt Lincoln, the wind came on strong and the temperature plummeted. I can’t imagine how the scantily clad hikers endured the cold and rain, especially when the hailstorm started. The hailstones were the size of Israeli couscous and were whipped up by the wind such that they stung the top of my bald head even through my hat and rain jacket hood. 
Once atop Mt Lafayette we turned left off the AT for the 1.1 down to Greenleaf Hut. It took us at least an hour and a half to pick our way down this nasty, rocky path. I dread starting our day tomorrow by walking back up. 
The AMC huts are great, though expensive. Full dinners and breakfasts cooked and served by the “croo”, the young staff employed by the AMC. Gayle and I got a small bunk room to ourselves. We spent time chatting with volunteer David who joined us for dinner. Soup, salad, peas, Israeli couscous (not the hailstones) with chicken, and chocolate chip cookies. 
Tomorrow’s a similar day in terms of mileage (6.6), but it starts with the heinous 1.1 climb up to the top of Lafayette. And we’ve heard it’s going to be a difficult 6.6. Breakfast is served at 7:00. We’ll need to be packed up and ready to go before then.","The Notch Hostel 
",Greenleaf Hut,"Jul 23, Fri",6.40
Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641484,"Breakfast at Greenleaf Hut consisted of oatmeal, scrambled eggs, sausage and coffee cake. Pretty luxurious when you consider we’re up in the mountains with roads nowhere near. Perishables get packed in by croo members. Non-perishables like flour and canned goods get air dropped by helicopter once a season. 
After breakfast we hiked the 1.1 back up to Mt Lafayette. It took a bit over an hour while the hike down yesterday took an hour and a half. We began the 6.6 to our second AMC hut, Galehead, at around 8:30. We arrived at 5:15, almost 9 hours later. It was definitely some of the most difficult hiking I’ve done. It was all either up or down with the down being very difficult for me, both because of the steepness and the rockiness. It’s difficult to adequately describe how hard and scary this kind of hiking is for me. I move so slowly that Gayle often has to stop and wait for me for as much as 30 minutes. I got rather discouraged. At one point I confessed to Gayle that I thought I wasn’t up to the task. That the trail here in New Hampshire had beaten me. She had to remind me that completing the AT has been a dream of mine for many years and that I can do it. She could see that I was tearing up and came back up the trail to me and gave me a big long hug. It helped and I did finish the hike feeling much better. Thank you Gayle.

The weather all day was fabulous. Full sun. Nice cool temps. And our arrival at the hut was timed just right for us to clean up and put our clothes out in the sun to dry minutes before dinner was served. A full Thanksgiving feast. Mashed potatoes, turkey, peas and gravy. Chocolate cake for dessert.
Cell service is weak. Just enough to send a text to Joan, but not to make a call. 
Tomorrow it’s Zealand Falls Hut at 6.8 miles. I’m hoping it’s not as difficult as today. 
A note on inclusiveness at the AMC huts. The bathrooms are often, but not always, marked Men and Women. I’ve seen signs in the bathrooms stating that they can be used by any gender or gender identity. All bathrooms, even those marked Men, have a basket of tampons. As the croo members introduce themselves they state their gender identity as, for instance, he/him. I applaud this effort to make all visitors feel welcome and safe. It’s a sign of our changing times.","Greenleaf Hut

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641505,"Last night after dinner a croo member read the weather forecast as radio’d in from the observatory atop Mt Washington. It called for rain this morning and thunderstorms this afternoon. This has not been a typical July here in New Hampshire. It was rainy, windy and cold when we started hiking up a long, steep climb. At the top of South Twin Mountain the wind was very strong making the rain sting our faces. But soon after the rain stopped and after an hour or so we began seeing our shadows. We stopped for snacks and I grabbed my bag of white cheddar Cheeze-its, my go-to snack. I would pull out one at a time, pop it in my mouth and chew as I reached in for another. I told Gayle I worried I’d develop repetitive motion injury. The rest of today’s hike was relatively easy and my spirits were up. We pulled in at Zealand Falls Hut at around 3:00. The thunderstorm never arrived and there’s plenty of time to squirm out of wet hiking clothes, munch some of my jerky, do some journaling and even take a nap. What’s missing is cell service. I haven’t been able to talk to Joan in way too longNot realizing just how difficult the hiking is up here in the Whites, I’d planned for a 14+ day tomorrow to our next hut. Trying to make that kind of mileage would be next to impossible and would be the polar opposite of fun. David, the volunteer back at Greenleaf Hut, had mentioned a shortcut. This morning I was up real early and studied the big laminated trail map of the area and pieced together a route that more or less heads due east to Mizpah rather that taking the AT that dips way south. I jotted down the route which involves four different trails. Here at Zealand I spoke with croo member Livy who confirmed the route. It’s about half the distance and I’m all in. Now I know what you’re thinking. Farfar’s cheating. He’s not really hiking the AT. To that I say, “Hike your own hike”.  Yes, I want to complete the AT, but this must also be fun and not a death march.","Galehead Hut
",Zealand Falls Hut,"Jul 25, Sun",6.80
Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641506,"We cut 6 miles off of today’s planned hike by heading due east on a few different trails rather than taking the AT. Being locked in with our hut reservations means we needed to get to Mizpah Spring Hut today and given recent experience, 14.2 seemed somewhat unrealistic. There’s a group of 14 hikers we met at Zealand who are celebrating 25 years since they all thru hiked the AT in 1996. Turns out they made the same decision about taking this shortcut today.Most of today’s hike was pretty easy and the weather was perfect. We arrived at the AMC Highland center in Crawford Notch where I tried to secure reservations for Carter Notch Hut for July 30. There was only one spot available so no thanks. Meanwhile Gayle went ahead to get to Mizpah before the crowd in order to grab us two lower bunks. When I get up to pee at night I’d rather not navigate climbing down a ladder and I like sliding belongings under the bed. 
The trail gods punished me for ditching the AT by dealing me a long, 2-mile climb at the end of the day. Hikers coming down kept assuring me I still had a long way to go. Dinner featured lemon chicken couscous finished off with chocolate cake.

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641518,"After yet another hearty hut breakfast, Gayle and I took off for today’s short 4.6 hike up to Lake of the Clouds Hut. Fog, mist, wind and chilly temps had us donning our rain jackets on our climb up Mt Mitchell. Before long we began popping up over the tree line. But with no views to be had we could keep our eyes glued to the rocky path. But once above the trees for good, the clouds began to clear and our shadows made their appearances. We found ourselves walking in an alpine wonderland.
It was one spectacular view after another. We’re deep into the Presidential range, passing by Mt Eisenhower and Mt Monroe with their summit trails beckoning the more ambitious hikers. We’d get glimpses of what we figured must by the mighty Mt Washington up ahead, but it was still obscured by fast-moving dark clouds. As our hut was less than a mile away, those clouds began to disperse and we could see the weather station atop Mt Washington, our destination for tomorrow.
With today’s short miles, reasonable trail, majestic mountains, and awesome vistas, this was no doubt the best day so far. And if I stand on the windy side of the building, I can get cell service. I was able to chat with Joan, see a photo of my bestie Steve holding his first grandchild, and get caught up with my journal postings. Woo-hoo!

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641620,"The summit of Mt Washington can be hit or miss regarding temperature, wind, precipitation, and visibility. It has seen 220 mph winds, the highest winds ever recorded. When Gayle summited three years ago there were high winds and zero visibility. We consider ourselves fortunate that today’s conditions atop the mountain were clear skies, breezy and cool. The views from the top were outstanding when we arrived at around 9:00. It was a fun 75-minute climb to the top. We snapped the obligatory photos by the summit sign after which there had formed a line of others waiting to get their photos. After checking out the visitors center, we began our hike to our final AMC hut, Madison Spring Hut. By the way, I’ve heard that staying in the huts is called “platinum blazing“.

We had another six miles or so from the summit to the hut. Sounds easy, right?  Not so. Most of those miles were through a giant boulder field. There was no discernible trail to follow were it not for the many helpful cairns piled up along the way. Each step had to be carefully planned. I tried not to rely on my poles too much because their tips can easily slip off the angled boulders. Progress was painfully slow. Pennsylvania is notorious for its rocks, but I don’t recall them being as bad as these boulder fields. Well at least we had outstanding views throughout the day.
No cell service here. I’ve got Spectrum which supposedly uses the Verizon network. Can’t even send a text. Yet Gayle, using Straight Talk and Michael using Consumer Cellular were able to make calls. Hmmm.
Dinner was exceptionally good tonight. Vegetable soup was so good I asked for the recipe. Turns out Emily, today’s cook, improvised her own recipe and added a secret ingredient: curry paste. Just the right spiciness. There was fresh baked bread, salad, corn, rice, and Korean BBQ. The only slight disappointment was dessert. The chocolate chip cookie bars were over-baked and crunchy when they should have been soft and chewy.
I’m a bit apprehensive about the coming three days. If the horrid rocks continue as they were today, we may have trouble getting into Pinkham Notch and AMC’s Joe Dodge Lodge where we’ll be meeting my brother Nate. He’s made 6:00 dinner reservations at Salt in Gorham. I’d like to be in early enough to shower and change clothes before dinner. Then we have a 13+ day over the Wildcats to get to our campsite. It’s likely we’ll need to break that day up and stealth camp along the way.","Lake of the Clouds Hut

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641626,"It was a very rocky hike up and over Mt Madison. A trail sign along the way indicated I’d gone 1.0 miles. I checked my watch. I’d been hiking for two hours. That’s how tough today started out. No dirt, just boulders strewn about by some deranged giant or more likely the result of the receding glaciers. Climbing down was so steep I chose to go backwards on all fours. This allowed my head to be closer to the sharp-edged rocks which cut way down on the fear factor. I was able to take longer and “quicker” steps this way. 

Though the rest of the day wasn’t nearly so steep, it was all downhill but the last mile or so as we headed down to Pinkham Notch. I was beginning to feel it in my knees and feet so my pace, even at the flat-ish part, was slower than usual.
Gayle arrived at our destination, Joe Dodge Lodge, before me and was able to make reservations at Carter Notch Hut for Saturday. This was great news for two reasons. We can take a zero tomorrow which I really need and our 13+ hike to Imp Campsite will be cut in half. 
On a tragic note, a man hiking yesterday with his 59-year-old mother stopped to ask me if I’d seen her. They got separated on the trail hiking to the next hut and she must have turned off onto the wrong trail.  A search party was organized. The man was staying at our hut. The next morning (today) I asked him if there’d been any luck. They had not found her but found her phone on the Buttress trail a mile from the hut. During today’s hike Gayle and I came across two members of the search party who inquired with us. I hope she survived the cold night and they find her. 
Brother Nate met us this evening and drove us into Gorham for an amazing dinner at Saalt. It was a fixed menu, a multi-corse Moroccan feast. He’s staying with us at the Lodge and will help us out tomorrow with laundry and resupply.","Madison Spring Hut

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641640,"My brother Nate had planned to hike for a while with us today, but since we’d decided to take a much-needed day off from hiking, he left his car keys with us and went out on a short hike on his own. Gayle and I drove into Gorham from the Pinkham Notch Visitors Center (Joe Dodge Lodge) to do laundry, resupply, and hit the Post Office. It was one stop shopping as all three were at the same little strip mall. We were all back well before noon. After packing away our clean clothes and food items, we headed off for BBQ lunch back in town.  I ate sensibly, a pulled pork sandwich and disappointing corn bread, while Nate and Gayle ate “Pig Piles”, an obscene heap of fries smothered in pulled pork and other foodstuffs. Even Nate, who endeavored to eat it all, was unable to finish it off.
Nate dropped us off at The Glen House, our hotel for the night. We’d been unable to extend our stay at Joe Dodge and all reasonably priced hotels in Gorham were completely booked due to an ATV rally in town for the weekend. This place is not hiker friendly. No laundry, no shuttle service to trailheads, and way too expensive. Because it’s a summer weekend, rates are high and there’s a 2-day minimum which they were willing to waive for us. But it’s nice sitting in our spacious room recharging our batteries both literally and figuratively.
I’ve pre-ordered a Lyft for tomorrow morning to get us back to the trail at Pinkham Notch for our climb up the Wildcats. But I have a concern. It’s only a 3 mile drive to the trailhead and Lyft’s quoted price is $7.50. Will there really be a Lyft driver close by enough to bother to take the fare?  The local hiker shuttle service is fully booked for tomorrow. Stay tuned.","Joe Dodge Lodge

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641712,"I left you with a cliff hanger yesterday. Did our Lyft arrive at 7:30 to take us to the trailhead?  The answer is no. Apparently there are few Lyft drivers in the area. So we decided to walk the three miles and hitchhike. As it turns out, a bunch of people were leaving the hotel as we were and I asked a couple getting in their car if they were headed in the direction of Pinkham Notch. The weren’t, but were happy to take us there anyway. As the saying goes, The trail provides.
It was a tough day of hiking. Clear skies, cool temps, great views. But it was almost entirely steep rocky climbs up and down. I don’t mind this kind of hiking. It’s certainly better than the boulder tumbles we’ve experienced lately. But it’s slow going climbing these mountains. It took us 8.5 hours to hike today’s 5.9 miles. And it’s hard on our legs and feet. By the end we were very tired. There was one spot that was particularly challenging: a giant boulder split down the middle. It must have been at least 30 feet high. We had to pull ourselves up this crevice with very little in the way of foot or hand holds. It didn’t even look possible except for that a few younger, stronger hikers managed to climb up before me. There were many grunts and groans involved and fear of slipping back down. But in the end we both made it.
We’re staying at the last of the AMC huts tonight. A bit different from the others in that it’s split up into a few different bunk houses and a separate building for the bathrooms.
This is the last day of July, and what an unusual July it’s been here in New Hampshire. Not only has it rained more days than not, but it’s also been unusually cold. Right now, waiting on dinner, I’m wearing a fleece hoodie and a down hoodie and a fleece hat. I certainly hope August proves to be more seasonable.

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641715,"In today’s photo you can just about make out Mt Washington in the background. It’s the highest peak and has the weather station on top. We were there 4 days ago.
It just keeps getting harder. Today’s descent off Mt Height had a section, maybe a half mile long, that was so steep and difficult, I wondered how I’d make it down without injury. I would look down in disbelief. How could the Appalachian Trail Conservancy allow this stretch to remain without hand holds and steps to make it safer. The caretaker at tonight’s campsite maintains this section and he’s asked the Forest Service to please do something. Apparently they want to leave it as is.
We stopped for snacks around noon and while eating we noticed a bird perched in a nearby tree. On a whim I held out my hand with a piece of jerky in it. Immediately the bird flew down and perched on my fingertips, picked up the jerky in his beak and flew away. Moments later she was back. This time Gayle did the same and the bird flew down and took hers. We were thrilled. I’ve always wanted a bird to eat out of my hand and here it happened for both of us. I didn’t recognize the type of bird, though it had the shape of a blue jay, but without the pretty blue feathers. It looked scruffier than a blue jay. Shortly thereafter I ran into two young southbounders and I told them about my bird encounter. They seemed nonplussed and explained that the bird was a Canada Jay, aka grey jay, and that they are known for this behavior. They themselves had experienced this a number of times. These birds can even become a bit pesky. Looking them up, I see another name for this bird is “camp robber”.  Oh well. It was still a very cool experience.
I’m back in my hammock tonight for the first time in many days. It’s nice. But it’s starting to rain. Not nice.
Tomorrow we hike to Rattle River Hostel where last year’s hike of Maine began. We’ll be done with New Hampshire","Carter Notch Hut
",Imp Campsite ,"Aug 01, Sun",7.20
Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641749,"We’re back to where we started last year’s hike, at Rattle River Hostel. Last year we had set out from here to hike the AT through Maine. I developed a knee injury and had to abandon the hike about midway through the state. Gayle went on to complete her hike. She’s accompanying me this year as I try to finish. We’ve got a shuttle driver to take us to Caratunk, ME tomorrow to the Sterling Inn, another hiker hostel. We’ll spend the night there and they will shuttle us up to Moxie Pond where I had left the trail.
Most of today’s hike was typical up and down for this state. Fortunately nothing too difficult or dangerous. And the last three miles were a gentle downhill with relatively few rocks as we walked beside Rattle River. We arrived at the hostel shortly after 2:00. Showers and laundry were our first order of business. We later split a large pizza with sausage, black olives and extra cheese ordered and delivered from Mr Pizza in Gorham, just a 6 minute drive away. Now consider that Gorham is where we did our laundry and resupply three days ago. We’ve had three days of hiking, two of which were 8 hour days, to get somewhere 6 minutes away by car.
So New Hampshire is in the bag. I’d always heard that it and southern Maine are the most difficult parts of the AT. Even so, I found the state more challenging than I’d expected. It is an amazingly beautiful state. I wish there’d been less rain and more clear skies. So many views were socked in by fog, mist and clouds. But many highlights there were. Being atop Mt Washington on a beautiful clear day was certainly one of them. Climbing southbound up the back side of Mt Moosilauke in the rain alongside the very powerful waterfall was exciting and awe inspiring. Crossing (swimming) Cascade Brook after three days of rain was a bit nerve wracking in the moment, but will be fondly remembered. Our Franconia Ridge traverse was exciting and spectacular, made more so by the hailstorm as we climbed Mt Lafayette.
But for me, some very challenging descents and more than a few outright dangerous spots leaves me with mixed feelings. I don’t understand why the Appalachian Trail Conservancy and the National Forest Service don’t do something to make certain pieces of the trail less treacherous. Some rebar grab bars shouldn’t be too expensive to install. I do get that the AT wants to be a rugged trail, but not just young people hike it. There are plenty of people like me who’ve waited till retirement to afford the time to hike its length.
I’m glad I completed New Hampshire and I look forward to Maine. Once I’ve completed the AT, I’ll be looking for more age appropriate activities.","Imp Campsite

He had told me yesterday that the trip to Caratunk would take three hours and that he needed to be back in Gorham for another hiker in the afternoon. He charged us $75, only looking to cover expenses. He’s in his 80’s and claims to be happier shuttling hikers than he’s ever been. He’s x-military and has interesting tales to tell. We arrived at 10:30, exactly three hours after takeoff.
I remember The Sterling Inn fondly from last year. One of the nicest hostels on the trail, in part because it doesn’t just cater to hikers. They host tourists, wedding parties and the like as well. Zach, the owner’s son, will be driving us to Moxie Pond tomorrow morning at 6:45, the spot where I stopped last year. From there we’ll hike three days to Shaw’s Hiker Hostel in Monson where we’ll stage ourselves for our hike through the famed 100 Mile Wilderness.
It’s called The Hundred Mile Wilderness because throughout it has no opportunities for resupply. Shaw’s offers a service for hikers where they take a sealed bucket of food items you’ve purchased to a location about halfway through. It’s a remote location, Joe Mary Rd, where we’ll take the contents of the bucket to get us through the final 50 or so miles. Once through the Wilderness we’re close to Mt Katahdin for our final summit and completion of the AT.

Our plan called for camping at Moxie Bald Lean-to, but we got there at 12:15 so we ate lunch and hiked on. We decided to stop at a tentsite that was listed on Guthook but not on the AT Guide. It made for an 11.8 mile day but much of the hiking was easy once we got ourselves up and over Moxie Bald. Once we arrived we saw that true to its name, it was perfect for tents but lousy for hammocks. We eventually found two spots that could work after snapping off lots of dead lower branches. One of my trees is quite skinny. I pitched my hammock and tried it out. Because of the skinny tree, my weight caused the tree to bend and my butt hit the ground. So I pitched it higher and that worked. Then I pitched my tarp over the hammock. After dinner I got into the hammock and the tarp which had been nice and taught is now sagging miserably because of the bendy tree. I’m doubtful it will work well should it rain. Let’s hope it doesn’t.
Our goal for tomorrow is to try and hike another 10 miles or so and stealth camp again which would leave us with just around four miles for the hike into Monson and Shaw’s Hiker Hostel. It would be nice to have a nero (nearly a zero) day before entering the 100 Mile Wilderness.

We hit the trail at 6:10. Exceeding our own expectations, we hiked 13 miles all the way to ME 15, Monson. It was easy hiking for the most part, and it started raining towards the end of the day, so we decided to make tomorrow a zero rather than a nero. We called Shaw’s Hiker Hostel but they were full so we called Lakeshore House and got two beds in a bunk room. And we were able to get them for two nights. Relieved at our good luck, we quickly settled in, borrowed loaner clothes, did laundry, took showers and ate at their in-house restaurant. We really enjoyed our appetizer of bacon-wrapped scallops in a maple syrup sauce.
With the help of doses of Vitamin I (Ibuprofen), my left heel fared better than it had yesterday. It feels best when climbing because I land on the front of my foot. The long downhills are the problem. Taking a day of rest and stretching will hopefully get me ready to start the 100 Mile Wilderness on Saturday.
Tomorrow we’ll head over to Shaw’s and see if we can consult with Poet on devising a plan for older, slower hikers.  He and his wife, Hippie Chick, run Shaw’s and he knows the Wilderness inside and out. Our plan calls for nine days of hiking, but Gayle thinks we may be able to do better. Fewer days means lighter packs.

We walked over to Shaw’s to partake in their famous breakfast. Ten bucks for a big plate of three over easy eggs, excellent hash browns and bacon, orange juice, and blueberry pancakes. Later in the morning it was back to Shaw’s to resupply for the 100-Mile Wilderness. Five days of food will march out in our packs tomorrow and another five into a bucket to be delivered halfway into the Wilderness on the 11th of August, five days out. They say we pack our fears and it looks like I’m afraid of running out of food based on how much I’ve acquired.
Poet spent a generous amount of his time walking us through a plan he thinks will work for us and marked up a small map to take along. If-and it’s a big if-we can keep up with this plan, we’ll have made up the two extra days we’ve already added to our original plan, summiting Katahdin on the 16th.

Monson’s General Store makes excellent salads and sandwiches so we picked up lunch there. Dinner was enjoyed back at Lakeshore’s restaurant.

There were many hikers today and the waterfall we stopped by for water and lunch was downright crowded.
No big mountains today but it wasn’t easy going. The trail rarely stayed level; it seemed to be always going up or down. And I’ve rarely seen so many roots. They’ll slow you down for sure. But for the most part there were fewer rocks than we’ve been seeing.
The real kicker was the rainstorm that hit us hard for the last two hours of our hike. At times it was a deluge. It got so dark it was hard to make out details of the trail.

There was an unfortunate mixup at the end. I had thought we were planning to camp up at Chairback Pond, 0.2 miles off the trail. Gayle thought we were camping just beyond the cutoff at the stream crossing. She was hiking ahead of me so blew right past the cutoff and started making camp. I took the cutoff trail to the pond, thinking I’d find Gayle there. I was so sure I had it right that I left my pack up by the pond and went looking for her. I found her just beyond the stream, her hammock already set up. So I had to hike back up to the pond and get my pack. I was mad at myself for not wearing my pack when I went to find her.

Gayle warned me it would be tough based on her memory of the hike last year. It was a steep downhill over huge boulders. I utilized my new technique of going backwards on all fours. Even so, there were spots where I puzzled over where to place my next step. At one point I felt stuck. Couldn’t figure out my next move. It got so frustrating I felt myself beginning to cry. I was able to pull it together with words of encouragement from the erstwhile Rainbow.The Chairbacks are essentially four peaks of one mountain, cleverly named Mountain One through Four, Mountain Two not being part of the AT. Fortunately we’re done with them now and though there are still mountains to climb, they’re not as steep or dangerous. And of course there’s Mt Katahdin at the end whose own degree of difficulty is legend.Last night I heard raindrops pitter-pattering on my tarp at 2:40. I bounded out of my hammock and grabbed my hiking clothes and stashed them under my tarp. I woke Gayle to inform her of the rain.

This morning we hiked over the last big mountains we’ll encounter till Katahdin. On top of White Cap we had some cell service so I spoke with Joan and told her how we’d be finishing the Wilderness in eight days instead of our originally planned ten, thus making up for the extra two days we added early on. Gayle called Hippie Chick at Shaw’s to confirm that we’re on track to make our food pick-up tomorrow at Jo-Mary Rd, 12 miles out. The plan with Shaw’s had been to meet there at 4:00, but with another four miles to our planned camp, we asked if we could meet at 2:00 instead. It may be challenging to get there by 2:00, but we’ll be leaving before 6:00 and other than one climb in the morning, it should be smooth sailing. But if we think we might be running late, Gayle will break away and do the hustle.

I discovered a bit of a food situation this morning. I hadn’t really been conserving my rations, not bothering to assess what I had left until breakfast this morning. While drinking my coffee I dumped out my food bag and found to my horror that outside of tonight’s dinner of mashed potatoes I had a Slim Jim, a Snickers, a Kind bar and a packet of Cheese-its. That needed to cover breakfast and lunch today and breakfast and lunch tomorrow. Oops. Shame on me. Gayle was also low on food but was able to spare me a bar and a packet of Belvita cookies. So I ate no breakfast and split the Belvita packet into two portions which I ate during our morning climbs. Aside from that, I ate only a Kind bar in the afternoon, holding out for tonight’s mashed potatoes.  After dinner Aaron, with whom we’d been camping for a few days, gave us three spare Cliff Bars of which I’ll eat one for breakfast tomorrow. Then a little later, two women who had overheard our food conversation this morning, showed up with a little bag of their spare food. Now we have plenty. I treated myself to a “Fun Size” Snickers for dessert. The trail provides.

Gayle had arrived earlier and had already prepared a hot lunch for us. The pick-up was planned for 2:00, but the Shaw’s van was already there when we arrived. The kindly delivery man had a cold can of Coke for me and a frosty PBR for Gayle. (Pabst Blue Ribbon is the beer of choice among the AT hiker community.) After sharing the three bean chili and chewing on some jerky, we were off again for another four miles to Antlers Campsite making it a 16 mile day, our longest on this trip. To be sure we’d make the pick-up on time, we had started hiking at 5:25 this morning with only the faintest daylight illuminating our path.
With only brief climbs this morning, today’s hike surely represents what I’ve been hearing about the second half of the 100-Mile Wilderness. It’s nice and easy. Mostly level ground with only occasional rocks to maneuver, mostly near water crossings. There’s a lot of natural beauty up here. Ponds and lakes abound, blueberries growing alongside the trail, and areas where the mature trees are sparse and much of the forest floor is jam packed with new growth. It was somewhat disappointing, however, to hike for well over an hour to the sound of the lumber industry harvesting trees. Their operation was not in sight due to the AT’s protected corridor, but the noise sure came through. I think the big lumber companies own much of the land we’ve been hiking through.
Antlers Campsite is situated alongside Jo-Mary Lake, a rather beautiful setting. It was threatening rain all day but it never actually rained. The faintest of sprinkles started while setting up my hammock, but by the time we finished dinner it had stopped. Someone said the next two days will be hot. In the middle to upper 80’s.
Just three more days in the Wilderness putting us at Abol Bridge on Saturday. We plan to stay at the campground there where we hope to shower and wash our disgusting clothes.

And if not roots, then picking my way through rocks is another pace killer. I’m sorry to complain because the day had some really good offerings as well. There were two huge lakes we walked along, Jo-Mary Lake and Pemadumcook Lake, with the trail walking across their sandy beaches. There were also some stretches with level, soft pine needle footbed running alongside a stream. Perfect superhighway with a view. But when I hit the harder stuff, particularly after hiking six hours, I’m beat and just want to be at camp.

It didn’t get heavy and only lasted maybe a half hour. I put my shoes and pack under the hammock but left the clothes I’d rinsed out in a pool of water hanging on my clothes line. Call it a final rinse.
It’s really beautiful up here in north central Maine. Today the trail ran along streams with waterfalls, large lakes and ponds. What has become clear is that the closer we get to water, the rootier and rockier the trail becomes. It makes sense. These waters lie in a depression with the trail running alongside at a higher elevation. When it rains, the water naturally flows down into these bodies of water and while doing so, takes some of the dirt from the trail with it, leaving the roots and rocks behind. So we hikers pay a price for these pretty waterside views.
We climbed our last mountain today until our final ascent of Katahdin. At the top I was able to get cell service so I called Joan who was having her morning tea. It was so nice not to be cut off by spotty service. I got pretty choked up when I told her how much I looked forward to being back home. She sent me a virtual hug and expressed how grateful she is that Gayle is here to cheer me on.
We’re at a nice campsite tonight on Rainbow Lake. By the lake there’s a spring fed water source, a pipe running the cleanest, coldest, most delicious water ever. We were there before others so I stripped down and bathed in the clear lake and rinsed out my sweaty hiking clothes. It’s been quite hot and humid these past two days and my pants get soaked with sweat down to below my knees. Not pretty.
Just one more day in the Wilderness, an 11.2 into Abol Bridge. If we summit Katahdin on the 16th, it will be two days short of five weeks since our start in Hanover.","Wadleigh Stream Lean-to

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642494,"A smooth decamping and breakfast had us on the trail at a record breaking 5:15 this morning. We had decided to rendezvous at Hurd Brook Lean-to, the last shelter in the Wilderness, 7.7 into today’s 11.2. I showed up 20 minutes after Gayle and ducked under the roof of the shelter just as the first raindrops fell. A thunderstorm brought buckets of rain, but after snacks we donned our rain jackets and headed out for our last stretch of Wilderness. The rain slowed and stopped before too long leaving only the rumblings of distant thunder.
As I reached a point where I figured I had about an hour of hiking left, my thoughts turned to the 100-Mile Wilderness and how for so many years I’d imagined myself hiking it and completing the AT. Then I started noticing bright areas on the trail ahead and my shadow returning. Soon the clouds dispersed and the trail was dappled in sunlight. The forest leaves were still wet with rain making then nearly sparkle. Moments later I saw the sign up ahead warning southbounders about entering the Wilderness. How perfect an ending. Then I walked across Abol Bridge and snapped today’s beautiful shot of Katahdin.
On the other end of the bridge sits Abol Bridge Campground, a privately run campground with tent sites, RV spaces, and some small bunk rooms. Gayle, having arrived before me, had already managed to secure a cabin for us, had soap and quarters for laundry and soap and towels for showers. We took badly needed showers, threw our filthy clothes into the washer and went to the camp store to buy food for our upcoming final two days.
Someone in the store had told Gayle that the next two days were to be sunny. That would be icing on the cake, though today’s forecast is for winds and rain this afternoon. It’s 4:00 and so far just a little rain. The most important day for decent weather is Monday, our summit day.
Tomorrow we hike an easy ten miles to The Birches. It’s a small campsite reserved for northbound hikers who’ve managed to sign up early for a spot there. Otherwise there’s Katahdin Stream Campground. Both are located at the base of the mountain. The Birches is where Joan and I surprised Gayle last year by showing up early afternoon to take her by car out of Baxter State Park into Millinocket for lunch.","Rainbow Spring Campsite

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642497,"I couldn’t have asked for a more perfect day for staging myself at the base of Mt Katahdin. Our hike from Abol Bridge was, for me, probably the most beautiful of the entire AT. Not in offering breathtaking views or epic summits, but for the way it perfectly captured the eastern woods. Underfoot was mostly soft pine needles, the grade mostly level, the roots and rocks kept to a minimum. The air was cool and dry with a soothing breeze. We walked along the Nesowadnehunk Stream for miles with its cascading waters.
Our goal for today was to secure a spot at The Birches campsite, reserved for use by up to 12 long-distance hikers. As we understood it, the way to do so is to sign up for one of these coveted spots at a kiosk just inside the Baxter State Park boundary just a few tenths from our start. Last year Gayle left Abol Bridge early, just after 4:00, and sure enough, she signed in as number one. So this morning we left at the more reasonable hour of 5:30 and as we approached we saw three hikers sitting on the small bench under the kiosk with a fourth sitting nearby. I told them they looked like they were waiting for the bus to the summit. It turns out they were waiting for the ranger to arrive at 7:00 with the sign-up sheet. Amazingly, two of them had been waiting since 3:15. (Dan-here might be a legitimate use of an exclamation point.) Gayle’s rangerless experience last year may have been due to the pandemic. Gayle and I were numbers five and six. Another six came a little while later. We had an hour and a quarter to wait, but conversations were fun and the time sped by. The ranger arrived with the sheet 15 minutes early, we signed in, filled out our cards, and set off for The Birches.
We made the easy ten miles by 11:30. Gayle snagged the exact same spot as last year and I set up beside the small lean-to. Afterwards we headed back to Katahdin Stream Campground to fetch water and consume some snacks for lunch. We’ll need to check in with the ranger to show we’re one of the lucky twelve and pay our $10 fee. Nobody home at the ranger station so we walked back up to The Birches for naps and journal writing. We’ve heard that the ranger will stop by here later on to check us in so hoping we won’t need to make another trek down there. I’ll be cooking my final trail dinner of mac & cheese and tuna and will try to get to sleep extra early. Our plan is to get a very early 4:00 start for our 4200 foot ascent of Mt Katahdin. It’s the biggest climb of the AT, after which we need to climb back down. That’s the part that scares me most. The park offers small day packs for summiting, but I’m choosing to use my own pack which I will have purged of everything I don’t need to take to the summit with me. I need to be able to fold up and stash my poles while climbing the steep rocks using my hands and I’m not sure their little packs would work.
There’s no cell service except at the summit, so we’ll need to call the hostel in Millinocket from there to reserve a spot on their 3:00 shuttle. Forecast calls for another sunny day tomorrow.","Abol Bridge Campground

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642511,"What a day! Perfect weather for our ascent. I was up at 2:45 to be sure to be ready for our 4:00 start. With headlamps on, we started up the Hunt Trail, the AT’s trail up to the summit. It was easy hiking for most of the hour and a half we hiked with lights. Soon after the going got steeper and later still we broke through the tree line and packed away our hiking sticks. We needed our hands for climbing on all fours and grabbing rock edges to pull up with. There was no end in sight. Each time I looked up to see how far we had left, the top never looked closer. False peaks after false peaks.
I felt good and strong and was enjoying the long climb despite the numerous times I had to puzzle how I could possibly get up to the next foothold. I must have been pumped up because I actually got a fair bit ahead of Gayle.
Finally I reached the top of the steep climb to the sign indicating the Tablelands, the relatively flat section leading towards Baxter Peak, the northern terminus of the AT. With poles still packed away, we hiked another two miles with the final stretch being a climb up to the famous sign.
What a thrill it was to finally see that sign. All those years of seeing hikers perched atop it for their summit photos. And here I was, about to climb up that sign for my own summit photo.
It would be hard to overstate the magnificence and beauty laid out before me from this mountain. The Penobscot Indians revere Katahdin and continue to hold ceremonies each Labor Day to show their awe and respect. One can feel its power taking it in from below and from its peaks.
Gayle and I took turns posing alone and another hiker took our photo together. I ate a couple of snacks and some sips of water. As thirsty as I was, with only two liters for the day, I had to conserve. Then, with no cell service in the area except on the summit, I sent Joan my summit photo and called her. I was so happy to share my exciting news. Then I began trying to find a shuttle to get us to Millinocket from the base of the mountain where we had started. It was frustrating. My calls weren’t working nor were Gayle’s. Finally I made contact with The AT Lodge, the hiker hostel in Millinocket. Cody confirmed that their shuttle leaves at 3:00. It was already after 10:00 and I told him it had taken us five and a half hours to climb up. That would put us after 3:30 to get down. He said we should make our descent using the Abol Trail, that it would probably save us an hour and a half as it is a shorter route. So that’s what we did. Gayle stayed just ahead as we descended down this steeper trail, guiding my path from tome to time as I climbed down backwards on all fours. It seemed never to end, but finally, when back below the tree line, the trail did level off somewhat and she went ahead to be sure to make the road by 3:00.

The Abol Trail was so different from the Hunt Trail. Steeper with lots of loose rocks and slippery gravel. If you’ve ever noticed a giant scar running down the mountain, that’s the Abol Trail. It was a hot, dry afternoon and I was soon out of water. As it turned out, I was able to make the road by Abol Campground shortly before 3:00. Turning right I began the two mile road walk to Katahdin Stream Campground when before long, Ol’ Man, the owner of the hostel, came by and offered me a ride. I saw Gayle’s and my names on a sticky on the steering wheel. What a relief. Gayle was waiting at the lean-to where we’d stashed our gear.
After settling in at the hostel, doing laundry and showering, Gayle, Randy “Prone to Wander” and I hit the local pizzeria.  I guzzled enough lemonade and root beer to drown a small village. A nice long call with Joan caught me up on events back home.
Feeling grateful for having made it up and down without injury, I thanked the great mountain for safe passage. I thanked Joan for her continued support in my quest to hike the AT. And I thanked Gayle for her immense generosity, giving of her time and cheering me on when at times I felt unequal to the task.
I thank the Appalachian Trail for providing me a focus and goal for my retirement","The Birches

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642603,"Gayle and I were joined by Randy “Prone to Wander” for our post-summit activities.   He’s from Marietta, GA and also completed his AT section hike.  We spent the night of our summit at The AT Lodge in Millinocket and took their 9:00 shuttle in the morning to Medway where we picked up the bus to Bangor airport. Our flights weren’t till the next morning so we were not able to check our packs. The airport’s hotel had no vacancies so we booked a room at Motel 6. After checking in and paying an early check-in fee, a Lyft driver took us into Bangor for lunch. Back at the hotel we were able to book an early taxi for the next morning. Fond good-byes at the airport ended our shared adventure.
What can I say about hiking the Appalachian Trail that I haven’t already said? It’s a very difficult trail. New Hampshire and Maine taught me that. In my opinion, there are places on the AT that are downright dangerous and needlessly so. Most of the trail is through the eastern woods, “the green tunnel”, so compared to the great trails in the west with their vast open vistas, the AT has limited opportunities for views.
The AT captured my imagination about 20 years ago. I had read Bill Bryson’s A Walk in the Woods and in 2002 was vacationing in Rangeley, Maine when I noticed the trail crossing Rt 4. It struck me then about how amazing it is that there’s a walking path that would take me to Georgia. I began reading books of thru hike accounts, books about hiking, watching videos, listening to podcasts and reading AT blog posts. I became obsessed with doing a thru hike after I retired.
The 5268-ft view: Leading up to my 2017 retirement I hiked short sections of the AT, 5 to 7-day trips, to experience backpacking. A 2-week shakedown hike in 2017 prepared me for my 2018 thru hike attempt. After failing to complete my thru hike, I became a section hiker and began knocking off sections until this year’s completion on August 16, 2021.
Would I recommend hiking the entire AT? Probably not for people in their mid-sixties as I was, unless they were in exceptional physical shape and were highly motivated. I was not in the best of shape and it showed. Without exaggeration I was probably the slowest hiker out there. Honestly I passed absolutely nobody this year. Even the 77-year old woman we met hiked faster than I. But of course it’s not about speed.
One aspect of long-distance AT hiking that I very much enjoyed is the hiking community. Fellow hikers, trail angels, shuttle drivers and hostel workers make up a community bonded by the shared experience of hiking. I found myself often making connections with other hikers at a deeper level because of our shared experiences. We share the same challenges of difficult terrain, bad weather, hunger for town food, and dirty smelly clothes and often sharing updates on hikers we’ve met in common. What were your favorite hostels? Your favorite sections of trail?  Favorite state?
Finally I’ll say I’m really happy I took this on, proud to have completed it, and content to have it behind, leaving me free to look ahead to what may come next.",,View Entry,"Aug 18, Wed",0
