overall plan for the fifth year of my six month hike, is to start where I stopped in 2018 at Rattle River Hostel in Gorham NH and hike north
298.3 miles to the northern terminus of
the AT at Katahdin. Which is in the State of Maine's Baxter State
Park. This will finish my hike of the Appalachian trail.",,View Entry,"Mar 02, Tue",0

couple of things about training for the hike this year. My weight is
the same as two years ago, which is the last time I hiked. The last
three hikes my trail pack weight was 35 pounds, and I am planning for
about the same this year.

Two
years ago, I joined Rossford Community Center and was in the weight
room three days a week, and using their Jacobs Ladder to train on
(not very well I need to add). Walking the stairs at the Commodore
Perry with increasing pack weight, And walking three miles or so
either at Pearson Park or downtown Toledo three or four days a week.

In
2020, during the Covid-19 summer of lockdowns, I was walking 20,000
steps per day around downtown Toledo.  Weight
room were all closed in March of 2020, and I did not return to one for the remainder of the year.
 In
2021, During the winter I walked between 15,000 to 17,000 steps per
day, but did not restart weight room workouts until mid-March. By summer, I was walking over 30,000 steps per day, with about 10,000 of these daily steps coming from walking the ramp in a parking garage. I feel that I'm ready to hike.",,View Entry,"Mar 03, Wed",0
StillBill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632886,"I was planning
on doing this year's hike with my friends Boo Boo (Janice) and Sheep
Dog (Sarah). Boo Boo had to take a pass on this hike because she needed to take care of her mom. That is the right thing to do. This year's hike would be SheepDog and I.  The hike plan for 2021 put together by Sheep Dog has us
starting at Rattle River Hostel where I stopped in 2018 with a closed
avulsion fracture of my right ankle.
Then God willing, hiking 298.3 miles to the
northern terminus of the AT at Katahdin. We are thinking that this
hike should take somewhere around a month to carry out.
On August 20th,
I will fly from Detroit to Portland Maine meeting up with Sheep Dog (Sarah). From there the two of us will travel together to
Gorham NH. The hike start date is set for Saturday August 21 st",,View Entry,"Mar 04, Thu",0

I caught a Delta flight out of Detroit into Portland, Maine. Met up
with Sarah and the two of us got a shuttle to Rattle River Hostel in
Shelburne, NH. Just outside Gorham. I'm back at Rattle River!!!
We went out to dinner with Sarah's hiking friends Kim, Kayla and
Kayla's husband John. We will hike for 3 days with Kayla and Kim.
John, who is not hiking, will be picking us up at Grafton Notch, ME26
for a night off trail. With hurricane Henri coming at us, we may add
a zero day. We will only carry two and a half days of food this first
section to cut down on weight.","Toledo OH

Hiked 6.5 Miles. The plan for today was to hike 11.7 miles to Gentian
Pond shelter. First up was 2,555” Mt Hayes. The three women pulled
away from me very early in today's hike. It was clear that I had
trained wrong. I trained to hike, when I should have trained to
climb. By the time I did the 3.6 miles to the top, I was spent. We
had lunch together and were together at the 1,900 trail mile marker.
Then they were off again. Late afternoon, I met up with SheepDog at a
stream by Wocket Ledge. I needed to cut her loose, for I was holding
her down. It had taken me 11 hours to hike 6.5 miles. SheepDog then
finished the plan 11.7 miles and spent the night as planned with
Kayla and Kim at Gentian Pond Shelter. I spent the night a lone at
Trident Col Campsite.","Rattle River Hostel

Hiked 6.5 miles back. It rained during the night, but I got a great
night of sleep. I was up at first light, thinking about my plan. To
meet back up with the ladies, I would have to hike 14.8 miles and my
legs were not up to that. I only had food to take me past lunch the
next day, and the weatherman was telling me a hurricane was coming at
me tomorrow. If I go forward and do not cover the 14.8 miles, I will
run out of food in the middle of nowhere and will be in real trouble.
Boo Boo sent me a text telling me to go back to safety. I came out of
the campsite and headed south back to Rattle River. With no legs to
hike, it would be a 9 hour hike day to get back.","Trident Col Campsite

of the day: Making a reservation back at Rattle River Hostel.
Heading back south, I knew that Rattle River Hostel would be a
sellout for the night with the hurricane coming in. A mile into the
day's hike I was back a top Cascade Mountain and decided to call
ahead and make a reservation for the night. When the Hostel answered
the phone, I asked if there were any bunk beds available and was told
that they only had one private room left. I said that I would take
it, the Hostel asked me if I was going to ask them the price, I said
“what the difference, I am going to take it”. Well for $150, I
got a good size room with a king size bed and my own full size
bathroom. Not bad!","

Zero Day. When I woke up with weak and sore legs, I knew my hike was
over. I had called John last night and asked him to pick me up before
he headed up to the house that the five of us had rented for the
night. Late in the morning, the two of us were on our way to Bethel
Maine. We stopped and got the ingredients for John to make Chicken
Spaghetti, opened up the house, and went and met up with the ladies.
SheepDog told me it had been the hardest three day of the whole trail
that included Mahoosuc notch (The Hardest mile), Mahoosuc Arm, and
Speck Mountain.","

needed a zero day. We decided to keep the house for another night and
did not do much, just laid around all day. Just a side note: the
hurricane turned east and missed us.","

at ME26 for her to head north. Then we drove back to Rattle River to
drop off Kayla and Kim for now they will be heading south into the

StillBill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646078,"It's
been 4 months since I've returned from this hike, time for a big
change of my account. Looking back, I may or may not have trained
incorrectly. What I do know is that I have been limping since the
hike. I was only out there for two days. I now recognize and accept
that I hurt my right ankle just out of the gate on this hike. I do
not recall that happening, but it explains why I could not climb. I
was reporting that my “legs” were the issue. Well, with a right
ankle injury, it would have been sending pain up my right leg. Late
the first afternoon, I met up with SheepDog at a stream by Wocket
Ledge, after we parted ways, I had great difficulty kneeling down to
get water from the stream. When I got to Trident Col Campsite, I sat
on a large rock for maybe an hour before I could set my tent up,
again, kneeling down was the problem, because of my right “leg”.
Two days later at the rental house, walking the stairs was a big
issue for my right “leg”. 
November
5th,
I went to a Podiatry (Foot Doctor) and had my right foot examined
with x-rays. The doctor could not find anything wrong with the bottom
of my foot, but noted that the bone from my 2018 closed
avulsion fracture of my right ankle
was
“Still up”. I now believe that it is not “Still up” but up
again. As soon as I changed my ankle support to one that deals with
the old fracture issue, it started to get better. 

Ends
up, I'm not a wimp!, I'm just broken, and I'm going back to Rattle
River!!","
