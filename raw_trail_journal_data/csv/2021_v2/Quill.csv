Quill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633726,"Most people don't realize that the entire AT is maintained and protected by volunteer clubs from every state the trail passes through. In GA it is the GA AT Club or GATC (georgia-atclub.org) I am involved all year with maintenance projects - see my fresh blazes on the N side of Blood Mountain and some attempts at better drainage where it gets boggy there. This year I am also one of those trail ambassadors patrolling between Black Gap and Three Forks, including Springer shelter and parking area. Remember your LNT principles as you move gently through Georgia, please! Not every thru hiker gets to Maine but most every one gets to Georgia. 3-4 thousand hikers in a few weeks means lots of wear and tear on our trail resources, so tread as lightly as possible while still having a blast!
This year I will be sectioning from Hot Springs to Virginia and feeling grateful for all the hours and hours those clubs spend keeping the AT beautiful and hikeable for all of us.",,View Entry,"Mar 11, Thu",0
Quill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633794,"Fun fact: Covid regulations by the National Forest Service have impacted how the trail is maintained and monitored, especially during 2020. AT Club maintainers haven't serviced the privies in GA since March 2020... something to consider. (Hygiene, LNT proper waste disposal, etc.) Off the record I can say that some of those I've checked in the backcountry have composted nicely during their year off. Others close to popular spans along the trail might be awful. But as a general rule I think privies have some of the best sunrise views on the AT.",,View Entry,"Mar 12, Fri",0
Quill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634202,"Launch day is near so I'm doing 2 things today. First, going through my old pack and deleting things, repackaging things, and rethinking some luxury items. I have loved my Osprey's fit and comfort but have decided to try a Mariposa for a few pre-hikes just to see how it compares. It is so much lighter that I think it deserves a good inspection/ consideration with my gear loaded in it. I reweighed my packed Osprey after my mini-shakedown and it comes in at 17lbs base weight. Not terrible but shaving another 2lbs just by going with the Mariposa could be a game changer. We shall see when it arrives from the west coast.
After the shakedown I made a batch of homemade breakfast or power-bars. The recipe is sort of a mashup between ingredients in Hungry Hiker's Holy Mole' bar and the Super-Seed Granola bars from backroadramblers. Rather than cut bars from a large cake I pressed the mixture into a shallow muffin tin for individual round bars and I must say they are really delicious! I am a food motivated hiker so starting off with a breakfast I enjoy sets up my mood for the whole day. I love the subtle spice in these from the chili powder and the good calories from fruit, seeds, and coconut oil. Definitely taking some with me on my upcoming AT section.
Spicy Mama Granola Bars
1.5 cups quick oats, 1 cup chopped almonds, 1/4 cup sunflower seeds, 1/3 cup green pumpkin seeds, 2 tbsp toasted sesame seeds, 1 tbsp chia seeds, 1 cup pitted dates chopped fine, 1/2 cup chocolate chips, 1/3 cup almond or sunflower butter, 1/4 cup brown rice syrup (or agave syrup or honey), 1/4 cup coconut oil, 2-3 tsp Ancho chili powder or to taste (optional), 1/4 tsp sea salt
Mix ingredients well until uniformly blended and chunky. Lightly spray 12 hole standard muffin tin with cooking spray and firmly press approximately 1/4 cup of mixture to fill each. (Use a small measuring cup base to press into the pan.) Bake at 350 for 15-17 minutes or until the edges are just beginning to turn golden. Remove and let cool for 1 hour then turn out onto the countertop. Enjoy these high energy protein packed bars on the trail! (About 400 calories each and 8-9g protein.)",,View Entry,"Apr 02, Fri",0
