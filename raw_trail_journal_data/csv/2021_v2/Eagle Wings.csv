Eagle Wings,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639371,"Left Fredericksburg at 8:00 am and drove to starting point.  Susan stayed with me so I could slack pack all day.  We met at Loft Mountain campground for a minimal lunch then I completed the hike at 5:15 pm.  We drove to Elkton, Va and ate at the Old 33 Burger and Beer for dinner.  The food was great and then Susan drove me back to the trail.  We said our goodbyes and I had a final 1.1 mile hike to camp.  It was getting dark so I set up my tent and went to sleep.  It was a great start to this next adventure.  Thanks for the great day Susan!  I love you very much!!!","Pinefield Gap

Eagle Wings,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639373,"Started so 7:10 am with a lot of miles and food.  I also had to carry water since there were no streams or springs all day.  Fortunately I did get trail magic in the form of water caches at several intersections.  Legs and knees seem to be holding out but time will tell.  I took many breaks through the day.  I arrived in camp at 3:00 exhausted.  I put up my tent, got water, cleaned up, and then took a nap.  Got up for dinner and several deer came through camp.  About 20 people in camp.  Good conversation at dinner and the time to relax.  Worked on stretches and now completing this blog.  I should sleep well tonight.","Blackrock Shelter

Eagle Wings,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639465,"Left shelter at 7:20 am with several long climbs ahead.  Saw one deer next to trail.  Got to Beagle Gap and got a snack and rest.  Soon a car came by and asked if I needed anything.  The driver (Rumbles) worked at Stanimals hostel in Waynesboro.  We talked for awhile and then he drove off.  I met several NOBOS but one family was interesting.  The group had husband (Poison), the wife (Ivy), and daughter (Firecracker).  They were hiking to Harpers Ferry and then Ivy and Firecracker were flipping to Ga and hiking back to Va.  we figured we might see each other again on the trail.
I got to Rockfish Gap and decided I would get lunch in town and then hike to my shelter for the evening.  Within a few minutes Rumbles pulled up to drop off some hikers and he picked me up and took me to Stanimals.  I left my gear at the hostel, got lunch, and then rested for awhile.  I then got taken back to the trailhead and continued hiking.
About 1.5 miles south on the trail I sighted a black bear on the trail about 20 yards away.  The bear ran away from me and around a turn.  I was not sure if he got off the trail so I spoke “yo bear) for about 10 minutes to ensure the bear heard me.
I made it to the shelter and I am sleeping in it tonight.  Just 4 people in camp tonight.  Will sleep well I hope.","Calf Mountain Shelter

Eagle Wings,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639463,"Left camp at 7:15 am and 2 big climbs in the morning with total elevation change of 2000 feet.  Met a few north bounders but pretty quiet on the trail.  Big goal today is to get to Reid’s gap and catch a ride to Devils Backbone Brewery for camping and dinner.  Got to Reid’s gap around 4:00 pm and got a ride right away.  Checked in and set up my tent, got a shower, and a great meal, and a few beers. I will definitely sleep well tonight.","Paul Wolfe Shelter

Eagle Wings,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639854,"Packed up my gear and took it over to the brewery for breakfast at 7:00 am.  Had 2 eggs, ham, hash browns, biscuit, and coffee.  Sat with nice couple from New Jersey thru hiking the trail.  When finished I went to the main road and got a hitch to Reid’s Gap.  Had a big climb over Three Ridges and steep downhill hike to next shelter.  I decided I needed to rest my knees and prepare for tomorrow’s climb of The Priest.  I shared camp with several section hikers (One Croc, Yogi, and Booboo) going to Harpers Ferry.  Also shared camp with Shutterbug from FL.  Got plenty of rest before going to bed.  Big day tomorrow.","Reid’s Gap

Eagle Wings,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639855,"Left camp at 0715 and had a 4 mile hike to get to the base of The Priest.  Took a long rest, ate, and filled up with water for the long climb ahead,  started climb at 0930 and completed at 1245.  3100 feet elevation gain over 4 miles and numerous rest stops.  At summit I continued to The Priest Shelter and ate lunch and took a nap.  1445 I started the next 6+ miles to my next shelter.  I stopped at Spy Rock and got some great views of the area.  Reached camp at 1830 and cleaned up and ate.  Shared camp with Calidiscope.  I will sleep well tonight I hope.","Harpers Creek Shelter

Eagle Wings,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639856,"Did not sleep well and feeling poorly.  Left camp at 0730 and hiked to Salt Log Gap.  Knees and toes hurting and finding water is difficult.  I need to get to Buena Vista to resupply and I have 10+ miles with (3) 500+ feet elevation gains before I can get to town.  At the Salt log gap the dirt road was well traveled and I was able to flag down several cars for directions and options.  I decided it was better to take the dirt road to a main road and get into town without hiking the rest of the trail today.  I did get a ride into Buena Vista from a nice couple from New York who were avid bird watchers.  I stopped at the Buena Vista Visitor Center and waited for Susan to pick me up and take me home for some rest.  The lady at the Visitor Center was very supportive and let me clean up, held my gear while getting lunch, and giving me a comfortable space to wait for Susan.  Susan picked me up at 1500 and we returned home.  More to follow once I get some rest.","Seeley-Woolworth Shelter
