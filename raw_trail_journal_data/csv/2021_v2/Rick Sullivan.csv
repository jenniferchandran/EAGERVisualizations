Rick Sullivan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637469,"I am not an ultra-light backpacker.

Rick Sullivan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637784,"I got my first taste of the Smokies over 55 years ago and can't get them out of my soul. I moved to NC 40 years ago and have loved spending that time hiking all over the state, but especially in the mountains. When I was 17, I saw the Whites of NH for the first time and knew that someday I would be back to really spend some time there.Â 
I want to hike SOBO because I want so badly to see mountains that I've never seen before. I want to start off slow (have to at my age) and enjoy New England to the fullest. I want to be able to focus on the beauty around me instead of having my focus always being drawn to the end point of Katahdin. Having been toughened by the hardest part of the trail, I hope to be able to ""cruise"" through the Mid-Atlantic as Fall in the Southern Appalachians draws me home to its familiar peaks and ridges.
Daniel and I are starting our thru-hike in Maine in June of '21 (with the flies). Even though we'll be hiking 2200 miles together, neither one of us likes crowds. So we'll be going SOBO.",,View Entry,"May 24, Mon",0
Rick Sullivan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638996,"One week from today, Daniel and I should be summiting Katahdin in Maine to begin our AT journey. The Weather Underground forecast for Millinocket, ME, is looking good right now for next Thursday. Hope it holds!

We'll fly into Bangor on Tuesday and spend a rest day at the Appalachian Trail Lodge. They'll give us a ride into Baxter State Park Thursday morning and off we go!Â 
We spent today helping Michael (son #3) celebrate his birthday with a ten-mile hike on the Poverty Creek trails in the Jefferson National Forest near Blacksburg, VA. (picture) A thirty-minute downpour in the middle of the hike made us think we were already on the AT!Â  Daniel will then run a half-marathon with him Saturday morning as a warm-up. I think I'll just watch!
Last minute preps are almost complete. We'll finish packing when we get back to Archdale and send our first mail drops to Monson & Caratunk on Monday! I guess this is really happening!!!",,View Entry,"Jun 10, Thu",0
Rick Sullivan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639384,"Tomorrow we climb the 'Beast'. Katahdin is known as the toughest climb on the AT. Daniel and I put feet (and hands and legs and arms and knees and lungs!) to our journey tomorrow morning. Most of all we put our hearts into it. 
We will lean on each other, as well as family (especially Charlene), friends and God. Our geographical goal is Springer Mountain in north Georgia. Our chronological goal is to finish by Thanksgiving-ish, but we reserve the right to adjust that as needed. Our real goal is to enjoy this time together, this trail and the people we meet along the way, and to learn whatever lessons are in store for us. 
Day zero has been spent in Millinocket, Maine, at the AT Lodge. We got to relax and prepare for Katahdin and the 100-mile Wilderness. Special thanks to Danya and Koty (trail names Loins of Arabia and Trash Panda). They helped straighten out some backpack issues and feel better prepared. 
Now I just hope I can settle my mind enough to get some sleep! ðŸ˜¬Happy trails!

Rick Sullivan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639607,"We climbed the awesome beautiful 'beast', but I'm not sure who won. There were definitely some tense moments for me dealing with my feelings about exposed heights, but with Daniel's encouragement and God's help, I made it up and back down safely. ""I stand fearless on the cliff edge of doom."" Ps 46:2 
Day 2 we hiked 10 easy miles to Abol Bridge, but Katahdin had taken it's toll on my legs. We've decided to take an early zero day to recover before tackling the '100 Mile Wilderness'. Abol Bridge campground has a store to get an extra day of food so we don't have to worry about making our food stretch an extra day. We will be getting a food drop in the middle of the '100 Mile' so we don't have to carry 9 (or 10) days of food. 

To any aspiring SOBOs, I highly recommend planning a recovery day after Katahdin. Even Daniel, who runs every day and just ran a half-marathon, is sore.

Rick Sullivan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640137,"Apologies for the lack of posts to my journal. Being a ""wilderness"" there wasn't much Internet access. Also my phone died due to the fact it won't take a charge any more after sliding into a creek. It did last to Monson and then promptly died after ordering a new one. It'll probably be at least 10 days before i have one again. 

Quick summary of the last 11 days we spent hiking: hard but beautiful. Definitely wasn't physically prepared to carry an almost 40-lb pack up and down mountains over more rocks and roots than I've ever seen. By the grace of God and Daniel and with the help of food drops by the AT Lodge and Shaw's Hiker Hostel we made it! 

We took a ""zero"" (no miles, just rest) day today at Shaw's after arriving yesterday morning. Bodies showered, clothes washed and two days worth of town food and a real bed have us ready to hit the trail tomorrow morning. 

Next town goal will be Carratunk in about four days. We're going to try to slow our pace for a bit. Might be able to update again when we get there. 

Love and Peace!","Abol Bridge (mile 15)

Rick Sullivan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640451,"We actually took five days to get to Caratunk. We've decided to take things slow while the trail is sooo hard! There were two significant mountains in this last stretch. Our shortest day (on the Fourth of July) was a 4-mile day up and over Moxie Bald Mountain. Glad it was short because we started up in a hard drizzle that turned into a cloud by the time we got elevation. There were no views at the top except cloud, so we decided to skip the extra 20-ft climb to the very top. We could barely see the rock cairn and sign at the summit from 200 feet away! The next day fortunately was clear as we had a 9-mile day over all the peaks of the Pleasant Pond Mountain ridge. Next stop Stratton, ME, in about five days. Hopefully I'll pick up my new phone there and be able to start sharing pictures!","Monson (mile 115)

Rick Sullivan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640808,"The Bigelow's are a mountain with two peaks at about 4100 feet. They are the first 4000-ft peaks we've climbed since Katahdin (over 5200'). They both have a beautiful alpine zone at the top that give 360 degree views. Unfortunately no pictures since I didn't get my new phone until today. 
(That means I'll finally get to start posting pictures to my journal. I've added a couple from our first day to the photos section. I'll be adding more as I can.) 

Our first day out of Caratunk was a short one. We hiked only four miles along Pierce Pond Stream. It's a beautiful mountain stream with numerous cacades and waterfalls. We took a very short detour to Harrison's Pierce Pond Camp. It's a traditional, semi-historical, Maine sporting camp. (Franklin Roosevelt's daughter stayed there on a fishing trip.) It's been run by Tim Harrison for maybe twenty years. Tim goes out of his way to show kindness to hikers. The camp is most known to hikers for the 12-pancake breakfast he serves! 

Daniel and I were his only overnight guests, but we were joined in the morning for breakfast by three other hikers who were camping nearby. Our cabin was rustic but comfortable. A single room with two double beds that had a wood stove for heat and a kerosene lantern as it's only light. 

It was wonderful and relaxing. The lodge has a pool table and we played a couple of games. The best part though was a beautiful view of the stream and a waterfall. 

More 4000 foot peaks tomorrow!","Caratunk (mile 151)

Rick Sullivan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640847,"We saw our first moose! We were being driven to the trailhead this morning after a fantastic stay at the Maine Roadhouse. Sue, our driver, saw it off the road and turned around so we could see it. I know we didn't technically see it from the trail, but it still counts! Right? 
We hiked over the two peaks of Crocker Mountain today. Much of it done in a cool, windy, drizzling rain. But it never got the trail wet and stopped completely as we descended the far side of the 4168' mountain. 

We're camping at the Crocker Cirque, which is a bowl-shaped valley formed by a glacier. (see in photos) It has a swampy pond that could be a perfect place to sight a moose for real!","Stratton (mile 188)

Rick Sullivan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641001,"Wednesday started off a little wet after an overnight rain. We had a long, hard and sometimes a bit scary climb up Sugarloaf Mountain. Sugarloaf is the second tallest mountain in Maine and home to a big ski resort. The AT doesn't go all the way to the summit, but you can take a side trail to the actual summit. We decided to skip it since all we would be able to see would be the inside of a cloud. And we didn't want to add a half-mile climb! Little did we know we would get to the summit later that night.We continued along the ridge and went up and over Spaulding Mtn heading for our destination for the day, the Spaulding Mtn Lean-to. Just before 1:00pm, about a half-mile from the lean-to, my foot slipped on a wet rock. Trying to stop a fall, I tried planting my right foot, but it got stuck in a hole and I kept falling. When I heard and felt a snap, I thought it would be no good. When I looked at my leg and saw my foot dangling to one side, I knew it wasn't. Trying to move it brought intense pain.Fortunately, we were in an area with good cell service. Daniel called 911 and I looked at a map to find the closest road access. Unfortunately, it looked like the closest roads were 13 miles back over two mountains and a scary scramble, or 18 miles forward over three more mountains. It looked like we were more remote than we'd been in quite a while!Fortunately, the Franklin Search and Rescue knew some shortcuts. John from FSAR and Mitchell from the Eustice FD were there in just over an hour, even though they had to walk several miles of seldom used trails and bushwhack through about a hundred yards of dense undergrowth to get to us. They quickly evaluated the situation, put a splint over my boot and after a while tested to see if I could put any weight on my leg. The answer was a definite ""no""!More help was on the way. A work crew from the Appalachian Trail Conservancy was on Sugarloaf marking property boundaries in the dense woods that surround the AT. Some of them went to see if they could clear a path through the forest where John had come up.Â A team of wardens from Maine Fish and Game were on their way from Sugarloaf. (Wardens are in charge of any search and rescue effort in Maine.) Turns out there are access roads to the top of Sugarloaf for the ski lift equipment and communication towers.More people with Franklin SAR soon showed up with a litter. The plan was to carry me up to the Sugarloaf summit where pickup trucks could transport me down the mountain to a waiting ambulance. At 5:30 pm I was in the litter and on the way. The dozen or so people there would take turns carrying me back up the trail. Turns out that Daniel and I would get to the top of Sugarloaf after all!As we were progressing up the trail, more volunteers kept meeting us on the trail until we had almost thirty people helping me off the trail. It took until 11:00pm to get me to the Sugarloaf summit. From there it was a ride down the mountain to the ambulance which took me to the nearest hospital about an hour away in Farmington.Â X-rays showed that both bones in my lower leg are broken. Daniel and I are flying back to NC tomorrow and I have an appointment with an Orthopedic surgeon on Monday.It was a huge effort by a generous group of people to whom I will forever be indebted. Not intending to leave anyone out, but I would especially like to mention John, Jarrod and Sophie from Franklin Search and Rescue; Mitchell from Eustice FD; and Rachel and Adam from the ATC crew. And a big thank you to all the volunteers whose names I never learned.Daniel and I successfully hiked 200 tough Maine miles of the Appalachian Trail. We climbed Katahdin and a handful of other beautiful mountains. We camped next to roaring streams and quiet ponds. Most of all, we met so many wonderful and unique people. Our adventure will forever be a part of us. It is ends not with a whimper but a snap.","Crocker Cirque Campsite (mile 195)
