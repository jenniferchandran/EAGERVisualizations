Cap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585570,"About a zillion years ago, one of my neices asked members of the family to write down, among other things, a ""bucket list"" - and on mine was to ""hike the Appalachian Trail."" About 5 months ago my wife and I were discussing what adventures we could have in our future - and from the list we generated we have embarked on setting into motion several of them, not the least of which is the revival of my desire to hike the AT. 
After looking at many books, articles, trail journals and videos, we have taken steps to making 2019 the year to make that dream come true. 
The past few months have been spent researching and buying equipment and starting the process of getting physically ready for the challenge. 
What fun!",,View Entry,"Apr 02, Mon",0
Cap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585573,"In contemplating spending several months on the AT, I want to keep in mind my previous experience on the actual AT, which consisted of an ill-thought out ""winter break"" hike that a couple of my fraternity brothers and I conceived just prior to heading home for Christmas one year. It was agreed that we'd meet up at one of the guy's houses in Asheville and proceed into the mountains to catch the trail up near Clingmans Dome. It was January. Not surprisingly, It was cold. I don't think we even considered checking the weather forecast, but perhaps we did and then ignored it. Parking the car, we set off down the trail, heading for a shelter. The trail was snowy. Parts of the trail was iced over and we were  able to pass over only because our most experienced hiker had an ice axe of sorts. It was so cold things were - blue. We found the shelter which was a 3-sided open-faced thing that offered little, if any, protection from the cold, though it might have keep some of wind off us. We had down sleeping bags that may have been Army surplus (which usually means the Army has found them unfit for further use). We had, if I recall, one small alcohol or white gas stove that operated under pressure, but which barely operated at all under the conditions we had placed ourselves in. I think dinner consisted of warm liquid Jello. It was a very cold night and we called the hike off the next morning. The good news was no one got hurt or frost-bitten, but it was a young adult version of the kind of hike camping I did as a kid in which we all carried cans of food off into the wilderness and hoped for the best.  The winter hike seemed like a good idea back in the warm comfort of our frat house - but not so much when reality had its say.
Planning, shall we say, was lacking.
I want to avoid that my next visit to the AT.I have read many books, article, trail journals, watched numerous videos as I gather equipment and work on getting into condition to start the long walk. I want to thank all of those who have gone before and who recorded their experience so that those of us who follow have some small idea of what we are getting into.
It's on those insights of others that initial plans can be made.",,View Entry,"Apr 02, Mon",0
Cap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585577,"In reading trail journals and books about the hiking the AT (or other long trails), it seems awfully easy to get caught up in the ""ultralight"" idea.
 I think my first backpack back at the dawn of time might have weighed nearly 25 pounds empty, but now I find myself wondering if 28 pounds with all my gear and food is too much? 
Then I read about people who spend much of their hike very uncomfortable because they decided to leave out a couple of pounds of something they really could have used at some point on the trail. 
I'm convinced ""lighter is better,"" but I am pondering when that tips into an unnecessary deprivation.
For example, lots of people hike with very light sleeping pads (some of which, incidentally, are very noisy when in use by a moving human body) even though a slightly heavier pad might offer a better night's rest. Is a few ounces worth a less restful night?
It is s question to be pondered.",,View Entry,"Apr 02, Mon",0
Cap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596187,"My wife and I have been hiking locally for several months - the Triangle area has lots of great hiking trails, including a portion of the NC Mountain to Sea trail and many more. When we decided to go visit one of our daughters and her husband in Chicago last month, we planned out a route that included driving the Blue Ridge Parkway from NC to its end in VA. As we drove the Parkway, we stopped frequently to hike some of the many trails that are readily accessible from the Parkway - guided by an excellent book by Randy Johnson, Hiking the Blue Ridge Parkway, working our way slowly south to north. The nice thing about having the book is that many of the trails are not obvious from the Parkway so it was great hiking into see waterfalls and vistas we would never have found on our own. Having the book also helped us stay on the right path in places where there were many choices. We would use a cell phone to grab a picture of the pages where were planning to hike and it saved a lot of steps. The AT parallels the Parkway for some distance and we met some thru-hikers in our travels. On the way back home we drove down into Kentucky and stayed at the Cumberland Falls State Park Lodge, then hiked along the Cumberland River to view the main falls (""the Niagara of the South"") as well as Eagle Falls. We then traveled to Hot Springs, NC, and spent the night at Laughing Heart Lodge (not the hostel part, but the main house) after my wife partook of the hot springs (I don't like soaking in hot water that much - I am always reminded of lobsters being cooked). Next day we hike a portion of the AT up to Lovers Leap, visited Bluff Mountain Outfitters, ate at Spring Creek Tavern. Met some thru and section hikers on the trail, then headed back home. Good way to break up a long road trip and try out some new gear, too.",,View Entry,"Jul 04, Wed",0
Cap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604732,"Met up with Clingman and we set off from Waterville School Road off I-40 to Max Patch. Our primary purpose was to test out our gear under trail conditions. While our initial plan was to hike further to Hot Springs, we decided to call it off sooner at Max Patch. Looking at the crowds at Max Patch when we got there and the weather as we thought it would be, it was the right decision.Most of Clingman's gear seemed to work fine. Mine gear worked well, but I had difficulty getting my pack properly aligned - not the pack's fault but something in the way I loaded it up. As a result I struggled along after the first couple of miles until arrival at the Groundhog Creek shelter. By struggled I mean I was not comfortable at all with the way the pack was riding and I was stopping frequently to try to sort it out (probably stopped 5 times on the trail to attempt to repack). Clingman was feeling my pain, describing my walk during that period as, ""You look like a zombie.""  I eventually got to the shelter, having told Clingman to proceed without me, so he was well ahead of me.
I was warmly greeted by the 3 people at Groundhog Creek shelter who were wondering if I would make in at all. I got there,  set up my tent, ate dinner, got some sleep. Rain started about midnight and lasted into the morning, causing us to get off to a late start. Repacked my pack again that morning and, lo and behold, once I put it on, it felt great. 
By taking it slowly and carefully until I got to the shelter, I had suffered no lasting injury despite my ""zombie"" walk and was able to hike normally with the balanced pack.
Clingman and I made good time on trail up to Max Patch from the shelter. 
Yes, it was a short trip, but held some valuable lessons you can only learn from mistakes. 
The importance of having your pack loaded correctly was driven home rather hard.
The good news is that all equipment I have worked well (even the pack once I got it right). 
There are a number of tweaks I will make.  
Clingman had some gear I admired like his CNOC Vecto dirty water bag with a really nice wide opening (I just ordered one). I will be shifting to a quilt system for the moderate weather I mostly expect on the flip flop, saving the mummy bag for the times and places where it might be more appropriate. I really like the bag, it was just a little more than needed for the conditions we were under. Clingman also had a couple of water bottle mesh holders that attached to his main pack straps - I've got those on order, too, because I am not flexible enough to reach the bottles in their pack side holders and don't want to have to take off my pack every time I want a drink or rely on someone else to help re-holster them. Because of the rain, I got to use my Frogg Toggs poncho and really liked that, unlike my rain gear, any perspiration under the poncho was due to effort and not because of the inability of my gear to breathe. My Wrightsocks are wonderful, I have worn them soaking wet and never had a blister. Back in the days when I was running marathons, I would have loved to have them. My Tarptent DW set up quickly and stayed dry during the rain. The 2 vestibules were very handy. I will add some sort of pad to kneel on before getting into the tent. Loving my Pacerpoles.
While I have been working to get my gear down to minimal weight, my main focus now is to get my body weight down and my upper body strength up. Just like training for a marathon, I have a 6 month plan to have it all come together. 
There will more trials before I hit the trail. 
I want to thank Clingman and his wife for their hospitality. 
And Clingman for being a good hiking partner.",,View Entry,"Oct 22, Mon",0

Half recalled lines of poetry bubble up  “ And time yet for a hundred indecisions, And for a hundred visions and revisions...” Mainly I am focused on getting light. Light in the pack and lighter on my feet. There is humor in worrying over an extra ounce in the pack when the more pressing need is to unpack some “table muscle”  as one of my long ago baseball coaches named it. Trying to get some trail miles locally.

There was also a nice presentation on food prep, especially dehydrated food. Blew off sessions on appreciating nature and on women on the trail. Stayed around the ATC for a while then came back to the hostel to wash clothes to at least start the trail clean, temporarily. Big day tomorrow. We walked about 9 miles today, some of it on the AT.

Because we’re trying to start slowly to work on trail legs for a few weeks we are taking it relatively easy. Settled in to Crampton shelter early but agreed we all were done for the day.

Wasn’t unpleasant, but he was persistent.


 Today has been warm but very nice. We are getting spoiled, we know it’s not going to last. The early rocks we’ve done are of the ankle turning variety. As one south bound hiker described the rocks on the trail as “Maryland trying to be Pennsylvania!”


Now staying at Dahlgren State Park near Boonesboro, Maryland which has hot shower, real toilets and fresh water at hand. 


Continuing to be slow but steady as we work on getting trail legs. Did about 8 miles today. Younger hikers are covering more ground and pass us regularly, but we have a plan we're sticking to.

Another roughly 7 mile passage with some interesting ups and downs coupled with some nice relatively flat passes. Visited the George Washington Memorial, kind of conical tower originally built by locals in a couple of days from nearby stones. It’s been restored a couple of times and is again fixed. Had some part in the Civil War. We’re very close to Antietam battlefield and as we progress north we’ll also near Gettysburg. 
Crossed over I70 on a footbridge and some folks waved from their cars. We’ve seen a lot of locals out using the trail. A horticultural club of some sort passed by a told us where to spot some blue bells. Don’t recall that I’ve seen them before. Also spotted some jack-in-the-pulpit and some lupine. Spotted our first deer. 
Keep meeting many nice people on the trail, all happy to be out in nature. 
I hope we’re seeing a little progress in getting trail legs, but to keep to our plan and try to limit things to 10% per week. Ideally, we need to average about 15 miles per day but we should pick up miles later to get us there.","Dahlgren State Backpacker Park

Cap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612323,"Jammed two days of planned hiking into one day because of concern for severe weather. As a result I am now warm, dry, showered, with freshly laundered clothes and in single room in a Days Inn In Waynesboro, PA. 
After leaving Annapolis Rocks, we hiked to near Smithsburg, MD, where Clingman and I resupplied at the Dollar General. Got lunch at a nice deli. Luckily got rides from the Trail to town and back. Woody has taken off early from Annapolis Rocks to chase down some boots that his wife mailed to Waynesboro. Clingman and I camped at Ensign Cowall Shelter which is nice but seemed to be close to a shooting range. The gunfire stopped a little before dark, so that was good. Heard some wild turkeys who seem unbothered by the shootout. When we awoke and began hiking our idea was to go to Raven Rock Shelter. Tough but pretty hike.
We got to our intended shelter at 1130am and decided not to waste the day sitting around especially in light of the weather concern. Turned into a day of ""fun with rocks"" as we had some interesting ascents and descents. Hikers call Pennsylvania ""Rocksylvania"" so I suppose it get worse in a couple of days.
Hiked into PennMar Park, a nice picnic park and got shuttle driver to take us to Waynesboro about 5 miles away.
We probably will head out tomorrow morning but won't decide until breakfast (free at the motel). This is a welcome break. Lots of hikers here in town and all seem delighted to be here. Especially since we're having thunderstorms right now.","Ensign Cowall Shelter

Cap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612397,"Left Waynesboro about 1030, hiked a fast paced 8.5 miles to Tumbling Run Shelter where we set up tents expecting some rain tonight. Nice Shelter with new privy with some humorous touches, including a door bell.  


Tent sites are gravely but reasonably level. Trail today was relatively easy so we made good time. Beginning to hike at our own speeds and catch up with each other at water sources, road crossings, and shelters. “Hike your own hike” as the AT saying goes. I’m slow on downhills but can charge the uphills - at least for short distances. 


Crossed the Mason Dixon line and entered Pennsylvania on the Trail instead of by shuttle. Thus, we have now completed one state (Maryland) out of the 14 that host parts of the AT.","PennMar Park

Cap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612568,"10 miles today in the rain after a very rainy night. Tent is wet, pack is wet, but thanks to plastic bag lining my pack, I have dry clothes and other things. The food inside my bear bag is also protected by a plastic bag that allegedly seals in odors so bears and other critters won't be attracted to the bag. 
The bear bags are hung from bear poles which are much taller than a bear can reach or placed into secure bear boxes or tied to a tree. Bears have learned that food is easily obtainable if hikers get careless. If a bear gets too unafraid of people then it will be killed. They used to relocate them, but that didn't work, and the bears kept reappearing in their old haunts.
After the long hike, added a couple more miles looking into camping at a state park near Fayetteville, PA,  Caledonia State Park. They wanted $30 for a primitive site. Found a hostel instead for $22. Now showered, with clean clothes and dry because it's still raining outside. 
Trail was flooded in large sections on the uphills, downhills, and in between. You just keep pushing through.","Tumbling Run Shelter 
",Caledonia State Park ,"May 05, Sun",10
Cap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613289,"Long catch up post follows:
Somewhere during the long hike from Tumbling Run Shelter to Caledonia State Park I did some sort of awkward trip/step thing that caused me to strain my left Achilles tendon. Conditions were rainy, the trail was muddy, rocks abounded, and there were adventures with corduroy log sections through the sucking mud of low places. 
As previously noted, we ended up spending the night in a hostel. 
My tendon was a little sore, but the next day we climbed out of the Caledonia Park area and headed on another 10 or so trail miles to a good shelter at Birch Run. I was trying to take it easy and keep my feet pointed straight, but still dinged the tendon a couple of time on the way. 
Birch Run was a very nice shelter with a pleasant stream flowing nearby. I set my tent up and soaked my feet and ankles in the cool water of the stream, which helped. I took some aspirin and acetaminophen which helped reduce swelling and numb any pain. Slept well, and was comfortable under my quilt, even though some of the other hikers at the shelter found the night to be cold. In the morning I soaked my feet and ankles again, took more of the aspirin/acetaminophen and prepared for the next 10 miles segment to Pine Grove Furnace State Park. My normal stride was shortened by concern for my tendon and I also reduced my speed, so I arrived at the general store near the Park after everyone else in our little travel group of 6 (Clingman, me, Greyhound, Rabbit, Chop, and Treadmill) that formed up at the hostel in Fayetteville. The hostel by the Park was closed on Tuesdays, so we set up tents in the Park, which provided us with nice clean restrooms, showers, and water. A retired Marine and his wife kindly gave me some ice, so I was able to ice my tendon that night. The plan for Wednesday was to do a short 6 mile hike to the next shelter which I was looking forward to as a chance to rest my tendon. 
However, that plan changed en route as we were concerned about incoming bad weather. As I was far behind the others in my group, I did not learn of the change in plans until I arrived at the proposed shelter, which was, as it turned out, sort of a dismal place. The new plan was to stay in commercial ""camp"" about 4 1/2 miles down the trail. So, after a brief rest at the shelter, I set out in pursuit of the promise of pizza and a dry place to sleep, arriving at the ""camp"" about 2 1/2 hours later. Along the way I was passed by OTB who offered me encouragement and then zipped off with song on his lips. The camp turned out to be an bit of Americana - it was full of semi-permanently set up travel trailers obviously used by their owners as weekend and vacation get-a-ways. It features a pool, a fishing pond, a laundry, showers, playgrounds and other amenities. A resort of sorts, I suppose. 
All 6 of us stayed in a rental trailer. I took a shower at the camp shared facility. Clingman had purchased some ice for me, so I was able to ice the tendon. We ate pizza for dinner and breakfast.
After breakfast I hobbled alongside Clingman to get back on the trail - for the 8 miles to Boiling Springs, PA jaunt. After a mile or so, he soon was outpacing me and took off with Rabbit, one of the faster of the 6 of us. I was trailing Treadmill, and Greyhound (Rabbit's husband) and Chop were trailing me. There were a couple of interesting uphill sections, then we hit the Rock Maze which required some twisting, climbing, and thinking to negotiate. Treadmill and I got through it together, followed shortly thereafter by Chop and Greyhound. After that it was the usual rocky ups and downs. Chop reported he had taken a tumble but was mostly uninjured (some stiffness set in later). I was walking behind Greyhound when he took a fall, again without injury. It just points out how easy is to make a misstep on the trail that could result in injury. Greyhound, Chop and I stayed in a loose column for the rest of the leg into Boiling Springs.
The rain we had been trying to beat arrived. 
A couple of miles outside of town we hit open fields with paths mowed in them for the AT hikers. With all the rain, these paths were very sloppy with mud. My tendon was barking at me. Eventually, we made into town and to the Appalachian Trail Mid-Atlantic Center, which was closed, (naturally) but which at least provided a porch for us to get in out of the rain. Our trail group began to disperse. Chop went off with a friend, Clingman was picked up by Terry, an acquaintance from a hike he and Woody made several months ago. I think I forgot to mention that Woody had moved out ahead of us, by-passed staying at Pine Grove Furnace State Park, got into Boiling Springs a day ahead of us and rented a car and went home. I enjoyed hiking with him and regretted that he felt the timing was not good for him to continue the hike. Rabbit, Greyhound, and Treadmill went off to look for motel to take a zero day. 
As for me, I had been thinking hard since the tendon injury occurred about what to do. My National Outdoor Leadership School Medical Guide discusses Achilles tendon strains and recommends reducing the activity which caused the issue. My instinct was to take a zero day (a day off) or two and then get out there again. My self-knowledge  knew I would probably push too hard and either re-injure the tendon or, as is possible, make matters in my left leg worse. I continued the debate right up to the point when I reached the ATC Center. Finally, I think common-sense prevailed and I reserved a car from Enterprise and had them pick me up. I told Clingman I thought I would take two weeks off (unless things didn't get better) then meet up with him at a town down the road.  If things didn't heal, then I would follow medical advice. 
So, I left the AT, at least for now. 
A simple misstep is all it took.
But there is this- when OTB passed me, he said he was finishing the AT after he got injured last year and had to go home. That was inspiring. You can come back. The Trail will be there.
So the AT and I are not done yet. It may be I'll go out and finish this Flip-Flop. It may be that there will be more 100 mile section hikes. But I'm not giving up. And I'll come back stronger and smarter.","Fayetteville, PA

Cap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615355,"Still at home recovering from the Achilles’ tendon strain. Recovery is going well, but these things take time. As I look forward, it’s evident that it’s necessary to rethink my trail plan. By the time my 6 week recovery period is over (another 3 weeks), I will need to spend time regaining (or perhaps gaining) lost or missing fitness. By the time I’ll be trail ready, the window to do a thru hike this year is too small for comfort. So, new plan - recover, work on fitness, and in a couple of months, head back to Harpers Ferry and start the “flop” portion of the flip flop, heading south to Georgia. Assuming all goes well, next year I will go back to Boiling Springs and head north toward Maine. So, no thru hiker will I be this year, but a Section Hiker I am. The goal remains the same, to finish the AT, but the approach has shifted to one that offers more flexibility to me. For my Flip Flop cohort that started in Harpers Ferry, I hope we can meet again as we all go SOBO, but if not, it was a pleasure and I certainly wish you all success.Happy trails!",,View Entry,"Jun 03, Mon",0
Cap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620643,"Pretty much recovered from the minor ankle and hamstring things that have been bothering me and which caused me to become a Section hiker. I would say a “LASH” (Long A**ed Section Hiker) but that remains to be proven. Losing the weight put on since I came off the trail and, I hope, a bit more. I’m pretty sure that if one did little else to get ready for a long hike, being at your proper weight to start with would go a long way in reducing the stress on joints and muscles where injuries take so many people off the trail. That being said, I won’t be at my ideal weight when Woody and I restart on September 4 from Harpers Ferry southbound, but hope to be within striking distance of it. No diet like the hiking diet, though. My motto for the restart is “slow down” - part of the challenge is taking your time, not trying to win a race with unknown others. Sometimes I need to bank my competitive fires and just take a walk in the woods. As noted before, the trail isn’t running away from the hiker, it is there for any pace.
Woody and I will meet in HF on 9/3 and set out the next day. I know we’ll be visiting the Roller Coaster Section early on, so there will be some grinding early. Slow and steady, slow and steady.
I am altering my equipment for this new start. Keeping my Tarptent Moment DW but using a Hyperlite Mountain Gear (HMG) 2400 Wind Rider, various HMG pods and stuff sacks to organize my pack, and going with a Zenbivy bed sleep system to start with. The HMG stuff is pretty much watertight- which seems pretty essential on the AT where it rains  - frequently. 
Taking a Helinox Zero chair, too, sometimes that extra pound is worth it. Tried it out on a recent camping hike with my wife and it was so nice to have a the end of a day’s hike that we were having sharing issues (so we soon will own another one and sharing won’t be an issue).
Thinking a base weight of about 15 to 18 pounds and a trail weight of 25 or so. 
 In addition to my freeze dried meals will be carrying Greenbelly bars and some new Greenbelly Mud Meals. Really enjoyed the bars on the earlier section hike north out of HF. Very filling and full of good stuff instead of pure carbs. Tasty, too.
No plan long survives contact with the Trail, though, so being prepared to adjust is also part of the plan.

Wednesday we hit the trail which begins with a noisy walk across the Shenandoah Bridge then steep climb up to Loudon Heights to get the blood flowing. Once on the ridge line it went smoothly to the David Lesser Shelter. Nice shelter, terrible path to the water source. I had my first trail fall trying to cross a rock patch while carrying water bottles, filter, and CNOC bag. A couple of scrapes, but a reminder to be careful. Thursday saw us moving along to Bears Den Hostel, a interesting mini castle with great grounds. We did drop by the Blackburn Center en en route, and entered the Roller Coaster section of the trail. Scary crossing of VA Hwy 7 four lanes of heavy traffic at the time of day we crossed,  Friday we ended up camping beside stream at Ashby Hollow. Water aplenty, but no other amenities. Saturday we finished the Roller Coaster (yes it’s hard), then went to Rod Hollow Shelter for lunch and expecting to find water. The spring was but a trickle. We pressed on expecting to find water at the reported sources. Nope. Finally, made it to Sky Meadows State Park and raced downhill to register for the night. A kindly ranger picked us up and delivered us to the sign in place just in time. We guzzled water there and refilled our bottles. The same kind ranger gave us lift up to our camp area. We settled in , ate dinner and pondered whether water scarcity is going to continue to be an issue as we proceed. Today’s hike took us out of park (thanks again to the ranger who helped us out and to the other very nice park people). Planning a short day, we dropped in on Whiskey Hollow Shelter which was nice but had only a trickle of water. Hiked another 4.7 miles to Manassas Gap Shelter which has an excellent cool water piped spring. Ah! Woody hikes faster than I, so we plan where we’ll meet. I dawdle along and take extra care on the downhills to take care of my knees. Tomorrow we’ll try to get into Front Royal and resupply, rest, and eat real food while enjoying the luxury of motel life.Miles are total since we left Harpers Ferry.

Cap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622729,"Spent uncomfortable night tenting at Manassas Gap Shelter which had the sole redeeming feature of a good piped spring. Otherwise, well, it was attempting to sleep on rocky sloping ground while it was muggy, abused by nearby noisy (trains, planes, and trucks, oh my!). Not much sleep was had. The 0530 train rumble and horn blowing was the final straw for me. Got up, packed up, made some coffee and Woody and I got off to an early start. We alternated taking the lead to catch a face full of spider webs. It’s not much, but you find your own fun. Made about 5 miles to the Denton Shelter which was - majestic- nice spring, great benches, and shower which both Woody and I took advantage of during our “lunch break.” Suitably refreshed, we hiked another 5 miles to get a ride into Front Royal. Along the way, I ran across Mama Bear and 2 cubs. We were all startled. I backed up the trail and began whistling so the Mama knew where I was. Eventually, the trio ran onto the trail and raced off ahead of me. After a spell, still whistling, I followed in their wake. Rounding a curve I again spotted a cub in the woods beside the trail looking as if he was about to climb a tree. Saw Mama up on a ridge looking down at me. She then went up the hill and the cubs trailed behind. They went right, the Trail went left and I was trying to rapidly increase our separation. Never in the right place and time to get a good picture, though. After that plugged along to a flat trail section along a creek. Out of nowhere a wasp bit me on the back of my left knee, a most unkind act on his part I thought. Shortly thereafter caught up with Woody who not seen any bears but had been bitten by several wasps in that same area. Forward we went, hitched a ride into town and got rooms at the Quality Inn.

Cap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623152,"Woody and I continued hiking in Shenandoah National Park, covering about 10 miles a day. Spent another night camping in tents off the trail after visiting Gravel Springs Hut, Elkwallow Wayside and Grill (great cheeseburger, tons of fries, cold Gatorade, potable water). It rained and we moved on to Pass Mountain Hut, hiking in the rain and mist. It was notably cooler and when we arrived at the hut, we switched to dry clothes, hung up our wet stuff in the vain hope it would dry out and tried to establish communications with the outside world. Some things got through, but most didn't. I had asked my wife to check with her cousin Mac in Staunton to see if he was available to pick us up if needed and the reply was ""yes"" but I couldn't directly get contact with him. We decided to come off the trail at US 211, about 1.7 miles from the Hut, so we knew we didn't need all the food we had. Most of this we gave to hungry SOBOs who dropped in at the shelter to rest up, water up, and eat up. The appetites of these young people was amazing. One young man ate two mashed potato packages (4 ""servings"" each) plus jerky and more then headed out into the rain to hike another 4 miles to the next Hut. In any event, we substantially lightened our load by feeding these Thru Hikers. Another young man showed up and set up his hammock to spend the night, He was doing his version of a flip-flop by hiking south out of Harpers Ferry this year and planning to hike north from there next year. Good luck to him.
After a chilly night, we packed up and moved out in time to arrive at the Panorama Parking lot above US211 by 0900. I was able to contact my wife's cousin and he kindly came and picked us up, took us to Staunton, allowed us to clean up. We helped him pack up some ""disaster relief buckets"" that his church was getting ready to send out - probably to the Caribbean. We went out to dinner (oh, we had excellent street tacos in Staunton for lunch) and got a great tour of this wonderful small city, Then we drove over to Charlottesville to put Woody on a train home. I spend the night in Staunton and cousin Mac and I drove down to Raleigh the next morning, had lunch and Mac went over to visit his son's family in Durham. He then drove back to Staunton that evening. The guy is an Energizer Bunny.
Lots of lessons learned, some of which may appear in a YouTube video I'm planning on ""how to hike if you are over 65"" - but it was a good hike, Woody was a good companion. The nice thing about being a section hiker is that when you decide you've had enough or that hiking more may exacerbate some injury, you can pull the plug on the hike and go home to prepare for another section. It takes the pressure off in trying to go too far too fast. One problem is trying to get or maintain ""trail legs"" while not on the trail, there were several days when the last mile of the hike felt like mile 25 of a marathon. Woody was ahead of me in this area, my leg issues resolved too late to get up to some semblance of necessary fitness. Happily, Woody was patient and I was able to plod along at my own slow pace (by the way, downhills suck if you don't have much cartilage in your old knees). Truly, hike your own hike. Trying to keep up with younger hikers is the road to ruin.
Until the next section, be well.","Stealth Camp near Jenkins Gap

Cap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624377,"After careful consideration, my 2019 AT section hiking season has come to an end and prepping for the 2020 season begins.  What follows are a few thoughts from the AT. Bear in mind I have done less than 10% of the AT, so if you read this, you can take what I say knowing I have not hiked every mile. Your views may vary, and I welcome feedback from more experienced hikers.
If you read through my entries, you will know that I am now a section hiker, due to an injury sustained while hiking that caused me to leave the trail. I greatly admire those with the desire and will to complete a thru hike but, for me, doing the AT in bursts makes sense. I have enjoyed most of my miles on the AT, some more than others. After nearly 200 miles of AT hiking, I have some ideas on how to better prep for the AT. Some of these thoughts may apply to hikers of any age, others are specially directed to hikers of a more mature age - older hikers face different challenges than do people in their 20's, and that's something to be kept in mind.
One of the first questions that I should have asked myself was, ""Why do I want to thru hike?"" Challenge? Glory? ""Because it's there?"" ""Lifetime dream?"" ""Bucket list checkoff?""
 And the second question should have been, ""What happens if I can't do finish a thru hike?"" ""What are my alternatives?""

My initial approach to these questions was to sort of consider the first question as ""it doesn't matter"" and the second as representing a defeatist attitude, not worthy of considering. If I put my mind to it, I figured, the AT was mine for the taking. That's pretty foolish view as it turns out. 
Understand that while some 15 to 20% of those who start the AT on a thru hike finish it, many other good, even excellent hikers don’t because they get hurt along the way and these injuries can happen to anyone almost at any point. Tripping on a tree root or a rock, or falling in a rock pile, or getting sick along the way can bring that planned long hike to a sudden stop. A family emergency or financial issues can cause an abrupt need to leave the trail. Severe blisters, a broken leg or arm or finger or an infected scrape or whatever can be hike ending. Accept, before you start, that such things can happen to you and be happy in the days they don’t. Of course, some people in the larger number of those who don't finish a thru hike probably should never have started out. Not realizing what a physical and mental challenge a long hike represents, they find themselves leaving the trail pretty early in their hike. But in that large majority of hikers who leave the trail, there are no losers or wimps. They attempted a great challenge and for some reason had to stop. Many of them will attempt another thru hike. Many will become section hikers. Some will never hike again. In any of those cases, they all had to look inside themselves and that's as good a reason as any for being willing to attempt the AT. 
As I was hobbling along trying to decide whether to cut short my ""flip flop"" thru hike, I began to ponder what I had enjoyed in my few days on the AT. The answer was that I enjoyed the hiking and people. But the flip side of that was that I missed my family at home and that my years of leaving on Navy deployments made me aware that I was having trouble with the idea of putting that aspect of my life on hold while long hiking. As I was struggling along, I met a couple of hikers who opened my mind to the idea of section hiking. One was a gentleman who had suffered a torn Achilles tendon (my was strained at this point and I was trying to avoid a tear) and who, after recovery, was back on the trail doing sections as his schedule allowed. He told me that section hiking was an incentive for him to stay in shape year round and wasn't as stressful as his thru hike had been. Later I met another almost thru hiker who had left the trail due to injury and who was back filling in sections he had missed. His spirit was high and he offered up the idea that the ""trail is there when you can get back to it."" Such are the things that turn one into a section hiker.
So it is that I declared the jaunt from Harpers Ferry to Boiling Springs a ""section hike."" I added in the section from ""I-40 to Max Patch"" done as trial run as a ""section hike"" and now the stretch from Harpers Ferry to Thornton Gap. So, roughly 192 miles on the AT.
I am not the most experienced AT hiker out there - but, based on my limited experience, I have some thoughts.

When hiking that last section to Thornton Gap, Woody and I were often asked when we told people we were ""section hikers"", ""How far you going?"" To which we replied, ""Until we get hurt or tired of it."" And that's the beauty of section hiking. You give up the stress of trying to make miles to be someplace before ""they close the Park"" - and you gain the freedom to hike without time constraints (except those imposed by outside matters) and also gain the gain the time to look around as you hike. If you review what many thru hikers say they regret the most about their hike it's that they ""didn't take the time to enjoy the hike."" Section hiking may be the cure for that.
Anther good thing about being a section hiker is that between hikes you can make adjustments that will make your return to the trail better than when you left it. Section hiking allows you to appreciate that “hike your own hike” means a whole lot more than just pace and distance. It encompasses the customization and optimization of your body and your gear. It’s fine that ""Famous Hiker Y"" uses this set of poles and these socks or those shoes, and you may be tempted to follow that path. But the underlying question is not what is right for FH Y, but what is right for you.
Also, if you are an older hiker, who has had hiking the AT on the bucket list for years, you need to be realistic in your expectations. The AT is hard. It’s long and parts of it are boring and hard, parts of it are beautiful and hard. Some of it is crazy. There are bugs and it’s either hot or cold and rarely just right. As you get older, your ability to rapidly bounce back from a tough day has decreased. I found the ground is farther away than it was when I was 22 and it has gotten a lot harder. You probably shouldn’t eat the same foods the younger hikers do (really, Pop Tarts?), and they aren’t going to be carrying a month’s supply of prescription drugs with them like you are. Your knees and ankles and shoulders have done a heap more things than that recent college grad who’s doing 25 miles a day. Hike your own pace. By the way, older hikers need more water than younger hikers.
“Well,” you might be saying, “I already hike a lot and I have sorted much of this stuff out, so why are you telling me this?” Because the AT is different. Whether you are planning to hike 100 miles or 2200, the AT is different. Read the journals here. There may be a few where hiker X started out with the same gear he or she finished with (except for shoes which everyone has to replace along the way) but those are the exceptions to the rule. This is true for even experienced hikers. Why? Because most of us don’t go out and hike the “Roller Coaster” for fun or slop through submerged trails for days in a row just for the pleasure of it. Do you know if a two person tent really would be better for those days when you have to have you gear inside your tent because the world outside is a mess. How will you know if your shoes are good on wet and slippery rocks unless you’ve already tried them in such conditions? Here's some other thoughts:
1.  Lose weight before you get on the trail. Each downhill step puts 7 times you body weight on those knee joints. Going uphill you will feel every extra pound. You can lose weight on the trail and probably will, but being 20 or 30 pounds overweight makes the hike a lot harder.
1A.  Get in shape before your hike. Walking the dog around the block won't help you on steep uphills and downhills or rock scrambles. I've run 5 marathons, and the end of a 12 mile day feels just like mile 25. Try working up to a 12 miler with a full pack before you hit the trail. Make sure to include upper body strengthening as part of your exercise.
2.  Get the right shoes for your feet, which may or may not be the ones famous hiker Y uses. Make sure you've got toe box room otherwise blisters will plague you. Ankle support can be a good thing. Dry feet are happy feet, but those ""water resistant"" boots also resist letting out the water that gets in (which it will when the trail is over ankle deep in water).
3.  Use hiking poles. They help get the weight off those knees on downhills and provide stability in terrain where you might otherwise fall.
4.  Carry a light pack. If you are carrying over 25 to 30 pounds on your back, you need to get lighter. Those knees will appreciate it. Modern gear is light. Spend the money. But unless you are under 30 years old or really experienced, don't even think ultralight.
5.  Carry water. If water sources get iffy, carry more water. Running out of water can ruin your whole day.
6.  Carry extra dry socks. Don't listen to people who tell you that you only need 2 pair. Carry more. Carry more dry underwear, too. 
7.  Shoe inserts are your friends.
8.  Take your time. The trail is not in a hurry and it's not a race. Those crazy trail runners are not carrying back packs full of hiking gear.
9.  Curb your ambition. If you wonder if 15 miles is too far for the day, It is.
10. Watch your step. Roots and rocks and sticks, oh my!
11.  Try to fall on your pack. You are going to fall, so accept it.
12.  Have a good first aid kit. The nearest ER isn't that close.",,View Entry,"Oct 23, Wed",0

Cap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640209,"20 May 2021- Met up with Woody at his home in NC spent the night, drove up to near Damascus, turned in rental car and shuttled into Damascus on 21 May. Picked up Subway sandwiches and hiked off. Got about 10 miles in, camped at Saunder Shelter. 
22 May got up to Buzzard Rock (dang, that's a hard climb if you haven't any trail legs!) then got a little ""trail magic"" (Gatorade is good!) - then camped near a spring near Whitetop Mountain Road, for a 12 mile day. Good weather, albeit a little warmish. 
23 May hiked up to Thomas Knob shelter on Mt. Rogers, got water, then moved on to Rhododendron Gap, camped amongst the ponies and long horns. Short 7.5 mile day, felt much longer since so much of it was uphill - up Mt Rogers. 
24 May hiked into Grayson Highlands State Park. Rendered some first aid to a family whose children were suffering blisters (moleskin for everyone!). Then plodded on to the Scales and on further to Old Orchard Shelter. 11.6 miles. 
25 May Headed on to Trimpi Shelter, 13.8 miles. Was traveling slowly and Woody was well ahead of me. Literally staggered in shortly before dark. Was not the ""slow, short mileage"" I'd been thinking of when planning to get some trail legs and I was paying the price. 
26 May Hiked the 10 miles to Partnership Shelter, caught a ride into Marion and overnighted at the Econo Lodge. Dined on Pizza, restocked stuff at Walmart and drank a tall cold Strawberry Slush from Sonic. 
27 May shuttle to Partnership Shelter, then 11.6 miles hiked to Atkins, once again trailing Woody as his mountain legs are proving much better than my flat land legs. Spent night at Relax Inn, ate Mexican Food at nice little place located at a gas station.
 28 May Woody got off to an earlier start than I did, heading for Bear Garden Hostel near Ceres. My goodness I was slow, which resulted in me getting caught in some serious rain about 10 miles into the hike. Over the next 3 miles it was slippery and had several stiles to climb over. Managed to fall twice due to wet conditions. Finally dragged into Bear Garden Hostel much later than I had thought. Everyone at the Hostel was great, and I was treated very well. Managed to get a shower and listened to people planning various extended slack pack adventures from the hostel, but I told Woody that I had enough, and would have my wife pick up on the 29th, noting that I needed much better conditioning and even more weight loss before venturing back out on the AT. 
29 May, my wife and dog drove up and ""rescued"" me. Good news, no injuries. Did about 87 AT miles in 8 days. Woody went on for a couple more days and covered much more ground, hiking with some through hikers who had good trail legs.
Planning to go back out in the Fall, perhaps driving to Bear Garden Hostel and being shuttled northwards and hiking back to my car. Section hiking is good, but the need to get into good shape before hiking is different than doing a through hike where you can hike into your trail legs.","Damascus, VA
