Guido,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626515,"Finally, I've been looking forward to this for my entire life. The hike is still over a year away. I just need to focus on completing high school right now. I've been racking up all of my gear lately. The only thing I need is a water bladder and probably a sleeping bag that won't be too hot during the summer. On my previous hikes, I carried my 48oz Nalgene bottle which was too tall for my side pockets, so I put it in the top of my pack. I would have to take off my pack every time I needed water, so a water bladder would really help. Right now, I need to start my search for one and get it over with.",,View Entry,"Feb 29, Sat",0
Guido,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630969,"My adventure begins in 157 days. I pretty much have all of the gear I need. However, I don't think my backpack has enough space to fit everything, so I think I'll need to upgrade to a bigger pack. Right now, I have a medium-sized ULA Circuit. So, I'm thinking about upgrading to a Gossamer Gear pack, or a Large ULA Circuit. I want to use a bigger pack when I start off to store my winter gear in, but once it gets warmer, I'll downsize to my other pack. It's going to be pretty cold once I start off, and snowy most likely. My plan is to start at Amicalola on March 4th, hike for a week, and get off the trail right before Vision Quest (my church's college ministry's annual spring break retreat) if Vision Quest happens.",,View Entry,"Sep 28, Mon",0
Guido,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631924,I just registered to thru-hike the AT starting March 4th from the lodge at Amicalola Falls State Park in Northern Georgia. I also will do a shakedown hike from December 11-14 with my good friend Hopeful. I will go from Dicks Creek Gap in Georgia to Winding Stairs Gap in North Carolina. It’s about a 40 mile trip averaging about 10 miles a day. The weather will be pretty cold. I would not be surprised to see some snow fall on this trip. That’s why I just purchased some crampons for my shoes just in case. Can’t believe it’s just about three months away!,,View Entry,"Dec 01, Tue",0
Guido,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631972,"I’m currently on my way down to Georgia. I’ll be sure to keep posting and take pictures! Today I’ll be hiking eight miles from Dicks Creek Gap to Bly Gap. I’m not going to post my miles on here because I don’t want it to count towards my thru-hike. Plus, there’s no point in starting a whole new journal just for this hike. Stay tuned!",,View Entry,"Dec 11, Fri",0
Guido,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631975,"Today was a successful day! Me and my buddy Hopeful hiked roughly 8.7 miles today from Dicks Creek Gap to Bly Gap. I have officially completed all of the AT in Georgia! I’m currently in my tent as I’m typing this. I’m happy to barely have internet access here. Tomorrow is looking pretty nasty. It will start raining in the morning and will most likely continue until 11pm! I’m not super hyped about it, but it will be a learning experience for me especially for my upcoming thru-hike. I’ll be posting pictures when I get a chance. Please pray for God’s protection!

Guido,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631989,"Well it’s day two now. Me and Hopeful started the morning off with a rough climb up Couthouse Bald. I hear people say all of the time, “Once you’re in North Carolina, you’ll know it!” That was certainly true. However, we’ve already completed the toughest climbs of our trip which is very nice! We stopped at Muscrat Creek Shelter for a snack and a change of clothes because rain was expected this afternoon and pretty much for the rest of the day. But, we actually didn’t get anything! Only lots of fog. Especially on top of Standing Indian Mountain and coming down it. Finally, we made it to Beech Gap, our stop for the night. Then it began to get very foggy, now it’s finally raining . . .",,View Entry,"Dec 12, Sat",0
Guido,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631999,"On Day 3, we hiked 11.3 miles from Beech Gap to Long Branch Shelter. We had gorgeous weather that day, especially on top of Mt. Albert where the fire tower is. Unfortunately, the top of the fire tower is kept locked to protect it from vandalism, but the views were still spectacular. The picture to the left is from an overlook near Mt. Albert. I couldn't get one on Mt. Albert because my battery was running low. I was looking forward to getting a bit of extra sleep that night for the weather was supposed to be nice the next day as well. Instead, it started to rain around midnight and didn't stop until around 6:30 AM. We got an early start at 7:30 the next day and finished off the trip at about noon.       What surprised me during this trip is we followed the exact itinerary that I had originally planned out. On Day 2, we were making plans to cut it short because of rain, but it didn't rain at all even though I checked the weather the night before. I'm pretty satisfied with my gear as well. I had zero issues with my brand new Gossamer Gear tent, especially how it held up in the rain. I didn't have as much condensation in my tent unlike my old one. However, I think I'll go ahead and seam seal it before starting my thru-hike. Guido.",,View Entry,"Dec 15, Tue",0

Guido,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632544,"It's hard to believe how close the trip is getting! I depart in less than four weeks! 
For right now, it's looking pretty snowy and icy down in Georgia, especially in NC and the Smokies. However, I'm well prepared for these conditions. People ask me all the time especially at this time of year, ""Aren't you freezing?"" I like to say that I have northern roots. The cold just doesn't bother me as much as others. I live in East Tennessee, so yeah, there's a lot of southerners around here (no offense; I'm technically a southerner too). 
My friend asked me this question a couple of months ago; I think it's time to briefly answer this publicly, ""What do I want my thru-hike to look like?"" 
I've been planning this for several years, actually even before my first job. When I first came up with the idea myself, I didn't know it would come all the way to this point. I've heard many stories and met lots of great people who're connected with the AT (Appalachian Trail) who've simply inspired me to do it more than ever before. I don't think this thru-hike would've been possible if it wasn't for their advice, wisdom, prayers, fellowship, and encouragement. I am truly blessed and thankful for such friends.
My original plan for this trip a couple of years ago was to join my friend ""Circuit Rider"" However, that changed last year when all of the covid stuff hit, so he's been busy around the country on full-time ministry including a partial thru-hike with a man named Adam, and caretaking his friend's daughter. I'll be by myself after the first week on the trail. However, I'm really excited about meeting people, smiling with people, and becoming lifelong friends with people. Of course, I want to spend more time of fellowship and prayer with the Lord. I can't stress enough how much I want to serve the Lord joyfully and give glory to Him in all that I do. I also want it (and it will be) a learning and spiritual experience that I'll never forget.",,View Entry,"Feb 05, Fri",0

I weighed my pack first hand and it was around 45 lbs. This weight also counts a week’s worth of food and water. For my first week, I’ll be carrying just a couple days worth of food at a time since my father will be meeting up with at different trailheads around the area. Plus, I’m getting rid of one of my water bottles which I don’t need. I have a water bladder, but I want to save it until the warmer months just in case if the water freezes inside of it if it gets too cold out.  I’ll be sure to keep updating and adding more entries and photos.

Guido,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632927,"Finally here at Amicalola Falls State Park in Georgia to begin my (first) thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail. Got my picture at the arch behind the visitors center and starting on the Approach Trail at the lodge. If you’re not very familiar with the Appalachian Trail (AT), well the trail doesn’t just start right off the bat, you have to take the 8.8 mile long Approach Trail first. The other option is to park at the bottom of Springer Mountain (Springer Mountain is where the AT begins), and hike north about a mile to reach the top where the AT starts. However, I’d rather begin hiking the AT right on top of Springer. The Approach Trail starts at the Visitors Center at the arch, then proceeds to follow up a gigantic flight of stairs to the top of the falls. Me and my friend Hopeful easily skipped that and drove up the road to the top instead and found where the path crossed the road, so we skipped 1.1 miles and hiked the last 7.7 miles of the Approach Trail.
Me and Hopeful’s very first encounter on the trail was another thru-hiker named ASAP (always say a prayer). It wasn’t even the first mile and he was sitting on a log and looked tired already. He was a believer in Christ, so we sat down with him, prayed for a minute, talked for a couple more minutes, and left. We met another thru-hiker named Glacier. We such each other off and on. I followed and talked to him until Black Gap Shelter where he decided to keep heading north while I ate lunch. Met a very nice ridge runner and a couple section hikers at the shelter. Anyway, met quite a few people especially on top of Springer. We’re staying at a campsite just shy of Stover Creek Shelter. ASAP showed up with us there not long after arriving. We ate dinner, told stories, and headed to bed right at dark. You see, long distance hikers don’t stay up very late, especially after hiking around 11 miles today. I’m camped right next a creek, so I get some white noise in the background to help me sleep which is nice. 
Thank you for all of your prayers! I sense every one of them, must get to sleep now.","Approach Trail at Lodge

Hopeful got an earlier start then me, but I caught up to him somewhere past Three Forks. We saw a lot of people again today, although we didn’t talk a whole lot today. We hiked 11.4 miles today from Stover Creek to Justus Creek. The tent pads north of the creek were in bad shape, so we’re camped on top of an old roadbed just above the creek along with countless other people. Two of them decided to make campfires which is actually unusual out here.

Guido,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633009,"What an amazing day! I finally got a reliable signal at Gooch Gap where I talked to Dad and called up my Mom for the first time since I left. We pressed another 3.7 miles to Woody Gap where my Dad was waiting with some Oreos and Cokes and yes, the place was packed out this Saturday afternoon. I believe it was Daniel, Glacier, and (Minnesota I think) came up behind us and joined the fun. I also said hi to the Ohio Wilderness Boys Camp who were at the picnic tables above. I noticed their van parked at the Springer Parking lot a couple days ago where it had a flat tire, but they said they got it fixed and were headed to Deep Gap I think. Afterwards I pressed on and stopped for lunch on top of Big Cedar Mountain where there were several other people there including a family of three. I had an incredible view across the valley but forgot to take a picture! Me and Hopeful will have friends waiting for tomorrow at Tesnatee Gap (The Nasty Gap) who will let us spend the night in their home and feed us some steaks, potatoes, and salads! Tomorrow would have to be a 13+ mile day though, so it’s important especially for Hopeful to get some rest before we get on with our longest day yet! See ya guys!

Guido,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633040,"Last night was cold enough to build up some frost inside my tent, so we got up and got going around 7:30 without eating breakfast. I felt really sluggish today especially going up Blood Mountain (the highest point of the AT in Georgia), and heading down felt rough on my body as well. Our goal was to make it to Tesnatee Gap for my dad to pick us up and bring us to Carol & Stewart’s house, although I thought it be best to call it short today at Neels Gap. 
We were treated like family at Stewart & Carol’s tonight. They fed us a fine share of steaks, potatoes, salads, and even ice cream! Thank you Circuit Rider for reaching out to them to help us! Tonight we’ll get some sleep in a real bed and get some much needed rest.","Lance Creek

We got back to Neel’s Gap somewhere around 10:30-11 and I was feeling a lot better than yesterday. Me and Hopeful walking 5 miles to get to Tesnatee Gap and ate lunch there. Me dad was supposed to meet us there, but he was parked at the next trailhead up instead. He ended up coming down here, I stood behind the trunk which was opening, and out come these Coke cans which explode everywhere on the ground and all over me. Thankfully I was able to clean myself up. I slack-packed the next mile from Tesnatee to Hogpen Gap where my dad would have my pack for me. I met a couple named “Gone With the Wind” on top of Wildcat Mountain. Not sure where they stayed tonight, but me and Hopeful stayed at Poplar Stamp Gap, just a mile from Low Gap.

You know, your feet are the most abused part of your body, I’m not surprised that my feet are hurting especially hiking 10+ miles a day up and down across roots and rocks. I got down to Unicoi Gap and instantly put some athletic tape on which was better than nothing for the time being. Anyways, it was another good day. The campsite I’m staying at tonight is called “Cheese Factory” is because there actually used to be a cheese factory here! I forgot to mention that I switched sleeping pads.

It was another beautiful day today like it has been for the entire trip so far. No rain or snow in the 60s and 70s possibly! Well I got up this morning and double-socked so it might help with the hotspots and blisters that may be forming on my feet. I was doing just fine; cruising along the trail until good ol’ Kelly Knob gets in the way. It’s all uphills for a mile straight up there! I ate lunch halfway up, and reapplied some KT tape on my feet. Yesterday, I saw ASAP at Unicoi Gap for the first time since Neels Gap. He stayed with us last night at Cheese Factory, and I saw him coming up behind me on top of Kelly Knob. We hiked together for pretty much the rest of the day. My dad arrived at Dicks Creek about 5 minutes after I got there. He’s been shuttling hikers all over the place for the last few days. He picked up me, Hopeful, ASAP, and another hiker named Ryan. I was able to snag the last room at the Hiawassee Budget Inn, so Hopeful treated everyone out to Daniel’s Steakhouse for dinner, and now it was time to say good bye to my father and Hopeful for a while. Hopeful was just coming along for my first week and I will greatly miss him. He’s played a big part into doing this thru-hike and it won’t be the same to hike without him, but hey, I’m excited from this day forward to see what happens next.

One in particular is a trail maintainer who’s in charge of the section Plumorchard Gap and Blue Ridge Gap. He’s been doing it since 1980, so I wanted to give him a shout out! Also met a couple ladies; one from Johnson City TN (where I grew up), and one from Richmond ME, (my grandfather and family members live just south of there). My friend Ryan got a trail name finally.

ASAP and Bundles were already on the trail before I got up, so I actually didn’t get to see them at all today. Long story short, but I got to Beech Gap where I thought they’d be staying at, but I was told that they pressed on to Carver Gap. I thought it might be good to press on a few extra miles anyway, just because the chances of rain are up for tomorrow. It would make it an easier day tomorrow if it happened to rain. I hiked on until sunset where I had to get my headlamp on for the last mile. Luckily I found a place to camp for the night when I got here.

Guido,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633306,"I slept well again last night with my father’s sleeping pad. Both of my feet were hurting yesterday day again, but they were feeling great this morning!
I was just about to leave until “Go” (a guy I met at Bly Gap) asked me if I left my snacks at the campsite where I stopped to eat dinner last night. I looked through my food bag and I was missing my snacks! My friend “Woking Buffalo” (I think) later brought them back to me, so I didn’t leave my campsite until past 9:30! I’m trying to get used to the habit where if I get up somewhere after eating a snack, I must always look back where I was sitting to make sure I didn’t forget or drop anything.
Anyway, I hiked a little over two miles until my feet were bothering me again just a little. I stopped at Betty Creek Gap to grab lunch, then after sitting down and getting back up, I could really feel the pain in my feet again! Especially in the back of my left heel near the Achilles Tendon. I walked another mile almost limping until I threw down my pack in the middle of the trail and thought to myself, 
“What can I do?”
“How can I fix this?”
“Please LORD!”
I looked up “heel pain” online and got a few results. One was to avoid strenuous walking and rest for a bit, but I’m on the AT!? I’m still four miles away from my spot for the night. Another one was to use an ice pack for 15 minutes, 3 times a day. Ice packs don’t fall from the sky you know. The last remedy I remember seeing was to use a heel wedge to help with the pain. A heel wedge? I wonder if I can use anything in my pack to use as a heel wedge. First I tried my baby wipes and I don’t want to say what happened. Second, I tried my toilet paper; nope, still uncomfortable. Third, I tried my pack cover and nope as well. Then lastly, I tried my camp pillow and nope! I’ll just deal with the pain I guess. The most I can do is be careful and walk slow. I have nothing to help! I met “Freight Train” on top of Albert Mountain. He offered me a sponge to use in my foot and finally, it was comfortable enough for me to keep going. 
I got to Long Branch Shelter. I made a spectacular dinner with the dehydrated beef that Hopeful left behind, and Monterey Jack flavored mashed potatoes. I tasted almost like Shepard’s pie. Then for the first time in my entire trip so far, it actually...started....to....rain. Only rained for 5 minutes though, and nothing else throughout the night! I stayed inside the shelter for the first time on my trip because I was worried about the raining overnight, then it would’ve been miserable to pack up in the morning.

Guido,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633307,"I’m looking forward on getting to Franklin today. I need more food, I need to get my feet checked, and I have a reservation at a hostel. 
My father drove from Charlotte to pick me up today from Winding Stair Gap, and he treated me out for lunch. Our next stop was Outdoor 76, an outfitter where there’s foot specialists. The man I met inside of there (I think his name was Greg) was very on top of the situation I was having with my left heel. I think the condition I’m having is at least something similar to Retrocalcaneal Bursitis. The tissue inside my heel is inflamed, and I need to get at least 2-3 days of rest before I can get back on the trail! He also said 10 miles a day is a big one for me! I believe I can still do 10+ mile days, but I just need to be more careful and recover as most as I can before heading back out, plus I should be stretching more. It looks like I’m zeroing for the next day or two. 
Now, the pain I’m having isn’t constant. When I wake up in the morning on the trail, it feels perfect. After walking a mile or two, it starts to irritate just a little. Then, when I sit down for the first time to grab a snack and get back up, that’s when it really hurts. It doesn’t hurt when I’m walking like normally, but starts to hurt when I’m constantly walking for a long time. Especially walking uphill, downhill, on top of dirt, rocks, roots, mud etc. 
Me, the owner, and the rest of the crew at the hostel went out for some Chinese tonight. I also met a guy named Water, and we did a short Bible study tonight on Psalms 14 & 19. I’d love to hang out with him more, but I have to stay here and let my feet heal. I least I get to kick back and relax for a couple days and let my entire body heal in general. The hostel is inside this guy’s house actually. It has bunks and private rooms in the basement for hikers to stay at for a reasonable price. He’s eventually going to turn the entire house into a hostel I believe, and he’s gonna build his own log cabin to live in. Plus, he’s trying to raise money so he can thru-hike the AT next year. There’s also a couple of nice sofas in the basement plus a shower and laundry. I must now get some rest on my bunk.","Long Branch Shelter

Plus, I’m staying at a hostel so it doesn’t affect me at all! I had Zen (the hostel owner) drop me off at the pancake breakfast again. I was the only hiker to show up today! A very nice guy drove me to Ingles to grab some ibuprofen for my heel, then dropped me back off at the hostel! Shout out to him! My friend Carol came by later in the day to drop off a package that was sent to me from my family. The package contained lots of goodies including Haribo gummies, seasoned pretzel twists, an apple pie, strawberry & creme pie, a cherry pie, peanut butter M&Ms, and my hiking pants which I forgot to bring. Carol also bought a dozen doughnuts to share. I forgot one thing, my mom also stuffed my Frodo doll that I got for Christmas in there too, so now I have a new hiking partner! 
I went to Jaxon’s Downtown for dinner. I got pizza and breadsticks which I didn’t really care for. I should have just eaten the food that I already have to lessen the weight on my pack, but I’m still learning quite a few things out here.

Last week, this section of the trail was closed because they were doing controlled brush fires in the area. Throughout this entire section, the ground is black everywhere. I got to Siler Bald Shelter before noon, and this would be my place for the night. Later on, a big family from Kansas were on a road trip, and they walked up from Winding Stair to Siler Bald and they stopped at the shelter on the way back. The father gave me some beef jerky and told me good luck! I’ll be sure to try it later. More people come in the shelter later on including, Ella, Jack, Tate, Rabbit, Tate’s father, and another lady. It’s pouring down rain right now, and should be like this for the rest of the night. Hopefully tomorrow won’t be like this.","Winding Stair Gap

Guido,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633549,"It poured down rain all night. I was about to go to sleep until I felt a drip of water on my head inside the shelter. I found the spot with my headlamp, and duct-taped it. Five minutes later, I felt it again, then I decided to tape it some more, but I soon realized that it wasn’t working. So, I grabbed my Shamwow towel and taped it to the ceiling so the water wouldn’t be dripping on my head. 
When I left the shelter this morning, it was pretty hazy out, although it had stopped raining. I still wore my rain jacket throughout the entire day just in case. I forgot to take a picture of the stone tower on top of Wayah Bald, but I did get a panorama on top of the mountain. I read that it’s called “Wayah” because it’s the Cherokee word for “wolf.” I hiked down to the next shelter down there, ate lunch, and called the NOC to see if I could get a bunk there tomorrow night. They say they were full, even though there’s like 130+ bunks. Anyway, I got to Cold Spring Shelter tonight; a very old shelter built in the 1930s that holds about six people. We fit seven people in here tonight. This is my third night in a row sleeping in a shelter on the AT, only because I keep hearing that there’s chances of rain throughout the night. Plus, I hate to deal with taking down my tent in the morning with pouring down rain to go along with it. I don’t think it will rain tonight anyway, but it looks like it will be a cold night.","Siler Bald Shelter

About a foot off the floor, there is a few tiny little cracks where you can see outside of the shelter. The wind blew through those cracks all night long, so I kept my head tucked inside my sleeping bag as I slept. This morning was miserable. Walking around camp, my feet and hands were almost completely numb. Overnight, ice had formed on the tree branches, so as the weather started to heat up, the ice would fall from the trees almost like hail while I was hiking. I only got a couple of them fall down my back, but the trail wasn’t slippery or anything.I got down to Tellico Gap at around 10:15AM, and met a couple people who rented that night. Somebody had messaged me on this website that they wanted to do some “trail magic” for me at noon. I was there a little too early but I stayed for about 30 minutes then left. I was wanting to do some big miles today, but I didn’t want to wait another hour and a half for them to get there. Plus, I wasn’t sure if they were coming or not. I walked about a tenth of a mile and I thought about it for a minute, and I turned back and decided to wait instead. Five minutes later, they show up! They bring cookies, fruit, and a piece of pie from Sunset’s Restaurant which I had the other night. Very nice people (Smokey Mountain Dew and Sunny Beach!)Long story short, I got down to the NOC (Nantahala Outdoor Center) and was wanting to get a burger at the River’s End restaurant. The website says it costs $12 for one which is out of my price zone. Plus, I’ve been spending too much money recently anyway. I didn’t go inside the center or anything. I stayed for about 5 minutes outside and took a couple of pictures, and that’s all. I walked up to the trail sign and it said 6.9 miles to the next shelter. I’ve already done 11.5 today, and I have nowhere else to stay. The bunks tonight were full at the NOC, so my only options were to find a campsite with a nearby water source, or night-hike to Sassafras Gap Shelter. It was already 4:30, I found a flat spot to eat dinner, and off I went. I got to the side-trail for the shelter around 9:30 at night and camped on a little hill above it. I did 18.6 miles today!

We planned to meet at Stecoah Gap around 2PM and we would go out to eat and spend the night at one of their houses nearby. They have at least three houses: one in Cleveland, GA (which is the one I stayed at a couple weeks ago), one near Stecoah Gap, and one in Blairsville, GA. The house has a water problem, so I couldn’t use the shower, sink, or the toilet. The toilet had enough water for me to flush just one time and that’s it! But still, they treated me out to Mexican for lunch, and bought me a frozen pizza for dinner! In return for all of their generosity, and bought some Virgil’s Cream Soda for at least Carol to enjoy. Tonight, I watched a movie by myself called “The Last of the Mohawkin” I think. They were some DVDs in the room so why not? It’s midnight now, and I’ve got to get some sleep.

There was a guy named Tristan Smith grilling some burgers and hot dogs for the crew down there this afternoon! I also met a guy named “McGyver” who is actually in charge of the elevation profile for the AT Guide (he’s listed in the book). I told him that I like maps so he pulls out a 10-foot long custom map of the AT! The map also has details of your thru-hike if you want it that way. It would cost quite a bit to make one, but it will definitely be worth once I get finished! I finally got back on the trail around 12:30 I think. I’ve been dealing with some blisters on my right heel, but the most I can do is put some tape around it, wear an extra sock, and try not to mess around with it as best as I can. There’s a big climb coming out of Stecoah Gap about a mile north called “Jacob’s Ladder.” Boy that was a tough climb, but I made it! I stopped outside of Brown Fork Gap Shelter for lunch and ended staying for about an hour and a half trying to update this journal and add pictures. Plus, I think the biscuits & gravy made my stomach a little grouchy, but I felt alright to press on. My old plan was to camp at Cable Gap Shelter for the night, but I came around the corner here at Cody Gap and I thought this was a good place to sleep instead. As soon as I set up my tent and blew up my sleeping pad, I began to feel nauseated. I’m glad I stopped here instead of pressing on forward. I ventured off into the woods and did my third poop of the day and I feel a lot better now! As soon as I walked back up, a man shouted “Guido”, and it was “Professor” who I haven’t seen since the hostel in Franklin. This campsite is pretty cozy, and I think it’s time to take advantage of that.","Stecoah Gap

Guido,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633641,"I got started pretty late today, but boy was it a beautiful one! After hiking about eight miles, I arrived at the Marina. I needed to get to the Fontana Lodge in order to print out my physical copy of my permit for the Smokies. Every hiker starting their hike at least 50 miles north or south of the Smokies and ended their hike at least 50 miles north or south of the Smokies needs a permit. They can’t accept a digital one so I have to print it out. My plan was to get a shuttle to the lodge, print out my permit, get some dinner because there’s a restaurant inside the hotel, then get back on the trail and hike to the “Hilton.” However, it was 3:00 in the afternoon and the restaurant wasn’t open until 5:00, so I walked all the way down to Deal’s Gap I believe where there is a gas station with a store inside. I bought some hot chocolate, a few more rice dinners, Vaseline, and some ice cream. I arrived back at the lodge a few minutes before five, and was seated in the restaurant. The burger I had was awesome! It had bacon, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato, Mayo, and some onion wedges. Plus, I had fries with that; only for $10! It was too late in the day to ask for a shuttle back to the Marina, so I decided to just walk back by myself. It was going to be about a 45 minute walk for me. About a mile in, a friendly man named Dave stopped and gave me a ride so I wouldn’t have to walk. Thanks Dave! I then walked another 1.2 miles to the “Hilton.” Now, this shelter is nicknamed the Hilton because there’s showers nearby, restrooms, a water faucet, plus a solar phone charger! It’s luxury for a hiker. I’m very excited to start the Smokies tomorrow. It looks like it may rain all the rest of the week starting Wednesday.

The first guy got that name because he carried a big bag of water for everyone at camp to use. The Aquaman I met here is actually . . . the real Aquaman. He actually played Aquaman for DC’s video games and comics from what he mentioned. Anyway, I woke up to a beautiful sunrise (see the photo). I few other people slept in the shelter with me tonight including Jack and Ella (they have trail-names now but I forgot what they were). I immediately skipped ahead of them for the entire day so yeah, I’m hiking alone again. Also, today is my first day hiking in the Smokies! Before you get there, the trail runs on top of the dam and the national park border is right after. The trail then follows the road for a bit, then finally cuts off into the woods. The next real road crossing from there is Newfound Gap in about 40 miles! The first few miles is almost all uphill until you get to the Shuckstack Fire Tower. I’ve been to this tower before and it’s beautiful (see photos). After getting back down and eating lunch. Someone pointed out that someone dropped their tent a couple miles down the trail, and of course that would be me. I must’ve slipped through my bungees when I took off my pack to take off my fleece jacket. Thankfully, someone picked it up but walked farther down the trail so all I had to do was catch up to him. Oh, and of course I did lol.Finally, I made it to Russel Field Shelter. A woman who I’ve seen off and on named “Amazing” pointed out a deer close by, so there’s my first real animal sighting of the trip! It started to sprinkle outside a little bit, but it stopped later.

The couple days in Franklin kind of threw me off a little, but I’m back on track with the “bubble” I’m sort of a part of.There’s this one mountain I climbed today that I’ve been wanting to climb for a long time; it’s called Rocky Top. “Rocky Top Tennessee” is the official fight song for the University of Tennessee Volunteers, and I sang the song on top of Rocky Top! However, that’s where the song came from. It was so foggy and windy on top of there though, but Gone With the Wind actually took the video of me singing it, and they’ll post it on Facebook soon, or send it to me so I can post it here. Once again, there very little people here at the shelter tonight. The big crowd seems to always be behind me at the previous shelter a few miles back. My father was planning to meet me at Newfound Gap tomorrow to bring me some resupply food. I heard one hiker in the shelter mention how the road will be closed tomorrow starting at 11AM due to bad weather. I immediately texted dad about the situation, and hopefully we can figure a way out of that. The weather is suppose to be very bad here too!

The first climb of the day is Clingman’s Dome. The highest point of elevation along the entire AT at 6,658 ft! The weather was too bad for me to walk up the tower, although some hikers did and they instantly regretted it lol. I’ve already been up there before, so it’s no big deal at all. Plus, I wouldn’t have gotten a view anyways. It continues to rain all day, plus I still haven’t heard back from my dad because I have no signal. I felt very crummy and wet coming into Mt. Collins Shelter for a break. I still didn’t have a signal. The shelter was already packed at 1:00 in the afternoon! This is the first miserable day of the trip for me and lord of other people, so I don’t blame them for taking it slow today and staying at the shelter. I would’ve loved to stay there, but I still had no idea if my dad made it or not. If he did, I would probably need to stay at Gatlinburg for the night anyway plus resupply more food. If he didn’t, my only other option would’ve probably been to stay inside the restrooms at Newfound Gap! Yes, people do sleep inside there when’s there’s no other option, especially when you’re low on vital foods that help keep you going.I walked a couple miles down the trail when text messages started flooding my phone saying that dad had made it and was waiting for me.

It was already 3:30, and I immediately lost signal after reading the messages so I couldn’t tell him that I was coming.

The plate I had was called the Barn Buster which includes four eggs, two strips of bacon, a sausage link, a sausage patty, hash browns, biscuits & gravy, and two pancakes! What a meal!
Afterwards, I stopped by the Nantahala Outdoor Center outfitter store here in Gatlinburg to see if they had any rain pants. My waist below were just soaked after yesterday’s rain; even though I had my normal hiking pants on. Guess what, they were out! I was later given a completely different idea; instead of trying to find a pair of rain pants, just don’t buy them at all! After all, you get sweaty in them after a long period of time which is what a lot of hikers complain about. I could just wear my normal quick-dry shorts. Plus, my legs and shorts would dry out a lot faster than any kind of pants. Keep in mind also that even if it’s chilly out when it’s raining, your legs stay pretty warm when you’re hiking. If you’re planning a thru-hike in the future, then I wouldn’t go spend a whole lot on pants. The pair I have right now came from a thrift store, so always be looking around for clothes like that.
My father drove all the way back here from Knoxville to give me a shuttle back to Newfound Gap. Plus, I accidentally left my trekking poles in his car when I checked into the hotel, so he pretty much had to come back! I believe it was me and another hiker named Bloodbath that rode up to Newfound Gap. He got the name Bloodbath from accidentally cutting open his thumb outside of a shelter and didn’t realize it was bleeding. It was dark, and he got blood all over his things without him realizing later on!
Newfound Gap was surreal today. Yesterday, my dad was the only one parked here. Now, it’s a beautiful day, the sun is shining, the sky is clear, and the place is packed out! The amount of day-hikers out here is atrocious! I had sight of at least one hiker during the first few miles of today’s hike. Many were amazing on the feat I’m trying to accomplish. Others probably had no idea about the trail they were walking on. Lol. Anyway, most of these folks were hiking up to Charlie’s Bunion today. I’d say it’s one of the prettiest and most popular views in the Smokies. I had been looking forward to seeing that for a long time, but the place was packed out!

Guido,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634564,"This morning, dad dropped me back off at Allen Gap around 10:15. Starting today, I thought I should do a little geocaching along the trail. You can go to geocaching.com if you’ve never heard of it, and it’s a lot of fun! I just found one cache today, but I think I want to start a streak and find at least one a day for 100 days straight! I don’t think I’ll be able to do it, but we’ll see! Today’s hike was pretty tough! However, I think it was because of resting for a couple days which made my body a little stiff maybe. Who knows? The first several miles were almost all uphill. Especially the last mile and a half. At the top, there’s a few buildings, a couple cell towers, and a lookout tower. The very top of the tower was closed, but I still got a picture. A couple miles farther, there was the Blackstone Cliffs, and the Whitestone Cliffs I believe. At the Whitestone Cliffs, I read that you can see as far as Kingsport on a clear day I think! They were great views up there and a beautiful day! The climb down there was pretty difficult with all of the rock scrambles everywhere. It kind of reminds me of Blood Mountain all the way back in Georgia. Jerry Cabin Shelter was super crowded tonight! I’d say at least 20 tents around the vicinity of the shelter. Of course I was in one of those tents. I saw Peas & Carrots, and met a guy named East who started the AT on March 19th! He seems to be really booking it based on where he’s gotten so far. It’s been a long day, must get some sleep now","Allen Gap

It was nice to see ""Gone With the Wind"" and ""Peas and Carrots"" last night again. I'm beginning to really enjoy the company and people on this trip! 
I found another geocache today just off the trail, then stopped at Flint Mountain Shelter for lunch. There I met ""Warthog"" and somebody else. I really need to start writing down names so I can remember them!
There wasn't many more events today. I did spot my first snake on the trail. I almost stepped on it thinking it was a stick until it slithered offthe trail. The snake's color was grey. A rather unusual color, but thank God it didn't kill me lol. My final stop for the night is at Hogback Ridge Shelter. I actually day-hiked with my dad here many years ago and did trail magic for the thru-hikers that year! There's so many tents set up here including mine.

The reason for hiking this long today is because my friend Mike is meeting me in Erwin tomorrow so I can resupply and have lunch with him! I have to meet him around noon tomorrow so I really needed to put in big miles today.When I got to Sam’s Gap this morning, I met a man named Paul cooking up some eggs and potatoes for breakfast! I didn’t expect to see trail magic today in the middle of the week! As I was hiking up Big Bald, I came across more trail magic! There was a giant cooler with sodas, Oreos, and cheese! They must live right around the corner up the hill for them to bring that cooler all the way over there.The top of Big Bald was beautiful with 360 views! The climb up there was tough but well worth it. I met a big family from Cincinnati and plenty of thru-hikers in the mix of it all. After that, it was nothing more than a long afternoon of walking. It was pleasant to see the Spivey Gap sign which marks the beginning of the trail that is maintained by the TEHC (Tennessee Eastman Hiking Club) I think. About a mile past that, I felt completely drained with no juice left in the tank. I stuffed in some peanut butter and trail mix and didn’t stop walking until my destination. I got there right before dark and camped right next to Gone With the Wind, and Tagalong and Inchworm. I’m so beat up, but thankfully it will be a much shorter day tomorrow!","Hogback Ridge Shelter

It’s only about six miles to Uncle Johnny’s in Erwin which is where I’ll be meeting Mike today. I was worried that I was gonna be late, but I ended up arriving there an hour and a half early! Uncle Johnny’s showers felt super nice! Especially when you have several days worth of dirt on your body! I also saw Water and his dog Sparky who I haven’t seen since Franklin! They’re both having leg issues so please be praying! Mike ended up meeting me a bit early and we drove to Pizza Plus for their lunch buffet! I didn’t keep track of how much pizza I ate, but I can tell you what, they did run out at one point lol. Mike kindly paid for my lunch and my resupply after that! Plus, some extra money to purchase some Mountain House meals when I get a chance! Thank you so much once again Mike! After all of this, I decided to hang out for a bit. They have some bicycles that you’re welcome to ride around in which is what I was told, so I did! Plus, I geocached along the way! I would’ve stayed out just a little bit longer if it didn’t start to sprinkle. It ended up being just a light sprinkle and no rain for the rest of the day! I stayed at Uncle Johnny’s Hiker Hostel for just a little bit longer, and didn’t get out of there until past 5:30. Plus, I still have more than four miles to hike! I’ve also day-hiked this section before and don’t remember being this pretty! My final stop tonight is Curly Maple Gap Shelter which was renovated in 2010. It was right after I visited the original one, so I’ve never seen the new(er) one before. The parmesan risotto I had for dinner tonight was disgusting! I’ve been keeping it in my pack for a while, and it had to be and of the worse things I’ve ever eaten. However, it had plenty of nutrients to help me for tomorrow.","No Business Knob Shelter

It’s an imaginary trail that starts in the Everglades of Florida which is where you start the Florida Trail. That trail goes all the way to Pensacola, then you must road-walk to the Pinhoti Trail in Alabama which goes north as well. After you finish that, you have to road-walk to the beginning of the AT.

He’ll be picking me up there so we can attend my friend Hopeful’s birthday party on Sunday! He does it every year all the way back in Stecoah Gap just north of the NOC. The hike today was beautiful especially hiking through this spruce forest on Unaka Mountain. It started to sprinkle here and there, but still haven’t had any rain since the Smokies!

The first several miles were pretty easy up to Clyde Smith Shelter and I was feeling great! However, I was really dreading the five mile climb up Roan Mountain today.Surprisingly, I saw Water again at Clyde Smith around lunchtime! I assumed he took another zero in Erwin to let his shin heal, but I guess he didn’t. Turns out he camped right below me last night! I ate a lot of food for lunch so I wouldn’t have to take as many breaks for the rest of the day. It was sprinkling off and on all afternoon on the way to Roan Mountain. It started to rain right after I stopped to fill up on water about half a mile up the mountain. The higher I climbed, the foggier, rainier, and windier it got. I would’ve loved this climb on a normal day, but the miserable weather took a little bit of the joy out of it. It was still very pretty while walking in the midst of spruce and pine trees. My feet were very sore especially climbing back down the mountain. I saw the sign that marks the side-trail for the next shelter which now put me just a mile and a half away from Carvers. I was soaked and dreading to “get out of here.” When I finally got to the parking area and out of the woods, the wind was 3x worse than it was before. The hat I was wearing covered my eyes so I couldn’t see much. I looked around for a minute and realized that my dad wasn’t here! So, I walked back into the woods and tried to call him, but I didn’t have a strong enough signal. I prayed to the Lord then there he came! I ran as fast as I could heaving my 35 lb backpack with one arm and my trekking poles in the other, while the ferocious wind almost whipped me to the wonderful land of Oz! I cried, “Get me out here!” and we took off from there. I was too relieved to say a word . . .ASAP, who I haven’t seen since Franklin, was in the front seat! My dad picked him up from Hampton and he’s also coming to Hopeful’s party! Also, another friend named “Go” is coming with us, but we still needed to pick him up from a different trailhead because he’s not done hiking yet. When we finally all got together, we chose to get Pal’s hamburgers for dinner and ate in the car on the way to Asheville. We still hadn’t figured out a hotel yet, but eventually we came to a deal with a Super 8. There was a Culver’s nearby (the restaurant I work at back home) and we got some custard and cheese curds for myself! Anyway, I’m tired! Good night!","Campsite Near Iron Mountain Gap

The breakfast was very sad and embarrassing at the hotel with just a granola bar, a fruit cup, and a water bottle. But, we went to McDonald’s instead before we hit the road to Stecoah Gap.It was another pretty day, although chilly and windy at Stecoah when we got there. There was so much food there, that I started to feel full before I even touched anything! Anyway, it was great to meet new people, hikers and friends, see Hopeful and his wife Diana again, and the food of course! Plus, one of the most famous trail angels showed up at the party today by the name of Miss Janet. I’ve been hearing about her for so long and now I finally get to meet her! However, she says I’ve meet her one other time as a kid. My dad has been good friends with her for a long time which explains to you guys why she knows me. Not long after, Stewart & Carol shows up! They bring out these giant cast iron pots and start cooking them on a stove. Unfortunately, I had no place to stay tonight, so I had to leave the party early so I could get back on the trail. However, Miss Janet drove me! We had plenty of good conversations on the ride with me, ASAP, and Go. When I got dropped back off at Carvers Gap, the sky was clear, and there was people everywhere unlike yesterday! My goal was to get to Overmountain Shelter tonight (Yellow Mountain Gap) so I could meet Tagalong & Inchworm, and Gone With the Wind. The hike was pretty easy and now I’m here camped in a grassy field.

I camped right in front of Overmountain Shelter which is an old barn that was converted to a shelter, but they closed it down a couple years ago because the structure is unstable. It’s the largest shelter on the entire trail. Unfortunately, I heard that they’re planning to tear it down very soon, so it may be the last time I get to see it.Little Hump Mountain wasn’t hard at all, but once you got to the top, lo and behold you can see Hump Mountain in the distance. Hiking up there was super windy, and it felt like it took forever! However, I got some great views and plenty of pictures to share. I couldn’t imagine trying to hike Hump Mountain in the rain along the wind. The rest of the day was all literally downhill. I stopped at the Doll Flats campsite for a while and ate lunch because I stayed at this campsite 10 years ago on my first overnight hiking trip! I remember being nine-years-old and the wind, rain, thunder, and lightning were so bad that night! I still consider it as one of the scariest nights of my life, but thank God it’s such a nicer day today! At Doll Flats, there’s also a sign that says “Leaving NC!” Since the Smokies, the trail has been zigzagging across the state line between North Carolina and Tennessee. Now, I’m now officially done with North Carolina and into Tennessee until I hit Virginia!Gone With the Wind and Tagalong & Inchworm caught up to me at Doll Flats and we hiked together for the rest of the day. I reserved a bunk at a hostel called Mountain Harbor right off of 19E. When we all got there, we had already agreed to eat lunch together down the road into town, but we had no ride! Tagalong was having a conversation with one of the guests inside the hostel and he let Tagalong barrow his nifty little Subaru since he is a “Class A” driver! We all jumped in and took off to post office and then to Bob’s Dairyland for lunch! I had the “Holy Cow” burger which had pretty much everything you can dream of plus a giant milkshake! I downed it all pretty quickly plus I ate Tagalong’s, Inchworm’s, and Karen’s leftovers! When we got back to the hostel, Gone With The Wind decided they weren’t gonna stay there because of the price, so they stayed just down the road for the night. Tonight was Inchworm’s birthday so Tagalong secretly bought her a cake and got it delivered to the hostel as a surprise! With all of the food I ate earlier, I couldn’t finish my slice!

The hike today was much easier than the previous few days. It flattens out quite a bit after the Roan Highlands. 
One of the main highlights today was reaching the 400 mile marker! Seriously, 400 miles! I still have about 1,700 miles to go, and yes, it’s been a blast so far! Thank you to everyone who’s supported me so far, and I’m looking forward for what God has in store next!
Another highlight today was Jones Falls. This is one of the first waterfalls you see right off the AT besides Long Creek Falls down in Georgia which I didn’t visit at that time. I saw Water and his dog Sparky once again at this spot, and had some time of prayer together which really helped me get through today. Plus, I met a lady with three young girls. I’m not sure if they’re thru-hiking or not, but they’re definitely here to stay at least a couple nights. Tonight, I’m camped at a stealth campsite by myself.

It was another warm beautiful morning. However, when I took off my night pants after getting out of bed, a piece of string caught onto some dead skin on my foot and peeled it back too far. I know it sounds weird, but now whenever I put pressure on it, it hurts. I immediately knew that I wasn’t gonna make it to Hampton today even though I made a reservation already. Plus, my foot needed some TLC before I could get back out there. When I got to Dennis Cove Rd, I took a right following the signs to the Black Bear Resort and got a bunk here tonight. Plus, they called up Boots Off for me to move my reservation to tomorrow night instead. At least they shuttled me to Hampton to resupply. I needed to resupply with essential items very badly because I foolishly didn’t do that back in Roan Mountain a couple days ago when I could’ve. Plus, I got a frozen pizza for lunch and McD’s for dinner. Now I’m all filled up thankfully. Tomorrow, I will stay at Boots Off so now I’m staying at different hostels two nights in a row. The only reason I want to stay at Boots Off is because I have a bracelet that was given to me by the owner which I’ll get a 10% discount if I have it. Plus, I wanted to support the owner because he was a nice guy when I met him back in Georgia. I hate having to jump from hostel to hostel every night it seems, but right now it’s best for me.

Today, I got to see Laurel Falls, which I will say is the prettiest waterfall on the entire trail. After that, I took a break another break at Laurel Fork Shelter, then headed up Pond Mountain. I was in good spirits today and the huge climb up there wasn’t hard at all for me. It pretty much felt like just another hill to go up, over, and down to Boots Off. The bunkhouse here is a little tight but each one has a curtain for privacy which is nice. Me and the rest of us guests caught a shuttle into Hampton again for resupply and dinner. I got a couple snacks at the store since I already resupplied yesterday, then I got McD’s again. I knew I was gonna come back here, so I filled out the survey on the receipt from last night and got a BOGO sandwich this time. 
It’s a pretty chilly night as I sat around the campfire as well as the lady with the three girls I met a couple days ago. I found out that they started at Davenport Gap which is right after the Smokies, and they were seeking to go all the way from there.

After Boots Off, the trail circles around Watauga Lake for a bit and then goes across a dam. Then, it’s just straight uphill for a while. For some reason, this killed me. I was trying to make it to Iron Mountain Shelter, but I’m staying at Vandeventer Shelter which is about six miles short of where I wanted to be. I decided to sleep in the shelter tonight despite the fact that this shelter is haunted. Around 40 years ago, a man murdered a girl here with a hatchet, so since then, there have been reports of ghosts and such I think. Thankfully, I’m not along tonight. I met a girl named Aspen in the shelter with me, and Peas & Carrots showed up and they’re sleeping in their tent outside.

This part of the trail is nicknamed the “Tennessee Turnpike” and I sure did take advantage of that. The entire day today was just slight ups and downs with no real climbs, so it felt like I hiked a lot less miles today than I actually did. I stopped at Iron Mountain Shelter for lunch today where I met a few weekenders, then stopped at Double Springs Shelter for dinner. It was already 6:30 and I was really to just throw down there tonight, but Al (I think that’s his name) convinced me to go farther. I hiked another 8+ miles tonight to get to Abingdon Gap Shelter and here I am! I was just gonna throw down in the shelter again tonight, but I open some pepperoni and candy and here come the mice. They didn’t get into any of my food, but they sure did get excited when I opened some up. Luckily, I found a flat spot to camp right in front of the shelter.

It’s very weird because I hiked 23 miles yesterday and still didn’t see anyone I knew. Anyway, I’m starting Virginia today and getting into Damascus is what matters. 
I slept in this morning since it was gonna be an easy short day for me. Plus, I’m not in a rush to get to town. As I was packing up, I met a day-hiker named Mother Nature who’s actually completed the entire trail twice! She thru-hiked in ‘98 I think and did it in sections throughout seven years! Plus, she’s from New England and she’s just out here doing little sections that she remembers when she did it.
When I got to the state border, I was excited and sad at the same time. Tennessee has treated me well, but now it’s Virginia time! I’m gonna be here in Virginia for at least the next 500 miles! It’s the longest state on the trail and I’ll be near the halfway point when I finish it. 
The hostel I’m staying at for the next few nights is Crazy Larry’s which is on the other side of town. The trail runs right through the town just like Hot Springs. I saw Tagalong & Inchworm walking on the other side of the street, and we both said hi! They told me that Gone With the Wind was making steaks tonight at their cottage nearby and I should join them! Now my dinner plans were set! I checked into Crazy Larry’s and got my laundry done. Then I joined T&I for lunch at a wing restaurant. I got a burger which was pretty good, but not as good as Bob’s Dairyland. Me and T&I made plans tomorrow to ride the Virginia Creeper Trail which is a 17-mile downhill bike ride down back to Damascus. I reserved us a spot for the shuttle tomorrow morning so we could do that! A little while later, I walked over to GWTW’s place not to far from where I’m staying and had an awesome dinner!

When we got back down to Damascus, we went to grab lunch at the 7 Trails restaurant which just opened not too long ago. I once again got a burger and it was delicious! Still not as delicious as Bob’s, but it was better than yesterday’s. After lunch, we biked an extra mile to Food City so they could resupply. I just bought a pint of ice cream as a treat. It was gonna be hard for me to carry much more than that all the way back on a bike. However, I later resupplied at the Dollar General.

However, I’m very glad that I picked up a sub from Subway for lunch today. I stopped at Saunders Shelter for lunch and saw one hiker still bundled up since last night! The temperature has dropped significantly in the last 12 hours and may get down to the low 20s tonight! I doubt that he is getting out his sleeping bag anytime soon. It was a pretty casual hike down to where the AT meets the Creeper Trail which is where I saw the lady with her three girls again.

Guido,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636021,"I’ve been very looking forward to hiking this section recently. Today, I hit the Grayson Highlands, which are full of beautiful rocky grassy balds and of course, the wild ponies.I packed up quickly and got ready to go this morning and walked down to the next trailhead where there was a restroom because I needed to go very badly, only to find out that the restroom is still closed due to COVID! I’m sick of this! I had to go all the way back in the woods to go instead. What do they expect the non-hikers or day-hikers to do? It was an easy hike to the next shelter at Thomas Knob. They were at least six ponies crowding around the shelter when I got there! I don’t think I got any pictures of them today, but I did get some videos of them. According to a nearby kiosk, these ponies were introduced to the Grayson Highlands back in the 1980s to help graze the land from overgrowing too much and for the guest’s enjoyment. There is a sign farther up the trail which states that you’re not allowed to feed them or pet them, but I fed them back at the shelter before I knew about that and I wasn’t technically inside the state park. The rest of the hike was beautiful especially when you’re above 5,000 feet in elevation. I saw a heard of ponies as I was heading out of the state park for the day, and witnessed a couple of them chasing each other. I captured this on video as they rounded behind and almost ran me over! I promise I wasn’t messing with them at all, but it was very cool to witness! I’m tented way back behind Old Orchard Shelter tonight. There’s many people here especially up at the shelter who’ve been laughing their heads off by the bonfire all night. Tomorrow, I’m headed to Troutdale for the church hostel. I’ll only have 1.7 miles to hike and it’s supposed to rain. It should be a good day to get off the trail.","Campsite North of Whitetop Mountain Rd

I was meeting a local ridgerunner that I met yesterday who agreed to pick me up from here and take me to Troutdale today, but he never showed up! So, I had to hitchhike on the road for 4.5 more miles just to get to the church hostel. It started to sprinkle on the wall there, but thankfully it didn’t pour. When I got settled in, there was nobody in sight except for me. Not even a caretaker. Since the church is in charge of the hostel, they don’t charge for staying there but request a donation. After I took a shower, it really started to pour outside. Thank goodness I’m not hiking in this weather! I’ve been needing to get laundry done for a long time, so I walked to the other nearby hostel to get that done. Plus, the fire department on the way was doing a BBQ cookout today! It was all indoors because of the rain and a cornhole tournament after lunch! I came in second out of four people who entered. Plus, I made a couple friends today! Vicky and her son Joseph or “Juko” live in nearby Marion and we all enjoyed our time with each other. I’m hoping to meet them again for dinner on Tuesday but we’ll see if that works out.During the cookout, I got my laundry delivered back to me! After the cookout, I said my goodbyes and walked back to the hostel. I was able to get a short-term resupply at the other hostel I did laundry at, but other than that, there’s nothing else here in Troutdale. There’s no grocery store or restaurant! Now, I’m sitting in my bunk alone with nothing really good to eat. I don’t want to eat very much of the food I already have because I want to save it for the trail. I’m finally going to church tomorrow,’so maybe I can talk the pastor into getting some lunch somewhere. We’ll just see what the Lord has in store tomorrow. I’m very excited to go to church and worship the Lord for the first time on the trail. However, it’s gonna be very hard to get back on the trail with an empty stomach!","Old Orchard Shelter

He knows my friend Circuit Rider very well which is mainly the reason for staying at the hostel and attending the service this morning. He asked me if I needed anything which was my biggest chance to say that I’m hungry, and he invited me over his house for lunch! Thank you once again Ken for the tuna sandwiches, taco soup, and ice cream! I’m looking forward to see him and all the church members again at their hiker-feed next month if I’m able to go. Then, Ken kindly dropped me back off at the trailhead so I wouldn’t have to hitchhike again like yesterday.

After several miles in, I realized that I forgot my 6L water bag! I was too far away to hike back and get it, but it’s not too big of a deal to leave it behind. I left it hanging up by the shelter full of water, but I can get a new one soon. 

I got to Trimpi Shelter around 10:15. That’s over nine miles in three hours! That put me just short of ten miles to go until Partnership Shelter! At Partnership Shelter, there’s a visitors center nearby with a phone which you can order pizza with! Plus, I’m sooo hungry. There was gonna be a big crowd tonight anyway and they were all behind me, so I took a couple long breaks in between. 

When I arrived at the shelter, a group already made an order for pizza, so I waited for some other hikers who were behind me so we could make an order ourselves. I got a 16” Supreme and ate the whole thing no problem! Everything is  very well here although the temperature is rather warm.

The trail crosses under I-81 at exit 54 where there is an Exon station with a Mexican restaurant that I ate at today. There, I learned that a friend from my church passed away yesterday after a four-year battle with cancer. I may have to go to his funeral whenever it’ll be. This made me super sad. Brendan wasn’t a very close friend to me, but throughout his inspiring ongoing battle with sin and cancer, he’s taught me to be strong and helped me to strengthen my faith. Brendan is home with the Lord now, but I hope his testimony will continue to inspire many more.The trail after the interstate crossing is gorgeous. There’s some more fields and meadows that the trail cuts through which are just beautiful! Whenever I see a pretty view or sight, I think of how awesome our creator is! Praise the Lord!

The hardest part today was the first couple miles which were slightly uphill, but easy it seemed. Once you get to the bottom, you zig-zag up a gorgeous meadow. I love to walk through these fields, just because it’s different than the woods. I’d love to just sit down a eat a snack, but there’s no shade. Instead, I hiked up to the next gate which enters back into the woods and took a long break there. I’ve been wanted to stop at this hostel a few miles up that has burgers and such, so when I got there, I was quickly convinced to just stay here tonight. I was gonna try another 15 miles to Chestnut Knob Shelter, but the food was fairly cheap and I bought lots of food to munch on inside the bunkhouse. Plus, I became good friends with the lady who runs this hostel and I was able to fill out and send a bunch of postcards!

My blister is feeling a little better, I just need to be careful with it so it doesn’t flare up like it usually does late in the day. Boy . . . I should’ve went to go poop back at the hostel, especially after eating breakfast. I was in a mad rush to get to the next shelter in a mile, but unfortunately, I DIDN’T MAKE IT IN TIME! Just kidding, at least I found a nice hiding spot behind a hill lol. Not too long after the shelter, I saw once again Tagalong & Inchworm. There were ahead of me until I crossed under I-81. I was ahead of them after that because they spent the night in Marion. They actually camped right across the road last night and I stayed at the hostel down the road last night. I’m glad I caught up to them!The wind started to pick up a little later on, and I saw a tree fall down about 100 yards ahead of me! Tag & Ince were hiking right behind me, but they didn’t see it! They heard it although. The tree actually fell right on top of the trail, so we just did the easy little shimmy over that is hikers do all the time.We then stopped for lunch across a creek. The bridge across it washed out last year, so I had to put on my Crocs to wade through the creek. Thankfully, it hasn’t rained recently, so the water wasn’t deep at all. Not long after this, the trail comes to a road crossing. The last 4-5 miles from there are all uphill! The uphills for me are not as bad as long as I’ve been mentally preparing for it. I definitely prefer downhills more than uphills since I’m young and my knees don’t hurt as much as old people. The uphills definitely stiffen up my calf muscles quite a bit, but of course I was able to endure this climb. The higher it went, the easier it was.The shelter up here is a pretty big shelter with a door. It’s up here at 4,400 feet above sea level and it’s super windy up here especially on this bald. It’s raining off and on, and this shelter is super crowded tonight. Some hikers have to sleep on the floor and I think a couple of them tented outside as well. Tomorrow, I’m getting picked up by my father back to Knoxville for Brendan’s funeral.

I came all the way downhill to the last water source in about 9-10 miles. The water source at the last shelter was far away and unreliable. This source was pretty unreliable as well. In fact, there was a frog in the tiny pool of water that I was filtering out of. Yuck! However, I needed water badly, and that was my only source for a while.
I’m been feeling pretty happy lately. The place I stayed at last night was about 4,400 feet above sea level, which is actually the last time I climb up that high until New Hampshire! The terrain gets a lot flatter from here on out for a while thank goodness, so hopefully I can get some bigger miles in soon. I saw once again the lady with three girls at Jenkins Shelter. There was a good little climb after that, but the rest of the way down was very easy. I walked across the bridge next to the road then to the parking lot to wait for my dad to pick me up. He’s coming from Fayetteville, NC today, and we’re driving back home to Knoxville, TN tonight. I got there a little after three; I waited a while, and he showed up around 3:30.
We drove past Marion on the way to get pizza at the same restaurant I got pizza at from Partnership Shelter. I once again downed a 16” Meat Lovers pizza! Plus, some cheese breadsticks and a 32oz milkshake from Pals! I don’t think anybody can stop me now!
Finally, I’m back home! The ride felt a lot shorter than it actually took. I took a shower, then drove with my mom to pick up my two next younger brothers from prom. Our plan was then to go to Waffle House for a late night snack! I haven’t been to Waffle House in forever, but I guess I could eat something else even though I’m still full from earlier. It was already midnight, and we stayed there till past 1AM! It was nice to meet some people who’ve been following my trail journal since this prom was being run by my family’s homeschool co-op, plus to see some friends again!

It started to sprinkle a little on the way down, but it didn’t turn into rain! I arrived at the Brushy Mountain Outpost which is a little hiker store/restaurant right along the trail for lunch. I had their special burger called the Brushy Mountain Burger which had a meat patty, everything on it, and this huge thick chunk of fried bologna! I couldn’t eat it all since I’ve been eating too much food recently. I need to wait until my hiker hunger kicks in again so I can eat things like that again. I saw Bundles inside the restaurant as well for the first time in weeks! He stayed with me and ASAP back in Hiawassee, GA, then got his trail name the next night at Bly Gap.

Back at the yard sale this weekend, I find a tiny little fitness tracker that I tried out, but it doesn’t really work. I’ll still keep it until I figure it out though. 
For the second time on this trip, I witnessed another woman with her pants down next to the trail. She didn’t think there would be anyone behind her so that’s completely understandable, but still. . .
I was running very low on water until I found just a tiny creek. I stopped there, met a few new people, and ate lunch there. I shouldn’t have stayed for so long because I started to hear thunder right after I left there. I quickened my pace thinking I could outrun the storm even I knew I couldn’t. Plus, there’s a shelter just a mile and a half away I could get to anyways. I told myself that I wasn’t gonna put my pack cover on until I felt a drop or two, and then I did. As soon as I felt it, it started to downpour on me before I could even put on my rain jacket. There were a couple lightning strikes that were very close by, but I’m safe. I recently heard about a couple hikers back in the Smokies who get struck by lightning on separate occasions. However, I think they’re alright. 
I got to the next shelter which had about 4-5 people inside waiting for the rain to subside. The rain had stopped well before I got there anyway, so most of them were beginning to pack up and hike on while a couple of us are staying here.

Thankfully, someone took them and hung them in the shelter. It also rained last night, so I was worried that my socks had gotten wet again from the rain, but it all worked out perfectly. 
I hiked the next 6-7 miles by myself early in the morning and walked off the trail a bit to Trent’s Grocery. It’s just a little old gas station with some resupply, burgers, pizza, you name it. I got a Hunt Brothers Pizza with everything on it, plus a jumbo iced honey bun I bought myself. I got a ride back to the trailhead in the back of a pickup truck, and moved on. 
I stopped again another mile and a half at Dismal Falls. I met a thru-hiker named “Silver Lining” or “Silver” for short. He was wearing a University of Tennessee shirt even though he is from New Hampshire. He just needed a nice hiking shirt to wear while he was back in Georgia and found that shirt at a Goodwill. He didn’t even have any idea how big college football is down in the south, so he’s had plenty of people explain it to him along the way so far! 
If I was gonna do 24 miles today, then I better get moving. The next six or seven miles were very smooth, so I moved past that quick.

The first couple miles were pretty steep going uphill, but the rest of the hike tonight was alright. It’s just me and Silver here at Docs Knob tonight.

After the tree, you take a nice little climb uphill and then walk along this beautiful ridge line for the next several miles. This is also where the Eastern Continental Divide cuts through.

Dragons Tooth is the beginning of what they call the Virginia Triple Crown. The Triple Crown consists of these three popular locations along the AT that are close by including Dragons Tooth, McAfee Knob, and the Tinker Cliffs. Dragons Tooth is named for its rock formation at the top, McAfee Knob is the most popular of the three where a giant rock slab hangs over a drop off, and hikers famously dangle their legs over the cliff. Tinker Cliffs is a 0.5 mile walk on the AT later on that has pretty views and such from what I’ve heard. 
When I finally made it to Dragons Tooth, it was very crowded. I took a couple photos, then walked back down the mountain. I’m not kidding, but hiking down Dragons Tooth was the hardest downhill climbs that I’ve experienced so far on this trek! It took me forever just to walk 0.4 miles to the next gap where it was a little easier from there. After this exciting and breathtaking walk, I finally made it down to the road crossing where I bought way too much food to eat in one sitting, so I was able to stuff the rest in my pack. I bought a pizza where I was too full to eat the last two slices, Oreos, Cheez-its, party mix, etc. I got it all! Since I’m so skinny, I’ve got no fat to lose on my body. I don’t feel guilty at all. 
I was planning to hike a lot more miles today, but I spent way too much time at that place and felt like I could hardly walk after eating so much.

A few day hikers seemed confused at me when they walked down to the shelter this morning and saw me in it. I talked to them for a bit and explained how I’m walking from Georgia to Maine and they asked questions like, 
“How long does it take?”
“When did you start?”
“When will you be done?”
Finally, I made it to the top! It was very chilly up there this morning. In fact, there was a few flurries coming down. I stayed up there for a while, had some snacks, and took plenty of pictures of the Knob. 
I wanted to get to town so badly. I may have walked 12-13 miles straight from McAfee Knob without a real break until I was hungry again. My father picked me up from the trailhead at U.S. 220 when I got there and dropped me off at the hotel. Tagalong & Inchworm were staying just across the street, so we met for dinner at Three Little Pigs BBQ. I had amazing ribs with jerk sauce, although I couldn’t eat the whole thing since I filled up myself too much on snacks earlier. Looks like we’re doing a short eight mile slack-pack tomorrow and headed straight for Trail Days. Tag & Inch aren’t planning on going though, but we’ll see.","John Springs Shelter

Guido,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638723,"My dad picked me up from the hotel this morning so me, Tag & Inch could slack-pack 7.8 miles today. Shortly after the road crossing where we started, we reached the 1/3 point to Mt. Katahdin! My dad also decided to slack-pack the lady and her three adopted girls that I’ve talked about a few times. Turns out, they go by the Louisville Ladies for now on I think. We met my dad again at the next road crossing at US 11. He stopped by a Goodwill after dropping us off and found a cheap decent slackpack to use so we could carry our water and things. Tagalong volunteered to carry it and I hiked on ahead, even though he was carrying my water. I did have to stop for about 15 minutes for them to catch up so I could drink some water, but I walked on ahead again.I decided to stop at Fullhardt Knob Shelter for a quick break. Turns out, my friend Water was there. He gifted me one of his Cliff Bars to me for a snack and we prayed for a couple minutes. Now, I needed to catch up to Tag & Inch who I assume are ahead of me now.Tag & Inch still thought I was ahead so there were rushing to try and catch up to me even though I was behind. Plus, I was trying to catch up to. I got to the road where my dad was picking me up and it’s just an abandoned dirt road with no car in sight. I knew this is the road where I was getting picked up and I hoped that Tag & Inch didn’t hike ahead on accident. Since I left my phone behind, I was fortunate to barely see a hiker through the leaves of the trees so I ran up to him and asked him to use his phone so I could call my dad. There was a gate across the road about a mile down that my dad couldn’t drive through so that’s how far off the trail I walked just to get to him. He had to carry Tag & Inch’s backpacks all the way up there so they wouldn’t have to walk all the way back like I did. Plus, they weren’t coming to Trail Days anyway. Got some lunch at Dodge’s Chicken in Troutville off the interstate; a road trip favorite.We we’re picking up a few more hikers for Trail Days in Damascus back at the McAfee Knob parking lot. So, we rode all together this afternoon. All the way back to Damascus where I took a couple zero days last month. I’m staying in Tent City tonight, and looking forward to tomorrow’s activities and vendors at this huge festival. I’m very excited!","US 220

Guido,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638811,"I wish I had remembered to take pictures today, but Trail Days was a blast! Last night, I walked back over to Crazy Larry’s just to say hi to him. He remembered me, brought me in his home, and fed me some bean stew and Cheerwine (cherry soda, non-alcoholic). Later last night around midnight, I was as nauseous as ever! Thankfully, I didn’t get sick so I can enjoy the day today. My fun-filled day started with a cornhole tournament that the church across the street was doing. Me and my partner Sweatsicles only made it to the second round and got knocked off by a couple ladies. I wish the rules were just a little different, but I guess they wanted the rounds to go fast. The ALDHA (Appalachian Long Distance Hiker Association) did a big feed today. I was joined by Bob Peoples and couple more fellow hikers that I knew. So my dad drove all the way back north to pick up ASAP for Trail Days. He actually convinced Tag & Inch to come too since he was in the area. Long story short, I bought a book for my mom called “Psalms in my Backpack” from a wonderful couple who section-hiked Pennsylvania with their four children back in 1990. I bought myself a frozen lemonade, a maple bacon funnel cake, bacon ranch fries, and a slice of pizza from Bundles who volunteered to help out with this certain vendor I guess. It was great to meet so many wonderful people and see people that I knew again. As the sun went down, the famous Ms. Janet lit up her annual traditional bonfire and had a party. Ms. Janet did have to dance in order to get her wooden spoon back which my dad has been carrying around all of this time since she left it at Stecoah Gap during Hopeful’s birthday bash. Then Odie gave a trail history speech and I was off to bed after things got a little out of hand I shall say. We shall get back on the trail tomorrow.","Damascus, VA

Guido,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639130,"My father picked all four of us this morning. Me, ASAP, and Tag & Inch to head back to the trail. I am the farthest behind on the trail between the rest of the three. ASAP got off in Glasgow and he plans to take another zero today so we can catch up. Tag & Inch got picked up by my dad somewhere on the Blue Ridge Parkway not far where I left off. I was the first one from the batch to be dropped back off on the trail. Once again, I had to walk an extra mile to get back on the AT because there’s a gate at the road which prohibits vehicles from coming through. I was running low on water, so I filled up at the first creek on the bottom of the hill. That’s where I met Grizzly and Grizz. These two guys met coincidentally and became friends because their trail names were so similar. Grizz often gets his name mixed up for Chris instead of Grizz. After Salt Pond Rd, the AT runs parallel with the Blue Ridge Parkway all the way up to the Shenandoah National Park. I’ll name the Blue Ridge Parkway “BRP” for short. Then, the BRP turns into the Skyline Drive in the SNP which is actually the same road but the name changes in the SNP. The BRP starts in North Carolina and the same goes all the way to the very northern end of the SNP. The AT crosses the road many times when there’s a view and trash cans so I don’t have to pack out as much trash as usual. When I got to the shelter, there were Grizzly, Grizz, and a couple other people. One other guy is tenting right behind us. There’s no other place to tent around here so I’m inside the shelter tonight.","Salt Pond Rd

Guido,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639251,"Only 13.5 miles to finish off the day today. Bryant Ridge Shelter was too tempting to stay at, so I’d rather hang out with these people here tonight than walking the next 4-5 mile climb on Floyd Mountain in order to get to the next shelter. 
The fun part about today has nothing to do with the hike. I packed out some extra microwave popcorn that was left over from Daleville. I didn’t want to waste it, so I tried to pop it by the campfire in front of everyone. However, it didn’t work out. I burned a hole in the bag and it leaked butter everywhere. I got a few pops though, then I threw away the rest of it.
A section-hiker got a new trail name tonight. Even though my microwave popcorn experiment failed, his apple pie experiment succeeded. He now has the name, Betty Crocker.
I need to do huge miles tomorrow. I’m either gonna try to get to Glasgow tomorrow or stay early and get to Glasgow the next day. I need to get to Glasgow anyway to resupply, so I need some sleep in order to have a big day tomorrow.","Bobblets Gap Shelter

Guido,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639516,"I set my alarm for 5AM this morning and got going around 5:15 to start off what was a huge day for me. Floyd Mountain wasn’t too tough, but just a very long uphill to climb. I got some trail magic from a couple named Trudy & Carson who were just day-hikers on the top of Floyd Mountain. Just a nut bar, but that helped me a lot since I’m running super low on vitals.I took a break at the next shelter and received a bag of carrots since it was extra. Now I’m not too worried that I’m gonna run out of food before my next town visit tomorrow. I met a guy later in the day who said he was also going to Glasgow in the morning. He camped several miles before me tonight and we both plan to grab a shuttle into town together so the shuttle driver won’t have to make two separate trips. So basically, I hiked before sunrise this morning and hiked past dark tonight. I could’ve hiked a lot more than 22.8 miles today if it wasn’t for all the uphills. However, I’m looking forward to my town stop tomorrow. I wanna get pizza and fill myself up to the maximum!","Bryant Gap Shelter

Guido,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639517,"It was insane day today and I’ll tell you all about it.Me and my friend’s shuttle plan to town worked out perfectly. He dropped me off at Scotto’s Pizza for lunch with a resupply store in front and a laundromat. Plus, the hiker pavilion behind had free hot showers! I ate lunch, then took a shower so I could wash the clothes I already had on. While my clothes were washing, I did my large resupply to save some time. I’m not sure when my next resupply point is, but I’m prepared for the longest I shall say. I also bought a couple energy drinks for the first time, and I didn’t realize how much that caffeine could help with my tiredness and exhaustion. Anyway, by the time all my chores were done, it was around 5:30 I think. My friends Tagalong & Inchworm were staying about 12 miles north from me, so I made the decision to night-hike tonight even though it was already 6:30 at night! At first, I tried to hitch a ride at a busy intersection which didn’t work out, so, I called the same guy back up from the hostel who gave me a ride back for a fairly good rate. I stopped at the first shelter a couple miles in and got shelter. I saw a few people from Maine and Good Fella & Smiley. I haven’t seen Good Fella & Smiley since before Roan Mountain!After supper, I set out to do the longest night-hike of my life. On the way, I saw a humungous moth that had to be the size of my head! I have no idea what kind of moth it was, but I glad it didn’t get attracted to my head lamp when I passed by it. Around 11pm, I passed by a plaque on top of a mountain that stood for a little girl who ran away from school over a century ago and they found her body about six miles away on that exact spot! I think I may have saw the plaque move just a tiny bit after a took a picture of it. I got creeped out and hiked on.Finally, I made it to Punchbowl Shelter a little bit past midnight! A couple hikers in the shelter made room for me and Tag & Inch are in their tent somewhere I’m assuming. I’ll see them tomorrow and hopefully tomorrow won’t be as exhausting as the last couple days have been.","Matts Creek Shelter

Guido,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639518,"I slept in a little bit this morning after a very long night of hiking. Tag & Inch said hi and figured I would catch up to them, but I didn’t . . .I was feeling alright when I got going around 8:30. My father was doing some trail magic about 11 miles away so I knew that I had to at least hike that much today. I began just feeling very tired and low on energy. I took a lot more breaks than usual. After having a couple very long days in a row, I felt like I just needed to stop and rest some more, but my dad was waiting for me at the next road crossing so I didn’t want to let him down. On the hike today, there was a detour that the trail took, but I decided to take the old route instead. The bridge at the bottom of the hill completely broke in two by a fallen tree, so I crossed the stream on foot and climbed back on the trail. Also, there was a nice mile and a half section where there used to be a village and you can still see some of the ruins. Then, it was a literal uphill battle to get to route 60 where my dad was waiting. My dad helped Tag & Inch and ASAP slack-pack across the next mountain and down towards the next campsite, but I didn’t have the energy to go any farther today. He picked me up and we drove to a campground in Buena Vista for some tent spots but no luck. So, we ended up at a Quality Inn in Lexington, VA tonight. I borrowed my dad’s car and got supper for the both of us, and I’m gonna have a lot better sleep tonight.","Punchbowl Shelter

My father dropped me back off and we said our goodbyes because it’ll probably be the last time we see each other on this trip. I’m getting too far north for him to keep meeting me.It was a beautiful day outside once again. I had a 3,000 foot climb right off the bat to start the morning and did it with ease. The very top of the mountain had a nice grassy field to walk through and then back down to Hog Camp Gap. This was a beautiful area to stop for lunch and a great area to camp if I was going to. It’s just a big valley with a few trees around for some shade which provided a great lunch spot.The rest of the day was pretty easy, you go back in the woods and do short uphills and short downhills and flatness most of the way. When I got to the shelter, I noticed a campfire going, so I decided to stay here tonight because I had bought some Jiffy Pop back in Glasgow and I wanted to try and pop it! Mostly, I wanted revenge from the last time I tried to cook popcorn on an open fire. A couple witnesses were here tonight from the last time I tried, although the Jiffy Pop was successful! There was a couple holes on the bottom of the pan which made some butter leak out, but it was still good. I’m tented behind the shelter tonight, and it’s my first time using my summer sleeping bag on this trip. Hopefully, it’s gonna be as great of a day tomorrow as it was today.","US 60

I had left all my food inside my tent plus an open bag of gummy bears. I cleared my throat a couple times just to make some noise and it went away. I’m pretty sure it was a bear though!I hiked all morning, then got down to The Priest Shelter. The cover of the logbook says, “Book of Confessions” which was filled with hikers confessions beginning with, “Father forgive me.” The confession I wrote down was what happened this morning . . .I got down across the suspension bridge over the creek at the bottom of the Priest and took a long supper break. As I was about to leave, Peas and Carrots walk by and say hi! I haven’t seen them since Damascus and I thought they’d be farther behind, but now we’re together at least for right now. We hiked on another 2.5 miles and got to the shelter. Peas & Carrots are tenting much closer to the shelter while I’m a lot farther away because I couldn’t find a good spot near them.

Guido,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639907,"So me and Peas & Carrots ended up hitting the trail around the same time and hiked together for a little bit. I discussed plans with them when we get to Maine. Hopeful wants to come up and summit Katahdin with us if all works out, and I will be spending time with family who live up there.I stopped at the first shelter for a lunch break today while I was ahead of Peas & Carrots. As I tried to filter water out of my one gallon water bag that I bought back in Pearisburg, I discovered a major leak in the corner which made it almost impossible to filter water without it spilling out everywhere. That’s the only water bag I have and the only efficient way to filter water. I’m still about two days away from Waynesboro which is my next town stop with no way to filter water. Fortunately, I was able to call up the hostel in Waynesboro and get a shuttle off the Blue Ridge Parkway! We stopped at an outfitter to get a couple new water bags for me on the way, and now I’m staying over their hostel tonight. Tagalong & Inchworm and ASAP are all in town and got dinner at the Ming Garden Chinese buffet! ASAP couldn’t make it because he was staying at a hotel that was too far away and couldn’t find a shuttle. Water was also in town and also had dinner with us! Forgot to mention the delicious cake batter shake I got at Kline’s Dairybar. Tag & Inch are taking a zero tomorrow and the hostel will be helping me do an 18 mile slackpack to town tomorrow so I can catch up to them.

The hostel had some special slackpacks that I could use so I could carry my phone, my water, and some snacks. It was sprinkling when I started hiking, but it didn’t rain. I was worried for a few minutes if it did because I didn’t bring a rain jacket. It felt very nice this afternoon to hike without a giant pack on. I also sprinted some of it to see how fast I could go. The weather turned out to be very nice for the day. I started around 8AM and finished around 4PM hiking almost nineteen miles today. A different worker from the hostel picked me up from the trail and brought me to the Quality Inn where Tag & Inch were staying tonight. I dropped off my backpack here this afternoon so I could slackpack today.I never let Peas & Carrots know that I came into town yesterday because I didn’t have their phone number, but they’re in town now, and we all went to go get dinner together.

The camping rules here are much laid back than the Smokies where here you don’t have to camp only at the shelters. It was a foggy afternoon and I had a feeling that I was gonna have a hard time finding a stealth spot after the first shelter, so I’m staying here with Tag & Inch and several other section hikers.

I have a feeling that I will not see Peas and Carrots for a while since their pace seems to out-match the rest of us. However, me and Tag & Inch are trying to stay together for the time being. Since we only did 7.5 miles yesterday, we wanted to hike much more today to make up for that time. We could either stay at Blackrock Hut (shelter), stay at a campground, or find a stealth spot somewhere around there. We wanted to hike more so we went past the shelter. We hiked to the point where I spotted a sign that read, “No camping beyond this point” and we found a stealth camp spot right before that.

I stopped by the camp store first to charge my batteries and resupply. When I got to the wayside, the gift shop was open, but the restaurant was closed! It was a super bummer for the three of us. We took a pretty long beak there, and I took another long break about a mile back onto the trail and Tag & Inch hiked on ahead of me. I didn’t look like I was gonna go as far as I planned today. Tag & Inch are probably at the next shelter about eight miles away and I’m at this shelter called Pinefield Hut right now. On the way down, I heard some yapping behind which appeared to be a startled grouse that chased at yapped at me as I walked. It soon ran away into the woods continuing to yap which was kinda funny. In the shelter tonight, there’s a few section hikers and a father and his eight-year-old son Noah (or Bub).

I was hoping they would at least catch up to me at the next shelter tonight, but plans changed. When I got to the top of the next climb, I get a text message from ASAP to see where I am. I told him that I will be hiking 20 miles miles today to Bearfence Mountain Hut. He told me to hike an extra 8 miles to catch up to him, Water, and Go. So, my 20 mile day has turned into a 28 mile day! The longest I’ve ever hiked before. It was 9AM and I had 24 miles to go. If I hiked an average of 2 MPH throughout the entire day, then I should make pretty good time. That’s all I had to do . . . just for one day . . . I know my body can do this! I was already hiking at an excellent pace, so I stopped for some trail magic. These two brothers from Chicago were making chili on this sunny day and it was quite filling. The chili made me full so I kept on hiking and hiking and hiking. I caught up to Peas & Carrots also. They ended up stealth-camping about a few miles before Big Meadows which was where I was going. The wayside there, which I thought had.a restaurant, was closed, and had no restaurant. This was where I supposed that we would meet for dinner, but now I have to backtrack all the way back and hike an extra 1.5 miles! Finally, after over 30 miles of walking today, I arrive at the lodge here and saw ASAP and called out to him. We were all so looking forward to grabbing a burger or two here, but the wait-time was outrageous and so were the prices. ASAP, Water, and Go were kind enough to save me a pizza after the really long day I had. I haven’t been caught up to ASAP since my dad dropped him off all the way back in Franklin. Now, we have a food situation on our hands. ASAP doesn’t have enough food to last another day, and so does everyone else basically. It was going to be hard to walk back up to the wayside store which is a mile back up the road just to buy overpriced food, so we all weren’t sure what to do. Before coming back down to the campground where the four of us are camping tonight, I heard a familiar voice. The voice of Noah who I camped with last night. And, the father and his wife. Noah saw me, and they wanted to say hi. He knew ASAP too. We told them about our food situation, so we said our goodbyes and walked down to set up my tent. The family later comes back down with some veggies and goodies and tells us that they’ll shuttle us tomorrow to town for resupply tomorrow morning! Even though that it’s a far drive out of the way, and they were on vacation. It was super nice for them to offer this to us, so we agreed. God continues to bless us time and time again.

Then, we stopped at Subway where I bought two footlongs and ate both of them before we got back.Yes, I did need to resupply on some things, and I also got some treats including Twislers.

This cold front is over and warmer weather is coming.We all stopped at Jim & Molly Denton Shelter for some lunch, and Water challenged me to a game of horseshoes by the horseshoe pit right next to the shelter. I beat him by a lot! Now, it was time to see my dad and Queen Diva at the next road crossing.We all had a great time! We munched on watermelon, Oreos & milk, and tons of other stuff! We stayed here and talked for quite a long time since we were only going to the next shelter about 2.5 miles up. We said goodbye, especially to my dad. Now, I think this is the last time I’ll see him. I know I said that last time, but he just keeps finding ways to meet me.We were talking about cicadas during our break and how they should be coming out by now. As soon as I crossed under the interstate, I started to hear them and see them. It looks like we’ll be having to deal with them for a while . . .","US 522

I don’t know if it’s just me, or if the trail magic from yesterday has me bogged down.It was a nice sunny day again, and you can hear the cicadas very loudly in the distance. Thankfully, they are completely harmless, although they do grab on to you sometimes. However, it felt good to be walking by myself again. I’m sleeping in the shelter with a few other people. Hopefully I can catch up to my crew tomorrow. I’ll also reach the 1,000 mile marker tomorrow too!","Manassas Gap Shelter

Guido,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640533,"Today was an awesome day! ASAP and Water both waited over two hours for me to join them at the 1,000 mile mark! Go hiked on ahead though. Today, we also had to hike through this 13 mile stretch of the trail nicknamed the Roller Coaster where the trail constantly goes up and down. We were also meeting Queen Diva at Bears Den Hostel this afternoon for resupply. She used to work at this hostel back in the mid-2000s and she hasn’t been back since. So she’ll be staying here for a short period of time while we’re in the area. She picked us up from there, and drove us to the local Giant store. We bought some chicken wings, and a few days worth of resupply. We also bought brats to cook for dinner tonight! QD dropped us back off and we hiked a few more miles past the WV/VA border sign. The trail goes right into West Virginia briefly, and then runs right along the state-line for a bit. We’ll be permanently out of Virginia tomorrow! All four of us are stealth-camped near the end of the roller coaster. QD will be doing tacos for us tomorrow at Keys Gap! I’m looking forward to hiking with this crew!","Rod Hollow Shelter

Guido,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641298,"I’ve been really struggling to keep up with this journal so I’ve finally decided to cut to the chase and get a brand new fresh start. Many many things have happened since my last post and thank you for your patience during this process. I hope to start where I left off some other time, but right now, I just really need to be caught up.Let me update you with some of the major things that have happened with me and my trail family. The day after my last post was Go’s last day on the trail (leaving in Harpers Ferry). He flew back to Texas to see family. I hiked on into Maryland and Pennsylvania with ASAP and Water. I played a game called falling behind and catching up again the entire time down there. Queen Diva met me many more times with trail magic throughout Pennsylvania. Her last feed until she had to leave again was in Delaware Water Gap. I did a 31 mile day just to get there! That was the last time that I was caught up with ASAP and Water. My father did come up to meet me again in New Jersey. The same day, I slipped and almost crushed my knee badly, so it was perfect timing for dad to meet me. We picked up ASAP and Water that day and met with Gone With the Wind for dinner who were just a few days ahead of me. Plus, I haven’t seen them since Damascus! I had to take a few days off because of my knee and wore a knee brace for a couple weeks. However, it’s all completely better now! Thankfully, I didn’t have to go to urgent care or anything like that.Here’s where the sad part comes in. About a week later while ASAP and Water were a couple days ahead of me in New York, ASAP slipped and hurt his shoulder so badly that he couldn’t even move it. Water actually got him on a plane back to his hometown in Michigan that same night and his was actually doing very good! I was told that he should be back on the trail in a week, until something else arose. One side of his face started to droop and his blood pressure skyrocketed. He was having Bell’s Palsy, and then was diagnosed with Lyme’s Disease. He is slowly getting better, but he’s in great spirits! His one arm is pretty much useless though. My guess is that he’ll try to finish the trail sometime within the next few years hopefully. We’ll see. Right now, Water is still ahead by several days. This is the first part of the update, and I’ll post the second part tomorrow.","Campsite North of Raven Rocks

Guido,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642672,"Hello guys! I’m almost done hiking the Whites in NH! Seriously, some of the most incredible views I’ve ever seen! Pictures to come. Yesterday, I topped Mt. Washington and straight through the Presidentials. I’m super beat, and now there’s lots of rain coming from Tropical Depression Fred. I’m trying not to take any zeros because I’m still behind the others. I’m having lots of fun and I’m doing very well physically, mentally, and spiritually. I’ve been addicted to McD’s lately so . . . you know . . . I’ve been eating plenty. The trail has gotten much harder, but I’m almost done! I got off at Pinkham Notch yesterday and looking to get back on later in the morning. I’m gonna have to hike in the rain allll day today though. Thanks for your prayers and support. I’m sorry that I can’t update very often, but I promise to make sure for now on to write more often when I have a chance to. However, cell service hasn’t been great throughout the Whites and isn’t likely to get better in Maine. See y’all","

Guido,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643164,"Soooo, I finally made it to Maine!After Pinkham Notch, I had to climb the Wildcats in the rain and what a miserable steep climb that was. When I got down to Carter Notch Hut, one of the workers asked me if I wanted some leftover pasta! So, I had that, and the wet soggy footlong from Subway I had packed out that day. The next day, I hiked over 15 miles to the Rattle River trailhead on US Rt 2 and met Queen Diva. She took me back to the same hostel I stayed at a couple nights before and I saw Gone With the Wind! I haven’t been caught up with them all the way since Damascus! I took a zero the next day in Gorham and so did GWTW. We also stopped by, apparently, the last Walmart on the trail. I would’ve bought some more pulled pork in a pouch if I had known before. I headed out the next day by myself while pretty much everyone hunkered down a bit longer because of the hurricane that was supposed to come through. However, I hardly even got rain at all! GWTW actually stayed in town two extra days, so that put me two days ahead of them right off the bat. I did a 12 mile day out of Gorham, and a 4.5 the next day right across into Maine. The next day was my hardest yet. They have a good reason for calling the Mahoosic Notch the most difficult mile on the AT. It took over two and a half hours climbing over and under giant boulders while using and stretching every single body part; all at once in some parts. Then after that, you got another 1.5 mile climb straight up the Mahoosic Arm, and another mile to the shelter. I was so beat that day! The next day, Queen Diva met me at Grafton Notch with chicken salad, egg salad, Doritos, and sweet tea! I also saw a thru-hiker named Rolo and his father. I actually first met Rolo all the way back in Glasgow, VA. And saw him once again in Waynesboro. He just finished Katahdin last week! Queen Diva took me to Bethel for resupply and right back to the trail. I hiked just a couple more miles up to Baldpate Lean-to where I slept with Marlin and Quick Chuck. I took another fairly short day today and now here I am in Andover staying at the Cabin run by Honey. Just a couple more updates from some tramily. Last week, Tagalong dislocated his knee in the Mahoosic Notch. Peas and Carrots were actually able to pop it back in and he hiked his way out! Tag is back in Massachusetts taking a lot a rest at the moment. He hopes to come back. ASAP just had his surgery yesterday on his shoulder. They were able to reconnect four of his five tendons I believe, although his tongue and lips started to droop again recently. Don’t forget to keep him in your prayers! Water is a few days ahead of me, and he plans to slow down so I can catch up. I am almost to the end. I’ll send another update when I’m somewhere around Stratton",,View Entry,"Aug 26, Thu",0

I had the “joy” to summit with Gone With the Wind, and a new tramily member, Joy. It was an absolutely beautiful day to summit! Sorry for the long delay. I’m currently hanging out with my grandfather at his house here in Maine. My family is also coming up in a few days and I should be back in Knoxville around the 11th or 12th of October.
