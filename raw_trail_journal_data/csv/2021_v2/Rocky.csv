Rocky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631352,"I am going to hike the Appalachian Trail!I am sure this announcement on my Facebook page shook up my friends, but at least some of them supported me!I am a 66-year-old wife, mother, and geology professor living near Charleston, SC. The trail name ""Rocky"" is an allusion to my career, but the name actually goes back to my college days when I worked as a horse-back riding teacher at a Girl Scout camp in Pennsylvania, where I grew up. I have always wanted to hike the AT since I was a child. It is mainly because of Aunt Jane.Picnics in meadows with spring flowers and cow pies. Walks in ferny glens. Skinny dipping in cold mountain streams. Vacations on the Jersey shore. Hiking in the Swiss Alps. These are my best memories of my father's sister, Aunt Jane. She had a degree in botany from Mt. Holyoke college, way back in the day when women didn't do that. She was invariably generous, proper, polite, and patient. On the very rare occasions when she did get annoyed, her most extreme epithet was ""Well! Mercy!""She liked children, but never married or had any of her own. This worked out very well for my sister and me, because she lived nearby, and she liked spending time with us. She was constantly conspiring with my parents to take us on ""outings""- usually picnics or hikes in wild places- which we city kids absolutely adored. It was from Aunt Jane I learned how to tell Dutchman's Breeches from Bleeding Hearts. She knew a lot about birds too, and so from her I also learned how to tell ibis from egrets, pipers from plovers. Her love of nature embedded itself in our hearts, and got passed on to the next generation- my and my sister's children- as well.Aunt Jane taught me how to pee in the woods! My plan is to begin at Springer Mountain in early May 2021 as soon as I can break free from my job, then walk north as far as I can get until I return to my final year of teaching in early August. I am hoping to get as far as Harper's Ferry. Then in the summer of 2022 I will pick up where I left off and continue north to Katahdin- that is if I can get my old stiff knees and fat butt over the White Mountains!Who's coming with me?",,View Entry,"Oct 13, Tue",0
Rocky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631388,"I have begun to prepare for my AT hike next summer by taking daily training walks with my dogs on logging roads around my home. I have been working hard to increase my distance, speed, and ability to carry weight. I still have a long way to go, but at present I can carry 35 pounds about 1.5 miles quickly and easily without breaking a sweat. I haven’t lost any weight, but my legs feel much stronger. (The dogs are getting stronger too, but I won’t be taking them on the AT. They are just accompanying me for fun.)

The bad and the ugly: It is still quite hot here on the South Carolina coastal plain, and the humidity is quite oppressive at times. I don’t mind the heat too much, but the bugs that come with it are hard to cope with. Gnats, mosquitoes, and deer flies follow me in a big cloud, and attempt to get in my eyes, ears, and mouth, or suck my blood.  I have actually taken to wearing ear plugs to keep them out! From what I understand in my reading, this is good preparation for the trail in June and July!

Deer hunting season here is very long, so when the weather is nice the hunters come out, and I have to be careful where I go to avoid becoming a target. Brightly colored clothing is good, but I worry about the dogs. 
The terrain is very flat, so I am not building up any hill-climbing muscles. It is also close to sea level and poorly drained, so there are always wet spots to avoid or swamps to splash through.

The worst thing are what I call the trip vines! Blackberry and grapevines grow across the roads a few inches above the dirt. They hide in the grass just waiting for me to catch a foot and do a face plant! At least the footing is soft sand, so I don’t get hurt when this happens. Just annoyed!

The good: The logging roads are not being used by vehicles, so the dogs have complete freedom to run around and sniff things to their doggy delight. The wet spots and swamps give them great cooling-off places! In the spring there will be blackberries and grapes! Cooler weather is coming soon! Hunting season will be over someday!

My favorite thing about our logging roads is that there are some really pretty shady stretches with ferns and wildflowers! I enjoy looking up the seasonal flowers and trying to identify the critter footprints in the sand. When the hunters come out I can change things up by walking in a nearby state park (Santee) which has some lovely trails and a large lake.

Rocky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631588,"Oh, it was glorious! My daughter and I, plus the two pups, took a blitz weekend trip to the mountains of North Carolina (Pisgah state forest). There were falling leaves and beautiful autumn colors! There were no bugs! There were pleasant daytime temperatures! There were lovely hilly trails everywhere!

We took one full day for a strenuous 10-mile loop hike up and over Cedar Rock Mountain. We saw a bald eagle soaring below us! It rained, but just enough to cool us off. It was quite the challenge getting the dogs down off Cedar Rock, which is a bit of a scramble. My favorite way of getting down is to butt-scootch while holding onto branches and roots, but the dogs were having none of it. We had to scruff them and haul them down over the slippery wet rocks while supporting their weight. The dog that is usually our athlete turned out to be panicky, struggling against us and trying to escape back up. The other un-athletic dog with bad hips did just fine once he got the hang of it. It was quite the surprise turnaround!

Things I learned on this hike: 1) lightweight running shorts were not designed for butt-scootching over rocks. I need to get something sturdier! 2) If I don’t drink enough water I get horrible leg cramps at night. 3) Dogs can’t hold onto branches. 4) Bear boxes are not ant-proof. 5) The one corner of the tent that leaks after heavy rain is the same one I happen to put all my stuff in. 6) Swishing through crunchy leaves is good for the soul. 7) My arthritic knees did not bother me in the least. 8) I love trail runners and will never wear heavy hiking boots again!

Rocky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632225,"I won’t lie that the end of 2020 was rough. My husband of almost 30 years lost his battle with colon cancer and passed away December 14. During his decline I took on the role of full-time caretaker. It was depressing and exhausting, especially toward the end. I am glad he is out of pain now, but the house sure seems lonesome and empty without him.
My three kids (in their twenties) came to town for their father’s funeral and stayed for Christmas too! I very much enjoyed their company. 
My youngest son and daughter and I, plus the two pups, spent the first week of January in a cabin at Oconee State Park, SC, to do some mountain hiking. We went to lots of places, but my favorite walks were along the Chattooga River Trail. Here the river is in a deep gorge which forms the border between South Carolina and Georgia. There are huge rocks, sandy beaches, rhododendron thickets, rapids, pools, and waterfalls! I was impressed that the water was so very clean, as was the trail. 
I learned some useful things on our hikes. I found that I could keep up with my twenty-something kids OK on level ground and downhill, but going uphill I just couldn’t get enough air! I don’t know if it was the elevation (I live close to sea level), that I am out of shape, or just old (I am 67). Probably all three! I did, however, remember the many times that I had to wait for them when they were small! But I can see that it will take me a while to acclimate to the AT when the time comes. 
I also learned that if I put powdered electrolytes in my water bottle I don’t get muscle cramps at night. And I learned to give close attention to filing down my thick toenails, or I pay for it with blisters on the adjoining toes. 
Now it is time to dive back into my teaching job full time until the semester ends May 1. I plan to drive to Gainesville May 2, and my brother-in-law will shuttle me to Amacalola on May 3. Can’t wait!",,View Entry,"Jan 09, Sat",0
Rocky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633545,"Things are slowly falling into place for my Big Walk as I count down the weeks! 
I have read numerous books about other people who have hiked the AT. I have followed Facebook AT groups and gotten lots of great tips and advice. I have purchased my equipment and refined it some. I have tried out my camping stuff in the back yard and learned some useful things (example: sleep is impossible if the dogs have an armadillo trapped under the porch)! I have gone back and forth about taking or not taking a dog, and finally reluctantly confirmed my decision to leave them at home (although I will sure miss them). I have been walking every day as fast as I can with a fully loaded pack, as much as I can spare the time from my job. At work I have been going up and down the stairs a lot to build up my hill-climbing muscles, since there are no hills here on the coastal plain.

Best of all, God has provided me not only with a farm sitter (a major concern) but a hiking buddy! She is my age and lives nearby, and we have already met several times for lunch. We have a lot in common and are off to a great start! We already have a room booked at Amicalola May 2, and a ride to Springer May 3.

So here is the Big Idea. Since I am a geologist, naturally I looked up books about the geology of the AT. There is only one: Underfoot; A Geologic Guide to the Appalachian Trail, by V. Collins Chew, 1988. This book is comprehensive and very detailed, but in my opinion it is not a read for anyone without a geologic educational background.  I happen to make my living teaching “beginner” geology to college freshmen. So wouldn’t it be really cool to have a phone app sort of like Guthooks (who wants to carry a book on the trail?) as a geologic guide to the AT for the average hiker with no geologic background? Yes!!! Maybe I can do this!!

Rocky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636208,"I finally made it to Georgia! My buddy ""Oledeborah"" and I spent a night at the Amicolola Lodge. I got to see the big waterfall, and looked around the West Ridge Trail for the rocks mentioned in my Roadside Guide to the Geology of Georgia. What a thrill that was! Coming from the SC coastal plain, where we don't even have rocks, I held in my hand a granite gneiss over 1 billion years old!!!! South Carolina wasn't even there when that rock was part of a large mountain chain that formed way before the Appalachians, and now is largely eroded away.The next morning we were shuttled by ""Paul"" up to the Springer Mountain parking lot, where we could hike a short mile up to the summit of Springer Mountain and the southern terminus of the Appalachian Trail. What a thrill! The Georgia woods are just beginning to show signs of spring. Wildflowers were everywhere! Parts of the forest were covered with violets! There were lots of hikers doing the same. We passed people every 10 or 15 minutes. Some were just out for the day and very curious about us.","

Rocky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636268,"The first day was lovely but exhausting! I trained well for this adventure as far as carrying a pack, but since I live on the coastal plain of SC I found the constant ups and downs very challenging. All the same I really enjoyed the spring wildflowers! Trilliums, violets, dwarf crested iris, cliff saxifrage, and many other beauties cover the forest floor right now.  There was a lovely walk down a rhododendron tunnel next to a rushing stream. At Three Forks a young couple out for the day was holding their young infant up high over the bridge with water tumbling below, so I sang the Lion King song for them!  Another family just out for the day had a bunch of kids along who were clearly enjoying themselves and asked a lot of questions.I had a tough slog up Hawk Mountain to the campground where I spent the night. It was pretty miserable because it rained, and the muscle cramps kept me awake. All the same, there is nowhere else I'd rather be right now. At Hightower gap my trail buddy and I decided to get into town to wait out severe storms. God is good!","Springer trail head

Rocky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636626,"After the storms were past we began walking at Hightower Gap where we had left. It was pretty tough going with lots of steep ups and downs. My hiking buddy felt ill, got off the trail at one of the gaps, and hired a shuttle back to her car. I was saddened and lonesome after that.The high point of my day was running into a professional contact on the trail! I think we were both equally astounded! I camped all by myself at Justus Creek. I had two scares: I somehow managed to suck the air out of my squashy Katadyn BeFree water filter, which made it completely non- functional due to vapor lock. I also struck my Bic lighter with a wet thumb, rendering the flint useless. So no hot supper and no filtered water! Fortunately both issues resolved themselves by the following morning. The next day I continued on to Woody Gap, and found a sweet stealth campsite about 1/2 mile beyond. A stranger gave me an orange at the Woody Gap parking area! A hummingbird came up close and personal! Trail magic!I am having major problems eating! I have to force myself to eat. I brought all this heavy food and have barely made a dent in it!God is good!","

The next morning it was so windy I gave up trying to light the stove, and ate a cold breakfast. I felt rather weak and dizzy later, so maybe that was a bad idea. The day was lovely though! I got passed by many 20-something hikers, so I felt like an old Granny. I am really not able to handle more than 5 or 6 miles per day, which is disappointing. The terrain is very difficult!I passed through Gooch Gap and heard from my hiking buddy! She took a few days off and rejoined me at Jarrad Gap for the short hike up to Woods Hole trail shelter, where we spent the night with a few other hikers. It was windy and very cold! I slept in ALL my clothes! The next day we hiked together again up and over Blood Mountain. That was really fun! It was Saturday, so there were lots of other day hikers there who we enjoyed talking with. The views were awesome both to the East and West! I am feeling stronger now too. We got down off Blood Mountain to Neels Gap. It was jarring to go from days of nothing but birdsong and wind to big crowds of tourists and motorcycle gangs! We are taking today off to rest and resupply. I am delighted to report that my feet are doing wonderfully. This is the very first long hike of my life where they have given me absolutely zero problems.God is good!","

Rocky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636957,"We hiked seven miles today from Neels Gap to Hogpen Gap. It took us ten hours!!!! We hiked up and down four mountains: Levelland, Wolf Laurel Top, Cowrock, and one unnamed. There was almost no level ground at all, just constant slogging up steep rocks and roots or carefully picking our way down over steep rocks and roots! It was exhausting! The last mile was the worst! Straight uphill!  Deb's car was parked at Hogpen Gap, and we were so tired we could not resist the short drive down the mountain into Helen, Georgia where we got a cheap room and a delicious meal.The next day we promised ourselves shorter miles, so we hiked from Hogpen Gap only five miles over Poor Mountain and Sheep Rock Flat to the Low Gap shelter. The forecast was promising rain that night, so lots of other hikers had the same idea. What a fun crowd was there! I loved joking around with the other ""young whippersnappers"" as well as an older couple who were hiking at more my speed. One  burly 30-something dude, ""A-Train"", had actually photographed the exact same flowers that I had, and was as deeply interested in identifying them as I was!God is good!","

I have a small lightweight umbrella which served me well except for the rhododendron tunnels, where it would hang up. We decided to head for the next shelter, Blue Mountain, a seven mile walk. The first three miles was an easy upgrade along an old logging road. I SO enjoyed this!!! Finally I could happily stride out, rain notwithstanding! The rain and grey mists made all of the spring colors around me just that much more intense.The millipedes seemed to be enjoying the rain as well. There was one every 100 paces or so. Most were bright yellow and brown, but the fellow in the photo was a lovely rosey color.Closer to Blue Mountain there were a few stretches of trail that were really difficult. Perhaps there was an old burn there, but the soil was thin and the trees few. The trail just went over bare rocks of all sizes and positioned at crazy angles. And they were wet and slippery too!We found the same jovial crowd of hikers at Blue Mountain shelter, and enjoyed their company just as much.

The shelter was in a lovely flat spot at the top of Tray. We could watch both the sunset AND the sunrise from our tents! The best treat was the chorus of veeries who serenaded us right around dark. I haven't heard that beautiful haunting flute-like song for many years! To top it off, I got a good sighting of a Baltimore Oriole the next morning.
The next day was an eight mile hike from Tray Gap to Deep Gap. It was lovely until the last 2 miles, where it took me 2 hours to ascend Kelly Knob, and one hour back down the far side. I reached camp about 5pm. It was a beautiful spot, and my friends ""Mamamo"" and ""Papamo"" were there. They told me about the hostel coming up, so I decided to try it out.","

At the gap I got picked up by a shuttle from Round-the-Bend hostel. It was my first experience with a hostel, and lots of fun! They sure know what hikers want! As soon as you walk in they hand you a towel, point you to the shower, give you loaner clothes, and show you the laundry room. After you get cleaned up they run you to the grocery store to resupply.  After a jolly evening with wine flowing (nearby brewery) I slept in a bunk room with 5 other tired hikers.
For the first time I got a good look at myself in the mirror since I started this adventure. I have lost so much belly fat that I have a waist again!! First time in over 25 years since I had children! Not only that, I have found that my sense of smell has sharpened greatly. I can be up to 20 feet behind a day hiker and catch whiffs of dryer sheets, deodorant, and detergent!

The walk up was not steep, but difficult because of small rocks rolling underfoot. I began to notice increasing pain in my right heel. The path down the north side of the mountain was very pleasant! Between thick groves of dead mountain laurel ( what killed it?) lay a grassy path laden with more bluets than I have ever seen in my life! Nine miles later we reached Beech Gap, where we pitched camp for the night. The next morning we continued north. The walking would have been lovely, but I couldn't enjoy it because of increasing pain in my heel. Every step hurt! My trail companions got farther and farther ahead as pain slowed my progress. As we neared the end of the day we approached Albert Mountain, known to be a difficult climb. My buddies had continued up and over to the next shelter.  I felt that I couldnt make it before dark, and didn't want to tackle a difficult climb in my current state. I considered camping by myself at Bearpen Gap, when along came another hiking friend riding down the mountain in an SUV, who offered me a ride down into Franklin NC for the night!

If  there is improvement then I will come back to the store for more supportive shoes.
I am happy to take a few days off the trail at this point. You gotta love a town with a yarn shop and a bookstore right next to an outdoor outfitters! I went and got me some sock yarn to work up while I am here, and also some books to read. The yarn is absolutely beautiful!

Over the next few days I gradually regained the ability to walk without pain, and hobbled around town. I purchased new, more supportive trail runners and mailed the old ones home. I got to the local grocery store for some microwave dinners and other supplies. I enjoyed getting to know some of the other hikers. The guy running the hostel was pretty laid back and quiet, but as I got to know him he proved to be a highly entertaining source of stories from the trail and about the subculture of hikers. I have a lot of respect for him and his job now. Not only did he have to spend most of his days doing laundry and cleaning the place, he had to collect money from the clients and constantly provide information about shuttles to the trail and where to find food, banks, hiking supplies, and etc. He also had to be a psychologist of sorts, and screen people who turned up at the hostel: not just the hikers but the homeless, drunks, and vagrants. My heart went out to some of these people, and I did not envy the owner as he had to turn them away. It helped me understand how sheltered my life has been.","

The terrain was forgiving and the weather cool and breezy! A highlight of the day was the lookout tower at Wayah Bald with spectacular views. And to add icing to the cake there was a bear-proof trash can, a hiker's treasure! (We are expected to carry out all of our trash, and it does get to be burdensome). Ah, the simple joys of hiking life!Many people passed me on the trail. They were coming up to Cold Spring shelter in droves for the start of Memorial Day weekend. I knew that thunder showers were expected for that night, and since the shelter had space for only six people, I lost hope of getting a spot. (Normally I prefer to put up my tent close to a shelter so that I can use the picnic table and nearby water source and privy, but still avoid the snoring people and inevitable mice. But I prefer all of these things to packing up a sopping tent in the rain.) As it turned out there was only one other dude in the shelter, and plenty of space for me! The others, including a troop of boy scouts, had put up their tents on the ridge above. Well rain in abundance it did, with high winds, thunder, lightning, and darkness! The other guy and I joked about how long it would be until the boy scouts came down off the ridge and dived into the shelter, but they stuck it out! We sure felt sorry for them though. The next day was beautiful, and I intended to hike down to Tellico Gap and then up to Wesser Bald. My bad foot was feeling great, but as I walked I began to be alarmed by increasing pain in my OTHER foot! Apparently the good foot broke down from the burden of supporting the bad foot! Ugh! I knew that my original trail buddy Deb had been supportive, so on a hunch I texted her. She was relatively nearby at her cabin in NC and available. She came to pick me up at Tellico gap and drove me to her cabin. More serendipity!","

I'm taking a vacation from my vacation! If all goes well I would like to resume walking the AT north about the middle of June. I am thinking that, as eager as I am to hike the Smokies, it would probably be a better plan to skip them for now and pick up the trail around Hot Springs NC where the terrain is much more forgiving, and where help getting off the trail will be more available should I need it. The Smokies will still be there later in the summer or even next year, and one or more of my (grown) kids may be able to hike with me if we plan ahead. God is good!","

Rocky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646377,"Well, here's an update. Last summer I unhappily suspended my hike after 130 miles due to a stress fracture in my heel. While I had my foot in an orthopedic boot, I took advantage of the time off to fly around the country and visit friends and family in Dallas, Denver, Spokane, and Lancaster Pa. That was so much fun! Toward the end of the summer my foot had healed enough to take some short hikes. I even got back to the AT in Pennsylvania and did a two-mile section along the Conodoguinet Creek. On that day, what a thrill it was for this geologist to step from the Ordovician Martinsburg shale onto Triassic volcanic rocks!Today I started training for AT Phase 2. I loaded up the big old Osprey pack with pillows, bags of cat food, and miscellaneous small weighty items, and took it for a walk. I had less than 20 pounds in it, but it felt like 50! Need to get those trail legs back! I have time.The plan is to retire from my college teaching job in May. A friend and I are going to start at Harper's Ferry and hike south. My friend's wife, who likes to camp but doesn't care for hiking, is going to slack pack us through the Shenandoahs. Yeah, bring it on! After my friends leave I will continue south until the hot weather becomes too much, or perhaps even until I get back to where I had to stop in NC last summer, if I get that far. But once I'm retired it will be so wonderful to have the flexibility to go back to the AT in the fall. Wouldn't the Smokies be breathtaking in September???God is good!","

Rocky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650902,"The hike south begins! We crossed the Shenandoah River yesterday, climbed out of the river gorge, and hiked south close to the WV/VA border. My first impression is how the woods in Virginia differ so much from the Georgia mountains. Here things are quite dry and the soils thin. Wildflowers, which were so verdant in Georgia, are sparse here so far. The Georgia forests had a deep rich odor of earth and balsam. The Virginia woods smell more like moldering paper. We are never completely away from traffic sounds here, although it is far away.On the other hand my trail companions are pleasant company. We have seen many deer, which are larger than otheir southern cousins, and very tame. No bears yet, but I have high hopes. The weather has been excellent! I pass 20-30 hikers going north every day, but only one southbounder so far.God is good!","

Rocky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650966,"Yesterday we climbed up from the Blackburn Trail Center and entered the ""Roller Coaster"", a section of trail known for its steep rocky ups and downs. My trail companion's wife was carrying our big packs in the car, so we had only our lunch and water to carry (this is known as "" slackpacking""). In spite of this I had a very hard day and got discouraged. A candy bar improved my attitude and helped me get up that last steep climb of the day.
Today was rainy and longer and steeper, but I really enjoyed myself! Perhaps my muscles are adjusting to the strain, or perhaps I am sleeping better, but I felt stronger today. I am seeing lots more wildflowers now, which makes me very happy! 
I have noticed that at least in this section of the mountains, all of the stream crossings are on old debris flows. These happen when floodwaters combine with rocks and flow down their valleys like wet concrete, tearing out trees. The link below will show you one in progress.

Immediately the trail leveled out some, and the walking became much more pleasant with soft footing on dirt and duff. There were quite a few tricky stream crossings. Birds and wildflowers were plentiful. The forest smelled heavenly! It rained most of the afternoon, but I didn't much mind because it cooled me off. I miss the rhododendron tunnels that were so common in Georgia, but perhaps we aren't high enough. 
Today we planned a short four mile day because we had a long climb up to Sky Meadows State Park. I thought it would be a struggle, but it turned out to be absolutely delightful! The path was smooth and not at all rocky. It was steep at the start, but the last mile or so was a gentle upgrade through open meadows with profuse birds and wildflowers. Absolutely lovely! This is also the first day where there was no noise from traffic and lawn mowers. We met one more Southbounder today, ""Flat Top"".

What an interesting fellow! 
I am beginning to see my first volcanic rocks of the Catoctin Greenstone Formation! More about that some other time.
Today we had a nice break from the usual deep forest and crossed some old farmland with meadows of buttercup, violets, daisies, mayapples, and yes, your favorite and mine, multiflora rose and poison ivy! There were also pretty little brooks, bridges, and gates.

Steep inclines were carefully cut into steps. We ate lunch at Jenkins shelter with a middle aged woman from Rhode Island who was carrying a lot of fresh vegetables. We summited Compton Peak. I began to see some higher elevation birds and wildflowers such as the veery and wood betony. I had a very close encounter with an American Redstart too!
Today began with a long tough slog up and over Mt. Marshall. The top was at about 3300 feet, and the trees there had not yet leafed out!

Also at the top was red granite, the first I've seen. There was a sign for a ""launch site"" there-- for what? Rockets? Hang gliders? Paper airplanes? There followed a long level stretch of trail that went through the first pine trees I've seen since we started. It was very pleasant. We met my trail buddy's wife for lunch at Elkwallow Wayside, a small store and gift shop with a picnic area and bathrooms on Skyline Drive. I bought an iced coffee there! Such a treat!
For dinner we invited some camping neighbors over for a shared meal. Sally and Jhin (sp?) are Chinese immigrants from Canada, and are on a travel vacation. The food was simple fare, but great fun!
Today was a short day because it was freakishly hot even for the mountains. I was very uncomfortable on the two climbs, although there was a lovely flat stretch. Since I am rather prone to heat stroke we decided to opt out of climbing up Pass Mountain (a gain of 1200 feet!) and take the afternoon off. My hiking buddy and his wife are shortly headed back to Charleston SC, so from now on I will be on my own and carrying a heavy pack with tent and sleeping bag.

I could also see rain moving in, so I pressed on to Byrd's Nest shelter. Good thing, too, because it rained all night long and then some. It was cold too! There were eight of us in the shelter that night, all college kids and thru-hikers. It was quite a jolly crowd. I wonder if having ""Grandma"" (me) there dampened their spirits?
Today was damp and foggy the whole day. It was cold too! I climbed Pinnacle Mountain and Stony Man Mountain. I'm sure the views from both were first rate, but all I saw was the inside of a cloud. I had intended to press on 11 miles to the next shelter, but the call of a hot shower and warm dry bed was too hard to resist, so I booked a cozy cabin at Skyland Resort.

I had lunch at the Rock Springs hut where a very friendly deer came up to me and begged for treats. The scree field (photo) was challenging to cross and very scary! 
Today I topped Hazeltop Mountain (3804 feet) and Bearfence Mountain. The morning walk was soft, level, and delightful through fields of wet ferns. For the afternoon I tried plugging in my earphones for some music. It really helped me to forget how tired my legs were!

The morning brought more heavy rain and thunder. I hiked about 1.5 miles in the storm to the Timber Mountain camp store. I had been planning a day off in Elkton for the night, and decided to get out of Dodge a bit early. A shuttle brought me to a hostel where the guests stay in a barn- Small Axe Farms. I have a pigsty below me, and barn swallows come and go! There is also a place to hang out with sofas, a simple kitchen and bathroom, and family-style meals for a small extra cost. Such a sweet change from the wet sodden trail! 
I spent the following day doing a bit of shopping in Elkton and playing with the hostel owner's kids on the farm. I taught the five year old to play ""Deep and Wide"" on the ukulele!

The climb up High Top Mountain was long and sweaty, but I took it slow. The shelter of the same name was packed, and all the tent sites were taken. I managed to squeeze in, but didn't sleep well because of the slippery slope and rocks under the tent. I was amazed and delighted to see an Amish family camping there! 
Pinefield shelter was an eight mile hike. This is the farthest I've gone with the big pack, so I was glad the trail was not terribly rough or steep. Water was hard to come by today and I got pretty thirsty. It was very hot, and the two moderate climbs I had were quite sweaty.
in the morning I left Pinefoeld Hut an old timer trail maintenance fude turned up.  He seemed  to be looking  for conversation with hikers. He was not dissapointed.

The trail down from Loft Mountain was very easy walking, although it was still hot. The summit of BlackRock Mountain was amazing! A huge pile of jumbled rocks no doubt a result of the Ice Age!

Unfortunately the hikers were of the party hard kind, so I am glad to be back in the relatively quiet woods.
I decided, for several reasons, to bypass the last 20 or so miles of Shenandoah National Park and continue south from Rockfish Gap toward Roanoke. The next stage of my journey will be eight days of tough trail, with my next break in Buena Vista. But so far today's trail was quite pleasant and easy walking with plenty of water available, and cool breezes. I was delighted to spot my first chipmunk and a clump of lush maidenhair fern.

I had to pick my way over and around many large rocks at all angles. It was slow, painstaking, and tiring.

Rusty is an 83-year-old who has run a well known hostel for many years. His place has electricity, but no running water or indoor plumbing. He has lots of stories about hikers and his life experiences. I found it interesting that he lived several years as an Amish person in Pennsylvania. Unfortunately Rusty, who has a no-alcohol policy at his hostel, can't compete with the brewery nearby (where I had that hamburger last night) with it's restaurant, hot showers and flowing alcohol.
