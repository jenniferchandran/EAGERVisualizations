Iron Grape,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632347,"New Years Eve and we are celebrating the end of what had been collectively the strangest year of our lives. Prior to the countdown, Derek begins to ask me if, for his 50th birthday, I would be up for...I cut him off. ""Yes, of course. Whatever you want to do! I'm in!"". Then he finished his sentence by saying he wanted to hike the Appalachian Trail. In it's entirety. Undaunted, we continued the evening recklessly planning and strengthening our resolve over excessive libations, all under the watchful and rolling eyes of our unimpressed spouses.The next day, with a clearer head, I started to add to my very limited knowledge of the 'AT'. That's when the reality of what we were talking about set in. Without preamble, I committed to hiking 2,189 miles through 14 states over the course of 15+ years in 100-150 mile segments and climbing the 5,269 ft. summit of Mt. Katahdin with 60+ yr-old legs. If all went according to plan. Yep, that sounds like me.After recovering from the initial shock of the enormity of it all, the journey began to come into focus and I somehow found myself more committed to seeing this through than the previous evening. This adventure checks all the boxes for me. It's an admirable test physically, emotionally, and spiritually on any scale, and an opportunity to break away from the modern world to reconnect with nature and myself. I could feel my excitement growing more by the minute. Only 3 weeks after committing, I've read 2 books and countless articles, purchased most of my gear, and have begun training. With a bit of luck, we'll be on the trail in late May, Northbound, taking our first steps on the adventure of a lifetime. ",,View Entry,"Jan 21, Thu",0
Iron Grape,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633217,"Our dates are set for the beginning of our journey. We'll depart Tuesday, May 18th for Atlanta, take a shuttle to Amicalola Falls State Park, and take the 8.8 mile approach trail to sign the registration book atop Springer Mountain. Our goal is to reach the parking lot at Deep Gap by Monday morning and return home from there. 94.8 total miles and 88.6 AT miles if all goes well. We are anxious to get started!",,View Entry,"Mar 13, Sat",0
Iron Grape,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636785,"We are one week out from our first section hike and still couldn't be any more excited. All the gear has been selected, treated, and packed, so there's really nothing left to do but wait for our flight next Tuesday and post the obligatory pre-hike decisions and statistics:

Pack weight w/o food is 27.2 lbs plus 16 lbs of food for the 7 day/6 night adventure.
Backpack is the Osprey Atmos AG 65, and yes, it's full. 
I'm going long sleeve shirt and pants, mostly for tick prevention, but also to keep the insect bites and trail scratches to a minimum. 
I have a new pair of Asics Gel-Venture 7 running shoes and Darn Tough wool socks. 
ALPS Mountaineering Lynx 1-person tent, sleeping bag, and inflatable sleeping pad.
Sawyer Squeeze water filtration system; Trekology collapsible trekking poles; Ka-Bar tactical spork
Ursack Major XL bear bag with Opsaks baggies for odor control
7 ounces of Makers Mark and 1 bottle of my homemade port
Over 130 miles of walking to train since March (but certain to gain more elevation on the first day of our hike than I've seen all year)

Our plan is to cover 88.6 miles on the trail as well as the 8.8 mile approach trail in Amicolola Falls state park. We'll more or less hop from shelter to shelter to stop for lunch or stop for the evening, though a hostel stay at Neel's Gap is an option. If all goes according to plan, we'll get picked up at the Deep Gap parking lot Monday morning for our flight home. My next entry will be after our section hike and hopefully will include lots of good photos!",,View Entry,"May 11, Tue",0
Iron Grape,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637993,"After 5 months of endless planning, decision making, and dreaming, we finally began our journey early afternoon on Tuesday, May 18th. To summarize, it was harder than expected, but just as beautiful and certainly more rewarding than imagined. From the start, the trail is seldom flat or straight. It seemingly always traverses up and down, no matter if it is ascending or descending in overall elevation. The terrain is paved by dust, gravel, mud, tree roots, and the ancient rock that forms the mountain chain, often all within a single half mile. It meanders. It switches back. It pointlessly gains and loses altitude. It negotiates forest, meadows, streams, roads, valleys and mountaintops, seemingly providing a new experience around every corner. It is somehow both challenging and peaceful.
 

We fell short of our goal in terms of overall miles due to several factors, but achieved our main objective; to meet and understand the challenge facing us over the next several years. Below is a more detailed account of the trip day-by-day. At the end of each day, I borrowed an idea from Chris Cage, author of How to Hike the Appalachian Trail, by ending each day with the Rose, Bud, Thorn exercise. In short, rose represents a positive aspect of the day, bud represents something learned or potentially promising, and thorn represents something I could do without or use some help with. It was a great way to reflect on the day and capture a some of the defining moments.

 

May 18th - 24th, 2021

Tuesday, May 18

Our 6:25am flight to Atlanta had us up at 3:30am. We had a good flight, then took MARTA to the North Springs station to meet with Survivor Dave, our shuttle service to Amicolola Falls. After a few stops and another hiker pick-up (Juggs), Survivor Dave dropped us off at the visitor center so we could sign in the registry book. We said our goodbyes, snapped a few pictures, and were on our way by noon.

 

The Amicolola Falls approach trail way was way more difficult than expected. The first section of the approach trail was closed due to wash out, so the first mile+ was hiked on the Eastern Ridge trail, which was straight uphill on loose rock. After we rejoined the trail, we encountered a sign that said Springer Mountain, 7.5 miles, Activity Level: Strenuous, and I can definitely concur. It was a rough but enjoyable initial hike outside of both of my quads cramping up causing us to take multiple breaks. Still, we made it atop Springer Mountain, passed our first white blaze, and made it to the shelter by 4:30pm. 
 

At the shelter, we met 3 nice guys section hiking from Johnson City, TN and Hitch, who is through-hiking the Benton Mackaye trail. We slept in our tents as we would for the remainder of the trip and while it was not at all breezy on top of Springer Mountain, the wind howled all night, sounding like waves crashing on a nearby beach. 
 

I learned that 2L water was not enough for the 9-mile uphill climb, and that the trekking poles I purchased were a godsend. I was actually on the fence about purchasing trekking poles, but I am now a firm believer in them.

 

Rose: The first white blaze

Bud: Can move at a slower pace

Thorn: 2000 ft elevation change to start trip

 

Wednesday, May 19th 
The first 5 or so miles leaving Springer Mountain were enjoyable and we were back to moving at an unreasonable speed. The elevation climbs are tough, but so are rapid descents, and we are constantly moving up and down on very rocky terrain. I thought we were lost for a moment when only the white diamonds were appearing from the Benton Mackaye trail, but it turned out we simply missed a faded white blaze behind another tree branch. Although I thought I learned a lesson from the day prior, 4L of water was still not quite enough and I find I need to fill up more than once in the morning. We stopped for our first lunch out on the trail and I’m happy to find my PB&J tacos are heavenly.

 

After lunch we tackled Hawk Mountain before descending into Cooper's Gap and following a fairly pleasant trail to the Gooch Mountain shelter, where I’m all too pleased to get off of my feet. We hiked over 16 miles and I jammed my right middle toe so hard along the way that I’m certain I will lose the nail. My entire body feels sore, specifically my legs, back, and shoulders, and I discuss with Derek adjusting our schedule based off soreness, the big elevation climbs, and desire to enjoy the trail more than just tackling physical challenges. He agrees to a more modest goal for the next day, and a day-by-day approach going forward. The campsite is fairly nice and the cold water from the creek feels great on my aching feet, but no cell service is available, so no call home or picture sharing for the evening.

 

Rose: Over 16 miles and at a more manageable pace

Bud: Today isn't yesterday

Thorn: Jammed toe

 

Thursday, May 20th

It’s a shorter day with only 8.3 miles and a 2:30pm stop. We would make it a longer day, but bear canisters are required for overnight stays for next 12+ miles, so the Lance Creek campsite just outside the bear cannister zone is the safest bet. My legs need a break anyway. My left knee started aching on the descents and was getting worse as the day went on. 
 

There was some enjoyable walking today with great views. Ramrock Mountain provided fabulous views as did Preacher Rock just after Woody's Gap. We moved at a slower pace throughout the day for less stress on body and fewer miles to cover. The pace and distance certainly help with recovery, which will be needed with a challenging day in front of us tomorrow. I take a quick bath in the creek and it feels amazing, as does the opportunity to call home and check in.

 

Rose: The 2 amazing views from the vistas

Bud: More tortoise and less hare

Thorn: Blister on the bottom of my left foot

 

Friday, May 21st

We depart early from camp, choosing to do a 3.8 mile hike before breakfast. We climbed Gaddis Mountain, took a breakfast break outside of Woods Shelter, then attacked Blood Mountain. It has the highest elevation of the trip, and beautiful scenery up top, but it’s a tough descent all the way down to Neel Gap. The Mountain Crossing Outfitters at Neel Gap is a great stop, where I bought a few souvenirs and we ate lunch on the patio overlooking yet another beautiful forest valley. We encounter an unexpectedly tough up and down out of Neel Gap and up Levelland Mountain before stopping at Baggs Creep Gap campsite for the night. For at least the second night in a row, we camp near Leapfrog, Lifesaver, and Happy, 3 individual hikers who we consistently cross paths with. 
 

Rose: Great climb up Blood Mountain

Bud: Crossed the threshold of Neel Gap

Thorn: Another new blister and left knee causing old man descent

*The weather has been phenomenal to this point, and will remain so for the rest of the trip.

 

Saturday, May 22nd

Another early start with a steep climb to start up Cowrock Mountain and a beautiful view. We almost stopped for breakfast, but it was still a little early and we had only traveled less than a mile at that point. We encounter a steep decline down to Tenastee Gap for breakfast where we ate like hobos along the side of the road on a rock. From a landscape perspective, it’s a far cry from Cowrock or Blood Mountain, but sometimes you just have to take what the trail gives you.

 

Immediately following breakfast was another steep incline up Wildcat Mountain, which was surprisingly difficult, but then transcended into a pleasant path of easy, enjoyable hiking before descending to Low Gap Shelter. Low Gap was hard to find off the trail, but a nice spot once we found it. Spent more time there relaxing, cleaning up creek style and doing some light laundering while eating lunch and talking to Happy. Left early afternoon for peaceful 1.4 mile walk to campsite.

 

I contacted Survivor Dave for extraction plans and he throws us a curveball, effectively changing our plans for the remainder of the trip. Our new plan makes tomorrow's 8.3 mile hike to Unicoi Gap our last hike for the trip, where we’ll exit the trail at Unicoi, head to Helen, GA and spend the night in a hotel room. That made the last night on the trail the party night where we actually made a fire for the first time, drank the rest of the alcohol, and smoked the cigars we were saving for Sunday night. It was a great 4+ hours of just camping along the trail, having the entire site to ourselves, and only seeing 3 other hikers pass by.

 

Rose: Most pleasant hiking section yet

Bud: New thoughts on exercise routine

Thorn: Survivor Dave going from ""I'll pick you up anywhere you exit the trail"" to ""You have 2 choices, Unicoi or Dicks Creek, 17 miles further out""

 

Sunday, May 23rd

Again, we get an early start to the day with plans of covering a few miles before stopping for breakfast. Unfortunately, the trail had other plans for us. Our campsite did not have a water source and while the guide highlights a “cascade of streams” less than a half mile from our camp, we find a questionable mud puddle that was all too easy to step over and ignore. After some debate, we press on hoping that we have yet to uncover the source of fresh water we need for breakfast (and survival of course). We cover another mile before running into another pair of hikers who mention there is a water source 0.8 miles away at Chattahoochee Gap, but we only find another trail leading to water a half mile off the trail. Hoping to find water on the trail and not wanting to walk further than necessary, especially with no guarantee of water at the end of the spur, we marched on. 
 

Through the entire morning hike, we travel through the most diverse trail to date. We’ve encountered all new fauna and forest, with the overall experience changing nearly every half mile, showcasing meadows, green tunnels, subtropical plants, and dark, craggy, barren trees. Parts of the hike are as pleasant as we’ve experienced, but the depleting water supply and lack of upcoming water sources brings concern. The gloom is further highlighted by a steep rock and boulder-covered trail up Blue Mountain where we are the only ones on the trail. Finally, 6 miles into our morning and devoid of any water, we find a small creek that serves as the water source for the Blue Mountain shelter. 
 

We stop at the shelter for breakfast and a bit of a break, and find Jim, a retired army vet, setting up in the shelter for another nights’ stay. He’s anxious to tell us that he chose to stay at the shelter another night because of the lack of varmints, but at least one mouse is easily detectable and fearless of the 3 humans in close proximity.  

 

We push through the last 2.3 miles of our hike which ends in a somewhat steep descension into Unicoi Gap where we hire Grace to take us to Helen for the evening. Helen is a quaint tourist town adorned with German food and Bavarian-style buildings, and more importantly, has plenty of hotel rooms available with hot showers and comfy beds. Grace has to drive with the windows down because the bathing in the creek can only do so much, and our clothes bare witness to overall exertion 5 days and 61.3 miles of mountain hiking requires. 
 

Fresh out of the shower, it’s a hot meal and cold beers at Big Daddy’s, a margarita at La Cabana, and a sixer of Terrapin Moo-Hoo from the package store before settling in for some hockey and a night of good sleep.

 
Overall, it was a challenging but fun experience. I’m happy with all of my gear choices to date, and thankful for the various lessons we took away on this first section. We’ll definitely pack less food next time and look for ways to lighten the load a bit, and with our newly acquired experience and knowledge, we’ll be better prepared to tackle what lies ahead. Until next time…","Amicolola Falls Approach Trail

We had an early
arrival flying into Atlanta but our shuttle driver was running late, so we
ended up not getting to trailhead until 3:30pm. We still made our target
distance of 5.7 miles, however we rolled into camp after sunset making set up a
challenge. Both of my legs were cramping on the uphill climbs bringing the
reality of what we were doing to the forefront immediately. 
Rose: We're back on
the trail!
Bud: Ankle seems to
be holding up and blanket was nice.
Thorn: Late shuttle
and steep climbs up both Rocky Mountain and Tray Mountain totaling more than
2,500 ft of ascension.
 
Sunday 
Started raining at
5am and needed to do a mad dash to get my clothes in the tent that were outside
drying. Hiked 11.5 miles but Garmin wasn't working right and didn't capture all
the miles. Struggled with all uphill climbs again, especially up the 800' ascension
up Kelly Knob, and I still have both legs cramping up. 
We also found that
neither of our Sawyer Straws were working so we had to conserve water, boil a
batch, and call on Yellow Blazin Ron Brown to find us the cleaning syringe. He
also hooked us up with Around The Bend Hostel just down from Dicks Creek Gap where
we grabbed a cabin, shower, and comfy beds for $45 each.
Rose: Around the
Bend Hostel.
Bud: Still covered
11.5 miles despite lack of water and uphill struggles.
Thorn: Kelly Knob!
 
Monday
Great night of sleep
even with Derek snoring like a bear.
Early start from the
hostel and an immediate climb to start the day. Struggled a bit early, but was
able to keep a good pace and my heart rate in check most of the day. Numerous
aches and pains throughout the day, but no cramping quads and just left with a
bit of knee pain on the descents, especially the steep ones.
Most of the day was
actually enjoyable hiking with a number of good ridgeline walks, but the last
ascent up Couthouse Bald was brutal and zapped my remaining energy. 12 miles
today and on target.
We had an enjoyable
meal and a nice campsite at Muskrat Creek Shelter, but we're in bear territory
so sleep is a bit hard to come by. First attempt at PCT hang method.
Rose: The 2 or so
miles of relatively flat and pleasant hiking shortly after Dicks Creek Gap
climb.
Bud: I think body is
starting to get its trail legs.
Thorn: Couthouse
Bald.
 
Tuesday
I had a rough night
of sleep as temps dropped into the 30s with strong winds, so we got a late
start to our day. Easy pace today before starting a climb up to Standing Indian
Mountain shelter where we had a late breakfast. From there it was a nice steady
climb up Standing Indian Mountain, got some good pics then immediately worked
our way down towards our campsite. The backside of the trail was overgrown with
shoulder-high weeds that we plowed through for 2 miles before hitting some
really craggy terrain. A blister developed on the bottom of my left foot, but
otherwise my body felt good and my heart rate was fairly steady. 12.8 miles
today and it felt good. We stopped at Carter Gap Shelter for the night at
similar elevation, probable same temps, and same bear problem, so sleep is an
issue again. I put on all of my clothes and used my ear plugs to make the best
of it.
Rose: 3 or so miles
this morning of relatively flat, nice terrain at a healthy pace.
Bud: Surpassed 100
hiking miles and tomorrow will pass 100 AT miles.
Thorn: Water has
been inconsistent at times and going long stretches without finding good
sources. Also, Hurricane Ian bearing down on home and I'm not there to help
prepare.
 
Wednesday
We endured another
cold night and late start due to the weather, but no bears and got some sleep.
All around a good day of hiking with the most pressing challenge being Albert
Mountain with a 400' climb over 0.2 miles. The view was worth it however. All moments
were overshadowed by thoughts of the hurricane, made worse by losing cell
signal around 3pm and settling in for the night without knowing what's going
on. To make matters worse, we were in the predicted path of Ian and thinking we
needed to head for shelter off-trail to avoid serious wind and rain. 12.2 miles
today, 3.8 miles until we're in a spot to start making calls and getting a
better status of everything. We planned to wake up early so we can call home
and (hopefully) ease our mind.
Rose: Albert
Mountain fire tower and 100 mile mark.
Bud: Far Out app
that could replace the paper trail guide (as shared by dad/daughter team Reggi
and Elizabeth).
Thorn: Hurricane
Ian.
P.S. I hung my bear
bag PCT method in an old tree and the branch broke while I was still pulling up
the bag. The branch caught me square on the noggin and drew a little blood, but
fortunately no concussion or serious injury.
 
Thursday
Another night of
freezing and shivering with limited sleep. We woke up without word from home,
so we hit the trail around 7:15 in the cold to find a cell signal. Family and
homes were all OK, which was the only good part of the morning; the soreness,
cold, lack of sleep, and uphill climb made for a miserable morning for me.
Quite frankly, this was probably my worst moment on the trail this trip. Derek
appears unencumbered. At Winding Stairs Road we made plans for a hostel and
pick up at Wayah Gap with Chica and Sunsets Hostel. Very nice place and couple.
We spent the afternoon in Franklin, NC at Outdoor 76 for new liner to keep
warm, Lazy Hiker Brewery ( great stop), and Root & Barrel for steak
dinners. Back by 7 and in bed before 9. Slack-packing tomorrow after 10.2 miles
today.
Rose: The night in
town.
Bud: I have a liner
and nighttime temps should be higher.
Thorn: Another cold
night without sound sleep.
 
Friday
13.5 miles
slack-pack from Wayah Gap to Tellico in 6 hours.
Rose: the
slack-packing definitely helped with the inclines.
Bud: The Far Out app
saved us from going the wrong way at Wayah Tower.
Thorn: The pressure
to be at Tellico at 3pm for the pickup made for a faster descent over the last
1.5miles than I would have liked.
 
Saturday
We got an early
start after breakfast with a shuttle ride from Josh to Tellico. The initial
plan was to hike the 8 miles to the NOC then lay up for the rest of the day,
but since we were there and finished with lunch before 2pm, we decided to press
on for Sassafras Gap. It was most definitely the hardest afternoon push thus
far. 15.1 miles with a 4,000 ft descent and a 3,000 ft ascent to and from the
NOC. Cold weather, rain, and slick terrain made the last 6 miles very
precarious and difficult to navigate with a number of slips and slides. We made
it to the shelter and set up our tents inside the shelter to avoid the wind and
rain. There was an opportunity to lay up at Grassy Gap, but the campsite sat on
the ridge and the wind was whipping, so no choice but to push through.
Rose: Past the NOC
and getting closer to our goal at Fontana Dam.
Bud: Even though it
was a tough climb, 15.1 miles is our longest hike this trip.
Thorn: The last 6
miles: 3,000 ft straight up in cold, rainy, slippery conditions after 8 miles
of a bruising descent made that part of the hike miserable.
 
Sunday
15.6 miles today at
a good pace all the way through. For no reason in particular, I lead the whole
day. It was a cold morning again and a bit of a slow start, but we definitely
benefited from sleeping in the shelter out of the wind and rain (however the dew
soaked the outside of our tents). We tried to break the day into thirds with a
3.8 miles walk to have breakfast at Locust Gap, then 5.3 miles to Brown Folk
Shelter for lunch, finishing with 6.3 miles to Cable Gap Shelter for dinner and
sleep. The shelter is small and rugged, but should keep us warm. Plus we're the
only ones here, so it is very peaceful. It's also our last night on the trail,
so was finished the remaining port!
Rose: We're a half
day hike from ending our trip.
Bud: 3 days in a row
of at least 13.1 miles.
Thorn: No cell
signal tonight and most of the day lacked good scenic views.
 
Monday
We had a bit of a
climb out from the shelter up Black Gum Mountain and took a break for breakfast
about 2.2 miles in. From there, it was mostly downhill to Fontana, NC where we
hiked around a good part of the lake before finishing our trip at the Visitor
Center. It was an enjoyable and scenic 7.1 mile hike and has us ending at 166.3
AT miles between our first 2 years. Getting from the Visitor Center to
Knoxville, TN was a bit of a challenge with limited cell service and only one
available shuttle driver. To add, the ride to Knoxville took us on US 129,
which we now know to be the infamous ""Tail of the Dragon"" (https://tailofthedragon.com/), an 11
mile stretch of road with 318 curves and the site for motorcycle and sport car
enthusiasts. Thankfully our shuttle driver had no interest in taking the
hairpin turns at breakneck speed like many of the other drivers that day.
Rose: He hit our
target of 115 miles 2 days early.
Bud: No major
injuries this trip and we're beginning to dial in our approach to the trail.
Thorn: It was a bit
of a logistical challenge to get to the airport and we'll likely suffer through
the same difficulties when we return.
Until next time!
 
Lessons Learned:
 I'm still carrying too much food. My bag weighed 49 lbs at the airport without water and that's what I carried on my back for at least 3 days. I need to lose at least 10 lbs of pack weight for the next trip. Even with multiple opportunities to shed some of the food, I still came home with 4 lbs of unused food. Uphill climbs are still a bear. I adjusted my fitness routine to include more walking and some include work on the treadmill, but I still struggled with the steeper inclines. Part of this is pack weight, and part of it was being sidelined 3 months with a bad ankle, but I need to find a way to get my legs better prepared for the mountains. I need to pay better attention to the weather because I really underestimated the ability of my blanket to keep me warm. While normally I'm too hot with the sleeping bag, the blanket will not cut it when the weather drops below 50 I believe we're going to be better off planning for resupply every 3-4 days instead of packing for a full 10-12 day trip. Not only is it too much food to carry, but the break from hiking and the pleasantries of a hot meal and/or a nice bed really improve spirits and performance after a few days of marching along.","Unicoi Gap
