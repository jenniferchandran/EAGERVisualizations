Nails,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633191,"Hi my name is Nails,I've been section hiking the AT since 2016 and finally made it to Roan Mtn.  Yeppers, it's taken me 5 years to go approx. 390 miles!  I started in Springer and have proceeded from A to B to C to D and made sure I never missed a step or a section to get to my current location at Roan Mtn. This year I've decided to take an entire month off from work and dedicate it to spending time on the trail heading to point E to J, not gonna skip any letters, just gonna give it a month to get away from work and hopefully cover some ground on the trail.  My trail name is Nails, I love my wife, I love the woods, I love the trails and I love painting my nails.....sometimes I like hugging tree's too.See you soon, happy trails.Nails.",,View Entry,"Mar 12, Fri",0
Nails,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633242,"My journey starts in 21 days like it or not.  I like it, but I'm nervous.  I'm not scared of the trail as I've already section hiked 395 miles of the trail, I'm scared of the world I will be leaving behind for 30 days.  I'm impressed with all the through hikers, how do they literally just walk away from their lives for 5 to 6 months?  Soon I will be changing my outgoing phone message to let people know that I will be unavailable for about 30 days, soon I will sharing with my Facebook friends that I will be unavailable, soon I will be letting my customers know that I will be unavailable, soon I will be unavailable.  Truth is that I have already started to share with my family, friends and customers that I will be away continuing my section hike and will hopefully return sometime in May.  Amazing to me, is that everyone seems genuinely excited for me and looks forward to my return and hearing about the adventure.  100% support from everyone.I've also become aware of the journey, it has begun.Nails.",,View Entry,"Mar 14, Sun",0
Nails,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633308,"Sitting creekside while I write, I have everything I need.  Shelter up, sleeping bag and pillow ready and waiting.  A New Egland IPA in hand cooled by the waters near the Davidson River in Pisgah National Forrest.  I'm hoping for some foul weather this evening so I can test me tent and some new gear that I recently purchased.  The skies are gray and it looks like rain is coming, probably be after I go to bed, so I expect the morning will be difficult and soggy.  Sure enough, it rained all night and morning.  Had to put up all my gear and shelter while in the rain, I've decided to start hiking with an umbrella and today I'm loving that decision.  I'm very disappointed with my tent, the rain soaked through and started to come inside, fortunately not soaked but everything is damp.  After watching another hiker who had set up a tarp above his camp, I'm now convinced that is the way to go.  It may seem like extra unnecessary weight but I really want a dry space to be able to set up and take down camp when the rain is pouring.My target date is still April 5th to continue section hiking the AT.  I've been hiking like an animal for the last 3 weeks and testing myself and gear one night out every week in preparation.  Happy trails,Nails.",,View Entry,"Mar 15, Mon",0
Nails,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633840,"I leave in 8 days to continue my section hike on the AT, my wife has volunteered to drive my to Walnut Mountain Rd. to the trail head where I stopped one year ago.  I'm hoping she will join me for the first few miles of the hike before we say goodbye until I return at the end of April.  This will be my first time on the trail without an exit plan or a final destination.  I'm planning on staying out on the trail for the entire month of April, I'll resupply in towns when I can and probably have my wife send a box or two as needed.  I've been preparing for over a month now, testing new gear, hiking, spending many nights out and intentionally going out in foul weather.  Last night I intentionally set up camp in a rain storm, a whopper of a thunder storm and everything worked out great.  Stayed dry and comfortable all night, actually may have been my best night of sleep ever.  I'm heading out for a hike this morning, probably only going to go about 5 miles before I need to return, get some work done and get some details finalized for the upcoming trip.  I'm grateful for the support and encouragement from my wife, couldn't do this without all her love.Happy trails,Nails.",,View Entry,"Mar 26, Fri",0
Nails,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634057,"Living near the Mountains to Sea Trail allows me to prepare for my upcoming adventure on the AT.  I've been hiking the MST with and without gear for the last 5 weeks, doing overnights and sometimes just hiking with a fully loaded pack on a day hike.  It's been fun preparing, albeit reading trail guides, purchasing supplies or telling the world I'm oughta here.  I've been recognizing that this time of preparing is just as important as the time I'm about to spend on the trail, I've become aware that I'm already on the AT journey, the experience is happening.  I appreciate this journey and recognize that it has already begun, actually it began about two months ago when I decided to pick up on my section hike where I left off exactly one year ago today.  This adventure is a journey, I don't have a destination, I don't have an exit plan, but I do have time.Four days away from a trail a day.Happy trails,Nails.",,View Entry,"Mar 30, Tue",0
Nails,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634228,"Starting tomorrow morning at Walnut Moutain Rd., I'm looking forward to hiking the first few miles with my wife before she sets me off to continue my section hike through Virginia.  Today is going to be an interesting day at work as I've flipped the switch and my head is on the trail, I don't really want to work today but it will be nice to see a few friends and loyal customers before I go.  I'm closing my store for five weeks while I'm on the trail, it's been fascinating how much support and encouragement I have received from everyone.  I will miss them while away but most of all I will miss my wife.The weather forecast is looking great for the next 10 days, looking forward to covering some distance on the trail and getting some backwoods therapy.Happy trails,Nails.",,View Entry,"Apr 03, Sat",0
