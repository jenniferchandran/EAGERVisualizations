Achin hikes from Salisbury tomorrow afternoon according to his schedule and we meet at Great Barrington, MA on Wednesday to head further up the trail.",,View Entry,"Aug 29, Sun",0
Rockdawg69,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643346,"7 hours on the road.  Reached Salisbury at 1415.  Dropped Achin so that he could resume his hike from here.  We should meet on Wednesday around 1100 to 1200 at AT crossing on US Hwy 7, south of Great Barrington. Tomorrow begins my re-start on the trail. Hoping for clear skies and cool weather. Praying that remnants of Ida stay south of us for rest of the week.

Rockdawg69,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643385,"Took a tour of western CT and western MA today looking for a place to leave the truck for a few days. Settled on AT parking lot near North Adams, MA.  Four bus changes and 3 hours got me back to GB and Holiday Inn Express for tonight. Ida bearing down on us tomorrow by noon. Weather folks are predicting 2 to 4 inches tomorrow afternoon. We need to be in shelter by 1:00.Side note: there can not be that many antiques in this world to support the dozens of antique shops all over this area. Every other building says “antiques for sale”, or so it seems.Achin says he had a hard day in the rocks.",,View Entry,"Aug 31, Tue",0
Rockdawg69,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643404,"Ida remnants bearing down on this area today. Predicting 3 to 5 inches rain today and all night. Collected Achin from trail head at US Hwy 7 around 1100. Looking soaked to the skin. Back at Holiday Inn Express for the night.
Hiking tomorrow we think. Got to get better weather soon!",,View Entry,"Sep 01, Wed",0
Rockdawg69,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643596,"Giget shuttled us at 0900 to trail crossing at Great Barrington.  Off we went for my first day back on trail. Sunshine and clear skies today after yesterday’s deluge from Ida. Trail was either a river of water or a mud track, except for the “rock piles”. Reached shelter at 1430 for about 1.2 mph. Not bad since I did no mountain training for this hike—- AGAIN.  Just jump in and survive as best I can.
Two good climbs today of about 600 feet each. Around 1500 Wilco (ex navy helo pilot) comes in. He is now Trauma nurse in Baltimore, travels around the country for jobs. He left for more south bound hiking.  1600 - 10 young folks from Williams College arrive. Turns out it is a freshman orientation outing.  Mostly girls and a couple of guys plus two junior leaders. 
Moving on tomorrow toward the Shaker camp site.","US Hwy7, Great Barrington

Rockdawg69,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643598,"Started at 0730 for another day of ups and downs. One 900 footer and several 100 to 200 foot hills! Some ragged climbing for me. Lots of stops on the ups.  Still lots of water and mud.  Nothing much exciting today, just head down and dragging my rear up the trail.
Met several seniors after lunch doing day hikes. Spent time talking with them “while resting”.  No pictures as I left batteries for camera home——aaaaaargh!
Pushed hard all afternoon and reached camp site at 1630. No falls in last 500 miles on the trail. Today, one skating slide on acorns and then a mud slide at end of the day. Damn! Muddy clothes and wet shoes.  And I am dead beat out.  Energy gone!
Another Williams College freshman group arrives at 1700. Same song, second verse. Stayed up to past 2100.","Tom Leonard Shelter

Rockdawg69,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643601,"BAD Day!  Woke up with absolutely no energy. Hard to get air. Weakness in the body. Climbing was a misery. Decided I was having an AFIB event. Call for a shuttle to pick us up at Jerusalem Road crossing.  Longest 2 miles I have ever hiked in my life. At times, only 10 to 20 yards at the time uphill, with a 300 footer at the end.
 Collected the truck at North Adams, had a Subway and then went to emergency room for a check up. And yes, it was an AFIB. Two and one-half hours later it was over. Two EKGs and a liter of fluids later, diagnosis was dehydration.  AFIB cleared on its own.  Not enough electrolytes. All this came from yesterday’s long hard push. Not enough electrolytes in the water bottle.
Achin and I thought about calling an end to the hike.  Spending the night in Dalton, MA and feeling a lot better. We may do a north to south from here, back to the pull out point from today. We shall see in the morning.","Shaker Camp Site

Rockdawg69,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643643,"After yesterday’s events, I thought I might be ready to continue this hike. Alas, the morning brought drizzle and opportunity for more rain all day. Decided my heart- not the part that went wacky - was not finding any joy in hiking in the rain all day.  So, home it is for now.  This just means I need to re-start next spring further back down the trail than Hanover, NH.  The bright side is that I should get a lot of exercise in the rocks and mountains before reaching for the White Mountains.
My heart appears normal, so I will return to working the farm and doing other trails for now.
Blessings to all and thanks for following.
Special thanks to my hiking buddy - Achin. Stuck with me through a tough day on Saturday.  Not sure I would have made it out without his help.","Dalton, MA

Rockdawg69,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643675,"2 days drive home. Safely back and feeling well.Twice now, MA has beaten me to the ground,  2016 and this year.  Maybe I need to work on re-learning all my previous lessons for being a hiker.  I know I had plenty of fluids on Friday but obviously I did not get enough electrolytes.  Never thought I would make that kind of mistake, but I did.  Another 8 months to correct my errors and do a better job of being prepared for the Berkshire Mountains.Oh Yes, I will be going back. Can not let the trail beat me into submission.  Keep on trucking!",,View Entry,"Sep 06, Mon",0
