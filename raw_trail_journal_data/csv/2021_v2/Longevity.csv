Longevity,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632132,"...to 2020!  I'm ready to put the year behind me and I'm especially ready to start my thru hike this February 24th.  Have one shakedown hike left to complete, 3 nights, starting at Springer, and will keep each day around 8 miles.  Checking (again) how I'm loading my pack and how it rides, final winter weight of pack and anything else I can learn (and of course get a trail name!).  Have tested my cold weather gear down to 20 degrees with backyard camping.  I know it isn't the same as hiking all day in the cold, setting up camp and then sleeping, but it at least gives me an idea of if I can stay warm with my current set up (I'll post a gear list in next few days).Entering 2021 makes the countdown to leaving just feel more real!  I'm not going to try and plan too much in terms of where I camp, preparing food in advance, etc.  Will just hit the trail and learn/plan as I go.  Also hope to do some Wim Hof Method instruction along the way.  I know the method could significantly benefit other hikers so will be happy to share.To the future!",,View Entry,"Dec 31, Thu",0
Longevity,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632634,"Was hoping to beat the ""bubble"" that really ramps up on March 1.  However, the discovery of cancerous cells on my leg and their subsequent removal today has introduced a delay as the Dr would rather I not walk in the woods until the wound heals.  The bad news is that it puts me in March, the good news is that it is only a weeks delay.  So my new tentative start date will be March 3rd.  Actually, this gives me time to complete some major chores around the house, so I'm happy with that.  Things happen for a reason so I'm not stressed about the change.  Just like when on the trail, I deal with things as they come at me, in spite of planning.And just today I was thinking about the sheer magnitude of what it means to start a thru hike or any long distance hike.  Its incredible to think of this comfortable life I have with a heated home, car, snuggling with my wife, bathrooms, showers, food choices and any other way you can identify how far we have become removed from nature and our natural selves.  Even though I notionally know what is coming, going from the comfortable/easy environment to a harsh, cold, wet, miserable conditions lifestyle, nothing can really prepare me.  One day I wake up at home and the next day I wake up in a tent - and the next 150 days after that.  This is an incredible change in reality but as Wim says and as I teach in my Wim Hof Method classes, we have all become alienated from nature.  We have lost that connection between our bodies and our environment.  From the beginning of time humans dealt with nature directly.  Not until the last 100 years have we strayed away from nature to artificial lighting, cooling, heating, processed food, easy transportation.  You name it.  And we continue to find creative ways to make our lives simpler and by definition, further removed from nature.  I have worked hard over the past 4 years to reestablish that connection with nature.  From ice baths and cold showers to finding and strengthening my mind/body connection.  I've added other creative ways to connect with nature, from grounding by spending 15 minutes outside every morning, in nothing but shorts, regardless of temperature, to connecting with nature during my Wim Hof Method breathing rounds.  The Wim Hof Method alone has reconnected me to nature.  Sure, it took me wanting to, me working at it, building the mind/body connection that allows me to feel the energy from nature, but I'm on the path to enjoying the luxuries we have but within the context and harsh reality of nature.So, there is a delay but in the end, I've been training for 4 years to prepare my mind and body for this experience.  What is a week. ",,View Entry,"Feb 12, Fri",0
Longevity,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632703,"I have been planning, purchasing and preparing for this hike for 8 months.  Just by shear elapsed time I am ready.  But it goes deeper than that, my preparations included ensuring my mind was ready for this challenge.  My mindset has been strengthened through daily Wim Hof Method practice, giving me confidence in myself.  Rising to the challenge I've entered into.  I know I will complete the trail and that is the best way to begin a hike from Georgia to Maine, with the knowledge that, barring an unexpected physical issue, I will be successful.

However, it goes deeper than that.  It is one thing to walk the length of the Appalachian Trail but quite another to fully take in, understand and be connected to the experience.  By deepening the access into my mind and that voice that says this is too hard, too wet, too cold, too hot, too many bugs too (fill in the blank), we begin to quiet that inner voice, the subconscious chatter.  If not, it is so easy to succumb to that inner voice.  I learned how to do this by combining the mindset I have developed from the Wim Hof Method with Kundalini Yoga (40 days of Kundalini with Diana McCall of Black Mountain - thank you!) and the meditation Waking Up app by Sam Harris.  
What if we could quiet the voice, not allowing it to dictate our thoughts and possibly our future?  What if we could go even deeper into our mind by acknowledging what is happening around us but not be drawn in?  We can take in the beauty of nature, the sights and sounds of wildlife or even the complaints of our fellow hikers.  Allowing us to hear the distant sound of a bird or the wind approaching at treetop level, the steps and heaving breathing of a bear as it walks through camp late at night searching for food or maybe hear the anxiety in a fellow hikers voice as they let doubts enter their mind.  But there is a difference between just ""hearing"" and connecting.

These are all real events that happen on the trail.  The old me would have heard, seen, maybe even acknowledged what was happening around me but giving foot to that subconscious mind.  And then most likely be influenced by it.  Now I'm ready to blast my ""present moment self"" with all the sensory input I can absorb.  I'm ready to experience the trail - all the good and all the bad, whatever that may be.  And it will all contribute to my successful hike because I will take the trail a moment at a time.  Always being present.  
By living in the present moment I've created the space in my mind for negative thoughts to safely enter, to be recognized and then to be dismissed.  To dissolve back into my consciousness having no more effect on me than walking over a stone that is in my path.

To all my fellow hikers - develop a strong mind/body connection.  Allow yourself to live in the present moment.  Take, use and learn what is important (i.e. trail angel ahead, better hurry) and for everything else, acknowledge it, respond if necessary and then move on.  If we meet on the trail I'm happy to teach you the Wim Hof Method and the path forward to a strong mindset.

Happy hiking my friends!  For me, my mind and body are ready to get this going on March 3!  I'll be starting in Franklin, NC and then eventually completing my hike at Springer Mountain.  Trail name TBD.",,View Entry,"Feb 18, Thu",0
Longevity,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632785,"Was able to receive my first Covid vaccine yesterday!  Original plan was to get the second vaccine in late May when I return home for a few weeks to support my daughter who is having a baby. However, was told scheduling the second vaccine is difficult if you don’t go with the recommended 17 day wait. Instead of risking not being able to schedule the next vaccine when I’m home in May I’ll go ahead and get it on March 17th. So here is my plan. Leave on the 3rd as planned, hike 11-13 days and my wife will pick me up either at Winding Stair Gap near Franklin or the Nantahala Outdoor Center. Either is about a 2.5 hour drive from our home. Come home, get the vaccine and probably spend a few days doing chores around the house. I’m happy with this plan and look forward to hitting the trail next week. Long range forecast calls for 50% chance of rain on the 3rd. Might as will get used to it from the beginning!",,View Entry,"Feb 25, Thu",0

Anything from I should have brought more double ply to to learning how best to regulate my comfort with what I brought. It is after all, a learning experience. And if I were an apprentice I would be on the very bottom rung of the ladder. Plenty of mind knowledge but no practical experience. I have enough book knowledge to tell a master hiker how to filter water but no experience  to tell that person what signs exist around the water source that says whether it is good or not. So much to learn, but I am a willing student anxious to learn, sometimes the hard way, but to learn nonetheless. Today is flying by with plenty more to do before leaving in the morning.

Except we got there at 7:30 and they didn’t open until 9. Went to the lodge and had breakfast. Got back down by 8:45 and registration for hikers was open!I am hiker number 411 (but not everyone registers) and by 9:15 we were heading to the top of springer.  50 minutes later we were parked and heading 1 mile south on the AT to the southern terminus. Got pictures at the start and then headed right back to the parking lot. We said our goodbyes, I continued north bound on the AT while Gail headed back down the mountain on the first service road (hoping not to get list heading home)  I hiked 7 more beautiful miles with clear blue skies and temps in the 50s. Perfect weather!  The terrain was up and down but not too severe. Tomorrow will definitely be more severe terrain. And today I learned that the AT can have a lot  of people on it and still be very accommodating. I passed a few hikers but not too many. We have about 17 tents set up on the shelter where I am. I thought it would be more crowded. So happy to learn it wasn’t. It’s now dark, I’m tucked in my tent and ready for sleep. Headed to Gooch mountain shelter tomorrow.

Longevity,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632939,"second day as good as the first in terms of weather and beauty. The terrain was more difficult and slower but the mountains and forest are awesome. There was a little bit of everything, from a rock strewn trail to Long and reasonably steep accents to beautiful meandering through the forest. I did learn a couple things. First, if someone is hiking bring you try and maintain 5-6 feet distance. A hiker walking with me tripped and almost took me down from behind. I’m surei would have lost that battle. The second lesson had to do with my hiking poles. I put them down outside the path of my foot but once in a while I change direction of the landing and the pole goes inside my foot. I’ve almost tripped myself twice but was able to pull the pole out just in time. Arrived to the shelter at 2:30 but was too tired to go further.  Can’t wait until I get my hiking legs!  Until then I’ll stick to the 8-10 miles a day. Tomorrow I’m going about 9 miles to a campsite, the next shelter is too far to try. But the campsite only lists 6 places to put a tent. With a reasonably early start I shouldn’t have an issue. If so, I’ll figure it out. It’s6:50 and almost dark.

Left Lance Creek at 7:15 to head to and up blood mountain, the highest peak in Georgia at over 4000’. Another beautiful day but cold, especially on top of blood mtn. Filled up and over, stopped to enjoy the beautiful views, then headed down. And that was hard on the knees. So many rocks and boulders at weird angles, it was a as tough decent.

Longevity,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633015,"my longest day so far. I’m building up to greater mileage and intentionally keeping it shorter for the first couple weeks. Today was over 11 miles which included hiking over 3 peaks and one of those was particularly difficult. Fortunately, I was able to apply my Wim Hof experience into helping me in the ascents. By using zero breathing on the way if I was able to remove lactic acid as it built up. My legs were still tired but I could keep moving up. It was an awesome power to be able to do this!  And anyone else can as well. I spoke to Terri guys heading up one summit and they both wanted to learn. Since we ended up at the same shelter I was able to teach them and two others the breathing. Add I hope, the awareness of Wim his ID much higher with the people on the trail than people in general. One guy I trained was listening to Wim’s new book on his way to the trail. Helping others by teaching them the method is a mission of mine and one I intend to do in the entire trail. Another cold night coming up but my gear is well sorted for it.

Regardless, I actually felt good, even in the ups, but I’m exhausted. dinner, finish this and then bed. The big need if that I got my trail name today (after rejecting a couple), and it is Longevity. I’m happy with that name for a couple of reasons but primarily that is exactly my interest in helping people, their longevity.  The other big news is that I had another fall, number 2, but this one hurt. Again, the touch reason for falling is not paying attention to your foot placement, and that’s what happened to me. Regardless, I feel forward and it would have been ok if Rocky Mountain had not put a rockin the way of my face hitting the ground. No major damage other that a cut above my lip. Put hand sanitizer on it when I got to camp (that felt good) and then some neosporin. Unfortunately I can’t use a bandaid because of my beard. That’s about it.

Longevity,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633106,"yesterday, the 9th, was an awesomely difficult day. Between the views and the hard ups and downs (about 3,500 feet in elevation gain) I learned a lot about myself. Primarily, I’m good at the ups. Don’t get me wrong, they are still hard, exhausting and painful. However, I’ve come up with a sort of walking meditation that gets me into a zone without having to think about it.  I’m still very aware of the trail as my head is looking down at my next 3 steps. But I’m able to combine my Wim Hof training with Kundalini Breath of Fire, and my mind is listening to my deep breaths in and out, in and out, over and over and over. Before I know it I’m at the top of the hill and take a short water break. That exercise was repeated several times during the hike yesterday. With the warm afternoon temperatures paying attention to hydration is more important than I thought it would be this early in my hike. I’m getting used to setting up camp, eating dinner, sleeping and striking  camp, all in the cold. In fact, I kind of like it. However, once it was in my head that I was going into Hiawassee when I got to Dicks Creek Gap, the idea of sleeping in a tent that night sounded awful. My mind was set on a shower, good dinner and a bed.  And as hard as that day was, it was so worth it!  Met lots of new hikers and Sailor Jack ended up splitting the room with me my first night. Today, the 10th, has been rest and recuperate with laundry and food supply thrown in. So it was a good day and as stated, I’ll be taking it slower as I make my way to Franklin, NC. I’ve adjusted my pack (hope it works), found a more efficient way to pack it, took another Epsom salt bath and now I’m ready for bed and tomorrow. Signing out. ","Cheese Factory

Warm weather and partly cloudy. And the ups and downs were not too severe. Another guy started out at the same time as I did but dropped back when he dropped something from his pack. Saw him later and he had seen a bear about a mile after we split. I didn’t see it but I’m sure it saw me. The big highlight of the day was crossing into North Carolina. That was a huge milestone at mile 78 of the trail. Got pictures and videos of course. Shah got to see either Woken Buffalo. Gail and I saw him the first day. He has a huge pack with a wok strapped to the back and he cooks all his meals in it. Incredible.

",Bly Gap,"Mar 11, Thu",8.90
Longevity,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633336,"I camped just north of the Georgia border at Bly Gap and close to the famous gnarly tree.  While this was a gap between mountains it definitely wasn't at the bottom.  Essentially, I was camped on a small ridge and could see both east and west.  To the west was a huge valley with a town in it (Hiawassee?) and to the east was the bottom of the gap which had a great water source and a couple more tent sites.  Being on the ridge did not work in my favor as the temperature dropped during the night and the winds picked up.  So the wall of the tent was being pressed in and flapping against the back of my head overnight.  In spite of that I still slept pretty good.I also did some basic Wim Hof training for Bundles and ASAP.  It was a particularly touching experience as ASAP shared about the death of a son from Leukemia a few years ago.  In fact, his trail name, ASAP is in honor of his son because as he and his son's family were all dealing with the cancer, his son would say ""always say a prayer"".  It was an emotional moment and I felt a real connection with ASAP.  He would leave early the next morning before me but we would have unexpected encounter two days later.  And in that short time I know I have found a friend.Hiking was typical with lots of ups and downs.  Total elevation gain during the day of 3,180' with the most difficult part right out of the gate when leaving camp.  It was a mile of mostly up to get over Sharp Point and then 2 - 3 good elevation gains before arriving at the base of Standing Indian Mountain.  This was one of the more difficult/interesting climb and descent I've had so far.  The ascent was steep, mostly rock and roots as was the decent.  But along the way the views were incredible!  There were several day hikers out to enjoy the hike and views as well.  Shortly after descending you arrive at Beech Gap.  Several people continued onto Carter Gap Shelter in another 3 miles and even though I arrived at 2:30 in the afternoon my legs were toast and ready for a rest.On this hike I continued to develop my ""stepping"" strategy.  If the shortest distance between two points is a straight line, and its impossible to hike in a straight line on the AT, then how do you find the sweet spot?  There are many factors that affect your distance for the day, not just how many steps you can minimize by walking straight.  I've come up with 5 factors that affect the overall speed at which you hike.  Your actual pace, how much safety you build in, ""smell the roses"", comfort and effective use of your trekking poles.  The goal is to reach your destination so the combination of these 5 factors will play a critical role in helping you reach that goal.Pace - obviously, how fast you walk/hike/climb/scramble, descend and rest will all add up to your overall pace.  And the more time you spend hiking the trail the more you will build strength in the right muscles that allow you to maintain a faster pace.Safety - I'm still learning how critical and finicky (and obvious) this can be to a successful hike.  I've had two falls, one relatively bad, and either could have ended my hike in that split second.  I've said this before but this can not be overstated - you have to be present for every step.  That is hard to do as our minds wander while we hike and it is easy to lose concentration.  But a simple step onto a loose rock, trip on a hidden rock, come down a steep step at a weird angle and tweak your knee, the list goes on.  Note to self - pay attention!  So you can see that safety has to be combined with pace to be successful.Smell the Roses - It's great to hike fast and safely, that will get you to your destination.  However, what is the point of walking to Maine and not enjoying as much as you can of what the trail has to offer?  There are many ""blue blaze"" side trails.  Many lead to shelters and water sources but many lead to views, historical areas, towns, etc.  I try to visit as many blue blazes as possible and use Guthooks to help me understand what is at the other end.  Of course, there is a balance I try and maintain, the longer the blue blaze the better the payoff better be.  For instance, at the top of Standing Indian Mountain there is an awesome view but it is a quarter mile walk to get there.  That is an example of it is worth it.  I highly recommend the blue blazes if the weather and time of day allow it.Comfort - Not just having comfortable shoes but each step you can turn increase or decrease the amount of discomfort you feel.  Literally 80% of the trail so far is covered with rocks or roots or both.  The rocks can be boulders haphazardly strewn about that you are climbing/scrambling over to small 1"" rocks and every size in between.  You just can't avoid walking on rocks and by the end of the day you are guaranteed of having sore feet (take care of your feet!, that is critical!).  I factor comfort into my steps.  If I can go an extra step to the left or right to land on a large flat rock, that is worth it.  If I can step on a root that is halfway up the side of a huge rock and thereby reduce the strain on my knee, I'll do it.  If I can land on a muddy flat spot vs on top of a sharp rock, I'll do that.  There are thousands of combinations of how your feet can land on each and every step and by trying to be ""present"" I'm learning to intuitively step in a way that minimizes discomfort.Effective use of Trekking Poles - I underestimated the power of good use of your trekking poles and believe I've significantly increased my ""longevity"" on the trail by learning how to use them.  From helping to propel myself along flat or ascending trails to arresting my speed/momentum going down trails to testing rocks to see if they are loose to building a cadence on uphills to shifting weight to my wrist from my knee, the poles have already saved my bacon more than once.  I had a hiker who didn't use poles tell me he didn't because they were like having expensive jewelry on the trail, that there was no need for them.  Guess that is why they say ""hike your own hike"".  And that is a saying I totally embrace and respect.  Well, that was long winded.  As stated earlier, I arrived at Beech Gap at 2:30 that afternoon, found a good tent site, hiked the quarter mile to get water and by 3:30 I was set up for the day.  This was the first time I was not able to receive any type of Verizon signal where I was camping.  Tasha had a Dr appt today and I wanted to hear the latest on her pregnancy.  Alas, no luck.  I hiked a 1/2 mile either direction on the trail and was not able to get a signal.  So guess it will have to wait until tomorrow.  Had a fun camp with several people I had camped with previously including Go! and Wokin Buffalo.  And for the first time I was able to watch his process of cooking dinner in his wok.  The guy is amazing and fun to be around.  Even with his heavy pack (would love to know what all he has with him) he is very happy and easy going.  ","Bly Gap

Longevity,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633464,"Wow, what a day.  Surprises, insights and of course, mountains and rocks.  Due to expected rain I left Beech Gap early at 6:10 am.  However, before that at 5:30, a hiker came down the trail heading northbound.  He stopped and we chatted for a few minutes.  His name is Owen and he is hiking the trail to raise $100,000 for polio (search Owen's Odyssey/polio and you'll find it).  Sounds like a great cause and I'll support his efforts however I can.  Little did I know that the first opportunity would come that day.  Before moving on Owen said he had a sore knee and did I think it may be lack of potassium.  I wasn't sure and told him that.  He had been hiking since 10:30 the night before (I can't imagine coming over Standing Indian Mountain in the dark) and was trying to go another 19 miles that day.  Off he went and I followed 40 minutes later thinking that was the last time I would see Owen.The hike from Beech Gap was actually pleasant with relatively rolling ups and downs.  I hiked 7 - 8 miles before starting up Albert Mountain (5,200').  What a BEAR that mountain was! Long, continuous trail up the mountain, plenty of rocks and roots and plenty of steep parts.  All this to reach a fire observation tower that I would have climbed for the view if the mountain wasn't socked in by fog.  I'm not complaining though, first, the weather has been so awesome that a little fog was the closest I had been to hiking in rain.  And of course, I would have climbed the stairs to the top of the tower but did appreciate the excuse to not do so.  Moving on from the tower I assumed it would be the typical up and over the top of the mountain (hard and tiring) but Albert had a cool (looking back it was cool, but not at the time) surprise or two waiting for me.  First, shortly after the tower I encountered Owen sitting on the side of the trail.  We spoke and his knee had gotten worse.  After speaking on the phone with his brother (who I believe he said was a physical therapist) and a couple other people it was felt that Owen probably tore the meniscus in his knee.  He was obviously in pain and was tired, not a great combination when trying to hike these mountains.  But then Owen stood up, said it was only a problem when going downhill and continued up Albert Mountain.Now, where we were talking was at the base of some huge boulders that unfortunately had a white blaze painted on them.  Meaning, that was the trail to the top.  Owen started up and soon disappeared from view.  I soon followed and quickly discovered what was happening.  I accidentally had gotten on a trail for Jim Bob's Rock Climbing School.  At least that was the thought going through my mind as I started climbing up.  There was no hiking at this point, literally, climbing/scrambling up.  I don't know the grade but it was steep.  Steep enough that if you stood straight up with a pack on your back you were in danger of falling back.  Thought this was cute and would go for a few boulders but every turn I took it was just more of the same.  When finally clear of the boulders I was rewarded with dozens of man made steps that continued up the steep slope.  ARRRGGGHHH!  This was definitely the hardest part of the trail for me so far.  Looking back, it was very different and maybe even a bit of preparation for Vermont and New Hampshire. At the top finally I found Owen again.  Even being able to go uphill I'm sure took its toll on him.  I asked if there was anything I could do to help and he asked if I could carry his bear canister/food and water bag with about 1.5L of water in it.  The bear canister would not fit in or on my pack so I stowed my trekking poles and carried the canister in my arms and hung the water bag from the back of my pack.  Owen needed to make it to Rock Gap where he was being picked up by Sunsets (of Chica and Sunsets Hostel) which was about 5 more miles with 2 more hills to climb.  This was 3 miles past where I intended to stay that night but decided I could handle the extra mileage.  We actually had a nice walk and visit along the way.  Owen was clearly in pain and would seem to briefly fall asleep each time we stopped for a rest.  But while walking we talked about favorite movies, musicals, books, music, etc.  It was a fun conversation that helped distract from the number of miles to go.  Another hiker came by and offered to carry something but Owen was in a groove and just kept going.  When we were withing a half mile of Rock Gap I checked my phone and there was no cell signal.  Rats!  That meant I had to go back up the hill. I sent Owen on, dropped my pack and his bear canister on the side of the trail, and started back up the mountain.  It took another half mile before I got a signal and was able to text Chica and Sunsets that Owen was at Rock Gap.  Back down the mountain, got my pack and continued on to the Gap where Sunsets had already arrived.  Said my goodbyes to Owen and hellos to Sunsets (I enjoyed following him and Chica on their thru hike in 2018) and headed back.Fortunately, the shelter I was staying at was only 2 tenths of a mile back from the gap.  So was able to get into camp, select a tent site and get everything set up.  That was a long, tiring and rewarding day.  17 miles when I include the backtracking to get a signal and it proved to me that my body had indeed been adapting and changing to the rigors of the trail.  And one good silver lining from the extra miles that day is that I was only 3 miles from where Gail would pick me up in the morning at Winding Stair Gap outside of Franklin, NC.I was out of fuel so no warm dinner for me but did enjoy a tortilla with peanut butter and the rest of my summer sausage.  Slept pretty well that night but did experience something that I need to solve.  I'm tall and when lying in my tent my head is close to the wall of the tent on one end and my feet, inside the quilt, touch the wall at the other end.  Not good with single wall tents as condensation on the inside tent wall is not unusual. Well, for the first time on this trek the conditions were right for condensation to form and by the morning my quilt was slightly wet by my feet.  Not good for a down quilt.  Have some ideas on adjustments to setting up my tent and will start sleeping diagonally from corner to opposite corner to minimize.  Overall, not a major issue but something I need to manage.  ","Beech Gap

Longevity,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633472,"Its time!  Time to go home and receive my 2nd Covid vaccine.  Gail is picking me up at Winding Stair Gap around 10 to 10:15.  It is a convenient spot as the trail crosses Hwy 64 coming out of Franklin.  There is no rush to leave camp that morning.  We did go back to Daylight Savings Time that night so there wasn't any light until well after 7.  I leisurely broke camp and started out around 8:20.  Before leaving I had a conversation with a hiker I had met the day before.  I'm guessing he is in his early 20's and his trail name is Mona Lisa.  During the night (I find I'm sleeping well until 11 or 12 most nights and then off and on after that, so plenty of quiet time to think) I was thinking about his trail name and came to the conclusion it was the perfect Appalachian Trail name.  And I'll explain.  The Mona Lisa is a beautiful yet mysterious painting.  To me, we are all beautiful people, each with our own differences, flaws and goodness.  So the hiker was a beautiful person.  The Appalachian Trail is beautiful, the owls are beautiful (and noisy), the rain is beautiful, the trees are beautiful, the sky is beautiful, everything about the trail is beautiful.  But everything about the trail is mysterious as well.  Maybe that is what makes it so exciting to hike and why I claim that every step is different than any other.  Regardless both the Mona Lisa and Appalachian Trail and beautiful and mysterious.  The perfect trail name.  He was sitting at a picnic table next to the shelter with several other hikers.  I sat down to visit and told him that I had been thinking about his trail name.  When I started off by stating that the Mona Lisa was beautiful and mysterious there were some chuckles from the others.  Not sure what they thought I was going to say next but I did feel some tension in the air.  What politically incorrect thing is this old guy going to say?  I'm sure there were some cringe worthy thoughts in al there heads and believe I surprised (and pleased) everyone when I gave the above description.  Mona Lisa came up to me a short while later to thank me and express appreciation for my description.  This was another cool moment on the trail which continues to provide opportunity for people to connect on levels they never would have the opportunity to do back in our every day lives.  I think this is one of the greatest opportunities to learn and grow as humans that the trail provides and I look forward to identifying and exploring these opportunities whenever they present themselves.  Talking to others one on one, particularly those who may be different than ourselves, who have different points of view, is one way we grow together as a people.  Group talk makes it hard to be open minded, to try and learn, to build respect.  But in a one on one conversation we have the opportunity to do all of that and more.  This is one of my goals of hiking the trail.  To not only have these conversations but to hopefully inspire others to ""pass it forward"" and do the same.  This reminds me of the book The Alchemist.  My favorite line in the book is ""And, when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you achieve it."".  If you have read the book then you know it is about a boy's journey through life seeking his destiny.  In a way it reminds me of what hiking the Appalachian Trail could provide any of us.  Every step on the trail, every encounter with others holds the potential of letting the universe conspire on our behalf.  God may put the ""doors of opportunity"" there but it is our responsibility to recognize those doors and to walk through.  I've already had a few opportunities to have meaningful interactions with others and to connect with the beauty of nature and am looking forward to the many unknown opportunities that await me.    Back to the trail!  I hiked the 3+ miles to the parking area we were meeting Gail at.  It was another beautiful day on the trail and a nice hike heading into Franklin.  On the way there I spoke with Mona and his 2 buddies and offered to give them a ride into Franklin.  They were going to resupply and then head back to the trail that day.  Gail arrived, we loaded in my car and headed to town.  Driving a car and going fast was a cool experience!  They were also looking for an outfitter but of the two in town, one was closed on Sundays and the other didn't open for another hour, so we headed to an Ingles grocery store.  Another surprise awaited me.  Gail and I went in the store as well to get some coffee and use the restroom. But I was pleasantly surprised by the smiling face of ASAP waiting to greet me when we entered the store!  ASAP was waiting for the father of another hiker to drop off a new air mattress that had shipped to him (trail magic comes in all forms) and ASAP saw me walking towards the store.  It was a great seeing him again and this time I thought of getting his contact information.  Kind of hard to look ASAP up in a phone book (if they even exists any longer).  After a short visit Gail and I started back to Atlanta and thus begins my week off the trail.","Rock Gap Shelter

Started down the trail at 8:45 and hikers 11 miles today. Legs felt strong and could have gone further but no need to push just yet. Also, the early returned on my pack are good. No shoulder pain yesterday so I am cautiously optimistic that the issue is resolved. Stay tuned.Saying goodbye to Gail was harder this time because we knew it would be 2 months before I’m back home. So we did the quick goodbye and I got started.  the hike itself went well.  Weather was overcast, damp and cold, especially when the wind was blowing up on the mountains. It never really warmed up until I was in camp and that was only brief. Did bump into one hiker I knew before leaving the trail to go home, so that was nice. And for anyone looking for a cool view later in the spring, there is a observation tier in Waysh Bald that is easily accessible by car. Worth checking it out. Got to camp around 3 and found a great tent site!  Level ground, no one too close and nice views. Set to fit the night, cooked an early dinner and hung it with other hikers. Also did Wim Hof training for four. In closing there is something I was thinking about today that I want to mention. The trail is hard and takes s strong mindset. But the same is true due those at home. For Gail and Tasha it takes a strong mindset as well and I love them both for their commitment to my hike, knowing there will be days it may be difficult. ","Winding Stair Gap

I could hear him snore all night if that gives you an idea of the noise coming from his room. I joined for a bit to visit with other hikers and saw Windbreak who I hadn’t seen since going off the trail for a week. He has changed his trail name to Doc. Woke you early but took my time getting ready as I needed to go to NOC outfitter at 9. Long stuff short, they weren’t able to help me with my pack (can’t get the weight off my shoulders). Called Zpacks and unfortunately there was nothing they could do to help me exchange my pack (I need a medium torso pack vs the long torso I ordered). So asking if they had some tore off customer satisfaction discount on new gear they did make an offer that was fair.

Think it will sell quickly.today’s hike was another for the books. 8 miles of incline gaining over 4000 cumulative feet. Beautiful views but but it was a hard trail and climb. Always scared at hire my body responds and know that my breathing has helped a lot. Given the ascent, my goal for the day was 11 miles. This puts me within 16 miles of Fontana Dam, the gateway to the smoky mountains. My plan is to go 12 miles tomorrow and have 4 miles Thursday morning. Unfortunately, it is supposed to be raining all day that day but fortunately, I’m staying at the Fontana lodge that night.

I actually did pretty well with the terrain, though after 4 miles it was extremely hard for a couple of miles. That’s because I climbed Jacob’s Ladder, a very steep part of the trail for an extended period. I was tired but eventually made it over. The downside of long uphills is that you then generally have long downhills. They both are hard but the downhills are particularly hard on my toes and knees (though the trekking poles help with the knees, a lot).There was some trail magic at Stecoah Gap, someone had left a bag of breakfast bars and some fresh water  unfortunately for me, within 15 minutes of passing through there a guy set up Trail magic by preparing hot dogs.Bumped into a couple hikers I knew before leaving the trail for a week  MEGA and Garfield were back in the trail  it was great to catch up with both  also met shark tooth and since I’m heading so the west to Nadine her gave me a shark tooth (he has a lot of teeth he has found on beaches).  The rest of the hike was as usual, fun, hard, rewarding and a bit painful.  Made the decision at the last Shelter before Fontana to continue on to the Dam.  I was at the end of my limits and was happy to finally arrive, that last mile seemed to take forever.After arriving at the lodge it was great talking a shower!  Got cleaned up and joined several hikers at dinner in the restaurant.  Had a “super food” salad with grilled chicken, delicious!Got back to my room and relaxed watching A&Ms women’s basketball team when their game in overtime!  Then off for a great nights sleep!","Locust Cove Gap

I don't recall the hike itself being particularly hard but just trying to beat the rain.  But to no avail.  The rain started when I was about 2 miles from the shelter and quickly became a downpour.  I had been hearing thunder in the distance for a while and it eventually caught up with me as well and within a half mile of the shelter, already soaking wet and hiking in streams of water pouring down the trail, I hunkered down for about 10 minutes letting the lightening pass by.  This included hiking over Rocky Top in high winds.  That was actually fun but unfortunately no views. Arrived at the shelter cold and wet but knowing that tomorrow was going to be more of the same with rain the entire day.  Welcome to the Smokies!  Tonight was my first night to sleep in a shelter and it was packed.  The shelters in the Smokies are particularly nice.  The ones I saw and stayed in were all double deckers, would hold up to 14 - 15 hikers, had a fire place and were well sealed on the 3 sides to reduce winds.  We were jammed in shoulder to shoulder.  Not my best nights sleep but it wasn't too bad. ","Mollies Gap Shelter

The people at the shelter had no idea.  I woke up around 1 am needing to go pee.  Slipped on my crocs, went outside the shelter to do my thing and as soon as I tried I got the feeling that if I relaxed my muscles I would absolutely poop my pants.  Wow, that would be an unrecoverable mess!  I kept trying but no luck, so went back into the shelter looking for my toilet paper.  Unfortunately, it was not easily accessible without using my headlamp (a no no in the shelter late at night) or without making a lot of noise (another lesson learned, always know where your tp is!).  Not much I could do so I went back up the trail leading away from the shelter about 50 yards, went off into the woods looking for a small tree I could hold onto and squat behind.  At this point I had my headlamp on and was using the red light.  Found a spot, and it was a good thing as my muscles were getting tired of holding the inevitable back, dug a hole with a stick and quickly did my business.  Of course, I had no tp.  Fortunately it had not rained that day so dry leaves were in abundance.  I just hoped the leaves I used weren't occupied by some spider or other insect I wasn't interested in introducing to my rear end.  All in all the experience went very well and now I felt like a real mountain man after wiping myself with leaves and was pretty proud of myself as I walked back to the shelter to my warm quilt (did I mention it was cold as well?).  Another valuable lesson learned on the trail.","Mt Collins Shelter

A side note, yesterday, April 8, the ATC sent an email saying Cosby Knob was closed due to a Bear destroying a tent to get food. No one was hurt but it will be hard on hikers forced to go another 5-6 miles to get to the last shelter in the park. 
Rain lasted for 2.5 hours. Of course, the trails were covered with water and mud and were slippery. Started west all the way to Standing Bear farms. My shirts were soaked and already had lost any traction with over 450 miles in them. That wasn’t a good thing. 
While trying to avoid the mud in the trail I stepped to the left, slightly uphill. Both feet slipped out from under need to the right and I came down hard on the side of my left shoulder.  It hurt immediately and was the kind of plan that makes you slightly light headed it to me a couple of moments to get up but nothing felt damaged, just hurt. 
Finally reached Davenport Gap, the end of the smokies!  Put my permit in the hiker box and we continued on. The trail winds down a mountain towards I-40. Crossed a beautiful creek 4 times and even took the opportunity to let the Creek wash the mud off my shoes. 
Just before reaching the interstate there was a bag with Trail magic in it. Apples and little Debby cakes!  And also a soda. That Apple was delicious. 
About 3 miles to Standing Bear but before we got there I wasn’t done with my slippery feet and slides. The trail curved left and my hiking poles got inside my right foot, tripping me to the right. The hill was steep heading down and I started a slide on my ass. It was actually fun, especially when a tree 6’ down stopped my side. Painless was able to give me a hand to get back up. 
Finally made it to Standing Bear and luck was with us. The treehouse was available!  It is two tiny rooms, one stacked on top of the other. Painless took the top and I took the bottom. Just outside my door was a Creek that I was able to lay in to relieve my sore shoulder and feet. It was definitely cold!  Then meet Aquaman in the hiker kitchen, found out he is an occupational therapist, and he felt around my shoulder, had me move it, and thought it was a deep muscle bruise  he gave me a couple of exercises to strengthen the muscles around the one hurt  I thanked him and bought him a soda.  
Was fun hanging out with other hikers  we had pizza and beer for lunch and resupplied some of our food.  The hostel works on the honor system, you carry a clipboard around and write whatever you take and then settle at the end.  Had a great spaghetti dinner and then off to my room to organize for the next day.  Good day and happy to be heading for Hot Springs. ","Cosby Knob Shelter

Very miserable at times, cold hands all day, numb fingers. Your name it, just wasn’t comfortable. But it was the trail and you take what is thrown at you. I can see days like this chasing people from going in with their hike but it is exact the kind of day that can do the opposite. My take was that this was “an experience “. Something that would end, it wasn’t going to significantly hurt me but something I would remember as part of my hike. 
The elevation gain was mostly in the forest 4 miles with 2 hard climbs and going to Max Patch. Max Psych is a famous area for day hikers as well with easy access from parking lot near the top and s1.5 mile loop trail. Basically, it is a Bald with just tall grasses on top of the mountain but has incredible views. The trail goes right up and over the middle of the patch and is generally something you take your time doing. Not today. It was just too cold and windy on top. At the very top, on level but muddy trail, I flipped and landed on my right side, covering my pants and pack with mud. Cold mud. 
Got to Shelter around 3.  Couldn’t decide on tent or shelter but with the high winds thought the shelter would be best. Grizz and Ella (formerly Houdini) arrived shortly after and joined us in the shelter. 
This felt like the coldest day in the trail though other days had lower temperatures.  Unfortunately, the shelter was very drafty with open air spaces between the logs the shelter was built with. Sealing that Shelter would be a good future project. 
As there was no good way to warm up, everyone (there were 5 of us in the shelter) got into their sleeping bags/quilts by 6 just to get warm. It took me almost 3 hours to fall sleep but finally did.

Longevity,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635169,"Left early in the morning with Michael and Scout to head to Hot Springs and the famous Smokey Mountain Diner. Got there around 7 and had a huge breakfast. Great way to start back on the trail!  It was fun sharing the time with Michael and Scout. But, with breakfast over it was time for Michael to get back to work and me to hit the trail. Walking out of the restaurant I saw Hillbilly and Kbar heading in. And then starting down the trail through town I hear a “hey Longevity”!  It was Howdy (Aggie class of 2019) heading to the restaurant on the other side of the street. It was nice to know I hadn’t lost all contact with some of the people I had hiked with or stayed in a shelter with. After walking the trail right through downtown Hot Springs you cross the French Broad River, hang a right and followed a path along the banks of the river. Very relaxing and pretty hike.  after a half mile or so the path turns left and starts up a mountain.  I wasn’t 10 feet up the path and I hear another “hey Longevity”!  It was the Wokin Buffalo who was camping near the banks of the river. Not only was he there, he now has a dog with him (Roxy).   Wokin has taken some days off at Hot Springs as well and was getting back on the trail today.  That was 4 people I saw that I already knew so I realized I wasn’t totally separated from familiar faces. Leaving the trail is a two  edged sword. You lose contact with those you have been hiking with but at the same time you are now in the middle of a new group of hikers. That is another of the cool things about the trail. I’m almost 300 miles in and any other thru hiker I meet has hiked the same hike I have. We have a common link that allows us to quickly build a connection. So over the next few days I built new relationships. And it happened very quickly. After visiting with Wokin for a few minutes I started back to the trail. Within 10 minutes I stopped to take some pictures of the river, now well below me, when another hiker started past me. We began visiting and it was a guy named Bob (no trail name, he was just beginning a section hike that day). We had similar hiking speeds and hiked together for the next couple of days. I enjoyed visiting with Bob and hope we connect again in the future. One cool fact about Bob is that he is from Rugby, England. And as you can guess, the home to the origination of Rugby. The days hike wasn’t particularly easy or hard, or maybe I’m in Trail shape. Either way, it was a reasonably warm and  beautiful day. We even took a side Trail to climb a fire tower. Awesome views!Made it to the shelter around 2:30 and set up my tent. Visited with Bob and had time to train him on the WHM. Got water (bit of a hike), ate dinner and retired to my tent. Was able to coordinate with Joseph to reserve a car rental in Johnson City for that Sunday.

Made me wonder what it will be like when he start hitting 90 degrees. But for now, my legs felt sluggish and not 100%. Stopped for lunch and took opportunity to resupply water. Went through close to 4 liters of water. In addition, I add electrolytes to my water. 
The food and rest made a difference and I felt more energetic. Of course, right after lunch I had a hard hill to climb. Was hiking by myself this afternoon but was able to maintain a steady pace. I didn’t know at the time but what I consider, at least for me, the most difficult part of the trail up till now (hard mentally and physically) was just ahead of me. 
At mile eleven I came to what is called Firescald Ridge. But, it was hard, dangerous and challenging (that’s where the mental and physical aspect comes in). Of course, I should add it was maybe the most beautiful part of the trail. At least close to it. It was on a narrow ridge and you could see forever in any direction.  Made it to camp around 4:30 and set up my tent. Also passed the 300 mile mark today!  ","Spring Mountain Shelter

Since I didn’t have to be in Erwin until Sunday i wasn’t in a rush and decided to go to that hostel. Cost was $20 for a bath in the bunkhouse skins with a shower. They also had some food you could microwave or cook on a grill (like hotdogs!). I relaxed, visited with other hikers, adjusted my pack, taught 3 people the WHM and out my feet in the cold water of a nearby creek. Also caught up with videos, notes and charging my devices. The rain did start but the thunderstorms never materialized. And the best part of the resupply is that he has cold beer available!  Was able to make an orthopedic appointment for my shoulder and a podiatrist appointment for my feet while I’m back home for Gail’s birthday. All in all a productive afternoon. Also had my first political discussion on the trail with Legs and Scales (if he kept that name after I suggested it).

Longevity,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635229,"long day in the trail with over 5100 feet in elevation gain along the way.  And that is the west the day started with a 2.5 mile hill to climb. Though of course, it was a beautiful climb (what else is new😊). After the initial climb it was a reasonable trail. Came to next Shelter in 6 miles with intention of getting water and a snack. Didn’t stop for two reasons, the shelter was a couple hundred yards off the trail and there was a rumor of trail magic ahead that was serving breakfast!  Decided to plow ahead and hike for the trail magic.
it was 2 more miles so I picked you the pace.  It’s incredible how your body can respond to the proper motivation.  Believing there was just a chance for trail magic pushed me faster, covering the tiredness of already hiking 7-8 miles (this will be a future lesson learned).  
But for today I kept up the quickened pace and when I heard a holler from Coco (hiking ahead of me) I knew the trail magic was there!  It was set up by Paul, class of 2007.  Unfortunately, the only good place he could park (he was located where the trail goes under interstate 26 at the TN/NC border) was up a very steep road that went to an old cemetery.  Didn’t mind the cemetery, just the steep drive).  But it was with it!  A huge plate of scramble eggs with hash browns, coke cookies and of course, the water I needed.  It was an awesome 30 minute break on a beautiful day.  Paul comes back to this spot every year for 10 days to give back to the trail.  I was lucky as this was his tenth and last day for this year.  In fact, I arrived at 11:30, just 30 minutes before he was packing up and leaving for this year.  Glad I picked up my place to get there!  Paul had lots of extra cookies he didn’t want to take back with him so grabbed a handful before heading back to the trail (and enjoyed the last one for dessert that night).
I like walking under interstates and crossing highways once in a while as they are great reminders of the other universe I used to live in and that I can seemingly reconnect with at a moments notice.  The few moments of sound and sights of normal life help propel me as I enter my trail universe over again.  Whenever you leave a Gap between mountains you are guaranteed one thing, you are about to head uphill and generally it is long and sometimes steep to get you back to trail “altitude”.  Powered by the good food and calories (mentally and physically) I started off strong. But this was one of the gaps where the hike back up was long and steep in many places and it began to take its toll on me as I still had 8 miles to go including climbing up and over Bald Mountain.
And Bald Mountain was hard!  Parts were very steep and rocky.  A hard combination I’ve come to accept and maybe, slightly, somehow come to reluctantly enjoy.  it was slow going and my feet hurt but finally made it to the top.  The views were awesome!  A great reward for the hard work.  Thank you nature!  Still had 1 mile to the shelter and arrived around 3:30-4:00.  Replenished my water, set up my tent just before s small rain storm came through.  Fixed dinner and then settled into my tent for the night. Another great day.","Laurel Hostel

Wasn’t sure of how far I would go today. Started the day thinking 10 miles and would finish into Erwin Sunday morning before catching a shuttle to Johnson City and Enterprise car rental.  Enterprises doesn’t open until 1 on Sundays so there is no rush. Not sure if I mentioned in yesterday’s post about Bald Mountain. It is both bald and beautiful!  It’s awesome to climb these huge mountains through the trees and step out into a huge grassy area. Not one tree. Love the 360 degree views from the top of old Bald. Left camp around 7:30 and it was relatively easy terrain and was making good time. Rain was forecast for the afternoon but I should be at the next Shelter before then. Even took time to climb a side trail that went to the top of a rock formation called High Rocks. Only about 30-40 feet above me but there were few trees to block the views and the views were great!  Rested for 10 minutes and had a snack.Made it to the shelter in under 5 hours and claimed a spot inside since rain and storms were coming.  Had lunch as other hikers tricked in. Hillbilly with Kbar and Pappy were next to arrive. They took a long break and had lunch but with the plans to continue on to Erwin. It was just another 6 miles with the majority of that being downhill.Then No Rush arrived with the same plans, to eat and continue on.   I made a quick decision to join him and head to Erwin today. The weather was a concern and there were reports of a Bear who destroyed a tent and stole food 2 nights before (the hiker was tented away from the shelter but was back at the shelter eating dinner when it happened).  The last deciding factor, and the most important one is that my sleeping pad was 6” longer than the shelter was deep. This was the first time that had happened and knew a nights sleep there would be uncomfortable.  In addition, I felt really good and wasn’t tired after the initial 10 miles.  So I packed up and headed out to Erwin with No Rush. It was only 1:30 so had plenty of time.Made it one mile before the rain started. It was more of a light drizzle that would pretty much last until I got close to Erwin.  Put on my rain jacket which also helped with the cold wind when it would gust. These last 6 miles weren’t exhausting but my legs and feet were starting to get sore. Plus, due to the rain I was moving slower and being cautious, aware of the slippery conditions. But what really propelled me towards Erwin was the knowledge that I was heading home the next day to surprise Gail. Is was definitely excited!Arrived at Uncle Johnny’s at 4:15, drizzling off and on. Relaxed on their porch with No Rush and others. The hostel was full that night so No Rush and I agreed to share a room at the Super 8 motel. We were able to get a ride there for $5 from Johnny’s shuttle. Arrived at hotel at 5:45, cleaned up and we both walked to a nearby Food City grocery store to find dinner. I got some chicken, fresh salad from a salad bar and a pint of Ben and Jerry’s ice cream (Cherry Garcia) along with a six pack of Shiner Bock!  Took back to hotel and relaxed in room while eating dinner.  Visited with No Rush until 10.  I like the way No Rush speaks his mind.  Not in a rude way but in a respectful way.  Great lesson for me in finding “my voice” while on the trail. Tomorrow will be an exciting day!","Bald Mountain Shelter

Did hike an extra 4 tenths of a  mile when I missed a turn off the trail and followed another side trail to a rock outcropping with views of Erwin. While I did enjoy the view it wasn’t worth the extra steps and time. Eventually figured it out and backtracked to the AT. 
The hike today wasn’t bad.  Either the ups were reasonable or my body is stronger now and what was once hard is now reasonable. Regardless, it was a good hiking day. 
Weather was cold and windy with temps in the high 40s and hiked most of the day in my rain jacket.  One good thing is that the rocks under my feet didn’t hurt or bother me. Hoping the wide boots work out. 
Got to camp around 2:30 and stopped here to keep the mileage down. 
Definitely looking forward to sleeping in my tent tonight. Climbing in, out of the wind, feels so warm. Especially when I get under my quilt.

Because of ankle I wasn’t going to try and make it to Station 19 hostel which was 18 miles down the trail. Instead, I set my sights on a campground that would leave me around 6 miles the next day. First, I had to climb Roan Mountain. Wasn’t as bad as I thought with a reasonably easy up and down. Roan was covered with trees so there were no views to speak of. However, I came down the mountain into Carvers Gap.  A Highway goes through the Gap and there was plenty of parking there for day and section hikers. When you reach Carvers Gap you can see straight up Round Bald and Jane Bald and then another Bald after that one. Love the open spaces on the mountains. Of course, seeing the length and slope of Jane Bald, combined with my ankle, and I knew it would be a long day. By now the ankle is hurting pretty good with every step, particularly downhill. The beauty of the hike helped take my mind off my ankle but I was beginning to wonder what kind of impact this was going to have on my hike. Heading up the Balds I pass mile 4 on the day and the ankle is killing me now.   Coming down Roan Mountain I saw Aquaman again. Once again. He gives me advice on my injury- rest, ice, compression, elevate and anti inflammatories. Kept hiking though a bit slower and with a limp. Eventually I got over Little Hump Mountain. I was done for the day and stayed at the campsite at mile 388. The weather today has gone from snowing on Roan Mountain (just a little) to just cold and windy. More rain was expected that evening. I pitched my tent at 1:30 and called it a day. Professor came in and set up his tent as well. Hung out, visited, stretched, massaged ankle and went for water that afternoon.

The ankle hurt, but nothing like yesterday. Headed uphill first and the hike took my mind off the ankle. After about a half mile you exit the forest and step into another Bald with views forever.  Between the morning light and the mountain shadows, I was given one of the best views I’ve had on the trail. Up and ahead of me I could see the trail go up Hump Mountain and it seemed to go on forever. Just like they teach you in art class when trying to draw a line that disappears in the distance. It was an awesome visual and felt like you could see all the way to the top of the mountain. This would be a great spot to come back with the family and share together. Though you could see the trail way in the distance (and way up) the hike up was easy. On the way I could look back and see Professor exit the forest. He was just a speck on the horizon. After the climb I had 5 miles of downhill. Maybe because I was going slower than usual or maybe because the overall downhill wasn’t too bad, the pain never flared up. There were a few rocky sections but they weren’t a problem. We arrived at highway 19 E and we just sat on a rock to rest. Saw a car drop off several hikers (it was the mom and her 4 sons) and that shuttle was from Station 19. I crossed the highway to verify she could take us back.

No other way than to start hiking and see how it feels.  plus, I’m going to slackpack, or hike without my heavy pack, so not having the extra weight will help. Though, I will carry a small pack they loan me for water and snacks as I’ll be gone about 7 hours. Station 19 will drop me off on a forest service road at trail mile 408.9 and then I will hike southbound back to highway 19 which is 13.3 miles. Weather is good and the lighter weight will help. If it still hurts, that is not good.   I was dropped off at 9:20 and started hiking immediately. Unfortunately, the shin started hurting within the first half mile and it just continued to get worse. In addition, my boots are definitely too small and soon my toes were hurting as well. Oh well, at least I know and am not in the middle of a mountain and days away from a hostel or hotel. On the bright side, the trail was awesome!  Relatively level and the trail itself was mostly smooth and soft with pine needles and leaves. Weather wise, the day started overcast and cool but ended up sunny and warm. And best of all, there were several water features asking the trail. From a nice creek to a river that the trail followed  for a bit to a couple of waterfalls. One in particularly was tall and beautiful (Jones  Falls). I stopped at Jones Falls (only a quarter mile round trip from the trail), took off my boots and soaked my feet in the cold water and had lunch. Great spot!Continued down the trail and arrived back at the highway around 3:45.  Disappointed to say the least and now face some decisions. Either find good footwear that I can continue with or just go home early (vs end of May) and rest my leg. Talking with Gail I decided to have her ship me my other pair of Altras and see if that makes any difference. That means I’m stuck at the hostel for at least 2 more nights but it is worth a roll of the dice to see if it works. I love station 19 but am getting tired of not hiking and am ready to move on.

The trail was a bit over a half mile from the hostel so hiked that and then started up the trail from the highway. I was already encouraged before I got to the trail but didn’t want to get too excited too soon. Hiked a mile up hill, a nice gentle up hill, then turned around and headed back to the highway. Did close to 4 miles and I’m excited to say there was NO pain!  The Altra Lone Peaks definitely made a difference, as I hoped they would. Can’t say how happy I was!  My choice was to determine if I could go on hiking or did I need to head home. Both would have been a good choice but do look forward to getting a couple hundred more miles in before going home later in May.But my stay at station 19 has had its moments. I’ve met many interesting, even inspirational hikers. The conversations have always been interesting and helpful.

Wake up early, do WHM breathing in bed, go downstairs around 6:15 to make coffee and then visit with other hikers as they trickle into the kitchen area. Back to my bunk at 7:30 to load and prepare my pack before breakfast around 8. Same breakfast, still good. Not sure if I mentioned but the breakfasts are free due to “Trail magic” from donations from around the world through the website Dave has set up. Thank you everyone who donated!
After breakfast I taught Dan (father of Jill) the WHM  after that, just waiting around for a ride back to the trail 13.5 trail miles north and eventually arrived back to the trail and continued my northbound trek at 9:50.  
Beautiful day, sun came out and it was warm and an glad cold temps are almost done!  I know there are still some cold nights in my future but soon I’ll be able to leave me winter gear out of my pack and save at least 3 pounds.  
Arrived at a shelter and Cheeks and Superman were there.  Unfortunately  they were staying the day due to some stomach bug.  Kept my distance, visited for a bit while I ate lunch and then continued on.  
Good hike today, went 10.5 miles but could have gone farther but didn’t want to push too hard my first day back.  BTW, my Lone Peak shoes are doing awesome  but the tips of my toes seem to be a bit cramped and sore but that could be residual from my boots.  
Found a stealth site, my first truly, room for one tent, stealth camping experience.    Was at mile 419.4.  I looked forward to not having to worry about making noise as I packed up in the morning.
During the late afternoon/evening, 4 people hiked past and I visited with each of them (including Washer).  It is like sitting on your front porch at home and speaking with the neighbors as they walk past.  Another cool aspect of the trail!  
The night went well, one of my best sleeping nights on the trail.  Felt rested and ready for the day.  Started off with packing what I could, stretching on my mat and then making breakfast.  All that and I was still ready to go within an hour.  Only complaint with this site was poor cell signal.  ","Station 19 E

The first 1.5 miles were interesting, especially an old, rotted wooden cabin. But the next 5 or so miles were incredible!  Those 5 miles currently are my favorite part of the trail. 
I was entering Laurel Canyon, which was incredible! The first 2 of those 5 miles were easy and beautiful. There were cuts through the rock with walls on either side of the trail going up 30’. Was thinking that somehow they were natural but after thinking more about it I’m not sure how this would have been natural. Regardless, it was a great way to enter the canton.  Almost like it was a portal to another place. 
Once in, the canyon rose 200-300 feet on either side. Continuing on the path starts a fairly steep decline downto the bottom where I would find Laurel Falls. Easily the best waterfall on the trail so far (not counting Amicalola). The path down was built at some point in the past with huge stone steps, each placed individually. Can’t imagine how hard this was to accomplish. 
Once at the bottom, the falls were loud and close and beautiful to watch. I took off my pack, sat on a log and just watched and listened. I love the feel of the energy from a waterfall.  Even took the time for a round of WHM breathing. Found a spot slightly down river to take off my shoes and put my feet in the cold, flowing water. Felt great!
Once I was ready to head back out it was hard to see where the trail went. It seemed to end against some huge boulders. Turns out, the path is cut into boulders that jut out over the river. Hard to see from a distance but a fun part of the hike. 
After that, crossed a few bridges over the river and then followed the river for a while before the trail headed uphill to get up and over Pond Mountain. My body needed to reacquaint itself with long and sometimes steep uphills, so I was a bit slow (but steady).  It felt good to be going up again. The downhill was hard on my toes as usual. The last 2.5 miles took a while but eventually made it to the bottom of the mountain, which is also where Boots Off is located nearby. 
Got to the hostel, secured my bunk and rested with Two Pans and Logan and taught them both the WHM. Shuttled into town at 6 for resupply (I didn’t need much) and to get dinner at subway. Got back, ate dinner and settled into my bunk to follow the nfl first round draft.

When leaving the trail I entered a farm or ranch property that had beautiful rolling hills of grass and you could see the trail slicing through it.  A very pretty scene. 
There were very inspiring ups and downs and more great views.  Along the way I saw Puff and Kiki (and their dog Hutch) who were stopped for lunch.  We started talking and they asked how I got my trail name m, so Wim Hof came up, they were interested and I ended up training them.

",Abingdon Gap Shelter,"May 01, Sat",16.20
Longevity,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637337,"I am pumped for today.  I'm reaching Damascus, VA which represents a major milestone for me.  Before the hike I mentally divided the trail into four section and each would represent a major step along the way to my thru hike.  Here are the 4 sections as I see them.  This is strictly my view and opinion.
Section One - Springer Mountain to Damascus - Being the first section for NOBO's, it is a hard section.  There is very little that would be considered easy in these first 470 miles.  For us more novice backpackers we are ""learning on the job"" to become comfortable with living out of a backpack, in all types of weather, day in and day out.  Learning what foods to carry, provide nutrition and are easy to prepare.  In addition, this is the time to gain your trail legs as the ups and downs of Georgia and North Carolina help prepare you for the Smoky Mountains.  You also experience first hand the beauty of being this connected to nature on a daily basis.  You are meeting new people daily some of whom will become part of your ""tramily"".  There are many, many lessons learned here, including the high risks the AT presents.  The saying is very true, your hike can end on any step you take.  Almost happened to me on Rocky Mountain.  Section one is an awesome beginning to the trail!
Section Two - Damascus to Harpers Ferry - 556 miles with almost all of those in Virginia.  I'm only about 65 miles into VA as of now and definitely look forward to hiking the rest of of the state, particularly the Shenandoah Mountains.  With Harpers Ferry being the approximate halfway point (within 70 miles) this is a logical stopping point for section two.
Section Three - Harpers Ferry to Northern CT - There are only 50 - 60 miles of the trail that goes through CT.  I'm told that Southern CT is more New York and Northern CT is more New England.  So I'm splitting the difference and will say the third section is the same distance as section one, about 470 miles.  I've hear a lot about this part of the trail and look forward to experiencing it, but it is just a lead up to all of New England.
Section Four - Northern CT to Mt Katahdin - This is the longest section of the trail at 697 miles.  Can't wait to hike through New England, the Berkshires, White Mountains, 100 mile Wilderness and of course, Mt. Katahdin!
That's my personal view of the trail and how I have divided it mentally.  This provides more context to get my head around in terms of the enormity of hiking the complete trail.  Looking forward  to completing section two!
Back to my day of hiking to Damascus.  It was a relatively easy hike of 10 miles, with only 961 feet of elevation gain.  I left camp at 7:20, not far behind Biscuit and just ahead of Tranny (he was hammocking near my tent site).  I caught up to Biscuit at the TN-VA border where he had stopped to enjoy the view, take some pictures and have some coffee.  I took off my pack and joined him for coffee but only after pictures at the border!  Huge milestone and now only 3 miles from Damascus!  Biscuit and I left together and enjoyed the hike into lower elevations.  We could literally see the change in the forest around us as the amount and size of leaves became larger, more dense and greener the further we went downhill.  The amount of green was incredible.  With sunlight filtering through the trees everything had a green hue to it.  I felt like I had on green tinted glasses.  It was beautiful.  
We finally descended into Damascus and you are instantly out of the woods and in a small neighborhood at the edge of town.  The population of Damascus at the 2010 census was 814.  It is a small city.  Some hikers were disappointed in Damascus.  I'm not sure what they expected and it was exactly what I expected and had hoped for.  A small town that is hiker friendly with a few amenities that hikers would appreciate.  There were 2-3 good restaurants (especially the Damascus Diner), 3 outfitters, several hostels, full size grocery store and of course, a Dollar General.  
Biscuit hung out in the park you walk through coming into town while I went ahead.  I walked into town (the trail goes down the main street), found the Damascus Diner and waited outside for Biscuit to catch up.  Eventually he came walking down the street with Tinny, who had camped next to me the night before.  Turns out Tinny had been looking for me because I had left me tent stakes at the campsite!  And that was in spite of my specifically walking around my campsite that morning to ensure I hadn't left anything behind.  What a rookie mistake!  The 3 of us went into the diner, sat at the counter and ordered lunch.  I was so happy I bought a beer for Tinny.  That would have been quite the surprise if I only learned about my tent stakes after I hiked 14 miles out of town.  What a surprise and disaster that would have been.
BTW, I had meatloaf, mashed potatoes with gravy and green beans for lunch.  What a delicious treat!
After lunch I walked down to the Broken Fiddle hostel where I had a bunk reserved for the night.  Got my gear situated at my bunk (#10) and went back out to explore the town and specifically the outfitters.  I still need to make a footwear change.  The Altra's definitely eliminated the shin splint issues but the Lone Peaks 4.5 I'm wearing are too minimalist for my feet.  By the end of each day my feet are beat up by the rocks and roots we are constantly hiking over.  So my goal was to check out the Altra Olympus, a shoe that many hikers wear and just like with packs, I talk to those who have the same gear to get their thoughts.  And the Olympus wearers love their shoes.
I wear size 12.5 now but needed a 13 to fit my feet.  With the wide toe box of the Altra's the shoe felt awesome.  So I bit the bullet and bought a pair.  It is a risk changing footwear without having a chance to test it first.  But I feel like it was low risk since both pair are from the same manufacturer and are of similar design (wide toe box and zero drop).  The only noticeable difference was the significant amount of cushioning with the Olympus.  Hikers and their shoes are like hikers and their packs.  We tend to love and support what we have and these two critical gear items seem to garner the most attention (with tents right behind).  Even though you may have had some issues with your particular gear, I find it interesting how we (hikers) will defend what we are carrying, primarily because that is what we have.  
Wore my new shoes out of the store and headed back to the hostel to drop off the old shoes (I'll ship them home tomorrow).  Then went across the street and bought a single beer at a convenience store.  They had an old table outside the store so I decided to stop there and just watch the world go by.  Due to the lumber industry there is a surprisingly high number of 18 wheelers hauling trees going through town.  I was just sitting and enjoying the day when Tinny walked up.  He grabbed a beer and joined me outside.  We sat and visited for a good 1.5 to 2 hours.  A few other hikers waked by and we visited but I had a chance to really get to know Tinny.  Great and interesting guy and I'm glad we had the time to sit and visit.  
Beaver and Ramble On came by on their way to dinner so we joined them at a restaurant called 7 Trails.  Had a good dinner (this is another good restaurant) and then headed back to the hostel for the night.  I was concerned it may be warm in the hostel and I was correct.  Between the warm conditions, lights that were on and plenty of noise, it took a while to get to sleep.","Abingdon Gap Shelter

We started out in lousy conditions.  Throughout the morning we had wind (gusts up to 30mph according to the atweather.org app and it seemed to reach or exceed regularly), rain, snow and freezing rain.  We had one particularly long climb that morning up and over Mt Rogers, the highest peak in Virginia.  Good news is that the weather took my mind off the climb (we didn't summit Mt Rogers, there was a blue blaze side trail to the top).  We finally made it down and to the beginning of Grayson Highlands!  This is one of the major landmarks on the trail that I've been looking forward to.  
It was still cold and windy.  The rain had let up but we were continuously in a fog bank which didn't change until we started down a mountain/hill in the Highlands.  Finally, the sun broke through but the wind continued.  So far we haven't seen any ponies but the beauty of the terrain (particularly the rocks and boulders) was awesome.  The rocks were enough that they took a decent amount of concentration to hike.  Not just physically but sometimes finding the trail through the boulders wasn't easy.
About this time Caruso caught up with us.  He had been trying to catch us for 6 miles to hike with us.  And it was a good thing as he has an eye for detail and spotted the first ponies we saw on the trail!  We eventually saw 7 ponies before we left the park (at least at the time I thought we were leaving).  The ponies were something I had been looking forward to for a long time and definitely want to come back with Gail when the weather is clear and warm.  
Got down to Massey Gap where we were to be picked up by the owner (Dennis I believe) of the Grayson General Store and Inn.  He arrived after 30 minutes and took the 3 of us in his truck (we had to sit in the back of the truck, the owner was still very cautious with Covid and exposure to people).  It was a cold ride to his place which was about a 20 minute ride down a windy mountain road.  It was clear Dennis had made this drive many times as he was quick around the many curves.  We arrived and got into our rooms.  Pinto and I shared a suite (I think there are a total of 4 rooms) that had a kitchen and 2 bedrooms along with a washer and dryer.  While I enjoyed Dennis, the Inn and his General Store, I felt like he did view hikers as a way to chip away at us for dollars.  Every little thing was extra, including detergent to use the laundry and coffee to use in the coffee pot in the room.  At $140 per night I felt like those would have been nice amenities to provide to hikers.  Particularly if you are trying to develop that market.  From Dennis's perspective, he only has 4 rooms so providing these extra's probably isn't necessary.  Guess I've been spoiled by some of the great hostels on the trail.  On the positive side, the rooms were clean, the deli was good, the resupply was OK, not great but not bad either. 

We hung out, cleaned and dried our gear and purchased the makings for a spaghetti dinner that evening.  Caruso joined us and we had a great time eating a home cooked meal.  Also had the chance to train Caruso in the WHM.  Had a good nights sleep and in the morning we packed up and waited for Dennis to drive us back to Massie Gap.","Whitetop Mountain Road - mile 492.5

Longevity,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638159,"We had a relaxing time in our one night at the Grayson General Store Inn.  Pinto and I shared a suite that had 2 bedrooms and a kitchen along with the washer and dryer for the complex.  This was a successful night off the trail.  I dried my gear, did laundry, had a good dinner, slept in a bed and resupplied.  Now ready to get back on the trail!  We weren't able to get our ride back to the trail until about 8:45.  Another 15 minute ride on windy country roads (not to mention it was cold in the back of the truck) but by 9 we were ready to go.  Just a half mile hike from the parking area to get back to the AT.The ride back to Grayson Highlands was uphill so by the time we arrived the air temperature was in the 30's plus the wind was blowing.  We saw one more pony but kept moving.  With the cold and wind we were focused on moving and staying warm.  The views were incredible and I want to come back to the Highalnds with Gail at some point and take our time wondering around the park.  We finally exited the park and then entered Scales Fields.  Basically, an expansive open field of boulders and grass.  We were exposed to the elements and the cold and wind just seemed to get worse.  It was about 2 miles across this bald and every step I was looking forward to being back in the trees.Once back in the trees it did warm up but the winds stayed high.  Now the trail became very rocky for a long while.  We finally reached a road crossing and there we found trail magic!  Hot dogs, chips, fruit and awesome as usual!  The guy hosting the trail magic was Mr. Clean along with this wife.  And as usual we were incredibly grateful.  There were already several hikers there including Washer and Amazing.  I asked Amazing about the nerve pain behind my left shoulder and she showed me some stretches I could use.  We continued on to Old Orchard Shelter and stopped for lunch.  After the trail magic I was still hungry.  Caruso didn't stop and continued on.  He wanted to continue on with more miles today than we planned.  So it was goodbye after a great couple of days getting to know him.We arrived at Hurricane Mountain Shelter around 3:30, set up tents (not at the shelter but at a small 2 tent site along the trail before the side trail to the shelter).  At 5:30 we walked up to the shelter to cook dinner (could use the table).  Also, I had a cell signal at the shelter that I didn't have at my tent site so was able to call home and speak to Gail and Tasha.  The day was cold but it was another great day on the trail.  I have a few aches and pains I need to resolve, particularly my shoulder and nerve pain, but it somehow doesn't bother you as bad when you are out in nature.  After 500 plus miles you expect to have physical issues. You just hope the issues aren't the type that force you to leave the trail.","Massie Gap

Longevity,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638319,"""Woke up, got out of bed, dragged a comb across my head"", Pretty much that was my early morning summed up well by Paul McCartney.  Though I did my WHM breathing.  It was a fast and easy morning.  Up at 5:50, out of tent at 6:30 already mostly packed.  Went up to the shelter to use the privy.  When I got out of the tent I saw that someone had hung a bear bag from a tree right next to my tent.  Must have done this just before it was dark as headlamps would have woken me up.  They were quiet but I don't know what the hell they were thinking as this was incredibly bad form.  Would definitely talk to whoever it was when they come to remove the bag.  Except, when I got back from the privy (gone about 15 minutes) the bag was gone!  Whoever it was timed it perfectly with me being gone and Pinto still in his tent.  And he didn't hear anything when they removed it.  Wish I had been there when they came to retrieve it.
Had a quick breakfast of 2 pop tarts and then we were ready to go.  Left camp at 7:40 with a plan for only 9 miles today to the next shelter (the famous Partnership Shelter where you can order in pizza from Marion, VA).  It wasn't a long hike today and there was nothing unusual about the terrain.  It was pretty with some good views and decent cell coverage along the way.  Since today is Mothers Day, I took opportunities to call Gail (I had spoken to Tasha earlier in the morning) and wish them both a great Mothers Day!  When I sent my shoes back home from Damascus I added a small drawing of a flower for Gail.  Played a little phone tag calling my mom in Houston but eventually was able to speak to Susan (sister in law), Gloria (sister) and mom!  Also able to text Adrienne (daughter), Emily and Beth (both daughters in law).  Everyone a great mom and Tasha a mom to be!
We arrived at the shelter at 12:30.  No question I would rather be hiking than stopping this early in the day but I'm sticking with Pinto because 1) I like him and hiking with him, we definitely have interesting conversations and 2) we are sticking together with hopes of getting to Charlotte, either from Bland, VA in 6 days where his wife will pick us up or tomorrow or Tuesday if we can find a shuttle from  Marion to Charlotte.  
Hung out at the shelter during the afternoon visiting with other hikers.  This shelter is know for having a large rat snake that lives in the walls of the shelter that does a good job of keeping the rat population down.  The shelter was also the first one I had seen with a fireplace inside the shelter (unlike in the Smokies where each shelter had a fireplace but they were separate from the sleeping areas).  
There was one interesting happening on the hike today. I was hiking by myself (Pinto had gone ahead when I stopped to make my Mothers Day calls), the sun was out and the leaves were dry.  My left foot came down and I heard rustling in the leaves a few inches from my foot.  It was a garter snake that had just attacked an Eastern Slimy Black Salamander.  Immediately I got my phone out and the camera on and was able to record the majority of the struggle and eventual swallowing of the salamander by the snake.  It was fascinating to watch nature in action with the ""circle of life"" on full display.  The salamander had no defense but was trying to escape the snake but once the snake was able to position itself to coil around the salamander it was all over but swallowing the salamander whole (about 5"" long).  I loved being able to sneak a peek at nature.Started dinner around 5:30, a Knorr side (Teriyaki Rice with tuna).  Dinner was good but unfortunately it was soon after that the evening took a turn for the worse.  In my dad's words, I became discombobulated.  First, in trying to finish all of the liquid left over from my dinner I carried the plastic pouch I are from to my tent, once there I checked my watch for the time and in doing to I rotated the hand that was holding the pouch with the liquid in it.  Of course, it poured out onto my shirt and pants.  Great!  Now I smell like a can of tuna fish and painted a target on my back for bears.  I washed off as best I could, got out of the clothes and put them in a plastic bag I had and then stored my clothes with me food in a bear box at the shelter (glad they had a bear box here!).  Next, in changing my clothes I got my socks wet but I finally was able to settle down to reading for a bit in my tent.  This was around 7:00 and rain had just started falling.  Love the sound of the rain hitting my tent knowing I'm safe and dry, particularly when there isn't a thunderstorm to go with the rain.  The rain picked up in intensity but I was enjoying my book.  I was reading by laying down on my mat and using my pillow.  After 15 - 20 minutes of reading I was ready to go to sleep.  I had put my hand behind my head and discovered water in my tent!  What the hell!  Apparently, while laying down my head and pillow had pushed the bottom of my tent out beyond the roof of the tent, which allowed water running down the roof to enter the tent.  I didn't realize this for at least 15 minutes so there was a decent amount of water inside this end of my tent.  I went into action.  First, I got my quilt off the ground and back in my pack (I had brought the pack inside my tent when the rain began).  Can't afford for the down quilt to get wet.  Next, I pulled out a lightweight towel I carry and started soaking up the water.  It was seeped under my closed cell foam pad that I put under my inflatable pad.  Basically, it took me 30 minutes to get things cleaned up, all my gear stowed back inside the pack.  Now I could start figuring out to keep this from happening again.  The key is to keep my body centered between the two ends of the tent by sleeping from one corner to the opposite corner.  The closed cell foam pad helps keep me from sliding during the night.  Once I got that worked out the rain had let up enough for me to lower the height of my tent by lowering my trekking poles.  I then gout outside and was able to pull the edge of the roof closer to the ground reducing the risk I could push the floor of the tent past the roof again.  Finally, I was comfortable enough that I fixed the problem that I was able to get my quilt back out and was able to get a decent nights sleep.","Hurricane Mountain Shelter

Longevity,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638386,"Fortunately, after last night, there were no issues packing up this morning.  The rain has stopped but the damage was done as we will have a wet and muddy trail to hike on today.  We are going 9.3 miles to the famous Partnership Shelter.  It is located close to the Mt Rogers Visitor Center which is on a local highway and near the town of Marion, VA.  The cool thing is that you can order food (using a phone at the visitor center as there is no cell coverage here) and have it delivered to the shelter.  We don't have plans for that as we will be taking the local bus service for a free ride into town and to a hotel we are staying at.  So off we go to deal with the mud.  Otherwise not a bad hike with only 1,900 feet in total elevation gain.On the way I was able to get coverage and confirm our ride tomorrow from Marion to Charlotte!  Look forward to being home for a few weeks.  Now the focus is getting to the shelter so we can be there for the shuttle into town and our hotel.  Then clean up and a hot dinner.Besides being wet and muddy the hike was reasonably cold as well.  Fortunately, that hasn't been the typical weather we have had, though there have been plenty of cold and wet days.Arrived to the shelter around noon and headed to the visitors center (200 - 300 yards away).  There were several other hikers waiting there as well.  Some waiting on friends before they continued on and some waiting for the same shuttle bus we were there for.  We did get a chance to meet the ""dirty bubble"".  A tramily that has gained that nickname as a group.  No one knows exactly how they got that name but as a group others have accused them of stealing shoelaces.  After talking with them I'm sure they are just another tramily that enjoys being together.  There were nice and enjoyed visiting with many of them.  Bus arrived around 2:15 so we boarded for the 10 minute ride to town.  Fortunately, the bus dropped us off at our hotel, the Travel Inn.  An old hotel that is hiker friendly and clean.  We got into our room and started cleaning gear and cleaning up ourselves, including laundry.  The big bonus of this hotel is that it is walking distance to a Mexican Restaurant!  Enjoyed Mexican food for the first time on trail and it hit the spot.Back to room, final gear cleaning and repacking and then to bed.  Tomorrow we will be picked up around 8:30 on the first leg home for both of us.","Trimpi Shelter

Longevity,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640020,"Yeah!  Back on the trail after over a month off.  Lots has happened since I last wrote.  First, and most important, my daughter had a healthy baby boy (Archer) born on June 7th!  I'm glad I was able to be home for the weeks leading up to the birth and of course to be here when he came home.  
On top of that great news there was some not so great news.  Remember that fall I had in the Smoky Mountains?  Well, it turns out I tore my left rotator cuff on that fall.  Surprisingly it didn't bother me while hiking, putting on my pack, etc.  The only time my shoulder was sore was when trying to sit or get off the ground while using my left arm.  With only soreness I thought it would eventually heal.  Well, 2 months later it still hurt so I went back to the Dr.  He ordered a MRI which revealed a full tear of the Supraspinatus tendon.  
My plans up until June 10th were to fly to MA, take a bus to the AT in Western Mass and continue from there to Katahdin.  After reaching Katahdin I would travel back to Western Mass and continue my hike SOBO to Marion, VA.  I met with my Dr that morning for the MRI results and then learned about the full tendon tear.  I asked if surgery could wait until after I complete the trail but he would prefer not saying that scar tissue could build up  and limit his ability to fully repair with surgery.  So, I made the decision to schedule surgery for June 30th.  However, with the Dr's approval, I decided to go back on the trail for a week.  This would help me ""get the trail out of my system"" for this year and bring some level of closure prior to my surgery.  It would also allow me to get another 100 or so miles down the trail.
I left home that afternoon after my Dr appointment to begin the drive back to VA.  My timing was great because I was able to stop in Black Mountain and watch Scout, my granddaughter, compete in a swim meet.  It was a perfect evening and start to my return trip to the trail!  Scout did awesome and loved being there to watch.  
I needed to be in Atkins, VA at 8 the next morning so I left Black Mountain early.  I'm driving to the home of the shuttle driver (Bunny) Pinto and I used to get to Charlotte, NC when we left the trail in May.  Bunny was very accommodating allowing me to park at her home, drive me to the Partnership Shelter and then pick me up wherever I stop my NOBO hike.  I pulled up to her home at 8:05 and by 8:10 we were on our way for the short drive to the Partnership Shelter/Mt Rogers Visitors Center and by 8:45 I was back on the trail!And wow!  This first day back had its twists and turns, from awesome to discouraging.  First, it was great being back on the trail and I started the day with a good pace with a planned distance of about 14 miles.  The ups and downs were gentle, the trail was beautiful and green and the views were inspiring!  I felt comfortable and at home.  After 7 miles I stopped at the Chatsfield Shelter for lunch and was able to meet Cheeks and Trouble along with their dog Precious. I'll bump into them several times over the next week and each time enjoyed visiting with them.  Even did a Wim Hof training for them.  The one difference on the trail this time vs in April and May was the temperature. It was only in the low 80's but definitely felt hot to me.  Coming from Texas I've always loved the heat but for now my body isn't used to long distance hiking in the heat.  I was going through plenty of water.  About 5 liters worth before the end of the day.  Fortunately, at least for now, water was easily available.  After leaving the shelter it was another 5 miles to the intersection with I-81 (where I got off to go to Bunny's house) and took another break at a gas station.  I should have bought more water here and filled my bottles but was only planning another 2 miles to where I was going to camp and according to Guthooks there was a water source available (though it said ""down a steep hill on an unmarked trail"").  I continued from the gas station and shortly came to where I planned to camp.  I was tired and hot and my water was low.  Unfortunately, I could not find the unmarked trail to the water so was faced with the decision to camp overnight with about 1/2 liter of water or continue on to the next campsite 4.5 miles away and hope water was available there.  I didn't mind not cooking and eating a cold dinner but was concerned with starting the morning with limited water after needing to drink some overnight.  So I decided to push on that afternoon.The downside is that this pushed my mileage for the day to close to 19 miles.  Further that I planned to go and combined with the heat and limited water I was uncomfortable. Plus I let myself get a little angry as well.  Not a great combination as that pushed me on at a faster pace than I would normally be at.  On top of that I was rationing myself 2 gulps of water every 1/2 mile.  All was going OK until I had another fall!  This time the trail was sloped upwards to the right and downwards to the left.  My left foot came down on the edge of the trail and there was no support under the earth I stepped on.  My left foot that continued downward through the trail.  My right foot was already moving forward so my body came down with all the weight on my left leg.  At this point my knee was out front of my foot so my full weight compressed my heels against my thigh.  Going down I remember thinking the ACL in my right knee was going to pop and was surprised when it didn't.  Think all my yoga child poses paid off!The rest of my body came down hard on the ground which caused me to roll to my right (thank goodness not to my left and down the hill) and I ended up lying on my pack with my body facing up.  Somehow I got two decent cuts on my right arm.  Now I was on my back with my pack under me, kind of like a turtle, and was unable to sit up with the weight of the pack.  So I had to unstrap the pack, get up off the trail, clean myself up and get my pack back on.  I cleaned the cuts as best I could with an alcohol wipe and water (there goes more water!).  Finally I was able to continue on.  After another 1.5 miles or so I finally came to the next campsite.  There were 3 others already set up and I was happy to hear them tell me that there was a flowing water source right there in camp!  Selected a site, took my gear off and went straight for the water.  I decided not to let this happen again and would carry extra water with me if necessary.  After filtering water into both bottles I drank my fill, refilled my bottle, filtered enough to cook my dinner with and then put another 2 liters in my water collection bag.  I was set for the night and would start tomorrow with plenty of water.  I wasn't as worried about tomorrow because there were at least two verified sources for water along the way.","Partnership Shelter
