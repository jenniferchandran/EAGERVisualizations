‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636548,"Like many other hikers this year, I am a refugee.  I had every intention of being part of the AT thru-hiker Class of 2020.  All the signs pointed to it.  “Class of Twenty-Twenty” had a nice, symmetrical ring that rolled off the tongue.  I would be celebrating a benchmark birthday, my 60th, on the trail.  I’m retired, so I had the time.  My health remained good enough to give me reasonable confidence of success.  I had the resources.  I had the blessing and support of an incredible spouse.  I was geared up, trained up, psyched up, and ready to launch.  And then &!#*%!!! COVID-19 hit.  Instead of graduating with the Class of 2020, I got held back a year.
Still, for me, 2020 was a success.  I survived the pandemic to hike another day.  Millions of people worldwide, including over half a million Americans, did not.  When you get right down to it, having my 2020 plans evaporate was trivial.  It’s a matter of perspective.  And my perspective is this:  I am genuinely grateful for the additional time afforded me on this earth.  I’m still retired.  I still have the resources.  My spouse is still willing to support my dream.  I already have the gear.  Yes, “Twenty-twenty one” doesn’t sound quite as cool, but so what?  Yes, I’m a year older, but I’m fully vaccinated and still in good health.  With apologies for a shameless derivative from the movie ""Dead Poets Society"", perhaps most importantly is my personal retirement credo of “carpe aetas”.  In my Jethro Bodine Latin, it translates to:  “seize the age”.  Whatever age you find yourself at, I believe you should embrace it, own it, make the most out of it. 
So, in a few weeks I am excited to start my attempt to become a graduate of the Appalachian Trail Class of 2021 thru-hiker.  Carpe aetas!",,View Entry,"May 07, Fri",0
‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637637,"There are three primary long distance hiking trails in the United States:  the Appalachian Trail, the Pacific Crest Trail, and the Continental Divide Trail.  Any of them represents a daunting task to thru-hike (the exalted few who complete all three trails are known as Triple Crowners).  Setting aside the questionable sanity of wishing to thru-hike any of these trails, why did I pick the AT over the others?  It’s a very wet trail compared to the others, hence the hiker adage, “No rain, no pain, no Maine”.  The PCT and CDT are known for their stunning scenery and sweeping vistas, whereas the AT, although still scenic and beautiful, is known as the “long, green tunnel”.  And, although it is the shortest of the three at 2,193 miles (the PCT is 2,669 miles and the CDT is 3,029 miles), most Triple Crowners consider the AT to be the most physically demanding because of the elevation gains/losses.  Perhaps surprisingly, at least it was to me when I learned this factoid, the AT is a significantly more vertical trail than the other two.  The AT averages 420 feet of elevation change per mile, while the PCT and CDT average 309 feet/mile and 303 feet/mile, respectively.  Considering all this, why would I want to hike the AT rather than the PCT or the CDT?

 

I grew up in East Tennessee, a short drive from the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.  My family has deep roots in Appalachia and as a boy, my grandfather kept me outdoors at every opportunity, instilling in me a reverence for the area – the flora, fauna, geology, topography, history.  He lacked formal education but was one of the smartest persons I’ve known.  He may not have known their Latin names, but he knew where to find paw-paws growing, or when persimmons were OK to eat, or that a grampus (a hellgrammite – the aquatic larvae of a Dobson fly) would catch a smallmouth bass faster than anything.  I joined the Scouts as soon as I was old enough and on one of our outings we hiked on a portion of the AT.  When I asked why it was called the Appalachian Trail and learned that it traversed the backbone of the Appalachian mountains and you could hike on it all the way from Georgia to Maine, I was mesmerized.  I can’t say that I instantly had the dream to hike the entire trail, but the seed took root.

 

Life happens and other priorities arose.  I got a degree, had a career, built a marriage.  I don’t mean this with any sort of resentment or negativity.  I enjoyed my career and found it rewarding and I wouldn’t trade my marriage for anything.  Each of us has a limited amount of time and are always having to choose priorities.  I knew the trail wasn’t going anywhere and, Providence willing, that opportunity would come along in good time.  In the meantime, I consumed books and magazine articles about the trail, pored over maps.  When the internet came along, an entire new set of resources about the trail opened up.  At some point I stumbled across trailjournals.com and started following thru-hikers vicariously in near real-time (thank you, Yogi, you were the first successful thru-hiker I followed, way back in 1999).  It got to the point where each year, just before “hiker season” started, I would pick a handful of prospective thru-hikers for that year, based on their initial journal entries, and then follow them on their trek.  I’d read their journals at lunch or after work.  I bought a long laminated map of the AT and put it up in my office.  I would take those skinny post-it stickies shaped like an arrow, write on them the trail name of the hikers I was following that year, and use them to track their progress.  Hey, some people draft a fantasy baseball team each year, I draft a fantasy thru-hiker team.  Don’t judge.  When Jennifer Pharr Davis, who in 2011 set the fastest known time for thru-hiking the AT, came through Fort Worth on a speaking tour for her book “Becoming Odyssa” not only did I get her to sign a copy of the book but she also graciously signed the map I followed thru-hikers on.  
So why did I choose the AT to thru-hike?  It’s simple, really.  For me, as a child of Appalachia, doing another trail first would seem a betrayal.  Dance with the one who brung you.  And now it’s my time.  The laminated AT map is no longer in my office.  Now it hangs on a wall at home and my wife has a sticky note with my name on it, ready to track my progress.  It’s a bit surreal.",,View Entry,"May 22, Sat",0
‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637638,"Sometimes when people learn I’m going to attempt a thru-hike, they ask what my plan is.  I’m always at a bit of a loss on a satisfactory reply.  I can tell they expect me to say where I’ll be on a certain day, what food I will eat, what date I will finish, how many miles I will hike each day, how much money I'll spend, what shelters I will stay at, and so on.  I think they’re expecting me to have a MS Project chart, complete with critical path and earned value analyses.  I have spent many, many hours of planning but, the truth is, my “plans” are very general and broad-brushed.  I think planning for a thru-hike is imperative but I don’t believe such an endeavor lends itself to detailed plans.  I think Dwight Eisenhower got it right when he said, “In preparing for battle, I have always found that plans are useless but planning is indispensable.”  Or, as Mike Tyson succinctly put it, “Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.”  Over the past couple decades I’ve read many books and followed countless journals of thru-hikers and a common thread is that the AT will indeed punch you in the mouth.  So, over the next few journal entries, I’ll present my plans, such as they are.  Here’s the first one.

 

Overall strategy.  I’m going to attempt what is known as a flip-flop hike.  Rather than starting at one end of the trail and hiking to the other end, I will start near the middle, in Harper’s Ferry, WV with a north vector to Mt. Katahdin in Maine.  I’ll catch a ride back to Harper’s Ferry where I’ll then hike a south vector to Springer Mountain in Georgia.  Although it’s a much less common approach to a thru-hike, there are a number of reasons I chose a flip-flop hike:

 

1.  The volume of thru-hiker traffic on the AT has grown dramatically in the past few decades, accelerated by Bill Bryson’s “A Walk In the Woods” and now by social media.  While this can be good – I firmly believe the more people who are aware of a resource and value it, the more advocates will arise to champion its protection – it can also certainly be bad.  We’re at the point where the AT is being loved to death.  The bubble of hikers who start out in Georgia each spring on a traditional northbound (NOBO) hike can easily overwhelm the local resources as they move north:  overcrowded shelters, overflowing privies, litter, norovirus outbreaks, trail erosion, and so on.  To manage this issue, the Appalachian Trail Conservancy has started requesting prospective thru-hikers to consider alternate itineraries, such as a southbound (SOBO) hike, or a flip-flop hike.  Currently, only a small fraction of hikers employ these itineraries so, although the total number of hikers may remain the same, having more hikers utilize alternate itineraries disperses them enough to not overwhelm the system (proving, once again, the environmental engineering maxim, “dilution is a solution to pollution” holds true).
 

2.  Because of the larger number of hikers in the NOBO bubble, the shelters and trail towns frequently take on a party atmosphere.  While this is fine and I’m looking forward to meeting people and making new friends on the trail, I’m at the age where I prioritize sleep over music, calm over chaos, sunrises over hangovers.  I realize that I’ve just offered up an “OK, Boomer” moment but, for me, a flip-flop hike offers a better mix of solitude and socializing.
 

3.  Winter conditions at the AT’s northern terminus from mid-October to early June force departure constraints on both NOBO and SOBO hikers.  NOBO hikers need to start in late winter or early spring in Georgia in order to make it to Katahdin by mid-October.  Conversely, SOBO hikers can’t start their hike until early June, meaning they’ll arrive in the south in late fall or early winter.  In either case, they’ll likely encounter significant cold weather in the south.  A flip-flop hiker can depart at a location and time which hopefully optimizes weather for their hike.  Aside from weather considerations, the scheduling flexibility of a flip-flop hike can also often accommodate personal timing constraints such as a wedding, a graduation, a surgery, starting a new job, and so on.
 


4.  I grew up in East Tennessee, not too far from the trail, so I have a solid network of family and friends in the southern Appalachians.  I really liked the idea of “hiking home” for the second half of my flip-flop; I think it’ll help with the mental motivation to keep hiking.
 

5.  Finally, a flip-flop hike was the most conducive for mitigating my COVID-19 concerns.  I wanted me and my wife to be fully vaccinated before I departed.  I didn’t want to fret about getting sick with the ‘Rona while on the trail, or being an asymptomatic COVID-Carl spreading it to others, and I didn’t want to stress about my wife catching it and me not being there to help her.  I wasn’t confident of getting a vaccination in time to support a NOBO hike but now we are both fully vaccinated and, as Forrest Gump says, “That’s good.  One less thing to worry about.”
 

So, when I considered the pro’s and con’s, my priorities and constraints…I’m happy to be a flip-flopper.",,View Entry,"May 22, Sat",0
‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637701,"A consensus opinion among experienced thru-hikers is to take it easy with respect to daily mileage and pace until your body has acclimated and you’ve gotten your trail legs.  One of the most common reasons people leave the trail early in their hike is pushing too hard too soon, resulting in overuse injuries, blisters, injuries from slips, trips, and falls, exhaustion, and overall misery.  Those bones, muscles, joints, and connective tissue have to get used to walking for 8 – 12 hours day, after day, after day, up and down hills, with uneven footing, all while carrying an additional 30 lbs on your back.  Most previous hikers say it takes anywhere from 2 – 4 weeks to get your trail legs, depending on age and prior conditioning.  Considering all this, my plan is to average no more than 8 miles per hiking day the first week, no more than 10 miles per day the second week, and no more than 12 miles per day the third week.  After that, I believe I’ll have my trail legs and be attuned to my body’s limitations and ready to take on more serious mileage.  Additionally, for the first month or so, I plan to take at least one zero or nero each week for rest and recovery.  (A “zero” is a rest day, i.e. a day with zero trail miles hiked.  A “nero” is a “nearly zero” mileage day, for example, only hiking a couple miles to a road crossing to catch a ride into town).  In summary, my acclimation plan is to start low, go slow.  Deliberately low mileage days and relaxed pace for the first month; listen to my body after that.",,View Entry,"May 23, Sun",0
‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637702,"Many hikers abandon their quest due to collapse of morale.  When it’s been raining for three straight days, it’s 35 degrees, every inch of you is wet, stinky, cold, dirty, hungry, achy, lonely, and tired, it’s impossible not to let thoughts creep into your head along the lines of, “I could be at home.  Warm, dry, fresh out of the shower.  Sitting in a recliner with my feet propped up, eating a pizza, and watching movies on HBO.  What the hell am I doing here?” Then to wake up the next morning, put on socks that have literally frozen solid, and do it all again, certainly becomes a grind at some point.  The excitement wears off.  The sense of adventure wanes.  The miniscule progress of each day’s mileage when measured against the magnitude of the entire trail starts becoming a daunting, Sisyphus-like task.  The hike morphs into a chore rather than a dream.  
 

How do people prevent morale from eroding to the point of calling it quits?  Since this issue resides between the ears, each hiker will have their own thresholds and their own coping mechanisms.  During my daily training hikes I’ve done a fair amount of self-reflection and introspection on this particular challenge to a thru-hike.  I think the key to overcoming the motivation challenge is to truly know yourself.  One of my personality traits is that I’m comfortable being in my own head for extended periods of time.  That can be either good or bad, depending on whether I dwell on my misery and grievances, or whether I can redirect my thoughts in a positive direction.  So, my plan to sustain motivation centers on what I call “LSHOOT”.  That’s the acronym (pronounced el-shoot) for a term I came up with:  “Live the Sh*! Out Of Today!”.  Be mindful.  Stay in the present.  Live in the moment.  And maximize the experience by employing all my senses to examine and be aware of what’s unfolding in my immediate universe.  Every single thing is, in some way, a miracle.  If I can keep my mind attuned to paying attention to that, I think I can quell the whiney voice that’s telling me to stop, to disengage, to leave the trail.  It probably sounds like some new age, post-hippie BS, but I think that’s the key to my motivation plan.  Each day, no matter what, try to LSHOOT.",,View Entry,"May 23, Sun",0
‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637811,"It’s reasonable to expect gear and kit to last most, if not all, of a thru-hike.  You may have to replace footwear a couple times, or acquire a lighter sleeping bag when warm weather arrives but, overall, gear should last the duration.  But what about the consumables?  The food I eat, the fuel I’ll cook with?  Obviously, I can’t pack and carry an entire 6 months’ worth of food on my back.  And, on today’s AT, I can’t emulate the long hunters of the 1700’s, foraging for food along the way and killing a buffalo or elk every week or so.  Given those constraints, how will I resupply along the way?

Some hikers plan and prepare extensive mail drops ahead of time, having friends or family members periodically mail packages to predetermined points on the trail, intercepting the hiker with resupplies along his or her way.  While I would certainly be delighted to receive a care package of homemade cookies or other goodies (hint, hint), I don’t think that approach is advantageous as a primary resupply mechanism.  First, any money I might save by purchasing in bulk or on sale at home and then repackaging the stockpile into a series of mail drops will quickly be offset by shipping costs.  Second, I have no idea what the rigors of the trail will do to my palate and appetite.  What at home may seem like 3 days worth of food may, once the hiker hunger sets in, seem like a single hors d’oeurve on the trail.  And, although at home you may hold the opinion that oats are the tastiest, most versatile breakfast food the Quakers ever invented, after having oatmeal for breakfast every day for a month on the trail, you may start thinking the Quakers were a secret culinary sadism society.  Third, by using mail drops, you’re constrained to the vagaries of the USPS or businesses receiving/holding the package for you.  If you’re planning to pick up a mail drop at the post office in Snake Navel, PA but you don’t get into town until 5:30 p.m. on Friday, you may be stuck in Snake Navel until the post office opens for business on Monday morning.  Many hikers report that the schedule constraints and coordination needed for mail drops is a pain.  Fourth, I don’t want to burden Janet, or anyone else, with having to regularly ship resupply packages to me.  I’m sure she would be happy to do it but I’m already leaving her with the responsibilities and chores for the entire household while I’m hiking.  Her do-list is going to be long enough as it is; I want to avoid adding to it, if possible.
Fortunately, unlike the Pacific Crest Trail and the Continental Divide Trail, where mail drops are an important component of a hiker’s resupply strategy, the Appalachian Trail is characterized by frequent road crossings and nearby towns.  From the road crossings, a hiker can readily walk or catch a ride into town and resupply at the ubiquitous Dollar stores, Walmart, Kroger, Pilot gas station, etc.  With the exception of the 100-mile Wilderness in Maine, seldom is it necessary to carry more than a few days of food before a resupply opportunity is available.
Since I don’t have any specialized health or diet requirements that can’t be satisfied, at least for a few days, within the aisles of a reasonably well stocked 7-11, my plan is to simply resupply on the trail as I go along.  I only have to think as far ahead as the next resupply opportunity.  I don’t have to be at a certain place and certain time to pick up a mail drop.  I can select whatever appeals to my palate and appetite at the time.  And I don’t have to burden someone back home with an extra chore.
But getting a package of homemade cookies still sounds pretty dang good.  I’m not picky.  Chocolate chip.  Oatmeal raisin.  Gingerbread.  Sugar.  Snickerdoodle.  Just sayin’.
So, there they are.  My “Plans”.  No pages and pages of Excel spreadsheets.  Just a handful of overarching concepts that are hopefully researched and reasoned enough to provide a viable framework, but with the flexibility to help me persevere when the AT punches me in the mouth.",,View Entry,"May 24, Mon",0
‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637835,"Our house was built in 1964 and we purchased it in 1996.  Since then we have completely remodeled it.  Every single room.  Down to the studs and electrical wiring.  We didn’t do it all at once.  We’d tackle a section of the house, then save up for a few years and remodel another section.  Save up and do another section.  Maybe the master bathroom one year.  Then a couple years later, the guest bedrooms.  Then a few years after that, the kitchen.  Until finally, a couple years ago, the last remaining area, the great room, was done.  The culmination of a couple decades of work and the entire house was exactly how we wanted it.  We celebrated.  We high-fived.  We drank.  We built a fire in the new fireplace and danced around like Druid pagans.

This year, I feel I’ve completely remodeled once again but in a completely opposite direction.  I hope I love what I’ve done to the place, I’ll let you know in about 6 months or so.  Here’s a summary of this year’s radical remodel:
Roof, walls, flooring –
My shelter from the elements is a combination living room and bedroom consisting of a 19 oz. Z-Packs Duplex tent, affording me a palatial 28 square feet of living space with an open floor plan and dual entryways.  Take that, tiny homes!
Kitchen –
The entirety of my kitchen is comprised of:  a BRS stove that weighs less than 1 ounce and folds up to about the size of my thumb; a 4-oz propane fuel canister; a 750 mL titanium cup, a long-handled spoon; a mini-Bic lighter for the stove; a Katadyn BeFree water filter with bladder; and the entire kitchen fits into an insulated pot cozy I made out of Reflectix (the cozy is sorta like a crockpot – it’s for keeping my food hot while it’s rehydrating).  My pantry is a Z-Packs bear bag that will hold about 5 days worth of food.  I’ll have to hang it in a tree most nights to keep critters – bears, mice, raccoons, yetis, other hikers, etc – from raiding it.
Bathroom –
Most of the shelters have a nearby privy or, as I knew them growing up, an outhouse.  But for those times when nature calls and you’re even further out in nature than an AT shelter privy, the bathroom is pretty much the entirety of the great outdoors.  That sounds a little disgusting, and it can be if care isn’t taken to make sure the bathroom is at least 200 ft from water sources, the trail, shelters, and camping areas.  Within that constraint, my new bathroom appointments consist of a small, titanium trowel for digging a cat hole; a CuloClean travel bidet, a bandana for taking a daily airplane bath (you know, a swipe under both wings and the tail); a tube of travel size toothpaste; a complimentary-visit-to-the-dentist size roll of dental floss; a travel toothbrush; and a small, custom-assembled first aid kit as my medicine cabinet. 
Bedroom –
As I mentioned, the bedroom is actually my tent, so I guess this more aptly describes the bedroom furnishings.  The mattress is an inflatable Thermarest NeoAir XLite sleeping pad.  Linens are an REI Magma 30 sleeping bag (I may get a heftier bag towards the end of my hike when cold weather sets in); a Sea-to-Summit Thermolite Reactor sleeping bag liner (to add a few degrees of warmth in cooler weather, or to sleep in by itself in hot weather, and mainly to help keep the sleeping bag a smidgen cleaner); and a Sea-to-Summit inflatable pillow.  For safety’s sake, it’s important to keep your sleep system dry, so while hiking I’ll be storing my bed linens in a 20-liter dry bag stuff sack.
Closet –
Besides the clothes I’ll be wearing each day to hike in, my master closet will contain an extra pair of Darn Tough socks, sleep clothes that can also serve as hiking clothes should my hiking clothes get ripped or torn beyond repair (a pair of running shorts and an Icebreaker merino wool t-shirt), a Patagonia puffy jacket for cool evenings around camp, a Z-Packs Vertice rain jacket and rain kilt, a pair of lightweight mesh water shoes that I’ll use as camp shoes or for creek crossings.
Combination Master Closet, Garage, and Vehicle –
The U-Haul van I’ll be using to store and carry all my relics and sundries around in is an Osprey 58 liter Exos backpack.  It’s really not a U-Haul, though.  It’s a Me-Haul.  I'll probably wish it was an AnyoneElse-Haul before too long.
I have a few other sundries that don’t quite fit my remodel analogy (trekking poles, for example) but really that’s pretty much the extent of my kit.  That'll be my new remodel look for quite awhile.  It's certainly a difference perspective on curb appeal.",,View Entry,"May 25, Tue",0
‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637924,"A surprising number of thru-hikers carry some sort of talisman with them on their journey.  It might be a small stuffed animal or toy, such as a Baby Yoda or Gumby, a collar from a pet, ashes of a loved one, a sentimental necklace or bracelet, a voodoo doll of an ex-spouse, and so on.  The reasons people decide to carry a talisman on an endeavor where ounces and grams are meticulously counted and pared back are as varied as the talismans themselves.  It might be whimsical, or a conversation starter, or for a charity or cause, or a memorial gesture, or simply for good luck.

I too have chosen to carry a talisman on my trek.  This picture is of a seed from an American Chestnut tree.  It was provided to me by the American Chestnut Foundation.  Full disclosure – I am a member of the ACF but I’m not sponsored by them and I’m not any sort of official representative or spokesperson for them.  I simply thought it would be symbolic (and kinda cool) to carry an American Chestnut seed the length of the Appalachian Trail.
A hundred years ago, and for countless millennia before that, the American Chestnut was the dominant tree species in the Appalachian hardwood forest.  It is estimated that 1 out of every 4 canopy trees was an American Chestnut tree.  Its range extended from Georgia into Maine.  The chestnut was native to every state the AT passes through and if you look at a range map for the species, you quickly realize the trail passes directly through the heart of its original range.  Other than the mountains themselves, there are few things that have deeper roots in Appalachia, both figuratively and literally, than the American Chestnut tree.  It was a huge, majestic tree, prized for its strong, rot-resistant, and straight-grained lumber.  The nuts were a staple for a multitude of wildlife species and humans.  It was so plentiful that in the spring, when the trees were covered in their delicate white flowers, it looked like a dusting of snow covered the mountainsides.
In the early 1900s, however, a fungus not native to the Americas found its way to this continent and began infecting the American Chestnut trees.  By the middle of the century, they were all gone, rendered functionally extinct by the chestnut blight.  The species isn’t completely extinct because the fungus doesn’t kill off the root system and sprouts can continue to emerge from the stumps of hardier specimens, but will eventually become infected and die back to the ground.  In fact, the first chestnut tree I ever laid eyes on was just such a sprout. 
In the early 1980s, my grandparents and I took an old, rutted out jeep road deep into Cumberland Gap National Historical Park to a remote area of the park called Hensley Settlement.  On the way, we stopped for a picnic lunch my grandmother had prepared (Fried chicken; green beans, tomatoes, and corn fresh from the garden; cornbread; and my grandmother’s fried apple pies.  I remember this not because my memory is that sharp and crisp, but because that’s what we always had when I went on a “jaint” with my grandparents, which was often, and because, if I live to be as old as Methuselah, I am quite certain it will remain the best food I will ever put in my mouth).  My grandfather noticed something off the trail a little ways and told me to follow him.  We stopped and he said, “This is a chestnut tree.”  It was maybe 20-feet tall, covered in elongated, saw-toothed leaves, and was suckering out from a humongous dead stump.  I was spellbound, feeling like I was given a special gift by my grandfather – a glimpse of arboreal majesty from an earlier age.  I will never forget it.
The American Chestnut Foundation’s mission is to bring back the American Chestnut.  When you think about it, that’s a bold and lofty goal.  Not just to save or preserve the species, but to restore an entire ecosystem that was lost.  And, by bringing a number of technologies to bear, they have made remarkable progress, selectively breeding the most blight-resistant trees, and believe they will soon have viable trees that are both blight resistant and capable of passing the resistance down through their progeny.  I won’t live long enough to see chestnuts once again dominate the forest canopy but I get great satisfaction thinking that’s an attainable goal and helping in some miniscule way to make it happen.
I think I’ll name the chestnut seed I’ll be carting with me on the AT “Groot”.  Or maybe my trail name should be Groot and he can be Little Groot.  Or Baby Groot.  Or, to be more technically correct, Seed Groot.  In any event, I hope we both make the entire journey and represent our respective species well.",,View Entry,"May 26, Wed",0
‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638282,"We are fortunate enough to have a little bit of acreage with our home and for my wife’s birthday this year, I built her a nature trail on it.  It’s got a little bit of elevation gain, passes through some wooded areas and through some tallgrass prairie.  It’s only 0.8-mile round trip but it makes for a nice, relaxing walk.
So you’re probably wondering, “What in Sam Hill does this have to do with the AT?”  Well, I can tell you from personal experience, building and maintaining a trail, even a paltry 0.8-mile trail on private property, is a helluva lot of work.  It boggles my mind to think about what it took and continues to take to build and maintain a 2,193-mile public trail, complete with shelters, footbridges, signs, privies, blazes, etc, while having to coordinate and accommodate 14 states, 8 national forests, 6 units of the National Park Service, and 3,000,000 visitors annually.  What a monumental task!
Based on a typical person’s stride, it takes over 5,000,000 steps to thru-hike the AT.  A misstep on any one of those can result in a hike ending injury.  Additionally, any number of other things can prematurely terminate a thru-hike:  Lyme disease, norovirus, infected blisters or wounds, overuse injuries, running out of money, a family emergency, loneliness, weather, and the common worries (but in reality, very rare) of snakebite, bears, deadfall trees, lightning, etc.  It’s almost as if the entropy of the universe works to thwart a thru-hiker’s ambitions.
But for each of those nefarious mechanisms attempting to trip up a thru-hiker, I like to think of:  the visionaries who conceived the trail; the elected officials and philanthropists who made it happen; the pioneers who demonstrated a thru-hike was possible; the hiking clubs and volunteers who maintain sections of the trail; the ATC who manages the overall trail mission; the ridge runners and rangers who help keep the trail safe; the trail angels who grace hikers with trail magic; the trail towns who support the hikers as they pass through; the hostel owners, shuttle drivers, restauranteurs, and outfitters; and family and friends of hikers back home.  I take comfort in the fact that each and every one of these people, past and present, want me to succeed and they are a counterbalance to the negative elements that will try to force me off the trail.
For all these wonderful people who have helped make the trail and the trail experience happen, please know that you are appreciated.
We who are about to hike, salute you.",,View Entry,"May 31, Mon",0
‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638496,"I had planned to stop in at the ATC office, weigh my pack, get a photo, and pick up my thru-hiker tag. Naturally, they’re closed on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Silly of me to think otherwise. So, we proceeded onward and Janet dropped me off at the trailhead just as it crosses the river. Yep, I misted up. Gonna miss her something fierce. 


Met a couple on the C&O Canal riding bikes. They stopped and chatted. Come to find out they section hiked the trail over a 13 year period, finishing in 2013.  Got my contact info and said they’d follow my journal. Beautiful shelter, a double decker. Getting water sucked though - 0.4 miles down a steep trail to the water source.  But I’m here enjoying the solitude with only a couple other hikers and about 17 billion cicadas, all clamoring for sex at the top of their tiny lungs. The cicadas are out in force. A trail maintainer who showed up at the shelter said bears are even eating them, digging the emerging larvae out of the ground. I actually like them, think they’re kinda cool. My grandparents called them jarflies.  But I’m now of the opinion that “cicada” is an old Native American word that means “God’s tinnitus”. 


Only met two other hikers who started a flip flop today from HF:  Mattie, a young woman from California, and Jane, a recent college grad from Maryland.  Met three guys, Maui, Kenai, and Sneezle who started at Springer on March 1. They just stopped for a break and are pushing on. Also met a very nice day hiker, Nick Ardmore, who stopped for a break. He asked a ton of questions and I gave him my contact info. He said he’d follow my journal. He’s 67 but looks very fit and seemed more than just casually interested in maybe doing the trail someday.I didn’t have to hang my food; there’s a nice bear pole installed.  Somebody said most of the shelters in MD have them.  That’ll be nice, it makes it easy to protect your food.Day 1 is in the books.  It’s a daunting task, but you’ve gotta start somewhere.","Harper’s Ferry, WV

‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638515,"I feel it today much more than yesterday. Sleep was OK; the pad and bag were very comfortable but my hips kept waking me up. They were aching and I’d have to flip onto the other side for awhile then an hour or so later, that hip would ache and wake me and I’d have to flip again. Rotisserie sleeping. 


I packed up and left camp early, deciding to stop for breakfast about 3 miles down trail at the Gathland State Park. There’s a beautiful War Correspondents monument that I ate breakfast in front of. I pondered the importance and risk of their work while I sat on a bench, watched cicadas molt on the bench beside me, and chewed on my smushed bagel. Of more immediate concern to me personally, there was good running water there from a faucet outside the restrooms. The restrooms were open so I availed myself of the facilities, including an airplane bath and brushing my teeth. 


Stopped for lunch at White Rocks overlook. It was a really nice view and I chatted with a dayhiker there. 


The last few miles into Rocky Run shelter were a bit tough. I was tired. Nice shelter, again. Think I’m going to sleep in the shelter for the first time because thunderstorms are expected tonight. Sharing the shelter with T-Heart, Mosetta, and Skipper (a neuro-psychologist - he said we’re all crazy). The Gone With the Wind couple, Rhett and Scarlett, are tenting. They’re all NOBO’s from Springer. Maurice, a NOBO, stopped at the shelter for a quick rest but decided to push on a couple more miles to a campground with a nearby restaurant. I was tempted, but I’m trying to follow my acclimation plan of averaging no more than 8 miles per day this week.So far I’m the oldest thru-hiker I’ve met (until Rhett rolled in, I think he may be a bit older than me but not sure). I’m sure there are others, I just haven’t run into them yet. It’s interesting to see how the young guys interact with me. They call me “Sir” a lot. When they’re talking to their contemporaries, it’s like, “Dude, I’ve got killer chafing on my ball sack.”  But with me, they’re more like, “One thing to watch out for, sir, is skin irritation in those tender areas before it gets really bad.”  It’s pretty funny and I wonder if it’ll change as they get to know me more and as I develop more trail cred as a thru-hiker.","Ed Garvey shelter

‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638516,"I had a hot shower at a backpacker campground a couple miles in today. It was glorious. I also had cell reception so I called Janet to check in. Per usual, as soon as I left home, something went belly up. This time it was a relay and pressure tank on the water well. Janet was as resourceful as ever and got it squared away, though. Most of my worries about the hike have centered on things breaking or needing tending to at home and I’m not there to tackle them. Don’t know why I should worry, though. Janet’s smarter than I am. 


Passed South Mountain battlefield. Took a quick break and climbed to the top of the original Washington Monument, not that upstart poser monument located on the Washington D.C. mall. This one was built in 1827 by the citizens of Washington County, MD. 


I crossed over the I-70 footbridge as traffic zoomed by below me. Wow, what a contrast. They’re traveling at miles per minute speeds; I’m traveling at miles per day velocities. 


Arrived at Annapolis Rocks backpacker campground (alas, no hot shower or facilities at this one), quickly set up camp and cooked dinner because I could hear thunder in the distance approaching. Sure enough, it started sprinkling while I was eating but held off long enough for me to finish and hang my food. I retreated to the tent and, boom, it started raining like a cow peeing on a flat rock. 


Didn’t see many people today other than folks I played leapfrog with from last night. I did meet an Aussie and his daughter out for a a quick stroll on the AT. He asked some questions and told me to keep up the good work. I also came across a trail maintainer laboring away with a mattock and shovel to put some erosion control  logs in place to divert rainwater runoff away from the trail. Those people are heroes. I said hi and told her I appreciated her hard work. What was interesting was that she asked, “Are you flip-flopping from Harpers Ferry?”  Evidently she has been around hikers enough to recognize that I had the gear of a thru-hiker but didn’t yet sport the patina of a hiker who started in Georgia - the scratches, scrapes, bug bites, ripped clothes, ragged shoes, and general trail grime. I’m getting there, though.","Rocky Run shelter

‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638965,"If today was going to be a horror movie,  it would be called “The Cicadaville Horror”. 


It poured rain last night.  My tent has a small, elastic cord with a clip lock to adjust the tension on the tent’s bathtub floor to raise it higher and help keep rain out. So I cinched it up good and tight for the night’s storms. In the morning I opened my eyes and could see the blurry outline of several cicadas that had emerged during the night and had crawled up on the outside wall of my tent. I thought, “Well I’d better be sure to shake those guys off before I roll the tent up this morning, because...gross.”  I was still half asleep, thinking about the cicadas crawling around on the tent, rolled over, and that little tensioner string brushed across my face. I squealed and nearly privied myself. 


Later that morning, a couple miles into the day’s hike, unbeknownst to me a cicada had landed on my cap. I have no idea how it got there or how long it had hitchhiked. It crawled down the cap to just above my left ear and suddenly cranked up its weird, vibrating, alien-sounding Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr noise. My left hand involuntarily jerked up to my ear to fling the creature off me. Of course, a trekking pole was looped around my wrist, so it came flying up along with my hand and the butt of the trekking pole handle whacked me in the chin, then came off my wrist and clattered off into the weeds. Sheesh. 



The Chinese have the Chinese zodiac: the Year of the Monkey, the Year of the Ox, the Year of the Tiger, and so on. I think the ATC should do something similar and this would be the thru-hiker Year of the Cicada. Or maybe the hiker Class of 2021 should be known as Brood XXI.
It was a long day and I needed to go into town for resupply. I was dreading the walk into town because the scoop on the trail was that there was no shoulder, a lot of fast traffic, and a dangerous, long road walk.  I emerged from the woods at the road crossing and there was a woman standing there. Come to find out, she and her sister are section hiking the trail as a series of day hikes with her sister. They hike once a week and she was out scouting the parking areas for their next hike. Her trail name is Big Sister and she offered me a ride into town!  Not only that but I had decided to get a room in town to dry out my gear, resupply, and do laundry, so she took me to Applebee’s next to the hotel I was going to stay at and we had lunch together. And not only that, but she offered to shuttle me back to the trail head in the morning (coming out of her way all the way from Gettysburg, PA). My first trail angel!


Big Sister asked about my hike so far and I told her of my cicada tribulations. She got an inspirational look on her face and said, “By the powers vested in me as an AT section hiker by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, I bequeath you the trail name “‘Cada”.  OK, I embellished the bit about “By the powers...” but she did appoint my trail name. Actually she was going with “TexCada” but I’ve always considered myself a Tennessean rather than a Texan (been in Texas for 37 years and those dang Texans still won’t give me a green card). So I shortened it to just ‘Cada. I like it. It’s short and even puts a time stamp on my hike. “I thru hiked the AT in the Year of the Cicada”.  Of course, it could also be my trail name because they think I’m bug-eyed and make a lot of annoying noise. You never know with these hikers.

Hiked through a field of freshly cut hay and the smell was wonderful. It stayed with me for a long time. 


Ran into a NOBO while I was eating lunch at a creek. His name was Camo and he stopped to collect and filter water. He gave me some good advice on being ruthless about paring weight down. I think I am going to send a couple things home. 


Short miles today but the hike down to get water at the shelter made up for it.  Nice shelter again but I’ve got the best tent spot I’ve had so far. Saw a huge black snake on the trail to the shelter and a little while later he came through the shelter area. There were several shelter log entries about him, so I think he must be the resident shelter snake. The bright side...no mice. 


Two other flip-floppers are here tonight, Jude and Kathy. Kathy has a black lab who carries his own pack. He seems a bit wary and barks rather aggressively anytime someone walks by, hangs their food bag, goes to pee, or whatever. There are quite a few people here tonight, mostly weekenders, and I think they’re a bit annoyed by the dog. Heck, I’m a bit annoyed by it and I love dogs. 


When I went to get water, down the very steep and long side trail, I got water for Kathy, too. It was a haul. Got barked at and bluff charged by her dog by way of thanks. 


At a road crossing, two young guys were getting out of their car as I was passing by and one of them asked, “Sir, is this trail 8 kilometers round trip or 8 kilometers one way?”  I said, “I’m not sure I understand the question. What’s your destination?”  He looked at me like I was a moron for several seconds, so I said, “This trail goes all the way to Maine and I’m pretty certain Maine is more than 8 kilometers.”  I’m not sure they ever believed I was being straight with them.","Wolfsville Road crossing

‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638979,"Stopped for breakfast (peanut butter on a tortilla and some butter rum lifesavers) at Pen-Mar Park. Sat in a bench swing with a beautiful view while I ate. Brushed my teeth and cleaned up a bit in the park facilities. Jude rolled in but I headed out soon afterward. 


Shortly after leaving the park, I had my first fall. The trail crosses some railroad tracks and on the far side the embankment was steep and covered with the railroad gravel. I started down and the gravel rolled out from under my feet and, since it was gravel, my trekking poles didn’t have a good purchase to save me. So down on my butt I went. 


Just a few steps from my tumble I crossed the Mason - Dixon line. I guess my fall was the south kicking me in the butt since I was headed up to yankee land. But, yay!, I’m in PA and made it through MD. One state is in the books. While I was taking a pic of the Mason - Dixon sign, two section hikers walked up and offered to take my pic at the sign if I’d answer some questions about hiking kilts. They were genuinely interested and had done some research. I think after talking to me they may get one to continue their section hikes in. Had no idea I was going to become a kilt ambassador. 


I had planned to stop for the night at Deer Lick shelter but a guy at Pen-Mar park had recommended continuing on to Tumbling Run shelter. I was reluctant to add the extra miles but was feeling pretty good when I got to Deer Lick. So I just filtered some water and headed on to Tumbling Run. I’m glad I did!  This shelter has separate shelters for “Snorers” and “Non Snorers”. It’s really nice. Heck there are even flowers on the table and toilet paper and hand sanitizer in the privy. 


I met Velcro, a young woman fresh out of the Air Force, at the shelter and chatted with her over dinner.

‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639152,"I’ve got to get my morning routine more efficient. The serious thru-hikers can take down camp, organize their gear, get their daily food lined up, and be trail ready in a very short amount of time. And from watching them, I can tell that each one has a regimented process such that they know the exact sequence of tasks and exactly how each item gets packed away. And most of them can do it almost silently and in near darkness, departing the shelter at first light with hardly a sound. I’m still like a bull in a China shop. 


Up till now, I’ve been familiar with all the flora and fauna. I’ve seen one lizard I didn’t recognize down by the C&O Canal but otherwise the woods have been populated with things I recognize from growing up in Tennessee. On the hike today, though, I came across a flower I’ve never seen before. There was a small section of woods that had several dozen Lilly-looking plants with a beautiful white flower on a long stalk. I took a pic to try and identify it later.


Although still very much in the eastern hardwood forest, there was one short section today that went by a small stand of fir trees and the smell was delightful. I picked up a few needles on the ground, crushed them, and rubbed it on my pack strap to try and keep the smell with me. It worked for a couple miles but the sweat eventually won the odor war. 


I played leapfrog with Velcro throughout the morning. She’s far faster than me but she’s taking her time and waiting on some friends to catch up. 


Today’s hike went through a boulder maze. How are these thru-hikers who started at Springer so fast and nimble?  One passed me in the middle of the boulder maze, springing from the top of one boulder to the next and was quickly out of sight. I, on the other hand, went carefully and slowly plodding along, evaluating each foot placement and testing the surety of my trekking poles before I committed to each step. It’s impressive watching them. Maybe I’ll get to that point but till then I resist pushing the envelope too much and console myself with the thought that most of them have about 30 years or more advantage on me. 


I planned to stay the night at a hostel in Fayetteville, PA, the Trail of Hope hostel.  I got to the road crossing leading into Fayetteville and had a 0.8-mile road walk to the hostel. Fortunately there was a wide shoulder but, dang, the cars were flying by. 



The road walk took me past a fresh roadkill skunk that I literally had to step over. Ya know, when you’re in a car and pass by a dead polecat, you wrinkle your nose and the smell dissipates in a couple minutes. When you’re walking and have to pass right by one, you smell it for 15 minutes before you get to it and for 30 minutes after you pass it ‘cause that smell gets in your nose and there’s no 60 mph wind stream to purge it out of your sinuses. Ack!
At the hostel I met Jillygoat, an algebra teacher who has been section hiking the trail sequentially, I.e. starting at Springer and hiking north, picking up each time where she left off the previous year, for the past 5 years during part of her summer breaks. She was a treasure to meet and we hit it off well. I’ll probably only see her for a short while because she’s on a deadline and already doing big miles. I actually met her yesterday when I stopped to filter water. She walked up a few minutes later and said, “There’s a smart man to wear a kilt.”  She was staying at that shelter and I was pressing on, so we didn’t chat or swap names. 


I also met Insight and Care Bear but they’re staying in another building of the hostel. 


I was starving when I got to the hostel. Pastor Bob (the church’s preacher, that’s not a trail name) was giving Velcro a lift to the Dollar General to resupply, so he dropped me off at Flamingo, a local eatery, where I had a salad and a huge plate of spaghetti and meatballs. The waitress asked me several questions and didn’t know about the trail. A surprising number of people don’t, even when it passes right through their community  
The pastor and staff cooked supper for the hikers, which was an unexpected surprise. The guidebook said they do a hiker supper on Wednesday, but here’s one on Monday. He just popped in and said, “Dinner’s at 5.” If I had known that, I wouldn’t have defiled myself with that monstrous plate of spaghetti. We had crockpot chicken, baked beans, green beans, and homegrown white peaches!  It was great. 


Apparently on Monday evenings the church lets the local Hispanic community hold service in Spanish. The hostel is attached to the back of the church, sharing a common wall. When I woke up this morning, I had no earthly idea I’d be laying in a bunk bed in my hiker sleep clothes, listening to live Spanish gospel music this evening.","Tumbling Run shelter

‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639153,"Odd guy at hostel last night. He was getting a ride back to Harper’s Ferry this morning. He seemed a bit disconnected from society and reality. His story was all over the place but I think he had been on trail but was getting off to go home.  


Jillygoat and I got up, packed, and then got a shuttle to the trailhead from Junkers.   I was very grateful because I was dreading the road walk back to the trail. 


Hiked past Quarry Run shelter and it was incredible. Even better than Tumbling Run.  Hanging flower pots, deodorizer in the privy, thermometer, little forest gnome village set up. Wow. 


I played leapfrog with Jillygoat all morning and finally said goodbye to her at a PATC cabin. She was already there taking a break when I arrived. I had a snack break and she moved on. I’m stopping at the next shelter but she’s pushing on. I likely won’t see her again. She was fun to talk to. Insight and Care Bear arrived a few minutes later. Someone had left a huge pack (105 liters!) beside the trail. Nobody could figure out who it belonged to or where they were. Finally a guy came up who said he knew who it belonged to and everything was fine. 


Had breakfast at a great, picturesque little camping spot...except for the a-holes who left an entire garbage bag full of trash in the fire ring. Why do some people always expect other people to clean up after them?


Walking through the Michaux State Forest and I started seeing some fresh, green leaf litter on the ground that had obviously been chewed on by some type insect. It continued to get worse and I spotted the culprit - some sort of caterpillar. The further I walked the worse it got until soon, the trail was covered with pieces of fresh green leaf cuttings, the cuttings were falling onto me, almost sounding like a light rain, and when I would take my pack off for a break or to filter water, there would be 5 or 6 caterpillars crawling on it that I’d have to brush off before I shouldered the pack. It almost seemed like something out of a Tolkien book. I don’t know what kind of caterpillars they are. Someone suggested tent caterpillars, but I’m certain they’re not. Maybe gypsy moths?  If I see a ranger or ridge runner I’m going to ask them. 


Made my miles early but resisted the urge to push to the next shelter. Trying to stick with my acclimation plan. Met Legs at the shelter and he gave me some good advice about stretching. He is thru-hiking NOBO. His father, Old Legs, and another friend are hiking with him for a few days. Unfiltered and Tide Pod are another father son duo staying at the shelter. Unfiltered is thru hiking from Springer and Tide Pod is hiking with him for a week. Unfiltered caught a bad case of giardia back in VA, hence the trail name. 


Supposed to rain tonight but still going to tent. Several people rolled in late and set up tents almost on top of other tenters who were there first. One of the other thru-hikers actually moved his tent even though he was there first. It’s a group of young guys section hiking for a few days. They seem like a rowdy crowd, unaware of or uncaring of camping etiquette. They’re far enough away from me that I don’t think it’ll bother me but I feel sorry for the guys in the shelter and tenting around them.","US 30 road crossing

‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639155,"Rained last night, some thunder and lightning but mostly just a drizzle. I woke up to a pileated woodpecker drumming on a nearby tree.  It was early, just barely light enough to see, but I didn’t mind. I love that sound. Heck, I think that would make a great alarm clock sound. Or maybe I should somehow get that sound as the ringtone on my phone. 


After I woke up I noticed a spoonful of water had pooled in a low spot in the tent. I think it may have been from condensation because it was so humid and I had the tent buttoned up tight because of the rain. I’ll need to be mindful of it, though. 


Got my earliest start so far and made good time. They say 10 by 12 (ten miles done by twelve o’clock) is a good rule of thumb for successful pace for the trail and I got right at 10 miles done by 11:30, so I was pretty happy. 



The hike went through several large areas where I believe they may have done controlled burns a few years ago. The canopy has been thinned quite a bit, a lot of standing dead trees, and the underbrush is growing like crazy. Seems like too many standing trees remaining for it to have been logged, so my guess is controlled burns. However, I managed to confirm that the caterpillars I’ve been seeing are, in fact, gypsy moths so I guess these canopy-barren areas could even be sections that the moths have denuded in the past few years. I tell ya, it almost might be worth a trip down to Mexico to get a few railroad tanker cars of some of those banned pesticides and nuke those gypsy moth suckers. And that’s from a guy who considers himself an environmentalist. It’s incredible how they’re stripping some places bare.
I encountered my first culinary trail magic: a cooler of Pepsi’s and apples left by trailhead at a road crossing. I’m not big on soft drinks, I bet I haven’t had more than a half dozen in the past 20 years, but those Pepsi’s were pretty dang marvelous. I said a quiet thanks to the kind soul(s) who left them and moved on. 


I passed a sign denoting the official halfway point of the AT. Since the mileage varies slightly from year to year, due to maintenance repairs, footbridges washed out, erosion control, etc, the halfway point also varies. They don’t move the sign each year, so this is always considered the halfway benchmark. 


When I got to Pine Grove Furnace State Park, I was hungry, so I went straight to the Pine Grove General Store for a burger. It actually turned out to be a burgersaurus - it was huge. Because of its proximity to the halfway point, this place is the location of the thru-hiker’s Half Gallon Challenge:  eating a half gallon of ice cream in a single sitting. Since I only started at Harper’s Ferry, I don’t really feel like I’ve earned the right to the challenge. Still, it’s ice cream. I’ve been training for this my entire life. I think tomorrow I’ll tackle it. 


Unfiltered had just finished his half gallon when I walked up. 28 minutes. 


Janet intercepted me with a care package here. I opened it in the bunk room while several hikers were there. I had a down quilt (going to send the sleeping bag home; it’s too warm for the bag and the quilt weighs less). I was expecting that. But I wasn’t expecting the treats she sent:  some cookies, a variety of protein bars and snacks, and a new roll of toilet paper. The other hikers said, ‘That’s the biggest roll of toilet paper I’ve ever seen.’  I replied, ‘I guess she just made an unintentional statement about our household.’  It was pretty dang funny. 


I did get some bad news today, though. A friend of ours succumbed to COVID today. We have known Jack for over twenty years. He was recommended to us by a colleague for home remodeling. We liked Jack from the moment we met him and he soon became a trusted friend as well as our go-to guy for most any large home construction project. Over those twenty-plus years, Jack literally rebuilt our home from end-to-end, top-to-bottom. We knew Jack as a master craftsman, an artist, a good father to his family, and a friend.  We will miss you.","Birch Run shelter

I needed to get to the Post office in Mt. Holly Springs to send the sleeping bag home. Otherwise, I’ll have to carry it plus the quilt Janet sent into Boiling Springs, PA. I tried three separate shuttle services but they were all unavailable. I really hated to burden her again, but in desperation I called Big Sister and, sure enough, she came through for me. What a marvelous trail angel. This hostel is very interesting. It’s an old, historic building, built in 1827, and was part of the Underground Railroad network to help slaves escape to freedom in the north. And up until yesterday, it didn’t have central air conditioning, just portable units in the dorm rooms. Yesterday they completed installing central heat and air and turned it on for the first time, so I was one of the very first beneficiaries of it.I moseyed over to the AT Museum located here in the park. It’s pretty good. They’ve got some neat historical items such as Grandma Gatewood’s homemade duffel she carried her gear and supplies in and one pair of the Keds sneakers she wore on her thru-hike. If you’re not familiar with Grandma Gatewood’s story, you should check it out. It should be a movie. Very compelling. 


OK, I’ll admit it, I chickened out on the half gallon challenge. Felt like I haven’t earned it yet but, more importantly, I figured I shouldn’t risk a bout of gastrointestinal distress this early in the hike. I did watch a handful of hikers tackle the challenge. Apparently the secret is to avoid ice cream that has chunks in it - the chunks require time chewing and gives your stomach feedback mechanisms enough time to tell your brain, “Whoa, there big boy, that’s quite enough for now”.  But since they had Moosetracks and I wasn’t doing the full on challenge, I decided to do some light training with a pint of it. It wasn’t the preferred and superior Mayfield’s Moosetracks. It was Hershey’s Moosetracks, an inferior but acceptable variety.

I got up early, had some hot tea at the hostel and headed out. I was the first one to depart the hostel, although Great Dane and Recess weren’t far behind me. Through the park the trail was manicured but then began climbing and became the more familiar pile-of-rocks trail. Walked through an off and on drizzle most of the day but I loved it. It was a bit cooler and the leaves were dripping but It felt like I had the woods to myself and I thought it was great.



Thank goodness, I seem to be out of the gypsy moth caterpillar defoliation zone.
I stopped at the highly recommended  Green Mountain General Merchandise store.  It didn’t disappoint. I got a reuben sandwich there and it was excellent. I also polished off an entire half gallon of tea. What can I say, I’ve been missing tea, I was thirsty, and it was just sitting there in the cooler, singing its siren song. So I sat on their porch watching it drizzle rain while I enjoyed the Reuben and tea. Recess and Great Dane showed up a few minutes before I left and looked like they were getting ready to enjoy a nice lunch there also. 


Part of the hike today was up on a ridge where the trail wound its way through, as the guidebook said, “boulder mazes”. They weren’t kidding. Boulders as big as a house jumbled all over. A couple of times I had to stop and figure out where the trail was and a few times I had to scramble up and over the boulders in ways that seemed more like rock climbing than hiking. It was fun, though, and I enjoyed it. 


The hike went so well that I got in the zone so much I walked right past the trail to the shelter and had to backtrack about a quarter mile, violating one of the cardinal rules of thru-hiking:  never hike reverse miles.Three section hikers were already at the shelter: two brothers from Georgia and Boxcar Willie, a retired wildlife biologist from Utah. I didn’t get the two brothers’ names. They said they’re never on trail long enough to get trail names. They were really funny.  Both are about to retire. They started section hiking in 1995 and this is the very last section for them. They’re southbound and when they get to Pen-Mar Park, they will have hiked the entire trail!  In 26 years, there’s only been two years that they didn’t hike a section together. One of them is a geology professor and the other is a physician. They said that their mother always tells people about their hiking together, “If this one falls on a rock and gets hurt (pointing to the geologist), he can patch him up (pointing to the physician). And if this one falls falls on a rock (pointing to the physician), he can tell him what kind of rock it was (pointing to the geologist).The funniest line of the night, though, came when Recess arrived at the shelter. She arrived several minutes before Great Dane and walked up when us four senior guys (me, Boxcar Willie, and the Brothers Georgia) were sitting on the edge of the shelter, shooting the breeze. Recess is an attractive young woman, I’m guessing mid-twenties, and when she strolled up she said hi to everyone, but she passed by them, sauntered over to stand in front of where I was sitting, and proceeded to engage me with conversation - where were the tenting areas, had I made a trip to the spring for water yet, was that the privy over that way, and so on. Typical hiker talk. After a few minutes talking, she said she was going to go scout out the tent spots and walked away. I started to take another bite of my delicious Slim Jim, cheese stick, and mustard tortilla wrap when I realized the other three guys were all just kinda staring at me slack-jawed. Boxcar Willie, in a dry, deadpan mumble said, “It must be the kilt.”  I didn’t bother to tell them I had met her previously on the trail.","Pine Grove Furnace State Park

It drizzled a steady rain most of the night and the shelter was almost full - seven hikers in an 8-person shelter. 


I wasn’t the first out of the shelter this morning, Boxcar Willie and the Brothers Georgia left shortly ahead of me. I congratulated the two brothers on their pending AT section hiking completion and wished them well. I won’t see them again since they’re southbound. They were really fun to chat with. A couple miles in I passed Boxcar Willie. He left his pack cover in the shelter and was debating whether to go back and get it. There’s nothing more aggravating than having to backtrack mileage. I wish I had noticed it and brought it to him. That’s another thing about shelters- it’s really easy to lose your stuff. Everyone tries to keep their gear proximal to them but inevitably there’s a jumble of gear scattered around, hung on pegs, hooks, or nails. In the dim morning light, it’s very easy to overlook something or confuse it with someone else’s kit. 


After I passed Boxcar Willie, I once again had the trail to myself. It wasn’t raining but the woods had that soft, dripping, post-rain feel to it. I love that and I loved the morning’s hike into Boiling Springs. 


Just as I came into Boiling Springs, PA there was big trail magic set up by Emmanuel Baptist Church. They had a canopy with tables of goodies set up:  breakfast burritos, bananas, apples, power bars, chips, Gatorade, water to refill our water bottles with, trash bags to collect our garbage, and a bunch of camp chairs set up. You can’t imagine what a luxury a chair with a back is until you’ve spent multiple days sitting on logs, rocks, shelter floors, or, at best, a picnic table. 


It was first rate trail magic. I think I was their first guest and they lavished me with goodies and attention. This was the very first time they’ve done a trail magic event. The pastor told me he had been casting about for something to involve and engage their younger church members and someone suggested doing trail magic for the hikers.  The pastor said he thought they probably overdid it on the food and goodies relative to the number of hikers that would come through. I told him that, however many hikers came through, he can be assured that the gratitude and appreciation will far exceed those numbers. 



There were several younger church members there helping out and they had a ton of questions for me. It was a pleasure to talk to them and share the experience. In my opinion, they really did a great job at setting a Christ-like example. Other than mentioning that they were a church group, there was no preaching, no proselytizing, no scripture readings, no interrogations about my religious beliefs or leanings. It was simply a kind and selfless service rendered to a foot weary traveler. Kudos to Emmanuel Baptist Church all the way around - setting an example of service to others and an excellent execution of trail magic. I will never forget it.Boxcar Willie, Recess, and Great Dane walked up as I was getting ready to leave. As she was walking up, Recess asked me, “How long have you been here, ‘Cada?”  I winked at the young folks standing around and replied, “About 3 hours or so, right guys?”  It was pretty funny. They settled in to luxuriate in some of the magic and I moved on. 


Today’s walk was through the Cumberland Valley.  A lot of farmland with wheat and corn. The trail was easy, no big climbs or descents, although it was mud in a lot of places from last nights rain. At one point I walked past a very active shooting range. Couldn’t actually see it because of the woods but it was busy. I believe the Army War College is somewhere near here; heck it could have been a range associated with it. 


Saw Legs and met Turbo as they were taking a break. Their names are well deserved because they soon overtook me and left me wallowing in their wake. 


Even though the hike was shorter and the terrain was easy today, I was tuckered out when I reached the road crossing. The road is very busy and there’s an overhead walkway for the hikers. On the far side there was a short but very steep trail with a gauntlet of poison ivy down the embankment to the road. I braved the descent and subsequent road walk to the luxury of a Quality Inn for some R4:  rest, recuperation, resupply, and reorganizing. 


I had a good dinner of liver and onions and a salad at the diner next door, purchased a few supplies from the Sheetz across the street, had a nice long phone call with Janet, and can now hardly keep my eyes open. 


I believe Carlisle, PA is where Jim Thorpe attended the Indian Industrial School and began his legendary athletic career. If one needs some inspiration, you needn’t look any further than Jim Thorpe’s story. I’d love to go see if there are any museums or monuments to him here, but the trail awaits. G’night.","Alec Kennedy shelter

‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639519,"Had a bit of a leisurely day. Ate a big breakfast at the diner, packed up and headed out. Short miles today. I wanted to do more, but the next shelter was more than I wanted to tackle today.


Some more farmland hiking this morning but then started climbing and left the Cumberland Valley behind. Had a fairly strenuous climb up to the shelter and stopped for water a mile or so before the shelter since the source at the shelter was reported dry. There by the trail and the water source was an old, really old, upside down hulk of a car. I have no idea how it managed to get there. It looked like it had hit a tree because the bumper was caved in, but had been there so long the tree had grown around the bumper. And sitting on a log just a few paces away was a young female thru-hiker diligently writing (a journal?  A letter? A text?  Who knows?). It was a bit surreal. I filtered some water and up walked Stealth, a young woman who just graduated from college. She did the southern half of the trail last year and plans to do the northern half this year before she has to get a job and start the career thing. 


At the shelter I was pleased to see Lambo and Bear. I had last seen them back at Tumbling Run shelter. They’re from Llano, TX and did about 1600 miles of the trail in 2019 and are trying to finish it up this year. Also at the shelter I met French Broad, my favorite trail name so far. She lives near the French Broad river in NC. 


Shortly after arriving at the shelter, two guys came trotting up. It was Twigs, a previous thru-hiker who lives in D.C. and was friends with Bear. But the amazing part was that he lugged up a duffle bag full of PBR and hard cider for the hikers. Reminiscent of a scene from a National Geographic special where the herd of wildebeest stumble across the last watering hole in the Serengeti, the hikers fell upon the duffle bag full of beer and cider, quaffing it down in about three big glugs. Then Twigs rounded up all the empties, said his goodbyes and trotted back off the mountain to keep a prior engagement in DC. Amazing!  And after that round of drinks, Lambo built a nice fire and we had some really funny conversations the rest of the evening.","Carlisle, PA

‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639522,"Wow, what a light show last night!  An hour or so after hiker midnight (hiker midnight varies depending on who you ask but the most common answer seems to be 9:00), an impressive thunderstorm landed on us. I could see the sky coming alive with lightning well before I started hearing any thunder and hoped it might skirt around us. But once I started hearing the thunder, I could tell it was marching straight for us. The night was warm and I had all the flaps open on the tent for air circulation, so I crawled out of the sleeping bag liner and battened down the hatches before the storm hit. About 30 minutes later it crashed upon us with non-stop lightning and torrential rain. I don’t know if the folks in the shelter got wet from rain blowing in on them, I don’t think so from the direction it came from, but I was mighty proud of my little tent. I just laid back and listened to the rain lash the tent and watched the lightning strobe light the sky. It was quite marvelous, although it did conjure up the storm scene in Forrest Gump when Lieutenant Dan was riding out the hurricane at the top of the shrimp boat mast. 


Aside from the hour or so the storm flailed us, I slept pretty good last night, possibly my best night of tent sleep yet. I think I’m finally getting calibrated to the tent:  where everything needs to be, how to move around somewhat gracefully inside it rather than wallowing around like a hog on ice, how firm to blow up the sleeping pad and pillow, those sorts of things. The only down side was that I had to pack up a wet tent this morning. I can shake the water of it pretty good, but it invariably still has a fair amount of water, mud, small sticks, leaf detritus, etc sticking to it when I pack it up wet. That not only gets everything else kinda yucky, it also means I’m carrying around extra weight. 


I wasn’t first on trail this morning. Stealth and French Broad stayed in the shelter so they were quicker packing up than I was. The hike was really nice except the trail seemed to be made up entirely of jagged, bowling ball sized rocks, all of which were wet and slick and some of which would shift underfoot. After while, fighting the footing became wearying. As I approached Duncannon, the trail turned steeply downward for quite a distance. I feel sorry for the SOBOs making that climb  upon leaving Duncannon. It’s quite a haul. 


Close to where the trail started the steep descent into Duncannon, I passed the most spectacular view I’ve seen yet. It was from Hawk Rock and the weather was perfect. I was there for several minutes soaking it in when a grandfather, father, and young son (about 12 I would guess) came up from below. They were equally impressed with the panorama and were kind enough to take a picture. I reciprocated and took some pictures of the three of them. After looking around a bit, the grandfather mused, “Wonder where that goes?”, pointing up the trail in the direction I came from.  I said, “That goes to Georgia”. They looked perplexed for a moment then the father put it together and said, “Is this the Appalachian Trail?”  A question and answer session then followed and I congratulated the young boy on hiking part of the AT. He was beaming and I could tell he was eager to go tell his Mom, friends, and anybody else who will listen about it. 


I finally reached Duncannon and saw a sign that said it used to be called Petersburg but was renamed to honor the Duncan family. Which I thought was really cool since I’m a Duncan through my Mom. But then I took the long road walk into town and was a bit less enthusiastic. It’s kind of a tired town, lots of closed businesses and boarded up homes. It’s clearly seen better days. I stopped at The Doyle, an old run down hotel that’s iconic in the thru-hiker world but they were closed, not permanently, just on Mondays and Tuesday’s. 


There are limited options for staying here so I snagged a room in a cheap, Norman Bates looking motel a few miles out of town. I’ll pick up the journey in the morning outside The Doyle.","Darlington shelter
","Duncannon, PA","Jun 14, Mon",11.30
‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639547,"The shuttle driver dropped me off at a mini-mart place just around the corner from The Doyle. It was the type of place you can tell gets most of its business from selling cigarettes, lottery tickets, and cheap beer. When I went in there was nobody in there - no customers, no clerk, nobody. I milled around for 5 minutes or so scouting out and collecting my supplies. Still nobody. I called out. No answer. I started to get worried I was going to find dead bodies behind the counter or maybe they were being held hostage in back. Finally a local woman came in and YELLED toward the storeroom, “Hey, Frank! Get out here!”  A guy finally ambled out, got her a pack of smokes without her even asking or telling him which brand, put them on the counter, she paid and left. But, the place had enough to get me resupplied for a few days and the clerk spotted me 11 cents rather than break a twenty (hikers don’t carry change, too heavy).  


Resupply completed, I organized my food bag, threw away the extra packaging, and walked to Goodies for breakfast across the street from The Doyle. The western omelette was good but then the waitress showed me the hiker pancake breakfast and I wish I had gotten that. It was a huge pile of pancakes. 


Leaving Duncannon involved a long road walk and finally coming to the foot of the mountain to begin the next climb. Had to cross some railroad tracks and Janet told me there was something in her news feed about a rescue of a hiker who had fallen on or near the tracks a day or two before. I couldn’t find any other hikers who had heard about it though. 


The climb up was long but not nearly as intense as the descent into Duncannon. When I got to the top I reached for my bandana to wipe sweat out of my eyes and...no bandana. I immediately knew where it was - back in the motel on the clothes rack where I had washed it and hung it up to dry. I had packed up, double checked everything and still walked off and left it. I was so mad at myself. I loved that bandana. It had been an early birthday present from Janet, plus it was very functional, plus it was a really cool bandana. I was on top of the mountain and had some cell phone signal, so I called Janet. She contacted the hotel and they said they would mail it to her and then she can get it to me. I won’t be fully un-mad at myself until I have it back in hand but I did feel a little better. Janet is a marvel. Love that girl!


Most of the morning was a rocky ridge scramble over crazily slanted rock outcrops. I stopped for water at a shelter and Insight and Care Bear walked up. Haven’t seen them since Pine Grove Furnace and it was good to chat with them. They have a similar pace and we played leapfrog all day. 


At a road crossing parking lot, a guy was giving out trail magic, including some dehydrated backpacking meals. His trail name was Huffer & Puffer, a 1998 thru-hiker. Insight and Care Bear walked up a few minutes later and we chatted with H & P for a bit. He gave us some good intel about the section ahead. The extra goodies also gave me another option on how/where to take my next town stop and zero day. 


My destination for the night was the Peters Mountain shelter. It is a huge shelter but the weather is nice so I’m tenting again. A section hiker from Philadelphia is here who has aspirations of thru-hiking in a couple years. He asked some good questions and I could tell he is serious about it, not just a casual curiosity.   This shelter is the one that replaced the shelter that Earl Shaffer, the first person to thru hike the AT, had built. It was dismantled and now resides in the AT Museum back in Pine Grove Furnace state park. Thought that was kinda cool.","Duncannon, PA
",Peters Mountain shelter,"Jun 15, Tue",11
‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639548,"I hiked most of day with Insight and Care Bear.  They’d be ahead awhile and stop to take a break, I’d catch up and then be ahead of them for a couple hours till I take a break and they pass me again. We leapfrogged down the trail all day like that.


Surprisingly, it’s very difficult to find a room for the zero I had planned. Not sure what’s going on but everywhere nearby is booked. Insight and Care Bear were surprised, too. Since they were also thinking about taking a zero in that time frame, we pooled our resources and found a Knights Inn in Pine Grove, PA with some rooms available and we found a shuttle driver to get us there since it’s a few miles off trail. I’ll have to take my zero a day later than I had hoped for, but that’s OK. I’ve got a viable plan, at least, which is more than I could say 24 hours ago. 


It was a rocky trail today and wore my feet out. The common opinion is that the really rocky part of Pennsylvania begins north of Port Clinton. If so, jeez, it must be really bad there ‘cause so far the trail has been far rockier than my familiar AT stomping grounds in the Smokies. There haven’t been any huge, hours long climbs where you’re going from 2,000 ft to 6,000 feet, but it’s like walking on a dry creek bed all day long. Nothing but jumbled up rocks of all sizes and orientation to navigate over and through. 


I saw the first bear scat on the trail. There was no mistaking it. Fresh and right in the middle of the trail. Didn’t see the bear but I hope he isn’t mad that I interrupted him during his morning constitutional. 


We descended down to a road crossing and a park at Clark Creek and a couple had great trail magic there. Oranges, apples, nuts, chips, batteries, carabiners, all kinds of stuff. Including Amish-style egg salad with buns for sandwiches. I had never heard of Amish egg salad but it was delectable. While we were there a guy came up from the creek with a fishing rod. Our host asked him if he had any luck and he said he’d caught seven. I’m currently scratching my hiking itch, but, man did that get my fishing itch acting up. It was a beautiful little stream and I could just imagine being on it with a 5-weight fly rod. Oh well, one itch at a time. 


After the trail magic, the trail climbed back up and a couple miles later I came across a spring that had a good flow but was the most bizarre orange color I’ve ever seen, and I’ve worked on hazardous waste sites. It had stained the leaf litter the same orange color for several feet along each bank. I suspect prior mining activities and acidic mine tailings have dissolved heavy metals into the water. I assume it isn’t high enough concentrations to cause acute problems or the state would have posted signs and/or performed a cleanup action, but there’s no way I’d get water there. The water filters used on the trail will remove sediment and microorganisms, and do a good job of it, but they don’t do anything to treat or remove dissolved chemicals. 


I got to Yellow Springs, an abandoned coal mining community where the three of us had planned to camp. This is the first night I’ve spent that wasn’t proximal to a shelter, so there’s no water, no privy, and no bear pole or box. So, especially considering the scat I saw earlier in the day and comments on Guthook from previous hikers that bears frequent the camp, I did my first bear hang for my food bag. That’s not a life skill I’ve ever needed before but I’ve watched a couple YouTube videos and practiced at home with the PCT method and it turned out respectable. Not quite as high as I would have liked, but still a solid 10 feet or more above the ground.","Peters Mountain shelter
",Yellow Springs tent site,"Jun 16, Wed",13.40
‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639549,"At 1:15 a.m. I was awakened by the sound of someone/something flipping over large rocks nearby. If you’ve ever hunted for crawdads in a creek, imagine the sound that a large rock makes when you flip it over to see if a crawdad is under it and the rock clunks against another large rock when it lands. It happened several times, clear and distinct as a bell. No other sound, just rocks getting flipped over. Insight and Care Bear were camped on the other side of the tenting area and they heard it too because Insight got up and I could see his headlamp checking this way and that to see what the heck it was.  I lay there for awhile listening but didn’t hear it again but I started thinking that maybe a bear had managed to get my food bag and the sound was him trying to get it open. So I got up and checked the bear bags. They were fine. So then I thought maybe it was a night hiker stumbling down the trail. Went back to bed and didn’t hear anything more. It thoroughly woke me up, though, and I didn’t sleep well the rest of the night. It was cool last night, in the upper 40’s. I didn’t get cold but I did get my puffy jacket out and drape it over my down throw. That knocked the chill off and I was fine; just couldn’t sleep. I broke camp and headed out before Insight and Care Bear were up. 


A couple miles down trail I stopped for breakfast and they caught up to me. Insight asked if I heard the rock clunking noises last night and confirmed that he had gotten up with his headlamp but didn’t see anything. Then Care Bear piped up that hiker comments from a couple years ago in Guthook from last year and three years ago reported similar incidents and the site is haunted from a massacre during the French and Indian War. Creepy!  I don’t know what it was but I’ve spent a lot of time out in the woods at night and I’ve never heard anything like it. 


Since there wasn’t a shelter at the campsite, there was no privy, so I made my first cat hole attempt. Overall, it worked out pretty well. My Norden bombsight needs a little calibrating, but I had made the target crater sufficiently large just in case, so it was OK. What, TMI?


Walking up to the Rausch Gap shelter a doe and her little spotted fawn walked right in front of me. This shelter is a very interesting design; it even has asphalt shingles for the roof. And a piped spring is right in front of the shelter with a stainless steel water collection trough. The water is flowing a bit slow but it’s still a pretty nice water set up!


A couple miles after the shelter there was a treacherous  traverse across beaver dam on Stony Creek. We had to walk across logs, branches, and sticks that were essentially just floating in the water. The only thing giving it any structure or support was just that they were all jammed in and tangled up together. It was wobbly and bouncy and had to carefully balance with my trekking poles and gingerly work my way from log to log. But, the three of us all got across OK. 


We had another tentative water crossing, this time over Trout Run on a big fallen log. Getting across the log took some care but wasn’t too bad but the dismount off the log on the other side was a bit sketchy. I wouldn’t say I nailed the landing but it got the job done. 


Shortly after that we came to a trailhead parking area at the PA 443 road crossing. I crested the little hill, saw the parking area, and a woman looked my way and asked, “Would you like a root beer float?”  Ohmigosh!!!  Root beer floats were one of the true treats of my childhood and this woman, a perfect stranger, made me one right there on the spot. Her trail name is Jinx and she also had homemade brownies, and Friendship bread. Yes, I sampled all of it. She was so nice, we sat and talked for a bit. The only down side was that a PA DCNR ranger drove up and admonished her for not coordinating the “event” with them beforehand (evidently the parking area is on state park land). In a bit of irony, he helped himself to one of the brownies when she offered it to him. We got a giggle out of it after he left. 


Today is my birthday and I will never forget locking eyes with Jinx as she cheerily asked, “Would you like a root beer float?”  It was a marvelous, unexpected birthday treat. Thank you, Jinx!


My feet are still sore, mainly the right one. I hope it isn’t plantar fasciitis or something like that cropping up. I’m trying to be diligent about stretching in the mornings before I start hiking.

I’m trying to stretch it regularly and using Vitamin I. It helps a bit. Going to try and stay off it on tomorrow’s zero day as much as possible. 


Our shuttle driver, Cricket, was scheduled to meet us at the road crossing. We got there quite a bit early but a local day hiker talked to us about the trail for a long time so the wait didn’t seem too long. 


Insight had the line of the day as we were waiting on the shuttle, “I’m craving perishable food.”  How true that statement is.After Cricket picked us up she made a pit stop at McDonalds where we got take out and then dropped us at an off-off-off the beaten track laundromat. I haven’t been to a laundromat since college days. I think the same machines are still being used. Insight and Care Bear were smart and changed into their town clothes at the trailhead. I gambled that the laundromat would have a bathroom I could change in so I could put all my stinky, grimy hiking clothes in the washing machine. I lost. No bathroom. Occupied houses surrounded the place so I couldn’t change behind the building. But, aha, I’m wearing a kilt. So I just found a corner of the laundromat and shimmied into my mostly-clean running shorts underneath the kilt, then pulled the kilt off and tossed it in with the other hiking clothes. No skin was exposed, no police were called. It was pretty slick. 


Once the clothes were started, I fell upon my McDonalds and devoured it. Haven’t had a McD’s meal in a long time. Kinda like laundromats, they haven’t changed much, but I was mighty grateful for both of them. 


After laundry was done, Cricket swung back by and took us to the motel. It was an incremental improvement over the last motel stay (much more expensive though), but it seems clean, has a shower and a bed. I’m happy. 


In a big surprise, I heard a knock at the door. It was Insight and he had walked to the nearest package store and brought me some local amber ales for my birthday!  I put them on ice. After they had chilled and I had taken a much needed shower, I went to their room, we toasted birthdays and new friends with the ales, walked to a diner about a mile away, ate some excellent haddock and “potato filling” I had never heard of but was quite tasty, walked back and called it a night.

I did go eat at the diner about a mile down the road. Meatloaf. It was good. When I checked in, the hotel guy had a flyer for what was reportedly the only place that delivered pizza to the hotel. But then he said, “I wouldn’t recommend it, though.”  I considered ordering it for dinner, I mean how bad can pizza be?  Heck, even grocery store frozen pizza is not bad. OK, I  admit, I have a pizza weakness. It’s my food kryptonite. But I was still kinda full from the meatloaf and decided I didn’t want to risk GI distress on the trail from “not recommended” pizza, so I managed to stay strong and resist.

‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639711,"Whew, long day but I feel pretty good. Dang rocks, though. They’re pervasive and unrelenting. It makes it hard to get my hiking zen going or to enjoy the trail because I have to constantly focus on my footing and all I see of the trail are my boots, my trekking pole tips, and the rocks I’m getting ready to have to step on, over, or around. 


Speaking of boots, I’ve had my first serious gear failure. The tread on my Keen boots came completely separated from the underlying sole. I noticed yesterday there was some minor separation but today it came completely unglued?  Unvulcanized?  Whatever they do to bond the tread onto the rest of the boot. It’s come undone from the heel all the way up to the mid-foot and now it’s like a flip-flop beach sandal flapping with every step I take. It even sounds like a sandal. Not only does it flip mud all up and down my leg when it flaps, but it’s also a bit dangerous. It sometimes hangs on a rock or root while I’m hiking, almost tripping me. Other times I’ll plant my foot on a sloping rock and then when I commit weight to it, the tread will stay in place but, because the tread isn’t bonded to the rest of the shoe except at the toes and ball of my foot, my foot will suddenly slip sideways. 


I’m going to try and temporarily repair it tonight but it’s going to necessitate a footwear replacement. Hamburg, PA has a Cabela’s and is just a day’s hike away. That’s probably my best bet. 



This is my fourth pair of Keen Targhee hiking boots. I’ve loved them all and, until now, gotten good service out of them. Heck, my last pair took me through all my training hikes for the Wainwright Coast to Coast trek, the actual 192-mile Wainwright journey, countless dog walks, and 90 percent of my AT training hikes. I’ve probably got well over 700 miles on them and they’re still going strong. But I wanted a new pair to tackle the AT in, so I bought the exact same boot, put about 30 miles of training hikes on them just to get them limbered up, and stepped onto the trail with them. So they’re really quite new. I realize the rocky terrain is tough on footwear but they shouldn’t have come apart this early or this suddenly. I’m going to call Keen and see if they’ll replace them or somehow make it right. If not, I’m going to tell them the trail name “Karen” remains unassigned and I’m not afraid to take it on.
Now for the hike today. Rocks.


I did surprise a buck who trotted a few feet off trail and just stood looking at me. His antlers were in the velvet phase and the sun was behind him shining through the thin skin of his perked-up ears, giving him an angelic-deer look. I wanted to take a photo but as soon as he heard me start to unzip my waist pouch to retrieve the camera, he bounded away. 


I hiked all day within a quarter mile or so of Insight and Care Bear. I also ran across Lambo and Bear again. Last time I saw them was at Darlington shelter the night of the big storm. 


Around the middle of the day I was overtaken by a gentleman, Grandpa Fuzzy. He’s 70 years old and started at Springer on March 26. As he was passing me, we came upon a marker someone had made denoting the 1200 mile point for the NOBO’s. I asked him if he’d like me to take his photo at the marker and he gratefully said yes. On all the previous milestone markers, he said no one had been around to take his pic with them. I also learned that in the 1200 miles he’s covered, he’s taken only three zero days!  He seems a very self-disciplined individual. He gave me a great piece of trail advice, “Just take what the trail gives you each day, whether it’s rocks, or climbs, or heat, or whatever. And don’t let it beat you that day.”


At the shelter I met Jeopardy, a young man doing a section hike up to Nee York, and Grizzly the Mad Scientist, a NOBO.

(Technically, I think this year the solstice was on June 20 just before midnight; it varies from year to year, but Hike Naked Day is traditionally on the un-technically June 21 solstice. I didn’t see a single in-the-buff hiker, though. As for me, I fully support and embrace thru-hiker traditions, but hiking naked?  No. I picture rounding a bend in the trail and there’s a troop of Girl Scouts. In addition to the sheer mortification factor, it seems a good way to end up on a sex offender registry. As I said, though, I do generally support trail traditions. Did you know that in a kilt you can go “full regimental” and nobody is ever the wiser?  Just saying. 


Rained pretty hard again last night so had to pack up a wet tent. I’ll have to dry it out when I get a chance. 


Today’s hike:  Rocks. And mud. And a hella steep descent into Port Clinton. 


I tried temporary repairs on my miscreant boot tread. Tried fastening the flapping tread in place with duct tape. Fail. Tried tying it up with a string. Fail. I finally just cut it off with my knife. It was better to hike in, but still sketchy. Without the overlying tread, the boot sole is as smooth as a bologna skin. It made the mud and wet rocks from last night’s rain even more bracing. 


Cricket picked us up at the Port Clinton train station and took us into town. Dropped me off at Cabela’s to get some new footwear and Insight and Care Bear at Walmart for their resupply. I’ll have to resupply later. Footwear replacement is a priority. 


Cabela’s didn’t have a big selection of hiking footwear. Ended up with a pair of Keens but a different model than my failed ones. We’ll see how these do. In the morning I’ll try to contact Keen and see what they have to say. 


As I’ve mentioned, a couple years ago Janet and I did the Wainwright Coast to Coast trek across England. I used it as a bit of a trial run for the AT. I figured if I enjoyed it and thrived while doing it, then maybe the AT was a realistic possibility rather than just a pipe dream. The Wainwright C2C is 192 miles long. Today I’m at 193.7 miles on the AT. Which means I have almost exactly 2,000 miles remaining. But instead, I think I’m going to use a Wainwright as my unit of measure, i.e. a “Wainwright” equals 192 miles. The AT is therefore 11.4 Wainwright’s long. As of today, I’ve completed one Wainwright; I have 10 more to do. Barring injury or anything unforeseen, I think I have 10 more Wainwright’s in me. That sounds far less daunting then 2000 miles. Reframe the issue, influence the outcome.","Eagle’s Nest shelter

‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640037,"Today was a zero day, partially due to re-equipping and partially due to the fact it was forecast to rain all day. It did. I booked a room at the Motel 6 in Shartlesville, PA. Insight and Care Bear also decided to zero here. My room was remarkably dim, just a bathroom light and a single floor lamp with no lamp shade, just a bare bulb. For it to be a Motel 6, they sure didn’t leave much of a light on. But it was dry and I got to reorganize gear, wash clothes in the bathroom sink, and resupply at the Dollar General. 


I was looking forward to a big breakfast at the nearby diner, walked over and it was closed. On Tuesdays!?!?  I commonly see restaurants closed on Mondays, but Tuesdays?  So, we donned our rain gear and walked a mile or so over to the Love’s Truck Stop / McDonalds / Subway. I opted for Subway and when I asked for ice tea, they told me they didn’t have any tea, that there’s a tea shortage. Diners closed on Tuesday and now a tea shortage. I’m starting to think maybe I’ve been wished into the cornfield. There’s a flyer at the motel for a pizza place that delivers that I may try for supper (unknown if it’s “not recommended” by hotel staff); if they’re closed I’ll know I stepped off the Appalachian Trail and...into the twilight zone.","Shartlesville, PA

‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640038,"Today was a beautiful day. The rain cleared the air and cooled things down a bit. With the lower humidity, visibility was excellent - crisp and clear, not the hazy soft-filter look of mid-summer. 


Early in today’s hike I met Rippin’ Riles, another 61-year old. He thru-hiked in 1980 and has returned to attempt a repeat performance. Also met several new youngsters:  Sunflower, Studebaker, Sherbet. Sherbet said he did the hike naked day thing. Considering the mixture of grimy skin, dark tan skin, and pasty white skin most of us acquire out here, I suggested he should have gone with the trail name Neapolitan while he was doing it. 


At one of the increasingly rare on-trail water sources, several hikers were congregated, collecting and filtering water. Someone mentioned seeing Grandpa Fuzzy earlier in the week. I remarked how much he looked, acted, and sounded like Donald Sutherland. Blank faces. I said, “You know, the actor. The M.A.S.H. movie?  Backdraft?  The Italian Job?  Keifer Sutherland’s dad?”  Still blank faces. Finally, one of them replied, “I don’t know who those people are.”  Ouch. 



There were rocks again today but not as bad as previous days. Much of the hike was on old logging roads. That made for nice hiking.
I experienced the best views so far of the trail in PA at Pulpit Rock and the Pinnacle. It was marvelous. The Pinnacle is notorious for rattlesnakes but I didn’t see any even though I volunteered to walk point for Insight and Care Bear most of the day. 


Eckville shelter is interesting. It’s on a guys property who lives in an old but very nice farmhouse next to the shelter. I noticed an area next to the house was an old cistern for collecting rainwater from the roof, but had been abandoned and filled in long ago. It reminded me of old farmhouses in TN. The hiker shelter portion of the property consisted of a bunkhouse, a spigot, a flush toilet in the privy, and a solar shower. The yard was manicured and I fixed supper and watched the hummingbirds battle over the trumpet vine and feeders. 


I thought about sleeping in the bunkhouse but decided to tent in a lawn area across the road from the house. It’s the designated tent area and it’s very nice. I thought I might have it to myself but quite a few other hikers are now coming in and setting up. Heck it might be a tent city before morning.","Port Clinton train station

‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640040,"Nice day for hiking but it got a bit hot.  Fortunately, I was one of the first to leave and got my miles in before the main heat of the day. I would have been on trail even earlier except I wasn’t sure what proper etiquette was for breaking camp in a tent city. Before nightfall last night, probably 8 or 10 tents had been set up, a couple of them really close to me. So this morning, I just laid there wondering if I should go ahead and get up, but I also didn’t want to wake everyone up around me with the noise of breaking camp and packing up. 


Later in the day, Insight said that when Care Bear woke up she could see my tent and mentioned to him, “I’m surprised ‘Cada isn’t up and gone yet.”  He told her, “I bet he’s awake but is worried about bothering the tenters around him.”  Insight has his trail name for a reason. I’ve found him to be an astute reader of people. 


A fair amount of old logging road walking today. Again not quite as many rocks. Love it but from what I hear it’s a short-lived respite. 


Water is again a bit of an issue. The springs for water sources are either dry or drying up, or are a long distance and usually downhill from the trail. So you have to decide to either risk a source being dry when you get to it, or to resolve to add extra miles and elevation to go get it off trail, or to carry extra water, which is very heavy. I’ve been opting to carry extra, enough to do me until the next reliable source. 


When I got to the Fort Franklin road crossing, a shuttle driver named Mike had left a cooler full of Sprites, some snacks, and some jugs of water. It was all greatly appreciated. I’ve heard good things about that shuttler, that he really goes out of his way to help the hiking community out. 


I’m staying at a hostel tonight, The Shanty at Blue Mountain. This place is terrific. The owner/host picked me up at the road crossing very soon after I called her. The hostel is her private home where she lets hikers stay in the two guest bedrooms. It’s an old farmhouse, built around 1890, that Lynn grew up in. It’s been remodeled to have great amenities without losing the old farmhouse character. It’s clean as a pen, quiet, and sooooo relaxing. The next door neighbors are Mennonite farmers that Lynn gets her eggs from (I’m looking forward to breakfast in the morning!). I grabbed a quick shower and Lynn let me spread out my tent in the back yard to dry and air out and I sat on the patio in the shade with a cold drink and my feet up and watched the breeze create moving green waves in the field of young corn next door. Lynn’s got two cats and they were soon vying for my attention. She has the lyrics to the Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young song painted in a calligraphy font on the wall in her kitchen, “Our house is a very, very, very fine house, with two cats in the yard, life used to be so hard, now everything is easy ‘cause of you”.  



The other hiker staying here in the other bedroom, Polyunsaturated, arrived and Lynn offered to drive us into town to a local pub for dinner. Sounded good to us so she dropped us off. I had a cheesesteak. Polyunsaturated is a young guy who wants to start a business where he offers interactive virtual cooking lessons.  So if you have trouble with making frittatas, you can schedule a lesson and he’ll work you through it remotely. His thinking is that although there are a million YouTube videos about cooking, they’re all one-directional. He wants to make it such that you can ask him questions and interact and he can tell and show you how to hold your knives or whether the cilantro needs to be chopped finer or whatever. Or if you’re having a dinner party, he can be there virtually to give advice on whether the custard is set firmly enough or tell you how to prepare the Mexican street corn. Sounded like a pretty good idea to me. He’s got a website for it, a name for the business, Y’all Cooking, and hopes to get it off the ground after his hike. I wish him well and I might even be one of his customers in the future.
Lynn picked us up after our supper, we had a great chat about nothing in particular, and now I’m plopped down in a quaint, beautiful bedroom trying to figure out if I’ll be able to crawl out of this bed in the morning.","Eckville shelter

‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640042,"Wow, what a day. This has probably been the most epic day of the journey so far. 


Lynne cooked breakfast for me:  eggs, bacon, OJ, hot tea, and blueberry pancakes. I could tell the eggs were fresh and local but the pancakes, wow!  Fresh wild blueberries, locally grown and milled wheat flour, omigosh. It was like lembas, the elvish travelers’ bread in Lord of the Rings. Marvelous!  This was the best lodging money I’ve spent on the trip. 


Lynn dropped me off at the trailhead at 7:30 and it wasn’t long before the adventures began. I don’t hardly know what to say about the Knife’s Edge. A long granite outcropping of huge slabs of sharply angled and broken stone with precipitous drops on either side. This wasn’t picking my way carefully with trekking poles, this was stowing the trekking poles and finding handholds to latch onto as I gingerly inched along from one stone slab to another. White knuckle hiking. I’m sure the view was magnificent but I was too occupied with not falling off to notice. 


I made it through the Knife’s Edge and then, oops. About a quarter mile after the Knife’s Edge I heard another hiker overtaking me. I turned sideways on the trail to see who it was and greet them. It was one of the young guys motoring along. I started to step back to get off the trail to let him by and a root or something caught the back of my boot and suddenly I’m falling backward off the mountain. I did a complete backward somersault, rolling over my pack like it was a turtle shell, and ending up on my hands and knees. The other hiker was at first alarmed but then, after seeing I was OK, roared with laughter, “Holy shit that’s the craziest thing I’ve seen in a long time. You made my morning!”  


I was very, very fortunate. I only got a scraped forearm, shin, and some bruises. It also snapped one of my trekking poles clean off. I guess it got wedged in a rock as I was falling backward and just snapped off. I couldn’t find it though. The fall rattled me a bit but I think I’m fine. All day people kept pointing out the fresh and angry looking scrape on my arm and asking me how I got it. Isn’t that the way it always is?  Most always when you get hurt, it’s when you’re doing something mundane or boneheaded.  Or at least that’s been my experience. It’s never something cool like, “Oh, I got this scar from saving a baby from a burning building,”. It’s always like, “Yeah, I got this stepping off the trail to let someone get by me.”  But, if it’s that or getting seriously hurt, I’ll take the indignity every time. 


A few miles later I came to the parking area for Bake Oven Knob and the Allentown Hiking Club was set up for mega trail magic. They had three canopies, tables, chairs, coolers, and even a grill going. All manner of goodies and treats were available. I had two hot dogs with sauerkraut and mustard, a bowl of fresh fruit, pasta salad, and Oreos. And tea. And Gatorade. It was a hiker feast. They had it well staffed and everyone was very kind and generous and wanted to know all about each hiker’s journey. They saw the scrape on my arm and offered to dress it with first aid supplies they also had for hikers. I’d already washed it with clean water and antibacterial ointment, so I declined. My point is just how well prepared they were to meet the hikers’ needs. Very friendly folks, too. I spoke to a number of them. I even learned about an organized 50-mile hike (!) that’s an annual event starting in D.C. and going up the C&O canal to Harper’s Ferry that a member of the club does. And I learned that tomorrow the club is helping with a major project to remove the graffiti from the Bake Oven Knob rocks. Big tip of the hat to the Allentown Hiking Club!


I left the trail magic and soon came to Bake Oven Knob. I see what their project is about. Graffiti is everywhere. It would be a beautiful place, the view is outstanding, but for the graffiti. I wish them well; removing all that is going to be a daunting task. Keeping it off may be even tougher. Unfortunately, it’s simply too close to the parking area and the knuckleheads have easy access to it. 


I made a plan with Janet to replace my trekking poles in Palmerton. She is a Trail Angel of the Highest Order. 


Getting from the trailhead into Palmerton was a bit of an ordeal. I had been told that it was easy to get a ride by waiting at the traffic light near the trail crossing. Tried putting on my most foot-weary and forlorn but not menacing look, but no luck. I finally  concluded nobody is going to pick up a gray haired, disheveled, sweaty, smelly guy standing at a traffic light - for all they know I’m Hannibal Lecter.  So I worked my way up to the trailhead parking area and, behold, another hiker had summoned an Uber ride and offered to share it with me. I was a bit surprised he’d been able to get an Uber ride out here but I was certainly grateful. 


I’m staying at the Bert’s Steakhouse (and hiker hostel around the alley in back). It’s a place to hang your hat. Maybe I’m just spoiled from Lynn’s place. 


I got a shower and then took Insight and Care Bear to dinner. Today is the last day I’ll see and hike with them. They’ve filled in their PA mileage gap from last year’s aborted thru-hike and now they’re jumping ahead to Connecticut to fill in a few more miles there and then they will have completed the trail together. We had pizza and chatted quite awhile. I’m happy for them but sad to see them go. They were wonderful to hike and hang out with and I learned a ton from them. Happy trails, Insight and Care Bear!  I hope our paths cross again.","PA 309 road crossing

‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640043,"Did my first slack pack today. I had planned to do a couple of slack packs out of Palmerton and arranged it a couple days ago over the phone with a shuttle driver, even to the level of detail of what time she’d pick me up. She left it with a, “Give me a call when you get to Palmerton and we’ll finalize the plan.”  So, when I got to Palmerton, I called, left a voice mail. No response. Called again with another message. Nada. Text message. Nothing. I started panicking because I had prepaid for three nights at the hostel based on the assumption I had two slack packs arranged using Palmerton as home base. Finally I called Mike, the shuttler who had left the trail magic at Fort Franklin road crossing, and he shoehorned me into his schedule on quite short notice. Best Plan B I’ve ever done. The guy is terrific. Super conscientious and reliable. Seems to have a genuine passion for the nomadic thru-hiker community. 


Slack packing is essentially day hiking because you’ve got a ride to/from a trailhead into town. I stripped everything out of my pack except water, lunch and snacks, my puffy jacket and headlamp in case something happened and I had to spend the night in the woods or had to night hike, and my first aid kit. So my pack only weighed a fraction of what it typically does. 


This slack pack was also my first southbound hiking. Mike picked me up this morning and shuttled me forward to Smith Gap, where I then hiked southbound back to Palmerton, where I’m spending another night. A few miles into my southbound hike I saw Marathon, a hiker I met a couple days ago who has a reputation for hiking big miles, hence the name Marathon, approaching me heading north. He saw me, recognized me, and I could see the look of bewilderment spread across his face, and a cartoon bubble question mark appear over his head. “Crap-nation, am I going the wrong way?” he asked. I howled it was so funny. I told him I was doing a southbound slack pack and he said, “I seriously thought maybe I had just hiked about six miles the wrong way.” 
Then, a couple miles later I had an almost identical encounter with Stache. My conclusion - slack packing is wonderful. Southbound slack packing is downright fun.I came across the first wild blueberries today.  They were thick and I gathered about half a cup as a mid-morning snack  they were delish.


Although it was hot and no water sources, it was a relatively easy hike today, mostly ridge walking, not too many rocks or boulder fields, until the descent into Lehigh Gap. That is a dangerous descent, or ascent depending on direction of travel. It is steep as a cow’s face. More like rock cliff climbing than hiking. Fortunately, there is a blue blaze trail around it, which is what I took when I saw what the descent was going to be like. And I don’t feel the least bit bad about it, for a couple reasons. First, it was simply a smarter decision, and second, the ATC is going to make the blue blaze the official trail next year because of the safety concerns with the current route. Although steep, the blue blaze is far less precipitous than the white blaze route. It does add about a half mile, though. Well worth it in my opinion. 


When I got to the trail head parking lot, I tried getting an Uber ride into town. It was a debacle. I’ve ridden Uber before but just riding with friends who had arranged it. This was my first time doing it myself. That might have had something to do with it. But also, the driver was so married to his GPS technology, he could not find the somewhat hidden trailhead parking area, which didn’t show up on his GPS map. I could see him on the road below me.  I called him and gave him explicit directions on how to turn in to the parking area and he just kept repeating, “It says it’s right here!”  I finally reshouldered my pack and walked an extra half mile down the gravel road and then major highway to where he was parked.


I decided to have dinner at Joey B’s, a local pub. They had an Appalachian pizza with chicken and dried tomatoes so I had to try it. Pretty good. I was finishing up when I saw Lambo come in to pick up a to go order. I caught her attention and she came over and told me she had a new trail name:  Twostitch. Then she lifted her chin up and, sure enough, she fell just before Knife’s Edge and had to get her chin stitched up. Yikes!  I don’t want a new trail name. 


I was taking off my boots at the hostel when in walked Unfiltered. Haven’t seen him for a couple weeks. He took a few days off trail to take his dad back home (his dad hiked with him for a few days). It was good to see him. New people I met who are staying at the hostel are Phoenix, Edge, Show Pony, and Biscuit. I think the bubble is catching up with me.  When they heard I did a southbound slack, they all wanted intel on the trail facing them tomorrow. I cautioned them about the climb out of Lehigh Gap and the dearth of water sources.","Smith Gap

‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640483,"Mike was a champion again and dropped me off at the Smith Gap road crossing for another slack pack, this time NOBO. Mainly the hike today was hot. And dry. No water sources to speak of. Fortunately someone left a few gallons of water at an intermediate road crossing. I took about a liter and very glad I did. Thank you, anonymous trail angel!  A long hot climb ensued. I am so glad I slack packed today. It would have been a difficult day otherwise. Between the heat and the rocks, it just drains me. 


I’ve started seeing wild blueberries beside the trail but today I saw large areas of them and loaded with berries. I even came across a guy collecting them in buckets. I gathered up about a cup of them in a zip lock and ate them at my next break. They were ripe and delicious. But it was so hot it was like eating blueberry pie. 


My new Keen boots are coming apart. Same failure mode as the last pair:  the tread is coming unglued from the underlying sub-sole. It’s on both the left and right feet. If the problem progresses like the last pair, I’ve got about 3 days before they’re unusable. I’m going to try and field repair them tonight if I can find some shoe-goo or something comparable. Even worse, they’ve given me blisters. I haven’t had a blister in quite a few years. These boots have given me 3 in the past 2 days. And that’s with me doing active blister prevention management. I use Body Glide every morning on my feet in the high friction areas before I put my socks on. I air out my feet as much as possible and alternate socks so I have dry ones on to the extent I can. If I feel a hot spot forming, I use leukotape on it. Still got blisters. I called Janet and she’s going to send my trail runners to Delaware Water Gap for me to pick up there and I can ditch the boots. It’s a little earlier in the hike than I thought I’d be trading out my boots for trail runners but the new boots accelerated that decision. 


I’m officially done with Keen boots. They used to be great and were my go-to hiking footwear. Now they’re being demoted from the prestigious position of Hiking Boot down to Lawn Mowing Boot. In my opinion, Keen boots are no longer adequate for long distance hiking. They’re probably still good for day hikes or for looking cool at a local Meet-Up get together. But not for the AT. 


I had difficulty getting enough phone signal to let Mike know when to pick me up at the end of the hiking day. Tried sending several texts but kept getting an undelivered error message. Finally, just a couple miles before the road crossing, a message got through. Even with that late notice, Mike was there to pick me up shortly after I got to the day’s destination. And he had a large, ice cold Gatorade waiting for me!  Love that guy.","Smith Gap road crossing

‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640487,"Bert’s was about half an hour late opening up, so I hadn’t finished breakfast when Mike showed up for my shuttle. But I invited him to join me and we had a bit of breakfast and a good chat. Really neat guy. Come to find out, he rode a bike across the country back in 1984. And in the small world category, his brother worked on the same program my wife did at Lockheed Martin in Fort Worth. 


Today’s hike was only 7 miles, a nero into Delaware Water Gap, but it was sauna hot and today was a full pack, not a slack pack. I think the heat is keeping people off the trail; I didn’t see a single other hiker till I started coming in to DWG when I started encountering a few day hikers. 



The view coming into DWG is striking. The mountain has been sliced through by the Delaware River, exposing steep faces of the rock bones of the mountain. It’s fascinating geology; the mountain here is comprised of Silurian Shawangunk conglomerate quartzite. No, I didn’t know that off the top of my head. I looked it up but it sounded so cool I had to work it into the journal and impress my geologist friends.
When I finally got into DWG, I made an immediate stop at Zoe’s Ice Cream Emporium. The trail literally passes their front door.  I indulged in a large peach milkshake. While I was sitting there I saw Stache walk in from the mountain, followed by Unfiltered and Edge. I waved to them but they couldn’t see me sitting inside the Emporium. I thought about sticking my head out the door and giving them a shout, but the milkshake had me firmly rooted to my seat. 


I had promised myself a zero day when I got to DWG to celebrate completing PA so I left the Emporium after slurping every delectable drop from the milkshake and began trudging through town to the hotel. Suddenly behind me I heard a door open and shut, some hurried footsteps, and then a young guy on the sidewalk calling out to get my attention. I turned around, not knowing quite what to expect, and he said,  “Would you mind if I took your picture?”  I said sure and he snapped several pics with a really nice camera. Then he said, “Would you like to come in for some water?”  Then he sweetened the deal with, “Or some pizza and ice cold Cokes or beer?”  My resolve wilted but, hey, I’ve seen Silence of the Lambs; I know how people get lured into places. So I followed him in, a bit warily, but was still unready for what I saw when we got inside. There were 8 or 10 people in the living room, of different ages and genders, all sitting on the floor with their backs against the walls. There wasn’t a single stick of furniture to be seen anywhere. They greeted me warmly and almost in unison when I stepped in.  “Hi, come on in, it’s hippie seating, just grab a spot on the floor,” one of them said. Everybody sitting there on the floor, smiling, saying hi, and eating pizza, with a couple coolers of drinks on ice in the middle of the room and several opened pizza boxes.  It was surreal and a bit more than I could process. I remained standing, ready to bolt and thought, oh shit, have I walked into the DWG satellite office of a Branch Davidian compound?  Finally, one of them caught on to my utter bewilderment and said, “This is Jonathan’s place,” pointing to the young man who took my picture, “but he’s moving today and we’ve been helping him move. If you had been here an hour ago there would have been furniture.”  I glanced around and saw some moving boxes in the hall, packing tape on the kitchen counter. Whew, I started to relax. 


They were all very nice and showered me with pizza, beer, soft drinks, water, and questions about my hike. They told me about DWG, things to eat, see, do around town, the community’s support for the hikers, and so on. At one point someone said that Jonathan had noticed me walking down the sidewalk, exclaimed, “There’s a guy with a backpack!  Wearing a kilt!  I’ve got to get a picture!” and literally ran out the door to catch me. I stayed about 30 - 45 minutes or so and it was one of the most charming and enjoyable random encounters of my life. Finally, I didn’t want to interfere with them getting Jonathan moved, so I thanked them profusely and moved on. 


Trail magic is always, ALWAYS welcome and I don’t mean this in any sort of negative way toward the orchestrated trail magic events that individuals or organizations arrange - I am deeply grateful for such kindness and effort - but the very best trail magic are the spontaneous, unplanned encounters where the kindness of the human spirit is displayed. Those are truly magical moments. Today’s encounter with Jonathan and his friends was one of those.","PA 191 road crossing

‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640491,"Zero day. Of the 14 states the AT crosses, PA has the 3rd most miles of trail behind VIrginia and Maine. For completing PA, I’ve earned a zero. 


Contrary to what one might think, town days and even zero days are usually quite busy. For example, today my first order of business was to do laundry. Fortunately, the hotel has a guest laundry so I didn’t have to find and walk to a laundromat. 


After that I checked at the front desk where a package from Janet with my trail runners had just been delivered. 
Then I walked to a local outfitter to get a bottle of permethrin. Although I had all my clothes treated by InsectShield with permethrin before I started (and it’s supposed to remain effective for a few dozen washings), since I’ll soon be hiking into Lyme Disease HQ, I thought it might be wise to give the clothes a little booster shot.
Walked back to the hotel, treated my clothes with permethrin, and hung them to dry (inside of course; until it dries, permethrin is toxic to cats).  
Then, while the clothes were drying and I wouldn’t be trapped in there breathing pesticide vapors, I took my boots and walked to the Post Office where I boxed them up and shipped them home.
That done, I stopped at a restaurant for some much desired town food.
Now that I was full, it was safe to go to a resupply store without buying four times as much food as I needed or should carry. In this case it was a corner convenience store and I perused the aisles picking up what I needed to fuel me for the next three days of hiking. 


Returned to the room, dropped off the supplies, and went outside to sit on a bench and update my journal. 


A couple hours later I had most of my journal entries wordsmithed and uploaded so I checked on my clothes. They were good and dry, pesticide smell was gone, so I headed back in and packed up all my gear to be ready for an early morning departure. 
I needed to find an ATM (cash is king on the trail). Happily, the hotel had one so I grabbed some additional greenbacks for the next few days.


Cash in hand, I ordered a pizza, talked to Janet, and now it’s time for bed. 


That’s how a town day usually goes. It’s relaxing and recuperating in that you’re not hiking miles and miles with an extra 25-lbs on your back, but it’s far from idle.Plus, since you’re afoot, doing these tasks is considerably more time consuming than it would normally be. 


My wife is wonderful. In addition to my trail runners, she included my old bandana, the one I left at the motel back in Duncannon, in the package. I love that bandana and it was an emotional moment to be reunited with it. Also, she and my lovely niece baked several zip locks of cookies and sent them. Ya know, cookies are a quite good complement to pizza. 


One last thing I want to include with this zero day journal entry. I hiked a significant amount of Pennsylvania with Insight and Care Bear. Now they’ve bounced ahead to Connecticut to fill in their remaining miles, I feel I should say a bit more about them. Care Bear doesn’t just get her name from being cute as a speckled pup, although she certainly is.  Her trail name comes from the fact that she’s a social worker, with most of her time being spent helping people with mental health issues. Empathy is a defining characteristic for her. Hence her trail name. Insight was an Army paratrooper with the 82nd Airborne until a jump training accident left him with a severe vision impairment. After that he went to school and earned a doctorate and worked for the VA. He doesn’t let his vision impairment slow him down in the least. He’s amazing on the trail. I noticed early on that he is also adept at reading people and has a nice touch in dealing with them. His trail name is also quite fitting. 


Not only did I learn a ton from them about thru-hiking, but I found them both to be inspiring people. I consider myself fortunate to have hiked quite a few miles with them but even more fortunate to have befriended them. I sincerely hope our paths cross again.","Delaware Water Gap

‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640492,"Woo-hoo, I made it through Pennsylvania and am now hiking in New Jersey!  



The day started with a fairly long road walk. Crossing the bridge over the river with tractor trailer rigs zooming by just a few feet away is a bit unsettling. And when the heavy, fully loaded ones would fly by, I could feel the bridge rocking up and down on the spans to the point it would give me a few seconds of vertigo. But that soon ended, the trail turned into the forest and began climbing out of the gap.
It was a beautiful day and the forest seemed vibrant, but it started getting really hot again. After climbing out of the gap, I came to Sunfish Pond, a glacial lake on top of the mountain. It was very picturesque. The trail around the pond was rocky, almost as bad as PA. I knew the rocks wouldn’t simply stop at the border but conventional wisdom is that they’ll become less and less of an issue until I hit the White Mountains. 


I had planned to do about 16 miles today but then I arrived at the Mohican Outdoor Center. It’s an outdoor recreation facility operated by the Appalachian Mountain Club. Although they’re oriented mainly toward the weekenders, they are very hiker-friendly. They have a small outfitter store and a deli that was quite good. I had a big club sandwich and a nice salad. The young woman working there thru-hiked the AT last year.  There’s also a nice conference room with tables, screens and projectors, chairs, a couple sofas, and shelves of reading materials. It’s very clean, too.


It was already late afternoon, hot, and storms were predicted later. I asked if they had tent sites and she said, yep, about 100 yards away, free shower, recharging stations, wi-fi, and the conference room is open 24/7, along with the bathrooms. The kitchen opens at 8:00 if you want breakfast before heading out. All for $10. 


Sold!


So here I am, happily trapped by the Mohican Center Vortex. But I’m not alone; several other hikers ended up sucked into the vortex also:  Tagalong, Inchworm, Phoenix, Ketchup, Slingshot, Chewy, Show Pony, Biscuit, and Creature. I hope I can reach escape velocity tomorrow.","Delaware Water Gap

‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640503,"It didn’t storm last night as expected, so I was able to pack up a dry tent. Yay!


After I packed up, I went and got a shower, chatted a bit with the other hikers (Phoenix and Ketchup did a 28 mile day yesterday!  They looked pretty wiped out), and ordered a breakfast sandwich, which was excellent. 


Started hiking and it started raining. And kept raining. And rained some more. I’ve had a few days of hiking in the rain on the trail but so far it’s been either a few showers or a light misting rain. Today was my first day that it maintained a steady drizzle all day long. It was warm enough that I eschewed the rain gear. No matter what brand of rain gear or what the manufacturers say about breathability, if you are doing any serious hiking in rain gear, you’re going to sweat like a pig. It really just serves to keep you warm when it’s raining. So if it’s warm, you get to choose:  be soaked with sweat or soaked with rain. I chose the rain. 



The rain did make for a long day, however, in that footing is even more of an issue. Not only do the rocks become deceptively slippery, but the mud can become slick as a greased pig. It makes for a slow pace. I think there were some good vistas today but they were socked in with the rain.
When I got to the shelter I needed water so took off down the side trail to the spring. There was a doe beside the trail, contentedly munching on some leaves. She watched me carefully but didn’t run even though the trail came within 10 feet of her. Same thing on the way back to the shelter with my water. At the spring there was a good pool for scooping water but there was a large bullfrog sitting on a partially submerged rock beside it. He didn’t move either. Finally when I stepped on the same rock, which I needed to do in order to get the water, he jumped in the pool and swam to the bottom and just sat there. The pool was maybe a foot deep and crystal clear so I could see him plainly. As I was collecting the water, he didn’t budge even though the water bladder was clearly brushing against him. Good thing for him I didn’t want frog legs for dinner. In return, I like to think he refrained from peeing in the water I was collecting. 


I didn’t see anybody on trail today until a father and daughter doing a section hike arrived at the shelter but they set up a tent nearby and then another guy showed up and set up a hammock. We all cooked our respective dinners, talked a bit, and then turned in. It’s supposed to continue raining for the next few days and I didn’t want to have to pack up a wet tent, so it looks like I’ll have the shelter to myself tonight.","Mohican Outdoor Center
",Brink shelter,"Jul 01, Thu",12.80
‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640504,"Bug Bait and Sunrise came into shelter late so I ended up not having the shelter to myself after all. They were quiet and apologized for waking me, so it was fine. I met Bug Bait at the hostel back in Palmerton and hadn’t seen her since then. 


Today was a really good day on the trail and it started almost immediately. I was first out of camp and there was a little climb after the shelter. I stopped at the top to adjust my trekking poles and was thinking that today might be a good day for wildlife. The trail was wet, dampening my footsteps, it wasn’t actively raining at the moment but the trees were still dripping, masking any sounds I might make, and there wasn’t any breeze to carry a scent very far. Literally as I was thinking this and standing still to get the trekking poles clicked into place, movement caught my eye, and a large adult bear glided silently across the trail, not 25 feet in front of me.  It didn’t even see me as it walked past. I waited motionless and when it ambled behind a hemlock tree I unzipped my waist pouch to get my phone out. As soon as it heard the zipper it stopped and looked back over its shoulder at me but stayed there long enough for me to get a picture. Then I reckoned I’d better help it decide what to do next so I yelled, “Good bear!” and waved my arms. Fortunately, it chose wisely and took off at a brisk trot, disappearing in a few seconds over the crest of the hill. I’m glad it chose that course of action. I would have pooped my pants if it had just kept standing there or had advanced on me. It was really, really cool, though, and kept me jazzed all morning. 


A few miles later at a road crossing there was a deli open for breakfast just a few yards off the trail. They call the NJ and NY portion of the AT “deli-blazing” because of the eateries located very near the trail. I stopped and grabbed a breakfast sandwich and some chocolate milk. They also had phone recharging station and a spigot to fill water bottles. Very nice people and a great sandwich. One hiker even packed out a sandwich for lunch and it was huge. That’s smart but it looked like it weighed about 5 pounds. 


Then a short distance later I saw a Moose. Not a literal moose but a figurative one. He’s a retired guy with the trail name Moose from years ago and he was set up with trail magic at a trailhead parking area. He even had a portable freezer with ice cream. I made myself a fruit salad out of cantaloupe, watermelon, pineapples, and honeydews. Then a Gatorade. Then an ice cream. He had a ton of other goodies as well. Moose said he’s been doing it for 4 years now and he does it every day the entire month of July! And he lives about an hour’s drive away. That’s a heckuva commitment to the hiker community. I took a photo of Moose and some hikers, thanked him, and moved on. 


Later in the day I crossed Sunrise Mountain. The view was nice but limited by the low scud clouds. It looked like it was going to dump rain at any moment. 


Which it promptly did. Along with thunder. And lightning. And wind. It was a stout little storm and before long the trail was a running creek on the uphill and downhill sections and ponded mud puddles on the flat sections. 


I got to one old shelter where a couple hikers were taking cover but I pressed on. The lightning wasn’t close enough and I wasn’t on an exposed ridge for it to be a concern. When I finally reached my destination shelter for the night, it was still raining but was winding down a bit. No one else was there so I set up my sleeping space in the shelter and prepared to cook dinner. Then Tagalong and Inchworm along with Peas and Carrots came in. I hadn’t met Peas and Carrots yet. We all cooked our suppers and Carrots told a really funny story about his marriage proposal to Peas. We all belly laughed it was so good. A while later he asked me how long I had been married and asked what advice I would give to a newlywed couple. I told him that I consciously try to make Janet laugh at least once a day. If you can genuinely laugh with your partner every day, you can get through most things life will throw at you. I could tell it was an unexpected answer to him but that he thought it was sound counsel. I think they’re getting off trail a few days for a friends wedding. I hope I see them again; they were enjoyable company.","Brink shelter
",Rutherford shelter,"Jul 02, Fri",15.10
‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640505,"I was the only person who overnighted in the shelter. Tagalong and Inchworm and Peas and Carrots all decided to tent. So I had the shelter to myself. Except for a few mice that kept running around and over me. And a few hundred mosquitoes. I had to  cinch the sleeping bag liner shut so that only my nose and mouth were exposed to keep the mosquitoes at bay. I had hoped that the wet, smelly socks, shoes, shirts, buffs, and everything else all of us had hung on every available nail, peg, and cobbled together clothesline in the shelter to dry out would help keep the bugs at bay. Maybe it did and I ended up with the bloodsuckers who are odor blind. I tell you though, stinky shoes, mice, and mosquitoes make for some really weird-ass dreams. 


It was drizzling when I got up but needed to put in some miles. About a mile into the hike it started pouring. Pouring. Rained really hard for about an hour. Even harder than yesterday. No lightning and thunder, just torrents of rain. 



There’s a state park headquarters right beside the trail a few miles in and I stopped there for water. Tagalong & Inchworm and Peas & Carrots also congregated there for water but they moved out pretty quick because P&C were meeting his father in Unionville to be off trail for a few days and T&I were trying to get to the Post Office in Unionville for a package before it closed.
It rained a bit more during the day but nothing as hard as this morning. Still, I was getting a bit down and looking forward to getting to Unionville. I was soaked, everything squished, my fingers and toes were all pruned up, and I was was starting to wonder what the symptoms of trench foot are. I needed a hot meal and a good drying out. Unionville had Annabel’s Pizza which, according to Guthook comments, although being a half mile off trail, was the best pizza on the AT. Motivation needs a goal and there it was. 


For the past few days the trail has been crossing a number of old stone walls. I’m always fascinated by them. What’s their story? Most of them are decades, maybe centuries, old and have large trees growing through them. They were probably built by hand before machines to help with such things were around. Unbelievably hard manual labor. Did they denote farm property lines? Township boundaries?  Keep cattle in?  Who built them?  Probably nobody in living memory knows these things but I wonder about each one I come to. 


Just before reaching Unionville I met a ridge runner who reminded me of the Wendy’s girl with her braided red hair. She was very nice, gave me some scoop about the trail ahead, emphasized that I need to hang my food bag or use the bear boxes, and just chatted in general. The ridge runners are ATC employees who are kinda the eyes and ears of the trail. They pick up trash, check on people, render first aid if needed, make note of any blow downs or other issues that will need a trail maintenance crew to address, educate the public about Leave No Trace principles, and a host of other things. I think they’re a critical component of the trail and I make sure to thank each one for their efforts whenever I run into one. 


When I got to Unionville I made a bee line for Annabel’s and got a couple of huge slices of pizza. It was very good and did a world of help for my spirits. I left Annabel’s and went to the nearby General Store to pick up a few supplies. Tagalong & Inchworm were there, along with an 18 year old named Guido, who just happens to be from Knoxville, TN. Technically he lives in Farragut but I’ll spot him that. T&I were talking about a hostel in town that wasn’t in the guidebook. They dug around a bit, figured out where it was, and invited me along to see if they had space. It’s associated with the town’s Presbyterian church and run by the minister and his wife in the basement of their home. They have space for four hikers and, behold, there were four of us. Jackpot!  Pizza, a shower, laundry, and a dry bed. It was great. The minister thru-hiked a few years ago and they’ve been helping hikers since then. He’s into woodworking and had some sizable black walnut logs he was milling into lumber. I think he was pleased that I was able to immediately identify the logs as black walnut. He also brought down glasses of sassafras beer (it’s not really beer, it’s like root beer) that he makes. It was very tasty. I may have to try my hand at making it some day. 



The others all went down to Annabel’s for supper but since I went earlier and was still kinda full, I decided to stay put, keep everyone’s laundry moving along, and kick my feet up. But Guido brought me back a couple slices from the large pizza he had ordered and couldn’t finish. He offered the remainder to the minister and his family. Very thoughtful young man.
So the day started out kinda yucky but ended on a high note.  That’s an on-going trail theme and I think there’s a lesson to be learned in it.","
","Unionville, NY","Jul 03, Sat",11.70
‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640507,"This was probably my best day yet on the trail. I hiked strong all day. I was the first one up and out of the hostel. This hostel is donation based so I dropped money into the donation box and slipped out. Stopped at the General Store long enough to order and wolf down a breakfast sandwich, then headed for the trail.
Much of the trail this morning was flat and well groomed through a nice farmland valley, even a good bit of road walking, but I could see the green wall of a mountain coming up and knew I’d have a steep climb shortly.


Before I got there, though, a homeowner had placed a cooler full of drinks out in the yard beside the road for hikers. I thought it might be wise to fully hydrate so I drank a bottle of water. Two hikers I hadn’t met walked up a few moments later, Hollywood and Buc-ee. We hiked the rest of the way through the valley together and had a fun chat. They’re both ex-Navy and both have lived in TX. Buc-ee still lives in San Antonio. Hollywood was in a video made by the BBC when he was in Afghanistan. In the valley I could easily keep pace with them but when we got to the climb they gradually pulled away. 


After a few miles the trail descended to a park with an extensive boardwalk over a marshland. The trail followed the boardwalk for a long way, maybe a couple miles. It was really neat and a welcome change of pace from the usual look of the trail. It being a weekend and a holiday, there were a gazillion day hikers out, which is great. As I’ve said before, I believe the more people value something the more they want to protect it. And the best way to value a trail is to use it and be exposed to it. 


The park, and boardwalk, ended at the NJ 94 road crossing with a large parking area full of cars but also a guy with a hot dog stand. I got a ‘dog with brown mustard and spicy onions and a birch beer. It was excellent. The guy running it, Mitch, saw Jerry Garcia and The Grateful Dead in 1973. Then I walked across the road to the Heaven Hill Farm and got a double scoop of local ice cream. 


Tanked up, I headed on and proceeded to climb what is known as the Stairway to Heaven. Heckuva climb and there were so many day hikers it seemed like a conga line. But the higher I got the more the line thinned out. Had about a half dozen people ask me on the way up if I was hiking the entire trail. 


After the AT peeled off at the top, I once again had the trail to myself all the way to the Warwick Turnpike. There I needed to catch a ride into Warwick. I stuck out my thumb and, after about half a dozen cars passed by, an Audi pulls over, a red headed woman opens the passenger door and tells me to hop in. Her name was Erin and her husband, Rainer, was driving. He’s German but they live in NJ and were nice as could be. They dropped me at the drive-in theatre but offered to go get food for me and asked if there was anything I needed that they could help with. They were incredible and I would have enjoyed talking to them for hours. But I climbed out, offered them some money for the ride, which they steadfastly refused, and they went about their day. Thank you, Erin and Rainer, for my first successful hitchhike. 



The Warwick Drive-In Theatre has a fascinating bit going. Thru-hikers can camp there for free and watch the movies. The tenting area is on a grassy knoll above where the cars park for the movie. They have a line of port-a-potties (clean ones, too). Hikers can also recharge electronics, and fill water bottles. Sweet!
I was one of the earliest to arrive but by showtime, I counted 22 tents or hammocks there. Some of the hikers are way ahead of me, some are way behind me, but we all made it there to enjoy a very unique July 4th holiday. 


Across the street is a cidery and a Biergarten so I headed over there for supper. They also had live entertainment. I ordered a salmon burger and a cider and then a group seated at one of the high top tables invited me over. It was Wilma, Gary, Sue, and Leslie. First they were fascinated by the kilt and asked where I marched today. When I told them today I marched from Unionville to here, they were puzzled so I explained about the trail. Then they were doubly fascinated. We had a long and really funny conversation, then Tagalong and Inchworm hollered at me so I waved them over and it got even more animated. They were so dang engaging, especially Wilma, we almost missed showtime. We got the bartender to take a couple of quick pics of the group and then had to take our leave. 


We hustled back to the drive-in, I bought a bag of popcorn and a coke, and laid down in front of my tent to watch the movie. 


The first movie is The Purge (there’s three screens but that one is closest and I can hear it best). It’s dreadful. I’m more interested in the second feature, The Hitman’s Wife’s Bodyguard. It’s got Salma Hayek in it. Need I say more? But I doubt I’ll make it that long. I already feel sleep starting to take me. But it has been a great day, even if I miss Salma.","Unionville, NY
",Warwick Turnpike road crossing,"Jul 04, Sun",16.80
‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640842,"Sure enough, fell into a fitful sleep before the second movie started last night. None of the movies were exactly Oscar nomination material. In fact, they were downright bad. But it was still a cool experience. 


After I woke up, I walked down to the nearby grocery store to get water since I was completely out and there were several miles till the next water source. When I got back with the water, Buc-ee had arranged a shuttle to take us back to the trailhead, which was great, but she was already there waiting on us, which was not great. I had to to fill my water bottles, take down my tent, and pack everything up lickety-split. That’s how things get left behind or lost - when your routine is interrupted or rushed. But I think I was lucky and didn’t overlook anything, although I had to repack and balance my pack a couple miles down the trail. The shuttle driver was an elderly lady who looked like Aunt Edna from “Christmas Vacation”. But she was very nice. I apologized profusely for her having to wait on me and she said, “It was worth it just to hear your accent, sweetie.”


Much of the hike today was on granite outcroppings on ridge tops. This is different than the PA rocks, though. These are huge continuous slabs of rock that you walk on or hop to the next one, not the jumbled chaotic rocks of PA. But the challenge was getting up onto the granite outcropping. In many places it was a hand over hand, find a toe hold, and pull myself up climb. In one place, someone in years gone by had drilled and cemented large rebar rungs into the cliff face and I had to climb it like an outdoor obstacle course ladder. It was actually pretty cool, but exhausting after while. And it’s getting really hot again. 


About 5 miles or so into the day, I left New Jersey and am now in New York. For a number of miles the trail has kinda followed the border, weaving in and out of both states. But today’s border crossing was the last one - New Jersey is now in the rear view mirror. 


If someone asked me to do a word association relative to the AT and said “New Jersey”, my response would be, “Surprised”.  NJ has been quite beautiful. Great overlooks and vistas, more wildlife, great food, the people have all been incredibly kind and generous, not the stereotypical abrasive NJ personality at all, and even the rocks have seemed friendlier. I would section hike NJ again, for sure. 


Yesterday a guy on the boardwalk part of the hike told me to be sure and visit the Bellvale Farm ice cream store after I crossed into New York and to get the banana split. He said it was the best ice cream he’d ever had. So, today at about the 10 mile point, the trail crosses the road with the creamery a short walk up the road. It was a neat place. They had a beautiful overlook and big shade trees for stinky hikers to sit under, and even water spigot and recharging outlets specifically labeled for hikers to use. For the ice cream, there are 4 windows you order from and a winding queue like you see for a Six Flags ride. And the line backed up into the parking area. I’m sure some of it was because today is the observed July 4 holiday, but it’s apparent the place is popular. It kinda reminds me of Mayfields back home; a local dairy that made excellent ice cream and became exceedingly popular because of it. I ordered the banana split: a scoop of butter pecan, a scoop of crunchy salted caramel, and a scoop of Bellvale Bog, a dark chocolate specialty. With a banana, and covered with maple walnuts, crushed pineapple, strawberries, whip cream, and cherries. It was decadent. And about three times what I would normally eat. But God hates a quitter so I persevered and polished it off. 


After the banana split, I filled my water bottles because there’s no water source at the shelter I’m aiming for, and headed out for the last few miles of the day. 


About a mile later, the trail decided to throw one last rock scramble climb of the day in. Except this granite outcropping was covered with a large gaggle of teenage girls. I heard them before I saw them. There must have been at least 30. They were sitting on the rocks and singing a variety of camp songs. Most of them had some sort of charcoal, Native American-ish striping on their faces. The apparent leader said it was a girls’ camp outing. They were all sitting in clusters of 3 or 4 in each of the best places to navigate the rocks so I had to thread my way around them along much more difficult routes. Additionally, they asked a hundred questions as I was working my way through them. It was hot, I was tired, it was physically demanding to get past them on the rocks, and suddenly the banana split was at the back of my throat. I managed to suppress it, but for a few moments I really thought I might urp banana split in front of them. I can’t even imagine what sort of trail name would be earned by such an incident. But I got past them and arrived at the shelter. I didn’t even pretend to cook dinner; my food bag went straight into the bear box and I’m lying on my air pad, slowly ruminating that banana split.","Warwick Turnpike road crossing
",Wildcat shelter,"Jul 05, Mon",11.70
‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640845,"Today was a tough day, mentally and physically. I’m trying to be conscientious about drinking plenty of fluids and electrolytes but when you’re doing a hard hike with a 25 pound backpack for 8 or so hours a day, there’s a heat advisory out because it’s so dang hot, and sweat is literally dripping from your elbows as you make one steep climb after another, it’s hard to keep up. Last night when I peed before flopping down in my tent, it looked more like Valvoline 30W motor oil than normal water. I told myself to be sure and drink more water today. I did. It didn’t help. 


I had planned on a 16 mile day but the trail here has gotten where it seems to run almost perpendicular to the ridge tops. And to get on top usually means facing a vertical rock scramble more like bouldering than hiking. I had to do it again and again and again today. Shortly after noon I started getting bad heat cramps. Then a pounding headache. Then I started feeling light-headed, which is a really bad way to be when navigating these rocks. I looked at the terrain profile on Guthook and saw that I had a long, steep descent coming up at Harriman State Park, a short hike across the valley, and then an even longer, steeper climb on the other side. I didn’t have it in me and felt it would be a very bad decision to try it. So, at the very top of the long descent I had a good cell signal so I sat down on a rock, drank some water and electrolytes, and found a motel a couple miles off trail along the road at the bottom of the hill. I called them up and they had a room, which I reserved. Relieved, I called a nearby taxi service, told them where I was, to give me 45 minutes to get to the bottom of the hill, and I’d be at the road crossing. They said they’d have somebody there. Excellent!  Things were looking up. 


I took another swig of water, got off the rock, and got underway. As promised by the Guthook app, the descent was long and steep. I was grateful I wasn’t a SOBO hiker having to make that climb; the descent was tough enough. But I made it down and just a few minutes later, Jimmy the taxi driver was there. Jimmy was a character. He’s from the Bronx and had an accent that was every bit as strong as my hillbilly accent. But he was a great guy, said he picks up hikers all the time, told me where I could get some Gatorade within an easy walk from the motel, and even offered to stop there first for me. We pulled up in front of the motel’s office, I unzipped my waist pack to get my wallet to pay Jimmy and...no wallet. 


I was embarrassed, panicked, and crestfallen, all at the same time. I emptied the waist pack on the back seat of the taxi to be sure it wasn’t in there, but I knew what I had done and where it was. When I sat down on the rock at the top to make the phone calls, I got the wallet out in case the motel needed a credit card to reserve the room, and set it down beside me. They didn’t ask for the card number and after I finished arranging the taxi ride, I got up and left it. I think loss of mental acuity is another symptom of heat exhaustion. Or I was just stupid. 


There was nothing to be done except go back for it. Jimmy was super nice and understanding. He took me back to the trailhead and gave me encouragement, “Your wallet is going to be there. Just take your time and be careful. When you find it, give us a call and I’ll come back and get you.”  He could have been a horse’s ass about it, and justifiably so, but he was compassionate and encouraging. 


So, up the mountain I went, retracing my steps. I ditched my pack near the bottom, so I didn’t have to carry it up, but I still learned firsthand what that climb is like for the SOBO’s. With each step I cycled between being furious with myself, wondering if I’d be able to recognize the rock I sat down on, recalling the symptoms of heat stroke, worrying that some good-intentioned person had already found the wallet and it was being transported elsewhere, or that some bad-intentioned person had found it, pocketed the contents and I’d have to deal with those consequences. 


I got to the top, recognized my sitting rock, and there was the wallet, lying just where I’d set it down. Raw, heartfelt, bottom of the soul relief is an under appreciated emotion. Of course, you’ve got to first go through one of Dante’s inner circles of hell to get to that point, but it’s still an indescribable feeling. 


I called the taxi service back, specifically asked for Jimmy, and he was there for me when I got back down to the road. He took me to the motel, but only wanted to charge me for one trip. “I’m not going to charge a guy for losing his wallet. These things happen.”  But I insisted on paying him for both trips, plus a healthy tip. He earned it and it would be very bad karma to shortchange a godsend. 


So now I’m flopped down on a bed at the Tuxedo Motel, downed about a gallon of Gatorade, took a cold shower, and I still feel like I’ve been sortin’ wildcats in a burning barn. It’s supposed to be another scorcher tomorrow. I may have to take a zero tomorrow to get back to a good baseline.","Wildcat shelter
",NY 17 road crossing,"Jul 06, Tue",9.90
‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640863,"Feeling much better today. I was really feeling out of sorts yesterday in the heat. I’m glad I decided to take a zero today and recuperate, especially since today is just as hot as yesterday. I’ve focused on drinking lots of water and electrolytes and eating some real, perishable foods. 


Since I don’t have anything to report about the trail today, maybe I should talk about the fine dining of non-perishable foods I enjoy, I mean consume, on the trail. 


Breakfast usually consists of a Clif bar or some type of protein bar. I try to get something with nuts and whole grains in it. I’ve also done tortillas spread with peanut or almond butter. It’s OK but I have to measure myself with peanut butter; I get tired of it quickly. I’ve also done bagels. They take up a lot of room in the food bag so I squish them as flat as I can, stuff them into individual zip locks and squeeze all the air out. They’re pretty good and will last for 3 or 4 days. After that, they’re pretty good frisbees or, if attacked by a bear, a ninja hiker throwing star. Some hikers cook breakfast, usually instant oatmeal or grits, but I don’t want to mess with the stove and spend time cooking. I prefer to just pack up and get going. In fact I usually don’t eat breakfast until a couple miles down the trail, whenever I find a nice view or creek or something to eat breakfast by. 


At the beginning of the day, I decide what I want to have for lunch, pull it out of my food bag, and put it in my waist pack. That’s so I don’t have to go digging in my pack at lunch time. The food bag is fairly heavy, so it goes down low in the pack and as close to my back as I can get it. My cook kit and tent live on top of the food bag in the pack, so if I didn’t use the waist pack, I’d have to do some serious unpacking and repacking at lunch in order to drag the food bag out. 


My favorite lunch is a Slim Jim or something comparable, cheese stick, and mustard tortilla wrap. If I haven’t been able to pirate some mustard packs at a fast food place somewhere, sans mustard is OK. If the last resupply didn’t have tortillas, or if I didn’t want to buy a pack of 20 in order to use only 3, I’ll settle for just the Slim Jim and cheese stick. To accompany the wrap, I’ll sometimes have some sort of crackers. Wheat Thins seem to do pretty well taste wise and they don’t crunch up into dust as I walk. I’ll also usually have some sort of trail mix snack that has nuts, usually peanuts, and dried fruit, usually raisins, in it. 


At supper I usually cook since I’ve unpacked my pack anyway and set my tent up. If I’m splurging, which means the last resupply stop carried them, I’ll have a backpacker’s freeze dried meal, usually Mountain House brand. Some of these are pretty good and they’re easy because they cook in their own pouch; just pour some boiling water in, stir, and let it reconstitute. If I don’t have a freeze dried meal, I usually eat some flavor of Knorr rice sides or Idahoan instant potatoes. I vary the flavors up. I cook those up in a quart size freezer zip lock bag and let it sit in my homemade pot cozy until it’s rehydrated, then I mix in a pack of tuna or chicken. The tuna and chicken packets also come in a variety of flavors and I just kinda do a mix and match. Let it cool a bit, get out my long-handled spoon, and dig in. That’s usually it for supper. A lot of hikers cook ramen for supper and then add tuna or chicken. I’ve never cared much for ramen but I can tell that I’m getting to the point of giving it a shot. 


During the day I may also munch on some snacks to keep the energy level up. Again, those are placed in my waist pack before I start hiking so I don’t have to rummage through my pack if I want a snack. The snacks may really vary. Could be anything from cookies to dried fruit. Just depends on what caught my eye at the resupply. 


That’s a pretty typical day of fuel for the trail. Now I’ve got to go organize my food bag and get ready for tomorrow. Feeling better and it’s going to be a bit cooler so I need to earn some miles.","NY 17 road crossing

‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640911,"I scheduled an early morning pick up at the motel with the taxi service last night and when I walked out to catch my ride, there was Jimmy!  So it was already an auspicious start to the day.


Jimmy dropped me off at the trailhead and, as expected, a steep climb out of the valley ensued. Before long, I came to the Lemon Squeezer, a spot where the trail goes fairly steeply uphill between two big granite formations with a narrow crack between them. The crack is about chest high when you’re in it and gets narrower toward the top. I walked until I wouldn’t fit, then took off my pack, turned sideways, and drug my pack along behind me as I inched forward and upward. After a few feet of that, the gap got even narrower and my pack wouldn’t fit. So I had to lift it over my head and carry it that way for the last little bit. Immediately after the Lemon Squeezer there was a sheer rock face with no discernible way up except pulling yourself up with your hands like free form bouldering. I knew it would be difficult regardless, but having a pack on would be more difficult and outright dangerous. I started to take my pack off to get out the food bag hanging rope so I could tie it to my pack, make the climb, and then pull the pack up behind me. Then I noticed a little trail leading off to the side. Behold, there was a way around it. It was still a  tough climb, but much more manageable. Whew, what a morning!


When I started out this morning, I thought I might go all the way to Fort Montgomery and get a room because it’s supposed to thunderstorm all night. Evidently there’s a tropical cyclone that’s dumping rain over the entire area. But there weren’t any vacancies I could find so I had to stick with the original plan and spend the night at West Mountain shelter. 


Before I got there, I stopped for a break at the William Brien Memorial shelter. For sure I didn’t want to spend the night there. Recent comments from other hikers talked about the rattlesnake that lives under the floor. Hard pass. 


As the afternoon wore on, I could tell weather was definitely brewing. I checked a weather app and a supercell thunderstorm was headed my way so I decided to hustle to get off the ridge. I managed to get off the ridge but the storm caught me a couple miles from the shelter and soaked me. 



There was one section hiker here at the shelter with me but after awhile a rabbi and his daughter showed up. They’re trying to do the New York section of the AT before she has to start school. They’re hanging in there but they talked about how much harder it was than they imagined it would be. They didn’t complain or whine but I could tell they’re struggling a bit. Their feet are in pretty bad shape and I gave them some leukotape and showed them how to use it to help with blisters and also offered some Body Glide to help with chafing and hot spots. I was really touched by how he was watching out for her but also directly involving her in everything so she would learn and grow from the experience. Caring but not coddling. Soliciting her input rather than just telling her. Guiding rather than directing. I was fascinated observing him. Maybe the training of his profession helped, but I sense that he’s a really good father. I hope they complete their section; they’ll have a bonding experience and memories never to forget.
This shelter is an old stone CCC structure. It supposedly has a great view and you can see the NYC skyline from it. Not today. I can’t see 100 yards with the rain and fog. It’s raining cats and dogs and in the brief lulls it’s fog so thick you could poke a hole in it. Hearing the steady patter on the roof does make me sleepy though.","NY 17 road crossing
",West Mountain shelter,"Jul 08, Thu",13.30
‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640912,"It rained all night. I much prefer to tent than sleep in the shelter but I was glad I chose the shelter last night. 


I usually wake up around 5:00 a.m. That’s when it starts getting light enough to see and the birds start welcoming the day. Out here, it’s just as effective as an alarm clock for me. My internal clock woke me up at about that time but it was still dark and no bird song. Just rain. I lay there not wanting to put on wet clothes, wet socks, wet shoes, pack up a wet pack, and walk in the rain. I waited to see if anyone else would start stirring. Nobody did and I drifted back to sleep.


A couple hours later and still nobody was eager to launch the day but I knew I had miles to earn. The rain didn’t show any sign of letting up so I reckoned I should just cowboy up and get on with it.  Still lying down, I reached around and opened the valve on my sleeping pad. When the air finishes whistling out, it always forces me to get up because lying there on the hard ground or floor is just too dang uncomfortable. I started stuffing my down quilt into its stuff sack and then felt it - wet. In several places the incessant rain had seeped through the cracks and crevices of the old stone walls of the shelter and my quilt happened to be touching the wall at one of those locations and had steadily wicked up the water. Fortunately it’s summer or that could be really bad. Down is a superb insulator - unless it’s wet. Then it’s nearly useless. Also fortunately, not a lot of the quilt got wet. Still, I’ll need to somehow dry and refluff it. 


Getting a much later start than usual, I set off in the rain. A couple hours later it finally stopped raining for a while. As I crested a little rise in the trail, I came across a thru-hiker couple a couple feet off the trail putting on dry clothes. They were smack dab in the middle of the process - wet clothes were off, dry clothes not yet on. One of the things you learn early on out here is that modesty thresholds are considerably lowered over normal civilian life. I just said, “I’m sorry, excuse me, I’ll just pass on by.”  Mr. Shriveled and Ms. Pruney (not their real trail names but appropriate for this telling) just turned away from me, I diligently averted my eyes to the other side of the trail, and hiked right on by. Even in a shelter, if someone needs to change, especially if it’s a woman, just turn your back or step around to the side of the shelter, and give them a little space. As long as you’re polite and courteous and not being a creep or a jerk, everybody makes it work out OK. 


I had a long climb up Bear Mountain but the trail started being much more manicured, made of crushed gravel and with stone blocks cut and positioned into nice, even steps. I hardly knew what to do with myself it was such a nice trail. It was the state park and people can drive to the summit for the view. Of course, I had to hike there but it made the view that much sweeter. The earlier rain had knocked all the dust and haze out of the air and there on the horizon, clear as a bell, was the New York City skyline. It was waaay cool. 



Then a long descent down Bear Mountain and into a park and picnic area where I stopped for lunch. It was nearly deserted with the rains keeping people away. The trail then goes through the Bear Mountain zoo. I’m torn on the issue of zoos. On the one hand, I think they can have an invaluable educational and exposure to nature benefit. At the same time, it kinda erodes my soul to see animals caged up. To be fair, my understanding is that the animals in this zoo are rescues that cannot be released into the wild. Still, I wish their artificial habitat was a bit more natural and appealing.
After the zoo, I had to cross the Hudson River. Fortunately there’s a nice long bridge and I didn’t have to blow up my air mattress and paddle myself and my belongings to the far side. This is actually the lowest elevation of the entire trail. I believe I read 160 feet ASL somewhere and 126 feet somewhere else. Whatever the actual number, this is where the trail bottoms out. Now all I have to do is climb 5,267 feet to be at Mt. Katahdin. Ahhh, if only it were that simple. 


After the river crossing, I had a big climb on the other side. A few miles later the trail came to a road crossing with the Appalachian Market and Deli right beside it. I stopped in and got some supplies and a hero sandwich that was huge and excellent. 


A mile or so past the deli, I reached my destination for the night. About a half mile off trail, the Franciscans have a large spiritual center where they let hikers camp at the pavilion next to the ball field. The pavilion isn’t large but it’s got a roof, some tables, and enough space for several people to sleep. It’s also got an outlet for charging electronics, an outdoor shower (cold water only though), a spigot, and a couple portapotties. When I arrived, one guy had a hammock set up between two support columns at the pavilion and another was set up on the floor of the pavilion. A few more arrived later and are tenting nearby. I think I’m going to cowboy camp on top of one of the picnic tables under the pavilion. Now I just hope I don’t roll off the table in the middle of the night.","West Mountain shelter

‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640913,"The mosquitoes defeated all us intrepid souls who tried to cowboy camp under the pavilion. They were merciless, biting me through my sleeping bag liner and sleep clothes. I tried draping the down quilt (which dried out nicely yesterday afternoon) over me but it was so warm I was soon sweating profusely. In addition, it just made the mosquitoes concentrate on my exposed face. I could tell the other two were suffering equally but it was after hiker midnight and nobody wanted to disturb the others tenting around us. Finally, the section hiker capitulated. I saw his headlamp come on and heard him start assembling his tent. In an instant, all three of us were up, scrambling to set up our tents in the dark, hiker midnight be damned. I got mine set up in record time, killed several of the enemy’s Air Force in a token show of defiance, ran around executing some evasive maneuvers to throw off the pursuers, and dove into the tent. After all that, I actually slept very well last night.
Got up early and was one of the first out. The mosquitoes are apparently an after sundown variety because they didn’t bother me at all this morning. 


A few miles into the hike, the trail passes by some stone ruins with a plaque. Seems this was a farm and the ruins of a barn foundation where George Washington had his men inoculated following a smallpox outbreak in 1776. Very cool. The plaque didn’t say what they were inoculated with. Since the smallpox vaccine wasn’t discovered until 1796, I probably don’t want to know. Could have been most anything. Turpentine. Possum slobber. Arsenic. Who knows. Still very cool history, though. 


A couple miles later trail magic was set up at a trailhead parking area.  Cantaloupe, grapes, cookies, brownies, drinks. I was enjoying some cantaloupe when several people got out instruments - a couple guitars, a fiddle, and a banjo - and an impromptu bluegrass jam broke out. One of the players was a hiker, Ketchup. He’s a professional musician and is hiking with a composite guitar to withstand the rain and moisture. It was really cool. Peacefoot, who I met last night, turned to me while they were playing and delivered this sage advice, “Never pass these moments up. Don’t lose yourself in simply making miles. The trail is the goal and it will always be there waiting. But moments like this are the journey and they won’t wait.”  He’s right. 


After enjoying the jam session I set out again and came to a curious bulletin board looking structure with an old wall phone mounted to it. It was called the Telephone of the Wind. The notice above it simply said, “This Telephone of the Wind is for all who grieve. You are welcome to find solace here. Please use it to connect to those you have lost. To feel the comfort of their memory. May you hear their voices in the wind. May you be at peace with your losses.” I picked up the handset and placed calls to my grandparents, my mother and father in law, and my step dad. It sounds ridiculous but I stood there in the middle of nowhere on the Appalachian Trail with an unconnected phone to my ear and had a conversation with each of them. Yet, it was an unbelievably powerful and emotional experience. 


The hike today was marvelous. Weather was beautiful, views were gorgeous, and even the trail seems a tad more docile. I spent most of the day leapfrogging with Shire, Peacefoot, and The Dude. They tented at the Franciscan pavilion last night but I hadn’t met them previously. They’re hikers with a bit more seasoning on them. I think I’m still older than all of them but they’re much closer to my demographic than most of the hikers I encounter. They seem like good people and we’re spending the night here at the Shenandoah tent site. Looks like a great place to camp.","Franciscan Way

‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640915,"Not much remarkable today other than crunching out miles. I did pass Nuclear Lake, which was quite beautiful and didn’t glow at all. Still, I avoided collecting water from the lake’s outfall. Maybe it would give me some sort of superpower but I chose to err on the side of caution. Insight and Care Bear said they drank from it last year before they knew it was called Nuclear Lake. I need to do a little research and see what the scoop is about this place. I mean, Chernobyl and Three Mile Island at least have imaginative names, but Nuclear Lake?


The plan was to stop at the Telephone Pioneers shelter, which would make it an 18 mile day. It started raining once again about a mile from the shelter. When I got to the shelter, however, the tent sites were really bad and the mosquitoes had established a blood-sucking gauntlet inside the shelter. Shire, Peacefoot, and The Dude had arrived shortly before me and decided to press on to find a suitable stealth camp site. They did such a stellar job last night at picking a great tenting spot, I decided to cast my lot with them and we moved on. Bad idea on my part. A very steep and long decent, then when we got to the valley, it was a terrible marshy, boggy area all the way across the valley floor. When we got to the other side of the valley and it looked like we’d be facing a steep climb with still no prospective camp sites to be seen, I bailed out. Set up my tent in a little grassy, weedy wide spot right beside the trail. And I mean right beside it. Best I could do under the circumstances. This was my longest day, by far, and follows a long day yesterday. The gas tank is empty.","Shenandoah tent site
",Stealth camp site,"Jul 11, Sun",19.40
‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640917,"When I woke up, a tent stake had pulled loose in the saturated ground and one side of the tent had almost collapsed in on me. My biggest concern, however, was that the tent stake was lost somewhere in the tall weeds and I wouldn’t be able to find it. But I did, so all stakes still present, accounted for, and reporting for duty. 


But then I noticed, ummm, “things” on the tent. They were some kind of brown slug an inch or two long and a dozen or so had crawled all over my tent, I guess because of the rain. They were fairly well glued on and wouldn’t shake off, so I had to inspect the tent carefully and pick those little suckers off by hand before I packed it up. Yuck. 


Now let’s talk breakfast. At the first road crossing, I did about a half mile road walk detour to Tony’s Deli. They had a hiker menu and I ordered the Appalachian omelette:  4 eggs, ham, chicken cutlet, red peppers, porcini peppers, and American cheese. Yum!  A fried apple pie, a bottle of tea, and a liter bottle of Powerade rounded out breakfast. Tony even let me refill my water bottles. It was worth the road walk. It started raining again as I was walking back to the trailhead but the worst part was the spray kicked up by the big trucks zooming by. The road had a wide shoulder but not wide enough to avoid the truck spray. While walking back, I saw Wheels, Engine, and Tucker, their golden retriever. Tucker has hiked all the way from Georgia with them, except for the Smokies where dogs are not permitted on the trail. They were on their way to the deli and asked for an intel report. 


The ATC should post an immediate announcement: “Help wanted!  Trail maintainers needed for the northern 20 miles of the AT in New York.” The trail was awful. In the lower elevations, it was completely overgrown with weeds. Weeds taller than I am and so thick you sometimes couldn’t make out the trail. It was like the jungles of Panama or something. There were also at least a dozen large blow downs - big trees that have fallen across the trail. Many of them were too low to go under with a pack on and too tall to step or straddle across. The only thing to do was pick my way around. And a lot of them were in soupy, muddy, boggy areas made doubly so from the recent rains. I know thru-hikers are expected to be resourceful but most of us didn’t include a chainsaw and weed eater on our gear list. 


If it weren’t for that, however, the day’s hike was nice. The rain tapered off and the temperature was moderate and the terrain not too terribly difficult. I got to the shelter before I thought I would but the next one is too far and after yesterday’s high mileage day I decided to tent here for the night. It’s an interesting shelter. There an open space of 3 feet or so between the edge of the built up sleeping platform and the stacked logs comprising the front of the shelter. You have to walk a little plank across the space to get in or out. I can’t figure out what it’s for. Road Soda called it a bear moat, which is pretty dang funny. 


Speaking of Road Soda, waaaay back in Maryland I heard some people talking about an Instagram account called “Feet of the AT”. I don’t have an Instagram account but apparently you most likely don’t want to see this site. People send in photos of their hideously abused AT feet. Anyway, during our conversation, Road Soda lamented the condition of his feet lately and I mentioned that I had heard about some sort of Feet of the AT site and he should submit his feet. Road Soda piped up and said, that’s my site. I created that site. Amazing, but I still don’t want to peruse those pics.


Also in big news today, I’m now in Connecticut. I’ve finished with New York. I actually loved New York. I seemed to only have a choice of pouring rain or blistering heat all through the state, but that’s just the weather and could happen in any state. The trail itself was really great in NY (except the bit about maintainers needed the last 20 miles), the views were excellent, the terrain was challenging but fun, and the people were all very nice. Plus, deli-blazing!  Yum.","Stealth camp site

‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640919,"The first part of the hike today was downstream along Ten Mile River, then at the conjunction with the Housatonic River, upstream along the banks of the Housatonic. I’ve heard the Housatonic is a decent whitewater boating river but with all the recent rains, wow, it was roaring. I mean like the Gauley at full throttle. I’ve always loved and been fascinated by rivers and did a fair amount of whitewater kayaking in my 20s and 30s, so I absolutely loved the hike along the river.
After the trail left the river, there was a short road walk and up ahead where the trail left the road and started climbing the mountain, I could see a truck with a couple  standing around. As I got closer, the woman asked if I was a thru-hiker and if I wanted a snack. It seemed an odd place for trail magic and the guy was putting on boots and gaiters. I figured maybe they were day hikers but it still seemed out of context. As I was eating the banana she offered, I made a few queries and finally put together what was going on. It was Pops365 and Daisy’s Mom. They’re retired and he’s doing a supported flip-flop thru-hike. By supported, what I mean is that they have a 27-foot camper trailer they park at a campground and then she shuttles him to/from trailheads where he slackpacks. They do this for a few days or a week or so and when the shuttle distances get to cumbersome, they hook up the trailer and move it to another campground further up the trail. It’s a clever strategy and one I wish I had looked into more. Slackpacking every day and sleeping in a dry bed with a hot meal and shower every night sounds pretty dang good. I thought about asking if they could adopt me for a few months. And Daisy is their 27-foot Great Dane. She was a sweetheart though and I made instant friends with her through a nice ear scratch and massage session. 


I left them but Pops365 wasn’t far behind and soon overtook me on the first big climb of the day. We had a similar pace, though, and kept seeing each other throughout the day. The hike was a lot of ups and downs but nothing too serious. Parts of the trail were quite muddy, though, and some of the rocks were deceptively slick from the rain and mud so still had to be mindful of footing. 


I had already planned to nero, stopping at the CT 341 road crossing, and go into Kent, CT for the hiker trifecta: shower, laundry, and resupply. I had a room and was even considering a zero. Pops365 was planning to go into Kent to check on some new footwear.  When we got to the road crossing, Daisy’s Mom was there with the truck, waiting. They offered me a ride, which I gratefully accepted, and I hopped into the bed of their pickup. They dropped me at the doorstep of my lodging for the night. I hope I run into them again, not to mooch rides, but because they seemed really neat and interesting people.","Ten Mile River shelter

I take notes every day on my hike but they’re just brief bullet points about something I saw or someone I met or some trail experience I had. Really they’re just reminders and memory joggers for me. 


For anyone reading my journal, you’ve probably noticed I don’t post just bullet points. I look at the day’s notes and then attempt to weave them into a narrative I will cherish in my later years and anyone reading it will enjoy. 


As you can imagine, that wordsmithing is quite time consuming and is even more laborious having to do it on a tiny phone screen. Early in the hike when I was doing low miles each day, I was better able to keep up with the journaling because I’d get to camp early and have enough time and energy to craft the day’s journal entry. I usually couldn’t post it unless I had wi-fi for uploading it, but at least I had the journal entries ready to go. 


Now that I’m doing bigger miles, however, I get to my destination later in the day and by the time I’ve set up my tent, cooked supper, and formulated a plan for tomorrow, I pretty much don’t want to do anything except climb into my sleeping bag and sleep the sleep of the truly exhausted. 


So, on zero days, I try to catch up on my journaling. I hope I can continue the in depth journaling. I enjoy it but it comes at a price. We’ll see how it goes. In any event, Kent is a bit pricey and toney, but it’s a good place to zero and get caught up.","Kent, CT

‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641220,"I had a mile or so road walk from Kent back to the trailhead and started out early-thirty. I had only walked a couple blocks when a car pulled over and Bill, a trail maintainer, gave me a ride to the trailhead. He was on his way to scout and work on the portion of trail north of the next road crossing but went out of his way to drop me at my starting point first. He said there were reports of blow downs in the section I was going to hike and asked me to document them and give him the info when I caught up to him after the next road crossing. He needs that info in order to coordinate a maintenance effort to clear the trail. Without some detailed info, he doesn’t know whether he needs to bring a handsaw or a chainsaw, tackle it himself or round up a crew of other maintainers to help, or even where best to access the trail from. It would suck to lug a chainsaw and fuel for 5 miles along a section of trail, only to find out the reported blowdown was only a quarter mile from the next road crossing up. Anyway, I was happy to help him out. There were several blow downs and I took pics of each one and recorded the mile marker it was located at. After a couple hours, I caught up with Bill and gave him the info. He was very appreciative and we ended up hiking together and chatting for a couple miles. Bill is older than I am but looks fit as a fiddle and I could tell he was passionate about maintaining his assigned section of trail. He told me all about crosscut saws vs chainsaws, erosion breaks, steps, relocations, etc. that they had done or were planning. It was refreshing to hear a perspective about the trail other than that of just another user. Bill had a New Englander’s pragmatism about him but his enthusiasm and passion were clear. I would have loved to talk with him for hours. Just before his turnaround point, he said, “Let me show you something,” and we went off trail a little ways. He pointed down the very steep hillside to a row of rocky ledges and said, “That’s where the trail was in the 1950’s.”  It was really cool seeing it. Without Bill I’d have never suspected; there wasn’t the least bit of evidence, at least to my eye, that the trail was once there. Somewhere I read that something like 98 per cent of the trail has been relocated at one point or another. When I relayed that info to Bill, he said he didn’t doubt it in the least.


Up until today, I’ve never had to ford a creek. There’s always been a footbridge or a log or I could rock hop across each stream. But today I had to ford two creeks.   Under normal flow I could see where you could rock hop across them. Not now. The rains have put those rocks underwater. So, I shimmied out of my hiking shoes and socks, put my camp shoes on (they’re actually water shoes anyway), and waded across. On the other side, I reversed the process and resumed hiking. The cold mountain stream actually felt pretty good on my feet. If I’d had a lawn chair to sit down in, I might be out there yet, middle of the creek, dangling my feet in the cold water.


When I got to my destination for the night, there was Tagalong at the shelter. He said Inchworm had gotten off trail for a few days but would probably rejoin him in Massachusetts. I had already set up my tent and needed water to cook supper, so I headed down the side trail to the water source. When I got back, Tagalong told me I missed all the excitement. A bear had shown up over next to my tent but several hikers started yelling at it and it ran off. Hope I don’t wake up tonight to find him back and nosing around me.

‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641461,"Much of the morning was a ridge walk with beautiful weather. Very enjoyable. I did come to one of the worst kind of blow downs: a large tree had recently fallen across the trail and the trunk was too high off the ground to straddle or climb over but too low to duck down and walk under. There was no easy way around it either, with a creek on one side and thick underbrush on the other. So I got down on my hands and knees and tried to crawl under it. The pack still got hung up on the tree trunk. OK. I didn’t want to completely belly crawl like a Marine Corps obstacle course so I took off the pack, pushed it under the tree ahead of me, and crawled under behind it. Victory!


About 7 miles in the trail descended to Falls Village, CT, where the guide said there was a nice cafe just off the trail. I walked to it and every other hiker from the shelter last night seemed to have the same idea. I had some iced tea, omigosh it was great, and the Johnny Cash skillet. I wanted to stop for the day right there but knew I couldn’t. 


On the north end of Falls Village the trail parallels, then crosses, then parallels again the Housatonic River until it comes to the Great Falls. Holy cow! With all the rain, it was roaring. The closest thing I could think of was maybe Cumberland Falls in KY at a strong flow. It was incredible. I took a couple of blue blaze trails down to get better views of it. Wow. 



The trail left the river and climbed back up the mountain. Later in the afternoon it started thundering again. I thought I was going to get soaked once more but it skirted me.
When I arrived in Salisbury, CT, my destination for the night, I stopped at a market and got a sandwich. As I was eating it at a table outside the market, a hiker I saw at the cafe this morning showed up and I invited him over. His name is Not Weird and he’s a professional stand-up comic in NYC. Young guy, he’s still building his career. He took 11 days off trail and went into New York and did several shows while he was there. I’ve never met a stand-up comic before and I asked a hundred questions about it. Really, really fascinating. And he was a dang funny guy with a quick wit. He’s hiking far faster than I am so I don’t know if I’ll see him again but I hope I get to catch one of his shows someday. 


I booked a space at a hostel in town. It’s run by Maria out of her home and is basically a guest bedroom with a shared bathroom. I fell in love with Maria almost the minute I met her. She’s 92 years old and still operating a hostel for guests. I sat in her living room with her for most of the evening talking. Such an incredible, well-lived life. She was born in the Dolomites in Italy, lived through WWII, and immigrated to America a couple years after the war. I feel the details of her story are hers to tell but I was honored that she shared some of them with me. Truly an inspiring woman. I felt so fortunate to have booked a stay at her place. One thing she said that was kinda funny was that I was one of the cleanest thru-hikers she’d ever seen. I didn’t tell her I stopped at a creek just outside of town and washed the mud off me with my bandana. I figured I’d let her remember me as the clean hiker who stayed at her place and not spoil the image.","Pine Brook Swamp shelter

I’d hear them for a few seconds and then as the trail twisted and turned I wouldn’t hear them. It kept on like this for awhile, hearing a brief snippet of conversation and laughter, then it fading away. They were like forest sirens, leading me deeper into the woods and keeping me from making my miles today. Then suddenly I found them relaxing on a large rock outcrop. It was four women from PA doing a section hike but it reminded me of the scene from “O Brother, Where Art Though?” A couple of them were tending to their feet and they were all snacking, taking a break, and talking about their trip. We chatted a bit and they said I was the cleanest thru-hiker they’d seen. That’s the second time in two days I’ve gotten that. After that climb I didn’t feel particularly clean but I’ll take it. As with Maria, I didn’t burst their illusion by telling them last night I stayed in a hostel and had a shower and shaved. I wished the sirens well on their section hike and pulled myself away from their call. 


Sages Ravine was beautiful and delightful.  I stopped for lunch beside the creek in the ravine and was mesmerized by the beauty. This is a place you don’t want to hike too fast through. Slow down and relish it. Where the trail leaves the ravine, I had to ford the creek, which had gotten fairly large by that point. I emerged on the other side and, presto, I was in Massachusetts. 


After the ravine, the trail began to climb in earnest and I realized how deceptive the ravine had been. It was deliciously cool walking alongside the creek but once I left it, whew, it got hot quick. 


After the tough climb up Mount Race, just past the summit, I rounded a turn in the trail and right there was a porcupine. I startled him as much as he did me but clearly his primary defense mechanism isn’t speed. He relies on his quills and his ability to climb because he waddled off the trail at about half the speed of smell and then climbed up a tree as far as he could get. I’ve only seen a porcupine once before and that was a roadkill out in far west Texas. I thoroughly enjoyed meeting Mr. Porcupine, from a prudent distance, of course. 


As the afternoon wore on, clouds started rolling in, then thunder and lightning. I was low on water so I stopped to get water from a stream on the side trail to the shelter, hoping it wouldn’t start raining until I got under the roof. The very minute I arrived at the shelter, the clouds opened up and it poured. And is still pouring. Quickly decided I’m going to sleep in the shelter tonight rather than tent. Obi and Winner from East TX are here along with Great Dane.


Another hiker is here, Geo (a different Geo than the one I met earlier). He is the first true SOBO I’ve met. And he’s rocking a kilt! He started at Katahdin on June 2, so he’s been really motoring. He’s doing a semi-supported hike with his wife following him and resupplying him whenever needed. It was fun to see a SOBO and get firsthand intel on the trail ahead. He said the mud is good preparation for Vermont. 


The shelter is nice. It has four bunks, two lower and two upper, along with a loft that can sleep four or so. You have to climb a ladder to get into the upper bunks and loft. The lower bunks were already spoken for and Obi and Winner are staying in the loft, so I’m in one of the upper bunks. That’s a first. I hope I don’t roll off.","Undermountain Road crossing

‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641475,"I believe “Massachusetts” must be an ancient Native American word meaning “Jumanji”. Because apparently one of my fellow hikers rolled “Deluge”. Every afternoon the skies have opened with a thunderstorm and downpour, followed by hours of steady drizzle. It rained all night last night and was still drizzling when I woke up. When I got on the trail, the trail itself was a mountain creek, running ankle deep for a mile or so. There was no walking to the side or stepping on rocks in a feeble attempt to keep my feet and shoes dry. I just had to plunge right in, splashing my way up the trail and not waste effort trying to avoid it. It really was like a mountain stream because it was also dang cold. After while my toes starting aching a bit from keeping them continuously immersed in the cold water.


After a mile or two, one of the other players must have rolled “Mud” because the trail turned into long muddy bogs. Again, there was no way around it. Nothing to do but wade through the mess and hope it didn’t keep one of my shoes. Where the mud happened to be slightly less watery, it was slick as glass. I thought sure I was going to end up wallowing in it before it was over. I somehow managed to stay upright although I nearly threw my back out making crazy windmilling gyrations trying to keep my balance a few times.


And then I guess I rolled “Mosquitoes” because suddenly they were on me. Swarming in my eyes, buzzing in my ears, and drilling every inch of exposed hide. I’ve never seen mosquitoes like that, even in places infamous for mosquitoes, like Florida or NC’s Outer Banks. I eventually had to stop, frantically swat at them with my cap to maintain a semblance of defense, fish out my vial of Picaradin, and quickly slather it on. I also dug out a bug net that fits over a cap and drapes over my head, face, and neck. I’ve carried that bug net for almost 500 miles and never used it. Thought about sending it home a half dozen times. The rule of thumb on the trail is that, except for your first aid and emergency items, if you don’t use something nearly every day, send it home or jettison it. But I hung on to that bug net ‘cause it weighs almost nothing. I’m certainly glad I had it today. I had to wear it for a couple miles or more. I have no idea why the mosquitoes were so bad in that one particular area but they were. Maybe it’s close to the Jumanji portal. 


The plan today was to nero into Great Barrington, MA for resupply, laundry, and a shower. The town is several miles off the trail. When I got to the road crossing, I saw two female hikers walking toward me but on the other side of the road. They had already been to town and were returning to the trail. I had my phone out and was checking to see if I could arrange an Uber into town when I heard one of them yell, “Hey, dude, you’ve got a ride!” I looked up and a guy in a blue pickup had pulled over and was motioning me to hop in the back. As I climbed aboard, the woman who alerted me yelled again, “I waited for 30 minutes for a hitch into town and you got one in 30 seconds. I’m pissed.”  It was funny. I hope I’m as lucky getting back to the trailhead.","The Hemlocks shelter

‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641477,"I tried to put my best face on it but I can’t deny it. Today was a miserable day. The best part of the day was meeting Joe, a donation-based shuttle driver who gave me a ride to the trailhead. Super nice guy, he’s the former public works director for the city of Great Barrington. He told me up front, “I hate to be the bearer of bad news but this is the wettest summer we’ve had in many years and the trail is going to be a jacked up mess.” He was not wrong. 



The time, effort, and money I put into doing laundry and cleaning and drying my shoes and socks, as best I could, were immediately undone. Within 100 yards of the trail head, the trail was under several inches of water with no way around. Then it got deeper. And deeper. At one point I was wading up to my waist in flood waters from the nearby Housatonic River, which was running way out of its banks. For about a mile I shuffled along, unable to see my feet in the muddy water, praying I didn’t trip over a hidden rock or root or something that would give me a full immersion baptism. At one point it looked like the trail could traverse an area where a small creek might flow into the river under normal flow conditions. With the flood backwaters it was impossible to tell if that was the case or even where exactly the trail was. I could only get a general idea from the white blazes painted on trees trunks and posts. I was concerned enough that there might be a creek and an associated  bank or drop off that I unbuckled my pack’s hip belt and loosened the shoulder straps in case I suddenly found myself in water over my head and needed to get the pack off quickly. It turned out to not be the case but the water got up to my waist before the trail finally climbed out of it.
While this drama was underway, the mosquitoes were feasting on any piece of flesh above the waterline. I applied a liberal amount of insect repellent and donned my bug net head gear before setting off this morning but even with that the bastards were relentless. I ended up wearing the bug net the entire day. 


If only I had a few alligators and water moccasins to contend with, well, like I said before…Jumanji. 


Even after the trail climbed out of the valley and back onto the ridges, it was nothing but soupy, slick mud for long sections of trail. 


To add injury to insult, yesterday I torqued my right knee pretty good. I was coming down a descent, planted my right foot, but when I stepped forward my left foot, the downhill foot, it slid right out from under me. My right foot stayed where it was but the rest of me slid right on down the hill. The knee bent the way it’s supposed to, but it folded up far more than it ever has. Sort of the exact opposite of a hyper extension injury but I don’t know what that would be called. It  was a sharp pain when it happened but seemed to limber up after I walked on it a while. I took some ibuprofen last night hoping to minimize any inflammation. This morning though it was stiff and a bit swollen. I can move forward in a straight line OK but if there’s any lateral stress or twisting motion on that right knee, it lets me know. Before my shuttle arrived, I darted over to the nearby CVS and bought a knee brace. 



The knee brace definitely helped but I could tell by mid-day that I was not going to make the miles I had hoped to today. I called Joe, the shuttle driver and he was kind enough to pick me up at a road crossing about 4 miles short of my intended destination for the day. He’s also going to run shuttle for me tomorrow so I can do some slack pack miles and lighten the load on the knee,
When Joe picked me up at the road crossing, he said that a couple hours after he dropped me off this morning, the local ATC coordinator called him and told him to steer hikers away from the flooded section, the ATC was going to formally close that section and reroute hikers shortly. Sure enough, when I checked email this evening, the ATC had issued a closure and reroute notice for that stretch of trail. Immediately AFTER I had hiked it. As they say, timing is everything.


I’ll have to see how tomorrow goes with the knee and then decide my next course of action. I ain’t gonna lie, it’s been a grind the past few days and is starting to erode my resolve. I just hope nothing serious is wrong with the knee and if I baby it a few days it’ll be fine. Here’s to ice and ibuprofen.","US 7 road crossing

‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641478,"The trail was noticeably improved today. It’s amazing how much water can move out of an area in 24 hours if there’s no additional precipitation. Many parts of the trail that were obviously running with water or had standing water just yesterday were no longer active streams or were starting to dry out a bit. Make no mistake, there was still a lot of mud, boggy areas, and places where the trail was still flowing with runoff, but not as much. I still had to resign myself to wet, soggy feet for the duration of the day but there were longer sections of trail where the shoes would at least not be fully submerged.
To baby my knee another day, I arranged a slack pack with Joe so I only had maybe 10 or 12 lbs on my back, and a significant portion of that was 2 liters of water.  It made a big difference. The knee complained much less and I believe it’s mending. I think I’ll wear the brace for awhile, though, just to give it some added stability. 


On the ride to the trailhead, Joe told me that last night the local TV news weatherman said that this has been the most rainfall during the first 18 days of July since 1874. 


Apart from the muddy sections, the hike today was quite nice. I’m starting to see more conifers in the forest. Still plenty of hardwoods, but on the ridges it’s starting to be dominated by conifers. I walked past a couple of picturesque beaver ponds and had a couple of nice overlooks. Toward the end of the day there was a view that looked out over a valley with a church steeple and a large and obviously old cemetery nearby. Little did I know that I would soon be walking right past that same church and cemetery. Due to flooding, the ATC has also closed and rerouted a little over a mile section of trail that I was to traverse today. The reroute involved a road walk along a couple roads through the valley and I found myself looking at the church and cemetery from a roadside perspective whereas I had admired them from a bird’s eye view just a half hour earlier. 


Right at the beginning of the reroute, a farmhouse sat only a hundred yards or so from the trail and they had a small red wooden shed with white trim set up with the doors propped open and “AT Trail Stand” painted on it. It had a refrigerator in it with soft drinks and several totes with goodies in them. The stand was unmanned but a hand lettered piece of paper had a price list on it. It was on the honor system; you took what you wanted and left money in a zippered pouch. They also had a bucket of chalk for hikers to write their name on the shed. I got a coke out of the fridge, left money, and wrote my name on the inside of the door. After Joe picked me up, he said the kids at the farmhouse run the stand. It’s kinda like a lemonade stand. But on the AT. Very cool. 


I encountered my 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th SOBO’s today. First it was two guys hiking together, Loco and Medicine Man. And Loco was wearing a kilt. Maybe kilts are a SOBO thing. We had a kilt bonding conversation. Wait, that sounds a bit weird. Then a mile or so later there was a man and woman SOBO couple, Thumper and Locomotive. I’ll probably start seeing more and more SOBO’s. These folks are just the vanguard. 


For a week or so, I’ve been wishing for a haircut and beard trimming. It just bugs me when it gets too unruly. Plus it might help in the heat. Today, for the first time of the trip, I found two ticks on me. They weren’t embedded but were crawling on my leg. That solidified my haircut resolve and I found a barber shop in Great Barrington that took walk-ins. As soon as Joe dropped me off, I headed over there. My main objective was to just get a haircut and beard trim to reduce the places where ticks, mice, owls, bears, or whatever could hide out on me. The barber was terrific, though, and ended up giving me one of the best haircuts I’ve ever had. Wow, I feel so much better now.


Today was the extent of Joe’s range for shuttling / slack packing so tomorrow when he drops me off, Ill leave Great Barrington behind. My experience has left me a bit conflicted about this area. I loved Great Barrington; beautiful town, nice people, great places to eat, very eclectic. It seems a bit like Sunnydale from Buffy the Vampire Slayer, though. Great little town, but it’s sitting on the edge of the Hellmouth. That’s what it’s felt like for me here. Actually, that’s not quite fair. Massachusetts has been beautiful and charming and Great Barrington is terrific. The incessant rain and its attendant problems could happen anywhere on the trail. I gave NY a pass on its heat wave so I need to give MA a pass on its rain events. Tomorrow I move on. Hopefully the Hellmouth closes behind me and stops plaguing Massachusetts.","MA 23 road crossing

‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641486,"A thunderstorm last night undid some of the drying out that occurred in the past couple days but it’s still better than it was. The hike today went along Upper Goose Pond and it was gorgeous. There’s a cabin there I would have loved to stay at but it was closed during the pandemic and I heard mixed messages about whether it had reopened. It’s a full half mile off the trail and I didn’t want to walk that far only to find it closed. So I just enjoyed the views from the trail and kept hiking.


I originally planned to stop at October Mountain shelter but when I arrived, there was an entire troop of Scouts occupying it and the mosquitoes were awful, so, since I had a cell phone signal, I emailed the Cookie Lady a few miles further down the trail and asked if I could set up a tent there. I received a prompt reply and they said sure, so I pressed on. 


The Cookie Lady has been an AT institution for many years. It’s a blueberry farm very close to the trail. The Cookie Lady used to greet hikers with homemade cookies and let them tent on her property. Unfortunately, declining health forced the beloved Cookie Lady to leave the farm a couple years ago. A new family has taken over and is trying to continue the traditions as Cookie Lady 2.0. It’s a pick your own blueberry farm. Several hikers did a work for stay by picking a gallon of blueberries for them. I put in an 18-mile day and wasn’t entirely sure I had the energy to wrest a single blueberry from its bush so I made a donation instead. They cooked dinner for the hikers, pasta with pesto, and also made homemade ice cream with fresh blueberries for us. The ice cream was incredible. They also had cookies. They’ve got a bus that’s been converted into a sleeping place for a couple people and is way cool. The bus was already booked so I tented in the yard, which was almost as nice. I never met the original Cookie Lady but I think she’d be pleased with the new owners and how they’re trying to continue the tradition. They were super.","Tyringham, MA

‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641487,"I have now hiked over one-fourth of the Appalachian Trail. Looking at it from one perspective, I have a long way to go. But the perspective I prefer is that one-fourth of the AT is a big, respectable chunk of it. A lot of trail miles are ahead of me, but there’re a lot of trail miles behind me. I certainly hope to accomplish more but if, for some reason, I had to end my hike now, I’ve already accomplished much. I’m still aiming for more, though. 



The trail is drying out and is much improved but there are still some mucky sections.
At the first road crossing I came to this morning, a guy was doing trail magic. He even had hot coffee. I’m not a coffee drinker but I could still appreciate the effort he went to in order to provide hikers with a hot cup of coffee out in the middle of nowhere. I talked to him a bit and learned he lost his job a couple years ago and started doing trail magic 2 or 3 mornings each week during hiker season. One thing the trail is doing is restoring my faith in humanity. When you get to my age, it’s easy to become jaded about people. It’s insidious - you don’t even realize how jaded you’ve become until you meet a guy who lost his job but still manages to go do a significant, kind, selfless act for total strangers on a regular basis. I tried several angles but he staunchly refused my offer to make a donation or take any payment. I hope he understands that he’s not just nourishing bodies with his trail magic; he’s nourishing souls. It did for me, anyway. 


When I got to Dalton, MA I stopped at a deli near the trail and ate a Cuban sub that was excellent. An enormous pile of meats with pickles, onions, and spicy mustard.


All day I played leapfrog with folks who stayed at the Cookie Lady’s farm last night: Twinkletoes, DJ Moss, El Tigre, and Rainfire, a Russian guy who had some fascinating anecdotes about Russia. After leaving the Cookie Lady, we ended up reassembling at the sub shop and then again at the Cheshire tent site. 


A lot of people ended up at the Cheshire tent site. I counted 16 tents and 3 hammocks and I believe a couple more tents popped up after that. I knew a handful but not that many. I wonder how many are SOBO’s.


This tent site is run by the town of Cheshire and it is superb. It’s a large, open lawn space, complete with several posts to hang hammocks from, right next to a hike-and-bike trail that runs through town. It also has picnic tables, a spigot, garbage bin, a very clean portapotty stocked with TP and hand sanitizer, and an open-front shed that has outlets for charging electronics. Hanging in the shed are four loaner bikes you can use to tool around town, get supplies, etc. Two people associated with the city showed up, sprayed around the shed for a couple wasp nests, checked to see if the garbage needed hauling off, replaced TP in the portapotty, and made a point of coming around to each little cluster of hikers and saying hi, answering any questions, and asking if anybody needs anything. Well done, Cheshire!","Washington Mountain Rd crossing.

‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641605,"Got a late start this morning. Maybe it was because the Father Tom tent site was so cozy. Or maybe it was because the back to back 18-mile days had me tuckered out. Or maybe it was because here in town I didn’t get my usual birdsong wake up queues. In any event, I didn’t wake up until almost 7:00. I could hear other people breaking camp and thought, “Wow, quite a few people getting an early start.”  Then I checked the time on my phone and realized I was the one out of synch. Oh well, I didn’t have a big mileage day planned anyway. But it was almost 8:00 before I got on trail. I was sad to say goodbye to this tent site. It really was excellent.



The trail initially involved a mile or so of road walk, then through the middle of a cornfield, then crossed a road, and then began to climb. When I was in the cornfield, a rabbit suddenly popped out of the corn rows and onto the trail immediately in front of me. But then he saw me, and he turned on the afterburner, zigging and zagging like crazy for a hundred feet or so before disappearing into the corn on the left. It made me laugh out loud.
But then when I got to the road crossing there was a recently killed bobcat kitten in the road right where the trail crossed. It was old enough to have been weaned but not very long. When I first saw it, I thought it was a 4 or 5 month old house cat/kitten. But when I got close enough to see the markings and then the tail, it was unmistakably a bobcat. For some reason it stayed with me all day and my thoughts kept returning to the poor little guy. I don’t know why; it wasn’t a gory mess or a shocking image. He was just lying there, permanently asleep in the middle of the road. Such a magnificent creature. When I got to the top of the climb and took a quick breather, I wished I had tenderly picked him up and set him in the woods. It’s where he belonged. But by the time I thought of it, it was too late to go back. 


Most of the day involved a long climb, eventually working my way up to the summit of Mount Greylock. The weather was gorgeous. Blue sky, light breeze, and temps in the 60’s. On the climb, I definitely still worked up a sweat, but whenever I stopped for a break, especially in the shade, I’d almost get a little cool. 


Mount Greylock is the highest point in Massachusetts. It’s right at 3500 feet. I believe this is the first time I’ve been over 3000 feet since I left Harper’s Ferry, WV. I think the terrain is going to get more rugged and the climbs more challenging. 


The Mount Greylock summit is capped with a large monument. There’s also a lodge. That serves food. Mmmm, calories! I stopped for a salad and a burger and a birch beer. Then I sat on the grass at the monument and watched a thunderstorm a few miles distant with a cautious eye. But it skirted around me and I was a happy hiker. 



There’s a road you can drive to the summit of Mount Greylock, park, tour the monument, catch the views, and drive back home on. Some of the hikers resent that people can drive there. They feel it’s somehow cheating. And after making the climb, I get that. I felt a twinge of it myself. I emerged from the woods, lathered in sweat after hiking all morning and climbing 2000 vertical feet with nothing but my legs and a bum knee, only to see throngs of people there enjoying the very same view I worked so hard for. There’s a difference between having a view and earning a view. But I don’t begrudge them for having the view. I hope they enjoy and appreciate it. And I’m glad that I’m able to earn the view. Heck, truth be told, I have many things in my life I didn’t truly earn. Life is too short to spend time worrying whether people have “earned” something. It’s OK to share.
Coming down from Mount Greylock, I surprised a ruffed grouse that erupted from the brush beside the trail in a tremendous drumbeat of wings. It scared the bejeesus out of me for a second. Fortunately I’ve had that happen a few times in my past so I was expecting it when a 2nd bird erupted in flight, then a 3rd, and finally a 4th one. It was nice moment. 



The shelter area tonight is nice but they have tent platforms rather than just a tenting area. These are raised wooden platforms. The problem is that my tent is not a free-standing tent. It has to be staked and have the guy lines under tension for it to support itself. But with the wooden platforms, there’s no way to push a stake in. Tonight I managed to find a flat area on the ground but as I understand it, these platforms get more common the further north I go. So I’ll need to figure out a solution. Maybe a few screw eyes I can twist into the wood, or some sort of temporary guy line anchors I can slip between the planks and tie the lines to. I’ll figure something out.
I wish this knee would straighten up and cooperate. I’m wearing the brace every day and it certainly helps, along with the Vitamin I, but I doesn’t seem to be improving as much as it’s just getting by. Or I could just be impatient. One day at a time.","Cheshire, MA

‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641606,"I was almost asleep last night then a bunch of late arrivals showed up at the shelter. They were loud and boisterous, tromping around, hollering out to each other, shining their high-beam headlamps all around. It was well after hiker midnight and they did nothing to mute their late arrival. It woke me up completely and I had a hard time getting back to sleep. On top of that, it got much cooler last night. Till now I’ve been perfectly comfortable just sleeping in my sleeping bag liner and if it’s a bit cooler, tossing my cheap Costco down comforter on top of me. Last night I had to also get my puffy jacket out and drape it over me as well as put on a pair of mostly dry socks to keep the chill off. The extra measures worked out but it made for a restless night. 


I got up and on the trail early this morning. I met a couple SOBOs on the descent down to the MA 2 road crossing and then a couple out walking a whole pack of dogs. I was getting water from a stream as they passed by. That made them stop and ask questions and before long they wanted to know all about my hike. The dogs got bored with me though and soon pulled them away. 


About seven miles into the day’s hike I crossed into Vermont. In thru-hiker circles, Pennsylvania is known as Rocksylvania and Vermont is known as Vermud. It’s notoriously muddy. We’ve had several days of clear weather so I’m hoping it’s dried out some. It was quite muddy at times but not a complete bog. I feel like Massachusetts heard that Vermont was known as Vermud and said, “Hold my beer.” We’ll see if Vermont keeps the mud state title. 


Around time for lunch, I came upon Bundles sitting under a gigantic boulder eating lunch and he invited me to join him. It was such a cool spot, I did. I met Bundles back at the Cookie Lady’s place but didn’t really get a chance to talk with him much. He’s a young guy and a paramedic in the regular world. Over lunch, we had a great inter-generational conversation about the trail, about life, about people. I took a liking to him and hope to run into him more down the trail. If most of the people of his generation are anything like him, they’ll be OK as long as us boomers don’t put them in a hole so deep they can’t dig out of it. 



The shelter here looks old and the tenting sites aren’t that great. I pitched my tent in the best spot I could find. What it does have going for it is that it overlooks a mountain creek so I’ve got that delicious sound to fall asleep to.

‘Cada,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641615,"I dreamed the creek I was tenting next to was flooding. It was vivid enough that it woke me up and I realized there was another sound superimposed on the creek’s tumbling waters. Rain. Hard rain. There was no chance of me actually being flooded by the creek so I just laid there and let it lull me back to sleep. When I woke at my normal time, it was still raining. I had a nero scheduled today to go into Bennington and pick up the package from Janet, so I dozed off for another hour. It was still raining when I got up, but now just a light drizzle. I packed up and headed out. The trail was truly a mud wallow. I passed Bundles just as he had stopped and was squirming, wiggling, and gyrating out of his rain jacket and t-shirt. I told him I didn’t have any dollar bills to tuck in his hip belt. 


I’m becoming quite the expert at mud. There’s the wet, soupy mud that’s kinda like what they say about the Colorado River before the dams were built, “Too thick to drink, too thin to plow.” Its main objective is to completely saturate your shoes and socks. Then there’s the slightly more dewatered mud that does it’s best to separate you from your shoe when you step in it as sort of a trail toll. And there’s the mostly dewatered mud (not much of that today, though) that is actually kinda soft and squishy to walk through but not wet enough to soak your shoes and socks. It’s actually a bit soothing to walk through because it’s soft and forgiving on the feet. But then there’s the slightly browner mud. Most of the mud here in VT is really dark but some of it has a more brown or tan hue to it. I’m no agronomist but I think it may have more clays in the soil. Anyway, the brown mud is the very, very slick mud. It clings to your shoes, adding a couple pounds to the bottom of each foot for you to carry along, but it also gums up the treads in the shoes. When you step on it, you’d best be prepared to go slipping and sliding and skating in any direction. I told myself that if I found myself sprawled in the mud, I was going to wave my arms and legs back and forth and make a full on mud angel. Miraculously, I managed to stay upright. 



The descent to the road crossing to go into Bennington is about a mile and is very steep and rocky. It’s basically a long, almost vertical, set of boulders I had to carefully pick my way down. With the rain, some of them were quite slippery and on more than one occasion I deliberately did the butt scoot from one boulder down to the next one. When I finally got to the road crossing, there were three guys in the parking lot doing trail magic. They’re from D.C. and came all this way to do trail magic. One of them thru-hiked a few years ago but the other two haven’t. They said they were just paying it forward. They had hot dogs on a grill, a variety of candy, and a cooler of beer and water. Having a hot hot dog dosed with a good amount of mustard, chased by peanut M&Ms is not too shabby a way to await your shuttle driver.
I got into town and…no package. Called Janet to check on tracking and it was supposed to be guaranteed for delivery yesterday by 1:30 but now shows delivery scheduled by 1:30 tomorrow. That’s probably going to mean a zero here tomorrow unless I figure something else out. Part of me chafes at that. I need more heroing and less zeroing, but maybe it’ll help my knee a bit and I can dry out and get some of the mud off me. Maria wouldn’t call me the cleanest thru-hiker if she saw me now.","Congdon shelter
