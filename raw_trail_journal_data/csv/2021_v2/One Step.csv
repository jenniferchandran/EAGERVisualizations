I’m trying to convert my hiking style to the ‘hike light’ philosophy. I’m shooting for pack that weights 18 lbs without water or food(about what a kid might lug to school). If you include them then the total weight (for 4 days of hiking) reaches 28 lbs. It’s a daunting task to pare down everything that you need for the next 6 months to just 18 lbs. The 18 Lbs. includes all of the gear to go from the tail end of winter to summer and back to late fall again. As of last Friday when I hiked up to the Public’s store and used their scales the weight was at a fraction under 18 lbs… so far, a success!",,Osprey backpack,"Feb 16, Thu",0
One Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/369966,"Why walk 2200 miles? That’s a good question. I guess that it started when my best friend and I went backpacking on the Manitou Islands in northern Lake Michigan back in my teens. Caring your “house” on your back and wandering through the woods seemed like heaven to a city boy like me. Setting up camp on the shores of Lake Michigan, swimming, telling stories and watching a fire weave and dance in the twilight only added to the allure. It was about that time when I heard about a never ending trail that crossed the entire eastern US and of other trails that swept down from Canada almost to Mexico winding their way through the Rocky Mountains. Hearing and reading about these trails stirred a wander lust in me. Since then, I’ve gone on to other things, circling the US on a motorcycle, flying hang gliders and hiking. I’ve done many trails throughout the west and the east but never anything as ambitious as this. I don’t know if I will complete the 5 month, 2200+ miles of the trail or even the first week of the trail but I do know that my life would be less if I don’t give it a try for as Mark Twain said “Your greatest regrets will be the things that you didn’t do not the things that you did do”.",,Rich ready for the AT??,"Mar 10, Sat",0

One Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634808,"Been a long hard day getting here, I'm at Woods Hole Hostel which I have to say is an excellent place,,, no, very excellent place! The trail getting here though was very easy right up until Wapiti shelter and then the climb out of there to the top of the mountain was excruciating not to speak of the 3 miles of boulder fields afterwards. Staying the night here and I'll take off in the morning after the rain","North of rode 606

One Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634945,"It's been a hard day, the trail hasn't been so hard but I've injured myself again. My left foot, the third metatarsal, is inflamed and I think  something  in my right knee has torn so, the hike is over and I'm heading down to Pearisburg to get picked up. I guess mountain climbing in a heavy pack for a 65 year old is not the best combination. I am proud to have completed 80 miles and approximately 20000 ft of elevation gain and loss all in five days. Maybe, I shouldn't have pushed so hard.","Mountain House Hostel
