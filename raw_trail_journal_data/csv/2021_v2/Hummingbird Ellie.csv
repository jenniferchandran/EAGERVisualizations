Hummingbird Ellie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602035,Welcome September! This year is moving right along. I am thinking more about hiking the trail now than trying to think myself out of hiking it. It was a rough year so far and I am starting to feel joy again when I do think of being out on the trail again.,,View Entry,"Sep 01, Sat",0
Hummingbird Ellie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602036,"I had a fun two day camping trip with my daughter, son-in-law ,and grandson. It was a beach campsite so it was very different from the trail.  We found shells and hermit crabs.  It was little Landon’s first camp experience at 2 1/2 years old.  He did great!  Now the holidays will be rolling in and I’ll be busy up into the new year!  I have decided to visit my sister in Dalton Massachusetts in October.  I look forward to a good visit and the Autumn beauty of the Berkshires!  I’m bringing my hiking boots to do some day hikes on the trail there.  Tomorrow is Labor Day.  I hope you are all enjoying this long weekend.",,View Entry,"Sep 03, Mon",0
Hummingbird Ellie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607134,"Hi everybody!   It's February already and the time is marching right along.  I just replaced my trekking poles with the same ones.  Black Diamond Alpine with the cork handles.  I love those poles.  My old ones are where I forgot them at my sister's home in Dalton, Massachusetts.  I could have had her mail them but it was time for a brand new pair! A new beginning! All my gear is ready now.  I liked what I had when I got off the trail last year, so see no reason to make changes.  I can always do that on the trail if anything becomes uncomfortable.  My heart is ready to go back.  My family is not as eager to see me try again.  Third time's a charm right?  My daughter has already made plans to do some camping with us here in California this summer.  If I do go back to the trail from Harper's Ferry in April, she wants me to fly back to visit and camp in June.  My little grandson Landon, has become very attached to me and there is concern that it may be as difficult on him as it is for me to leave him.  There is FaceTime on our phones that will make it possible to ""see and talk"" to each other.  I tell myself that one day in the future, he will be proud of his old grandmother who took on such a challenge!   It's time now for serious physical training to build up the stamina for hiking day after day!  Good luck to all out there on the trail right now.  Be safe, stay warm and be proud of yourself!","

Hummingbird Ellie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612068,"Good Morning!   It's May 1st.  It's just under a year now that I have to wait to get back on the trail. I'm loving all the entries from those who are well on their way and those just starting out.  I'm cheering for all of you!   
Looking at the class of 2020, I see that there are 19 of us journaling already.  I love to read about your gear choices and your preparation hikes.  I'm housesitting in Santa Monica at the moment for three little dogs and a cat.  The dogs love to walk, so they are getting more exercise than ever!  They walk, eat and sleep.  I'm keeping them tired out!  It's not hiking but a pleasant workout. 
I was able to hike the Temescal Canyon trail for five miles. (without the dogs!)  It's been awhile and my leg muscles felt the steep incline and descent.  I come down twice a week or more to visit my grandson, so I will practice hiking Temescal on those days.  I also hike with my husband Rick when at home.  We have favorite places that average three or four miles. Summer is coming and it will be hot where we live (90 to 100 is not unusual).  It's usually ten degrees warmer than here in Santa Monica and without the ocean breeze.  
Two months before I leave, I will begin carrying my pack.  I love my  Deuter Act Zero 45 + 15  woman's  backpack.  It weighs about 2.5 lbs without the lid. I found it the lid to be unnecessary weight.  The back adjusts so I was able to move it up or down a notch whenever needed.  I've used it over 700 miles and have no complaints!  I'll be sad when I wear it out.  
I wish you all a wonderful month of May.  Enjoy the flowers you see blooming.  I have a book on flowers along the Appalachian trail that I am enjoying.  Maybe I can remember some of the names!",,View Entry,"May 01, Wed",0
Hummingbird Ellie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613548,"Good Morning  As I read the entries of those who are out on the trail at this time, I am filled with mixed emotions.  It's been a tough challenge with the weather for all of you.  It does take physical strength as well as the mental strength to endure.  I feel excited for you who are beating this challenge! Then I feel great sadness for you as well. The senseless murder this past week, has made this year even more difficult.  Though the trail remains as beautiful and peaceful, I do not believe that everyone out there can be totally at peace again.  I don't know how many will leave the trail because of this. For those who continue on, I wish you a time filled with so many wonderful memories that you can reflect on with joy.   Stay strong! Be safe out there.  Hummingbird Ellie",,View Entry,"May 15, Wed",0
Hummingbird Ellie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615196,"Hello and Welcome June!   
I hope everyone is thinking of the trail and enjoying the preparation time.  There is so much out there that will entice you to change your gear items or reassure you that you have just what you need!   I know that I can't help but check out gear when I see sales on line or happen to be near an outfitters!  My gear is good and I'm ready to go!  Ha! 
Listening and watching the video's of current hikers is a daily activity.  If you haven't found and follow ""Appalachian Trail Motivation"" on Facebook, you really should!  It's very inspiring!  I especially like to follow the ""live"" downloads from Michael Watchorn.  If you miss it, you can still watch it later.   He brings the trail to you and will answer questions you can ask right then! Gotta love it! 
This month will bring Father's Day our way.  I wish you ""Dad's"" a wonderful day with an opportunity to get out on a trail somewhere with your kids.",,View Entry,"Jun 01, Sat",0
Hummingbird Ellie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617794,"Hi.  July has arrived as I sit here in sadness for my husband and myself.Three weeks ago, my husband was tested for prostate cancer and the results came back positive.  Though it is a cancer that can be caught and removed when found early, it is not the case for my husband. The cancer is beyond his prostate and moving into other organs.  At this time, he is taking medications to slow it down. One doctor gives him three years, another doctor we saw this morning believes that is being optimistic.  We still are in a denial state of mind that this cancer  won't go away. There is much that we have to do.  Telling our families was the first difficult step.  Now there are decisions on what Rick wants to do with the time he has left.  He is a project man with dozens of things he has to work on.  That is where he is right now in his mind. My mind is now thinking of what I can do to help him through this. There isn''t much I can do but make sure we eat as healthy as possible (we already do)  and keep up with our walks and exercise (as long as he can).I'm also thinking of all the things that I have to put on hold to deal with this.  My hike is the most painful to give up.  I would not be able to leave him for 5-6 months.  Even going away to see my sister for two weeks in New England is out of the question now.  I would not have a good time knowing I am losing precious time we have together.So right now it is one day at a time, doctor and medical tests weekly, as well as experimenting with medications.  There will be no surgery, radiation or chemo.  I'm going to keep following the journals and online video's that keep me sane. I may end up being the oldest woman to hike the trail.  It is still my dream!",,View Entry,"Jul 01, Mon",0
Hummingbird Ellie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620391,"Welcome August!  
We are having some very hot days here in Tujunga.  Fortunately, the nights and early morning are cooler and bearable.  
This week I received another hiking book from a friend.  ""Lost on the Appalachian Trail"" by Kyle Rohrig.  I'll start reading it today.  I love to read about the hiker experiences.  It keeps my dream alive and strong.  Thank you Carol for sending it.  
So many hikers are finishing up at Katahdin everyday now.  I rejoice with them and for all who make this great attempt.  My day will come again!  I've been following Michael Watchorn video's that he has posted all along the journey.  He has passed the 2000 mile mark now.  His entries are so inspiring as is the person that he is!  Well worth watching.  Hopefully, he will write a book as well,  to capture this hike in writing.  I'm saving all these books to give to my grandson Landon. At three years old he already loves nature and the trails in the woods. We may never get to hike on the AT together, but I hope to inspire him to one day be a thru hiker. 
Here at home, our attitude is ""one day at a time"".  Being on a cancer watch is no fun. It is constantly on our minds no matter how busy we keep ourselves. Rick is  dealing well with it.  The side effects from the meds and the anger for this happening to him, show up often.  Testing every couple of weeks helps us see how it is progressing.  I feel anger as well though it's not me who has the cancer.  It doesn't seem fair or right that in this world of medical miracles, anyone should have to deal with this horrible disease.  Being included in support groups, helps dramatically.  Not only meeting others who can relate, but learning what things they do that make it more bearable.  A special thanks to everyone who has been supportive of our cancer journey. 
Have a great day today.  Keep the dream alive!

Hummingbird Ellie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623572,"Hello!    
I want to thank those of you who have sent supportive notes here and through emails.  It really does help me keep my ""chin up"" and face each day with a more optimistic attitude. 
September is already leaving us.  Who knows where the time goes?  It makes me think of the song of that name.   I saw Judy Collins perform it, in a time long ago. I especially enjoy the version sung by Eva Cassidy, who's young life was taken by cancer.
I'll be going to visit my sister in Dalton, MA next month.  I'm looking forward to the Autumn leaves and a a chance to step on the trail again if only for a walk or two.  I do still believe that my day will come again!   
It's with pleasure and joy that I celebrate as each thru hiker takes their stand on the top of Mt. Katahdin!  You did it!

Hummingbird Ellie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623874,"Hello.  Welcome October!  I'm looking forward to checking out the Autumn leaves this coming week.  I'll be visiting my sister Beverly, who lives within walking distance of the AT.  You can be sure I am bringing my hiking boots and trekking poles.  I'll be there for a week. This is a short get-a-way. I wouldn't feel right about being away any longer. I need to reenergize for the challenges ahead that we will be facing.  Rick is still active and able to take care of himself. Some days, I look at him and can't believe this man has cancer. Even so, he would rather stay at home than travel now. Today, I bought enough quick microwave foods for him to heat and eat. He's a great salad maker but not much for making meals.   I'm sure he will be going out to eat with his friends as well.  This will be the last vacation I take for awhile. Hopefully for a long time. Rick is doing well at keeping the cancer numbers low, meaning it's slowed down.  With the holidays coming up, we are holding back to a slower pace and will enjoy more of the television Holiday Specials. How quickly our lives changed.  Take care of yourselves and enjoy your healthy days to the fullest!",,View Entry,"Oct 05, Sat",0
Hummingbird Ellie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624795,"Happy November!    Where has the year gone?  I can't believe the holidays are coming up so quickly.  
We had a busy Halloween with our grandson Landon.  Pumpkin Patches, Halloween parties and Trick or Treating all went well.  He was our little ""Cat Boy"" character.  Without Landon, I would never know what the latest super hero's are popular or who they are for that matter. Ha! 
I didn't get to go camping at Joshua Tree this past weekend as planned.  Rick is too uncomfortable to camp anymore. I lent the kids some of our camping gear and I suppose I should just let them keep it.  It makes me sad in many ways, as well as guilty of being angry at the cancer.  Striving to give Rick more time is taking away those activities we like to do.  The consolation is that his cancer has slowed down. We will find out how much at the next doctor visit.  
Recently on the ""Writer's Almanac"" that I get in my email each day, there was this poem by Robert Frost."" Reluctance"" . It brought my memory back to the trail.  This season is ""ended"" but I look to the future seasons with anticipation of following the new hikers and one day, my own hike again! 
Reluctance
by Robert Frost
Out through the fields and the woods    
And over the walls I have wended; 
I have climbed the hills of view
   
And looked at the world, and descended; 
I have come by the highway home,
   
And lo, it is ended.
  
The leaves are all dead on the ground,    
Save those that the oak is keeping
To ravel them one by one
   
And let them go scraping and creeping
Out over the crusted snow,
   
When others are sleeping.
  
And the dead leaves lie huddled and still,    
No longer blown hither and thither; 
The last lone aster is gone;
   
The flowers of the witch hazel wither; 
The heart is still aching to seek,
   
But the feet question ‘Whither?’
  
Ah, when to the heart of man
   
Was it ever less than a treason
To go with the drift of things,
   
To yield with a grace to reason,
 And bow and accept the end
   
Of a love or a season?

I wish you all a wonderful Autumn and Thanksgiving holiday.",,View Entry,"Nov 12, Tue",0

Each holiday brings us closer to our ""take-off"" time  My gear is all set  I haven't asked Santa for anything to add to it.  Recently, I am reading more about the bear canisters.  I really don't want to carry one since I don't mind hanging my food bag from a tree.  I'd like to hear your thoughts on that.  
I would like to wish all of you a wonderful Christmas and holiday season  It will be the ""Most Wonderful Time of the Year"" when we are all out on the trail!  I hope to get to meet many of you somewhere along the way!

Hummingbird Ellie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625842,"Hello and welcome to 2020.  By now we all have made our New Years resolutions if we have any.  Mine of course is to get out on the trail again and to be as fit as I can be.  Workouts in the morning, followed by a hike, if only two miles.  I feel it for sure but there  is a strange satisfaction in that!  Ha.  
Broke in the new year with a trip to Big Bear Resort. What a great time in the snow with my family.  What a painful realization on just how out of shape I am.  Ibuprofen came to my rescue!  Don't forget to take that on your hike!  It came in handy many times! 
There are hikers out there on the trail now that are amazing to follow.  Read and learn!  Though I have been on the trail a few times now, I never stop learning something new from other hikers. Thank you all for your entries.  May we meet on the trail one day!

Hummingbird Ellie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626672,It looks like my hike will wait another year.  I am so very disappointed.  The Coronavirus is the final hurdle that I can't control.  My husband can't stay alone for the length of a  hike.  His cancer has slowed down but the side effects are increasing.  I could not enjoy my time away while worrying about him.Now the Coronavirus is here.  People are panicking here in California with events being canceled and airlines refunding airfare   to keep us from catching or spreading the virus.  I'm not in a panic but would certainly not want be in quarantine or to spread this to my husband or family. So I will look to next year and see what happens then. I'll be following everyone closely.  Please do keep your journal entries going as I follow you up the map on my wall.  I'm making little name flag pins that show me where you are.  Good luck to you all!,,View Entry,"Mar 07, Sat",0
Hummingbird Ellie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627699,"Hello!  It's a tough time in the world right now.  Mind boggling when I think about all the pain and death we are all subject to.  I hope all of you are safe at home. Today I would be on an airplane right now, heading for Harper's Ferry. I went through my gear one more time and packed it away for next year.  Thank you friends who sent encouraging emails and posts for next year.  How are you all getting through this pandemic? I've been making face masks for family, friends and the hospitals where Rick goes for blood work and scans.  We take one day at a time and try to deal with each new pain that develops. He's a good patient and keeps busy. The canyons here are still open to hike in.  Reading entries from previous years and books that hikers have written, is keeping the dream alive!  I love it when I see pictures of places on the trail that I remember like it was yesterday.  I'm so happy that I have had that experience of hiking on the AT. Now if I can get one more chance to go back again!  Time will tell. Please take care of yourself.  Wear a mask!",,View Entry,"Apr 24, Fri",0
Hummingbird Ellie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628339,"Hello my friends and potential new friends.   Thanks to those who are being so supportive and sharing their plans of hiking the trail.  It's already June!  Time is moving quickly but not quick enough to see an end to this horrible virus and now this horrible criminal outbreak of violence. Here in Los Angeles, we have been told that to be safe, we should expect to wear a mask through the summer. To stay at home and limit any contact with others.  That is hard enough to do without the new curfew caused by the looting across our country.  Yesterday, I watched and cried as they tore through Santa Monica. At one time, I worked across the street from the REI on 4th street. A beautiful two story building filled with things I'd love to buy. Especially, the hiking gear!  I watched as two brave people tried to keep the vandals from breaking down the door.  They did manage for a short time but couldn't hold on long enough for the Police to arrive.  I watched as the criminals went in and came out with bicycles and arms full of merchandise, over and over again.  The reporters filmed it all.  Stealing wasn't enough. The looters had to set fire to the store before moving onto the next store.  This was close to home and is just a small sample of what they are doing in cities across our nation.  My faith in nature, my faith in people and my faith in God, is being tested to my limit. My husband has been told that he  could have another year and a half before his cancer wins the battle. This is not the world I wish for him to spend his last days.  This is not the world we want to see our little grandson grow up in. Be safe everyone and may we be blessed with good health and peace.",,View Entry,"Jun 01, Mon",0
Hummingbird Ellie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629683,"Hello..  Thank you Sawnie for reminding me that I have not been keeping up with entries.   I have many reasons.  
The Virus has me worried about family and friends and anyone who is in danger of contracting it.  That's all of us!  PLEASE WEAR A MASK!
We have had weeks now of horribly hot weather!  104+ that makes it impossible to hike in.  
There was an earthquake tremor.  Though not a serious one, it was a reminder that a big one could happen.
Right now we are following the fires and how fast they are burning through the canyons and mountains.  It's so very sad for those who lost their homes, possessions and animals.  I can't even imagine the wildlife that we lost.  A Big thank you to all those fire fighters who are from near and far, that are out there in this heat fighting the raging flames.  
With all this, and watching as my husband gets weaker as he fights his cancer, I feel numb.  There is nothing I can do to help control what is going on.  I've made over 250 masks for family, friends, the hospital and now working on children's masks for my grandson's school.  I'm making fun kids prints so they will want to wear them.  
You know where I would rather be!  Stay Safe!",,View Entry,"Aug 02, Sun",0
