DerDieDas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632194,"Good loaded hike in freezing rain.  The pack was right at 20 pounds.  Still have 5 weeks to get it down. I am torn between too much weight and being cold at night.  3 years ago i backpacked the Camino French route in Spain some 800 miles going onto Finistere on the coast.  This took 4 weeks in March during the coldest, wettest March in 60 years.  It rained meaningful rain 25 out of the 30 days. One 30 mlle day featured a storm named Giselle with 60 mile winds, snow, sleet, rain and snow drifts up to my hips in the Asturias.  No rain gear; just a cheap rain parka from Amazon.  My pack, however, only weighed 15 pounds and by the rime I got to Santiago it was 7.  No sleeping bag... just a silk liner overnighting in unheated monasteries and municipal hostels that turned off the heat at 10 pm.  Never again I said... fewer miles with more weight and comfort at night.  Still trying to motivate my back on this approach",,View Entry,"Jan 06, Wed",0
DerDieDas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632198,"Two days lugging 20 pounds in snow/ice 8 miles on asphalt required a downsize day today.  Did the 8 miles but without the pack.  Need to get rid of some weight in the pack.  On the plus side I am up to 166 which is the most I have weighed in 20 years. I am trying to fatten up as I expect to lose 25 pounds on the trail.  In the past I have lost 12 pounds each of the last 3 years doing a different Camino route in Spain and  lost 10 pounds hiking 4 weeks in the German Alps. Prior to that I routinely lost 26 pounds each of the 6 times I raced a bicycle coast-to-coast across the US.  My wife calls it the ""Dachau Look"".  Fortuanately my Bride is on a baking whirl and I get blueberry muffins everyday... yummy
My brother, Ten88, did the AT in 2008 so I am pumping him for insights and donts.  He suggested waterproof mitten shells for cold rainy days.  After yesterdays 3 hour walk in steady rain I went to REI and bought some.  I used them today and got great results.

DerDieDas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632230,"I have slept the last two nights in the backyard.  Temps have gotten down into the low 20s and I was still comfortably warm.  I think I have got this sleep thing down. I am using a Neo Thermarest pad with a silk liner and the same Marmot bag I used on Everest a few years back, the year it never got above 0.    I dont mind being cold and/or wet while hiking; but I will NOT sleep cold.To ease myself into the experience I got the Jetboil out after awakening, boiled some coffee and oatmeal and ate outside. Normally I dont eat or drink coffee until 1-2 hours into my hike.  Dont like to suddenly shock the body with extremes.I hiked a 17 pound pack with the local chapter of the Americans on the Camino today.  These are all people who have hiked one or more of the different Camino routes in Spain in the past.  A very somber hike as almost all of us believe that the Caminos are shut down again this year again if not permanently.

DerDieDas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632240,"On every long hike I take along a distinctive hat. This is so I can be easily identified at a distance by Hikermates with whom I have embedded myself along the way.  I learned this first on the Camino French Route in Spain when trekking through the 100km Meseta region.  This stretch looks remarkably like walking through western Kansas.   None of my nightly Hostel hikers could spot me from a distance to slow down for a chat; everyone looks the same with the same packs, sticks and pads from the rear. So when I hiked the El Norte and Primitivo  the next year I wore what was later called a ""Peaky Blinders"" hat, so called by a charming Japanese lady with whom I befriended and walked with for a week.  She said I was easy to spot from  a mile away.   In 2020  Feb while on the VDLP Camino I wore a ""slouchy"" favored by German hikers around the world.  Again my Irish Pilgrim friend said I was easy to find from a distance.I have noticed on the Camino that other hikers come up with clever ways of being identified from a distance.  In 2018 a Japanese group of 5 each tied a 4 foot colored balloon to their bag every morning with each person having a different color.  After 3 days I was saying things like ""Hi Blue"", ""what's up Red"".  Another guy flew a kite off the back of his bag for days till he forgot where he was and flew it up a tree.
This year I am going with my Bavarian special, purchased in Munich fall of 2019 and worn to Oktoberfest to match my lederhosen and my Bride's drndl.  We were stunning, even to the sober. It makes me look like a member of the Von Trapp Family singers but is actually quite warm on a bald head. The hat  is a bit heavy but apropo for bringing a little class to the AT.  I will probably ditch it with my winter gear at Harper's Ferry and succumb to the customary ball cap.  But by then my newfound walking mates will know me from my stride alone.
 I hiked/camped for two weeks with my suave, slightly older brother Jerry in July near Leadville, CO:  Mt Massive, 4 Loops Pass, etc.  Some of you may have read his AT journal here in 2008 when he hiked under the handle TEN88. If you have not read it here, you should; it is hilarious.  Anyway, I noticed in July that he also wears a distinctive hat, a straw Fozzie the Bear hat that was quite distinctive 2/10 mile higher up on Mt Massive.  The hiker hat trait must be genetic.  Speaking of Ten88,  hewas the one of the guys who thru hiked the AT in Crocs; he doesnt like to talk about Pennsylvania except to recommend going around. He climbed up Mt Massive to 14,240 also in Crocs.  The Crocs matched his hat. This trait did not make it to me; although I have run 17 marathons barefoot and hiked a bit of the Caminos in God's Shoes.

DerDieDas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632260,"Temps got into the 50s in KS so I took down the tent in the backyard and played golf with the Bride for two days.  Time for some healing.  I noticed that we expected 20-25 winds on Wednesday night so I put the tent back up just to see how she would do in windy conditions.  It did not get very cold, mid 30s, but the tent did super in the wind.  No draft, no cold.  I had a really good sleep.  That is until I heard a noise at my door and opened up the tent flap to see a possum staring at my head lamp about 3 in the morning.  Neighborhood has gone to the wild.  I played dead.
Hiked 12 miles without the pack into 20 mph chilling winds today.  I noticed there were no other takers.  It is supposed to snow Friday night with temps in the low 20s.  Good lab conditions.... I have been experimenting with  a Thermarest CCP pad underneath a Thermarest Neo inflatable and really like it.  Going to try using just the lighter 20 degree bag in the tent with the CCP and Neo tomorrow night.   Really would like a lighter weight bag... I have a zpacks 10 degree quilt coming in early Feb which I hope is my go to config but I always have a plan b.
My normal daily hike goes on a bike/hike trail through the woods of suburban Overland Park, KS. Since I hike it almost every day I meet the same people everyday, more people since the Covid Conversion to a healthier lifestyle for most.  Twice in the past two weeks I have been stopped when I've worn my loaded pack and asked if I was ""homeless"", both times by middle aged ladies out walking the dog..  Both times I said ""no"" but next time I am saying ""yes"" just to see what happens.I also changed my flight till Feb 24 and reservations at the Barefoot Hostel accordingly.  Wanted another week to decide about whether to take the vaccination.

And then my Korean Bride showed his Korean Bride how to make Kimchi and the neighbors in his apartment complained about the odor.  But it is one of the WHO super foods I protested.I was going to pitch the tent in the snow when we got home but then I remembered the procrastinator's motto: ""tomorrow, tommorow... I'll do it tomorrow. Definitely tomorrow. So if I have one fear about this adventure it is my contact lenses.  I wear huge dinner plate sized glass sclerar lenses. In 2012 the year the Mayans predicted the end of the world on 12/21/2012 I was at Basecamp on Everest camping at 17,200 in a tent..  When I got up in the morning of Dec 21 I got my lenses out and as soon as I touched the rightie in the -5 degree temps it blew into a 1000 fragments. But the world was still there; I could still smell it.  Mr Sirdan, head Sherpa, we have a problem going down; limited vision even without a storm.  So he tethers himself to me on the narrow 12 inch slippery path with the cliff on the left and the 1,000 foot drop to the abyss on the right.  And then the loaded Yaks pass us on the right, sniffing my butt as I hug the cliff on the left.  So if we both go over the side together I ask, what happens.  They come out in the Spring, find our bodies and put us in a Stupa at the cemetary at 11,500 he says: you in the foreigner area and me in the Sherpa area where most of the bodies are.  Sorry I asked.I can see without the lens but it is like vaseline over my eyes.  This time I am bringing backups but I think I am going naked most of the time.

DerDieDas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632320,"Two days of 8 mile hikes with 20 pounds strapped on.  I spent Saturday night on our unheated ""sun"" porch with the outside door open.  I figured it is a good simulation of a shelter.  I was trying a new  configuration of an ultralight 30 degree bag with a silk liner over a Thermarest 3 inch inflatable over a CCP pad.  It got down to 19 degrees and by 2:30 am I was snuggling back inside with the Bride and the Doxie.  The lightweight is already packed for a flight to our daughter's house near Harpers Ferry.  I will swap it out with the 0 degree bag just in time for Memorial Day. I also packed my Hennesey hammock to swap out the tent there in May.  Looks like I will be going heavy and slow till Maryland. in 2012 I trekked and camped up to just past Everest Basecamp in Nepal.  It took 3 weeks and my Bride had concerns.  So I bought a Spot transponder to let her know from anywhere in the world that I was ok.  That was the year the Mayans predicted the triggering of the Global Exit Routine on 12/21/2012, by our calendar. At 7pm  12/21/2012,  with the world still intact under the stars, I sent out my previously canned message to my Bride ""Meet me on the other side"".On several events through the years I have brought the Spot along as a Plan B, given my increasing age and decreasing life expectancy.  I did the 340 mile non-stop MR340 kayak race from Kansas City to St Louis twice and had the Spot secured next to my whistle on my life vest.  The first year of the race a Spot was required equipment given that just two years earlier a tandem kayak with two 50 year olds didnt see the loaded barge coming down the Mizzou at two in the morning.  The yak and the couple went under the barge with the couple popping out the rear out of breath and the yak chewed up by the prop.  Took a while to find the couple in the thick fog and churning of the Mizzou..  They were lucky to be alive to reenter the race again the next year.I never took the Spot any of my Caminos, there always seems to be someone around to rescue and there is ubiquitous cell coverage along with free wifi at every bar and cafe along the route.  And there is a Cafe at least every 3-4 miles. Hiking high up  alone in the German Alps in 2019 I took the Spot and actually pulled the tab on the rescue switch.  My finger was on the button but I did not press the required 5 seconds so that my body would be found.  I was alone having to make a two foot jump off a ladder embedded into a cliff onto a 8 inch ledge with nothing to hang onto or grab and 18 pounds on my back.  A leap of faith that was rewarded by a liter of beer to calm my shaking legs 1/4 mile down the path at the hut where I overnighted.It is the year of the Virus, expectedly alone on the At and I will be 72 on Earth Day somewhere on the trail.  I'm taking the Spot.,",,View Entry,"Jan 18, Mon",0

I ran into Bart, a 60 year old who frequents the same route.  He is prepping for the Colorado Trail in July.  I told him I did part of that last July and to take a bear cannister.  Bart always listens to me.  I like Bart.When I got back home I pulled out the Jetboil again and made up some Mountain Home Beef Stroganoff that is nearing its expiration date.  The Bride tasted it and said hers is better.  But mine only took 10 minutes to prep I argued.It should be clear by now that old DerDieDas likes to journal. I used to be a big Facebook and Twitter fan but when the algos got out of hand and tried to control my experience I deleted my accounts and moved back to blogs and journals with a more select crowd with similar interests.  I journal daily on a website called www.journaly.com where you can write a daily journal in a foreign language and native speakers will correct your writing. I correct English and Korean everyday for others and in turn write a daily in German which gets corrected by Hans and Helga.  Want to know about my gear?  Go to www.journaly.com and lookup DerDieDas.  I profile a piece in German everyday: today it was my Jetboil.A German friend recommended an app called Day One which I have on all my apple gear.  I keep a personal journal there in German and one in English centered on scientific and philosophical thoughts.  When I hike I spend a lot of time listening to scientific podcasts and audible books of the same sort: lots of physics, quantum mechanics, neurology, virology, immunology and microbiology..  I like to summarize what I think I have learned at the end of the day on Day One.  It is private and that is probably a good thing.  What else are you going to do all alone in your tent at 6 pm?  There is no cable or even cell coverage.Meet me on the Trail!",,View Entry,"Jan 19, Tue",0

After Spaniards the largest ethnic group doing the 500 mile Camino every year is Korean followed by German.  When I trekked Everest Basecamp in 2012 more than 50% of the trekkers were Korean.   There were 2 Korean restaurants in the last outpost town, Namche Bazaar at 15,000 feet on the way to Basecamp.

DerDieDas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632396,"I hiked 9.5 miles on Saturday, up and down through the mud with 21 pounds strapped.  The Bride said to not come like that again.  So I walked 12 miles on Sunday sans Pack on AssFault. Mahomes in Kansas City so I needed to get home before the football game; we live in KC.   Today it rained and sleeted with temps in the low 30s.  I loaded up my pack and zoned out the weather over 10 miles.  I listened to one of Robert Sapolsky's books on neurology, and if you asked me about my hike I would say I spent it with Bob in the pituatary, hypothalmus, testes and other parts of the endocdrine system.  I deferred all control to the autonomic system and remember only  sights from the lecture.  The rain gear was outstanding.Zoning out in distance adversity is something I first experienced in a 200 mile a day stage bicycle race across the US in 1997.  The director of the event asked me during a pitstop at mile 175 how I had liked the last 100 mile stretch in the rain.  I told him I didnt remember a thing.  I had been ""elsewhere"".  Over the years there are vast stretches of America from which I zoned out entirely.  Once my support crew on one of my 3 Race Across America races told me that the hail 10 miles back had been pretty fierce.  I looked at them in shock and thought ""what hail?"".  I've talked to other ""ulties"" over the years-ultracyclists, ultrarunners, ultra hikers- and all had experienced the same phenomena.  I think it is a survival mechanism, a way to deal with adversity. A time machine in fast forward, a tool in the Art of Distance.When I got home today I broke out the Jetboil and cooked up some Ramen Noodles.  I have American friends from the Peace Corps in Korea 1971-1972 who spent the entire two years eating nothing but Ramen Noodles three times a day.  They had trouble with the Korean diet, something that caused me to gain 10 pounds and to eventually marry a Korean Bride.  I remember thinking in 1973 that Ramen Noodles and Karaoke would never make it in the US. But ramen in the US has been Americanized; we buy the ""good"" stuff from the Korean grocery:  spicy.  When I get to town I am in search of.....I have been unpacking and repacking my bag everyday now.  If there is one thing I have learned from spending well over 150 days in EU hostels these past three years is that you must be able to pack your bag in the dark and QUIETLY. And it is remarkable how much ""stuff"" you tire of packing so often and conclude it is not necessary.Over the years my go-to foods in Ultra Events has been boiled potatoes, boiled eggs, nuked sweet potatoes and avocados on the shell: cut in half, remove the seed and suck from shell.

I am not in a hurry. Originally I was going to hike the Via Fancigena from Canterbury, England to Rome.  I was supposed to be in England today and finish in 90 days since the EU only permits 90 days without a visa. Now the EU wont let me in. The original AT plan was leave the  AT for 3 weeks in Harper's Ferry.  A lady friend of mine in San Diego was entered into cycling's Race Across America and I volunteered to be on her support crew.  Two days ago she emailed me to indicate she was deferring the race for one year because she couldnt train in this environment and thought the race would be cancelled again. Too bad, she is really in her prime and usually beats the boys.  She raced in a sub race of RAAM in 2018: 900 miles from San Diego to Durango, CO and beat all the male competitors by well over 3 hours, finishing in under 3 days. I was looking forward to a 2-3 week respite from the AT, cramped 24/7 in a van for 10-12 days with 3 other sleep-deprived, stinky, calorically challenged cyclopaths fixated on the rear wheel 5 feet ahead  of a rider who has only slept 90 minutes a day for the past 10 days.  Done this 3 times before...most folks dont come back.I have settled on a target weight of 21 pounds which is what I have been lugging for two weeks now. From Monday I am going to add a pound every third day to see what the maximum comfort weight is.  I want to discover how many pounds of Snickers I can cram into the bag before the Return on Investment goes negative: always the economist.On Everest our porters normally carried 2/3 of their body weight on primitive wooden A frames, all while wearing flip flops with naked feet and listening to hip-hop on their iphones.  Seriously what century are we in?  I once saw a guy lugging a fridge on his A-A-Frame up to Namche Bazaar at 15,000 feet , where the temps were 0 and the oxygen level was 2/3 that of sea level.  It is truly amazing what a human can evolve his body to do.  The most common commodity on Sherpa A-Frames in Nepal were Pringles, stacked 2 feet above the head of the porter.  I had never eaten a Pringle before, but they soon became a go-to food on long hikes.  They are incredibly light, have all the required salt you need and a good measure of carbs.  And the container burns up pretty nicely as well as fitting nicely into one of your side water pockets. There are Pringles sold everywhere almost the entire way to the first Base Camp at 17,200. Here in the US  they come in by truck and are available for 99 cents at Dollar General.Tscüss",,View Entry,"Jan 28, Thu",0

I mean the efficacy rate for the annual flu vaccine is only 41% and you are claiming 94%.  And now we will never know the real numbers because the studies have been compromised for ""ethical"" reasons; the placebo group has been given the chance to get the vaccine.  And then I read Forbes list of 2020 new entrants into the Billionaire club: the CEO and CFO from Moderna are there as is the Turkish-German immigrant couple from Biontek that developed the misnamed ""Pfizer"" vaccine.  The fourth of the top 5 was a Chinese Pharma guy involved in virology.

I tried to hike on Friday but abandoned after 1 mile; too tired.Doing some research I discovered that this kind of non-allergic reaction is common after the 2nd shot: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/c....  However, it is fairly common among someone who has gone through  SARS-COv2 infection.  This makes sense biologically.  A virgin vaccine takes 12 days to develop antibodies and therefor the immune system eases into the battle to produce antibodies.  Someone who has had an exposure, whether symptomatic or not, still has antibodies circulating and memory t cells and memory b-cells with a mug shot of the virus particles-spike and or nucleo proteins- already in the immune system ready to be retriggered.  Thus, the storm against the invader happens rather fast and results in the immune system making a short term hurt resulting in more antibodies circulating in the blood.I also found that the requirement on the Moderna vaccine for a second shot after 28 days is not hard and fast.  No sooner than 24 days is recommended but the CDC now recommends that the second shot may be as long as 6 weeks after the first: see https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/c.... To quote the CDC ""the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines may be scheduled for administration up to 6 weeks (42 days) after the first dose.""There is also a British study of the Astrazeneca vaccine that seems to indicate that the longer you wait for the second the better: see https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/p... So... in conclusion, I am not getting the booster on March 4 but will continue to read studies expecting that the CDC or Moderna will eventually say that a 2nd shot is not necessary given that there occurred a previous infection with SARS-CO2.  I have 6 weeks from March 4 to change my mind.Tschüss",,View Entry,"Feb 08, Mon",0
DerDieDas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632614,"After 4 straight days of slogging thru 3-4 inches of snow and ice in 10 degree temps, I took a day off today.  Yesterday it was a loaded 11.5 miles wearing micro-spikes the whole time in 5-8 degrees.  Only 800 feet of climbing but those micros just wear me out. Actually I think I am going to put my dredmill in the basement on max ascent and walk loaded for 5 miles while watching Quicksand, the Suttons and Andrewlive on youtube AT videos.
In Ultracycling we used to say that a day off is a decline of 10% fitness; the 2nd law of Thermodynamics, the entropy law,  really causes chaos.  
At the turn of century I used to do these 200 a mile day bicycle  crossings of the US in 14-16 days with a company called PACTOUR, which is still in business.  Riders always had a secret club called the EFM-NDO list: Every F..king Mile-No Days Off. I liked being on the list and did not like sitting in a motel or van. I never missed a mile.
I see myself taking days off on the AT,however. 900 miles of hiking without a day off is the most I  have ever gone but that was on a Camino in Spain with cafes every 6-10 miles where you could get a lovely cappucino and a tortilla.  Havent seen any of that yet on the Youtube AT videos.
So there is this hostel in Bacharach, Germany that is an old 12th century converted castle: see https://www.hihostels.com/host....  It is on a hiking trail called RheinBurgenweg (Rhine Castle Path) that features 22 castles enroute.  It is actually also on the Rheinsteig path which is on the other side of the Rhein and has 24 castles. Both  paths run roughly 200 miles from Wiesbaden to Bonn on top of the Rhine valley with 80% of the hike looking down at the river. They also feature a little over 30,000 feet of ascent and resulting descent into the valley to overnight.  I did the Rheinsteig in 10 days in Sept 2018 (see https://www.komoot.com/collect... ) and saw the hostel castle from the wrong side of the Rhein.  Oh... I thought... I need to be over there.
In 2019 the Bride and I day hiked to Bacharach on the left side of the Rhein and visited the hostel.  The receptionist at the hostel said you have to book a year in advance and gave us a tour.  Ever since I have been trying to get a reservation with no success.
Last night I called and as a result of Covid I got us a reservation for Oct 5-6; take advantage of a crisis, as they say.  For 84 Euros total we overnight, get dinner and breakfast.  I have oft heard the experience there as like being in a Harry Potter movie. 
 So the plan is for me to rehike the 200 mile Rheinsteig again in Sept after the AT then come back down the west bank and meet the Bride at the castle.  Then day hike together for a week or so down to Bingen, one of my favorite towns because Hildegaard was from there: see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...
When I hiked Rheinsteig during the same time in 2018 I kept running into small town Oktoberfest celebrations in Kaub, Bad Honnef, etc.  Just a small tent with 1000 locals or so all dressed in lederhosen and drndils, always with really good all-female bands playing good German Schlager style dance music... lots of ooompaapah. It was amazing how quickly I would recover from a 30 mile day with 5000 feet of ascent after entering a tent with massive amounts of beer and filled with ladies dancing with each other and wearing push-up bras and low cut drndls.

 I was usually the only one looking 21st century and the only one dancing  with the ladies; I am convinced German men dont dance.  I think this year I am going to ferry  the 5 pounds of lederhosen in my Rucksack... I noticed lots of hikers on Sundays wearing the traditional.

I have hiked 11 + plus loaded miles each of the past 4 days with the high only being 5 degrees and enough snow to require micro spikes.  The ranger yesterday stopped me and asked if I needed a place to spend the night.  This is the 3rd time I have been asked since Jan 1. The WhiteWalkers are supposed to go back North on Wednesday so I should be able to get some nice distance miles in before shutting down on Sunday.The Bride fled town on an airplane this morning for the 70 degrees in Las Vegas... she is going to hike with her friends in Death Valley.  Real hikers go out in the snow, I told her.  We like hiking in shorts she said. She is coming back on Saturday when it is warmer here.I had intended to hike 11 loaded today but after 5 miles and unable to see the path I returned home.  It is a high of 2 degrees  with wind chills in the - double digits.  At times it is a whiteout; not even the squirrels were coming out.All the fricking cold weather and experimenting on the sunporch laboratory with sleep systems lead me to swap out the Thermarest Neo lite with an Xtherm. This goes from a 3.2 R factor all the way up 6.9.  Also I retired my 12 year old  liner for one that claims 12-15 degrees. I have a lot of fond memories with the old liner. On my first Camino it was all I used at night in the monasterys and hostels.  It was also my sleep system when I raced in the non stop 340 mile long MR340  kayak race from KC to St Louis down the Mizzou.  Spent a night together alone on a sandbar to escape a barge coming at me and to get some recovery. Technology cut it from the list this year.So the trip starts in 9 days and I am so ready I am already planning hikes abroad for the Fall and December.  Ron the ShuttleGuy from the Atlanta Airport kept texting me during my hike in -13 temps on Thursday.  Finally I texted that my fingers were ready to fall off and I would contact him later.  I am looking forward to meeting this guy; I am sure he is overflowing with great tall tales from the AT.

DerDieDas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632721,"So I am so hooked on Youtube Thru Hike videos-Quicksand, Andrewlive, BlackHiker, Scooter, etc- that I am giving it a shot under my trailname brand.  It just looks like these guys are having so much fun; the real reality tv.  I have set up a channel and uploaded some pre-hike let's-see-how-you-do-this attempts that I am not happy with, but I have 4-5 months to get it right. Normally I listen to audible books or downloaded podcasts in the tent.
I tried this once before, posting out to Facebook on a 700 mile hike along the coast line of Spain from Irun to Oviedo, onto the Primitivo Camino route, then Santiago and out to the coastal cities of Finister and Muxia.  That was 2019 and I carried a small 1/2 pound drone that could do video and stills.  It had a software governor on it that limited the height to 100 feet, but 35 years of coding in whatever computer language you care to mention taught me how to reverse engineer and hack that limitation away. Twice I got the drone too high up and over the coast and it flew way out over the ocean but it has a return to home feature if it loses the extended wifi with my phone.
I had not read the EU regulations on Drone deployment that basically say you can not fly a drone anywhere without a 250 Euro fine.  But I hiked in early Feb that year and all of the touristy northern coastal towns had fled south to the warm Canary Islands and Mediterranean during the off season. I saw NO ONE for 10 days, literally no one so my illegal activities were never detected. I posted fantastic aerial video of the coastline and the loneliness of a sole Pilgrim hiking the coast line.  I got really good at making the drone follow high above me just to my rear and film my hiking.  You discover new talents when you are all alone, day after day after day after day. Kind of like Phil Connors in Ground Hog Day.... I got you Babe.Actually I kind of agreed to do another vlog in German for a German lady in Switzerland with whom I chat one hour a week over skype in German.  She has a youtube channel called Typische Deutsch mit Anja.   She wants me to send her some video with me speaking German to inspire other students.  She did not indicate toward what I am to inspire them.  That is REALLY going to be fun.
In Spain I had a blast hiking 20-30 miles a day and spending nights alone in the hostel editing video with Inshot on my phone.  That drone has not flown since 2019 and I am definitely not bringing it.  But I have learned a lot from watching Quicksand use a phone, enough to know this is going to be fun.

DerDieDas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638125,"I went off trail in Harper's Ferry on May 17 when my Bride drove out from KC and met me at Coach House Pub in Harper's Ferry.  We then drove to our daughter's house in Silver Springs and a few days later drove back to KC.  Tomorrow I fly back to DC, catch the 4:05 Amtrak from Union Station to Harper's Ferry and will hike out to at least the Ed Garvey Shelter by nightfall.
I went off trail mainly because my Bride offered to drive out and see me for the first time in 80 some odd days. Compared to 46 years together 80 days seems inconsequential, but it appears different to her.
The other reason I got off was because I had lost 25 pounds and she was concerned.  After two weeks I have only managed to gain back 5 pounds despite having eaten an entire cheese cake in 2 days twice.  Having lost 25 pounds for each of the six times I raced a bicycle across the US, my experience is that it takes 2-3 months to get that weight back, once the metabolic rate goes so high for so long.  At any rate I look rather stunning at my 8th grade weight and have read some papers suggesting that thin is good to dampen the aging process.
I have fallen 150-200 miles behind my Tramily once splitting from them in Harper's Ferry.  Meta, Grasshopper, Reset and Baked Potato are up near Duncannon, PA.  I want to catch them and summit Kathadin together, having been with them since at least day three. 
To catch them I have made some adjustments for the second half.  I have replaced the 4 pound REI Flash bag with a 2 pound Gossamer Mariposa rucksack.  I am leaving the poles at home,  I had not used them for the last 5 days of hiking.  I replaced the 10 degree bag with a 30 degree bag and am bringing a one pound Marmot single tent instead of the 2 pound Nemo Dragonfly.  I am bringing a BV450 bear vault and leaving bear sacks at home.  I have only used the PCT hang method twice due to a scarcity of appropriate tree branches.  On average I wasted 30 minutes looking around.  Now I want to walk till dusk, just put the vault under a log and go to bed.
In all, I estimate I have dropped ten pounds from my gear, including leaving the Jetboil at home.  By Harpers Ferry no one around me had cooked for 2-3 weeks and I had not used the Jetboil for a solid 2 weeks.  3Jack convinced me to still carry Puff the Magic Jacket.  He thru hiked in 2018 and section hiked all of Virginia with our Tramily this year.  It became clear from his exploits that Puffy would be needed at least in NH and Maine.
I tried vlogging the first half and grew to dislike it.  I am leaving the gear at home and will try to journalize instead.  Meta is really disciplined at this, an attribute I strongly admire.
Sitting at Coach's in Harpers Ferry two weeks ago I felt a sore throat coming on.  Not having had a cold in over 5 years, I thought it would pass.  It did not.  I have spent much of the last two weeks in bed, suffering from an immune system weakened by all the abuse of the past 82 days. While not 100 percent I am well enough to head back  to Maine.  I am so looking forward to longer, stronger days and a reunion with the Tramily.

Last night was a wonderful night tenting at the Crampton Shelter.  I did not meet any thru- bees but a lot of weekend wanderers enjoying the long weekend.  The tent sites were superb, each with a flat cordoned off space for the tent and a personal campfire.
      I took a site as far away from anyone else due to the fact that I burst into loud spurts of coughing in the middle of the night. Last night was not so bad so I think I am done with the virus in a day or so.  At any rate the alien noise of the cicadas probably drowned out my interference; there is a lot of beetle sex going on near the AT.
    I canped tonite at the tentsites just short of the Ensugn Cowell shelter.  Really nice tent pads here.

The shelter was occupied by Molasses, a 24 year old from Hot Springs AR and a young man whose trailname I did not catch.  Next to the shelter are two nice tent pads.  They were filled with two tents and three old retirees just a bit younger than me.  The three got on the trail in Caledonia State Park and were getting off today at Pine Grove State Park.  They decamped early this morning before I awoke but I quickly caught them and chatted for a while.  They complained that they were slow because they are old until I pointed out that I am six years older than the oldest. Age is not the problem I thought.  Still it was great seeing them out there and they did seem to be having a great time.
Molasses and I are going to become good friends.  We hiked the last three miles into Pine Grove together and then had fajitas together at the General Store.  I told her I was going on a couple of miles so I could make Friday a short day into Lisas Hostel where I am meeting up with Strider.  Molasses indicated she likes doing 18-20 mile days.  Perfect I thought and expected her to make it to this tentsite.  Seems she opted for the somewhat dreary looking Ironmasters Mansion Hostel.  But I am sure I will see her at Lisas Hostel tomorrow night and will conspire to have her join Strider and me in doing 18-20 mile days.  She has a similar pace.
Saw the rear end of a bear today.  He/she (I couldnt see there) was on the trail until I arrived and quickly vaulted into the woods.  I must really smell bad.

We did get up and on the trail at seven to be at Goodies in Duncanon by eight for a big boy breakfast.  We were there for one and a half hours pigging out and listening to tall tales from Spark, the resident entertainment.  He revealed his cross country cycling exploits, his xcountry Harley trips and history of the Doyle Hotel and the surrounding area.  He was a hoot.
We encountered more snakes today including a copperhead in the strike position blocking the trail.  We negotiated around but the rocks are difficult because you just cant relax; you have to process the peripheral info while trying to match your foot placement to the rocks.  Too much going on.
Three out if the last five days have been 20 mile days.  Tomorrow will be three straight.  This just feels good.

The humidity this week gets worse each day.  Today I hiked mostly topless after my techware looked like I had mopped s bathtub with it.  A lot of the Guthook springs are now dry which means we never pass up one with water.  We are both porting 3-4 liters and it just runs through our bodies. Temps got up to 95 today.  At noon I thought there was no way we would do 20 today but at 6:30 we were tenting with 20 miles.  We are camping legally just outside Swatara Park where camping is illegal. 
About 2 oclock I felt extremely lethargic with a bad case of the blahs or Mondays. I found a spot to lay down and motioned Strider on.  I took a 10 minute power nap with the most vivid dream and awoke with a most commanding stride.  I caught Strider at the Rausch Shelter and he was power napping.
There is an alternate 1.6 mile dry route around the beaver dam crossing after Rausch Gap.  Waymaker had texted us to take the alternate route. He said the mud was up to his knees in the crossing yesterday.  We took the alternate and were hit with a pretty good climb.  But we were dry.
Should be a pleasant night to sleep with the sound of cicadas doing their thing.

We met two older southbound section hikers yesterday and chatted for a half an hour.  I noticed one guy was using a thirty year old Jansen rucksack, the same one I bought in 1973 and used on my first Camino in 2016.  It seems the two started hiking the AT twenty seven years ago and were working a different section every year since. He bought the bag 28 years ago and has used it on every section since.  This year is their final section from Port Clinton to PennMar Park.  The bag looked tired but he thought it would make it.  I admire the perseverence.
Today it was again in the mid nineties with high humidity.  The rock were sweating ,making footing difficult. It rained intermitently cooling things off a bit but we never put on our rain gear.
We are staying at the Rock and Sole hostel at mile 1204.  Very nice and interesting setup.  A little pricey but worth it.  After four days tenting we needed laundry and a shower badly. And we needed to resupply and eat a hot meal. The owner, Craig, helped us with both needs.

We spent the night with Real an older section hiker from Georgia who section hikes a different leg every year till she gets her done.  She is porting a 40 pound bag but she holds her mileage under 10.  Nice lady.
We also enjoyed the company of Q, a SoBo who started in New York.  Q is doing the on the trail training plan, having started with a 60 pound pack and an aux pack off the front.  He is down to 40 now but showed off his five pound collection of quarters retrieved from the bowels of his rucksack.  I argued that my Visa weighed a lot less but he needs to learn that himself.
Q forwarned us of what lays ahead for us.  Very helpful.  I loved this guys enthusiasm but it was clear he had been alone on the trail for quite some time.  He was non stop talk.
Today was hot and humid again until the final hour. Walking down the rim into Port Clinton the sky opened and the deluge obscured the trail.  The clouds sounded like a bad case of indigestion and there were quite a few flashes.  Coming down was treacherous.
I met Strider sheltering at the firestation and we headed out to find the Pavillion where we could spend the night out of the rain.  There are about 8 of us here but the pavillion is huge.  There is a porta potty across the street and picnic tables inside the shelter.  Only problem is the bird poop on the floor; i am using my tent fly underneath my pad.
We both need new shoes so we are probably going to uber to Cabelas tomorrow at 8:30.  There is a free shuttle but it does not arrive at the Pavillion until 10:15. Too late.  It looks like another 15 mile day tomorrow.  
I did weigh myself at the hostel and it has stabilzed at my ninth grade weight of 145.  I feel strong at this weight and think I am going to maintain it on the go forward.  I like the caloric restriction hypothesis for seniors as a prevent for cancer.  That is, spend all your calories on movement so that mutant cancer cells have no residual resources to reproduce.
I ran across a Nobo wearing a kilt today.  He is at the pavillion so I asked him about it.  I am considering getting one to hike the Scottish West Highlands abd a Camino route in Feb.  All Camino routes end in the Gaelic area of Spain.  Lots of kilts there.

Others at the shelter reported the same.  Not using thr BT earphones again til I get to NJ.
Strider and I got up at 6:30 to hike into Hamburg to breakfast at Crackerbarrel.  It was a 4.4 mile hike but, cmon, it was blueberry pancakes.  We then went across the street to Cabelas and bougjt new shoes; only getting 500 miles to a pair of Merrel Moabs.  Rocks are chewing them up.  Cabelas has a free shuttle back to the trail so it took us back essentially where we started the day.
We originally planned to hike 15 miles.  But the new shoes felt so good and temps never rose into the 80s.  We made it to 21 and I thought about hiking into the night. Then I remembered Timber Rattlers are nocturnal; they hunt at night.
We are staying at a shelter that has a caretaker, a water spigot, a solar powered shower and a trash can and a charging station.  A real hikers dream shelter.  Accordingly the six bunks are full and there are 10 tents.  I have some new friends.
The Pavillion last night  was also a delight.  There were no night critters much to my surprise and the place is huge.  I heard no one during the night even though there were nine of us there.  
We met the sweet lady in house 75 on Penn Street down frim the Pavillion.  She is famous on Guthooks as AT friendly.  She was out walking her dog and when she saw us coming she pointed to her spigot and told us to get water there. Trail Angel.

DerDieDas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639050,"We awoke to rain, decamped in the rain and then hiked all day in the rain.  It is still raining and threatens to rain all night. And the temps fell enough to keep our cold blooded audience deep within their cozy caves and not at our feet.  Still the wet rocks and boulder fields were tiring even without the need to survey for vipers.  Most of the hike was a broken leg in waiting.  This section is why PA is called Rocksylvania. And it gets worse tomorrow but lets not spoil it with anticipation.
I fell four times, hurting only my pride.  One time my shoe was ripped from my foot wedged between two rocks that refused to yield the right of way.  I quickly learned to avoid the rocks with lichen,  Those rocks look coarse but you could ice skate on them.  I needed a walker with a seat on it.  The going was glacial.
My goto snacks are now M&Ms.  Unlike Snickers, they melt in your mouth, not in your bag.  I also switched to Nutella on my soft  taco shells instead of peanut butter.  I left my Jetboil cooker at home not wanting the weight and  having tired of Ramen with Spam, dehydrated whatmenots and especially dehydrated mashed potatoes.  Dinner is now tuna fish on soft taco.  Breakfast is two pop tarts or honey buns.  And then you snack every two miles.
Strider is impressively holding up well. I know he is hurting but he forgets to complain.  He has a blister but he moleskinned it and I will offer to tape it tonight. His Merrills are making the rocks much better than the vibramless Lone Peaks.; he threw the latter away after only two hundred miles.  The rocks were ripping through the sole and into his soul.  Now he is much more content with just the twisting between the rocks.
We both take a daily ten minute power nap between 1 and 2.  It is a senior thing that keeps us looking handsome for the ladies.  It is amazing how much recovery comes from such short REM cycles.  This is my only concession to this age phenomena.
We hiked thru the rocks and boulders pounded by an incessant downpour for eight miles to the Allentown Hiking Club Shelter for lunch.  Once there the rain got worse and we decided to nero.  It is now 4 and the rain did get worse and is not letting up.  Good call.  
We will make up the miles tomorrow and expect Knifes Edge to be reasonably when we get there in 7 miles.

Two tenths of a mile of one shot at getting the shoe in the right spot.  Wow, that was fun though exhausting.
Yesterday it rained all day and through the night.  Our decision to Nero at the Allentown Shelter proved correct; the shelter filled up by nightfall.  
We got up at 6:30 and headed out when the rain stopped before 7.  The five miles to the Thunderhead Lodge were some of the easiest of the AT.  The lodge does not open till noon on Saturdays so a meal was skipped and we moved to the start of the rocks st seven miles.  Up till then we were doing 3 mph.  From the rocks till the final 5 miles it was so slow.
With 5 miles to go we met Steve, a ridge runner.  He walked with us to the edge of town filling us in on local happenings on the trail.  He had what I thought was a machete in his pack but was in fact a limb saw.  When I asked why he was carrying a machete he told me what it really was and then said that if you are spotted carrying a machete on the trail you will be known within the hour all up and down the trail.  There was a fairly recent incident on the trail that did not end well involving a machete.  Go ahead and google machete and AT.  Since then you do not to want to carry a machete on the AT.
We are staying in the garage out back of Berts Restaurant in Palmerton.  They set up some old beds in there, gave us access to a bathroom and shower plus a washer and dryer.
We ate a big dinner at Berts with two other Thru Bees, Bilbo and Revival.  When it came time to pay the waitress said the Historical Society was paying for all thru hiker meals today.  We left a big tip.
Palmerton is extremely hiker friendly.  When we got off the trail to hike into town along a narrow median of a busy highway a nice lady immediately stopped and gave us a ride to Berts.  The Family Dollar was brilliantly stocked with hiker needs and there are welcome hiker signs all over town.  There is no Hiker Trash in Palmerton.

Palmerton is a real small town America town.  They have preserved the downtown by keeping Walmart and fastfood out.  It is truly stuck in the early sixties in a very nice way.  I would come back here.

$109 for a single room with the bed consuming 80% of the space, no hot water and no wifi.  There were mirrors all over strategically placed for, well you know.  I refused to touch the bed and slept on the floor.  Strider, a retired policeman, immediately pointed out that this room was designed to be rented hourly.  He didnt need to tell me.  It being Sunday the room was available in the dark side of the building.
The experience was so bad I told Strider I would pay for a double in Delaware Water Gap at hhe Rodeway Monday night.  I am here now enjoying a late checkout before trailin on.  Almost all the guests were thru bees.  The Sunoco across the street has good resupply but avoid the Dunkin Donuts; it is extremely rude.","Wind Gap

I decided to tent it between the two cabins.  In the middle of the night I heard coyotes howling rather close and then the spund of a distressed lamb. After a few minutes of sad bellowing it became silent.  I moved my mattress and my bag to the bunkhouse, closed the door and slept like a preview of death.
In the morning I opened the door and there stood Jack looking at me and in obvious need of an apple.  Jack is a mule with a bad case of mange. I could only offer him a finger pointing to the grass which he then began to mow.
I left at seven and walked the three miles in Unionsville to resupply and eat breakfast at Horlers General Store.  What a treat! I had flashbacks to my summer youth staying with my grandma and spending hours hanging at the general store with the rocking chairs on the porch abd talking with the locals.  Oh but I did spend a lot of time at Horlers and it was a half mile off trail.  But it was worth it.
The rest of the day was spent hiking the 20 miles to the Wawayabda Shelter, which really is way way yonder.

He offered me a coke, some chips and a cheeseburger.  He had youtube cameras setup in front and on the side of the tent.  I suggested everyone moon the cameras but Happy said he would edit it out.
I was the first ThruBee of the day but after an hour of exchanging Glory Days with Happy the place was full so I left.
There were numerous anonymous acts of Trail Magic today.  Dozens of gallons of water were keft wherever the trail intersects a road.  Yorker creek water has a iron appearance to it, somewhat reddish.  If I had a magnet I could try to make the water bend to one side of the bottle. Anyway the clear water in jugs was great.
It got into 80s today so there was no way I was going to pass up a chance to swim at Island Pond.  There were numerous kayakers there so we swapped kayak tall tales.  It was difficult to leave.
