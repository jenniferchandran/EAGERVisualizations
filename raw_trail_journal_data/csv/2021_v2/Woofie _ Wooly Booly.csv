Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643228,"This year’s hike will be our first time hiking in autumn.  We’re really looking forward to hiking in days that are getting cooler instead of hotter.  Our Sep 15 start date is tentative depending on the weather.  If it’s still getting up to 90s or high 80s, we’ll probably wait a few days for cooler temps.
I’ve always liked hiking in the fall…cooler temps, less rain, fewer bugs, the autumn colors, and maybe fewer hikers on the trail.  So, what’s not to like?  Well, maybe the days getting shorter, rocks and roots hiding under the fallen leaves, and maybe fewer hikers on the trail.",,View Entry,"Aug 27, Fri",0
Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643338,"The reason why we’re hiking in the fall this year is the same as why we didn’t hike at all last year – the Covid-19 Pandemic.  We were so ready to hike last year.  We’d spent the whole winter exercising, building our core muscles so our bodies wouldn’t take so long to get used to the routine of hiking with backpacks. Then came Covid, and all plans for last year were off.
It did, however, give us the chance to take care of jobs around the house that we’ve been putting off for the right time.  So it was the right time to rebuild the back deck that has needed the floor decking replaced for a couple years.  That took me about six weeks, just about as long as the hike might have lasted.  And now we have something to show for the time spent, a beautiful new deck to enjoy.
This year the trail sections we’re planning to hike were still closed in the spring.  But now that we have the vaccine and the trail is open an autumn hike sounds good – better than waiting for next spring and missing two whole years of hiking.",,View Entry,"Aug 30, Mon",0
Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643420,"One piece of new equipment we’ll be using this year is the Sawyer Mini water filter.  We bought one for each of us.  We also added a 3-liter water bladder for each of our backpacks. 
Finding and carrying enough water might be a bigger problem this year than past years.  When hiking in autumn, water sources are usually fewer and farther apart.  And this year our first few days will take us along long stretches of high ridges, maybe easier walking, but without many water sources.  The Guthook Guide shows at least one 10-mile section between available water sources.  Carrying our normal 2 one-liter water bottles each probably won’t be enough, so that’s why we’ve added the extra water bladders.  Woofie also likes the idea of being able to drink from the bladder hose without having to reach for a bottle.
Filtering enough water to fill 4 bottles and 2 bladders could take a very long time.  The Sawyer Mini filters save a lot of time by allowing us to fill up on unfiltered water, and then drink from the bottles or bladders through the Mini filters.  But since we haven’t tested this method out yet, we’re going to carry our old reliable Katahdyn water filter, at least for the first few days.
And like many other experienced hikers, we’ll be using empty Smart Water bottles instead of our Nalgene hiker bottles, saving some weight.  Four empty Smart Water bottles weigh as much as just one of our old empty hiker bottles.  It's never too late to try something new.",,View Entry,"Sep 01, Wed",0
Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643716,"This year I’ll be using the PCT Method of hanging the bear bag.  In past years I just pulled the bag up and tied off the rope on a tree.  Then in 2019 I saw a hiker use the PCT method, where you loop the end of the rope through the carabiner before pulling up the bag.  He explained that bears are smart enough to know that the rope tied to the tree is keeping him from getting the food bag.  All he needs to do is break the rope to get the bag.  The PCT method, tying on a stick that lodges on the carabiner, hangs the bag without tying the loose end to anything, so the bear can’t make the bag fall.  Watch the Bear Bag PCT Method Demo on YouTube to see how it works.
But I’ve found it quite hard to pull up a heavy bag.  Ours has food and other bear attracting items for two people in it, so it easily exceeds 20 lbs. for the first couple days after a resupply.  The main problem is the friction between the small rope and the tree branch.  I worry that the rope can dig in, scarring the tree branch and wearing out the rope.
My solution is to add a second rope with carabiners on both ends.  Instead of connecting the bear bag to the tree rope carabiner, I clip the second rope’s carabiner to it.  I then run the second rope from the tree rope carabiner through the bear bag carabiner, back through the tree rope carabiner, making a simple pulley system.
Now, when I pull the tree rope, I’m only pulling up the weight of the second rope and carabiners, while the bag remains on the ground.  If necessary to get the tree rope carabiner high enough, I attach the carabiner on the loose end of the second rope to the bear bag and then lift the bear bag with one hand while pulling the tree rope with the other, keeping the weight off the rope to protect the tree branch.  When the tree rope carabiner is as high as it can go, I attach the stick to the tree rope and let the bag back down gently, the stick and tree rope carabiner meet each other half-way up.
I repeat the PCT method with the second rope.  This time when I pull the rope to raise the bag, the pulley system allows me to pull down at only half of the weight of the bag, and all the rope friction is against smooth carabiners, reducing wear on the rope.  When the bag reaches the tree rope carabiner, I attach a stick to the second rope and let the bag descend. Because of the pulley ratio, the stick reaches the bag carabiner after it has descended only another 2 feet, leaving the bag safely about 10 feet above the ground.",,View Entry,"Sep 07, Tue",0
Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644124,"It looks like Tropical Storm Nicholas that drenched New Orleans is heading toward Virginia in the coming week.  It will probably provide 3 or 4 days a moderate to strong wind and rain, and replenish the water sources along the trail.  Since it might not be safe in the woods with strong storm winds, we’re moving our start date to after the storm blows through.
A big hazard for Woofie is cramping.  When she fell on the first day of our 2016 hike and broke her knee cap, it wasn’t because of the trail condition.  She didn’t slip or trip on anything.  She fell when one of her legs suddenly cramped while walking down a hill.  When her cramped leg wouldn’t straighten to take the next step, she went down hard on her face.  We camped at the first spot we could find and left the trail the next morning.  We were lucky to have cell service and be near a forest service road.
She sometimes is woken up at night by leg cramps.  She has found that taking a Tums tablet relaxes the cramp within a minute or two.  The calcium content provides needed electrolytes, and she can go back to sleep right away.  Now when we hike, she carries Tums and takes one when her legs feel like they may cramp. 
On our last hike in 2019 we met a nice woman hiker, Viva, who told her about Emergen-C.  It comes in small packets of powder to mix with water.  It contains 1000 mg of vitamin C, but also has electrolytes, anti-oxidants, and other vitamins.  Woofie takes it for the electrolytes and finds that it prevents the night cramps and, hopefully, also the hiking cramps.",,View Entry,"Sep 16, Thu",0
Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644239,"Every year before we head out for our new hike I always check out all our equipment, especially important this year with the addition of new equipment.
When I tested using the Sawyers Mini water filters, I found them unsatisfactory.  They’re designed to be used with a squeeze bag or bottle.  And we’re also are supposed be able to drink from them directly connected to a water bottle.  But the flow was way too slow.  It took too much pressure to get a stream of water to pass through, and the stream was so small it would have taken a very long time to fill just one bottle.  And there certainly wouldn’t have been enough water flow to satisfy a thirsty Woofie, who gulps down water by the bottle full.
We’re going to keep using the tried and true Katahdyn filter.  But we are still replacing our well used Nalgene bottles with super light-weight and cheap Smart Water bottles.  When I tested filling the new bottle using the Katahdyn filter, I learned that needed to adjust my method a bit.
Normally, I hold the bottle between my legs to keep it upright while I’m pumping water into it from the filter.  That didn’t work so well when I tried to do the same with the Smart Water bottle.  When I got it almost full, the weight of it made me have to squeeze a bit harder to keep the bottle from falling out from between my knees.  But it’s so flexible that it just collapsed between my legs, sending all the water straight up and all over my legs and the floor. 
So, after I cleaned up all the spilled water, I still had to fill the bottle again.  Braver and wiser on my second attempt, I found I could hold the very bottom of the bottle, where it’s more solid, between my legs without collapsing the bottle during the pumping.  Good thing I was alone when that happened.  I wouldn’t want anyone to know.",,View Entry,"Sep 18, Sat",0
Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644460,"Today we drove back to Pearisburg, VA. We’re staying at the same motel as on our last hike and even got the same room. I hope that means luck will be with us this time.  Our shuttle driver, Don Raines, will meet us in the morning and shuttle us back to the spot where he rescued us from our 2019 hike. The stormy weather that came through here over the past couple of days is gone, and clear, cool weather is forecast for several days. Looks like a good time to go hiking.",,View Entry,"Sep 23, Thu",0
Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644634,"Last night we called our shuttle driver, Don Raines, to confirm our pickup time.  He suggested a better spot to park the car during our hike would be at the Giles County Farm Bureau building right next to the New River Bridge.  The AT crosses the New River Bridge, so we’d be right at our car without having to walk the mile up the road to get to our motel.
We stopped at a McDonalds to pick up breakfast on the way to our pickup point.  Don arrived promptly at 7 am.  We loaded our packs and poles into his car, we rode for about an hour to the trailhead where is picked us up two years ago.  It was a very scenic drive, with about 20 minutes of it climbing and descending on country dirt roads.
While we rode with him, we found out that he had grown up in the area of MD we now live in and went to school just one school away from where our kids went.  And like me, he was in the military and stationed in England the same time I was, but at a different base.  It was like talking to a home town person.

When he dropped us off, it was sunny and 51 degrees.  It was wonderful to be back in the woods, and the silence was sweet.  In the background was the low sound of water flowing down a nearby stream, the result of the last few days of rain.  After almost a mile, we came upon the Warspur Shelter, a fine shelter with a picnic table, a bench, and a privy.  Also a few nice tenting areas.  
On we went up the mountain for the next two hours.  We stopped at a strong flowing spring and topped off our water bottles.  Sometime later Woofie stopped abruptly at what she saw right on the trail.  “What’s that?” she said.  I picked them up: a nickel and a penny.  Looks like they’d been there a really long time.  I could’ve said, “What good eyes you have, Grandma,” but thought better of it.
When we finally reached the summit, we stopped for lunch and a rest at a perfect spot: open, grassy, and in the sun.  As usual, Woofie grabbed a few minutes of naptime before heading out.
From there the trail was mostly level, a flat plateau of fairly dense forest.  It was evident that no hikers had been through a quite some time.  The weeds and vines had grown to three of four feet tall and were covering the entire trail.  We had to push the briars away with our poles instead of using them to keep our balance.  It was hard to see what was going to be under the next footstep, so it was slow going, and there was nothing of interest to see.
We came to a nice stream, so we stopped and refilled all our bottles, pumping through the Katahdyn filter.  I’m glad we decided to stick with that water collection method.  Just beyond the stream we came to Wind Rock.  It gives a terrific view of the surround valley and distant mountains.  It attracts lots day hikers and other visitors and weekends because it’s close to a forest service road.

Just down the hill from Wind Rock was the road.  We decided to find a spot to setup the tent and stay there the night, since we were both very tired.  We found a perfect spot, clear, level, and soft, just a short way from the trailhead.  I fixed us a Mountain House meal.  While waiting for that to finish cooking, I found the perfect tree to hang the bear bag.  As it got dark, I hung the bag and climbed into the tent for the night.  Couldn’t have asked for a better day for hiking.","Trailhead at Rt 632

Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644688,"Upon waking up, the truth became evident.  At our age the extreme exertion of the previous day on our bodies, that had waited two years to return to trail, was too much.  Woofie doubted she’d be able to reach the next camp site.  It was a bitter pill to swallow.
Fortunately, since we’d camped near a trailhead, we could get shuttled back to our car.  There was a phone number posted at the trailhead for shuttle service, but when I tried calling, cell service to too poor to make a connection.
Just then some campers who’d spent the night at Wind Rock returned to their cars at the trailhead.  I asked them if they had a better cellular carrier than mine so I could request a shuttle, but they couldn’t call out either.  But then Emma and her male friend, both students at Virginia Tech, offered to shuttle us to the nearby Mountain Lake Lodge, where we’d be able to arrange a shuttle.  But then they said they needed to leave in 15 minutes, because they had to pick up a friend in time to get to V. T. football game that afternoon.
 


I had to get the bear bag down, pack our packs, and get the tent down and packed.  Woofie and I worked feverishly and managed to get packed up in those 15 minutes, a new personal record.
 


We rode in their car the four miles to the lodge, and they dropped us off there.  From there I could call for a shuttle.  Woofie and I were so thankful for the kindness of our two young trail angels.  We offered them some gas money, but they declined, saying that they had to pass the lodge on their way out anyway.

The Mountain Lake Lodge is a huge stone building, built in the 1800s.  It’s now a four-star hotel with a tavern, fine dining, and a pool.  It also has many outdoor attractions suitable for all family members.  And as it turns out, it’s the actual hotel known for “Dirty Dancing.”  Even though the movie setting was in the NY Catskills, this is the hotel the movie was based on.  If interested, it might be worth googling this place.  What an interesting place to wind up at by accident while just trying to get to town from the AT.
After waiting about half an hour, our HB Shuttles driver, Rocky Rob – Class of 2019 Thru Hiker, arrived to pick us up at 9:30 and took us back to Pearisburg, where our van was parked.  Our hike was done.","Mountain Lake Rd

Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644796,"When we first started our AT hiking adventure in 2014, we thought we could hike from Springer Mountain to Harpers Ferry in about three months.  But being only in our mid-60s, we were still young and foolish.  Having only reached Fontana Dam after a month of hiking, we knew it would take much longer to get to Harpers Ferry.  So our goal was to do a smaller section each year until we finally got there.
For our 2020 hike, we still had about 380 miles left but had set aside 10 weeks to cover the distance.  We worked out hard for many months to build our core and limb strengths.  We were completely ready to go the distance.  But that was last year.  And last year was the year Covid-19 closed everything down. 
Last year was also the year we celebrated our 50th wedding anniversary.  We’d planned to complete our hike and then do a cross-country road trip for about a month.  Instead, we sheltered at home for the whole year.  After finally getting vaccinated in April, we waited for the fall for life to return to normal so we could get back to hiking.
But this year I am 73 and Woofie is 74 years old.  We knew about the demands of hiking, but were surprised by the advancement of our own limitations.  Being idle for the last year was a factor as well. 
But we still like hiking and camping, so we’ll just have to adjust our plans to fit our capabilities.  If we skip the remaining section of the AT through northern VA with its difficult gains and losses in altitude, we can focus on the easier sections without mountains like those in MD and NJ.  We still have things to see, adventures to do, and miles to go.",,View Entry,"Oct 03, Sun",0
