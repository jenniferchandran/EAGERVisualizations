Navigator and Motivator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634696,"I remember clearly the night my husband asked if he could go hike the AT.  He was working a night shift and we were talking on the phone and I said if that's what you want to do of course you can.  He then suggested I research it before saying yes.  By the time he got home I had spent a lot of time learning what the AT was.  Still not really comprehending... he told me it would be 4 to 6 months and I said 'you can go,  but not without me.'  And that  night we started to plan for a thru hike.  That was 7 years ago, and we planned for 2021 as our year.  Seems like yesterday,  but time passes quickly. So plans were nebulous but created, and here we are.  Full of excitement and anxiety, but committed to try.  I am sure it will be full of ups and downs literally and figuratively but we are in this together so there is no place else I would rather be",,View Entry,"Apr 12, Mon",0
Navigator and Motivator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634697,"we played at hiking for a couple of years,  day hikes here and there as work schedules allowed.  We dreamed and planned and acquired gear only to decide we wanted something else.  But it was April 2019 and we finally had a chance to do an overnight in a local park.  We reserved a shelter and gleefully set out.  Because we were the only ones there we set the tent up in the shelter, but didn't put on the fly because we WERE in a shelter.  First real learning experience. A storm rolled in and rain was coming in sideways.  Navigator was quite unconcernedly sleeping when I  yelled at him to wake up because I was getting WET!!!  Always put the fly on.",,View Entry,"Apr 12, Mon",0

Navigator and Motivator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635745,"I didn't sleep well last night.   I couldn't wait to get moving.   We got up at 5:30 and were on the road at 6.  One final shower and load the packs in the truck and we took off.  We stopped and had breakfast at Waffle House (I have a weakness for the all star platter) and then there was nothing left to do but drive to the Springer Mountain trailhead parking.  A huge thank you to Mr Charles Nix for not only taking us, but waiting for us to walk the mile to the official start point so we could leave our packs until we were back.  We love you.  The first mile of course doesn't count, but we reached the official start point and took the obligatory photo.  Then back to the truck to get the packs and truly be on our own.  It was about noon when we started from the truck, and the beginning wasn't bad until I tried to adjust my straps while walking and promptly fell down.  Less than one mile and my knee is skint.  Oh well, I am sure there will be more; but I might have felt better if Navigator had tripped today as well.  No real pain but we did not get as far as I hoped because the 500 foot climb from the last gap kicked my butt.  So we found a beautiful place to pitch our tent, cooked dinner and now are settling in to watch the sunset and read.  We plan to read 2 chapters of the Bible for each mile we hike, with a proverb for breakfast.  Only downside is we are 5 miles from water, but we still have a liter each so we will be ok.  Until tomorrow","Springer Mountain

Navigator and Motivator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635883,"We are tired today.   Perhaps being our first night we were unwilling to sleep deeply.  We did not make it to an official camping area, setting-up the tent where the ground was level.   But I woke at 10:10 fully convinced it was about dawn.  Another surprise was the helicopters flying half the night.  Who would have thought?  So we broke camp early and were hiking at 7:30.  We had to get to water.  But it was a huge climb of 1000 feet up sassafras mountain first.  Needless to say we got water and all was well.  But we hiked very slowly today.  My hip flexors were telling me this wasn't a normal workout.   We stopped at a beautiful creek for lunch and water, then onward.  We arrived late to the camping area, and had to set the tent in the only open area.  Plus side the creek is burbling right next to us.  Bad thing is mosquitoes are out and we have no bug spray.   But we needed to stop here because the next 6 miles require a bear cannister or you can't stop.   We will make that tomorrow but there is also a 2000' climb over Blood Mtn, so probably not a lot of distance past the bear area.","Stealth site

Navigator and Motivator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635897,"today was interesting.   We started at a reasonable 9ish and went slow and steady to the peak of blood mountain.  Truly the views were spectacular.  And then although it sounds wrong, we began the much more difficult descent.  Going down was much worse than up.  There were sheets of rocks to traverse coming down and we went very slowly because it was my nightmare to fall and break a leg.  We finally got down and hit the local store at 2:30 and got pizza and soda.  This is also where the tree that people throw their shoes in when they quit the trail is.  We were feeling pretty good (soreness of the first 2 days is almost gone) so we pressed on to make it to a campsite a mile away.  And then disaster.   I took a wrong turn and in my rush to get back to the trail I managed to fall.  I am not in any pain but my ankle swelled almost immediately.   I don't think it is broke but just in case we came back down to a tent area behind the store.  Not where we were planning to be, but if I have to leave it will be easier to go from here, and I can get an ankle brace at the store if it isn't bad enough to get an x-ray done.  Hoping a good night's rest sees us ready to go in the morning","Lance creek

Navigator and Motivator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636978,"we started the day with a shuttle to the parking lot and set off in good spirits.  Immediately we started going up and over fairly rocky terrain.  Navigator suggested a fire road for easier travel, but my stubbornness said I am doing the trail.  So we finally reached the knob 4.5 miles later.  I am very afraid of heights, so there was no way I was getting out there, but Navigator was very willing to have a Pic made at what is called the most photographed location on the AT.  We didn't stay long as it was chilly and we weren't sure how my ankle was going to do.  We reached the first shelter .7 miles later and decided it was too soon to stop and honestly the terrain looked ok and 6 miles seemed doable....what a mistake.  There was a little 0.5 mile stretch called tinker's cliff where I seriously got on all fours to crawl because one slip and it was over the edge (did I mention my fear of heights?)  Of course our speed dropped to inches per mile which meant we didn't get to the shelter until about 7.  We set up the tent, cooked dinner and got our water filtered and then locked our food in the bear box.  They had bear activity here last weekend so hopefully there are no visits tonight.  It was overcast and cool all day so we climbed into our sleeping bags and did our reading, then lights out by 9.  It was a rough day but we made it!","McAfee Knob parking lot

Navigator and Motivator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636982,"I slept so hard last night that if there was a bear I didn't know it.  It got much colder than I expected, probably about 40, and I burrowed into the sleeping bag when I woke up and my ears were so cold I couldn't take it.  There was a slight slope so we slid a little downhill but overall a good night.  Everyone else at the campsite started making noise about 7 so we got moving too.  There was a lone section hiker staying in the shelter and 4 guys tenting near us.  My ankle is still very stiff but pain-free.  We took off and actually were moving well the first 2 hours, then we started climbing.  I had been in the lead, but Navigator had moved ahead for some reason I don't remember.  And then I heard him say oh, wow.  The picture is from that moment, and I had to sing a verse of How great Thou art just looking at God's marvelous creation.  We went to the Grand Canyon for our 20th anniversary and this was almost as awesome.  There was a lot more rock climbing today, and it is true what goes up must come down.  We took a wonderful lunch break- never would I have dreamed peanut butter on tortillas could taste so good, but the rock we sat on probably helped.  It is funny how being able to sit makes everything seem better, and is one of the luxuries I now appreciate.  We were making good time until I slipped on a loose rock.  I cannot fall again, so back to a crawl.  I was looking forward to a snack and break about 3, but we reached the power lines about then.  Hearing the high voltage made me very on edge, so we pushed on.  Unfortunately it was all downhill.  Serious stairs carved in the rock.  You would think downhill would be faster but it is actually harder.  But we dropped the 1000 feet and then paused for a snack.  We came to a railroad crossing and thankfully no train (I am not fast)  then relatively easy to the road crossing.  We stopped at the gas station for a Pepsi and Cheetos then to the hotel for a hot soak in the tub.  We plan to spend tomorrow figuring out logistics because I expect 2 or 3 weeks before my speed improves, so poor Navigator is having to rethink everything.  Thankfully my job is just to walk and get where I am told.","Lamberts Meadow shelter

Navigator and Motivator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637096,"My indecision will probably result in Navigators early demise.  I had planned to do nothing but rest and decide the next few days, but the trail is addictive.   We stayed at the hotel until checkout, and then took off.  We had already done the first 1.5 miles. So they don't count, but in all we did almost 10 miles.  Today was our first stile crossing.  Some of them are actual ladders, but both of the ones today were like the picture (definitely easier)  The Meadow was a nice walk but the sun was hot,  and then down the other side and back into the woods.  I had originally figured a short day and stop at the Fullhardt Knob shelter, but we got there at 2 and decided to move on. We did enjoy a snack there and conversation with 2 other thru hikers before leaving.  They plan to go much farther than us today.  We also saw the cutest little mouse hanging out at the shelter.  That is the biggest reason not to stay in one- those little buggers will chew anything.  We ended at our tent site about 5:30.  It was a 1000 foot drop the last mile, so pretty much I was done when we got to the bottom.  There was one section hiker there already, headed south, and he was helpful with info on water ahead.  I didn't leave the tent once it was set up, leaving Navigator to get the water and cook dinner (which means boiling water for the freeze dried meals), then hang the bear bag.  We read our chapters and played cards until dark, and now it is bedtime.","US 220

Navigator and Motivator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637105,"we settled in for a good night's sleep only to be awakened at 10 by a hiker looking for a place to put his tent.  We were exactly between shelters so I do not know why he moved on in the dark to our tent site.  But I am sure we got payback, because I was up before 6.  We ate breakfast, read our proverb and packed up.  We have to work around water, so the hiking is semi-planned.  As soon as we left camp we began to climb.  500 ft but we also came down  that much over about 1/2 mile, so a bit of a challenge.  The rest of the day was much easier, at least until a lizard ran across my foot and up a tree near me.  That was a quick stop.  And then a short while later a SNAKE.  My reverse works quite well when necessary.   Navigator moved it and on we went.  But I had to stop and let my heart rate decrease once I was far enough away.  We had planned to stay at a shelter but it is 1/4 mile off trail down a steep incline, so we are camping in a spot right off trail .1 mile from the shelter path.  We got here very early, and I am once again off my feet and feeling lazy.  But I can see the trail from my sleeping pad- we start with a wonderful staircase going up in the morning.  Because of water we will have a very short day tomorrow, but my foot will appreciate that.","Curry Creek

Navigator and Motivator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637296,"Today I woke up with a slight unease.  I must have been worrying about the climb at the start, but it really wasn't that hard.  I think the muscle I lost sitting for 10 days is finally back, and today was actually kind of fun.  We had the tent packed quickly and got to moving, because it was a little overcast and had dropped a few drops of rain as we started.  We were making really good time (1.5 mph) for a while but it was looking more ominous as time went on.  After the first hour we stopped to put on rain jackets and continued on.  We reached the creek and filtered water because there is no water for the next 7 miles.  Looking across at the view as we climbed up we saw the clouds below the top of the mountain.  Navigator has seen that before but I haven't.  We planned to eat lunch at the cove mountain shelter and made it there easily at noon.  We had the place to ourselves for about 20 minutes and then hikers began to drift in.  It is a beautiful shelter with lots of perfect tent sites and a privy.  But no water for 3 miles either way, so I don't know who really stays here.  The rain began to fall heavier, so we and 5 other hikers chose to stay until it passed.  I was cold at 55 degrees, and not moving wasn't good.  But about 2:30 it was light enough to move on and stopped soon after.  We took this Pic as we we're walking through the clouds,, but I don't know if it is obvious like it was inperson.  We made it to Jennings Creek at 4:30 and set up camp.  I am off my foot again, but the swelling is no worse than it was this morning.  I will not take Tylenol again unless it swells up again.  While I could have gone farther today this is a convenient place to be picked up in the morning and get a shower, do laundry and refill our food bags.  A dreary day but still wonderful.","Stealth camp MM748.9

Navigator and Motivator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637388,"today was a hard day but still fun.  We got up extra early and I did a little better moving.  We had several neat sites to pass today, the picture is me at the guillotine.  I reckon it has been there for a very long time so I wasn't too worried it would fall.  We had some amazing views as well.  It was a brisk 50 this morning so I kept my raincoat on until noon, but it never rained on us.  The sun came out and when you are moving it isn't really cold.  We were blessed to find trail magic at Petites gap.  A former thru-hiker Jaberwocky '09 had left a Rubbermaid container at the trail yesterday and it still had some chips and candy in it.  We finished the 1/4 bag of sour cream and onion chips and ate several York peppermint patties before moving on.  We also got to leave our trash.  What a wonderful pick me up to get us moving down the trail, as our next scenic site was highcock knob, roughly 500' up and then down over .4 miles.   I had to stop several times going up. But we made it.  We had a stream and tent site at the bottom of the descent, but filtered water and pushed on to our campsite.  We will not make the next shelter because I am still too slow, but it was time to quit.  We have to go 2 miles to water, and tomorrow is another scenic day, but will probably be short because water supply is low for a 9 mile stretch and I just don't think we can make the 16 miles we would have to do to get the next water source.   We are sure going to sleep well tonight.","Cornelius Creek Shelter

Navigator and Motivator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637433,"we were utterly exhausted last night and fast asleep by dark.  I woke up at 9:30 because something was moving outside the tent, but when I woke up Navigator it quit moving, so I went back to sleep.   We had discussed our plan for today, but you never know until you start moving, but due to no water for a 9 mile stretch we were going to stop at 7 miles near a creek before the waterless trek- in other words easy hike, no rush to get moving.  Somebody forgot to give that message to the whipporwhil that began loudly singing at 4:30.  It moved closer every 10 to 15 minutes until I thought it's next move would land it on our tent.  So by 5:30 I gave up any hope of sleeping and Navigator reluctantly got up and fetched our food bags (we try to be safe, but tonight we are just too tired to hang it).  We had wonderful breakfast (oatmeal and grits) and a candy bar for me then we packed up and set off. It was very easy terrain and I was managing 1.5 mph for 3 miles, then a skid on loose rocks wrenched my ankle a little.  We still made good time and reached the James River footbridge (longest foot traffic only bridge on the AT) which was followed by 2 more smaller footbridges before we began a 2 mile stretch to the shelter.   We stopped at the creek and ate lunch and knew we wouldn't make 9 more miles with the 3000' elevation gain- profile not actual up and downs.  So we ate lunch, drank a lot, filled our water bottles and started up the mountain.  We are 2 miles and 1500' above the shelter right now, but it was far too hot and tiring to go further.  We have 2 liters of water each to go 7 miles tomorrow, so we hope to get moving early while it is cool.  My ankle is more swollen than last night, so I am taking a Tylenol and will be asleep before the sun goes down.","Gunter Ridge Trail campsite

We stopped in the shade and ate lunch and filtered water.  In theory a break was a good idea, but a hour later it was very hard to move.  I dropped back to 1mph again.  It took a while to realize I needed an electrolyte mix added to my water.... anyway we crossed a really neat suspension bridge and reached our campsite right after.  We are the only ones here- everyone else made the shelter last night and are far ahead of us now.  But we have a wonderful river to listen to, water is plentiful and we have finished our reading and can barely keep our eyes open.","Little Rocky Row trail campsite

Putting the heavier pack on proved it was easier being lighter.   But we set up our tent, filtered water and collapsed.  Dinner was interesting.   We got pizza in a meal pack with a chemical pack to heat it in the bag.  I was hungry so it probably didn't taste that great in real life, but I would have eaten more if we had it.  Food and water are our biggest concerns.  I can say Navigator is starting to feel hungrier.  No more laughing at me.  The other thing of note was combing my hair.  I thought I must be getting dandruff and then realized it was salt.  More electrolyte mixes are necessary with this heat.  But for now we are once again comfortable near a river and finished reading and can't keep our eyes open.","Salt log gap

So a quick pickup and on if everything goes smoothly.  That means less weight to carry but an extra 0.5 mile to the car.

It was foggy and drizzly all day, and actual rain as well.  My rain pants are too big and I felt like Gumby walking in them, so eventually took them off.  It was cold. No need for electrolytes today.  But we still made great time.  I do like the trail here in the park.  Very smooth and gentle ups and downs compared to earlier (although maybe we are in better shape).  We passed a cemetery today.  You can see from the picture how foggy it is.  Visibility was 50 to 100 feet most of the day, but I think that was one of the better times when we were there.  We pushed on because once you are wet there is no reason to stop.  There were zero views today. In fact Navigator said it was spooky and I agree not seeing what is around you is scary. We did go to the Big Meadows wayside and get a sub sandwich.  Real bread was a treat and pushed us on to our resting place.  We also filled up with City water, so no filtering tonight!  It is not fun setting up the wet tent in the rain, but we managed.  And Navigator sat out in the cold rain to boil the water for my dinner.   It is still raining.  And currently 45 degrees and dropping.  Isn't it summer?  The food bags are hung on the pole and we have finished reading.  There are a lot of campers here.  Holiday weekend, although this would not be my choice of things to do on this rainy weekend.  The shelter has a lot of young people at it, and they are drinking, so we will stay well clear of them.

Navigator cooked our breakfast (oatmeal and grits) and we were quick to read and pack.  We were moving by 7, and anxious to get out of the park when the realization that we had to get the car hit.  It truly is a pain at this point.  We did get extremely lucky with that.  We made it to the Elkwallow Wayside and were able to get a ride back to the car.  The Wayside has a small store and grill, but it was too early to eat again. There was also a real payphone. You don't see those anymore. Remember when drop a dime meant call someone? Now it is $1.00 for 4 minutes.  The good weather today has people moving in the park.  And it was beautiful today.  Clear and not too hot.  Perfect for hiking.  But we had to get the car.  So we drove on to Front Royal and went into Mountain Trails outfitter.  Not only did I get a pair of boots I think will work for my feet but they run a comfort area called Basecamp for hikers.  Free shower and laundry with loaner clothes to wear and towels and everything.  It was so nice to be clean and in clean clothes.  We also washed and dried the tent so we are in a much better mood now.  We decided to just get a hotel room tonight and sleep, and we will shuttle back and walk back to the car in the morning.  A slack pack will finish this section and put us in a good position to hit the next section which will bring us to the WV border.   For tonight I am watching real TV and thinking about the soldiers who died to give us the freedom we enjoy.  It is a sad day which too many people just look at as a day off.  I am grateful my Navigator made it home safely each time he left, and God has granted us this time together to grow closer to Him and each other.","Pass Mountain Hut

All. Night. Long. So I was not in the best of moods to start the morning.  But oatmeal and a Proverb helped me readjust my attitude.  We packed up and got moving.  The first obstacle we found was about 50 feet of rocks to balance over at the stream we slept next to.  I think it took me about 5 minutes to get across.  Then another just like it in .6 miles.  So far so good.  Then we hit Ashby Gap.  Time for frogger again.  4 lanes (with median) and these cars were MOVING.  We made it across, but we had to hustle.  Now my left foot is doing OK but the right is complaining.   The new boots are putting pressure on the outside of my right ankle and by lunch it was swollen and red.  But I am jumping ahead.  After crossing the road we entered the Sky Meadows State Park.  No camping here which is why we stopped yesterday.   A wonderful 1000' climb made me decide this was the kiddie roller coaster.  At the top was a huge Meadow and we walked across it forever.  It is threatening rain, and there is a bench here somewhere... we finally found it but it was occupied.  At least there was a nice log nearby to sit and have a snack.  It was sprinkling a little, but we were hot so no raincoats.  It stopped as we went under a power line.  I hate being near those.  You can hear the electricity, and feel it.  We pushed on to a nice log for lunch, and my right foot was on fire.  It honestly made the broken one feel normal.  We kept moving.  We stopped at Manassas Gap shelter for a snack and water refill.  Meaning I sat on a log and changed socks while Navigator went down and got water.  I feel so useless, and he really takes care of me.  He asked if we should stay but I stubbornly wanted the next shelter.  And it was overcast but not raining....  we went under I 66 and then across railroad tracks.   Into the woods again.  There was a copperhead on the trail which Navigator moved with a stick.  And then a huge climb which we were 1/3 up when the rain started.  And at 2/3 up my blood sugar plummeted.   Thank goodness for energy gels.  At least the rain stopped and we finished the climb and found another bench.  A 15 minute rest and onward.  We finally made the shelter.  It is very nice.  But we are too exhausted to care.  Tent is up and we ate oatmeal because I am shockingly not that hungry right now.  My feet hurt and I took an Aleve and am crashing.  I wanted to hit Front Royal in time to ride the trolley to town, but doubt we can do the 5 miles by 9:20, and the next one is 2:20.  Depends how we feel in the morning.","Stealth camp

Not one mile or less.  And we did make good time, just not quite enough because it rained some on the descent and I am super cautious when it rains.  It is 5 weeks since the break, and it feels good, but I have little mobility in the ankle.  I will start stretching it at night in a few days.  I am backing off the vitamins because it feels healed.  Just stiff.  The right foot is not happy with the boot.  Too tight around the lower leg.  I did fine with not lacing it all the way up, but that defeats the purpose of a boot.  Footwear is my biggest challenge.  Why can't I find my Salomon x mission 3 shoes anymore?  So we made the US 522 and of course terrible cell reception.  AT&T is not the best choice out here.  So we began walking towards town with thumb out.  We got picked up .5 mile later and taken into town.  Where Navigator got in touch with an Uber driver who would come get us and take us to Harper's ferry.   We just had to wait for him to pick us up.  We were at the town park and charged phones and used the restrooms.  And of course the hiker dream of getting rid of trash. And Navigator walked to the store to get cold Pepsi 's for us.  The driver arrived and we set off.  It was farther than I thought.  We hit the trail about 2 in the hot sun, going across the Shenandoah River.  It is a nice sidewalk with a concrete barrier to traffic.  Then down steps and under the bridge.  Of course we had an immediate climb up.  Water is scarce for a while, so we filled up at the creek  and set off.  It was a steep 1000' climb and then level.  We are crossing back and forth between VA and WV.  We also had one road crossing.  Just as I worked up courage to run across a funeral procession came by.  It brought to mind the last funeral I went to.  I still miss my Dad. And then we got lucky because as we were crossing a truck came around the curve and stopped for us. The storms evidently came through here because the leaves are washed into piles on the trail.  The flat walk should have been easy, but on the ridge it is rocky.  So not hard, but not fast.  My left leg has some redness and swelling in it and I am concerned about cellulitis so we quit early and I have started an antibiotic to be safe. Probably don't need it but not taking chances.  We wanted to make the shelter.  Supposedly they have a picnic table at each tent site, but that is a few miles away and it was better to rest and relax a while.  But it is nice to be able to sit.  I haven't been able to sit properly since I broke the ankle, but soon I will be able to.  So I get to lay in the tent and watch Navigator do everything.  Right now we are 16 miles from the car, so we will see if we make it tomorrow.   At least it is not too hot, the cicadas are a little quieter (meaning we can hear the birds again) and the sun is shining.  Life is good.","Jim an Molly Denton shelter

I am glad we finished it, and I never want to do it again.  We also crossed a road.  We were lucky it was Sunday, because the speed limit is 60, and I think the drivers considered that a suggestion.... we got across and walked down the road about 50 yards before going back in the woods for the final climb.  I had dreams of not being sweaty but that didn't happen either.  We got in the car and started towards Harper's Ferry.  Inspiration struck and we had time, so we went to Waffle House.  I love the All-star breakfast.  And we got semi washed while waiting to get seated.  Waffle House is packed on Sunday morning. And we made it to church!  We went to First Baptist in Charles Town, and heard a great sermon on Jonah.  I was just glad to be in God's House to worship with other believers.  Although we will be glad to get back to our First Baptist when we get home.  After church we went to the AT conservancy and registered.  They number you based on how you hike.  Straight NOBO (northbound all the way) Flip floppers- the ones doing half one way, then the other half.  Of course SOBO (southbound from Katahdin) haven't started yet.  And then there was us.  We are special because we started at Springer and then flipped up because of my broken ankle.  So officially we are #3 and 4 in that category.  We got cool official tags and our picture taken.  And then we went to REI for gear.  We both got new shoes, and new sleeping pads.  No more deflating while I sleep.  REI refunded the price of my defunct pad since we bought it 7 weeks ago, which is a good reason to buy gear there.  Navigator is complaining about his knee today.  He strained it when the dog attacked.  I am still livid about that.  So we settled into a hotel to get clean and relax.  We have a microwave so we went to Target right up the road and got Pizza rolls for dinner.   And a salad.  And a block of cheese. I also got blueberries to pretend I am eating healthy.  And we finished with hot chocolate.  My appetite is not diminished.  Navigator matched me for eating, so I don't feel bad. We stocked up on stuff like Neo-sporin,  antacids, and ibuprofen. And it seems silly, but Q-tips.  It is one of those things you don't consider until you want them and don't have them.  I also got new water bottles.  I use the Fiji water bottles because they aren't as tall as the smart water bottles and my elbows don't hit them as I hike. And it really tastes good (as does filtered stream water).  I really don't miss soda like I thought I would. So we are going to enjoy a rest and drop the car so we can get back to hiking.","Stream

We finally branched off the bike path and crossed the railroad tracks.  No train then, bit we saw it about 10 minutes later.... we also crossed a road. No traffic.  And then got started on the dreaded climb.  The feed bags are full, so packs are heavy.  We crossed under a big road and kept going up.  About 1000' in all.  And then level but rocky before our descent.  There was one snake of the non poison variety that heard us coming and rushed off the trail. Evidently I jump pretty high when I see one.  We finally reached the shelter.  It is almost 4 miles to the next one and I will not make it.  We are in Maryland now, and no camping except designated areas, so it was better to quit than push on and be cooking in the dark.  There is a little thunder but the cicadas are quieter. It is definitely time to sleep. We finally have completed 1 of 14 states on the trail (WV) and somehow I never saw the border marking on the bridge, but the river is the border. So even a slow start had a plus side.","House

Navigator and Motivator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638886,"We had a busy day today.  It thundered and lightening last night, but the rain never came.  I am not sure I like my new sleeping pad but at least it didn't deflate.  I woke up with a sore back.  Maybe from carrying the heavy bag, but I have done that before and not hurt the next morning.  At least Navigator is good with it, and I am happy we are on the same level now-his old pad was thinner by 1.5 inches. So we ate, read and packed in an effort to beat the heat and rain.  It was overcast all day, so not that hot, but it was so humid everything is wet and will not dry.  My bandana I wipe sweat with has been soaked all day.  We went through Gath state park and it was nice to have restrooms,, water spigot and benches.  And neat buildings to look at..  I didn't have the energy to walk around and read but several were used during the civil War as command posts.  What I think was remains of a church was built in 1887 and was huge with about 2 foot thick walls all made of stone.  We passed the empty tomb just before getting here- Mr. Gath never used it.  We made good time this morning and got to the shelter for lunch at 10 miles.  It was .3 off trail but I wanted to sit at a real seat.  We stayed a while so I could rest my foot.  Lunch was good, tuna wraps with Catalina dressing.  And the beef and cheese stick.  Plus some yogurt covered strawberries.   Yes, still thinking about food.  So we finally left the shelter and about .1 down the trail ran into a young man who said there was trail magic ahead.  We of course weren't really hungry, but it did encourage us to move faster. We passed some power lines and finally reached a cooler of cold drinks left by Big Rig 2020.  I drank a root beer and we had m&ms and there was a bag for the trash.  It was very nice.  We continued on and .8 later more magic.  A man with pizza's and Gatorade was at the campground picnic area in the state park we were walking through.  Not even hungry, but 2 slices and a drink.  Plus a bathroom.  It even had free showers, but in this humidity what is the point? I did wipe down and rinse my hair in the sink.  So we stayed too long, but it was nice.  We pressed on, and crossed the road and our next point of interest was the original Washington monument.   It was worth going off trail to see.  Lots of signs along the way to read, and the view from the top was incredible.  And benches to sit on.  I am solely responsible for our inability to reach the goal we had set.  After the monument we had several road crossings.  The trail actually went between 2 houses and behind one of them and then we went over I-70 on a footbridge.  The trail continued along the interstate and under the next 4 lane road.  It was still possible to get to our goal of Annapolis rocks, but my feet were tired and we came to the shelter instead.  Another 1.7 was possible but I worry about the storms tonight and want a shelter close by in case it gets bad.  We have eaten, washed up and now are ready to read and sleep.  No snakes today, but the guy at the shelter last night is here and he saw a bear there shortly after we left this morning.  Kind of jealous because we haven't seen one yet, but then again that is ok.  We can still hear traffic from the interstate but the cicadas are finally quiet, so that evens out.  Thunder just started.  Might be a rough night.","Ed Garvey shelter

Navigator and Motivator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638998,"It rained last night.  Just before dark we got a third magic.  The couple in the near tenting area had leftover food and offered to share- fresh oranges and packages of cheese nips.  Navigator went over and got them and got back just as the rain started.  There was some lightning and thunder but I slept pretty well despite it.  But we woke up to a wet tent, and little desire to get moving.  But we can't just sit here, so pack up and move.  Of course we started with a climb, which is why I quit last night.  After the climb and short drop, the trail was pretty level and smooth.  We were gently going down and making good time. A tree randomly fell in the woods as we were hiking.  I guess one more potential hazard out here. And then we went back up to the ridge and the rocks.  The picture shows what we were climbing over.  I swear orthopedic doctors invent the trail path to get more patients.  It was threatening rain, but held off until we were done with the rocky area.  It began to sprinkle.  That was ok.  We were 2 miles from the shelter, so I was determined lunch would be at a table out of the weather.  I even told Navivator how good it was we got off those rocks before the rain.  Call me stupid, because we found more.   And of course it was raining very hard at that time.  In fact the water was ankle deep running down the trail.  We finally crossed a road and .2 uphill found the shelter.  I took off my shoes and socks, but nothing is going to dry.  And the rain stopped just as we got there.  Others had the same idea so we had 7 of us eating lunch here.  After an hour we set out again.  Weather said maybe 1/4 inch more rain, but it is too soon to quit.  So off we go 500' climb and then fairly level but rocky.  We went through a hayfield that had been cut maybe 2 weeks ago.  All good.   We went through a tree line into the next field which wasn't mowed yet.  Just at the tree line there was a group of boy scouts resting and getting ready to hike.  Their leader was encouraging them to prepare to get wet.  And get wet we did.  Not 5 minutes later the thunder began and rain started.  We had to cross a power line and I was not happy going under the lines in ankle deep water with thunder.  We saw a turtle going up the next hill with his head in the water.  I thought he was dead, but tucked in when Navigator tapped him.  Just thirsty I guess. We also saw a couple of little snakes and a lot of frogs.  We reached a creek which was supposed to be small but all the rain had it flooding.  We got across (we can't get any wetter) and got to the road.  And one last 800' climb to the shelter.  We had planned to stay in the shelter tonight but there were 4 people already here.  It is a double decker, but my ankle wouldn't climb that ladder.  And the people already here rudely did not make any effort to clear space so we could put packs down and sit.  So we put up the tent.  It is wet, but we are fairly dry and in dry clothes.  We had dinner and the feed bags are on the bear line.  The boy scout group is here.  They have a fire and I hope they are having a good time. Time to read and snuggle into the sleeping bag.   Tomorrow's high is only mid 60's so good hiking weather but more rain expected.  At least we will be out of Maryland tomorrow.","Pine knob shelter

Navigator and Motivator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639058,"So as miserable as the weather is, we stayed warm and relatively dry.  The packs are soaked and so are our shoes.  I carry more socks than I should, but even dry socks don't stay dry in wet shoes.  We read our proverb before breakfast, which meant I didn't hold it in my head when we started hiking.  After brushing teeth and eating we grabbed our packs and left them at the shelter so we could go back for the tent.  We wound up picking the whole tent up and carrying to the shelter to disasemble.  The women who wouldn't make room last night were still in the shelter and I didn't care if we were disturbing them.  Packing a wet tent SUCKS.  It is very heavy and we know we need to get it dry so it doesn't mildew.  But it is still misty and going to rain all day.  Nothing to do but head out.  We made very good time after the initial rocky area. I am proud to say almost 2 miles in 45 minutes. Which is great when the wet pack weighs about 35#.  We are buying pack covers next chance we get.  Water is heavy, and I am sick of being wet.  We never got any views today.  The first big thing was PenMar park.  Real bathrooms and trash cans. Carrying trash is a small thing, but every ounce you get rid of is a good thing.  We sat at a picnic table under a pavilion and had a snack, then pushed on.  Next point of interest was the MD and PA border on the Mason Dixon line.  The mailbox on the northern side had suckers in it.   I took a green one and only after it was gone did I question if they had a hidden meaning.  We crossed railroad tracks again and a footbridge over a roaring creek.  All this rain has water in the creeks, so no water issues for a few days.  Right after the bridge we started climbing.  500 feet steep and rocky.  And descended a lot gentler than the climb.  After that it was very flat and a gradual slope down.  We ate lunch sitting on a rock right before it began raining harder.  We crossed several roads.  One was a 4 lane with no median that took about 5 minutes of waiting to get a clear rush across.  I am moving well on my ankle considering, but I hate the stress of crossing traffic.  And while my ankle is better I suspect a stress fracture in my metatarsal, and my 3rd toenail on that foot is about to come off. But I am not quitting. We have crossed a second state off- Maryland is done.  We are currently in the shelter.  The shelter here is a pair- one for snorers and one for non-snorers.  We set up in the snoring one and so far look like we have it to ourselves.  I just could not put that wet tent up.  So we spend our first night in a shelter.  Mice are a big issue in shelters, so all foodstuff is hung on the bear pole. I will sleep with my Bible because if they chewed on that I would be very upset.  If they want the toilet paper more power to them.  Tomorrow we are going to get a shuttle to town to stay in a hotel and get clean and dry everything.  Plus side is we will get to a church again this week.  And pick up enough food to get to Duncannon, where we walk right past several places to eat.  It is still raining and the shelter is dry and no bugs because it is in the 50's.  We should sleep well. And by the way, we crossed the 400 mile mark (for us) today!","Raven rock shelter

Navigator and Motivator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639129,"I could almost get used to sleeping in the shelter.  We had it to ourselves and we were dry.  The privy wasn't too far and I only woke up twice to worry about mice.  We ate breakfast and read our proverb, and packed up.  No tent to pack meant extra quick.  We have a hotel reservation so the sooner we get moving the sooner we get clean and dry.  Our shoes are wet, and putting on wet clothes was no fun either.  But we are going to get clean! It is Saturday which is obvious by all the day hikers out.  Their shoes aren't wet.  At least it is not raining.  Although it is still cloudy and when the wind blows the water drips from the trees like rain.  Sad news was a murder/suicide on the trail yesterday early morning.  We hiked through there that day, and that night a father killed his 2 year old son and then committed suicide.  It is sad enough to take his own life but his child? Prayers for that mama, and the whole family.  We made our way to get picked up and taken to our hotel.  We set the tent in the parking lot and dried it as soon as we got checked in.  Priorities, right?  Actually I couldn't take a shower and put wet shoes back on, so we did chores first.  We were going to eat at KFC but the lobby is closed, so we went a little further to Perkins.  I guess it is kind of like an IHOP.  I had breakfast... 3 eggs. Bacon, sausage, potatoes French toast and pancakes.  I cleaned the plate.  They say don't grocery shop when you are hungry.  Our next stop was Dick's.  No pack covers. We will try the outfitter in Duncannon.  And then walmart for food.  My feed bag is too heavy once again.  Being well-fed did not stop my impulse buying of more food than I need.  But what if I get hungry? (Big joke, I am hungry all the time)  We also bought rodent repellent because it is going to rain a lot next week and if there is space it will be easier to not have a wet tent. We are clean and dry, but time has gotten away and we have not arranged our transport to church or back to the trail yet.  We will just get up earlier to take care of it.  We also took no pictures today, so I hope you appreciate the rushing creek we crossed the other day.","Rocky mountain shelters

Navigator and Motivator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639235,"So poor planning led to a bad day.  We stayed up too late, and did not wake up early enough. The good news is this hotel had breakfast (all the rest have not because of covid) so I drank orange juice,  ate a bowl of raisin bran, had 2 eggs with cheese and a raspberry yogurt.  I also finished half of Navigator 's Waffle since he wasn't going to finish it.  We then tried to call the church, but when we finally got an answer we were 10 minutes too late to get added to the pickup list.  We tried to get an Uber, but no luck.  So we did not get to go to church.  We did watch their service online until we had to check out.  A good sermon about Jacob's name being changed to Israel.  Wish we had gotten it all.  So we finally got a shuttle to pick us up and go to the trail.  Turns out he was an Uber driver.  Just not in service somehow this morning.  They are calling for storms this afternoon so we planned a short hike to the next shelter.  We just got dry and didn't want to get wet again.  We reached the shelter very early and set up our sleeping pads.  It was nice to visit with other hikers as they came in.  We thought everyone was going to tent until a late arrival came in at 6:30.  Oh well,  plenty of room.  Sad thing is the rain has not happened yet. Navigator hung our feed bags.  And we walked towards the privy.  A rattlesnake is curled up about 4 feet off the path.  He is not moving, so I watched him carefully.   We crawled into our beds at 8.  We have 19 miles planned tomorrow, so we are getting up early.","Shippensburg rd

Navigator and Motivator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639236,"Last night was totally miserable.  The kid who slept in the shelter with us was not a good companion.   He is ultra light, and only had a liner to sleep in, so he got up several times to move around to get warm.  And he had a very squeaky air mattress.   I slept very badly, and Navigator didn't do much better.  We got up at 5, and I knew I was ready to leave.  We ate and packed, brushed teeth and went towards the privy.  The snake is still there.  He is fat, so I guess he is digesting.  Turns out there was a man in the privy who didn't bother to shut the door (I know it is dark in there, but come on!) And he didn't leave a pole outside to announce the privy was occupied.  I think I can wait. We only had 3.5 miles to a state park, and we used their facilities and filled water bottles.  Bad news is another rattlesnake in the trail about .2 from the shelter.  He didn't even warn me, and I almost stepped on him. I jolted my ankle badly jumping back.. and it has been not quite right all day. Navigator used a fallen branch to push him off trail and we continued on. The state park was great- paved trails to walk on. The snack bar isn't open til 11 so no lunch for us.  We made great time this morning and made the first shelter for lunch.  We didn't go to it because it is .2 off trail.  I was so exhausted I stretched out and took a 20 minute nap.  I woke up much refreshed and ready to go.  We did great the first hour.  We crossed railroad tracks...a train was coming so we ran to cross before we got stuck. The engineer waved at us.  It wasn't that long, but we still have 7 miles to go.  And then the rock mazes started.  Literally you pick a path over huge boulders.  There were places I am glad I can do a pull up in (because that was the only way to climb) and just before the second maze the guy from the shelter caught up.  He plans to sleep in the shelter again, so I will not.  We had 2 miles to go, but it was a rough trek.  Up and down in what looks like a mini roller coaster. And I am tired, but we got to the tent area and got set up just as the rain started.  It is pouring now, and I hate we will have a wet tent, but sleep is really important.  And that kid was up and down all night.  You can be too light.  And he will be colder tonight because the temp has dropped about 15 degrees since the rain started.  We are warm and dry.  We have 18 miles tomorrow because we are passing through Boiling Springs and there is no camping until the next shelter.  At least it is a flat walk after a small climb and 700 foot drop. We will make it.  Especially with a good night's rest. Saw another turtle today too.  He must be waiting for the rain.","Tom's run shelter

It was encouraging for me.  We went across some footbridges and crossed a road into a hay field.  The farmer had bush-hogged the path, but it was growing back and about 8"" high, which meant wet shoes.   Not to worry-town food awaits.  But somehow I was 3 miles from town when I had to eat something.  I ate 2 slim Jim's and some mini carrot muffins.  Town food is waiting.   And that is when it got rocky.  Steep down over huge rocks cut into uneven steps when we were lucky. We finally got safely down and to a parking area with a portapotty which we used, and a trash can we also took advantage of.  Then on to the hot walk down the road.  First stop was a gas station for a Pepsi.  Then on to the outfitter/hostel for resupply.  It is right on trail so convenient, but basically they stock walmart food and mark it up horrendously.  And no way I am paying $1 for a package of oatmeal *I blessedly have enough breakfast food.  We got enough for 2 days dinner and lunch and moved on.  The famous Doyle hotel was next, but somehow I didn't care to get a cheeseburger where the bar is the biggest draw.  We decided to move forward to the Pilot which is .2 off trail but had subway and the snacks we still needed.  We crossed a busy road to get there- if the median hadn't been there we would never have made it.  And sat at a booth with an outlet to charge phones.  We each ate a footlong sandwich, and I had chips.  We utilized the restrooms to wash up, and picked up candy bars and snacks. We only had a few miles to the shelter, and a 800 foot climb. So no rush, I thought.  But traffic had increased at 4:45 when we left.  We finally got across the road again and back on trail.  First thing was a very long sidewalk across a river.  I am glad there was a concrete barrier to the traffic. And then bad luck- we had to cross the off ramp for the road and then railroad tracks.  And a train was coming so we had to wait.  It was fairly long, but at least we were in the shade waiting.  It finally ended and we got moving.  We now had 2 miles to go.  Should have taken an hour, maybe 1.5 since I am pleasantly not hungry.  Not so.  There were huge rocks at the top of that climb.  Words cannot describe how difficult it was.  I know my feet were tired, and I amnot the most mobile yet, but it was awful.  At one point I was holding onto a rock and trying to get my toes to the rocks ledge a good 3 feet below me.  And if I slipped it was a long drop down.  I never want to see this spot again.  I crawled on hands and knees in spots.  Not fun at all.  But we made it.  3 hours later.  We are in the tent and not even reading because it is dark and everyone here is already asleep.  We will have to make it up at lunch tomorrow.   By the way, the picture is actually not the bad area.","Darlington shelter

That was ok. We did our normal routine of breakfast, brush teeth and read then started packing up.  It is hard to believe how much we actually carry in our backpacks until we get it all out at night.  Our tent is full! So we got moving and of course more rocks.  My feet are not happy.  We did reach some smoother sections, but by then my feet were screaming at me to just stop.  We had one view under the power lines that was cool.  There is a rock wall behind where the picture was taken that had graffiti on it.  A section hiker had climbed up there for a better view-more power to him.  My feet hurt.  But after we passed I wished I had taken his picture up there.  He looked like an ant.  So we went back in the woods and it was smoother for a while.  We reached the shelter but didn't stop for lunch yet.  There is water there but it is 300 feet down stone steps (meaning irregular difficult steps) and we don't need it so we moved on.  We ate lunch about an hour later.  It did not compare to Subway yesterday.   Was it only yesterday? And then it got hot.  And rocky.  And a big descent.  We crossed a road and there is the creek.  We decided to just set up camp.  We went up the trail to look for a spot but there was nothing.  So we came back to a gas line and are set up on it.  It is smooth and we went back to the creek for water.  I soaked my feet for a while.  Very cold but they do feel better now.  Navigator soaked his too.  We then came back to the tent and are eating and reading.  There was another hiker at the stream who decided to camp near us on the gas line. Bad news is there are some locals at the road who have set up camp. They have a couple of kids and I expect them to have a campfire. I doubt they go to sleep anytime soon.

Warm oatmeal (navigator is amazing) and Proverbs 31 helped my attitude.   We got packing and ready to go.  I have had issues with my backpack not sitting right for a while.  I thought my backache was from the sleeping pad,  but when we got the new pads I let Navigator take all of the tent and I was carrying his sleeping pad.  Close on weight, so I thought not a problem. Today he took his pad and I took my part of the tent.  Huge difference.  I was able to maintain 2mph all morning.  And no foot or back pain today.  The little things.  Balance the weight correctly.   So our morning started with a climb.  There was an old mineshaft about halfway up, but I don't want to find out what may be living in there (bears, snakes, bats?) So we kept climbing. A few miles later we passed a clearing with a random mailbox.  There was a sign that said Yellow Springs Village site, but nothing was there.  We kept on to the Rausch Gap shelter for lunch.  I had set my heart on eating at a picnic table, but it was  .3 off trail, so I sat near the path.  I do better in the afternoon if I rest, so we stayed about 45 minutes.   We crossed the creek and then it was decision time.  Continue forward and cross a beaver day or take the alternate which is .8 longer.  We chose the swamp.  It was not too bad.  My feet stayed dry, but there was no rushing through the 150 yards of swamp.  We had another 600' climb right after and of course we went right back down about 1000' to a nice field and then a stream.  It was flowing great.  There was a huge tree down across it, and somebody put a board to balance to the tree base, but the tree was too high up to get off on the other side.  So we had to drop off the tree and scramble over rocks the rest of the way.  And then my proudest moment.  Navigator was filtering water, and I chose to move on because he will catch me easily.  But there was another creek and the trail turned to go under a bridge, while another trail went straight.  I almost waited, but he never messes up, so I went on.  I kept looking back and he wasn't there, and then I saw him on the other side of the road.  I yelled at him and he crossed over to get back on the right trail.  One shining moment when I have turned the wrong way so many times (which is also how I broke my ankle).  We were watching clouds roll in so decided to stop before our goal.  Of course the rain didn't come as quick as I was afraid it would, so we are snug in our tent and have eaten, and sadly will have another climb in the morning after we cross I-81.  We get to hear traffic tonight, and storms should be here around midnight, so maybe not going to sleep that well tonight.","Stealth camp

Not sure why, but the rocks probably have a part.  We reached the William Penn shelter and I had to go sit for lunch,  even if it is .1 off trail.  It is a cool 2 story shelter.  There was a father/daughter there enjoying a hike and overnight.  I loved the chance to sit.  And then we took off.  And something about that rest was what I needed because I was much faster after.  We saw some views, but the greatest thing was the trail magic at a road crossing.  A young man had passed us before lunch, and these were his parents.  Ice cold Pepsi, homemade cookies, oranges and a trash sack.  Perfect.  Thank you to 'that guy's parents.  We continued to the water source and the rain that was threatening all day started.  But we now have pack covers! So we covered up and kept on.  Past the 501 sheltet- you can order pizza delivery there which if not for the trail magic would have really tempted me.  The guy from last night caught up there.  We never saw him in front of us, so not sure how he got behind us.  And he is much faster than us.  Which was a shock to see him approaching us .4 miles from our camping area. He got water and turned around again.  Now I understand why he hiked in so late.  Lesson of the day is there are always big rocks to traverse when it says there is a view.  Always.  And if I never see another view that might be ok.","Stealth camp

Navigator and Motivator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639629,"Happy Father's day.   I cherish one of my earliest memories of my Dad.  I had my shoes on the wrong feet and he sat on the bed with me to show me how to tell left from right.  I said I understood, but really didn't.   I think I was 3.  Who knew all these years later I would obsess over shoes.  But they are very important to being able to hike.  My new ones are 2 weeks old today and already coming apart.  TOPO may be ok, but these rocks are harsh and I will need yet another new pair soon.  We got up and moving slow. The wrong way guy was just getting up when we left and we never saw him again.  We started with a 500 foot climb.  Get the heart pumping and all.  And then it was relatively flat for miles.  Note: flat does not mean easy.  Between rocks and mud it took 2 hours to go 4 miles to our first point of interest.   The Fort Dietrich Snyder monument.   Navigator knows history, so I got a lesson on the French and Indian War.  We didn't stay long.  I slipped on a rock crossing the creek and wrenched my back first thing this morning.  And then I did another crazy slip and hurt it again.  And 5 miles into the hike I stopped to ask about direction and Navigator plowed into me making it a Tri-fecta for me today.  Again I was not fast.  We finally stopped for lunch near the shelter (not walking that .3) and back to the rocks and mud.  What wasn't rocky was nasty with mud all day.  And you could see where people slid in the mud. So I wasn't rushing.  We were planning to stay at the last tent site before the Port Clinton Rd, but we missed the trail to the last water source.  Only 4 miles to town.  I said, let's go, but I had no concept of how rough the going would be.  The last 1000 foot drop was killer.  Very steep.  But we managed.  Then over the railroad tracks, across the bridge and we hit a road with a hiker friendly house where they let you use their water spigot to fill up.  On the way there was a random soda machine on the sidewalk.  It worked! I am so glad I had 2 dollar bills.  Cold Pepsi.   The highlight.  We got our water and  continued down the road to a tenting area sponsored by a local church.  We are snug in the tent, finished eating and the rain is pouring down.  Drowns out the traffic noise.  Not what we planned, but where we are.  Tomorrow we will see.  For tonight we are exhausted so not going to get the reading completed.  Just a chapter or 2 before lights out.","Hertline camp site

We caught up on reading and finally packed up.  The Cabella's store runs a shuttle van out to the camp area and we took the opportunity to visit the largest Cabella store and Walmart for resupply. They had a sale on MTN House meals, so I got my dinners for the next week.  Now the bags are too heavy again.  We tried to get a hotel room tonight but the Microtel has no vacancy tonight.  So we shuttled back and began climbing.  It was miserable and I am sick of being dirty.  There were more storms coming so we made the call to find a room.  We are currently in a room with an actual key to the door. I didn't think there were any left like this. The motel is old but clean and comfortable.  And the thunder and lighting outside make me glad we got off trail.  Water should be good for a day or two with all this rain.  And we are clean and safe from the storm.","Port Clinton pavilion

So they really do exist, and I had given up hope of seeing one.  So I still am not happy to be getting back to the trail, but there are moments you won't forget. We at least have pack covers now, so we slog on through the rocks and muck and to be honest the views in PA aren't that great.  The first few times it was quaint seeing farms below, but somehow just doesn't compare to mountains as far as the eye can see.  At least the rain cleared before we set up the tent.  It is going to be cold tonight and I just want to go to sleep.","Mahoning inn

Navigator and Motivator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639830,"I woke up with a headache and it just wouldn't go away all day.  There was a late arrival last night making it 3 tents total.  I never really consider ours to be big, but the other 2 are really small in comparison.   There was a generator running all night on the tower near us.  Constantly cutting on and off all night long.  There was also great bug TV last night.  We even had a few lightning bugs to spice it up.  We had breakfast and did all the usual morning things, then packed up and started down the trail.  The theme today was once again......Rocks.  I managed 2 miles the first 2 hours.  Totally ridiculous.  It never got much better all day.  Highlight was wild blueberries on the trail, which I enjoyed eating.  We reached the first shelter and my head hurt bad enough I might have stayed, but this one is literally on the trail, and no privy.  We have passed several day hikers already, so I chose to push forward.  Of course there is a big drop down.  Through rocks.  Navigator stopped to get water and I kept moving at my snail pace.  I saw an older couple (I keep forgetting that now most of these kids would refer to us that way) and could tell there was something ahead.  As I got close I asked if there was a snake; and yep. Snake.  So a slight delay for it to move.  Then continue down the rocks.  Navigator caught up easily and we reached the road.  Finally a break to get across (it is almost lunchtime) and then we got to cross the bridge over the Lehigh River.  It was a long walk in the hot sun and even with a concrete barrier I do not care for large trucks passing by so close and shaking the bridge.  When we got to the other side we walked down the road towards a traffic light where we were supposed to cross, but we saw the trail and managed to get across before we went that far up the road.  Now it was time for the climb.  We elected to take the blue trail which is .5 mile longer but not as steep.  Probably would have been fine, but caution is not a bad thing.  We were on the flat trail walking towards Palmerton when we found a shady place to eat.  We were passed by 2 hikers we had seen yesterday.  They had went to town and were going back for the big climb.  I would have been too lazy to walk back that far.  Never saw them again.  We finished eating and kept down the gravel path to the trailhead.  We got an upclose look at the fencing that holds rocks in place from sliding to the road.  Kind of interesting.   And then we climbed.  We have done steeper, but I was off my game today.   Sadly.  Because we had a really smooth stretch and great view of the town for a couple of miles, thenwe turned and climbed rocks over the mountain. We had a great drop and then crossed another road.  There was once again a cluster of empty water jugs.  The water here is not drinkable because of zinc smelting for about 100 years ending in 1980.  So we pushed on to the tent site we are at.  After a rock scramble for 300 feet uphill of course.  Navigator went .6 mile downhill to a little pub to get water from their spigot, and picked up Dr Peppers (why are there never any Pepsi?) And I took a Tylenol and a nap.  I feel much better than I have all day, so I hope a good night's sleep helps the quest to finish the last 30 miles in this miserable state.","Stealth camp

Navigator and Motivator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639870,"I didn't even have dinner last night.  Navigator had gotten the water and Dr. Pepper and I woke up enough to drink some and passed out again.  I slept the clock around and felt better this morning.  Still a touch of headache so I took another Tylenol and we ate, read and started packing up.  We got on trail a lot later than normal but I was determined to make better time. And so we did.  The rocks aren't any less and there is still mud.  Makes no sense to me because it hasn't rained in a few days.  But there it is.  We had nothing really noteworthy to look at until we reached the gap and TRAIL MAGIC.  Old fox (2016) and his wife and 2 sons were greeting hikers with food, drinks and wonderful hospitality.  They had homemade fried rice with bar-b-q (our choice) or spaghetti.  Ice cold cokes or Gatorade and homemade cinnamon rolls. We had planned to stop for a snack there, and wound up eating too much.  It was great.  It was hard to get up, but if we are going to get out of this state we must.  They even had gallons of water to fill our bottles with. Amazing how kind the hiking community is....We got to the shelter and stayed a while, then back moving.  We crossed the power line (not a bad view) and kept moving.  There were still so many rocks.  But Wind gap is ahead.  After a view of course.  And then down to the road.  There were more empty water jugs at the road.  We can't catch a break on the water.  So Navigator walked .2 miles down to a motel that let's hikers use their spigot.  While he was gone 2 hikers came down and I was surprised one of then was the kid from the shelter a while back.  He had a female companion with him- maybe they are a couple? They also went to get water.  When Navigator got back we put on packs and went under a big road and down the road.  We had to cross the road and then began the 700 foot climb up.  I wish I could say we reached the top, but we found a nice place for the tent and quit.  Not a bad day and the rocks are supposed to improve from here.  We should be at the state line tomorrow evening.  Probably not crossing yet because NJ has restricted camping and it will be a little further than I may be able to make it.  But we will decide that at lunch tomorrow.   Today I am ready to catch up the reading we missed last night and get another good night's rest.","Stealth camp

Navigator and Motivator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639916,"Last night was very windy, and even though we had climbed 600' there was a lot of traffic noise.  I worried a lot about a tree falling in the wind.  When Navigator woke up he told me of course he had paid attention (I was too tired last night to think of it) so I worried for nothing.  We were definitely in high spirits as the rocks are supposed to be better after this gap.  That wasn't exactly so, but there were stretches of beautiful trail.  It was foggy this morning and cool. With thunderstorms possible around noon. So we really wanted to get as far as possible before the storms.. We did do the bypass trail for the Wolf Rock overlook.  That was 1 mile of rock scrambling I was very happy to skip (our path was not shorter, just easier). My ankle is holding up well but I still have limited mobility.  We ate at the shelter following and a hiker came in bleeding from a cut on his knee.  He was a victim of the rocks we skipped.  And soon after we reached the hostel another hiker came in and also had a bad fall in those rocks (his trekking pole broke).  So we were better off not going through there.  We put our pack covers on at the shelter and got sprinkled on but no real storms.  We got to the hostel here and it is sadly filled with young hikers who got here yesterday and are planning to go to a jazz festival and drink tonight.  We have not stayed in a hostel,  so I was a little bummed, but we still took showers.  We walked to the store for a Pepsi and got subs to eat.  By then it was getting very crowded so we pitched our tent.  So much for the shower,  we are sweaty all over again.  We did sit on the porch and read tonight.  Lovely chairs and a table and all the other hikers are on the town.  We are up much later than normal but tomorrow we will be in NJ and Navigator is planning our next few days.  I was hoping to get to church tomorrow, but the closest Baptist church is several miles away, and evidently they take the Covid much more seriously than we do.  Things are not the same in a lot of ways, but I know God doesn't need me in a church to worship Him.  I will praise Him wherever I am.","Stealth camp

We had a good night's rest and no bear encounters. We woke up extra early and once Navigator got the bear bag down we ate breakfast and read our proverb.  It is going to be hot today, so early is a good idea.  We made great time.  I was definitely tasting a Pepsi from the deli right off trail ahead.  But first we had 11.8 miles to traverse.  There were some rocky areas.  And one climb straight over some rocks.  Halfway up Navigator asked if we should take the blue trail around.  Not coming back down at this point.  Even if it was scary.  The rocks are 'sweaty' in places.  Not sure what makes some wet and the rest dry.  But the wet ones are slick.  I skidded several times which meant slow down. We reached the deli and we had late lunch.  I had an Italian Hot dog (it was different but good) and Navigator had a hamburger.  We each had a Pepsi and fries and it was $23.  Much better than yesterday.  We used their water spigot to refill bottles and back to the trail we went.  Of course more rocks. Nice thing was more blueberries. But stopping to pick them slows us down, which we are slow already. But they sure are good. Wish mine at home grew like this. Blackberries are almost ripe as well. We reached the shelter and the ridge runner is here and spending the night.  There is a bear box for food storage and we are camped in a lovely grassy area.  And someone was nice enough to leave water at the bear box.  It was about 90 today with high humidity so we appreciated the water supply. I used 4 electrolyte packets and could have used more.  So the theme of getting up early will continue if we can.  We should cross into NY tomorrow (and probably stop to eat again).  We haven't finished NJ yet, we will cross back and forth a few times.  But we are making progress and feeling good.

It tasted great (now I know why Mom likes them). Then the push to Unionville, NY.  Wow.  They are very patriotic (of course the 4th is coming up) with flags and bunting everywhere.  We stopped at the general store and got Pepsi and chips-a-hoy.  We ate almost the whole package.  They had a nice porch with chairs and outlets to charge phones.  We stayed about an hour.  I had planned to get Pizza down the street,  but it is just too hot to want to eat more right now.  We could keep resting and waiting for the heat to subside. But we have to move on.  We got a Pepsi for the road and reluctantly hiked on.  We went around a wetland and crossed a lot of boardwalk over swampland.  All flat at least.  And then to an old house the ATC owns that has a water spigot to use.  Cold water.  We filled up and hydrated.  And rinsed the sweat off (of course we have a 400 ft climb up to our shelter so not really effective) but it was nice.  And now we are in the tent listening to some fireworks in the distance and feeling pretty proud to have kept up and passed the young kids.  They are faster, but we hike longer.","Mashipacong shelter

I do not know how they keep from breaking their necks.  Oh well.  Dry tent so we are happy.  We were out on the trail at 6:30 and ready to hit some miles because it is another hot day and thunderstorms likely.  Today was so full I am sure I will forget something.  We started by climbing, then dropping to climb again.  To a view, which means lots of rocks.  We were so busy scrambling up and over rocks that neither of us actually saw the view.  And disappointing- no blueberries there.  Ok.  We pushed on.  And came to the first highlight: a continuous boardwalk for .6 miles to a suspension footbridge, followed by another .2 of boardwalk.  It was hot, and very little shade, but they had beautiful views of the mountains we have been on.  The boardwalk is about 4 to 8 feet above the swampy area.  And at one point we passed a stand of Johnson grass that was well over my head.  I expect it was at least 10 ft tall or more.  And at the end of the walk was a huge black snake.  Again, it was huge.  At least 7 ft and bigger around than my thigh.  I was cautious going past.  The adventures continued.  We went over some railroad tracks (train trucks had already went by as we approached) and then a stile to pass.  The sign was amusing. It said Hikers- do not approach the cows.  I guess a lot of these hikers aren't from the country.  After crossing the field we climbed out of the field to a road.  It was a short walk to a farmers market/garden store.  Don't laugh, we each got a cucumber and a Coke (no Pepsi here) and sat outside to charge our phones and rest in the shade.  Then we went back across the street to a hot dog stand.  It is early, but why not?  They had a special 2 hot dogs, chips, and a can of Pepsi for $7.  It was so good.  I could have eaten more but we are staring at the mountain we have to climb next.  It is called the 'stairway to heaven' and is not going to be easy.  We got going and finally reached the base of the mountain to climb.  It was so hot in the sun, but not much better in the shade.  We were just beginning to climb when a girl ran up to us and said she had seen a bear.  Dumb us- we want to see it.  She went behind us. No bear.  So disappointing.   Of course the day hikers without packs left us behind as we were going up.  And the trail was poorly marked.  We turned wrong twice.  Once we were able to just move sideways.  The second time we were climbing a steep climb when we realized, and Navigator slid down about 10 ft.  I was behind him for once.  And then it happened.  We saw the bear.  Actually 2 bear cubs.  Which is dangerous because the mama bear will attack anything she thinks is a threat to her babies.  We never saw her, and they were moving away from us.  So we continued up and ran into the girl who saw the bear at the beginning on her way down.  We warned her and kept on.  It was a brutal climb because it was hot and humid and frustrating to not have clear markings.  We finally went over- one of those crazy rock cairns about 8ft tall marked the summit.  Then we came to a marvelous creek with a footbridge.  I soaked my feet while Navigator planned ahead and texted some people. We kept on and finally finished the state. We got to a road crossing and called a shuttle.  We are now at a drive-in theater camped on the hill.  They have loaned us a little radio to listen to the movie.  I have never been to a drive-in so I am excited.  And it rained just a little a few minutes ago so it is much cooler and we are settled in to watch something.

Navigator and Motivator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640154,"Last night proved I am just old.  The movies started at 9, and at 9:30 we took our radio back because I am falling asleep.  Of course the movies weren't really ones I would have gone to anyway.  The last movie we saw was ""Overcomer"" which is a great Christian movie from 2019.  If you haven't seen it you have missed a really good one.  Of course there was too much light and noise to really sleep, and then all the cars leaving at 11:30 from the first movie, and then again after the 2nd movie (double feature night).  But that still didn't keep me from waking up at 5:30 this morning as the sun came up.  I thought the tent had rain on it but turned out to be sap from the tree-line we are next to.  Not sure if all the tents got it, but our fly is covered in sap.  We got moving and ate a cold breakfast, read our proverb and packed up.  The girl in the next tent was packed up and asked if we had been reading the Bible.  I told her yes, and we had a nice talk.  She is hiking to gain peace.  Which only the Lord can provide.  I hope she enjoys her time and can feel God's comfort (she needs it).  So we were anxious to get back to trail, but had a delay getting a shuttle back.  That was ok, because today needs to be shorter so we catch up on reading.  We had a good hike and while it was rainy we weren't baking in the heat.  The pack covers are the best purchase we have made since we began our hike.  Worth their weight for certain.  The most fun part of today was a section known as the lemon squeezer.  It is a narrow path between 2 rock slabs.  I managed to make it through with my pack on, but had to take a water bottle out and inch through.  Navigator got frustrated and finally took his pack off.  By then I was through and reached down to pull it up so he could get through.  Immediately after there was a steep climb and a hiker had built a fire right on trail to warm up and dry off.  Definitely not supposed to do that (and especially not here on state park land) but there he was.  We elected to take the slightly easier path over the mountain because our packs are fully loaded with food after we visited the grocery store next to the drive-in.  I could have made the climb, but not worth it.  A little longer to go around is fine by me.  Reached the same spot.  We then continued to the shelter, where we have broken the etiquette and set the tent in the shelter.  I doubt anyone else shows up as this shelter has reports of aggressive bear activity and the next shelter is only 5 more miles.  But if others come we will take the tent down.  There are just a lot of mosquitoes.  Buzzing all around and mad they can't get in to bite me (I am clearly better tasting than Navigator). It is still lightly raining and storms coming later so I am not sure if we will be alone or not. Sad thing is there is no picnic table here, and no privy.  We will survive.  Dinner is eaten and the feed bags hung on the bear cables.  It is starting to get dark and we are still the only ones here.","Drive in

And then we climbed.  Up and down, repeatedly.  We finally reached a summit where the shelter is .6 off trail.  It is the 1400 mile mark from Springer Mtn in GA.  We sat on the rocks because that is too far to go and ate lunch.  And then Navigator said, hey look-the NYC skyline.  It was cloudy that way but you can make it out.  How cool is that? Shortly after we got moving again some of the kids passed us again.  They are going to make the trailside zoo.  We did not.  We got over Bear Mtn and down the hill to the pool but the last entrance to the zoo was 3:30, about 30 minutes before we got there.  But that was ok.  We went to the pool (free for hikers) and took showers and charged phones.  We could go the alternate route down the road, but I really wanted to do the zoo.  So we stayed at the pool deck a few hours.  It closed at 5, and the rain hit right after.  So now it was decision time.   We stayed under the deck shelter and read our chapters.  Then cooked and ate dinner.  It finally slowed to a drizzle about 7:30 so we went toward the dock (which says it is closed) and could not find an out of sight place to put the tent.  We finally reached a little field and set up at the edge of some trees.  There is a parking area here. One pickup pulled up and some guys took some beer down to the dock.  No one else has shown up.  I just hope the rangers or park police don't tell us we have to move (technically no camping allowed in the state park). Because we have nowhere to go.  There are train tracks very close. And it is still rainy, with storms coming later.  They say rain most of tomorrow.  But at least right now we are clean and dry.  And looking forward to the zoo tomorrow.  Doesn't open until 10:30, so we will probably sleep in.","Fingerboard shelter

Navigator and Motivator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640276,"Last night was another not great night.  The guys that went to the dock came and left, and nobody else pulled in to the parking lot, although several cars went down the road.  We had trains on both sides of the river, and the ones on our side were so loud you would think they were going to hit us.  They came every hour or two but thankfully were short so gone quickly.  I was so worried about getting caught camping where we shouldn't that I was up at 5.  I began packing what I could and waited for Navigator to wake up.  The 6 am train stirred him.  We packed the wet tent up and headed back up the hill to the covered deck area of the pool.  We ate breakfast and did our reading.  And draped the tent over the handrails to dry it some.  It was raining most of the night but we didn't get any more severe storms.  But the air is damp and the tent will not dry completely no matter what (I should clarify. The fly is wet, tent is dry) we were joined by another hiker at 10.  We packed everything back up and got ready to enter.  They were late opening.  It was not a big zoo.  Just a lot of info about local trees, rocks, and wildlife.  Plus a few animal exhibits.  The reptile room was interesting.  They had a rattlesnake in there that had sutures in its neck.  I expect someone tried to kill it and someone else rescued it.  You would never see me working on a snake and certainly not a poisonous one.  So we continued to what should have been the highlight.  The bear den, the lowest point on the AT.  Truly looking at the bears just made me sad.  All of the animals here look defeated.  And the bobcat and fox were in far too small a space in my opinion.  But the bears.  Awful.  I do wish we had bypassed yesterday and went on.  I didn't know it would be so depressing.  Once we exited the zoo we crossed the Hudson River.  There was a huge flag at the beginning and that at least lifted my spirits.  It was a great .5 mile walk and then we started to climb.  I forgot how hard that is (kidding) but the wet rocks combined with the leaves and sticks washed into the trail made it slow going.  And it wasn't until an hour of struggling that I realized we hadn't eaten lunch.  But there is a deli literally on trail in a few miles, so we ate a snack and pushed on.  Now I had a set goal. And we were able to get in gear and reached the deli at about 2.5mph instead of the 1.5 we had been doing.  We got double cheeseburgers with home fries from the grill and it was really good.  Also a chocolate milk and Pepsi.  Pretty balanced meal actually.  We stayed too long talking to other hikers there and finally set off.  We slogged through mud and muck and steep ups and downs until we reached this camping area.  We set up the tent and have been joined by one other hiker so far.  There are fireworks in the distance but no real noise like last night, so we should sleep better.  And more storms tonight with rain again tomorrow-yay!","Bear Mountain trailside zoo

Navigator and Motivator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640335,"When our kids were young the preacher would call them up and do a little 'children's church' for a few minutes, then give them a sucker (which kept them quiet during church). It was always insightful for the children, and adults. So this 4th of July was a Sunday as well, and the preacher called up the kids and asked them if anyone knew what was special about today.  Our daughter's hand went up and waved a little, and the preacher said 'tell me what makes today so special'.  And her reply was ""it's my daddy's birthday""  and to her that beat the celebration of independence day.  The focus of the lesson was the freedom we have in Christ, and the sacrifice it took to secure that freedom.  So today I let Navigator sleep in and when he woke up wished him happy birthday.   Then got us moving.  We made a record time eating, reading, and packing up.  There was none of the forecasted rain last night so we have a dry tent.  It was cool weather and some cool sights on the way.  We passed the remnants of the barn where the revolutionary soldiers were vaccinated for smallpox at General Washington 's command.  And a lot of stone walls.  They are nicer than a lot we have passed- more defined and often higher.  We also had a rock bridge between 2 smaller peaks about 3 feet wide to cross.  The guide book said it was an old mining road.  And we finally made it to the state park that had a concession stand.  Hot dog, fries, and a Pepsi for 7.50. Can't miss that for lunch.  We also used real bathrooms and talked to some other hikers who were there.  Charged our phones while we ate.  A nice relaxing hour.  But we will not fall into yesterday's trap of staying too long and being so full we don't want to move.  Navigator did get a second Pepsi and an ice cream sandwich (it is his birthday after all).  We climbed over a view and there on the rocks was a 911 memorial flag painted on the rock. Remember the day we were all just american and united instead of divided? There are kids out here who do not remember that day....We pushed on to the shelter.  We were not hungry, but you can have pizza delivered here.  Except today.  Oh well.  We pushed on.  We wanted to get far enough away from the fireworks that we can sleep tonight, but that is an impossibility.  We are currently secured in a Meadow and listening to huge booms, and it isn't even dark yet.  I think a long night ahead.","Stealth camp

Navigator and Motivator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640395,"I woke up at some point in the night and realized it was quiet.  Loud fireworks just kept going for a very long time last night, and I must have been so tired that it didn't keep me awake.  My leaking mattress pad was probably why I woke up.  Enough is enough, I have to have better sleep.  So when we got up Navigator had to re-plan so we could get to an outfitter.  We enjoyed a cool morning and peaceful quiet, with a little buck for company as we packed up. It is a little misty and there is a chance of rain, so no dallying today.  We are on a mission to get to a town, outfitter, and hotel.  So we got moving.  We had a harder time going than it seemed like we should on the profile map.  Lots of PUDS (pointless up and downs) and what we call piddles (even more idiotic ups and downs).  We stopped for an early lunch and confirmed a reservation for the Marriott in Fishkill.  And an outfitter a few miles away we can get to.  So now we really need to go.  The blueberries here are not quite ripe yet. So no temptation to stop and pick.  We did cross one place where a man was picking black raspberries,  and he offered us some.  I have never had them. And I had assumed they were blackberries but he assured me those wouldn't be ripe for a few weeks. The flavor was different but not unpleasant.  We got to the road crossing and got an Uber to the store.  It was not a big place, and I am uncertain if the pad I got is going to be any good.  It is only 1.5"" thick, but it is better than waking up on the ground.  Maybe this one will last longer than 3 weeks before it gets a hole. My shoes are also falling apart, but they had nothing worth trying on-more yuppy hiker than thru hiker clientele I guess. We then took a taxi to the hotel (Uber was ridiculously expensive by comparison) and I am pretty certain the Marriott here has never seen anything like us before.  We got checked in and wonderful hot showers made us feel almost normal.  We walked the 1/2 mile to Walmart and got some food to top off our feed bags and a lot of junk we can't eat before we check out but looked good at the time.  In other words a Caesar salad for each of us, 2# of boneless chicken wings, a package of Oreo double stuffs, Dorito's and queso dip, doughnuts from the deli and a 6 pack of Pepsi.  We will make a good dent in it at least.  Navigator did the laundry downstairs and we have reorganized our packs.

Navigator and Motivator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640463,"We stayed up later than we should.  The bed was so comfortable, and we were watching real TV.  And honestly I was enjoying the novelty of watching local TV in NY this morning.  Until the weather came on.  They said high in the upper 90 range and heat index 100 to 105, with thunderstorms likely in the afternoon.   And repeat tomorrow.  It is not going to be fun hiking today.  But even as relaxing as the hotel was, we have to leave sometime.  We managed an Uber to pick us up quickly and get us back to the trailhead.  We picked up at the AT train station (you can go to NYC from there for about $50) and crossed the road.  We went over several stiles and across some fields.  There was an old wooden water tower and some cow crap on the trail, though we never saw any cows.  And then the real fun started.  It is like they never do any trail maintenance in this area.  We went over, under and around more fallen trees than I could count.  With overgrown sections full of thorny brambles.. And the boardwalk sections were rickety as well.  Not fun hiking on its own, and then the heat made everything worse.  I ripped the mesh on my pack at some point, and that really disturbs me.  I think it was when I was crawling under a downed tree and had to take it off and drag poor Lucille behind me.  We reached a road crossing and there was a cooler with Gatorade.  Perfect spot to rest a minute and drink.  It is so considerate to leave an ice chest out for hikers on a miserable hot day like this.  We reached the first shelter shortly after-the trail is literally going right past it.  We sat at the picnic table and ate a snack, then onward.  The next shelter is 4 more miles and we can do that.  We will be in CT soon.  So we kept on.  About a mile later it started to thunder.  We passed the Connecticut state line and tried to go quicker.  About 1/2 mile later the wind kicked up and we put on the pack covers.  2 minutes later and we were in a huge thunderstorm.  Lightning was nearby, and it was dark.  There was no canopy in the trees so we were getting soaked.  Should have put on raincoats, but too late now.  We were 1 mile from the shelter when it let up some.  Water was a river in the trail and our shoes are soaked.  I slipped several times (I fell earlier but it wasn't a bad fall, and not raining yet) and even Navigator skidded in the mud.  We thought we would never get to the shelter.  But we finally did.  And it was packed.  The group of young people we have been near but not really talked to.  The shelter is designed for 6 and there were 11 people inside staying dry.  We stayed a little while, then set up the tent when the rain slacked off.  They said they were all staying in the shelter, but after we set up our tent several of them left, and the ones who stayed set their tents up inside.  We would have stayed in the shelter if they hadn't said they were all staying.  Good news is they should move farther than us tomorrow, so we won't have to worry about them anymore.  CT requires hikers to stay at the shelter or designated camp sites.  Tomorrow we will cross back into NY for about 2 miles before leaving it for good. Another state to cross off the list.  Getting closer and learning some geography and history.","NY 22

It is a short walk into Kent where I hope to get new shoes.  The store doesn't open until 10 but there are public restrooms with charging for the phone, so I can wait there as easy as here.  It was a quick downhill and easy road walk.  I found the hiker area quickly and left my stuff to charge while I went to the grocery store for Pepsi and cottage cheese.  I know it is a weird choice for second breakfast, but it was what I decided I had to have.  I wanted time until the store opened and went back down the road.  Sadly they had no shoes for me.  The women's section was all Merrell and one pair of Salomon with the offset laces that hurt my feet so bad I returned them.  Not a good thing as my shoes are coming apart.  And to top it off as soon as I left the store it started to rain.  At least I have a pack cover.  The rain was intermittent which was a good thing with a steep descent over stone steps today.  Some were very steep, and I was definitely not moving fast.  Right after I got down a huge bolt of lightning struck and the rain started falling.  I hurried to the next shelter.  It was a wonderful road walk next to the river, completely flat profile.  I should have gotten much farther, but I guess there is a hurricane so better to stop.  Crossing the stream to get here was also not fun, those wood logs get slick when they are wet, and it is higher than ot looks. It was too soon to eat dinner, so I ate a snack and was reading when my first shelter mate showed up.  With a dog.  At least she kept him out of the shelter until he was drier.  Unfortunately he was not on a leash. So when the next hiker came up he ran at him barking and growling.  I thought he would bite, but he didn't.  That hiker decided to tent.  Can't blame him.  I would rather not sleep with the dog either.  He barked at the next arrival as well (his owner said he is possessive, so he didn't bark at me because I was there first).

She had taken a nap and eaten lunch and felt ready to push on.  It is .5 down trail to the shelter.  I sat down to eat and think about it.  I looked at the guide book and decided it was one good up and then fairly level. So why not go for it.  Yes.  IDIOT should be my trail name.  I didn't factor in weather and mud.  The trail went over I-90 and past a hotel.  Where I should have stopped.  But I already had one unscheduled stop and can't afford too many hotel rooms.  So I climbed.  Halfway up there was a road crossing and someone had left a cooler of beer.  No sodas for those that don't drink.  Oh well.  I sat on the cooler for a few minutes to contemplate my stupidity.  Then started moving again. It is getting windy and there is thunder in the distance.  The flat profile was deceiving.   It is a lot of small ups and downs.  6 ft here, 10 there.  With abundant mud.  I thought Vermont was the mud state.  It started to get dark and more thunder.  I know rain is coming.  I passed a stealth site I might fit in.  But I am worried about no bear line.  I will make it. Just going to be close to dark.  I swallowed one of the energy gels while I filtered water and set my mind to making that shelter.  It was sprinkling but I didn't even stop to put on the pack cover.  I had to get to the shelter.Usually there is a sign to mark the shelter path.  This was different.  There was a trail camera on a tree.  It had a light for infrared which was why I noticed it and stopped, or I would have missed the shelter entirely.  I got there and found a good tent site and got set up just before it poured.  I ate pepperoni pizza combos for dinner (I also need to get a stove) and a lull in the rain let me make it to the bear box.  Another pair of hikers came right after and set their tents near me.  And I was too tired to even see who they were. I plan to sleep in tomorrow and not go far.","Shaker campsite

There were a lot of cars going down the single lane rd, which surprised me.  And then I topped the last few feet and saw the war memorial.  It was so unexpected and looked so cool with the most blowing around it.  I went to a bench and got out the tent to dry and eat a snack.  A good breeze and a little sun broke through so it almost got dry.  As I was packing back up a hiker named Dice who was at the site last night came up.  He is sectioning and a little slower than me.  He bought cookies and sodas and I stayed to share them.  And it was clearing a little so we climbed the memorial to look at the views of all the mountains around us.  Fascinating this was built in the 1930 era in tribute to WW1 veterans. As neat as it was to read all this, the serious rain is threatening and it was time to go.  I slipped a few times descending but managed not to fall or get my shoes wet.  That makes it a great day.  I got to the shelter about 2 and it is already packed.  There are 2 'guides' here with a group of 9 teenage boys who are staying, and 3 other hikers.  So we will be snug tonight.  I wish the tent fit on a platform because it is supposed to rain all day tomorrow so no hope of staying dry.  And the guides have started drinking the beer they picked up in town (they are going south).  At least only 2 kids will be in the shelter.  The rest are hammocking and in for a wet night.  But the picnic table is inaccessible because they have it loaded and the shelter is crowded.  I am going to try to rest and read.  I am not sure I can focus, but I am going to try.","Father Tom campground

Navigator and Motivator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641143,"Last night was unpleasant.  The hiker next to me was avoiding a leak, so we were crammed into the shelter.  And then at 9:30 2 southbounders showed up.  They chose to sleep at our feet since there was no other space, and in the pouring rain and dark they did not want to put up their tent.  And then they got up at 4:30 to pack up and leave.  So it was hard to get moving.  I was the last hiker to leave.  And I was not moving very fast in all the mud.  It was a small up and then 2000' down.  But once I got down it was a nice road walk for 1/2 mile.  I chose to walk .2 down the road to the grocery where I picked up some food, and cottage cheese to eat while I charged my phone.  Sadly I can see the mist on the mountain ahead, and clouds hanging so I know I have to hurry.  Back down the road and up some stairs to a bridge over the Hoosic River, and railroad tracks.  Then another short road walk and the trail went down a driveway into the woods.  And I got to climb back up. I passed a bad weather bypass trail and wondered why that was necessary, but it didn't say it rejoined the trail, so I stayed with the blazes.  And it turned into an incredible rock scramble to the peak and once there it was about 1/2 mile of rock slab to walk over.  It was slick because of the rain, and I had to double back a couple of times because the blazes are hard to see on wet rock.  And then the border.  Wow.  I am in Vermont.  And the mud is thick but I have avoided getting my shoes submerged so far.  Eventually I reached the shelter and it was already full even though it is only 3.  It is 7 miles to the next shelter, but I just am too tired to go that far.  Time to put up the tent.  Everyone says the rain is coming, and I can tell this tent site will flood (they all will) but there really is no other choice.  I got water (path to it is a stream on its own) and washed my legs since I am covered in mud.  I did some reading and ate dinner early, so I could move the feed bag to the bear box.  It is rusty and wet.  More hikers keep arriving and everyone knows we are going to be in wet tents by morning.  I am snuggled down without my sleeping bag because I just don't want it to get wet again.","Wilbur Clearing shelter

Navigator and Motivator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641145,"I heard a voice this morning call out 'never quit on a bad day'.  I think we all needed to hear that, but I am sure a lot of us were contemplating what we are doing.  The rain started at 8 last night, and as I thought I was quickly in about 3"" of water.  And it never drained.  It rained most of the night.  And got so cold.  I put my buff on because my ears were cold and by 11 I pulled out the sleeping bag and said I know it will get wet but I am COLD.  I guess like a waterbed whose heater goes out.  So by 4:30 everything was wet.  Again.  I started packing up and went to the bear box.  It was underwater about 2"" as well.  I ate my poptarts and dreamed of being warm and dry.  I did not read because it was still too dark and I know I will stop early.  I was getting ready to go when Unkempt bed asked if I was going to the motel.  I said what hotel, and he told me about the recommendation on guthooks (really could be useful to have).  I already resupplied so I wasn't going to stop, but it is really nasty and everything is wet.  Maybe.  I took off and within a quarter mile was over trying to keep the shoes clean.  The trail is all running water or standing water.  Nowhere is firm ground.  I played a game with myself to see if it was a rock or mud I was stepping on.  Today I was actually knee deep in mud and thinking about taking a picture, but it is too hard to pull out the phone.  Believe me, it was very bad today.  The rain stopped for a while but the mph never improved.  My friend caught up which was good as we crossed a swollen river with submerged rocks to traverse. We made it and we stopped at the next shelter to eat.  2 hikers who stayed in the shelter last night were there.  They are younger and not carrying wet tents, so they should be ahead.  We had 4 miles to go to the pickup point.  But there is no service at the road, so 2 miles before you call the motel so they can pick you up in an hour.  My friend called, and it turned out they had a room, so I reserved it.  Now to get there in 1 hr 15 min.  Seems reasonable until you take into account a 1000' drop.  Steep drop.  I got lost on a rock scramble and wound up twisting my bad ankle and falling.  Now I am even slower.  I made it down and across the road where several hikers were already waiting.  The shuttle driver got there right after me.  But only room for 4 people. We let the others go and sat down to await his return.   The ice cream dude was there with folding chairs to sit and gave us ice cream sandwiches.  And a banana.  And then some watermelon while we waited.  Finally the shuttle arrived and we got taken to the motel. Quick check in and then back to work.  Drying the tent, sleeping pad, sleeping bag.  Laundry.  At least no grocery shopping this time.  I went to the gas station next door for Pepsi and a frozen burrito.  I am not walking to the restaurant because my foot is swollen and I think that .5 is too far.  The sun did come out for a little while.  Not sure how my foot will be in the morning, but the rain chance is low tomorrow and 80% the next day.

First we got to cross a little bridge.  And then the climb began.  Equivalent to the drop yesterday.  I was sweating by the top.  There were 2 people I have seen before eating lunch at the top.  I am not hungry yet so I kept on.  About 2 miles later I came to a view and there was actually a little sunshine.  It is called porcupine ridge.  I have seen a few baby porcupines but no adults.  Anyway.  I sat and ate lunch and the guys passed me.  That's how it goes.  I finally got up and trudged on through the mud.  I had no idea where I was when I stopped again to get water and a snack.  That's when Unkempt bed caught up.  Turns out it was .1 to the shelter.  We got there, but the shelter is full.  So he suggested .3 more to the lookout tower.  So we moved up there.  I found a spot that will not flood my tent and got set up.  It is not worth climbing the tower-it is foggy already.  So I ate and curled into the sleeping bag.

Roughly 2800 ft up to the summit with a lookout tower.  I could see my breath as I ascended, but I felt hot in long sleeves.  When I got to the summit I decided to eat a snack while I climbed the tower.  I should not have.  It was windy and cold, and I am wasting time and energy.  I cleared the tree line and was awed by the view- but I did not go to the top.  They say this is where the AT was first envisioned by a man named Benton McKaye, and it is beautiful looking out.  I ate my snack and got down.  Time to move.  The sun is shining and it did get a little warmer on the descent.  The mud and muck are no better.  Still streams in places on the path, and swampy areas where you try to rock hop but sometimes just go shin deep into the mud.  But the big climb is the hardest part of the day, and it is behind me.  The surprising thing today was I did not see a single other northbound hiker until after I stopped at the shelter.  I passed 3 southbound and never saw any others on trail.  This is very unusual.  So today was extra lonely, but I still enjoyed my day once it warmed up.  I didn't have to stop to get passed, so that was good.

There is no point watching the weather.  If they predict rain and it doesn't happen we are happy, or accepting if it does.   But when they say pleasant and sunny and it doesn't happen we are not happy.  But even so my world will be back to normal soon.  One more day.

The gospel was not presented,  and no invitation given.  And all prayer was in the form of responsive reading.  A great disappointment I am not anxious to repeat.  So we got back to the hostel and grabbed bags to catch the bus back to the trail.  We had a great hike and stopped at the state park here to spend the night.  There was a small fee but it is worth it to stop and rest.  We pitched our tent and ate dinner.  We tried to read but Navigator was nodding off after one chapter, so we went to bed early.  The park here has a program handing out bear vaults to store your food in.  There is no fee, and we were told we could keep it through the state- it is too heavy, but they didn't even make us put a deposit on it (they are costly).  It is sad that not quite all of our food fit in the vaults.  That means we are carrying too much.  But what else is new?

We had several small ups and downs with a net gain of 1000 ft to the cabin we planned to sleep at.  Shortly after leaving the shelter we came to a fun ladder to climb down.  I may get over my fear of heights yet.  But whether I like it or not doesn't matter- it is an obstacle to pass if I am going to get out of this state.  And while it is not quite as bad as PA was, I am ready to get to NH. We have a ways to go to get to the lookout cabin.  Evidently everyone was thinking the same thing, because we wound up with 15 at the cabin for the night.  The cabin has a ladder to the roof which is supposed to have a great view, but the clouds had rolled in and the views were gone, so we didn't climb up. There was a lot of thunder and stick lightning.  It is nice not to be in the tent tonight.  But we didn't really get any rain.  Just a sprinkle and then it cleared off by dark.  The cabin has a fireplace we didn't need or use, and lots of windows with screens.  And is fully enclosed unlike most of the shelters.  Only downside is no water source (you carry water 2 miles) and there is no privy.  But I got to watch the moonrise and it was beautiful.  We have again not read enough.  Too many people and distractions.

Navigator and Motivator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641623,"Last night was another 'maybe not our best decision' kind of night.  We were close to the door, so people going in and out to use the non-existent privy meant very little sleep.  I was the first one awake and even I slept late.  It was 5:45 when I woke up.  No bird chirping audible in the cabin.  So I woke up Navigator and we packed and moved.  We ate breakfast bars on the way down the trail as I was anxious to get moving.  The day started fairly level with one small up and then 1500' descent.  We crossed a field where I found a few ripe blackberries.   They were super sweet, and I hope there are more ahead.  The blueberries have been scarce recently, and not ripe in most places.  We reached the road and crossed to begin another climb.  As we climbed there was an old vw bus top randomly rusting about 10 feet off trail.  Not sure why it was out in the woods, but it looked like it had been cut off and left there.  And when we finally reached the other side of the mountain there was trail magic.  A couple were cooking hamburger/hotdogs and had a cooler of drinks and fresh fruit and veggies.  It was really a nice break.  We stayed too long and ate too much.  But sitting and relaxing is nice.  There were 2 southbounders there, so we get to hear about the trail ahead, and tell them what is ahead for them.  We hated to leave, but we have to go or we won't get to the shelter before dark.  More ups and downs and then the clouds started to gather.  As we hiked we started seeing plastic tubing in the trees. I thought it odd until I realized it was to collect sap from the trees.  Maple syrup is labor intensive.  Someone has to connect the pipe to the tree and monitor those lines  for leaks. And then we reached the next road. There is a fast flowing creek before the road with a  steel cable to hold onto as you cross. I thought I could rockhop with the cable but halfway across I realized the cable needed to be on my other side.  So I ducked under it.  And it hung on my pack and down I went.  I managed to hold on, but I was soaked.  I lost my hat, but Navigator got it as it caught on a rock downstream. The aggravation of wet shoes and a bruised finger from the cable compete for worst part of the day. There were a set of wood steps across the road so I squeezed the water out of my socks and rested while Navigator filtered water. He was able to cross with only one shoe getting a little wet.  We were still 2.5 miles from our intended shelter when the rain started.  But just ahead was the trail to an old shelter.  Even though it is 1/2 mile off trail we chose to go to it.  The trail was rerouted so it is now on private land, but the owners allow it to be used by hikers.   We were the only ones here for about 2 hours and then 2 we stayed at the lookout with arrived.  The rain is cold and it is depressing to sit in the gloom, so company is nice.  One last hiker arrived just before dark.  There is no cell service again (it has been 2 days since I had service) but the new arrival says it will clear soon.   I am dreading the mud this rain will surely create if it lasts long.  Hopefully this light rain will end quickly and it will warm up again.","The look out

We have more road to get down.  We continued down the road past the now closed general store and dreamed of ice cream and Pepsi.  The post office is no longer open either.  The temperature is rising and road walking gets hot.  We finally crossed into the woods and of course began climbing.  And climbing.  We paused several times to rest before we crested the hill.  And finally reached a stream to get water.  And then up 500 ft more to the shelter.  It is such a cute shelter here.  I am being adventurous and chose to sleep in the attic.  We were the first here, and hopefully no one else wants to be up here.  We are being lazy not pitching the tent, but we will be faster packing this way.  It is cozy to spread our stuff out and enjoy the space up here.  And since we arrived early we were able to read in peace. Several tenters showed up, and finally a shelter mate southbounder showed up.  She is chatty as well.  Maybe because less people go that way, and the conversation with the nobos they pass are short since they are going opposite directions.  She was full of info about the trail ahead and generally pleasant company.  She is from GA and hiking home.  She was alone downstairs so we stayed up late again talking.  No big deal,  we are going to town and sleeping in a real bed tomorrow.  I am dreaming of bacon and eggs as well as a steak dinner.  I rolled my right ankle today so a rest will be good, and I am determined to finally get my feet cleaned.  The toenails have been dirty for weeks despite intense scrubbing, and I am determined to get the dirt off.","Cloudland shelter

We got checked in and showered and I emptied my backpack so I could wash it in the tub.  Poor Lucille is not only dirty, she stinks almost as much as I did.  The constant moisture and mud is taking a toll on her too.  I am seeing spots that are rubbing thin over the water bottle pockets, and I will have to replace her if I ever hike another long distance trail after this (doubtful).  On a side note, my right foot has a puncture hole where I stepped on something- I think that was why I rolled my ankle.  Not deep but explains why it was bothering me to walk.  And aggravating as it is, my toenails still have dirty spots despite serious soaking and scrubbing.  Our plan is to spend 2 nights here in a comfortable bed and enjoy a break before the White Mtns.  We rode the bus back to town and went to Walmart for resupply and picked up more food than we can eat once again.  We had Italian food (lasagna and spaghetti) and salad for dinner.  I bought a cheesecake sampler to enjoy while we chilled in the room watching the Olympics.  I like them all, but probably should not have eaten 3 slices.

Cube, so we pushed on even though we can't make the next shelter so will be in the tent for the storm.  Mt. Cube was rough.  Sheets of rock which to me are difficult because I am afraid of falling, and can't seem to see the blazes very well.  And some of it was steep.  But there was a great view at the top and several hikers taking a break and admiring the scenery.  I hate to admit I had no interest in stopping.  The rock climb up means a rock climb down, and I want to get down before it rains.  Not to mention it was COLD up there.  In fact as we came down I got so chilled I stopped and put on long sleeves.  This is not a normal summer.  We got to the base of the mountain and found a beautiful stealth camp area on soft pine needles.  It is .1 from a road. And there is music playing loudly.  We set up the tent and Navigator went to check it out since the rain is delayed.  Turns out Camp Moosilauke is just on the other side of the road.  And there was a cooler of Pepsi!  Still no cell service but we are too tired to move on and the clouds are threatening to open up at any moment.","Stealth camp

But our tent is bigger so maybe it is fair.  We have finished reading early, tonight was the book of Esther.  The verse 4:14 is a reminder that God puts us where we are meant to be.  And like Esther I hope I am ready to respond to His will.  Good thoughts to ruminate while I fall asleep.  Tomorrow we continue the climb to over 5000 elevation.  Mt.

The towns people heard the plane going over and then crash.  It was a military training exercise that went wrong, and they thought they might be under attack since it was WW 2.  So maybe I was thinking about that..... At any rate, we still had a good night's sleep and were ready to tackle the day.  We finished the climb we paused at the campsite, going over 5000' elevation to summit Mt. Lincoln.   We then continued up to 5246' to summit Mt Lafayette.  It was really cool to be above the tree line and to see all the mountains around us.  The sad thing is I was moving so slow today.  I am not sure if it was just the unaccustomed elevation, or general exhaustion with subpar nutrition.  But I am definitely slower than I would like.  We ate lunch just under tree line to be out of the wind, then continued on.  As we were hiking the clouds started rolling over the mountain and the views were rapidly disappearing.  And it was chilly and misty as we descended.  The White Mtns are beautiful but the rocks are awful.  The climb down is exactly that.  Hiking is one thing, mountain climbing is another.  And today we were mountain climbing.  I had a lot of places where I grabbed hold and turned around to get down steep drops.  We did miserable miles today and my feet hurt by the time we got to the shelter.  But we are here with 6 others we have been near for a while, so it isn't just us slowing down.  But tomorrow we have to do better.  Our baby girl is graduating Sat. and we have got to get somewhere we can watch online.  And that is going to be harder than I thought.  The service is awful here in the Whites, so we have to get somewhere with Wi-Fi to be sure we get to watch.","Liberty springs campsite

They helicopter things in to be able to cook so it makes sense they have to charge a higher price. So we rested and ate a snack, then set off after the others. We climbed South Twin mtn and the rocks are really discouraging.  Navigator has fallen 3 times (why I go slow) and there is no end of the things.  We finally reached the top and sat on the huge boulders to eat lunch.  Again all our friends were finished and left before we did.  We have too far to go.  The next hut is 5 miles away, and we still have no cell service. So we got moving again.   More rocks.  We finally reached the top and had smoother trail.  It lasted a little while until about a mile from the hut.  Then we were back to rocks and roots.  We passed a day hiker who called it her R&R (rocks & roots).  A slow painful descent got us to the hut.  We used the bathrooms and got a piece of pumpkin cake (thru hikers get 2 free baked goods and a discount to spend the night at the shelter-not hut), then started out again.  A steep rocky .2 had me convinced we weren't going to get to the road.  But then God cleared the path.  Smooth gentle trail.  We sped to the road.  But now it is 6:00 and we have no cell service still.  So we ate another snack, then God sent us a miracle.  We had passed a couple going up the trail, and they asked if we needed a ride when they came back.  We accepted and explained we needed to go to the pizza place with a campground and wifi.  They were not from the area, but he thought he knew where the pizza place was and took off.  The wrong way (we thought).  Each campground we passed said 'full' on the gate.  We reached the store and at least had cell service, so we thanked them and got out.  We went in and they had a tent site available.  With free showers.  And we got hot sandwiches from the restaurant just before it closed.  And then we went to our site to set up the tent and eat.  There was a large group at the next site.  They were playing a guitar and singing in Spanish.  And then we recognized a hymn.  We sang along as they sung, and it was wonderful.  They also had a devotional which we didn't understand but still felt God's presence.   An awful day ended with more praises than we could count.  And just before we went to sleep I looked at the map we were given.  The name of the campground is 'Living Waters Campground'  I know we are exactly where we should be.","Garfield shelter

It was really good (again, I am always hungry) and we asked about the weather forecast.  Still calling for thunderstorms.  The weather can be unpredictable on Mt Washington, and change drastically over a short time. So we decided not to chance it.  If the weather is too bad they can turn you back, and it is too far to come back here.  The next hut used to have an area for hikers called the dungeon where we could stay for $10 each, but due to covid it is closed, and no tenting there either.

No air conditioning and the fans were ineffective at moving the hot air.  There is a heat advisory in place because the high today is 82.  Not kidding- heat advisory.  In the attic it is stifling and the shower is redundant because we are drenched in sweat.  The hotel down the road would have been a better option.  Air conditioning and a pool.  And only $10 more for 2 people than the hostel.  Lesson learned.  We will be experts by the time we finish.","Imp campsite

We just slept with our food because I could not have gathered the energy to look for a branch, let alone throw the line. I woke up once when someone in a nearby tent stirred, but otherwise did not move.  It was great.  And I had a short day planned if we moved at all.  Of course we woke up with ominous breeze and threat of rain, so since the tent was dry we ate quickly, read a short psalm and packed.  It started raining about 5 min after we hit the trail. After the awful notch yesterday we got to tackle the Mahoosuc arm in the rain.  It was really not a bad climb considering.  But would have been easier if it weren't raining.  Despite having the rain jackets on we were quickly soaking wet *rain stays off but it holds the sweat in.  And there were remnants of big rocks to climb up.  And then we had a small descent to a pond.  It was beautiful and we got to cross a beaver dam and then skirt around the pond.  And we were moving well considering being beat up through the notch yesterday.  And then I just ran my head into a tree which was leaning across the trail.  Hard.  I was looking at the mud and trying to keep my feet under me and never saw it.  I felt my neck vertebrae compress I hit it so hard.  So since we were close to the shelter we went down the path and stopped.  We changed into dry clothes and debated whether we would move on.  We ate lunch and then the rain started again, so the decision was made.  I took a Tylenol and a nap.  My shoes are wet and I have no energy to continue. And then several southbounders showed up.  They have been on trail almost a month and were very helpful with advice on where to stay and eat heading north.  They have stopped a lot, and I don't see them finishing by Thanksgiving which they said was their goal.  But the 5 of them are having a good time, and that is important.  There is no cell service here of course.  I have been curled in the sleeping bag since lunch and still am exhausted. I am concerned about concussion after banging my head, and every muscle seems to ache.  We ate cold dinner- pizza combos and slim jim/cheese sticks.  And settled in to sleep.","Stealth camp

But as we were finishing our psalm the sun peeked out.  It has been too long since we have seen the sun.  Now we are ready to move.  The trail was gentle up and down and much improved from the ankle twisting and knee scuffing rocks.  Now it is just roots to catch a foot or toe and trip us.  We reached a powerline and found raspberries and blackberries to eat.  No rush so we enjoyed them.  There was a couple sleeping under a tarp at the treeline (and I thought we were slow getting going). The sun is out in full now, and we were moving well.  There was a random privy right on the trail.  It is near a campsite, but they are usually farther away from the trail.  We passed that site by to move on to the next pond and campsite.  We saw a lot more moose poop and even moose tracks, but still no moose.  We reached the next pond. There are old canoes here which the hikers can use, and since I have never been in a canoe I was excited to take one out.  We grabbed oars and pushed off.  It was a unique experience to be floating on the water.  We didn't stay out long, but it was fun.  And when we got back to shore we took off our shoes and ate lunch.  The view was gorgeous from the canoe.  I hope I can paint it when I get home.  We weren't going far today, so we took our time before setting out again. And about a half mile later we ran into a southbounder who said there was trail magic at the road. That will get the feet moving.  We reached the road and were treated to chairs and cokes.  And an offer for a ride to the grocery store in town first thing in the morning.  That is perfect.  We set the tent up about .1 from the parking lot and thought about food for the next leg of our trip.  I am sick of eating junk.  So we walked to the hostel .2 down the road to try to get mtn house meals-the only one they had that I liked was lasagna, so I got 2.  The hostel is a retreat style place that has no electricity or water.  Not a place we would pay to stay.  So we walked back and ate our dinner then took our time reading.","Sabbath day pond lean to

We finally reached the road and there were 2 hikers waiting for the shuttle driver to pick them up.  Perfect timing as she got there 2 minutes later and we were on our way to Shaw's hostel.  We put up the tent because they are crowded and I am just as comfortable out here as crammed in the bunkhouse.  The private rooms are all booked.  We walked down to the visitors center and got a lot of info about Katahdin, and then the gas station for a pizza.  It was really good.   We will resupply in the morning (they have a good selection here).  And then a couple of people came and did trail magic-  hamburgers on the grill with potato salad and homemade brownies.  Yes, we ate a second dinner tonight.  Only downside here is it is dark and people are still making a lot of noise talking, sitting out by the fire ring.  But we are tired and drifting off already.....","Moxie bald lean to

I was not that impressed.  It was 3 eggs (over easy, we weren't given an option) with bacon and fried potatoes and all you can eat blueberry pancakes.  The eggs still had runny whites and were not very appetizing.  Navigator only eats scrambled so I ate his too.   And we had to wait for more pancakes.  It was OK, but I wouldn't do it again.  And then we went to get our resupply to get us through the 100 mile wilderness.  And then we were in the van and on our way.  Next to Mt Washington this is the area we have worried about.  This area is remote and there is no cell service (even at Shaw's we had no service-just Wi-Fi). We of course are too full to really hike well this morning-and our feed bags are heavy.  We have planned a week to get through just to be conservative.  We still had a decent morning, and made it further than I expected to.  We managed to make the shelter before dark and set up the tent.  I am tired tonight, and the rain is looking probable.  We have no cell service, but the Verizon people do and the weather is the hot topic tonight.  We are all pushing to the finish line at this point, and of course want the best weather when we summit.","Shaw's Hostel

Everyone says Maine is beautiful but so far we have not seen it.  There is a sense of urgency around us.  Everybody seems to be anxious to get through the wilderness and summit Katahdin.  We are concerned about food as well.  The feed bags were so overfull when we began, but already are lighter (still too heavy though).  One thing is certain, I am worried about not having enough food because I think I could eat nonstop.","Long pond stream lean to

Navigator and Motivator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643665,"With the tent wet again we packed up and started once again in fog and cold.  It is hard to get moving because it is so cold, but once we start hiking we have to pull off jackets and long sleeves and pants to regulate body temperature. The good thing about the cold is we hike faster to stay warm.  Today was our last big climb until we summit Katahdin.  There was a place to get a view of the mountain, but we are clouded in and did not get to see it.  That is ok because we will see it soon enough when we climb it.  We are on track to get through the wilderness on schedule so I feel good about that.  We found a beautiful stealth camp and put the tent up to dry when the sun finally peeked through.  It was much warmer than earlier as well but I expect it to get cold again tonight.  We had cell service on the mountain but from here to the end of the wilderness it is basically flat and we probably won't have signal again.  I worry about my kids and the rest of the family since we will not be able to be reached if there is any need to contact us.  Once the tent dried we moved on to the shelter where we found Half pint and Treeman taking a break, with 4 men who are section hiking the wilderness and Katahdin.  Sadly they are pushing on (we have been a day behind since Stratton so we didn't expect to catch them) while we are done for today.  Turns out there were 5 sectioners in the group but one hurt his knee on chairback mtn and had to get taken to an emergency clinic.  He is at Shaw's and will meet them at the campground they reserved in Baxter Park for their summit before they go home.  We settled into the shelter and talked with them for a long time.  Several other nobos showed up to eat but not stay.  That was good as they were smoking joints after they ate, and I would rather not be near them.  We read our chapters while the guys were calling their wives because there was service back a ways on the trail evidently.  We climbed into the sleeping bags and are listening to the waterfall in front of the shelter and feeling good that we are through the hardest part of the wilderness.","Carl A Newhall lean to

We still were in no hurry today.  The trail was awesome today.  Still some roots to work around but so flat.  We got to the antlers campsite and stopped for early lunch.  They have a 2 seat privy here called Fort relief (not sure who actually shares the privy).  We finally moved on to the next shelter where there was an artesian spring with ice cold water.  I took a rest here as well since the sun is hot and we are going to make the next shelter easily.  We got there and no one else was stopping this early.  We did a lot of reading and just rested.  We have 44 miles to the summit at this point, so it is no rush since we have food to last and the trail is awesome and almost flat.  The squirrels are chattering at us and there is a chipmunk running around checking if we have dropped anything to eat.  It is going to be cold when the sun goes down, so I am sleeping with my Buff to cover my ears.  So far one couple is tenting nearby but we have the shelter to ourselves.  We ate dinner, and are barely staying awake even though it is only 7.  For some reason we are conditioned to eat and sleep as soon as we put the feed bags away.","Cooper brook falls lean to

Navigator and Motivator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643667,"We were both awake early and pretending we weren't when the woman tenting came stomping by the shelter on the way to the privy.  It was just getting light so about 5.  She stomped back by and we decided we should get up.  As we were eating breakfast there was a lot of noise up the trail and I was convinced it was a moose.  We rushed that direction but never saw anything.  I have doubts we will see one. We started down the trail with light feet since we had such an easy day yesterday.   We came to the lake and there was a strong wind blowing as we kept walking around the lake for a very long time.  The wind for some reason was stressful.  Maybe because I have not communicated with anyone from home in a few days, but I am on edge today and the constant noise was not helping.  We finally came to our first view of Katahdin when we climbed Nesuntabunt mountain.  It is impressive looking, and the model at the Monson visitor center was surprisingly accurate. We descended the little mountain and began walking beside a pond.  I do not know why some are ponds and others are lakes.  Size does not seem to matter.   We saw a few sobo hikers but no other nobo all day. We found a nice spot which looked like a boat ramp to get water and eat lunch.  It was really a rock slab on the edge of the lake with several canoes chained up on the shore.  There is a road nearby, but seems like a ways to carry them to here.  Either way we enjoyed our picnic by the lake watching the waves and planning our day tomorrow.  We finally put our shoes back on (take them off every time you stop) and reached the shelter about 3.  It was early to stop but we have no reason to push on since we are ahead of schedule.  This shelter has a 'baseball bat' floor.  Which means small logs about the size of baseball bats are the floor instead of flat boards.  I don't know how it is going to be to sleep on.  The section hikers arrived and decided to stop here as well.  We cooked dinner and spent time talking until dark.  And then a nobo hiker showed up.  We have camped with Ekim before, and he did 37 miles today.  He is meeting his sister on Sunday to summit so it is crazy to me to do big miles like that just to zero at the campground for a few days, but it is what he is happy doing and out here the saying is hike your own hike.  The other thing he shared was the owner of the last hostel has tested positive for covid.  Which basically means everyone on the trail is exposed because everyone stops there. In fact he was the one who checked us in when we arrived.  We feel fine, but they say even vaccinated people can get sick with the new variant.  We have both had it so I am not worried.  But what if they close Baxter park and we do not get to climb Katahdin? Lots of questions and no answers because there is no cell service out here.  We have no option but to get to the end of the wilderness and see what is happening.","Nahmakanta stream lean to

We were up at 6 and ate quickly because it is so cold.  We got packed and read our psalm, then hit the trail at 6:45.  The walk was very easy this morning and then we reached the road and got a closeup view of the mountain as we crossed the bridge.  It is intimidating out there sitting majestically by itself.  We stopped in the store to get food and Pepsi.  And then on to the registration station.  We have to register to get in the park to the thru hiker lean to.  And then disaster.  They only allow 12 to go in, and they already had 11.  No exceptions to the rule even if we are in the same tent.  So we do not get to go in the park today.  Baxter park is private and they have a lot of rules.  If we go in and come out we are ineligible to stay.  And there is no campground available inside.  They are all booked because it is labor day weekend and the natives in the area have a celebration called the K100 this weekend.  It is a yearly thing for them, so they rent the entire campground near the base of the mountain.  So we went back down the road and to the park across the street where we got a lean to (first come basis) since it was only 9 in the morning.  We did some reading and I took a nap. Then we decided we should go to the other campground and take a shower and do laundry.  We also needed more food since we now have a day's delay.  We saw the shuttle come by-unkempt bed summitted today.  He looked elated but also like he didn't really want to be done.  We know the others are in the birches tonight, so it is sad we missed getting in today.  We went back to the lean to and the neighbors brought us some wood to have a fire.  We roasted hot dogs over it for dinner (the store is just across the street).  And then at dusk a man came in looking for a site to camp.  They are of course all filled now.  But I asked how many people and he said just him.  I told him we were leaving early but would not mind sharing the site if he wanted to stay.  He set up a huge tent (Navigator wants one now) and when he finished came and sat at the fire.  Turns out his wife died in November and her birthday is tomorrow.  They camped here for her birthday every year.  I am so glad I asked him to stay.  This is his first year to be here without her, which I am sure is very difficult.  We hope to wake up early and plan to have doughnuts for breakfast at the ranger station.  Sign up starts at 7, so we want to be there by 6.","Hurd brook lean to

And they got to see a moose cross the trail in front of them (not close).  So sad we are not going to see one but we did pass a lot of cool waterfalls and a pond we could rent a canoe at if we wanted.  It was an easy walk to the ranger station and we got our permits.  While she was filling out our permits the other ranger radioed in new names for the list, #9,10,and 11.  Hmmmm.  Turns out the group decided not to sign in without their friend. Which is fine by me.  Since we were first to arrive we got our pick and chose the shelter.  We need to be fast tomorrow so we will not have to pack the tent. We borrowed day packs from the ranger station.  They have a lean to for us to leave ours.  We then obsessed about what to take (how much water, snacks, extra clothes).  Finally some others arrived and they said the group that didn't sign in had chosen to just walk in and summit tomorrow since they couldn't all get in the Birches campsite.  I do not feel bad because we didn't get in yesterday and that is what we would have done today if we didn't get in.  So the others were gathering sticks for a fire (not much left in the area) and Navigator went to the ranger station to buy a bundle of wood.  We had a nice time by the fire but we have had a long day and want to be up extra early.  We went to bed at 7.  We did not set an alarm, but I had no doubt we would be up early no matter what.  Our plan is to be hiking by 5.  We have to get up and back down by 3 to catch the shuttle, so we have got to get moving early.  If we can't make it we will have to come down before we can summit, because we are not allowed to stay in the park a second night.  And the fine is $250 each if we don't leave and try to camp in the park.  At least it is not supposed to rain until late afternoon tomorrow.  But it is very cold already.","Abol pines camp ground

The first mile was great, relatively flat with manageable rocks and roots, then we started getting steeper.  We came to a stream and stopped for water since it is the last certain source until we get down.  Several hikers caught up to us there, and quickly passed us.  The sun was up enough to put the headlamps away and we were glad to do so.  It was still cold, but we took our puffy coats off (those are the lightweight down coats which are very warm).  We climbed up and reached the 'monkey bar' which is a piece of re-bar you grab to walk up the rock face and then pull yourself over.  The rock is very steep in this section.  Right after was another piece you had to wedge yourself in rock and get a foot on to climb up.  We both agreed we were taking the other trail down because the 6 foot drop would be too hard to safely descend.  And then we were above tree line and still climbing the rock face.  We finally got up and then crossed the plateau before hitting the summit.  It was so cold and windy! Our friends were coming down but stayed to take our pictures before leaving.  We did not stay long.  We carried the Pepsi to drink at the top but it was just too cold so we put on our puffies and started down.  We came to the other trail down a mile later nand started down it.  It is a mile shorter which means steeper-and a rock slide in 2016 meant loose gravel to slide on.  But we got down the rock face safely and a lot easier than the other trail although we both slid down on our backsides in a few places. Officially we are not on the AT but only the miles to the summit count today (total today would be over 10). We had reached a reasonable slope and were at a great pace when I decided to trip and fall.  I hit the ground hard and rolled on my back holding my right wrist which I was afraid was broke.  Thankfully just a good bruise and small cut to the palm.  So we finished the descent and reached the road.  We were about 2 miles from the place we started (and the big packs) so we used the privy and ate some peanut butter crackers  before walking down the road.  We got lucky and hitchhiked back so we reached the ranger station before 1.  We ate snacks and drank the Pepsi and then more drama.  2 men ran up and said a girl had fallen and cut her head really badly and needed help.  They were the group we had issues with yesterday.  The rangers sent them running back with a radio since neither had actually seen her so didn't know how she really was.  About 30 minutes later they all walked back into camp (there were 10 or so).  She had a good cut on her forehead and they advised her go to an emergency clinic.  Our shuttle came at 3 and we were in the van and on our way to real beds.  Once we checked in and showered we walked to McDonald's for dinner.  It was 1.3 miles and worth every step there, although I regretted the walk back on a full stomach.

And then we packed our feed bags.  This means discarding all the excess packaging because we don't want to carry it and there are not many trash cans around the trail.  The food barely fit (again we bought too much) but we managed.  And then across the parking lot to Chick-fil-A.   We haven't had that since we started the trail, and we knew it was near Walmart so there was no doubt it would be lunch and maybe dinner as well.  We walked to it (maybe .2 miles) and were disappointed the lobby was closed.  The sign said they had a staff shortage so no eating in.  Ok.  I sat with the bags and Navigator walked around to order.  We had just gotten the food when the clouds darkened, so we moved under the awning to make sure we stayed dry if it rained.  Literally we had just started to eat when a police car pulled up and approached us.  He asked if we had been to Walmart, and then told us they were looking for shoplifters that had reportedly walked to Chick-fil-A.  He said 'don't go anywhere' and went back to his car. I have not been this pissed in a while.  He talked to someone on his radio and another car came.  Then he came back to us and asked if I had any tattoos on my arms.  Clearly I do not.  So he decided we were not the shoplifters and left.  Definitely put a damper on enjoying the food.  And then the manager stepped out and asked us to move because we were in the pedestrian walkway- laughable as the lobby is locked up. At least the clouds had moved on.  So we moved around the building where our next first occurred.  A woman tried to give us money.  She thought we were homeless.  We declined and explained the lobby was closed and we have no car because we are hikers.  But the afternoon was just surreal.  We finished eating and got an Uber (same driver too) and set off for the trail.  We have had no sleep so knew we weren't going far.  We reached our stealth spot and set up the tent.  We tried to read but there is no focus and even though it is only 7 we are calling it a day.","Roanoke VA

We got to watch a beautiful sunrise as we moved out.  We have not had such a wonderful sight before, and somehow neither of us took a picture.  But the beauty of the red ball rising with pink and tangerine around it is unlikely to fade anytime soon.  We will have to start our days sooner to make sure we get to watch again.  It was warmer this morning as well, although it has not been cold like it was further north.  But it is going to be warm today, and that means slower hiking this afternoon because we are back in the heat and humidity.  I also realized that I was hearing crickets as well.  They say the crickets speed up as the temp increases, and it is true; but I don't know if you can really predict the temp based on them.  All I know is I was sweating and hot well before lunch.  We have hit a section where water is not at the shelters, and several water sources are marked do not drink.  A lot of the water sources are dried up to puddles but we have been ok so far.  Today is a solemn day to hike.  20 years since the world turned upside down.  There are kids we are hiking with who were not even born when America was attacked.  I remember hearing about the attack while at work.  My disbelief as they showed the planes hitting the buildings.  It was a long day of uncertainty and I spent today remembering that day. We finally got to the shelter and again have enough water to reach the next source tomorrow.  The mosquitoes are fierce, and I need a shower badly.  So glad tomorrow will be a town day.","Wind rock campsite

The haze in the sky increased through the day and I am worried it will rain sooner than predicted.  The other concern is water.  A lot of the creeks are dry or barely flowing. Trail maintenance is also sporadic as we push on. Some areas are very overgrown with briars and  I know why some people hike in pants. Although I think some of these would tear through the fabric because I am certainly scratched up. We finally started down the last mountain of the day and passed the shelter.  Not stopping because the tent sites near the creek will be better.  I do not know why the name is Dismal Creek, because it is a pretty little creek and a nice flat tent site. But I did not name it.  We quickly filtered water and cooked dinner.  The days are definitely shorter so we had to use the light to finish reading.  We made it further than I thought we would after leaving town,  but we are feeling it now.  I am sure a good night's sleep is ahead.","Holiday lodge

We made great time to the road, although we both managed to trip and fall before we got there.  But now delimma time.  We crossed a beautiful suspension bridge over Kimberling creek.  And the creek is also very nice....wide and deep.  But the guide says to not drink.  Evidently there is raw sewage in the creek.  So we did not get water.  We climbed over the next hill and worried about having enough water. The sky is clearing now and it is hot.  We continued on to the power line and I almost hurt myself jumping around the snake that I looked down and saw.  When Navigator got to it he poked it with his trekking pole and it was dead.  Very odd.  We kept going and found a nice campsite to stop for lunch.  Now we are almost out of water, but about a mile from the next source.  Unfortunately it was not a great one, but water is the most important thing out here, so Navigator scooped the water into the bag and we filtered it.  We kept on, and then another dead snake on the trail.  What is going on? This one was an icky gray color and dead longer.  But still.  We climbed up to the shelter and stopped for a break.  The stream is dry.  3 miles to the road and we have to climb over Brushy mtn.  Just before the road a trail angel has left jugs of water.  We filled up, but there is no water at the next shelter, so we decided to stay here and camp.  It is better to climb when it is cool so we don't drink as much.  Kind of feeling like PA only the rocks are much better.","Stealth camp

Despite being overly full we started back up the trail.  The thunder started a little while later and we decided it was better to quit early at the shelter and stay dry.  Of course there was not a lot of rain even though the clouds looked really bad.  Still better to be dry and not in the elements.","Stealth camp

We kept going down the hill and were able to get water from a pond.  There are warnings posted about the bridge being out ahead and needing to wade across a creek.  So when we reached it I was happy to see it was so low I didn't even take off my shoes, we were able to rock hop across.  But the sign other bank shows 1 to 5 feet depth markings.  This is why we are worried about water- everywhere is dry.  After the low creek we climbed over the next mountain and stopped for water on the other side.  It was a trickle. And the rain seems to have fallen harder in this area..... Navigator sent me on to the shelter while he filled the water bottles since it is sprinkling again.  I passed a huge black snake on the side of the trail and didn't even slow down.  The shelter was shockingly right on trail.  Of course we are here alone again, we have only seen one other hiker sectioning north today.  That is ok- we aren't disturbed as we read and put the tent in the shelter to keep away from the mosquitoes.","Jenkins shelter

We started the morning by finishing the climb up brushy mountain (evidently there are a lot of brushy mtns around here) and across a dry stream.  We then got to cross several fence stiles and through pastures.  At one point there was a bunch of cows blocking the path.  Charolais cattle, which can be unpredictable so it was good they moved on when they saw us because there were no trees nearby.  There was also a carcass of a calf laying in the field.  And then over another fence and up the next mountain. There was a great stream, but cow manure just isn't a good thing, so it was fortuitous it was cool and we aren't drinking so much we need to use it.  We did meet a day hiker on our way down.  We stopped for lunch on the next crest and I looked at the guide.  We have 6 miles to I-81 and a truck stop that I know has a sink to wash hands and a Pepsi to drink.  Time to kick into gear.  That and the rain is looking probable.  We got 2 miles down trail when the rain began. We stopped to put on covers and kept going. More field, another stile to climb and then the road that takes us under the interstate. The rain did not last long. I was surprised that we could hear the traffic for several miles before we got to the road. Traffic was at a standstill going north and I joked we were definitely moving faster than they were.  So we got to the gas station and got to use the restrooms and get our soda.  There was a nice picnic table outside and we enjoyed the break.  We took off the pack covers and moved on across the road back into the woods.  Over the river on a footbridge which was more a long boardwalk, then over the railroad tracks and back to the woods, which included Granny Smith apples and I picked up a few to eat later (missing the blueberries). I had my heart set to sleep in the old one room schoolhouse from 1894 that is right on trail.  And again we were the only ones here.  There is a public restroom (running water!)  And a nice Pavillion with picnic tables and outlets to charge phones, so a great place to spend the night.  The settlers museum is closed, so no tour for us, but the schoolhouse is a rare treat and shockingly open for us to just walk in and spend the night.","Knot Maul shelter

The dew fell heavy last night and my shoes got wet but I was determined to not slow down.  We went under power lines that made so much noise I honestly didn't want to go under them.  But this mountain is between me and my destination so under we went.  I guess I didn't realize how much I wanted Arby's because we were at the road at 10, and called a driver to get us to Walmart where we shopped in record time.  I am still remembering our last trip to a Walmart so made sure we kept the receipt just in case.  We organized our food and walked down the road to Arby's (passing many other fast food restaurants which smelled SO GOOD!). And then.....finally.... our stop.  For the first time in a long time I was actually full.  Which made it harder to leave.  We called Jimmy the shuttle driver to take us back to the trail.  He has a van that he gets every hiker to sign.  It is quite colorful and definitely stands out.  I wish I had thought to get a picture.  Of course we are immortalized on the van now.  And now back to work.  It is just too early to quit, and the trail is good so we went to the next shelter up.  It was later than we wanted to arrive, but it has been a great day.","1894 school house

Of course the wind was blowing really hard and we were chilled as the mist blew over us, so we put on rain coats and kept going. We got to see the barn which used to be a shelter but was decommissioned in 2019.  Camping is still allowed. The overmountain men rode through this gap on this date in 1780 on their way to King's Mtn where they defeated British troops in a revolutionary war battle.  Fascinating that these men from TN, VA, and NC were willing to supply their own food and ammunition for a long journey through tough terrain to fight for our country's freedom.  Has our current government reached the level of the British? Thoughts to ponder as we hiked. We ate lunch at the next shelter and then moved on to a parking area with a privy.  The shelters do not have them, so we took a break there (good thing we have tp- there was none left). We could see the welcome to NC sign on the road, so we are in TN for sure.  We had a snack and then up again to our destination, the highest shelter on the AT.  It is an enclosed 2 story log cabin.  And the temp is supposed to be 44 tonight, so we are going to be cold either way.  We are alone in the shelter.  There is one nobo section hiker here who cooked dinner and talked with us then went back to his tent.  It is cold and the wind is blowing, so we got in our sleeping bags at 7.  The door has gaps around it, but the wind is from the other side so no draft inside thank goodness.","Stealth camp

We stayed bundled up because in .7 miles we reach bathrooms and trash cans.  There was a random chimney on the trail, not sure how old but there was a house here at one time.  But what interests us is just ahead.  If we had only known the bathrooms were heated.  And had soap and running water.  We are already warmer and the sun is shining so time to shed extra layers.  There is an info-board about the Cloudland hotel that used to be here.  It was a luxury hotel built in 1884 and people would ride the train to Roan mtn station, spend the night in a hotel there, then a 12 mile carriage ride to this hotel.  It was $2 a day, $10 a week or $30 a month to stay.  They had golf, croquet, dance floor and spring beds.  And a line marked on the floor to show the TN/NC border because drinking was legal in TN but not in NC.  Interesting, but all that is left is a remnant of foundation, but the road is still here (paved now). It was a nice stop but of course the slow start means we can't dally.  We reached the first shelter in time for lunch again.  The spacing of shelters is nice but no privies is a definite negative. The water was also down .25 on a steep trail.  It was my turn to get it, but the piped stream at least had good flow.  The afternoon was much more pleasant because it had warmed up to 68 and we passed a group of 5 section hikers. The trail was also really good and we made good time to the next shelter.  Funny thing was seeing hoof prints on the trail leading to the shelter.  There are clear signs saying no horses at the road crossing.  We stopped for the night because the next shelter in another 13 miles, and the only camping ahead is only a mile more.  Staying in the shelters has become a habit, and it makes things much easier to pack up and get moving.  So far we have had no company in the shelters.  In fact little company on the trail at all except for the weekenders.  And that is ok.  Just different than the nobo hiking we were used to.  It will not be so cold tonight, expected temp about 50.  But we are still bundled up and reading in the sleeping bags as the sun is setting over the mountain.  Another climb first thing tomorrow......","Roan high knob shelter

We picked up a salad to pretend we are eating ok (diet on the trail is atrocious) and frozen breakfast sandwiches to eat in the morning, since we will be up early again. Navigator also got gloves and I picked up heavier long john's.  The smokies are looming and the cold is a threat we are taking seriously.  We rarely stay in a hostel but it has been a busy day and once again we have a climb to start with, so we enjoyed the rest.  Being right on trail is a definite advantage.","Cherry gap shelter

We made it, but there should have been a shoulder on the road to get us around.  We kept going.  The trail merged with another and luckily there was no traffic because I would have claimed right of way and probably had an accident.  And of course the sign for animal crossing zone was absent.  As we neared the end of the climb a bear ran across the trail about 75 feet in front of me.  All I really saw was his butt as he ran down the hill away from us.  It was an adventuresome day all told.  The rain was considerate enough to not fall until late afternoon.  We reached the last shelter and there were so many people there.  It was a surprise because this shelter is 1/2 mile off trail.

We used the restrooms (flush toilets with no sink-water is not drinkable....) and threw out trash.  The crowds were just too much so we did not stay long, and there was a little sunshine so we decided we needed to get to Clingman's Dome for a possible view.  And that was where the real climb began.  It is the highest point on the AT and I would have stopped but the shelter is another 1/2 mile off trail and I would just as soon not waste the steps.  So we climbed.  And when we got to the top there was absolutely no view.  I know it would be incredible because I have seen pictures.  Maybe someday we will come back on a nice day.  So instead we went down the trail 3 more miles to the shelter.  There are 2 people here on the lower shelf so we took the top.  We ate and hung the food bags just before the rain started again.  Feeling like Vermont all over again.","Pecks corner shelter

Navigator and Motivator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645239,"Every little noise had us awake and looking for a bear last night.  Our only visitors were much smaller as you can see.  The lack of sleep meant we were packed and walking just after sunrise.  The climb up Standing Indian Mtn was deceptively steep, and the descent was worse.  Again we passed a lot of day hikers on their way to the summit.  I remember the days when I also stopped every 20 feet to rest.  But seeing them means a road must be near.  We stopped at the shelter near the gap to eat lunch and think about how far we are going to make it today.  We are just under 8 miles from the GA border, and I want to get there.  So we kept going and passed that sign.  It was a welcome sight when we saw it.  13 down, and not that far to the finish.  What seemed herculean months ago is now just days away.  We passed up the campsites and went to the shelter.  What a surprise to find people there with a fire burning. There were 2 hikers there.  A 70 year old woman who did her thru in 1996, and an older gentleman doing a section hike.  This shelter is also a 3 level shelter, and very nice.  And it was nice to talk to someone who thru hiked before there were cell phones and apps to direct you.  She mailed her journal pages,  and stood in line for a payphone to call home.  So different from today.  They also have both hiked on the PCT and I forgot which one had 49 peaks.  Which means climbing the highest mtn in each state.  I guess some are easy, but some are really difficult. Never going to be on my bucket list.  We settled in for the night and listened to the crickets and watched the coals burning.  It was a long day after a bad night's sleep, but we are that much closer to the end.","Carter gap shelter

Navigator and Motivator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645248,"The other 2 hikers were awake and eating breakfast as we contemplated if we wanted to move at all. Of course we cannot finish if we don't get hiking, so we got up.  The man left as soon as it was light enough to see, and the woman stayed about 30 minutes longer to talk before leaving.  We finally finished eating and reading and took off after them.  Of course the .2 just to get to the trail seemed much longer; and then the climb continued.  We caught back up to her after about a mile.  She is only going to the parking area another 3.5 miles away, so we wished her happy trails and went on. Descending to the gap we spied picnic tables and got excited about potential trash cans.  Those hopes were dashed.  The other hiker from the shelter was at another table going over maps.  So we sat and had a snack and looked at the profile of the next climb.  I knew it looked steep.... and it was a brutal climb.  He took off before us and we barely passed him before reaching the summit.  We were so tired that when we reached the trail to the view we didn't even go.  Just a pic of the sign that said 'vista'.  Then we had a gentle downhill to the next shelter. It was .3 off trail which was really too far but we went anyway.  We got water and ate, and admired the shelter.  It is a double decker and very nice.  As we ate the other hiker came and he plans to stay because his shoulder is bothering him.  We finished and went back to the trail.  That .3 seemed much longer this time.  We had a big climb and even bigger drop.  There were several hikers we met on our way down....most taking breaks on the steep climb.  It is going to rain according to the weather forecast so we decided to stay in the next shelter.  As we approached we saw a lot of tents, and I was sure the shelter would be full.  Turns out only 2 guys on their first night of their section hike were the only ones staying the night in the shelter. Then we realized all the tents were on the ridge for the sunrise.  I hope the rain holds off for them, but I doubt it will.  A cold front is coming and the Temps are going to drop as we finish the trail.  Since we have lots of time we ate and socialized before reading and bedding down for the night.","Plum orchard gap shelter

Navigator and Motivator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645251,"The rain started just before sunrise.  I was watching the sky start to brighten when the wind started blowing really hard and then the rain began. So sad that everyone in their tents missed the sunrise, and now have wet tents to boot.  We tried to be quiet as one of the men in the shelter was still asleep (he tossed and turned for a long time before falling asleep). We did fairly well, since the pouring rain and wind masked a lot of our noise.  We were ready to go just at 8, and took off with raincoats and pack covers on.  We finished the climb up Tray Mtn and then began a horrible series of ups and downs that look like a W on the profile map.  The first drop was OK.  The rain had about quit although it was still dripping from the trees.  But the next climb was extreme.  We were glad to descend again to Unicoi gap.  But as soon as we crossed the road up we went again.  What a steep climb once again. We passed a few day hikers who had seen a bear in the gap.  They really do exist, we just stink so much they avoid us I am sure.  We got to the summit and paused to catch our breath before going on to the shelter.  We stopped for lunch and again tried to determine where to stop.  We want to have an easy day tomorrow on our last day, but the last shelter is 1.2 miles off trail so no way we are going there.  We decide another light day so just the next shelter and stop.  That will leave us with 11.5 to Neel's gap tomorrow.  So now we have to arrange a shuttle to get to the bus station so we can get home.  We were getting desperate when we finally found someone.  Now we just have to be on time to meet them. We reached the shelter and for the last time rolled out our sleeping pads and ate dinner.  There are a lot of section hikers here as well.  But it is cool and going to be downright cold in the morning- they said upper 30s tonight so tomorrow could be interesting.  For tonight we are trying to process that we are almost done....","Tray mountain shelter

Navigator and Motivator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645252,"Sleep was difficult last night.  I was worried about not getting done in time to meet the shuttle.  A late hiker joined us in the shelter shortly after we fell asleep. And the moon was shining so brightly last night straight into the shelter like a spotlight.  And at 6 I knew it was pointless to try to get more sleep, so we got up and for the last time packed our bags.  It is very cold so I left on my long sleeved shirt and leggings to hike in.  I also wore my Buff on my neck/ears and a warm cap instead of my hat.  And I put on my gloves. And still was cold.  We were leaving the shelter at 7 and heading to the trail using headlamps.  We got to watch the sky lighten to pink and orange then red before the sun came over the horizon and the sky was yellow for a little bit.  It was beautiful but no clear view because of trees.  We are on a mission to find the rock that gave way and let me fall and break my ankle.  So we kept a good pace down to the next gap.  And then our last big climb up Cowrock Mtn.  A lot of day hikers out again today, and once we reached the top I could see why.  A rock slab with excellent views.  We climbed on a huge rock and ate lunch even though it was very early to eat.  It was warm in the sun and not windy on that side of the mountain.  But we are anxious to get to the gap because we want pizza.  So we finished eating and once again hiked on.  We skipped the next view because it was again off trail and we had already seen it as we ate lunch.  And then we were on the last descent.  Bull's gap where we had planned to tent the night I broke my ankle.  Onward. I had no trouble recognizing the spot I fell.  And right there was the rock, just as I remembered it.  Shhhh. That rock is in Navigator's backpack.  I know they say take only pictures, but I think I deserve that rock.  We finally reached the mountain crossings store and dropped trash and used the restrooms.  No need to carry toilet paper anymore so we left that in the hiker box.  And now time for pizza and a Coke (still no Pepsi here) and we enjoyed them in the sun at the picnic table although it is still cool.  We have several hours to wait until our shuttle, and there are a lot of motorcyclists here but few hikers to talk to.  It was getting much cooler as the sun went behind the trees when the store employee who cooked our frozen pizzas came out and said they had an extra one just cooked if we wanted it.  Of course we do.  It is warm and tastes great (Red Baron pepperoni) so we split it.  And then our shuttle came early and we are now waiting to catch a greyhound bus to home.  But it isn't going to be here until 2:50 am.  There is a Waffle House next door so we will eat one more time before boarding.  It is hard to describe the emotions right now.  Elation, depression, disbelief that it is over.  Trying to reconcile the fact that we left everything to go walk in the woods for so long..... it is easier to not think about it.  For now we will just look forward to seeing our family and home again.","Low gap shelter
