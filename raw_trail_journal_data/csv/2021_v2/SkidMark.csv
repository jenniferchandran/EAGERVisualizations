SkidMark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626751,"Well in 20 days I will be starting my hike. Its been 5 years I have been buying gear for this hike. I guess it all started for me in 2014 when my good friend Warren Burbury ( Bull ) told me he was going to hike to Appalachian Trail. I started following him and others hiking the AT and started wanting to hike it myself one day. But didn't get my chance until this year, I retired March 1 of 2019 from Honda of America after almost 33 years. My best friend Doug is retiring March 20 2020 from Honda as well, and is going to do this hike with me . We have been friends sense 1980 worked at the same 3 jobs , McDonalds, General Machine, and Honda !! Wow is that awesome that we get to do this hike together or what !!
      Myself and 3 son in laws have hiked close to 100 miles of the Appalachian Trail. 2017 we did a section hike ... the roller coster , well that was interesting ! Not in shape at all and 37Lbs in our packs , wow we had a good time , and we made it. I have a good group of son in laws Wayne, Garret , and Brandon . Proud of my daughters for picking such great guys !! This year we hiked 33 miles in the smokies . My loving wife of almost 37years,  Corinna has hiked some of the AT at Newfound Gap , she and my oldest daughter, Trisha , and her husband Wayne will be hiking the first 2 days with us . I feel so blessed to have such a good family and a amazing wife to support me in this adventure !! Well thats all for now.

GSMP is not that smart .. a bear got into a tent and stole a back pack other people at the shelter scared it away ... so now they have the shelter closed they gave a tent set up and trail camara set up ... if the bear is not around for a month they assume he moved on and reopen the shelter !!! Really that makes no sense how about moving that dumb bear .. 1800 in the smokies so we got a dumb one that is lazy and wants human food .. how about moving the bear to a zoo and feed the lazy bear !!! When the GSMNP closed this shelter they Make you hike more miles to get to next shelter because you caint stealth tent in the smokies !! Maybe the director needs to call Yellowstone park or Utah and ask them what to do !! Move the bear it’s not rocket science  !!! And the charge you 20 dollars to hike through the smokies only place on the AT they charge you !! And not all shelters have privys , how is that possible maybe 10000 hikers a year at 20$ a piece do the math ... why is that !!

Our first day when we got close to Chimney rock Trail was steep with rocks outdoor fresh was through it and waiting on me looking down … when I got 15 or 20 feet up it I lost my balance and fell straight over backwards bouncing and rolling down rocks grabbing for a handhold , when I hit the bottom I then rolled over the hill and started down , grabbed a small tree and waited for outdoor fresh to come down and help me !! I was screaming all the way down !! Fingers cut to the bone knee cut up left him damage , had no broken bones just all cut up !! So yesterday brought the feeling of falling with no control  !

Got a shuttle ride to the trail had a 14.8 mile slack pack over the last bigger mountains until Katahdin , full packs tomorrow !!  While we was up top on white Cap mountain I was on the phone talking to my dad … all of a sudden a extremely loud noise … I started shaking , what was that I ask AARP … a F-18 jet flew beside the summit through the valley !! We was at the same level as the jet !! It was incredible soooo loud it shook your whole body , 30 sec later another one flew over !! They turned around and flew back by !! Crazy to experience that up almost 4000 feet ! Worn out after 3 - 15 mile days think we are both ready for this to be over !! Got to get my body healed up !!

SkidMark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644940,"Packed up and hit the trail wet tent from rain last night ! Weather was cloudy most of the day , the red squirrels are crazy in Maine ! They squeal at you when you get close to them and there is a ton of them ! Crazy things start shaking and squealing at you ! You get close to them too right by the trail ! Last night we was in our tents already ate and was resting by 6:00pm when these young hikers came in to camp and set up right by us ! There goes our quite time ! They was talking and setting up , they got up early and again was talking !! Three was set up right by me ! What a bummer ! It’s always nice to b by yourself but I guess they needed a place to camp to ! At least it didn’t rain on us today while we hiked ! Trail was not bad to hike most of the day ! Got to our next camp site , and had it to ourselves !! And it had two privies !! Score !! Goodnight everyone !","Stealth tent site mile 2137

SkidMark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644892,"packed up and started hiking , it rained most of the night still dripping from the trees when we got up ! Trail was full of water so it’s going to be another day walking in wet shoes and socks ! Had to change socks due to a hole in my right one the size of a quarter , my shoes are split out and when you walk in water it lets in debris grinds in the sock I stopped a few times to clean it out Don't have to far left to go so the shoes and spare socks is going to have to make it ! Only had a small climb today , we had a good camp spot last night got set up before it started to rain ! Today was ok weather to hike in cloudy and not hot ! Almost out of food woke up at 9:00 pm went through my food bag to see if I could eat anything else but no luck , had to save the some for next few nights ! Goodnight everyone !","Nahmakanta Lake
