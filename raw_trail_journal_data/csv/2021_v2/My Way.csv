I pasted Springer Mountain and hiked to Lance Creek, the last camping spot before bear canisters are required. I pasted three trail magics, but only participated in one. I hiked with Daniel,24, from South Carolina. He likes to go fast up the mountains, while I prefer to go fast going downhill. We keep a good pace together in the flat spots.

The shower wasn't working so I split and took off north. Nothing too eventful happened today! I did talk to RunDown who runs down hills and Casper, from Wisconsin, who is white as a ghost, hence the name. Physically and mentally I was in top form.

Town food is great! I really enjoyed a big meal at McDonalds. I had to take a totally of three showers today. The first one was needed just to look presentable in McDonalds! The second I had to take after the big meal, and the third to get some hot water to wash my cloths. When I came to check into Franklin Trail Hostel, trail legend Baltimore Jack checked me in. I also got to talk to Ron Haven, who I met my last trip on the trail. I plan on going to the free baptist breakfast tomorrow morning! They will come pick us up, feed us a nice hot breakfast, then drop us off back at the trail! We will see how it goes. It sounds pretty good thinking about it right now.

Leaving town is always hard due to having a full day supply of food and water. It makes my pack much heavier. The 2,000-3,000 elevation gain out of town doesn't help either. I hiked all day, other than a quick stop at Mom's grocery store to grab a Coca Cola & a fresh bottle of water. I ended up at Flink Mountain shelter late in the day. Due to the shelter being full I had to pitch my tent. I am starting to like being in my tent better anyways.

I am feel mentally and physically great. I really pushed myself to make it to Erwin town, where I checked into Uncle Johnny's hostel. I like staying here because they offer shelters into town for all three meals. I took both the breakfast and lunch shuttle! Town food is too good to pass up. After going through my food supple, reorganizing, and packing up I left around 2:30pm. I'm still currently hiking and have not decided where I will end up at the end of my hike today. I can't wait to get some cold water tonight. It has been a hot day and cold water really zaps the heat out of you. Today will complete a two week total of roughly 350miles. An act like this can not be done alone. I would like to thank my wife for her constant support. Also my two daughters who have always encouraged me to follow my dreams. I would like to thank my youngest daughter Kelsey for writing my journal as I call them in. Thank you very much Kelsey. Among others who have helped are strangers. All the hostel owners who do such a great job. Thanks to my trail family who watches over me. It a beautiful thing to see us all take care of each other during this journey.

That has been the norm the last four days. I have been doing around 25-30 miles a day, hiking till i have just enough light left to make camp, eat, and resupply on water. One day I even hitched hike into town with a women that was going tot McDonalds and Dollar General. Which was perfect, just the stopped I need to make.I got Ibuprofen and a few food ideas. I made sure to take advantage at McDonalds, a big mac value meal and hauled out three cheeseburgers to eat on the trail later. All of that only took 40 minutes and I was back out on the trail. All i do is eat, sleep, and hike. I think Ill have breakfast in Damascus tomorrow and head back on the trail with a full pack, full belly, and some good sleep.My feet are doing much better this week for some reason.

Today I hiked over Mt Rogers at 5,700 elevation with rocks and roots most of the way. It was a very hard hike. I tried to get a spot at Old Orchard Shelter but it was full. We are expecting rain so I pushed an extra 4 miles to Hurricane Shelter where I found some space.

I cut the day short to dry things out One of the young guys made a nice fire which helped dry things out. After I grabbed some space I went down to Mt Rogers Visitors Center to grab a coke.

He took me into Blane Virginia, to the Dairy Queen, which had a hotel right across the street. Wow that was so easy.

What a dream come true! I was out hiking by 8:45am. I did't pass anything spectacular along the way. I passed on going to Trents Grocery store because I had a full pack and it was 1/2 mile off the trail. I pushed onto Wapiti Shelter. A doctor who was a through hiker was traveling with his daughter.

It was a strong climb out of town, 2,000 feet elevation. With a full belly and a full pack of food, I was fueled up to make it to Baileys Gap. The next day I started hiking an hour before sunlight. I pushed hard to Niday Shelter. I could not see a whole bunch because if the fog but hiking was fine. I had another 1500 foot climb to start out the day. I walked past the Audie Murphy monument. He was the most decorated solider of World War Two and was killed in a plane crash near this spot. I hiked over McAfee Knob but was in a big cloud again so I wouldn't see very far out. There were many weekday hikers on the trail. I stopped at Catawba Mountain Shelter and for the first time this trip I had the shelter to myself.I was happy since I got to pick out the driest corner to keep everything from getting too wet. I slept in a cloud all night which made everything damp and musty. It rained again for the first four hours of my hike today. Everything got wet, not only from the mist but from the rain. I hiked over Tinker Cliffs, but town food was on my mind so I didn't stop for anything. As i got into Daleville the rain stopped. The sun started to come out as I checked into Howard Johnson Express. I was able to put all my wet gear out in the sun to dry. I did my wash and ate at Bojangles twice. I hiked 18 miles today. They predict more rain for tomorrow but I think I will head out no matter what the forecast says. I need a new food bag and shoes but I really don't want to wait around for the outfitters to open.

It had been two days since my last real shower. The thought of a hot shower made me push myself a little too hard and I got shin splints. I decided to do a double zero day in town, or should I say my body decided for me. But eating town food for two days sure won't hurt.

On Sunday, 13 family members and I celebrated Easter with brunch at the lodge. After my belly was full, we all walked down the road, said our goodbyes, and they watched me go up the approach trail.. I wanted to celebrate my 62nd birthday by starting the trail, so after the 8 mile hike, I stopped at Black Gap Shelter for the night. 
On April 2, I took off at 5am, and “night” hiked for 2 hours. It was a perfect day for hiking, but at 2:30pm it was already 80°. I knew it was time to find a place to stop. I pitched my tent and tried to cool off in the little amount of shade I could find. I made sure to take care of my feet try to eat. I do not have much of an appetite yet but it was a really nice night, dry & cool.
Waking up Tuesday , April 3rd,  was much like the day before. I started hiking at 5am, using my headlamp for the first 2 hours of my hike, which I don’t mind. Laying in a sleeping bag after 7/8 hours gets old. Even though it was raining, I had some pretty views. I stopped at the first outfitters to clean my glasses, get a shower, Coke, and a frozen hamburger. It all felt and tasted great. Like I said, the weather started out great and cool like yesterday but quickly turn into a furnace at 80°. That’s too hot in these hills when carrying a backpack, so I shut it down at 2:30pm and got in the shelter. There are no leaves on the trees here so I gets hot quickly. There are a lot of spring breakers and section hikers on the trail right now. They are usually keep a faster pace. I don’t need to be sweating since it’s hard to replace fluids. When the sun goes down, it’s bedtime. It gets cold fast.
Wednesday and Thursday were also great days for hiking. I hiked 31 miles on Wednesday.  There are a lot of great young people on the trail. This morning I caught the Ron Haven shuttle into Franklin,North Carolina. I need to get some more food, do my laundry, eat some real food take care my feet, and shower.
