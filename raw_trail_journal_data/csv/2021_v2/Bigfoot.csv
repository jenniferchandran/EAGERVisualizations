Bigfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632706,"Hello again!
Three months since surgery for full knee replacement and feeling fine.  As noted for 2020 I had to stop after only a week into my hike due to significant pain in my left knee.  After extensive rehab, I will be ready to go this summer to complete my last leg from Lincoln, NH northbound to Katahdin.
Made changes to gear as follows:  Switched out my Eureka for a Lanshen 2, thus saving over 2 lbs.  Also switched out my Osprey 65 pack for a Granite Gear 60 Crown 2, saving another 2 1/2 lbs.  All told with changes in other gear and being smarter about it I plan to carry 30 lbs down from 45 lbs in 2020.",,View Entry,"Feb 18, Thu",0
Bigfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633917,"Continue to work on getting in shape for what I hope is my final section of the AT this summer.  Did 5.2 miles with 15 lb. pack as a start to lengthening the distance and load in tune with overall rehab for full replacement knee surgery late last year.  With a lower pack weight this summer (30lbs) and much tougher terrain, especially the Whites, I got a pair of low cut North Face Ultra 105's.  Up to this point I have wore mid cut exclusively.   I will probably get a back pair of Keen Targhee III low cuts as well. ",,View Entry,"Mar 27, Sat",0

Bigfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637370,"I am doing this week  as a primer for this summer's final section of AT from Lincoln, NH to Katahdin, between mid July and mid September. 
Main check is my new knee replacement which occurred 11/16/20. Knee feels terrific...I feel 100% better than last July when I had to cut the Whites short by leaving after only 1 week.  Since then a new knee and 15 lbs lighter in the pack made for drastic increases to my mobility, stamina and enjoying the hike, even on the toughest terrain.
Met Forager and Quicksilver going SB enroute to just shy of Eagle Nest shelter.  Stayed at the shelter with Tyler and his dog Maggie. I tented. Tyler sheltered with Maggie. Tyler feared no bears as long as Maggie was with him.","Eckville State gamelands parking lot

Bigfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644414,"Long 0.4 mi technical trek to the campsite but well worth it.  I got there early enough to land a really good tent site on the pond.  Weather all day was perfect.  Two women hikers who I would later hike for the next several day,  one being Chipmunk and the other without a trail name, set up camp at adjacent spots next to mine.  Water location a little inconvenient but not bad. Just grateful to find water. However water sources seem to be appearing more regular especially with the rain during the past week.  Very strenuous hike up Barren Mt., more strenuous than expected since expecting difficult hikes to occur at Chairback and White Cap which are coming up.I heard cries form a woman in her late fifties from a remote side trail just N of Long Pond Stream Lean-to.  I thought maybe it was from an animal since from a distance they can be similar.  When I arrived about 300 yards going East on the trail a woman, named Rebecca was on her knees unable to get up.  She said she hurt her shoulder and needed help getting  up.  I made a crutch out of nearby branches to pull her straight up so she could stand.  She had little in the way of gear to protect her if this happened much later in the afternoon.  She arrived at her location via side trail about 0.8 mi. from a trailhead.  She was dropped of by her husband and son.  While I was there she got a cellphone call form her son who was on his way up to guide her down to the trailhead.  Her husband was also on the way.","Wilson Valley Lean to

Bigfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644427,Somewhat strenuous downhill into West branch of the Pleasant River where I had my first slip and fall of any consequences.  Made the ford across to within 8 ft of shore and due to sun glare on river and submerged rocks I slipped and landed on my right shin bone resulting in a baseball size egg on the shin.  A hematoma resulted. I quickly submerged my leg into the cold river thus abating any further swelling.  Lump went down in about 1/2 hour.  Slight soreness but no pain continued for several days. AT Guide got it right saying rocks were slick.,"Chairback Gap Lean-to

I arrived at Jo-Mary Rd where Mike from Shaw's met me with my food and some trail magic drinks.  However a large magic was provided by Bernard from Oklahoma including cheeseburgers, chips, candy, fruit and even toilet paper.Then minutes in to feasting it began to rain ungodly for 2 hours.  Upon finally making it to the lean to I met Gourmet from Michigan and 6 others including Scoutmaster from Georgia and Cajun from Louisiana.  Everyone stayed cozy, made dinner and had a good time.  Rained throughout the night very heavily and finally subsided before hiking out early in the morning.","Cooper Brooks Falls Lean to

Bigfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644432,"Planned for the Rainbow lean to but opted instead to go to Rainbow campsite, another 3.8 mi further.  I was planning for a short 4 mi hike the morning heading into Abol bridge on the 13th.  Scoutmaster and Cajun invited me to there KSC reserved site in lieu of The Birches but they were doing this on the 12th. So I opted to join them and skipped past Hurd Brook, the final lean to in Maine.  I liked gaining the extra day getting nearer the point I'd be heading home.  But as fate would have it all 3 of us would camp at The Birches due to a mix up at KSC.
Rainbow campsite had a to die for picnic table. I shared it with 2 gents who arrived there a day earlier and was camping for the weekend. One was form Atlanta, the other from Madison, WI.","Wadleigh Stream Lean-to

Bigfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644435,"Well the day finally arrived which I essentially started back in 2016.  The day could not have been scripted any better with temps in the low 60s and strong winds only 2 miles from the summit.  I got up and broke camp an hour in the dark so to give myself the time needed to do the round trip today.  The first mile as expected was relatively non-strenuous but quickly turned strenuous thereafter until reaching the Tableland.  At this point with 1 1/4 miles to go to the summit, the topography turned rocky and small bouldery underfoot making it strenuous for me during this final mile.  I think it was my painful shoulder that it made it so tough.  But seeing a large summit party already in progress just yards from the top gave me utter grateful pause and overwhelming appreciation for what we were all able to accomplish.  I got one of the other thru hikers to take a couple photos of me, one with clenched hands overhead and one kissing the sign.  I was told that you need to touch the sign to make it official so I went one step further with the kiss and got a loud round of applause from the celebrating mob.  I've got to say I was very happy to soon be going home but shall never forget the tough hike itself, the people I met and moreover the belief in myself as having the grit and determination top successfully accomplish one of the most difficult sporting events anywhere.Bigfoot OUT","The Birches
