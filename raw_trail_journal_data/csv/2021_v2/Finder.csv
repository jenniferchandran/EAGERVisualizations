Finder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634845,"A little over a month ago I was in communication with my hiking buddy from the PCT, MoJoe, about selecting a new pack. I was planning a few Sierra hikes this summer and wanted to try a lighter, smaller pack, possibly for doing the Arizona Trail next year.  MoJoe was planning on doing the AT this year, and he invited me to join him on this new adventure. So after thinking about it and getting my Pfizer vaccine, I threw my hat in with MoJoe and began my conditioning hikes around Marin County. MoJoe is a great experienced hiking buddy, and I'm very excited about starting on another long distance hike. I realize this will not be 'like' the PCT and that completing one long distance hike does not guarantee success on another, but I'm looking forward to the experience.",,View Entry,"Apr 15, Thu",0

Tamalpais, what better way than to do training hikes than in Joshua Tree National Park. My daughter lives in Joshua Tree, and we visited her for a few days last month to see a few sights in the Park. There are lots of old gold mines and mine artifacts to see and plenty of Joshua Trees and chollas. Chollas were singled out as the most deadly hiker plant while I was on the PCT in Southern California. I also got a chance to try my hand at beekeeping and slack lines, but that's another story.

Finder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635263,"I was satisfied with most of the gear that I used for the PCT but wanted to go a little lighter for the AT. I purchased a Gossamer Gear Mariposa pack which is two pounds lighter than my Gregory pack. However, I can tell that the Gossamer pack strains my shoulders a little more when the pack reaches 30 lbs. I figure I will not need traction devices, ice axe, or lots of water carry on the AT, so it is something I can live with. The Gregory pack was comfortable up to 40 lbs. I also found that things don't fit as well in the Gossamer pack, so I bush fixed in loops at the pack bottom to strap my tent (Copper Spur UL 1 HV). This gives me more flexibility to stuff things on the outside of the pack (I also added shock cord to the outside).
Last year, I also switched to a quilt as there were only one or two times that I was a little cold in my 17 degree mummy bag on the PCT. I got a 15 degree Zpack Solo long quilt with a foot box. I will continue to use my Therm-A-Rest X therm, which performed really well on the cold ground. I am also skipping a mid layer long sleeve warm layer to save on weight. If the weather is colder than expected further north, I'll send for my Patagonia mid layer. For rain, I added an ULA rain skirt and a hoodie pack cover. I wanted to leave my rain pants behind, but the kilt is see-thru, so that won't work on my laundry days. I also re-water proofed my tent fly and tent bottom. We'll see if the tent survives another year. I bent a pole last year in Desolation Wilderness during an overnight wind storm.
I am bringing an MSR pocket rocket stove, and new for this year, an Ursack. I'm as worried about mice and raccoons as I am bears, and rather than doing a bear hang, I think the Ursack will work, and it also fits much better in my pack than a bear canister. We will see how all of this gear works out on the trail. I've got my CNOC bag, a platypus, Sawyer bag and a couple of Smart water bottles. I'll start off with 6 liters of water capacity, but only expect to use half of that. Of course I've got a battery pack, InReach and other electronics, plus repair and personal hygiene/first aid supplies. For shoes, I'll start off in Altra Lone Peaks for about two 450 mile stretches and then switch to Merrell Moabs, maybe for as much as 700 miles, then we'll see. All gear and equipment starting trail weight, except food, water and trekking poles (and minimal hiking clothes that I wear) is 21 lbs.",,View Entry,"Apr 21, Wed",0
Finder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635554,"It was strange going to the airport on an early Saturday morning. I couldn’t remember the last time I flew on an airplane and the roads had very little traffic, even going through San Francisco. At the airport, all of the passengers were masked and seemed quiet.


Flying over the Sierras was concerning because there was very little snow, and California has already announced we are in a drought. I could pick out lakes that I had hiked to in the Hoover Wilderness and see rings around the shoreline already. I clicked on the in-flight tracker and the distance to Atlanta was almost the same as the entire AT.  What did I get for a snack, nuts and a Cliff Bar; I took that as a good sign.


My good friend, Chris, who lives in Atlanta, picked me up at the airport and drove me to his beautiful home, but not before stopping along the way at REI so that I could buy fuel canisters for MoJoe and me. We had a beautiful evening together that I will never forget with his lovely wife, mother-in-law (visiting from Argentina) and his daughter. We had lots of laughs between the glasses of wine and port that Chris picked up just for me. I got a taste of thunderstorms as one rolled through as we BBQ’d.

After a nice breakfast with my friends, Chris gave me ride to the Marta station where I had arranged to meet up with MoJoe at the end of the line. There we met up with our ride/shuttle, Ron, ‘Yellow Blazing,’ who used to be the ranger at Amicalcola Falls. On the way, we passed through a town that is the birthplace to NASCAR. Unfortunately, we went through so fast I missed the town’s name.


We started hiking under clear warm skies at 2 pm and made camp by 6:15 pm at Black Gap via the Hike Inn trail (1 mile longer but an easier grade than the main connector to Springer Mountain).  We saw almost no one but are camped with two other hikers. The site has a bear box.

We made quick work up to Springer Mountain, and took the ceremonial photos and signed the log located on the side of a rock in a stainless steel box. The weather was very nice, but true to the AT, there were few views. We had a couple of strenuous climbs but plenty of water opportunities.


We saw our first Ridge Runner powering up a grade like it was nothing. She said there were 20 people at Hawk Mountain Shelter last night. 
Gooch Mountain Shelter is two stories, and there are about 15 people here. There is also a nice piped spring where I was able to do a little clean up including rinsing out my shirts. I was also able to find one spot to text out a couple of messages to Donna.","Black Gap Shelter

Finder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636198,"Today was a climb to the top of Blood Mountain, the highest point on the AT in Georgia at 4,461 feet. Legend has it that this was where the Creek and Cherokee tribes fought a bloody battle, thus the name. The top had a beautiful stone shelter and lots of day hikers.


Before making it to the top though, I had my second find. We met two hikers that were going off trail at Jarrard Gap. Suddenly one of the hikers looks at a rip in his pants and says that he lost his knife. After they left, and short distance away, l found a knife. I wrote a note, dated it, and left a stack of rocks hoping he’ll find it tomorrow when he gets back on the trail.


We stopped at Mountain Crossing store at Neel Gap and changed our resupply plans. I actually was one dinner short of when we were going to hitch to Hiawassee. But instead, I bought three full days of food so we are going to skip getting off at Dicks Gap and instead go off at Franklin.
We went through the only shingled roof on the AT today through Mountain Crossing, through an old stone building at Neel Gap, and a resupply/outfitter store. Besides walking through the alleyway, this is where people throw their shoes up into a big tree, either because they give up or have already bought new shoes.


Speaking of gaps, the trail goes through a ‘gap’ then up, followed by a ridge, then steeply over a mountain, then down, then ridge, then down, then a gap. Rinse and repeat.
Today we did: Gooch Gap, Lisa Gap, Jacks Gap, Tritt Gap, Woody Gap, Augarhole Gap, Dan Gap, Miller Gap, Henry Gap, Jarrard Gap, Bird Gap, Slaughter Creek Gap, Flatrock Gap, Neel Gap, and we are camped at Bull Gap.

Sure enough there were a couple of cars parked nearby. One belonged to Paul who owns a hostel. Paul dropped off a couple of hikers, and he turned to us and asked if we wanted some baked goods. Trail Magic! I got a couple of small bacon scones that I ate with cheese for lunch. 


We saw our second Ridge Runner today. He asked us a couple of questions, and you could tell he was checking to see if we are prepared. As soon as we mentioned something about the PCT, he didn’t need to asked us anything else. We also passed a birder who IDed the Oven Bird we’d been hearing.


With a forecast for rain  tonight, MoJoe and I decided to try sleeping in a shelter.
At 7 pm we have been joined by two others in this shelter that can sleep 7. I did find a nice knife without a sheath near the shelter that I left on the picnic table. I also got some sort of rash on my ankles. Itchy!","Bull Gap

Finder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636202,"We had a little overnight rain while in the shelter last night, so we stayed dry. The trade off though was that I was on the platform with three other guys, and five minutes after one of the guys lies down, he starts to snore like rolling thunder. 


I had causally looked for my earplugs before lying down and didn’t find them but thought I’d be ok. That didn't last long,  I had to get up and start tearing through my pack to find them. MoJoe had left his earplugs in his tent pocket, so after I lay down, he got up and had to unroll his tent to get to his earplugs. After finally getting settled, I started to hear the pitter patter of mice. Oh well, the price you pay to stay dry.


Lots of steep ups and downs today, especially climbing over Trey Mountain. We’ve meet a few other hikers at Blue Mountain Shelter that we leaped frogged with all day. We keep trying to give them trail names. I think they think we are the two crazy old guys. We’ll see if any stick.

Seeing the Ridge Runner made us think about going off trail to Franklin, and we tried to make reservations at a recommended hostel. They were full, but we were able to find another that includes a shuttle ride from Winding Gap. The back and forth with the hostel was a little strange, so we’ll see what we bought.

We had one short very, very steep climb to get to the top of Albert Mountain, the site of a fire lookout. You can climb up the stairs of the now closed lookout and have a very beautiful 360 degree view. Our view included clouds building around us. We are going to have rain tonight and into the day tomorrow including chances of thunderstorms. Luckily for us, tomorrow is a planned resupply and hostel stay in Franklin.
 We are hiking in the Nantahala Wilderness. Nantahala is Cherokee for “land of the noonday sun”. We also went through Monney Gap, identified as the wettest places in the eastern US with an annual average precipitation of 93.5 inches! Along the way we passed the 100 mile sticks near the top of Albert Peak.



Tonight will be the second shelter night. The shelter is very small and primitive, and there are 5 of us in it. MoJoe decided to set up his tent instead, so he’ll have a peaceful night but a wet tent in the am.
We are here with two women, Peaches and Courtney, and two guys our age, Tim and Jim. Tim and Jim have hiked parts of the trail and gave us some tips for stays and resupplying down the trail.


 Along the trail today, I found a cardboard tube with a small watercolor and watercolor paper. I’m leaving them at the shelter.


Lastly, sadly, we came across a hiker sitting by the side of a dirt road with a badly sprained ankle. He called for a ride that was coming from Franklin, but it was taking a long time to arrive. It is probably the end of trail for him.","Standing Indian Shelter

Finder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636238,"Woke up this morning to heavy rain pounding the shelter’s sheet metal roof. MoJoe was out in the rain with his tent but was able to use the shelter to stage his pack. MoJoe and I headed out and hit the trail for the 3 plus mile walk to a main road for our shuttle pick up to Gooder Grove Hostel. Note that we walked past a paved road just a 100 yards from the shelter. The two women we stayed with were being picked up at 9 am by Gooder Grove at that spot. Hmmm....


Then, to add to our wet journey, I get a text that Gooder is a ‘man down’ and the shuttle can’t pick up, so take the public bus at 9:30. We wait with another hiker in the rain and load into the bus which turns around and goes back up the mountain we just came down, and back to the shelter to pick up 7 people there.


We all end up at the Gooder Grove Hostel except for one hiker who is going to the Sapphire Motel. Gooder is just a home filled with bunks and wet hikers. MoJoe and I see our room with a huge Huskie dog in it (which is in the basement area), and I think it’s got to be better. It also looked like one shower for all these hikers, so I look at MoJoe and whisper ‘Sapphire’. I go upstairs and dial the Sapphire Motel and book a room. We talk to Gooder and tell him we are moving on, and out into the rain we go doing a road walk in Franklin (I even checked Uber, but there were no cars).


Our room at Sapphire is ok, it’s a motel past it’s prime, but it’s only $66 for the two of us, and we have our own shower. After a quick Mexican lunch across the street, (an early Cinco de Mayo), we walk to a nice laundromat in our rain clothes (me in flip flops) for a well deserved wash and dry at the Community Coin.


After more chores, including a resupply at the Dollar General (Idahoan potatoes and Knorr) and finally updating this journal, we go out to dinner to enjoy beef tips, mash potatoes, and string beans (no collard greens for me) at Ms. Lois all American restaurant.
Late in the day, the photo upload app stopped working (no URL found) so I can’t upload any more photos at the moment. Maybe in 2 days I can get WiFi again. If not, it will have to be later.  Keep checking back to the earlier posts. I emailed trail journals about the issue. Perhaps the issue is on their side.","Rock Gap Shelter

The doors were closed....but the drive thru was open. So we walked down the drive thru and waited....and called out, but no response. Then a car came with a very nice women who let us order first. We walked to the window, got our food, along with buying extra for lunch on the trail, and enjoyed it in the motel room. 


On the bus up we met Smiles and Jetpack, two women who have completed the PCT and CDT, and are going for the triple crown (that's the Appalachian Trail, the Pacific Crest Trail, and the Continental Divide Trail). As the bus climbed the grade to the pass, it got darker and darker and the rain got heavier. We get out of the bus, and the two women are already across the road when lightning strikes with a thunder clap. We all let out a yell. Smiles is gone in a flash but we leapfrog with Jetpack and ask her questions about the CDT. All the while it is raining hard while lighting and thunder rumble.


We leave Jetpack as we climb to the high point of the day, Wymah Bald, that has a two story stone tower and observation deck. As we get to the top, the lighting starts again but eases up for a few minutes as MoJoe and I do a 100 yard dash on the open mountain to get to the tower. Big let down as it leaks, and the enclosure is flooded. Down the mountain we go another 1.5 miles to an AT shelter that is very nice but packed with hikers. Jetpack gets there as we eat our Scottish lunch. Smiles is already there. MoJoe and I are cold, and the rain continues in buckets. But, out the four of us go, but not before MoJoe takes out insulated gloves, and I get my gloves along with biker waterproof glove covers.  Luckily, after about 30 minutes the rain turns to drizzle and we power on to Cold Spring Shelter. 


We get to the shelter, but it is very small. There are two hikers already there who have totally soaked the inside with their wet packs. Since the rain eased up, all four of us climb a short ridge and quickly set up our tents as the rain starts again.

NOC is a small resort area deep in a gorge along Nantahala River. Did I mention that Nantahala is Cherokee for land of the noon day sun, because that’s the only time it’s sunny. There is white water rafting, a kayak course, and a tourist train. We ordered take out lunch and dinner. I ate a steak sandwich while drying my gear and packed pizza for dinner tonight. We also did a quick load of laundry.


While walking today I heard a load crack above me and immediately stopped and looked up and saw 2 to 3 inch diameter branch 8 feet long fall exactly where I would have been.

Lots of miles with ups and downs with my legs feeling weak from the day before. Our goal was Fontana Dam Shelter or bust.  As we started our 2,000 foot plus drop into the valley, we were excited to have views of the lake and dam. Our plan was to resupply for four days from the marina at the lake.


It was just shy of 5 pm when we got to the highway and marina road combo....and just as we stepped onto the pavement a shuttle pulls up and stops in front of us. We ask the driver about the marina store and a hiker getting off tells us it’s not good and to go the two miles into town to the grocery store. But this is the last shuttle of the day. So MoJoe and I look at each other and say this is meant to be. As we are driving along, the driver tells us about the resort and hotel rooms, and I say to MoJoe that we are spending the night at the hotel (there were no shuttles back). As we get out of the van at the store, there’s Jetpack. So we talked and end up having a wonderful delicious dinner with Jetpack and Smiles. Both MoJoe and I ordered to go sandwiches for tomorrow, while Smiles ordered a big pizza to go.

After breakfast, we caught a shuttle back up to the marina and started on our way at 9:20. We got to walk across the dam (tallest on the east coast, 480’, concrete gravity). The dam also had two separate sets of horseshoe glory holes as spillway and emergency spillway. 


After the dam walk, we came to the entrance of the Great Smoky Mountain National Park. Smiles and Jet got there at the same time, and we all dropped our permits in the box.


The climb up was cool. The top of the mountain had snow flurries this morning. Luckily, for now I’m very warm because I’m in front of a nice fire in a stone fire place. The NPS shelters are beautifully constructed out of stone with ample space to cook. I’m also on the second deck for the first time in a shelter. I don’t know what I’m going to do if I need to pee in the middle of the night. We’ll see how cold it gets tonight and especially tomorrow morning.

People are going to overwhelm Standing Bear on the trail, so I was able to contact a shuttle and reserve a room at the Best Western.

Getting there before the rain was good, but we ended up in the sub-platform under the main platform with just two feet between our platform and the underside of the platform above us. I called it the submariners. I figured if the roof leaked the people above us would soak it up.


The real rain started around 10 pm. Torrential downpours not seen in Marin. It was so loud it drowned out all the snoring. I stepped out to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night right into the mud bog.


We hustled out of the shelter in the morning and made it down the mountain covering 18 miles in just less then 7 hours.


Meanwhile, the night before I had lined up a shuttle and hotel in Newport. But the shuttle driver pushed the time ahead to 4:45. So, I cancelled my hotel room and the ride, and we just kept walking to Standing Bear Farm Hostel. 


When we arrived, we got pizza and resupplied for our hike into Hot Springs. Thankfully, we got a very hot shower.

Lastly, who showed up but Hannah, the woman who started the trail the same day as us and also writes a fun trail journal. I didn’t talk to her that much because my soot allergies from last night seem to be a cold and not allergies. It’s 6:15 and time for bed.","Tri Cone Corner Shelter

MoJoe and I kept a quick pace in the rain making 10 miles in 4 hours before our first break. No views today.


MoJoe made reservations at a hostel that is a very old Victorian style house. Elmer lives here with his dog and cat. No laundry at the hostel or in town (went out of business), and no real way to dry our gear (we got a fan and space heater but threaten to blow a fuse), but the hostel has a music room. 


We tried to do a quick dash to the local cafe then to the Dollar General. Meanwhile, while at Sunnybrook I got weak WiFi (no cell service in Hot Springs) and got a text from my sister-in-law saying she doesn’t have enough gasoline to drive far. It was confirmed when we went to the Dollar General, and the gas station next door had a sign ‘No Gas’. Those Russians! At least that’s what I’ve been told, Russian hackers. You hike the AT thinking you’d be away from politics, but noooo..... it follows you everywhere. We had planned for her to pick us up and stay with her overnight at her home in Arden, NC to resupply, do laundry, and all the other miscellaneous things that need to be taken care of. Now, plans may have to change. She says she has enough gas to get us but not enough to take us back or vice versa. Anyone know of someone who is going our way to Arden or Asheville on Saturday? We sure could use a ride. 
Back at Sunnybrook, the building is on the National Register of Historic Places. It was built in 1840 and was enlarged in 1875. The building has been used as a boarding house for decades. AT hikers have stopped here as early as 1948. We are in Earl Shaffers room, where he stayed in 1948 in what became the first publicized claimed hiking trip in a single season over the entire length of the AT. No one believed it could be done.

Actually it was a crown that came off from last night’s hard Knorr rice debacle. So I texted the info to Donna and Nancy and by the end of the day Nancy was able to get me in to see her dentist Sunday morning. I told them they moved mountains and molars to get me a dentist.


This of course throws off our fine hiking rhythm. I told MoJoe he can continue on without me, but he’s staying with me even with the many unknowns. MoJoe’s phone is also malfunctioning, maybe because of a bad battery, so he’s going to see if he can get it replaced.


Meanwhile, on the trail, we had many fine views down into the developed valleys below us as we navigated boulders on Big Firescald Knob and Big Butt (really). But, what would the day be without rain. First, we had a hail downpour just when we were passing a shelter and were able to take refuge. A little while later, we had more hail, then some sunshine, then about an hour of rain.

We came off the mountain and were met by my sister-in-law, Nancy, and her friend Teresa. Teresa was so kind to drive the 45 minutes up and then back to Asheville because Nancy still could not find gasoline. Teresa also drove us directly to an electronics repair store so that MoJoe could have his cell phone battery replaced. 
Nancy and Donna both worked really hard to find a dentist to see me on the weekend. Nancy was finally able to contact her dentist, Dr. Adam Hodges, who was willing to see me at 5 pm on a Saturday to work on getting my crown back on my tooth. He was an awesome guy and did a great job repairing the tooth. I was lucky that I had the crown and that there was no decay or other structural problems. Thanks Dr. Hodges!


We also fit in lunch at a great specialty taco outdoor restaurant, the White Duck, and a supermarket run. Then we got pie at a pie store. Then on to REI for food and a few gear repairs. Earlier, Donna had sent a box to Nancy's with my Patagonia R1 (colder than I thought), new CNOC bag (existing leaks), and cookies for everyone (delicious). I added a OR cap (sun hat not working in rain), and Nancy previously picked me up new Kuhn convertible pants (a zipper broke on the ones I'm wearing) and wool socks (I think the Darn Tough gave me the rash, not poison ivy)


Nancy and Ted have a beautiful new house along the 12th fairway of a golf course. While eating dinner on their screened porch MoJoe saw our first black bear wander across the golf course. I missed out by the time I got up to look.The dinner was takeout from a really good restaurant, I had baby back ribs and this great corn side dish, plus key lime pie.

They were not her dogs, and she was laughing that she was being tracked. About 40 minutes later we came upon two more Red Bone Hounds going north with trackers. They saw us and stopped, and the male started growling and being aggressive. I thought that if I was mauled to death at least they would be able to find me with the collar trackers. MoJoe and I talked to it nicely, and then when it relaxed, we took two steps until it growled again. We did this repeatedly until we were able to pass the dogs.
Tonight is my first bed in Tennessee, but there ain’t no privies in Tennessee, or bear cables for that matter. For some reason, as someone told me, Tennessee shelters do not have privies.

Down the mountain we went and across a major river in the Nolichucky Gorge. We passed by Erwin, Tennessee where most hikers were headed to have food or stay the night. Up we went through a lovely forest with a rushing stream. We saw a medium size snake with brown, tan and black marks. Don’t know what it was (not a rattler), maybe a copperhead. Near a shelter and behind a log, I found a bear vault with just two coffees in it. I kept the coffees but put the expensive bear vault in the Shelter. 



The day’s highlight was as we crested the Beauty Spot (a bald) on the border of North Carolina and Tennessee. The bald offers a panoramic view of the Cherokee National Forest. Some people in a nearby parking area waved us over. They were part of the Billville group returning from the annual Trail Days Festival and hosting Trail Magic. I got a beer, a chicken wing, and corn chips. They were very nice and claim to be the longest continuous trail group going to Trail Days, the largest backpacking event in the world.

MoJoe made some noise and the coyote thought it was between two predictors and took off fast. 



The big climb of the day was a 2,200 ascent of Roan Mountain. We went past the highest shelter in the AT at over 6,000 feet. We won’t get this high again on the AT until Mt. Washington in NH.
As we came down, we stopped at a parking lot and a nice gentleman offered to take our trash. He has hiked the trail before, and we asked his trail name: Three Fingers. You guessed it, he was missing his ring finger. He lost it by hooking his ring on the edge of a pick up truck. Ouch!

As we came down off the peaks, it got warmer and the skies cleared. It turned out to be a beautiful warm day. We have been dodging in and out of North Carolina and Tennessee, but today we said farewell to North Carolina for good. We also passed the 400 mile sticks.


I got a little dehydrated this afternoon and ended up drinking 2.25 liters of Nuun electrolytes to get my energy back.

Then at the end of the day, we did a pointless 2,000 foot climb up and then back down a mountain only to end up at almost the same place we started before the mountain. Along the way we called a hostel in Hampton and made a reservation for the night.


As I was moving fast downhill, I suddenly heard a buzzing sound and immediately did a backward cat jump because there was a huge rattler on the trail. It was about 4 feet long with 11 buttons on its tail. I started looking for a stick but MoJoe picked up a 10 foot tree limb and was going to try and flick it off the trail. Trying to pick it up bothered it enough that it started to go in the brush. I ran pass it followed by MoJoe while he tried to get rid of the branch at the same time.


We arrived at a main two lane road next to Lake Watauga with fast moving traffic. We went to a pull out, and I stuck out my thumb. A big king cab pickup truck pulled out of a side road and immediately pulled over to pick us up. We jumped in the truck bed that already had two college age guys in it, plus 4 guys in the cab. They drove us to the hostel and then invited us out to dinner with them. We said we needed to check in, but they insisted on waiting for us. We jumped back in the bed, and we thought we were headed to a BBQ place in town, but we got on a highway and drove 15 miles to Elizabethton (for OCMS fans, I almost made it to Johnson City Tennessee). The four gentlemen and two guys were so nice to us. 

The hostel is called Braemar Castle and is a stone house built in 1909 as a commissary for the railroad/logging company. The company apparently logged all the trees in the area in about 25 years and then pulled out of the area. Stuart Brown’s grandfather bought the place and ran it as a boardinghouse.

The Virginia Creeper Trail is a major bicycle route and has plenty of day ride trail tours. I might go bike riding tomorrow since we are taking a zero day. The town is packed with people.

When I got up around 5:15, I saw first a red and then a white light bouncing around 100 feet up the hill. When the sun rose, we saw only 2 tents and MoJoe and I speculated whether there was a third. At lunch, at a closed visitor center, we ran into Rocket, who we’ve been leap frogging for a number of days and he told us what happened.


It was Rocket camped above us, and when he was packing his gear in the morning he saw a small clawed hand reach under his tent flap to take a roll (Honeybun). He whacked it with his guidebook and the raccoon ran around the other side of his tent and tried reaching again, scratching the tent. He jumped out of his tent trying to switch his red light to white light and grabbed his trekking poles to whack the raccoon away. That did the trick for a moment, but then raccoon circled his tent while he quickly stowed all his gear in his pack and ran off. But only 10 minutes later, he passed a mother bear and two cubs. He had a busy morning. My Ursack (made of Kevlar) remained untouched in our camp.


We had a nice day with no rain, although this evening it is hot. We went further then we originally planned, and now we are close to an interstate and a cafe. The new plan is to have breakfast at the cafe tomorrow, and then have a short day and stay at a hostel for resupply, shower and laundry.


A couple of things I’ve forgotten to mention in my posts are about the birds and rhododendrons. Almost every morning and a lot of evenings, we hear the most amazing bird calls. There are dozens of bird calls that are all very unique and foreign to me. I think some of the birds are called warblers. It is difficult to actually see the birds, although I’ve spotted a pileated woodpecker a couple of times.

The trail tread today was very good, except the last two hours, and we made good time to the shelter. There wasn’t any water in the last nine miles so we had to do a water carry.
Something I haven’t discussed which is different than the PCT are the AT ""white blazes."" The Appalachian Trail is well marked with white painted rectangular ""blazes"" on trees (or power poles, posts, etc.) 6-inch-long by 2-inch-wide. These “white blazes” serve as markers to let hikers know they’re on the right track. If there are two blazes side by side and the left one is higher, then you make a left turn, and vice versa. If the blazes are two one on top of another it means straight (but sometimes there are two side by side).
Painted blue blazes on trees means a trail to a water source, unless there are trail signs, then it just indicates a non AT side trail. When hikers refer to a yellow blaze, it means they are road walking or catching a ride on a highway.","Jenny Knob Sheltet

I called it the deadly three step vine snake. Tomorrow morning we go for fours days before resupply and then on to Waynesboro, hopefully in a week, for our next resupply box which includes new shoes.","John Spring’s Shelter

After checking Guthooks and the posted comments, we knew that we’d have 10 miles of no water with a questionable source at the end before a climb to a planned dry camp. We loaded up with 3-1/2 liters of water at the last creek and continued up the mountain in now about 85 degree heat with 80% humidity. Ultimately, it was a beautiful day and we had many nice views of the valleys and mountains.


When we got to the first road connection with the Blue Ridge Parkway, the president of the Appalachian Long Distance Hikers Association (ALDHA), Ken Bunning, was there with ice cold lemonade and soft drinks for hikers. We were the first, and I drank a liter of lemonade. Thanks Ken.


About an two hours later, Joe was parked at a pull out where the AT crossed the BRP, and he had small snacks and water. Thanks Joe. About two hours after Joe, we cross the BRP the last time before a climb to our camp and there was more trail magic. Mr. Mayor, a thru hiker, and his girlfriend and friend were there with pizza, spaghetti and soft drinks. They were just packing up so MoJoe and I were the last hikers to get fed and watered (18 wheeler was there too). 


So in the end we hauled 7-1/2 pounds of water most of the day and all the way to our camp site. Plus we are loaded for food for four days that we did not touch. Tomorrow we pack heavy once again, full food and water. The last five miles up, 2,500 feet, has no water along the way or at the shelter that we plan to stay at. We plan to cut back on the miles.


Something I forgot to mention yesterday is that we met a Ridge Runner and since we are thru hiking, she gave us backpack hang tags. These are two inches across Tri corner shape plastic tags that say AT and the year and signifies that we are thru hikers. They are souvenirs, and if you complete the hike you get a certificate. There are some outstanding issues about the certificate this year because of COVID, but I hope they get resolved soon.","Daleville (Super 8)

The total climbing for the day was 6,000 feet. With another hot day and little water on the trail, the long ascents can suck the soul out of you. We went all the way up to 4,200 feet elevation and saw a very large FAA radar dome that we’d seen in the distance yesterday, now we saw it up close. Tomorrow we drop down to 650 feet elevation to cross the James River, and guess what, begin another long ascent.


Late last evening a hiker, Kitty Hawk, an older hiker, joined us in our tent area. This morning he left before us by about 15 minutes. Later in the morning another hiker that we had met before, Lens, passed us. About ten minutes later we came upon Lens with his phone out and looking at an iPhone on the ground. I picked up the phone to see if there was a name and saw that there were reading spectacles attached to the back. Because of the glasses, and knowing no respected young hiker would ever be caught with those glasses, MoJoe immediately said that the phone had to belong to Kitty Hawk. I said that since Lens is a fast hiker his mission is to catch Kitty Hawk. Long story short, we ran into them later in the day, and Kitty Hawk got his phone back from Lens. We credit this as a team ‘find’.

We had occasional nice views of large expanse of wild forests, even though there is a highway, railroad and a hydroelectric plant along the river.

Our shuttle driver was early, and so were we; so we got into town by noon. Our driver showed us around and left us at the far end of town where we were able to get a free shower at an RV park. We also used the time to dry out our tents.


Next, we walked ten minutes to a laundromat and started laundry as we went for BBQ food for lunch. Once lunch was done, so was our laundry, and we went to the Post Office to mail stuff home. I mailed my puffy (too hot), rainpants (you are wet all the time, and I’ve taken to hiking in running shorts I found), wash cloth (useless, use bandana), and some straps and such. I’ll have the puffy sent back to me when we get to New Hampshire. 


After all the chores were done, we went to the Family General for resupply, then to Subway to order food for dinner. By then it was 4 pm and time for our ride back up the mountain.

Tonight I am making my first Ramen Bomb which is a packet of ramen noodles and instant mashed potatoes. It is a carbohydrate overload, and exactly what you need when hiking. I used smoked bacon potatoes with a beef ramen packet. Mmmm good, but very hot. 


I found some clean toilet paper today and gave it to someone. The full story is I was hunting for a spring near a trail camping area and found clean unused TP in a freezer bag. So I brought it back to the campsite and placed it next to a fire ring. Just then three hikers showed up looking for the spring, and I pointed them in the right direction. I also told them I had just found clean TP if anyone wanted it. Sure enough, one guy was ‘running low’ and eagerly took the TP.

Because of staffing shortages, Stanimal recruited Obie, the AT yearbook editor, to come by with his special customized bus to bring hikers back up the mountain. I jumped at the chance, and off we went, side window missing and enough stickers and artifacts to look at, we were at the trailhead before we knew it.

Then the second wave hit, and then a third. It was a good feast. There were also showers available, but we moved on ready to go after having eaten Kit Kat bars, shakes, and bacon and egg muffin sandwiches. I also got a sandwich and corn chips to go for lunch. I am carrying three days of food, but I need to find one more ‘wayside’ in order to buy three more days worth so I don’t need to go off trail.


We passed by the 900 mile rocks, and also met another Ridgerunner. Only this Ridgerunner works for a club. I may not have talked about ‘privies’. They are mostly above ground screened latrines that you throw sawdust or leaves in the toilet seat hole after pooping. Some only have three sides and a roof. They are found at shelters or huts.


Someone though has to move the poop around when it gets full. And when it gets real full, they move the superstructure over the old pit and let the poop mellow for two years before spreading it in the forest. Well this Ridgerunner’s, Easy Going, job today was to spread the two year old poop around and pick out trash. Talk about a tough summer job; who wants to sign up? He was fun to talk to and very upbeat after finishing his work today. Easy Going you are amazing.

They have a clear pond with ducklings, mowed grass, a town clock, people on ebikes, and flower boxes. This was not the regularly schedule program. Boiling Springs comes from the cold 58 degree clear water that at one time appeared to be boiling out of ground near the town center. 


We stopped to eat brunch at Cafe101 which was excellent. Kitty Hawk bought two specials and a side of bacon. I had the backpackers special with added strawberries. We did a quick 1 day resupply across the street at a well stocked small convenience store (I also bought ice cream to go). Then we cruised across the 13 mile valley at warp-speed stopping briefly at a farmer's pond for a bite.


Along the way, we ran into Syrup and Maple (a dog) that we saw 4 days ago. We also ran into Reckless Abandon who has his own YouTube channel and is preparing to apply for Survivor. We also crossed the Pennsylvania turnpike. The tenting at the top of the mountain is good and flat and there are about a dozen tents. Tomorrow it’s on to Duncannon for another resupply before the final push to Hamburg / Port Clinton, PA and a resupply box. BTW, I think the pits were for charcoal to make iron and the crop circles was damage from the thunderstorms.","Creek Camp (1116.0)

We headed down the mountain and as we got to the bottom, there was trail magic waiting for us, and we were the first to partake. (I think this is the fourth or fifth time). Since I was lucky, I had a Lucky Streak beer and bacon dogs. Thank you Darrel for the trail magic!


On to Duncannon where the first stop was the outfitters store for resupply...and a shower. The outfitter has a small bunkhouse in the back, and for $5 you can take a shower. Kitty Hawk threw some laundry in at the next door laundromat, and I got my socks and bandanna washed too. I washed my shirt in the shower.


We stopped at Doyle’s for a beer and burger. It is a very old renown tavern. To celebrate our two month hiking anniversary I bought a beer for MoJoe and one for Kitty Hawk (for finding a beer). We are in Pennsylvania and I’ve seen Amish folk walking around town. As we left town, we stopped at an ice cream store and got milkshakes. Duncannon is a nice small town that dates back to the 1700’s when they established a ferry to cross the rivers.


We then crossed two rivers on long bridges, the larger river is the Snoquahanna, and then began our 1,500 foot ascent back to the ridge tops. Our shower and food binge were soon a distant memory as the temps and humidity were high, and we were sweating like hogs. Once on the ridge, the trail was mostly very rocky and difficult and slow to walk. We didn’t get to camp until almost 7 pm. We caught a couple of views including one to the east that had tall cooling towers, could it be three Mile Island?
There is not much water in the ridges, and the water source at this shelter is the hardest by far to get to. I think it has 590 steps down a steep mountain. You need to get two liters of water, but then you need to drink a liter just to climb back to the shelter.","Darlington Shelter

I think tomorrow it’s suppose to be 90 degrees and like 85 percent humidity. This leads to sweating rocks, or rocks that have water on them. I think it has to do with the dew point and the rocks being cooler because of the ground.


One thing about thru hiking is that you are always on the lookout for a trash can to get rid of the trash you carry. We came to a road crossing where the trail magic cooler was empty, but the sign said it was ok to leave trash in the cooler. That’s a form of trail magic. Woo hoo.


Later as we were hiking, we ran into three women, a mom, her sister and adult daughter (Zee, Ann & Sarah), who had there stuff out by the trail packing up after finishing a hike on an AT spur trail. They were going to their car so they gave us their extra bars. Real trail trail magic, thank you.


Of things I wasn’t expecting was running into a beaver dam and pond. I didn’t think this forest and this far south near metro areas could support beavers. But, we had to cross the mushed up dam that hikers had thrown extra sticks on top of so that we could walk across (otherwise the trail was flooded). We made it across with dry feet. Later we got to within 4 feet of a turkey hen that thought it was hidden, and we saw a very large rattlesnake that I walked right pass.
I also met Country Boy, a man in his sixties, who supplements his meals by foraging for food. He showed me tea plant (tastes like wintergreen and can be used in teas) and tried the leaves. I tried Silex which tastes like asparagus, and Indian Cucumber, which the root tastes like cucumber. I also saw Trilium without flowers, but all the plant parts can be eaten.


When we got to our planned camp site with ‘seasonal’ water it was bone dry, so we kept hiking until we got to a road about a mile away. A car pulls up and a guy asks us if we want trail magic. Of course, so I got an ice cold drink and an apple. Very good. Thank you Trail Angel.

He could also slack pack us which meant we could hand off our packs to him and hike without the burden of our full weight so it's easier to hike.


So, we made reservations for two nights at the apartment, and he took our packs in the morning, today. We slacked packed with one small day pack that Kitty Hawk had, exchanging the pack every half hour. It was very hot and humid today with long dry trail sections.

But last night DWG went crazy with fireworks. One of the local hikers told us that Pennsylvania has lax fireworks regulations. Residents can buy their own sophisticated fireworks. The large booms and flashes started at 6 pm and didn’t stop until midnight. Of course we were in our tents outside the church and were kept up.


Since it is the fourth and there are fireworks across the country, I want to mention the evening shooting. Since Virginia, on most evenings, at most camp sites, you can hear gunfire. Sometimes the gunshots are at gun or hunting clubs, sometimes it’s in people’s backyards. Sometimes they are close or done in barrages. But shooting when you come home from work appears to be a big pastime in the southeast. One time it went on until 9:50 and then went all out with huge caliber firearms and total barrage and then abruptly stopped at 10 pm. I figure it was a gun club with set hours. I mention this now because as we get close to the suburbs and cities I expect the evening gunfire should ease off.The scenery today has changed. We are seeing more lakes, including clear glacial (dug out mountains from the last ice age) lakes. The canopy is more open and we can see views regularly of the valleys below us. I expect to see more development, but the large area that we can see is very green and forested.

Yes, it was a tough day because of all of the little things that added up. The climbs were not the hardest or longest, but there were constant bugs, and because of all the rain, the trail is very muddy and slippery, thus you spend a lot of time navigating around bogs and puddles.
However, at the end of the day we stopped at a blueberry farm that lets hikers camp on the lawn. The folks here are wonderful. There used to be an elderly woman that gave cookies out to hikers and let them stay, but she had to move away last year. Her family sold the farm to a young couple that have carried on the tradition. Interestingly, the former owner's husband built an airstrip and a hanger. When the young couple got the farm they got everything on it, including an old Cessna 170 and an Alpine Sunbeam (dismantled). I got to see inside the hanger, very cool. MoJoe also got to hand crank some vanilla ice cream for us, and we added blueberries right off the bush for dessert.

I think another thunderstorm is headed our way, and it has begun to lightly sprinkle.","Shaker Campsite (1541.5)

Soon after we started hiking, there was a short major downpour, but then a dry rest of the day. The trail was muddy at first, but after our coffee and second breakfast stop in Dalton, the trail got much better and we picked up speed. 


We got to Cheshire by 3:30, but Wendy and Michelle (MoJoe’s daughter) were still on the road, so we picked up a few more miles, but only after stopping for a shake. Cheshire is known for giving President Jefferson a 1,235 lb wheel of cheese on New Year’s Day in 1802. Amazing history.


Just after Wendy arrived to pick us up, it started raining. All evening there have been severe thunderstorms rolling through while I’m safe and dry in a motel room. The news said that this has been the third wettest July for both New York and Boston, and the month isn’t over. Lots of rain and lots of muddy trail.


Tomorrow is our third zero day. Unfortunately, because of the weekend and supposed bookings, we’ll need to change motels (currently in Lee). So, we’ll be in Adams tomorrow night. We still need to find a shuttle for Monday morning. We will be back into real mountains and headed to Vermont. Although people on the trail are calling it Vermud.","Blueberry Hill aka Cookie Lady 1562.6)

We needed to change motels because the one in Lee was booked, and we would also be closer to the trailhead where we left off. A shuttle will bring us back to the trailhead tomorrow leaving at 7 am. Wendy brought us here today. 


We spent an hour in Adams old town center which is undergoing a rejuvenation. There are rail to trails,  a tourist train stop, and old brick buildings. I read in the town historical newspaper that the largest elephant in the US around 1850 died here when the bridge it was crossing collapsed. It had also previously killed four people. 

The local news tonight reported that it has rained 14 out of the last 18 days. Also, an area west of here has had over 18 inches of rain in July so far, when the average monthly rainfall for the entire month of July is 4 inches. The forecast is for rain 3 out of the next 5 days. Just keep walking.","Town of Lee, MA

We started our climb up Mt. Greylock, the highest point in Massachusetts at 3,491 feet, in a heavy fog and drizzle after an all night rain. The trail was muddy and slippery. My shoes, socks, and feet were immediately wet and stayed that way all day even though the drizzle stopped after Mt. Greylock. The top was a disappointment as you could barely see the top of the 93 foot high lighthouse style monument built in 1931.


Onward we hiked, sometimes the trail was a creek. We crossed into Vermont, and I almost slipped into the mud trying to take a selfie. I did slip climbing a rock pile and cut my hand by my thumb, so my hand is throbbing tonight. We passed the 1600 mile mark today. Hikers made numbers out of ferns, sticks and rocks. Lastly, apparently the Vermont Long Trail overlaps the AT over a long distance, so this evening a whole bunch of new hikers are camping near us. It will make tent spaces a premium. I think the VLT goes north to Canada.","Outlook Ave. Cheshire (1582.3)

You just try to avoid the deep mud bogs and try not to slip on the wet rocks that come at you every few minutes. We went through Glastenbery wilderness area. I got a notification that parts of the AT are underwater along the Housatonic River and there are reroutes. I checked radar and more big storms are on the way. The tent sites are very poor here, on slopes and roots with lots of evidence of big water flows. I hope I choose wisely.","Seth Warner Shelter (1602.4)

The mud and trail creeks are taking their told mentally and physically, especially on my feet. Just today I got three blisters on one toe, and one I think is infected. We had very, very intense but short thunderstorm last night followed by rain that added to the trail water flow. Only light drizzle during the day for a brief period.


So I need to take a break, and I don’t know if I’ll be back. One of the guys at the shelter tonight has done this section three times and has never seen so much mud. He says it’s always muddy but not like this. Tomorrow we hike out to a road for a planned resupply and overnight stay at a hostel in Manchester Center VT.","Goddard Shelter (1624.0)

I need time to physically have my feet recover from skin condition issues, and mentally I’m just not able to continue hiking the miles at this time. Today I hiked out to a road and went to a wonderful hostel, the best I’ve seen on the trail, Green Mountain House, in Manchester Center, Vermont. I booked flights out of Rutland through Boston to get back home to California.


I’m sorry to leave MoJoe, my wonderful hiking partner, but I know he’ll continue on stronger than ever. He may even bump back in with one of our past hiking buddies. I plan to write an epilogue on the flight or once back home. If the feet heal quickly, and the wildfire smoke isn’t bad, I’ll do a fun short Sierra hike just to get that old feeling of joy back hiking in the mountains. Other trails await, if not one day finishing the AT.","Stratton Pond Shelter (1643.4)

Leaving Rutland Regional Airport, I could see Vermont from the air and it is beautiful; a lot of green, small farms and tidy villages, ski runs and wind turbines, and mountains. Lots of forests.
But, from the trail you are in the forest and the scenery does not change much. It does however change, but slowly, as you hike north with vegetation and tree species gradually changing. But as the trail gets harder, you focus down to a 5 foot by 15 foot box in front of you, planning your next step, and the step after that, avoiding roots, slippery rocks, mud, sometimes probing with your trekking pole for soft spots in deep mud or solid rock. You use your poles to lift yourself for high steps or brake on the downhills. Your focus for 9, 10 or 11 hours a day is totally on the trail tread in front of you. Usually you're only stopping for water or lunch, which are the few times to admire the beauty around you. I think the monotonous grind is one of the reasons I’m leaving the trail.
I haven't worn sunglasses since the first couple of days on the trail back in April. The AT hike is below the tree canopy almost the whole distance I hiked. You get very filtered sunlight poking now and then when there is no cloud cover. We had many days of cloudiness, or if clear in the morning, it would cloud up by afternoon. I never saw a sunrise or a sunset, never saw the stars or the moon, an unobstructed clear view rarely happened for me. Many peaks were in clouds or fog. I did not see where I hiked from during the day, or where I was going. I think these were other issues that made me leave the trail.
One of the things I will miss the most from this trail are the bird songs. Much more varied and continuous than in California. I can listen to the birds while hiking and concentrating on the trail at the same time. As we hiked through spring time, I could hear the chicks chirping then later the adolescent birds calling for food. I heard the Whippoorwills at night and morning bird calls telling me it was time to get up. I never set an alarm because of the birds, and MoJoe only had to come by once or twice to see if I was awake in the morning. Then there were the evening bird songs playing taps for me at dusk as I laid in my tent.
I will also miss how the trail heightens your senses. You are more attuned to noises and smells in particular. You hear a branch breaking far in the forest and the way the trees creak in the forest. You hear the frogs and insects, sometimes a little too well. If the wind was right, I actually could smell a day hiker standing still before I saw them (no joke). We always remarked how day hikers smelled so sweet and somewhat chemical-like, probably from the laundry soap, shampoos and deodorants.
I’d like to thank all of the volunteers that maintain the trail, the organizations that support the trail, get funding, and support the hikers. The trail angels were wonderful and generous and caring. My first trail Angel was one of best friends, Chris. Thank you so much. The hikers and community were wonderful. I feel I made some special friendships with Jetpack, Smiles, and Kitty Hawk. And of course, I would not have been on the trail but for MoJoe. Thank you MoJoe for all the miles and smiles.
I could not have done the trail without the support back home from Donna taking care of the house with Daniel, and sending me packages with special treats, and encouraging me to hike the trail.
As I head back home to the brown dusty hills of smoky California, I know I will miss the green trail and hiker camaraderie that had been part of my life the last three months. I will shave my beard, my feet and wounds will heal, but the trail memories will linger with me. I end my journal as I did with my PCT hike:
Some trails are happy ones,
Others are blue
It’s the way you ride the trail that counts
Here’s a happy one for you
Until we meet again, 
Happy trails to you.","VT Rt. 11/30 (1654.0)
