WhichWay,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633410,"At LONG last my hike is actually going to happen!!! Originally I planned to leave in 2019 and had most of my gear researched and the majority of items purchased. However, due to the need for a hysterectomy my hike had to be postponed. I was disappointed but thought, ""2020 has a great ring to it, this will be a better year to start."" Well, the pandemic wiped those plans out completely along with the plans of millions of other people. Lives were disrupted and rearranged in ways completely unthought of. 2020 was a time of unprecedented events which the world will feel repercussions of for decades. Now is the time! The world and all the towns within it are beginning to reopen. Vaccines are now available and by social distancing and the use of masks people and businesses are feeling more confident about opening up again. My parents are in good health at the moment, no babies are expected while I'm away and my health is still in a great place. I have planned my start date as June 10th and preparations are being made to make that date a reality. ",,View Entry,"Mar 18, Thu",0
WhichWay,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633780,"This year is flying by so quickly. I’m sure that is due in large part to the excitement of realizing my hike is going to become a reality this year and how my days are filled up with taking care of everything I need to do before I go. I want to have my portion of the yard work as completed as possible before I go so I don't add that layer of guilt to myself. Besides, I really do enjoy getting outside and digging in the dirt. The rewards are great when the yard looks like a park and it’s so enjoyable to be in. I have a long list I would like to accomplish before I take off. Aside from the continued research, training, and gear preparation, I am trying to ensure the house is well supplied with essentials such as toilet paper, soaps and animal food. I want to stock the freezer, help my daughter with her newest little one when she arrives, plan a housewarming/good bye Mary party, visit my family in Florida. The list is full of tasks to hopefully make life a little easier for Bill while I'm gone as well. Of course there are the projects in the sewing room I would like to finish up and deliver before I leave too. If all these things weren’t to get finished before I leave the world would not come crashing down, but I would carry a bit more guilt as I pick up my pack and leave my world and its tasks behind for others to pick up. I am forever grateful my dear sister-in-law Bonnie who will be here at home helping with daily routines and providing company for Bill. I am also happy I have kids nearby that will come entertain my husband on occasion and friends that will drag him out for a dinner or other activity while I'm gone. 
I could not do this hike with a clear conscience if it weren't for the support of my family and friends. I want to thank all of you for your love and support and for putting up with my constant rattling about this great adventure!!!",,View Entry,"Mar 24, Wed",0
WhichWay,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638268,"The calendar is dropping dates quicker than ever before. It is difficult to believe this adventure I have dreamt about and researched, prepared for with so much physical and emotional energy, is actually coming to be. My emotions are all over the place. I’m filled with so much excitement and anxiety, I’m constantly going over my to do list and praying I can pull everything off. Every time I cross something off my list I think of something else to add. In many ways I feel like I’ll be heading off to a very extended Girl Scout camp. Excitement for the adventure, fear of my ride home leaving and heading down the road, leaving me behind with only what is in my pack. What will the next few months bring??? Each day will be like opening a long awaited Christmas gift, some more exciting and cherished than others. As I write this I have 8 days left before we head to West Virginia, 10 days before I set foot on the trail in Harpers Ferry and take my first official steps! 
Hike on!!!

WhichWay,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639141,"Day1  June 10, 2021
I started hiking at about 12:30pm on a 90 degree day, the hottest yet, it was so hot!!! Got hit with all the things on my first day, heat, rain, rocks and elevation changes and I’m still glad I came!!!  
I saw some beautiful cliffs and so many other gorgeous scenery variations. I re-met Monkey Toes who we had given a ride to her hotel the day before. Today I met Grizzly Mad Scientist, Blade Runner, Grandpa Fuzzy, Skully and Skydog. Stopped for a break at the park in the rain and hooked up with skully and grizzly there. Would have liked to look around, very cool place with a lot of history but it was raining too hard. I was very glad for the rain. I kept my pack covered but let the rain help wash of my salty, sweaty body and cool me down.
I slept in the shelter with all the above as it was raining and raining and I didn’t want to set up my tent. 
Forgot to have my headlamp handy after bed, to get up in the night I slid my liner toward opening  leaving part on my mat so I could find my way back in the dark. Not much sleep, got cold later and lots of squeaky mats. 
Day 2  June 11, 2021
It rained all day long and surprisingly I didn’t really mind it. I did need to be extremely careful of my footing though, the rocks and roots become dangerous when wet. Today I got my first trail magic, a cooler with drinks, candy, and crackers! I wasn’t able to write any thanks in the little notebook they left because I was afraid I would ruin it with all the rain pouring down. Day was cut short due to trail blocked off for several hours because a man killed himself there along with his young son. So sad. By the time it was reopened we were concerned no spots left at the four person shelter and no one wanted to set up tents in the rain. Grizzly and blade runner stayed with me at the park and we hung up all our wet clothes and gear and prepared to sleep on the picnic tables.  We saw a doe with her baby fawn on the lawn! Well, the ranger came around at 8:20 and said we couldn’t stay. We had to pack up all our gear and wet items we had laid out to dry. It was a four mile hike to Pine Grove shelter in the dark. Thankfully the rain had stopped and the terrain was not bad. We saw three deer in the woods by way of their eyes. And, spider eyes glow when you shine your light at them!!! Thankfully there was space at the shelter when we arrived at 11:00. I slept like a rock!
Day 3  June 12, 2021
What a great but exhausting day. After packing up I set out alone but met a day hiker right away. Together, we went to two different cliffs which were right off the main trail. The first cliff, Annapolis Rocks, was beautiful and a deer was eating leaves from a tree completely unafraid of us a few feet away. The view wasn’t great as there was too much fog. That second set of cliffs, Black Rocks, however were great, the mist had lifted and the view was incredible. The hiker went on his way and I continued down the path. It was a great path for a while and then the last 2/3 of the trail was filled with boulders and rocks up and down it was extremely difficult. But so beautiful!! Bill and Bonnie were waiting for me at Foxville Rd along with Blade Runner!!! We took her to a hotel and we headed back to ‘Bates Hotel’. I spent the evening repacking, cleaning up and getting ready to go back into the woods Sunday. TOTAL MILEAGE TO DATE: 32.4","

WhichWay,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639354,"Day 4 -  June 13, 2021
I forgot to mention before but on day 3 I met my first ridge runner, Inside Out. He was so nice and helped me understand their tasks. They walk the trail in their area all day watching for areas in need of repairs or upgrades such as more tent sites. I feel very lucky to have met him, Blade Runner said she has only met one in the whole time she hiked the southern portion. Today we packed up the Bates Hotel and went for a late breakfast which ran even later due to how busy the place was. The food was great though and on the way to pick up Blade Runner at her hotel it started POURING rain!!! By the time we got back to the trailhead however the rain wasn’t too bad. It was VERY hard getting started and tough leaving Bill, Bonnie and Chance behind and knowing my ride was heading down the road. If Blade Runner hadn’t been there I know I would have started crying. 
It was a great day to hike but boy were we inundated with rocks and more rocks and did I mention rocks? It certainly made for slow going. We also encountered a lot of steep terrain. We stopped at a couple of viewpoints and it was amazing to see how how far up the mountain we had climbed and the incredible view of the world below. The second place we stopped, High Rock, had great views but it was ENTIRELY covered in graffiti, very sad and makes me crazy as to how disrespectful people are. While we were there some young boys were adding to the mess. 
We had a fabulous and totally unexpected surprise as we hiked into Pen Mar State Park, trail magic!!! It was the best sight ever!!! There was a tent set up, chairs, drinks of all sorts, ham and cheese, chips and candy. Several hikers were already enjoying the feast and relaxing while looking at the fabulous view. AKA was the guy providing the fabulous feast, he did a thru hike two years ago. After we left there it was less than a mile to camp.  And along the way we crossed into Pennsylvania!!! At the state line was a mailbox with a log to sign and candy! I have now hiked West Virginia, Maryland and am beginning Pennsylvania. We hiked on to a tent fabulous campsite where we found Skully!!! There were probably about 15 of us at camp. My first night in my tent and my first bear bag hanging experience which wasn’t too easy, thankfully Skully helped me but even with that the rope got stuck in the tree and we figured if it didn’t drop on its own we would cut it down in the morning. This day was definitely full of beauty, including a deer, a turtle eating a cicada, two cicadas doing the deed, hundreds of holes in the ground where the cicadas emerged a few weeks ago, a field of wildflowers, ferns, a field where the trees on the edge swarmed with thousands of cicadas and mountain top views. I also noticed several small branches on the ground with fresh leaves on them. Turns out when cicadas lay eggs near the end of branches it kills the end of the branch and it falls to the ground. Seeing that along with the other cicada activities of the day, the holes in the ground, the mating and being eaten I feel like I have witnessed their entire life cycle! 
Day 5  - June 14, 2021
I packed up the inside of my tent and when I came outside to find that Skully had left my food sack outside my tent for me!!! I truly appreciated that. Our campsite was gorgeous, down in a valley with a beautiful stream and huge trees. My tent opening had faced the water. However, now that it was time to leave the hike back out of the valley and up the mountain was grueling. I had to stop several time and Blade Runner was able to climb much faster, I figured I wouldn’t see her until the shelter. Eventually it flattened out somewhat. I passed the best shelter I’d ever seen, too bad it was far too early to stop. There were brand new benches, two picnic tables, one even had a centerpiece, a clean privy with toilet paper, a fire ring with four new benches, and two actual shelters. It was beautiful! I passed by there and hiked into the park for water and found more trail magic!!! And, Blade Runner was there. There were hotdogs being grilled over a charcoal fire and drinks and chips and cookies. It was the best hotdog I’d ever had. Blade Runner and I hiked on together for the most part the rest of the day. At one point the ground was a soggy, muddy mess. Boards had been placed to walk on but they didn’t go the entire length. So board walk, mud slop, board walk, mud slop!!! It really was funny! We took a side trip to Chimney Rocks where the view was beautiful and the rocks looked amazing in both size and shape. As we continued on we were both hot and ready to be done for the day, two day hikers stopped us and gave us each a cold and delicious special dark chocolate bar!!! We finally reached our shelter after 14.4 miles for a current total of 55.9!! The shelter was very nice with two units and Sky Dog and another hiker were already there. The surroundings were gorgeous and we enjoyed an evening visiting at the picnic table until the rain started, then we all moved to the shelters and visited for quite awhile, the guys in one and us girls in the other. The only downside is we had to walk down .2 miles to the shelter and down another .3 to get water. Looks like another climb out in the morning!!
Day 6  - June 15, 2021
Just as we were getting ready to leave we met yet another Ridge Runner!!! This morning the hike up and out back to the main trail was not as hard as expected. The day was perfect weather for hiking and the terrain not as tough as previous days. Blade Runner and I hiked together off and on throughout the day meeting up at different places as we do. We are both really happy we met. Who knows how long we will hike together but it’s nice for now!!! We went by two of the most beautiful shelters to date. I guess there is some kind of competition as to how great groups can make a shelter. They were clean and fresh paint, benches and one even had a porch swing and potted flowers everywhere, we wished we could have stayed but it was too early.  The trail also went straight down at one point and passed a very old cabin with a fire pit. We took a break there but it isn’t to stay at, I guess it can be rented. Another fun thing today were the wild blueberries, very tiny and not many ripe ones but the ones we found were delicious. There was also an area we walked through where there were thousands of ferns, a whole field of them. I’ve never seen anything like it. Animal views for the day, a snake and lizard and always birds!
I also met a family doing a section of the trail. There was a mom and three girls, ages 8,9 and 11. They started to do a short hike in North Carolina, got hooked and kept going. The kids need to be home by August so they plan to get to New York, take the train into New York and catch a flight home, amazing! Tonight we are staying in a small tent site a couple of miles from the shelter. It’s so peaceful here. The shelter we passed up was nice but filling up fast and this is a couple of miles closer to tomorrow’s goal, the half gallon challenge, the AT museum and a hostel. 
Day 7 - June 16. 2021
We woke up to a beautiful but chilly morning. Blade Runner and I were the only ones at this small tent site and we packed up slowly, had some breakfast and moved on. We planned for a short miles day so we could stop at Pine Grove Furnace. Along the way we passed two great milestones for Blade Runner, mile 1100 and the official halfway point!!! A few others were stopped there as well celebrating their milestones!  We had burgers and fries, first food I’ve really felt like eating. We then checked into the Iron Master Mansion. It’s an old mansion turned into a hostel and for $25.00 you get a nice bunk with pillow, sheets, blanket and a shower!! For another $3.00 you can do a load of wash. It’s peaceful and clean and well maintained. We then went to the AT Museum, filled with all types of information on the trail itself and it’s creators. Famous hikers such as Grandma Gatewood were also honored with their stories and some of their very heavy looking hiking equipment. Earlier today while hiking I saw my first orange newt. Also when hiking into Pine Grove Furnace Park I passed several privately owned log cabins that were simple and just beautiful. Pennsylvania is a state full of nothing but beauty, but of course I haven’t hit the miles and miles of rocks yet!!","

WhichWay,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639606,"Day 8, Thursday June 17
I can hardly believe it, I have been out here an entire week already. It has been filled with more than I ever dreamed of for such a short time. The trails themselves are ever changing. Some are packed hard with leaves, others are finely groomed by Mother Nature with pine needles, there are the black soil trails cushy like carpet, and of course the rocky and root filled trails. Some trails don’t appear to be trails at all and are just boulders erupting from the earth and huge with no way around but to crawl. Cicadas have provided almost a constant symphony just varying in degree as to how loud they are in different areas. 
This morning I awoke in a bed with clean sheets a pillow and a blanket! I was fresh and clean from the shower the night before and my clothes were clean and fresh when I put them on. Staying in hostels has many advantages. A cool guy, Bust Ace, was there in the kitchen frying up delicious potatoes and you could fry yourself some eggs and bacon to go with it. He was providing trail magic for anyone staying at the hostel that wanted it. The day provided amazing weather once again, almost had a fall quality to it. I believe 75 was the high. Even though the air is cool you still get amazingly hot hiking up and down the mountains. The trail for the first part of the day was perfect. The ups and downs were gradual, a couple rusty orange frogs crossed my path, I walked through fields thick with wildflowers, more ferns and crossed streams and creeks via small bridges or logs. After about 7 1/2 miles I made it to the Green Mountain General store and hooked back up with Blade Runner and several other hikers. We all sat outside enjoying our lunches. I had a delicious grilled chicken salad. We started back down the trail and it was nothing like the morning hike. The hike was filled with ups and downs and gnarly rocks. I hooked up with Fire Goddess for awhile which was perfect timing. We turned a corner and a HUGE pile of boulders awaited us, not to hike around but to climb over and under and every which way. Very fun, difficult and scary! We were glad to have an extra pair of eyes on our feet as we carefully made our way down and to hunt for the white blazes which seemed to want to hide. All this activity definitely made for slow afternoon mileage. I did get turned around for a bit at a campsite when I couldn’t find the blazes and went a mile out of my way. Blade Runner was at the shelter already when I arrived and Sky Dog joined us later. The shelter was great, very clean with floor space and two bunks that were higher. Sky Dog and I took the bunks and Blade Runner put up her hammock. There was even a brand new privy with windows! We had a great evening eating our suppers at the table, visiting and even creating a small campfire. 
Day 9, Friday June 18
We woke up to a chilly but beautiful morning. Blade Runner and I didn’t have breakfast because we planned on eating when we passed through Boiling Gap. The two of us packed up and hit the trail. There was a few climbs and descents but all were gradual. It was an interesting variety of scenery. One part of the trail traveled through forests that looked more like the jungle, other parts were filled with flowers. All along the way were mulberries. We got to Boiling Springs and I fell in love with this quaint little town. Our first stop was the AT Building which was still closed due to Covid. The mom and three girls that are hiking to New York were there hanging out on the porch. One girl is Grumpy, one Jumprope and the other ??))? There was a hiker box on the porch, a place you can leave what you don’t want and take something else. Inside was an unopened box of gluten free crackers!!!! Those crackers along with peanut butter and raisins was my delicious dinner tonight. We left our packs on the porch and went to eat at a fabulous cafe. While we were waiting for our food Skydog showed up and joined us. We sat outside in a grassy area on a really nice picnic table and enjoyed watching the town move around us and the huge, old clock tower on the edge of the lake where dozens of ducks swam. Afterwards, a quick trip to the grocery store for a few supplies and a stop at the outfitters for a new sleeping pad for Blade Runner. Back to the trail for a day of winding in and out of corn fields, over stiles (a structure or opening that provides passage over or through a boundry), across 1/4 mile of wooden walkway built over the forest floor and through the woods and fields of wildflowers. We saw lots of butterflies, more birds than ever and suddenly we noticed we weren’t hearing cicadas any more! Two plus miles after leaving town I made my first milestone, mile 100!!  At one point we met a hiker in his middle 50s. We never got his name but we dubbed him New York. We took off our packs, checked the log out for snakes and sat and visited with him. Turns out New York started a construction business in 2019, then Covid hit and work dried up. He couldn’t get unemployment due to not having a full tax statement for the full year. The bank took his work truck and his house due to foreclosure. So he did what he could with the contents of his house, left the key in the front door, loaded up a duffle bag and backpack and started to hike down the Appalachian trail. He said at first, for the first 100 miles his pack weighed almost 100 pounds!! He finally stopped at an outfitter, changed things up and is down to 60ish. He even carries a regular bed pillow! He has a bad knee so it’s slow going. He’s not in a hurry though because he doesn’t know yet what he’ll do when he’s done. 
Along the path today were blackberries not yet ripe and so many mulberries, our hands turned red from eating so many. 
So.... we had about 4 miles to go but Blade Runner’s foot was hurting her. We decided a hotel would e best and called one. They told us they would pick us up soon. While we relaxed on the grass we looked at local menus and picked out what we might eat that night and planned Denny’s for breakfast before hitting the trail again. After an hour no ride. We called back and were told they don’t pick up from there. What the heck???? We couldn’t get a shuttle and our short attempt at hitchhiking didn’t work. It was going to get dark soon so we headed back to the trail, saw a gorgeous doe watching us from the trees and found some water and a stealth camping site. There was no way we would be able to make it to the shelter before dark. It all worked out but nothing like we had planned. The night was very warm so we both decided to leave our rain flys off. Around 11:30 we were awoke with rain! We both got up and quickly threw tarps and rain flys over our tent and hammock. Back to sleep until i was awoke by hideous screams from some small animal being ransacked by who knows what. Seemed like I just fell asleep again, then I was awake again by someone running along the trail at 3:30am !!!! This section turns out is used a lot you trail runners, but 3 in the morning???? It was a long night! 
Day 10, Saturday June 19
Another beautiful day on the trail, but very difficult. We climbed up the mountain and down into the valley and back up and down again. We went through a meadow filled with wildflowers and hundreds of little white, yellow and orange butterflies dancing above the stalks, it felt like a fairy land. We walked literally through fields of wheat and along edges of farmer’s fields. The farms were older with large barns and silos all in perfect shape. It seemed as if we were walking within a postcard. In the afternoon our long, steep hike up the mountain was rewarded with the most magnificent view of Duncannon. Thankfully a couple of people saw us looking for the the blazes and told us the best way down to town. The side of the mountain was one crazy field of boulders and rocks. I can’t envision what work it took to take the stones and boulders to create the well over 200 steps down the mountain we were walking on. We were hot and tired and exhausted and very happy to be at the bottom. We walked through the town of Duncannon until we reached Kind of Outdoorsy, the hostel we were staying at. What a delightful place. Run buy a man who includes his parents to add to their income. The front of the building is an outdoor store and the back half is a hostel. The hostel is great. For $25.00 you get a bed with linens, a shower, soap and shampoo, bins and Epsom Salt for your feet, couches and chairs. And we were here on the right night, the owners were putting on a hiker feast for dinner. They made grilled steak, potatoes, salad, watermelon and catfish. I’m sitting here enjoying being clean with a full tummy, my feet soaking, and a snickers bar in my hand.","

WhichWay,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639608,"Garmin: For those of you tracking me and seeing inconsistent tracking that is due to my Garmin showing inaccurate charge so it wasn’t getting recharged often enough, hopefully that issue is resolved. Also, please remember to not reply to Garmin messages if you are one of those receiving them, start a different text just to me. 
Messages to me: I am receiving texts, emails and guest book messages on my journal and LOVE them, they help me to continue. Please don’t feel bad if I don’t respond, I have such limited service, but understand that I really appreciate everyone one of them. Thank you all for your support, love and prayers. 
How am I feeling?: This is a question I’m asked often. So far I’m doing pretty well!!! I have two blisters, one on the outside of each heel, I’m hoping they will callous over soon. We are staying in the hostel two , maybe three nights so I will soak them a couple of times. My left shoulder blade has had a knot but it is working itself out! Considering it is the first 100+ miles I feel very fortunate that is the worst of it. Tired and hot, but that’s okay. Never have breezes felt nicer!","

WhichWay,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639808,"Day 11, Sunday June 20  I can hardly believe it has been 11 days! With Blade Runner’s foot still bothering her we decided to take our first zero and stay in town. I didn’t sleep much the night before so was more tired than I realized and didn’t wake up until 9, I was shocked!! We took a walk down the street and ate at a little place that served a delicious breakfast. The place was mainly full of hikers. We then took a walk up the narrow street with little shoulder space to a pharmacy where Blade Runner bought inserts and I got band-aides for blisters and a few other small items.  Next the grocery store than back to the hostel. We did laundry and got some amazing ice cream, made phone calls and caught up with journals and touching base with people back home. It was amazing to see how many hikers were coming in and out of town as we walked around, we must be in the middle of the hiker bubble as all the NOBOs work their way north. In the evening we went to a fun Italian hole in the wall place to eat. It was cool. The front part was a take out for pizza and sandwiches. Then we found the back half of the restaurant where there was table service complete with white paper tablecloths. It felt like we were in a shady back room somewhere!!! Not Weird was sitting at the bar much to our surprise. He is hilarious, a young hiker with legs longer than my body. He’d been staying at the same hostel and saying he was going to go hike 20 miles that day for hours. It was funny to see him sitting there with his grin saying a hiker needed to fuel up before hitting the trail again. He was going to get started after his dinner. Blade Runner had a delicious plate of pasta with scallops and mussels and a couple of beers. No GF pasta so I had honey garlic wings with a side salad and a couple of ciders. When we got back to the shelter a hiker, Feather Blue, I met a few nights ago at the backer’s campground was at the hostel. Crazy how you keep running into people!! She had a food box shipped to her and didn’t want most of it so was giving the contents to whomever wanted them. I took a few items. Don’t really need to add much at this point due to weight concerns and more opportunities to resupply down the road soon. Overall a great first zero day. 
Day 12, Monday June 21 Today was my first experience with slack packing and I loved it!! A lady by the name of Trail Angel Mary was our shuttle. She said she got started 20 years ago when she found herself homeless and living in a campground while saving to move into an apartment. Even though she has lived in the area her whole life, and hiked with her father every Sunday, she knew nothing about the Appalachian Trail. Mary’s father always took them hiking off trail as he knew the woods well due to all his hunting. While living in the campground she met many through hikers and found ways to help them taking focus off her troubles. Eventually she moved into an apartment above the grill and continued helping hikers as she still does. This past year she was awarded lifetime membership in the AT society whose goal it is to maintain trails and help hikers. There is only one membership awarded per year! Our hike was perfect!! We climbed slight grades to take us to the ridge where we remained in he majority of the morning. Delightful breezes dried the sweat from our faces and views from the top were thick with the clouds that wrapped around us. As we were hiking along we were surprised to see Not Weird! Ha ha ha!!! He had gotten on trail after his dinner last night but only went as far as the shelter. It was great to see him! We met a gorgeous orange turtle slowly walking across our path and scrambled over boulders and rocks. At one point we could clearly see the city below and where we had started. There were some blackberry bushes but only a few ripe ones. When we were close to reaching the bottom we could easily view the crazy network of overpasses connected to the highway along with the railroad tracks. What a vivid contrast to where we were standing among the trees and rocks and ferns. Busy life going on below with no clue as to what was in the forest not far from them!!  Our hike took us back into town to the hostel we have been staying.  Along the way I saw my first bear! He stood about ten feet tall and permanently guards the front yard of a little house! And lucky for us, we walked right by the ice cream store! A blueberry sundae for me made with lemon blueberry crunch ice cream!!! Our hike was 8.5 miles and was so easy today due to terrain, low mileage and very light packs. After returning to the hostel we needed to wait for the cleaning lady to finish before grabbing a much needed shower. My outfit after shower consists of shorts way to large and a baggy t-shirt, quite the fashion statement!!!! There is a dresser where you can borrow clothes while your clothes wash, you never know what crazy combination you’ll find in there. We then headed for lunch where we ate last night. Steak salad and cheese fries for me! It’s so very hot today, we are glad we hiked it around and are just hanging out. We have our beds in the back half of the hostel and we’re hanging out. Then the mom, Turtle, and her three daughters, BoBo, Grumpy Cat and Jumprope showed up, they will be sharing the back half with us! 
Today was officially Hike Naked Day, we didn’t witness any participants. 
Day 13, Tuesday June 22 - Today we packed up and bade farewell to the wonderful hostel. I can’t say good enough things about it. It was a bargain at best and everyone was friendly and respectful. Trail Angel Mary picked us up at 8 and drove is back to the trailhead. She insisted we sign her journal and take our picture. It was raining so we were decked out in our rain gear. At about 3 miles in we stopped at a really nice shelter to get out of the rain for a bit. It was new with a loft and plenty of bunks and floor space.  Several others were there also and hadn’t left from the night before. After a quick snack we took off again with rain pouring down on us until early afternoon. It was better when we had tree cover as the leaves acted as small umbrellas blocking some of the water. Even with ponchos our clothes got wet, I guess due to condensation.  Our shoes and socks were soaked. Overall the terrain was not terrible but we did encounter lots of stretches where there were several slippery rocks so we had to be extremely careful due to how slippery they were. After the rain finally stopped early afternoon it was like hiking in a fairytale with mist all around us and several deer prints in the mud. We had places as well where we were sloshing through mud soup! Along the way we saw several orange newts.  They are so cute just sitting on the side of the trail. I also saw a beautiful black snake almost Slate in color. Blade Runner is pretty sure she saw a porcupine! The day went pretty well until I got lost and lost I was. The white blazes turned blue and I could not find the white blaze. Blade Runner is usually ahead of me so had no idea I missed the one blaze turning to the left. It made it more confusing because the Garmin would show me on trail then off to the right . The blue blaze took me on some overgrown trail and would show me on the trail then off to my right with no way to head back. All in all it was scary. I decided the blue blaze would take me somewhere like a road or parking lot so that was my best bet. Thankfully it dropped me on a gravel road 4,2 miles from the shelter we were supposed to meet at. I hiked the trail faster than anything I’d hiked to date and my clothes were soaked from sweat and feet wrinkled from wet feet all day. I later found out the area I was lost in is St Anthony’s Wilderness!!! I did see a gorgeous doe in the woods while practically running down that gravel road, she gracefully leaped over a log. By the time I got to camp Blade Runner was there and very happy to see me arrive. She was getting worried because I never am so far behind her. It took me a bit to grasp I actually made it and thanked God for helping me, it could have easily been a much worse ending. The shelter is an older one that sits up a bit and two mice live underneath. They were extremely brave and would come out playing and chasing each other. Thankfully they never ventured into the shelter itself. One really great thing about the shelter is it had a spring right there that was piped into a trough, it made collecting super easy. I set up camp and made dinner, mashed potatoes with peas and sweet potato chunks, delicious and am now happy to be safe in my little sleeping bag!
Day 14, Wednesday June 23
No rain today!! We stayed around camp a bit longer than usual this morning but did get on trail around 9. It was a beautiful morning!! We knew a crossing was coming of a creek and had been told it was flooded due to a beaver dam so we needed to use caution. Well, the two of us thought we would be proactive and cross at one point. After fiddling around we found the best crossing and went over. Turns out we crossed too early so had to cross back again. It was a bit of bad luck but when crossing one of my water bottles dropped from my pack and merrily bounced down the stream. Thankfully I still have other water containers and that is easily replaced when in town next. A bit down the trail we found the real crossing and it was definitely a flooded area due to the huge beaver dam we literally crossed over the top of. Very carefully at that, one wrong step we would have sunk to our knees in mud! We did less miles today than yesterday by about 7 but the day just seemed longer for some reason. I did trip and landed on the trail just scrapped up a bit. The funny part was trying to get back off the ground with my pack sitting on top of me; I felt the way a turtle must feel on its back but with my shell on top of me. We had a variety of terrain including open fields, think walls of brush with only a skinny trail between, a Boulder field to cross, sweet smelling pine needles providing an aromatic carpet to walk on and three mountains to climb and descend . We stopped at a shelter for the night and needed to go about .3 miles downhill to a spring for our water. We had one other hiker join us, we named him Speed MacQuine because he hikes so fast. He hiked 43 miles today, crazy! He’s a college student, super smart and studying aerospace and Chinese. He’s hurrying because he needs to be home mid August for an internship. Very nice young man, well rounded and will go far in life. 
I can’t believe I have been hiking now for two weeks!!!!!","

WhichWay,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639922,"Day 15, Thursday June 24 Woke up to a beautiful morning!! The air almost felt like fall and the sun streamed through the trees. The path was smooth at first but became riddled with rocks off and on throwing in huge paths of boulders throughout the day. At one point we went downhill to collect water at a spring and there were a couple of large historical markers! ???? The views today were amazing; several places we could stop and sit on top of huge boulders and look at the wide open farmland below dotted with beautiful homes and barns among the patchwork of well laid out fields. The sky was a perfect blue and clouds drifted lazily. You couldn’t have asked for anything prettier. Along the trail today we came across several very nice tent sites. Large rock fire rings were at all of them, many had logs set around to sit on. We went through fields of ferns again but one section had enormous ferns, they were just gorgeous!! At one spot where we crossed a road there were large areas filled with colorful wildflowers. We also found another historical marker in near perfect shape, commemorating a fort in 1755 created to be a post to watch for enemies in the French Indian war!!! How cool is that. We also came across a small box nailed to a tree near a spring. The box contained two cups and said it was a watering cup box. Very interesting and unexpected especially since the water in the spring needs to be filtered. At one point we crossed a service road for a pipeline. It was wide with grass between the tire tracks. What was crazy is it ran all the way down the mountain and the tire tracks were filled with fresh straw, it was a sight! Blade Runner’s foot had been doing well most of the day but near the end it was aching pretty bad and my calf was extremely sore on my left leg, probably from the very steep climbs yesterday. The trail threw in another load of rocks to clamber over the last mile into camp so it felt like two miles! We were ready to stop as we set our packs down at a beautiful tent site and got ready to set up camp. We had to walk downhill about .3 miles this collect water from a spring but it was such delicious water! My freeze dried Mexican meal tasted delicious as well. I’m not sure if that’s because it really was or I was just that hungry! I had chocolate pudding that the two of us shared after and I have to say, chocolate pudding made with water and eaten out of a ziplock is fantastic!!!
Day 16, Friday June 25 Today we hiked into Port Clinton where Blade Runner had parked her car two weeks ago and gotten a ride into Harpers Ferry to start her hike. Our hike wasn’t too bad for the first set of miles. At one point in the middle of the trail we came across the oddest thing, a geological survey marker, smack dab in the middle of the trail!! Near the end of the hike  we were once again bombarded with huge rocks and boulders. Thank you Pennsylvania!!!! The hike down into Port Clinton was spooky terrain, the steepness, sketchy steps made of rocks, even steeper grade and more rock steps. I dug my hiking poles in deep so I could lean into them to secure my footing and keep from sliding. Little pebbles came loose from the earth and scattered to the ground below reminding me to watch my step. At the bottom of the descent we crossed over railroad tracks and there was trail magic! Hotdogs, soda, chips and a few desserts to pick from. Once we were finished we found the parking lot where Blade Runner’s Jeep was and headed to Walmart so I could purchase something cheap to wear around town. Next, on to the Holiday Inn Express and were grateful to get a hot shower! My leg had swollen and had a red splotch spreading so my theory of a sprained calf muscle wasn’t valid. Blade Runner was kind enough to take me to Urgent Care. They were concerned I had a blood clot so sent me on to the ER.  Everyone in both places were so kind. They did some bloodwork and an simple ultrasound but the vascular assistant wasn’t available to do a full assessment as it’s a small, but new and very nice community hospital. I will get a call tomorrow to come in for a more thorough ultrasound . The great Irish Pub we wanted to eat at was closed by the time I got released so we ate catfish at the Cracker Barrel near the hotel. I must say, the cozy beds and fluffy pillows feel amazing!
Day 17, Saturday June 26
We woke up after 8 this morning in our super cozy beds. We headed downstairs and grabbed up the free breakfast and took it back to our room to eat. I had a 10:00 appointment at the hospital so we headed that way. Thankfully they were on time and I was out and cleared within 40 minutes!! No blood clot!!!! She was extremely nice and is not sure what caused the issue. She suspects it may be fluid leaking from a Baker’s cyst I have behind my knee. Nothing worrisome just aggravating. After leaving the hospital we headed to Cabala’s, the largest I’ve ever seen. I got a couple freeze dried dinners, a holder for my sunglasses and some cash. We then headed to Walmart for my resupply. To get a variety and not carry too much I will end up leaving a lot of it with Blade Runner, the least I could do after her driving me all over to the hospital and urgent care, not to mention all her trail help. After ‘chores’, we spent a wonderful day in Pottsville. This old town is amazing to walk around, filled with old buildings and unique homes, most in overall good repair considering how very old everything is. The town reminded me in some ways of Europe. Our first stop was the Yuengling Brewing Company, the nation’s oldest brewery. It was a great tour taking us deep into the cave that took them ten years to dig out of the mountain. There was even a portion of the brick wall left intact the government forced them to install during prohibition to curb production. The cave was very damp, all the stone walls glistening with moisture and water dribbling down from all sides. The family has always owned the business, each new generation purchasing it from the prior generation. The large St Patrick Catholic Church was the first building on the street, but the brewery was the second and literally sits one foot from the church. After our tour and free sampling we headed out for a fantastic late lunch/early dinner. I had a blueberry margarita, home made fries and delicious surf and turf nachos. Delicious!!!! We then walked the streets taking in all the old buildings and homes. There were houses each unique but actually sharing the side walls with the house next door. Large ornate churches are everywhere and and once in awhile we would hear the bells toll. I felt as if we were in a movie set. We climbed up a steep street to an ancient building, huge and castle-like. Up the stone steps we went to read and the large plaque talking about a hanging back in the day. Turns out this was an old jail. While we were admiring the massive door and stonework a voice came over a speaker asking if we needed something!!! Turns out this is still an active prison!!!! We continued our stroll around town admiring this little city from the past when we came to a war monument in the center of the street. We went over and read all the signs then settled on the base and just watched the city breathe for a bit. Pennsylvania appears to be a very patriotic state. So far, all the little towns we have passed through fly banners with past war hero’s from their light posts, flags are everywhere and statues and markers reminding us of history are in abundance. Tonight I did laundry, repacked my pack and am prepared to go back on the trail tomorrow afternoon. ","

WhichWay,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640287,"Day 18, Sunday June 27 Today was filled with an odd mixture of emotions. We woke up in our very cozy beds in the hotel and stayed put reading our books for a bit. When I got hungry I ventured downstairs for my grab bag breakfast and brought it back to bed. Finally I knew I needed to get moving. I took one last great shower and packed up my backpack. Blade Runner is letting me borrow her Earth Sack since she is leaving the trail. It’s a great food bag because it’s made from Kevlar so bears can’t rip it open, you tie it to a tree rather than bear bag hanging it. That’s a huge advantage because many times it’s difficult to find a suitable branch. I packed up my bear bag, a couple odds and ends I don’t need and a shirt I bought at the brewery for Blade Runner to send home for me. The new food bag was stuffed with all the food resupply I had picked up yesterday. I’m going to have to eat fast because it’s now really heavy!!! We headed into Port Clinton where we ate lunch at the historical Port Clinton Hotel. They usually have rooms for rent as well but due to Covid are only serving meals. And what delicious meals!! The portions are huge!! I saw hoagie buns go by with stuffing of some sort oozing out the sides and baskets of fries that could easily feed four or more. I had a delicious salad with a large, perfectly cooked crab cake just filled with fresh crab. I was excited to soon be on the trail again but also nervous and sad I’d be leaving Blade Runner behind. After eating we walked next door to the Peanut Shop, also an old business and a traditional hiker stop. The place was a candy store dream filled with homemade candies and manufactured old time favorites. Everywhere there were cases filled with chocolates and colorful candies of every sort. There were bins full of a variety of trail mixes and of course different types of fudge. And don’t forget peanuts. Salted, raw, roasted, you name it. There was an old fashioned peanut roaster working away in the front. As I was already overloaded with food I just bought a 1/4 pound of a yummy looking trail mix. Next Blade Runner drove me to the trailhead. I removed my flip flops, put on my hiking shoes, turned on the Garmin and bid a tearful goodbye to my new friend. I had dreaded the climb out of town as the descent into town a couple of days ago had been extremely steep, long and felt treacherous. The climb back out was steep but this time switchbacks were in place and helped immensely. The heat was the anchor today. I only hiked 6 miles because I started late but I am also giving my leg time to finish healing from whatever oddball thing happened to it. The trail was a mixture of rocks, but not tons, old fashioned wild roses scattered about, smooth terrain and ups and downs. I did cross a couple of smaller springs and stopped at a large one very close to the shelter I was going to stay at. After filtering water and filling all three bottles and my bladder, and having a full resupply of food it was a heavy pack I hoisted on my shoulders for the last walk into camp. It’s a hot night and the shelter somewhat squat and shallow so I opted to set my tent up hoping for more airflow. One other hiker joined me, a nice young man who actually did a thru hike of this trail ten years ago, his name is Lando. We enjoyed visiting while eating our dinner and finishing up camp chores. The privy here is fairly new but the oddest one I’ve seen so far. It is enclosed on three sides and open on one end. In a way it’s pretty cool, you have a gorgeous view while taking care of business and there is NO odor. I’m just glad camp isn’t full or it could create some awkward moments. I’m laying in my tent writing this up, the sky is growing dark, fireflies are playing among the grasses and animals are calling out to each other among the trees. What animals? I haven’t a clue!
Day 19, Monday June 28It was odd waking up this morning and looking out my tent to an empty campground, that was a first for me. Lando had already packed up sometime in the early hours. It was nice though! I packed up my gear and enjoyed a quiet breakfast. I headed back out to the trail and only about 50 feet in I hit my next milestone, 200 miles!!! So funny, I could have done that last night before heading down the trail to camp but I had it in my mind I still had a mile before reaching that mark. I made myself a little sign out of sticks and took a picture to celebrate. Today’s hike was really very nice with gradual climbs and overall good terrain. There was a great lookout at Pulpit Rock. I took my pack off and went to the rocks and admired all the beauty around me and the scenery dropping far below. I wasn’t brave enough to get close to the edge. I was able to FaceTime Bill knowing I can charge tonight at the shelter. It was great being able to really show him what was around me, pictures just don’t do it justice. There were a couple of places where boulders were once again thrown down in huge patches to make my way thru but not for long spells. There were several miles of trail that more resembled a narrow dirt road versus a skinny trail. Once again I spotted a geological survey marker stuck right in the middle of the trail! The trees growing over and around the trail helped shade me from direct sunlight but did nothing to take the edge of the intense humidity, I was soaked in sweat all day. At two different times a small unidentified snake slithered off the path in front of me. I only encountered one thru hiker but seven day hikers. I decided to keep my miles short again today due to the heat and stopped just short of ten miles at Eckville Shelter. It’s just off the road and is a little shelter behind a cute little caretaker house. There is a picnic table, water from a hose, a flush toilet and a solar shower. There is also power available to charge what you need to charge. Knowing I was going to stop here today I have been doing stuff on my phone more than usual. When I take off in the morning I’ll be fully charged once again. The care taker, Lazee , is a very nice older man who came out to greet me in flip flops and a pair of shorts. He brought me a huge glass of ice water and told me to hide it if more than two hikers showed up because he was out of ice!! He also brought me a flavored ice pop and it was way better than I ever remembered them tasting. I got my Garmin on the charger and settled at the picnic table to write my journal when two thru hikers showed up to shower and regroup before hitting the trail again. Lazee came out and caught them smoking and they decided to leave rather than take their smoking to the roadside. Two other hikers also stopped by to get cooled off before moving on a couple more miles to the tent site. I’ll sleep in the shelter instead of my tent because you can only tent across the street. It was nice relaxing in the breeze and watching the chipmunks play in the trees. Around 5 a couple of other hikers showed up and will stay. One is BadMoJo and the other HayMitch. One is kind of odd, the other more jolly and kind. Later Calves showed up. Each time a new hiker arrives Lazee steps out of his house with another ice pop and tosses it to the newly arrived. Calves, HayMitch and I had our supper and talked and visited at the table most of the evening, BadMoJo pretty much kept to himself. At one point Calves moved to the field across the way to set up his tent, BadMoJo followed with just his bug bivey once he saw a spider in the shelter!!! Lol!!!! He said if it starts to rain he will hightail it back to his bunk in the shelter. HayMitch spent the evening having me listen to the songs he wrote and recorded until the sky lost its light and the mosquitoes started to bite. It was overall a very pleasant evening. The only bad thing about this stopping place is the shelter itself. It has a very odd smell and there are actually termites moving around. 
Day 20, Tuesday June 29 This morning I was very glad I hadn’t moved to set my tent up across the road. When Calves went to take his tent down he was being eaten alive by bugs and came up the hill for bug spray; luckily HayMitch had some and he applied it generously so he could finish his task. After breakfast HayMitch and I took off together. We ended up hiking all day together. The initial climb out was the steepest and we anticipated a fairly easy day other than the heat and humidity. Turns out it was the hardest day ever!! The heat and humidity kept us soaked all day, water was not plentiful, and there were so very many rocks!! We had a nice view at one point when we were up on the ridge and nothing blocked the gorgeous view of the mountains and town laid out below. We actually saw two different spots where someone had lost shoes. The first place was a lone trail runner shoe sitting on the side of the road waiting to be claimed. The second incident was later in the day where a set of flip flops, likely someone’s camp shoes that had fallen off their pack and were hanging from a tree. A large black snake was laying across the trail at one point and took some convincing to move. Throughout the day several tiny chipmunks entertained us running throughout the undergrowth and up into the trees. We thought we had it made and then the last several miles were nothing but rocks, boulders and more rocks. Not only are they physically challenging but extremely challenging mentally. The worst and hardest was a huge ridge of rocks, The Knife’s Edge, extremely high up and long. It would have been much easier without a pack for sure. I just could not believe how gnarly it was and how large the boulders were, the size of semi truck cabs and there we were crawling over them. It was nice to have company through this hard day; he kept me entertained with songs and whistling, jokes and riddles. We were blessed with trail magic twice, the best kind for today. The first was a cache of water and soda. It appeared from the trash in the bag there were chips at one time. Later we came upon another ice chest with more water and Gatorade. The lady who supplied that was coming to pick up her cooler so we we’re able to thank her. We finally arrived exhausted at the shelter after 11 hours of hiking. The shelter area is a mess, trash left from weekend campers it appears, the picnic table was broken and decayed and huge weeds everywhere. It’s crazy how much difference there is between the shelters. Inside the small shelter itself was much cleaner than last night’s so that was a blessing. Available water is 1/2 mile down the trail so we both opted for dinners that dinners that didn’t need water, we were to tired to make the trek down the hill. I ate my dinner at the table and a very large tan bunny came out of the bushes to watch me almost the entire time. Backpacks hung and finally time to end this very long extremely hot day!!!
Day 21, Wednesday June 30 Woke up this morning and packed up. HayMitch left about 45 minutes ahead of me, he was hiking to a road crossing 7 miles away where he was being picked up and was going to have a zero in town. Before I could hit the trail I needed to hike down a side trail .6 miles in order to collect some water. Water is scarce the next few days so I filtered twice as much as usual making my pack a ton heavier! No option though with this terrible heat. The hike the first part of the day wasn’t too bad other than the ever draining muggy, heat wave taking its toll. Most of the path after the initial steep climb was without incident other than the constant rocks. However there were some great stretches with cushiony pine needles. How I love those sections, so easy to walk on and always accompanied with the delicious aroma of the forest. Around midday I stopped at a simple shelter to get some shade and cool off. Three other hikers stopped for the same reason, Red, RaceHorse and I don’t know the other. RaceHorse was in the best shape of all of us at the time because she was slack packing!!!  She said it was just too hot. If someone had offered to slack pack me today I would definitely had said yes before they finished asking! Next Sasha joined us. She is such a very nice person. I had met her the night before when she stopped by the shelter to get water. We found out she is doing a week long trip. We decided to finish out the last seven miles together. We ran across an interesting item along the trail close to a dirt road, a shoe scrapper!  We were able to get some more water right on the trail from a piped spring and thankfully it was there because they say no more reliable water for 20 miles. As we were heading down the trail two SOBOs were sitting trying to get cooled off and we visited for a bit. They advised us to take the Winter Trail coming up as it avoided the treacherous rock climb coming up especially as we were carrying extra water weight and it was so crazy hot. Thankfully we took their advice! We still had an incredibly long, steep climb to the top of our mountain but avoided the major rock climbs. At a couple of road crossings people had left jugs of water, best trail magic ever!!! We later found out from a fellow hiker staying at our tent site that even at over six feet tall he could barely do it and another girl was in tears and scared to death, only able to finish because her husband was there to pull her up. If I had known ahead I could have maybe arranged to be slack packed and pulled it off but I certainly don’t regret not attempting it under the circumstances. Our climb up took forever and along the way we were amazed at all the different landscapes. At one point the plants and rocks looked like we were in Arizona , another Kansas and yet another the rock resembled lava rock, so Hawaii. The views of the Palmerton below were stunning. We even saw the smelting plant that was so controversial in I believe the 90s and also featured in Bill Bryson’s book ‘A Walk in the Woods’. We met a trail Runner that lives in the area and he said twenty years ago this area was barren due to the mining but was then replanted. The situation explains why we are seeing such a diverse landscape. There were also tons of wild raspberries and black raspberries that we picked along the way. Blueberries were also available but not as many. Most of the berries weren’t ready yet but we found quite a few that were and really enjoyed the sweetness of every one we found. Shelby loves paper maps and carries one of the trail with her along with the Guthook app. I was lucky enough to bestow upon her the trail name, MapReader and she loved it!!!! Our tent site was just beautiful, clean with a bed of pine needles everywhere, pine trees and hundreds of ferns. One other camper was there. I set up my tent and MapReader her hammock. We finished dinner and chores just as the first raindrops fell. 
Day 22, Thursday July 1 We had a slight bit of rain over night but not bad. When we woke up the other person at our campsite was already packed up and gone. We tried to get packed up soon because rain was on the way. It didn’t start raining for a couple of hours but then it never stopped. A huge deal however, it wasn’t hot!!! I can’t tell you how happy we were!!!!! Even though water was scarce we had plenty for the circumstances and the trail itself was perfect. We stopped for a break and met up with Cubby. She’s super nice and got her trail name because early on in her hiking a bear was circling her tent near a shelter and everyone in the shelter scared the bear away. She said she moved into the shelter and people took turns doing bear watch throughout the night. Everyone teased her that the bear thought she was her cub!!!! And after her break Cubby moved on but Calves showed up and visited for awhile before moving on. Orange newts were out today along with frogs. It was such a great day to hike despite the rain. Once we got to the shelter there were already a few there taking shelter from the rain but not all staying. Once there was a break in the rain I took my filter down the hill .6 miles to fill up with fresh, delicious spring water. In the end six of us stayed at the shelter, MapReader, Tortoise, Hare, Red, RaceHorse and myself. It was like a slumber party, we just hung out and visited and fixed our food. As Looseleaf headed down the trail to find a hammock sight, he bestowed on MapReader and myself a packet of Hazelnut coffee each!!! Dessert tonight! Overall a great but wet day!
Day 23, Friday July 2I slept one of the best nights so far with rain pounding away all night on the shelter roof. It felt good to finally wake up refreshed. Everyone was taking care of morning chores and packing up in our cramped space but no one seemed to care. MapReader and I were the last ones to leave the shelter. It was pretty hard putting yesterday’s clothes back on, they were wet and cold! MapReader’s shoes were shot. Yesterday the front half of the sole on both feet had come completely loose and she ‘fixed’ them by running a piece of duct tape from under the front of the foot and over her toe. Next she took a piece of string around the duct tape and tied it to the tongue of her shoe. It worked until a couple miles from camp then the poor things said ‘enough!’ And she had to trade her tired boots for her camp shoes. She ended up tying the worn warriors to the back of her pack. It was a perfect day for hiking, not too hot thankfully so we didn’t have to carry a ton of extra water. The terrain started out really nice, rocks but not horrendous and only one steep climb the entire day!! We ran across one day hiker and a couple who were doing a four day backpacking trip. It’s amazing how great the day hikers smell!! Lots of frogs were hopping around along with little orange newts and slugs. I also saw several beautiful red mushrooms and one really pretty set of lemon yellow ones! There were actually three geographical markers on the trail today. We went through one long stretch where there were tons and tons of blueberry bushes but sadly only a handful were ripe. The ripe ones were sweet and delicious even though they are just tiny, smaller than a BB. The first look out we stopped at was at the top of a pile of rocks that cascaded down the mountain. The view was breathtaking and looked over the city of Wind Gap. We enjoyed a few snacks and just getting off our feet for awhile. Once we were up and hiking again we walked down the mountain and crossed the road before Wind Gap. In a small parking space just before heading back up the trail was parked a mini van where a scraggly haired older man was passing out bottles of water and bars. His trail name is Moose and he hiked the trail in the late 70s. He was full of stories, a bit lonely I think, and told us he has backpacked all over the world. His main job most of his life was as a balloon handler for Macy’s. I would have liked to ask more questions about that but was afraid I would never be able to get back on trail!!! Moose also was kind enough to take MapReader’s shoes off her a hands and throw them away for her. Our first steps back on trail and out of the city were up several very steep stone steps. This was where our one and only climb of the day was so you can imagine how surprised we were when we came upon a backpacker right off the trail, laying on the start of the climb, tarp pulled over himself, contents of his pack strewn here and there and his sleeping hammock half hanging from a tree, the rest draped across the ground. His coloring was good and from a couple of empty bottles laying around it appears he was sleeping off a previous good time. What a spot to pick to do that! After our big climb it was smooth sailing most of the afternoon. The trail varied between rocky, rockier and suddenly a carpet made of pine needles. I just can’t get over how quickly it changes. Our next big spot was Wolf Rocks which are HUGE boulders we had to climb up and over and around. We picked a spot to rest for a bit and enjoy the view. It was amazing but we noticed the clouds seemed to be darkening and I suggested we get started on our last few miles. The next couple of miles took us over nothing but rocks both very big requiring careful maneuvering and smaller ones. The day was so nice we had finally dried out, but, all at once without much warning, 1.5 miles from camp the sky literally opened up and poured down buckets and buckets of water, we were drenched in no time. We barely had time to tuck away our phones and cover our packs. The trail was running like a river and we were like two little kids splashing through every puddle. We did see a tiny deer running through the woods as fast as it could trying to escape the orange and red ponchos flying it’s way. By the time we reached the Kirkridge shelter there wasn’t a dry spot on us. The only other person here was Stickman. We changed into dry clothes and hung everything up to hopefully get somewhat dry for tomorrow. Once the rain stopped Stickman went and set up his tent so MapReader and I had the shelter to ourselves. We set up our sleeping bags, cooked dinner, shared some pudding and relaxed in our bed while writing in our journals. This is MapReader’s last night on the trail and I think she enjoyed our little shelter party inside warm and dry with our open front view of the beautiful outdoors. 
Day 24, Saturday July 3MapReader and I woke up in the shelter to a cool morning with no rain!! We knew we had a short day so took our time getting packed up and eating breakfast. Water retrieval was so easy, a simple faucet a short walk up the hill and back. Also slowing us down was knowing we had wet, cold clothes to put on along with wet, soggy socks and shoes. We also left our pack covers on to hopefully dry out. The trail was overall nice. There were rocks of course, after all it is still Pennsylvania, but nothing unmanageable. Of course it could just be I’m getting used to them. We went to an outlook overlooking Delaware Water Gap and met a group of four people who were from New York doing a day hike in preparation for hiking at Glacier National Park. The man, Doctor Nintin Ron was perhaps from Tibet. He is a doctor that heals babies both premature and does intense surgeries on babies still in the womb. He also held secret clinics in Tibet when it was locked down and under military rule. It was a fabulous conversation with a group of positive, joyful people. We continued down the trail, each step closer to town meeting several day hikers going both directions. The trail at one point was full of huge rhododendron plants; they were gorgeous and filled with small pink buds that opened up into full white blossoms tinged in pink. The drop into town was steep but not too gnarly. Stone steps and switchbacks made it much easier. We entered the city and easily found the Church of the Mountain hostel where we were staying. Trail magic happened right away. A shuttle pulled in and when I spoke to the driver he is happy to take me to Walmart in the morning for my resupply!! And for no charge, he just does it for people. Also, I need shoes 1/2 size larger and Calves just went through the process of finding some in town and had the name and number of a store carrying my brand and they deliver!!! One quick phone call and new shoes we’re heading to the hostel!!! It is an interesting hostel as you walk in the main floor where the hostel is located and if you went up the stairs that is where the church is held. There are several bunks but those were already spoken for so MapReader and I staked claim to a couple of spots on the floor. We showered and washed our clothes in a bucket of soap and hung them on a rack to dry. Starving we walked to a farmers market/deli and got a variety of foods to fill our bellies. It started to rain again but thankfully we were on a patio under cover. Next thing we knew, the four we met on the overlook were coming in for a bite to eat and joined us at the table. We really enjoyed their company as they told us stories about their travels and peppered us with trail questions. After returning to the hostel we took three others with us and went to get ice cream. The evening was spent relaxing and updating my journal. MapReader moved a couple of things around so we had floor space to sleep.","

WhichWay,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640569,"Day 25, Sunday July 4I can’t believe it’s the Fourth of July and I’m in Delaware Water Gap! I had every intention of getting up this morning and calling the shuttle to take me to Walmart for a resupply and then hitting the trail but the day took a different turn and I’m glad. Being a holiday it was hard to just leave town so I decided to stay for the day. MapReader, RaceHorse and myself went to the ice cream store where they also serve up a delicious breakfast amid their old fashioned decor complete with music you would expect amid cute cafe tables and ice cream parlor ambiance. After a leisurely time in town, we walked back and called the free shuttle service to Walmart. The guy, Gary, is super nice and came about 45 minutes later and took us in to the nearby town. Delaware Water Gap is a town of only about 650 people and doesn’t even have a grocery store. There were a couple of other hikers able to take advantage of the ride too. We took our time getting supplies and a few snacks for the outdoor concert we heard would be happening tonight!  MapReader’s friend drove in to take MapReader home later today and he brought us back from Walmart. We took a walk down to the bridge to see the River then RaceHorse met us for some ice cream. The three of them went floating for awhile and I went to get postcards and a fruit and yogurt parfait from the ice cream store to eat for breakfast. The guy working there, Brody is so sweet and wouldn’t allow me to pay for it. I came back to the hostel to fill out a couple of postcards to send to kids and think about dinner. I ended up grabbing some delicious wings and fries to go, headed back to the hostel just in time for MapReader, RaceHorse and Thomas to get back. We grabbed up Red and Looseleaf and walked to the pavilion for the 6:00 concert. It was so much fun laying there on the grass listening to live music and eating all kinds of junk food!!it was sad when MapReader had to leave. She took home as a souvenir the walking stick she had found in the woods and named Just in Time! She also named my sticks, This away and That away. She also left me her fabulous very light ballon like light!! The rest of the evening was spent visiting and hanging out in the hostel, tomorrow, back on the trail!
Day 26, Monday July 5 I slept in the bunk room last night and it was so dark and quiet I slept one of my best nights in awhile. When I woke up I thought it must be around six but it was actually 7:30!!! Everyone around the hostel was moving slow, leftover mood from the great holiday yesterday. I took another shower, ate the delicious berry, granola and yogurt parfait Brody gifted me yesterday then packed up my food bag and backpack and put my brand new shoes on my feet. Never have new shoes felt so great!! As I hiked out of town I crossed the river via a very long bridge, the highway traffic flying by on my left. The view of the Delaware River was gorgeous. Huge trees grew along the bank shading the people floating around in colorful rafts and a small fishing boat floating by made the scene look like a holiday. A great surprise was the words painted on the concrete halfway across the bridge declaring I had stepped into New Jersey!!! The early part of my hike took me through a park area where a met a father and son doing a day hike in this area to finish off this section of the AT. We enjoyed chatting until I reached the end of the park and continued on to the trail. The weather was perfect with lower humidity and great breezes. There was a steep climb in the beginning but it was over a long distance and a smooth trail without rocks. At one point I ran into RaceHorse and Red sitting on a rock at the edge of a beautiful glacier pond, Sunfish Pond. Apparently it’s one of the Seven Wonders of New Jersey; who ever knew there were Seven Wonders of New Jersey?  I sat and visited with them for quite awhile when two day hikers stopped by. This was their first hike ever and they were really enjoying it. I headed back out and sadly the rocks reappeared. I ran into two more day hikers and visited with them for awhile. It’s so much fun to visit with all these people from all over, they are all curious to find out more about what I’m doing and always offer information about themselves. It wasn’t long or surprising before RaceHorse and Red caught up with me but it was surprising when they told me they had something for me. Turns out the couple I talked to had stopped them and asked if they would give a Cliff Bar to me. I am always amazed and filled with gratitude at the kindness I have received from so many strangers. The whole day was slow knowing I was only going about ten miles but it was filled with overlooks of the Delaware River, blueberry and raspberry picking, and enjoying the passage of many day hikers including a whole passel of what appeared to be summer campers hiking along the ridge line. Red, RaceHorse and myself all stayed at the Appalachian Mountain Center. It’s a nice getaway in the woods where you can rent a cabin or tent. There is a lodge, the front a store and deli and the back half a lounge area with showers, tables and couches. After hours the back half is left open all night. I got a quiet tent site and after setting up came back to the lounge to shower and the three of us hung out for the evening on the cozy couches just journaling and relaxing. 
Day 27, Tuesday July 6Woke up in my nice tucked away campsite ready to pack up and be at the Appalachian Outdoor Center lounge by 7:30. I knew they opened for breakfast at 8:30 but I wanted to have my water bottles filled and ready to go. Also, I had accidentally left my bag of charging cords there the night before and was anxious to retrieve them. I couldn’t find them at first and was beginning to panic but one of the other hikers found them tucked in behind a couch cushion. I ordered breakfast right after 8 but the kids working the kitchen were a bit slow and didn’t get our meals to us until almost 9! I had breakfast with RaceHorse, Red, Barely, Bull and Looseleaf. I ended up not getting out of there until just about ten. I had thought when leaving Pennsylvania there would be a magic line drawn in the sand as you enter into New Jersey with instantly no rocks; no rocks for a while but since half day yesterday we are back to rocks. Some say in about 20 miles ahead they stop, time will tell. Beautiful views were available this morning but were blurred with haze due to the high humidity, it’s another hot one and miles will be slow. About three miles in I ran into Epiphany, he told me that he spotted a bear near his tent site last night. I guess they are pretty prevalent in this area. Today I reached my first fire tower and climbed to the top and enjoyed the view from my lofty perch but loved the breeze even more as it washed over my sweat soaked skin. The trail in places was lined in gobs of rhododendrons in all stages of blooming, a few wild roses and lots more berries. I didn’t take the time to eat many of them because the ripe treasures were few and I wanted to get some miles under my feet today. Today there were actually some dirt and paved roads which goes quickly but they place you out in the hot sun versus the shade a canopy of trees provides. I find it fascinating that along the trail once in a great while there are a few very bright orange leaves laying on the ground, fresh and new as if fall is just beginning, but when you look through the trees you never see one dangling from a branch. I have found that I am no longer a two legged creature but have become a four legged human with This away and That away now as much a part of me as the limbs I was born with. Click clack is their language as they speak to me with every step; creak, creak is the voice my pack now speaks as we travel together down the trail. I find comfort in hearing their voices as a constant in my day! As I travel along LooseLeaf walks ahead of me, then later I find him catching back up and passing me again after he stepped off trail for a break. MudAngel also shows up and another hiker I just met, SkyWalker. We were all pretty close together when we rounded a curve to one of my favorite things, trail magic!!! It always seems to show up right when you need it most. Thirsty and hungrier than I realized I almost cried out of pure joy for the wonder of it. I always get emotional not just because of what they are offering, but because it fills me with such joy to think people I have never met just want to provide such an amazing gift. And they provided so much, several drinks, chicken and tuna packets, cheese, fruit, candy, crackers, cookies and more items I can’t remember. It was heaven to relax in the shade and eat and drink. We all took of shortly after that but MudAngel was having a hard day with the heat and his toes were hurting so he set up his camp shortly after. I hiked on alone on a pretty easy path and was feeling pretty confident in my aloneness when suddenly I was faced with a wall of boulders to scramble up and over and no white blazes to follow. I continually looked behind me as the southbound blazes were more evident. It wasn’t long after completing the boulder obstacle course that I came up on SkyWalker and as we were doing about the same pace with continued hiking together. About 2 1/2 miles from the shelter we were headed to the thunder had started. He decided to stay in a clearing where a few others were camped; I was going to put on my poncho and try to hike further and beat the rain but once the thunder split the sky open with a tremendous crash I knew I better throw up my tent too. I put up my tent but not in time, no time to stake out the sides to keep the rain fly off the sides of the inner tent. I threw my pack and myself inside. My water bottle lid fell off and the whole bottle emptied. I bailed and sopped it up throwing the water out the door. In the meantime the quick rainstorm created a fast river that ran under my tent so fast and hard I was sitting on a bubble of water that quickly seeped through the tent floor. It finally stopped raining but the floor will be wet all night despite my heroic efforts to dry it out so I’ll sleep on my pad with my sleeping bag liner but can’t pull out my sleeping bag for fear of it getting soaked and it being able to dry it out. Hopefully I can dry it all out tomorrow! Ugh!!!! I feel as if I am turning into a feral cat. As I sat on my small sit pad among the soggy wet, muddy floor I dropped a raisin into the mess from the snack dinner I was eating. I quickly snatched it up and popped it into my mouth without even thinking! Last night at the Mohican Center I pulled the delicious chocolate bar I’d been gifted from MapReader and sadly it was a liquid mess. That didn’t stop me though, I drank it from the wrapper then promptly licked my fingers and wrapper!
Day 28, Wednesday July 7 I woke up to no rain but water and mud everywhere. I packed up my backpack inside my tent and ate a simple bar. My tent is an absolute muddy mess due to the river that ran between my tent floor and ground cloth.  Number one goal today is to get to the shelter 15 miles away before tonight’s storm. I’m headed to a hostel tomorrow where hopefully I can clean up and dry my tent and the assorted bags. The climb out of the campsite was long and full of tons of rocks. I was so grateful I didn’t attempt that hike last night during the storm. Talking to a few day hikers today turns out it was a big storm that downed trees in town and created power outages. There were a lot of ripe blueberries today but I didn’t take time to munch on very many as they can really take a lot of time to pick through and with there being a heat advisory and unknown terrain ahead I wanted to focus more on hiking to reach my 15 mile goal before the big storm coming yet again tonight. I just didn’t want to set up muddy mess my tent. This Way and That Way were extremely helpful appendages as I made my way over wet rocks and hills to what would have been far easier if it had been 15 degrees cooler. The rocks are still plentiful but there are also stretches of pine needle covered forest floor. I ran into MudAngel again and he is suffering terribly due to the new boots he bought recently that are tearing up his feet. I felt so bad for him, he’s looking for a place to stay a few days and heal and get a different type of shoe. I ran into more trail magic as well! Moose is providing trail magic everyday from July 1-22 and has been doing this for several years. He even had a nice freezer powered by a huge battery fill with ice cream bars. Aside from food items he had spare batteries and wipes and even food items you could take for meals in case you needed something before you could resupply. There were at least eight chairs you could sit in and rest your feet and a porta-potty close by. Moose got his name because one year he was hiking somewhere up north and he was watching the ground and bumped right into a moose! The moose wasn’t happy until Moose threw his jacket over the eyes of the moose which calmed him down. A minute later the moose shook off the jacket and went back to munching grass. Hiking along near the end of the day I topped the mountain and at the summit was a huge stone pavilion with several teenage hikers laying on the floor enjoying some snacks. Turns out they are a group called Outward Bound. These kids are taken on a 14 day trip, half backpacking and half canoeing. What a great time for kids to experience. There was also a lady and her husband who were on a day hike and headed to the parking lot .2 miles ahead. They said they would love to give me water if I needed some. I followed them down and in the parking lot was more trail magic! She didn’t have much left but i was able to get a cold drink and the lady from the pavilion filled my water bottle from a five gallon jug she had in her van as he trail magic lady didn’t have plain water. I also got to see LooseLeaf, Bull and Barely who were there at the magic. I have not had to filter water once today! I knew I still had almost three miles to go so I moved as quick as the heat and my legs would allow so I could beat this storm that everyone talked about all day. Finally, there it was in a clearing, a cool OLD shelter with a picnic table. There is a bear box and in it someone had brought 20 gallons of water. In a the clearing behind the main area were several tents set up. Turns out this was a different group of kids also from Outward Bound. I sat outside at the picnic table fixing dinner and writing on my journal until well after 8 with no sign of a storm. What the heck??? 
Day 29 , Thursday July 8Last night after settling in the shelter, deep inside my bag liner to hide from the skeeters, after the light had almost left the sky, another group of hikers came in. It was a group of young guys, in their early twenties. As far as I knew at that point we hey had all set up their tents. Imagine my surprise when I woke up to snoring in the shelter sometime in the middle of the night. I guess two others showed up even later and just settled into the shelter instead of setting up tents so late. I didn’t plan on leaving early because I only had five miles to hike where Mosey was picking me up at the High Point State Park HQ building. I enjoyed watching and listening to the group of young men talking and joking while dragging all their stoner paraphernalia out onto the picnic table. It was quite entertaining! Then as I was about ready to leave one of them mentioned the storm window had moved up so I hit the road fast. I hiked as quickly as I could with my pack cover on, covering ground quickly for the first 2 1/2-3 miles before the rain started. It wasn’t too bad at first but I had plenty of steep downhills and many slick rocks and boulders to cross slowing me up greatly. At about the last mile SkyWalker came up behind me also headed to where I was and letting me know this was soon going north to turn into a thunder storm. The trail went right to the park center where we were being picked up and inside the center were at least a dozen other hikers all trying to dry out and warm up. The center had a few snacks and drinks for sale and I promptly wolfed down a root beer, Milky Way and a bag of chips. Yes all of you who know this is not my normal diet, it is now! I can’t believe the amount of junk food calories this body has devoured. Mosey came and got SkyWalker and myself and stopped by both McDonald’s and Dairy Queen for us, (yes, more junk food). She took us to her home which she has turned into a hostel. It’s a great setup. For $35.00 you get a bunk in the six bunk room, a shower, she picks you up, drops you back off after your stay, washer and dryer use, and runs you somewhere for dinner and resupply if needed. I spent time cleaning up my muddy tent and hanging it to dry, took a shower and did laundry. Also to my delight, HayMitch, BassMan, HillBilly and Moonshine were coming here. MoonShine was recovering from what she suspects was Lyme disease after getting antibiotics a couple of days ago and we all played a dice game before heading to the grocery store so a couple of the hikers could resupply. I still have plenty of food so I only grabbed a couple of bars. Then we went to get dinner and bring it back to the hostel to eat. I got a gluten free pizza and salad. The rest of the evening was spent getting gear together to leave in the morning. We need to be on the road by 7:30 as Mosey has to get back and get ready for a funeral","

WhichWay,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640980,"Day 30, Friday July 9 Woke up this morning around six with everyone else also starting to stir. Mosey needed us in the van by 7:30 because she had a funeral to go to so I  packed up my now clean tent and dressed in my fresh clean clothes. Mosey made us all scrambled eggs, bacon and potatoes, all included with our $35.00 hostel fee. It was pouring rain but the weather app said it would stop around 9 or 10 and she dropped us all off at the park center where she had picked us up the day before. We were able to stay inside the building until the rain let up, they were so nice in there. They put on a pot of coffee for all of us at no charge and helped me mail a package home which included my blow up pillow because I found out my clothing bag works better for me as a pillow . Once the rain stopped I headed out with Moonshine and HillBilly; they are about my age and just great to hang out with. Moonshine is recovering from Lyme disease, she was in bed for three days after getting medicine for it. She’s feeling much better but weak and tired. There was a storm predicted for this afternoon and we all wanted to see the ‘secret’ shelter so we decided to hike the 7 miles and stay at the shelter. It was a great day for hiking and I enjoyed it so much. The weather was perfect and the terrain not too difficult at all. In fact after awhile the rocks started to disappear. After a short distance we came across a really nice observation deck and climbed to the top to see everywhere around. The clouds were low and in the distance we could see the High Point Monument fading in and out as the clouds moved over and around it. The monument marks the highest point in New Jersey. Later we ran into a really nice trail runner who filled us in on all kinds of information about what’s coming up on the trail. Later during our hike we came upon two deer laying in the woods who were only curious about us, never seemed to care or get up from their nap. Plenty of streams were crossed which was a bit ironic considering the lack of water on all our blistering hot days and here it was cooler and wet here was plentiful water. We didn’t get In much of a hurry knowing it was a low mileage day and took several breaks. We saw a couple of adorable bunnies, a few orange newts, playful chipmunks and a zillion mosquitoes. We made our way up to the ‘secret’ shelter and were pleasantly surprised by the clearing we walked into with two very tiny cabins and one extremely friendly and famous donkey, Jake. He came right up to greet us wanting all kinds of neck scratches and probably hoping for the apple we sadly didn’t have. After we claimed our places on the floor we went to relax on the porch and scratch Jake’s neck. Then, Hillbilly lit up a joint and Jake was all over it, he wanted that smoke!!! Hillbilly blew some in his face and he couldn’t get enough, he would stomp his feet when Hillbilly stopped blowing smoke. Eventually he was happy and strolled away, a stoner donkey!!!! We sat on the porch and ate and visited while a few other hikers showed up to camp. Some will tent and a couple others might join us inside. The rain never came!
Day 31, Saturday July 10Woke up this morning to one extra in the shelter who wasn’t there when the three of us went to sleep last night, a mist outside and Jake standing front hooves on the porch watching the hiker who slept on the porch cook her breakfast. it was a beautiful morning but sadly Moonshine wasn’t feeling any better and her head was pounding. She made the painful decision to go home for a week or two until she can get this Lyme disease under control and feel better. She feels weak like a kitten and carrying a pack and hiking does not appeal to her right now at all. We decided to hike into town which was a little over 2 miles and grab something to eat. They would then try to make arrangements for her brother to pick her up and I would hike on to the shelter another 5 miles away. The trail today was perfect! The forest is less dense and thankfully due to the lack of rocks and roots I was able to look throughout the forest as we hiked and This away and That Way clicked and clacked alongside me knowing they weren’t going to have to be as mindful at the moment. With the forest being more open I was hoping to spot my first bear but that wasn’t to be today. We did spot a beautiful doe running through the woods and miraculously jumping over so many bushes and high boulders without touching any of them, she was a gorgeous site! We also spotted a groundhog and two huge fat turkeys in the bushes! The path also contained several places where there had been boards placed over the swampy areas but because of all the moisture in the air this morning they were slimy and treacherous if you didn’t watch your footing. We got to the small town of Unionville, New York and walked .7 miles through this cute little town filled with wonderful historic homes. Just before we got to the deli, a man who was mowing his yard stopped mowing just to let us know hikers are welcome to tent in the park and not to worry about leaving things there if they wanted to go get something to eat, he said this town was virtually free of any incidences. The deli was great and I ordered some eggs and bacon and hash-browns, I finished it off with a yummy vitamin drink and of course an ice cream bar! After using the out house at the park I was walking back to the deli when a mini van slowed down in the middle of the street and hollered out,’Hello WhichWay!’. It was Mosey and SkyWalker!!! I got to the deli and after filling my water bottles from the spigot at the back of the deli I gave hugs to Moonshine and Hillbilly and got ready to leave. RaceHorse and Red had just gotten out of a pizza place there in town and were sitting at the porch at the deli charging their phones and asked me to save them a spot in the shelter. The hike from the deli into the shelter was quite interesting. I first went through some regular street roads and just before the trail entered the preservation area there was the cutest homemade sign with a stick figure girl with actual stick legs standing on the ground advertising trail magic. Two cute small blue benches were on either side of a cooler filled with cold drinks; an old historic farmhouse in the background and oldies music playing from the neighbors yard completed the Norman Rockwell picture. Even though my belly was still full from town food who could resist sitting on those cute benches and having a cold drink while listening to some great music? To top it off the tree sported a sign with two turtles saying turtle crossing! Shortly after I ran into what appeared to be a small tent/tepee type structure leaning against a large rock. Obviously man or child made and close to a road. I wonder who might have created such a fun hideaway and thought if a sudden rain came it would be a great place to throw a tarp or poncho over the carefully placed sticks and twigs and hide underneath until the storm passed. From there my journey took me on a path around a preservation area for wildlife and birds. This was the easiest path I’ve hiked in a long time. As I left the area I the trail went back into the woods and was still a wonderful needle filled soft path; however, 1 mile from the shelter, the path suddenly became a steep incline and I could very quickly feel the thick humidity in the air as my shirt became soaked. Thankfully the incline eventually turned into switchbacks which helped to some degree; however, the steepness of the hill was still there. 1/4 of a mile from the shelter there was a side trail that I took to an abandoned house where I could get more water from a spigot at the back of the house. A spigot is always a treasure as you don’t have to filter. I arrived at the shelter shortly after after and loved the space. The shelter is older and a bit short and squat but in good repair. A couple benches had been fashioned from logs and there was a great picnic table. The forest was filled with tall trees and wildflowers along the edges. There was a decent privacy and a bear box. I enjoyed making myself a great cup of coffee to drink with my snickers bar. RaceHorse and Red showed up later and offered me the opportunity to share their ride into the drive in theater tomorrow from a spot down the trail, I’m so excited!!! A few more hikers showed up, two new to me, Mahjong and Kayla. We had an nice evening just visiting at the picnic table. Overall another great day!  The last couple of days in addition to tomorrow are definitely lower mileage days. I was getting a little anxious about getting slack for a moment but reminded myself this journey is not about setting records for how fast I can go. This journey is for many reasons and one of them is to experience all the iconic places along the trail and to take time for the views and visiting with people from all over. This section of trail happens to be an area with several things such as the Secret Shelter and Drive in Movie theater where you can tent for free. Each of these things are close together so low mileage!! I don’t want to miss anything!!
Day 32, Sunday July 11Red and RaceHorse slept in the same shelter as I did last night and when they woke up before six I got up as well. My intent was to get on the road before them since they hike faster than me and I didn’t want to hold them up. Red garnered a ride down the trail for them to get to the drive-in movie theater today and they invited me to join them! They are so very nice. The hike was incredible today and I made fabulous time. There were several ups and downs but nothing too severe, either that or I am getting stronger, probably a combination of both. There were lots and lots of those wood boards placed over the marshy swampy spots but they weren’t as slimy as yesterday so I could move forward with more confidence. I had a wonderful surprise when I ran into the most beautiful boardwalk; unlike the boards that were simply placed on a few logs to keep us above the marshes, this was more like a beautiful boardwalk placed along a beach and it went on and on and on around some type of preservation area where there were benches set up along some spots so people could do some birdwatching. The boardwalk then took me to an elaborate platform bridge that went over a small stream and back again to more boardwalk. This Way and That Way were heavily relieved when I got to carry them for the duration and they could rest because normally they are on constant watchful duty to save my face from the rocks. In my path was a little ladder that climbed over the fence and into a pasture. There was a sign asking hikers to please not approach the cows but that wasn’t a problem today as there was not one cow in sight!! At one point I ran across a hiker who was coming from the north and heading south. He informed me about a wonderful little farm just a block up the road ahead where they had fresh fruit and cold drinks, he said it would be a great stop. The SOBO hiker also told me in the mountains ahead I had a big chance of seeing a bear because the woods were full of them. I am excited and nervous! So far the majority of hikers seeing them have not had an opportunity to take a picture of their bear sightings, we will see if I do or if I have the nerve to take out my phone for a picture before getting out of the way. The  timing of running into SOBO hiker was perfect because I wouldn’t have known about the farm if he hadn’t told me and I would’ve crossed the road and started up the steep incline thinking Red and RaceHorse were meeting me further down the trail. Once I got to Heaven Hill Farm there was a place for me to plug in my phone and charge while I munched on an apple and some cheese outside at a little table where I could watch other hikers come in. In the meantime I had turned my phone back on to see if Red and RaceHorse had an update as to where we were supposed to meet and as fortuitous as it was this was the exact spot that the person was going to pick us up at! The trail does provide as they say; if I had not talked to that hiker I would’ve crossed the street and gone past the pick up spot which would’ve been horrible because that would’ve meant I had climbed the mountain that is coming and supposed to be extremely steep as I will find out tomorrow, and had to come back down. I had a great two hours or so just charging, working on my journal and watching people come and go. RaceHorse and Red showed up and RaceHorse treated me to a delicious ice cream, blueberry cream with whipped cream! TimeOut was our trail Angel and he arrived to take us and Wood to the grocery store. I just bought a couple of items as my food bag is currently sufficiently full. We all piled into his car again and headed to the outdoor movie theater. Pulling in it felt like we had gone through a time warp, so crazy and cool! There are three screens, each will show a different movie, an old fashioned snack bar and little ticket booth. There is a grassy knoll above the height of where the cars will be where backpackers can set up their tents and watch the movie for free before staying the night. I’m so happy I get to be part of this cool experience. We set up our tents and hung around visiting before walking into town for food. We were originally going to go to Mexican but a local said it wasn’t good at all so back to the grocery store and the deli section. It was so fun. We all picked out food for our meal and some drinks, took them outside the grocery store and sat in white plastic chairs they had for sale!!! I can’t even imagine doing that in my real life which made it even more fun!!! We were the very definition of smelly hiker trash!!! The food I eat out here is so crazy, I can’t believe what I put in my stomach. So much junk food and large amounts of everything. I’ve had more ice cream in the last month than I usually eat in a year. And I don’t even want to think about all the items containing sugar. I now love sour patch kids and gushers. It’ll be interesting to see how quickly I wean myself when I get back home. We headed back to the drive in and sat on the grass hanging out, eating more junk, waiting for the movie to start at 9:00.  In our absence more hikers had rolled in and still more kept coming. I was surprised to see how late they kept coming. They were letting us hikers use three radios for free, others would have to pay but I have no idea how much. We were lucky, our little group scored two radios!!! Then later we ended up with another, depending on who was handling them out the number kept changing. Sitting on the grass watching the cars come in, people walking around with hotdogs, the aroma of popcorn in the air brought back wonderful memories of childhood trips to the drive in movies with giant chocolate bars and the playground in our jammies. Those were such simple days; tonight is so simple as well. Good friends sitting on their sit pads, popcorn and soda, our ‘houses’ simple behind us, radios at our feet watching a summer movie together. Life should always be this simple and pure. 
Day 33, Monday July 12What a day!! It rained during the night so when I got up at 6 I had a wet tent to pack up. RaceHorse, Red and myself were being picked up at 6:45 to be taken back to the place we stopped yesterday. Our shuttle driver dropped us right at the base of what is named, The Stairway to Heaven. This is a steep incline that goes on and on for quite a ways, a large part of this path was made of different size boulders forming the steps. RaceHorse and Red walked back to the farm to use the bathroom but I went on ahead knowing I take longer and they may or may not catch up. The Stairway to Heaven was steep and made somewhat more difficult due to the stones being wet but overall it wasn’t as bad as I thought it was going to be! After that the terrain was pretty decent for several miles and I was able to make good time. I even scared a buck and his massive body and gorgeous rack flew across the forest. I sat down around noon to have a bite to eat and rest my back a minute. I was being careful with my water because I was getting a little short and knew the next water source was a beaver pond that I really didn’t want to use!! But honestly the day was not to hot and so far the trail was being good to me. I was soaked with sweat but it was more due to the humidity and rain forest type setting of the day. After my lunch though things began to change. The terrain was more up and down and the rocks increased and increased. Before I knew it I was on a rocky ridge that would not stop for miles. Not only was it a rocky ridge but the boulders had to be traversed using my hands to pull me up and over while This away and That away hung useless from my wrists. The rocks were slick in some areas and I had to use extreme caution. I did slip once on a rock slab shaped like a slide and landed hard on my butt making it even flatter than it usually is! It was very challenging, it’s hard to even come up with the words to create the right image in someone’s mind. Straight up and downs where you have to search for toe holds and places to grab and yank yourself up. In some spots I sat on my butt and scooted down. In one place there was a rebar ladder embedded within the rocks; the trick here was to keep yourself tucked in tight so you don’t fall backwards from the weight of your pack. I was getting so tired with still a couple of miles to go, very low on water and thunder rumbling in the distance. The boulders had subsided about a mile or so back and I had just turned down yet another water source where the water was the color of tea and I was getting thirsty. So here I am, tired, thirsty, soaking wet from sweat and beating off mosquitoes and in a hurry to beat the rain when all of a sudden there are more boulder scrambles ahead, I couldn’t believe it!! I did find the ones I did fun and challenging albeit scary, but now I just wanted to get to the shelter and these slowed you down. I had no choice though and finished up and drug myself to the shelter. The ‘stream’ before the shelter was not much more than a standing puddle of water so I didn’t waste time on it knowing water was a short distance away at the shelter. It wasn’t but a few minutes after arriving that the clouds opened up and it started the storm. I was so thirsty but didn’t want to walk down the hill during the rain so I took out my umbrella, turned it upside down and let it collect water for me, I felt very clever!!! It almost filled a liter bottle which helped at the moment but once the storm abated I did venture down the path to get more water from the very tiny creek. While cooking up dinner, me and a new hiker I just met, RainMan, we’re getting eaten alive by mosquitoes. We vowed to put up our tents inside the shelter to avoid the rain but be safe from the mosquitoes if no one else came by nightfall. Just as we were talking about that up comes HillBilly, I was so excited to see him. He decided to set up his tent outside so he could avoid the mosquitoes. His tent is not free standing so he couldn’t put it in the shelter with ours. The mosquitoes are so bad he couldn’t even sit and visit with us so we will have to catch up tomorrow. 
Day 34, Tuesday July 13What a day! RainMan and I woke up in the tents we had set up in the shelter last night and thankfully we did!! Hillbilly came flying up in his rain jacket and rain pants, but net on his face. His hands were waving in the air and slapping his body; mosquitoes were horrible and thick. He said when he woke up it was to the sound of that high pitched buzzing as hundreds flew around his tent and crawled on it. Being covered up they were attacking him as he waited for me to pack up, no breakfast for us this morning leisurely or not, we needed out of there! The morning was cloudy and thick with moisture. Everything I had was wet or very damp, more so than when I hung everything in the shelter out of rains way. After hiking a couple of miles we took a break on a large rock and had a simple breakfast. Shortly after we saw a sign in the woods proclaiming Trail Magic ahead in 5.2 miles!! We hiked as fast as we could considering the terrain which included lots of rocks and boulders. I just don’t understand, Pennsylvania is called Rocksylvania due to all the rocks, but New Jersey and New York are just as bad. We had a lot more pulling and pushing of bodies to get them over the next batch of huge rocks and boulders. I’ve taken pictures but none of them can provide an image which best describes how steep and large these boulders are. Never would I have thought I’d be doing this and accomplishing it. After a somewhat large descent we came upon the trail magic and what a perfect day for it. Hillbilly is about out of food for lunches and here was a feast. Hamburgers and hotdogs, candy and cookies and a variety of cold drinks. I asked for no bun and when I did the guy running asked if I was gluten free. When I said yes he said he was too and got me a gluten-free bun from his bag and grilled it up. That was true trail magic!!! Another huge bit of magic received there, and a great example of phrase the trail provides, is that Hillbilly was completely out of stove gas and I only had enough for one or two boils left. The guy sitting there at the table had almost full canister of fuel that he gave to us! They had a pop up tent and under it placed a long table with tablecloth and padded chairs. There were also chairs outside the tent area. We enjoyed visiting with everyone, ate our fill and headed back on the trail. Another form of trail magic today were the tons of fresh blueberries we found ripe along the trail edge. We also came upon a very interesting trail magic. At the opening of a meadow was a box labeled Trail Magic. Inside this small box sitting on the ground was I believe a couple of small packs of fruit chews but the other items looked like small vials of sample perfume. My hunch was verified when I poked them with my That away and a horrible perfume smell floated low bush. The low bush berries had the most berries that were ripe. 
We talked about the zoo coming up and decided to camp a couple of miles earlier than planned and will work out tomorrow’s miles so we are only hiking a few miles before getting to the zoo on Thursday. The zoo is very limited to the number of hours it’s open so we are trying to plan accordingly. Just before we got to the pond we were staying at we saw Skully and he decided to stay at the pond too. We are so happy we did. It was an a beautiful campsite with only the three of us here. The frogs serenaded us all night long and the view of the pond amidst massive rocks was phenomenal. The shelter we were going to originally didn’t have a privy or water source so we were gaining nothing by moving forward. 
Day 35, Wednesday July 14Well, I had my poncho hanging outside to dry throughout the night and my tent bags and of course it rained! But my tent stayed nice and dry inside and I was able to pack up the rain fly on the outside of my pack. Hillbilly, Skully and I had a wonderful morning at our beautiful campsite. The geese were flying and honking all morning long, ducks were floating in the water and the mist hung heavily over the pond for the first part of the morning. As we got ready to pack up and leave the sun had burned off the mist and the pond was absolutely beautiful. We took our time this morning eating breakfast, sitting on rocks with our padded seats and enjoying the beauty of the morning. Looks like the sun may actually come out and perhaps dry us up a bit. We are trying to plan our day today so that we end up with just about 5 miles before we hike into the New York zoo tomorrow morning! Today was a day of great views and beautiful forest. It felt like we were in a scene from Lord of the Rings! After a couple of hours we came upon a large rock on the ridge, very large and flattish. We decided to spread out our wet rain flys and ponchos to dry out in the sun and have a snack. We got started hiking again and in a little while Hillbilly and I decided to hike on without Skully because we needed to get in more miles than he wanted to. The hike went over a wide variety of terrain which included both rocky paths and thick pine needle carpets. The rocks in some places along the ridge were very long and slightly bumped and seemed to be the very spine of the earth erupting from its skin of dirt. At one point we came around the corner and on the ground slightly off trail were a pair of very new hiking boots, and that’s it; no hiker or pack to be seen. It was very odd indeed. Just as we turned a corner later in the day, a large deer slowly walked across the trail in front of us acting as if she didn’t see us, slugs were everywhere, humidity high and mushrooms dotted the forest floor. In our last mile, we went up over huge boulders all on a staircase made from over 100 carefully placed stones. I can’t even imagine the amount of work it took to create and place those stones correctly. It was impossible to capture a picture of just how steep these steps were and how many there were because they just wanted to blend into the actual stone of the mountain. They were amazing both in climbing and work. Very near the end of our hike we had to cross four lanes of highway traffic, two lanes at a time, talk about taking your life in your hands! For about a quarter of a mile on a ridge we walked with blueberry plants surrounding us on both sides and many of the berries were ripe. There were literally thousands of blueberry plants. We arrived at the place we planned on camping, about 50 yards from a little creek with a bridge crossing. The site is right off the trail making it easy in the morning to pack up and head out. 
Day 36, Thursday July 15We woke up to no rain overnight!!! I lay in my tent this morning watching a Daddy Longlegs between my tent screen and tent fly trying to grab insects and me hoping it would grab up mosquitoes and eat them. I found out last night my dear Uncle Bill had died the day before and tried to wrap my brain around the sadness in my heart and the fact we never did get back to visit like we had hoped. He was a good man and led a long wonderful life bush I will miss him. Looks like it could be the perfect day for a walk to the zoo! I was awake first and started packing up my gear, when I still hadn’t heard any movement in Hillbilly’s tent I made more noise and called out to him to get up! We finished up our breakfast and chores and hit the road. We were both short on food so we’re glad we would reach a place we could resupply by end of day. We started down the path and we’re surprised at how nice the trail was despite the steep upgrade at first. After a couple of miles we were descending a large hill and were shocked at seeing a table set up loaded with food items, chairs and coolers. This trail magic was completely unexpected and so appreciated. We sat there for almost 30 minutes enjoying bananas, Gatorade, bars and chips. I never fail to become overwhelmed with emotion when facing trail magic. The generosity of strangers who give there time and resources for hikers they have never met is unbelievable in a time where it seems as if the media wants you to believe we all dislike each other. I simply love the almost daily acts of kindness bestowed on me every day. The next portion of our hike took us through the most beautiful section of trail yet. We were at Bear Mountain climbing and descending at least 1000 stone steps, many with a stone retaining wall along one side. I am talking elaborately cut massive stones cut to fit alongside the next one. I can’t fathom the labor involved. There were beautiful views of rural New York and the Hudson River far below and placed on a huge flat rock was a bench at each view point made of logs. All along with his section of trail were bushes of wine berries. I have never seen these before and didn’t know if they were edible but Hillbilly said once they were a deep maroon color they were ripe, and boy were they! Ripe, juicy, sweet and oh so good were these tender little berries. They are so delicate when ripe I don’t know how a store could possibly package and sell them. I believe I like them even more than blueberries. At one point was more of a tourist spot you could drive to with more gorgeous views and many places to sit and relax. It’s hard to describe, and even pictures can’t show it well enough, how many more stone stairs there were, the steepness of the terrain and the elaborate stone landings between some of the sets of stairs, simply phenomenal. We continued down, down, down until at last we reached the Bear Mountain park. Seeing as it isn’t a weekend I was extremely surprised at how crowded it was. It was a beautiful, well maintained park with an enormous lake for paddle boating and year round trout fishing. There was an old inn at the park, a very nicely stocked gift store and hiker cafe and a concession stand. I ended up getting a cheese burger on lettuce, fries and a power aide. Hillbilly and I sat at the picnic table and relaxed for a bit until we noticed it was 3:15 and the zoo closed at 4:00! We hurriedly threw away our trash and following the white blazes walked by the enormous football field plus sized swimming pool and straight into the very little but nice zoo. There weren’t a lot of animals to see, a fox, lizards, frogs and snakes and two bears. The bears looked pretty old but the amazing sight in the bear pen were the vultures. I’ve never seen anything like it. There were close to 70 of these giant black birds sitting on the ground, in the trees and on the fencing around the pen. We could not figure out what was attracting them. We finished up the short but fun zoo excursion just as they were closing and continued on our way. We crossed a beautiful large bridge traversing the Hudson River and a railroad track. It wasn’t long before we were back on the mountain, this time with steep climbs and no stairs. Hillbilly was a little concerned because he didn’t have much water left and the day had become really hot and muggy. It wasn't long however and two day hikers came by. We chatted a bit then one of them asked if we needed any water!!! Unbelievable!!! She opened her daypack and pulled out her water carrier and poured ice water into Hillbilly’s bottle. It is so true, the trail provides!!! We had a lot of ups and downs for a few miles and kept dreaming of the place we were headed which was a deli/resupply and tent site. A couple of miles before reaching our goal I was starting to feel nauseous and way too hot. We slowed down and I kept drinking water with my eye on the prize. When we got to our stop at long last we realized the place was simply a gas station with a deli that already closed and no camping. We sat at the picnic tables outside to cool off and rethink our plan. We found out there was a stealth site .1 mile away where we could potentially tent. After Hillbilly drinking a beer and me having cold water and an ice cream bar we bought a couple of things for dinner and proceeded to our stealth site. The Appalachian Trail actually went right by the gas station and across the street to enter back into the woods. It went up a slight grade and a hundred feet off the road was a perfect place to set up our tents. We could easily hear the cars on the street below but no more miles today and the fact we could walk down for breakfast sealed the deal! After setting up camp we actually walked back to the gas station to use their bathroom and eat our dinner on the picnic table. Two other through hikers were there and we conversed with them for awhile. One claims he left Georgia 45 days ago and was already here. We weren’t so sure about his story. The other guy was even more interesting. He was in his 20s I’m guessing and for the last four years has lived on the streets traveling the country eating out of trash cans, begging from McDonald’s and smoking cigarette butts found in ash trays. I wanted to feel sorry for him but he does this on purpose and took great pride in telling the stories. All in all a great day, we will see what tomorrow brings!","

WhichWay,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640982,"It’s an amazing phenomenon out here on the trail as to how quickly close connections are created between hikers of all ages and walks of life. I believe this is due to everyone basically being on same page. Nobody has a clue as to a hiker’s net worth, number of assets, type of home or number of toys. Hikers have a past like everyone else but those details are left in the past because now we are all the same smelly people, all with same goal and similar struggles. We strive to help each other throughout our day, share stories of our trail experiences, chat about our next stops and what might be coming up. It comes down to just who we are at the moment and no one is judged on any past actions and we all connect. Every hiker is part of your story and you theirs, no pretenses, no bullshit. All that matters is getting through the next mile, the heat, the rain, the rocks and the inclines. We share stories of our families, our past experiences on the trail, how we got our trail names and what concoction we come up with to eat. We listen to each other’s views on religion and life, not much politics but some depending on the current group. Everyone is open to other opinions and most use this time to evaluate a variety of viewpoints which are provided as the hikers you meet come from everywhere around the world and bring with them ideas you may not have thought about before. It is amazing and such a vivid illustration of how small our world is when you see hikers coming across a person living a few miles from them or living in an area they grew up in. It’s a huge world but so small at the same time. Life at home is complicated with everyday issues, tasks, and reoccurring drama. On the other hand it is also not so complicated as you go through your daily routine, drive to where you need to go, drink water directly from the tap, cook up your meals from a variety of options in the pantry and fridge on your four plus burner stove and never worry about the availability of electricity for charging gadgets or using a toaster. The trail is much like that, complicated but not.  Every morning and evening you have your routines for your day. Simple tasks for making meals and setting up and taking down camp, the repacking of your pack and putting one foot in front of the other. Decisions such as how long can I take a break and where to set up camp are based solely on weather and daily goals. Things get a bit more complicated however as you plan how much food and water to carry and get you through safely to your next resupply, where will you resupply and how can you get there. How long can I use my phone before I use up my battery and backup? Those questions all seem simple but are really extremely important when electronic gadgets out here are relied on heavily for planning purposes, safety and navigation. It is amazing to me how life at home and on the trail is so completely different for the obvious reasons, but in how the simplicity and complexity of every day tasks are somewhat reversed and in how connections between individuals are created in different manners between the two environments.","

Wearing sunscreen sadly is a pointless endeavor, within minutes of applying the humidity and heat cause  immense sweating and my face is being wiped off with a bandanna constantly, with the moisture goes the sunscreen.

WhichWay,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641252,"Day 37, Friday July 16 Woke up throughout the night to the sounds of wheels rolling down the highway below. New York must never sleep! Other than that the spot we camped at was perfect because it was a beautiful, flat spot only a few feet off the trail and even more perfect, just about a hundred feet down the hill and across the highway to the gas station was breakfast! W headed that way and other hikers showed up throughout the morning. There were a few picnic tables outside and in and out we all went gathering food to eat and coffee to drink. There was a huge bathroom the size of a bedroom with only one stool in it. The funny thing is there was a big TV in there as well blasting news and weather reports. Today is supposed to be the hottest day in the year so far. Once Hillbilly and I were ready and done visiting we headed out to the trail. It was probably only five minutes into our day when sweat already began invading my clothing and dripping down my face. Within the first mile we came very close to the monastery which also allows backpackers to sleep on their lawn. We would have stayed there last night but it would have meant hiking in further last night and hiking back again to get breakfast and we were exhausted from the hard hike in the heat and didn’t want to hike longer. A few minutes after we passed the monastery the time was on the hour and for five minutes we heard a sweet melody flowing from the bell tower. We started the day with a steep uphill and as our clothes became saturated with sweat we quickly realized there was no way we were going to make 15 miles today due to a later start but mainly the heat. We found a park just a little over nine miles down the trail and aimed for that. In the meantime we ran across Skully and another hiker, they also looked miserably hot. Skully ended up hiking with us for awhile and about halfway through the day we started looking for more water. We all had some but the next available water was a ways down the road. We came out on a road and small creek which was flowing well and stood in the shade discussing the best place to reach it. A white mini van rounded the corner about then and stopped to ask if we were thru-hikers and if we needed anything. We all said, ‘water’. This lady said she lived close and we be back in 10-15 minutes. While she was gone the heat had bothered my digestive system so I had to go find a thicket pretty quickly and do what I needed to do. Unfortunately I’m afraid after the fact I was in the midst of poison oak!! For the rest of the day if I had the opportunity I used up precious wet wipes trying to free the bottom side of my body from any potential oils and resulting disastrous rashes. Time will tell if I was successful. After I took care of my needs we all sat in the shade and took off our packs. I was way too hot so with water coming I did the sacrilegious act of pouring precious water on my head and was that ever wonderful. She returned with plenty of water. I was so grateful for her kindness I couldn’t help but tear up trying to thank her which caused her to tear up and then Hillbilly. We were a hot mess!!  We got back on our feet and headed out trying to keep our pace on the slower side to avoid overheating. Skully was with us on and off depending on how many times he needs to sit and rest a minute. Skully is a man who has lived a very full and interesting life. He has climbed El Capitan seven times, is friends with the guy who did the solo rock climb and holds the record for falling the furthest from the walls at Yellowstone and surviving. Then he has to fall from a ladder and break his neck. He has a rod in his neck to basically hold his head up. To come out here after that ordeal and all it’s repercussions takes true grit. It rained on us for a bit which helped cool things down for a minute but it wasn’t long before the humidity stirred itself up once again and engulfed us. Throughout the day we also ran into the thickest and deepest black mud. Thankfully many of those places had rocks and logs we could step on, my pole sinking at least a foot. Some places were unavoidable and our shoes oozed mud around the edges. We turned a corner at one point and there was a MASSIVE stone foundation with a plaque. Turns out this was the foundation of a large barn which George Washington used as a Small Pox vaccination center for all the troops. I have seen many stone walls throughout my hike but this area we were in had so many scattered throughout the trees here, all remnants of a time gone by. A time when this forest had been stripped of its trees and under a mind blowing amount of work been made into farmland, now returned to forest. I try to imagine what this land looked like and the people toiling to work this rocky terrain but it is impossible to conjure up what that past really looked like. We finally reached our destination after a few more climbs and mouthfuls of wine berries. Barely had caught up with us and joined us at the camp we had found. I think backpackers are actually supposed to camp by the beach area somewhere but we had read they could possibly tent on a larger site; we went with that! We walked behind a gate and down a short trail which opened up into a beautiful field complete with picnic tables, a fire ring and outhouses. It was perfect!!
Day 38, Saturday July 17I slept well overall except for a ruckus that woke me up around 2:30 a.m. There was either another large group camping spot beyond the trees or someone’s house. All evening sounds floated our way which included a bunch of people, old and young, playing games and having a great time. In the middle of the night though I awoke to at least two people yelling and fighting over something, their words mainly lost and carried away by distance, but the tone and the few words I caught left no doubt it was a major disagreement. This argument felt like it lasted about 45 minutes and kept escalating!! We woke up to no rain overnight and none forecasted until the afternoon. We packed up our gear and stopped by the pump house to fill up our water bottles. The water flowing from the pump house didn’t need to be filtered and was ice cold, the perfect water source. The morning brought several ups and downs as far as elevation changes but it was not a strenuous trail other than the humidity and heat adding an anchor to our legs. There was a section of trail that was very impressive with major stone walls on either side of the five foot or so wide path. I have no idea what the original intent was for his path when built many years ago but we came up with all kinds of thoughts such as an old railroad bed or maybe a way to bring tourists into the mountains via some type of transportation. Today was a major milestone for me as I reached my 400 mile mark! I made myself a sign out of rocks to take my picture with. Skully had caught up with us before we broke camp this morning so he and Hillbilly and I stopped at a place with a couple of logs and rocks we could sit on and have a little rest stop. While sitting there a guy presented himself, he had been quietly sitting above our spot on a rock. He was getting ready to meet with the monks at a nearby monastery. I believe he wanted to stay with them for awhile to learn what he could from them without becoming a monk himself and was trying to make arrangements with them. He was a nice guy and seemed to be dealing with internal struggles as he tries to impossibly untangle all the answers to age old questions about humanity. While searching for answers he has lived with Indians and Buddhist monks among others we didn’t have details for. After our break we left him and took off for the lake. The mile plus into the lake area seemed to last forever because we had been looking forward to swimming in the lake and eating from the concession stand for a couple of days. It was once again incredibly hot and our clothes sopping wet. I even ended up with wrinkled hands and skin peeling off due to constant wetness from both sweat and the humidity. A long last we could hear voices far below us, beyond the trees; the unmistakable noise of laughter and playing in the water. We headed to the concession stand to order some lunch. It was typical concession food with hamburgers and hotdogs and smelled delicious. Just as we finished our meals the sky opened up and turned everything into a hot mess. No swimming for us because all that water was punctuated with lightening and thunder. Moonshine and her brother Jordon were going to be arriving soon to pick us up anyway so our timing was just off. The rain did stop for awhile and more backpackers kept showing up either to camp or just to grab some hot food. Just as Moonshine and Jordon pulled up and we literally were piling our backpacks in the truck, when the sky opened up again, perfect timing! We headed to the motel which wasn’t that far away but it took a while because the roads in New York are somewhat confusing and the GPS kept telling Jordan to turn after it was too late. It had been difficult to find a hotel at all due to the weekend and of course it’s summertime and everyone is traveling. It was much pricier than what any of us wanted to spend but we were so ready to get out of the weather and get cleaned up so price wasn’t going to be a deterrent. After getting checked in we headed out to some get some food and ended up at a little taco place, it was just all right but it was definitely better than trail food! After stopping for a couple of things to drink in our rooms and I of course grabbed a little ice cream, we headed back to the hotel and our individual rooms. I can’t tell you how wonderful it was to take a super hot shower and feel so clean again! I spent what was left of the evening making a couple phone calls, working on my journal and just happy to have my legs up in bed so that they can rest and perhaps ease a little bit of the swelling from all of this heat and walking. 
Day 39, Sunday July 18Oh my gosh, it was unbelievable how wonderful sleeping in a real bed with real pillows felt! It was hard to drag myself out of the coziness but I did and we all met downstairs at 7:30 and walked across the lot to the local Denny’s for breakfast. Denny’s reminds me of home and traveling. Not that we eat at Denny’s while at home but it is always our pick for breakfast when Bill and I travel on the road so it brings back lots of memories. Hillbilly And Moonshine had never been to Denny’s before, I guess they don’t have them down their way. Skully was super kind and bought breakfast for all of us!! After we ate it was chore time and we drug all our nasty smelling clothes to the laundry mat. I was so excited when taking my soft, clean smelling articles out of the dryer I couldn’t help but hold a couple of things up to my nose; I know I looked like a very crazy person at the moment and I didn’t care! Everything you have out here is minimal and each item important. All small pleasures are huge and appreciated and not overlooked. It seems as if my sense of smell has increased and hopefully when I get home I will remember and not take so much for granted. Walmart was next. In ‘real’ life I don’t usually care much for Walmart anymore. It seems as if their selection is limited, shelves are half empty and there are never any cashiers. Now it is the place to stock up on ziplock freezer bags, travel size toothpaste, instant mashed potatoes and lots of trail mix. It’s all a matter of what it is you really need versus want. I’m sure when I return to my normal life I will once again shop where meat is fabulous, produce is fresh, out of the ordinary ingredients are accessible and Walmart will not be my number one choice. Back in my room I repackaged my food bag and took another shower and took some time to make a few phone calls and just relax in a quiet room all in my own space. I don’t think I’ve been in a space truly alone since I’ve been on the trail! For dinner we went to Applebee’s and I had a huge plate of nachos and couldn’t eat but a little over half, but they were delicious. One more night in my cozy bed then back to the trail we go!!!! Looking forward to a cooler day with no rain. 
Day 40, Monday July 19When I woke up on the morning we were leaving the hotel it was with mixed feelings I headed out the door to met at the truck at 7:00. I was happy to get back on the trail in my clean attire but also sad to leave the coziness of my hotel room! As we were loading up the truck it started to rain. I couldn’t believe it. We drive over to McDonalds to grab us some breakfast and since the rain had stopped for a minute we stood outside by the truck to eat. I set my plastic tray with its egg inside on the edge of the truck bed for a second when a breeze caught the plate and flipped it to the ground. I just stared at the intact pancake and egg on the ground, then like true hiker trash I scooped it up, put it back on the plate and ate it! Thankfully as soon as we got to the lake where we were being dropped off the rain stopped and it was just lightly breezy and cloudy which made it perfect for hiking. There were dozens of rock walls again everywhere. Many were in straight lines and others were in a square or rectangle formation. I want to research how they got here and when. I try to imagine what this area looked like when the walls were new and within the forest houses and barns and crops replaced the trees. The path was beautiful and full of pine needles, the forest itself more open and full of tall slender trees. We did spot a really nice wasp nest in the bushes and later in the day came across another twice as big in a tree. We enjoyed enjoyed a break on top of a large flat boulder eating oranges and enjoying the sky full of clouds in every shade. After our break we continued our journey and ran into an area devastated with downed trees everywhere. It looked like a bunch of giant matchsticks had dropped from the sky. It looked like tornado must have hit this area awhile ago. A bit later down the trail there was another area with huge downed trees that still had all their fresh green leaves We suspect this damage was caused by one of the most recent storms and were so happy we weren’t hiking in the area when that storm broke open. One tree laying on its side surrounded by a crown of leaves attached to the broken limbs had a massive root ball over three stories high. I can’t imagine the noise that made when it fell over but even more crazy to me is how a giant tree with its extremely shallow root system ever stood on this pile of rocks long enough to get this big. We headed to a really nice shelter right on the trail, we had been told there was a Trail Magic barbecue going on there today. Sadly when we arrived we discovered it was yesterday. It’s a beautiful spot with a very clean shelter. The shelter had several picnic tables so we sat and enjoyed our lunch there. After we left we went about 1/2 a mile where we ran across a cooler with drinks and exactly four ice cold snickers bars, enough exactly for the four of us! Other hikers came up behind us as we finished our candy which was good, we didn’t want them to feel bad about about no more candy bars. Today I also spotted a mushroom of yet another color, black, it was this first I had seen of this color. Our final destination after climbing some steep ups and downs was a little deli about .5 off the trail. There we enjoyed a deli feast and of course ice cream before heading to the back where thru-hikers are allowed to tent camp for free. Overall a great day, trail magic, beautiful forests, no rain, great hiking trails and no heat wave. 
Day 41, Tuesday July 20Literally right next door to the deli was a concrete plant of some sort which has large trucks in and out all night and starts manufacturing at about four in the morning. It was a noisy night to be sure but in spite of that I still slept somewhat decent as the cool breeze blew through the screen on my open tent door. The only downside to our tent site was there was no privy. The man running the store and opening it at six in the morning, also the owner, was kind enough to to let us two women ‘secretly’ use the bathroom! We let Skully know our end destination so he could catch up by end of day. We took off and walked back into the mountains and were dumped back onto a road for about half a mile. We then headed back into the mountains and were taken down stone steps and a beautiful wood bridge crossing the creek. We also turned a corner and were suddenly walking through a wide open meadow full of just a few trees, thick bushes, and tons of wildflowers. Back into the woods we came to a gorgeous, huge tree solidly placed on a flat surface with its roots appearing to be deep in the ground, giving this giant a chance to thrive. This is in contrast to the smaller trees we see with the roots all crawling across the surface; their future seems sure to be one where as the tree grows large it will land on its side one day after a giant wind blows it over with an incredible roar while its life is ripped from the ground it was sprouted in. A nice rest on a log and back to the trail we went. Wet trails punctuate this area, nothing seems to ever dry out. It’s nice in one way because the trails aren’t dry with pebbles rolling around to make you slip but on the other hand it is a mosquito heaven and enough to make you crazy. This morning I woke up to a very wet tent and it never rained a drop. Moisture just hangs in the air like a sheer curtain. We ate our lunch at a shelter in the afternoon. My new favorite is a gluten free wrap from Mission smeared with peanut butter and jelly, maybe add a little trail mix, then roll it up like a crepe. So good!!! But now I’m out of wraps, sadly I’m not sure when and where I’ll find more but hopefully I will at some point. We started off again and our cooler morning had simply vanished and in its place was humidity and the resulting mosquitoes. I couldn’t believe the sudden change, it was as if someone just opened a door into a different environment. The climbs became much harder as we struggled to breathe in the thick air. Skully fell twice throughout the afternoon, thankfully nothing too bad and I did a super save variety of dance steps to keep from falling on my butt when I caught my foot on a piece of rock. We really took it easy this second part of the day due to the humidity. Water sources were generous today and water easily obtained. We crossed several nice bridges over flowing creeks, did a small amount of bouldering and dodged a lot of black, thick mud. About a mile from our destination we passed by the largest oak tree on the Appalachian Trail. The tree is over 300 years old and over 20’ in diameter. It really is incredible to see this tree spreading its enormous limbs across the road. From there we had a little over a mile to reach our destination. We made a quick stop at one of the best and most easily obtainable water sources we’ve had for a while and this water tasted so cold and delicious! We planned on going back o this pasture advertised in Guthooks, complete with a gazebo, but after hiking up a very steep bill we were never able to find where the camping spots were. Sadly, we moved on up the path to find a stealth spot for the four of us. Fixing dinner among the mosquitoes was not a fun project but we made the most of it and tried to smoke them out with a small leaf fed fire. Tomorrow is supposed to bring rain, we will see. The trail seems to have a mind of it’s own. 
Day 42, Wednesday July 21Yesterday morning we woke up to no rain all night or in the morning but our tents were extremely wet due to the heavy dew. This morning our tents were dry even though we had rain during the night, so crazy how you just can’t guess outcomes even if they seem obvious. It was supposed to rain today starting at about 7 in the morning but it was not raining this morning and we got lucky for most of the day! We left camp and walked a little over a mile to a road then walked the road about .6 in to a little deli where we grabbed coffee and breakfast. The walk to the road though was through a swamp, literally. The swamp had cattails 10 feet tall and huge plants and wildflowers surrounding us and bushes well over 15 to 20 feet tall! Nice boardwalk through the marshes with a few benches to birdwatch but tons and tons of mosquitoes so I don’t believe anyone will be sitting and watching birds for awhile. Most of the trail was great, fewer stones and rocks, soft trail, wide open forest, more of the mind blowing rock walls and of course wine berries here and there. Parts of the trail are pure mud and swamp however with wood pathways over some of the worst parts. The wooden board are old and rotting in some areas and extra caution needs to be paid so you don’t fall off into the muck below. At one point we came out of the woods and there was not just a set of railroad tracks but it was a place where the train would stop and take you into New York City; it was pretty cool. Just short of where we were headed for lunch we came upon a cooler. The last two coolers we encountered have been empty so we didn’t get excited right away. This cooler however was full of trail magic. Cold drinks, cookies and candy and propel powder mix sat inside ready for thru hikers to enjoy!!! We choose a couple of things and carried them with us to our lunch spot. We enjoyed lunch at a shelter right on the trail and due to the sky looking a bit fussy I put my rain cover on before we started hiking again. Turns out we did run into some rain but thankfully not a lot. I think I was getting more wet from the condensation under the rain coat then I would have from the rain itself. A highlight of today,  I am now in Connecticut!!!! At one point we were supposed to take a detour around a bridge that was in terrible shape. Somehow we didn’t exactly get the message so we got to the stream and immediately saw the bridge was impassable. Thankfully the stream was easy to ford and we carried on. Our camp tonight was beside a beautiful raging river. Surprisingly the air was not swarming with mosquitoes for once and we could set up camp and sit and visit and enjoy our dinner without smacking our bodies repeatedly to kill off as many little pests as possible. One young hiker, late thirties came to join us. He has been feeling very homesick and contemplating going home. I think it helped him to vent a bit and he seemed cheerier after a couple of hours. I think the white noise of the river will be great for sleeping tonight.","

WhichWay,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641253,"I am using tidbits to write about things I may have forgotten in my journal or random thoughts. 

The day we were hiking  Bear Mountain we had stopped at a tourist viewpoint with a lotta potty. I set my pack on the ground, came out and picked up my pack and laying underneath was a bright shiny dime!! That was my special trail magic as my family knows!!!!
What I am about to say is going to seem a bit odd, heck, even crazy but it’s true. One day while we were hiking we came upon an enormous boulder with small flower looking groups of algae all over the face of it. It was if the ancient rock wanted me to reach out and touch it and when I did it was almost a spiritual experience. I can’t really explain it but I got chills and felt a sense of wonder. This boulder has existed since the universe was created most likely and has been pushed forward upwards time towards the sky. Who else over history has touched this stone, soldiers and farmers? It was an awesome experience and one not easily explained. 
All along the way trail magic has been real and there are so many solid examples of ‘the trail provides’. I believe in ‘real’ life there are so many examples of being offered gifts of generosity and kindness as well but we are too distracted with our own busyness to notice them. 
So far I like the New York trails themselves the best. They are well maintained and in many places have installed rock steps which is mind blowing in itself considering the type of labor involved 
The miles I record are trail miles only and don’t include all the miles hiked to get to shelters, food, water sources or through town. Those miles would be complicated to tally up but they certainly add up
The forest has all kinds of smells and I have smelled all the following which some are just plain odd!  Among the things I’ve smelt are cucumbers, mint, pine, cinnamon, chocolate,  dill, flowers, dead animal and oddest of all, toast. 
Most of the time white blazes are apparent, other times however i is like hunting for Easter eggs. ","

WhichWay,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641533,"Day 43, Thursday July 22 - Woke up to the sound of a roaring river and camp being quietly dismantled around me. There were four other campers besides us and all were packed up by the time I had my backpack loaded up. The river was wild and consisted of angry looking rapids and foam worthy of an ocean. The sound was almost deafening as we got closer and the water continued to boil. There was a wonderful bridge we crossed before moving back onto the trail and following the river for a distance. The river continued to swell and created some beautiful smaller waterfalls. Our first stop was a deli/grocery store/smoke shop about.6 off trail. We were a bit disappointed when we arrived. The deli consisted of bagels wrapped in plastic, coffee and juice, boiled eggs and pre-made sandwiches. It reminded a little of the complimentary breakfast you get at hotels these days since the pandemic started. I found some cheese, jerky and an apple juice and called it good. We had some great (meaning steep) climbs today that definitely created wet hiking attire. If you were going downhill it almost had a fall feel to the air; once you moved uphill the heat quickly grew and you were transported to summer once again. I saw a couple of cool mushrooms today, one was a purplish blue and the other orange and was in layers and resembled a flower. The terrain in some areas looked like we were in a jungle, in another area it resembled a rain forest. It seems as if this area contains more trees that are fairly young in relation to the few  trees that look like they are ancient. We were getting near our town stop after climbing a very steep mountain with matching drop when we came onto a guy doing trail magic and a cooler of ice cold drinks. We visited for a short time then took a mile walk into town. The town of Kent is quaint and I loved it. I believe if you lived there you could walk or ride a bike anywhere. They have kept the old houses and maintained them really well. All the stores and places to eat are in historic buildings as well. We stopped at a pizza shop where their menu is widely varied. I got an amazing burger cooked perfectly, some sweet potato fries and a hard cider, it was delicious. Skully was able to catch up with us so the four of us gathered our stuff and hit the town. We needed to get a resupply of food but sadly the grocery store did not have any gluten free wraps which have now become my favorite lunch. I get the mission gluten free wraps because they hold up well, squirt peanut butter on them, then some jelly and just maybe some trail mix. I roll them up the way you would a crepe and they are delicious! My new favorite but can’t be replicated until I find these wraps again. Next stop the coffee shop then a place for smokes and another stop for something to drink at camp. We headed towards the trail and passed an older home converted to a retirement home, a couple of residents enjoying the front porch. Out on the back lawn was a huge vulture just walking around with his old man face. What was a vulture doing hanging out in the middle of town with nothing obvious to feast on? Our road back to the trail was about a mile once we left the shops. Once on the trail we thought camp was about 1.5 miles. The trail was easy for a minute as it went over a fence and through a field, then it turned on us. We couldn’t believe it, the trail went straight up and on and on. After awhile Moonshine checked to see how close we were to camp and it was still 1.5 miles away, what the heck!!!! Sometimes when getting a reading from town it is inaccurate and at the end of the day it’s hard to get more miles added to your feet. This last section had so many massive trees blow down, it’s hard to imagine being out there while a storm is raging hard enough to rip these trees from the ground, roots and all. At one point, Skully who was on the trail behind us, got lost and started to holler; luckily I heard him and let Hillbilly know. We didn’t know why he was hollering so Hillbilly threw off his pack and ran. Turns out he wasn’t hurt but off trail somehow and needed some help. When we did arrive at our tent site it was nice with a running stream. We were all tired so after setting up camp, not hungry after town food so we and hung out for a bit and crawled in our tents away from the blood thirsty mosquitoes. TOTAL TRAIL MILES TODAY: 10.7TOTAL TRAIL MILES: 446.3
Day 44, Friday July 23 - It was a beautiful morning I woke up to and as I was inside my tent packing up with the front fly open I heard a loud crashing. I glanced through the screen and a doe and fawn we’re running through the trees and over the downed branches. It was a sight to start the day with. 
After packing up Hillbilly, Moonshine and myself headed out. Skully was still getting packed up  and was going to meet us on a rock up the way. Skully met up with us just as Hillbilly and Moonshine headed out so the two of us hiked together the duration of the day. There was a steep climb out but the views were fabulous. Gorgeous, thick trees, the river below and beautiful farm land all filled our heart and soul. For the next couple of hours we enjoyed the beautiful trail covered in a combination of sand and the most aromatic pine needles.  After a steep up hill we came upon monstrous rock steps going down down down. I took pictures of these steps but the picture does nothing to reflect the complexity of the boulders tossed haphazardly down the mountain pretending to be steps. These boulders could only be hiked down slowly and with extreme caution, many times sliding down on your butt using your hands to help balance. After we got down from boulder steps we were pleasantly surprised to be dropped onto a beautiful path along the wide rolling river. It was a quick easy hike to a shelter for lunch. After lunch we continued on this easy five miles path along river then at the end encountered trail magic, always a favorite. We had soda and delicious, sweet watermelon. That was kind he end of our easy miles for the day; the rest of the day was filled with ups and downs. At one point we came across a lone boulder as round and perfect as it could be, ancient and covered with lichen. It was monstrous and I had to say hello. Now that we are in Connecticut we are being treated to breathtaking creeks and waterfalls, the best water ever and the most available so far. The forest we are walking through is newer and more open with new growth flooding the forest floor and young trees everywhere. We did boulder scrambles at the top of most summits. Boulder scrambles don’t mean simply climbing over boulders, it means dangling your walking sticks on your wrists and using hands to pull your self up, over and down. They are difficult but a lot of fun. At one point we topped a mound of boulders and came upon boulders of white quartz; they were just beautiful and a great surprise. We also crossed through one of the hundreds of sites one walls we have seen but we his one was perfectly preserved and the spot we passed through was not torn down but purposely made back in the day as a pass through. We also went through an area with new trail work; a team has been making new rock steps, clearing the forest of old  and fallen trees near the trail. Also on my his section of the trail was a rock cairn which I added a small stone to. Got to the shelter and headed to the tent area where Hillbilly and Moonshine had already been set up and dinner done. Skully and I were starving and couldn’t get set up quick enough so we could make dinner. I made my standby, mashed potatoes potatoes with h turkey sausage and cheese mixed in. My special treat though was hot chocolate with peppermint schnapps in my father’s cup and gluten free Oreos. It was so delicious!  It was the first time not to finish writing my journal at night, I kept falling asleep at the keyboard! TOTAL TRAIL MILES TODAY: 14.9TOTAL TRAIL MILES: 461.2
Day 45, Saturday July 24 -   Beautiful day! Woke up this morning and my tent fly and footprint were wet so I packed them up in the outside pocket of my pack so I could easily access them at a break and set them out to dry. Hillbilly and Moonshine took off a bit earlier then us. Skully and I set out and the first climb of the day was not bad at all! We didn’t even break out into a sweat. It was the strangest sound we heard coming over the mountain top as we climbed words the top of the mountain, race cars! The sound went on and on as we heard the race cars screaming around a track somewhere and breaking a bit at tight curves. It wasn’t until a few miles later at a great vantage point high up the mountain that we could look far below and see the cars flying around the track. The race car noise permeated the air and lasted almost all day in varying degrees of loudness. It was crazy to be in the wilderness and hear race cars zooming around a track; the collision of two worlds.  After a couple of miles we came to a beautiful creek and camel upped! We did think this might be the last good water source for the day but turns out we were wrong. It honestly was such a beautiful trail today, nothing too crazy and a wonderful trail of soft black dirt, or sand or the most aromatic pine needles. It’s crazy because sometimes there is no pine odor and other times like today the aroma hung heavy in the air. The trail is often riddled with tree roots, thick and thin. Often times they are helpful because you can use them like steps; other times they are hazardous because you they are looped and want to catch your foot. Other roots are thick like octopus arms and wrap themselves around the rocks and trees crawling across the ground in erratic pattens. Often they remind me of veins bulging from a body builders tightly stretched skin. I had just mentioned to Skully I had t seen a frog or newt in a very long time when about five minutes later Skully spotted a really cool frog that was marked like a leopard. Throughout the forest there are thousands of small white moths, some alive but more dead laying next to tree trunks after laying eggs on the tree. These moths have enjoyed a life of eating up the forest. We took a snack break around 11 on a great fallen tree and I laid my wet tent parts on a rock in the sun to dry. After about 20 minutes we moved on hiking again to our next destination, Falls Village where are there is a cafe that promises to be great. A couple easy climbs including an area with stone steps eventually led us to a road where the AT continued. When we reached a road crossing we were checking on he direction of the cafe and a car pulled up and offered us a ride, trail magic!!!! We gladly accepted and were dropped at the cafe where we enjoyed a delicious lunch. I had a side salad (so happy for treen food) and a chicken curry sandwich on GF bread. Not great bread but it was bread. I also had a scoop of wonderful strawberry ice cream with hunks of strawberries in it. And they had a large GF peanut butter cookie and a lemon scone I got to take with me. The afternoon hike was a dream as well as we hiked along a wide pine needle path along the edge of the river. The air had a delicious spicy smell not unlike nutmeg. We came across the nicest lady doing a short hike with her dog. She was so happy to meet us because she had been very depressed due to a car accident she had a few weeks ago and broke her neck. Skully has his broken neck he’s been dealing with and offered her encouragement. She said we were angels! Down the trail we were met with a totally different type of trail magic. Walking down the trail toward us was a small buck, probably a yearling with small horn buds. I quickly snapped a couple of pictures then he kept coming towards us. We figured he must be the deer a hiker told us about yesterday and he named Buttons. As tame as a pet dog and so sweet he let us scratch his head and just hung out. I wonder if someone raised an orphaned fawn and released him. I hope he remains safe and away from hunters. We headed to the shelter and even though we knew it was .6 off the trail we were shocked to discover it was straight down a hill with a narrow path and using several rocks and boulders as part of the path. The mosquitoes were just horrible and we sprayed our area with all kinds of bug spray. It is supposed to rain tonight so we didn’t want to set up our tents and will sleep on the shelter floor with bug nets on our heads. We enjoyed small dinners after our town lunch and I enjoyed my hot chocolate and peanut butter cookie.TOTAL TRAIL MILES TODAY: 10.8TOTAL TRAIL MILES: 472
Day 46, Sunday July 25 - Thankfully we did not set up our tents and slept in the shelter; around 2:30 a.m. the rain started and came down hard the rest of the night. Once in awhile I could hear a small branch hit the tin roof and the rain beating on thee roof was calming but a bit noisy for solid sleeping. We had the shelter to ourselves and spent a lazy morning waiting for the rain to lighten up while eating breakfast. We packed up and we’re ready to hike out at 9:30 when it started pouring again. We looked at the weather and it should slow down or stop in 2 or 3 hours so we set our packs back down, sat in the tin roofed shelter to wait it out. 
Once we crawled out of the valley below the rocks it was a beautiful hike. It was like stepping into a fairy tale, misty ferns dotted the forest floor which was open and filled with super tall slim trees. There was one place where a large isolated rock jutted from the ground lol me a giant thumb. We gradually walked downhill into an open meadow with five foot tall purple flowers which were just breathtaking due to the sheer number. From there the trail took us onto a regular road walk through the quaint town of Salisbury.  This town is filled with beautiful older homes which are well-maintained and contain landscaping filled with naturalized flowers of every sort. Seems like every state I walk-through is a state that would be great to live in! LOL The town had a great little market. We both got some ice cream and I got some gluten-free gravy mix to put in my potatoes tonight to jazz them up a bit. After eating our ice cream, mine delicious cherry Garcia, we went back into the deli to get a regular lunch. Skully got himself a great looking hot sandwich and I got some kind of salad with greens and tomatoes and squash and a tangy lemon sauce. The weather is cool with a great breeze and cloudy keeping the sun off our heads. In town many houses have beautiful stone walls around the perimeter, they are beautifully built and look like they don’t even have any cement or mortar gluing them together. The curbs along the sidewalk are really cool too, all made of beautiful granite. It’s great how they use the resources within the mountain o beautify their town. Everyone here is friendly and customers at the grocery store would stop and ask questions about our hike. One guy stopped by and asked if there was anything at all he could do for us or get for us. We wished he had asked that question in an hour, then he could have driven us to the trailhead!!!!! Once back on the trail the day was suddenly filled with humidity to the point where Hillbilly’s glasses were fogged over. The climb out of town was very long and filled with sloppy black mud that sucked at your shoes and poles. In many places rocks were placed where you could step on them to avoid the mud somewhat. We had one particular area where we were climbing up an entire hillside of rocks. We were rewarded greatly though with the most beautiful view at a place covered with flat rock. It would have made a fabulous lunch spot. After many miles of seeing no more orange newts I saw another today, the little guy was very active and appeared to be struggling to get off the trail. We finally made it to our shelter which was thankfully not far off the trail tonight with plenty of running water nearby in a beautiful creek. Skully and I choose to stay in the shelter itself with one other hiker. Several others showed up but they all tented. In the eaves of the shelter there was a bird nest with baby birds!TOTAL TRAIL MILES TODAY: 9TOTAL TRAIL MILES: 481
Day 47, Monday July 26 - Went to bed with damp clothes hanging up to hopefully dry out, woke up to 97% humidity and wet clothes. Good grief!!! It was a beautiful hike out with mist filling the air. First thing we did was climb Bear Mountain which was strewn with tons of rocks but it really wasn’t hard.  The enormous, somewhat flat boulders were slightly humped in the middle making it appear as if we were walking on the spine of the earth. As we got closer to the top the landscape felt almost desert-like with scraggy bushes and short trees with pine needles and thick gnarly branches. Coming down the mountain was much more difficult. The spiny boulders had been replaced with a mound of boulders in every shape and size thrown down the the side of the mountain helter skelter. This away and That Way clicked and clacked as I let them drop into every crack and crevice I could find in order to lean into them and keep myself upright. The trail took us down to the river and transformed into a pine needle cushioned pathway with absolutely breathtaking views of the multiple waterfalls surrounded by tall pines. It was gorgeous! We stopped for lunch at the top of the ledges and spread out a couple of items to dry in the sun. It would have been a great view if there hadn’t been so much haze in the air from the high humidity. Despite the view being muted it was still a really cool spot to look down through the hazy valley and see all the farmland and farmhouses below. All along the trail we saw great campsites with pine needles padding the ground. Connecticut trails were very well marked and maintained, looks like the trails in Massachusetts will provide great views but the trails are poorly marked so far. It’s interesting because down by the river and other lower elevation points you have a perfect mountain scene with huge pines, several creeks and soft pine needle paths; up at the higher elevations I am reminded more of a desert type vegetation. It’s mind boggling to think many of the wonderful views I’m experiencing can only be seen by walking to where I’m at, driving here isn’t an option because there isn’t a way to drive up the mountain and see what I’m seeing. After lunch we walked along a rocky ledge on earth the ridge that went on for a great distance, all across the ridge were gorgeous views and thankfully a wonderful breeze washing over my sweat soaked skin. We were back to small, stubby pine trees and more blueberry bushes with only a handful of ripe berries. A large, black butterfly followed us for quite a ways, darting in and out of the trees and bushes. As we dropped back down we were getting very low on water and were relieved to find a happy little spring bubbling out of the earth right in the middle of the trail. The water was cold and delicious! Today we climbed three mountain, Bear, Race, and Everett Mountains. At the top of Everett there were concrete pillars where a fire tower used to stand. We descended our final mountain of the day and headed to our shelter for the night. The shelter was great and with the upstairs loft area provided space for ten hikers. Most nights in the shelters there have not been that many other hikers, maybe just a couple, but last night and tonight there have been about 8 additional young hikers. I don’t know where they are all coming from all of a sudden. They are all fun though and made for an enjoyable evening. TOTAL TRAIL MILES TODAY: 8.9TOTAL TRAIL MILES: 489.9
Day 48, Tuesday July 27- Today is town day and I cant wait to wash clothes and myself. I also need to resupply my food as I’m almost out of everything. Perfect timing, you don’t want to come into town with a bunch of food, means you’ve been carrying too much which equates to too much weight. We took off this morning and started with a somewhat steep incline but not too bad. The rocks here are very interesting and textured making them easier to get traction when walking on them and interesting to look at. Some resemble a tree because the ripples in the stone resemble black he texture of bark. Others sport beautiful pieces of white granite  trapped among the sea of grey. The rocks along this section are once again pieces of the earths spine erupting from the earth. After an uphill there is always a downhill. This one was steep and not surprisingly very rocky. The last part of the descent was peppered with stone steps leading to the bottom. It was a gorgeous forest the trail dumped us into. The forest was  flat and open with giant pine trees; all lower branches gone and only the upper beaches green creating an umbrella over the vegetation. There was a huge rock sitting solitary under the trees as if it was keeping watch. The trail in this area was off of a postcard, perfectly manicured with few roots and rocks , flat and level surrounded by tall tall trees and scattered ferns.  We left the forest and walked out into an open meadow. Meadows are an easy walk but are also open and out from under the trees where there is no shade and the sun beats down on your head. We passed by a farm in the distance where large, fat sheep were grazing on the hill. The meadow also surprised us with all the mud. This was juicy mud. There are several kinds of mud I’ve encountered on this trek. There is the juicy mud meaning more water than mud, drying out mud where you only sink a minor amount, gooey mud which will try to suck on the shoe off your foot or deceptive mud which looks thick and muddy but not deep but in reality sucks your walking pole down a couple of feet. Of course mud comes in all shades of brown from brown to almost black. Here on the trail most of my mud encounters have been with the dark black kind. We left the meadow and re-entered the forest. It was a gorgeous forest and would have made a great place for a snack but it was a forest swamp!  Mosquitoes were so thick you couldn’t even think off sitting down. We would walk on dry land then without warning we were crossing sloshy, muddy messes. In some place there were boards placed for walkways and in others not. We crossed over an odd shaped small bridge over the top of stagnant water. We he water was greasy looking, an odd reddish-brown tint to I and bugs skimming through he surface. I was very happy I didn’t need water. This hike would have been glorious if I hadn’t been in such a hurry to escape the madness of the bugs. As we were about to come to the road near where we were hoping to get a shuttle to the hotel we could smell burgers being grilled. As we left the fires there was an amazing structure made with a few long stripped trees and a tarp. Under the tarp we’re chairs and snacks and hamburgers and hotdogs hotdogs for the thru-hikers! As always I felt gratefully blessed. To make it even better, one of the guys helping with this trail magic offered to drive us to the motel. Turns out a few church groups working together are the ones providing this for us. They do it every day except Sunday for 16 weeks! We were dropped off at the Travel Lodge where we were able to get showered, do laundry and lay out all our stuff to air out. I even washed my shoes on some in my he sink to try to get rid of some stench. To dry them out I needed a sunny zoo. My room was on the second floor with a little balcony attached and he length of the building. On that balcony hung the motel sign, the only obvious place near me the sun was shining. So, like the true hiker trash I’ve become my shoes went on top of the hotel sign to dry out! Skully and I walked over to my he local Mexican restaurant and at long last I had Mexican food, fajitas and a margarita! I so here in bed with my feet propped up getting caught up on my journal. TOTAL TRAIL MILES TODAY: 8.0TOTAL TRAIL MILES: 497.9","

The terrain in some areas looked like we were in a jungle, in another area it resembled a rain forest. It seems as if this area contains more trees that are fairly young in relation to the few  trees that look like they are ancient. We were getting near our town stop after climbing a very steep mountain with matching drop when we came onto a guy doing trail magic and a cooler of ice cold drinks. We visited for a short time then took a mile walk into town. The town of Kent is quaint and I loved it. I believe if you lived there you could walk or ride a bike anywhere. They have kept the old houses and maintained them really well. All the stores and places to eat are in historic buildings as well. We stopped at a pizza shop where their menu is widely varied. I got an amazing burger cooked perfectly, some sweet potato fries and a hard cider, it was delicious. Skully was able to catch up with us so the four of us gathered our stuff and hit the town. We needed to get a resupply of food but sadly the grocery store did not have any gluten free wraps which have now become my favorite lunch. I get the mission gluten free wraps because they hold up well, squirt peanut butter on them, then some jelly and just maybe some trail mix. I roll them up the way you would a crepe and they are delicious! My new favorite but can’t be replicated until I find these wraps again. Next stop the coffee shop then a place for smokes and another stop for something to drink at camp. We headed towards the trail and passed an older home converted to a retirement home, a couple of residents enjoying the front porch. Out on the back lawn was a huge vulture just walking around with his old man face. What was a vulture doing hanging out in the middle of town with nothing obvious to feast on? Our road back to the trail was about a mile once we left the shops. Once on the trail we thought camp was about 1.5 miles. The trail was easy for a minute as it went over a fence and through a field, then it turned on us. We couldn’t believe it, the trail went straight up and on and on. After awhile Moonshine checked to see how close we were to camp and it was still 1.5 miles away, what the heck!!!! Sometimes when getting a reading from town it is inaccurate and at the end of the day it’s hard to get more miles added to your feet. This last section had so many massive trees blow down, it’s hard to imagine being out there while a storm is raging hard enough to rip these trees from the ground, roots and all. At one point, Skully who was on the trail behind us, got lost and started to holler; luckily I heard him and let Hillbilly know. We didn’t know why he was hollering so Hillbilly threw off his pack and ran. Turns out he wasn’t hurt but off trail somehow and needed some help. When we did arrive at our tent site it was nice with a running stream. We were all tired so after setting up camp, not hungry after town food so we and hung out for a bit and crawled in our tents away from the blood thirsty mosquitoes. TOTAL TRAIL MILES TODAY: 10.7TOTAL TRAIL MILES: 446.3
Day 44, Friday July 23It was a beautiful morning I woke up to and as I was inside my tent packing up with the front fly open I heard a loud crashing. I glanced through the screen and a doe and fawn we’re running through the trees and over the downed branches. It was a sight to start the day with. 
After packing up Hillbilly, Moonshine and myself headed out. Skully was still getting packed up  and was going to meet us on a rock up the way. Skully met up with us just as Hillbilly and Moonshine headed out so the two of us hiked together the duration of the day. There was a steep climb out but the views were fabulous. Gorgeous, thick trees, the river below and beautiful farm land all filled our heart and soul. For the next couple of hours we enjoyed the beautiful trail covered in a combination of sand and the most aromatic pine needles.  After a steep up hill we came upon monstrous rock steps going down down down. I took pictures of these steps but the picture does nothing to reflect the complexity of the boulders tossed haphazardly down the mountain pretending to be steps. These boulders could only be hiked down slowly and with extreme caution, many times sliding down on your butt using your hands to help balance. After we got down from boulder steps we were pleasantly surprised to be dropped onto a beautiful path along the wide rolling river. It was a quick easy hike to a shelter for lunch. After lunch we continued on this easy five miles path along river then at the end encountered trail magic, always a favorite. We had soda and delicious, sweet watermelon. That was the end of our easy miles for the day; the rest of the day was filled with ups and downs. At one point we came across a lone boulder as round and perfect as it could be, ancient and covered with lichen. It was monstrous and I had to say hello. Now that we are in Connecticut we are being treated to breathtaking creeks and waterfalls, the best water ever and the most available so far. The forest we are walking through is newer and more open with new growth flooding the forest floor and young trees everywhere. We did boulder scrambles at the top of most summits. Boulder scrambles don’t mean simply climbing over boulders, it means dangling your walking sticks on your wrists and using hands to pull your self up, over and down. They are difficult but a lot of fun. At one point we topped a mound of boulders and came upon boulders of white quartz; they were just beautiful and a great surprise. We also crossed through one of the hundreds of sites with walls we have seen but this one was perfectly preserved and the spot we passed through was not torn down but purposely made back in the day as a pass through. We also went through an area with new trail work; a team has been making new rock steps, clearing the forest of old  and fallen trees near the trail. Also on this section of the trail was a rock cairn which I added a small stone to. Got to the shelter and headed to the tent area where Hillbilly and Moonshine had already been set up and dinner done. Skully and I were starving and couldn’t get set up quick enough so we could make dinner. I made my standby, mashed potatoes with turkey sausage and cheese mixed in. My special treat though was hot chocolate with peppermint schnapps in my father’s cup and gluten free Oreos. It was so delicious!  It was the first time not to finish writing my journal at night, I kept falling asleep at the keyboard! TOTAL TRAIL MILES TODAY: 14.9TOTAL TRAIL MILES: 461.2
Day 45, Saturday July 24Beautiful day! Woke up this morning and my tent fly and footprint were wet so I packed them up in the outside pocket of my pack so I could easily access them at a break and set them out to dry. Hillbilly and Moonshine took off a bit earlier then us. Skully and I set out and the first climb of the day was not bad at all! We didn’t even break out into a sweat. It was the strangest sound we heard coming over the mountain top as we climbed towards the top of the mountain, race cars! The sound went on and on as we heard the race cars screaming around a track somewhere and breaking a bit at tight curves. It wasn’t until a few miles later at a great vantage point high up the mountain that we could look far below and see the cars flying around the track. The race car noise permeated the air and lasted almost all day in varying degrees of loudness. It was crazy to be in the wilderness and hear race cars zooming around a track; the collision of two worlds.  After a couple of miles we came to a beautiful creek.  We did think this might be the last good water source for the day but turns out we were wrong. It honestly was such a beautiful trail today, nothing too crazy and a wonderful trail of soft black dirt, or sand or the most aromatic pine needles. It’s crazy because sometimes there is no pine odor and other times like today the aroma hung heavy in the air. The trail is often riddled with tree roots, thick and thin. Often times they are helpful because you can use them like steps; other times they are hazardous because you they are looped and want to catch your foot. Other roots are thick like octopus arms and wrap themselves around the rocks and trees crawling across the ground in erratic patterns. Often they remind me of veins bulging from a body builders tightly stretched skin. I had just mentioned to Skully I had t seen a frog or newt in a very long time when about five minutes later Skully spotted a really cool frog that was marked like a leopard. Throughout the forest there are thousands of small white moths, some alive but more dead laying next to tree trunks after laying eggs on the tree. These moths have enjoyed a life of eating up the forest. We took a snack break around 11 on a great fallen tree and I laid my wet tent parts on a rock in the sun to dry. After about 20 minutes we moved on hiking again to our next destination, Falls Village where there is a cafe that promises to be great. A couple easy climbs including an area with stone steps eventually led us to a road where the AT continued. When we reached a road crossing we were checking on he direction of the cafe and a car pulled up and offered us a ride, trail magic!!!! We gladly accepted and were dropped at the cafe where we enjoyed a delicious lunch. I had a side salad (so happy for green food) and a chicken curry sandwich on GF bread. Not great bread but it was bread. I also had a scoop of wonderful strawberry ice cream with hunks of strawberries in it. And they had a large GF peanut butter cookie and a lemon scone I got to take with me. The afternoon hike was a dream as well as we hiked along a wide pine needle path along the edge of the river. The air had a delicious spicy smell not unlike nutmeg. We came across the nicest lady doing a short hike with her dog. She was so happy to meet us because she had been very depressed due to a car accident she had a few weeks ago and broke her neck. Skully has his broken neck he’s been dealing with and offered her encouragement. She said we were angels! Down the trail we were met with a totally different type of trail magic. Walking down the trail toward us was a small buck, probably a yearling with small horn buds. I quickly snapped a couple of pictures then he kept coming towards us. We figured he must be the deer a hiker told us about yesterday and he named Buttons. As tame as a pet dog and so sweet he let us scratch his head and just hung out. I wonder if someone raised an orphaned fawn and released him. I hope he remains safe and away from hunters. We headed to the shelter and even though we knew it was .6 off the trail we were shocked to discover it was straight down a hill with a narrow path and using several rocks and boulders as part of the path. The mosquitoes were just horrible and we sprayed our area with all kinds of bug spray. It is supposed to rain tonight so we didn’t want to set up our tents and will sleep on the shelter floor with bug nets on our heads. We enjoyed small dinners after our town lunch and I enjoyed my hot chocolate and peanut butter cookie.TOTAL TRAIL MILES TODAY: 10.8TOTAL TRAIL MILES: 472
Day 46, Sunday July 25Thankfully we did not set up our tents and slept in the shelter; around 2:30 a.m. the rain started and came down hard the rest of the night. Once in awhile I could hear a small branch hit the tin roof and the rain beating on thee roof was calming but a bit noisy for solid sleeping. We had the shelter to ourselves and spent a lazy morning waiting for the rain to lighten up while eating breakfast. We packed up and we’re ready to hike out at 9:30 when it started pouring again. We looked at the weather and it should slow down or stop in 2 or 3 hours so we set our packs back down, sat in the tin roofed shelter to wait it out. 
Once we crawled out of the valley below the rocks it was a beautiful hike. It was like stepping into a fairy tale, misty ferns dotted the forest floor which was open and filled with super tall slim trees. There was one place where a large isolated rock jutted from the ground lol me a giant thumb. We gradually walked downhill into an open meadow with five foot tall purple flowers which were just breathtaking due to the sheer number. From there the trail took us onto a regular road walk through the quaint town of Salisbury.  This town is filled with beautiful older homes which are well-maintained and contain landscaping filled with naturalized flowers of every sort. Seems like every state I walk-through is a state that would be great to live in! LOL The town had a great little market. We both got some ice cream and I got some gluten-free gravy mix to put in my potatoes tonight to jazz them up a bit. After eating our ice cream, mine delicious cherry Garcia, we went back into the deli to get a regular lunch. Skully got himself a great looking hot sandwich and I got some kind of salad with greens and tomatoes and squash and a tangy lemon sauce. The weather is cool with a great breeze and clouds keeping the sun off our heads. In town many houses have beautiful stone walls around the perimeter, they are beautifully built and look like they don’t even have any cement or mortar gluing them together. The curbs along the sidewalk are really cool too, all made of beautiful granite. It’s great how they use the resources within the mountain o beautify their town. Everyone here is friendly and customers at the grocery store would stop and ask questions about our hike. One guy stopped by and asked if there was anything at all he could do for us or get for us. We wished he had asked that question in an hour, then he could have driven us to the trailhead!!!!! Once back on the trail, the day was suddenly filled with humidity to the point where Hillbilly’s glasses were fogged over. The climb out of town was very long and filled with sloppy black mud that sucked at your shoes and poles. In many places rocks were placed where you could step on them to avoid the mud somewhat. We had one particular area where we were climbing up an entire hillside of rocks. We were rewarded greatly though with the most beautiful view at a place covered with flat rock. It would have made a fabulous lunch spot. After many miles of seeing no more orange newts I saw another today, the little guy was very active and appeared to be struggling to get off the trail. We finally made it to our shelter which was thankfully not far off the trail tonight with plenty of running water nearby in a beautiful creek. Skully and I choose to stay in the shelter itself with one other hiker. Several others showed up but they all tented. In the eaves of the shelter there was a bird nest with baby birds!TOTAL TRAIL MILES TODAY: 9TOTAL TRAIL MILES: 481
Day 47, Monday July 26Went to bed with damp clothes hanging up to hopefully dry out, woke up to 97% humidity and wet clothes. Good grief!!! It was a beautiful hike out with mist filling the air. First thing we did was climb Bear Mountain which was strewn with tons of rocks but it really wasn’t hard.  The enormous, somewhat flat boulders were slightly humped in the middle making it appear as if we were walking on the spine of the earth. As we got closer to the top the landscape felt almost desert-like with scraggy bushes and short trees with pine needles and thick gnarly branches. Coming down the mountain was much more difficult. The spiny boulders had been replaced with a mound of boulders in every shape and size thrown down the the side of the mountain helter skelter. This away and That Way clicked and clacked as I let them drop into every crack and crevice I could find in order to lean into them and keep myself upright. The trail took us down to the river and transformed into a pine needle cushioned pathway with absolutely breathtaking views of the multiple waterfalls surrounded by tall pines. It was gorgeous! We stopped for lunch at the top of the ledges and spread out a couple of items to dry in the sun. It would have been a great view if there hadn’t been so much haze in the air from the high humidity. Despite the view being muted it was still a really cool spot to look down through the hazy valley and see all the farmland and farmhouses below. All along the trail we saw great campsites with pine needles padding the ground. Connecticut trails were very well marked and maintained, looks like the trails in Massachusetts will provide great views but the trails are poorly marked so far. It’s interesting because down by the river and other lower elevation points you have a perfect mountain scene with huge pines, several creeks and soft pine needle paths; up at the higher elevations I am reminded more of a desert type vegetation. It’s mind boggling to think many of the wonderful views I’m experiencing can only be seen by walking to where I’m at, driving here isn’t an option because there isn’t a way to drive up the mountain and see what I’m seeing. After lunch we walked along a rocky ledge on the ridge that went on for a great distance, all across the ridge were gorgeous views and thankfully a wonderful breeze washing over my sweat soaked skin. We were back to small, stubby pine trees and more blueberry bushes with only a handful of ripe berries. A large, black butterfly followed us for quite a ways, darting in and out of the trees and bushes. As we dropped back down we were getting very low on water and were relieved to find a happy little spring bubbling out of the earth right in the middle of the trail. The water was cold and delicious! Today we climbed three mountain, Bear, Race, and Everett Mountains. At the top of Everett there were concrete pillars where a fire tower used to stand. We descended our final mountain of the day and headed to our shelter for the night. The shelter was great and with the upstairs loft area provided space for ten hikers. Most nights in the shelters there have not been that many other hikers, maybe just a couple, but last night and tonight there have been about 8 additional young hikers. I don’t know where they are all coming from all of a sudden. They are all fun though and made for an enjoyable evening. TOTAL TRAIL MILES TODAY: 8.9TOTAL TRAIL MILES: 489.9
Day 48, Tuesday July 27Today is town day and I cant wait to wash clothes and myself. I also need to resupply my food as I’m almost out of everything. Perfect timing, you don’t want to come into town with a bunch of food, means you’ve been carrying too much which equates to too much weight. We took off this morning and started with a somewhat steep incline but not too bad. The rocks here are very interesting and textured making them easier to get traction when walking on them and interesting to look at. Some resemble a tree because the ripples in the stone resemble the texture of bark. Others sport beautiful pieces of white granite  trapped among the sea of grey. The rocks along this section are once again pieces of the earths spine erupting from the earth. After an uphill there is always a downhill. This one was steep and not surprisingly very rocky. The last part of the descent was peppered with stone steps leading to the bottom. It was a gorgeous forest the trail dumped us into. The forest was  flat and open with giant pine trees; all lower branches gone and only the upper beaches green creating an umbrella over the vegetation. There was a huge rock sitting solitary under the trees as if it was keeping watch. The trail in this area was off of a postcard, perfectly manicured with few roots and rocks , flat and level surrounded by tall tall trees and scattered ferns.  We left the forest and walked out into an open meadow. Meadows are an easy walk but are also open and out from under the trees where there is no shade and the sun beats down on your head. We passed by a farm in the distance where large, fat sheep were grazing on the hill. The meadow also surprised us with all the mud. This was juicy mud. There are several kinds of mud I’ve encountered on this trek. There is the juicy mud meaning more water than mud, drying out mud where you only sink a minor amount, gooey mud which will try to suck on the shoe off your foot or deceptive mud which looks thick and muddy but not deep but in reality sucks your walking pole down a couple of feet. Of course mud comes in all shades of brown from brown to almost black. Here on the trail most of my mud encounters have been with the dark black kind. We left the meadow and re-entered the forest. It was a gorgeous forest and would have made a great place for a snack but it was a forest swamp!  Mosquitoes were so thick you couldn’t even think off sitting down. We would walk on dry land then without warning we were crossing sloshy, muddy messes. In some place there were boards placed for walkways and in others not. We crossed over an odd shaped small bridge over the top of stagnant water. The water was greasy looking, an odd reddish-brown tint to it and bugs skimming through the surface. I was very happy I didn’t need water. This hike would have been glorious if I hadn’t been in such a hurry to escape the madness of the bugs. As we were about to come to the road near where we were hoping to get a shuttle to the hotel we could smell burgers being grilled. As we left the forest there was an amazing structure made with a few long stripped trees and a tarp. Under the tarp were chairs and snacks and hamburgers and hotdogs hotdogs for the thru-hikers! As always I felt gratefully blessed. To make it even better, one of the guys helping with this trail magic offered to drive us to the motel. Turns out a few church groups working together are the ones providing this for us. They do it every day except Sunday for 16 weeks! We were dropped off at the Travel Lodge where we were able to get showered, do laundry and lay out all our stuff to air out. I even washed my shoes in my sink to try to get rid of some stench. To dry them out I needed a sunny spot. My room was on the second floor with a little balcony attached and the length of the building. On that balcony hung the motel sign, the only obvious place near me the sun was shining. So, like the true hiker trash I’ve become my shoes went on top of the hotel sign to dry out! Skully and I walked over to the local Mexican restaurant and at long last I had Mexican food, fajitas and a margarita! I sit here in bed with my feet propped up getting caught up on my journal. TOTAL TRAIL MILES TODAY: 8.0TOTAL TRAIL MILES: 497.9","

WhichWay,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641535,"I am using tidbits to write about things I may have forgotten in my journal or random thoughts. 

The odd items found along the trail leaves much to the imagination. I have found an almost brand new pair of hiking boots sitting iron a rock next to the trail, a single moldy boot, a pair of camp shoes, one lone shoe hanging from a tree, a couple of shirts at different times, men’s underwear, shorts and a pair of pants. One of the oddest and somewhat unnerving finds was an abandoned tent with the fly half on and off and a cooking pot and stove still inside. Each of these articles carry a story that will never be told. 
The boulders in Connecticut are gorgeous, many of the large beasts appear to be a blue, green color. I believe in large part due to the lichen and moss covering them but also just the stone itself. I think honk they are just beautiful. 
There are very small bright orange mushrooms dotting the forest floor here and there. Once in a great while one will stand completely alone laying close to the ground, perfectly round and disguise itself as a perfect orange M&M!
Slipping and falling on these rocks isn’t fun at all and at times downright scary. However, when you can avoid a fall or trip it can be extremely funny to those watching but for myself, I am always in awe on how I’ve saved myself again. The sudden jerks and fancy footwork while executing continuous forward motion can never be re-enacted. That is a sad thing because if any of my ‘don’t fall’ moves could be memorized and practiced I feel I could start a new dance style. 
The trails in Connecticut and their signs we fantastic. Trails are well maintained, beautiful and offer great views. They also have plenty of fresh white blazes in obvious places and signs for other trails, shelters, water sources and viewpoints are nicely crafted from wood and painted in a soft green. 
Many times I’m asked if I’m having a blast or having fun. That is somewhat a difficult question to answer. I definitely wouldn’t classify what I'm doing as fun or having a blast. What I’m doing is the hardest thing I’ve ever done. Mentally I need to get through how dirty I always am, or putting on damp dirty clothes almost every morning, or so hot, hungry, or thirsty without the energy to fix the situation. But when I start walking and see the world in only the way a person can if they are on foot, when I climb or descend an area so ominous I can’t believe I actually succeeded, when I eat berries cultivated by the wild and sit by the running stream I just filtered water from, I am content and confident and filled with peace. I do have fun when in town or hanging out with other hikers or sitting at a trail magic spot. This journey is so multifaceted it is hard for o describe actually what kind of time I’m having!
Every day for over a week, high above the city, I walk along and hear a lawnmower doing its job far below in the city somewhere. It sounds exactly like the same mower every day, mowing along as I hike above it. Crazy now just thinking I hear a mower every day and that sounds travel up the mountain so easily.
I always thought the sun came up and woke up all the birds. Being out here however, I’ve learned it is the birds themselves waking up the sun!!!
I wanted to let everyone know that Deb Abbott has volunteered to edit my entries as time allows. Sometimes my fat fingers typing away on this phone, combined with how tired I am at night when creating my journal entries causes some very odd errors. Thank you Deb!!!  (You are so welcome Mary, sometimes I think I should leave in your 'errors' as they make for funny stories.  Mostly just fixing the calendar dates, you are doing a wonderful job.  This is such an interesting journal.  Thank you for letting me be a small part of your adventure, hugs Deb)","

WhichWay,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641934,"Day 49, Wednesday July 28 - Woke until a little before six but went back to sleep until a bit after seven. When in town it’s hard to crawl out of bed. One of these days I’m taking a zero in town by myself and sleeping the morning away!!! I got another great shower, rubbed cheap hotel lotion on my dry, peeling legs and met Skully for breakfast at a small cafe across the road. I had a really great omelette and my first coffee in awhile in addition to some wonderful GF toast. After breakfast we walked over to the grocery store for resupply. I bought mainly for four days but some items such as Breakfast Essentials comes in larger quantities so you end up with too much food in some categories which sadly adds to the weight you carry. My one splurge was a small jar of honey which weighs too much but hopefully I’ll eat quickly at breakfast and on my peanut butter roll ups. The store also has my GF wraps so I bought two packages of those. It is amazing how much food I’ve eaten and still my pants are loose. Go figure! After packing up our food bags and reloading our packs we headed to the local chocolate and ice cream store. They were chock full of great chocolates where I got some dark chocolate covered coffee beans but their ice cream selection was mainly soft serve so we went to the grocery store and bought some ice cream there; our ride to the trail head was going to pick us up there anyway.  Joe was our shuttle driver; a retired man with a gentle smile. He shuttles hikers for a donation and also leaves caches of water at a couple of road crossings. The day was beautiful with blue skies and perfect white clouds which were helping to keep the sun of us directly. The first mile and a half was fairly flat and relatively easy. We walked in and out of the forest and corn fields. This whole section was a muddy mess though and had been closed due to flooding up to a couple of days ago. I had washed my shoes off at the hotel in the sink to get rid of excess mud and stench but now they were muddy again, just not as bad. Today was a short mileage day due to being in town. We had lots of uphills and downs but the weather wasn’t too hot and I didn’t even need much water. There were a few nice streams we crossed which would have been excellent sources but I just didn’t need more and water is certainly one of the heavier items a backpacker carries. One stream we crossed was just beautiful and it would have been a great stopping spot for the night if it had been later. The water here flowed crisp and clean over a jumble of rocks. There was a beautiful little bridge crossing to the other side, quite a postcard image. What really transformed this area however were the magnificent rock formations. Narrow boulders stood on edge about three feet apart in the middle of the stream and the river ran between the boulders cascading down the rocks laying within the boulder creating miniature waterfalls. It was such a peaceful spot. Another wonderful sight today among the forest was a huge flat boulder up on the summit. This spot was especially nice because you had a fantastic, clear view of the valley below and the mountains we would soon be climbing, but best of all, the mosquitoes weren’t too bad here. After our little break on the rock plateau it was only a little more than 2 1/2 miles to the shelter we would be staying at tonight. A couple of blueberry bushes still had some ripe berries ready for picking and we did! We met up with another hiker who was also headed to the shelter we were and told us rain was expected for tomorrow. Hopefully Mr Weather Man will be wrong. But in case he isn’t I’m sleeping in the shelter to avoid packing up in the rain in the morning. The shelter itself was exceptional and similar to the one we stayed in recently. It was open with two generously sized bunk bed units on opposite side walls. Upstairs there was a loft area and a couple of skylights which help immensely with providing a little light. Most shelters have low ceilings and are dark. Sadly though, sleeping in the shelter in this neck of the woods meant wearing my bug net to bed and keeping covered, the mosquitoes are that bad! Several hikers poured into this shelter area again tonight. I think we must be in the middle of what’s called a hiker bubble. Most set up tents however rather than being in the shelter itself. Early to bed tonight to keep from being eaten alive, the best recourse is cover up. As I write this those blood thirsty vampires are buzzing around my bug net angry at being fenced out.

Day 50, Thursday July 29 - Woke up to no rain this morning but it is on its way. The plan is to make it to another shelter before it hits. Breakfast this morning was something new I’m trying. I mixed up a vanilla Carnation Breakfast Essentials drink and poured in Kind cereal, it was great! I think actually better for me that instant oatmeal. The water I have right now came from the creek at the campsite and is literally the color of iced tea even after being filtered. I was nervous as to how it was going to taste but it was actually just fine. With my pack covered in preparation for the upcoming rain we made the small climb out from the shelter. Right away I encountered the most beautiful wall of rocks covered in thick blankets of bright green moss. Looking down from where we were standing I could see we were standing on the edge of a sheer drop. Not long after we got started Skully slipped and fell, the weight of his backpack threatening to pull him over into a roll which would have escalated his movement down the slope he was on. I watched helplessly as he thankfully was able to stop his momentum and eventually right himself. The low areas we were hiking in continued to be swampy and full of mud. The mud was in varying amounts of squishiness. It went from somewhat firm to outright shoe sucking wetness. There were some rocks here and there but not enough rocks to save your shoes from stepping off onto a place where the mud was less firm than you thought. In some places This Way and That Way sunk below the surface at least two feet. Aside from the muddy, swampy feeling the scenery was gorgeous. Rocks covered in moss was the theme of the day accompanied by trees growing on top of boulders. The scene the tree sprouting boulders creates will never stop amazing me; I simply can’t fathom how they survive. One stream we came to was a combination mountain stream and Everglades swamp. The water was clear and beautiful as it rushed over and through the rocks; all around the edges and back as far as we could see were water plants and cattails taller than me. The water sources today were varied in appearance. Some of the water was crystal clear and inviting, some were filled with more ‘iced tea’ and others were actually orange. Thankfully I wasn’t desperate enough to need the orange water! An uphill climb shortly after gave us a younger forest full of skinny trees and lots of underbrush. Another view brought us to a tangled looking forest, old vines twisted around trees both standing and laying dead. The vines continued their crawl across the ground like spineless animals with a hundred arms searching for something to do entangle.  From the forest we quickly re-entered the swamp this time boards had once again been place on blocks attempting to provide hikers a bit of relief over the mud. It’s a great idea but trail maintainers don’t update boards often enough and many act as teeter totters or are half rotten and sunk partially into the mud soon to be reclaimed by the forest. Of course would be swamps only provide more mosquitoes! Along one edge of the swamp we came across a field to our left filled with interestingly marked cows. I was hopeful we would turn into the field and get away from the mud but that was not  to be today. It is so crazy how fast the terrain changes here, as quickly as turning a page in a child’s story book. We made a climb up and up to a place called The Ledges. I had heard it mentioned before and noted in a book. I expected a long row of ledges and cliffs with a great overlook the whole way. The view was stupendous of the valley below but it was just a very small area in comparison to what I had built up in my mind. I would have loved to sit on the ledge enjoying the view with my lunch but the rain was coming and I wanted to get to the shelter. We walked by a beautiful large pond a little over a mile from the shelter and noticed all the raindrops bouncing off the surface. The trees had provided enough cover to keep us dry when the rain started so we were oblivious. The visual however prompted us to move faster and as fast as we were moving the rain got stronger. Thankfully we arrived just before the clouds really opened up. Sadly, another short mileage day but thankfully our gear was dry even though our clothes were pretty damp from the humidity and sweat. I got changed into some dry clothes and ate some lunch. For lunch I had GF tortillas got in town yesterday spread with peanut butter and honey. One wrap I spiced up with some trail mix. The shelter thankfully has a tall ceiling so it feels open which is an important factor when two people are going to be stuck in it for hours with nothing much to do but eat food and write journal entries!! Im so glad I got a food resupply yesterday or the food part of this afternoon and evening would be very boring. As it got towards evening Too Damn Short showed up and joined us in the shelter. I felt so bad for her, she had been caught in the storm and was soaked to the skin. On too of that she had fallen in the mud and her legs and clothes were caked. She joined us in the shelter and after ‘chores’ it didn’t take her long to fall sound asleep. Two other hikers showed up shortly after her but they opted to tent. The next two days are supposed to be great weather wise and I'm looking forward to them.

Day 51, Friday July 30 - During the night it rained and stormed like no other!! I was very thankful we had opted to stay in the shelter instead of tenting. We packed up our gear damp from the air being so moist, put on damp clothes and headed out to hike. It was almost a half mile out to the trail and the ground was sloppy and the rocks slick. The air was misty and the greenery a brilliant, bright green which stood out against the dark earth. Once we got moving we warmed up quickly. I had left my pack cover on in case of rain, so it could dry out but also so I could wear the sleeves and keep in some body heat. All throughout the day I saw the orange newts again!!!! I haven’t seen any for weeks and today we counted over 28. I just love those little guys. They start out as tadpoles, move to the land for two years then return to the water where they turn green. They seem so gentle and sweet. I love the forests more and more the further north we go, they remind me of some of the forests in the west with their tall pines and firs. Some of the paths are just beautiful and so cushy you would think you were walking on carpet. Mushrooms were prolific today, some I saw were even a dark black in color. We had all kinds of trail surfaces today. We would literally go from hard packed dirt to the finest of sand. Of course there are the rocks and a couple of boulder scrambles. The dirt for miles appeared to have handfuls of glitter sprinkled all over it. We walked through some meadows again today and one particularly swampy area where boards and wonderful boardwalks had been built to keep you above the swampy mess below. However, due to last night’s storm there was so much water some of the boards were below the water surface and we slipped around in water to our shins in some places. The biggest detriment though was still the mud. Mud in the trail so thick and deep you sunk to the tops of your shoes, hiking poles sunk three feet, rocks for avoiding some mud were buried. It was a sight! At first we kept trying to avoid the worst of it but judging the depth of mud isn’t always easy and we didn’t always win. It got so bad that when we came to one of many creek crossings we just waded in to clean the mud off our shoes. To add to the muck, many places along the trail had become creeks after the storm and we would walk a distance on the trail on which use to be a dry creek bed. Overall the day was perfect for hiking due to the lower temperature and semi cloudy sky. The views from the top of the mountain were beautiful too. There is an iconic cabin/campground along a large pond you can stay at called Upper Goose Pond Cabin. Normally several campers can bunk in the cabin and others can tent; however, due to COVID they only allow four in the bunkhouse now but everyone can still hang out in the small front room.  Makes no sense really but that’s the rule. It was a beautiful little two story red cabin with a front porch and back are with picnic tables for cooking and dish washing. Skully decided not to come to the cabin/campsite as he didn’t want to deal with so many people and was wanting some solitude so he moved on. I got there too late to garner one of the bunks but was fine setting up my tent.  I got to know more really great hikers, Gourmet, TripleT, HocusPocus, Butter and several others whose names I can’t recall. We sat at the picnic table making dinner then some of us went inside and sat in the front room sharing stories. It’s a very basic cabin, no electricity or running water. It has the simplest of kitchens for the caretaker and a small front room with fireplace. Upstairs is an open room with bunks, the caretaker’s space is behind the curtain. It seemed odd not having Skully around this evening but out here it is ever changing. I will miss him but am also looking forward to perhaps more reflective time and opportunities for me to be able to choose when and where I take my breaks and how far I hike. I will also be meeting a whole new group of hikers and perhaps catching up to old friends.

Day 52, Saturday July 31 - Beautiful morning to wake up to; the air was crisp and the air clear. I packed up my tent and backpack and headed over to the picnic table where campers were waiting for coffee and pancakes compliments of the cabin. It was a great group of hikers, all positive, fun people. I chatted quite awhile with a really nice couple who were only doing an overnight camp and would be leaving from their to go pick up their son who was also doing a camp with the Boy Scouts somewhere. They were hiking with their little dog Michael who must have only weighed five pound. She was originally from Poland and has been in the states over twenty years but still has a thick accent. We got to talking the state of the world and it was refreshing that they are on the same page I am. She has PTSD with the way things are going because she said it reminds her so much on every level as to what she lived through in Poland. They even gifted me a yummy snack. The caretaker brought out pancakes which were not GF but after over ten years of being GF. I couldn’t resist especially since one was of blueberry. Unfortunately they did catch up with me later in the day when by stomach turned into a boiling barrel of gas and my lower abdomen burned but they were worth it!! It was a beautiful hike out of the cabin and into the woods. There was mud but not too bad as bad as yesterday. There were a few more of the newts but not near as many as yesterday either. The trail was relatively flat with not much change in the terrain. Mostly it was open forest with very tall trees. There was one area where ferns took over the ground. Halfway through I landed on a road and by turning right and going a very short distance I was rewarded with the cookie lady! It is a blueberry farm where they also cater to hikers. The farm was adorable with a gaily painted picnic table, a fun old bus all decorated and hikers sitting on top of, a hammock, a plane hanger where you could sleep on a bunk and a sitting area. You could charge your stuff on porch as well when you arrived and she offers drinks; mine was such delicious hibiscus lemonade, great choice! She also had home made chocolate chip cookies. For the refreshments you could make a donation or spend a little time picking a few blueberries. If you picked a whole bucket you got a free meal. One guy actually did that and was rewarded with two fat sausages, eggs and toast. Several people were there when I arrived but had been there awhile and getting ready to head out. I spread out my tent footprint to dry while charging my phone and charging block. I ate my lunch and drank my absolutely delicious lemonade. I picked blueberries for about twenty minutes then packed up and headed out. It was later than I wanted to start a six mile trek into the shelter but I knew I could do it. I did but parts were a bit sketchy and I worried about it getting dark before getting to the shelter but I made it after hiking through mud and more mud, boulder scrambles and creeks running directly over the trail. I did lose the white blaze once but not for long. I don’t care how many miles you have or haven’t hiked but backtracking for even .2 miles is frustrating especially at the end of the day. I finally got close to the turn off for the shelter and could hear a concert coming from the town below clear as day. I thought we would be able to hear it from the shelter but we couldn’t. When I hiked in he .2 miles on the spur trail I could see a fire in the fire pit going and it was a delightful sight!! This was only my second fire at a shelter, the first I built myself early on in my hike. Hocus Pocus was there, Skully and a few others. After camp chores and dinner it was already getting late. The shelter was one of the really nice newer ones with a loft and two sets of bunkbeds. I got one of the upper bunks as it was the only one left. By the time we all got in our sleeping bags all bunks and the loft were full with a few hikers in the tent sites. It’s going to be in the mid forties tonight so I am in my sleeping bag instead of just using it for a quilt. Here’s hoping I stay toasty and warm!

Day 53, Sunday August 1 -  Woke up to a chilly morning, hard to put cold clothes back on. Hocus Pocus and I decided to hike out together. She’s very nice and 28, she works during the winter months at Yosemite. There was a slight climb out but overall an easy hike straight into the town of Dalton. We walked to the community center where you can get a free shower. Gourmet was there already; she and TripleT had camped last night at this campsite in this guys yard the night before. The guy is super nice and has been allowing hikers to camp in his yard the last 42 years. Every morning he puts out fresh fruit and donuts. He allows hikers to charge phones on his porch and provides a picnic table for their use. Gourmet invited us to join her and TripleT for breakfast across the street from the community center. It was a very simple but delicious breakfast. I had an omelette full of vegetables, bacon and cheese along with fried potatoes and a full glass of orange juice. Back on the trail again through the forest we went. At one point for no apparent reason there was the finest of white sand scattered here and there, it almost looked like snow. It was the oddest thing to see and no guess as to where it had come from or why. I saw a lot more sparkly glitter in the dirt today along with many more pieces of quartz, some of the pieces are quite large now, some with veins of pink. The rock heading north is much more varied in color and type. After a little more than five miles the trail once again took us straight through another town, the town of Cheshire. There was a Dollar Tree along the way so we stopped there for more food. The next part of the day we were threatened by rain so we put on our pack covers in preparation for it. The mountain we climbed on the way to the shelter is Mt. Greylock, the highest spot in Massachusetts. We will climb half today and summit tomorrow. The first part of the trail was steep tapering off but it got very steep for at least two miles. We climbed over boulders and roots and crossed several streams. The trail was  back to being a pine covered trail which was cushy like carpet   The rain only hit us for about ten minutes and really wasn’t bad but my clothes were soaked anyway due to sweating so hard while climbing the mountain. I’m so thankful it wasn’t hot out! The sky was full of clouds and it was getting late, the dwindling light making it hard to see the rocks and roots. The last half mile to the shelter was extremely steep and we were both exhausted as we moved to the shelter access trail and arrived at the shelter after 8 in the faltering light. The shelter was for ten people and we made numbers 5 & 6 and were able to garner a bunk each. The others already at the shelter were Butter, Scribe, SideWinder and Strider. We set out our stuff quickly so we could fix dinner, I was so very hungry! It was a long but good day. Tomorrow we summit!

Day 54, Monday August 2 - I had hung my clothes under the roofed area above the picnic table last night because there was a good breeze and I was hoping they would dry out. Sadly they were wetter this morning than they were when I hung them up, just too much moisture in the air. Hocus Pocus and I left camp and headed out to summit Mt. Greylock. The shelter was about 2/3rds of the way up the mountain so we weren’t looking at a long climb but we thought it would be steep. It was but not anywhere near as steep as the climb was last night. The morning was very cloudy and breezy and with my wet clothes I was a bit chilly which was far better than being crazy hot because I knew once I was moving for a short period I would warm up. After climbing for a bit I did warm up but not dry out as the air was still damp and of course the ever present perspiration when climbing adds to wet clothing. It really is amazing to me how much water can leach out of your skin!!! Mt. Greylock is the highest mountain in Massachusetts and has a very large Veterans War Memorial on top. The last of the climb up the mountain was very steep and filled with rocks to traipse over. I honestly don’t mind the huge rock climbing, they are easier on your feet than the smaller ones which tend to bruise your feet; the larger ones simply require more mental effort so you don’t see so wrong and fall. In that way they are tiring and of course take longer to go over. Unfortunately the air was filled with mist and fog making all views invisible including half the memorial. Getting closer to the memorial you could view it much better and it really was impressive in its height and simplicity of structure. We luckily could go inside and enjoyed a break from the cool wind. The ceiling was domed and beautifully done with gold work. There wasn’t a way unfortunately to climb to the top of the tower so we moved on. The atmosphere outside felt mystical and like something out of a Tolkien novel. The lodge is now closed on Monday and Tuesday’s so we weren’t able to see inside or get a hot cup of coffee. We did go into the ski shack to get warmed up and eat a snack and take a moment to call the Catamount hotel so I could get a reservation. Back on the trail we went downhill and crossed several streams. Birch trees were everywhere and odd whitish grey bark lay in sheets on the ground resembling paper. Ferns were prominent throughout the forest along with a lot of other low laying bushes. I found the downed logs covered in luminescent green, velvety moss exceptionally beautiful. We came to a nice view after climbing again and Sidewinder and Strider were there getting ready to enjoy lunch on the rock in the sun. I decided to join them and Hocus Pocus moved on to have lunch later. The sun had burned off the mist by now and we had a beautiful view while eating our lunch and having my poncho dry out as it lay on a rock. After I ate I took off back down the trail. I hiked alone for a couple of miles but when I stopped at a stream to get water SideWinder and Strider showed up and we ended up hiking together the rest of the day. They were great company. All along with the path today were tiny tiny little brownish red frogs. When I say tiny they were about the size of my pinky fingernail. They just were hopping around on the path and unfortunately I’m sure I must have squashed a couple because you could hardly see them. At first I thought they were just little spiders, that’s how little they were. There was a gorgeous stream on our right that stayed with us for over a mile. It was just beautiful, wide and the clearest water I have seen. The stream was tumbling over rocks and created waterfalls in several places. All too soon we were headed uphill again and away from the stream. It seems as if we were constantly going up and down and wading through all kinds of thick black mud. At one point we came to a part of the forest where there had been a controlled burn. All the trees were blackened and a faint scent of fire was in the air. The trail took us straight through the residential section of another little town. In one yard there was a cooler with trail magic. Inside the cooler were a few sodas and pudding cups. The three of us enjoyed a soda then moved on. On our way out of town we passed over a bridge which had been painted with lots of handprints all against a white background. I’m assuming a local grade school made this bridge their art project and it turned out really cool. Our last major climb was straight uphill and a boulder scramble. Shortly after that we came to the ‘Welcome to Vermont’ sign!!! Another state down!!!! The shelter we were headed to was much smaller than the one we were at last night, nobody had really passed us all day so we were hoping there would be space. We were shocked we when showed up and the shelter was full and tents up everywhere! This part of the AT shares the trail for awhile with the Long Trail so as a result some of the hikers were from that trail in addition to many AT hikers. I found a nice spot to set up my tent then joined some of the hikers around the wonderful fire someone had built. It was dark by the time I was done eating and I made my way back to my tent and cozy sleeping bag. I really love my sleeping bag and tent!

Day 55, Tuesday August 3 - Today I hiked out with Hocus Pocus, we both have reservations at the Catamount hotel and will be picked up at a road crossing. I have been toying more and more with the idea of going home. I will go into more detail on that in my newest ‘Thoughts’ document. Anyway, that was on my mind for most of the 12 mile hike up and down the mountain. The forest today seemed to stay the same most of the hike today, lots of low growing plants and tall but skinny trees. I don’t know if the forest really didn’t change as much today or if my mind was on other things. The mud was still thick and sloppy in many areas on the trail but you could see where is was beginning to dry out some on the edges. Hunting for a stone to put your foot on versus sinking into the mud was the game with every step. It’s amazing how well you adapt to this game and honestly how I didn’t become annoyed when I lost the game and my foot was sunk below the surface, better luck next time!! Hocus Pocus stopped along the way to apply bug spray and do a couple of other things so I moved on and we agreed to meet at the top of the mountain two miles before our pick up spot where we would have cell service and could call the hotel and give them a heads up. I breathed in the smell of the forest as I hiked along, today it smelled of pine needles and spices and the water in the creeks ran clear and abundant. Hocus Pocus caught up to me about 15 minutes after I reached our meeting place and together we continued to hike toward the road crossing. The last mile and a half down to our road was crazy. The trail became intensely steep and the entire path was a dump of huge boulders to carefully walk down. In a few places boulders had been used as steps but they were uneven in size and spacing. The walk down was extremely challenging but fun. We made it to the road where a SOBO hiker was also waiting for his ride to the same hotel. He updated us on what was ahead. Not surprising due to the fact we were now in Vermont which is famous for its mud, lots and lots more sloppy mud ahead! He also said in all of July there had only been four sunny days. Covid is also curtailing work for stay at the huts and in order to garner one of the stealth camping spots you need to hike at odd hours. Our ride to the Catamount hotel in Bennington arrived and we were taken to this iconic hiker motel. It was such a great deal. For $55.00 plus tax you got a clean room with coffee pot and tv, and for another $5.00 they wash and dry your laundry and provide loaner clothes. The hotel is old but well maintained and a close walk to town. The bathroom toilet is pink which was popular back in the day and reminds me of my grandmother’s bathroom with pink tile. After showering, putting on loaner clothes and taking my clothes to be washed I walked to town and enjoyed dinner at a local brewery and pub. My evening was filled with emotion as I worked through my decision to head home.

WhichWay,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641935,"Day 49, Wednesday July 28 - Woke until a little before six but went back to sleep until a bit after seven. When in town it’s hard to crawl out of bed. One of these days I’m taking a zero in town by myself and sleeping the morning away!!! I got another great shower, rubbed cheap hotel lotion on my dry, peeling legs and met Skully for breakfast at a small cafe across the road. I had a really great omelette and my first coffee in awhile in addition to some wonderful GF toast. After breakfast we walked over to the grocery store for resupply. I bought mainly for four days but some items such as Breakfast Essentials comes in larger quantities so you end up with too much food in some categories which sadly adds to the weight you carry. My one splurge was a small jar of honey which weighs too much but hopefully I’ll eat quickly at breakfast and on my peanut butter roll ups. The store also has my GF wraps so I bought two packages of those. It is amazing how much food I’ve eaten and still my pants are loose. Go figure! After packing up our food bags and reloading our packs we headed to the local chocolate and ice cream store. They were chock full of great chocolates where I got some dark chocolate covered coffee beans but their ice cream selection was mainly soft serve so we went to the grocery store and bought some ice cream there; our ride to the trail head was going to pick us up there anyway.  Joe was our shuttle driver; a retired man with a gentle smile. He shuttles hikers for a donation and also leaves caches of water at a couple of road crossings. The day was beautiful with blue skies and perfect white clouds which were helping to keep the sun of us directly. The first mile and a half was fairly flat and relatively easy. We walked in and out of the forest and corn fields. This whole section was a muddy mess though and had been closed due to flooding up to a couple of days ago. I had washed my shoes off at the hotel in the sink to get rid of excess mud and stench but now they were muddy again, just not as bad. Today was a short mileage day due to being in town. We had lots of uphills and downs but the weather wasn’t too hot and I didn’t even need much water. There were a few nice streams we crossed which would have been excellent sources but I just didn’t need more and water is certainly one of the heavier items a backpacker carries. One stream we crossed was just beautiful and it would have been a great stopping spot for the night if it had been later. The water here flowed crisp and clean over a jumble of rocks. There was a beautiful little bridge crossing to the other side, quite a postcard image. What really transformed this area however were the magnificent rock formations. Narrow boulders stood on edge about three feet apart in the middle of the stream and the river ran between the boulders cascading down the rocks laying within the boulder creating miniature waterfalls. It was such a peaceful spot. Another wonderful sight today among the forest was a huge flat boulder up on the summit. This spot was especially nice because you had a fantastic, clear view of the valley below and the mountains we would soon be climbing, but best of all, the mosquitoes weren’t too bad here. After our little break on the rock plateau it was only a little more than 2 1/2 miles to the shelter we would be staying at tonight. A couple of blueberry bushes still had some ripe berries ready for picking and we did! We met up with another hiker who was also headed to the shelter we were and told us rain was expected for tomorrow. Hopefully Mr Weather Man will be wrong. But in case he isn’t I’m sleeping in the shelter to avoid packing up in the rain in the morning. The shelter itself was exceptional and similar to the one we stayed in recently. It was open with two generously sized bunk bed units on opposite side walls. Upstairs there was a loft area and a couple of skylights which help immensely with providing a little light. Most shelters have low ceilings and are dark. Sadly though, sleeping in the shelter in this neck of the woods meant wearing my bug net to bed and keeping covered, the mosquitoes are that bad! Several hikers poured into this shelter area again tonight. I think we must be in the middle of what’s called a hiker bubble. Most set up tents however rather than being in the shelter itself. Early to bed tonight to keep from being eaten alive, the best recourse is cover up. As I write this those blood thirsty vampires are buzzing around my bug net angry at being fenced out.

Day 50, Thursday July 29 - Woke up to no rain this morning but it is on its way. The plan is to make it to another shelter before it hits. Breakfast this morning was something new I’m trying. I mixed up a vanilla Carnation Breakfast Essentials drink and poured in Kind cereal, it was great! I think actually better for me that instant oatmeal. The water I have right now came from the creek at the campsite and is literally the color of iced tea even after being filtered. I was nervous as to how it was going to taste but it was actually just fine. With my pack covered in preparation for the upcoming rain we made the small climb out from the shelter. Right away I encountered the most beautiful wall of rocks covered in thick blankets of bright green moss. Looking down from where we were standing I could see we were standing on the edge of a sheer drop. Not long after we got started Skully slipped and fell, the weight of his backpack threatening to pull him over into a roll which would have escalated his movement down the slope he was on. I watched helplessly as he thankfully was able to stop his momentum and eventually right himself. The low areas we were hiking in continued to be swampy and full of mud. The mud was in varying amounts of squishiness. It went from somewhat firm to outright shoe sucking wetness. There were some rocks here and there but not enough rocks to save your shoes from stepping off onto a place where the mud was less firm than you thought. In some places This Way and That Way sunk below the surface at least two feet. Aside from the muddy, swampy feeling the scenery was gorgeous. Rocks covered in moss was the theme of the day accompanied by trees growing on top of boulders. The scene the tree sprouting boulders creates will never stop amazing me; I simply can’t fathom how they survive. One stream we came to was a combination mountain stream and Everglades swamp. The water was clear and beautiful as it rushed over and through the rocks; all around the edges and back as far as we could see were water plants and cattails taller than me. The water sources today were varied in appearance. Some of the water was crystal clear and inviting, some were filled with more ‘iced tea’ and others were actually orange. Thankfully I wasn’t desperate enough to need the orange water! An uphill climb shortly after gave us a younger forest full of skinny trees and lots of underbrush. Another view brought us to a tangled looking forest, old vines twisted around trees both standing and laying dead. The vines continued their crawl across the ground like spineless animals with a hundred arms searching for something to do entangle.  From the forest we quickly re-entered the swamp this time boards had once again been place on blocks attempting to provide hikers a bit of relief over the mud. It’s a great idea but trail maintainers don’t update boards often enough and many act as teeter totters or are half rotten and sunk partially into the mud soon to be reclaimed by the forest. Of course would be swamps only provide more mosquitoes! Along one edge of the swamp we came across a field to our left filled with interestingly marked cows. I was hopeful we would turn into the field and get away from the mud but that was not  to be today. It is so crazy how fast the terrain changes here, as quickly as turning a page in a child’s story book. We made a climb up and up to a place called The Ledges. I had heard it mentioned before and noted in a book. I expected a long row of ledges and cliffs with a great overlook the whole way. The view was stupendous of the valley below but it was just a very small area in comparison to what I had built up in my mind. I would have loved to sit on the ledge enjoying the view with my lunch but the rain was coming and I wanted to get to the shelter. We walked by a beautiful large pond a little over a mile from the shelter and noticed all the raindrops bouncing off the surface. The trees had provided enough cover to keep us dry when the rain started so we were oblivious. The visual however prompted us to move faster and as fast as we were moving the rain got stronger. Thankfully we arrived just before the clouds really opened up. Sadly, another short mileage day but thankfully our gear was dry even though our clothes were pretty damp from the humidity and sweat. I got changed into some dry clothes and ate some lunch. For lunch I had GF tortillas got in town yesterday spread with peanut butter and honey. One wrap I spiced up with some trail mix. The shelter thankfully has a tall ceiling so it feels open which is an important factor when two people are going to be stuck in it for hours with nothing much to do but eat food and write journal entries!! Im so glad I got a food resupply yesterday or the food part of this afternoon and evening would be very boring. As it got towards evening Too Damn Short showed up and joined us in the shelter. I felt so bad for her, she had been caught in the storm and was soaked to the skin. On too of that she had fallen in the mud and her legs and clothes were caked. She joined us in the shelter and after ‘chores’ it didn’t take her long to fall sound asleep. Two other hikers showed up shortly after her but they opted to tent. The next two days are supposed to be great weather wise and I'm looking forward to them.

Day 51, Friday July 30 - During the night it rained and stormed like no other!! I was very thankful we had opted to stay in the shelter instead of tenting. We packed up our gear damp from the air being so moist, put on damp clothes and headed out to hike. It was almost a half mile out to the trail and the ground was sloppy and the rocks slick. The air was misty and the greenery a brilliant, bright green which stood out against the dark earth. Once we got moving we warmed up quickly. I had left my pack cover on in case of rain, so it could dry out but also so I could wear the sleeves and keep in some body heat. All throughout the day I saw the orange newts again!!!! I haven’t seen any for weeks and today we counted over 28. I just love those little guys. They start out as tadpoles, move to the land for two years then return to the water where they turn green. They seem so gentle and sweet. I love the forests more and more the further north we go, they remind me of some of the forests in the west with their tall pines and firs. Some of the paths are just beautiful and so cushy you would think you were walking on carpet. Mushrooms were prolific today, some I saw were even a dark black in color. We had all kinds of trail surfaces today. We would literally go from hard packed dirt to the finest of sand. Of course there are the rocks and a couple of boulder scrambles. The dirt for miles appeared to have handfuls of glitter sprinkled all over it. We walked through some meadows again today and one particularly swampy area where boards and wonderful boardwalks had been built to keep you above the swampy mess below. However, due to last night’s storm there was so much water some of the boards were below the water surface and we slipped around in water to our shins in some places. The biggest detriment though was still the mud. Mud in the trail so thick and deep you sunk to the tops of your shoes, hiking poles sunk three feet, rocks for avoiding some mud were buried. It was a sight! At first we kept trying to avoid the worst of it but judging the depth of mud isn’t always easy and we didn’t always win. It got so bad that when we came to one of many creek crossings we just waded in to clean the mud off our shoes. To add to the muck, many places along the trail had become creeks after the storm and we would walk a distance on the trail on which use to be a dry creek bed. Overall the day was perfect for hiking due to the lower temperature and semi cloudy sky. The views from the top of the mountain were beautiful too. There is an iconic cabin/campground along a large pond you can stay at called Upper Goose Pond Cabin. Normally several campers can bunk in the cabin and others can tent; however, due to COVID they only allow four in the bunkhouse now but everyone can still hang out in the small front room.  Makes no sense really but that’s the rule. It was a beautiful little two story red cabin with a front porch and back are with picnic tables for cooking and dish washing. Skully decided not to come to the cabin/campsite as he didn’t want to deal with so many people and was wanting some solitude so he moved on. I got there too late to garner one of the bunks but was fine setting up my tent.  I got to know more really great hikers, Gourmet, TripleT, HocusPocus, Butter and several others whose names I can’t recall. We sat at the picnic table making dinner then some of us went inside and sat in the front room sharing stories. It’s a very basic cabin, no electricity or running water. It has the simplest of kitchens for the caretaker and a small front room with fireplace. Upstairs is an open room with bunks, the caretaker’s space is behind the curtain. It seemed odd not having Skully around this evening but out here it is ever changing. I will miss him but am also looking forward to perhaps more reflective time and opportunities for me to be able to choose when and where I take my breaks and how far I hike. I will also be meeting a whole new group of hikers and perhaps catching up to old friends.

Day 52, Saturday July 31 - Beautiful morning to wake up to; the air was crisp and the air clear. I packed up my tent and backpack and headed over to the picnic table where campers were waiting for coffee and pancakes compliments of the cabin. It was a great group of hikers, all positive, fun people. I chatted quite awhile with a really nice couple who were only doing an overnight camp and would be leaving from their to go pick up their son who was also doing a camp with the Boy Scouts somewhere. They were hiking with their little dog Michael who must have only weighed five pound. She was originally from Poland and has been in the states over twenty years but still has a thick accent. We got to talking the state of the world and it was refreshing that they are on the same page I am. She has PTSD with the way things are going because she said it reminds her so much on every level as to what she lived through in Poland. They even gifted me a yummy snack. The caretaker brought out pancakes which were not GF but after over ten years of being GF. I couldn’t resist especially since one was of blueberry. Unfortunately they did catch up with me later in the day when by stomach turned into a boiling barrel of gas and my lower abdomen burned but they were worth it!! It was a beautiful hike out of the cabin and into the woods. There was mud but not too bad as bad as yesterday. There were a few more of the newts but not near as many as yesterday either. The trail was relatively flat with not much change in the terrain. Mostly it was open forest with very tall trees. There was one area where ferns took over the ground. Halfway through I landed on a road and by turning right and going a very short distance I was rewarded with the cookie lady! It is a blueberry farm where they also cater to hikers. The farm was adorable with a gaily painted picnic table, a fun old bus all decorated and hikers sitting on top of, a hammock, a plane hanger where you could sleep on a bunk and a sitting area. You could charge your stuff on porch as well when you arrived and she offers drinks; mine was such delicious hibiscus lemonade, great choice! She also had home made chocolate chip cookies. For the refreshments you could make a donation or spend a little time picking a few blueberries. If you picked a whole bucket you got a free meal. One guy actually did that and was rewarded with two fat sausages, eggs and toast. Several people were there when I arrived but had been there awhile and getting ready to head out. I spread out my tent footprint to dry while charging my phone and charging block. I ate my lunch and drank my absolutely delicious lemonade. I picked blueberries for about twenty minutes then packed up and headed out. It was later than I wanted to start a six mile trek into the shelter but I knew I could do it. I did but parts were a bit sketchy and I worried about it getting dark before getting to the shelter but I made it after hiking through mud and more mud, boulder scrambles and creeks running directly over the trail. I did lose the white blaze once but not for long. I don’t care how many miles you have or haven’t hiked but backtracking for even .2 miles is frustrating especially at the end of the day. I finally got close to the turn off for the shelter and could hear a concert coming from the town below clear as day. I thought we would be able to hear it from the shelter but we couldn’t. When I hiked in he .2 miles on the spur trail I could see a fire in the fire pit going and it was a delightful sight!! This was only my second fire at a shelter, the first I built myself early on in my hike. Hocus Pocus was there, Skully and a few others. After camp chores and dinner it was already getting late. The shelter was one of the really nice newer ones with a loft and two sets of bunkbeds. I got one of the upper bunks as it was the only one left. By the time we all got in our sleeping bags all bunks and the loft were full with a few hikers in the tent sites. It’s going to be in the mid forties tonight so I am in my sleeping bag instead of just using it for a quilt. Here’s hoping I stay toasty and warm!

Day 53, Sunday August 1 -  Woke up to a chilly morning, hard to put cold clothes back on. Hocus Pocus and I decided to hike out together. She’s very nice and 28, she works during the winter months at Yosemite. There was a slight climb out but overall an easy hike straight into the town of Dalton. We walked to the community center where you can get a free shower. Gourmet was there already; she and TripleT had camped last night at this campsite in this guys yard the night before. The guy is super nice and has been allowing hikers to camp in his yard the last 42 years. Every morning he puts out fresh fruit and donuts. He allows hikers to charge phones on his porch and provides a picnic table for their use. Gourmet invited us to join her and TripleT for breakfast across the street from the community center. It was a very simple but delicious breakfast. I had an omelette full of vegetables, bacon and cheese along with fried potatoes and a full glass of orange juice. Back on the trail again through the forest we went. At one point for no apparent reason there was the finest of white sand scattered here and there, it almost looked like snow. It was the oddest thing to see and no guess as to where it had come from or why. I saw a lot more sparkly glitter in the dirt today along with many more pieces of quartz, some of the pieces are quite large now, some with veins of pink. The rock heading north is much more varied in color and type. After a little more than five miles the trail once again took us straight through another town, the town of Cheshire. There was a Dollar Tree along the way so we stopped there for more food. The next part of the day we were threatened by rain so we put on our pack covers in preparation for it. The mountain we climbed on the way to the shelter is Mt. Greylock, the highest spot in Massachusetts. We will climb half today and summit tomorrow. The first part of the trail was steep tapering off but it got very steep for at least two miles. We climbed over boulders and roots and crossed several streams. The trail was  back to being a pine covered trail which was cushy like carpet   The rain only hit us for about ten minutes and really wasn’t bad but my clothes were soaked anyway due to sweating so hard while climbing the mountain. I’m so thankful it wasn’t hot out! The sky was full of clouds and it was getting late, the dwindling light making it hard to see the rocks and roots. The last half mile to the shelter was extremely steep and we were both exhausted as we moved to the shelter access trail and arrived at the shelter after 8 in the faltering light. The shelter was for ten people and we made numbers 5 & 6 and were able to garner a bunk each. The others already at the shelter were Butter, Scribe, SideWinder and Strider. We set out our stuff quickly so we could fix dinner, I was so very hungry! It was a long but good day. Tomorrow we summit!

Day 54, Monday August 2 - I had hung my clothes under the roofed area above the picnic table last night because there was a good breeze and I was hoping they would dry out. Sadly they were wetter this morning than they were when I hung them up, just too much moisture in the air. Hocus Pocus and I left camp and headed out to summit Mt. Greylock. The shelter was about 2/3rds of the way up the mountain so we weren’t looking at a long climb but we thought it would be steep. It was but not anywhere near as steep as the climb was last night. The morning was very cloudy and breezy and with my wet clothes I was a bit chilly which was far better than being crazy hot because I knew once I was moving for a short period I would warm up. After climbing for a bit I did warm up but not dry out as the air was still damp and of course the ever present perspiration when climbing adds to wet clothing. It really is amazing to me how much water can leach out of your skin!!! Mt. Greylock is the highest mountain in Massachusetts and has a very large Veterans War Memorial on top. The last of the climb up the mountain was very steep and filled with rocks to traipse over. I honestly don’t mind the huge rock climbing, they are easier on your feet than the smaller ones which tend to bruise your feet; the larger ones simply require more mental effort so you don’t see so wrong and fall. In that way they are tiring and of course take longer to go over. Unfortunately the air was filled with mist and fog making all views invisible including half the memorial. Getting closer to the memorial you could view it much better and it really was impressive in its height and simplicity of structure. We luckily could go inside and enjoyed a break from the cool wind. The ceiling was domed and beautifully done with gold work. There wasn’t a way unfortunately to climb to the top of the tower so we moved on. The atmosphere outside felt mystical and like something out of a Tolkien novel. The lodge is now closed on Monday and Tuesday’s so we weren’t able to see inside or get a hot cup of coffee. We did go into the ski shack to get warmed up and eat a snack and take a moment to call the Catamount hotel so I could get a reservation. Back on the trail we went downhill and crossed several streams. Birch trees were everywhere and odd whitish grey bark lay in sheets on the ground resembling paper. Ferns were prominent throughout the forest along with a lot of other low laying bushes. I found the downed logs covered in luminescent green, velvety moss exceptionally beautiful. We came to a nice view after climbing again and Sidewinder and Strider were there getting ready to enjoy lunch on the rock in the sun. I decided to join them and Hocus Pocus moved on to have lunch later. The sun had burned off the mist by now and we had a beautiful view while eating our lunch and having my poncho dry out as it lay on a rock. After I ate I took off back down the trail. I hiked alone for a couple of miles but when I stopped at a stream to get water SideWinder and Strider showed up and we ended up hiking together the rest of the day. They were great company. All along with the path today were tiny tiny little brownish red frogs. When I say tiny they were about the size of my pinky fingernail. They just were hopping around on the path and unfortunately I’m sure I must have squashed a couple because you could hardly see them. At first I thought they were just little spiders, that’s how little they were. There was a gorgeous stream on our right that stayed with us for over a mile. It was just beautiful, wide and the clearest water I have seen. The stream was tumbling over rocks and created waterfalls in several places. All too soon we were headed uphill again and away from the stream. It seems as if we were constantly going up and down and wading through all kinds of thick black mud. At one point we came to a part of the forest where there had been a controlled burn. All the trees were blackened and a faint scent of fire was in the air. The trail took us straight through the residential section of another little town. In one yard there was a cooler with trail magic. Inside the cooler were a few sodas and pudding cups. The three of us enjoyed a soda then moved on. On our way out of town we passed over a bridge which had been painted with lots of handprints all against a white background. I’m assuming a local grade school made this bridge their art project and it turned out really cool. Our last major climb was straight uphill and a boulder scramble. Shortly after that we came to the ‘Welcome to Vermont’ sign!!! Another state down!!!! The shelter we were headed to was much smaller than the one we were at last night, nobody had really passed us all day so we were hoping there would be space. We were shocked we when showed up and the shelter was full and tents up everywhere! This part of the AT shares the trail for awhile with the Long Trail so as a result some of the hikers were from that trail in addition to many AT hikers. I found a nice spot to set up my tent then joined some of the hikers around the wonderful fire someone had built. It was dark by the time I was done eating and I made my way back to my tent and cozy sleeping bag. I really love my sleeping bag and tent!

Day 55, Tuesday August 3 - Today I hiked out with Hocus Pocus, we both have reservations at the Catamount hotel and will be picked up at a road crossing. I have been toying more and more with the idea of going home. I will go into more detail on that in my newest ‘Thoughts’ document. Anyway, that was on my mind for most of the 12 mile hike up and down the mountain. The forest today seemed to stay the same most of the hike today, lots of low growing plants and tall but skinny trees. I don’t know if the forest really didn’t change as much today or if my mind was on other things. The mud was still thick and sloppy in many areas on the trail but you could see where is was beginning to dry out some on the edges. Hunting for a stone to put your foot on versus sinking into the mud was the game with every step. It’s amazing how well you adapt to this game and honestly how I didn’t become annoyed when I lost the game and my foot was sunk below the surface, better luck next time!! Hocus Pocus stopped along the way to apply bug spray and do a couple of other things so I moved on and we agreed to meet at the top of the mountain two miles before our pick up spot where we would have cell service and could call the hotel and give them a heads up. I breathed in the smell of the forest as I hiked along, today it smelled of pine needles and spices and the water in the creeks ran clear and abundant. Hocus Pocus caught up to me about 15 minutes after I reached our meeting place and together we continued to hike toward the road crossing. The last mile and a half down to our road was crazy. The trail became intensely steep and the entire path was a dump of huge boulders to carefully walk down. In a few places boulders had been used as steps but they were uneven in size and spacing. The walk down was extremely challenging but fun. We made it to the road where a SOBO hiker was also waiting for his ride to the same hotel. He updated us on what was ahead. Not surprising due to the fact we were now in Vermont which is famous for its mud, lots and lots more sloppy mud ahead! He also said in all of July there had only been four sunny days. Covid is also curtailing work for stay at the huts and in order to garner one of the stealth camping spots you need to hike at odd hours. Our ride to the Catamount hotel in Bennington arrived and we were taken to this iconic hiker motel. It was such a great deal. For $55.00 plus tax you got a clean room with coffee pot and tv, and for another $5.00 they wash and dry your laundry and provide loaner clothes. The hotel is old but well maintained and a close walk to town. The bathroom toilet is pink which was popular back in the day and reminds me of my grandmother’s bathroom with pink tile. After showering, putting on loaner clothes and taking my clothes to be washed I walked to town and enjoyed dinner at a local brewery and pub. My evening was filled with emotion as I worked through my decision to head home.

WhichWay,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641936,"Day 56, Wednesday August 4 - Today is a true zero day with no miles to hike today or in the near future due to me going home tomorrow. I feel very odd, like a square peg trying to fit into a round hole. More hikers came off the trail to the hotel last night and as I walked down the street I see a couple of others arriving. I feel like I am watching everything from a distance and somewhat invisible, an out of body experience of sorts. I really can’t wrap my brain around my current position. I’m a hiker but not at the moment, a person headed home with no direction as of yet as to how I’ll get there. I know if I continue to hike further north the harder it’s going to be to get home. I only have 12.1 miles before reaching 600 miles so I looked carefully at the map to see if there was any way I could pull that off. Unfortunately the next take out spot is over 30 miles away and then there would be logistics to figure out how to get back to a town to get home. As a result I stop just shy of a large milestone and that is a bit frustrating. I know I’ve walked much further with all the walks into town and shelters and lookouts and water sources so I remember that and remind myself it doesn’t really matter. I walked down the street pack free wearing loaner clothes from the hotel hiker box. It’s a quaint town with unique older homes all landscaped with naturalized flowers, it feels peaceful. I went to breakfast at a small breakfast cafe where the food was great and the staff very friendly. After I ate, I walked a couple of blocks to the bus stop to get information about how to get home. They gave me a couple of options and I walked back to the hotel to make some calls. I really wanted to take a train home but it required a Covid test 24 hours ahead, there weren’t any seats left and a room was over $1000.00. My next option was the bus so I made the necessary calls and bought my tickets for Thursday which will put me home Friday after one. I spent the rest of the afternoon packing up my pack, putting extra supplies in the hiker box, getting a bag ready with snacks for the bus ride tomorrow and then headed to town for homemade gelato and some window shopping in a couple of antique stores and bought a book at a great bookstore for the ride home. In the meantime Gourmet sent me a text and said she had just gotten to town and we planned to meet for dinner. Another wonderful surprise as I walked around town was Racehorse and Red walking back up the sidewalk towards the hotel!!! I was so happy to see them. I thought for sure they were miles ahead and never thought I would see them again. They were really happy to see me too and we planned to get together in the evening. After dinner with Gourmet we walked to the gas station and bought a bottle of wine and headed back to the hotel. There is a picnic table outside the hotel and we sat there with Racehorse, Red and a couple of SOBO hikers. We spent a couple of hours talking trail talk and just enjoying the night. It was the best send off I could have asked for, sitting with friends whom I had become close to in such a short time over the trail we all loved and experienced.","

WhichWay,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641938,"I thought it would be interesting to some to understand my daily routine. I have a couple different versions depending on where I’m staying. I’ll start with my tent version.
TENTING

First thing when coming into camp for the night I look around to choose the best spot for my tent. I want the most level ground away from any potential water issues (unlike the night of the storm where I didn’t have time to choose and got flooded)
Once my sight is picked I get ready to set up my tent. 
I remove my food bag and set it aside then pull out my tent. I lay down the ground cover, assemble and attach the poles, then add the tent body. 
Before putting the rain fly on I empty my clothing bag and use it to blow up my air mattress 
I then refill my clothing bag with everything but my night clothes and put it on my air mattress to use as a pillow. I put my sleeping bag liner on my air mattress and my sleeping bag next to the air mattress to pull over myself once the night air gets chilly. Next I put my headlamp, phone, mileage log, phone, reading glasses and baby wipes in the little tent pockets so they can easily be accessed later. Lastly, in goes my almost empty backpack. 
The rain fly goes on next. 
If I need water I go get that next and filter it. 
Now I change out of my hiking clothes and into camp shoes and sleeping clothes. My hiking clothes get hung to dry in a forever hopeful moment they will be drier in the morning than when I took them off. 
Dinner is now ready to be made and eaten; no matter what it is I’m always happy and ready to put food in my belly. 
Teeth are brushed and all food items, items with scent and the trash bag are put into the food bag and either tied to a tree or if available put in a bear box. 
Depending on the time and level of mosquito infestation whoever is at the campsite may hang out and visit for awhile. Once it’s dark out though most people are in their tents or if near a shelter in their bags in the shelter. 
I then create my journal entry for the day and on rare occasions if time allows I read my book a bit before going to sleep. 
In the morning I stay in my tent and pack up my sleeping bag, roll up my air mattress, gather up the odds and ends and repack much of my pack. I also change back into hiking clothes at this time 
I usually leave the tent up until after breakfast so it can dry off if it’s wet from dew overnight.
I make breakfast and gather more water if needed. 
Taking down my tent is last, stuff it into its sack and put it in my backpack - then add my food bag last. 

SHELTER 

When I first get to the shelter I pull out my air mattress to set up and save my spot on the floor or a bunk depending on my he shelters attributes.
I empty my clothing bag and use it to blow up my air mattress 
I then refill my clothing bag with everything but my night clothes and put it on my air mattress to use as a pillow. I put my sleeping bag liner on my air mattress and my sleeping bag next to the air mattress to pull over myself once the night air gets chilly. Next I put my headlamp, phone, mileage log, phone, reading glasses and baby wipes next to my bedding so they can easily be accessed later. I set aside my stove and food bag and hang my backpack on a nail or peg.
If I need water I go get that next and filter it. 
Now I change out of my hiking clothes and into camp shoes and sleeping clothes. My hiking clothes get hung to dry in a forever hopeful moment they will be drier in the morning than when I took them off. 
Dinner is now ready to be made and eaten; no matter what it is I’m always happy and ready to put food in my belly. 
Teeth are brushed and all food items, items with scent and my trash bag are put into the food bag and either tied to a tree or if available put in a bear box. 
Depending on the time and level of mosquito infestation whoever is at the campsite/shelter may hang out and visit for awhile. Once it’s dark out though most people are in their tents or in their sleeping bags within the shelter. 
I then create my journal entry for the day and on rare occasions if time allows and I’m still able to keep my eyes open I read my book a bit before going to sleep. 
In the morning I  pack up my sleeping bag, roll up my air mattress, gather up the odds and ends and repack most of my pack. I also change back into hiking clothes at this time no matter how cold and damp they are. 
I make breakfast and gather more water if needed. 
My food bag goes in my pack last then it’s time to hike!","

WhichWay,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641939,"It never fails to amaze me how these giant trees living in this rocky land can exist when their roots don’t have much chance at any depth. How do these huge trees stay upright in a storm and high winds? Any leaning tree should just exhaust itself from hanging on by a thread and fall on over. One particular tree I saw was full grown and living entirely on top of a boulder. Most of the time a large number of the tree’s roots are sprawling across the surface, over the dirt and sliding over the face of boulders like a slithering snake. The roots are anywhere from the diameter of a pencil to almost as thick as my thigh. Looking around the forest there are those trees that succumb to outside forces and exhausted from the sheer act of standing fall over, thick, massive root balls now 90 degrees from the earth that bore them. Most of these root-balls reveal a very shallow root system; but what I find fascinating is when the roots of the tree are wrapped around several rocks of various sizes, hugging them and hoping their hold will suffice when the winds try to blow them over. 
I always watch for the different fungi and mushrooms because I find the variety so fascinating. One day I saw a large fungus on a tree which was in such perfect shape and  larger than a cowboy hat, simply amazing! When I touched it the texture was almost waxy. I couldn’t believe it had grown so large and was in such pristine condition. 
The privys in Massachusetts were great as far as privys go. They were large with screens for ventilation and light and had openings with screens on the door helping you not feel so claustrophobic. 
The blazes in the first half of Massachusetts need updated. Half of them were missing or so faded you couldn’t tell if it was a blaze or not until you got closer. Many were painted where hikers were stepping on the rocks and as a result were either almost gone or closely resembled lichen. 
Listening to the hikers who started their journey in Georgia I noticed a common theme. Many of them started with enthusiastic miles every day and are always trying to do more. As time went on however most of them have slowed down. Many realized they were missing a large part of the journey, enjoying what they were seeing and taking time to enjoy the towns they were passing through. A lot of the hikers are now just wanting to get their hike done and be finished; hikers with this attitude are only finishing because they had set out to do it, not because they were still enjoying it. Those that are slowing down seem to be having a much better experience. ","

WhichWay,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641940,"Off and on throughout the trail I would think about going home. My first experience with this was just before my 200 mile mark. After much reflection I believe this was because in part due to my experienced friend heading home due to an injury and me being left to my own devices, a moment where my self confidence was shaken. Also I was experiencing a lot of leg pain due to the Bakers Cyst behind my knee having leaked and causing selling and I wasn’t sure how that was going to pan out. I’m so very happy I didn’t stop hiking. I went past that almost 200 mile mark to just shy of 600 miles, all full of adventure and eye opening learning experiences. As I hiked on past the 200 mile mark once in awhile I would still think about going home. I can’t pinpoint what would make me think I wanted to go home but I can honestly say it wasn’t the rain, hard climbs, mud, always present dirt and disgusting odor wafting from myself or clothes. The going home thoughts weren’t from daily camp chores or camp food, mosquitoes or rocks or even sore body parts. It’s not that I find the ‘hardships’ of hiking fun but to be completely honest I felt all the hard parts were just part of the package and to be expected. It was mainly at night when I was tired that thoughts of going home would weave themselves into my emotions or in the mornings when I needed to get my wet clothes on and start moving. I believe it was just homesickness and I wanted  what was familiar and cozy when I was tired. Once I loaded up my pack though and put my disgusting smelling wet shoes on the the trail and hiked less than a mile I was always ready to continue on to my next destination. I loved the hike, the challenge and the ever changing environment. Last week though I felt something change. Even during the day while hiking the thought of going home would creep in. Even when I bought my resupply I would wonder if I would need all of it or if I would be heading home before I ate it all. The toe on my right foot never stopped hurting for very long and was always swollen, the ever present ‘marble’ under my toe pressing against the surface, in addition to the perpetual swelling in my left knee and leg, most likely from the Bakers cyst doing its thing again. Hearing from a SOBO hiker about how hikers on the trail north were finding it difficult to find places to camp due to the large number of hikers coming through and huts no longer offering work for stay due to Covid and limited paying sleep spaces all worked on my brain that was already saying ‘go home’. I couldn’t shake the feeling any longer that I was just done. I felt just like Forest Gump where he ran and ran and ran then suddenly just stopped in his tracks, turned around and walked home! I really don’t know how else to explain it, it was just time. Will I regret it? I’m sure I will as days go by and I understand what I haven’t seen or experienced. Friends and family have been extremely supportive of me and had all the belief in the world I could accomplish the entire 2200 miles and instead I ‘only’ did just under 600. I know I could have finished the rest. I learned I have the physical stamina to climb mountains and am able to endure all types of hardships, but once the curtain fell on desire and home outweighed staying on the trail I knew without a doubt it was time to stop. Who knows what the future holds, but I believe at some point I will pick up other parts of the trail to hike, maybe in smaller chunks. I foresee enjoying other backpacking trips even if only a couple of days or a week long. This experience has reawakened my desire for to be outdoors where I am happiest. I know for a fact how little we need to survive every day. Each and every day on the trail has reminded me how people in our lives are all that matter, stuff is simply stuff. Relationships and kindness must always be the priority, without exception. 
I had many reasons for wanting to hike the trail, all of which I laid out in the little booklet I put together before my hike. I know some of my vision was a ‘romanticized’ version blown up in my imagination after all the videos and books I read and years of dreaming about this adventure; other parts of my desire to hike the trail were as solid as a rock. One aspect of the trail I looked forward to was time alone to ponder the past, reflect, have an acceptance of events which happened in the past or actions regretted, forgiveness for myself and others. I didn’t end up with as much reflection time as I anticipated. When I hiked alone most of my mental energy was spent either taking in the beauty around me or concentrating on climbing the mountain, navigating the mud, rocks and roots or figuring out where I would sleep or resupply next. The importance and goal for this aspect for trail was not lost however. Carrying everything I needed to survive on my back, wearing the same exact clothes down to my underwear and socks every single day for two months, experiencing generosity of spirit and goods beyond measure, meeting people from all walks of life and hearing their life stories provided me more insight into what I wanted to learn than opening all the drawers in my mind. Unlocking those drawers or filing cabinets filled with events from the past and trying to untangle the web and make sense of shrouded memories would not be unlike trying to separate a thousand fine necklace chains that had been tossed in a box. After this journey I better see how for most individuals life is full of crossroads, innocence betrayed, tragedy, loss, and unpredictable circumstances. No matter who is to blame, what caused regrettable actions or choices made, no amount of money, prayer, influence, miracles, reflection or rubbing of the worry stone can ever change a millisecond of the past. What we can do though is to learn. Learn as an individual where our weaknesses are that create decisions we regret later. Learn how we can strengthen our weaknesses and not allow others to use them for their benefit. In this way only can the past create a better future filled with peace.","
