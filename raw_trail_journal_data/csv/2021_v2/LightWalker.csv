LightWalker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643822,"I have been looking forward to this hike for several years. It starts where I left off last Fall on the Appalachian Trail (AT) in Caratunk, Maine, a mere 145 miles from the northern terminus. It ends just 9 miles short of the norther terminus, at the entrance of Baxter State Park. It’s a 135-mile section that I hope to complete in 9 days. I hope to summit Mt. Kathadin on day 10. It will be the longs continuous days hiked on the trail. Upon completion I will have hiked the northern half of the 2,200-mile-long trail over five years of hiking 1–2-week sections at a time.
Preparation for this trip started later than I hoped because of health reasons and laziness. I gained approximately 25 lbs. since the end of my hike last Sept, due to over-eating during sinus infections and lack of exercise and diet. I started dieting 7 weeks before this hike and was happy to have lost 20 lbs! I hope to lose 5 more lbs. over the next 3 weeks.
I picked up some new equipment this spring to help with the hike. I bought a 60-liter ultra-light backpack, a bear proof cannister and a Personal Locator Beacon (PLB). This new pack is nearly half the weight of my old pack. The bear cannister adds that weight back. However, it saves me time from having to hang bear bags at campsites. It will also come in handy next year if I hike out west because they are required out there. My PLB will signal an immediate rescue effort if needed over reliable GPS. Twice last year during foul weather I felt like my life would have been in danger if I got off the trail along exposed ridges. This device will ensure a safe return if that happens. It also claims to work in any weather condition. The reviews back that claim up.
I’m really looking forward to driving up to central Maine 10-11 days of arguably the most scenic hiking in the Northeast, good exercise, being one with nature, doing yoga daily, and sharing stories with fellow hikers. I hope to avoid injury, have good weather, test out my new pack, and most importantly: my family stays safe while I’m away. I'm driving up tomorrow, the day before I start hiking, and will not include those details in my journal. In summary, I'm driving from central CT to Caratunk, ME, approximately 350 miles over 6 hours. I'm staying at the Sterling Inn, a Hiker hotspot in Caratunk, about a mile south of the trail.",,View Entry,"Sep 09, Thu",0
LightWalker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643823,"Today was quite possibly the best backpacking day I've ever had since starting backpacking 4 years ago. It began waking up at 6:15 in my private room at the Sterling Inn in Caratunk Maine. Coffee was waiting in the kitchen along with bagels, muffins orange juice and hard boiled eggs. I had a pleasant breakfast, meeting several other hikers and having a nice conversation with the innkeeper. Apparently the Inn has a history going back some 80 years of hosting hikers along the Appalachian Trail. At 7:45 the innkeeper gave me a ride to the trailhead. I started hiking before 8:00 a.m. The first 6 mi were beautiful and relatively flat. Some parts were along a nice mountain stream. I hiked a mile and a half uphill to a nice overlook mountain peak. The views in all directions were absolutely stunning. Most of the trees were still green but you could see some areas where the foliage was starting to turn different colors. I was really happy that my sore hip was not impeding my hike nor giving me any pain. I hiked down the mountain across a small river. The water level was low and I was able to get across the river on rocks without taking my shoes off. After 14 and 1/2 miles of I arrived at a l we an-to and set up my tent about 50 yards away. There were several other hikers there. One hiker was on his night ever on the Appalachian Trail. It brought back memories when I started backpacking solo 4 years ago. I met another other guy that was up here with a lady friend showing her the ins and outs of backpacking. They were staying for the weekend and were cooking with real food and real utensils, not dehydrated stuff. This man had hiked the entire Appalachian Trail in his youth and chares some of his stories of the trail to the rest of us. There was a through hiker that had just begun his trip some two weeks earlier from the northern terminus and was heading south. After dinner we told some stories got dressed for bed and fell asleep shortly after. It was the end to an excellent day of backpacking, thanks to the Lord. All my conditioning and worries from the previous 6 to 8 months had paid off. As expected the campsite had no cell coverage. I didn't mind that because I really wanted to get away from technology on this trip. The only thing left to do was to journal on my phone and check out the trail conditions for the next day using my GPS enabled trail tracking application on my phone. I went to sleep reflecting on how wonderful the day was and dreaming of days to come along this magnificent trail and hopefully completing the 100 mile of wilderness over the next 10 days, God willing. The weather was perfect The morning temperature was 50°. It warmed up to the upper 60s during the day and dropped down to the mid-50s overnight It was humid in the morning but the afternoon was dryer with the light breeze. I couldn't have asked for better weather for my first day on the trail. The forecast for the next 2 days is very similar. Prior to my arrival I had planned not to summit Mount Katahdin on the last day. In retrospect the odds of me coming back here to summit that mountain and complete the northern half of the Appalachian Trail would be slim to none. Now I'm planning to hike to the peak of Mount Katahdin when I finish hiking the hundred mile wilderness Lord willing.","US Route 201

LightWalker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643824,"I woke up to nearly perfec weather conditions The temperature was in the mid-50s with a light breeze which kept the mildew off my tent. I made some coffee and joined the other hikers fireside. We told a few more stories shared some experiences and laughed. I packed up and got on the trail at about 8:00 a.m. By 9:30 I had climbed up over a thousand feet elevation to the summit of Moxie Bald Mountain. It was partly cloudy. Nevertheless the views were present. I found a resting spot just on the northern side of the summit where I could rest and enjoy the view and a snack. The hike down from the summit was pleasant and easing going. I met a southbound hiker with a trail name of no-name, who was really enjoying his hike. I hiked thru a beautifully wooded trail to a stream. I stopped for a snack, a brief rest and watch some ducks swim on by through this beautiful wooded stream. After a brief rest I hiked 4 more miles to the West Branch of the Piscataquis River this is the first river that I would have to forward. I opted to take my pants off, put my flip flops on and walk about 30 yards across knee deep water. After drying off on the other bank I continued northbound toward the east branch of this river which I knew I would have to also afford. Other than the hiker that I met this morning I haven't seen anyone else on the trail today. I can conclude that these two and a half days would be the most peaceful parts of my entire trip. I'm really enjoying the peace and quiet. The next two miles were eight somewhat pleasant riverwalk along the same river that I'd crossed earlier. Unfortunately it was riddled with pointless ups and downs which reminded which were often over 100 ft up and down a half dozen times. If I had hiked that section in the morning I would have considered to be a lot of fun and actually thanked the trail designers but it was late in the day my legs. I was very,btired thirsty and I just wanted to get the campsite. I arrived at the the lean to at 3:45 p.m. It took me about 20 minutes to go down to the river get my water and come back. Time to set up a tent next to the lean to. After setting up my 10 and sleeping pad Quinn had a fire going. I Cooked dinner by the fire pit and talked. We then did some stretching and some yoga. He's into Thai art form where you rotate two bags around you with some rope. It looks similar to Tai chi that's his form of therapy on the trail. I got ready for bed and got to sleep shortly after 8:00 after night fall. It was the end of another near perfect day. I can't wait to find out what surprise is tomorrow has for for me. Good night.","Bald Mountain Brook Lean-to

LightWalker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643825,"I awoke at the break of dawn to a calm and peaceful morning. It took an hour to make breakfast and break camp. I got on the trail at 7:00 a.m. Shortly after getting on the trail I met a through hiker heading northbound named Boo Boo. He was hiking faster than me so he was able to clear all the spider webs from the trail in front of me which was a pleasant surprise. I arrived at the East Branch of the Pesquatecut River and once again had to take my pants off to cross it. The water was cold but very refreshing. I look forward to taking some time off in 100 mile wilderness to swim in the cold water sources along the way. It's really peaceful sitting on the other bank of the river, feeling safe, dry and enjoying the sounds of the birds as a sun rises from the east. The next several miles were relatively flat and peaceful. I had the trail to myself and could hear no man-made sounds. I knew that in a few miles I would be approaching the road to Monson heading back to civilization. Fortunately I'll be starting the 100 mile wilderness tomorrow. I really look forward to that. I took a 10:00 a.m. break about 3 mi from the highway that leads to Monson. When I get there I'll hitchhike back to Cratunk. I've been told by numerous sources including residents of Maine it's known as the hitchhiker state. Hence if you have a backpack the chances are very good a car will stop and give you a ride. I confirm that last fall when it did some hitchhiking up here. I should get back to Monson by late afternoon in time to unwind and relax at the Shaw's Hiker Hostel. The last three miles this morning we're also very calm and peaceful. The terrain was relatively flat with the one hill which led to an awesome view looking east out toward the first 100 mile wilderness. I made it to the highway before noon and started hitching a ride south back to Caratunk. It took about 2 hours to hitch back and an hour to drive to Monson. I quickly grabbed my bed in the bunk room and took a hot shower. I posted my first 2 days on Trail journals. The general store clerk made me a nice turkey sandwich for dinner. I ate it at the Hostel and met a dozen hikers that we're also hiking the same route as me. In hiker lingo hikers that stay together are called a Tramily. I hope some of them hike at my place so I have someone to talk to. One man had just completed his hike and returned back to the Hostel. His group made it to the summit minutes before the clouds rolled in. On the way down they got caught in a thunderstorm and we're pelted by hale. Quite the epic ending IMO. We told stories by the fire while drinking beer. I got to bed by 10:00 and slept well dreaming of the 100 MIle Wilderness.","Horseshoe Canyon Lean-to

LightWalker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644417,"I woke up at the break of dawn at Shaw's Hiker Hostel in Monson ME. I got dressed and went to the dining area where I drank coffee while completing my day three trail journal entry. About 30 hikers met across three dining room tables to have their breakfast, which consisted of eggs bacon, hash browns, pancakes and orange juice. It cost $9 for breakfast and worth every bite.
I somehow managed to pack 6 days worth of food into my bear vault and fit that into my pack. Now I'm just waiting for the shuttle to depart and take us to the trailhead. Words cannot describe how excited I am to be finishing up the northern half of the Appalachian Trail.
The hostel had a 15 person passenger van that we filled up. The driver, who's trail name was  Poet, drove us to the trailhead in a few minutes. As we unloaded our gear he told us some inspirational words of wisdom and some things to look out for on the first day. He then took a group photo in case someone didn't come back he would know from the photo who was missing.
I let all the nearly all the hikers pass past me because they were younger and faster than I was. I had most of the trail to myself once again. It was was very peaceful and exciting to be there. The sky was blue and temps were around 60 degrees, just perfect for hiking. 
The first shelter was about 3 miles in. I stopped to have a breakfast snack. At 6 miles in I came across the tallest waterfall on the Appalachian Trail. It was beautiful. I hiked another 4 and 1/2 mi to the second shelter which I opted to stay at. I arrived there at 2:45 p.m. Normally I would hike till 4:00 or 5:00 in the afternoon. However the next shelter was about 5 mi north and I knew it would be full of the hikers that I came with. I didn't want to sleep in a tent and wake up soaking wet in the rain. There were two other hikers sharing the shelter and we stayed 6 feet apart.
Today's hike was short only about 10.4 mi. However it was rather stressful. The 10 lb of food in my pack pushed the to toyal weight over 32 lbs. The shoulder straps were digging into my shoulders more than I thought they would. I'm looking forward to eating some of the food and making the pack lighter as the days goes by. 
The forecast is rain tonight starting after midnight and thunderstorms starting in the morning. I plan on getting a good night's sleep and starting out early. Good day and good night!Ascent: 1942', Descent: 2201'","ME Route 15

LightWalker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644451,"I woke up at 5:30 and was pleased to see that it hadn't rained or thunderstorm last night. It took me an hour to make breakfast and pack. I hiked  4.6 miles to the next shelter and arrived just in time. Within a few minutes it started thundering and raining. I was hiking close to two young ladies and I hope they had adequate rain cover. The last half mile of this section was through a rocky gorge with scenes reminiscent of the movie deliverance. I feel fortunate that I hadn't come across any shotgun carrying rednecks. It's good to have 5 miles completed before it by 9:00 a.m. I should easily be able to hike another 10 miles today to make up for yesterday. Such was the plan.
When I left the shelter it started pouring rain. Fortunately I had my trail umbrella with me to keep me mostly dry. I should have brought a pack cover because everything inside my pack that wasn't in a ziplock bag got soaked. My windbreaker and hand towel also got soaked which added to my pack weight. 
It was raining on and off all day and the train was very strenuous on me. In summary it was probably the hardest day backpacking for me. 
I arrived at the shelter at around 5:00 p.m. It looked full. But it wasn't. There was enough space left for one more person. They made room for me. I got into the shelter and changed into some dry clothes to avoid hypothermia. I waited about an hour to let them finish cooking their dinners before I started cooking mine. It felt so good to get some warm rice into my body after such a long gruelling day. 
At around 7:00 p.m. we we all retired. I had to take some pain medication so that I could sleep. My legs were very sore from going up and down some that steep terrain in the sometimes pouring rains. I ended up doing 15 miles for the day. The people in the shelter were very nice however most of the men snored especially the one right next to me. It must have been about 50 decibels, which is pretty loud. Fortunately I had some earbuds and I was able to listen to some relaxing music to help me get to sleep. 
The next day should be much better as the rain should subside overnight and it should dry out for the next couple of days. I'm at a mile 26 now which isn't as far as I was hoped to be at this time. All things considered, I'm satisfied with my effort. Good night.Ascent: 4386', Descent: 3376'","

LightWalker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644507,"Despite the continual snoring, I somehow managed to squeeze in a few hours of sleep. I slept late to let everyone else have their breakfast and pack up before I started my breakfast. We must have received 2-3"" of rain overnight! I'm having breakfast about 8:00 a.m. I should be on the trail by 9:00 a.m. I should have a somewhat simple 11.7 mi to a tent site where I won't have to deal with any snoring. I'm still not as far along as I want to be on this hike. However, I am optimistic that I won't run out of food because the last 60 mi are somewhat flat. I'm trying to enjoy the scenery and peace as much as I can but the shorter distance still weighs heavily on my mind.
The first 4.5 mi section started off climbing a steep ridge with a beautiful view overlooking the valley. The clouds started dissipating and I was able to see blue skies to the west. After coming off the ridge the train was relatively flat for the rest of the way except for the last half mile, where I descended about 500 ft. I passed thru several beautiful forrests on that stretch and took several pictures.
I came to a river crossing where the water was about knee deep. This was a good time to relax, have a snack and do some journaling. There are a half dozen hikers on the other side of the river. I opted to take my break on this side, where it's more peaceful and I can journal.
The next three miles ware very pleasant and peaceful. The trail winded along a brook most of the way. The train was relatively flat. After a brief rest and snack I hiked to the shelter a mile and a half away over 500 ft of elevation. I arrived at the shelter a few minutes past 2:00. It was a good feeling to have completed 10 miles. Just 1.7 miles and 700 feet up to the campsite remaining.
After a steep 500 ft uphill climb up a mountain and about a 200 ft descent down the other side I arrived at the campsite. There was already a fella who I'd met the night before in the shelter named Clyde who welcomed me. Clyde's tent was set up and he began building a fire. I found a flat spot to set up my tent. I went down to the spring that was flowing thanks to the rain the day before. I filtered some water and joined Clyde by the fire. It promised to be a very nice evening under the stars with live music.
By the time dinner rolled around the fire was going really well and Clyde was playing up a storm on his guitar and singing. He is a professional musician from New Orleans. We talked about life, songwriting, music and politics. I finished dinner, cleaned up and got ready for bed. I'm happy that I finally got settled into my tent and sleeping bag by 6:50, just before dark. I hope to get up tomorrow at sunrise. 
Tomorrow, the first four miles will be a steep hike up the last tall summit in the 100 mile wilderness. After that it's mostly downhill 14 mi to the next campsite. That should only leave me with about 40 mi left in the wilderness. I'm really looking forward to backpacking my final summit In the 100 Mile Wilderness. I'm looking forward to a nice, peaceful sleep with the no snoring or raindrops. Good night.Ascent: 2621', Descent: 2208'","Chairback Gap Lean-to

LightWalker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644508,"This morning I woke up at 6:15 to clearing skies and a calm slow breeze with temperatures in the mid 50s. It took me about an hour to get packed up and ready for the trail. I had a great night's sleep and look forward to completing the last major peak of the hundred mile wilderness. After that it's mostly downhill. Today I'm planning for a long 18 mile day with lots of elevation.
After 5.4 miles I made it to Logan Brooke lean to. Looking back at my hiking app on my phone it appears that I hiked just under 2,000 ft elevation up and 2,000 ft down over the over this distance. It felt good to have summited the last tall peak in 100 mile wilderness with just one much shorter peak to go later today. The weather at the top was a bit chilly and breezy so I didn't stay long I took a few pictures and video looking out to the south, the east and the west. I saw Mount Katahdin from one peak. It was about 50 miles to the east, which made me rather excited to see the ending point of this journey. 
I passed a few of the hikers that I camped with on the way here. I learned over the last several years it's not good to compare yourself with any other hiker. If you don't keep up with them you might feel disappointed. It's like playing golf with people that are better than you. If you don't perform as well as they do you often feel disappointed. You should be keeping track of your own handicap and trying to beat that at every outing. This reminds me of a saying in the hiking community. Hike your own hike, HYOH. It's a common saying among most through hikers and section hikers but very few day hikers have heard of it.
After 4 mi of hiking I made my way down a steep part of the mountain and onto a relatively flat 3 mi stretch that was very mossy and decorated with small hemlock and pine trees. It reminded of People's Forests in Barkhamsted Connecticut. I made my way to a shelter. Time to have a snack and cross the river with my flip flops on to keep my shoes from getting wet. The river crossing was just a stream crossing and I didn't have to take my shoes off to keep my feet dry. I took a short lunch break on the opposite bank, relaxed in the warm sun. I took several pictures and a beautiful photo of the stream emptying into this lovely mountain lake. Time to start climbing! It's my last mountain of 100 mile wilderness, Boardman Mountain. It's about a thousand feet of elevation over 3 mi. I'll be taking a break halfway up. And really enjoying the views and descent on the way down to the campsite. 
At 245 p.m. I reached the peak of little Boardman Mountain. I was at exactly 50 mi through the hundred mile wilderness. half way! The last three miles were similar to my training route in Ragged Mountain in Southington Connecticut. It was about 3 miles with a thousand feet of elevation. Camp is just a few miles away downhill. I'm looking forward to finishing this 18 mile day. And completing the rest of the trail and three more days. Just 5.4 mi left to hike to the site. It's mostly downhill so it shouldn't take much more than 2 hours. I hope to be there by 5:00 p.m. and find a good campsite next to the shelter.
Less than an hour later I made it to Sand Beach at Crawford lake. The water here is super clean. It felt like it was in the mid to low 60s. If I had time to wash and dry off I would jump in. I see a family of ducks swimming across the lake. It is so beautiful and peaceful here. I could just camp out and stay all night. This reminds me of the Crawford family, a family of seven with five kids that hiked the entire length of the Appalachian Trail 3 to 4 years ago. The kids ranged in age from 2 to 15. The amazing thing about their hike was not only that they completed it in the average time of I believe six months but it was arguably the wettest year on the east coast in the last hundred years. After passing the shelter I had just 2.5 mi left to the end of this extremely long and exhausting day.
I arrived at the lean-to just before 5:00 p.m. I drank three bottles of water during the day. I usually go through two. I found a nice flat campsite about 30 yards behind the lean-to out of snoring range. The rushing water of the brook would not allow me to sleep well. The stream ends in a nice pool right in front of the lean-to. I setup my tent by 5:00, cooked dinner by 5:30 and cleaned up by 6:00. I can relax and unwind. There's only one other person here. His name is Chuck. He's hoping some of his friends show up soon. I walked down to the riverbank and went for a swim in my underwear. The water was very cold but it felt refreshing. I felt every inch of my body getting cleansed. I'm really looking forward to a real shower after this wilderness has been hiked. Time to go sit by the shelter by the fire and say hello to a few hikers that are staying there for the evening. Good night!Ascent: 3064', Descent: 4577'","Sidney Tappan Campsite

LightWalker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644509,"This morning I woke up at Dawn to a pleasant clear skies. The local that forecasted rain for this morning was apparently wrong. Last night was rather difficult to sleep. The snoring of a shelter was replaced by water cascading down a waterfall. You think that would be relaxing. It is to a certain extent, but not while you're trying to sleep. Fortunately, I had my earbuds and plenty of battery in my phone to listen to music for an hour to help fall asleep. It took me my standard hour to have breakfast and pack up and then I got on the trail by 7:00. I'm really looking forward to a 15 mile day along extremely flat terrain. Let's hope it doesn't rain or thunderstorm later.I was able to hike nearly 5 miles in the first 2 hours. As expected the train was flat. There were lots of pines, hemlocks and a few birch trees in in this section. It followed the river for most of it, which was nice and relaxing. It reminded me of some of the flatter hikes I had gone on in Southern New England. Time for a snack break. I could hear a few gunshots maybe a mile away. At the start of the hike someone mentioned it was the start of hunting season. I didn't expect the hunters to be so close to the trail. Fortunately I was wearing my bright orange t-shirt.After completing the second 5 mi section I found myself at a sandy beach in the beautiful lake. I had the entire beach in the view to myself. I took a picture and a short video. I had a lunch snack filtered some water and was looking forward to completing the last of the 15 and 1/2 mi day. I was also able to get internet access at the beach. I checked the weather and was happy to discover that the chance of rain had subsided down to about 30%. Nevertheless I'm going to call it quits at mile 15 to give my legs a break. This trail is starting to wear on me after day 5. Actually day 8 if you include a 3 days I hiked prior to getting to the hundred mile wilderness. Less than an hour later I stopped at a lien to trail side to cool off. The forecast was for temperatures in the mid 70s which is about 15° warmer than seasonal this time of year. Carrying a backpack, it felt like 85 degrees. I was sweating quite heavily. This may be another three bottle day.I finished the hike just before 3:00 and arrived at the shelter. There was a fellow that I camp next to the previous night there named Chuck. There were also two ladies there that I didn't recognize. It appears the ladies were staying in the shelter. I opted to set up my tent nearby. It was only about a hundred yards away from the river making the water resupply simple. The last mile and a half of today's hike was a long a gently flowing river. My favorite type of terrain. Unlike yesterday it wasn't as pleasant. My back was hurting and my neck was sore. This was day 8 of my hike, the longest that I've ever been on trail. I'm glad to be at camp early in the day to dry off. I set up my 10 near the shelter just before a brief rain. I had a delicious dinner and then chatted by the fireside with some hikers that I met at the campsite. I don't have internet access here but I was able to call home and talk to Sheila and Bryson for a while I must admit that's the that was the highlight of my day. I retired before 8:00 p.m. I look forward to getting through the last difficult day tomorrow. I'm hiking nearly 18 miles with some elevation mixed in. I just hope I'm feeling up to it.

LightWalker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644511,"I woke at 5:45 a.m. at the break of dawn to a peaceful breeze besides a quiet lazy river. It took me the normal 75 minutes to have breakfast and pack up. The first mile of trail was along the same river which I was getting tired of by now. It then cut through a mountain pass to a beautiful lake along which I've been hiking for the past two and a half or three miles. There's some elevation coming up in the remaining 13 miles of today's hike and then tomorrow promises to be mostly flat. Time for a breakfast break along this beautiful Sandy Beach. I then hiked about 7 mi to a bridge. Along that stretch was a small mountain. Nevertheless it felt somewhat difficult to climb up 800 ft after spending 2 days on relatively flat terrain. The views from the summit were awesome! I could see Mount Kathadin and several other ridges in Baxter State Park, a mere 40 miles away.I was hiking on and off with a fella I met two days earlier named Chuck. Chuck was with from Raleigh, North Carolina, and had a goal to summit Katahdin about the same time I do. We're both section hikers and both hike at about the same pace. Nevertheless we keep a distance of at least a few hundred feet between us at all times so that we can enjoy the peace and solitude the trail has to offer. After filtering water and eating my lunch neck I got back on the trail just about 6.mi till the campsite that I'm staying at. I hope it is somewhat pleasant and my shoulder doesn't give me any problems along the way. After 2 mi and 300 ft of elevation we made it to rainbow springs lean to. Time for a well-deserved 10 minute break. Less than 4 miles to go to the rainbow spring campsite. I hope the campsite is as nice as the name sounds. Most of this past 2 miles was hiking right along a babbling brook which is extremely soothing and relaxing to listen to I felt no shoulder or back pain along that stretch.Two and a half miles later we arrived at the campsite. It was extremely nice and hidden from the shores of the lake that we had to ourselves. The water was warm enough to swim in but it was cool that evening so we opted not to swim. After a nice dinner and conversation we retired. Tomorrow be very interesting day. Just 12 more miles left in the 100 Mile Wilderness! Then I find out the details of when I can climb Mt.

LightWalker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644513,"I purposely woke up in the dark at 4:50 a.m. I had to get an early start. There was a possibility of having to hike 22 mi. It's a strange system they have there in Baxter State Park. If you're one of the first 12 to arrive and can't afford $30 to stay at the purchase at the base of Kathadin, then you can arrive there the afternoon before, which would set you up for a leisurely 6 mi hike to the summit the next day. However, you don't know if you could be one of those 12 hikers to sign up until you arrive at the bridge just beyond the end of the hundred mile wilderness. I packed up in the dark, had a quick breakfast and got on the trail before 6:00. It was nice and quiet. It was nice watching the sunrise over rainbow springs lake. The lake must have been 6 miles long. I hiked 3 miles up in yesterday and 3 mi along it this morning. The train was relatively flat. The peacefulness of the waters relieved any stress and that my body had absorbed from the long day before. After 5.5 mi I arrived at a small summit called Rainbow Ledges. I was told to call the hotel from here so I did. I arranged for my pickup for tomorrow afternoon. they confirmed that they would pick me up between 2:00 and 3:00 p.m. Time to start the hike down from the ledge. I'm optimistic that I'll be able to arrive at the bridge in time to sign up for the reservation. If not it will be relatively short 12 mile day and a relatively long 22 mi day tomorrow to finish off my hike. After an hour of hiking I made it to the last shelter on the AT. I had just 3.5 mi left to go. I finished the rest of my breakfast snack. I caught up to Clyde at this shelter. He was just packing up and leaving. I hope to see him one more time before he departs back south to New Orleans. Maybe if I get really lucky he'll play a tune or two on his guitar. Off to do the last section. Wish me luck. I'm feeling very confident.I arrived at the end of the hundred mile wilderness shortly after 11:00 a.m. ahead of schedule. Shortly after was a short road walk to the general store. There I got enough resupplies for dinner breakfast and a snack from going up and down the mountain tomorrow. I'm off to hike possibly the longest half mile to trail. It's a half mile road walk to the kiosk. There I will find out if there's availability at the birches campground. If so I get to hike to the base of Katahdin this afternoon and set me up for a leisurely summit tomorrow. If not I've got a hike back here camp here near the general store then hike the 10 plus the summit tomorrow so. I felt good hiking this morning carrying a much lighter pack. The wet clothes from the previous rain storm were dry. And I was completely empty of food. So my pack was the lightest it could possibly be. I said goodbye to Clyde and wished him luck getting back to his home in New Orleans. I was very happy that I was the fifth hiker to register to stay in the park tonight. Thank God! Now I just need to endure a 9.5 mi semi rugged hike to the campsite I'll probably get there around 5:00 p.m. Sufficient time to setup camp, cook dinner and get a good night's sleep before waking up and submitting the beast that's rising from Baxter State Park, Mount Katahdin. The first six miles of this stretch went along side rivers and a large brook. There were several waterfalls, each more beautiful that the last. The largest falls was called great Niagara falls. It must have been at least 50 ft from the top of the falls to the bottom. I took several pictures and video of the waterfalls coming up they are absolutely beautiful and made my day pitch perfect. Now I'm taking a break just 2.5 mi from the campground. After 20+ mile and 10 hours of hiking I arrived at the Kathadin Stream Campground. It was about a quarter mile hike to the ranger station to register, followed by a quarter mile hike to the tent area. It's about 4:40 now. Time to set up camp and prepare for ranger Pete to come up and give us the talk. I am so looking forward to winding down my longest day on the trail and summitting Mount Kathadin starting around 7:00 a.m. tomorrow morning and finishing by 2:00 PM, Lord willing. Shortly before dusk two hikers arrived with a plethora of treats for us. We stoked up the fire pit. It was a beautiful fire pit with benches all around custom made. The nicest one I've ever seen on Appalachian Trail. We put the grill on the over the fireplace and cooked hot dogs and s'mores. They also brought up some beer but I didn't like that flavor so I did not have any. We told a few stories and retired about an hour later. It was the end of a near perfect pre-summit day. Good night.Ascent: 2231', Descent: 2211'","Rainbow Spring Campsite

I woke up at dawn, guessing it was 6:15, because my watch battery was dead and my cell phone was turned off to save the remaining battery for the hike up Mount Katahdin. I asked another hiker the time and confirmed I was all packed up by 7:15. By 7:30 we had trimmed our packs down at the ranger station by putting un-wanted items into another bag with our name on it. Two other hikers and I began our trek on this final stretch to the norther terminus of the Appalachian Trail. I turned my phone on and began taking pictures. The wind was calm and the temperature was around 60 degress. It was nearly calm, with colder windy conditions forecast at the summit. Sun was forecast all day.
This will possibly be the most if not one of them most exciting summits of my life! I am really looking forward to it. Would it meet or exceed my expectations? Would it be the icing on the 1200 mile AT journey that I embarked on five years ago? Would the weather hold out? Would my aching body hold out? Time will tell. May God watch over us as we climb this most sacred mountain and complete our northbound hike. Just 5+ miles left with over 4,000 feet of elevation to the summit! Time to get hiking!
8:30 report: The first 1.5 miles was almost flat. Some of it was along Kathadin Stream, which was flowing well. It was an hour into the hike and had completed the first thousand feet of elevation. Just under 3,000 ft of elevation left with 3 miles to go. I'm feeling confident that I will summit by 11:00. The wind started picking up and the temperature remained around 60 degrees. About 20% phone battery left.
9:30 report: I'm about 2 miles from the summit with about 1600 ft elevation left I recently broke broke above tree line and have been climbing very steep boulders for the last quarter mile.  There are several day hikers ahead of me which gives me some comfort. I'm giving them space so that I can have as much peace and solitude along this final two mile stretch as possible. I'm feeling pretty good physically, although my legs and ankles are getting more tired or by the minute. About 15% phone battery left.
10:30 report: I just hiked up a steep 700 feet of exposed ridgeline with odd shaped rocks. It was the most difficult part of the 1200 miles I had hiked thus far. I'm glad my legs and ankles held up. I'm about 7/10 of a mile and 500 ft elevation away from the summit of Mount Katahdin. The nearly flat plane up here is absolutely beautiful. Its in the alpine zone. There is a spring trail-side named Thoreau Spring. I can see the trail widing along this plateau to a steeper 500' section. I'm told the summit lies just above. I'm hiking a hundred yards between a few day hikers. All these section hikers and thru hikers I started with were ahead of me. They had lighter packs and were younger and more physically fit than I am. The wind has picked up to 10-20 mph and the temperature was around 60 degrees.
By 10:50 I had made it to the summit. Yay! Just 4% phone battery left! About two dozen hikers are here celebrating their sucesss. It is a bit windy and a little cold but not too bad with my wind breaker on. The views from all sides arespectacular. I really can't describe the feeling of elation that I'm feeling at this moment. My food, water and phone are almost drained but my spirit is sky high. I asked a lady to take my picture next to the summit sign. I took some pictures and video in all directions, including a 4K video clip. I look forward to the leisurely walk downhill back to the car to make it to the shuttle by 3:00 p.m. What a fantastic morning and end to an epic northbound hike! I left the summit around 11:20. 1% phone battery left. Phew!1:00 Report: I made it down past the steep exposed ridge without falling. I'm was really glad my body was holding up. I took it slow and easy as the climb down is more difficult and dangerous than the climb up. The sun was out and I was able to get more water at a spring along the way. The winds were around 10mph. The temperature was around 60 degrees. Life was wonderful!2:30 Report: I made it back to campsite, got the rest of my gear and waited in the picknic area for my shuttle to arrive. It was sunny with a light breeze with temperature around 70 degrees. It was a great feeling to have completed my hike with no injury and near excellent weather. While waiting for our rides, we were treated to some snacks and a home-made cake, provided by the parents of one of the hikers. What a nice treat to top off our celebration! 4:30 Report: After a 2 hour wait, there was no sign of my shuttle. Everyone else's shuttles had come and taken them to other destinations. I was wondering if they forgot about me. There was no phone service and I was getting worried. Some hikers noticed my dilema and offered to share their campsite with me. There was no time to hike out so I agreed. 5:00 Report: My shuttle finally arrived. The driver appologized for the delay and assured me he got here as fast as he could. Fortunately, there was another hiker in the shuttle, allowing me to split the $150 cost back to Shaw's Hiker Hostel in Monson, nearly 2 hours away.7:00 Report: We arrive back at the hostel in time to grab a sandwich and celebratory six pack of beer at the general store down the street. After a quick dinner, we celebrated in the Music Room with about 20 other hikers. Some had just completed their journey. Most were celebrating the start of the 100 Mile Wilderness the next day. The forecase was for a rainy week, but they did not seem to care. We took turns playing various musical instruments, sang songs, told stores and shared beers until the fridge was dry.10:00 Report: The music finally stopped and most hikers had retired. I could not believe how much energy I had after such a long week/day/summit hike. This was truly the finish I was hoping for, but feared not to expect. I looked forward to a good night's sleep in my private room and a fabulous breakfast served in the kitchen. It made all the conditioning, dieting and planning worth it! Will I ever do it again? I don't think so. My local hiking club comes up here every couple of years. Perhaps I will join them when they do.","Kathadin Stream Campground
