Steven Bressan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635076,"1. Sunday began with a flurry of final preparations for the trail. Packing and repacking my backpack, setting aside backup clothes for my parents to mail, and eating breakfast took up most of the morning. After a beautiful drive into Rockfish Gap in Southern Shenandoah, my parents dropped us off at the McCormick gap, mile 868. After 5 miles of hiking we camped near the confluence of three small streams. 
2. Monday morning was a slow morning, filled with plenty of gentle stretching to try to overcome the aches and pains that now assailed my feet and legs from the hiking on Sunday. We filled up on water and left, believing the next source was 6+ miles away. At the top of the first mountain, a friendly hiker let us know that there was campground with water under two miles away. Cue dumping out half of my remaining water on the mountain peak. Water is the single heaviest essential on the trail. Hikers always hope to carry as little as possible. 
3. Tuesday was very mild and beautiful. After hiking 3½ miles through seemingly endless thickets of mountains laurel, we summited Blackrock Mountain. Here in the high elevation, only the earliest spring flowers are in bloom. Most of the trees have no leaves at all, though a handful of species have flowers. Blackrock peak was an impressive jumble of rocks ranging in size from a basketball a double-wide. Pines and deciduous trees clung to life in the most opportune crevices and splits that had collected perhaps no more than a quarter inch of soil. We ate a leisurely lunch there before descending onto a broad, flat ridge where we camped overnight. 
4. Wednesday led us to our first campground, Big Top. Although it still closed for the season, we searched for the camp store in hopes of finding potable water and a chance to recharge our batteries. On the covered porch, we found everything we hoped for in addition to a real bathroom with running water! After recharging, washing, and eating lunch, we each foraged a dinner's worth of food out of the ""hiker box"" sitting unassumingly out front of the store. Free for anyone to take, we found a few granola bars, four packs ramen, and two applesauce left in the box by some mysterious benefactor. Spirits high, we hiked into Pinefield Hut shelter to spend the night. The mounting rain clouds broke within minutes of reaching our campsite, and it showed no signs of letting up when I tucked into my hammock around 10p.
5. Thursday carried blue skies and sunshine to Pinefield Hut. We tarried long into the morning in order to let our tarps and clothes dry out as much as possible before we began hiking. We began the approach to the highest elevation summit so far, Hightop. We camped at Hightop Hut, 3,100ft above sea level, and only a quarter mile below the summit.  The winds whipped at us all night, huge roaring gusts that shook the treetops, alternately followed by the howling, whipping eddies that seemed to try to push my tarp in every direction at once. Despite the intensity of the weather, the moon showed her face for the first time, a tiny smiling crescent hanging low over westernmost peaks of the Shenandoah Valley. That night was very tough, with temperatures around 25°F. 
6. Friday morning was cold. So, so cold. We huddled in the Hut as we ate a speedy breakfast, and left this exposed campsite in hopes that the summit would bring mild weather and warm sunbeams. I chatted with a thru hiker who was bringing along his 8yr old dog on the trail, for at least the VA section. I hope he and the dog are able to make it to Katahdin! We hiked down off of Hightop to reach Swiftwater Gap and US33. At this point, we decided to pick up four more days of food, and let our blistered feet rest. We resupplied in Elkton, and stayed over at a rustic motel just three miles from the trailhead. Showers at last. 
7. Saturday offered free admission into SNP. As expected, the parking areas were the fullest we had ever seen them. We hiked North through a forest of huge and stately Liriodendron tulipfera, frequently exceeding 6ft in circumference. We reached the Pocosin Gap Cabin in the afternoon, an old CCC building. We camped nearby for easy access to the spring. About 60 miles remain of Shenandoah National Park.","McCormick Gap

Steven Bressan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635583,"8. Sunday morning began with golden light streaming though the pines around Pocosin Cabin. After stretching and eating, we hiked the ridgeline to Bear's Den Rocks, an imposing and jagged outcrop that could offer enough dens to be a bear condominium. Hazeltop peak was our second tough climb, and in Appalachian habit, the entire top was covered in a thick forest. We camped the night at the more sheltered Big Meadows campground. That evening I saw a herd of 7 deer and numerous ravens as the half-full moon rose out of the East.9. Monday presented the colorful array of wildflowers in Big Meadows. We had a long hike to Skyland Resort (and dining hall), with half a dozen steep cliffs presenting commanding views of the Shenandoah Valley. We reached Skyland and had a hearty lunch, and later dinner before setting up camp at the highest elevation so far, 3,800ft. Late that night we were awoken by the churrs and hoots of a barred owl.10. Tuesday wafted the smell of hash browns, eggs, and coffee from Skyland along the peak to our camp. We returned for a breakfast of omelettes and coffee before continuing our hike North. We recorded a podcast on the trail, and stopped at Mary's Rock for lunch. With a final push, we made it to camp at Pass Mountain Hut.11. Wednesday brought a cold front, with chilling winds blowing all around the Hut. We quickly packed up and set out to reach the Elkwallow Wayside. A short ascent led to a miles-long descent along the ridge, with 360° views of the Blue Ridge pressing in with every turn. We lightly resupplied at Elkwallow and hiked a little further before camping near a small stream.12. Thursday continued the trend of cold mornings, measuring at 33.4°F at 7am. After a speedy and very cold breakfast, we made the short hike up to Gravel Springs, the final shelter in Shenandoah National Park.13. Friday morning I felt very sore and stiff. We stretched at Gravel Springs before summiting three major peaks, South Mount Marshall, North Mount Marshall, and Compton Peak. South Mount Marshall offered the best views, while the other two had many trees. A steep and stony descent out of SNP led us to Tom Floyd Shelter for the night. Thankfully, it much warmer than the previous two. We were nearer to civilization as well, and I heard cows and dogs far off across the woods that night.14. Saturday was downhill all the way, and we reached US-522 by 11:30am. We were picked up by the hostel driver, and resupplied our food at Walmart. Afterwards we headed back to the hostel to rest and recuperate, preparing for a big first day of our third week.","Pocosin Cabin

Steven Bressan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636140,"15. Sunday was an early morning. We sped through breakfast and coffee, and started hiking around 8am. The weather was a perfect 57°F and partly sunny. An easy 10 miles led us  to Manassas Gap for lunch. Afterwards, we continued to push and made it 6 more miles to the Whiskey Run Shelter.16. Monday gifted easy walking through Sky Meadows State Park. Great views off the ridge filled the morning. After lunch, we entered the rollercoaster section. The hiking became extremely tough, and by the time I made it to camp near a 30ft waterfall, I was wrung out, worn down, and utterly exhausted.17. Tuesday brought the Virginia heat, with temperatures reaching 80°F by lunchtime. More rollercoaster hiking brought us to Bear's Den Hostel, where we sprayed down with the hose to keep cool. After resting and eating dinner, we pushed a few more miles and camped under a small copse of pine trees. No sleeping bag was necessary Tuesday night.18. On Wednesday, we met up with three friends, Adam, Cullen, and Trent, who hiked with us for the rest of the week. After a late start, we pushed through another 10 miles of rollercoaster to reach the Blackburn Trail Center. It had a very nice camping area with a spring fed shower. We all showered and went to bed early, exhausted by the heat and our day's efforts.19. Thursday morning found us all well rested, and we were able to make it out of the rollercoaster section at last. Liz presented her New College thesis at 1pm and I was able to tune in. It went very well! We hiked the rest of the way to 4 Mile Campsite outside of Harpers Ferry, and had a roaring fire that night.20. On Friday, we hiked down into Harper's Ferry, and extremely historic and iconic town. It is also home of the A.T.C., but they were still closed. We restocked on water and visited numerous historic monuments before following the old canal out of town. After a grueling climb onto South Mountain, we stayed overnight at a two story shelter. That evening the wind picked up, and many large branches came down on the trail overnight.21. Saturday morning brought more cool weather and wind. We packed quickly and hiked into Gathland State Park. The boys took our packs ahead in the car, and we were able to slackpack another 6½ miles with minimal weight. We got our packs back, said goodbye to our friends, and camped the night at a very nice campground in Maryland that even had heated showers!","US-522

Steven Bressan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637415,"22. We were the last hikers to leave the campground in Sunday morning. After a short hike to the highway, we met my parents, and stayed the night at Ma Brown's house.
23. Ma dropped us off on a cool, gently drizzling morning. The trail climbed up South Mountain steeply, and a long ridge walk led us to the Raven Rock Shelter to spend the night. Water was a long ways down the hill, and it rained again around sunset.24. The morning was humid and the ground was very soggy from the rain the night before. Fortunately the hiking was relatively easy today, and we made it to the Tumbling Run Shelter. There was a large group of NOBOs who had come up from Springer Mountain, as well as a few flipfloppers. 25. I woke up at 4:50am to the sound of a stove turning on. I packed my hammock, drank a little coffee, and went to filter water. As it began to gently rain, and I saw a large mud puppy swimming around in the spring. By 6am, it seemed that the rain wasn't going to stop, so I started hiking. Around 8 it really opened up, and poured hard for an hour. At the first road crossing, I stopped to dry out my clothes and get a burger. The post-burger hike in to Quarry Gap Shelter was my favorite part of the PA trail so far, with towering rhododendrons pressing in on all sides to made a shadowy tunnel alongside the beautiful stream.26. The morning was chilly, but thankfully no more rain came down. An easy ridge walk led us to the Tom's Run Shelter, which had a great fire pit and stacks and stacks of cut wood left by the ATC volunteers.27. We hiked into Pine Grove Furnace SP, the first place in PA that the trail passes directly though. We stopped at the general store, which is the home of the infamous ""half gallon challenge."" Reuben bought his half gallon of ice cream, and sat down on the patio to begin. It was about 58°F and gently raining, perfect ice cream weather. Remarkably, he ate all four pints within the half hour allotted to the challenge. For some reason, he didn't seem all that happy or excited when he finished the last spoonful of Neapolitan. Later, we were picked up by the Greenisens and stayed over in Carlisle.28. Saturday was the first zero day we took on our hike. My feet were extremely painful when I woke up, and I rested as much as possible through the day.","Dahlgren Backpacker Campground

Steven Bressan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637837,"29. Sunday was an active recovery day. We slackpacked about 13 miles from Pine Grove Furnace to just outside of Boiling Springs with our friend Jake. There were impressive 30ft cliffs along the last two miles of the day. Afterwards we went home and celebrated Reuben's birthday!30. We decided to try to push our biggest mileage yet, over 18 miles. We descended from Center Point Knob into Boiling Springs, where many people were fishing. After passing through the town, the trail followed a rolling path across the Cumberland Valley, through wheat fields, hayfields, and small muddy patches of forest. We stopped just south of the next large mountain.31. On Tuesday we ascended the mountains once more, and after a long and brutally rocky section we camped at the Cove Mountain Shelter.32. Wednesday morning brought a profusion of orchids along the trail, mostly pink lady slippers. An easy descent got us to Duncannon, where we crossed the Susquehanna River and spent the rest of the day climbing to the top of Peter Mountain. I noticed a broad headed skink among the rocks near the peak.33. Today's hike followed an old logging grade for many miles through state game lands, thankfully much easier hiking than the last two days. About halfway through the day, a large and very spiny porcupine began waddling up the trail in front of me. I hiked behind him for nearly a half mile before he ambled off to inspect some tasty looking trees near the trail. That night I camped near the old coal mining town of Yellow Springs.34. Friday morning was bright and sunny, and we continued to follow the old road grades down to Swatara State Park. After crossing the bridge, another long ascent took us to the William Penn Shelter, which had a nice piped spring.35. Saturday morning we hiked toward PA501, and as we neared the parking lot I noticed a pair of hikers giving out trail magic. We stopped and relaxed and enjoyed their food and drinks for an hour, then kept hiking. The rocks seemed to increase in number and size the further we went. We finally arrived at the Hertline campsite late in the evening.","Pine Grove Furnace State Park

Steven Bressan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638977,"36. Morning at Hertline brought the sounds of children and dogs running and playing. Weekends always bring out a great variety of other hikers. I hiked down a long ridge into Port Clinton, PA. We got in late, ate dinner in town before staying at the hiker pavilion. 37. Monday morning I chatted with several thru hikers at the pavilion and walked around in the Little Schuylkill River. My parents arrived around noon, and we picked up a resupply before heading to a friend's house for the night.38. On Tuesday, I reorganized my pack and dropped 6½lbs of extra clothes and gear, including my 20° quilt. My parents dropped us off at the Trail around 3:30pm. It was an easy hike that included many woodland creatures, including a woodchuck, chipmunks, squirrel and deer. Later that day we passed some of the best vistas in Pennsylvania. 39. Wednesday we dropped sharply down an access road before beginning a long, dry ridge walk. We reached camp late, around 7:30pm, and had to descend even further to reach the spring. However, that night we built a big campfire and watched the sun set, and it was one of the best campsites of the A.T.40. The Thursday sun shone brightly on our exposed campsite, and I woke early to the sound of birds. I saw several cottontail rabbits out eating the fresh grass, but they quickly ran away as I began to pack up camp. Another steep descent led us to Palmerton, PA, home of the famous zinc pile. The climb back up was a series of bare rock faces and goat paths that led between them. Once we reached the top of the Kittaninny Ridge, there were incredible views to the north and east.41. Friday was the rockiest and most difficult section I had ever hiked. We reached Wind Gap that evening, and gave our packs to a friend so we could slackpack the next day.42. Saturday we hiked the final miles of Pennsylvania, crossing the wolf rock. Nearing the Delaware Water Gap, there were many commanding views of the river and surrounding area. The descent was steep and huge rhododendrons pressed in from all sides. Once our feet were back on level ground, we met with our friend Don and rode north to Lake Wallenpaupack, for a sailing race on Sunday.","Hertline Campsite
