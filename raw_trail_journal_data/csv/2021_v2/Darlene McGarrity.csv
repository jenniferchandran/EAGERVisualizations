Darlene McGarrity,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631966,"I am excited. It is not often that I follow my heart - I may have done it once or twice in my life. But I am finally doing it again in my late 40s, sober, and alone. I am about to embark on a journey unlike any other. I know there will be challenges, faced fears, glory, and a lot of pain. But that is how I will grow. This is a journey of the ultimate self-reflection. I get to find out what I am really made of and if I am as tough as I feel. I have all my gear. My YouTube is set up. I will be blogging for The Trek. But none of it matters unless I am 100% true to myself. I embark on my journey via Amtrak on March 12, 2021 and will arrive in Georgia on March 13, 2021. I have a day counter on my desktop and hike at least 2 - 3 times a week as I try to build my trail legs as much as I can before I face the steps. My name is Darlene and I am a hiker.",,View Entry,"Dec 09, Wed",0
Darlene McGarrity,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632004,"Hey all, how is everyone? It is snowing outside at the moment - it is also dark. We decided to decorate the tree and when going through the decorations that had been in storage for a year, came to find that something had leaked into the bottoms of some of the boxes. Not too bad, but one box was completely ruined. Fortunately, it wasn't the special decorations. Upon further inspection, we concluded that it was stored away candy canes that had melted due to the heat in the area. 
It was terrible. But! We have it cleaned out now, the house and tree are decorated and now we have a shiny new storage area for anything that isn't meltable, or moldable. 
In AT news, I am still working on my strengthening and also my gear. I just put it in a giant pike on the stairs to go through when I do my gear list on YouTube!",,View Entry,"Dec 16, Wed",0
Darlene McGarrity,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632050,"SO, I have a lot of gear. Many foolish purchases that I now regret. Like my wireless earbuds. Kinda stupid. Where the hell am I going to charge them if I use them a lot? I have multiple bear bags, three packs, and lots of little gadgets. I apparently love gadgets. But! I do have important stuff like clothing, paracord, and a knife. So that is good. 82 days left until I leave for Georgia!",,View Entry,"Dec 21, Mon",0
Darlene McGarrity,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632096,"Merry Christmas! I got some more hiking stuff for Christmas and am making it a point to get out on the trail this weekend. It has been a quiet day so far. A lot of rain - I wish it were snow! But it is warm outside today... still grateful for a sober day with my husband and Spirit the Cat. By the way, here is the link to my lighterpack!https://lighterpack.com/r/p30i...",,View Entry,"Dec 25, Fri",0
Darlene McGarrity,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632149,"Well, I took a two-week break from any kind of physical activity... my legs were killing me and I had a lot of other things to do. We went for a bicycle ride today on the D&L Trail up by Slatington today - it was a lot of fun. I am still figuring out my gear! More fun. The entries will get longer. I started my 21-day Manifestation Challenge today as well! <3",,View Entry,"Jan 01, Fri",0
Darlene McGarrity,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632426,"I am less than 45 days away from Georgia and starting on the AT!I am having some trouble navigating this user interface, but that's probably because I am not using this journal everyday... I guess I should start!",,View Entry,"Jan 27, Wed",0
Darlene McGarrity,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632430,"I am so excited to finally be in the final stages of my AT prepping! I have all the gear I need and have decided NOT to bring the GoPro or the camera. It is extra stuff, extra charging, and extra weight I got a new iPhone (my daughter wanted to keep tabs on me) and it is proving to be phenomenal for photos and video. Plus it has cloud storage, so I don't have to worry about my phone being weighed down with storage.",,View Entry,"Jan 27, Wed",0
