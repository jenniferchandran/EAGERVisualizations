Only time will parse that down.,,View Entry,"Apr 30, Fri",0
Slowmo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636148,"Great day to start my gear shake down trip. Clear and in the 70's This day was a Saturday up on the Blue Ridge Parkway and plenty were the folks enjoying the vistas. I started a bit late at 12:15 PM and hit the trail with enthusiasm, well until I realize that my start was going to be uphill. Pretty much uneventful and only saw one SOBO and three passed me NOBO. Given that my trail name is Slowmo that would be of no surprise. I am amazed at the dexterity of the young'uns passing me by as if they were walking on a cloud. I have to be careful of my step as I have a troublesome right knee. This ultimately slows me down, and well, that can't be a bad thing I see so much more on my journey. I've included a picture that is noteworthy that is of a stone wall. This wall was built during the construction of the Blue Ridge Parkway. The picture does not show the magnitude of it's size. The blocks were purposefully cut and not out of some debris left over from the grading of the parkway. Each stone was about 5 to 6 ft. long and 2.5 ft tall made of granite. Imagine being back in the 30's and haven to hump those blocks into place on a grade like that. This would be a major feat even with todays equipment.After about 4 hours I came across some trail magic at the turn off for the Bobblets Gap Shelter. A cooler of ice cold drinks and other goodies! It was a .2 mile zig zag down to the shelter which was nestled along a spring creek in a reasonably steep draw. Not many possibilities for tents or Hammock's. The folks that were there were down right unfriendly, and the hair on the back of my head was at full extension. I topped of my water and got the hell out of there. Don't need that worry. I found a nice spot behind the Bobblets Gap pull off. My ride was going to pick me up in the AM so it was a logical place to camp.All in all it was a good hike. My gear was spot on except for my trail runners. I have some Solomons XT Ultras that are real nice except for going down hill. The toe box is just no big enough and this jams my toes. Time to try something else. I'll check out some vendors at Trail Days coming up soon.","Black Horse Gap
