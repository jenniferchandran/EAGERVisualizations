Happy Feet and CoffeeBean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635344,"The days are counting down before we begin our flip-flop journey. We are going to start in Waynesboro at the southern end of Shenandoah National Park going NOBO (northbound). We plan to hit Mt Katahdin in Maine around late August. Our daughter will pick us up there and bring us home to Waynesboro to re-supply and shower and sleep a night in our own bed. Then off to Springer, GA to hike NOBO back to where we started, Waynesboro! I know we will be covering ground we have already hiked, but this will give us a true thru-hike.We laid out our gear in the spare bedroom to make sure we have everything. We should have made a list when we got off the trail in 2019. We find ourselves constantly asking ""Did we bring 2 pairs of socks or three?"" ""How many pairs of pants did we bring?"" We are trying to keep our base weight as low as possible. David bought a new warmer sleeping bag that cut almost 2 pounds off his weight. I bought a new backpack that trimmed my base weight by 2-1/2 pounds!During our 2019 hike we discovered that CoffeeBean wasn't eating enough calories. He dropped 30 pounds in a month and looked emaciated. It was scary. He has since done tons of research on food, trail diets, fats, proteins, etc. As a result, we'll be carrying a lot more food than we did the first time. The rule of thumb is a food should provide at least 100 calories per ounce. We went to Walmart the other day to pick up the non-perishables and it was strange to stand there and look for foods or flavors with the highest calories and fats, but you need that when you are burning as many calories as you do on the trail.",,View Entry,"Apr 22, Thu",0
Happy Feet and CoffeeBean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635717,"We continue checking over gear. Last night we went through our medical kit to make sure we had enough of everything. Added moleskin this trip in case of blisters. I swear by the Injinji toe socks, so I really didn't have a lot of problems with blisters last hike, but CoffeeBean did. He is going to give the toe socks a shot.I have a new backpack - Zpack Arc Haul. It's extremely light, which I love, but last night I was trying to adjust it and was having trouble making it fit just right. I am used to the fit of the Osprey, which really covers your whole back and is several pounds heavier. I found a video on Zpack's site showing how to adjust the Arc Haul. I will go over it again tonight and see if I can make it work. ",,View Entry,"Apr 27, Tue",0
Happy Feet and CoffeeBean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636092,"On Friday, my awesome co-workers threw me a retirement/""when are we rid of you?"" party! Everyone brought in goodies and we shared stories and laughed and laughed. Rhonda made these fantastic and creative cupcakes with trees and AT signs on them and painted this gorgeous camping picture. I was also presented with a silver fork engraved with ""I'm done 2021"". Stick a fork in me, I'm done! Earlier I had been given a silver carbiner with a compass on it and a medallion that read ""SDMS 2021"". It only weighs 1.3 ounces so it made the weight cut and hangs proudly on my pack! :) (You can see pictures under the ""Photos"" link.)
I just finished Permethrian-ing (a new word just created by me) our boots, pants, shirts, gaiters, packs, and hats. Trying hard to keep the ticks and mosquitoes off for as long as I can.
Next up is assembling our food bags. We have laid out everything for each meal and will put the dinners in one bag and lunch and breakfast in another. There's a lot of food! (Wonder how much a mule costs? Can you bring a mule on the AT? I'll have to check into that.) I am in charge of carrying the bag containing snacks, protein bars, Clif bars, etc. It comes in at 6.3 pounds. I'm OK with that because I get first dibs on the Paydays. Worth the sacrifice!",,View Entry,"May 02, Sun",0
Happy Feet and CoffeeBean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636299,"So today was my last day working with the best bunch of co-workers and cohorts a person could ask for. It was a sad day and a happy day. I will miss these folks more than I can say. I sent out an email with a link to this blog so they can follow/stalk me on our hike.
My assistant principal said that I couldn't leave without one last fire drill. And I got to pull the alarm! Then I got to call the code green! Small things amuse small minds, I've been told. The afternoon brought terrible thunderstorms with strong winds and horizonal rain. There was even hail! All I could think was ""Please don't let it be like this tomorrow.""
At the end of the day, I gave the afternoon announcements beginning with ""Please excuse this interruption for my last afternoon announcements."" I heard a bunch of ""Ahhh""s. Shortly after that, a friend came up and sang a goodbye song to me over the intercom. It was really moving.
It was hard to leave after that and I hung around with a bunch of the office staff laughing and telling stories. My boss has offered to hike with us and give us ""brilliant"" ideas on how to do things better. Other than that he probably won't be much use, so he has been given the trail name of ""Dead Weight"".
Finally came home and did one more pack shakedown. My final pack weight, with food and water, is 32.2 lbs. CoffeeBean's pack weight is 38 lbs.",,View Entry,"May 04, Tue",0
Happy Feet and CoffeeBean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636377,"Woke up at 6:20 and we both took long luxurious showers. Kenz had asked for homemade waffles but David wanted something less sugary and more filling. I was so anxious that I only got a bite of cereal in me and I was sick to my stomach. David had his oatmeal and an English muffin with jelly. 
We heard a noise in the garage and saw Megan coming in the kitchen door with that 4-legged fluff ball, Mando! Megan got up at 3:30 this morning and left at 4:30 so she could say goodbye before we left. We were so surprised and happy. She and Kenz had been planning this surprise.
We took some pictures of us all geared up and some with the girls. I flushed the toilet a couple times just to enjoy the sound of indoor plumbing once more.  Said goodbye to Mando and Indy the snake (she wasn’t impressed) and then climbed in the car. David drove us to rt 250 and after lots of hugs and kusses we started our walk into Shenandoah National Park at 9:45am.
Shortly into the park we had to fill out a tag with info about us and how long we would be in the park. One copy was hung on David’s pack and the other 2 went back into the box there (It’s the govt. Gotta have everything in triplicate.)
The trail really wasn’t bad as far as ups and downs. At one point I was in the lead and looked down to check my footing and walked straight into a pointed branch from a downed tree. Thank God for glasses! It knocked my glasses askew and bruised above my eye a little. I hope the Lord reminds me of this next time I complain about having to wear glasses. It definitely would have gouged my eye!
We continued on and occasionally had mists of rain with the wind so it kept us cool.
We passed 2 sets of 2 hikers. Both were doing section hikes.
With the extra weight put on during the pandemic and not having gone to the gym in a year, we were really hurting. We both struggled and stopped more often to rest.
We arrived at the Calf Mountain Shelter about 3:15 and had lunch. We were starving! BBQ flavored tuna fish with avocado wrapped in a tortilla. Sounds disgusting but absolutely delicious if you’re starving!
We filled our water bottles from the pipe spring by the shelter. Decided to camp here tonight because the next shelter is 13 miles and there’s very little water. We also didn’t want to push it too much our first day. It’s extremely windy snd the temperature is dropping. Time to hunker down.
On our previous hike we picked upa great tip from another hiker. He always brings a large lawn and leaf bag to put his pack in. It keeps it dry if it rains and he would also throw gear in it he was done using. This was he never left gear behind. We got brought bags and as we were putting our packs in them realized we picked up the scented ones. They smell great. Just hope the bears don’t think so too.
We only did 7.5 miles today. ","Afton Mtn outside SNP

Happy Feet and CoffeeBean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636624,"Yesterday during the day was pretty humid so we are getting stinky already. We have definitely entered into Stinkyville! In fact, I made this great DIY water bottle holder to hang on my shoulder pad. The only problem is when I lift the bottle I can smell myself. “Take a drink and get a whiff of stink.”The night was unbelievable windy and cold. Even though I checked all the sleeping pads before we left, I think mine has a slow leak because I spent much of the night on the cold ground. I pulled my fleece on during the night but couldn't find my socks. So it was a cold night for me. David said he was cold too. The morning was chilly but the wind had finally abated. We didn't get out and moving until about 7:30am.
We had our bagels and cream cheese for breakfast. Not quite the same taste when the bagels are cold. We drank Instant Breakfast with powdered milk. Just add water. That was actually very good. I was only able to get about half the bagel down. 


We left at 9:15am. It was still cool in the beginning so I kept my fleece on and we both wore our gloves. It eventually warmed up enough that we were down to short sleeves. 


A lot of ups today or at least it seemed that way. We are still struggling and having to rest often. Can’t wait until we have our hiking legs!


We had our first trail magic today! We had crossed Skyline Drive and had walked a short way when we saw about a dozen gallons of different drinks and a cooler with goodies! It was awesome! Found out later it was put there by Stanimals, the hiker hostel in Waynesboro. Lady Slippers and Wander Lost are the ones that did it. 


We met a thru-hiker named Sailor Jack. The Jack part of his name came from the fact that he looks like Jack Nicholson, the actor. We ended up in the same shelter, Blackrock Hut. We were joined later by Friendly Ghost, Lone Wolf, and much later Foxtrot.


After a hot dinner, we decided to sleep in the shelter. Rain is due tomorrow so we won’t have to pack up a wet tent. 


David mentioned that he had been talking to Kenz about bringing a Jack Reacher book. (He has really gotten into that series.) He said he was going to read a page and then tear it out and throw it in a campfire. That way the book would get lighter as he went. Kenz was appalled and said tearing or burning a book was almost sacrilegious! David thought that was pretty funny. He didn’t bring his book. 


We hiked 13.9 miles today.","
",Blackrock Hut,"May 06, Thu",13.90
Happy Feet and CoffeeBean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636625,"We spent the night in the shelter because it’s calling for rain today and we didn’t want to have to put away a wet tent. Ghost and Lone Wolf headed out first followed by Foxtrot. Sailor Jack was the last to leave. I think they were all going to pull a 22 mile day to get to the shelter after next. They are quick hikers!There was a whippoorwill that sat outside the shelter last night. He was really close and loud! He continued his song all night, but slowly moved farther away. At 3:00am, David said he could still hear it.
Breakfast was cold bagels, cream cheese, and Instant Breakfast again. Trying to get rid of the weight of the bagels and cream cheese. We have decided not to do that again. I don’t know if I can stomach a bagel for a while. David says a bagel not being toasted just isn’t the same.


We left at 9:20am. We are pretty tired not having slept well last night. No matter where we land tonight we are sleeping in our tent and taking a sleeping pill. The rain started about 11am and was pretty much a steady drizzle. The wind made it really miserable. We met our first flip-flopper! Cubbie started at Harpers Ferry. We also met Traveler. She was quite chatty and very nice.
By the time we reached the Loft Mountain Campstore we were wet, cold, and exhausted. They had a laundry room so we put a bunch of our wet stuff in the dryer. We had a hard time getting warm. I put on all my clothes and was still shaking. I put my fleece shirt in the dryer to warm it and then put it back on. We really didn’t want to go back out in the cold rain. The temperature was in the low 40s. We met another thru-hiker named Grumper. We mentioned the gang we stayed with last night and he knew them all. In fact, he snd Sailor Jack had met shortly after starting in Springer. We found out that Grumper is from Lexington. The rain finally stopped about 4:30pm and we headed out again. We felt much better after resting for several ours. We passed by several deer that just looked up like ""Yo"" and went right back to eating. We hiked until about 6pm and found a stealth campsite. Grumper waved as he went by an hour later. We had a hot dinner and I packed away 3 Payday candy bars before dinner. (No comments! They were snack size!)
It is still windy and tomorrow is supposed to be cold (50s). I would love it if the hiking  was a lot of level ground like today. (That was nice but the climbs were killer!) But tomorrow is going to be some tough climbs. Embrace the suck! :)


We hiked 10.5 miles.","
",Stealth site 895.5,"May 07, Fri",10.50
Happy Feet and CoffeeBean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636765,"Woo hoo! Clean underwear day! You probably didn’t want to know that but I sure felt good about it.


We left our stealth site about 8:45am. We had taken something to help us sleep and I was gone to the world. I still felt chilled during the night and noticed in the morning that the part of the sleeping bag that is under my keester is not really thick with down. I fluffed it around so hopefully tonight I will be a little warmer. I am still sleeping in socks, buff on my head, shirt, fleece shirt, and my puffy jacket. 


Today was alot of ups. Those really slow you down. We met Leap when we stopped at Pinefield Hut for water. He’s from NC. Super nice guy. 


We were getting close to crossing Skyline Drive when I noticed a small teepee of sticks on the side of the trail. Underneath were a couple of Mountain Dew sodas, 2 oatmeal pies, and some Reese cups. Trail magic! We split a pie and soda and each had a Reese cup. That kind of thing really lifts your spirits!


We got to Hightop Hut and met a group of ladies that were just camping for the weekend. Yesterday when we had left the Loft Mtn campstore and started hiking again, at the same time they were hunkered down in a horrible hailstorm with gusting winds. They said it was really frightening. So weird for the weather to be that different when you are probably 10 miles or less apart. 


We chatted, got water, and decided to finish climbing Hightop Mountain. That way tomorrow we can start the day going downhill for once. We found a stealth campsite for the night. Had mashed potatoes again for dinner. Yum! David adds a little packet of olive oil to our dinners to increase the calories. We also split a pulled pork packet and put it on tortillas. Life is good! One important thing we have noticed is the water sources, or lack of. Other than the huts, water along the trail has been scarce. Hikers this summer are going to have it rough. 


Today we did 11.6 miles. Too many ups to do more.","Stealth campsite

Happy Feet and CoffeeBean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636766,"Happy Mother’s Day to all the wonderful moms and moms-to-be!


Will it ever be warm? The wind is blowing (again!) though I did expect that since we are at the summit. I heard it sprinkle for a bit but today is just supposed to be cloudy. No rain. It should start warming up around 10am so we are taking it slow. Hike your own hike. That is the saying on the trail. 


We left about 10:20am. Over the course of the day we traversed Hightop Mountain and Saddleback Mountain, and passed by the Lewis Mountain Campground to reach the Bearface Mountain Hut, where we are staying tonight. 


Every shelter/hut we have stayed at always had a trail off the AT. This one you could see the roof of the hut as you walked past, but then you had to hike .3 miles down a fire road to get to it. All the tent sites around it are up the hill. Since our tent is a 3-man we need a little bigger site. We are about .1 up the hill from the hut. Of course to get to the privy we have to walk back down to the hut and then back up the road aways. As if we haven’t hiked enough today and are already tired. Oh well. 


Tomorrow we hike to Big Meadows Wayside for hamburgers!! Woo hoo! Can’t wait!


A shout out to my awesome co-workers for the amazing carbiner they gave me when I retired. It is working amazingly well holding my water bottle. And the little compass always tells me which way I am going. That’s good because I don’t have them here to tell me where to go. :)


We hiked 11.9 miles.","Stealth campsite 
",Bearface Mountain Hut,"May 09, Sun",11.90
Happy Feet and CoffeeBean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636836,"We were the last out of Bearface Hut this morning, leaving about 9:10am. The hiking was a lot if level ground. We did scale Lewis Mountain though. 


Word was out to hit the Big Meadows Wayside for hamburgers so that was our goal for lunch. We got there about 2pm only to find out the grill wouldn’t open until late May. We had to walk .4 miles off the trail to get there and then back again. Almost a mile and no hamburgers! We did split a small sub, chips, and a chocolate milk. We also picked up some resupply. 


We were told we could get hamburgers at the Big Meadows Lodge. Several hikers said they were good but really pricey. As we hiked past the lodge we decided we didn’t want to make the 1 mile round trip to the lodge for a burger. We’ll hold our cravings for Front Royal. 


We ended up at a stealth campsite that overlooks a valley. All the evergreen trees remind me of broccoli florets. We ate dinner out on the rocks and watched the sun dip in the sky. Was too tired to wait for  complete sunset. Hiker midnight for us is about 7:30pm.


Tomorrow will be a tough day. We will summit Stoney Man Mountain, the tallest peak in the park at 4011 ft. 


We hiked 10.1 miles.","Bearface Mountain Hut
",Stealth campsite ,"May 10, Mon",10.10
Happy Feet and CoffeeBean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636838,"Last night we were just about asleep and 2 hoot owls decided to have a “conversation” right outside our tent. We were able to stand it about 5 minutes and then David started cawing like a crow. After that, complete silence. Haha


Well, we finally got our butts out of bed at a good time and were on the trail bright-eyed and bushy-tailed by 8:00am.  The campsite was nice and the view was awesome. Still windy at night but it stopped about midnight and the morning was nice. 


We climbed the 2 highest peaks in the park today. It was strange climbing Stony Man Mountain though because we hiked up the trail from the trailhead. Then we came to a junction with a blue blaze to the left to go to the summit and a white blaze to the right for the AT. So we basically went around the base of the mountain instead of up and over the top. Never had that happen before. The AT always makes us go up and over. 


But we were paid back when we hit the Pinnacle. That was a bear to climb. David and I both noticed that it is getting easier to climb though. We aren’t gasping for breath as badly as the first day. Yay!The park is beautiful but it's not very back country. We have yet to spend a night or day without hearing or seeing cars and the road. It really takes away from the trail.
We smashed all kind of records today! Earliest start (8am), longest hiking time (9.5 hrs), and drumroll please, 13.5 miles! Our mileage is finally increasing.","Stealth campsite 
",Stealth campsite ,"May 11, Tue",13.50
Happy Feet and CoffeeBean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637055,"This morning was freezing! The wind was blowing (of course!) and we were too cold to eat. David did not sleep well again. He says whenever he looks over at me I am dead to the world. His sleeping bag is a mummy type and when he zips it all the way up it is a little claustrophobic. But if he doesn’t zip it up, he freezes. I guess when I have to choose between claustrophobia and warmth, I choose warmth! Lol


So we packed up, declared we would never stealth camp on a ridge again, and headed out. Decided we would eat breakfast later. It was 8:05am. 


About half a mile from our site was a view called Mary’s Rock. Even though we were cold, we climbed the .1 mile up and was not disappointed. You could see for miles! I believe I read that the town below was Luray. But you could see miles all around it. 


We continued down until we got to Byrd’s Nest #3 Hut. It was very nice and the spring was right near the hut. No walking half a mile to get water! We heated water and had a breakfast of oatmeal, hot chocolate (for me), and coffee (for David). (It was instant Starbucks, but to him it was heaven.) We also met hikers Beefstew and Kadunk. 


We hiked out and a short while later stopped to take off our heavy shirts. (Now my family and friends are going to enjoy the next little happenings.) So while at the hut, I used the privy. Now let me explain about the privies in SNP. They are called mouldering privies. That means that you don’t throw anything in that cannot break down. The microorganisms cause the stuff in it to decay. To help it along they ask you to throw in a cup of wood shavings after each use. So when we stopped I yanked down my drawers to see what was hurting me. Unknown to me I got one of those tiny shavings in my underwear. It was scratching me. David said he didn’t want anymore buttpaste problems. After putting myself back together David handed me my hat and then said “What’s that?” There on my hat was birdshit!! Seriously??!! A bird had flown over and pooped on my head! Thank God for the hat!


Later that day David was looking down and walked under a tree that was not quite high enough for him to pass under. He took off a nice chunk of skin on the top of his head. We are definitely going to need more medical stuff when we go in for resupply. Between injuries and blisters and hot spots on our feet, we are just about out of everything in our med kit. 


We stopped at Elkwallow Wayside. David had milk and Hostess cupcakes. I went  more for the junk food. Mini powdered donuts and potato chips. What a combo! 


We then continued our upward climb. We found a stealth site with another hiker named Chippin’ Away. She is 4 months shy of my age. David says that so far we are the oldest hikers we have come across on the trail.


We are looking forward to Front Royal! We’ll leave SNP and be in Front Royal on Friday!!


We hiked 11.4 today.","Stealth campsite 
",Stealth campsite ,"May 12, Wed",11.40
Happy Feet and CoffeeBean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637056,"Woo hoo! We’ve hiked 100 miles in 9 days. When we hiked in 2019, I know we were new to all this, but it took us 19 days to do 100 miles. So we’re pretty happy with our progress. 


We shared a stealth site with Chippin’ Away. Great conversation. She went to bed by 7pm and we were dozing by 8:30pm. In the middle of the night we heard some crashing around by her tent and pans clanking and I heard her say “Shoot!”. She was up and gone by the time we got up and left at 8:05am. About a 1/2 mile down we found a water source by this cute little cabin. It was all locked up (as was the privy) but we were told later that the park rents out little cabins like this. Very out of the way and quiet. After getting water, we were on the trail by 8:30. 


We had several ups but not bad. Alot of the day was pretty level so we put in some good miles. 


After a while we saw Chippin’ Away taking a break on a log. We stopped to chat and she apologized if she woke us during the night. She had the funniest story. She said she got up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and left her tent unzipped. She said that she has camped and backpacked for years and never had a problem doing that. When she got back in her sleeping bag and zipped up her tent she heard a scratching noise. She looked over and there was a mouse. She unzipped the tent and tried to hold the door down to the ground so the little critter could get out but it ran over to the corner where her pack was. She was afraid it would start chewing on her pack so she picked the pack up and threw it out the door! That was all the clanging noise! The mouse finally ran out too! We all had a good laugh over that!


We met Easy Goin’ again. He was coming from the Gravel Springs Hut with a trash bag full of trash left in the bear box. We felt bad that he had to carry out trash that hikers were too lazy to carry out themselves. Easy Goin’ is a TrailRunner and works for the PATC  (Potomac Appalachian Trail Club) which is supported by the ATC. He works April to September. He said all sorts of people work this seasonal job. His predecessor had been a PHD in quantum physics!


We stopped at a stream to filter water and Chippin’ Away stopped by a few minutes later. She said she was done for the day and was looking for a stealth site and we were welcome to join her again. As we sat at the stream talking, I saw a deer watching us from up the path. It slowly walked down the path until it was about 20 feet away and then it slowly wandered off the path into the woods. It never seemed the least concerned about us being there. 


Chippin’ Away left first and we saw her up the trail about 10 minutes later. She had found a beautiful, large, flat site. We definitely would have taken her up on her offer if it had been later but it was only 4:30. We thought we would hike at least another hour and then camp. We thanked her for her offer and hiked on.


We started looking for a site by 5:30 and, of course, couldn’t find one. We kept hiking and passed the SNP northern boundary and the 100 mile mark! It was a rock scramble down out of the park. SNP wanted to make sure you wouldn’t forget it, I guess. 


Never did find a stealth site but got to the Tom Floyd Shelter instead. Met hiker NoName from Wisconsin and had a great conversation. Dinner was a freeze dried Mountain House meal and a snack-size Payday for dessert. We decided to sleep in the shelter so we wouldn’t have to pack up the tent in the morning. Also the tent sites were a ways down the hill from the shelter and water was 1/4 mile downhill. Thank God we watered up earlier. 


We only have 3.3 miles to hike tomorrow!

Happy Feet and CoffeeBean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637453,"The alarm was set for 6am but we were both awake before then. So excited to get into town, shower, eat real food, do laundry, and to see our daughter.
We said “See ya later” to NoName and headed out about 7:10. There was a trolley that would pick you up where the AT crosses hwy 522 at 9:20am for $.50. We got to the road by 9am and waited, but no trolley. We crossed the road do we were going in the direction we wanted to go and I put my thumb out. About 2 minutes later a truck pulled over and a nice young man named Whitney gave us a ride into town. (David says I have a golden thumb.) Whitney is a bartender and works at the Front Royal Brewing Restaurant and Bar. He also asked if we had heard about the pipeline hack. We told him we hadn’t and he told us about hackers shutting down the pipeline between TX and NY and people were losing their mind, like with toilet paper during the pandemic. 


Whitney dropped us at the laundromat and we said our goodbyes and offered to help with gas and he said he never takes money from thru-hikers. His payment is to hear our stories. 


In the laundromat we used the bathroom to change out of dirty clothes. I put on my Frog Togs and David had some clean camp clothes. Everything else went into the washing machine. Both our phones were almost dead and our power bank had no charge so I walked over to the Visitor’s Center to see if I could charge my phone there. 
We did a washup in the bathroom, put on clean clothes, and walked down to find a coffee shop. On the way down Main Street (a very cute and quaint-looking street) we took pictures if the various murals painted on the sides of buildings.


After coffee we walked up to the Burger King and had lunch. Showtime, HoneyBear and a friend were heading in too. 


Mackenzie and Mando (Megan’s puppy) pulled into the Burger King and there were hugs all around. Kenz drove us to Walmart  to resupply. After dropping our stuff at the motel and taking showers, we went to Panda Express for dinner. We ran over to Target to get Mando some dog food. 


A funny thing about Mando and the motel. David went in and registered us at the motel and Kenz and I stayed in the car trying to figure out how to sneak in Mando. We were discussing all kinds of ideas and then Kenz said to just wait a minute and then for me to come in. She took Mando and just walked past the front desk like she owned the place. David was coming out and she said to him “Excuse me, sir. Would you hold the door for me please?”  David just played along. Kenz is one cool customer! LOL!


After dinner we sent her and the pup on their way home and we went up and just laid on the bed and relaxed. Resupply days are exhausting!


Something else I have noticed is my eyes are swelling. Kenz reminded me that I mentioned it happening on our first hike too. I think the change in diet and the freeze-dried meals being higher in sodium are causing my eyelids and the skin around my eyes to swell. It will eventually go away. Until then I will have to get used  to looking like a bug. 


Today was a nero day (near zero) since we only hiked 3.7 miles.","Tom Wolfe Shelter 
",Front Royal ,"May 14, Fri",3.70
Happy Feet and CoffeeBean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637454,"Woke up this morning about 7:30am. It was hard to leave that soft, warm bed even to go to the bathroom. David left it up to me whether to take a zero day or get back on trail. The little toes on both feet were blistered pretty badly and putting them into boots was really painful. I was able to cut the nail on my right little toe halfway off but the part remaining was causing me a lot of pain. I went and sat in a hot tub to soak my achy muscles and toes. I was then able to get the rest of the nail off. I decided we should go ahead and get back on trail or I might not get back on at all. 


David and i spent the next 30-45 minutes wrapping blisters and hot spots on our toes. I bandaged the 2 little toes thickly. I also made sure that I left the bootlaces looser by the toe box of each boot, hoping that would give the piggies more room. 


I had stuffed some of our resupply into reusable bags from the car and forgot to give them back to Kenz. Wasn’t going to carry them to Maine so I had to leave them there. I was bummed because one bag was a favorite that I got from my sister who works at Wegmans. I’ll have to hit her up for another one. 


I also had Kenz bring me my long-sleeved UV shirt. I’ve already had some sunburn on my arms and back of my neck so now I almost always wear my hat so my face and neck are protected. I put the shirt on and my left arm immediately started itching. I pulled it off and saw my usual summertime buddy - poison ivy! Arghh! I had planned for it, though and pulled out my Rx cream that the doctor had prescribed a few years ago that works wonders. And so the fight begins!


We left the motel and walked down to the CVS. I was hoping they carried a particular kind of knee brace. Chippin’ Away had one on each knee and swore by them. CBS didn’t have them so we headed to opposite corner to hitch a ride back to the trail. We had waited about 5 minutes or so and saw a car in the turn lane making a U-turn and pull over to pick us up. They were going in the other direction but were glad to take us to the trail. She asked if we had had the vaccine and we both said we were fully covered. 



>span class=""s1""> We got on the trail about 12:40 and started hiking. My toes definitely let me know they were there but I kept going. 


About 5:45 we came to a tent site. It was pretty large and flat and even had a fire pit. We had just gotten the tent up, I was inflating the sleeping pads and David was starting dinner when a guy came ip the trail towards us and said that he had stashed his camping gear here and would we mind if he took the site below ours. We welcomed him and went back to our dinner and tent prep when another couple guys came up and asked if they could camp here too and that 3 more of their party were coming. The more the merrier! It ended up with us and 6 other guys. They were very nice but definitely weekend campers. They didn’t know that 9:00pm is hiker midnight and were still gathered around quietly chatting past then. We were pooped though and dozed off. When we had gotten into camp I was aching from the waist down - my quads, my knees, my toes, my right heel. David gave me a couple Aleve and that helped me nod off too. 


We could hear the traffic from I-66 and, boy, was it loud at times. There was a train too. The car traffic eventually quieted abut the train came through several times. Just enough that I heard it but not enough that it kept me awake.


So getting on the trail later and only hiking 5 hours, we were still able to crank out 7.9 miles.","Front Royal

Happy Feet and CoffeeBean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637455,"The alarm went off at 6:20am but we both had woken before that and just laid there. This was the first time that I had not gone to sleep wearing a shirt, a fleece shirt, and sometimes my puffy coat. I actually took off my fleece during the night and only slept in my light cotton shirt and sleep pants. The morning was nice too. Not cold like it has been. If it weren’t for the traffic on 66....
We were packed, fed, and on the trail by 7:30am. The hiking today wasn’t bad. The Aleve last night had done the trick and I was feeling great. I think my nail-less toe had healed enough that I was having no pain. Yay!


We went along at a good speed, hoping to get to a shelter before the rain started around noon. And we did! We walked i to Whiskey Hollow Shelter just as it started to sprinkle. Fort Chagos joined us a few minutes later and we sat and listened to the rain and felt the temperature drop. We all put on layers to stay warm. 


Fort Chagos has a gps system that he is using to map parts of the AT. He does this as a hobby and then uploads the data to a website that apps like Alltrails and Guthook use. Pretty cool. 


Another hiker named Mark joined us to to wait out the rain. 


My family does monthly zoom calls and we had enough data coverage to be able to call in. I didn’t want to impose on the other hikers so David and I walked back to the privy, since it has a roof too, to call in. The family was quite amused that we were calling from the privy. I told them it was apropos. :) We only stayed on for a bit before my phone started to die but it was so fun to see all of them. 


We decided to stay here for the night since the rain didn’t really quit until 4:30. We didn’t want to hike for a couple miles and then set up on wet ground. Mark had hiked on by the time we had gotten back from our zoom call and Fort Chagos had set up his tent up the hill.


Pickles and Fire Daddy came in about 5:15 pm and set up a tent. (They are still newlyweds having married just last August.) They have had several bad experiences lately in shelters (mice, rat snakes) so Pickles does not want to stay in any shelters for a while. 


We are going to stay in the shelter and have set our alarm for 6:00am. We hope to put some good miles in tomorrow. We will be hitting a section called “The Rollercoaster” because it is 14 miles of steep ups and downs. 


Every place they camp, Fire Daddy builds a campfire because that is how they cook their dinner. Fire Daddy said that they weighed propane and the cooker and it was over a pound so they just decided to cook each night via campfire. Pickles put water in their pot and Fire Daddy would put it in the hot coals to heat. We would eat only cold meals if we had to do that.  We are not very good at fires.

It turned out we were the only ones in the shelter. We had it all to ourselves. It was cold though. 
We didn’t get going until 7:45am. The .3 out of the shelter was up, of course. Fort Chagos had left about 30 minutes before us. Pickles and Fire Daddy were still dead to the world. 


We hiked through Sky Meadow State Park and it had some beautiful meadows. We stopped several times just to enjoy the scenery and the quiet. We figured this was the calm before the storm, of the Rollercoaster. 


By 12:45pm we had hiked 9 miles. We watered up at the next stream and then began the ascent to the Rollercoaster. 


Holy moly!! Hiking this section is definitely a challenge! It’s 13.5 miles long. We are exhausted. We stopped at a tent site 5 miles in. 


It was a good day though because we hiked 13.6 miles in about 10 hours. Tomorrow will be another long day but we will finish the Rollercoaster AND hit the VA-WV border!","Whiskey Hollow Shelter 
",Stealth campsite ,"May 17, Mon",13.60
Happy Feet and CoffeeBean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637459,"It was cold this morning but we got up when the alarm went off at 6am. I felt really tired. More tired than I have since we started. We watch hikers go by that have now clocked 1000 miles (having started in GA) and they do these hills like they’re nothing. After 2 weeks we are starting to notice a difference and are getting better but still struggling. Waiting for our “hiking legs” to kick in. We’re not gasping for breath uphill as much either. 


My eyes looked like little balloons again. Gotta come up with a different diet plan for me. The sodium is killing me. 


After a cold breakfast of cereal for David and Instant Breakfast for me, we set out at 7:35am. There was more Rollercoaster to ride. About 9 miles worth. I find that listening to an audio book on the uphills makes it a little easier so I queued up my book and strapped in. 


So up and down we climbed. We came to an outlook called Bear’s Rocks. It was beautiful and the breeze was really welcome. David perspires heavily on a normal warm day. Put 38 pounds on his back and make him climb 45 degree angle climbs and his shirt is soaked. I don’t perspire nearly that much and my shirt was wet too. We took a breather and enjoyed the view for a few minutes. I called Megan (while I had phone coverage) and she was working in the organic garden on George Mason University. She was telling me that she learned that poison ivy is not symmetrical. One side of the leaf is jagged edged and the other side has a smooth edge. You would think I would know exactly what it looks like as much as I have it, but I have the hardest time identifying it. Just “leaves of three”. There’s a lot of 3-leaved plants in the woods. 


We got to Snickers Gap and had to cross the 4-lane highway 7. Boy, that is a busy road. Felt like we were playing a game of Frogger (“Animal Crossing” for those too young to know about “Frogger”).


VA Rt 7 at Snickers Gap goes into a town called Bluemont. (It used to be called Snickersville but they changed the name to Bluemont to entice the Washingtonians to come there.). There were a lot of great reviews of Bluemont and the Horseshoe Curve Restaurant and Grill on Guthook but we just wanted to get out of the Rollercoaster. Only 4 more miles of Rollercoaster!


So off we went and 2 miles later we hit the WV-VA state line. The AT kind of jumps back and forth across that line for the next few miles but we will be in WV soon. 


Two miles later we hit the end of the Rollercoaster. There wasn’t a snazzy sign like at the southern end but it was still the end. I guess as a treat and reward for making it through, the following miles were through beautiful woods of green grasses and fairly level walking. 


One thing I have to say for the Rollercoaster is there were beautiful and plentiful stealth sites. That was great!


We finally got to our destination of the Blackburn Trail Center. We read of an organic farm nearby that was also a hostel for AT hikers. We called them from the center and waited for their car. While we waited we wandered around at Blackburn. It has a big house with a screened in porch for PATC employees to stay at. There is also a cabin for AT hikers and a solar shower. The grounds were beautiful with lots of chairs and picnic tables and a great view. We also scored some hot chocolate packs and Starburst candy from the hiker box. 


A truck arrived and a gentleman named Ish and his young daughter, Gabriella, picked us up. 
We drove past the Stoneybrook Market and around the corner to their farm. (They also have a bakery, deli, and tree service.) We were greeted warmly by Lydia and shown our cabin (that could easily hold 4). Up the hill a short walk is the cabin with showers, toilets, and laundry. A short walk from that cabin is the main house. 


I showered quickly and David washed up and put on a clean shirt then we went down for dinner. Even though it was close to 8pm, they had a hot meal waiting for us. I had Spanish rice with vegetables and an amazing salad. David had greens with his rice. I ate like it was my last meal. Probably not very lady-like. They told us about the farm and answered all our questions. They told us their philosophy and said that they met for prayer every day at 7am and 6pm and we were welcome to join them or not. 


We went back to our cabin and by 9pm were both out!


We hiked 12.7 miles today and in about 11 hours.","Stealth campsite
",Stonybrook Farm,"May 18, Tue",12.70
Happy Feet and CoffeeBean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637666,"We decided that we really needed a true zero day (no miles hiked) and Stoneybrook Organic Farm was the perfect place. 


We woke up about 7:30am and got up to breakfast about 8:15am. They had decided in morning gathering that everyone would go down to the garden and help plant lettuce before breakfast. So we all trooped down, even the kids as young as 2 yrs old, and planted seedlings of different types of lettuce. With the many hands helping it took no time at all. 
After helping cleanup breakfast (even the young kids had jobs of sweeping the floor or wiping down tables), we headed back to our cabin and got our dirty clothes and headed up to the laundry cabin. 


Let me tell you about the sleeping cabins. There are 3 and they each can hold up to 4 people. We had a fruit basket with 2 giant homemade peanut butter cookies in it waiting for us in our cabin (#2) when we arrived last night. There was a pretty pot of flowers on the steps to the cabin. The beds had mattresses and linens already made up. We were the only hikers they had that day. 
At lunch we had the most amazing pizza and salad. We had s choice of pizza with cheese and beef or one that was all vegetable. I had a slice of each. The salad was made up of at least 4 different types of lettuce and greens. The dressing was a light vinaigrette. 


After lunch we worked with Yeremiah to plant paw-paw bushes around their campground. He said they have a festival in the fall that all the town comes to (“Festival of the Boots”) and he wanted to make the campground nicer. He had also planted some elderberry bushes and fall producing golden raspberries. The plantings would all produce in the fall so the kids could run around and pick fresh fruit. 


We learned several techniques when planting trees. One was to spread out the roots of the tree from the root ball. While in a pot, a tree’s roots will grow in a circle around the pot. You want to spread them out when you put the tree in the hole you’ve dug, so the roots will grow out and not strangle itself. The second trick is called “mudding”.  After spreading out the roots you start to shovel dirt in the hole then you pour in a bucket of water. You take a stick and poke into the muddy water to release the air bubbles around the roots. Otherwise air may get trapped around the roots and they’ll dry out. We were really impressed by what we learned and enjoyed giving back to our hosts by helping out. 


After planting, the kids all went down to the pond for a swim. We declined the offer and instead went back to our cabin to clean up and write out a postcard to our niece, Kaitlyn. 


At 6pm, the horn blew 2 times to signal the evening gathering. We joined them in song, dance, discussion of the Bible, and prayer. We then all sat down for a dinner of salad and broccoli with cream sauce on a bed of rice. We often drank a delicious tea from Brazil. I would add milk (fresh from the cow) and honey (from their bee hives). 


We went to bed by 9pm knowing we would be leaving this peaceful and relaxing place to hit the trail in the morning.","Stoneybrook Farm

I must have listened for half an hour just to make sure they weren’t getting closer. Luckily they didn’t. 


We had a good breakfast of quinoa and scrambled eggs mixed. It was delicious! David asked permission to take pictures and snapped a few of the wonderful people there. 


We waited for our ride back to the trail.  Ish came and picked us up and drove us back to Blackburn Trail Center. David cleaned out the hiker box of Starburst candy and off we went. It was .4 uphill to the trail from the center but we were rested and in good spirits so it wasn’t bad. We got back on the AT about 10am. 
We finally found a campsite and it was directly across from the sign that read “WV-VA BORDER”. We weren’t very far off the trail but we were tired.

Happy Feet and CoffeeBean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637799,"David got up for his usual 2am pee break when he saw a bouncing white light in the forest. His first thought was “What the heck is that?”. He noticed the bouncing light was getting closer and then realized it was a hiker. The guy had his headlamp on and was looking for the WV/VA border sign. David pointed it out to him. Tight across from where we were camped. He was starting the 4-state challenge. (This is where you hike through 4 states in 24 hours. It’s a 44 mile hike to get through VA, WV, MD, and then to PA.)


We got up when the alarm went off at 6am. There was a nice breeze still blowing. (It had started the night before and really cooled things down.) We had eaten breakfast and packed up the tent and were finishing up packing our backpacks. A hiker came down the trail southbound. Super friendly and chatty. He mentioned that he had retired the Friday before and got in his RV on Monday to continue section hiking the AT. (We told him about me retiring 2 weeks ago and getting on the trail the next day.) He had already hiked several of the north eastern states. He talked about how obsessed he was with hiking and with helping thru-hikers. He started rifling through his fanny pack and we thought he was going to give us some trail magic like fruit or candy. Instead he pulled out a crisp $100 bill and offered it to us. We were stunned! At first we refused but he insisted saying that he had just sold his business and done very, very well. He repeated that he was obsessed with helping thru-hikers. (I won’t give his name or trail name or any identifying info for his privacy.) He told us about his business and about being approached by Home Depot and Amazon. He was ready to retire and hike so he sold the business. We profusely thanked him and then our hiker angel went south and we headed north to Harpers Ferry. 


We hiked to the ATC (Appalachian Trail Conservancy) center but it was closed. We talked to a couple volunteers, Poptart and Samurai Blue, and they said the ATC would open next week. Samurai Blue lives in Waynesboro, PA and offered to give us a ride to resupply when we hit town. Yay!
After getting back on the trail we noticed rocks of all sizes being pulled out of the ground all along the trail. Some of these rocks were big enough that I could hardly lift them. We found out later that the bears were coming along and pulling the rocks out looking for insects and probably the tasty and rare cicada. 


We continued our journey and as it became later in the day we just knew we weren’t going to make it to the shelter unless we really hustled. We came around a bend and there was Traveler. She was slackpacking and trying to get hold of her ride but her phone was dead as was her backup battery. Who goes on a hike without a fully charged phone and backup battery?? I pulled out my power bank and she started charging her phone. Then she called her ride and they got into a 10 minute discussion on the best place to pick her up. Meanwhile the daylight hours were fading snd we had over 3 miles to go to get to the shelter. Arghh!


We finally got going again and made our own stealth campsite far off the trail. We had to clear sticks and dig out some rocks, but we got camp set up, ate noodles for dinner and then crashed.

Part of today’s journey took us through a meadow full of flowering berry bushes. Come back in July and there will be a ton of wild berries to pick! The only downside was the static hum emitted by the power lines overhead. That was unnerving to listen to. 
In the afternoon we began the climb up Stone Mountain where the first Washington monument was built in 1827.  Before we climbed up to the monument, we took a rest at the campground below. While sitting at a picnic table talking there was a BOOM so loud and close that it reverberated through us! When we climbed up towards the monument, there was another BOOM. We got to the top and saw that they were indeed shooting off a Civil War cannon. There were several re-enactors there and they were showing people about the cannon and artillery of the time. 

We hiked up and saw the original Washington Monument, built by the folks in Boonsboro, MD in 1827. We were able to climb up inside and the view at the top was really something. I don’t know that I had heard of there being another Washington Monument other than the one in DC. Love all this history!!

We got up and had breakfast and started out. First thing, going up. Maryland loves log steps. These are steps made from trees that were cut down. Sometimes the area between steps is longer so you step up and walk a couple paces and then step up again. And boy were there a ton of them!


We hiked along slowly and came to Blackrock Cliffs. It was a beautiful view and the breeze felt so good! 


We found a really nice stealth site that actually had several sites in it for tents. We set up our tent in a shady spot, without the rain canopy, so we could get the breeze when it came. We were only going to snooze for 20 minutes, but 45 minutes later.... :).  Then we had lunch and started out again. David said he felt much better but I could have slept at least another hour. 


We did have a nice surprise waiting behind a tree for us. A cooler with trail magic. We were lucky enough to get the last little bit: 2 little boxes of yogurt covered raisins and a container of cut strawberries from Sheetz. It’s amazing how that little bit of love can perk you up and give you some extra energy to go farther. 


Then we were crossing a road and a guy was sitting by his car reading. He asked if we were thru-hikers. When we said yes he offered us cold drinks and chips if we wanted them. Turn down food?? No way! He said 2 of his friends were doing the 4-state challenge just for the heck of it and he was waiting for them to cross this point.  It was delicious! And another morale and energy booster!


We started to climb to Raven Rock Shelter, the last AT shelter in Maryland, and saying it was brutal is an understatement. Some of the trail was straight up and dirt so you had to be careful not to slide. Some of it was rocks. And, of course, the heat and humidity were horrible. We stopped to rest halfway up at one place that looked like it might be usable for a stealth site. We were discussing the options when Haggis stopped for a rest. We talked with him for a while and then he said he was going to push on and probably take a zero tomorrow at the shelter. The shelter was only .5 miles a way. David and I talked some more and decided we had .5 mile left in us. Even if it was straight up. 


But once we got to the ridge!! Beautiful level ground with ferns growing everywhere. We passed Haggis taking a breather and told him we would see him at the shelter. 


We found the shelter and it was really pretty. We were afraid it might be full but there were only 3 people in the shelter and a couple tents. Some of the sites were pads and there were benches and picnic tables too. It was really pretty. 


We set up camp and had the phone coverage to FaceTime our daughter. We chatted for a while and I changed into my camp clothes. While checking my pants pockets I noticed that the small stone I had been carrying since Springer, GA was gone. (It’s a tradition that you carry a stone and then put it on Mount Katahdin when you summit.) I was pretty upset that I lost it after all this time. Oh well. 


Rain is called for tomorrow but we are going in for resupply. We texted Samurai Blue and he is going to meet us at PenMar Rd. That will put us in PA!! Crossing the Mason-Dixon line!

We had a rock scramble to go over and David fell coming down but was OK. Some of these rocks are huge and you have to hang onto your poles while using your hands to work your way over the rocks. You also have to watch how you move because of the weight on your back. It’s easy to tip one way or the other or lose your balance completely. 


We came into a beautiful park called Penmar Park. From 1877-1943 there was an amusement park on that site. There was supposed to be a museum about it at the park but we didn’t see it. Figured we would ask our ride, Samurai Blue, about it. 


We crossed the Mason-Dixon line - the border of Maryland and Pennsylvania. 
We are now in Pennsylvania, 6 states down, 8 to go. We are in Waynesboro, PA to be exact. 


We met Samurai Blue at the intersection of Penmar Rd and the AT. He has a blue Honda Odyssey the same color as ours. He hiked the trail in 2015 after retiring from the Navy. He said he would take us wherever we needed to go. Just call him. 


Samurai Blue gave us a quick tour of where things were in town near our hotel. (He was born and raised here and then returned here after retiring.) Important things like restaurants and Walmart. He drove us to the Cobblestone Hotel and we were able to check into our room early and leave our packs. He then drove us to KFC for lunch. He declined our offer to join us. Just said to call if we needed a ride to Walmart or the hotel after. We hadn’t had KFC in probably 10 years so that was our choice for lunch. After eating we decided it will probably be another 10 years before we go again. Pretty greasy. We then walked over to Walmart. It was raining slightly but we still had our rain gear on so we were OK. It was Walmart so our attire fit right in. Haha (Look up Frogg Togs. That’s what I had on with hiking boots and gaiters and a buff. I looked like I just came outta the hills. Oh, wait! I did!)


By the time we were done shopping, I was whipped. Hadn’t slept well the night before so I called Blue for a ride back to the hotel. His wife, Kathy, showed up instead and drove us over. We felt bad because the hotel was literally right behind the Walmart! But Kathy said she needed to go to Walmart anyway so it worked out well. 


We thanked Kathy again for the ride and apologized again for her having to drive us  to right behind the Walmart and then dragged all our crap up to the room. We pulled the tent and canopy out, which were soaked. I took them down to the parking lot and held them out in the wind to dry them. The breeze was damp because of the rain but at least they weren’t dripping. I took them up to the room and used the hair dryer to finish drying them. David did laundry while I worked on the tent. I washed dishes and cleaned things then took a long hot shower. David went in and soaked in the tub. Then we both relaxed. 


I had thought I won the poison ivy war but, no. It seems that I must have gotten poison ivy under my bra and now my right side was streaked with red slashes of it. I also noticed blisters of it between my fingers. Arghh!!!!


Samurai Blue mentioned that he had also picked up a hiker named Lighthouse and Lighthouse had told him about getting $100 from another hiker. We told him our story too. He said he was just amazed by it. Lighthouse said he had met 4 other people who had been gifted. One of them was Dallas, who had camped right behind us the night before.

Instant Breakfast had to be mixed with powdered milk and put into bags. Cold cereal had to be divided up into bags and powdered milk added. Then everything was put into a waterproof bag depending upon what meal it was for. 


Samurai Blue picked up Lighthouse and us. We were dropped off at Penmar Road. Picture-taking, goodbyes, and thanks all around. Samurai Blue’s only acceptable payment was that you sign his logbook. Lighthouse was a couple miles ahead of us so he was dropped off on Rt 30. 


We started out 9-ish and had several wicked uphills to climb. We didn’t stop to rest while going up so we feel like we must finally be getting stronger. 


We met a PATC Trail Runner fixing water runoff ditches on the trail. His name was Phase Two and he had been maintaining that section of trail for 15 years. He said that he got that section when the man before him retired from doing it after 40 years. The man was 90 years old when he retired from trail work! Phase Two said he loves it and they will have to take his section from him when he dies. He said that he had worked on the trail for a number of years but couldn’t relate to the hikers because he hadn’t hiked it so he began section hiking it until he had done the whole thing. Interesting man to talk to. 


Something I don’t think I’ve mentioned is our signal. Sometimes one of us has to stop, so the other will just keep hiking. If, after a bit, the other person hasn’t caught up, one of us will yell “Ca caw!”. The other person responds with a “Ca caw!” and we can gauge how far apart we are. If you need help, you “Ca caw” 3 times. So far we haven’t had to use that. Thank goodness. 


We passed through a beautiful shelter named Tumbling Run. It’s a newer shelter with 2 shelters and a pavilion between. them. The privy! It had 2 rows of toilet paper rolls and hand sanitizer and an air freshener! Primo privy! First privy I’ve seen with TP!


We ended the day at the Rocky Mountain Shelter. It was .3 miles straight down. It was actually 2 small shelters and we were the only ones in the 2nd shelter so we had it all to ourselves. I volunteered to get water. Dummy! .4 miles all the way down to the road at the bottom of the hill! And then you needed a scoop to get water. I ended up filling our platys by scooping the water into my hands and pouring it into the platy. It took a while. And then I had to hike back up.

I put on a new pair and hung the wet stinky ones off my pack to hopefully dry during the day. 


It was a tough day starting out. Neither of us was in a long-distance hiking mood. It happens. Every day can’t be sunshine and roses. Some days you just want to check into a hotel and spend the day in bed flipping through TV channels.  


It was weird that hiking the .3 out of the shelter didn’t seem to take anywhere as much time as it did last night hiking in. That was good. 


We had a couple rock scrambles to negotiate pretty early on. Welcome to PA! Once over them the trail smoothed out and it was easier going. 


We made it to Caledonia State Park (had to take a reroute from the AT because of storm damage on the trail but we covered the same number of miles). 


Yay! Flush toilets and hand dryers. David was able to dry his shirt somewhat. It took some time. Then he laid it out in the sun to finish drying. I took my socks and bandana in the bathroom and dried them quickly using the hand dryer. Of course, now the bathroom smelled like gross stinky feet. Sorry about that, campers!


David pulled out our little cookstove and made himself a cup of instant Starbucks coffee. 


After everything was dry we forced ourselves to pack up, put the rain cover on our packs, and headed out. Naturally the climb out of the park was 1000 feet up. It finally leveled out and we had some nice level ridge walking. 


We walked through a shelter called Quarry Gap and it is the gold standard of shelters. You walked through a little wooden gate with a welcome sign on it and flowers planted in a tree stump. The shelter was immaculately clean with baskets of flowers hanging from the posts and benches everywhere. There was even a swing with “Quarry Gap” carved on it! And the privy!! Flowers planted in a flower bed outside and inside was a little fan and a framed picture on the back wall and an air freshener! And the water source! Literally 10 feet down a shaded path ending in a stream with a little pool at the beginning to scoop water from. It was the cutest shelter and so clean! It was only 1:00pm so we knew we couldn’t stay and spend the night. 


While we were there swinging in the garden swing, Hippy came through. He had stayed at the Rocky Mountain Shelter with us last night and we had seen him at Caledonia State Park earlier too. He made the comment that we were the only people he had seen on the trail that actually took the time to stop and enjoy things instead of rushing through “to get miles in”. We told him that we looked at this hike as a journey not a quest. 


The sun shone and the day stayed hot and humid, so we took our pack covers off. Kind of like washing your car on a sunny day. You’re just asking for it to rain! While walking through a narrow meadow we could hear thunder overhead. We stopped and quickly put on our pack covers. It started to rain but it only lasted 5 minutes and then the sun came back out and the thunder sounded like it was moving off. We had 2.4 miles to the shelter. 


We passed by a cute little cabin and stream. The cabin is owned by the PATC and can be rented out. We hiked just past it and found a nice stealth campsite. We were both just too tired to go on. We set up the tent and I got water. The gnats were enough to drive you crazy! I pulled the netting out of my hat and looked like a beekeeper but it kept the bugs out of my eyes and ears. And then the thunder started up again. We just got our stuff in the tent and the storm hit with a vengeance! Thunder, a little lightning, and torrential rain! It poured buckets for half an hour! The waterproofing held up and we stayed dry! We took a map during the storm. Thank goodness we decided to stop and camp. We would have been caught in that storm halfway to the shelter and drenched! The sun came out again after the storm passed. Hopefully it would dry the tent. 


We ate dinner in the tent. A delicious meal of cheese filled tortillas. We had to use up the cheese. We complemented that with Wheat Thin crackers. I put some of my cheese on the crackers. Camping appetizers! We’re so fancy!

Happy Feet and CoffeeBean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638048,"Well the storm came back AGAIN last night! Three times we had to put up with thunder, lightning, and pouring rain. We had forgotten to stake out the ends of the canopy so during the lull, David ran out and did it and also put leaves along the edges of the tent to help block the rain from going under the tent. I think we came out better this morning for it. 



>span class=""s1"">

We had a cold breakfast of Instant Breakfast and cereal. We had to pack up a wet canopy. The tent wasn’t bad. A little damp on the bottom. David had put his perspiration-soaked clothes out on trees so they were wet too. He attached his shirt, pants, and underwear to the back of his pack with carabiners. I felt like I was walking behind a moving clothesline. I told him I was going to change his trail name to Laundromat. We started out from camp about 7:45am. 


We came to a road crossing with a parking area and the sun was out with a nice breeze. We unpacked everything and laid it out in the sun to dry. There was a picket fence along the road. We laid wet clothes and bags on it. We looked like we were having a yard sale!


Once we were dry again, off we went. After a bit we were approaching Tom’s Run Shelter and you had to cross a pretty little bridge before it. There were a couple of big rocks and I slipped on one. I tried to catch myself with my poles but at the angle I was falling and the weight on my back, it just dragged me down. I had to remove my pack to get up. I couldn’t move. I was more shaken up than hurt.



The morning was damp and our clothes felt damp and clammy. Such a fun feeling to put against your skin.
Our goal for the day was the ATC regional office in Pine Furnace. It has a museum and a hiker’s lounge where you can relax and recharge your electronics. There is also a store near it where you can get grilled food and some resupply. 


We made it into Pine Furnace after passing the sign that tells you that you are at the halfway point of the AT. 1090.5 miles! The store was expensive. $12.00 for a hamburger and fries. We just got some chocolate milk and a snack. Then we looked around to find the museum. A woman sitting at the table behind us said that she had volunteered at the museum for 10 years but they were having trouble getting volunteers now so it was closed. We were really disappointed! The whole day seemed like a wash. :(


We hiked out of Pine Furnace State Park and started the uphill climb. About 4:30 we decided to call it a day and found a nice stealth site. A dinner of rice with cheese and broccoli (Knorr’s Sides only $1.00) capped the day. David hung our food bags and we were chilling out by 6pm. I did notice that I had a lovely bruise on my knee from where I face planted. 


It calls for rain all day tomorrow starting at 11am so we hope to be at the James Fry Shelter by then to ride it out.

Happy Feet and CoffeeBean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638225,"We left our stealth campsite north of Pine Furnace State Park about 7:05am. For the second night in a row we had both had a really good night’s sleep. 


Rain was due today by noon so we got up and ate quickly so we could get some miles in before the rain. 


We watched the weather online when we could and the rain kept getting pushed out farther. Yay! Now it was due by 4pm. 


We were hoping to get to the Alec Kennedy Shelter before the rain. Then we started up and at the top were the most humongous rocks! We had to climb up, over, around, and even through giant rocks! I have to give it to the Cumberland Valley AT Club. They mark their trails well. In addition to numerous white blazes, especially on rock scrambles, they include big arrows too. Thanks CVATC!


Well, we had two of those to go over. There were times we probably should have taken off our packs to get through the rocks but we were lazy. There was also a point where David threw his poles up on the top rock and then I had to push him from below for him to get up. He then reached down and pulled me up. We were glad to be doing this before the rain. 


We finally got down and started up the next one toward the shelter. It was 3pm by now and the rain was due at 4pm so we started looking for a stealth site because it was still a couple miles to the shelter. 


A couple of the tentsites listed on Guthook were not where it said they were but we found one and got the tent set up. Just as we finished, it started to sprinkle. We threw everything in the tent and it began pouring. 


It poured the rest of the day, but we were able to hike 12.5 miles by 3pm. Yay for us!","Stealth campsite past Pine Furnace State Park

Inside the tent was hot and humid so our clothes were damp. We are close to Carlisle, PA so we will get a hotel there and dry out... again. Quality Inn offers hikers. $60 room for 2 and a laundry room. Sweet!


We decided to eat breakfast later at the next shelter and get going as soon as we could to outhike the additional rain coming. 


We got to the Alec Kennedy Shelter but it was .2 down and there was a nice flat tent site across the trail, so we ate breakfast there. 


We hiked into Boiling Springs and it is a quaint little town. It has a big pond in the center of town. It is so clear and clean. There were a lot of older guys fishing around it. There were some beautiful big homes around it too. 


We stopped at this diner called Caffe 101. David was hoping for a late big breakfast but they had just stopped serving breakfast. He was bummed. He is a breakfast guy. We had lunch instead. I had a chicken bacon wrap and he had a Reuben sandwich. The portions were huge. We could have split a plate! We saw 3 hikers we have been leap frogging with for the last few days: Spirit, Whippoorwill, and Defcon. They are headed to Carlisle to dry out too and staying at the same hotel. 




The temps were cool and there was a breeze so we suited up with warm clothes under our rain gear. (Later we found out that there is an actual boiling spring in town that you can see. Darn it! We missed it!)
The trail was flat but most was under the Green Tunnel so we were really warm in all our clothes, but the idea of a warm DRY bed kept us pushing on. The rain had abated for a bit but we knew more was due. At one point in our hike we came upon an old cemetery just next to the trail. The markers showed graves from the 1800’s. It had a small fence around it. The old stones were so fascinating. The way they worded things back then, giving the exact age of a person right down to the month. We got to the hotel just as it started to sprinkle. Now the work begins to dry everything out.
It took well over an hour to blow dry the tent and canopy with a hair dryer again. We pulled everything out from our packs too to try and get the dampness out of it.

We got on the trail about 10am. There were a couple of young guys getting on trail at the same time. We saw them for a second and whoosh! they were gone. Man, can those kids hike fast!



The trail continued like yesterday, very level and easy walking. It was muddy and very slippery at points though. You wouldn’t think a tree root would be slippery but, oh boy, are they. There were a lot of wooden bridges and boardwalks. It was a nice walk.
Now yesterday when we were leaving Boiling Springs, the weather was cool and there was a breeze so we put on warmer clothes under our rain gear. Then we sweat like crazy because we ended up walking in the Green Tunnel for 98% of the time. We had been told of beautiful pastures. Now today, we don’t dress as warmly (the temp was 48 degrees!) since we think we’ll be in the Tunnel again and instead are walking out in pastures. Oh well.



The pastures were beautiful. The sky was cloudy so we didn’t have to worry about sunburn. There were beautiful purple wild flowers and small daisies. Some of the field grass was up to my shoulders.
When we hiked in 2019, we spent a week hiking 80 miles in PA with 2 of our hiker friends, Braveheart and Cowboy. Today we came to the exact place where we had gotten on trail then. So the next 80 miles will be a repeat for us but thats ok. Like I said we have seen some really pretty scenery today. 


We had planned to hike to the Cove Mountain Shelter. The hike up was straight up, no switchbacks. It was exhausting. Made us think we were back in GA. We were about 2.6 miles out from the shelter when we came to a view overlooking the Susquehanna River and Duncannon and it just beautiful. It’s cold as crap and still cloudy but we couldn’t resist the idea of waking up to that view. So we set up camp. We had several hikers come by to see the view and chat. Stubbs chatted for a while and we thoroughly enjoyed his company. 



The forecast is nice weather for the next 3 days. We will hit Duncannon tomorrow and planned a while ago to stay at the Doyle Hotel there. Old hotel with a lot of history.

Happy Feet and CoffeeBean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638358,"Woke to sun Yay! and blue skies Yay! The tent however was damp from the morning dew. We took a towel and wiped it down as best we could but knew we would need to stop and dry it in the sun at some point. The view was worth it though. The sun coming up over Duncannon was beautiful and the way it sparkled on the river.
One thing I have forgotten to mention, I think, is that the Mountain Laurel are blooming. I have seen white and pink blooms. The mountains are covered with them!


Shortly after we left our camp we met Faceplant going SOBO. She had planned to backpack for 4 days but by the time that she reached our camp last night she realized that she would rather go home the next day and garden instead. So she stayed at the shelter near by and was on her way back to her car. She said her sister called and they were doing a get-together at her parents house. Her mom is 90 and her dad 93 and they live at home and stayed isolated during the pandemic. She was excited to go home and relax with family. We wished her well. 


Boy, you could tell that today was nice weather and a holiday. The trail down to Duncannon was like Grand Central Station! Luckily most people saw we were carrying heavy packs and gave us the right of way. We had a number of folks stop and talk to us about our trip. 


We thought we would eat lunch first and then decide if we really wanted to stay or to hike on (we had the unplanned stay in Carlisle 2 days before). The restaurants we approached were all closed on Monday. So we went to the nearby park and laid out the tent to dry. David walked up (yes, uphill) to the local grocery store to get some resupply. Bagless stopped by to ask me for directions to the grocery store. Said he got his name because the Trailrunner thought his food bag had been left behind and after asking all the tenters except him, took it with him. They caught up together the next day though and he got his food back. I thought it was a funny story. 



There is also a beautiful mural painted on the side of a building that shows all activities that are in and around Duncannon. I took a picture of it but it has my thumb in it so I’m not going to post it. :)
There’s an old historic hotel in Duncannon called the Doyle Hotel. It has been around longer than the Appalachian Trail. (It was built in the 1770’s and was a shopping point along the Susquehanna River. It caught fire and burnt to the ground in 1803 and was replaced by the current building. It has had several owners, finally becoming The Doyle in 1944 after Jim “Doc” Doyle won $444,444.44 in the Irish lottery. He owned and operated the hotel into the 1990’s. It is currently owned by Vickie, who is a hoot and loves to joke with the hikers.) It is a hiker tradition to stay there. For $35 (for a double), you get a bed with linen and a hot shower. The place is really, really old but the old bones are still there. In the community bathroom is an old claw-footed bathtub. I think David could have fit maybe half his body in it, it was so short. But I loved the old charm of it. It was getting chilly so David lit the little wall heater in our room. (Good thing because the huge window at the end of the hall was left open over night and it was freezing in the hallway but we were nice and toasty.)
So we were just laying on the bed. David was snoozing and I was looking at my phone when we heard someone out in the hall calling all the hikers for a public service announcement. We thought maybe it had to do with what to do in the event of a fire or tornado, but, no. All the doors opened and there was a guy saying that Trail Angel Mary had dinner ready at her place and we all needed to get over there and eat or he was going to get in trouble. Haha  The others hikers said that they had already eaten and even though we had had a snack not long before, we weren’t going to pass up the opportunity to meet the famous Mary. (A movie was made about trail angels. The filmmaker surveyed hikers to find out who the top 4 Trail Angels were and Mary was one of them. We’re going to check the movie out when we get home.)


We hustled over to Mary’s place, which is over The Pub (bar and grill). We sat down to GIANT racks of pork ribs, potato salad, coleslaw, baked beans, and a baked corn dish. In addition to Mary, there were also Just Greg, Matthewski (the guy who came to get us) and Jester (a triple crowner - meaning that he has thru-hiked the AT, the PCT (Pacific Crest Trail), and the CDT (Continental Divide Trail)).  We ate and laughed and told stories. Jester mentioned that he had taken his mother to France and Spain to hike the Santiago de Camino when she was 72 years old. We want to do that hike too so we grilled him on it. He gave us the name of his blog to check out too. We stayed until hiker midnight (9pm) and Mary said a prayer for us and then we returned to the Doyle still giddy about our wonderful evening. 


And now Mary’s story:
In 2001, Mary found herself homeless. She lived in a tent at the Riverfront Campground on the edge of Duncannon. She noticed that the AT thru-hikers would set up their tents near the front of the campground. Whenever she went to the grocery store she would buy bananas and give them to the hikers because they needed the potassium. She has been giving hikers food and assistance for 20 years. Several years ago she was inducted into ALDHC (Appalachian Long Distance Hikers Club) as a lifetime member.

David ordered pancakes and eggs and the serving was huge! Fortunately I let my stomach overrule my eyes and just had 2 pieces of French toast and a piece of bacon with 2 cups of hot tea. I’ll be paying for all that tea later with numerous potty stops.



The AT literally runs right through Duncannon via High Street. There are some pretty homes on that street. Finally made it to the bridge to cross the Susquehanna River. Then the hike put was up, up, up. There were lots of switchbacks though so that made it easier. The humidity was bad down near the river but as we got higher it wasn’t as bad. And once we reached the ridge, the walk wasn’t bad. Just all those damn rocks!
We hiked this section in 2019 so we looked for familiar sights. We found the spot that we had camped at with Ladypoles. It had a beautiful view of the river so we took our break there and relaxed for a bit. 


The rest of the day was just hiking, hiking , hiking. We wanted to get to a tent site that was just before you started down Peter’s Mountain but it was just too far. We stopped and stealth camped that night after 15.1 miles. That was a good day.","Duncannon, PA - The Doyle Hotel

Happy Feet and CoffeeBean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638444,"We slept in a little this morning because we were just so darned tired. They say that Pennsylvania is where boots go to die. I have 1000 miles on my boots now and they are just starting to show wear on top. The tread on the bottom still looks good. But besides your boots, PA really does a number on your feet. Last night my feet were aching so bad I was just about limping as we set up camp.


Even sleeping in a little we were still on the trail by 7:45am. Rain is due by 1pm so we are hoping to be near a shelter or camped by then. 


As we hiked we kept leap-frogging a hiker named Cairnkicker. She is a 9th & 10th grade Earth Science and Biology teacher in PA. She has hiked all over and was so fun to talk to. 


We stopped for lunch and sat on a log. There was a military training area nearby and we spent our lunch listening to the sounds of artillery fire. Automatic weapons and some bigger, deeper sounding ones too. Ah, the lovely sounds of nature! When we were hiking out of Carlisle a few days back, some yahoo was shooting off rounds right near the trail. All I could think was “I hope AT hiker isn’t on the menu.”

One thing we passed that was sad was a large stream coming down from the mountain. The water and all the rocks and ground around it were orange. Cairnkicker was with us and said it was AMD - Acid Mining Drainage. She said the color was basically rust (iron) mixed with arsenic and other poisonous items. It was horrible and sad.


Today was hard. We were just not feeling it and had to really push ourselves. We did get a little sprinkle of rain but nothing much. But the humidity was bad. At times I felt like a hamster on a wheel. We hiked and hiked and it just felt like we were going nowhere. We did get a boost from a trail angel named Billy. He had drinks and snacks and we chatted with him for a bit. That lifted our spirits and helped us end up at Rausch Gap Shelter - 14.2 miles! So yay for us.

Happy Feet and CoffeeBean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638448,"We woke up in Rausch Gap Shelter. It really was a beautiful shelter with grassy sites for tenters. There were hills on either side with trees and grasses - it almost looked landscaped. The walk in was smooth and level with gravel. The only downfall was the helicopters that flew back and forth in the distance all night (from the military training facility near by).  At least that is what David said. I was dead to the world as soon as my head hit the sleeping bag. David said that he ended up taking a sleeping pill when it became 9:30pm and he couldn’t sleep for the noise. 


We were able to check the weather (phone service was very spotty) and it showed rain coming at noon and possibly all day Friday. We ate breakfast and packed up quickly and got on the trail. It was about 6 miles into the town of Lickdale/Jonestown and a Days Inn. We were tired of hiking in the rain! There have been more days of rain than days of sunshine here. What is the deal with the weather, PA??


One of the really interesting parts of today’s hike was the beaver dam we had to cross. Back in 2018 a group of beavers built these huge dams in a part of the Swatara Creek in the Swatara State Park. The ATC offers a 1.6 mile dry alternate route but Guthook comments said that it wasn’t that hard to cross. As we got to the dam, 2 hikers were coming across southbound and said that it wasn’t bad, just take your time. So that’s what we did! At one point I put my pole in the water and started to lean on it when it suddenly sank another 6 inches. Fortunately I didn’t sink with it. There were tricky spots walking on wet logs. If your foot slipped off, you’d end up in the water and mud. We made it across though with dry boots. 


So we got to route 72 and crossed under the bridge of Swatara Creek, though it looked more like a river to me. Then we had to take the rail-to-trail path 2.3 miles into town. Miles that, unfortunately, don’t count in our daily AT mileage. :(


We got to the Days Inn just as it began to sprinkle. My aching feet were so happy Another couple hikers that camped with us the night before were there too.

We laid around enjoying the comfort for a while then I dressed and went down to the lobby to get a couple “breakfast to go” and some hot chocolates. 


We left the hotel about 10-ish and tried to hitch a ride to the trail. I didn’t want to hike 2.5 miles out. We were standing there with our thumbs out and a car turned and drove past us as one of the occupants put his hat out the window to wave. Whipperpoorwill! The car dropped him, Defcon, and Spirit off at the KOA across the street from where we were standing. We ran over and talked with them, so happy to have caught up with them again. They had decided to take a zero in Carlisle the day we left and we hadn’t seen them since. They said they looked for us in Duncannon but we had already passed through. It was great to see them and we spent a few minutes catching up. They came in for a resupply to get them to Port Clinton and Subway for lunch then they were getting back on trail. We exchanged numbers and talked about meeting at the next shelter (William Penn Shelter). 


We told them we were trying to hitch out of town and they told us we were trying to go out on the wrong road. Right in front of us was the sign “<- South 72 North ->” and we totally missed it. Once we got on the right road it took us about 30 minutes to finally get a ride. A gentleman let us ride in the back of his truck and he took us down to the trailhead which passes under I-81. Unfortunately, we needed to go to the trailhead by Swatara Creek and the Iron Bridge. So we hiked the .3 back to the bridge and then came back to the I-81 underpass and got back on trail.



The hike up was steep and very humid. We were both drenched by the time we found a camp site to stop for lunch. Another gourmet meal of flour tortillas and chicken. :)
We continued hiking and came across a rock field that just went on and on. It took quite a bit of time to cross that but finally on the other side we had a long stretch of level grassy trail. One of the neat things we found on the trail several times were these bright orange newts. (Whipperpoorwill told us later they were red spotted newts.)


We arrived at the William Penn Shelter. It has an upper level with ladders. We rested for about 10 minutes and then thought to hike on for a few more miles. The water source for the shelter was on the other side of the trail. When we walked over there we saw a beautiful, level grassy site. We decided that even though it was only 4pm we couldn’t pass up a site with a water source. If we hiked on we could get in a couple more miles but we wouldn’t have water so we decided to stay. 


Whipperpoorwill, Defcon, and Spirit came in about an hour or so later. Mancard joined us after that. For dinner we had mashed potatoes and then David made up a homemade tortilla soup that a section hiker, who was getting off trail, gave us. It was fantastic!! 


Spirit showed us pictures of the rocks where they had planned to take a break that afternoon. Laying on the rocks were three huge rattlesnakes! Glad they weren’t there when we stopped!


A group of 13 young Mennonite ladies walked past our site snd saw all thru hikers. They stopped snd asked all kinds of questions about our hike. This was their first time backpacking. They were so cute!


About 8:30pm, a hiker named Jeff came in. Mancard said that Jeff had taken a zero snd still caught up to him! He couldn’t believe how fast and how much Jeff hikes in a day. Jeff had hiked for 13 hours this day! But he is not thru-hiking the AT or should I say JUST the AT. He is hiking the Eastern Continental Trail which runs from Key West, FL to Belle Isle in Newfoundland, Canada. A distance of over 5,400 miles. He left Dec 6th and has been hiking for 6 months!

We were on the trail by 7:15am so that was good. We want to get into Port Clinton/Hamburg tomorrow so we want to get as many miles in today so we have less the next day.



The trail was pretty level and nice starting out and we made good time. Of course, then it got rocky again. Rocks in the trail, rock scrambles, rocks everywhere.
We came to a section of the trail and there were a number of tents set up and we could hear voices and yelling in the distance. Spirit was there and said she heard there was a zip line down at the reservoir. We all went down to check it out. There was, indeed, a zip line and folks were swinging down it and dropping into the water or going straight across to the other side. We talked to the guy manning the zip line (Kevin or trail name “Mr. Wood” (he has a tree service)). He said they come down here whenever they can and they set up and take down the zip line each time. They had tents and grills and looked like they were there for the weekend. Mr. Wood said that way back this had been a hydro-electric plant and then they just stopped using it and left it and it became a really nice swimming hole.


Back to the zip line: Spirit said “I’m doing it!” She emptied her pockets and put on her sandals and zipped down and dropped into the water. She said the water was freezing, but she did it again. Then David said he would do it but just wanted to zip to the other side. I filmed it. I was anxious about doing it but knew I would regret it if I didn’t. So I did!! David filmed it. I spun around while going down. Don’t know how I did that! That was so much fun!!


We finally left and got back on trail (It was hard to leave!). Back to the rocks!


We passed a monument that told of a fort back in 1755 that had been there as a lookout to warn of the approach of enemies during the French and Indian war.  What a cool thing to find kind of in the middle of nowhere. 


We were going down one trail that was grasses on either side when David jumped back a foot when he heard the rattle! There on the right side of the trail, hidden by grass, was a giant black rattlesnake! It had to have been 5-6 inches around! We threw a few rocks toward it to get it to move on. It rattled at us again and we walked past VERY quickly. 


A little ways down we were looking for a water source and ... Trail Magic! Someone had left jugs and bottles of water! We filled up and just a ways after we found our stealth camp for the night. We’re trying something new and only have the canopy over half of the top of the tent. It was so hot with it completely covered. Well see how it works. (Pickles and Fire Daddy had said they always left their canopy off because it was cooler and they could see the trees or stars, depending on where they were.)

Whipperpoorwill, Defcon, and Spirit came into camp about 8pm. They had leftover pizza they had gotten at the 501 Shelter and offered us some but we had just finished eating dinner. We talked for a bit and then everyone went to bed. 


It was a really hot day with temps in the 90’s. Every now and then we could feel a slight breeze. It was not a fun day. Constantly hiking over rocks in the trail is so exhausting, mentally and physically. Even though we were doing a lot of walking on the ridge, it was just hard because of the rocks. 


We finally started the descent into Port Clinton and it was downright dangerous. The trail was straight down, no switchbacks, and loose dirt. Near the bottom, I slipped on the dirt and slid down on my side and elbow. I had to unbuckle my pack to move. I scraped up my right arm pretty good. We are sooo done with PA and yet we still have 76 miles. 


We walked into Port Clinton and started down the street to the pavilion. It’s a quaint little town built around the railroad. We had to cross the railroad tracks to get to the sidewalk to town. There were huge pieces of coal displayed on the grass. We passed a house with a sign that said that hikers were welcome to get water at their spigot. Thank goodness! We were dry!



The pavilion is dedicated to Robert Breon, who was very active in the town, his church, and with AT hikers. There is a huge covered building with tables and chairs and across from that a large grassy area for tenting and hammocking and another covered eating area with a fireplace. There was a porta-potty too.
One hiker was already there, “Q”. We thought the place would be crowded because so many of the hikers that passed us mentioned stopping in Port Clinton, but it was empty except for Q.


A woman drove up in a white truck. Her trail name was Chaser. She was following her husband, Silver Goat, who was hiking the trail. They both started in Springer, but after 3 days she realized that she could not keep up with his daily mileage of 15+ miles, but she didn’t want to go home either. So she came up with the idea that he would hike north and she would drive up ahead and then hike south to meet him and they would camp together. Then the next day they would hike north together to the truck and then she would repeat the process. This way she was getting to hike with him but not the 15+ miles a day that he was putting in. That has worked out well for them plus she brings trail magic to whoever she meets up with. We got cookies and fruit!


We sat and talked with Q and Chaser for quite a while. Q is going SOBO so he gave us all kinds of advice and suggestions for upcoming towns and mountains going north. He even gave us the name of a trail angel in Palmerton named Squeak. She’ll let you tent in her backyard and use her shower and do laundry for free. There is also a drive-in at another town that will let you camp by the screen and watch the movie for free. 


I went down to the river and washed up. Nice to have non-stinky feet and pits! Put on clean clothes too. I felt like a new woman! David cleaned up with Wet Wipes.  He smelled like a new man!


David had checked the hiker box in the pavilion and scored a can of Spaghetti-Os and sliced pears! Woo hoo! Living high tonight!!


Another hiker came in a little later, Waymaker, and set up a tent. Chaser drove down and picked up The Lost Boys about 8pm from the trailhead. There were 4 of them and they hammocked.


At 10pm it was s till 86 degrees. The pavilion is right next to a small 2-lane road and parallel to a 4-lane highway that was never quiet. Also a train went through about 2 or 3 am. I was so exhausted I didn’t really acknowledge any of the noise. Just slept like the dead. Poor David didn’t sleep well. 


We hiked through 13.3 miles of hell today.","Black Swatara Creek campsite

Happy Feet and CoffeeBean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639051,"We decided to do a zero today even though Port Clinton was not really my idea of a town worth zeroing in. For one, we weren’t in a hotel laying on the bed arguing over the remote. 


We got up at our normal time and wandered over to meet Chaser’s husband, Silver Goat. Several of the Lost Boys were up too, C4 and Fundip. We chatted about trail experiences and mileage. Then Q came over to say goodbye. We wished him well. 


It called for the possibility of rain that afternoon and we wanted to waterproof the canopy, so we dragged everything under the covered pavilion so it wouldn’t get wet if it rained while we were gone. 


After Chaser put Silver Goat back on the trail, she drove Waymaker and us into Hamburg. We asked to be dropped at the Starbucks and Waymaker went on to the Walmart. We thanked Chaser profusely and said we hoped to see her again. 


David ordered his Starbucks coffee and I ordered my fru-fru drink (as David likes to call it) of a mocha frappachino with light ice and peppermint syrup. I also plugged our phones and power bank into charge. We thoroughly enjoyed our drinks!


We then walked over to Walmart for resupply, the bane of hiking. We had emptied our packs and brought them with us so we didn’t have to carry a bunch of plastic bags. As is often the case, it seemed like we bought more than we needed. We sat on a bench out front and took everything out of its boxes or plastic wrap to reduce the weight as much as possible. We hit the Dollar Store after that because we needed travel toothbrushes and Walmart didn’t have any. 


We were hungry for lunch so we went to McDonald’s. The dining area was closed for a graduation party. We walked over to Burger King. Their dining area was just closed period. We are walking all this time and the temperature was in the 90’s and the sweat was dripping off us. The heat was suffocating and walking around on pavement was miserable. The humidity must have been 99%. You could feel the heat coming off the pavement. 


I called Wendy’s to verify they had indoor dining (We really just wanted a place to get out of the heat.) We walked over there and ate. They gave us a free frosty for being thru-hikers. 


We got a text from Whipperpoorwill and gang that they were at Cabela’s so we went over there. Cabela’s offered a 5pm shuttle back to the pavilion that we all wanted to catch. The gang headed out to the trail and we pulled the tent out of the covered pavilion to waterproof the canopy with the spray we got at Walmart. David walked down to house #75 to get water while I organized the food we had just purchased. Organizing meant:
Put an Instant Breakfast in a snack bag, measure out powdered milk and add to bag and shake well to mixSeparate can of cashews into 2 oz bagsMeasure out cereal into quart bags, measure out powdered milk and add to bag and mix wellProtein bars and candy bars into snack bagPropel drink packets into their bag in snack bagDinner meals and lunch meals into appropriate waterproof bags



The canopy dried pretty quickly in the sun and we moved it under the trees for the night because of the dew in the mornings.
We were eating dinner at the picnic table (We splurged on beef stew from Walmart.) and Skittles came over and offered us a blackberry cobbler that he had picked up at the store. We took a piece to share and then he took the rest over to the hikers in the covered pavilion. Skittles was taking a zero tomorrow. He said when he hit town he always bought a cheesecake at Walmart and ate the whole thing and then went for a steak dinner. He couldn’t wait for the next day and his steak dinner. 


We went to bed after dinner for our early hike out the next morning. 


Zero day.","Port Clinton Pavilion

Happy Feet and CoffeeBean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639052,"We got up and were on the trail by 6:45am! The night before I had slept like the dead but last night, not so much. I heard all the traffic on both the 2 and 4 lane highways. The trains went through at midnight and 2:00am. Then the garbage truck came through at 2:13am! So, needless to say, I didn’t sleep well but I was ready to go. We both wanted to get in some good miles today. 



The climb out was hellacious! There were a couple switchbacks but the up never seemed to end. It finally did though, thank goodness.
We stopped near a pretty bridge for a break and a truck pulled up and a gentleman jumped out and gave us bottles of green tea for trail magic. Whipperpoorwill and Defcon came along shortly after and received green tea too. The man’s name was Stargeezer and he told us he maintained parts of the AT and also a property owned by the Lehigh Valley Amateur Astronomical Society. He told us to stop by when we got to The Pulpit and look around at the telescope buildings. 


We hiked on and when we got near The Pulpit we walked over to see the telescopes. Stargeezer and his 2 young grandsons were there. David lay on the grass “to get his vitamin D”. I asked Stargeezer if I could take his picture. He said “Well let’s take one with a telescope!” So he opened up one of the observatory’s and we climbed up to the telescope. His grandson opened the roof and I took a couple pictures of the 3 of them. 
After that we went to see the great view called The Pulpit. You could see for miles in the valley below. It was really beautiful. 



The next amazing view was The Pinnacle. You came up to a huge pile of rocks probably 25-30 feet high. You hiked past that to the overview of rocks. We decided to have lunch there. We saw a huge vulture sitting on a rock. While eating we could hear the thunder in the distance and saw the clouds getting darker.
We ate quickly and moved on, hoping to get to the Eckville Shelter and grab a bunk there before the rain. Then the sun came out and the thunder moved out. A while later that repeated with thunder, dark clouds, then sun and blue skies. 


About 3pm, the thunder and dark clouds came back and the skies opened up! We were drenched! We stood under some trees to try and get out of the worst of it but it didn’t help. We took this as PA giving us the finger one more time!


When it slacked off we started hiking again. We crossed over a road and kept looking for the shelter. We came to a pretty bridge crossing a stream and saw a couple tented there. We asked them if they knew where the shelter was and they said that they had passed by without seeing it too, but it was .5 miles back. Rather than go back, we decided to just camp there. There was only a 30% chance of rain at 10pm that night and that was all. We set up camp and hung out our wet stuff to hopefully dry a little overnight and went to bed. 


Sucky day but we did hike 15.5 miles, a new record.","Port Clinton Pavilion 
",Stealth campsite past Eckville Shelter ,"Jun 08, Tue",15.50
Happy Feet and CoffeeBean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639055,"It rained all night, of course, so everything was wet this morning. We had left some things out to dry because there was only a 30% chance of rain. Ha! Silver lining? It made digging a cat hole much easier. LOL!


We woke at 5:30am as usual but didn’t get on the trail until 8:15. It takes a while to pack up wet crap. 


After a bit we came to an outlook called Dan’s Pulpit. It was sunny and had big rocks so we dragged out everything wet and after 45 minutes we were dry again. For today. Tonight it’s supposed to rain starting at 4pm. Tomorrow and the next 3 days are supposed to be nice and sunny. I’ll believe it when I see it. 


When we first got to Dan’s Pulpit, there was a day hiker there and she pointed across the valley to show us The Pinnacle, that we had hiked to yesterday. It was waaay across the valley and we felt impressed that we had hiked from there to here. 


After packing up our dry tent and things we continued on. The rock climbs were horrible. Very few flat trails. Mostly large rock climbs. We got to one set and I got my foot lodged between 3 rocks and couldn’t get it loose. I had to drop my poles and get down on my hands and knees to get my boot out. Then the tears came. I hobbled over to David and leaned against him and cried and vented and cried some more. He held me until I finished and then I dried my tears and we attacked the rocks again. Stupid rocks!




The rocks slow you down sooo much. Between leaving late after packing up wet and then stopping to dry everything, our mileage sucked. Then we had to stop for water and the spring was down a steep climb. It was David’s turn for the water run and it took him 20 minutes to get water. He said it was coming out in a trickle so it took a long time to fill 2 platys (short for “platypus”, which is a water bag).
Then, of course, we had more rock scrambles. We stopped at the Allentown Hiker Club Shelter and claimed 2 bunks until we decided if we wanted to stay or hike on. We were both just tired and kind of down today. We ate a lunch of tuna and flour tortillas. Someone had hung a couple clotheslines so David hung his stuff to dry and the sun came out just after he did.
We ended up staying as the thunder continued to roll and the sky got darker. Ot poured rain again and the shelter filled up with hikers. It was fun to talk to them and swap stories. We will get up early tomorrow and try to do another 15 mile day and then hit Palmerton quick on Friday for a quick resupply. There is a trail angel in Palmerton named Squeak who will let you shower, do laundry, and camp in her backyard for free. Such awesome people these trail angels!


Only did 6.8 today.","Stealth campsite past Eckville Shelter 
",Allentown Hiker Club Shelter,"Jun 09, Wed",6.80
Happy Feet and CoffeeBean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639209,"Today was a great day! Probably the only great day that we have had in Rocksylvannia! We woke up to beautiful weather at the Allentown Hiking Club Shelter. Temperature in the 70’s and a nice breeze. After the torrential rain last evening it hadn’t rained anymore. Those that pitched their tents after the rain (like Swamp, Red, and Roadrunner) had dry tents this morning. 


I always feel self-conscious sleeping in a shelter because our sleeping pads are so noisy when we turn over and David is like a rotisserie chicken all night (his words, not mine). I turn from side to side too. It just seemed to echo throughout the shelter.


We got on trail by 7:05am and the initial trail wasn’t bad. Lots of places with soft pine needles (and that smelled so good!) 


We got to a big rock scramble called the Knife’s Edge. The rocks were straight down on one side and a little jagged on the other. We climbed the jagged side. (I don’t know how anyone could have climbed the straight side with a pack on.) And that was a blast!! We super enjoyed that and then .2 miles later were the Bear Rocks. Not as much fun as Knife’s Edge but still big boulders to climb. 


We crossed Bake Oven Road 1.4 miles later and were looking for the white blaze in the parking lot there when a woman called over to David. He wasn’t sure what she wanted when she waved him over, but then he saw the table full of food and knew we had hit trail magic! Peach and Jameson had a table covered with bread and meats and cheese, chips, cookies, fruits and coolers of drinks. And even better, real chairs to sit in! We made ourselves ham sandwiches with cheese and they had Duke’s mayo. (David snd Jameson got into a discussion on the finer points of Duke’s mayo.) We had soda and cookies for dessert. Peach did the AT in 2018 so we swapped stories on favorite places and experiences. It was so much fun. We hated to leave but those miles don’t hike themselves. 
We started up Bake Oven Knob and were appalled and furious at the graffiti sprayed painted on the rocks. It was everywhere! So disgraceful! 


We climbed over the rocks there and finally got to the Bake Oven Knob Shelter. It was an older shelter and only a half dot as far as water, but David made the .4 miles trek down and back to report no water. We were starting to get concerned about water. We got a text from Whipperpoorwill that there was a water cache at Ashfield Rd crossing. We hiked as quickly as we could but by the time we got there the 20 gallon jugs of water were empty. David walked down the dirt road for half a mile there and half a mile back. He came back with great water and we filtered it into all our bottles and kept the remaining.


I had texted Squeak, a trail angel in Palmerton, about coming to their place for a shower, laundry, and resupply. Then we were going to hike out the same day. She said to let her know when we hit the George Outerbridge Shelter and they would meet us at the trailhead.


We wanted to get as close to Palmerton as possible so we didn’t have as far to hike in the morning. We found a stealth site that was covered in pine needles with pretty ferns all around and had a small stone campfire ring. If you walked down a little path you could see the valley below. The sun was setting and it was a beautiful, serene spot.

Happy Feet and CoffeeBean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639210,"Woke to cloudy skies even though the forecast yesterday was for sunny skies and no rain for the next 10 days. Ha! We’re in Pennsylvania. What did we expect?


Squeak texted us to let her know when we passed the George Outerbridge Shelter. Can’t wait to get clean and have clean clothes! Everything we have is dirty, as far as clothes go. Last night we hung our socks far from the tent to air them out and wiped our feet as always, but the smell was still pretty horrible.


Started hiking about 10 minutes and David realized that he had left one of his shirts drying on the tree. He left his pack and ran back to get it.


We hiked on, anxious to get to the trailhead and our ride into Squeak’s. One thing about being the lead walker in the morning is you are also the “web walker”. This is the person that clears all those little invisible webs from across the trail by getting them across their face. I spent my time walking with my kerchief in my hand, wiping my face.


We got to the shelter and just before leaving, a hiker came in. Her name was Snapshot and she told us how she had started her thru-hike last year and had to get off for COVID-19 and was now finishing it. She was done at Delaware Water Gap! About 27 miles to go!! We were so happy for her and also envious!


And, of course, just as we were leaving the shelter it started to sprinkle so we had to stop and put on our pack covers! The heaviest rain of the day was supposed to be at 9am so we hoped to get picked up by Squeak before it hit. 


We hiked down to the Lehigh River and crossed the bridge. We texted Squeak and she said not to cross the bridge so we had to cross back. :)


Squeak’s husband, Dave, came and picked us up and took us back to their house. They had 2 pictures on the lawn of their sons who were graduating from high school. We met Squeak and took right to her! She was so friendly and welcoming. She plays the bagpipes! She played in high school and in country-wide competitions, then stopped playing because it was stressful and she wasn’t enjoying it. Now as an adult, she decided to pick it back and said she practiced at 5pm so maybe we would get to hear a concert. I love the bagpipes!! I couldn’t wait. Squeak is involved in so many things. She is a disaster relief volunteer for the Red Cross, she works with the Girl Scouts, she teaches hiking and overnight backpacking to all age groups, even a group for over 40 who would like to try hiking for the first time.


We took showers and put in several loads of laundry. Then walked behind their house. Their house was just one street over from Main Street and we could cut through the backyard to Main. Palmerton is a little town and has some cute shops in it. We resupplied at the Country Harvest grocery and they offered us a free apple or orange because we were thru-hikers. 


We went back to Squeak’s and set up our tent in the backyard. It had started sprinkling. We had Palmerton pizza for dinner (thin crust and not very good) then came back and went to bed. Before bed we had to sign Squeak’s log book and then the giant framed AT symbol on the back of the house.


Surprise, surprise it started to rain.

We had been warned of the hike up. Oh boy! It was straight up and very steep for .8 of a mile ip Blue Mountain. At one point you were so high you could look down and see the entire town and the river. 



Then the fun began! We should have collapsed our poles and stuck them in our packs. We will next time, for sure. The rock scramble had huge boulders that required both hands. Maverick and Calypso were climbing with us. Good thing. At one point we couldn’t figure out a way up, so David took off his pack and I was going to push it up to him. Except in the precarious position I was in, I couldn’t lift it. That’s when Maverick came along and pushed it up for me. The rest of the climb was strenuous, but fun! Calypso climbed like a goat. She said this was her jam.
We got to the ridge about a half mile later and had some level ground to walk. We found wild blueberries growing along the trail and stopped to pick a couple handfuls. Yum!



The rest of the hike was typical for PA. The main concern was water. From 1898-1980 there had been major zinc smelting in the area. They had completely stripped the mountains. Dave said that there hadn’t been a tree left when they were done. Because of this, you cannot drink the water from the mountain. So hikers rely heavily on people leaving water caches. Without them we had a 13 mile hike to the next shelter for good water.Just before Smith Gap Road, we hit a water cache and filled up. We heard laughing around the bend and walked into a parking area and a large trail magic set up by 3 running/hiking groups in the area! Hot dog, salad, chips, drinks, and watermelon were just some of the great food they offered. Edison, Calypso, and Maverick already there. It was wonderful and invigorating! We were trying to get to Delaware Water Gap by tomorrow and a ways to go. 



They sent us on our way with thick turkey sandwiches, chips, and fruit. We wouldn’t have to make dinner tonight! We finally found a nice stealth site. There was another hiker there but there was enough room for us too.

Our campsite companion, Waterfall, we learned, had thru-hiked the AT in 1999 and was just hiking from MD to ME this year. (If I was doing a LASH, I sure wouldn’t include PA in it!) He had also hiked the Santiago de Camino and we talked about that for a bit. He was very nice. He said he was in no rush and was only hiking 5-10 miles a day. (I thought “Wow! That’s going to take a while to get to Maine.”) He left before us and said he was going to eat breakfast at the overlook. We left about 15 minutes later and came upon Waterfall at the view. He said he could see down into town to the grocery store. We all laughed about what a view that was. (When we started hiking again, I suddenly remembered of who Waterfall reminded me. Toby from The Office! He even favored him in looks! Ha!)



The trail wasn’t overly bad. There were still alot of rocks (wouldn’t be PA without them, right?), but there were areas of pine needles and even a long fire road that we had to walk. That made the hiking a little easier. We were determined to get into Delaware Water Gap today so we had alot of miles to do.
Being a Sunday there were alot of day hikers on the trail. Not to sound like a snob, but they can be a pain! We’re hiking uphill with 30 pounds on our back and we’re tired and a lot of the day hikers just keep coming down the trail. They don’t know trail etiquette calls for hikers going uphill to have right of way. That is frustrating!


When we got closer to Delaware Water Gap, the descent became fun. We had to go through “tunnels” of rhododendron and  down stone steps and across several streams. David doesn’t like downhills so I could hear him behind me “expressing” his thoughts on hiking down. We finally hit the town and began walking to the Roadway Inn. 


On the way in, we saw Spirit. (She and Whipperpoorwill and Defcon had gotten into town the day before.) She told us about the Village Bakery where you could get a hotdog and slice of apple pie for $2.95. We sat wolfing down the delicious food and talking with Spirit and then Whipperpoorwill and Defcon walked by. We spent a few minutes getting caught up. They were leaving tomorrow. We were taking a zero. Our feet hurt and we need to find leukotape to tape them.

Happy Feet and CoffeeBean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639370,"The Roadway Inn is no Quality Inn, that’s for sure. The beds were hard and we did not sleep well. The hotel must have over 200 rooms, but there were less than a dozen cars in the parking lot. So, of course, we end up with someone in the room directly over us. Someone with a small child and a dog. A small child that likes to knock down block towers on the floor at night and a dog that barks and races across the non-carpeted floor. The one time we forget to request a top floor…
We slept in until 7:15 and then just laid in bed and rested our feet. I bought a tennis ball at the Walmart in Hamburg and have been using it to roll out the heel of my right foot. I’m wondering if I may have plantar fasciitis. I can hike about 2 hours before my heel begins to ache. I’m trying not to eat ibuprofen or Aleve like candy. 


We have desperately been trying to find leukotape every place we stop but no luck. I called the outfitter here and they don’t have it either but do carry a medical tape so we’ll go and check it out. We’ve also been told the Sunoco gas station across from the hotel has a decent resupply. 


After a while we walked down to the outfitters and decided to buy the roll of medical tape. It seemed heavy enough and might do the trick. We use it to cover any hot spots that happen on our feet before they become blisters. If we get a blister, we put antibiotic ointment and a bandaid on it and then cover it with the medical tape to make sure it doesn’t come off. Your feet sweat a lot in boots and bandaids will just peel off if you don’t secure them with tape. We went to pay for it and a couple other things and David realized that he left his money at the hotel. I said I would go back and get it (Since I hate standing around and would probably add more things to the pile to buy. Haha)



Then we headed to the Sunoco for resupply, but not before stopping at the Village Bakery and buying 3 chocolate macadamia nut cookies. The prices at the Sunoco were really outrageous. A package of oreo cookies, like you’d buy at Walmart, cost $5.49! We decided we’d resupply later.
We went back to the hotel and rested until 5:30 or so. Time for dinner. Coming into town we saw a BBQ place that we thought we would try for dinner. Ha! Closed on Mondays! It seems like every time we come into town, the restaurants are closed for the day. So I agreed to go down to the Village Bakery and get hotdogs and a fry to share and David would go and get resupply and we would meet at the hotel. Just when they handed me our dinner, the sky got really dark and the wind started blowing hard. I was afraid I would get caught in a downpour but I made it back before the rain.

We packed and headed back to the trail. That involved walking back through town and to the bridge that crosses the Delaware River. Halfway across the bridge, on the pedestrian walkway, is painted the border of PA and NJ. Yay!! We were in New Jersey now. Goodbye Pennsylvania. We will not miss you!!


We had heard rumors that the PA rocks extended in NJ for a number of miles. We’d heard 9, 11, and even 40 so we shall see. After crossing the bridge and then walking under a highway, we found the trail and headed into the woods. We immediately noticed the difference in the trail. Much of it was pine needles or roots and the rocks that we did come across were not pointed up to stab your feet. There was also space between to put your feet on dirt instead of a rock. We love New Jersey!!


We stopped for lunch at an overlook (another thing that NJ has more of). David has this delightful little habit of putting his chewing gum on the rock or log where he is sitting so he can use it again after eating. (There are little wads of gum from GA to here that he has forgotten and walked off and left.) I sat down on the rock right where his stupid gum was! He didn’t notice until I went to stand up after eating. He apologized profusely. I got out the new medical tape and he was able to get most of it off with that. Hmmm. 


Later we came to a beautiful little pond called Sunfish Pond. It was glacially formed and is considered “one of the seven natural wonders of NJ”. It has such a high acidic content that only the pumpkinseed sunfish and yellow perch can survive in it. We sat on a log and enjoyed the calm and the lovely day. A few minutes later, Just Scott came by and said he had just seen a bear about 2 miles back. He said he was thinking about how he needed to be better about hanging his food bag because of the high concentration of bears in NJ and there was a bear sitting on the right side of the trail! He said by the time he got his phone out to take a picture, the bear was gone. 


For some reason, near the end of the day, I get a spurt of energy and hike really fast. David calls me Seabiscuit, after the race horse, when I do that. Today, though, I was really dragging and he was Seabiscuit!


We ended up finding a stealth site that had a hiker already set up. We asked if we could join her and she was thrilled. She said she was worried that she would be by herself tonight so she was happy for the company. Her name was Farah and she was from Denver. This was her first time camping and backpacking. She started in Connecticut and was hiking to Mary’s Rock in SNP. She was so enjoyable to talk to. We asked her if she hung her food bag and she said that she would hang it on a tree branch.

We had stopped for a break about mid-morning and this hiker stopped at our spot and asked if I was OK. I told him I was fine and asked why. He said that he had heard yesterday that a woman had fallen on her chest and had suffered internal injuries. An elderly woman. I said “Wow. Thanks for that.” It went right over his head that he had called me an elderly woman. AN ELDERLY WOMAN!! WTH! I still can’t get past that. This guy had a white hair and a white beard. He had to be in his late 50’s, maybe early 60’s (same as me!). The difference is that I hike the trail every day with a full pack on and camp at night. He gets picked up by his wife, who drives him back to their RV for the night and then returns him to the spot he got off (This is called support hiking.). And I’m elderly!! I could have smacked him and I can sure out-hike the idiot! Rant complete. We will now return to our regularly scheduled blog. 


Water is not plentiful here and we even had to get some from a bog, but we filtered and boiled it before using it. 


We hit the town of Branchville, NJ and I had seen in Guthook that there was a hiker friendly tavern called Gyp’s Tavern. We had told Schvitz about it and he said he would see us there. The tavern was right on Lake Kittatinny. There were Adirondack chairs by the lake. We ordered burgers and fries and the burgers were huge and delicious! We sat and looked out over the lake and ate our lunch and chatted with Schvitz. He is an ER nurse from Chicago who will be moving to Oregon after the hike. We hated to leave but wanted to get a few more miles in. 


We ended up setting up camp at the Culver Fire Tower on the ridge. The sunset was beautiful but I knew it was going to be cool in the morning. 


The elderly lady and her husband hiked 15.5 miles today! So there, old man!!","Stealth campsite 
",High Point Shelter ,"Jun 16, Wed",15.50
Happy Feet and CoffeeBean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639554,"We woke up really cold because we were on a ridge. (Didn’t we say we wouldn’t camp on ridges?! What happened to that vow?) We decided to just pack up snd eat breakfast at the shelter which was only a mile away. 


We got to the Gren Anderson Shelter and got water and ate breakfast. We also met a Trail Runner named Stretch. She was one of only three Trail Runners in NJ. She told us that she works 40 hours a week and the runners have a schedule of which shelters they have to check. She only had to go to the next shelter that day which was 6 miles away so she would probably hike some side trails and pick up trash. She loved the hiking and camping and talking with hikers. We enjoyed our conversation with her and then headed out. 


We continued the climb up Sunrise Mountain and came to a gorgeous stone pavilion. It was built by the CCC back in the 30’s. It had several benches and could easily hold 100 people, it was that big. The view was beautiful and you could see for 180 degrees around you. 



The rest of the day was like being back in PA. The trail was rocky as crap! Started having PTSD and thinking I was back in PA. It constantly went up and down too. No ridge walking today. Ugh! What a day!
Other than the pavilion on Sunrise Mountain, there was one other delight. We came to a wooden observation tower that allowed us to see the highest point in NJ. There is a 220 foot obelisk there. It was built in 1930 as a war memorial. As we hiked towards it there was supposed to be a side trail that would go up to the monument, but we never saw it. It definitely wasn’t marked well. There was also supposed to be a trail down to a lake with a small swimming area and concession stand, but we didn’t see that trail either. Oh, well. 


Decided to stop at High Point Shelter for the night. It’s right next to a river and the sound is so relaxing and a great water source too 


Hiked 14.1 miles today.","Culver Fire Tower stealth site 
",High Point Shelter ,"Jun 17, Thu",14.10
Happy Feet and CoffeeBean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639555,"We spent the night tented at the High Point Shelter. The river runs right along side it and the sound (mixed with a few snores) was so soothing. (BTW, old people are not the only ones who snore. Those young kids can snore up a storm too!)


We slept in until 6am but were on the trail by 7:15am. We were actually the first ones out of camp.


We had just come down the hill and saw a sign posted on a tree “Trail Magic Ahead”. We found a cooler with chips, nabs, Fig Newtons, and Gatorade. There was also a note asking hikers to text them and let them know their trail names and stories and if the cooler needed restocked. I texted them and thanked them for the magic. They responded and wished us safe travels. Trail magic rocks!!


We had heard that the resupply in Unionville, NY was good. (Also you could camp on the village green.) There was a general store and a couple restaurants. We were low on food. We had hoped to get in there yesterday but didn’t make it. If we had known the trail was as smooth as it turned out to be we would have kept going till we hit town. 


We got into town about 11am. The hike in was smooth and no rocks. The resupply was very disappointing and expensive so we bought just enough to get us to Warwick, NY where there is a big grocery store. (Warwick has a drive-in theatre that lets hikers camp by the screen and watch the movie for free!) We went to Annabels Pizza and each got a slice of pizza. The slices were ginormous and only $3.95 each! We ended up finally leaving town about 12:45pm. We had only put in 5 miles so far so we definitely needed to do more. 


Once we left town we encountered a lot of boardwalks and, boy, did that make the hiking easy. We figured we would get in a good bunch of miles. However, as the day wore on, we hit a lot of hills/mountains. We spent the late afternoon and till 6pm doing uphills. (You would think you would have to go down at some point, but it just seemed to be uphills and rock scrambles the whole time.)


We did have a group pass us in the early afternoon. It was a mom and 3 boys. They were thru-hiking. Their group trail name is “Field Trip”. A few minutes later we heard someone behind us ask to pass and it was another boy, running to catch up to the group. The boys probably range in age from 7 or 8 to maybe 12 or 13. They each carried a full backpack of gear. 


We came to a beautiful, flat pine forest but had wanted to get in at least 15 miles so we kept going. We should have known better. When we do that, that’s when we cant find a stealth site. After climbing another uphill we saw a flat area right next to the trail. (You aren’t supposed to tent right by the trail, but we were desperate and we weren’t blocking the trail.) We couldn’t go another step! The tent just barely fit and we had to dig out some rocks to smooth the ground. 


Good news. We hiked 15.6 miles.","High Point Shelter 
",Stealth camp past Pochuck Shelter ,"Jun 18, Fri",15.60
Happy Feet and CoffeeBean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639689,"We slept in a little today since we hiked later yesterday. I didn’t even set the alarm and we still woke up at 5:45am. After a hot breakfast of Mountain House granola and blueberries (that a hiker couple gave us because they insisted they had too much food) and Poptarts we started out about 8am. 


We had barely been walking 10 minutes, and the trail was pretty level, when David turned back to tell me something and hit his foot on a rock right in the middle of the trail. He went down hard! And had a nasty gash under his knee. I cleaned it with alcohol swabs and put a bandaid on it. He pulled his knee brace back on. After a couple minutes it began to throb, so he took some ibuprofen. 



The hiking after that was a lot of boardwalks. We walked through the Pochuck Boardwalk, a kind of wildlife sanctuary, on nice groomed paths and boardwalks and over pretty bridges. As we came out of the sanctuary, there was a garden center and ice cream place called Heaven Hill Garden Center. We stopped and got some apple cider donuts, an orange, and a drink. The “Field Trip” gang was there. We chatted with the mom about watching one of her boys running down the trail to catch up with them. She said “ Yeah. You’d think in 2200 miles I’d be able to lose a couple but they always find me.” We had a good laugh at that.
After relaxing a bit it was time to hit the trail and climb “The Stairway to Heaven”. Holy moly! We put our poles on the sides of our packs so our hands were free. There were a lot of stone steps, which makes you think it made it easier to climb but it didn’t. It was just so steep and busy! It was a weekend and the day hikers were out in droves! And the climb went up to the top of the mountain! There really weren’t any switchbacks. It just went up and up. We stopped once to rest. We were both drenched in perspiration and guzzling water. I think all the boardwalks earlier were just to lull you into thinking “Hey, this is going to be an easy day.”


After we finally hit the top and started our descent, we ran into Stretch, the Trail Runner, again. I told her that I had wanted to see the Pinwheels Vista but didn’t know where the trail was and wish they would mark them with signs. She was so disappointed that I didn’t get to see it and made a note that signs should be put up.  The rest of the day we really struggled to hike. We both felt so sluggish. We finally made it to the Wawayanda Shelter. I had read on Guthook that there was a “sock box”. I found the box behind the shelter and you had to know the combination to open it, which the trail angel had posted in Guthook. I had been wanting to get a lightweight pair of socks to wear at night. (The ones I have now are heavy and make me sweat in my sleeping bag.) I found the perfect pair. The Trail Angel had also put in information on places to eat, churches, and her contact info if you needed to get into town. I immediately texted her and asked if she was available to bring us to the drive-in to camp. She responded right away and asked us to meet her at the Ranger Station just .1 off the trail. 


We hurried down the trail and saw the sign to the Ranger Station. Susan “Someday” pulled up a few minutes later. She drove us into town and showed us where the Shop Rite grocery store was and then took us to the Warwick Drive-in. It was about 4pm on a Saturday and I asked about the Catholic Mass schedule she had posted in the sock box. She said if we wanted to go to the 5pm Mass to text her and she was only a few minutes away. So we set up camp on the hill by the other half a dozen tents, cleaned up and put on camp clothes. I texted Someday and she picked us up and drove us to the Queen of Peace Catholic Church in New Milford, NJ (right next to Warwick). We arranged to text her when Mass was over but at 6pm she texted that she was right outside because it was raining. By the time we got back to the drive-in, the rain had stopped. 


A group of hikers we knew were there: Whipperpoorwill, Defcon, Maverick, Problem, Edison, Just Scott, and a couple new friends: Hagrid and ISpy. I went down to the concession stand and they filled my water bottles and then I bought a Coke and popcorn for the movie. Anyone who knows me knows I can’t watch a movie without popcorn! This drive-in is really accommodating to hikers. There is a slight hill on the right side as you drive in and hikers can camp all along it. You then go down to the security building and they will give you a radio for free to listen to the movie. There are 3 screens so you can pick whichever movie you want to see and they are all new movies too! At the concession stand you cam fill up your water bottles. They also have a log book that they ask all the hikers to sign. Last year they had about 500 hikers the whole year. Already this year they have had 240 and it’s only mid June and the bubble hasn’t even come through yet. 


Someday had called her daughter, who is a physical therapist, and asked her about David’s knee. Someday texted us to tell us that her daughter said for David to take ibuprofen and get a bag of ice from the concession stand to help with the swelling. She also said to let her know when we were ready to leave in the morning and she would bring us back to the trail. Talk about going above and beyond!!


We only watched about half of the movie “Hitman’s Wife’s Bodyguard”. We were tired and David’s knee hurt. I have been rolling my right heel with the tennis ball in the morning and night but that is only giving me about 2 hours of relief on the trail once we start hiking. That is getting concerning too. 


We went to bed. It was way past hiker midnight for us. 


Hiked only 8.5 miles today.","Stealth site past Pochuck Shelter
",Warwick Drive-in,"Jun 19, Sat",8.50
Happy Feet and CoffeeBean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639692,"Because of the rain last evening we didn’t get to resupply before the movie, so we had to go this morning. We are so sick of tuna/chicken packets and flour tortillas at lunch! We wandered the aisles trying to find something else for lunch. We’re going to try cheese and crackers and hotdogs.


We went back to the drive-in and packed up and texted Someday. We got back on trail about 10:45am.


It was rough going. There were big boulders to climb and jump over. I really liked that but David was having a terrible time because of his knee. He couldn’t bend it more than 45 degrees so it was hard to climb. We came to one section with metal rungs to climb. That was hard for him too. 


We did cross the NY/NJ border! It was painted on a flat rock that we walked across. Someone had also erected an American flag on a pole made from a tree at the top of one of the views. It was a beautiful sight. 


We hiked until about 4pm and David just couldn’t go on anymore. Dark clouds were rolling in and we could hear thunder. We finally found a flat spot by Cascades Brook to set up camp. Stealth spots so far have been extremely rare in NY. 


We set up camp. It was dark and really humid. The mosquitoes were really bad too. At 5pm the rain came.


We hiked 5-1/4 hours but had only gone 6.6 miles. NY is going to be tougher than we thought.","Warwick Drive-in
",Stealth site by Cascades Brook,"Jun 20, Sun",6.60
Happy Feet and CoffeeBean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639908,"I woke at 5:14am. It was a little bit cooler but extremely humid. The tent was dry for the most part after yesterday’s rain. We had set up the tent at 4pm and hung the food bags at 5pm and then I went to sleep. I slept solid until 5:14am! Twelve hours! David, on the other hand, did not. His knee hurt and was still swollen and he was worried about further injury hiking 10-12 hours a day with 35 pounds on his back. 


We had cold cereal with powdered milk (just add water!) for breakfast. Today is Naked Hiking Day and, boy, would the mosquitoes love that! I’d be nothing but a giant welt if I hiked naked today! I guess that will be another year. :)


It took several hours to hike the 3 miles to the Route 17A trailhead. We walked up the road to a parking area and got there just as a trail angel was dropping off a hiker. She asked if we needed a ride into town. Her name was Laurie. She drove us to Warwick and to the only hotel they have but it was closed. We had her drop us at the library. 


We sat outside the library and had a heart-to-heart talk. We have just started retirement and are having serious feet and knee problems on this hike. Do we push on and possibly cause more damage or do we stop? The next day is 80% chance of rain. That means wet trails and rocks. We have so many other plans of things we want to do and I don’t want an injury now to ruin them. Maybe we are just 500-600 mile at-a-time hikers? We still love hiking and want to one day finish our AT thru-hike. As our daughter, Mackenzie, said “Right now, family is your Mt Katahdin.” Just like Mt Katahdin is the goal of thru-hikers, right now being with family is our goal. We really want to hike the White Mountains in New Hampshire and the 100 Mile Wilderness in Maine. We will section hike until we finish the AT. We called Megan and Mackenzie and told them our plans. They support us and will come on Tuesday to pick us up. 


We stayed at the library for several hours and then took the little town shuttle over to the Shop Rite, walked up to the drive-in and set up our tent. There were 21 tents here tonight!


We had a calzone for dinner at Luca’s and a cider at Penning’s before heading back for the movie. Rain is due again tonight (of course!) so I don’t know how much of the movie we will get to see. We want to watch “Quiet Place 2”. 



This has not been an easy decision and we thank everyone who has followed and supported us on this journey. Your messages and texts kept us going and we love you all. To my SDMS family, your retirement gift of the carabiner with the compass always made me a smile and pointed me true north. You are the best. To our girls, thank you for being there, for supporting us and loving us through all our crazy adventures. We couldn’t have done this without you.

Today Kenz will pick us up at 10AM and we will head to Bland, VA and the Brushy Mountain Outpost (mile marker 591.8). The weather looks good for the next few days (Yay!). I will add more tonight. Wish us luck and stay tuned. :)
Well, the first few days on the trail are killer and today was no different. We got to Bland about 12:45 and ate a quick sandwich for lunch. We started towards the trail about 1:05. We had to road walk about 15-20 minutes before hitting dirt. Of course, the way out was straight up Brushy Mountain. 
Within a few hours my heel was killing me and I felt exhausted. It was frustrating to feel so tired.
We were short getting to the shelter. I was just too tired and in too much pain to make it the 11 miles. We hiked 8.9 and found a stealth site and set up camp. Water is very scarce! Luckily someone left some jugs of water by the trail at a parking area we crossed. There was a little left in one jug. We will have to hike 4 miles tomorrow to find water.

Happy Feet and CoffeeBean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644196,"So as I hike the next day I remember lots of things I forgot to mention in my blog the night before. So here are a few. 
We came upon a large pile of animal scat. Not sure what the animal was that left it but it had definitely been partying in a farmer’s cornfield. Almost all the scat was corn hulls. 
Just before setting up camp yesterday we met a couple of flip-floppers. They were southbound. We forgot to ask their names. 


Today we woke 6-ish and were on the trail by 7:37. Breakfast was a power bar split between us. We were hoping to have a good breakfast once we found water. We were told that the shelter had no water but there was a small stream about half a mile after. We also met a couple of southbound (SOBO) thru-hikers. They had started at Mt. Katahdin on June 4th and were heading to GA. 


span class=""Apple-converted-space""> The webs are so obnoxious! Every other step I’m wiping webs off my face. I wondered if they had stayed at the shelter.  The answer was ‘yes’ because one step past the shelter sign and I had web face!


Finally found water! It was a stream with a few shallow pools. We has to use a cup to scoop the water but we didn’t care. Coffeebean had cereal and powdered milk. I had chocolate Instant Breakfast with powdered milk. I also had a Nature Valley Coconut Biscuit. That was really good! After cameling up and filling our bottles we started off again. 


We met SOBO “Delicate Flower” and his beautiful black German Shepherd. I wish I had asked how he got that name! He mentioned a stream coming up to get water. Don’t know what his idea of a stream is because it was a river to us! Started filtering water and the water cut down to a trickle coming out if the filter!! We are 1-1/2 days out of Parrisbug where we can buy a new filter. I do have some water purifying tablets as a backup. The water doesn’t taste the greatest but it will have to do. 


We had alot of walking, in the afternoon, through trees/shrubs of rhododendrons. It went on for miles. It’s very pretty and you definitely feel like you are walking in a green tunnel, but campsites are few and far between. The rhoddies have such big roots that it’s hard to find a flat place that isn’t lumpy. We were lucky to find one today though! We got camp set up just before the rain started. We have no service here so I will have to post this tomorrow. Also we can’t check the weather. Last time Coffeebean checked it, it was 60% chance of rain on Thursday. :(


We hiked 13.2 miles today. Working up to at least 15 a day.","Stealth campsite north of VA 611 parking area

Happy Feet and CoffeeBean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644197,"Coffeebean did not sleep well so we slept in and did not get on trail until 9am. We finally had hot chocolate to drink for breakfast instead of just power bars. 


We stopped in a stealth site and set up camp just before the rain started so it was another night of protein bars for dinner. 


Had a killer uphill that had us both panting and taking lots of 5 minute breaks on the way up. Finding water is still really hard and once we do it takes forever to filter because our filter is down to a trickle. 


After getting up the hill, the ridge hiking was terrible. I don’t think trail maintenance has been done here in many months. The undergrowth covers the trail alot and we felt like we were bushwacking alot of the time. There were also alot of rocks. At least they were flat, large but flat, so it made it easier to walk on. We were now out of water and getting desperate. Guthook said that the next shelter had water. We stopped for a snack and heard thunder. We got rain gear on and the rain started. Luckily it wasn’t a hard rain and only lasted a short time. 


We finally got to Doc Knob Shelter about 7:15pm. It was a nice with a big porch and picnic table. There was a small white pipe under the porch with water trickling out. It was small but steady. We had no water and could have drunk a gallon each. I was able to fill 2 platys in about 20 minutes. 


We had our first hot meal on trail. Mashed potatoes and freeze dried lasagna. Steak and lobster couldn’t have tasted better! I put the last of the Aquaphor pills in one of the platys. Later when Coffeebean asked me which platy, I wasn’t sure. (head slap!)


It got to be about 8pm and no one else showed up so I pitched the tent inside the shelter. I saw too many giant daddy long legs spiders to know that I wouldn’t sleep unless I was in the tent. Coffeebean hung his stuff over the porch railings to try and dry it overnight. He is always totally soaked at the end of the day.

We had a cold breakfast. While I packed ip he filtered water. It took over an hour to filter 2-1/2 liters of water. (This normally takes 5 mins.) That would have to hold is until we got down the mountain and hit Pearisburg. 


Everything that had been hung out was soaked. The dew was really heavy and it was also very foggy. 


We got on trail about 10 minutes to 9. More ridge walking but not as overgrown. We found a sign of spring water .02 miles down a side trail. We both started down the trail but then we dropped our packs and CoffeeBean went the rest of the way with 2 platys. He came back and said there was a nice campsite by the stream. The water was clear and coming out of the ground. We decided it was probably clean and we were so thirsty, so we drank it unfiltered and ate a snack. If we start growing horns or something, you know why. 


Finally got down the mountain. There were  switchbacks but also alot of loose gravel. 


We walked into Pearisburg and got a room at the Holiday Lodge. The TV wouldn’t work so I picked up the phone to call the front desk, but there was no phone cord! So I had to walk down to the front desk to ask for help. We also had to move lamps around in the room so there was light. The ceiling light didn’t work. What a gem of a hotel. 


We went over to eat dinner at El Barranca. It was good and very filling. We also got a text from a fellow hiker that we had met on the trail up north. Her name is Spirit. She came over and we talked for over an hour! It was so great to see her!

I’m thinking of trying trail runners. You can get them in high top (to protect your ankles) and they definitely dry faster.
