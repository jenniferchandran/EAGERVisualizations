Arm & Hammer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624999,"Hi All.  Ive been talking about hiking the AT for years and I'm sure many are tired of hearing about it.  So it's time to put the plan into action.  I'm planning on retiring the end of February and beginning my hike mid April.
We have to have 3 entries before they will post, so this is number 1.",,View Entry,"Nov 22, Fri",0
Arm & Hammer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625000,"For those not familiar, thru hikers go by trail names.  These are either given to you on the trail by other hikers or you pick one yourself.  I’ve decided to pick one honoring my parents.  Dad’s initials were A.R.M.  He would stencil it on everything so my brother in law Joe referred to him as ARM.  Mom was in charge though so they referred to them as Arm and Hammer.
I’m going to start with that as my trail name unless the trail gives me another one, as I’m told it sometimes does.",,View Entry,"Nov 22, Fri",0
Arm & Hammer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625001,"I’ve decided to do what is called a “flip flop” hike.  Which means I’ll be starting in the middle and heading to Maine. Then return to where I started and head to Georgia.  Choosing  this for two reasons.  Our 6th grandchild is due in February,  and also, I’ve never been crazy about hiking in winter conditions.  A flip flop gives you the opportunity to hike north with spring and south with the fall.",,View Entry,"Nov 22, Fri",0
Arm & Hammer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625537,"Karen and I are lucky to have great friends, and two of them, Lenny and Jay, have offered to mow the lawn while I’m away.  It’s a huge load off my mind to know that’s taken care of.  Thanks much guys!!!",,View Entry,"Jan 01, Wed",0
Arm & Hammer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627044,"With all that’s going on right now, I thought it would be wise to postpone my start date a couple of weeks.  Hopefully things will begin to calm down by the end of April.  So my new start date will be April 30th.",,View Entry,"Mar 17, Tue",0
Arm & Hammer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627063,"Well after the warning from the Appalachian Trail Conservancy President and also the fact that the Bed and Breakfast we were going to stay at in Harpers Ferry has canceled our reservation, I’m left with no choice but to call off my thru hike this year.  So if there’s no other global emergencies I’ll be in the class of 2021.",,View Entry,"Mar 17, Tue",0
Arm & Hammer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627347,"Now that I’ve come to grips with not thru hiking this year, I’ve realized I’m glad I’m not out there.  Imagine being on the trail and wondering what was happening at home with your family.  That would be much worse and I’d be heading home anyway.",,View Entry,"Mar 26, Thu",0
Arm & Hammer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634018,Well a thru hike is out of the question this year.  But myself and friend Ray are going to hike the Smoky’s southbound starting on April 27th.  We’ve got our permits and shuttles in place.  Very excited to get out there.,,View Entry,"Apr 27, Tue",0
