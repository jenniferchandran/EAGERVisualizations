Juice,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635501,"Heading to the trailhead was one of the most stressful days I've had in quite awhile. Upon heading towards Gainesville on a claustrophobic near 24 hour train ride, I was anxious to say the least. I had barely slept the night before leaving for the Portland, ME Amtrak station and still had not had a full meal upon arriving into Georgia. I had ate a pack of peanut M&Ms, a 10pc McNuggets, and a cranberry juice. The nerves were at an all time high, my mind was racing. I booked a shuttle last minute only to realize in the middle of the night, my train was stuck in North Carolina and subsequentially would be 2 hours late, causing last minute panic and finding another shuttle. I had already booked with one company and prepaid and they were more than nice about the late train and scheduled me with another driver. 
Finally, on the morning of the 14th, I arrived around 8AM and was picked up by a guy named Brett from Suches, GA. He told me stories about his SOBO thru a few years ago and I felt like I had so many questions but I just couldn't get them out. Once he picked up other thru hikers, the shuttle just went silent. People were less hesitant to talk just on the fact that I couldn't relate to these people (yet) that had been hiking for a few days on end. It was a forty minute drive and my mind raced as we approached Amicalola.",,View Entry,"Apr 13, Tue",0
Juice,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635502,"Upon arriving to Amicalola, I was ultimately lost. New state, new place, Christ, I had barely even looked at the map of the park before coming here. I knew there was an arch, a waterfall and well... that's about it. My shuttle driver showed me around. He showed me the arch and where to register with the ATC. Upon his departure, I still didnt know how to process exactly what in the hell I was doing. I'm taking six months off of my life to live in the woods and walk? Alright, fine with me.
I walked up to the ridge runner, registered, and then let him ask me questions. Some of them were outright bogus like; have you set up your tent? Are you carrying water? I guess he must've had some people totally unprepared in the past or ran across some who thought they could hike 2,000 miles with just the skin on their backs. I mean I was clueless, but who knows? Could've been worse.
After the ""lesson"", I walked back over to the arch and started to just take off my jacket, get water, and get comfortable. As I was focused on my pack and getting things in and out without altering the so ""perfect"" stacking system I had worked out the night prior to leaving, some guy just started talking to me. His name was Tom and he was dressed in all camouflage and was making comments on how my pack was so light and how he was carrying all this extra stuff. All I knew right then and there is that I was probably a little bit better off than most with my pack weight. After a lengthy talk, I headed up the East Ridge Trail and immediately realized how hard this trail was going to be. All those people who just think it's a ""walk in the woods"" are only slightly correct. At the top of the falls, I used what would be my last source of true running water. I took a photo of the falls and was on my way. 
Eventually I got to a clearing point and was in dire need of a break. I set down my pack and felt instant relief on my shoulders. Upon sitting alone with my oatmeal packets for a few minutes, I was joined by a crowd of six or so hikers. They were all friends or relatives from Michigan or the surrounding area and were hiking the trail together. There were too many names to remember, but I'm sure I can remember their faces. We carried on casual conversation and one of them decided to start talking about what they called ""brown incidents"" and how some marathon runners will poop themselves in order to shave seconds off their finish time. Was this trail the same? Are people that desperate to get to Maine? That was quite the first encounter with my fellow hikers.
I continued about the rest of the day alone and made it to Springer in the midst of a light drizzle that would turn into a rain storm at night. For a starting point of a long distance trail, Springer was anticlimactic at least. But the view didn't matter, it was the feeling of accomplishment I got just for being there. To see the plaque etched in the rocks at the summit and to think of those who had passed through here before was something like no other. It was the true start to a journey to follow in the coming months.","Amicalola Falls State Park

Juice,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635504,"To say my second day was easy, would be a lie. If you want to talk about a rude awakening to a thru hike, I feel like I got hit from all angles. 
After my somewhat leisurely day up the approach trail, I was feeling great knowing I had overcome the odds and actually started the trail and done some miles. I had my tent all set up and said ""I got this!"" with a cheerful grin and optimistic look on my future, but that was soon to change. 
My first night staying at Springer Mtn shelter was one hell of a rude awakening. I awoke to find myself shivering, pelted by rain, facing the harsh elements that Mother Nature had brought upon me. I couldn't get myself to stay asleep. The rattling of rain and the howling winds kept me from even getting close to having a ""good nights sleep"". Eventually though, I fell asleep and awoke early in the morning.
In the early morning, the rain had been nearly put to a stop and was now a mere drizzle. Immediately upon waking up, i felt a cold spot on the tip of my toes only to realize that a pool of water had collected in the corner of my tent. My feet had been dipping in and out of this puddle all night, and I didn't think anything of it. I'm sure this happened because I didn't pitch my tent right in that corner, note to self, SET YOUR TENT UP RIGHT OR ELSE.
On top of the water incident I had, my eyes were puffy, my nose was clogged, and I could've sworn I've either been punched in the face or something. I was not ready for summer allergies and was all too used to the winter dryness of my home state of Maine. Needless to say, I was eager to get out of camp and be on my way as soon as possible. 
Upon leaving my campsite, soaking wet and puffy, I was approached by a guy who proceeded to ask me for a lighter as he had left his on the plane or lost it somehow. Seeing this made me realize, man, my morning was bad but some can have it worse. We chatted a bit and I gave him a light and then was on my way.
In the morning mist, I wandered out onto the trail and went on my way, feeling the weight of my pack and my face after a nights ""rest"". 
Eventually I met up with another guy who was a little older than me but was from New Hampshire and he told me about his adventures in the Whites. He was saying that he had done winter hiking, (something I had never done, but knew I wouldn't enjoy), and I thought he was crazy for it. Imagine Mt. Washington in the snow, yeah? No thanks. He told me how he had prepped so much and was looking forward to doing big miles today, I tagged along and ended up doing 15 that day. My biggest day possibly in my whole life, but somehow I still felt good. Talk about youth resiliency.
This day, I got my first taste of trail magic. A guy who had hiked the trail over 10 years ago told me his story about how he had section hiked over the years and eventually completed the whole 2,200 mile trail. That's some commitment. Six months is one thing but over a few years? That's a lot. In addition to his stories, him and his wife gave us ham sandwiches and cokes, which I can say definitely contributed to big miles that day. I socialized and eventually played ""leap frog"" with many others that were at the trail crossing throughout the day.
I ended the day with 15 miles under my belt, feeling good at Justus Creek. I bounced back from a rough morning and continued on, optimistic and ready for the trail to come.","Springer Mtn Shelter

Juice,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635517,"After the first pleasant rest with a flat, near perfect campsite, I was ready to go. Only one issue, the next section requires a ""bear can"" or a hard shelled bear canister, something I did not have. This led to me taking a slow day, even though I could have definitely pushed on. That first 15 miles the day prior did not phase me (well not yet). I knew I had to pace myself at some point as I didn't want to burn out or get injured by going too quick, so I guess this was beneficial.
I continued on with the day and had near perfect weather and possibly the best I'd seen in months! I was so over Maine winters and this was nice for a change.
The man from New Hampshire who I was hiking with yesterday began to outpace me and we slowly went our separate ways for the first few hours, but would continue to meet along the next day or so. That's the way it goes on trail.I continued on the day alone, but not for long until I met up with a somewhat familiar face from yesterday. This man turned out to be one that I met at the crossing with trail magic. Turns out his name is Spokes and I started to get to know him better. He told me a little bit about his past and how when he was really young, his first experience of hiking was wearing all cotton and walking alongside the freeway. Sounds like a fun time.
I ended the day earlier than usual, but fine with me. I got another good campsite with an easy trail to a good stream. It was just difficult to chill out for awhile and not be moving, especially after yesterday. Either I have to slow my role, or just hike on miles. Here's to all that's to come.","Justus Creek
",Lance Creek,"Apr 16, Fri",9.70
Juice,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635529,"I awoke this morning with a light sprinkle falling on my tent, no puddles this time though. Guess I'm really getting this whole tenting thing down. Regardless, I wanted to be out and moving. Every morning feels so much colder than it actually is and hiking really warms you up. Needless to say, I'm up early whenever I can be. I put away my tent as fast as humanely possible and headed up the trail.
Eventually, I met back up with Spokes, and we both went up Blood Mountain together. Let me tell you, the elevation chart for it makes Blood Mountain seem more steep than it actually is. 
The going up was the easy part, going down was another. Upon reaching the summit of Blood Mountain, I was greeted by a massive shelter, probably the biggest one on trail so far. It was made out of stone bricks and was just like no other. It felt more like a building than the other ones along the trail. I was also able to witness the clearing weather and was shortly greeted by partly sunny skies and an incredible unobstructed view.
Going down, was the difficult part. The trail was filled with steep descents for a little bit and then eventually mostly rocks. We went a ways down the steep rocks only to figure out that we were no longer on the trail (thanks for that sign on the tree!!!). It was quite the ways back up those rocks and was kind of an eye opening to the idea of you need to pay attention more. Who would've known? 2,000+ miles in the deep woods and you need to be aware? Crazy.
Eventually we made it down Blood Mountain and made it to Mountain Crossings. They had TRASH CANS, who knew that eventually something so basic as a place to throw things out would be considered a luxury. I stopped and just took in the views. This little building on the highway was the closest thing to civilization in the past few days. 
When at the store, I took my time to call who I could and eventually went inside the store. Inside the store it was just so insane to me. There were options upon options. After a few days of eating cold soaked ramen noodles and oatmeal, everything in there sounded good. I took some weird flavored cliff bars, date bars, spam, and almost anything that looked even slightly appetizing (truth is... it all did). I probably got too much for the next few days, but it was worth it. Spirits were high and I was ready to head down the trail.
We ended up spending the night at small campsite instead of pushing on another 5 or so miles to the next shelter. I thoughts be quiet but we had maybe 7-10 more people join us and it was kind of cool. We all sat around a little fire pit and began to get to know each other. I've met so many people so far and it's hard to remember names, but people somehow always find a way to leave a lasting impression.
Heard some snoring in the night, it didn't bother me much but some people were, let's say ""mad"" more than others. It's just something you have to deal with, no use in complaining. Overall it was another good night and onto the next one.","Lance Creek

Juice,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635547,"Had one hell of a night at the campsite last night. Was a very social group and I feel as if I'm starting to maybe come out of my shell or so. People are all friendly here and I find myself tending to remember faces more than names. The campsite was more crowded than usual and a few people were snoring throughout the night, but it's just something you have to get used to. A few other people also there had expressed their feelings about the night before but still, if you're around people it's gonna happen.  The plan today was to push almost 15 again today. Big miles but I was feeling good. The good thing about today was the trail was relatively flat and easy, not too many steep ascents or descents. The day flew by.We stopped for lunch at Low Gap Shelter and I had my first taste at a Mountian House meal. I cold soaked it, just because it's quick and easy and I gotta say it was pretty good. Thank you Spokes!! I had been having trouble getting myself into eating enough each day and I was starting to feel a little fatigued. Eating after a long, hard day is just too much work out here.Today, I also saw my first snake. I had never seen one in real life or even that big.  I was told it was harmless but man, I don't know. It looked pretty sketchy.The trail for the rest of the day continued on smooth and easy and even featured stone brick ""walls"" on the side of the trail. Maybe it used to be a road of some sort? Who knows.Was a good day and an easy 15, here's onto the next.","Baggs Creek Gap

Juice,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635709,"Due to the forecast for the next day and a half, we decided to catch a shuttle to town and do 3 miles into Rock Gap. In the morning, the trail was so foggy you could barely see three feet ahead of you. It was cool but at the same time miserable because of the pouring rain. 


At the Rock Gap trailhead, I saw Spokes for the first time since Hiawassee. We caught up for the first time in a few days and he was going to the same exact place as I was, crazy. Guess you can't get too far away from the same people.


Our shuttle driver was super nice and even gave us a tour of Franklin and showed us all the good local spots and which places were best to stay at. He even gave us donuts in the morning. Shoutout to Bobby The Greek! 


I had my first meal at Hardee's as I had never heard of it before, must be a southern only chain. It was decent for a $4 breakfast. Just enough to get through the morning.


We ended up staying that night at the Sapphire Inn. It was a nice small motel which was only $60 a night. We split the cost. The room was way nicer than the Budget Inn from a few nights ago.


My day consisted of eating a pint of ice cream, loading up on junk food and going to Hardee's once again in the morning. A good NERO every once in awhile is a good morale booster and this one was needed.


I'll have to face the rain again at some point, but not today. Here's onto tomorrow.","Long Branch Shelter
",Rock Gap,"Apr 24, Sat",3.50
Juice,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635598,"After a NERO in Franklin; Shootah and I planned do big miles once again. The weather was near perfect and the skies were sunny as we headed out onto the trail. The day before, it was just miserable. Pouring rain and fog so thick you couldn't see five feet in front of you. 


We got a ride to Rock Gap, (where we left off yesterday) from Bobby once again. He came in clutch and gave us some sausage and cheese McMuffins. I'll take any ""real"" food I can get at this point, no matter what it is. If you're looking for a shuttle in that area, definitely go with him, he was the best!!


Upon arriving back onto the trail with some free food, we were then stopped by another guy. He was handing out trail magic early and was saying how no one had been passing by where he had been set up the past few days. I got a hot dog with mustard and ketchup, previously unheard of at 9AM on a Sunday but when you're hiking, you'll take it.


We headed up the trail with full stomachs and went through Winding Stair Gap. It was very easy terrain compared to Albert Mountain from the night before. Smooth dirt felt like a saving grace when compared to the last quarter mile of Albert's summit.


It was all easy street until we got closer to Wayah Bald. The trail became much more steep. This climb felt like it went on forever and the passing of cars on the way up did not help whatsoever. Probably should've taken the road... 


Eventually, we made it to the top only to be told we missed trail magic! Twizzlers and cereal. We had already got it once that day, no need to be too greedy. At the top of Wayah, it was 5,342ft and had a big stone lookout tower on top. It had been restored in the mid 80's and had stood there ever since. It had been just over two days and two fire towers, if never gets old. 


Eventually we ended the day at Wayah shelter and I decided to sleep in the shelter again. All of the tent sites were on a slope and I didn't have too much energy left.","Rock Gap
",Wayah Shelter,"Apr 25, Sun",14.70
Juice,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635711,"Last nights shelter conversation was quite the interesting one. This was the second night I had slept in a shelter and this one was pleasant as well. I was kind of skeptical about those who usually do stay in shelters as so far, it's been the loud party type. But, tonight's group was pretty good. 


It was relatively silent until two of the other hikers began talking about music. They were having trouble remembering the name to a song and were saying the lyrics out loud and I chimed in with the title and immediately we started to click. We exchanged playlists and talked music for awhile. Conversation went on for hours and we began to talk about food (typical hikers). One guy who was an alpaca farmer from Pennsylvania began to talk about his food and had casually mentioned he was carrying a 2lb bag of peanuts. Insane. His pack weight was also 53lbs, and I don't know how he does it. 


Eventually, we got to a point where we talked about bad food experiences on the trail so far. I mentioned how my second day on trail I had to drink my coldsoaked ramen water that had lemon pepper tuna juice in it. That was probably the grossest thing I've ever eaten in my LIFE. 


We all went to bed around 8:00 and shortly before were asked if we wanted goodnight kisses and a bedtime story from Scott, one guy who was staying in the shelter. Makes you feel at home, right?? 



>span class=""s1"">

Eventually we reached Rufus Morgan Shelter and set up camp. The shelter tonight had mice holes dug around it and did not look too good. No thanks, I'll stick with my tent for tonight. Water was right by our tents and we were rejoined with the group from last night. The night ended with us all cooking dinner and once again talking about our cooking methods and I found a fellow cold soaker. Tonight's entertainment was watching people fail miserbaly at hanging their bear bags and getting the rock sack over a tree branch. It's all a learning experience. 


Overall today was a tough and good day, just like the last and we will be heading into the NOC tomorrow. Cannot wait to resupply with too much food and hopefully a good meal for once. Here's onto the next section...","Wayah Bald Shelter
",Rufus Morgan Shelter,"Apr 26, Mon",15.50
Juice,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635760,"Today was a low mileage but long day. We had planned to head into the NOC in order to get our GSMNP backcountry permits printed as well as a resupply. This morning was the first morning where I felt comfortable sleeping in and wasn't cold at all! I'm glad it's warming up but at the same time, the midday heat and the sun beaming on you is just so much. We had an especially dry stretch again today without water and I've been drinking lots more than usual. The first few days I had to force myself to drink water and now I'm chugging it like no tomorrow.
Once the doors open to the general store, we all flooded in only to be disappointed. Only basic stuff like granola bars and small ""To Go"" packs of Nutella and PB. I need the whole jar!!! I ran out of Nutella this morning and it has been a great ""pick me up"" so far. The only really good thing that we got there were microwaveable breakfast sandwiches. I got a french toast sandwich with egg, sausage, and cheese, delicious. The rest of the stuff wasn't quite up to snuff and or was just outright expensive. Even a small soda costed $3. I guess you can control the prices when you're the only option around.


I hung around a bit and got my permit printed as well as sorted through my food bag. I think I still somehow got too much food but only managed to spend about $20. ($35 is a good 4-5 day resupply at a dollar general, this wasn't). 


Eventually Shooter and I decided to leave the pack and head up the steep climb that was in store for us today. I had forgot to do something on my phone and had Shooter start alone. We eventually caught up at the end of the day though. I had a tough time finding exactly where the heck the trail started in this small town. I had to navigate through a parking lot, next to railroad tracks, and up a hill only to eventually find myself backtracking half way. I found the trail though.



Halfway up this climb I was exhausted. I decided to take a lengthy break only to realize that the guy next to me was one who I had just seen before a few days ago. He had recommended the Budget Inn I had stayed in while in Hiawassee and I had told him of my experiences there. We both laughed about it and caught up. He eventually told me that he had stealth camped at the NOC last night with an ex cop who turned out to be my good friend Spokes from a few days ago. Small world huh?


I continued on only to be told by a woman that there was a rattlesnake ahead. I had only seen one snake on trail so far but it was harmless. I met up with the guy from before and he showed me photos of that very same snake, it was MASSIVE. To think I had been scared of a small 3ft one, this would've been a whole other story. 


I continued up trail and had quite the day and really slowed my pace and took my time. I caught up with Mike as well as a lady who was a thru hiker in 2019. She gave me some tips as well as recccomended some gear. It was pretty late in the day and I was beat. I put on some music, ate some raw ramen noodles and cruised down to a campsite only to find Shooter and Andrew. We caught up and talked as we ate. No crazy convos this time...


I'm excited but hesitant about GSMNP. It's only a few days out and I plan to stay a night just outside Fontana. I'm hoping all goes good like so far and we don't get too bad weather (crossed fingers).","Rufus Morgan Shelter

Juice,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651444,"I know I haven't been the best with trail journals, but in retrospect I wish I would've posted on this more throughout my journey. instead, i focused more on entries in actual trail journals at many of the shelters along the trail. If you wish to see my angsty ramblings, thoughts and escapades, look for entries by ""juice"". You'll probably notice them right away as they stick out like a sore thumb. My entries were often really long compared to others. If anyone reads this and sees any of my entries on trail, I would love it if you sent them to me. I didn't take many photos of them and they truly captured how I was feeling and it would be cool to read them now post trail. If you need my email, post on my guest book or reach me on Instagram!!
I wish I could be here updating what bits and memories I have on trail but upon reaching Monson, I lost my phone in Hebron Pond after taking a zero in town. Was one of the least fun zeroes I had all trail, but in the end you live and learn. As corny as it is, ""the trail giveth and the trail taketh away"". I'd had many ups as well as downs on trail. Good fortunes, bad fortunes, and plain confusing ones too. 
Anyways, if you wish to see what transpired on my hike past early May (when I stopped updating), you can check out my Instagram @logan.laliberte

Anyways, enough about that. Here's my final journal entry, written on the morning of which I headed into Baxter. 

Yeah, hiking sucks but the people that hike this sh** are some of the greatest people I've ever met. Through the highs, lows, and the angst I've expressed in these logbooks, the past six months have been so special. I haven't come away with a meaning for life, a true purpose, or a sudden longing for something, BUT, I've realized what's important. I love you all and am so f****** hyped we made it. To all of those I've hiked with, caught me on good days where I was bouncing off the walls, or on the lesser days where I could snooze on a rock for an hour, thank you for everything. As a friend ""Trippy Hippy"" said, ""THERE ARE NO BAD DAYS!""
""it ain't the leaving that's grieving me, but my true love that's bound to stay behind""
