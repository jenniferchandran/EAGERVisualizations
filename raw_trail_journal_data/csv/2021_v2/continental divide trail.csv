continental divide trail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626171,"It's been bad weather the last couple of days so I've spent all day on the computer filling permits, reserving shuttles, buying gear and finishing my passport application. Less than two months away seems like it won't be enough time for all the preparations and training hikes. Anybody that's been on a long thru hike knows the drill.
I have looked into some different resupply companies just to have more options. I used Zero Day Resupply last year for difficult or nonexistant places to resupply like Pie Town, Ghost Ranch, Salida, Atlantic City, Benchmark and others and it turned out well. I can usually resupply with all I need if I can just get to a dollar store. Well back to the computer, looking to buy a new inflatable sleeping pad.",,View Entry,"Feb 12, Wed",0
continental divide trail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626206,"With all the preparations, training, purchasing gear and hours and hours of thought sometimes I wonder why we do this. For an older guy it's so tough to keep up with the demands of the trail and commitment to do the miles each day.Last summer when I was doing the Great Basin section in Wyoming, it was almost a burn out spot for me. But something usually happens like a beautiful vista or panoramic scenery that you come across. That day after resting there in the middle of the trail, I noticed a marker that showed I was on the Oregon Trail. I thought how fortunate I was to be in the very spot that hundreds of western pilgrims crossed and faced many hardships on their trip west.",,View Entry,"Feb 14, Fri",0
continental divide trail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626217,"I always feel more secure and confident when I pitch a tent which makes sleep so much better for me. The night condensation together with bugs and mosquitoes usually kept me inside my tent. There were places that I did use just a bed roll but had a structure overhead like a pavilion, trailer, barn and once an old boxcar. Once I found the perfect place to cowboy camp which was in Marysville, Montana. It happened to be on the back porch of the town's bar/grill. We had running water, outlets to charge our phones,  a porta potty, tables and chairs and the owner gave use a bucket of iced beer to relax with the rest of the evening",,View Entry,"Feb 15, Sat",0
continental divide trail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626561,Been trying to print maps of all the long difficult sections I'll be going through. Last year I exclusively used Guthooks for navigation and only once or twice relied on a map. There are many confusing spots you will get to on the trail with no visable tread to see or times you get off trail a bit and it will make you go crazy.I met a hiker last year that only used a map and compass so I know it's possible. So I've been going to rugged terrain to practice more with my maps and compass. I'll be going through the Black Range on a new trail so this will be the first time I'll be tested.,,View Entry,"Mar 03, Tue",0
continental divide trail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632997,"Later this afternoon, I'll complete this 1250 mile train ride from Alpine, Texas to Atlanta, Georgia. First timer to rail travel so this has been an experience. Tonight I'll probably check my gear 10 times before leaving in the morning for Springer Mountain. I keep thinking of stuff that I might need while I'm sitting here on the train. I forgot a wash rag that I use for too many things to mention but mainly shaving. I know you're suppose to grow a beard on trail but not for me.For most young people that hike the long trails, a year or two is nothing. But now thinking back two years when I did the CDT at 62 years old things sure change fast and you need to do whatever trails you can now and not wait. We'll I need to check my supply of Cliff bars and Snickers since I ate so many on the train. I really haven't studied the trail as good as I should have so the rest of the train ride I'm reading AWOL and Guthooks guide. Well I'll see you on the trail and get back with the rest of you.",,View Entry,"Mar 07, Sun",0
continental divide trail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633047,"Not much time but to just say I'm here at the jumping off place. Almost missed my ride up here, forgot I made a change to Eastern Standard Time. Gonna try to make as many miles as I can this afternoon and do another entry then. See you on the trail, if not I'll get with you later. God bless everyone that helped so far.","Springer Mountain

continental divide trail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633104,"Today is another perfect day for hiking the trail. I always leave really early6:30 to 6:45am. The mornings have been around 40° just perfect for an early start. It's not spring yet so very hard to identify any trees. I have learned the named of several trees and plants, can't wait till everything is in full foliage. 
Like learning about local history from people we come across. One guy showed me where gold mining had taken place, just couldn't image Georgia having gold mines. I didn't hike too long today about 2:30 was it. Lot of the same hikers showed up at Gooch shelter as the night before. The trail is hard, it's not a cake walk like I thought it would be. Tomorrow I will have to put a really long day since they don't allow camping on top of Blood mountain. I need to start doing this log earlier because I get so tired I fall asleep by 8pm. Well I'll  see you on the trail tomorrow and get back with the rest of you","

continental divide trail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633105,"Started today really early because it would be 17 miles to Neal's Gap. It wasn't as cold as yesterday morning not even any condensation on my tent, must have been very low humidity through the night. Left 6:30 on the dot allowing for 10 hours of hiking. It felt like all uphill till the top of Blood Mountain. Didn't meet up with just a few thru hikers all day, probably because I left so early. The views from the top were stunning and breath taking. The descent off this mountain was terribly slow because of the steepness and the large amount of rocks. Got to Neal's Gap got pizza, some resupply, a quick shower then up the trail a short distance to make camp. Met some different hikers, then we made a fire, talked awhile. 
Well I'll see you down the trail and everyone else I'll get back with you.","

continental divide trail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633190,"Started out from Neal's Gap and a very steep climb to start the day. Was windy all night and  remained that way for a 6:45  start. Views brome open to the east and west, very nice morning. The morning was strenuous,  then for noon the rest of the day was nearly downhill to camp. I met lots of section hikers. Took a slow pace today and enjoyed the surroundings. There were lots of hikers at the shelters but a great spot with a nice spring flowing through the middle of it for our water source. First time to sleep inside the shelter, may do it more if not too crowded. Met a person from Ft. Davis close to where I live. We had another great campfire and a place to talk philosophy. Well see you down the trail and I'll get back with the rest of you.","Gooch shelter

continental divide trail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633196,"left Low Gap Shelter at 6:45 this morning, the morning warmed up very quickly and off for a day in town to resupply and for some Cafe food. The elevation profile looked good and made 10 miles by 10am. The place we were to hitch into town was a great spot and got picked up in a few minutes. There was a Trail Angel there giving out all kinds of snacks and drinks. This is a beautiful little mountain town and has a large lake for boating and fishing. Wish I could stay longer but will hitch back out at 7am. This is truly a hiker town with so much support from the community. Well see you on the trail in the morning and I will get back with the rest of you.",,View Entry,"Mar 12, Fri",0
