Kristen Shepherd Hampton,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632971,"I know I’m not training hard enough, but I keep thinking I’ll rise to the occasion when I’m actually on the trail. I know it’s going to be tough, but I’m taking 10 days to hike from Springer to above the NC border. That’s it, not thru hiking, just taking my dogs on a really long walk up the top of Georgia. 
I’m 56 but I feel alternately 42 and 86. I have had persistent body pain for years now, looking like arthritis in my hips and lower back. Makes me not want to move. In the back of my mind, tho, I had been thinking about the AT, wondering if I could do it in sections, maybe one state a summer, something like that. Then a friend mentioned she was training to do Georgia and that was it—I was underway myself.
My gnarly Triple-Crown hiking, extreme athlete cousin, Levi “Rocks” Mason, turned me on to trail runners. I have two pairs of Altra Lone Peaks, first I got a pair of 4.0s off Ebay, then, worried I wear them out before my departure date, got another pair of used 3.5s. Like the 4.0s a lot. The others will tide me over.
Found a Big Agnes UL1 tent like new for $200. It’ll be tight for me and my two dogs, but should be toasty. Already had a good down bag, rated down to 30. Using my husband’s old Gregory “Reality” internal frame pack. It’s around 60l so should be plenty of room. It has 2000 straps dangling like noodles off every side. Mystifying. I may figure out a use for every one before I’m through. 
I have an old Whisperlight camp stove that I haven’t learned to work yet, I just know the first step is to burn off the old white gas we have, so that will be exciting. I have a Pur water filter that will work for this short trip. Just going to fill Smart Water bottles and a .5l rubbery bottle/bladder I’ll hang off a shoulder strap for quick access. The Camelback type bladders and their tubes for me have an unfortunate association of being catheterized as a young child, plus I can’t tell how you keep them clean, so I’m keeping it simple. I’m going slowly enough that I can stop and refill my small bottle as necessary.
I have decided against carrying a bear canister and will circumvent (“blue blaze” I’ve heard it called) Blood Mountain for that reason. Not even sure I’m getting an Ursack, since they are pricey. In the olden days we just hung regular bags and that always worked. Am a little more concerned about waterproofing and need to look into some dry bags. 
Need to get a second dog pack. The first is an old REI bag I got used for $20. Had to make a new martingale strap, but it’s working fine now. The dogs eat so much, especially the puppy, that I have to make them carry some of that weight.
Well, I’m pretty obsessed about this undertaking, but I’m trying to be a good Mom and meet my families needs as I prepare.",,View Entry,"Mar 05, Fri",0
Kristen Shepherd Hampton,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632988,"I have one dog pack and two pack dogs. I put the pack, which currently weighs 3.5 pounds, filled as it is with about two dog/days of kibble, on the elder dog, Pi, while she’s fresh and let the puppy, Tau, leap and thunder around as is her wont. Half-way through my hike I put the pack on Tau and give Pi the rest of the day off. 
This is not going to work on the AT. I expect to resupply before North Carolina, but I am not sure about finding dog food. The girls (they are both female) will be eating about 10 cups of feed/day between the two. I have read that they can safely carry between 10 and 12% of their body weight. They are both around 47 lbs, so that’s 5.64 lbs each. From what I can tell 5 lbs will be about 20 cups of food not including the pack weight, so they could each carry 4 days of food, especially if they eat it along the way. I plan to be out for 10 days. That leaves me with 15 lbs of their food, plus supplemental “pour-ons”, their blanket, leash, feed/water bowls, Musher’s Wax for their feet. I’ll need some of that for mine at this rate—and a lot of Vitamin I(buprofen).
People advise me not to bring my dogs, but I’m going to try it. If it sucks I won’t take them through NC when I do that section next year. I think the Smokeys disallow dogs anyway.",,View Entry,"Mar 06, Sat",0
Kristen Shepherd Hampton,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633062,"This is Tau. She will be 1 on Pi Day. Her fur-enemy’s name is Pi, but Pi was born on my father’s birthday, 12.14, not 3.14. 
I did hike today. I am making up for lack of extended elevation changes by wearing a 35 lb pack. I am planning to add enough weight to my pack in the next weeks so that when I leave Springer, the mountain won’t be the only one.At the moment I am lugging 5 lbs. of rice; 4 l. of water; my Thermarest, cook set, stove and a liter of white gas; Mark Bittman’s “How to Cook Everything Vegetarian,” and some clothing. The whole pack weights 35 lbs. I can’t rightly call this my base weight, because half my gear’s not in there. Base weight means no food or water, right? Still a little worried about this—I will be carrying so much dog food. I am thinking of prevailing upon my family’s generosity and having them drive me up to a town mid-way so I can leave dog food for us.
I kept my actual gear in my pack for a while but then got nervous someone would take it out of my car; I have avoided the portage between car and house, so now I haul my pack inside each night. That’s another 100 feet a day lugging my pack!My trekking poles stay in the car. I haven’t been able to frighten myself into thinking that someone will recognize their value: My almost-new Black Diamond, cork-handled poles were $60 at a virtual flea market, but would be twice that to replace, especially without the luxury of time to cruise the outdoor-gear lists. 
I am having a lot of fun pulling my gear together. I am a tightwad, plus my income got COVID and almost died last year, so I am all about the Facebook gear markets and Ebay. I am happy with every purchase so far, touch woods.",,View Entry,"Mar 08, Mon",0
Kristen Shepherd Hampton,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633160,"Hiked 3.7 miles today with a 35lb pack like it weren’t no thang. Getting stronger—but no lighter. Reducing my actual weight seems like a good idea if I want to travel lighter. Short of that, I’ll just keep the pack weight going up for a while. I understand larger muscles burn more fat so this should be moving my own weight in the right direction. Thinking about my knees. Disinclined to bring knee supports if I don’t need them. Leaning toward carrying an ace bandage for all my old-lady-joint needs. If both knees go out, I can cut the bandage in half. Found a second dog pack. I will have spent $80 on dog packs! Meanwhile, those hounds are bringing home dead baby bunnies and breaking my heart. Foul beasts.",,View Entry,"Mar 11, Thu",0
Kristen Shepherd Hampton,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634565,"It’s getting detailed! My cousins lent me a JetBoil stove, a Hyperflow filter and a pack cover so I can now get fairly accurate base weights, currently 25 lbs. When I put the food and water in it got to 42.8, but I have since taken a more critical look at my food and found I had definitely over packed. If I can keep my total weight to 40 I’ll be OK, especially since that number starts diminishing with the first snack (until resupply!).I will mail a box to Mountain Crossings, then my aunt and uncle, Niki and Jim Mason, parents of the indomitable Levi “Rocks” Mason, will meet me at Tray Gap to top me up for the remaining few days.I am so relieved to have figured out the dog food thing—I will only carry their treats and supplemental stuff like peanut butter and olive oil—which I expect to eat, too! They are doing fine with their packs at 5.2 lbs, or about 11% of their body weight. This will drop after the first meal, and I hope to have them carry their treats after that. The whole thing seems a little odd still—the timing, whether is is appropriate to leave my family at this point, but the training has been positive and has had a good affect on my body pain and energy levels. Stay tuned!",,View Entry,"Apr 09, Fri",0
Kristen Shepherd Hampton,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634820,"I’ve made a drop-off plan with my husband, and the girls and I will be on the Trail in one week! I feel like a racehorse at the starting gate—only my veins don’t pulse over gleaming limbs and I don’t champ my bit with foamy lips. Well, maybe just a little foam . . .
I will send my first resupply box tomorrow. Having read “A Walk in the Woods,” “AWOL on the AT,” and “Just Passing Thru,” I got a bit star-struck calling Mountain Crossings to confirm shipping details, but the attendant was friendly and efficient, and I am good to go. 
I refuse to test my sleeping gear before we leave—why waste a good night’s rest? I expect numerous sleepless nights, even though I have opted to bring a pillow. I figure the dogs will spend the first few nights starting at all the new noises, creaking trees, snapping twigs, raccoons and owls calling, hikers arriving late to the shelter. I desperately hope I can keep them from full-on nocturnal baying. The puppy sounds like an actual werewolf when she gets going. That is sure to make us real popular.
I will spray my belongings with permethrin Monday to discourage the ticks and mosquitoes. I will wear bug repellant as needed. Waiting to hear back from the vet RE what to put on the dogs. I got them some (really expensive, huge and meaty) anti-inflammatory pills. If they start limping or lagging, I may administer those. To manage my own discomfort I will alternate using ibuprofen and acetaminophen—liver damage kidney damage liver damage kidney damage. I am expected to survive. Blisters will be prevented with grease or powder or soaking in an icy stream or not at all. My trail runners are really broken in, so I am hopeful blisters won’t be a big issue. I am prepared, however. 
I have modified my food, cut back on some excess. I will probably develop a long-term aversion to gorp and veggie chips—I plan to eat this every day for lunch. More than anything, I am looking forward to the Snickers. I don’t get to eat Snickers except at Halloween, and then only after wresting them from my children. These Snickers will be ALL MINE. I am bringing a few extras to share. Maybe that will appease any disgruntled neighbors.
I will miss my kids and husband. I expect the time to feel long some days, but I welcome that. It will remind me of being young.",,View Entry,"Apr 14, Wed",0
Kristen Shepherd Hampton,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635045,"We have a hurt paw on Puppy 2. Our status is “Pre-Hike” — I leave Wednesday — which now may means Tau, and possibly Pi, will be staying home. That will really change everything for me. One of my top reasons for hiking is to spend the hours watching Pi and Tau being dogs. If I am going alone, I am not sure what will distract me from the discomforts of the trail. Maybe music, that could be OK, but I really would miss my familiars. Music will be there either way. I gooed the girls down with a topical tick preventative, bad timing because they both came home smelling fishy yesterday—not for the first time. There is a culvert or swampy patch nearby that Pi loves to soak in and Tau inevitably gets mixed up in, even tho she doesn’t enjoy swimming like Pi. They were due for baths after this adventure, but the medication requires 24 hours to dry, so the fur girls will enjoy their scent camouflage for another day—and a temporary stay of the humiliation of a scrub-down.Today looks like a good day to permethrin my clothes and tent. All these pesticides, make me think about Parkinson’s Disease. This level of exposure is negligible, and unlikely to cause any issues for me, but it does feel defiling to carry these toxins into the wild. Humans are gross, but ticks are grosser.",,View Entry,"Apr 18, Sun",0

Kristen Shepherd Hampton,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635466,"Rob walked me to the top of Springer from the parking lot. Cool and windy. I signed the register, we turned around and I was on my way. 
It was a downhill walk to Stover Creek Shelter. There I was one of the first arrivals, but by the end of the evening eight others where set up and cooking dinners. I thought I was going to stay in the shelter but then found a sheltered  spot down the hill, closer to the stream and the continuation of the trail. 
It went down to 33 that night, I was really cold—-even with every piece of clothing on that I brought. But I was really worried about Pi. She didn’t want to come into the tent. I hauled her in once and even put my puffer jacket on her. She slept for maybe 45 mins, then went back outside. She was there in the morning, sitting up staring into the woods.","Springer Mountain

Kristen Shepherd Hampton,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635613,"After a frigid first night out, Iwalked and talked with “Elsa” from “Illinois-not-Chicago” for long enough that she persuaded me to pass up my original destination, Hawk Mountain, in favor of getting to Cooper Gap, where we were planning to get picked by the Above the Clouds Hostel. There is a paw print by their description in AWOL’s guide, but there was no paw print when we called from Hawk Mountain. I wasn’t too bummed, and decided to keep going; the Hawk Mountain Shelter would have been too short of a day anyway.
“Elsa” was a bit chagrinned for having affected my plan, but I encouraged her to skedaddle so she wouldn’t miss her ride. 
Pi and I made it up and over Sassafras (stunningly beautiful, and will elaborate when I get home and have a keyboard!), and trotted through rhododendron tunnels— kinda spooky in the late afternoon light — all the way to Gooch Mountain Shelter. I had, apparently caught up with all the cool kids—Genie from Jersey City, Kitchen Sink and Wesley from somewhere in GA, Dashing Danny, Ryan the traveling nurse, Lonny the Gentle, Chugga-Chugga and Choi-Choo from Nashville, another dog-hiker, and several others. 
I slept in the shelter, but was only a little warmer. Pi stood guard all night again and wouldn’t come to bed. She was freezing and growling at everyone. She really scared a few people who mistook her for a wild animal. [EMBARRASSED-FACE EMOJI]

Kristen Shepherd Hampton,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635776,"The hike to Lance Creek offered panoramic views of rolling mountainsides and the first foliage of spring. An exhausted Pu found an overhung rock to climb under and took a long nap. A new friend, Maren, came puffing up the mountain. After a brief visit, she endeared herself to Pi by feeding her several slabs of venison jerky. 
The evening was warmer, plus we had a first campfire, and I enjoyed getting to know some new comrades.
The weather Doppler for the next day looked like lava spreading over North Georgia. Eddie, a new friend, planned to beat the storm by starting out at 5:00 AM. Pi was vigilant all night again.","
",Lance Creek,"Apr 23, Fri",8.30
Kristen Shepherd Hampton,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635778,"The Weather Doppler looked like lava spreading across North Georgia. The storm was supposed to hit mid morning and become severe by mid day.
My hiking buddy, Eddie, announced he was going to be up at five and hike in the dark to Wood’s Hole shelter where he planned to wait out the storm. We hadn’t been able to overnight in that shelter because we did not bring the bear canisters required in the areas surrounding Blood Mountain. I followed Eddie’s suit and left at six, walking through the dark with my headlamp on. All I could see of Pi was the reflective strip on her backpack. At one point I rounded a bend and the hillside lit up like a starry night with 500 trillium flowers reflecting my headlamp.
By the time I got close to Wood’s Hole shelter the wind was 30 mph with pelting rain. I was becoming afraid Pi and I were heading into hypothermia territory. In fact so worried was I, and struggling against the wind, I missed the turn to the shelter. I was at the bottom of the rock stair steps ascending Blood when a jaunty guy with a silver umbrella appeared out of the mist. 
“How are you doing?” he asked.
“Not so great,” I was a little weepy. He helped me understand that I had passed the turn-off a half-mile before at Turkey Stamp. I had been head down and half blinded by the rain and has plowed straight passed the sign.
There were eight people sheltering at Woods Hole when I arrived. Eddie had been there for some time there already. This is a long tale, and one that merits more exploration, but the short version is that I could not get warm and my dog was shaking. I was worried she was getting seriously cold. I was soaked to the skin but didn’t have a change of dry clothes. I only brought one of everything (OK, two undies) in the interest of saving weight. I made hot drinks and some food for myself and fed the dog, but I was still cold. Finally I decided just to strip off the wet clothes even though I have nothing to change into, and I remained in my cashmere sweater under my (soaked and flat) down parka and windbreaker. Soon I stopped shaking and was able to attend to Pi. The rain was predicted to diminish by 2 but I still had many difficult miles ahead and I wanted to check into our cabin ASAP, so  by 12 o’clock I moved on. The dog  refused to follow me, I had to go back and haul her by her leash. I have never seen her looking more miserable and I feel like a terrible owner to be making her go through this. 
When we finally got to Neels gap, taking the Freeman blue-blaze trail around Blood, I wrote to my family to see if someone could come get the dog. It was not going to be easy for them so I decided to take a zero day between two nights at Blood Mountain cabins.
Pi slept for 24 hours. To prevent another threatening incident like that, at the famous Mountain Crossings I bought a Marino wool base layer top, a sleeping bag liner which might be more for the dog, and a hat. I feel much more prepared now.
After pizza and cheeseburgers and two good nights sleep I was ready to carry on.","

That said, miles have almost no meaning for me out here. When you spend a mile ascending 550 feet it takes a whole lot longer than a flat mile. Steps tell a more realistic story. Today I walked 18,671 steps, pretty reasonable, but all of it seemed like a LOT farther than 8-ish miles that would represent at home. The campsite on top of Tray has a beautiful view from a rock outcropping.

Found my buddies Sunshine, Chugga-Chugga and Choo-Choo having lunch on the rocks opposite the NC/GA sign. I took Pi’s pack off and we lounged for a few moments, singing the Rocky theme song whenever new hikers would cross the state line. 
The afternoon was wearing on when Lucky hollered: “Rattler!” Annie, the actor from Atlanta, was a few paces ahead of him when she had heard the rattle and froze. Those behind accelerated up to get a look. We saw a black 3.5’ rattlesnake, rattle buzzing like a locust, coiled defensively on the trail. Much discussion—wait for it to move, get a stick? Finally a young man who had “studied zoology” used his hiking poles to encourage the snake off the trail. We all got a look at its triangular head in silhouette against the leaf litter.

The walking was easier than I thought. Sugar was essential to my success, and I have since lost about 5 lbs. of water-weight after a refined-carb diet. I had migraines on and off, wouldn’t notice them walking so much, but at night I took meds, along with the pain-med du jour.  I am so glad to be off that diet, but I think it was key for the energy requirements. I can remember some miserable backpacking and, in retrospect, I’d wager my pack was way too heavy and I didn’t have enough quick calories on board. Not sure what to think about the AT thru-hiker diet—candy GORP and Poptarts for breakfast. I think the bloating and inflammation was a sign of trouble, and would have caused some joint damage and maybe other problems. Good to be back on my regular diet—lots of veg, my garden back home is going full bore with all the rain and heat. This account is not the lyrical essay I had planned.
