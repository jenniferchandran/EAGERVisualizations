Starting gear weight was 38 pounds fully loaded with winter gear, 1 week food and a days water. Woohoo!!! Bring this on!!!! ****>>>>> (((Coming Back To Trail June 2020 / Moving Expenses Alot))) <<<<****42 days in, the new weight, after sending 8 pounds home and 2 and half pounds of winter gear and the sleeping bag (3 pounds) because of the hot weather is 25 pounds which is SOOO Much Nicer!!! Gear List is updated too!!!I am hoping that my new S6 smartphone with 8X zoom will be sufficient for the trail and taking all of those breath-taking photos!!! I bought my airplane tickets, reserved my hiker hostel package <<< awesome deal here (you take the subway for abojt 35 to 4the minute ride and they pick you up from the airport, transport you to their location, get bunk for the night, stop off in a town along the way for dinner, feed you breakfast in morning, give you 8 oz fuel << whatever one you need, drive you to 1 of 2 starting AT locations the following morning for $85.Boom that just happened!!! Hahaha!!! Super excited for this!!!",,Trail Prep,"Jan 28, Thu",0
Transporter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521438,"WOW!!!    How am I going to pack all this gear so that it fits while keeping a sensible order about it so that I don't have to empty my entire pack whenever I need to take out only one item? Since there are so many zippered compartments, I came up with this. My sleeping bag, pad and pillow will go at the bottom of the pack, the tent on top of those, clothes sealed in a large ziplock bag in the middle, bear can with food and anything that smells inside the can placing it vertical (doubles also as a chair) on the left and the 2.0 liter Platypus water pack vertical on the right side. The phone and charger will go on the right side belt zippered compartment in a ziplock bag for fast and solar charger with music and accessories on the left belt compartment. Rain gear, water filter and other quick needs will be in the top compartment that folds over the top of the pack to close off the top. Hopefully this design will hold and not have to re-arrange it too much depending on how it holds up",,All This Stuff in my Pack?,"Feb 01, Mon",0
Transporter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521439,"After attempting my first go round getting all that gear in my 3800 to 4200 CC pack, I almost succeeded. I had only my hiking poles on outside. Keeping in mind this is for the airplane trip portion only. All the gear fits in my pack no problem, but since the carry on policy is a 2ft by 2 ft, don't think my pack would make that haha. This is why I'm trying to get it all on the inside with only I Don't Care items on outside of pack.Going to try again, I know I can get this no problem.",,Practice Pack Cram,"Feb 02, Tue",0

Transporter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522192,"Examining my pack I noticed an important buckle snapped in two. I contacted emailed Osprey for a replacement. In the mean time, I  swiped a less important clip for repair. We woke up this morning and got breakfast served to us at the hiker hostel. We ate scrambled eggs, coffee, orange juice, apple juice, mini french toast, oats and oatmeal with berries, sugar and honey. After we finished breakfast, we piled in different (well broken in suburban) vehicles with different destinations. Some were headed for the approach trail (8.8 miles) that could be hiled before beginning the trail or the trail start.
We were dropped off at the approach Trail and we began our journey. 3000 feet of elevation gain is no joke. I have never been this tired before. I tried eating 2500 calories a day and that failed miserably. I had to boost to 3500 to get by.
Springer shelter had a sign with bear activity and a storm moved in for the night that sounded like a tent was set up in the high school gyms shower area with all the nozzles pointed at the tent full blast. This lasted throughout the darkness until the sun washes over the valley.","Hiker Hostel
",Day 1 (GA) Springer Mountain Shelter ,"Mar 01, Tue",11
Transporter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522292,"So we tried to sleep last night in the Springer Mountain shelter along with 10 or so other thru hikers and as soon as the lights went out, boom the serious rain hits. It sounded like a tent in the middle of 50 shower heads all aimed at it with full blast for 10 minutes slowly going to lesser speed and repeated for 3 hours. After morning approached it was 25 degrees or so and really hard to get out of bed. I gathered all of my supplies, waiting for my son to finish filtering his water. 30 minutes goesby and I'm thinking where the hell is he? One hiker goes to filter water and comes back, I asked is there still people down there? Yes he said. I asked my son when he came back what happened and he said well I had to learn how to my water filter sometime.
Smacks forehead.
Off we go after we got our packs completed.
It immediately starts snowing and the fog rolls in. We hightail it down the mountain trail as fast as we can with our poles. We hike around an hour to 90 minutes before we take a small break. We found a small clearing to have lunch next to a raging river and small waterfalls.Around 6 hours later we arrived at Horse Gap to camp for the night. Our diet consists of 4 packs of oatmeal in the morning with dehydrated berries for 600 calories. (Each pack is 150 cals.) We follow that with 1/2 cup trail mix = 375 cals, pop tarts @ 400 per pack, more trail mix x3, 2 kind bars @ 200 each and finish with 600 cal enhanced noodles with olive oil.","Springer Mountain Shelter 
",Day 2 Horse Gap & Hiker Diet,"Mar 02, Wed",10.30
Transporter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522404,"So we started at Horse Gap with about 25 degrees this morning, packed our gear and headed down the trail with decent weather. After about 90 minutes we stopped for a snack and continued on for 2 hours. We met 3 thru hikers, Cheryl, Mark and Dave. Cheryl and Mark gave up their reserved beds at the hostel and let us take them because they couldn't make it. God bless them. We have been hiking with Dave for the final push to Woodys Gap. With only 4 miles to Woodys Gap we waved off a ride offer and continued on. Halfway on the trail snow began to fall. The wind started to howl coating us with fresh snow. Later we finally pushed through at least 1 inch of snow to have a trail magic mobile home with hot burger vegetable soup, green tea and chocolate bars to boot. God bless them as they allowed us to warm up inside as we waited for the hostel to pick us up.","Horse Gap
",Day 3 Woody Gap,"Mar 03, Thu",10.60
Transporter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522528,"We sent home 5 lbs of gear between us. So we started at the amazing Hiker Hostel (description available from day 1) and had breakfast and dropped off to start at Woodys Gap where the snowstorm blew through us the night before. We trudged all day through mud, ice and melting snow. After around 4 hours we topped blood mountain and spent around 45 minutes enjoying the magnificent view atop the highest mountain in Georgia. After hiking down blood mountain for about 2.3 miles we arrived at Neels Gap. This place rivals Cabelas or Sportsman Wearhouse. They have just about everything a hiker could need to buy new or for repairs. We are hiking another mile to camp for the night. We stopped a half mile past Neels Gap.
We had to hang our food and anything with a scent from a tree using counterbalance. (2 food bag method) Tie a weight to one end of the rope, toss over tree limb at least 8-10 feet high, 4 feet away from tree trunk and 2 to 3 inches thick. Tie the 1rst food bag to one end or clip with a carabiner, pull that bag all way to the tree limb, attach or clip other food bag on the other end of the rope and push up lowest hanging food bag until they balance about 10 feet and at least 8 feet away from tree trunk. You can use trekking pole to push them up or pull bags down in morning. (1 food bag method) attach rock to one end of rope. Toss rocks end of rope over tree limb. Lower rock attached end to the ground. Remove rock and attach food bag with a carabiner to the rope. Pull to eye level. Take second end of rope and run it through carabiner. Pull food bag all the way to the tree limb. Wind tree limb, about hands length, into the rope. Release the rope slowly until the stick catches on the carabiner. Can be pulled down with trekking pole in the morning.","Woody Gap
",Day 4 Neels Gap,"Mar 04, Fri",10.60
Transporter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522616,"So we started at 815 this morning hiked about 2 hours and stopped to enjoy a view nestled amongst the mountaintops. It was a beautiful 50 degrees. We grabbed our gear and hiked about 90 minutes and ran into a huge group having lunch on a somewhat comfortable rock. We joined and we're entertained with the soft sounds of a person playing a ukulele. We headed out for 2 more hours and ran across Scorpion and Buckeye. They are hiking the trail for a variety of wonderful charities. We hiked on and stopped along the trail. We sat on a huge tree which had fallen down. We asked the running hiker that passed about how far the shelter was and he said a half mile. About 1 mile later we arrived at the shelter. It was filled with around 40 other hikers with tents, hammocks and other shelters. Couldn't ask for a better day to hike.","Neels Gap
",Day 5 Low Gap Shelter,"Mar 05, Sat",11.50
Transporter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522698,"*** Gear Review *** - The Copper Spur UL2 tent has had zero problems from standing up to rain 20 MPH winds, no condensation issues, no zipper snags or breaking and the rainfly clips to the tent and/or the ground sheet. - The Atmosphere 65 backpack has an anti gravity panda hug for the waist belt. It is a bit tough to undo when trying to wear the pack and one of the day pack clips that secure the top pack over the main compartment didn't survive the airplane trip to Georgia. I contacted Osprey and they were amazing with their customer service.- The etekcity (stove stand with fire type button striker) mini stove has been flawless except when the temps drop to below freezing and the strike button doesn't function well. It is good to have a lighter with for that problem.- The Stanley cookset is amazing. It has a folding handle to secure a ported lid that snugly fits on top of the main container which has a twist and lock feature that can separate from the stainless steel cook pot. I have dish soap, folding fork, green scrubby, mini microfiber towel that is secured in the main compartment while the whole system secures neatly from a 3 piece system to a 1 piece with one snap.
 Last night around midnight, the rainstorm set in blowing around 15 MPH. After we woke up our tents were frozen from the 30 degree temperature. Going down to unhook our food cans from the bear cables was a good distraction. Before eating oatmeal with dehydrated blueberries added in, we gathered our stuff and headed out for blue mountain. After passing and chatting with several other hikers like Frosty, Jag Happy and more we headed to blue Mountain after 3 hours of intense 45 degree up and down hiking. We took a few pics and headed to the bottom. After enduring 30 degrees in the morning and up to 70 degrees in the afternoon, we were greeted by Paul and Christina. God bless these two as they were tail gate style cooking brauts, burgers, ribs along with water and energy bars to go for the thru hikers that came off the mountain. This trail magic was legendary!!! You guys are amazing and a huge thank you from Transporter (Chad) and Radar (Branden).A bit later we had to hitch a ride to Helen which was 9 miles off the trail. After 6 tries, Kyle and his daughter stopped for us and we exchanged stories to find out he was ex-navy like Branden, what a small world. Huge thanks to these awesome people who gave us a ride, we enjoyed the ride immensely.","Low Gap Shelter
",Day 6 Mini Gear Review and Unicoi Gap,"Mar 06, Sun",9.70
Transporter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522828,"*** Hiker Notes***We should have prepared our Fontana Dam package at the start of our hike. It is about 2 ish weeks out and since we waited 7 to 8 days out, we had to pay prority shipping to make sure we got our food for the 75 to 100 miles of no food section in the Smokies that gets shipped to the lodge.About 3 days ago my inflatable pillow decides to not keep air at all. I tried putting duct tape over it resulting in a farting sound. Every night, I'd blow it up and it would put my head on the ground, I'd fold it in half, it'd deflate, folding in half again every 30 minutes. Finally getting to Helen, got some super Glue from the Dollar Store and smeared it all over the welded seam that gave out. Hahahhhaahh!!!! It is Alive again!!! Comfortable sleep is in sight!!!
We took a zero day to do laundry, recover our bodies, resupply food and plan ahead. The smokies are very near and we had to increase our mileage a day at a time. Realizing we were far behind on our calorie upkeep, OH yes we did!!!, we ate baconators from Wendys, Meatball subs, 12 inch from Subway and more. The problem for me was I was trying to lose only 4.6 pounds each month for a total of 20 to 30 over the entire trip, but after one week, was averaging 8 pounds each month. As fun as it was, very necessary, super happy satisfied grin and tummy to boot ended this day.","Helen Ga

Transporter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523070,"**** Hikers Note ***It was wonderful to mail our bear barrels home ditching 2 lbs each. We picked up some food bags from the hostel. Brandens new food bag snapped at the strap. We sewed it in the morning. He had to fend off mice for most of the night. Georgia was about 50% Up, 30% Down and 20% far between flats. Looking back overy the last 100 or less miles, rain, snow, heavy wind and heat did not stop us. We conquered you and respect you for the challenge.
We hiked 3.6 miles to Discuss Creek Gap where we waited for an hour before deciding to try to hitch the 11 miles to Hiawassee. No luck, we stumbled across the top of Georgia hostel. We waited 2 hours before getting a ride to town. After 2 more hours each, we got a ride back. After wasting around 5 hours to and from town, we continued on. Later we got back and hiked around 5 more miles before hitting the shelter near the water.","Deep Gap

Transporter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523110,"After a long hike today we made it to the top of Indian Shelter. As North Carolina opened up to us, we had no idea how much worse the upward angles were yet to increase. I thought Georgia steep angles were bad these are incredibly worse. We talked to a trail runner at the shelter and she said there was more to come, oh well. Tomorrow is another day.","Day 9 Plumorchard Shelter-NC Border

Transporter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523209,"******After we hit our 100 mile we celebrated by taking a polar plunge in 15 degree water fresh off the mountain as quick as we could. The water instantly froze our bodies as we screamed like little school girls *****
Ah we feel so good now. 12 am last night the wrath of the skies opened up. The tent is battered with rain, hail and strong winds for what seemed an eternity. The tent bent and swayed to accommodate the fury of the storm as each wind gust made the poles creak. After 2 hours the skies became calm. The sun illuminated the tent. Crawling outside, poptarts, hot coffee and yogurt bars await to become breakfast. After gathering our gear, we say goodbye to Birdy Blues, 1 mile and the legendary trail runner. As the trail comes into view, it is intertwined with mud, leaves, tree roots and cobblestone style rocks at a 45 degree angle. Venturing through the tree and leave formed tunnels that turn left, then suddenly right, while tightening all around us, we venture on. 40 degrees with a cooling consistent wind is our companion for a few hours. After what seems an eternity of up, the ridge line approaches. Thinking back about the trail runners heed, ""Beware of Albert Mountain"" stays in the back of our minds. We climbed the inense trail up to Albert Mountain in 16 mins from bottom to top and pressed on to the shelter.","Day 10 Indian Shelter 
",Day 11 (100 Mile Polar Plunge) Long Branch Shelter,"Mar 11, Fri",16.20
Transporter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523283,"After traveling 16.2 miles the previous day, we were weary from the trek over Albert Mountain. Waking to the sounds of birds chirping and the sun gently moving over the ridge to bathe the valley in its warmth. The clouds quickly cover the sun and the path goes from dirt covered to treacherous in only a matter of moments. 18 inches down to less than 1 foot wide with the path sloping to the deep side 5 degrees or more balancing on loose rocks and slippery tree roots. The humidity slowly drains our energy as we trek ever upwards. A refreshing breeze cools our sweat drenched backsides every now and then. The creak of trees can be heard in the distance as the wind sways the powerful trunks. Alas we reach a flat camping spot to rest our weary feet as 2 hours has passed. With heavy feet we reached the 7.5 mile road mark to Franklin which is 11 miles off the trail. OMG a Dr Pepper tasted unbelievable from the store after weeks of only water on the trail. We got a ride from the Gooder Grove Hostel which is a nice hostel to stay at in Franklin. 828-332-0228 phone number for Colin Gooder. After a few bounced around locations in town, we got a ride back to the trail and hiked another 4 miles to the shelter.","Long Branch Shelter

Transporter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523381,"As we woke to pitter pat pat pat put pat pat pat on the tent. We hoped it was a passing storm. I noticed my mouthpiece for my water bladder had become a gnaw fest for a rodent probably due to the alfredo sauce and noodles from dinner on it. I cut off what i could of it, washed it off alot and rinsed as much away as I could. After waiting until the last possible moment because mother nature was screaming for us to do our business, we went outside and that's when the skies opened up on us. We hurried as fast as possible to breakdown camp while being poured on constantly. Branden set his pack against a tree and went on to break his tent down. Something drew my attention to his pack. It seemed as the rain got harder, a ghostly hand swiped his perfectly balanced pack and it tumbled towards the rushing stream below. I hurried after it and stopped it only inches before it would have submerged. After about 20 minutes, camp was broke down and we continued up the trail with rain gear on. After 2 hours and 30 minutes we reached snowbird Gap which was covered in an eerie fog that seemed like the movie Silent Hill. After an arduous day we crest Wayan Bald hours later.","Day 12 Siler Bad Shelter

Transporter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523517,"*** Hikers Notes***
 What have I learned from 2 weeks in the woods? This is NOT how the movie A Walk in the Woods portrays it. Every day is a huge challenge of 30 to 45 degree ups and downs while the path almost always leans to the left from massive storm runoffs. I have hiked around 100 miles on mountain trails that were medium diffculty and this is way harder than that. My right knee hurt for 4 days, then left knee hurt for 6 days. If it wasn't for Aleve for 10 days and my hiking poles to lean on, this wouldn't be possible for me. I was in medium cardio condition while lifting weights. etekcity kitchen stove I have has a instant ignite button to catch the butane from the bottle on fire. This does not always work!!! Carry a mini lighter!!! The Cocoon travel pillow I have is garbage. It had leaks at 3 different areas of manufacturer welded seams. I've glued it twice and not again. This has never been stored in my pack near any sharp edges or anything. Can't wait for another pillow that doesn't deflate every 30 minutes at night. About 800 to 1000 calories in the morning, 1500 cals in snacks throughout the day and another 1000 at dinner have been perfect for me. I don't have mood swings, tired or dizzy spells and have energy all day. 3500 is what I am shooting for, but this is to lose weight over 6 months.
After waking up to winds that sounded like jet engines from an airplane taking off, we got up, ate poptarts, fiber bars and trail mix with some instant coffee. After hitting the trail for 2 hours, we were greeted with the serenity of 50 degrees and a subtle cooling wind and the chirps of birds in the distance. After climbing the mountain to Wesser Bald Viewing Tower, as we ascended, the skies turned black and we hurried up as fast as we could with no avail. The skies splashed us immediately with punishing rain on and off. We finally got to the viewing tower top and took a break. After we climbed down the tower we were met with medium rain that followed us down each slippery, muddy slope. We got nervous as thunder rumbled in the distance. We were standing on top of the ridge at this point. We scurried down and after a few more rumbles, the skies calmed. After being rained on all day, we finally made the 15 mile shelter stricken by slippery tree root, mud and rock laden paths.","Day 13 Lick Log Gap

Transporter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523715,"After we had to try and sleep through a guy who sounded louder than a lumberjacks chainsaw all night long, we left the shelter. 2 hours later we arrived at Locust Gap where we ate a quick snack. Later, we enjoyed a cooling breeze at our backs along with the sun following us. After 2 hours we arrived at Stecoah Gap. We ate a few snacks and thats when Jane pulled up and offered to share her strawberries, chocolate, cheese and crackers. We gratefully accepted. Shortly we headed back up a ridiculously steep incline that we weren't expecting. It was 60 to 70 degrees straight up with no stops visible. After falling over the top of the hill passing out on the top we moved on a short while later. We came to the Brown Gap Shelter where we talked to 4 day hikers taking breaks from various school studies. After a while we wished them well and headed downhill most of the way within only 9 miles of Fontana Dam. We were warned by a thruhiker about a heavy Norovirus infestation (diarrhea and cramps of you get it) at the Fontana Dam Shelter area and surroundings. Also, we warned him about the fluctuations of the virus around the NOC area.My wife sent us two packages, one was 36 lbs and the other smaller.

Transporter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523824,"Last night it was just my son and I at the campground. After returning from filtering water, we had 4 more camp guests show up. After everyone had done there settling in chores, a fire was built and everyone exchanged trail stories up to this point. We started with the tale of coming across 3 guys passed out in the middle of the trail sleeping in the midday sun and come to find out those guys were 3 of our campers Haha. They continued to tell of a guy who proclaimed he could not be stopped and was mr ultralight who hiked 22 miles a day carrying only 8 lbs a day. When he got out here hiking, he found every excuse he could and finally quit after 10 days. After we shared a few other laughs, Chuckles, Frodo, Gearbear and one more all went to bed.We were awoken by a bunch of screaming, not screeching owls. We all dismissed the craziness and got our gear and hit the trail.After 3 hours, we took a break and enjoyed the mountains. We hiked another 2 hours and got our first awe inspiring view of the magnificent Fontana Dam. After another hour we thought we were within jumping down distance to the dam, but found out after 36 more switchbacks up and down we were very wrong. After finally reaching the road, we phoned a shuttle for $3 a person and got a great tour of the town from Cody, who grew up there. We thanked him after he offered us a mellow yellow each, which we guzzled quickly. We got a room at the lodge where we sorted our huge food supply package with extras we received from my wonderful wife.","Day 16 Cable Gap Shelter

I will have more picture to post, but my Samsung S6 decided not to take a charge anymore and I had to send it to my wife so that she could take it to the store we bought it from.They would send it to corporate and then corporate would send a replacement back to the store, wife would get the phone from the store and mail ahead of me so I could pick up the new one. This might take a few weeks. Today was an amazing day. We spent the night in the Fontana Dam Resort. We had bbq pulled pork and stuffed meatloaf for dinner. We downed 3 soft drinks each and thought briefly about having a beer to celebrate Saint Pattys Day, but thought better of it as we had no more room to stuff our tummies. As we strolled happily to our room, we remembered we hadn't showered in a few weeks, except for using bio wipes. As we wrestled for who got to shower first it wasn't that important and I got to go first. Those scrubby gloves were heaven as they easily removed all the gunk off of ourselves. My hair was matted bad as if it were under a greasy sweaty hat for 15 days and came out presentable. Then the next shower/bath was taken and we fell backwards on the ultra Cush beds and almost crashed at that point. I thought since my sleeping pad never stayed inflated during the night, it might have a leak. I ran a bath and took the pad with me into the tub, after getting wet, I just took a normal bath with the pad on top of me and then I passed out in the tub from exhaustion. I awoke shortly and submerged the pad finding the one leaky spot. I dried it and put super glue over it and applied duct tape over the top of that and let it dry standing against the wall for the night. After watching Big Bang Theory, I fell asleep sometime quickly during the show. As I awoke in the morning, we had to bounce a package forward to the next postal address ahead and leave a forwarding address if anything arrived behind us. The post office didn't open until 11:45am so we lost a half day waiting on that before Cody dropped us back off where we started. After we ascended the semi steep hill we were cheered as we climbed on. After a few moments we were trailing the entire 25 miles of Fontana Dam. It was a majestical view of pure sky blue that was as clear as mountain water. How serene this sight was to behold. We wandered a bit further and finally got a view of our first sight of the massive dam. We walked down to the visitors center and were stopped by a gentleman named pioneer01. He asked us if we could help him with a small problem. We looked puzzled at one another and then he showed us the Krispy Kreme doughnuts and we got two each. We devoured the sacred food quickly and thanked him as he headed off.We crossed the dam taking random pictures and finally got to the other side where we began our journey into the Smokey Mountains. We didn't get super far because of the late start, but what a day it was. Ahhhhhh. We need to buckle down to get ahead of the possible snow this weekend in the mountains and get moving a good distance. The smokies are 71.9 miles long and it's good we have 3500 calories per day with 5 days of food from this point on.","Day 17 Fontana Dam Resort

We woke with lots of vigor today. We knew it was going to be a 8 hour 30 minute day today. After hiking for 2 hours everything seemed to be good. After 1 hour we got rained on constantly, lost in the fog that we could only see a few feet at a time, frozen by the winds. Every turn was a challenge. It wound left then right then up and down. Each piece of the path was a challenge because it was like walking up the bottom of a river. Each stone shifted and everyone was a different size. After hours went by, we found the stairs to the lord. We looked up and all that could be seen were straight stairs made of fallen logs that led into the unseen fog at the top. After a 100 feet of stairs, the fog would effervesce away, revealing continuous stairs that rose for another 1000 feet. Wearily we topped the ridge and passed other hikers heading the opposite direction and as the day progressed we finally made it to the Derricks Knob Shelter which almost wasn't believed at that time to be present. We finally got there and settled in for the cold night.","Day 18 Birch Spring Gap

After we said our goodbyes to Chessmaster, Lookout, Gearbear and 5 others, we were underway for our 13 mile journey. The first hour was breathtaking as we passed what should have been called the Evergreen Forest. A tunnel of trees layed ahead. Leaves were covered in frost. Attached to those tree leaves were perfect ice replicas of leaves.As we continued our path, the forest gave way to vibrant greens, pure blues and a multitude of colors. As a another hour set in, the snow began to fall lightly at first, then medium, off and on for an hour and half. As we crested more ridge lines, that's when the full snowstorm hit. After trapsing through mud, rock and slippery ascents that never end, we finally hit the top and began our descent into the final mile before the shelter.

Donning a short sleeve shirt, thermal shirt, jacket, beanie and sleeping bag, the long shivering night battle begun. Tossing and turning most of the night was the highlight of trying to find which position offered the least incursion of a chilly draft into the sleeping bag. Each had its bonuses and drawbacks. After what seemed an endless night, daylight finally crept into the shelter. After placing a toasty hand into the air, it was quickly drawn back which felt like thrusting a hand into an icy mountain river, the temps had reached the low 20's. A brave soul got a fire started and began to motivate the remnants of the shelter crew. After we gathered our gear, the frost whipped at our backs as a terrible reminder that the sole source of heat at this point was motion. Moving outside, the snow level rose from a few inches to 6 to 8 inches deep. We were horrified and amused at the same time. After a half mile hike from the shelter back to the trail, we resumed where we left off. Every step was a new balancing challenge. Each step was an invisible hope that would yield a sturdy place to step on and not lean your weight sharply to the left, right or slip backwards. Each foot placement was heavy with powdered, sticky snow. After falling forward, left and right 1000's of times, a sign was reached with some brief history. The chilly whip cracked as the stinging cold reminded us not to delay too long. After 2 more unbearable miles of up and steep downs, the roadway was reached that would lead us to Gatlinburg.","Day 20 Mount Collins Shelter

So this part is about my Frogg Toggs Jacket. It is perfect to shed the water ONLY if it is light rain. If it is anything heavier for an extended time, it will diffuse through the material. I have worn it 3 times in heavy to light rain and it has done this to me twice now. 
We ate chicken fried steak, gravy, eggs, pancakes, biscuit, hash browns and sweet tea for breakfast at the local restaurant. It was an amazing comfort. We need to conserve food to ensure it can survive the last 32 miles of the Smokies. We missed another frigid night in the mountains staying in Gatlinburg which is a very well carved tourist attraction while waiting for the free shuttle service offered by the NOC (outdoor center) to take us back to the trail at 1130am.
After re-engaging the trail, it was warm and inviting. Jackets were removed and the hike began with just short sleeve shirts on even though the trail was meshed with packed snow, slush, muck, mud, rocks and puddles of long standing water. After 30 minutes of hiking, the trail of endless sploosh, squish, clomp, clomp, splash, squish the trail wound along the ridge line. After a few minutes the views were breath taking. The entire mountain range with no trees blocked the view. Moving through the stimulating landscapes, Charlie's Bunion was not far off. Swarms of people littered every crevice and crack that could be sat upon. The landscape could be seen for 100s of clear blue sky miles not being hidden by slow passing clouds. As the day lagged on, multitudes of day hikers were passed as friendly greetings were exchanged. Every following step was a struggle with a sliding downward step in the fresh slush. The beauty of nature was admired evey 15 minutes. The crystal clear magnitude of the distance was taken in. A sign could be seen ahead. The sign read, shelter this way .4 mile. As the shelter presented itself in the near distance, it was full of other hikers with limited tent space to use for the night. For the past 22 days, every shelter has been this way, over crammed with thru hiker and day hikers. Life goes on and hopefully this coincidence will thin out as time progresses.","Day 22

He took a group photo and hiked the 7 miles left for the day. We were off and my hiking mate got a few bends ahead of me. Trying to catch up was a slippery, unbalanced nightmare. Navigating a path that sloped 45 degrees towards the 2 mile straight down forest below was unbelievably scary. Each step slipped one way and then the other. Poles were used to counter to the shift in speed. All of a sudden, my left foot (not wearing Yak Traks) slipped to the front shifting the backpack weight teetering unbalanced towards the sheer cliff dropoff. Stabbing the trekking poles in, balance was regained.The icy path caused another slip and almost sent me over the cliff again. Perseverance won here as the poles helped to regain lifesaving balanced. Hiking on, several groups of day hikers wanted our trail names and stories. Names and info was provided and then waved goodbye.Continuing to Cosby Shelter a few miles away was in sight. Only seeing about 10-15 people there it was a relief.

What was this stuff? Moving on, it was decided that the froth wasn't something happened normally, but happens when sweat freezes on dark clothes.After about 90 minutes, a vast opening showed itself. The monumental color changes of lush greens, light browns, purples and deep blues that only nature could imagine were presented. Taking a deep breath and inhaling the super crisp, clean air filled our hearts and souls with a sense of calm that has never been experienced before. After eating a moon pie, energy flowed into every muscle and energized the next 60 mins of effort flawlessly.Max Patch Summit stairway ascent appeared in the distance.30 upward spiral stairs with a gap of 10-20 feet between each stair to the top could be seen.Climbing to the arduous top was a daunting task.Finally at the top, no trees blocked the 360 degree panoramic landscape seemingly drawn by a skilled painter. The ultra deep greens blended with the light browns of the trees and the crisp leaves on the ground gave way to dark forest green grass that swept over the ridge like a wildfire. Off in the distance, a few winding paths of light to dark browns traced the side of the hill. This natural beauty was inspiring. Sitting down taking in all of this was heavenly.The clouds overtook the sun every few mins. A dream of a ranchouse smoked bacon fettucini alfredo noodles with tuna and olive oil for dinner with dehydrated milk and butter was being imagined The suns rays warmed the lands and senses each time it peeked from behind the clouds.The dark clouds began to bolster in strength andwas a reminder to find camp for the night.After making the noodles for dinner, thoughts drifted to family, as only this wonderous landscape could be fully appreciated with them.A feeling washed over all the senses like a small wave of enjoyment and pleasure small.

If you are scared to go to sleep in the woods because you think there will be a bear or scary beast growling around your tent all night, whatever!!! 27 days in and the only thing I have heard at all is a mouse wrestling with a piece of a wrapper that missed going into the gallon ziplock bag that goes in with hung food bag at night.  You do not need to sleep with your clothes or items that you wear as travel gear!!! 5-15 mins in the bottom of your sleeping bag is plenty to warm them as you break down camp. Wet items, um no, but you get the idea. The only items you should be cautious about are if your filter is the sawyer kind, the filter, your phone and camera should go in your sleeping bag, but only if night temps hit freezing. 
Today, expecting a huge Easter celebration the town was silent. Examining the outsiden, nothing of what the rumors whispered were of eggs, bacon, biscuits and gravy with hashbrowns were visible. Scuttling to the nearest and only restaurant in town hikers 3 mile and Little D were ran into. After chatting with them for a while we sat down at the overly busy restaurant and walked right out the other side fearing we wouldn't have enough time to check out of the hotel before 11 am. Having checked out of the hotel, gear was grabbed and headed over to the laundromat to finish some much needed clothes cleaning.An amazingly friendly staffed place called ""Artisun Gallery"" ran by Brian and Susan who have a son currently serving in the army guard was located. Hours of conversation seemed to pass by.Being offered a mocha latte was not rejected. The 20 oz latte drained slowly as it cooled off. A big delicious brownie offer soon followed which was quickly devoured as I began telling tale sof the AT. This is a very well established juice, coffee and breakfast quick bar that invites you in. They are located on the north end of town on the right side just before the railroad tracks. This is ""A Must Visit"" place before leaving Hot Springs. After leaving a short while later, gear and laundry were gathered and then headed up in some unbelievably hot humid weather with only a teasing cool wind every 30 mins. As the path wound op the hillanear Lovers Gap, Brandens hiking pole brushed something that coiled quickly to life!!! COPPERHEAD ALERT!!!There it was all 2 to 3 feet of him trying to hide as Branden went by and poised to strike while following suit.Putting my pole near the snakes head to distract it and warned others that there was snakes present on the trail as they were on their way down. Reaching the nearest resting point, snacking for 15 mins, continuing up the steep mountain and down until a single bridge crossing was seen.Branden waves his poles furiously and the cars below frantically honked in return. Laughing and continuing on a 3600 ft incline until a suitable camping spot that called our names could be found. After doing normal chores of setting tents up, organizing them for the night, eating, cooking and doing dishes, hanging the food bags was next.Branden was having a heck of a time tossing the rope over the desired limb. Laughing could be heard in the distance.Looking in his direction, saying ""which limb?""pointing to one nearby, the attempts continued. Cursing was all that was managaed from his direction. 4 tries later the food bags were 12 feet in the air with a trekking pole attached because it wouldn't let go but was good for tomorrow hahaha.

Most were ""water this way"", off in the distant creepy tree tunnel covered way inviting you in to never return and others were pointing to beautiful vistas, or points of view. Shortly after returning to the trail a sign came up stating ""the way up."" This trail was made out of crudely carved stone steps that were shorn into the earth and very sturdy. Each stone step wound around and round until it rose or fell at least 2 to 3 feet each time you stepped up, across or down. Sometimes the random step would shudder under your weight and you'd be balancing on that stone as if tipping on a scale. The stones were overgrown with bright and dark green moss that accented them in such a way it reminded us of a tomb raider cliff. Wandering further up the precarious stones, a 360 view that could see for 100s of miles was in sight. This was next to a monument to the engineer that built the path or structure. After taking note, a normal path that opened into a lush green grassy meadow, lined with red plants not yet sprouted and trees that had given their leaves to the ground as the season changed showed the way. Following this single, plush and very soft grass lined trail as it seemed to go on forever with no overhead cover was quite the task. Finally, a seated rest area on a fallen log showed up. Enjoying a quick snack, a few miles were left for the day. With this enamored focused renewal in mind, trotting quickly towards the shelter was the whip that kept focus in check. It was a sullen flat for miles and thought ""where is the trail going to descend or ascend sharply to make us atone for this miles long flat sin?"" The question was soon answered. Descending one mile then met with a huge mile long 60 degree ascent that was quickly covered and crested the ridge to find the elusive shelter nestled amongst the trees. 3 more hikers joined for the night.","Day 28 Little Laurel Shelter

Bidding each person a morning of good tidings for their trail journey including a German dad and son who were just doing a day section of the path.They ended up staying the night at the shelter. After heading down the trail, filling up the water bladders from a super chilly mountain stream running out of a pvc pipe placed there to aid in filling was the current objective. After a few minutes the water was topped off. Cresting a ridge, a fellow thru hiker was spotted named Eggman who was from New York.Reading the guide book, it was figured out that 2.5 miles west of us was a nearby grocery store. It was decided if 2.7 miles equaled a walking hour then it should take 45 mins no problem. Reaching the bottom, a left or right choice presented itself to us. Direction of right was the choice. After one to two turns, Branden dropped his pack and went up the way finding nothing of worth after 20 mins. He returned and went back to the only other remaining direction only to find the remnants of the store that closed the December of last year. Ughhhh. Walking the steep hill ascent to get back to where we left the highway was the new plan. After a few no go for hitching, a couple of German ladies who have never in their lives picked up people, stopped. The destination from the night prior was explained to the 2 ladies about a mile and half away. After chatting with the ladies, one of them was married to ""Olaf"" (thru hiker at prior night shelter) with his son Timon. We all laughed at the coincidence and told them what happened with the store. Arriving at the highway destination at the highway gap, the ladies greeted Olaf (husband) and Timon (son) as they came down. The family had a conversation in German and the ladies proceeded to give us the rest of the father and sons food as they were done hiking.Trying to refuse, but graciously accepting a few memories pictures were taken with them. Before they left, they told us there was foul weather coming. If a place was needed to stay, contact info was handed over they and went on their way. Continuing on, crossing a brazen field of wheat colored grass and then began the ultra ascent up the mountain. Cresting the top, a break and a few pictures were taken of the natural small waterfall. Moving on after a couple of pop tarts and kind bars, a man showed up who had thru hiked the AT already and asked if sodas were wanted. Oh my god yes!!! He handed over a coke and ginger ale and they were downed in almost a single gulp. His trail name was ""Wailin"". With thanks exchanged, focusing on the good luck today, the trail called once again. Hog Back Ridge was next on the travel list. Getting some water from a non moving source, yuck, it was a muddy water hole, did the luck just change? Reading the guide book, it was noted 8.6 miles in four hours today was all that was travelled. What happened??? Eager to fix the situation gorging heavily on the food and continuing on the trail that followed a wood fence with heavily rusted barbed wire, 4 sections tall was followed. Reaching the highway, crossing underneath a perfect camp site for the day was found. A random dog appeared, sniffed around and seeing what was going on and then the owner came down the hill and talked. He asked our names and his trail name was Pappion. He walked off and then came back and offered to take our trash from us as he was parked a few minutes at the base of the hill. Accepting graciously, and saying goodbye was hard. Eating bagels with cheese and pepperoni slices on them, it was deemed trail pizza. After finishing setting up camp, the food bags were hung. Branden already had the food cord strung around a limb that was 1 1/2 inches thick. Hooking the bags up, he said pull!!!WHAM!!! Down came the branch right on top of him grazing him slightly. After 10 minutes of laughter, it was decided he was good to go.

The winds started around 9pm last night and kept almost bending the tent in half the whole night which sounded like a jet plane firing up. After getting up, eating and thinking about stuff to do the winds whipped the trees behind us as if they weighed nothing. After trying to break down the tent in assumed 20-30 mph wind gusts, the tent was down to the under tarp, main liner and the rain fly. Trying several things, each attempt ended in a parachute of each piece trying to be folded. After figuring out if 2 stakes were left in the ground another invisible helper was made. Hastily putting the tent away, camp was broke down and then proceeded up the daunting mountain. After an hour and a half of pure hell going 60 degrees up with no end in sight, the top was finally reached. Feeling massive exhaustion, like a sludge sledge was used, an electrotab (salt pill) was eaten. After eating some more snacks the energy levels began to slightly recover. We crested the grassy hill, heavily covered with fog. Cresting Bald Mountain, the winds blasted mercilessly. The first blast stripped off a pack cover. Branden was holding the pack steady as getting out of the rain jacket was key. Getting assailed nonstop with assumed 50 to 60 mph gusts was just the start. The winds moved us, packs and poles as if weightless. One blast of wind smashed Branden into me. Steadying one another, moving forward in a left to right zombie stride was all the winds would allow. Two hills later, overcoming dense fog and heavy winds was the next challenge. The day seemed to stretch forever. Taking an Aleve, more food and water, the weather began to set in with some new steam. After reaching the Black Hills Rocks, covering around 10.4 miles, a decision was made to go at least 14 miles total to make an easy walk for the next morning. Needing another break, a log was located to sit on. That felt sooooo good. Boots came off and feet were elevated. A sign stating the next shelter was 4.7 miles further was seen. It began to rain lightly, donning pack covers and rain gear was a chore.Climbing seemed only to infuriate the the more rain in the Jurassic Park surroundings. After 12 inside and outside side trails on the mountains edge, the water sign that meant the building was close appeared. 7 other people were trailing nearby. In this world, its first come first serve for the bed spaces in the dry shelter or set up a tent in the rain.

Today was an extremely tough day to get moving. Arriving 3 days ago, hiking Friday for a nero day and 2 rest days of complete relaxation was tough to return from. Monday came swiftly. A shuttle appeared from the hostel. Promptly at 845 am the shuttle ($2 each) showed in front of the Super 8. The driver said not to mind the 75 pound dog sleeping in the middle of the first row of seats snoring. As the driver opened the door, the dog awoke, noticed us and began to wag his tail. His fur was black with streaks of grey and light brown blended together. One ear was standing tall as the other ears top half lazily covered itself. One eye was misted over, while the other was a light black/blue. Branden sat in the seat with the dog petting him and shortly, the dog was snoring with his head in his lap for the 15 minute trip to the hostel. Grabbing fuel, bite water valve (yes mouse ate mine for second time) was next to take care of. After a few hours of hiking, 3 day hikers from Columbia showed up. They were out for 10 days, on a week excursion knocking off the dust from their equipment. Wishing them well and heading up the trail happened ever so slowly. After 10 minutes, the trail would change from a level, gently, leaf covered entourage, to a 45 degree washed out, 1 foot tall, gnarled tree root mesh with various rocks poking out at different angles. Eventually this gave way to a standard maintained trail that was spongy and pleasant to walk on for a few miles. Coming to a road, trail magic!!! Running down the way to be greeted by Brother Tom from the local church was amazing. Wet wipes were given, got to sit on some actual seats and asked if tea, coffee, water or lemonade sounded best? Fudge infused soft brownies or berry bread? was the next question. Drinking the tea with brownie and a lemonade with another brownie, the day was almost the best ever. Chatting with brother Tom for 30 minutes and chatting with the other 4 thru hikers who showed up, gave way to a wonderful conversation. After 4 more hikers came down the hill, thanks were exchanged to the host and proceeded up the 45 degree ascent that did not stop for 40 minutes. After breathing hard, enjoying the cooling breeze more plans needed to be made. Checking the book, 4 miles were left. Noticing the sky was gathering wind and clouds quickly, it was decided to move quickly. An hour later the final ascent of the day was in sight. It was a 2500 foot straight up challenge with 15 switchbacks. We noticed the water, shook it off as not needed and reached the top near exhausted. Camp was found, chores were being finished and settling in for the night was priority. Looking at the water reserves, a quarter liter each wasn't a whole lot of water for the night. Looking at the book, 3 miles farther was the next water point.","Day 34 Erwin TN (Rest Day 2)

Putting a hand outside the sleeping bag, oh my god it's freezing outside, it was realized it had to be snow.Taking down the tent was an unrealistically challenging task. First, pulling the pack close and placing hands back in sleeping bag to warm up. Next grabbing one item then putting hands back in the bag. This was a repeat cycle for 20 more times before the tent was down. The wind was whizzing by like the sound of a jet flying very low across the sky and kicking in its afterburner. A shelter was agreed on. It was tough to decide whether to have a jacket on while hiking, wear it you'd sweat buckets or freeze if you had no jacket. Arriving at the first shelter about 3.3 miles away, 3 day hikers were met and two were training a third for a trail in New England. Chatting for a bit, the guy asked ""skittles or licorice?"" skittles were decided on, thinking how tough it would be to chew frozen licorice. The icy wind enveloped us the entire day. It was 70 degrees the prior day. This extreme cold weather setting in was confusing. After hiking to a campsite, 2 miles were left and along came Dusty. He was a thru hiker who is on the trail, but going off trail to spend some family time, then return. Setting up camp, then putting the tents up, when CRACK sounded from behind and relief set in as it was realized the weather turned nasty very quickly. Looking up, and seeing the main tent pole to Branden's tent snapped in two. Fortunately, he had a splint after cutting the rope, applied the splint and tied the rope on again. Hopefully the night time will bring some warmth and not a bitter embrace.","Day 35 Unaka Mountain

Sounds of new voices that were not present when we went to bed could be heard in the early AM. Testing the air from outside the sleeping bag, it was bitter cold. Argh!!! Not a 3rd day of this ultra frosty wind. Hiking to Hughes Gap, a few miles down the trail, mother nature started letting me know with a tummy growl business needed to be taken care of immediaty.Being in the middle of a highway, there was no where to go except to hold it and climb Roan Mountain. This was a severe ascent up. After 6 more ridge tops and 50 switchbacks later, the topmust be nalear. Branden said ""Oh there is a bathroom in less than a mile just up there"" pointing further up the trail. My belly disagreed and said I would catch up. After finding a nice forked tree to conduct business, mother nature was taken care of.Branden mentioned to meet up at Carvers Gap. Ascending the stone stairs, ice and 35 switchbacks, the top was nowhere to be found.After huffing and taking random breaks, the top of the grass patch was miraculously reached.This couldn't be the top. I assumed the meeting place was at the top and followed the sign to Carvers Gap. Hobbling down the awkward stairs, travel continues for 45 minutes. Moving on, a chimney in the middle of the trail could be seen. After cresting Roan Mountain, a family sitting near the path with a blue blaze was sighted. They asked about nearby vista's locations. After moving down the 20 switchbacks, rock laden path, Carvers Gap with Branden waiting at some trail magic by Betty and Sailor finally revealed itself.Drinks were enjoyed, hosts were thanked, took some pictures on Carvers Gap and headed to the barn shelter for the night.","Day 36 Clyde Smith Shelter

The winds blew through the slots between the wood, since the wood wasn't butted together.The powerful winds would sway the entire barn with each mighty gale. The howling winds came and went with fury and subtlety every 15 minutes for the length of the night. As it slowed, the pat pat pit pit pat of the rains began pelting the steel roof for 2 hours and subsided like the ebbing of a furious tide. 10 people stirred and with each step of every person, the whole barn swayed back and forth.Cleanung up the makeshift camps, the ascent up the dark beautiful green grassy hills bending from the blowing of the strong gusts of wind commenced. Climbing to the top was inspiring. The vista was a complete panorama for 100 miles or more in every direction. The sun bathed the valleys in its warm light. To the right, a farm could be seen with a red barn, a tractor still in the green field and a dog running about playfully chasing a young boy. A town could be seen to the left with lush green grasses and freshly painted buildings of red, blue, brown and white hues. Descending over the top, we returned to the unkempt, muddy, tree roots woven into the rocky path. The views stayed hidden barred by many trees as we descended. After a few hours stepping onto an outcrop of a large boulder was on the to do list. You could see 180 degrees in front of you. The clouds disguised the valley's beauty in its foreboding haze. We moved on until we found the trail was completely destroyed. Was this from the torrential winds the prior night? It might have been. Three massive sturdy trees were ripped down in their prime, toppled as if they had no weight at all. (pictures included in photos) carefully navigating around mothers natures brute display of force, descendeing until a graveyard came into view. Sights were quickly focused on the gravestone that had a 3 foot tall statue of Jesus with his arms open welcoming all into his warm embrace. The writing wasn't legible from our side and moved on until a white church came into view, pristine in its setting, cozied up to a grassy green nook surrounded with a little white fence.The trail was marked with 4 large red marks on a tree. Murder? Here? No! This was a land ownership point haha. Laughing followed and moved into our forest covered, clearing with the area covered in soft pine needles to find camp.The skies rained, snowed and hailed almost instantly.

Dropping the packs, at least 100 or more feet high surging over 5 layers of blackened rocks, Jones Waterfall revealed itself proudly. Standing in awe of its power and crystal clear waters sending 15 degree water gushing over the falls pictures were taken. After descending into the ravine of plush green trees, it opened up coming out next to a raging river. It was after fisherman's paradise writhing with fish and full of life under the aquiescent watery entourage. Analyzing the water for a few miles, thoughts were of where to cross. A foot long mucky crossing came into view. Moving uphill, a tree was found to sit on and have a snack. A thru hiker named DSquared breezed by telling snow was due in the area by tomorrow night.Trail names were exchanged and where people were from. Moving along the trail coming across some inviting soft, green grassy campsites that taunted us to stop and stay the night, as a siren lures it's prey in, resisting is all that could be mustered. Moving quickly down the trail, a very unusual sight was to be held. It was a park bench in the middle of the AT. Sitting on this luxury item watching the first hints of snow slowly drift down the from the sky, one flake at a time was a wonderous time consumer. After a few hours, a river crossing called the Cascades was in reach. It was a rushing river laden with large stepping stones covered in green moss. Playfully hopping over the slick stones in the river, it was crossed.After another 2 and half hours, home for the night was un sight.It had 3 crossed logs to sit on, a fire pit in the middle and a few pristine camping places for the night as the light snow and darkness set in.","Day 38 Campbell Hollow Road

It started with a pat pat pat, then moved to a jet turbine firing up, then pit pit pit pat pat splat splat in rapid succession. Judging the rate of fall, 6 inches was expected by morning. The snow fury came and went every other hour. Awakening at 7 am, there was less than 1 inch on the ground. Everything was coated in an icy chunky mess. Once camp was broken down, the rain fly had to be put in the outer flexible pocket due to it being cased with hard ice and snow. Slowly heading up the semi slick trail, the vortex whirlwind followed for the entire day. Stopping at a peak for 5 minutes to snack was way too long as the icy winds whizzed overhead and ripped through clothes. Moving down the trail after a few hours, a lopsided abandoned shelter waa found. Only the roof and siding lasted time's test. Hobbling down to the non snow covered elevation of 2400 feet, a highway could be barely noticed.There was a campground full of tents next to the quick flowing river. After deciding what to do after a 30 minute break, the Kincora Hostel was the days destination. This guy is amazing. He has a full hostel that asks only for donations in return. He runs a free shuttle to both towns west and east. His walls and floors are covered by finished success stories of Mt. Katahdin sorted by year. The warmth could be felt from the wood stove that was keeping the winds at bay. It was decided to take the old AT trail past the spectacular waterfalls down a few hundred carefully crafted stone steps. Following this portion of the trail was amazing because it was flat, maintained and free of tripping hazards. It went on like this straight to Hampton, except for one mega ascent halfway. This was so peaceful and serene because of all the unmaintained trails and headinf into town.This town was mainly a one main street design. Walking into the grocery store, food and goods were bought and headed for the castle hostel that was built in the 1900s. Walking almost a mile down the main drag, a new pizza place could be seen that recently opened and was a must to try. As we past, the sign said ""will return in 20 minutes"", moving on to mow down a foot long Meatball sub, chips and drink from Subway, followed by 2 double cheeseburgers from Mcdonalds. Heading back to the hotel to wait out the frigid 15 to 20 degree temps with 40 MPH gusts night was a welcome diversion.

For the first 2 miles the edge of the lake was followed with calm waves lapping gently at the shore. Reaching the dam was a feat. It was a marvel of 100 feet tall or more with large boulders and mud composed on one side at a 45 degree sloping angle, while the other was a robust dirt enbankment keeping the waters in check. On top there was a paved road that allowed crossing with seismic signs lining the sides.Crossing the paved surface, a road that led steadily up about a 30 degree angle for a quarter mile until it joined the path again was seen. Climbing near 70 degrees up for 20 minutes, the ridge was crested. Off in the distance, the entire lake could be seen with a large boat marina that had 30 boats sitting docked quietly in the calm waters. Moving along the ridge line, tiny colorful towns scattered the valleys. Patches of green with houses and barns could be seen at every angle. It was a vivid panoramic view to behold. At this point when you are within 20 miles of a town, you can usually see it from the ridge lines. The homesteads, farms and suburban settlements followed along with us adjusting the view angle as we crept on. After a few hours the shelter finally came into sight Branden mentioned to check the water. Checking, dismayed, a quarter liter of water is what was remaining. Taking the water filter system up the hill and down the ultra steep trail 60 to 70 degrees down for a third of a mile water was located. After filling up from a half inch pvc pipe placed there to aid filling, the arduous return climb back up commenced. After stopping several times to regain breath, reaching the top, heading back down to the shelter where Branden was reading a book relaxing for the last half hour, asked ""can we stay?"" Thinking on it, he said ""was it really that hard to get the water, 70 degrees uphill, wah?"" Smiling, stating, ""get your stuff and let's go."" After 2 more hours, the campsite that had water nearby showed up. Water was checked to verify it was flowing and settled in for the night as 2 others joined us at camp. The older gentleman eluded our stories, but did get to meet his hiking partner ""Dusty"" a few times before.

It was too far in the distance to make out what was being discussed.After awakening for the second time, travelling 75 feet downhill and filtering 3 liters of water was next for the chores. Morning breakfast was going to be delicious with 4 packs of hot oatmeal, coffee and a fudge round. Cooking is a blessing, but also requires drinking water to wash clean too.After eating a hearty, hot satisfying meal with very hot coffee to wash it down, loading up a propel fitness water mixer in a 20 oz bottle, shook it up and gulped down the fizzy delectable grape flavored drink. The trail was unbelievably combed, soft and very subtle rolling ups and downs. After one hour, the first shelter was to our surprise 3.3 miles away. Normal pace was usually 2 miles per hour taking a hearty break, removing boots and socks, elevating feet felt like a sin, but a well deserved one. Moving down the trail, a young girl hiker was passed. Chopper and Mountain Goat who were all flip flopping a 1000 mile section the direction we just came from. Chatting for a while, they told us of some trail magic 3 to 4 miles away in our direction. We hiked for about an hour and came upon a large monument known as the Nick Grindstaff. There wasn't much on the tombstone, but at the age of 92, it is assumed he loved to be out on the trail. After paying some respect, travelling on until the magical stainless steel box that was black and orange, chained to a large tree was found. Thank you so much to the Nelson Baptist Church for stocking this item each day so that hikers could be taken care of this way. Taking 1 soda and a food bar while signing the book was slowly accomplished. As a few other hikers emerged, pointing towards the box explaining it was safe and moved on. A gate that led into a lush green meadow filled with daisies and a perfectly flat rolling path to walk on came into view. As the meadow revealed itself, the tantalizing scents of daisies filled the air as the breeze lightly enveloped around the area. After 1 mile of pure bliss, climbing the makeshift ladder over the fence and went back to the padded trail we proceeded. An older couple that was walking on the path heading towards uscould barely be seen. As the woman was passing, Branden said ""Hello"" and the lady said ""I'd say hi, but dunno what time of day it is."" As the man passed by, it was stated ""How's it going today?"" The old man really slowly turned to me as I noticed he was carrying a double bladed axe in tow, said to me ""Mooooving Onnnnnnnnnn."" He creepily smiled and the pace moved on much more quickly. Describing this couple would be to describe the painting of the old man and woman in front of a barn with one brandishing a pitchfork. Shortly after proceeding near the highway, Branden put on his mosquito headnet and hurried my direction as the skeeters were fast in pursuit. Swatting wildly only seemed to get them more in a frenzy. Waiting for the first large wind was all that could be done and moved uphill as fast as possible losing the hungry pack. After traversing up 6 ridges and down 10 more, our clean, raked and very near campsite appeared. After so many miles, it was amazing to finally see this at the 16th mile of the day. After setting up camp, we realized that 20 people passed by today and better get reservations in town before they were gone.Moving up and down the trail with the phone to find signal, one was finally located. After a 10 minute conversation, a private room at the hostel with a bathroom and shower, kitchen and beds all to ourselves for 2 whole days was secured.

Waking again at 445 am, the medium power rain relentlessly pounded on the fly. Pulling the sleeping bag back, a small hope was thought of so it would stop soon. At 645 am, it was time to get up as the light crept into the tent illuminating all the drops and splatter patterns across the tent and vestibules. There was no getting away from the misery of the rain. Donning the rain jacket, hopping outside, lowering the food bags from the tree and putting Branden's bag next to his tent a shout was sent his way to see if he stirred. (Angry dragon language) replied ""YES!!!"" Are you breaking down your tent soon? ""NOOOO!!!"" OK, once the tent is broken down, Damascus will be nearby. ""FINE WHATEVER"" After folding up the sopping wet tent and putting it in its bag, camp was broken down. Saying goodbye and town was the meeting point. It was a windy, ultra foggy day. Only 20 feet in the distance could be seen. After 30 minutes, a raggedy shelter could be seen in the distance. This made no sense. The shelter was 2.9 miles away and was reached in 30 minutes? Sitting inside eating breakfast, consulting the guide book, it foretold of less than 10 miles left to Virginia. Drenched from head to toe and bitter cold from the sweat that had a chance to freeze during the short break, the journey continued. The winds were relentless as the rains picked up and settled every 45 minutes traveled. In the distance, a sign could be seen. This could only mean the state line had been reached. Upon approaching the sign, it was scrawled with pertinent distance information for shelters north or south and the all important one said the state line. Wooooooohhhhhhooooo!!!!!! This meant 9.7 miles had been hiked in 3 hours and 10 minutes. Misery is a solid motivational tool. Moving on towards the last 3 miles before town, a brief glimpse of the small paradise came into view. It was a vibrant deep green manicured picture of grasses, reds, blues, yellows and a large variety of bright colored roofs and sidings. This is the city that ""Trail Days"" happens in. ""Wow, this place is so cool looking, but yet so simple"" Moving down the trail, the rains made the path ultra slick and every 5 to 10 steps resulted in a foot long sliding smear. When the path slanted 45 degrees towards the steep drop off, the slick muck grabbed your foot sliding only inches from the edge. Carefully positioning the trekking poles to counter the slippery goop, the fog started to lift and the clouds gave way to the strength and warmth of the sun. Switching back and forth on the trail15 more times to descend the mountain, the end of the path that drops you into the city was now in sight. Changing out rain gear for dry to travelling clothes was on the agenda. Walking a few blocks time was spent admiring the Freedom Wheel in the towns center and the bridge crossing the fast gushing river below. A few blocks away was the ""Hikers Inn"" and the luxurious camping accommodations that had everything a VIP hotel room had, but encased in a camper's sleek silver aerodynamic shell. This was going to be home for 2 nights, one of which was a 13.2 mile travel day and a rest day to replace destroyed socks that were blown through at the heels, bent tent stakes, bananas and a few other miscellaneous items to make the experience more pleasant. The sun was out with a light breeze.

Seeing a vehicle pulling in the alleyway near the camper and parking in a driveway was about the extent of it. 730 am came swiftly as a rooster crowed in the distance while some birds tweeted back and forth. 
It was time to get up. Debating whether to eat some hot oatmeal or go to Cowboys restaurant and get some hot biscuits with bacon egg and cheese, it was a hands down winner of Cowboys. Purchasing 2 of the fresh, moist, buttery biscuit bliss with 2 drinks, sitting down outside on the picnic table to devour the mornings delight. 
Waiting for Branden to finish packing his gear, breakfast soon disappeared, satiating the eternal hunger. He slowly trotted toward me with his pack on and chatted.
Let's shoot for the shelter that was 14.7 miles off. After walking through town and emerging on the north end that began our ascent. 
It started with subtle ups and downs with flat manicured paths to follow. After a few miles the path went on a massive PUD (Pointless Up and Down) (meaning, go up a 60 degree incline for about a half mile just to rejoin the path you could see to the left only a hundred feet away).
The sun was shining with 60s outside with little cloud cover and no crosswinds. Sweat poured as the ascent challenge went on. 20 trails switched back and forth. 
Reaching the top and chatting with a few hikers ate up some time. One was thru hiking the whole way, however she had a camper to stay in every night at key locations. Hmphh. 
Heading down the mountain top trails covered with boulders and large, sharp rocks of different shapes the journey went on. Stumbling over most of them as each one would catch the bottom of a boot and cause a mild tripping effect accompanied by a cussing murmur happened a lot. 
Trailing side by side to the river for a few miles, docks could be seen at deep points in the river that had signs which read ""Trout fishing here no less than 12 inches if keeping."" 
Crossing a bridge which rose about 200 feet above the river below was next. After crossing the bridge, the guide book said 4 miles remained to the shelter. 
After ascending and crossing many river embankments and seemingly unending ups that didn't want to stop looping around the mountain, joy couldn't be far off?
Looking at the guide book one last time, it was decided that around 25 minutes of travel was left. 45 minutes later, feet throbbing with every step, hands aching from the strength required to grasp the poles to hold our weight up between each stumble and trip, wondering, is it done yet? 
Finally, the shelter roof appeared around the last corner and a PRIVY!!!(outhouse, sometimes with no door or only 3 walls) Going VIP for this night. 
Setting up camp went quickly. Water was filtered for chicken flavored noodles, alfredo noodles, hot chocolate and fudge round (treat) dinner to enjoy shortly. Hot meals melt away the miseries of the day. Savoring each sensation of the hot chocolate was heavenly and sent a welcome joyful bliss all over.

After 45 minutes the trail was seemingly smooth enough. After a short 20 minutes more, the trail turned to large boulders, 2 to 3 feet tall tree roots meshed into the path and loose rocks of every kind. Each drop down caused a twist of the ankle in an awkward stumble and every step across some boulders caused the large rock to shift unexpectedly. After sliding painfully down about 6 unexpected shifts, the trail was leading towards a highway. This was a nice change because there was a bathroom located next to it and a sign that read ""Elk Gap"". Dropping the packs, leaning against them, boots came off and a 45 minute sleep followed in the 65 degree heat with a mild breeze.After waking, (every time a break occurs, feet throb and hurt for a few minutes until they warm up) following the grassy path with a 12 to 18 inch left to right brown path in the middle that hikers use, onward must happen. A sign was noticed indicating a horse path was to the right along the water. 2.2 miles was left to find the shelter. The dreaded gnarly tree roots made up of large boulders and rocks formed the path once again. Some steps reached about 3 feet high to step up to the next platform.

There was no place to plant the trekking poles for balance. This was a one shot to get it right the first time. A new path went through a cave while the other met it on the exit side. 
The cave was chosen and plopped us out at the other end. Some wild horses could be seen in the distance. 
There was one that was very close to the path that seemed mostly focused on munching the tall grass in the meadow. 
Approaching, a lady hiker was seen with a huge smile petting the balf size horse as it flipped it's tail around happily. 
Another few hours of travel went by and noticed these horses were everywhere and in every color combination. 
Following the path down, a corraled area with lots of grass was noticed and a restroom too.
This is a good place for a break. A family who drove 6 miles to camp in a nearby spot was met and they were headed home on this night. 
Beers were offered and readily accepted with pleasure. The 70 degree sun loomed with the clouds lazily floating by. Subtle winds relieved the stress of the hot day. 
A few hours passed by and a shelter came into view that a boyscout pack was busy taking over and the nearby camp areas. 
Chatting with the scout leader passed a bit more time. The path was not marked good at all, or maybe it was the heat and being super tired.

After crossing the road, a bridge that piggybacked for 100 feet or more had to be crossed. The impressive up and down dimensions were exemplary of the skills needed to make this marvel happen. After another 60 minutes, Atkins, VA was in aight and decided to stay the night due to needing phones charged, batteries and to file a internet claim for the busted pole.","Day 48 Partnership Shelter

A few gas stations followed the highway and went under the freeway. Climbing up over those erected wood ladders to safely climb over barb wire fences was a huge challenge. After a few hours the trail opened into a plentiful lush green meadow full of knee high grass and dandelions with a subtle hint of lavender in the air. Moving further down the path, a lady and her dog that were thru hiking starting at Atkins VA going to Katahdin could be seen.Sweat poured down everywhere as every step seemed like 1 forward and 2 back. Approaching a clearing with a very familiar sound of rushing water soon ensued. It was a river, only a few feet or less deep.Scouting for a perfect place to enter the sandbar was next. Removing shirts, socks and boots removed much unwanted heat. Carefully moving into the icy river soothed aching joints.Looking around, there was an old watermill falling apart near the river. Figuring this must have had a purpose around a hundred years back or so, refreshingly icy clothes were put back on. HIking a few more hours, Randy was met who was a local landowner out hiking the trail and offered alot of helpful info about water sources, shelters and upcoming details. After chatting for 10 minutes, Knot Maul shelter was on the agenda for the night. This was unusual because no people were there. This has not happened, not once, in the last 49 days. After eating some dry foods, not wanting to waste water cooking as the source was similar to a faucet turned on at its least flow, snuggling in to sleep for the night soon came to be.","Day 49 Atkins, VA

Checking the guide, it warned us 2 climbs were going to happen today. 1 was about 20 minutes and was 45 degree steep. The second one was a 45 minute climb at 70 degree inclines with 3 feet tall stairs and extremely narrow corridors.
After hiking 30 minutes, the first ascent stood methodically tall. 
Sweat poured from every possible place on our bodies as the top was reached. 1 down, 1 to go.
There was actually a gentle downhill and easy going for 2 hours. Were we going to be punished later for this? 
We were going to find out very soon. After finishing the newly presented warm up hill, the monster climb appeared in the distance. It was 3 fold taller than the previous mountain. 
Begrudgingly, the 90 minute ascent started. The heat of the sun boosted easily 80 degrees out with no cooling wind to help ease the heat.
Every step came with a sweat infused slosh in the boots and blinding our sight as it gushed over the face. 
Coming to a set of stairs that seemed to be put there as a taunt, filled the thoughts. There were 25 steps, 3 feet tall per step and 70 degrees up. 
After 20 of these it finally came to the area where it went to the mountain top. A green meadow with a path carved in the dirt in the middle of it could be seen. 
A pond, fed by a flowing spring, refilled the water packs and relaxed here for an hour. 
After the time passed, the 9.4 mile mark of the mountain top shelter came to be. The next 7 miles were like walking on horse trails made of large boulders, sharp rocks and slippery gnarled tree roots and very loose rocks. 
After stumbling every 10 steps or so weaving in a snake like pattern following the trail, a road came into view. 
15.5 miles hiked, out of water and a camp site present was a good choice to stop for. Or was it?
Moving 1 mile further, it was a steep half mile down. Reading a shelter sign stating it was 4.5 miles away. Ugh that would be a 20 mile day.
Without much other choice because water was scarce, the journey continues. 
The trail yielded no such combination. After 3.5 miles, water was found rushing over a small waterfall. 
Stuffing the water bladders full, while inhaling the fill of water, happiness set in. 
Gladly setting up camp eating ramen noodles x 2 with Tuna fish tasted amazing as it was heated up. After finishing, the night cooled the camp off.","Day 50 Knot Maul Shelter

1) Always carry super glue (been used 17 times this far on shoes, inflatable pillow, pad, tent, etc. 2) Recommended to buy new shoes every 500 miles (unless you use super glue, like I did, for treads when they peel off in front and get 1300 miles off one pair. 3) Send home non essentials as many times as necessary. (Cold weather gear when it's hot for a few weeks, stuff you move to get to other stuff but don't use in 10 days straight. 4) Using your gas on low prolongs life of use. 2 cans @ 8oz each and lasted me 60 days. (Hot meals and dinners made once every 1 to 3 days due to water scarcity)
The day started with the stirring of everyone at the shelter as the sun bathed the valley in its warming embrace.
Crinkle crinkle, crunch, crunch, whooooooo, could be heard in the distance as tents were taken down and air utilizing devices were deflated. 
After 20 minutes, the top was reached and it was perfectly flat as far as could be seen. It wound lightly up and down following the sideline of the mountain. 
A pace of 3 mph was being achieved, and it was flat for 7.5 miles. It was a cool, breezy overcast day. It made the days hours spin by without much notice. 
A large source of water near the roadway could be heard and found a bridge with small rapids nearby. 
Some trash left by precious owners could be seen on a brand new picnic table. Leave No Trace, means pack it in and take it with when you leave. 
After a few hours, a dirt road that intersected with some local highways was seen. Following a highway on ramp to cross a bridge and go down an off ramp to rejoin the AT was puzzling.
2 older ladies came by. One hiked the section from this morning and said this is the only water for 13 miles. Thankimg them for the info the pouch was filled with water to max. 
The day ended with an 80 degree incline pathway. After 30 mins, it leveled out and read a sign that said shelter this way. Moving on for another half mile a suitable site to spend the night was found.","Day 51 Jenkins Shelter

There was no getting away. It set in for the day. After putting away a sopping tent, the misty and soaking trail travel day begun. Refuge was sought in a shelter that was 9.4 miles away. Filling the water bladders, natures full fury really let off its steam. After trying to wait out the rain for 45 minutes, it was obvious it was useless. Putting on pack covers and hiking another few hours was pure misery. Alot of horse type trail rocks that were spear sharp, jetted out in the only place where you could step. Wobbling back and forth, weaving in a snake like pattern, it was taking a huge toll on the joints. Slipping and sliding here and there lasted too long. After a few more hours, the descent started with Branden way far ahead. Thats when the horrible pop in the left ankle happened. It stung each time pressure was put on the left foot. The top of the foot flat that 90 degree joined the front together was on major fire. Oh the pain. After hobbling on it for a few more miles, a suspension bridge that weaved and swayed over the 100 foot wide raging river below was reached. The pain persisted intensely. No weight could be placed on it. A decision to take a ride to Pearisburg VA, which was 26 miles ahead was made. This is an injury that requires a few days off the trail. Sigh.

I keep a small bag of rice in a zip lock with for this reason. 
After some much needed rest and relaxation, the tendon is feeling pretty normal. Taking it easy on the trail tomorrow is a good test. It feels pretty good now, but couldn't hurt with one more rest day. I've been taking chondroitin and daily vitamin supplements every other day that seems to aid in healing. I have been mass indulging in the proteins too to help out.

The familiar roof topped information board and a 3 layered sign with directions on it was studied. Seemingly the trail disappeared yet again.Backtracking, the missed turn about 100 feet back was located. This path was a tight tunnel of foliage, bugs and sharp thorns that weaved for a quarter mile before coming out to a bridge and road. Getting lost for about 30 minutes happened, then the white blaze on the bridge was spotted.The bridge had a concrete guard with a tightly wound mesh of extra strength black painted steel fence. WFollowing this for 20 minutes until it lead down 30 stairs and under the highway emerging on the other side trailing the vast river commenced. The walkway was flowing, smooth and very manicured being so close to town. It was heavenly to waltz upon this dirt carpet until the dreaded campsite with the horribly steep up on the other side came into view. Climbing this mini monster, it followed a factories fence line. It smelled heavily of glue like walking into a 4th grade class that had Elmer's glue projects recently drying. Coming upon some water that seeped out from the mucky off colored pond located near the plant with a sign that read DO NOT DRINK WATER was read. Heeding this, moving upwards coming into a clearing with towering large steel electrical sturctures were always buzzing loudly.8.5 miles in, there was a camp with a water source 100 feet away. Once we set up camp, Branden said ""dad"" look outside of your tent. Off in the distance were 2 grazing white tail deer. One was a mother or watcher of the yearling that was in close proximity. Odd whooping, clapping and random noises were made to let them know of our presence.One looked up swinging it's head side to side, up and down trying to see what made the sounds. They stayed in camp for 60 minutes eating as dinner began to cook.","Day 55 (Final Rest Day 3)

Awakening at 7am started the day. The sun crept into the top of the tent. The painful injury miseries of the past filled thoughts. 
After an hour, horse trails could be seen. (sharpened, loose, large and annoying rocks everywhere you had to step). 
30 minutes slowly went by. The ups and steep ups along with the horse trail rocks were now in the pathway. 
After 20 minutes, the top of the mountain was crested and found a makeshift old building. Resting here for 15 minutes, enduring the mosquitos as long as possible, presented another obstacle. 
The sun was shining around 75 degrees hiding behind passing clouds and coming out again. Looking over the edge, a small town could be seen surrounded in deep coral green grass and foliage that had not been cut yet. 
Moving on, more horse trails presented themselves for 90 minutes until the familiar double white blaze (trail change of direction) sign was seen on a nearby tree. 
After 20 switchbacks moving down, the shelter was seen and spent 30 minutes relaxing with boots and socks off to dissipate the heat gathered during the hiking day.

The rain quickly accompanied the monstrous sounds. It pounded the tent relentlessly with a heavy downpour, bending it to and fro with its fury. 
After 2 hours, the sounds, flashing and rain stopped. At 4 am it began all over again with a stronger tenacity. 
Sounds of the storm resembled a perfect horror scene set in the dark woods, rain with lightning cracking off in the distance. 
Hoping this would not continue in the morning, sleep followed shortly. 
After 7 am rolled around, the tent was sopping wet and drooping from the intense washing it got only hours ago. 
Unclipping just the rain fly, it was hung on the captain's clothesline put there for hiker use.
Ate fruity trail mix, drank water and packed up.
Clipping the pack to the zipline carabiner to cross the river proceeded to be next on the to do list. Sitting in the swing, bodyweight was all that was needed to cross the river. 
As the zipline slowed, pulling the lower rope would finish the crossing. Following the river for 2 hours until it disappeared up into the ridge of the mountains was difficult. 
More of the boulders that looked like a recent landslide made up the trail. Hopping carefully across the flat, sharp and loose boulders covered with bright green moss was quite a challenge.
Branden was a few hundred feet ahead. Trying to keep up, hopping rhythmically until the right boot caught just right happened. Half the tread from the front to the back was just flapping in the wind. 
Thinking carefully, crazy glue came to mind. After cautiously traveling for another 30 minutes, a rest site was found and the glue was found and put to the test. 
Emptying the contents of the entire bottle in between the right boot and floppy tread ensued.
Holding it in various places for 3 minutes until the glue set was the hopes of it working. With some modest effort, it worked. These boots do have 1500 miles on them at this point. They only need to last another 60 miles until the outfitter can be reached in Dalesville. 
After moving on with freshly glued boots, the rain showers began lightly for 5 minutes, then off and then on again for 10 more.

During the night, the rains came and went softly, then loudly and off again. It was wonderful to be dry and not have to pack a sopping tent up in the morning. 
As the ladies woke up stomping around loudly and gathering their gear, thoughts of why sleeping in shelters isnt always good. 
Waking, then using the privy and returning was offered some grits as the ladies were going to be finished hiking in a few days. Accepting happily, these were slammed down in a couple heaping spoonfuls. 
The ladies gathered the rest of their stuff, said goodbye and we're on their way. 
After hiking 30 minutes, the smell of a nearby forest fire hung heavy in the air. In 15 minutes, the badly charred forest section was reached.
Left and right, a lost glass like reflection could be seen in the dark charred mess that use to be the forest foliage and leaves. 
After 5 minutes we came across a hiker named Shrink (yes he's a shrink). Talk about the upcoming 18.2 mile day and where the steep challenges were at filled the next minutes. 
Shortly after, the 1500 foot ascent began. The trail slanted 45 degrees, due to the recent rains. Moving slowly up to the daunting path, large boulders shaped like teeth sprung from the mud covered in leaves testing our perception.
Hopping up these carefully, the trail became more steep with 75 degree inclines. The sweat was galloning from all over as the heat of the day set in. 
Moving up and down, slanting left and dodging sharp rocks, the top was reached for a short break. 
A truck came slowly by and asked our direction we were headed. Pointing to the north, he said well 3 bears crossed 300 feet near here. 
After hiking up a jeep trail with large and small loose rocks, dull and sharp, with fallen trees buried in the dirt to solidify their meaning, a half mile at a 45 degree incline formed the path.
The trail wound down towards a vast green fenced opening. An enormous green meadow with knee high grass and a few dandelions could be seen along with 2 dark brown log homes with green roofs. 
Enchanted by the heavy scent of lavender in the air each time the breeze picked up, we travelled the lush meadow for an hour. 
Carefully stepping over a very large downed tree, misjudging the height poorly suddenly happened. A broken limb that was now sharp scraped off a 2 inch tall rake like pattern from the left shin. 
Finally getting back under the cover of the trees was wonderful, as the sun was boiling with its 90 degree heat. 
Another hour passed and a bridge crossing a river could be seen. 
Boots and socks came off, feet plunged into the icy water, shirts and hats washed to ward off the sweltering hot day. 
Kepper Oak was seen. This was a massive tree having 15 to 20 circumference circles for a trunk and just as massive limbs. 
As the day continued, the heat factor intensified.
Boulders so large, they had to have been 100 feet wide by 20-30 feet tall had to be crossed.
Hopping across these abstract creations to follow the trail which resulted in spectacular 180 degree views made this part of the trail fun.
After being mesmerized by the enthralling beauty of nature, another few hours until our descent to the shelter began. 
Moving along the trail, it turned into a mountaineers dream, hopping down 3 to 6 foot boulders while balancing onto the next. 
After hiking nearly 3 hours, the end had to be near. Peering over the side, the bottom couls not be seen. 
After 45 more minutes, voices could be heard in the distance. The shelter roof appeared and our 18.2 mile endeavor was over. Selecting a camp spot for the night and nursing sore and injured parts completed the day.","Day 58 War Spur Shelter

She was a northbound hiker who started 5 days after our start date. 
Hiking for 2 hours, a subtle climbing switchback awaited. Waiting at the top was a park bench which called out so. Dropping the packs, ate food and propped up feet on the backpacks for 30 minutes was bliss. 
The top of the ridge was all green grass except for the brown path worn away in the middle.
After strolling down the cushy walkway for an hour the dragons tooth approached. This was a massive jagged rock face that shot up a few hundred feet with lacerations carved by time and wind. 
We began the descent down the jagged rocky mountain face. 
This was a treacherously skillful descent unlike anything we had seen yet. 
Each step was only a slim ledge less than 6 inches wide down to an area a foot could barely step into. 
Each area consisted of 2 rebar ladder rungs and 10 steps varying from 3 to 8 foot drops. Slipping was not an option as the result was plummeting 100 feet down. 
After descending the first area, there were 25 more monkey bar challenges to conquer. After sliding around alot due to extremely worn boot treads, the normal trail showed up once again. 
15 or more passed as they were heading up to the location travelled shortly to spend the weekend or day. 
After 90 minutes, the road was sighted and headed to the gas station. Buying a 32 oz gatorade, 32 oz Dr Pepper, going back outside and downed both in 10 minutes. 
Going back inside, food was purchased for the 2 travel days to Dalesville. Hunger set in so a 3rd purchase of a double bacon cheeseburger was made. 
Each patty was a half pound. These face size, cheesy gooey messes with small fresh onions awaited to be devoured. 
After 10 to 12 bites, the monster was nowhere to be seen. 
It was so good, the cook was found and thanked. She really loved the appreciation.

They all stared. After disappearing into the forest, a sign appeared saying 8 miles to McAfees Knob. This was the quintessential picture to get because it appeared in the movie ""A Walk in the Wild"". After passing 75 people coming down from the top, the first shelter that won a girl scout project award was stopped at. This was a pristine building along with a privy which showed why it won an award. While ascending, we were asked if thru hiking. Nodding, 400 cal snack packs in zip lock bags were obtained. Continuing up for 5 miles, the top was in aight at last, but there was too much fog. Gahhhhhh!!!What rotten luck. Pictures were sadly taken anyways and moved on down the other side of the hidden mountain. This path was so soft, luxurious and hardly any rocks in the way for so many miles, it was hard to believe that the worst was to come. After descending the mountainous switchbacks and easy trails, a shelter was stopped at for a quick break. Only 8 miles left to the shelter we were staying at for the night. The trail subtly coasted up and down. After 3 hours, the shelter full of other hikers was reached. It's always nice to meet other friendly hikers.Branden wanted to stay because his feet and body were done for the day. Respectably, it was a 16 mile day at that point already.Asking 5 times to come with, he politely refused. After 2 hours, the ridge hopping with razor sharp rocks, ups and downs with 4 foot steps followed the mountain as it weaved through and around the trail. After 15 ridges, the iron giants appeared. These were buzzing transmission lines for electricity. After travelling under 2 of these loudly buzzing monstrous iron creations, the trail wound underneath. After 60 minutes, the path finally started to wind down a staircase made of wood. The hour of darkness was quickly approaching. Putting on a headlamp just in case as it was 730 pm. The trail was going down and not staying up on the ridges. After 20 minutes, the path dumped out at the bottom. Following this ultra wide path, it wove between meadows, dark tunnels and other forest natural creations. As the dark crept nearer, stride length and pace were doubled. Hearing traffic and a city bustling in the nearby distance, I turned on the headlamp.It wasn't dark enough to see so the light was turned back off. After 5 more minutes the path let out in the middle of Daleville, VA. The Super 8 was sighted and went to secure residence there for a few nights.

You'd turn hot water valve and get scalded from water spraying out the back of the valve). After going downstairs to enjoy raisin bran, milk, 2 yogurts, 3 small orange juices for breakfast, conversation with a guy named Steve began. 
He introduced himself and we talked about the trail. It turns out today was day 1 for him and he had lots of questions. How much weight should I have? What do I actually need? How much is too much? 
Finishing eating, salutations were and the trail called again. After hiking for 30 minutes through dense, freshly blooming forests of lush, deep greens, the path started to roll up and down. 
Wonder how long this will last? After hiking 90 more minutes, the first shelter came within view.
Noting the fact that these shelters were much more recently built and in far better shape than the last 3 states, admiration to the lack of vandalism and carvings were studied. 
10 minutes taking off boots and socks while propping up the feet were enjoyed. 60% to 80% humidity over the last 7 days due to large amounts of rain and sun was normal. 
Today was no different. It was 65 degrees out getting warmer by the hour. It rained like being immersed in a car wash the night before for 6 hours straight. 
Traversing a stile was next. (Cattle guard contraption that uses a V Large Shaped fence and a smaller V Shaped fence wedging a space that cows cannot turn through but people can) 
Navigating through the stile, a meadow appeared that went 45 degrees up. This was followed into the blazing hot sun that waited until just that moment, lucky us, to come out as it was hiding behind the clouds the entire time before that. 
The hill was summited and turned left following a semi steep enbankment going down towards a freshly built wooden bridge. 
Followed the trail 2 highways needed to be crossed. These were fairly busy. After hiking another 2 hours, the second shelter about 11 miles in showed up. 
There were 2 hikers there we recognized from the Super 8 hotel. Chatting with Birdman and his friend started. 
Birdman is thru hiking and his buddy is going along with him for 2 weeks to get the feel of things. He asked if the pains in his knees and other things would stop, his buddy laughed and said they definitely will in 2 weeks, because that's all the longer you are out here.

The water was rushing heavily due to recent rains and covered each rock with 2 to 3 inches of water. Carefully prodding the ground using the poles to steady with, the slow climb began.
Travelling onto the rocks, slipping a few times and repeated this for 2 more rivers that were of smaller size is what laid ahead. 
Reaching a rushing mountain stream, water was gathered because there was none for the next 10 miles. 
Topping off and getting some weather information from the ridge runner (worker for the USFS) the path wanted us once again. 
A place called black Horse Gap came into view.
Noticing it was a nicely developed plot with camping spots and large rocks to sit on, it seemed homely. 
Eating Tuna fish and crackers while waiting for the dinner noodles to heat up ensued. The sun retreated and came out frequently from the clouds. Not being sure if the dark cloud above was going to burst, dinners were hurriedly finished. 
Sports drinks were drank, food bags were hung, teeth brushed and settled in for the night happened slowly.","Day 64 (Rest Day 3) Dalesville

I checked them and we received a no BS full price offer on our house which has been for sale for 3 years plus now with no interest. Immediately, I placed the thru hike on hold until a later date because this holds higher priority. I booked my flight for Monday, apologized to my friend for not being able to visit, said I love you, good luck, had amazing time to Branden and post pic when you get to Katahdin. 750 miles of the AT section hiked for now, not bad for very first attempt. Thank you to all the loyal followers that faithfully read our journeys each day. This will continue at a later time and date. Branden is still continuing the full hike, but is not blogging.
I was going to hop off the trail at the 1000 mile marker due to persistent

2) Recurring Left Foot Extensor Tendonitis (Same Injury at Pearisburg)
3) Toe Bones Pop Every Step Both Feet
4) Knee Caps Bothered by Everything

Transporter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636291,"As the sun rose illuminating the hotel room through the window, the first official day begins.
Starting off with a brown bag breakfast (apple juice, trail bar, water, mini muffins) provided by hotel, the journey starts.
Hiking a few miles in, the temperature was a calming 70 degrees. Following the worn path and the white blazes, 2 small bridges were crossed with little to no water running underneath. Heading a bit further, 2 larger bridges were crossed.
Heading across a nearby highway, the trail continued upwards for 1000 feet. Ascending the well worn path stripped of grass, a thru hiker came into view.
Chatting with Honeybadger for a few minutes he told us he took 5 days off before hiking the trail again today. Moving on, 30 minutes later 2 more thru hikers came by. 
Chatting for around 5 minutes, goodbyes were said to Poley and Light House from Maine whose name came to be because his legs were neon white. Heading a bit further for 30 minutes, more thru hikers were seen.
Heading up the never ending trail section, the temperature increased drastically. Humidity set in and the sweat began to pour from every crease. Stopping several times to slow rapidly beating hearts, the trail roof shelter could be seen. 2 more hikers were present at the shelter.
Talking with Bender (Started from approach trail (744.5 miles travelled) who met Zero in Daleville VA) and Zero (Worked a few months in Whitefish MT and met Bender in Daleville VA also, camp chores needed to be done.
Settling in to the shelter, water needed to be secured using a Sawyer squeeze bag (dirty water) with a filter that screws onto the bag. The bag is rolled down like a toothpaste tube to force water through the filter into a clean hydration reservoir. Voices were heard in the distance.
Peace Pipe (obvious here) and Spidey (on day 77 on trail) were looking for the cistern water source secured by gutters on the shelter.
Moments before Loon and Samwise got ro the shelter, the skies full fury unleashed.
Rains began slowly. Mild winds furiously turned to heavy rains that blew water half way into the shelter as all occupants cowered in the corners. 
Lightning illuminated the sky as thunder boomed like a canon 14 miles away. The trees swayed and bent under the intense winds. Lightning lit the sky again and the thunder sounded off 5 miles away. After 45 minutes of light to furious weather, nature let up and the views of the distant mountain tops could once again be seen.","Day 64 (Rest Day 3) Daleville

Transporter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636386,"Awakening around 7am, thoughts of no more shelter snoring, midnight hiking arrivals with flashlight headlamp blinding like car high beams and rummaging around crinkling freeze dried bags, thoughts moved to breakfast. 
Thinking about breakfast, new gear needed to be tested or eaten.
Grabbing a Debbie Cocoa Nibs with granola and cranberries was selected.
Dumping a half liter of cold water in the package (the originial package it came in needing only to tear off the top and mix) the breakfast was now swimming. Dumping in some dried berries, the meal was ready. Looking around to see if anyone else noticed, nope got off scott free. Smooth.
Grabbing a spork, the first bite was taken. At this point, someone usually asks ""how is it?"" 
The response was omg wth is this crap? ""Was this scraped off the bottom of a dumpster?"" Bleghhhh, grosss, wth.
Continuing with the 2nd bite to the last was a grimacing effect with every bite, especially because it was drown in a swirling brown (cocoa) liquid. MMMMMM. Tasty.
Enjoying every last bite? The liquid was drank too because it was partly water and floating debris resembling a sewage pit, the answer was No!!!
Finishing off breakfast while packing 3 breakfast bars and meat sticks for lunch, ended with camp breakdown. 
It was a breezy, humid day. The sun peaked out from behind the clouds every now and then casting shadows that ghosted across the tree tops. Travelling larger miles today was attempted. Around 4 miles in, Subman and Suds came into view.
Both of these two hiked all 2190 miles of the AT in 2016 and for some reason were doing it again in 2021. Subman (prior navy) and his wife suds (used too much soap on her socks washing them in the stream and bam she got her trailname)
Trailnames are usually when you do something dumb and then are Branded with that TrailName which mirrors the offense committed.
These can be kept or, the next TrailName can be assigned as many times as is necessary to stop doing stupid shit 
Taking a photo, saying goodbye, the trail called again.
Travelling for the remaining 2.5 miles, a few more thru hikers were spotted at the shelter.
Tex (from Texas) and Barepaw were seated eating some trail mix and water. After chatting with these 2 for awhile, food bags were hung and teeth were brushed.
A warm sleeping bag called, as the winds whipped lightly to moderately, inviting the 44 degree night to settle in.","Day 66 FullHardt Knob Shelter

Transporter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636518,"Awakening at midnight before the morning travel commenced, sticks and limbs cracked under the weight of something large heading towards camp.
Crunch, crunch, snap (sharp loud breathing out 2 times)
Lightning cracked off in the distance casting a shadow on the tent wall of something round and large. This unknown thing went slowly towards the privy, where a nearby tree, suspended all camp occupants food bags.
A tree could be heard flexing and a sharp crack followed. Three more times this happened. After a few hours, no trace of the loud behemoth could be found. Was this imagination? Not when Tina heard exactly the same things.
Sleep soon called and the morning began.
A frosty 40 something degree morning awaited.
Hiking many unending ups and downs, about 2.5 miles was reached. An overview of the valley was nearby. Light to dark green tree tops lining the mountainside were seen. A few clouds blanketed the valley floating just below the mountain tops. 5 to 10 homes with various colors of red metal roofs to dark shingles were in the distance.
Moving on another 2.5 miles, Tina was speaking of wanting trail magic. That is when it appeared in an opening with a drive off area for an overlook. 2 trail angels were present.
(Trailname) Firewalker, real name Joe and (Traveler) Trailname, Robert Lee (from Virginia), were awaiting with cokes, waters,  bananas, trail bars and lots of memories. Downing an 8oz coke and trail bar while Tina had a banana and a water, the hosts were thanked and hiking to the shelter soon followed.
Setting up camp, getting water and selecting tent sites were next to do.
Spidey came down the trail to the shelter looking to resupply his water. Chatting for about 15 minutes, it was revealed he was going off trail for few days with dad to join mom for mothers day and also go to the trail days festival at damascus VA. 
Trail Days is a huge outdoor enthusiast, food festival with music and much more.

Transporter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636594,"Day 69 - Arising to a chilly 44 degrees, camp was broken down, water filtered and the trail was followed. It rained all day. Rain jackets were put on just before 2 overlooks showed up. These were the same as many view points before, with tree tops, clouds in the distance and homes in the valley. 
After moving on for 6.5 miles, Spidey was sighted. He changed his pick up spot to head off trail for a week or two. Heading to Mountain Cove Shelter (no water), home was setup in the shelter as the wind and frigid rains were howling. A thru hiker named Bivy showed up almost at dusk. Chatting for an hour, night time settled in.
Day 70 At exactly midnight, the forest fell completely silent. This means only one, not fun fact, (predators are in a few mile vicinity)
Bivy shined a light at an area that was producing noise. 2 eyes shined and looked aggresively back. 
Losing interest, it moved on. Thank god. Sleep soon overpowered the shelter occupants and soon 6am was here. After a short morning, the pathway was followed. Hiking 3.4 miles to a parking area, a shuttle was called.
It showed up, shuttled down to the campground where eggs, bacon, toast and hashbrowns were thoroughly devoured.
Awaiting a cabin with some power, laundry and showers ended with some much needed luxury.","Day 68 Bobbletts Gap Shelter
",Days 69 - 70 Middle Creek Campground,"May 08, Sat",9.70
Transporter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636932,"Awakening from the cabin at 6am, it rained everywhere in the campground. Walking to the store with thoughts of food and settling debts comes to mind. 
Expecting the store to be open on a Sunday doesnt work so well. It doesnt open until 730am. Finally it opens and a hot breakfast is served. Eggs, bacon, toast, hasbrowns are pulverized in mere minutes.
Shuttling back to the last point the trail was left happened next. 
2500 foot unbelievable ascents were endured. Every step was a gusty, hot undertaking. Each step was an incredibly hard to take. Each joint, every body part was pummeled with pain and soreness. Pushing through, the shelter appears in the distance. Soon, night envelops the valley with its complete darkness.
Awakening early the journey starts fresh. It is a cold and humid day. 2.5 miles are travelled before an overlook can be seen. 
Moving forward 5 miles, the shelter with a frog in the reliable water source can be seen. Looking up, a sign reads ""treat or boil this water source."" Agreeing that this is definitively the best option, water is filtered and another 3 miles is travelled until Thunder Ridge Overlook was reached.
2 girls had lunch set up for her sister and boyfriend. There were 2 chairs, a champagne bottle on ice, plastic grapes, a blanket and a few other items set up. Moving to the shelter, more hikers were present and thinking, ""Never truly alone in the wildnerness."" Night once again sets in.
Awakening early from a tent site, the sounds of rain could be heard. The tent was sopping wet. The rainfly was soaked. The footpring (underlay for tent) was wet and some had seeped into the main tent area.
Packing up a wet mess, breakfast was eaten further up the trail against an uphill open area. Oatmeal and dried berries took care of the morning food.
3.8 miles were travelled to get to Marble Springs for water. 
2.2 miles further was undertaken and a flat campsite where a deer was eating its lunch was nearby. Pictures were taken and descending a 1000 foot section happened next.
A section hiker named Over the Hill Bill appeared. He was hiking while leaving a new puppy at home with his wife. Exchanging goodbyes, Mikes Creek Shelter was reached and night soon crept in.
Rising at dawn, a few miles were hiked and a footbridge came into view. It was a brown lightly rusted iron bridge with thick wood slats to walk on. 
Crossing the bridge, the temp dropped sharply. Moving across and down the other side, the air came alive with a light sweet scent of (looks like) mini white roses. Arriving at the pickup spot was soon to be.
Waiting an hour to get picked up at James river Parking area and taken to Stanimals was next. 
Wifi, hot showers, towels, 11 beds with one private room, coffee, some candy bars and a tent area awaited for the next say and a half. Considered a Nero (hike a little ways, but stay in town that day and a Zero which has no travel while in town.)","Days 69 - 70 Middle Creek Campground
