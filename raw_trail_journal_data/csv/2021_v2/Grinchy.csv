Grinchy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633930,Good friend walked with me southbound from the ATC center across the Shenandoah to the bottom of the gap. Had no idea how far I would get. Made it to the Lesser Shelter mid afternoon and decided that was enough for the first day. A couple short section hikers that are now known as The Jersey Boys stopped for awhile but pushed on. Had a solo stay there. Very nice shelter Letâ€™s see what tomorrow brings!,"Harpers Ferry

Grinchy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633931,Woke up to heavy rain ... held off starting until it subsided. Stayed wet off and on all day with some drizzle mixed in. Decided to stay at Bears Den Hostel. Only a couple of other hikers there. Looks like it is a busy place in season. Hoping it will be a dryer start in the am.,"

Grinchy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633932,Warm but foggy this am. Was hoping for some views from the rocks just down from the hostel. Letâ€™s see what the day brings! The learning of the day is that even though you are looking down maybe 85% of the time one still needs to pay attention as to where you are going. Somehow missed a turn on the trail and ende up walking along a private land boundary. Took a few minutes to figure out that I hadnâ€™t seen any white blazes. Actually saw some permanent AT boundary markers so kept going. Finally checked Guthook and sure enough was way off trail. Being too stubborn to retrace my steps bushwhacked my way back to the trail (could of even been a bit shorter!) Another interesting note is that the day was spent on a section that is known as the Roller Coaster. No explanation required...Hiked into the Rod Hollow Shelter around 1700 hrs. Had passed by the Jersey Boys earlier in the day and they showed up about an hour later. Everyone crashed by 2130hrs. Will try to get to Manassas Gap Shelter tomorrow.,,View Entry,"Mar 25, Thu",0
Grinchy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633934,"Had breakfast with the Jersey Boys and headed out @ 0830hrs. Been sleeping ok for the first few hours but then all bets are off ... maybe an old people thingðŸ¤£? Will attempt to get to the Manassas Gap Shelter today. Will be the longest day yet.Arrived at MGS at 1600hrs. Wouldnâ€™t have wanted to go much further. Hoping the trail legs come sooner than later because I donâ€™t consider this fun yet!
There were a few folks at the shelter but were tenting. A family from DC and two women who were doing a trial run with some new gear. Had shelter to myself. Beautiful moon and lots of owl hoots!","Rod Hollow Shelter

Grinchy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633937,"Woke again at zero dark thirty but was assured of seeing a gorgeous sunrise. Filtered some water for the DC folks and had breakfast with the gals who were headed north about 5 mi. Looked at the weather forecast and have decided to take a zero on Sunday, not only because of the weather but will be starting Shenandoah National Park so want to make sure everything is in order. Should be in Front Royal middle of the afternoon.","Manassas Gap Shelter

Grinchy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633938,"Was expecting to be able to stay at the Mountain House B&B/Hostel last night but because of COVID they have limited capacity and were full. It seems that many weekenders come out from DC which is only about 75 mi away. Since they are right off the trail decided to stop there for some information if nothing else.
Best decision that I have made so far. The owners Lisa and Scott are fabulous. They were all apologetic about not being able to accommodate me but offered a shuttle into town along with a tour of where I might be interested in going, resupply, outfitter etc. He said to give him a shout this morning and he would come back down and pick me up from where I stayed last night and bring me back to their place where I will spend the night with them. They also have th SNP backcountry permit so I should be all set there. 
Will post one more time at the end of the day.","Front Royal

Grinchy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634400,Glad to have stayed at the MHH last night. Big winds came with heavy rain about 1800 hrs with the wind continuing all night. Ran into to hikers who had stayed on a shelter and one still looked traumatized from all the branches and trees coming down around them. Left the Mountain House Hostel @0830 hrs after some French toast and fruit. Entered the Shenandoah National Park late morning. Had to stop and make out a backcountry camping permit ... guessing so the can keep track of trail and park usage. Gave myself 9 days to get through the park but thinking it should take more like 7. Should get my legs underneath me a little bit and get some better miles in. Got to the Gravel Springs Hut around 1800 hrs. Not really hungry but cooked a Knorr pasta pouch just because. Knocked off 13.4mi for the day. Mi 958.6 from Springer,"Front Royal Va

Grinchy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634401,Uneventful night with the temperature somewhere around fourth I would guess. Was there by myself. Passed a couple of section hikers headed north. Looking like a lot of SNP facilities have yet to open so that means that the water has not been turned on yet. No boggy but just need to be conscious of other locations. Mileage lined up to stay @ the Pass Mountain Hut 945.5 Met a nice young couple ... Tippy Toes and her friend Never Under Sixty. He thru hiked back in 16 and they wer now headed to Pa before starting their new careers. Best wishes to them! Rain is forecast for tomorrow. Need to leave early and get out of Thorntonâ€™s Gap and over Maryâ€™s Rock before it starts. 13.1 for the day,"Gravel Springs Hut

Grinchy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634403,"On the trail by 0730. Long downhill into Thornton Gap and steep rocky climb up and over Maryâ€™s Rock. Was prepared to stay @ Byrds Nest 3 Hut (4.5 mi away) if it turned out to be too wet but the rain held off until it was too late late to turn around. Not that Iâ€™m afraid of getting wet, more concerned about footing and taking a header! Got wet anyway and changed clothes under a gazebo at one of the Parkâ€™s picnic areas. Overall not a bad day. Got to the Rock Spring Hut around 1800 hrs. Met a sped teacher from outside of Philly who was sectioning the Park on his spring break. Wakeem had hit the trail with mostly summer gear and was hoping for the best weather wise. We both thought the rain was finished but was awakened by a torrential downpour and as luck would have it turned to snow and dipped low enough to freeze everything that was still wet. Supposed to stay cool and then get real cold tomorrow. Time will tell! 15.3 miles","Pass Mt Hut
