Scooby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628900,As you can tell I am now in the class of 2021 along with a bunch of others that didn't hit the trail too. As long as we don't have anything else going on that will prevent us from getting on trail it will be one busy place especially starting from Springer. Should have plenty of fellow hikers to hike with. See y'all in March,,View Entry,"Jul 01, Wed",0
Scooby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631795,The days are flying by which means the dream is getting closer. I am ready to get on the trail and head north.,,View Entry,"Nov 11, Wed",0
Scooby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631834,"Wasn't too sure if my Osprey Kestrol 48 pack would be big enough for all my stuff and four days of food so I decided to pack it. All of my hikes have been overnighters and in warm weather so the extra warm clothes will be the issue. After cramming it all in I was amazed that it all fit. When the temps rise then I get to send a few items home which will help out a lot as well. The max recommend weight is 35 pounds so I will be close to that. That is one thing you should check when buying a pack. It will help it last longer. 
So now I'm sitting here waiting on March to get here.",,View Entry,"Nov 14, Sat",0
Scooby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632787,Was able to finally get out and hike on the AT. Awesome day out today. Temps were in the lower 60’s which meant I didn’t have to bundle up to hike. I hiked on an easier part of the trail. Not much of an elevation change. Hiked from Walnut Mountain Rd to FS 293 for a total of 3.2 one way. I went in and out so a total of 6.4. There was plenty of water flowing so any north bounders will have no prob with water.Also there is a bunch of camp sites right next to Laural stream for those who like the sound of flowing water.I didn’t see a soul out there today which surprised me. Hoping to at least seen one thru hiker. A little more than three weeks before I head to Springer. Can’t wait,,View Entry,"Feb 24, Wed",0
