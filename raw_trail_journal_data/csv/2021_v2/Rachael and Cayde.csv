Rachael and Cayde,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633239,"Life Update: Cayde and I have decided to go hike the Appalachian Trail. For those of you that are thinking, “That’s great! What is that?” We quit our jobs and are going to go hike in the woods. From Georgia to Maine. For the next 5-6 months. Without a gun. Of our own free will. Ever wonder what would make two adults give up showers, shelter, and the cutest dog? It is cheesy, but the mountains are calling and we must go. 
Since we started dating we have talked about doing a thru hike of the AT. Granted, it was all very hypothetical until suddenly it wasn’t. Like most things in life, it isn’t just one thing driving us to this challenge, but it certainly feels like the right time. It’s amazing what you can do when you don’t have a mortgage, kids, or a defined career path. We have both been adventurous souls as one must be in AmeriCorps NCCC (where we met) but the insanity is a recent development. I blame COVID. 
Luckily, both of us continued working full time in-person through the pandemic, but we really missed traveling and struggled to spend enough time together as essential workers. I tried another city job with regular hours although it just wasn’t the right fit. Since I was unemployed and unsure what to try next, Cayde figured he’d quit too just to do our adventure of a lifetime. We are really looking forward to sharing this experience with our friends and family here. Please check back for what we hope are regular updates!

Rachael and Cayde,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634541,"We spent the last two weeks frantically trying to get our house on the market and by the grace of large amounts of caffeine and the kind assistance of my parents we have successfully transitioned into frantically trying to get ourselves ready to hike.
We are excited sure but filled with little worries about every little piece of gear, crumb of food and scrap of notebook paper containing scribbles about every conceivable topic in the field of long-distance hiking. We have strewn Rachael’s saintly and supportive parent’s living room with our mishmash of mountain house meal bags, paperback novels, trail mix, sunscreen, bug spray, socks, first aid, assorted clothing and one pink, flowery, stuffed pig (which Rachael sleeps with so that our dog Marion will have something to remember our scent by), more than once. 
Rigorous testing of our tent and sleeping systems has come by way of a few overnights in the yard right next to Rachael’s parents’ house. We are happy to report that we have great confidence in our comfy, cozy sleeping arrangements and that our AT experience will have way less motorcyclists trying to break speed records at 3 a.m. through a suburban housing plan.   
The only times we stop discussing, debating, packing and re-packing are during our practice hikes. We took another one just today and came to the realization that trekking poles are a gift from God. Up until this point we were both a bit iffy on the idea of carrying a fiberglass pole in each hand for more than 2,000 miles. I for one thought they just looked dorky and off-putting, but once you realize that they make climbing hills slightly less painful, seeing as that is basically all you do, and descending steep slopes feel less like a death-defying feat of balance, you start to warm up to the poles a little.

Our latest pack and weigh brought our fully loaded packs in at a manageable 35ish pounds apiece.  We still need to get our food wired down to just the things we want have when we start, but we are getting there. We still have a lot of nerves, but with most of the mechanics in place hopefully getting out there will clear up any lingering uncertainty about the plan. We should be headed for Georgia the 11th, more to come before then.

Rachael and Cayde,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634706,"You’ve got questions and we’ve got answers! Here are the most common questions we’ve received:


Are you taking a gun? No, it is not really necessary for the dangers we will find and it is incredibly difficult to do legally. You would have to have a carry permit in all of the individual states as they don’t all  have reciprocity with each other. 


Are you going to find Bigfoot? Already did: Cayde wears a size 14 shoe. 


Is Marion (our dog) going? Not so far. We want to get our feet under us and focus on our own hike before adding in our furry friend, who we dearly love and are sure would love the trail. Marion has been great on all of our shakedown hikes, but we are afraid on the AT she will be a little too excited about chasing squirrels,deer, black bears, porcupines and innocent hikers not interested in getting a tongue bath, even though they may need it. 


Where will you stay? On the trail: in our tent, which we up sized to a three person type. The larger size being mainly to give Cayde enough room to fit head to toe and give us each enough personal space to maintain our marriage. In town: in hostels and hotels, the homes of sympathetic friends and relatives, any place with the promise of a shower really. 


Where will you pee? At least 200 feet off the trail and at least 200 feet from drinking water sources. Beyond that, wherever we want. 


What about bears? We will hang our food and other smelly stuff up on a tree in a scent-proof Kevlar bag in  order to keep fuzzy wuzzy foragers at bay. Unless they are cornered or protecting cubs black bears aren’t particularly aggressive and tend to keep their distance if you make enough noise. 


What about beer? We hear there is dehydrated backpacking brew (just add water!) that we may try as a science experiment, sounds pretty risky though. Luckily, there are quite a few local microbreweries within spitting distance of the trail, and we are excited to discover the best barley pop east of the Mississippi. After all: “Beer is proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy” 
-Benjamin Franklin 


How long will this take you? The average thru-hike takes about 168 days. The fastest ever was an ultramarathon runner who did it in 41 days. We won’t be thru-hikers until we’ve finished the trail and for now our philosophy is more that we are going to go as far as we can and we hope that is the whole way. 


How long have you been married? 3 Years 5 months 2 weeks and 6 days. Think we’ll make our fourth anniversary? 


Did you sell all your stuff? Everything that wouldn’t fit in Cayde’s Dad ‘s basement or on our backs.


We are excited to get started in the next few days. Can’t wait to answer some of our own questions and get first hand experience! Stay tuned.-Cayde and Rachael",,View Entry,"Apr 11, Sun",0
Rachael and Cayde,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634735,"Lots of brain power and hard work has gone into the planning for our trip. From a loose daily itinerary (for Mom) to special research on each carefully selected piece of equipment, few topics have consumed our conversations as much as trail names. These are short funny names given to hikers for use on the trail. Most are bestowed with the name rather than selecting it themselves. Some common names are squatch, mountain goat, strider, etc. Personally we like U-haul for a gentleman who carried an 80 lbs pack who was mentioned in a documentary we enjoyed.
If you know Cayde, then you probably know he is a word wizard and enjoys finding eclectic phrases that he deems “band name of the day”. Examples: Bones and the Bovines, Knives at Night. Possible trail names have taken over our imaginations.
We will let you know what actually gets bestowed on us when we are out there. In the meantime, here are just a few names to share for your entertainment. What do you think your trail name would be?

Rachael and Cayde,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634825,"Would have posted this last night but couldn’t get any phone service. Go figure! 


Today was our first full day on the AT. We started with the Approach trail from Amicalola Falls yesterday and made it about 10 miles to the Springer Mountain shelter. That climb was rough. We have a new phrase we use to describe flat easy hiking ahead which is “Iowa Hiking”. Despite putting in the miles to train we weren’t able to practice much elevation and now these Georgia mountains are kicking our butts. 

The last two days were sunny and beautiful. We even ate lunch at a waterfall that was so picturesque my Mom says it looks like a Bass Pro Shop display. First night of rain tonight and then dry again tomorrow. So far we are impressed with our tent’s waterproofing. Hope it holds up!
We are quickly realizing that one of our favorite pastimes is to drink tea or eat dinner at the shelter picnic tables and converse with total strangers. It is just fascinating to learn where people are from, what made them come out to hike, and share laughs with everybody. 


Tomorrow will be a difficult climb- dry and uphill from what we hear. A bad day out here is miles better than a good day at work so we hike on. Will send updates when we can! Thanks for following along with us!

Rachael and Cayde,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635090,"We are really getting in the swing of things on the trail! Circumstances have made it a little tough to update, but we have a lot to share! 


At Cooper Gap we were the happy recipients of our very first trail magic: “Running Bear”, a long section hiker who has twice completed the trail in its entirety, fed all the hikers coming down off of Sassafras Mountain. We got some great advice and delicious ( as well as potentially magical since Rachael swears it cured her aching ankle) hotdogs! Big thanks again to Running Bear and his wife, that quick lunch was the highlight of our day! 


On our 5th Day on the trail we made it up Blood Mountain, the highest point in Georgia and a place of special significance for us both. A two room stone shelter on top of the mountain was built by members of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) in 1937. The CCC was the basis and inspiration for the creation of the National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC), the organization we were both serving with in 2014 when we met. NCCC is so integral to the course of our lives. It got us on this path. We made friends who hiked, thru-hiked and had a passion for the outdoors like we did. We built hiking trails. Rachael even built one that connected to the AT. Encountering something that connects to our year of service, along the trail, was a special moment for us. 


Lastly, I am happy to say that we are making good progress getting our trail legs. We are getting tougher and feeling better (in the mornings, we still crash hard into camp at night). With a few mountains behind us and waaay more than a few in front of us it’s tough to say for sure that we are going to make it all the way to Maine, but finding out is part of the adventure!

Rachael and Cayde,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635516,"We are writing this post from the shelter of our tent. Today was a full day of rainstorm and high winds. We are happy to report that our tent is holding up great and we are still dry! 
The last few days have been restful as we stopped in Hiawassee: “Georgia’s Lake and Mountain Paradise” according to town marketing! It was here that we realized something important. People talk about how trips, falls, diseases, bears, or injuries take them off the trail. What they don’t tell you is that the greater threat is in clean sheets, hot showers, and delivery pizza. There is nothing like a large Dominos pie to make you think, “what the heck are we doing?” Luckily for us, we got our just in time. Marching back into the woods head first into the storm we currently find ourselves in. Encouragingly, we are setup just about five miles from the Georgia- North Carolina border and when the rain let’s up we plan to dash over our first state line to the next shelter this afternoon.
For the sake of catchup, our few days before Hiawassee included climbs over Rocky Mountain, Tray Mountain, Dismal Mountain, and Powell Mountains- just to name a few. Tray Mountain in particular offered beautiful views of the landscape we have crossed so far. Rachael was able to geek out over the 6” round brass marker placed dead center on the trail by the US Geological Survey in 1934. Meanwhile Cayde laughed at the note on the plaque suggesting writing a letter to the USGS Director in Washington DC for information about the summit. 


Our sights are now set on Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC) in Bryson City, NC. We hope to take a day off to aqua blaze some miles. With good luck and good weather we should be there soon enough to enjoy some time on the river in a raft or kayak. Keep you posted!

Rachael and Cayde,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635729,"Well, we weren’t going to stop into town until three days from now but our personal stank drove us to Franklin, NC for showers. As we like to say, “It’s not a marathon, it is 83 of them!” May as well enjoy the moments of this whole thing. 



This time we are staying at a charming hiker hostel. A local opened his home to hikers and has been operating this for seven years. Hostels are unique hubs of eclectic personalities (aka people are weird but man are they entertaining). From funny clothes they give you to wear while they do your laundry (I tried to get Cayde to wear a pair of floral fleece women’s pajama pants and get a picture but failed) to the funny conversations overheard, it is a truly interesting experience! We will certainly be trying out more on our way!
Couple of feats since the last time we posted. We officially made it into North Carolina. For those of you wondering how we skipped South Carolina between Georgia and here, please see the above map.  Actually, we went from north of Atlanta up to NC then will straddle the North Carolina-Tennessee border along a ridge line and pass through TN. South Carolina is further east than NC round these parts. Also, we passed the first 100 miles on the AT! Just need to do that about 21 more times.


Tonight, we look forward to southern fried chicken and a big juicy burger. Sure beats tuna packets and mashed potatoes seasoned with ants, but that is a story for another time.

Rachael and Cayde,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636077,"Even though we have only been on trail for two weeks, we have already acquired new knowledge. Here are a few lessons we have learned.


Never pass up a good water source, pee tree, or chiropractic rock. That is a well positioned tree or spot for doing your lady or dirty business. All bathrooms located near parking lots are a required stop, because nothing beats a real, actual, indoor plumbing toilet! Make sure to take some extra toilet paper to-go if required. The chiropractor rock is far more rare. Our first day on the trail we were struggling to the first shelter and came upon what we deemed an honorary rock to be named after our fantastic former chiropractor who we moved away from. This big, beautiful hunk of stone (the rock not chiropractor) was flat on top and at the perfect incline to lay on. When I laid down on this thing in exhaustion, it cracked my back in all the right places. Thus, we now lay on all the good rocks trying to pick out the perfect one like Goldilocks (just without bears).


Beware of squeaky trees. When setting up camp, I am usually very particular about the grade of incline, possibility of rushing water, proximity of dead trees, and ability to create a impenetrable bear fortress that Cayde claims is completely arbitrary and imaginary. He just lets me make it up and choose where we setup. This allows him to sleep without me waking him up every 10 minutes because I hear “noises”. Unfortunately, we setup near a very squeaky tree a few nights ago. When arriving to camp, I did the usual 20 point inspection but failed to account for squeakiness since there was no wind whatsoever. Around 2am the wind picked up and all night I was convinced I heard an animal batting and swinging our bear bag like a piñata. In the morning, (when clearer heads prevailed) it turned out it was just two trees rubbing together all night. Consider point 21 added to the campsite checklist.


Agree to lodging arrangement prices before staying at establishments. This may seem like common sense, but not any that we had. We decided to go in to town last minute. After calling a very cheap motel and giving them our name but no payment information we made our way to the gap where we could get a shuttle for transportation into town. While we waited, a hostel shuttle driver asked if we wanted a lift into town. Weary travelers that we were we agreed. In the van, the driver, who was also the hostel owner, asked us why we decided to stay in the motel instead of a hiker friendly hostel. Really we had just heard from other hikers that the people there were kind. He mentioned that he was cheaper and proceeded to give us potato chips. As most people know, the way to a hikers heart is through their stomach, so we bit the bait. Throughout our pleasant but eclectic stay we kept mentioning and saying that we wanted to pay for our stay. He usually just acted busy or said we would take care of it later. Finally on the morning of our departure, as we were waiting for his shuttle as a completely captive audience he rang each guest up individually. That is when we realized that his pricing structure was not established but totally based on his whims. He proceeded to charge us more than the room at the motel would have been, add extra charges like two laundry fees (since there are two of us but they did our clothes in one load), a shuttle fee, and a credit card fee (despite me having cash). We now know we will establish pricing before utilizing services.


Hope that gives you a bit of insight into our newly acquired skills. We are sure that many more will surface so we will make sure to share as we go on!

Rachael and Cayde,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636778,"We are still going! Haven’t been able to post in a while due to spotty reception in the backcountry of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and personal exhaustion. Here are some highlights: 


We made it to Clingman’s Dome (the highest elevation on the AT at 6,643 ft) on a balmy 30 degree day. Got to experience rain, snow, sleet, hail, and sun all in about a five hour period. We both were wearing just about every article of clothing we had that day. Overall, we have been very healthy and lucky so far. No blisters between the both of us, but I developed numbness in several toes due to my feet swelling two to three sizes. We went into Gatlinburg for new shoes and now without the pain I feel fast! The Great Smoky Mountains have been challenging with less rewarding vistas due to fog and cold. Beautiful scenery when it does choose to clear up occasionally!


Slowly we have been putting in more miles and did three 15 mile days in a row this past week. Partly to keep up with a new friend we made, “Rocket”. He is a veteran and hiking for a charity. It is the Honor Flight organization which flies veterans from different wars to their respective monuments in DC to honor them. If you are interested in donating checkout: https://gofund.me/2c75a0ac. It has been fun to connect with a fellow thru hiker and create a little team even for just a short while. He will continue to crush big miles as he heads north so we may not run into him again on trail. 


We have not seen any bears yet. Store owners in Gatlinburg are known to shoo bears with brooms,they are supposed to be thick as thieves out here. No luck so far but thankful they are keeping a safe distance. We did have our first rattlesnake on trail- up the large elevation gain outside of the NOC. It was large and loud! Probably had just eaten a big meal because despite other hikers throwing sticks and rocks it refused to budge from the trail. Cayde and I just steered clear and went waaay around. Left a note in the dirt and warned fellow hikers of its whereabouts.


We both have trail names! “Radar” and “Research”. I got radar due to a weather mishap. We had bad thunderstorms last Tuesday. When I checked the radar and forecast, it looked like there was supposed to be a break at 11am. We got a shuttle from the hostel we were staying in to ride out the storm. The weather never cleared all day. It was especially bad when we were climbing a particularly high bald and realized we were clearly the tallest thing around while lightning continued all over the area. Later, we found out at Fontana Lodge that four people were struck by lightning in the Smokies. They are reported to have survived and be ok but we are thankful we somehow stayed safe! “Rocket” deemed me “Radar” as I could never live that one down. Cayde started being referred to as “Research” due to his extensive knowledge on all sorts of trivial topics and inability to pass any educational signs without fully reading them. It fits so well!


It takes just about everything out of us to hike, setup camp, make dinner, filter water, and survive. We haven’t been able to keep up with the blog or our journal as much as we had hoped. Happy we can share our experience when we do get moments in town or decent cellphone reception!

Rachael and Cayde,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637546,"The trail continues to be an adventure and challenge! We have had a number of first encounters or lessons and thought we should regale you all with some of the tales.
First shelter stay. We had been avoiding shelters due to COVID social distancing guidance and just staying in our tent next to them for the first few weeks. In the Smokies we experienced some harsh weather and decided to take advantage of their double decker deluxe structures. We were a little nervous from all the trail tales we had heard about mice and snoring. One section hiker described a horrific night where mice kept ripping her hair out to make a nest and left acorns in her pack pockets. Others told us to sleep with our heads directed out from the wall since the mice live there in the holes of the stones or logs. Overall, we had an uneventful night. No mice crawling over us as everyone hung their packs on lines or chains at the front of the lean-to and food from the bear cables. Cayde was about the loudest snorer which you could hardly hear over the relaxing sound of rain on the metal roof. We had fun talking to the other section and thru hikers in the shelter and appreciated the craftsmanship of the well designed structures in the Smokies. Since then we have stayed in three other shelters. Not quite as nice but still very helpful in rain storms! 


First hitch. Usually when we are looking for a ride into town there are shuttle drivers we can call posted on information boards by the trailheads or in our trail app, but Gatlinburg was challenging. After ramping up to 15 mile days in the Smoky Mountains my feet started killing me. We needed to go into Gatlinburg for larger shoes. We knew our shot would be at one of the tourist parking lots and decided to look for a ride below Clingmans Dome. After exhausting our list of shuttle drivers with no response or rejections we were left to putting out a thumb. At first we tried to talk to people in the parking lot and get a ride but eventually we resigned ourselves to standing at the exit of the parking lot and thumbing it. I actually even resorted to letting my hair down to look more like a girl and had Cayde keep his mask off so we looked more friendly and approachable. We had two trucks with couples in their 60s stop. The first was going the opposite way while the second was luckily going right to Gatlinburg. We lucked out! The couple the picked us up was super sweet offering us tea or soda and snacks. They were retired military nurses from Louisiana who fell in love with the mountains and are currently building a cabin in Gatlinburg. They were staying in town just one block away from us so they dropped us off right in front of the motel! Never in my life did I think or hope that I would need to hitch a ride but I’m sure glad it worked out as well as it did. Luckily, on our way back we were able to get a ride from a hiker friend’s parents. Otherwise, we had heard it could take hours to find a ride back up the mountain.


First bear encounter. Despite being out of GSMNP (Great Smokies) bears were at large in the first few shelters coming out of the park. On a very cold, wet day we stopped hiking early. We got soaked to the bone and I started to shiver uncontrollably. We pulled into Groundhog Creek Shelter to get on dry clothes and warm up. When we got there we quickly realized this was a bear heavy area from the bear graffiti on the shelter walls and a torn bear hang food cable, all of which was quickly confirmed by the accounts of bear sightings in the shelter log book and comments on our trail app. We knew that either more people needed to come to the shelter or we were going to have to hike another eight miles to the next one. Luckily, Cavu and Firefly showed up. They are a retired couple who made it clear they were staying because they were not able to make it to the next spot. We stayed too. They made a fire out of wet sticks (a Herculean tasks) in minutes and set to drying all of our boots and socks out. We all made dinner and talked. By 8pm, which was when the bear sightings were common we had all our food and even whole packs hanging on the remaining bear lines. Sure enough just by the snap of a stick we looked up and saw a black bear. It was a Momma and three cubs. At first they kept their distance were unphased by our yelling and whistling. It was clear they were following their foraging rounds which included the perimeter of camp and every fire pit at the surrounding tent sites. We had already gone around and cleared all the trash we could find so it was an unfruitful search that night. Lastly, she headed closer to the shelter toward the bear cable to smell our packs. That is when all four of us jumped up and started yelling and clicking our trekking poles. That scared her and she took off running with all the cubs trailing her. Luckily, we didn’t see her the rest of the night. I’m a pretty light sleeper and only heard one mouse that night. 



The trail hasn’t been easy and has a way of both testing you and providing at the same time. It can be a love hate relationship. Cayde’s Mom sent us a little quote from her daily calendar that said, “The best view comes after the hardest climb.” My first reaction was yeah unless you are in the Smokies (challenging uphills with unrewarding white fog blocking vistas). She reminded me even the fog is pretty. Most people get out of life or experience what they choose to. Why not appreciate the fog?

Update: We made it out of the Smokies about a week and a half ago. Did them in about six hiking days. Visited Hot Springs which was a cute, welcoming small town that reminded us of home in Iowa. Unfortunately, I got food poisoning there so I did not get a chance to post earlier. Now we are in Erwin, Tennessee and enjoying time with our family who is visiting. On to Damascus, VA next!","

Rachael and Cayde,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638335,"Hello from Damascus, VA! On Tuesday, we reached our fourth state along the trail. Virginia is the longest state section on the AT and will probably take us about a month to go over 500 miles here. We have lofty goals of trying to finish this state in about a month. Since Erwin, we have had some great days and some rough ones, too. We thought we’d share the makings of the best and worst.


I always prefer to get the bad out of the way, so we will start there. Bottom line: our worst days are when we are wet and cold. This past Saturday, we hiked 3 miles. That’s not a typo- just 3. On Friday, we completed a 20.8 mile slack pack (hike without a full backpack where someone assists to drop the pack or hiker). It was rainy and stormy but without the weight of our packs we had a blast. We ran for fun on some of the downhills. We explored points of interest. We stopped to admire Eastern Newts. We got everything we needed at a hostel that night: showers, dinner, a bed, and even Netflix. On Saturday, we were in a poor mindset as soon as we returned to trail. It was very stormy and temperatures were in the mid 50s and dropping with elevation. We slogged on to the first shelter and stopped to eat lunch. I got very chilled as we sat, so I hopped into my sleeping bag. Soon we had agreed to take a nap and then we were done. Ironically, if we would have rallied and gone just 3 more miles then there would have been trail magic at the next road crossing. It’s amazing what a warm hot dog can magically do for an exhausted hiker. Everything is relative and getting little wins to stack up in your favor can really turn your mood around. Not letting trips, hunger, rain, and cold add up to an Eeyore attitude is a challenge. 


In contrast, last Monday was one of the best days we have had on trail yet. It started out like any other good weather day. We got some mileage knocked out in the morning. Ate lunch and laid down on a log to take a short nap. Woke up and started the afternoon march. The difference is that we proceeded to have surprise after surprise meet us. First, it was the ruins of a late 1800s mountaintop resort called the Cloudland Hotel. Then it was finding trash cans and a working water fountain by a national forest visitor center that had not yet opened for the season. Getting to lighten our load AND finding water when you have run out just makes you feel lucky! Next, we ran into a friend we knew and a new hiker that we got to know. We were excited to talk about home since she was from next door in Nebraska. Time passes way faster when we are distracted, so new acquaintances to hike with always give us a boost! Having someone actually understand where we are from instead of just saying: “Iowa, oh, cool” or “that’s the corn one right?” was refreshing. Then, we hit trail magic. Although, we missed the tequila shots they had earlier in the day, we were happy for the cold Gatorade, fresh fruit, and delicious Skittles. Afterwards, we ascended a series of three beautiful balds (mountains with no trees at the top) with amazing views of Roan Mountain. We much prefer to view mountains we have already climbed rather than upcoming ones. Finally, we arrived at a picturesque campsite called Overmountain (named for a group of historical Revolutionary war fighters), feeling great, just before sunset. We found a grassy flat tent site and more trail magic (beers and candy bars) waiting for us there. From the randomness of it all to the steady warm weather, it was an unexpectedly wonderful day.


One trail angel once told me, “happiness is just a hotel stay away!” That certainly helps! For us, we still feel like a bad day on trail is better than a good day at work. As long as that holds true, we will just keep on walking.

Rachael and Cayde,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638514,"Today we passed the 500 mile mark on the trail. Lots of mixed emotions with that marker. On one hand we feel accomplished to have made it this far, while on the other we know we have a lot longer to go- 1,693 to be exact.


Lately, I’ve been feeling the physical effects of hiking so much. We had to take our first double zero (no hiking) days in Damascus due to my right foot developing some tendonitis in the heel. I tried several traditional and non traditional home remedies and was able to head out after just two days of rest. We hear a lot of hiker stories where people didn’t rest when they should have and later had to take five+ zeros to heal. We figured we would rather rest for one than push it and have to pay for it later. Then the second day into our current section, I started having pain in my left ankle. We wrapped it and slowly continued. Stretching is crucial and we are trying to be better about doing that each morning, break, and evening. Hoping my body will adapt to the demands of trail and we can keep moving forward swiftly.



The other noticeable effect of walking so much is our weights. Both our body and pack weights have been decreasing. In Damascus, we took advantage of scales at our hostel and were pleased to confirm the changes. This is a slippery slope. It is nice to feel lighter but we worry about how fast we are losing and the number of calories we are consuming each day. Again, we hear stories about hikers losing too fast and their muscles breaking down (ketosis) or getting caught in cold snaps at high elevation without enough cold weather gear. It is certainly a balancing act.
We still feel like 500 miles is no small feat. Every day we get to see vistas, admire wildlife, and experience nature in ways that most people never get to. Last night, we camped in the Grayson Highlands and woke up to feral ponies running through our campsite. These unique experiences are well worth the aches and pains or frets over calories.

The first of the three is Dragons Tooth. A massive sandstone formation which dominates the landscape and offers great opportunities for climbing. We didn’t realize how difficult the climb up to it would be and really didn’t consider the climb down. We planned 16 and half miles for the day and spent half of it breathlessly scrambling over SUV-sized boulders. The other half we spent sliding down sheer cliffs in pursuit of a vague promise of cheeseburgers. One thing we have learned is that descending is much tougher than climbing.
Climbing is a mind over matter affair and with the right combination of conditioning, gumption and sweat you can make it up nearly anything. 


Going down off a mountain is a spin of the roulette wheel. All your momentum is driving you down, but obviously too much speed is no good. All your mental and physical effort is put into getting down without breaking something. You toss and roll gear down the hill to save it from getting in your way and scoot along on your butt to keep from getting too close of a look at the gorgeous 100ft drop offs surrounding you. This is complicated by exhaustion from the climb up and, as previously mentioned, distraction from an all consuming need for a cheeseburger. 


More than a little bruised, tired, sore and grumpy we did eventually find our burgers (... with bacon and two pizzas, a helping of mozzarella sticks, cokes and some zebra cakes) before bed. 


I spend so much time on how tricky and painful it was because I want you to know that our friend Kat Tracks, an amazing 60-years young woman from Colorado, did Dragons Tooth two days after us, with one broken arm in a splint and said it was her favorite part of the trail so far. 


We are in awe of her. 



The long day over dragons tooth was done for good reason. The next day we ascended Tinker Cliffs and McAfee Knob with my Mom and our dog Marion! Mom drove all the way out from Iowa to hike and say hello.
Happy to be reunited with family (furry and otherwise), we pushed on towards the other two jewels in the Virginia crown. 


Dry weather meant all ten of our legs hiked long stretches without water in intense Virginia humidity, but the views from McAfee Knob ( the most photographed spot on the entirety of the AT) and Tinker Cliffs ( a more remote, but no less beautiful place to view the valley) made the trek worth it. 


We were so happy to share the trail with my Mom and I think we were able to give her a sense of our adventure out here. About halfway through Virginia we are feeling some strain from the dreaded “Virginia Blues”, but moments like this keep us energized and focused on hiking our own hike.

Rachael and Cayde,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639848,"During our visit with my parents and more recently Cayde’s Mom, it seems like people are always interested in our resupply. I’ve been wanting to blog about food for a while but struggled with knowing where to start. There’s always more than one way to do something so my disclaimer is that this is what works for us right now. Also for reference, we eat pretty much anything and have relatively no food allergies. Cayde avoids grapefruit due to one attacking him when he was little and I try not to eat corn due to a slight allergy that I try to ignore.


Since we are hiking about 10-12 hours a day, we burn more calories than we can consume a lot of the time. Our daily calories should be about 5-6,000 compared to the normal 2-2,500. Also, we have to carry all the food we eat, so I know some hikers won’t pack out anything that isn’t over 100 calories per ounce of weight. We’ve heard tales of a raw vegan who carried 40 lbs of fruits and vegetables but looked like a holocaust survivor. When we get to town we eat fresh fruits or vegetables and high calorie meals to make up for our deficit on trail.


Breakfast. I want to start by saying our favorite bars are Big Sur bars. They are about 600 calories and feel like a brick but on mornings we have those we feel invincible for the first few hours. We first found these at an outfitter on trail and instantly fell in love. We made up commercials and talked about how great they were for hours that first day. Seriously, we would be happy to be spokespeople if anyone has any connections! Otherwise, we do clif bars (white macadamia and oatmeal raisin), nature valley (sweet & salty almond), or whatever bars we can find. A few times we have cold soaked oatmeal packets with breakfast essentials and then we add freeze dried fruit and walnuts which we have really enjoyed.


Lunch. We usually do tortillas with foil packs of tuna or peanut butter and honey. Recently, we discovered shelf stable bbq pork and buffalo chicken packets. We’ve been thankful for the break from tuna. Sometimes we will pack out a block of hard cheese from town and just slice that up for lunch with some pepperoni or beef jerky. If we have the space we like crackers or chips for lunch too. We try to pick hearty ones since they get mashed up in our bags and can turn to crumbs quickly.


Dinner. We started out using mainly backpacker meals like Mountain House, Backpackers Pantry, or AlpineAire. They are dehydrated meals that you prepare by boiling water, pouring it into the foil food bag, letting sit for 10-25 minutes and can eat hot right out of the bag. These have unique varieties like lasagna, pad thai, beef stroganoff, or fried rice, but they can be a bit pricey. We have been exploring more instant food options from the grocery store such as Velveeta cheese shells, Idahoan instant potatoes (Applewood smoked bacon), Zatarains rice (with pepperoni or chicken added), Stove Top stuffing, Ramen, and Knorrs pasta or rice sides. We don’t cold soak much but as the summer heat sets in we have plans to try it.


Snacks. These make up the most weight in our food bags. Lots of times we get into camp, setup our tent, blow up our sleeping pads & pillows, collect water, filter water, wipe or wash up, hang a bear bag line and don’t feel like making a whole meal. We like beef jerky, cheese sticks, cracker sandwiches, fruit snacks, packets of almond or hazelnut butter, snickers, trail mix, etc.


Variety is the spice of life. We try to change up flavors but for the most part we fall back on what we know. It has been interesting to see our tastes and cravings change. We tend to want a lot of junk food because our bodies need high calories. Also, I crave salads every time we go into town. Early on, Cayde said he really had a hankering for just a raw onion. So we try to do our best to get all the food categories in the traditional food pyramid but sometimes we do better than others.

Rachael and Cayde,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639965,"I’m up late writing because there is a loud mouse in our shelter. I know, I know- just one?! This is a pretty normal occurrence although we usually tent in good weather to avoid snoring hikers, nosey mice, and scary spiders. Tomorrow we have big food plans, so we had to make sure we could get a quick getaway in the morning. 


Our plans consist of hiking 14 some miles to a road crossing where we get picked up by a hostel shuttle and immediately request they take us to the one and only restaurant in town. We’ve already read the menu and are struggling with sticking to just two entrees a piece. For me, it will probably be a Chicken Parmigiana sub and chicken salad while for Cayde it sounds like a Philly Cheesesteak and spaghetti dinner. Some days the hiker hunger rages despite cramming in four meals plus snacks. 


We are also looking forward to showers and laundry. This is secondary to food but I’m sure the shuttle driver and hostel staff wish it was a priority. This time we have only been out for four days but with the rising temperatures and Virginia humidity that is long enough without a shower. We are ripe. 



Thru hikers joke that we can smell day hikers, but it really happened to me two days ago. We were walking along some downhill switchbacks when I thought I smelled something strongly floral and unfamiliar. Sometimes honey suckle or bushes of wildflowers can put out a strong aroma but this was different. Less than a minute later a young woman with just a fanny pack and a man with a water bottle passed us. I made sure to waft in their clean scent as they passed trying not to be noticeable or creepy.
You may wonder, why don’t you just wear deodorant or hairspray yourselves on trail? Short answer: I don’t want eaten. Whether it be a bear or swarm of mosquitoes, if I am attracted to it then I guarantee some animals or insects will be. So we hikers just molder in our natural musk instead. You get surprisingly used to it after a few weeks.


All this excitement on the eve of heading into town is mild compared to when we are hoping to take a zero or get a visit from family. Either way a “hot and a cot” (as my Dad likes to put it) are all it takes to put a little pep in our step these days.

Rachael and Cayde,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640836,"More miles of the AT run through Virginia than any other state. At 531.7 or over one fifth of the length of the trail, we have been in Virginia for 45 days now. Thru hikers have a term for this section of trail: Virginia Blues.


Virginia has been tougher than we expected. Former thru hikers, trail maintainers, and hostel folks all told us how VA would be easier, but in our opinion it was harder. In our first few weeks in the state we realized the makings of the Virginia Blues: an endless green tunnel, few to no overlooks or vistas, mysteriously continuous slight uphill, bottomless bugs, and hot humid swamp air. Nothing we couldn’t handle but just enough of everything to be frustrating. Additionally, the mental and physical aspects of hiking for three months caught up with us here. From feeling behind and worrying about finishing in time (Katahdin closes around Oct 15 weather permitting) to nagging injuries like high ankle sprains and unidentifiable skin lesions we limped along. We saw as friends struggled and left for their own multitude of reasons: plantar fasciitis, homesickness, money struggles, sick family members.


There were several things that really helped us to march on. First and foremost family. Cayde’s Mom came out from Iowa to visit bringing our dog and sharing in our struggle as she hiked with us for a couple of days. When asked if it was what she expected she said, “It’s harder than I thought it would be.” That made us feel better because it is hard! For the Fourth of July, my parents rescued us and took us to have fun with family. A Pittsburgh get-away with stops at Heinz History Museum, PNC Park, and Yough Lake helped us to recover and recharge. Then they slack packed us and gave out trail magic for three straight days in Shenandoah National Park. This really helped us get some good miles under us and defeat the horrible heat. 


On trail, our tramily or group we regularly hike with encouraged us and helped motivate us, too. Before visiting family we enjoyed long hiking days with our friends: Jive Turkey, AKA, Geo, and Karma. Geo is a LASHer (long a** section hiker). She has done over 1,000 miles of the trail and this summer went on a three week trip that covered over 400 miles! Her husband, Pole Position, helped us out by providing trail magic, slackpacking, pizza, gatorades, beer, and parking lot pasta on one occasion! We wouldn’t have gotten into Waynesboro to meet my parents in time for the holiday without them! Jive and AKA Kelly have hiked over 500 miles with us. We have split hotel rooms, shared luekotape, encouraged one another, laughed till it hurt (which doesn’t take much these days), and debated deep topics to pass the time. It is a unique bond of camaraderie that we have developed out here and are happy we found our crew. Although we struggle to label it: SPLC sweaty parking lot crew, parking loiters, the vortex, salty ponies, or something like that.


Friends off the trail have also been crucial in keeping our spirits up. We stayed with a former camp co-worker of mine in Front Royal last night and plan on crashing with an AmeriCorps friend in Winchester. These stays have helped us reconnect to our reasons for hiking and appreciate how far we have come!



There has been a lot of little tricks we’ve employed to help with our trip. Audible books or podcasts have kept us entertained. Delicious food at way side stations along the Shenandoahs rewarded us for hard days. The mantra “BlackBerry Milkshake” single handedly got me up several mountains! Even road walking Skyline drive for an afternoon to catch some scenic overlooks and get a break from the green tunnel helped our mood to push on. If we aren’t having fun then what is the point, right? Our niece likes to remind us of a line we read in a book, “Don’t quit on a bad day!” She says quit on a good day. We just try not to think about quitting and putting one foot in front of the other. On to West Virginia next week!

Rachael and Cayde,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641111,"This past weekend we had the pleasure of visiting and recovering from eleven straight days of hiking with family in Northern Virginia. My Aunt and Uncle met us on a hot Friday afternoon in Harpers Ferry and took us to visit their sons and stay with my cousin, Justin. He joked about us being homeless squatters in his house, but we all loved it! Huge shoutout to him for going above and beyond for us! Between living in Iowa and the pandemic, I hadn’t seen my extended family in over a year and a half which is really odd for my close knit relatives. It was awesome to catch up, shoot the breeze, and share about our adventure. Several of the same questions came up, so we figured we would share the answers to those common inquiries.
What has been your favorite part so far? For me, the Grayson Highlands. It is an area in Southern Virginia with big open vistas and wild ponies running around. The morning we woke up to them galloping through our campsite is a favorite memory of mine. For Cayde, it is the Roan Highlands on the border of North Carolina and Tennessee. It is made up of big balds or treeless topped mountains that stretch on for miles. It looks as close to Scotland as I can imagine you can get in the U.S.


Are you halfway yet? Almost. Technically the halfway point is in Southern Pennsylvania. Harpers Ferry (about mile 1025 now) used to be halfway but since the trail continues to be rerouted and lengthened (2193 miles now) it is not anymore.


How are your bodies holding up? Not bad, but we have had our share of injuries. Other than looking like mummies when we first wake up due to soreness and stiffness we have had a few more specific ailments. Cayde had a shin splint that turned into a painful ankle. We believe this is either due to a change in his gait to curb the pain or a broken down shoe whose structure was failing and turning his ankle. I have had right knee pain and a high left ankle sprain that both got better with simple care and KT tape. More recently, I potentially stretched or tore my meniscus. Hence the time off in Northern Virginia and frequency of this question. Luckily, we have not had many falls like some of our friends. That is really how you get hurt with fractures and torn ligaments. 


Where do you get water? Along the trail there are marked water sources about every 3-10 miles. They are usually a stream or spring with a sign or trail guiding us to them. We scoop or funnel water into a squeeze pouch, then attach our Sawyer Squeeze water filter tube onto the pouch, and squeeze the water into a water bottle for consumption. The whole process just takes like five or so minutes depending on the amount of water we need.


How are you dealing with the heat? We have been night hiking a bit more, so we can get miles in the cooler evenings. Often we try to “camel up” at water sources which just means drinking an extra liter of water there to carry it in our stomachs instead of in our packs. A liter of water weighs about 2.2 lbs so carrying a couple of liters of water really makes a difference!  Finally, we’ve been slack packing on really hot days, taking rests in the shade preferably where we can feel a breeze, and making sure to use electrolyte packets at least once through the day. We have known others who have had to get off trail for a few days due to passing out or heat stroke, but so far so good for us.


What wildlife have you seen? Six black bear, two rattlesnakes, one copperhead (although apparently we just didn’t see two we walked past a few days ago), black snakes (daily in the Shenandoahs), gardener snakes, one gray fox, one red fox, deer and fawns, turkeys, owls, vultures, scarlet tanager, red-winged blackbird, indigo bunting, wood thrush, countless other birds, horses/ponies, cows, etc.


Have you wanted to quit? Absolutely. Whenever it rains I usually tell Cayde I’m just going to sit down under the closest tree and he can tell my parents they will find me at whatever mile mark I’m at. Also, hiking through injuries is not fun, so I usually start to question if I can really keep going. After a hot shower, warm meal, and full night of rest- clearer heads prevail.


Are you still liking it? Overall yes. It has been great to spend quality time together and learn to rely on one another. We certainly have our moments, so it is not all sunshine and roses.


Will you make it in time? Recently, we have been really nervous about being so late in the season. We are told we are probably a week or two behind the main bubble of hikers. Since we got a later start than most, have been religious about zero days, and took off for the July 4th weekend, we are not surprised. Our anxiety about timing surrounds snow in Maine and Katahdin closing for the season (typically about Oct 15). It is very likely that we will flip flop which means we will jump up to Maine to summit Katahdin and then head southbound down to wherever we got off. Of course this is all God willing as anything can take us off trail at any moment, so we will just enjoy the journey!


Feel free to text me if you have alternative questions and we would love to answer them. It’s always cool to reach reception and hear from friends and family!

Rachael and Cayde,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641883,"Currently, we are in Pennsylvania. It’s been beautiful and the weather has cooled making for some fantastic hiking days. Near the Maryland- Pennsylvania border, I tweaked my knee pretty badly. It was slow going and I certainly had some days where all I wanted to do was sit down in the middle of trail and quit. Cayde liked to point out that there was no way to go but through to the next parking lot or road crossing. Usually by the time we finally got to one of those, I would have changed my mind and blown right past it. My family also helped: taking me off trail to recover, hiking with us, and encouraging us to keep at it. For these reasons and the beautiful landscapes, my home state has clearly been my favorite so far.The cooler weather also has an ominous nature to it. As the mornings get cooler and some leaves start to change, we find ourselves freaking out about being so far behind. Really we are right on time with when we started, but the hiker crowd has really thinned out making us feel more alone. We can’t help but compare ourselves to our faster counterparts (particularly those under 28) who are already hitting New England. Dare we forget our situation for a moment and we  chat with a day hiker, who reminds us: “Are you a NOBO? Aren’t you too late for that?” Yesterday, we met our first SOBOs. That was surreal.The dilemma of being a late NOBO is the never failing question: should I flip flop? This means that rather than continuing with a traditional northern route we would jump up to Maine and head south to finish or skip up to the bubble in New Hampshire/Vermont and then jump back to finish later. This would take away the ticking time clock that is the coldest weather in the most Northern states as well as the imminent closure of Mount Katahdin. This is the northern terminus for the AT in Maine and the limiting factor for NOBOs as the mountain closes when conditions are too dangerous for hikers to keep summiting its elevation. Typically, this is around the 15th of October.
Granted we still have time. Today we will pass the 1200 mile mark which means we officially have less than 1,000 miles to go! Less to do than we’ve already done.
So to answer some of you who have been asking: yes we have considered a flip flop to finish. Probably heading to Katahdin and heading South bound from there. But as of right now, we continue to hike North and will keep you updated on our progress.

Rachael and Cayde,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642213,"We write this in the car on the way to Maine! For all the reasons we previously discussed, timing, cold weather, family, we are headed up to Monson with a small group to head into the 100-mile wilderness and summit Katahdin. We are excited to start our southbound journey back towards Rachael’s home state of Pennsylvania, but before we completely start to focus on it, we really need to take a minute to discuss the Keystone State.


Before entering the state we were inundated with trail tales of how the rocks would be unbearable, the snakes would be numerous and the heat unrelenting. I’m here to set the record straight: it’s all true and we love it. Despite the heat, the snakes, the rocks it’s got a great variety of interesting forest types, more views than the previous 500 miles of Virginia and the rocks are really pretty fun, some of the time.


Don’t get us wrong. Our feet and the shoes protecting them are battered. Sharp rocks, round rocks, rocks the size of Volkswagens, rocks that slide downhill when you step on them, all of these make up the trail in the great commonwealth of Pennsylvania, but for as many dangerous and painful stones, there are so many awe inspiring and beautiful ones.



The heat can be oppressive, but with the greater variety of scenery and greenery we’ve been at peace with it.
Snakes still bother Rachael but she knows how to safely pass them without screaming each time she encounters one.


We have had a great time in Pennsylvania. After a good bit of discussion, we have figured out that walking back south into PA is the way we want to finish this hike. We are making our way to Monson, Maine, in order to start through the Hundred Mile Wilderness and climb to the summit of Katahdin. After that, we will wheel around and make our way south over the toughest and possibly most beautiful parts of the trail: The White mountains, The Presidentials, and the extreme rocks of southern Maine. We’re looking forward to continuing our adventure in a whole new way and we’ll keep the updates coming!

Rachael and Cayde,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642246,"Tomorrow we step out on trail in Maine. We feel like little school kids nervous about the first day of a new school year. Jive Turkey, AKA, and Research all feel it, too. From the moment we got to the hostel here in Monson, we have felt uneasy like we are trying to prove ourselves as hikers. Maybe it was our car, crisp jeans, freshly showered scent, lavish resupply compared to the tattered, weathered, experience of NOBOs who actually hiked here. 


In a way we question our legitimacy as thru hikers since we were so slow we felt that we needed to flip and we didn’t start in snow and ice like the hardcore hikers we are now seeing in the bunkhouse. I’m excited to just get out there and start hiking. Something I can do rather than drive, socialize, start small talk, or pretend to be more confident and experienced than I really am. Just us in the woods- that’s how I prefer it now.


Nerves are a funny thing. They can be a good motivation or a terrible distraction. On our more difficult rock climbs in Pennsylvania, I noticed the power of nerves. I made the mistake of looking over a ledge and getting myself worked up. Slowly, I took a few breaths, pushed the danger out of my mind, sort of gave my outcome to God. I refocused on each careful step rather than the whole perilous descent and was able to make my own way. 


Katahdin is a big ball of anxiety for me. Honestly, I’m most nervous that I won’t be able to do it. Whether it is strength, fear, weather, or permits, I will just keep hiking the few feet in front of me and slowly go as far as possible. After all, the best views come after the hardest climbs. Boy should this be a good one! Can’t wait to share it.

Rachael and Cayde,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642912,"We did it! On Sunday, we conquered our fears and summitted the highest mountain in Maine which stands at over 5,000 feet, Mount Katahdin. The AT utilizes the Hunt trail to take hikers up over 4,000 feet in around 5.5 miles to reach Baxter Peak at the tip top. We headed up the trail around 7am and made it back down around 4:30pm. It was a long challenging day, but beautiful.


When we first emerged above the tree line to the harder rock bouldering, I was amazed at the dense fog. It got thicker as we climbed, but I was thankful for the “blinders” as I focused on hand holds and footing to hoist myself up one motion at a time. At the top, we were a little disappointed that we couldn’t appreciate the view. While we sat eating lunch and rehydrating, the sun started to burn off the clouds and blue skies peaked through. We quickly got pictures by the legendary sign. Once the clouds dissipated, we decided to start making our way back down the mountain.


I like climbing uphill. Call me crazy, but I prefer the control, slight burn in your legs, and feeling of accomplishment as I hike up to a summit. It was technical and more than once we had to reassess our path to make sure we were still on the trail or choosing the best ascent without climbing ourselves into corners. Thank God it was so foggy. Had I been able to see our destination, I think I would have felt much more overwhelmed and intimidated by our goal. When coming down in clearer conditions, I took my time, scooted on my butt, enjoyed the sights, and reminded myself that I could do it because I already had!


Overall, Katahdin was a rush and great lesson for us! We worked together as partners and helped each other throughout the journey. Next, we are headed back to Monson below the 100 Mile Wilderness. We will make our way South from Maine back to the Pennsylvania border. Wish us luck in the Whites!

Rachael and Cayde,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643945,"We last wrote that we were going back to Monson to head south. Not how it really worked out. Last minute, we decided to go visit family. I hadn’t seen my brother in over two and a half years (thanks to COVID) and missed my nieces and nephew! After that, we went with Cayde’s parents to Vermont who generously slackpacked us in that area while they vacationed and let us heal up before returning us to trail in Monson. They even brought our dog, Marion, to see us!


Also, we discovered an awesome place called Moosehead Lake in Greenville, Maine. Before taking us to trail, we went on a boat ride on the converted steamship Katahdin, explored three museums including a Lumberman talk, and watched lots of planes arriving for the International Seaplane Fly-In held this weekend. Greenville and Rockwood on Moosehead are my favorite trail adjacent communities we have seen yet. Also, shout out to Her Dudeness who gave us free peanut butter pie as trail magic when she waited on us for dinner. We love paying the karma forward in the hiking community!


Now, we are back in the woods. We miss our dog and family but still love the Maine wilderness. It is unique with so many water features, beautiful vistas, undeveloped landscapes, and moose watching around every corner!


We march on. Although we have one more side trip as we head to Cabo to join family next week. We feel pretty silly taking a vacation from our vacation but couldn’t miss the opportunity while we had the time!

Rachael and Cayde,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644326,"Dedicated to our friends and family who wonder whatever do we do all day long. 


Note: This is just an example day out in the woods- not every day.


6:30am- Wake up
6:35am- Stretch out in our tent while poking Cayde incessantly to wake him up. Usually meditate on nature sounds and thank God for still being alive in the woods.
6:45am- Dress, roll up sleeping pad/pillow, and pack clothes.
7:00am- Collect all parts of my gear and pack the bottom half of my pack up to the food bag layer.
7:05am- Explain to Cayde the subtle difference between “up” and “awake”.
7:10am- Bathroom break. I did figure out recently that if I shake my water bottle at Cayde he usually has to pee sooner and will hurry up!
7:15am- Find and drop the bear hang. (We hang our food and smellables every night. Cayde kindly does this, so I just have to get it down in the morning. He does the hard part.) Cayde researches weather, water sources, and AT map.
7:25am- Start breakfast. Recently, it has been a slurry of water, Nido milk powder, chia seeds, freeze dried strawberries, granola or cereal, and pecans. Sometimes a coffee packet added to a bottle of cold water depending on how groggy we feel.
7:35am- Cayde comes to filter water for me.
7:40am- Eat breakfast and discuss day. Typically, we want to leave by 8am sharp. We usually just plan to hike as far as we can which depends on the terrain. Sometimes we set a mileage goal with an end location and also a farther stretch goal. We try to hike 15-20 miles a day but way less in the north.
7:50am- Bathroom break #2. I mean #2. I am happy to report that I am very regular.
7:55am- Cayde unstakes, disassembles, and rolls up the tent.
8:00am- I am ready to go with my bag packed, shoes tied, and trekking poles in hand.
8:05am- Cayde is ready to hike.
8:06am- Start hiking. Cayde sings “on the road again.”
8:08am- One of us (usually me) is already too hot to be wearing our long sleeve shirt or jacket so we have to stop to take it off and pack it.
10:30am- Collect water from a stream/spring, filter water into a bottle, and eat a snack. Talk to other hikers that pass by which has exponentially increased since we are now heading southbound through the main bubble of hikers!
12:00pm- Snack while standing. Make a plan for where to eat lunch since we like to sit at scenic overlooks or shelter picnic tables.
1:00pm- Eat lunch consisting of foil packet of tuna/meat on a tortillas, pb&j tortillas, and cheezits or crackers. Find and filter more water.
2:05pm- Finally stand up to realize we took too long of a break and I now need to stretch to remain upright and mobile. Hiker hobbles are real.
3:15pm or so- More water.
4:00pm- Jolly rancher time! Or Jelly Belly makes these sport beans with caffeine and electrolytes! Cayde usually knows when to deploy this technique by my mood. If I am threatening to quit, it’s a two jolly rancher day.
6:00pm- Start looking for a tent site to make camp or arrive at goal location. (In the height of summer, we usually didn’t do this until 8pm or so. Now, sun is down and it gets chilly by 7pm.) Look for the flattest possible real estate to erect our house. In the north there has been way less hikers so we usually get our first choice location. 
6:05pm- Setup tent, stake corners and guy wires if rain forecasted, unpack the majority of our pack contents onto the tent floor, grab a jacket for post hike chill, and collect water for dinner & breakfast.
6:20pm- Lay in the tent reading, stretching, and recovering. Blow up our sleeping pad and pillow. Peel off our socks and inspect our feet. Sometimes tick check or ask each other about weird ailments we are experiencing. I put on my compression socks that I will sleep in (favorite part of my day)!
7:00pm- Pull out our food bags to cook dinner while Cayde does the bear line magic.
7:20pm- Eat dinner. Sometimes around other hikers staying at the same campsite. Usually food is ramen, instant potatoes, mac ‘n cheese, dehydrated soup, or a backpacker meal.
7:50pm- Swish out bowls, wipe down pots, and brush teeth. All water from these activities is thrown/spat into the woods away from camp and water sources.
8:00pm- Lay down in tent. Read on phone if cell reception or just look at map. Record mileage for the day.
8:30pm- Share our rose, bud, thorn. (Reflection on our favorite part of the day, worst part, and something we are looking forward to. We do this every night and sometimes make those sleeping around us join in.)
8:31pm- I am out cold and Cayde reads on his phone for a bit longer. 
2:23am- Sometimes I wake up unable to stay asleep and blog or journal on my phone. This is what time I’m writing this exact post! If I hear animal noises, I make Cayde wake up to tell me they are nothing or poke his head out of the tent with a flashlight. Eventually, we both fall back to sleep.


-Repeat daily for 6 months-


Granted there are some days Cayde is more willing to wake up or we spend some zero days in town. Overall, this is a pretty accurate schedule for the average day out here. Hope this helps explain what we are up to!


Update: We finished over 100 miles of hiking in 9 days since Monson. The Bigelows, Horn, and Crocker Mountains were challenging but rewarding. Saddleback Ridge was a highlight and possibly one of our favorite Maine hikes so far! Now we are off trail for a bit to visit family and join them on vacation. Look for more updates at the beginning of October!

Rachael and Cayde,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644913,"We made it back to Maine! To leave trail, it took us just about every form of transportation and to get back on we had a very good friend drive us 6.5 hours. Thanks again, Marilyn! Also, shout out to Steve who shuttled us to Portland and Meganne who let us use her cabin in Rangeley!


Once back, it has taken us some time to settle into a rhythm and strengthen our trail legs. The leaves are noticeably more colorful and the nights far colder (especially at high altitudes). We were a bit worried that no one would still be out hiking and one of the joys of this journey has been the characters we meet. No fear- there are still section hikers and even a couple NOBOs straggling thru. Those folks heading North at this time won’t make it before Katahdin closes, but will flip up there right before the end of the season then finish their hikes south. We have known several of these hikers and feel confident we made the right choice to flip when we did.


Now we are getting into the more difficult Southern Maine hiking (or should we say climbing) and preparing for the Presidentials and Whites in New Hampshire. It is crucial that we have several good weather days in a row to make it through those high altitude and fully exposed summits. Last week, we got messages from friends who had to wait days for poor weather to pass to avoid getting blown off ridges or slip on wet rocks.


For now, we just hike on. Reminding ourselves that each day is a few more miles we didn’t have under our feet before. Hoping we finish by Thanksgiving!

Rachael and Cayde,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645073,"It is about midnight and here I am up writing again. Part of it is that we go to bed so early and then I wake myself up a few hours later. But tonight I’m here laughing at myself, so I had to share.


We have yet to see a moose in Maine. Luckily, we got a glimpse of one in Vermont but we always thought we’d get more of an encounter here. Lately, there have been a lot of large moose tracks in the mud and moose pellets (poop) in piles along the trail. It has had my moose radar on high alert.


Imagine me walking through the woods when I think I hear something. My closed fist goes up and I silently motion to Cayde to look out. He knows this means I will be on an intense moose watch for the next hour. Trying to stealth hike through the leaves and shushing him along the way. Like an intense army commander giving sign language to my troops and taking the whole thing way too seriously. This happens more times in a day than I’ll ever admit.


Tonight, I swear I heard a moose. I woke to a rustle in the leaves and then a series of low snorts. I immediately imagined a fully grown bull moose at the base of our tent. Our sleeping pads have a weird low plastic sound when we move. I flipped over to better listen and my mat rumbled. I froze. Then the low snorts responded. I was about to shake Cayde awake to look outside our tent together! That is until a robust nasal snore replaced the snorts. I then realized that our campsite neighbor was thunderously snoring. It was not a moose at all but a loud stuffy old guy. I had to stifle my guttural laughs as to not wake everyone.


My search continues. We are about 8 miles from the New Hampshire border, so my quest for a moose in Maine is dwindling but not yet dead.

Rachael and Cayde,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645187,"“This is not hiking. This is rock climbing.”-Radar


Mahoosuc Notch is a series of boulder scrambles through a skinny valley between two large mountains in southern Maine. Hikers go up, over, around and through chunks of rock the size of SUVs. 


Our experience with the Notch was probably pretty typical given what it is. The first third was kind of fun. The second third was very tiring. The last third was an existential crisis. You have to imagine walking along and seeing what appears to be an impassable wall of rocks. There is a perfectly painted white blaze right in the middle of it. No indication on which way to tackle it. Just get to the other side. Usually by stretching, squeezing, and nearly dislocating parts of your body. Now imagine that this happens 25 times. Overall, we took our packs off 5 times throughout this 3/4 of a mile section. It took us over two hours to complete it. Lucky for us we had started first thing in the morning, so we had plenty of time to climb four mountains including the Goose Eyes immediately after. We were really exhausted at the end of the day but felt accomplished. 


Southern Maine overall probably has some of the most difficult hiking on the trail. Known for relentless rock scrambles and near vertical exposed stone paths. It is tough on our joints but we have enjoyed it most of the time. As we continue south we know that there isn’t going to be much this difficult between us and our goal.

","Mahoosuc Notch, ME","Oct 11, Mon",0
Rachael and Cayde,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645188,"It is with a heavy heart that we’ve decided to skip the White Mountains. This is an area in northern New Hampshire known for some of the best views on trail and hardest hiking. We have been looking forward to the Presidentials and Franconia Notch since we started researching the trail. However, this area is also known for some of the worst weather and highest recorded winds in the world.


We did not arrive at this decision lightly. Arriving so late in the season we knew would be challenging. There is a system of huts here that support hikers with a dry place to sleep and dinner/breakfast. These are maintained by hosts that do not stay year round. Several of these shelters are already closed and others expect to shortly. This would mean that if we ran into problems there would be considerably less help around. Also, each night we would have to hike several extra miles down below the alpine zones to get tree cover and flat spots to erect our tent. 


Finally, weather is highly variable in this area. We’ve heard that for every thousand feet of elevation you should anticipate at least a five degree drop plus windchill. Mt. Washington sits at over 6,000 feet with some of the highest recorded wind speeds ever. The forecast as we considered how to proceed had one good day of weather followed by four to five days of rain. Precipitation mixed with high elevation at a rocky terrain can be perilous here. In order to be best prepared, we would really need to have heavier winter gear with us- Microspikes, 0 degree sleeping bags, base layers, etc. We probably would be fine, but really didn’t want to risk it. We decided to skip these 100 miles with hopes of returning.


Up to this point we have not left any section undone on our hike. Sometimes we will skip ahead and return to finish an area in better conditions, but at this time we do not have any holes in our route. This means that even with a 100 mile skip for the White Mountains we are still planning to walk over 2,000 miles of the AT this year. That is the required amount to be considered a thru hiker for both the ATC (Appalachian Trail Conservancy) and ALDHA (Appalachian Long Distance Hiker Association). We hope to return next August for a week and a half to complete the Whites as our final section of the AT.


Sorry if that is a long-winded explanation of our decision. I think I am still trying to convince myself that it is for the best. There is a saying on trail: Hike your own hike (HYOH). We’ve been happy to see family and friends so much during our time on trail. We really wouldn’t change anything as we’ve gotten to experience some truly remarkable unique seasons and events. Trillium and spring wildflowers in Georgia, active wildlife for early summer in Tennessee and North Carolina, naked hiker day in Virginia, dry sunny weather full of snakes in Pennsylvania, beautiful late summer in Maine, and now fall foliage in New England! Ultimately, we feel like we have done it our way and that is comfort in itself. 


Now, we are hiking south from the Glencliff, NH area. We should be to Hanover in a few days and are looking forward to seeing Dartmouth from trail as the AT follows the sidewalks right through town!

Rachael and Cayde,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645756,"We’re less than 200 miles from the end of the road now. Things have changed so much as we close in on our big finish for the year. A once mighty flood of hikers has slowed to a trickle. It’s lonely, but super unique. Coming down through Vermont and Massachusetts we have often been the only hikers staying at hostels and at shelters, it’s like we’re seeing the hibernation cycle of trail culture. The uniqueness extends to the character of trail itself. The changing fall leaves offer gorgeous scenery and a new challenge, in the form of fallen leaf piles and errant acorns underfoot. 
We’ve been falling more than ever but there are friends and family nearby to pick us up and set us right again. We should especially thank hiking heroes “Brownie” and “Pockets”: Hikers we originally met in Virginia who have opened their homes to us as we’ve made our way down the final stretch. The food, showers, beds and rides provided have been invaluable to our continued success on trail. Our parents have also continued to support us in more ways than we could ever hope to describe! 
Even into November the trail offers surprises and adventures. Inn at the Long trail was definitely a highlight for us. Radar studied in Ireland back in school and she swears that McGrath’s Irish Pub at the Inn offers some of the most authentic food and finest Guinness pours this side of the Atlantic. After sampling several pours, I tend to agree. Birds of prey, chipmunks, squirrels and deer all going about their autumn routines keep us on our toes. Fantastic views from places like Mt.Race Ledges and Mt. Caleb keep us powering up the tough climbs in every state. 
Speaking of States we only have two left! New York and New Jersey are the only things keeping us from a “New” normal of our own. Not that we are so ready to be done hiking, but we have seen some very cold temperatures in these shorter days. After a night that dipped down to 21 degrees, we made an important discovery. You would think it was warmer to sleep in a shelter with walls, but it turns out our trusty tent is far better for staying toasty. We traded in our lighter insect-proof sleeping bag liners for thicker insulated liners. And between those improvements and a little luck we should be able to fight off the chill until we finish. 
All we seem to talk about these days is the next step in our lives. We’ve got AT to come back to in the form of the Whites, but each step south now takes us to an uncertain future. For more than 7 months, hiking the AT has been everything for us. The transition is sure to be sharp. We’re trying to stay focused on the next few rocks, trees, and streams ahead of us, but as there is less and less wilderness to pass through, our thoughts turn more and more to after the hike. All the two of us can say for sure is that we are thankful to have had this opportunity and we’ll be happy to share our final thoughts not too long from today!

Few things in life are as nerve wracking as walking up to a shelter during the off season on the AT- especially in New York. For reference, we are around Fishkill, NY about 60 miles from NYC or a 45 minute train ride. We have had the pleasure of running into some interesting characters in our current section of trail. 


Last Wednesday was a doozy. We got to a campsite along the Housatonic River right at dusk. Immediately we started exploring the area to get our bearings and find the flattest spot that maintained my multi point inspection for our tent. We had assumed we were alone since we only saw about two day hikers the entire day. While we started to setup camp, something blue next to a tree moved. I tried to focus in the waning light when a faint voice came from behind the tree. The shadow slid back behind the wide trunk. I quickly turned to Research and said, “Did you see that? Is that a kid?” The figure slowly peeked from around the tree again and it appeared to be just a few feet tall. Then Research yelled, “Hello?!” A guy peered out and mumbled something. Research walked over and asked, “What’s that?” I instantly got a bad feeling and remained where I was about 15 feet away. The guy stood up and was much larger than I originally thought since he was just sitting before. I stiffened as he was taller than my husband when he rose to his feet. They had a quick conversation that I couldn’t understand from my held position. I’m told he asked if we were hikers and where we were staying for the night. He said he had been having car trouble and had all of his stuff at the shelter .2 miles down trail as he had been living there for a few nights. Research said we would be staying at the campsite and returned to me. We walked to the farthest corner of the campsite and started setting up our tent. After a couple minutes, the guy walked away and into the direction of the shelter. I continued to get the feeling that he was watching us though and started to freak out. We have had some odd interactions on trail but none have left me so viscerally upset. Ultimately, Cayde and I decided to backtrack a mile and a half and call our trail friend Pockets who came to our rescue. I think it was such an unsettling experience because we could clearly tell something was off with the gentleman and we know that people are very few and far between out on trail right now. It made me feel uncomfortably vulnerable.


In contrast, this past Saturday we had the pleasure of sharing a shelter area with a whole Boy Scout troop. It was raining cats and dogs all afternoon as we hurried to the closest shelter for cover. As we ran up, we noticed lots and lots of tents setup around the shelter area. When we got to the small shelter structure there was hardly a few feet of empty space under the roof line as it was filled by adults, a couple scouts, and a large pile of dry firewood. The folks made some room for us to sit and started chatting with us. They had 16 boys out for an overnight backpacking outing. We checked the weather and decided that since the rain wasn’t going to stop for several more hours and the temperature was forecasted to plummet we ought to quit for the day and make camp too. Although the teenage Boy Scouts were pretty loud and ruckus when the rain cleared and dinner food came out, we were thankful for a night surrounded by other folks and figured at least the critters wouldn’t be around that night.


Hiking so late in the season when others are not out, bears are stocking up for winter and daylight is shorter supply has really affected the mood of trail. It feels so different from the long social hiking days we had in Virginia. We just try to be careful, erring on the side of safety, and honestly I pray a bit more. Tonight we lucked out with a friendly retired couple from Mississippi who setup their tent in the shelter, too. Just about a week left to go for us. Feeling ready to be finished with some aspects of trail.

Rachael and Cayde,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645837,"Today is our penultimate day of hiking- second to last! And we have an ambitious 23 miles planned. We are pulling out all the stops when it comes to tips and tricks to make ourselves hike. This is our ninth day of hiking in a row and we are sure starting to feel it. The hiker hobbles are real! What possible motivation could make a human hike this much you may ask? Hot food! 


Research figured out that this is one of my biggest motivations. We were camping about 4 miles from a deli known for great breakfast sandwiches on trail. We both got up and power hiked before sunrise just so we could go get one. The next day the trail crossed right in front of another sandwich shop in a gas station. We hiked hard for 14 miles to enjoy one for dinner and then went the subsequent 4 miles on a full stomach to a shelter. 


We call this deli blazing! The trail is marked with white blazes or stripes on trees to help you know where to go. Through New Jersey to Massachusetts there are so many delis not far from trail that hikers make a point to hit up each one on their way. It is one of my favorite trail traditions so far! My favorite has been Tony’s Deli in NY just off Rte 22 near Pawling. He even lets hikers camp in his backyard for $2.

These last few days my parents generously came up to NY/NJ to slackpack us to the finish line. We are trying to beat forecasted snow! They too have realized how fast we hike with a good warm meal in our sights. Yesterday we did 8.5 miles in under three hours just to get out of the cold and to a restaurant.

Thanksgiving is on our minds and when there is a lull in conversation we often find ourselves daydreaming of turkey with all the trimmings and homemade pie! Today we hope our drive for hot food and being so close to complete will carry us through quickly and safely!

Rachael and Cayde,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645847,"Well we did it! Yesterday afternoon we hiked across the busy I-80 bridge straddling the Delaware River, over the New Jersey/Pennsylvania border, through the welcoming town of Delaware Water Gap, and up to the Lake Lenape trailhead to officially complete our 2021 Flip Flop Thru Hike. We can now say with confidence that we are AT thru hikers and apply for our 2,000 miler certificates. 


Family met us in the last mile of trail and paraded us to the finish line. Our nieces and nephews made signs, rattled noise makers, and cheered us on. My brother-in-law, who is a great cook, made cookies decorated like tents, AT symbols, and white blazes. My sister, our keeper of our mileage and statistics, surprised us with a book of our blogs, photos, and stats. She officially calculated our mileage at 2,125 miles although I’m sure there are some blue blazes we didn’t get included or walks to towns for resupply. The AT is officially 2,193 miles long but even without the Whites we still did well over 2100. Surrounded by some of the folks who helped to keep us hiking, we happily scarfed down delicious treats and dined on local barbecue for dessert. 


It felt great to be surrounded by family and stay distracted as we drove away from the woods. We are having a range of emotions surrounding leaving our forested home but also happy to start our next chapter. I’m sure it won’t be long until we return to nature but just for an afternoon escape or so. Hot showers, clean sheets, and cheesy pizza are much too tempting for me.

Also, to all of our family, friends, and readers- thank you for your support, well wishes, and prayers! 
Finally, to our fellow hikers. Thank you for the positive community created through our mutual appreciation of nature, deep conversations, and pay it forward attitudes. From a jar of peanut butter here to a partial fuel canister there, even small gestures can make the trail provide to others in big ways. 
Feeling an outpouring of encouragement from strangers and friends both on trail and virtually has meant more to us than we can ever express.","

Rachael and Cayde,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646143,"While on trail, we often discussed our LAT (Life After Trail). Those plans ranged from just wanting a nap to wild business plans we thought up in detail to pass our time. It’s now been one month since we finished trail life and honestly it has been a mix of those things expected and those not.  But here are some of my thoughts on our transition so far.


Admittedly, the big things are much the same. It helps that holiday traditions have helped to lay a familiar backtrack to our return. COVID is still at large. The news is still bleak. Caffeine is a must. Don’t know what we want to do when we grow up. We get by with a little help from puppy cuddles. I knew that we wouldn’t have everything figured out when we got done, but I really hoped for a bit more direction. Mostly, I think the hike gave us time to reflect on what hasn’t worked for us and a framework of how we hope our lives might in the future. The details are still buffering. 


Right now, we are staying with family in Pittsburgh and jumping into the gig economy- delivering for Uber Eats, painting an Aunt’s house, etc. We want to live near family or friends and right now everyone knows somewhere that is hiring or has some suggestion for us. It can be overwhelming. We are flattered that so many people want to help us get back to work. It is just taking us time to better understand what and where that may be.


At first, grocery stores, crowds, costs of living, and common things were really overwhelming. It has taken us time to slow down our hiker hunger, join in at social gatherings, and understand everyday pricing. We certainly miss the trail- fresh air, calming woods, consistent exercise, simplicity of living, hiker community, experiencing new places, controlled cellular usage, and constant travel. It has been a rollercoaster of good days and rougher ones to find a rhythm of normalcy in society again. 


Slowly, we are finding our way. I remember one of my very first days on trail we ran into a volunteer trail maintainer in Georgia. He gave us a scouts report on the upcoming water sources and trail conditions to expect. We nodded and tried to act like we knew what we were doing. Mostly to convince ourselves more than anything. Before he left, he told me that my load lifter straps on my pack weren’t correct and helped me fix them. Instantly, I felt like we had been made- our cover was blown. We were not experienced backpackers who understood even our gear, let alone the importance of detailed water reports. But every morning we got up to hike for the next seven months, you better believe my load lifters were cinched up correctly. In time we became seasoned hikers with every step. It’s all about the habits we choose to follow. We will find our place in the world again and learn to carry our weight in it.
