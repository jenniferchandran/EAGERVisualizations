Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635082,"I am finishing packing for my AT thru-hike. I think I have everything, but I won't truly know until I hit the trail. Some thoughts:The airline is charging me for a 50-pound checked bag, so I'm taking my first five days of food with me. It's 2,700 to 2,800 calories per day. I think it will be enough.My plan is to try to hike 5 days between resupply points and take a zero/nero every resupply.The first few days may be lower mileage while I get my trail legs, but ultimately I would like to average about 25 miles per day. With the zero/nero days, my trip average should be about 20 miles per day.I am sick of packing out toilet paper on the trail, so I'm going to try a trail bidet. I've heard good things, but I have zero experience using one.I was hoping to be rid of a nagging groin injury, but it persists. Who knows how problematic that could be, but I'm taking a brace, just in case. I should be able to ditch it after a week or two.",,View Entry,"Apr 18, Sun",0
Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635216,"This is my last night sleeping in my ""city bed"". I have spent most of today going through my equipment for the 10th or 15th time. My clothes and tent are all treated withÂ permethrin (insect repellent), which I've only ever done for Agogee (Vermont in June). I've read that many AT hikers do it and I already had a bottle on hand, so I might as well. Tonight, I said TTFN to my daughter. It was tough and I know I will miss her terribly. I've already been through some of that in my OT hikes (up to 9 days), but 4-5 months is something else entirely. The rest of tonight will be spent stuffing everything in my pack and doing some house cleaning.My flight leaves early tomorrow morning. I have a shuttle scheduled to pick me up from the Atlanta airport and bring me a fuel canister. Then, it will be off to Amicalola Falls State Park, where I have a room for the night at the lodge. I will wake up on Thursday morning, grab some breakfast, register my hike, and begin the 8.5 mile approach trail. I'm anxious, but excited to finally get started!",,View Entry,"Apr 20, Tue",0
Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635262,"The first step of any journey is always the hardest and that first step for me was simply leaving the comforts of home, knowing what likely lies ahead.The flight to Atlanta was uneventful, but my shuttle was 30 minutes late because he had to do an emergency pick-up for a hiker in trouble. I couldn't check in at the lodge until 4pm anyway, so waiting at the airport or at the lodge didn't make much difference to me.My equipment made it without issue, though the IKEA bag had a big rip in it. Better that bag than my backpack! I checked in to the lodge at 4 and found out that hiker registration at the visitors center was open until 5. I went up to my room, threw on my pack, and beat feet down there. I arrived about 10 minutes before they closed, signed the book, weighed my pack, and took a photo at the approach trail arch.Getting back up to the lodge wasn't fun as the trail is pretty steep and my adductor is already complaining. Time to have a good meal and get some rest before hitting trail early in the morning.",,View Entry,"Apr 21, Wed",0
Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635374,"The low was 27 degrees this morning and I think it was 30 degrees when I hit the trail at 7am. I decided to wear my tights, which kept me nice and warm throughout the day. They also created some chaffing. I won't go into detail, but suffice to say I won't be wearing them tomorrow! On the approach trail, I actually saw ice crystals where water had seeped out of the ground. It was a weird site to see in Georgia toward the end of April.
I saw a number of people on the trail and they were from all walks of life. The first one I talked to was a ""local ridge runner"". I haven't researched it, but I guess she monitors the trail. She had a name tag and was the only person all day wearing a mask. Most everyone was very friendly, with only one or two grumpy guys this morning. Maybe they were still waking up.
Nothing to report, really. I feel good. Of course, my feet and legs hurt a little. That happens when you stomp 25 miles through the mountains. My adductor muscle is holding up okay and I plan to keep wearing the brace for a while.
I am camped next to a road. Not ideal, but the site is spacious and a short trip from a water source. Only 1.2 miles back is a shelter, but I am not keen on staying in shelters here unless there is rain. The forecast is clear, so I am outside.","Amicalola Falls State Park

Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635448,"Last night was terrible. I don't think I slept more than 1-2 hours at a time. There were some car campers who set up after I was already in my tent. They made a ton of noise and played the worst music until 1am. I tossed and turned a lot as well.
7200 feet of elevation gain in one day is a lot, and probably more so on the 2nd day of hiking. That is roughly 700 feet more than yesterday. I probably won't do that again. I think capping daily elevation gain at 6000-6200 feet is a good idea.
I made it to Neel Gap around 1230 for lunch. There were a ton of people there, hiker, bikers, and everything in between. I picked up some snacks and had a great lunch.
Tonight, I am staying in my tent, but close to a shelter and a water source. There are 7 other hikers in tents and a couple in the shelter. I have talked with most of them and they are very friendly. The majority are younger with one being a retired LEO.
Tomorrow morning, it is supposed to rain before daylight and throughout the day. I probably won't do many miles.","MM 17.0

Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635505,"I didn't sleep well last night...again. Maybe it was due to my tent being pitched on a slope. Maybe it was my aches and pains. Maybe it was the very certain forecast of rain today.It was to begin raining shortly before sunrise. I was basically waiting for it. Packing in the rain is miserable and carrying around heavy, stinky, wet equipment isn't fun either. I woke up at 4am and started charging my devices. At 4:30, the first drops of rain hit my tent. I quickly packed my stuff, ate breakfast, and hit the trail by 5:30. I managed to keep most of my equipment dry and felt good about the day.My enthusiasm didn't last. I eventually became completely soaked, temps were probably in the low 50's, and the wind was whipping around. It was especially bad on the tops of mountains (of which there were many).I saw MANY hikers still in their tents, even after noon. I really don't blame them. I stopped at Tray Mountain Shelter around 11am to have some lunch. It was freezing up there and the shelter was PACKED. People were inside, outside, and camped all around it. They had a regular community of miserable souls. I quickly got off the mountain and made for the next shelter (Deep Gap, my home for the night).The entire 7.8 miles to Deep Gap, I was thinking about how cold and awful it was. I was thinking about most people would flock to the closest shelter. I was wondering if there would be any room for me. Well, it worked out. There was a nice woman at the shelter when I arrived, but she was packing her stuff to leave for the nearby hostel. I have the place to myself!Hoping for a good night of sleep and an available bunk at the hostel for my nero tomorrow.","Low Gap

I arrived at the hostel around 9:30 and there was only one other person here. I hung around and they shuttled me to town for free to buy groceries. I was able to find nearly everything I have been eating and bought some different food for dinner.I also took a shower, shaved, and did laundry. I think I am ready for the next 100 miles, which will put me at Fontana Dam for the next resupply. I will stop at the NOC like I did at Neel's Gap, but probably won't resupply. I would rather travel light when I can and only stop when necessary.","

It was...a lot.Last night, I slept okay, but not nearly as well as I'd hoped. For some reason, I am waking up every 1-2 hours. At 7am, I was on trail and putting in some miles. I saw several people, but fewer than previous days. I am camped by a shelter with at least a dozen other people. I rolled in at 5:30, which apparently is late because everyone was already set up.

Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635827,"It was a hot day without much shade, which seemed to sap my energy. I started pretty strong and made it up a monster climb in the early morning , but by mid afternoon I was ready for the day to be over.
Making matters worse, when I arrived at camp, it was buggy. It was also in some trees, which blocked nearly all of the breeze. I took care of camp chores and was in bed by 7:30pm. I didn't notice my hands and neck was sunburned until I went to wash up. I guess I should start wearing my buff and wetting it down at the streams, like I have been doing with my hat.
I should also mention that I am changing my trail name from Drax to Fox. I have actually been going by Fox for a few days now. My first day on trail, I was waiting for a couple of young ladies to complete a simple water crossing. They were obviously new to such things. After some time, they made it successfully. I followed by bouncing across the rocks and logs, which apparently was quite the show. One said, ""Wow! You went across that like a fox!"" So, Fox it is.","Carter Gap

This is the second time I've done it and I'm growing quite fond of the super early start.The terrain today was relatively easy, with just a couple of ascents and a bunch of descents. I was trying to make it in to the NOC as early as possible to snag a room for the night, do laundry, take a shower, shave, and generally reset for the next stretch of trail. This may be the last time I get to do it for several days.Everything worked out very well, though the outfitter didn't have a single thing I was looking for and the food resupply was somewhat lacking.

The floor is visibly bowed and you can see sunlight through holes in the roof. Morale in camp is Hugh and the people are nice, but I have little hope of actually staying dry.","

The leak I had to deal with was a single drip, about 6 inches from my sleeping bag. I woke up because the splash was hitting me in the face. Luckily, I caught it early and was able to throw my rain jacket over my sleeping bag before it got too wet. My shelter mates were not so fortunate.I left out of camp by headlamp at 5:30 and the rain had stopped. I hiked into Fontana Marina for another day of food supply so I can hike straight through the Smokies without resupplying.Tonight, I think I am technically in Tennessee.

It ended up being around 2pm. Being Saturday, there were a TON of people. A road goes up to the area and there is a parking lot, gift shop. Tourists were being pretty rude and self-absorbed. I took a couple of pictures and headed to the shelter.The terrain to Clingman's was tough and it continued to the shelter. I was pretty miserable by the time I arrived around 4pm. I quickly set up camp, washed, ate, and went to bed. At least 10 additional people showed up close to dark. There must have been at least 30 of us.","Russell Field Shelter

There is a good chance it will rain tonight and it will definitely rain tomorrow.Everything worked out. I made it to the shelter at 2pm and snagged a good spot. The shelter is pretty much full and there a few people in tents. I have a feeling it will be a race to the hostel, tomorrow.There were a ton of amazing views, today! Much of the trail was along the top of the ridges. I took a couple of pics, but was mostly focused on the trail. Most of it was rocky and/or roots.

I made good time and arrived around 12:15 to something out of a movie. The place looked older than the mountain itself and everything was run down. At least it was cheap and convenient.

I had to shed my rain jacket because the constant climbs were making me pour sweat. I passed a FAA instrument station on my way to Max Patch, a huge bald known for being a great place to catch a sunrise or sunset. That is when the storm moved in. Most of the rest of the day was wet, windy, and cold. The trail became extremely muddy and I was sliding all over the place. One time I was sliding on one foot (recovered) and another I completely bit it and covered half of me in mud.I was only going to do 20 miles today, but the shelter was full when I arrived at 1:30pm, so it was another 10 miles to the next shelter.

It is a nice little town and the AT passes directly through it. I stopped at a gas station and bought an apple danish to celebrate my first 30-mile day. It was pre-packaged, but 500 calories of deliciousness.Â The rest of the day was mostly uphill. None of it was especially steep or technical, but it went on forever. Oh, and it decided to rain around noon. It wasn't as bad as yesterday, but enough to make the trail challenging in spots. As I was concentrating on my foot placement, I heard someone yell ""Copperhead!"". I stopped in my tracks and saw an adolescent copperhead snake about 10 feet in front of me. A day hiker had seen it and was stopped. I grabbed a long branch and flung the snake far off the side of the trail. I was a little slower the rest of the day as I was scanning up and down trail.I made it to the shelter at 4pm and snagged the very last spot inside.

At the conclusion of trail days, the bubble will be back on trail, so it's better to avoid that mess.
Today, I barely saw anyone on trail. Just a couple of section hikers in the morning and 5-6 hikers after I made it to camp.

After less than an hour on trail, I ran into Sweetwater, Luna, and Gang Signs. They told me last night they planned to go past my camp another 5 miles. They didn't make it far. I'm sure I will see them again tomorrow.
The terrain was very flat today. I hiked through a pasture and it was very scenic. It was a very short 11 miles to Bear Garden Hostel and I arrived around 10:45. As I write this just before 5pm, I am the only hiker. The owner says at least six more called and are on the way. It seems most people wake up late and hike late. I think I'll keep with my early schedule.
My laundry is done, I've showered, and all of my devices are charged. I have also eaten two meals already and plan to eat again before bed. I am doing my best to load up on calories and I think it is working. I have gained close to two pounds since arriving in Damascus.I also picked up my first resupply box (thanks, Lauren!). That allows me to swap out for some slightly lighter gear (gloves, towel), restock pills (vitamins, pro-biotic, ibuprofen, Benedryl), and enjoy a couple of hard-to-find food items.
The next 6-7 days are going to be rough. The terrain should be reasonable, but resupply and recharge options close to trail aren't plentiful. I know I can always shuttle off-trail, but I've been trying to keep everything within a couple of miles from trail.Â ","Mile 547.4

I picked up another pair of Altra Olympus 4's. They have been great shoes and lasted nearly 500 miles. I also picked up a waterproof dry bag to replace my Ursak Allmitey. It is too heavy, too bulky, absorbs water, and takes too long to dry out.

I noticed there was a burger shop 0.5 miles down the road as well, so that had me motivated.I made it to the state park, but the office was closed. They wanted people to drop their money in an envelope. A Campsite without electricity or anything was $25! No way. I called the burger shop that was supposed to close at 9pm. They were closing at 7pm instead and it was 5:45 at that time, so I booked it down the road. The burger was great. The fries and milkshake...meh.I walked back to the Park drinking my milkshake and felt right as rain. A bunch of hikers were hanging out at a couple of picnic tables. We decided to push on ~2 miles to the next shelter.This is the nicest shelter I have ever seen. There are flowers, decorations, picnic tables, and wooden tent platforms. There is artwork and an air freshener in the privy! And wood paneling! Ridiculous.It was a heck of a day. I am exhausted. 35.0 miles is my new best and I never want to do it again, but I regret nothing.","Pogo Memorial Campsite

It rained last night and early this morning, so I had to pack up my tent soaking wet. It did cool the temperature, though.The terrain was some of the easiest I've encountered. Much of it was rolling and free of rocks or roots. There were a couple of parts with medium-sized rocks, perfect for hopping across. I was headed to Ironmasters Mansion, which is next to Pine Grove Furnace General Store, home of the half-gallon challenge. I made it there at 11:30am. Finishing 17.3 miles in 5 hours 40 minutes is right at 3 mph - not bad!The half-gallon challenge exists because the store is just past the halfway point of the AT. Eat a half gallon of ice cream and you get a little wooden spoon, stamped with ""Half Gallon Club"". I'm not sure if it's part of the challenge, but I aimed for less than a half hour and made it in 28 minutes. I was talking to some other hikers who were eating burgers made at the store. I mentioned how it was unfortunate I wouldn't be able to eat real food because my lunch was ice cream. A non-hiker must have overheard and offered me half of her cheeseburger. I was a little hesitant, but accepted and was able to eat it!After taking a shower and doing laundry, I made it back to the store for dinner - a hiker burger, fries, and a lemonade. Second dinner was a larger pizza a couple hours later. I am eating more than I have in my entire life. It's hard work!Tomorrow, the plan is to make it 26.6 miles. That will put me in the middle of a bad part of trail which has little water and next to no camping available. The terrain looks pretty flat. I'm fairly certainly it is VERY Rocky.

I had 19.3 miles of trail before even reaching that point, so my plan was to bisect the dry section and stay at a hotel 0.4 miles away from the trail.There was a little boulder hopping in the morning and some smaller rocks after that. Then, the AT passed through a couple of miles of fields. The signs stated they were AT farm lands and were planted to preserve the historic pastoral setting. Around 12:30pm, I was in Boiling Springs, PA. That was my last chance to fill up on water. Also, there was a gas station a block from trail where I bought a delicious wrap and a slushy. I was back on trail before 1pm.The rest of the day was super flat and twisted through trees and bushes. I met a guy named Slide who I had heard about a few days ago. We talked for a while, but he was doing a 40-mile day and I had to peel off for the hotel after my 27-mile day.This hotel is not nice, but it is air conditioned and better than a tent.

It was a lot and took me some time to sort through it.Then, it was on to the nearby truck stop to pick up a couple of days of food. I also bought a 6"" sub from the Subway inside (because, hiker hunger). I had to sort through all of that and pack it in the parking lot. It was a mess and felt like it took forever.There was a steep climb out of Duncannon. It was only about 2 miles, but slow going due to TONS of rock and some bouldering. Also, it had started raining, making the rock slick and dangerous. I guess this is my life now. Rockin' the AT all the way through the rest of PA.

I arrived at the shelter around 2:30pm. I was feeling good, so I decided to press on. My new goal was a set of tentsites about 4 miles North.Another factor in my decision was a small section of trail flooded by beaver activity. The note in Guthook said it was 1 mile long. The comments from other hikers were mixed. I decided to take my chances because the alternate route was 0.6 miles longer. Turns out being an OCR athlete has some benefits. I walked right across that beaver dam. Piece of cake.I arrived at the tentsites at 3:45pm and set up my tent. It took over an hour for the floor to dry so I could finish setting up. I used that time to eat and try to find water. The ""seasonal stream"" noted in Guthook was nowhere to be found. I guess it's dry Camping for me tonight.It will be a relatively short day tomorrow (partly because of my longer day today).

Someone at the hostel mentioned there was a nice shelter just 2 miles farther North. That made for a 29.7 mile day, much of it over the rocks. My feet are pretty sore. There was a lot of rock hopping and even a little bouldering. Thankfully, there was also some smooth(ish) trail to give me a break every now and then. I have found that if I work at it, I can find a rhythm over and through the rocks. It is fun and makes the time go faster.
I made good time and arrived at the shelter before 4:30pm. I snagged one of two remaining spots. It is essentially a large shed with two doors and two windows There is no insulation and the six bunks are built into the shelter. There is a table inside and another outside. A privy/shower is housed in a separate shack, but it has running water and a flushing toilet! This is all essentially in the caretakers backyard. Very interesting place.
During the day, I passed through the town of Port Clinton. It's a cute, old town. There was a rail yard with a couple of vintage looking trains. All of the buildings looked like they were at least 100 years old. Unfortunately, I had to make miles and didn't get to look around.
Tomorrow should be a shorter day. I am doing about 24 miles and stopping just short of Palmerton, PA, where I will be doing a 2-day resupply the following morning.","Rock N Sole Hostel

In the morning, the rock was wet from rain last night. I slipped on a boulder around 7:30am and bent a trekking pole. Luckily, I wasn't injured and was able to straighten the pole. If I were using carbon poles, I'm pretty sure it would have snapped. I was also going too fast. I slowed down a little for the rest of the day and didn't have any other issues.
My plan was to tent close to a shelter tonight, but I ended up porting water about a half mile down the trail to an undocumented campsite. It is less than a mile from town, so I can hear a lot of traffic. Also, the cell service is excellent. Lol. A LASH'er decided to stop and camp here for the same reason.

It really wasn't bad and it saved me an hour and a half!The climb out of Palmerton was worse than I expected. The elevation profile showed it was steep, but ther was some legitimate scrambling involved where I had to climb up rock with my hands. I was thankful to only have 2 days of food in my pack. All of that happened before 7:30am.A couple of hours later, I was hiking and heard someone yell. It was an older gentleman and he was on the ground. He was grabbing his chest and my first thought was heart attack. He told me he had tripped, fallen, and landed on a tree root. My guess is he just had a bruised rib.Fortunately, I didn't have any incidents today. The rest of the day was uneventful, but full of smaller rocks. I ended up going past the shelter I had scheduled and camping about 3 miles down trail. I met a section Hiker there and Tex showed up a little later.

Bluejeans was still asleep, Tex was gone, and someone new was in camp, still in their tent. I thought Tex may have hit the trail early, but I was breaking cobwebs all morning. I have no idea what happened or when the new person moved in.It was a relatively easy day today, both in terms of distance and terrain. I made it to the hotel just before noon. The attendant said check-in was at 4pm. I said okay and politely left. He asked me to come back and found a clean room for me. I was glad to have a safe place for my pack so I didn't have to lug it all over town. I left to find lunch. I settled on a turkey, avocado, and cheese melt, apple pie a la mode, fries, and a lemonade.The next order of business was laundry. I found the only washer and dryer in the bad part of the hotel (it is two hotels in one building) and decided to camp out. The dryer was actually broken and didn't require coins. Unfortunately, it ignored any temperature setting and used high heat on everything, including my shoe insoles. I have washed them before and they are okay on low heat. High heat destroyed them. I managed to find a set at the local outfitter, but they are Oboz and have arch support that wants to interfere with my orthotics. I hope the foam will eventually compress. They really only need to make it to Fort Montgomery, NY where my new shoes will be waiting for me.Dinner was a large pizza that I had to eat in two sittings. I then resupplied for the next three days at a gas station.

Less than an hour later, I saw a large rat snake on the trail. Maybe two hours later, I ran into Tex on the trail! She had hiked through DWG and stayed at a Campsite 5 miles down trail.
My plan was to do about 25 miles for the day. I reached that goal at 2:15am, so I looked at the map and plotted a new destination. I noticed there was a sandwich shop 3.6 miles past the shelter and another shelter 3.2 miles past that. The issue was that the sandwich shop closed at 4pm. I pushed hard and made it there at 3:30pm. The sandwich was incredible. It was very, very messy and had Cole slaw on it. I also ordered a side of Cole slaw. Delicious! I met two hikers there, Augie (thru-hiker) and Caroline (LASH'er).
I made my way to the next shelter, feeling a good 10 pounds heavier. I still made it there around 5pm, found a tent spot, and set up camp. It is a mix of section hikers and thru-hikers camped here. Augie and Caroline stopped by to eat dinner, but got back on trail for another 10 miles, some of it by headlamp. They may get rained on. It certainly feels like a storm is moving in.
I need to adjust my plans for tomorrow since I stopped in a different spot today. If I push tomorrow out a bit, it should help avoid a long day hiking when I also need to resupply on Sunday.","Clarion Inn

At 10am I had my third bear encounter. It was an adult black bear,Â  probably the largest I've seen so far. It ran away immediately and wasn't interested in me at all. As usual, I was sure to make a lot of noise for the next 100-200 yards. About 10 minutes later, I saw a couple out walking their dog. It wasn't on a leash and was running all over the forest. I told them about the bear about 1/4 mile behind us and they decided to let me trailblaze for them. Lol.

The building looked like it had been there since the 50's and it was packed with stuff. I was able to find just about everything I wanted, but they were short on breakfast items. I also ordered an Italian sandwich and bought a push-up. It was just like when my Mom used to take me to Mel's meat market back home. If I was good, she would buy me a push pop. It brought back a lot of memories. The climb out of town was brutal and I drank about half of my water.The trail was empty today. I only saw 6 thru-hikers or section hikers.

That fall was worse, with my hands, right knee, and forehead hitting the ground pretty hard. I was a little shook up, but I feel okay.The terrain was another element. From the beginning, New York had bigger rocks, bigger climbs, and more changes in elevation. It continued today. A couple of the climbs involved scrambling and one of them was barely wide enough to squeeze through. I felt like I went up and down mountains constantly. I certainly haven't climbed this much since Virginia.The worst part of my day was realizing an error in my planning. I thought it was an easy, 19-mile day. In reality, it was 29.3 miles. The error occurred when I was moving some things around and making changes. I forgot to change one number and it messed up my calculation. The only reason it matters at all is the post office closes at 5pm and I didn't make it to town until 6pm.

The sandwich was amazing and the potato salad wasn't bad, either!On my way out of Dalton, I ran into Bilbo, who I had met at camp the night before. He was riding around with a guy who does shuttles and also trail magic, so I got a grape soda out of the deal. I chatted with them about the area and the shuttle driver mentioned Chesire, MA, which was just a few miles past where I was going to camp. Yep, I changed my plans. Lol.I arrived at Chesire around 5:15, too late for the ice cream shop. However, the Campsite in town is amazing. There is a water spigot, power outlets, a port-o-potty, bikes to ride around town, picnic tables, a trash can, and plenty of level ground for tents. A hiker named Perch and I rode bikes to Dollar General for resupply, where I was sure to buy some ice cream and a cold drink for tonight. The ride back with bags on handlebars was a little sketchy, but it all worked out.It was a long day, but a fun one. Tomorrow, I will only be doing 21.5 miles, but I will also be doing a bunch of climbing, including Mount Greylock, the tallest point in Massachusetts.","Upper Goose Pond Cabin

Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640064,"The Campsite last night was great, but I didn't sleep well. Maybe it was all of the noise from town. There are definite drawbacks to camping in city limits.Â 
When I woke up, there were two new tents. Who were they? When did they set up? No idea. I was on trail around 5:30am and was prepared for a day of climbing. First, it was up to the highest point in Massachusetts, Mount Greylock. The lodge was closed, so I didn't get the snack I was hoping for. The war Memorial was also closed until 9:30am, so I didn't get to go up in it.
Next, was decending into the town of North Adams. I decided to stop by and have a pint of ice cream since it was so hot outside and lunchtime. It was a great decision, but I somehow managed to break a tooth off of my fork! I guess I need to Amazon a titanium fork and have it shipped to Glencliff, NH.
The last climb was into Vermont and the shelter for the night. It was steep and rocky- much more difficult than the climb to Greylock. I finally arrived around 4pm and claimed a prime tent spot. Perch and a bunch of other hikers showed up over the following hours. I feel like I have hiked into a mini bubble.
I have missed some things while I've been gone. Piper has started using the big girl potty! I was so proud, I sent her a dinosaur cape. Lauren sent me a video of her opening the package and wearing it. She was stomping around and yelling ""Rwar!"". It makes me smile every time I think about it. More motivation for me to finish the hike and get back home.","Father Tom Campsite

Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640120,"My day started normal enough. It rained last night, so I had to pack my tent a little damp. I decided to pack it outside of the waterproof section. It just isn't worth risking my clothes and sleeping bag getting wet.
South Vermont isn't impressing me so far. There were a couple of ponds that were good for photos, but in reality they were a swampy, bug-infested hellscape. Much of the trail was muddy as well and bugs followed me most of the time. If it wasn't muddy, it was full of roots and rocks. Very little of the trail was enjoyable. Maybe worse than all of that was the fact that the trail is poorly marked in places. At points, I found myself with multiple paths to choose from and not a white blaze was in sight.
Around 11am, I found some awesome trail magic. It was a guy named Jonathan, who is a veteran originally from Texas. He was serving hot dogs, watermelon, bananas, honey buns, water, and beer. He also had some medical supplies and was offering to charge phones for hikers. Super guy. That was probably the highlight of my day.
I continued on through the heat and humidity toward my destination, a shelter several miles down trail. On the way, I climbed up a fire tower to take photos and noticed storm clouds. It didn't look like they were close or toward the direction I was traveling. I was wrong. About 20 minutes later, a gentle rain started, ramping up quickly into a heavy shower. The trail was a huge puddle with only roots and rocks visible. I didn't want to step in the puddles because I had no idea how deep they were. I mostly skirted the sides of the trail and hopped across rocks.
Just as the rain was letting up, I arrived at the shelter. It was full of hikers and there wasn't a tent space in sight. I went down trail 100 yards - still nothing. I decided to fill up my water bottles and my water bag and look for a stealth spot to pitch my tent. It took 1.4 miles of hiking, but I found a spot. It is 4-5 feet from the trail. Not ideal, but I am making it work. I managed to get set up, washed up, and began dinner before it started raining again. The next shelter is another 3.2 miles. I'm very glad I didn't push on because I probably would have been setting up in the rain, if there was a spot available at all. Shelters tend to be collection points for hikers during inclement weather.

I only heard a couple of people walk by before I passed out. I sleep with ear plugs, which helps. Over the ear plugs, I heard a loud, low sound in the middle of the night. I woke up and realized it was 100% dark. I'm not sure this is something I have experienced on trail. After a few seconds, I figured out that the low sound was rain. Most of the drops were bouncing off the canopy of the forest. The drops were slow and small. Sometimes, a huge drop would pass through the canopy and hit my tent with loud, drumming sound.The rain stopped early in the morning and I was able to pack up in the dry. Of course, my tent was still soaked. I made my way down trail and it was a disaster. The usual mud holes were now huge pits, often spanning the entire width of the trail. That was my morning - dodging mud and tree roots.I climbed Straton Mountain, which wasn't terribly difficult in the cool morning air. There was a fire tower, but I didn't climb it. The fog was so thick, visibility was very low. I signed the trail register and moved on. It wasn't long before I was leaving trail and heading to the hotel.I checked in to the hotel around 2pm, took a shower, and paid the hotel to shuttle me to town, the first time I've paid for a shuttle on the AT. It was 5 miles one way, so I didn't have much of a choice. I was able to eat a good meal, buy a new titanium spoon (!!!), and resupply food. Back at the hotel, I did laundry in the bathtub and noticed one pair of my socks is starting to fail.

The trail was already a mess. It started raining harder and didn't let up until 1pm. The wind was blowing and the temperature dropped as well. I think it was in the low 50's, which is pretty cold for July!
Trail conditions continued to deteriorate throughout the morning. Most of the trail was filled with water, so I hiked in wet shoes and socks for most of the day. I admit I was getting a little depressed. My tent was still wet from two nights ago. Would I have time to dry it out at camp? Would it even stop raining long enough for that to be possible? How could I sleep in my tent if the inside was wet? I was very anxious. After the rain stopped and I saw that I was making good time, I relaxed a bit.
I made it to the shelter at 3:45pm and only one other person was there. The only tent sites were platforms, which is typically a problem because I don't have a free-standing tent. Fortunately, I figured out how to set up on the platform and my tent was able to dry out around 6:30pm. The site is next to one of three mountain ponds in Southern Vermont.

I don't mind hiking in the rain, except it is destroying my feet.Also, it is pretty cold for July. The high for yesterday and today was 54. The low last night was 48. At one point, I woke up and put on my puffy. I'm very glad to still have my 30 degree sleeping bag.

This is seriously some weird weather, at least for me. Pico Camp slept well, though it was a bit unlevel, like the entire building was sliding off the mountain. Also, it may be haunted. When I was setting up last night, I swear I heard a voice. I looked, but no one was there. I was the only one at Pico Camp all night.
Today was a shorter day, but I had to walk down to the Killington Deli to pick up a day of food. While I was there, I ate one of their breakfast sandwiches, a strawberry parfait, and drank a chocolate milk. It was delicious and helped my morale considerably.
I also stopped by the outfitter and bought two new pairs of socks. They aren't exactly the same as the old ones, so I kept the pair of old ones that are serviceable and tossed the bad pair. So far, the new socks are working out okay. They are lighter, breathe better, and should dry faster. They just don't have as much cushion ans that is taking some getting used to.
Mid day, I met two thru-hikers: Derby and Arrow. Derby is mid 40's and Arrow looks to be in his late 20's. They are both staying in the shelter and I am tented nearby. Believe it or not, Derby used to live in Ada! It's a small world. Also, Derby is like that Johnny Cash song (he's been everywhere). I don't see many thru-hikers on trail anymore.

Not much sleep.
The trail runs right through Hanover, so the first mile or so was very easy. There were puddles in the streets, so it must have rained last night. As soon as I left town, it started pouring rain. Thankfully, it only lasted a couple of hours.
The day was full of climbing, much of it steep. I found a phone laying on the ground in one of those steep sections. It was in perfect condition and still had a charge, so I picked it up and carried it for a while. I soon saw a mother and son, who looked to be a college student. I asked if either of them had lost their phone. He patted his pockets and realized his phone was gone. After he correctly described the phone, I handed it back to him. I guess I did my ""good turn"" for the day as a Boy Scout.
I met a NOBO thru-hikers named Steady. He started the trail about a month before I did, but wants to summit on the 27th. We hikes together for a while and it was nice to have someone to talk to.

I believe this is very typical for Moosilauke. The descent was very steep and rocky. I took my time and was very careful, but I still slipped a couple of times. Everything was wet and very slick.
I passed the shelter I had planned to camp at or near around 2pm. I couldn't bring myself to stop that early, but the next shelter was after two more summits (South and North Kinsman). In the White Mountains, the prospect of pushing another 4-5 miles must be carefully considered. This isn't anything I have had to worry about before. This terrain is serious and wants to kill you.
The climbs up the kinsman peaks were very difficult. I was grabbing rocks and roots with my hands. Every step was a struggle. It was around this time that I noticed some discomfort in my ankles. By the time I made it to the shelter, that discomfort was considerably worse. I think I strained connective tissue while climbing. Honestly, I'm a little worried. I took Advil and am going to see how they feel in the morning.
The caretaker at the shelter told me about a couple of ""dispersed campsites"" down trail. While I was looking for one, I ripped my brand-new shorts on a branch. Sigh. I finally found a site and just as I was setting up my tent, it started to rain again.

They were having a great time and said they didn't like to see someone walking in the rain.They dropped me off at the Price Chopper grocery store, per my request. I had just finished buying five days worth of food when an older guy named John started asking me about my hike. I told him about my adventure that morning and he offered to give me a ride back to the trailhead! His car was about a half mile mile from the store because he had walked. We walked to his car, which was at his house. He invited me in, made me avocado toast and let me pack all of the food in my bag. It was awesome!After John dropped me off, I started the hike up to the closest Campsite. It was only 2.5 miles or so, but my ankles were hurting and all of the extra food made every step exhausting. When I made it to the Campsite, I had to make a decision because there was no water for the next 7.5 miles and three 4k summits were between those two points. I remembered a video I took of Piper when she was helping me work on her swing set. She said ""Try-try-try, try-try-try, try-try, Daddy, you TRY!"" So, I did just that.

Each has a caretaker who collects a fee from each camper. It is pretty organized. One of the things they do is try to protect the site and that means no camping on the ground. All tents are pitched on wooden platforms, which is difficult for me because I don't have a free-standing tent. I managed to make it work last night, but one of my doors was off the platform and let in a terrible draft. In addition, I had to share the platform with another tent. I think it was a couple and whenever they moved around, it shook the entire platform. Other campers were also making noise after Hiker midnight (9pm). I finally had to yell at them. I don't think I will be staying at one of the AMC campsites again, but they did give me a discount card, good for half-price future campsite stays, two free baked goods, and a free bowl of soup at one of the AMC huts.
It rained last night, so I had to pack my tent wet...again. Thankfully, it didn't rain today. It was actually perfect weather for hiking, though it was a little cool in the morning. I made two summits today: South Twin and Zealand. South Twin was a steep climb. I think it was 1100 feet in about 0.8 miles. Zealand was a joke. I actually passed the summit and had to go back to take a photo. After Zealand, I hiked down to the Zealand Hut and used one of my free baked good coupons for a huge piece of chocolate cake. It was DELICIOUS!Â 
After refilling my water bottles, it was on find a place to camp. I checked out Ethan Pond, but the caretaker wasn't there to answer my questions, so I went on to find a dispersed campsite. I managed to snag one right by a stream. I set up camp at 1:30pm, which I would normally NEVER do. However, I am stuck.

Jackson, then I stopped at Mizpah Spring Hut. They had leftover oatmeal from breakfast and I ate all of it.

It was mildly steep and mostly just a field of rocks. This continued for miles. Somewhere in the middle of that misery, one of my trekking pole tips was lost. Not the entire tip, but the part that does the work - the carbide steel piece. So, now I have one functional pole and one that mostly just slides around everywhere. Not great.

As soon as I descended into the notch, the air temperature dropped about 10 degrees. I looked in the cracks at the bottoms of the boulders and some still had ice in them...in the middle of July! The section was mostly bouldering and highly technical. It took me about an hour to traverse the 0.8 miles and it was a lot of fun. A lot of work, but a lot of reward.
From the end of the notch, it was time to climb 1500 feet in a mile up the Mahoosuc Arm. It was starting to get warmer and the climb was exhausting.Â 
The arm transitioned into Old Speck Mountain, which is a 4k. I took a pic at the summit, but didn't climb the fire tower. A storm was moving in and it didn't seem wise to stand on top of a metal structure. Also, I didn't really have time.
The rest of the day was mostly climbing up and down mountains. I am so tired that it was all I could do to make the 15.5 miles to the shelter. I hope to make quite a few more miles tomorrow.","Full Goose Shelter

Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641135,"I slept terribly last night. Someone rolled in late and made a lot of noise. Then, they proceeded to snore loudly all night. I finally decided to wake up (lol) at 3am and made it to trail at 4am.
The day was pretty uneventful eventful, other than the massive elevation changes. The terrain was still challenging and there was some ladders and such. It was still much calmer than the trail has been. I managed 27 miles today, which is more than I have hiked since Vermont! It took a long time, but I did it. I feel like I needed to prove to myself that I could do it after my weak showing yesterday.
My ankles are finally starting to feel a little better, though the descents today didn't do them any favors. The bigger pain right now is the fourth toe on my left foot. I have had trouble with it before and it is back. I think it is a friction issue, so I will need to remember to put a bandaid on it every morning.
Lauren sent me a video of Piper putting her seat on a regular potty and going all by herself! It really lifted my spirits. She is growing up so fast. I need to hurry home so I don't miss it!","Frye Notch Lean-To

Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641136,"Today was neatly split into two parts. The first was an easy 14.7 trek to The Hiker Hut. I picked up 2-1/2 days of food there, ate one of their egg sandwiches (meh), and made it back to trail within an hour.Â 
The second half was...not so easy or enjoyable. It was 10 miles of climbing and descending over rugged and often steep terrain. The two 4k summits were completely exposed and the weather was brutal up there. The wind was strong, the rain was pelting me in the face, and the temperatures were in theory 50's. Even with rain gear, all of my clothes were wet. Good conditions for hypothermia.
I finally made it to camp and around 5pm and rounded out another strong day of hiking. I am sore, but feeling good and proud of what I've been able to accomplish.
Tomorrow, I am looking forward to a slightly lighter pack, though there will be more 4k summits and plenty of climbing.","Bemis Stream

Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641137,"Today was a long day. I woke up at 3:30am and tried not to wake the others in the shelter. It's never easy and one of the things I hate about staying in shelters. It may also be why no one seemed to be thrilled about me being there.I made it on trail around 4:45am and things had dried out a bit. Hiking in the dry is so much easier and more fun. The tree roots, rocks, and mud are a disaster in the wet. I climbed two 4k summits before it started to rain again. It dumped rain for about 3 hours and stopped about an hour before I made it to camp.Early in the morning I was crossing a stream and slipped on a Boulder. I tried to catch myself and ended up taking the skin off the side of my left, middle finger. I had to bandage it up on site because it was bleeding a fair amount. It isn't bothering me at all, but I will need to pick up some extra bandaids when I resupply.Tomorrow morning, I will climb the last 4k before Katahdin. I am super excited about that! Better terrain is coming!","Poplar Ridge Lean-To

Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641260,"I let myself sleep in this morning, knowing I only had 21.1 miles to do today. I still woke up at 4:15am, but that is late these days.
The rain from last night left my tent wet...again. After my morning routine, I was on trail at 5:35am. Immediately, I was climbing up the Bigelow Range, where I spent most of the day. It was a typical set of 4k mountains and minor mountains. I didn't have any trouble with it and made good time, despite the sometimes steep terrain.
I started feeling an irritation in my left food around noon. Then, it was my right foot. I eventually stopped at 1pm at a shelter to refill water and see what was going on with my feet. I'm still not sure, but I think they are sores, possibly bacterial. Most likely, it is from letting my socks get too dirty. I am going to get back to doing trail laundry and start washing my feet every night with soap. At the shelter, I rinsed my feet and let theÂ  dry in the sun. Then, I applied some athletes foot cream (couldn't hurt!), and put on my ""emergency socks"". They were clean and dry. Immediately, my feet felt a little better.
I was able to continue on to the shelter where I planned to camp. It is beautiful here. There is a huge pond about 200 yards from the camp and the water is crystal clear. Plenty of other hikers are here, too. Some are section hikers and others are SOBO's. I think I am the only NOBO.","Cranberry Stream Campsite

Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641259,"Today was an easy day. I woke up and hit the trail at 5:30am. It rained in the early morning, so I had to pack my tent wet, but thankfully it had stopped by the time I woke. I had eaten everything except breakfast and lunch, so I needed to make good time today. Also, the ferry across the river only runs from 9am-2pm, so I was definitely on a schedule.The terrain was relatively smooth, easy, and mostly downhill. I hiked as fast as I could and made 13 miles or so in less than 5-1/2 hours. I wish I could do that every day! Unfortunately, it did start to rain a bit, making the rocks and roots very slick. I must have fallen 3-4 times. It was pretty frustrating.The ferry was really neat to experience. When I made it to the shore of the river, I called out to the guy on the other shore. He hopped in his canoe and paddled across. Another Hiker (ninja kitty) and I filled out a form, put on PFD's, loaded our packs, and rode back across with him.I walked 1.3 miles up the road to the hostel. It is a very old house, converted to a B&B style place. The people are very nice and the owner used to be a professor at OSU! Small world. I am very glad to have clean clothes, charged devices, and a full.bag of food. I also ate A TON of town food at the local pub.Tomorrow, I head off for the final big stretch of trail. I will be out for 5-1/2 days. Then, I am pretty much done with the AT. I bought my plane ticket tonight. So surreal.","

Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641432,"I am proud of the work I put in today. My goal was a little over 24 and I ended the day at 28. The terrain was pretty flat, but with tons of rocks and roots. If there weren't rocks or roots, it was a bog. Still, I was making good time, I felt strong, and the weather was perfect.
My pack was certainly heavy with over 5 days of food. The shoulder strap adjusters kept slipping and required constant attention. I don't think they are rated for the load I'm putting on them. Lol. I kept telling myself that my pack will never be this heavy again. Each day it will magically get a little lighter.
One of my water bottle sport caps broke today. I had a feeling it was coming because it felt flimsy. I have decided to stop using the sport cap function on both bottles so I don't have to remember which one is broken. It is going to be a pain, but just for a few days!
I am pretty sure I am burned out on hiking. I am tired and I need a break. No way I am going to take a zero this close to Katahdin and mess up my 100-day goal. I will instead use it as additional motivation. The sooner I finish, the sooner I get to rest.","Caratrunk

Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641433,"It rained a little last night, but my tent was dry by morning. I packed a dry tent for the first time in several days.
After trying to unscrew my sport caps every time I wanted to take a drink, I decided it wasn't worth it. When I made it to the road to Monson, I decided to try getting a hitch into town. It would be 4 miles to walk. I got a hitch in 5 minutes from a nice lady from New Hampshire in a Suburu. She took me to the general store where I was able to buy new bottles with caps. I also bought two packets of instant potatoes, two builders bars, and a pint of ice cream. I ate the ice cream on site for extra calories and the rest was for future days. I got a quick hitch back to trail from the mother of a hiker. She was helping him resupply before he headed into the 100-mile wilderness.
When I entered the 100-mile wilderness, I got emotional. I called Lauren and we talked for a few minutes. I am going to miss my best friend and I am going to hate feeling so isolated. I made a video for Piper to explain why we can't talk while I'm out here. I know that is going to be hard for her, too.
The terrain today was tougher than expected, but still manageable. I am surprised at just how many people are on trail in the 100-mile. It's almost like a bubble. I ran into an old friend named ""Steady"". We hadn't seen each other since the White Mountains. We have been doing different miles, but it looks like we are going to summit the same day and we are camped at the same Shelter tonight. I think we are going to stick together for the rest of the trail.","Horseshoe Canyon Lean-To

Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641435,"Today involved a lot of climbing and it was most of the last climbing until Katahdin. There is one little mountain I will have to deal with tomorrow. The rest of the trail is flat. I've heard there are a lot of roots and rocks in some areas, which makes progress a little slow. I will take that over the big elevation changes!
I can feel Katahdin getting closer. This afternoon, I got my first good glimpse at Big K. It is really a sight to behold, even from miles away. I am very excited to be done with this epic journey. The next couple of days are going to fly by. Then, it will be time to summit and come home. I'm sure I will miss the trail, but I think I will get over it. Lol.
It's a little past 7:30pm as I write this and I haven't seen ""Steady"" all day. When we talked yesterday, we agreed on the same shelter. I wonder what happened to him and if he is okay. I know he starts and stops late, but it was only 24 miles and it will be dark soon.","Cloud Pond Lean-To

Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641436,"Last night was NOT a restful sleep. I chose the shelter over the terrible tent sites. There were only 4 of us in the 6-person shelter, so it wasn't cramped. However, I think everyone snored and the floor shook every time anyone made a move. On top of that, my inflatable pillow has developed a slow leak, requiring a breath every 2 hours or so.
""Steady"" rolled past the shelter around 8:00 last night, just before dark. He was with another hiker I hadn't seen before. The other hiker stayed in the shelter and Steady kept hiking. I thought he was going a but farther to find a tent site, but I didn't see him this morning when I hiked down trail. Mysterious!
Today's terrain was very flat. I had to climb one mountain in the early morning, then it was smooth sailing. Well, as smooth as the AT gets in Maine. There were still blow-down's, rocks, and roots everywhere. I did 27.4 miles in under 11 hours, which is pretty good!
Part of my motivation today was setting up camp early and eating. I was very hungry all day long. Another part was going to bed early in my tent. The last part was taking a Benadryl and laying down inside the bug netting. I forgot to apply insect repellant this morning and the mosquitos destroyed my legs.
Tomorrow, it will be a quick 25.4 miles to the last Shelter in the 100-mile wilderness. I am tempted to do another 5 miles and try to tent at the campground next to the store and restaurant. I will see how I feel when the time comes.Â ","Logan Brook Lean-To

Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641635,"I stayed up for a while last night reading about the final couple of days on the AT. Apparently, there can be some competition over the 12 slots at the Birches Shelter. If I was too late sigbing up at the kiosk, I would either have to try again the next day or hike another 9+ miles before starting the Katahdin summit (terrible idea, though it has been done). There are no other options. Knowing that, sleep was difficult. I finally decided to get on trail and be productive. At 2am, I began the 29-mile trek to The ABOL campground by headlamp. It was pretty difficult to navigate by headlamp, but after first light it was quite a bit easier.
I arrived at the campground around 12:30pm, secured a tent space, and promptly began eating. Then, it was time for laundry and charging my battery packs. There was a long line for laundry, so I had to wait a while to take a shower. I used that time to keep eating and eating and eating. I feel so much better now than I did when I arrived.
Tomorrow, I will wake up pretty early and hit the trail by 5am. It is less than a mile to the kiosk and I think I will be one of the 12. I know of at least three other hikers here at this campground who want a spot and maybe two more at a campground across the street. That's the game. Who is dumb enough to get there first and who is unlucky enough to miss out. After I sign up, I have to proceed directly to the shelter, which is about 10 miles away. It will be a waste of a half day, but I am taking a ton of food with me for the day and for summit day.","Nahmakanta Stream Lean-To

I was first on the list, but it felt like a lot of wasted effort.
After hiking 10 miles to the shelter, I set up my tent. I wanted to dry it out and I think I will sleep better in it than in the shelter. Other hikers did the same thing. I think there are only three people in the two 4-person shelters.
Most of the day was spent eating and resting. Around 5pm, Demin Dan and I made a campfire for the site. Most everyone went to bed early in anticipation of the summit tomorrow.","Abol Bridge Campground

Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641637,"I didn't sleep especially well last night. How could I? The past 3+ months have been building up to this day. I hit the trail at 4:45am and signed the Hunt trail register at 5:03am. After about 30 minutes, I caught up with Demin Dan. He and I hiked the rest of the day together. I really like him. Cool, older guy from West Texas.
The clim up Katahdin was pretty intense for about 2 miles. There were three pieces of re-bar on one section which absolutely had to be there. It was that steep. Hand holds were common and trekking poles were pointless. At a couple of points, I had to wedge my feet in rocks and one time I had to lift my entire body (and pack) up using only my arms. Then, the mountain rounded off and the next two miles were pretty easy. I remember first seeing the sign and cairn in the distance. It was surreal. I tagged the cairn and Demin Dan helped me with some photos. We had the summit to ourselves for about 30 minutes. It was super windy and pretty cold, maybe mid to high 40's.
After the steep and technical ascent, Denim Dan and I decided to take ABOL trail down. It didn't really matter at that point because our thru-hike was over. The ABOL trail was just as steep, but with a huge rock field instead of boulders. My knees took a beating, but we made it down. At several points, I regretted taking my full pack. I really felt it on the descent.
After making it back to the ranger's station, I had to wait until the shuttle arrived at 5pm. A few other hikers jumped on and we went to the AT Lodge in Millenocket about 25 miles away. I had a huge dinner, a shower, and am starting to feel a little more like a human being.
Tomorrow will be a travel day. It will take a shuttle and two busses, but eventually I should arrive in Portland for two nights in a hotel before I fly home.","Birches Lean-To
