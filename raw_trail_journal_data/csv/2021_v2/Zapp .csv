Zapp ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645667,"Day 0 is the day before my first day of hiking.  It began with me sleeping in till 9am.  I had most things set out but had to frantically stuff everything in my backpack.  I was on the road by 10am.  It was an uneventful drive with a few traffic backups due to construction and an accident but I made it safely. 
I am now sitting on a bunk in a hostel near Harpers Ferry. There are 6 bunk beds in one room or room for 12 hikers.  There is noone else here so no use in paying for a private room.  I will take a shower just because it is my last chance before hitting the trail.
I have arranged for someone to pick me up at 7am tomorrow morning and take me to Front Royal VA where I will start my hike back to here.
My pack is way too full.  6 days of food and 2L of water are really adding to the weight.  I'll try to weigh it tomorrow.  Last year my pack was 32 lbs with 4 days of food and 2L of water.  Was hoping to get my weight closer to 20 lbs.
The adventure starts tomorrow.  Goodnight. ",,View Entry,"Nov 05, Fri",0
Zapp ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645684,"Day 1 began when my alarm went off at 6:30am.  I had a shuttle lined up for 7am.  A bit earlier than maybe I wanted but it worked out fine.  It was about an hour drive to where the AT goes by Front Royal VA.  This is where I ended my hike last year.  I always hike so I am at my car when I finish.
The first 5 miles hiking northbound out of Front Royal is the easiest 5 miles I have ever hiked on the AT.  Gentle uphill to Jim & Molly Denton shelter which is the most amazing shelter and my intended stopping point.   It has a spring water faucet with a solar shower (too cold for that). It even has a horseshoe pit.  I arrived there at 10am. 
I had only eaten a Kind breakfast bar at this point.  There is a food prep method called cold soaking.  A stove and fuel is not carried,  saving weight.  I cold soaked some oatmeal made from quick oats, cinnamon, walnuts and dehydrated pomegranates. Having some chunky stuff in there helps get cold oatmeal down. They are in ziploc bags and I put them in my pocket while soaking to warm them up.  Spring water is way too cold.
At noon I realized I didn't want to hang out at this shelter for 10 more hours till bed time so off I went 5+ more miles for a total of 10.7.  I am now at Manassas Gap shelter.  Much older but quite functional.  My plan was to sleep in my tent this trip but flat spots around this shelter have dead trees nearby.  So in the shelter I'll sleep.  Noone else here (who else would be crazy enough to hike in this cold weather).
I have a Knor rice side with added dehydrated veggies and chili powder in my pocket.  It is going to take a while for this to hydrate.  I have lots of time.
My hike today didn't really have any views.  This section is much easier than past hikes but that means not getting up as high.  Not sure what kind of shape I am in with less biking this summer.  The dull section was intentional. 
It is 4:45 and the sun is getting close to the mountains already. The temperature is going to drop fast.  I may have to curl up under my quilt after eating.Goodnight all.","Front Royal

Zapp ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645714,"Day two started early with my hiking by 7am at first light.  I hiked 12.9 AT miles.  I was grinding out the miles.  This puts me a day ahead of my planned mileage. The trail was again easy compared to previous hikes on the AT but that will change tomorrow.  I plan to do 10 miles of ""the rollercoaster."" A 13+ mile of relentless ups and downs.  It is also said to be rocky.  We'll see tomorrow. 
I did stop at a shelter early to use the smoldering privy and get some water.  They are stinky things but I prefer them to digging a cat hole to poop in the woods.
The AT went through a state park and there quite a few out on the trails.  I did take a side trail to Whitehouse overlook.  The 1st view I have had this trip.  There was a picnic table there so I made lunch.  Idahoan mashed potatoes with added sunflower seeds and dehydrated spring mix salad (dehydrate the spring mix then put in a blender to make a powder).
I saw my first trail magic today.  Someone left a cooler with drinks on the trail.  I was so tempted to stop and have a beer but didn't.  Needed to crush the miles today.  If you add in my side trail excursions, I was probably close to 15 miles hiking with a pack.  That is more than a half marathon in hills with a pack.
Yesterday I saw a red fox and today I twice spooked deer.  The second time they were right next to the trail and started leaping away.  Startled me.  Also birds and a few squirrels.  I can hear an owl off in the distance but have not seen one.
Again I am alone in a shelter, Rod Hollow shelter.  Sun went away early in this hollow.  It is 5:48 and completely dark.  Someone i passed on trail said it is supposed to drop below freezing again tonight.  Last night I was too hot from the waist up except a cold face. My gear appears to be working fine.  No data here so I'll have to send this tomorrow. 
Goodnight. ","Manassas Gap shelter

Zapp ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645725,"Day 3 was tough.  The Rollercoaster part of the AT is just one mountain after another.  None of them particularly tall but the trail was always going up or down.  And the most disappointing thing was no view when I got to the top.  These are called pointless ups and downs (PUDS) by hikers.  It was very rocky so had to be looking down most of the way. I don't mind hills.  I find them challenging.  Overall I did 9.8 miles.
There were so many deer i lost count.  No other wildlife.
A thru-hiker is someone who hikes the whole trail in one year.  It does not have to be continuous.   I have met 2.  One yesterday had already hiked Georgia to Maine but missed this section so was picking it up.  Another I met today started in Maine late and is headed southbound or SOBO.  He has to be done by the end of the year.  I know I couldn't hike that fast.
I arrived at bears den hostel at 3pm.  There phone message said they didn't open till 5pm so went to a brewery less than a mile away.  Had nachos and a couple of beers.  This place was amazing.  Great view, giant back lawn, fire pits with free wood and tasty beer.
Turns out there is a back entrance with a code.  If I had read the fine print I could have figured out the code.  Oh well.  I am showered and wearing some hiker clothes they have here while mine get washed.
There are a few miles of the rollercoaster left tomorrow and over 11 miles to hike so I had better get some rest.
Goodnight ","Rod Hollow shelter

Zapp ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645735,"Day 4 was very cool. I am sitting on a porch swing at David Lesser shelter as I write this.  Very relaxing way to end my day.
Last night was at Bears Den hostel.  It is a castle.  Walls, even interior walls, are made of giant stones.  They have a $35 hiker special that includes a bunk for the night, shower, laundry, frozen pizza and a pint of ice cream. I needed all the above.  Just a bunk and shower is $25.  Much cheaper than a hotel but there may be others bunked in the same room.  They also set out everything to make pancakes which I didn't take time to make.
Bears den rocks is across the AT from the hostel.  The view this morning was great.  It turns out I had a few more great views today.  So exciting to be rewarded for those big climbs.  Buzzard rocks view was just before I got to here.  The view was great, lots of yellows with some brown oak leaves still on trees.  There were actually buzzards flying circles right in the middle of the view.
Today's weather was perfect. In fact, I have had blue skies this whole hike.  Warming up every day.  It must have been in the 60s.  I wished I had a t-shirt. It might be too warm for my 20 deg. quilt tonight. 
Odd that there were no deer on my hike today.  There has been a buck wandering around the shelter I have enjoyed watching.  The other odd thing is squirrels were everywhere.  Had only seen a couple till today.  Maybe it warmed up enough for them to be out.
I finished the rollercoaster section today.  So glad to have conquered that.  That was only about 3 miles.  The rest of the day was much easier hiking and made it hear earlier despite the late start this morning. 11.3 trail miles total.  About the same left to do tomorrow.  Should be easy downhill into Harpers Ferry to finish this adventure.","Bears Den hostel

Zapp ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645788,"Day 5 was again a great weather day.  In a way it is disappointing.   Part of the purpose of these hikes is to figure out if I have the right gear.  For example, this is the second backpacking trip where I have carried an umbrella and never used it.  Can't tell if I would appreciate having it unless I have a few cold rainy days. 
Last night there was a lot of deer activity around my shelter.  There was a buck hanging around before it got dark and I saw a doe this morning.  I think it was a lucky buck.
Easy hiking today.  Water was a problem. I carry 2L of water which doesn't last long. I crossed a road near a gas station so walked a bit.  Purchased OJ, got a breakfast sandwich and refilled water bottles there.  A hot bacon egg and cheese sure hit the spot.
The trail goes right through Harpers Ferry.   I walked around and got an ice cream cone.  Neat town with a lot of history.  I would have enjoyed spending more time there. The AT crosses the Potomac river into Maryland on a train bridge and then follows an old canal toe path that allows bicycles.  The only place on the AT i have ever been on that allows anything but foot traffic.  Only a mile into MD and a very short steep hike up a hill to Cross Trails hostel and my car.  The shower was the best part.  A hot meal was second.  A warm bed and sleep was third.
It is sad my hike is over.  But so glad I took the time to get outdoors.  Now the long drive home tomorrow. ","David Lesser shelter
