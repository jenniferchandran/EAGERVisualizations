GaitKeeper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639393,"Hello everyone, GaitKeeper here!
Although I have done countless day hikes and even a couple of two day overnighters on the AT with my wife since my last section hike in 2020 it seems like forever since I’ve done a three or more day hike. I am really itching to get out there and that itch will hopefully be scratched in a few weeks. This next section hike will be very special because my daughter will be joining me! I am so excited! She has never spent a night in the woods so hopefully I can make it a positive experience for her. Our target start date is July 12th and on that day we will be hitting the AT near Front Royal, VA for the start of a SoBo section hike through Shenandoah National Park.
More to come…

The purpose of this hike, in addition to getting some fun exercise and spending time together, was to see how well the gear that I had assembled felt on Nosedive’s back. She is in exceptionally good shape but had never hiked any distance with a fully loaded backpack. It came as no surprise to me that she crushed it and could have easily continued on for a few more miles. Although she plans to continue to train between now and the day we hit the AT on July 12th I am confident that she is already up for the task!


Hats off to my wife and son-in-law for breezing through today’s hike as well!


As for how my daughter got the trail name “Nosedive”, well, she earned it from me today as a result of a “no serious harm done” accident she had during our hike. She has accepted the name and even kinda likes it. Well earned!

7:00 AM to 3:00 PM


We woke up bright and early this morning at my son-in-law (Taylor) and daughters’ (Kelsey aka Nosedive) home in Fairfax, VA and were at the trailhead at Route 522 near Front Royal, VA just before 7:00 AM as planned. 


Nosedive and I said our goodbyes to my wife Kelly and Taylor and headed south on the AT with a big climb facing us right from the start. We had fresh legs so no big deal!



The day went exceptionally well. Nosedive and I took advantage of all of the vistas the day had to offer and they were beautiful! It was a bit hazy though with the high heat and humidity we are experiencing this week.
We met and chatted with lots of other hikers and everyone was so friendly and seemed happy to be out there. Including Nosedive and I!


We were warned by several groups of hikers to beware of a couple of copperhead snakes along the trail but we never saw them, unfortunately, or fortunately depending on how you look at it! We did not see any other wildlife today either. We’re both hoping to see at least one bear during this trip. 


We arrived at our destination shelter, Gravel Springs Hut, at 3:00 PM and had loads of time to set up the tent, get organized, clean up, eat dinner and converse with several other hikers that were there. Great people, great time. 


We have a 13.1 mile day planned for tomorrow but are not sure what time we are going to hit the trail. Most likely around 7:00 AM similar to this morning. Nosedive and are are excited about tomorrow’s hike because we plan to stop at the Elkwallow Wayside which is where we were told has blackberry ice cream and milkshakes that are to die for. Really roughing it!


We experienced some loud thunder a bit ago and it is raining lightly right now. We are huddled in the shelter with around 10 other hikers. Hopefully the rain will stop soon and we will head to the tent for the night.

Gravel Springs Hut to Pass Mountain Hut


6:50 AM to 3:45 PM



The first thing I would like to say is something I forgot to say in yesterday’s journal and that is a big ‘Thank You’ to my beautiful wife and son-in-law for taking the time to get Nosedive and I to the trailhead at Route 522. Couldn’t do it without you!Nosedive told me to tell everyone “I cannot believe that I made it two days”. The miles are pretty tough out here and I am so very proud of her for gutting it out and getting over the five significant climbs we had today. All with a blister that was causing her a good bit of discomfort. Did I mention that it is pretty darn hot out too! We were both really happy to get to the shelter! Tomorrow is our longest day of the trip at 15.3 miles. We will be passing by the Skyland Resort & Restaurant tomorrow at the 11 mile mark so we may stop in there depending on how we’re feeling. 


Our stopover at the Elkwallow Wayside today was a great, almost two hour, break from hiking. I had a burger and fries and Nosedive had a grilled cheese sandwich. I topped my meal off with a bowl of their famous Blackberry Ice Cream. Yum yum.


We arrived at our destination shelter, Pass Mountain Hut, at 3:45 PM and again had loads of time to set up the tent, get organized, clean up, eat dinner and converse with several other hikers that were there.


We have a 15.4 mile day planned for tomorrow so we are hoping to get an earlier start. We’ll see how we feel in the morning.

Pass Mountain Hut to Rock Spring Hut


6:20 AM to 4:10 PM


Today started out with a big climb of about 1,300 feet up to Mary’s Rock Overlook. Was it ever worth it! There were many other climbs today but the one that took the wind out of our sails was the 900 foot climb up to Skyland Resort at the days 11 mile mark. We were looking forward to a meal there so we had that for motivation. Nosedive and I shared a turkey melt and an order of fries. The turkey melt was awesome. Nosedive wants to go back again just to get the turkey melt! 


We finally saw some large game. Last night as we were walking from the shelter to our tent we saw a whitetail deer grazing right beside our tent. Today we saw a large black snake slithering across the trail and a large turkey buzzard perched on a branch right beside the trail. 


Nosedive’s blister seems to be doing OK and she did today’s higher mileage with no problem at all! Even with all of the climbs and rocks. She did say that both of her feet were sore though, presumably because of so much rocky trail today. She is killing it and I am so proud of her!


We arrived at our destination shelter, Rock Spring Hut at 4:10 PM and again had loads of time to set up the tent, get organized, clean up and eat dinner. We cooked and ate our dinner on a log beside the tent this evening because the shelter and picnic table was filled to capacity. 


We have a 11.5 mile day planned for tomorrow with the option of doing a few more, depending on how we feel. If we did extra mileage tomorrow then that would reduce the 9 mile day we have scheduled for Friday which is when we plan to meet my wife and son-in-law at Swift Run Gap. We plan to spend the night in town there so that we can get a good shower, resupply and most importantly see our loved ones!

Rock Spring Hut to Lewis Mountain Campground 


6:50 AM to 1:15 PM


Today was an exceptionally easy day compared to the first three days. The weather seemed dryer and the trail had significantly less climbing and not near as many rocks. 


We saw a total of seven whitetail today. Two younger deer were together and five other sightings were alone. Several of them let us get within a few feet of them. It’s obvious that they have never been shot at. We also saw an adult raccoon just off the trail. Good day for wildlife. 


Nosedive’s feet are still giving her a hard time. We Leuko taped a few more toes to try to prevent further damage. She’s a tough one that girl!


We opted to hike past our original destination by 0.8 miles today to get to Lewis Mountain Campground. I had heard that there was no water at Bearfence Mountain Hut and it is 0.3 miles down over the side of the mountain. Oh no, not for us! Lewis Mountain Campground is a great little campground and it is only 70 steps from the AT. It did set me back $15 but it has all of the amenities including bathrooms, a camp store, shower, laundry and we have our own bear box and picnic table. Oh yeah, life is good. 


We only have 8.2 miles to get to Swift Run Gap tomorrow so we should be there by noon at which time my lovely wife and mother of Nosedive will meet us and take us into Elkton, VA for an evening off of the trail. I feel some air conditioning coming on!


As I was wrapping up this journal entry the skies decided to dump on us, again. Fortunately for us we had anticipated rain and already had all of our stuff tucked away. Nosedive and I sat it out in my Zpacks Triplex tent. It is a three person tent and has plenty of room for two people plus your gear if you prefer to keep it in the tent with you. I really love that tent! I use the Zpacks Duplex tent when I am hiking alone.

Lewis Mountain Campground to Swift Run Gap


7:00 AM to 11:00 AM


After the storm passed by last night Nosedive and I still had a couple of hours to eat dinner and relax at our campsite at the cozy little Lewis Mountain Campground before retreating to the tent for the night. 


We hit the trail at exactly 7:00 AM with the expectation that it would take us about four hours to reach Swift Run Gap. The plan was for us to meet my awesome wife there around 11:00. She had a 2 1/2 hour drive from Pennsylvania so I suggested that she leave home around 8:30. It could not have worked out any better. She said that she arrived at the pickup point about 10 minutes before we arrived. 
If it were not for the fact that we stopped and chatted with a hiker by the name of “Trouble” for about 10 minutes we would have arrived at the gap around the same exact time as my wife. Sometimes plans do work out!


We drove to Harrisonburg, had a great meal at Chili’s and checked into a Comfort Inn. Nosedive and I scrubbed off five days worth of dirt and grime while my wife washed our stinky hiking clothes in the hotel’s guest laundry area. Is she awesome or what! Nosedive’s husband, Taylor, plans to join us for a couple of hours later this evening but cannot stay the night because they are dog sitting another family’s dog. 



The mileage today was pretty chill with only a couple of smallish climbs of 300 feet or less. Nosedive and I both felt pretty talkative with the anticipation of arriving at our “get off trail and see our spouses for an evening” point of our journey. Tomorrow we hope to get back on trail around our typical time of 7:00 AM to continue our Southbound AT thru-hike of Shenandoah National Park. Only 4 days and 45.5 miles to go.

Swift Run Gap to Pinefield Hut


7:15 AM to 2:00 PM


It was great seeing our loved ones yesterday. Nosedive’s husband (Taylor) was unable to spend the night but my wife (Kelly), Nosedive and I relaxed in the comfort of the Comfort Inn. The alarm went off at 5:30 AM this morning and we checked out, stopped by Krispy Kreme for some mountain climbing fuel, drove the 30 minutes to the Swift Run Gap trailhead and were on the trail at 7:15 at which time Kelly headed back to Pennsylvania. Thank you so much my love!


Nosedive’s feet are doing much better now. Taylor brought her a pair of Injinji toe socks to try and they felt great on her feet. We also put fresh Leuko tape on the bad spots. On top of all that, she is sporting a brand new pullover knee support that we purchased at Walmart yesterday (while we were in town) because her left knee was feeling a little tight the last couple of days. Hiking was much more enjoyable today as a result of these changes. 


We had only three significant climbs today (1,100’, 700’ and 600’) but they were particularly challenging, at least for me, because it seemed considerably warmer than previous days. Nosedive obviously has a better tolerance for the heat than me. You go girl! I have known for many years that heat is my kryptonite. I have run many ultra marathon trail races over the years and I always knew that if it was a hot day that my performance would suffer greatly. 


We passed by lots of red raspberry bushes today so of course I had to indulge on a lot of the ripe ones. Yum yum. We also enjoyed a long-ish lunch under a nice shade tree right along Skyline Drive. I even stretched out in the shade for a while using my z-fold seat as a pillow, nearly falling asleep while Nosedive waited patiently for her old man to get it in gear. Did I mention that it was hot today!


Aside from a whitetail that walked right by the shelter this evening we did not see any other wildlife. The tent sites at this shelter are sub-par due to the fact that they are all small, rocky and slanted so we are going to try out a night in the shelter tonight provided that a bunch of other hikers do not show up. As of 7:30 PM only one other hiker has shown up and he elected to set up camp on one of the tent pads. Nosedive and I are the only ones in the shelter so that is perfect. We do not have any cell service here so I will not be able to upload this journal entry until tomorrow morning.

Pinefield Hut to Blackrock Hut


6:30 AM to 3:00 PM


Nosedive and I ended up having the shelter to ourselves last night. It rained pretty hard for about an hour later in the evening so it was nice being under cover. Nosedive said that she prefers sleeping in the tent but it was nice not having to set it up. That’s pretty much the way I feel as well. Sometime during the night Nosedive and I were both awoken by some type of strange noise in or very near the shelter. I think I remember looking at my watch and it said around 2:30. I grabbed my headlamp and searched in and around the shelter and saw nothing so I guess we’ll never know what it was. 


Nosedive and I’s tootsies felt great again today so I think that the feet problems are a thing of the past. 


We had a great lunch stopover at the Loft Mountain Store today. Wonderful place with lots of liquid and food options, restrooms, showers and several picnic tables to sit and fill the bellies. And it was less than 100 yards off the trail. 


We had several very scenic views today. The most memorable was definitely Blackrock with views almost 360 degrees around. There is a short rock scramble to get to to top but it is so worth it, and I thought it was actually fun. We left our packs and trekking poles at the bottom to make the scramble a little easier and safer. 


Just like last nights shelter the tent sites at this shelter are sub-par due to the fact that they are all small, rocky and slanted so we decided to sleep in the shelter again this evening. Hopefully no strange noises will alarm us again. Nosedive saw a rat scramble under the shelter’s sleeping platform so that has her worried a bit. I’m not really fond of the idea of a rat running across my chest in the middle of the night either.


Two other hikers by the names CJ and Blaze will be sharing the site with us. One tenting and one in the shelter with Nosedive and I. They are doing the same exact section hike through Shenandoah National Park as us but in the opposite direction. Real nice guys.

Blackrock Hut to Calf Mountain Shelter 


6:45 AM to 2:15 PM


Nosedive said that she slept like a baby last night. I on the other hand kept waking up to the sound of a rat(s) scuttling around in the shelter all night. Fortunately they did not mess with any of our gear, which we had hung up in the shelter, or run across our bodies and freak us out. The fellow that shared the shelter with us did a bit of snoring but it wasn’t too bad. 


Without the convenience of a nice store to stop at for lunch today Nosedive and I just picked a nice log along the trail in a beautiful area of the mountain and feasted there. Now that I think about it I think I preferred that over the store. 



There was not much in the line of views today. The areas where we could see the valley below were obscured by a heavy haze. We saw a turkey hen right along the trail with about six young chicks scrambling around.Nosedive and I knew that there would be no water sources between the shelters today so we made sure all of our bottles were filled to the brim. We rationed our water and had just a small amount left when we arrived at a nice piped spring just .1 mile before the shelter. Much further without a water source would be troublesome. 


Calf Mountain Shelter is a pretty nice shelter but is a bit challenging getting to at the tail end of our day. It is a fairly steep 750’ climb halfway up the mountain to get to it. Nosedive remarked that steep climbs are not her friend, especially at the end of the day with tired legs. She got-r-done though! We thought for certain that we would have this shelter to ourselves tonight and were planning to sleep in the shelter but as luck would have it six young men of around 19 years of age came walking in around 5:30 pm. One of them is going to sleep in a hammock and the other five are sleeping in the shelter. Of course they are just as entitled to the shelter as Nosedive and I but were hoping that we would have it to ourselves on this last night of our journey. We decided to pitch the tent nearby on a tent pad and let the guys have the shelter to themselves. Hopefully the guys can respect hiker midnight!

Calf Mountain Shelter to Rockfish Gap


6:45 AM to 10:45 AM


Nosedive and I woke up this morning with an immediate feeling of excitement knowing that today was the day we were striving for. I am happy to say that the six young men that shared the shelter site with us last night were very respectful and quieted down as soon as it got dark so we both got a good nights sleep. 


Our final day on the trail was a rather short one but the one feature that sticks out in my mind is coming across the famous steel tractor seats mounted in the ground right beside the large communication towers on the top of Bears Den Mountain. Nosedive and I took a short break there and watched the rabbits grazing in the grass. 



The highlight of the day was undoubtedly meeting our loved ones on the trail about 1.7 miles prior to reaching Rockfish Gap! Taylor and Kelly had parked at the Gap and hiked north on the AT to meet us. It was planned so it was not a surprise but the four of us hiking together sure was a great way to end our journey.Overall I would have to say that the weather during our 9 days on the trail cooperated pretty well. Yes, most of the days were a bit warmer than I would prefer during the day but it made the evenings pleasantly cool. And Nosedive and I only had to break out our umbrellas one time and it was only for a few minutes while a shower passed by. 


Prior to parting ways and heading to our homes Nosedive, Taylor, Kelly and I decided that we had all earned a nice meal. After a quick Google search for restaurants in the area we decided on one only to find that it was closed when we arrived. Our second attempt was a place called “The River Burger Bar”. Let me just say that if you find yourself hungry while in Waynesboro, VA do yourself a favor and try it out. All of our meals were delicious! 


We all arrived home safely and for me it seems that the last nine days flew by like it was a dream. I would love to do another section hike with Nosedive (My amazing daughter) sometime in the future but she will be starting a new job real soon and her and Taylor are going to be working hard on making my wife and I grandparents. Could there be a hike or two in my future with a grandchild? I suppose we’ll just have to wait and see!


I would like to extend a great big “Thank You” to my wife and son-in-law for all of the time, energy and traveling they did to make this amazing journey with my daughter possible! I would also like to acknowledge and thank all of the folks that take the time to read my journal entries.

Holy cow, I cannot believe it has been over two months since my daughter (NoseDive) and I finished our SoBo AT section hike through Shenandoah National Park. I have been waiting patiently for my favorite season of the year to roll around before getting back out there. The weather has started to cool down and the leaves will begin changing soon. It’s time to go!


Before I hit the trail my wife (Kelly) and I are going to celebrate our 28th anniversary this coming weekend by spending a few days doing some adventurous outdoorsy stuff at a place in WV called AOTG (Adventures On The Gorge). We’ve been there a couple of times over the years and have always enjoyed our visit. The Ziplines are great and rafting the Upper Gauley during the fall Summerville Dam water release is an experience you don’t quickly forget.


When our three day adventure at AOTG is complete Kelly and I will be driving to nearby Waynesboro, VA and checking into a hotel where we will spend the night. The following day we plan to spend part of the day exploring the area together and then sometime mid afternoon she will be dropping me off at Rockfish Gap at which time I will resume my SoBo hike while Kelly heads home. Rockfish Gap is where NoseDive and I got off trail at the end of Section Hike 6. I am really going to miss having my little girl along to enjoy the experience with! As for how long/far I will be going on Section Hike 7, well, let’s just say that I do not have any particular time I have to be home so I just plan to hike until I feel I’ve had enough. I do hope to make it at least to Daleville, VA which is about 134 miles.

Kelly and I made it to Waynesboro, VA around 8:30 this evening after having a great mini vacation at Adventures On The Gorge. The entire visit was a load of fun. We started our adventure on Saturday by spending 3 hours on their Timber Trek obstacle course. Some may suggest that I am too old for this but I felt that I was totally in my element wrangling my way from tree to tree. Kelly enjoyed it too but decided not to stay on the course as long as I did. Sunday we soared high and fast on the Gravity Zipline which is ranked by Travel & Leisure Magazine as one of the top 10 coolest Ziplines in the world. Definitely lives up to it’s reputation. The highlight was today when we rafted the infamous Upper Gauley section of the Gauley River. Tons of whitewater fun with lots of class 3’s, 4’s and even a few 5’s. One of the most exciting and challenging runs on the east coast. We filled in the time gaps over the weekend by venturing out from AOTG and checking out the New River Gorge and the nearby town of Fayetteville, WV. Threw a few good meals in there too. 


Tomorrow we plan to sleep in a bit and then spend a little time checking out Waynesboro. Kelly will be dropping me off at the Rockfish Gap trailhead, only 5 miles from Waynesboro, sometime mid-afternoon where we will be saying our goodbyes AGAIN and I will be heading southbound on the AT with the expectation that I will only be hiking about 5 miles the 1st day.

Rockfish Gap to Paul C. Wolfe Shelter


12:30 PM to 2:10 PM


First and most importantly - Saying goodbye to my wife is always hard and this afternoon was no exception! Especially immediately after spending 24 hours a day for several days having a wonderful time playing in the outdoors. And when I’m not thinking of my wife I’m often thinking of how much I miss having my little Nosedive along to share the experience with. I love and miss you gals bunches!! 


My wife and I checked out of the luxurious Super 8 around 9 o’clock, snooped around Waynesboro a bit, played 18 holes of miniature golf, filled up the car with fuel, stopped at the Cracker Barrel for lunch and were at the AT trailhead at Rockfish Gap by about 12:15. We took a couple of pictures, said our goodbyes and I was on the trail at 12:30. 


In addition to being a short day the terrain was pretty easy so it did not take long to get to the shelter that I had planned to spend the night at. The weather forecast predicted showers on and off today but I never felt a drop. I’ll bet that I’m not going to be so lucky the next few days. No worries, I’ve got my handy dandy umbrella. 



The Paul C. Wolfe shelter is a really nice shelter nestled in a hollow with a wonderful sounding mountain stream running right next to it. I love camping near streams. I love the sound and it sure makes it easy to replenish my cooking and water supply.When I arrived at the shelter a little after 2 o’clock in the afternoon there were 2 young guys by the name of Patrick and Conner packing up their stuff to head out. I could not believe the amount of gear/supplies that they had strewn all over the floor of the shelter. They admitted to me that their packs weighed 70 pounds each when they started their hike. They are now down to 50 pounds each but even that sounds torturous to me. No wonder they are not getting very far very fast. I will never go on an extended hike with more than 30 pounds. They had spent the night at the shelter last night and apparently, like me, intended to make a short day of it because they did not head out until 3. I had a great time talking with them. They were brothers and they had started their long section hike at Harpers Ferry and had hoped to get to the southern terminus at Springer Mountain in Georgia by Christmas. Good luck with that! 


As of right now, 6:30 PM, there are no other hikers at the shelter. Even so, I elected to set up camp closer to the stream at a nice tenting area.


Tomorrow’s hike will be significantly longer than today’s at 15.8 miles but there are no ball busting climbs. I will have an 800’ climb immediately after leaving the shelter and a 1,500’ shortly after that. The last 9 miles look relatively easy. Piece of cake, right?

Paul C. Wolfe Shelter to Maupin Field Shelter 


5:45 AM to 12:45 PM



The skies decided to open up around 8:00 last night in a big way. Fortunately I had already gotten comfortable in my tent and stayed quite dry. The rain pounded on my tent for 3 hours before it subsided to a lighter intensity. This was one night where it may have been a wiser choice to stay in the shelter.
It was still raining lightly and dark when I got up this morning so I packed up my gear in the rain and hit the trail with my headlamp on. It rained with varying intensity right up until just before I got to the shelter where I planned to spend the night. Go figure. Being soaked all day really did not feel that bad though. It helped keep me cool. 


I was considering staying in the shelter tonight but around 2:30 in the afternoon 3 middle aged guys came walking in and said “mind if we join you”.  I prefer not to sleep in the shelter when there are other hikers present for several reasons. Main one being that I get up so early and hate to disturb anyone. So I found a nice flat tenting area and set up camp there. 


Not much else to speak of for today. Tomorrow I have the biggest day yet at 20.4 miles and 6,300’ of climbing. I will be going up over a mountain called the Priest which is a 3,100’ climb itself. I hope that my legs hold up. 



There is no cell service at this shelter so hopefully I can get this journey entry out tomorrow.Onward We Go,

Maupin Field Shelter to VA 56


6:20 AM to 11:10 AM


I should have stayed in the shelter with those 3 guys last night because just like the night before the skies decided to open up and with just as much if not more ferocity. I guess I’ll never learn. This time it was around 7:00 PM when it started. It rained all night and again, just like the night before, I packed up my gear, including my dirty/gritty tent which was splashed filthy by the pounding rain, in the rain and hit the trail before daylight. 


I saw my first young whitetail buck today. He was standing right on the AT as I rounded a bend. That really perked me up a bit. 


I suppose the Priest will have to wait for another day because I felt compelled to terminate Section Hike 7 at VA 56 because of a health issue. Just prior to beginning this hike I had blood drawn because I had been feeling tired and weak quite a bit lately. I received a text  message during a brief period that  I had cell service at the top of Three Ridges Mountain that informed me that the results of the blood test indicated that I had “Equivocal” Lyme Disease. I am not sure exactly what that means but my health care provider prescribed me a three week supply of antibiotics. 


I though hard about my circumstances as I descended the 3,000’ down to VA 56 and decided that it was in my best interest to go home. When I arrived at the highway there was zero cell service so I stuck out my thumb and the very first vehicle that came by stopped. When the driver asked me where I needed to get to I replied “Anywhere with cell service”. According to him the nearest place with cell service was an Exxon station 6 miles down the road and that he would be happy to take me there. So I threw my pack in the back of his truck and and my mildewed body in the passenger seat and off we went. Sure enough when we got there I had service, weak but service. I handed him a few bucks for his trouble and off he went. I then called my understanding wife and then presto, 3 1/2 hours later she was there to pick me up. We stopped at our local pharmacy on the way home and picked up my prescription. 


Until next time,
