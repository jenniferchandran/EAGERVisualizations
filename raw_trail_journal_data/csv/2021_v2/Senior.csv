Senior,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632342,"The primary purpose of this entry and the next few, is to figure out whether journaling is something I can do while on the trail using only my phone. I’m 60 years old and I’m not fast with my thumbs on the phone keyboard. So I will be dictating all my entries. In preparation for this hike I watched two YouTube series from start to finish of the trail by  Chris Barry and Chica and Sunsets. Chris Barry has a very humble and straightforward with primarily trail footage. Chica and Sunsets are also very humble and presented a very comprehensive and well organized series of videos from Amicalola Falls to Mount Katahdin. One of chica and sunsets features was a weekly wrap-up that broke down the costs and how they spent their time and money on the trail.My favorite book on the trail was Whistler’s Walk by William Monk. I also read Appalachian Trials by Zack Davis and Awol on the Appalachian Trail by David Miller. Enough for post 1.",,View Entry,"Jan 20, Wed",0
Senior,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632373,"In a sense I’ve been preparing to hike the Appalachian Trail for the last six years. In 2016 my youngest son and I hiked the first 77 miles of the PCT northbound from the Mexican border to  scissors crossing which is near Julian, in California. We enjoyed it immensely especially the sense of community that developed between us and a group of other hikers. When we said goodbye to Matt, Matt, and Andrew. We made sure they had our contact information because we live in Tehachapi, California at about mile 550. A month later we took care of them for a few days. I try to always be an angel even though I can only be a hiker part time.The following year I  did the John Muir Trail section of the PCT and then followed it up with another 85 miles between Tehachapi Pass and Walker pass. Every year after that I hiked between 400 & 550 miles. I have now done over 1800 miles of the PCT. This year I managed to get 350 in before the fires at the end of the summer closed all the national forests in CA. I had already set two weeks aside to hike some more so I ended up driving out to Georgia and hiking from Amicolola falls state park to Fontana Dam. During this hike I got to hike in the rain and see what it was like to put on wet clothes in the morning and keep hiking. I also got to see what it was like to spend the night in a shelter. I found the Appalachian trail to be a wonderful green experience as compared to most of the Pacific crest Trail. As of this moment it looks like my wife will be driving me out to Georgia the end of March. And I really hope she doesn’t get lost on those back roads near Springer Mountain on her way out. That’s enough for practice post two.",,View Entry,"Jan 23, Sat",0
Senior,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632825,"I was a “Senior” during my last year of High School at the age of 17. “Senior” was a title I was given at the age of 35 when I became a supervisor in an organization full of 20 somethings and became a mentor to them.
Senior was at the age of 50 when the AARP started sending me applications. (I rejected their definition of “senior” as an attempt to collect dues from a potential 21 million more members.)
Senior is age 55 at Albertson’s Market to qualify for the senior price discount but during the early days of Covid, the “senior only” line for Toilet Paper required you to be 65.
The US Government, in an attempt to reduce the number of potential customers, says Medicare benefits don’t start until age 65, and my full social security benefits start at age 67. At age 62 you can get a “Senior Citizen” National Parks Pass”
By what definition is anyone SENIOR?
Merriam Webster online dictionary defines Senior Citizen as:” an elderly person especially: one who has retired” and provides the following synonyms, “ancient, elder, geriatric, golden-ager, oldster, old-timer, and senior. “Is that really me?
I turned 60 last August and don’t feel any of those terms describe me but if I want to believe the numbers put out by the Administration on Aging I am now older than 77% of the US population. That makes me senior to the majority of other Americans. According to “thetrek.co” thru-hikers age 60+ were older than 90% of rest of the other thru-hikers on the Appalachian Trail in 2018.
I have wanted to hike the Appalachian Trail since I was in Junior High and first read about it. I am hoping to start my attempt at an AT through Hike this April. If I do my trail name will be “Senior” and one thing I hope to accomplish is to demonstrate that “Seniors can.” My apologies in advance to all seniors if I don’t make it ;)",,View Entry,"Feb 26, Fri",0
Senior,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633630,"I have been planning to hike the entire Appalachian Trail from Springer to Katahdin. I know anything can happen before I start let alone finish the hike as I would like to end it. I submit this plan to God as I hope I submit everyday to Him. Why do I take something like this more serious than a trip to Home Depot or the post office? Isn't God actively involved in all our daily activities from mundane to exciting? I guess I focus more on Him and His involvement in this project than a trip to the hardware store because it is a big step out of my sphere of perceived control. I consider the trip a good exercise in depending on Him. For some reason it is easier to feel dependent on Him for the next water or food supply and general safety in the woods than at home. It shouldn't be that way.My wife Carol and I will board a plane in one week and fly to North Carolina, rent a car, and visit relatives for several days. On April 3rd she will drop me off at Springer Mtn. or Amicalola Falls SP and I will start walking north while she  returns home. I am excited. I am packed. I have organized my home affairs as best as possible to make things easier on her while I am gone. What else can I do?
""A man’s heart plans his way, But the Lord directs his steps."" Proverbs
""Come now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go into such and such a town and spend a year there and trade and make a profit”— yet you do not know what tomorrow will bring. What is your life? For you are a mist that appears for a little time and then vanishes. Instead you ought to say, “If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that.” James
I hope to see you on the trail. I hope this will be the last pre-hike post. See you here again in April.",,View Entry,"Mar 22, Mon",0
Senior,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634255,"Day 1 started at Springer Mtn. mile 0, ended at mile 15.5 a stealth site before Gouch Gap Shelter. Total miles 15.5 My wife Carol bravely consented to drive me up to the Springer Mountain parking lot for the Appalachian Trail. We said goodbye about about 9 o’clock and she turned around and headed back down that long gravel road. I walked the mile over to Springer Mountain and signed the logbook. I snapped a few photos of the pages ahead of mine so I could get to know some of the folks who I might run into along the trail.As I made my way back to the parking lot about five cars pulled in at the same time and at least half a dozen hikers got out to start their trip. I only know for sure that one of them is intending to through hike. He had parents and grandparents there to see him off and they were commenting on how long it would be before they saw him again. There was also some kind of a volunteer from the ATC trying to collect information from those headed up the trail. I chose not to participate in his survey.I ran into a couple other senior hiker guys named Mike and Craig they’re planning on going as far as Tennessee. We passed each other leapfrogging several times before we parted ways near Cooper gap. The day was pleasantly warm and I was down to my T-shirt by 10:30 AM.I had several firsts today for this trip, first doing business in the woods, and first trail magic put on by the Appalachian adventure society from Atlanta Georgia they were at the cemetery and we’re grilling hotdogs and had tons of snacks and drinks. As the sun started to get low I stopped at a creek to cook dinner at 5:30. I filled up my water and told myself I’d stop at the next good looking tent site. About half an hour down the trail I spotted a place a ways off the trail on what might’ve been a logging road at one time. I’m just a hop skip and a jump from Gooch gap shelter but I have complete privacy. Tomorrow is Easter! He has risen!","Springer Mountain

Senior,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634305,"I was awake around 0630 and was surprised that it was not light yet. I figured it must be getting light soon so I went ahead and cooked myself oatmeal and a cuppa coffee. Sure enough by seven it was light enough to start packing up and by 7:38 I was walking. As I passed Gooch gap shelter, I saw about 9 tents and hammocks. When I got to Gooch gap proper I saw About the same number. Not many people were staring yet. The oatmeal and coffee served me well for at least the first 5 miles. I then became motivated by the idea that I might be able to make it to Mountain Crossing before they closed at 5 PM. I kept moving along at a steady pace and made it to Mountain Crossing also Neels Gap before 4 PM. Even though it was Easter Sunday it was open and doing quite a business. All I needed was lip balm, Sunscreen, a ham and cheese sandwich and a Coke. That fueled me up. as I exited the store I saw the hiker boxes. Of course there was some sunscreen in one of them. The box is also contained and almost brand new backpack numerous fuel canisters, a number of food items, and two sleeping pads. You honestly could’ve outfitted yourself and started the hike right there if you already had a sleeping bag on the stove. Even though it was 4:30 and I’d done 15 miles I couldn’t imagine setting up camp nearby and just hanging around for four more hours of daylight. I got moving again and made it to Tesnatee gap giving me a total mileage have a little over 21 for the day. I had two spiritual conversations with people today one was while eating my sub sandwich a woman commented on a wristband I was wearing quoted Matthew chapter 5 verse five. The other conversation was with a through hike or what I suspect I’ll be running into again he has a strong pace and we were hiking for a bit together today it’s surrounded the idea that today was Easter and deserve to be celebrated at least in our minds and hearts in some special way. I don’t hike fast I just takes daddy and I did not get my tent up today until it was dark. Pray that I’m able to keep moving tomorrow. I hope to learn how to upload photographs into this for the next few entries.","Stealth Camp near Gooch Gap mile15.5

Senior,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634404,"This narrative covers today Tuesday, April 6 and Monday, April 5. On Monday, April 5 I started at Tenatsee Gap mile 37.3 and hiked to the old cheese factory mile 56.3. The last 4 -5 miles was the roughest. When I arrived at Unicoi Gap at about three in the afternoon, I was hailed by a shuttle driver (unofficial Uber that works the Appalachian Trail) asking if I wanted a ride into Hiawassee, GA. She was just waiting there hoping to catch a fare but I was determined to not get off trail until I got to Franklin, North Carolina. 200 yards up that hill I started wondering if that shuttle driver was still there and if I ran back could I get a ride into town. However I soon found a water source, took a break, drank a bunch of water, ate a snack, and survived to go to the rest of the distance to the old cheese factory site. I found about nine people camped, some sitting around a campfire visiting cooking food one of the favorites was spam on a stick. Demographics? All white males, four were 60 years old or older the rest were 20 somethings. I have seen a number of females on the trail and a couple hikers of color but probably less than five so far. The talking ran kind of late for a couple of them but it finally stopped at about 9:30 and I managed to sleep until about 6:30. The next morning I got water and said goodbye to Ram (that’s his trail name) as he stuck his head out of his hammock, it was about 7:30.During the course of Tuesday I met and visited with James and Marshall. A couple of guys who are native to Virginia and recently graduated from college. They told me they stayed at the budget inn in Hiawassee and got there from Unicoi Gap. The rooms at 50 bucks apiece including Shuttle’s to and from the trail at Unicoi Gap and Dicks Gap, (where we would be arriving in just a couple more hours).I’m afraid that’s about all it took for me to call the budget inn and arrange for a ride in on the shuttle from Dick’s gap. That’s still gave me 13 miles for the day. I was picked up a little after four checked in by 4:30 and was devouring pizza and a salad from the Dominoes Pizza (practically next-door) in short order. There were a lot of other hikers there and it was a friendly bunch and we visited for about half an hour while I waited for my room to finish being prepared. One of the hikers I’ve visited with has the Trail name of Huck. He has a very strong southern accent and the name really fits.My stomach is full, it’s after 7:30, I’m starting to fall asleep so that’s it for now. Oh, I hope to catch the 9 o’clock shuttle back to the trail in the morning.","Tenatsee Gap

Senior,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634506,"Wednesday morning April 7 started started with breakfast at a little place next to the budget Inn in the town of Hiawassee and  a shuttle ride back to Dick’s Creek gap where I was picked up yesterday in the afternoon.It was kind of a late start as hiking days ago 9:30 but at some point late in the day I crossed the North Carolina and Georgia boundary entering North Carolina. That was one of the high points of the trip so far, First state done! I was hoping to catch up with an acquaintance I made on the trail who goes by the name Ram. He took this name from a character in one of his favorite movies, “state troopers” a comedy which I haven’t seen but saw a review on it, it’s too silly to watch with my wife. Maybe I’ll get a chance to watch it in a hotel room during this trip.Ram had started up this trail intending to hike a few miles before setting up camp yesterday afternoon when the van picked me up. I hiked pretty steadily for about 11 hours and just as it was getting dark enough to use my headlamp I saw a hammock  suspended between two trees. I know Ram uses a hammock, he’s not the only one but one of the few. So I called out “is that Ram?”The reply, “is that Gramps?” That might end up becoming my new trail name, I’ll keep you posted.I set my tent up in Beach gap just a couple hundred yards past Ram and realized I hiked 21.2 miles that day. Following morning today was predicted to rain around 10. I wanted to get an early start and hike as many miles as I could rain free, so I was on the trail by seven. Ram told me he planned on sleeping till nine so I didn’t expect to see him again. I had told him I planned to get off Trail in Franklin and that Rock Gap 16 miles away would be an easy place to get a ride from. I knew he was considering it for himself. We exchanged phone numbers.Sometime around noon I got a text from Ram, he was only a few miles behind me and was trying to catch up. I passed the hundred mile mark the first hundred miles of the trail and stop to make lunch just as I got back on the trail Ram caught up to me and lo and behold we were only about half a mile from Rock Gap. When we got to Rocky gap we found  the organization responsible for trail maintenance in the area was giving away pizza and fruit. Two pieces of pizza later a shuttle van pulled up and we got a ride for five dollars apiece to the Microtel. An excellent deal for 45 bucks each per night. We had dinner at Wendy’s and I think will be going to bed here pretty quick. It was an excellent day it did rain and that’s part of what you have to expect when you’re hiking on the Appalachian Trail. Tomorrow is supposed to be a zero day for us we’re going to do laundry re-supply at the local Ingles market and get back on the trail Saturday. If you like seeing pictures follow me on Instagram “seniorboyd” I still haven’t figured out how to get pictures from my phone into this journal. But I try to post at least one a day on Instagram","Dick’s Creek Gap mile 69.2

Senior,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634603,"My current hiking partner, Ram, and I spent all day Friday in the town of Franklin, NC. We spent Thursday night and Friday night at the Microtel. That cost us each about $90 for the two nights. It came with a continental breakfast that consisted simply of those homemade waffles. There was syrup to put on them and butter packets. No milk, juice, yogurt, or fruit. There was coffee lots of it.on Friday we divided the chores I took all the dirty clothes to a laundry mat washed and dried them and walked back by way of Lowe’s where I picked up a mouse trap that I thought might be useful in the shelters and some extra hose gaskets that Ram thought he might need for his water filtration system. Ram went to the Ingles grocery store and did our resupply shopping we spent much of the day resting and eating and preparing for the next week of hiking by letting our bodies Rejuvenate. One of the most important things I thought I needed to do during this break was repair my shoes. I was able to get the shoe cement at the adventure 76 store. The lady who drove the public transportation bus we got on Thursday afternoon was willing to stop by it and let us run in while we were on our way to the hotel. So far it looks like the repair is holding.Friday evening for dessert we decide we wanted Wendy’s Frosty’s. The problem was the Wendy’s dining room was closed for some reason. So we got in the drive-through line walking and they did eventually get talked into taking our order. I know my wife would’ve been very embarrassed. But Ram is a very attractive congenial and friendly 25-year-old and he talked the ladies at the drive-through window into selling us what we wanted even though we weren’t in a car. We located a shuttle driver Friday night who agreed to pick us up this morning, Saturday morning at 8:30. For $25 she took us both from the Microtel out to rock gap and dropped us off. The day was cool breezy and overcast and by noon it was raining pretty good. within an hour or two I felt like I was soaked and there was no way to stop for a break without hypothermia setting in and by that point there was only two or 3 miles left to the shelter that was our goal for the evening. We just had to keep walking. We made it to that shelter and with the two of us made a total of eight people and a dog. After a lot of hemming and Hawing among the group I suggested that we could probably fit twice that many in the shelter if we all laid on our sides nuts to butts. I got them chuckling and everyone agreed to kind of mark out their space and try not to take more than 18 inches each. Ram set up his hammock in the shelter the other seven of us all down on the platform with the dog. The rain stopped about five and we’re all just hanging around visiting waiting for it to get late enough to justify crawling into bed and trying to go to sleep for 10 hours or more. It’s been a great group of people. Two of the people in this group are in their 70s. One has done a lot of mountain climbing is an engineer and has widely traveled he has quite a few stories but he’s very humble and wouldn’t have told us a single story if he had been prompted by a few questions it was very worthwhile. Another member of our shelter is a lobster man from Maine who is hiking back home from Georgia. A couple of military vets And Ram and I round out the group. Tomorrow we hope to make it to the NOC before dinner time, it’s about 16 miles away at mile 136.7. It was a wonderful day and I am thankful for it.","Rock Gap mile105.7

Senior,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634657,"I was surprised when I woke up at 6:30 this morning to find that I had a good sleep and it was already light. My nearest neighbor in the shelter who’s Trail name is Meat Popsicle (I didn’t ask him how he got that name) had moved to a hammock just outside the shelter. It had stopped raining about 6 PM and it was a little crowded in the shelter. It then became obvious the person snoring next to me last night was not the guy meat popsicle but a female hiker named Otter. I was raised pretty sheltered but by age 60 I have learned, ladies do: burp, fart, and snore. I quietly extracted myself from the shelter and managed to get on the trail before 730 I did not make any breakfast but ate a granola bar as I walked. About the time I was thinking I would stop and heat up coffee and oatmeal, I arrived at mile 124 “burning town gap” and found a ministry organization supplying hard boiled eggs, candy, the gospel, and prayer support to anyone who wanted it. I really enjoyed visiting  and fellowshiping with them especially since it was Sunday. As I left them, I plugged in my earbuds and listen to J Vernon McGee preaching through Genesis chapters 20 through 24. I followed up by listening to worship music produced by the group 2nd Chapter of Acts.If you’re not familiar with through the Bible radio you should check them out on the Internet ttb.org they have an app available for the iPhone and probably android. My father, I, and a friend named Ben have been meeting Monday through Friday mornings and listening to a 25 minute message. The program teaches through the entire Bible, over a five-year period and it is starting in Genesis again now.As our day continued we hit Wasser bald where there is an observation tower that you can climb. I did not climb up there but that’s where I reconnected with Ram. From there we hiked on more or less together for the next 6 miles till we got to the Nantahala outdoor center. The NOC provides river canoeing and kayaking training and a variety of other recreational activities they have housing, a bar, general store, outfitter, and a restaurant. After having a burger and fries and picking up a couple items at the general store we continued our hike about one more mile finishing a day at an unmarked campsite at mile 138 giving us 17.55 miles for the day. Starting to get nightMy partner Ram would like to finish the smoky mountains before he has to stop hiking a week from today. He did the math and figures will have to do 17 miles a day for the next seven days. I don’t think we should have a problem with that unless one of us develop some kind of an injury. Read all about it here sometime down the line. I think we’re planning on making it to Cody Gap 18 miles from here tomorrow.","Wayah Bald Shelter mile 120.4
",Mile 138,"Apr 11, Sun",17.55
Senior,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634725,"Yesterday one of the high points was visiting the Nantahala Outdoor Center. The NOC is a real sports complex with all the amenities including in general store, restaurant, bar, and outfitter, and classrooms transportation for students up and down the river etc. One anecdote from yesterday; while my partner Ram was running an errand at the outfitters another hiker named Isaac and I grabbed a sports bra out of the hiker box (A box of surplus items that hikers don’t need but still have value to other hikers) and tucked into his backpack.When Ram returned  from the outfitter with his purchase he found the bra and we started teasing him about where he got it. No sooner had he thrown it into the hiker box than a female hiker came running up glanced in the box, grabbed the bra and excitedly told us it was just what she was looking for, now she could go swimming. All we could do, was laugh.This morning we started our hike on the early side with the goal of making 18 miles to a place called Cody gap which had water source and tent space. The day ended up being kind of long but it was broken very nicely when we got to Stecoah Gap. Along the way, I had noticed several times, wet spots in the middle of the trail. Wet spots on the trail had been fairly common but because there’s been so much rain it was easy to put it off on just moisture from the ground coming up. However It’s  been dry now for two days and there’s been a number of wet spots in the trail that I could not reconcile with the dryness of the surrounding earth. As I descended into Stecoah my mind turn to hunting lessons for tracking elk in the snow, how you could tell if tracks were left by a bull or a cow by the way they urinate and that’s when it hit me the wet spots in the trail were left by ??? The puzzles your mind turns to solving while you hike?!When we arrived at Stecoah gap we found a trail Angel, worker, and hiker named Pak-Man. He had a box full of supplies and goodies for us apples, cinnamon rolls, cookies, granola bars, and numerous other food items including instant coffee packets. He also an ice chest with cold Mountain Dew. We visited with him for at least 30 minutes while we enjoyed our Mountain Dew before continuing our hike. Heading north from Stecoah gap it was very steep I think the area is called Jacobs ladder or stairway to heaven or something like that. And it deserves that name but we only had about 5 miles to go to make it to our destination for the day. When we got there we found a wonderful place to hang Rams Hammock and for me to set up my tent not far from a babbling Brook. Tomorrow we get to enter the Smoky Mountain national Park and we are looking forward to it. It looks like a 16 1/2 mile day. The options for camping in the park are limited and that is the one that is about the most reasonable distance for us to shoot for. It was a wonderful day and we had a lot to thank the Lord for before we crawled in our tent and Hammock.","Mile 138

Senior,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634903,"Cody gap tent area was Nice it was very windy up at the gap where most of the people set up their tents. Ram and I found a very nice area down near the water source that had a lot less wind and was pretty quiet because we didn’t have a bunch of other hikers camped around us. The next day we put in about 17 1/2 miles and one of our highlights was stopping at the Fontana Dam marina for lunch. It was a late lunch but we got to put our feet in the cold water, Heat up frozen sandwiches they had there for sale and met a few hikers this is where I met Portrait  for the first time and another hike or named Geo.  Geo was taking tobacco out of a cigarette and putting marijuana in because he could not find rolling papers.we continued our hike from the Fontana damn marina and shortly there after and the Smoky Mountain national Park our first campsite was at Birch Spring gap and it was quite a competition for campsites tent sites as you’re only allowed to set up your tent in specific areas. this has a tendency to concentrate tigers in specific locations rather than spreading them out and it creates a bear magnet. Following day we put in another roughly 1718 miles and spent the night of the 14th at Derek knob Shelter it was raining it started raining about 30 minutes before I got there I want to the experience of sitting at like 10 sleeping in the rain. The shelter did have some room but I wanted some privacy. Once I got the tent up and got in it I just stayed in there the rest of the night. ram was kind enough to stop by and say good night for the tent flap we bumped fists. By 6:30 in the morning the rain is stopped the trees were still dripping and there was a light fog. I started hiking about 730 and after about seven or 8 miles Abigail he helicopter areBy 6:30 in the morning the rain is stopped the trees were still tripping and there was a light fog. I started hiking about 730 and after about seven or 8 miles I began hearing helicopters circling as I approach double spring gap shelter the helicopter was right overhead and I learned that a 59-year-old man was being taken out by helicopter for treatment of a stroke. A few hours later I was on Klement down highest point on the AT. It was also mile 200.1 so we successfully knocked out our second hundred miles of the trail. On the top of Clingmans Dome there is a big ramped observation tower. I went up, took some pictures came back down and had a little bit of lunch. There were a lot of other people there but they were all day hikers or folks that just driven up and only walked from the parking lot. They looked at me like I was in the zoo. I was the only person with a large backpack in the area the entire time I was there.when I started hiking again it was probably around one and that was a little concerned because ram had not caught up to me and it occurred to me that he might’ve stayed on the Appalachian Trail rather than deviate to go out to the observation tower so I picked up my pace only to find out later he was on my way to line me. As I got into newfound gap where Highway 441 out of Gatlinburg  crosses the Appalachian Trail. I was approached by a really friendly guy named Hayden Hayden asked me if I wanted to ride to town and some donuts. I told him yes and waited for Ram. it was wonderful drive down to Gatlinburg but it took kind of a long time during that time we found out that Hayden was just hired to be a guide and instructor by the NOC on the French Broad River for the year. Congratulations Hayden. We got a night and a cheap hotel in Gatlinburg there really is no cheap hotel. A hundred dollars per night for a weekday is about the cheapest you can get. Pizza and salad was our dinner and then we slept. I hope to have data tonight I will update every evening that I have data access. We have about 34 miles to go to get to where the Appalachian trail crosses I 40. And that’s where I’ll be saying goodbye to my hiking partner Ram. I am also hoping to connect with some old friends who used to live in Tehachapi and have moved to Knoxville. It’s also where the famous Shelter called standing Bear farm is.Back to those wet spots in the trail about 80% of the hikers on the trail are equipped from birth to stream their urine off the trail even though they might be standing on it, no matter how steep or brush the sides of the trailer. The other 20% have no choice but to squat in the middle of the trail under certain circumstances. Again sorry for any typos or bad grammar I’m dictating on my cell phone and trying to double check myself as I prepare to leave the hotel this morning, Friday the 16th","Cody Gap mile 156

Senior,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634931,"We spent last night in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. Cheapest hotel we could find, there is no cheap hotel in Gatlinburg, was the crossroad Inn and suites. We walked down the street for pizza they did have a guest laundry 1.50 to wash and 1.50 to dry. Our Trail Angel, Hayden picked us up about 9 o’clock and drove us back up to newfound gap. We met another hiker named quads and started down the trail. We were getting started a little later than usual and we’re glad we only had about 16 miles to our goal which was tri-corner knob shelter. At some point during the day we passed the 218 mile mark giving us our first 10% of the trail. We hope tomorrow to complete the 18 miles that separates us from the somewhat trail famous Standing Bear Hostel.Also during the day we met our first ATC Trail runner. She reminded us that Cosby knob shelter was closed due to bear activity. She also warned us that there would be a crowd at Tricorner knob Shelter and suggested we move a little farther up the trail to find space. Just up the trail about 500 feet is the equestrian area which does have a number of flat enough areas to set up tents and it’s own fire pit. Ram and I talked away the day solving all the worlds problems and debating complex issues such as abortion, Capital punishment, euthanasia, and evolution. Tomorrow will be my last day hiking with Ram, he is getting a ride to Knoxville on Monday morning from a friend from standing Bear hostel. I will be taking a zero day. At least that’s the plan for now. We are camped at about 5500 feet the air is cool I suspect it might get down to freezing tonight. I’m looking forward to tomorrow night at Under 2000 feet. Everyone is already in their beds and it’s still light. There’s quite a crowd at the actual hostile and I can still hear noise coming from over there, kind of a young party crowd. Pictures posted on Instagram “seniorboyd”. I am however now pleased to be “Gramps” on the AT.","Newfound Gap

Senior,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635134,"I woke up after 630. That’s kind of late for me. The sky was already gray and I could hear birds. It was a little cool, I heated water for instant coffee, oatmeal, and ate a granola bar. Once packed up, I refilled my water bottles at the nearby spring. Because the day was cool I had  no doubt I’d be able to make it to Hot Springs on the 2 L I was carrying. Do bears poop in the woods? I’ve never seen it happen but I’ve seen the evidence. Do hikers poop in the woods? I’ve seen the evidence and today I saw it happening. I didn’t realize what was happening until after I had shouted a greeting. The lady, was not far off trail and most of the bushes, which later in the year might screen her from the trail, had not yet leafed out. She just kept her head down and pretended she was invisible. At that point I was wishing I was invisible. No doubt if it had been a bear I would’ve got out my cell phone and tried to record the incident. Now all I could do was try and figure out, do I apologize now? next time I see her? Do I pretend the incident ever happened? I have no doubt that if she was part of that group known as “the dirty bubble” (see post on standing Bear farm at hostel) she would’ve just “smiled and waved”. I’m guessing with this lady would be better if I said nothing and pretended I never saw her before.
After about three hours I got to a place called Garenflo gap. There was a mother and four or five kids there and since it was the middle of Monday I couldn’t help asking if they were homeschoolers, they were. I then asked if they were believers, they were! We talked about the trail as a ministry and I was invited to look them up  when I get closer to Harpers Ferry. They love to host hikers as a ministry. We exchanged contact info and I’m trying to get together with them for coffee or breakfast tomorrow, they are staying in Hot Springs.
Shortly after leaving my new friends, I was overtaken by Time Snake. He is fast. He camped almost 4 miles behind me and got started at the same time, yet in about four hours he over took me. 
He slowed down a bit and I probably picked up my pace and  we kept up a pretty good discussion for the last hour into town. We agreed to meet later for lunch.
I checked into my hostel, Took a shower, changed into a set of the clothes They keep for people washing their clothes, and washed and hung my clothes up. I made up my shopping list and then went through the hiker boxes the hostel has, digging out what was on my list for free. I managed to score at least half a dozen items. Then I connected with Time Snake and got a burger. We also hit the outfitters where I bought another pair of sock liners and a small fuel canister. Next was the hillbilly market. I had a fair shopping list to re-supply but quickly figured out that the dollar general would probably have better prices for most of what I needed (tomorrow). I did get an orange and a cup of yogurt which I was especially craving. Next up, back to the hostel to catch up on my journal entries. I hope you’ve enjoyed them. I will try to get a few more photos uploaded to seniorboyd on Instagram. No hiking tomorrow, just resting these legs and eating.","Walnut mountain shelter 261.8

Senior,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635182,"as I dictate this post from my private room in the Hostel I can hear the squeals of delight as hikers who know each other from various parts of the last 250+ miles are seeing each other again here and being reunited at this Hostel.
My morning started by getting a breakfast sandwich and a pint of milk at hillbilly market. And then went next-door to the dollar general To finish my resupply shopping. Granola bars, tortillas, a few more items for dinner meals, a large nail file for my toes, and ibuprofen. 
I was invited to dinner by some folks I met on the trail Monday. A nice Christian homeschool family who happens to be spending a few days in Hot Springs and I’m gonna go pick up some ice cream and head over there now I will add more to this post later.Later: dinner with Redwing, Hopeful, and there four kids was great. It was nice to have some Christian fellowship. I got to sit next to their five year old daughter who drew a picture for me.","Hot Springs, NC

Senior,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635455,A nice long hike. I Tried to keep up with Time Snake. it was cold windy and rained a little bit. I thought if I stopped I’d Freeze. the shelter was full and that was fine because you’re actually warmer your tent. Time Snake taught me to sleep with my rain gear on inside my sleeping bag. I was warm and passed the night just fine. Keeping this short because I’m playing catch-up and three days behind.,"Hot Springs, NC

Senior,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635457,"This might be the longest day yet. I was very unsure of whether I wanna stay at hogback Ridge shelter because it’s higher than little Laurel and it was so cold there. However when I got time for a bridge shelter I found that the shelter and tenting area was down off the ridge and had little or no wind. It was still cold. I rinsed out my underwear and threw it up on the tent to dry overnight. When I brought it in, in the morning it was a stiff as cardboard. I had to wear my rain gear to bed my sleeping bag again to stay warm. When I got to the shelter area I saw Time Snakes tent set up. it’s always an accomplishment to be able to keep up with him.","Little Laurel shelter

Senior,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635458,"Hiker midnight I’ll edit and add more later.It’s now noonish on the 24th. Yesterday was a long day. I woke up at about six, was on the trail by seven, only two people we’re up whispering outside the shelter. My Trail companion of late, Trail Snake, was already gone. We had talked about shooting for uncle Johnny’s 26.3 miles down the trail  the day before. The trail went up a little bit and then after while headed down then worked its way back up to a place called big bald. I met another hiker wearing  glasses whose name was “professor”. Going down the North side of big bald was muddy. In fact the mud appeared in the trail often over the next 5 miles. At some point I noticed it was 2 o’clock and I still had 11 miles to go. I didn’t stop for lunch but munched bars while walking, probably not enough. There was plenty of water on the trail and I was staying hydrated. I made it to a very interesting rock formation and met a troop of Girl Scouts headed up. About three or 4 miles later I saw where their cars were parked at a paved road crossing. About half a mile after that road crossing I got to a bridge over a creek and ran into three other hikers named Tin, Pinch, and Pistol. Pistol was a female and was wearing a little fanny pack. I made some joke about her getting her name for what she’s caring in her fanny pack. There was no denial and just a little chuckle. Basically an admission of guilt. I totally approve!The trail was pretty fast, that is smooth and not real steep up or down for the last 8 miles, bringing you to a great view of the Nolichucky River. I managed to get into Uncle Johnny’s Hostel by 6 pm and got the last bunk. Time Snake was waiting there. Serious Rain is expected tomorrow so the idea of a zero was possible. In light of the 70+ miles done over the last three  days I wasn’t too upset by the idea.I borrowed a bike and road it a mile down the road to a Mexican restaurant that left a lot to be desired. Everyone was in bed by 9 so I got in too. Only one snoring hiker, soft ear plugs always required!!","Hogback Ridge Shelter 317.3

Senior,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635497,"last night was passed very pleasantly one gentleman in the bunk room snored from time to time but I had earplugs. It did start raining today as forecasted and since my trail partner and experienced Appalachian trail partner, Time Snake, had decided to zero here I felt justified in taking a zero day as well.I was up by 7:30 which is a little later than usual. It was nice to sleep in. First order of business was to cook some breakfast there was plenty of instant grit packages in the hiker box and plenty of spare fuel canisters that had 10 to 20% left that I could use instead of my own fuel canister. After finishing my grits the Hostel office was opened and I made arrangements to jump on the morning shuttle into Irwin, TN. It was called the breakfast Shuttle and it stopped at a Shell gas station next to a McDonald’s, several other eating establishments including a Dunkin’ Donuts, across the street from a grocery store.I had weighed myself the day before and found that I had lost more than 5 pounds in the last three weeks. After talking to other hikers I decided the plan was buy and carry more bars especially bars that contain proteins. I prefer not to stop and make a lunch. It was a short ride of about five minutes into Irwin and besides the bars I picked up a baguette and a block of cheese. Time Snake and I went over to the McDonald’s where I followed up Those grits with a biscuit with bacon egg and cheese and a senior cup of coffee.It rained all day and when we got back to the Hostel I and two other hikers combined our dirty laundry and washed it. I’m relaxing on the front porch reading a book titled “a Hostel on the Nolichucky”. A few flakes of snow just dropped and the rain is supposed to start up again a bit this afternoon. There’s an opportunity to slack pack. We would be dropped off 13 miles up the trail where the trail peaks at about 4000 feet and hike back down to the Hostel where we would then again be shuttled back up with all of our gear to continue the hike. 13 miles isn’t a full days hike, especially when you’re not caring full weight. My goal is to keep my mileage close to 20 and eat more during the hike. We hope to be in Damascus, Virginia which is only about 140 miles away in a week.One of the staff members stuck his head into the bunk room and had half a plate of mac & cheese that he hadn’t finished that I took from him and polished off. I figure I’ve eaten well over 2000 cal this morning. More hikers that I’m familiar with are trickling in and bringing word that the dirty bubble is a day or two behind us.As usual, check seniorboyd Instagram for pictures.","Uncle Johnny’s Hostel mile 344.2

Senior,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635986,"it rained last night and was a little cool. I made my breakfast coffee and a granola bar and started packing up. Camp near me were Sunny D and Josh. They were both staring or up as I hiked over to the trail. As I approach the trail I found two snails in a loving embrace. You can check out the photo on Instagram “seniorboyd”. After an hour or two of hiking I came to a really nice stretch of trail that had been made ADA compliant. It led through a nice pasture past the barn and I finally got to a place where I could stand on a rock and take a full 360 view everything was green and beautiful as could be. The day was alternately windy and not Wendy with patchy clouds blocking out the sun till afternoon. The inside of my tent is still damp from last nights condensation and so was the outside. I was hoping for a lunchtime break in the sun they would let me dry everything out but it did not happen. Josh, Sunny D, and another hiker named Wolf and I repeatedly ran into each other at spots for water sources where we stop to refill. About 3:00 in the afternoon I cross the border from Tennessee into Virginia! By previous agreement we stopped at a water source  with tent sites near it approximately a mile and a half from Damascus Virginia. Our plan is to get into Damascus Virginia by 8 o’clock in the morning when a local diner opens that serves large portions. A number of other hikers arrived at the same camping location and joinned us. One started a  campfire, very pleasant. I don’t bother with that very often. Another hiker was not feeling well and before long she was throwing up. We had heard the rumor that Norovirus was going through hikers in the area and she suspects that is what she has. Everyone else was very courteous to her and tried to make her comfortable. People who get it usually just have to deal with it for a day and then feel weak afterwards for another day. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norovirus I will try to post more during my day in Damascus while I wash laundry and other chores.","Stealth Camp mile 447.7

Senior,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636069,"We got up this morning and we’re on the trail by 715. We knew that we had only about a mile and a half to get to the welcome to Damascus sign. After that it was about another mile till we got off the trail, which runs right through town and turn down the street to get to the diner. The diner is the best general restaurant in Damascus and opens at 8 AM we got there about five minutes before eight and there  were already four or five people waiting outside. By 8 am there were 8 more behind us. All of us that were there were able to get in but anyone that showed up afterwards had to wait outside. Sunny D, Josh, and I were directed to a four person table in one corner and after about five or 10 minutes another hiker who camped with us the previous night entered the restaurant to look around. We motion him over to the empty seat at our table. His name is Boston. We all ordered fairly large breakfasts. I want a  glass of milk and a glass of orange juice with mine and of course I had coffee. Eggs bacon and pancakes filled me up. Next we were at the post office where a couple people had packages to pick up, mail off Mother’s Day cards and I mailed home my umbrella in a box that Boston’s umbrella arrived in. I’ve been carrying it for 471 miles and had yet to use it even though it had done some raining. Next at the dollar general which looked like it was cleared out of most stuff that hikers want. Then we made a trip to the food warehouse where we completed our re-supply shopping. About half a dozen of us stood around out front repackaging everything we bought into our food bags and eating. I ate a cup of yogurt and a banana while I packaged up enough food to take me another five or six days down the trail.We walk through town, I found the Methodist Church which has a hostel and found check in wasn’t until 2 PM. I then joined Josh and Sunny D for lunch because it was now noon at a place called the wicked chicken which had an ice cream business next to it. They had some pretty good live music playing and it was a popular place with the locals as well as the tourists. Damascus Virginia is called trail city because about half a dozen different trails intersect or cross through the town. Bicycling There’s a very popular activity on a couple of the trails. The Restaurant crew was slow in getting our food so I left my pack and order with Sunny D and Josh and ran back to the Methodist Church hostel to check in and get my bunk. It’s a very pleasant older house with two or three bunk rooms with 6-8 people in each one. I was issued half of a towel but it was enough and when I finally took my shower I also washed a couple items of clothing.While I was in the food warehouse I was approached by a woman who asked if I was a hiker and then introduced to a female preacher from the Methodist church who also has some kind of B&B, she charges $95 for a cheap room and I told her if I can find another hiker to share one with me I’d get back to her, in the meantime her son invited me to join him at 8:30 for a men’s Bible study that includes coffee and donuts. He will be showing up at the front of the Hostel at 830 to get me. I plan to attend the Southern Baptist church, “first Baptist of Damascus Virginia” for their 1030 service. I plan to get back on the trail after lunch. The only reason I didn’t mail my long pants home with the umbrella was because I wanted to wear them to church. I have not worn long pants for two weeks.The weather is often cool but when you’re hiking you get warm when it’s cold and if it’s windy or rainy you just pull your rain pants on over your shorts. Lights out here in less than 30 minutes I will close this post for now it was and has been a restful day with an opportunity to consume lots of calories.","Mile 468.6
