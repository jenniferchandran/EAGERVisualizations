Water Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621287,"In preparation mode for my 2020 SOBO hike.  Been day hiking as much as I can using AllTrails.com to find difficult trails to do in the western Maine, eastern New Hampshire mountains.  I'm using my 60L Osprey pack which weighs about 25-28 lbs with consumables as my training pack.  I try to do hikes that are 8 - 12 miles in length with good elevational changes.  I do about 1.5-2 mph which I don't think is too bad for the terrain I'm hiking.  Just did the IMP Trail with a side trip up to the AT to north Carter Mtn.   I now carry a Garmin Inreach Mini because of a mishap during my loop over Mt. Madison and Mt Adams on July 3rd.  As usual, I was very careful manuevering over the pile of rocks common in the Whites.  Once I got down onto the flatter, grassier saddle between Mt Adams and Mt Jefferson, I wasn't paying attention and rolled my ankle in a hole.  The next 5 miles were to say the least a bit more difficult and what should have been an 8-9 hour day turned into a 12  hour day with a worried wife.  Now she can follow me on her phone and at least know where to find the body.I've pretty much finalized my equipment list.  Now I just have to start buying the big items.  My estimated base weight is 16 lbs.  I'm planning to hammock on the trail as I've not seen too many tenting spots in the areas that I've been hiking but there are always trees.  My warmer weather gear will allow me to drop my base weight about 2 lbs. but I plan to start the hike with my warmer gear.  I'll start posting my gear list soon.All for now.",,View Entry,"Aug 18, Sun",0
Water Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624321,"After a few months of practice crawling with rocks, roots and rain this summer,  I finally went and did it.  I registered for my 2020 AT thru hike.  My reg number is T9473.  I plan to start on or just before June 1 at Abol Bridge and head south.  I'm doing this for three reasons.  1. Katahdin didn't open until June 15 this year and I don't want to wait that long, 2. I've only hiked in Maine and New Hampshire, mostly on trails near or connecting to the Appalachian Trail so I'm very familiar and comfortable with the terrain and I'm close to home if something bad happens and 3. I want to end with a dramatic climb and I'm told Katahdin is way more dramatic than Springer Mtn.  I understand that bugs, rain and high water will be a problem but I've not been bothered all that much by the bugs (guess I'm not sweet enough) and I can deal with the rain and water.  So I'll get down to Springer and then come back to complete the hike from Abol to Katahdin.  Guess that makes me a flip flopper.Still got a lot of planning to do and stuff to get but I'll discuss that in more detail in my gear list message.Its actually beginning to feel real.....",,View Entry,"Oct 20, Sun",0
Water Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624449,"This will be the first of a few entries concerning the equipment I plan to use on my thru hike.  I'll focus on the pack and shelter system in this entry.I've been using an Osprey pack with a loadout of about 30 lbs. to train for the hike.   This pack is too big for me but it does carry the weight well.  I love the suspension.  But it's just too heavy.  I want to keep my base weight low to keep my maximum carry weight below 35 lbs.  I expect to need the most food during the hundred mile wilderness in Maine and can go with a lighter consumable load elsewhere on the trail.I'm trading in the Osprey for a Dan Durston designed pack that I purchased off Drop (formerly MassDrop).  This is a 43 L pack that won't be ready until next April.  It weighs in at 30.9 oz. (876 gr).  It's not the lightest pack out there and I'm a bit apprehensive about ordering a pack sight unseen but the price was too good to pass up.  Plus it will force me to not carry extra stuff like a larger pack would.I just ordered my hammock and it should be ready in a week or so.   I picked up the Darien from Dream Hammocks. It is reported to be 14 oz (397 gr) in weight.  I'm going to outfit it with a continuous ridgeline from Dutchware.  This will add another 0.7 oz (21 gr). I'm completing my shelter system with a Warbonnet Outdoors Mountainfly 20D Tarp with doors.  This will add 16.3 oz. (461 gr) to my load.  I will store this in a mesh snakeskin from Hammock Gear.  This adds another 1.1 oz. (31 gr).Adding misc. hardware and lines, I expect my shelter system to weigh in at 37.1 oz. (1,050 gr).So Pack and Shelter System combined weighs in at 68 oz (1,926 gr).More to come",,View Entry,"Oct 27, Sun",0
Water Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626328,"Been a little while since I last posted.  I have ordered all of my gear and am only waiting on the top quilt and pack to arrive.
My sleep system will consist of a Top Quilt from Cedar Ridge Outdoors.  I got the 20F LeConte without a sewn footbox.  This reportedly weighs in at 519 g (18.3 oz).  I'll be sure to weigh it when I get it and report back later.  
I'm going with a 3/4 length underquilt from Hammock Gear.  It's the 20F Phoenix and weighs 514 g (18.1 oz).  I will have a sit pad that I can use under my legs on colder nights.
I have also taken Frozen's advice and got an underquilt protector (UQP) from Dutchware Gear.  It's actually made by 2QZ2 but was a couple bucks cheaper from Dutch.  Go figure.  It weighs 147 g (5.4 oz) but I'm told that it will be worth it especially when it rains.
Finally, I did get an inflatable pillow from Litesmith but I'll probably use my puffy jacket since the jacket stores in it's own pocket and is about the same size as the pillow.  The pillow weighs 26 g (0.9 oz)
This whole setup weighs 1,206 g (42.7 oz or 2 lbs. 10.7 oz.).",,View Entry,"Feb 20, Thu",0
Water Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626329,"I've waffled between an alcohol stove and a canister stove.  I finally decided on a canister stove.
The stove itself was the BSR from Amazon.  My cookpot is from Stanley purchased from Walmart.  I replaced the plastic handle on the cover with a metal key ring.  I made a homemade coozy from a car window sunscreen having heard that it will help save some fuel.  Included in the final kitchen setup is a small scrubber pad that I cut out of a larger pad, a mini bic lighter and a small cloth to help with cleanup.  Finally I picked up a spoon from Walmart.  It's a two piece that can fit together endwise to make a long utensil with a spoon at one end and a fork at the other.  The entire setup is stored in the mesh bag you get when you buy a Sawyer Squeeze.  Total weight of the kitchen is 422 g (14.9 oz) without a fuel canister.  The canister fits nicely upside down in the Stanley pot which is where it will be stored while hiking.
There were three reasons that prompted me to go with the canister stove.  The first is time to boil.  It took almost 9 minutes to boil 2 cups of water with the alcohol stove while the canister stove took just over 2 minutes.  I could probably go to just very hot at about 1 min 20 seconds and let the food soak while in the coozy.  The second reason is fuel usage.  It took about 1 oz of alcohol to boil water (2 cups) while it took as little as 9 g of isoprop.  So I can get 10 boils out of a canister while only getting 8 out of my small fuel storage bottle.  The third reason is visibility of flame during the day.  You just can't see the alcohol flame unless it's dark.  Probably not a big deal but I felt more secure knowing that the flame is out on the canister stove.
The final items that make up my kitchen/food prep consists of a 15L food bag (68 g or 2.4 oz), a 12"" x 20"" OPSAC (43 g or 1.5 oz) and a means to hang the bag to include cordage, rock bag and biner (68 g or 2.4 oz).  This all weighs in at 176 g or 6.2 oz.
Finally, my water prep/storage system will include a Sawyer Squeeze with a bottle adapter for backflushing and tubing to enable me to gravity filter (123 g or 4.3 oz).  I will carry at least one 1.5 L Smartwater bottle in my packs side pocket and a 500 ml bottle on my shoulder strap.  I will also carry an Evernew 2L water bag and chlorine dioxide as a backup to the filter.  The water setup weighs in at 264 g (9.3 oz).
So kitchen, food storage and water prep/storage weighs in at 862 g (30.4 oz or 1 lb 14.4 oz.)",,View Entry,"Feb 20, Thu",0
Water Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626333,"I've probably agonized over this the most.  I don't like being cold and have problems with my hands when they do get cold.  I think it actually goes back to my Mt. Washington hike in 1973.  In any event, I've decided on the following:
In my pack:
Two pairs of Darn Tuff socks (1 to trade off for daily hiking and one for sleeping only), one pair of Reebok Compression underwear, One baselayer sleeping top, One baselayer sleeping bottom, One long sleeve shirt (merino wool), a bandana, a smartwool cap, one pair of REI gloves and one pair of REI waterproof mittens (see comment about hands).  All of these will be stored in an 8L waterproof bag.  I also have an LLBean Puffy Jacket with hood.  I'm going to use this as my pillow too since it stores in its own pocket and is about the size of a pillow.  My raingear will be a Frogg Toggs Ultra rain jacket and a Frogg Toggs rain pants.   The weights are 965 g (34 oz.) for clothing and bag, 423 g (14.9 oz.) for the puffy and 434 g (15.3 oz.) for the raingear.  This totals 1,822 g (64.3 oz or 4 lbs 0.3 oz.).  The puffy will be stored separately in the bottom of my pack and the raingear will be stored in the back outside pocket for easy access.
I'll be wearing the following:
One pair of Darn Tuff socks, Convertible pants (Mountain Warehouse), Reebok Compression underwear, a Short Sleeve Wicking Shirt, a buff and a belt.  This ensemble weighs in at 701 g (24.7 oz.).  I also carry trekking poles but haven't decided which ones just yet.  The ones I have need to be replaced.  I wear Merrill Moab 2 low trail shoes.  These are not waterproofed which allows them to dry faster.  I love these shoes and haven't had a problem with them.  The toe flap on my first pair started to delaminate and Lamey Wellenhan took them back with no issues and the replacement has not had the same issue.  After one season of hiking I moved up from a size 10 1/2 to an 11.  My first pair of hiking boots weren't large enough (I started with a 10 wide) and I lost several toenails.  No blister or nail problems with my current pair.  The shoes are very good on most every surface especially those smooth, wet rock surfaces common in Maine and New Hampshire.  
I would like to eventually try Altra's because of the zero drop design.  My feet always feel great in my Teva's and they are zero drop.  Maybe my third trail pair as I already have pair one and two (Merrills).

Water Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626414,"Starting to accumulate my food items for the hike.  I've been an avid KETO practitioner for the past two years.  I've lost 40 lbs. and managed to keep it off so far.  I wanted to loose at least the weight of my pack and have managed to do so.  Wife is worried I'll lose too much weight while on the trail so I'm really trying to stay KETO but have enough calories each day to maintain my weight.I've found some great little smoked sausages at Dollar General so I've been hoarding those.  I'll mate them up with cheese sticks.  I also have been accumulating single packs of tuna, chicken and the ever popular Spam.  I also found some low carb tortillas which will come in handy for lunch sandwiches.I will supplement with single packs of peanut and almond butter.  Lots of fat and calories!  I've also developed a taste for some of the Adkin's bars.  These pack in the calories but only have 4 - 5 net carbs each.   Adkins also has fat bombs which are small but pack a lot of fat and calories and satisfy my sweet tooth.  I'll likely increase my carb intake to 50 g per day from the under 20 I'm trying to maintain now.  This is probably unrealistic on the resupply spots on the trail but it's a goal.I've found a low carb oatmeal replacement and sugar free Carnation Instant Breakfast.  Of course powdered eggs and dehydrated sausage will also provide me with a good start of the day.I'm also making my own GORP.  Will be mixing macadamia nuts, peanuts, almonds, 93% Cacao Dark Chocolate nibs, Edamame, sunflower and pumpkin seeds together for a good salty, very semi sweet snack.I'm also repackaging dehydrated meat and vegetables for some of my evening meals.  Not sure how many packages I'll need to send myself.  If I can find a Dollar General or Walmart, then I can get most everything I need to survive.  But I'll have enough made up ahead of time just in case.The hardest part will be the first section of the hike since I'm basically starting at the entrance to the Hundred Mile Wilderness.  I'll be bringing at least 8 days of food with hopes of only needing food for 7 days.  I've been told that planning usually goes out the window after the first few miles but I do expect to have a second 7 day period or so from Monson to Gorham, NH but there are many more opportunities to slide off the trail to a re-provision on this section so I may not pack the full 7 days of food.  After that, it's going to be whatever it is.  HYOH!Would love to hear any other suggestions regarding food on the trail.Geaux Tigers!",,View Entry,"Feb 24, Mon",0

The following is a bit more information regarding day number one:
The weather couldn't have been better.  Nice and warm and sunny but not too hot.  I didn't find it too buggy but did use my headnet from time to time.  The trail from the Golden Road to my destination was in ok shape.  There were numerous blowdowns all clustered together along Rainbow Lake just after the turn to Rainbow Mountain.  You actually drop a bit in elevation to get to Hurd Brook campsite.  It has a nice privy for those interested.  Crossed Hurd brook and the trail rose up about 800 feet to Rainbow ledges (@ 1,500 ft).  The climb was gradual and easy so you really didn't even notice.  You then dropped down to the shore of Rainbow Lake.  As mentioned, there were three or four blowdowns that I had to maneuver around.  The blowdowns completely obstructed the trail as they fell down the trail and not across it and the surrounding vegetation made it difficult to go around them.  But I made it anyway.
Stopped at Rainbow Spring Campsite for a drink from the spring.  There is a pipe that runs from the spring to the lake requiring that you reach out to get your water.    After descending from Rainbow Ledges, the terrain flattens out and it was pretty easy going.  Got to Rainbow dam and the trail opened up nicely and it was very well marked.  Finally made it to Rainbow Stream Lean To to meet the 4 trail maintainers.  Had a quiet evening talking with them around their fire.  Got back to my hammock and didn't even eat my evening meal as I wasn't all that hungry.","Abol Bridge

This was an area of a previous blowdown event with lots of signs of previous trail maintenance.  I guess the trees that didn't come down during that weather event finally fell.  East Branch Lean To was slightly damaged by a fallen tree which was now laying almost in front of the Lean To.  This site had one of the new privies and it was a beauty.  From the West Branch Rd to Logan Brook was a nice climb.  Did I mention that I hate climbs at the end of the day?  I selected Logan Brook because it was at the base of White Cap, the first big climb as you head south.  Just need to watch those contour lines a bit closer next time.  Saw two NOBO's (Buzz Lightyear and Woody) from Portland, ME.  Also saw a couple of section hikers when I got to Logan Brook but they continued on their way so I had the place to myself, once again.Plenty of water at the campsite.  It started to drizzle but then stopped by bedtime.  Kind of a gray afternoon/evening but it turned out ok.","Antlers Campsite

I've got a routine down now and I set my alarm for 6 am but it's still 7:15 or so before I sling the pack back on for the day.  Started up White Cap to 3,642 feet.  Then it was on to Hay Mountain at 3,241 feet and then West Peak at 3,173 feet and then Gulf Hagas Mtn at a mere 2,687 feet.  Once you get onto the first peak, the others aren't so bad because you don't go all the way down to zero to start the next peak.  You still have to go down a few hundred feet only to go back up to the next peak.  Quite annoying.  Beautiful sights in Gulf Hagas area.  Expected to see a lot of people as it's a popular hiking destination.  Had the place to myself.  First ford of the trip. Had to cross the Pleasant River.  It was pleasant.  Water wasn't too cold or too fast and only about shin deep so it was fine.  I don't particularly like fording rivers as you have to stop and take shoes off, put on water shoes, gather all gear and then cross only to reverse the procedure on the other side. Takes a lot of time.  I crossed with a picture of a friend of mine who recently passed away.  The picture was of him crossing at the very same spot on the river.  So I wasn't alone crossing.  He will continue on with me for as long as I'm on the trail.
Then it was on to Chairback Mtn at only 2,172 feet.  However it was getting close to the end of the day and water was becoming an issue.  Most of the springs had dried up and my guide said that there was a stream before Chairback.  Couldn't find the stream.  Met one NOBO as I neared the lean to on the back side of Chairback.  He had been hiking with Buzz and Woody but got separated from them.  Didn't catch his name.  Made it to the lean to only to find the spring was also dry.  I had conserved water since I need some for dinner and then breakfast in the morning.  I managed to scoop up about a liter from a stagnant pool.  Not a great site although I did have cell service so I could call home.","Logan Brook Lean To

Then it was on to Chairback Third Mtn and then Chairback Fourth Mtn (Guess they ran out of names) and finally up to Barren Mtn and then across a slide which is just a pile of rock that you have to cross.  This is more common that I would like.  Got to Long Pond Stream Lean To to find the stream next to the Lean To was dry.  Most intermittent streams are now dry.  Had to go downhill about .2 miles to a larger stream.  Did I mention that I don't like to climb up hills at the end of the day?  Had the campsite to myself once again.  
My original plan was to have my #1 daughter re-provision me on Friday.  Only had 15 miles to go to Route 15 and Shaw's Hostel so I had planned to stop at the next shelter which was 5 miles from Route 15 which would give me a short walk out on Saturday.
During the day, I formulated a new plan.  Go the 15 miles today and stay at Shaw's overnight.  This proved to be a good idea as I needed a short break, clean clothes and a shower, not to mention real food that had not be dehydrated.","Chairback Gap Lean To

They had clothing that you can wear while doing your laundry.  Keep in mind that thru hikers do not carry extra clothes to wear.  Often you have to put on your rain gear to do laundry.  It a nice feature that not all hostels do for the hikers.  Then on to a long shower since I was the only person staying in that part of the hostel.  I stayed in the ""bunk room"" which had 8 beds.  Since I was the only one there I was able to save $25 by doing so.I then went into the metropolis of Monson and had dinner at a bar and grill. It was crowded as Memorial Day weekend had started and all of the summer people were starting to come up to the Moosehead area.  It was a wonderful meal.  Had the meatloaf with fries!  These were the first fries that I've had in almost three years as I'm practicing a KETO lifestyle.  Also had three beers!  Off to bed in a real bed!","Long Pond Stream Lean To

Nice day for walking.  Not too warm but sunny and a light breeze.  Lots of lakes, streams and small rivers.  Of course there are no bridges over most of these so it's fording time.  I met a NOBO at the first fording.  I watched him cross and decided that it wasn't too bad as the water only came to his knees.  We talked a bit.  He was disappointed that I didn't have a cigarette to give him.  He also wanted to know if there was a Pot Shop in Monson.  Couldn't help him out there either.  You get to meet the most interesting folks on the trail.
Well the first crossing didn't go as planned.  This was the east branch of the Piscataquis River.  I decided to forego the water shoes and do the crossing barefoot.  Went ok until I reached a point that looked a little deep so I decided to step up onto a larger submerged rock.  Bad decision.  All of the rocks are covered with slime so it was a bit slippery.  Down I went.  Of course I looked around after I got up to make sure no one saw me.  One advantage of being alone on the trail.  Fortunately I only submerged my bottom half, a bit of my pack and one of my hiking shoes hanging from the back of my pack. Of course that was the shoe that I stuffed my socks into so they were wet too.  One note.  My pack isn't water tight or water proof but it is water resistant.  Plus I've got all of the things I can't get wet (bedding/hammock/clothes) in a compactor bag so they stayed dry.
As I mentioned, it was a warm sunny day so I was dry in about two hours.  Would not have been so good if it were a cold wet day.
The next three fords went well.  I stopped, put on my water shoes, crossed very slowly and carefully placed each foot down until it was secure on the stream bed and then reversed the process on the other side.  As I mentioned, it takes me a lot of time since you don't have a nice chair on either side to remove or replace your shoes and these 67 year old knees don't bed as much as they once did.  But I decided that it was time well spent.
I followed the west branch of the Piscataquis River for some time.  Very rooty and rocky so slow going not to mention that the maintainers had not been out yet so there were a lot of blowdown to contend with.

I've already done Sugarloaf so I by-passed it.  The next peak was Spaulding which is just a 150 yards off the AT.  I hadn't done this peak yet so I went up to check it off the 4000 footer list.  Now MATC says that it's just under 4000 foot but the New England 4000 foot organization has it on it's list so I had to check it off.  I came to the AT Completion plaque between Sugarloaf and Spaulding Mtn.  Hard to believe that the trail was completed in 1937.  But it was only 2054 miles long.  It's currently around 2,093 miles long as many sections had to be re-routed.  The actual mileage is fluid as trail reconfiguration occurs all of the time.The trail from the Spaulding Lean to to Lone Mountain was in terrible shape.  Lots of obstructions requiring bushwhacking to get around.  This takes a lot of time and is tiring.   My final destination was Poplar Ridge Lean To.  I thought that it wouldn't be much to go over a ridge.  Well this ridge is over 3000 feet tall! and it was quite an ascent.  Plus there are no poplars on the ridge.  The story (provided by a great history put together by the maintainer and left in the leanto) is that there was a fire that enabled the quick seeding species like poplar to repopulate the area.  These trees do not live a long time and were eventually replaced by the more resilient spruce and fir that now populate the ridge.  Maybe they need to rename it Popular Ridge.Well, it was getting late and I was getting tired and as I was descending Poplar Ridge, heading just a short distance to the Lean To, I was climbing down from a smooth rock face and it happened.  Rather than climb down like I was climbing up, i.e. facing the rock, I instead tried to jump down a short distance.  Well, one of my feet caught on a root and I did a face plant.  Fortunately, my nose stopped my head from hitting the ground.  I didn't break anything but it sure swelled up and the cut on my nose bled a bit.  I cleaned it up at the shelter and a band aid with antiseptic cream was all that was needed.I was alone again at the lean to which I'm sure will not be the case as I head further south.

Not a bad climb and there was a bit of water as you made  your way to the ridge.  I didn't bother to do the side trail to the summit as I've already done it a couple of times.  The back side of Old Speck down to Speck Pond was a bit dicey as it was very steep and you had to do a lot of butt sliding.  Made it down to Speck Pond where there is a Lean To but continued on to the Mahoosuc Notch.  However, the first thing in the way is the Mahoosuc Arm.  This is a very steep, very smooth rock face.  Had to take it very easy to get down to the Notch.  Was actually glad for roots for once as they provided hand holds to  help me down.  It was getting late so I decided to stop at an unofficial tentsite and found two trees to accommodate my hammock.  A stream nearby provided water.  All that I lacked was a privy but I had my trusty shovel with me.  All was good.","Frye Notch Lean To

Water Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639477,"After a good nights sleep, it was off to the infamous Mahoosuc Notch. This is listed as either the most difficult or the most fun mile of the trail.  Think of a narrow canyon filled with very large, truck sized rocks.  Elevational change is slight so you are basically going over, around and through the rocks.  Thank the Lord and my parents for my long legs. There are four places where you have to take your pack off to crawl through a small opening or cave. Took me 1.5 hours to get through the Notch.  Snow was still present in places.
Once out of the Notch, it's back up to the Mahoosuc Range.  The final peak is Mount Success.  This was the site of a DC3 plane crash in 1954, the year I was born.  It crashed on Nov 30 and the folks were rescued two days later.  Most of the planes body is still there and is a popular hiker destination.
Made it to Gretian Pond Shelter to finally share a campsite with other hikers.  There were three young people in the shelter and two older hikers, tailhook and lemonade showed up just before sundown.  There was enough room so it felt like I was alone.

I'm still here so I didn't encounter the bear overnight.Was treated to sausage and shrimp jambalaya and met Special Ed and No Regrets.  Both were my age or older so we had more in common and got along well.  Special Ed was going to hit every Hut in the AMC system.  These huts provide a bed with a mattress, dinner and breakfast and generally costs $150. PP, per day.  They have propane for cooking (no heat provided) and solar panels for lights. They are 5-8 miles apart and are quite nice.  Hikers can stop by during the day to buy a hot drink and a baked good.  Water is provided free.  The huts used to have work for stay for 2-3 thru hikers each night.  They stopped doing this this year.  The only problem is there is no camping within 0.3 miles of the huts and since you may be above treeline, hammocking is difficult.I stopped by a few huts to get a sweet baked good and hot chocolate but didn't care to stay.  BTW, the huts also had nice bathrooms so it was another good reason to stop.

Who should I meet at the Hut but No Regrets.  He was reverse hiking back to Rattle River.  I was told of a stealth site about 0.25 miles down a side trail.  It was actually about 300 feet from the Hut and it had cell service.  Nice evening to view the stars.

Water Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639452,"Got a late start (8 am) and made it down to Pinkham Notch. My Garmin Inreach is set to track my progress every hour.  it took me almost 5 hours to traverse the Wildcats (4 peaks) with the final descent almost down a vertical face. Since it records my movement as a straight line between tracks it appears that I've only gone a short distance especially when I was going down the steep face.  So I use my Guthook App to get my mileage. I reachedthe Pinkham Notch center just as they closed the deli.  Got two tiny muffins and two electrolyte drinks for $9.00.  The day was breezy and overcast so not much to see today.
Continued to the Osgood tent site which I had to myself.  I wanted to go further but the next campsite was on the other side of Mount Madison and I hate late day climbs. So erring on the side of caution, I stopped for the night.
One thing I noticed was all of the flowing streams.  There were probably more flowing streams crossing the trail between Pinkhan Notch and the Osgood Campsite than I saw in all of Maine.  I hope it stays that way.","Carter Notch Hut Stealth Site

Water Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639456,"The day started off beautifully with sunny skies and a light breeze.  Now there are warning signs saying that the weather can change suddenly and can be very dangerous. Those signs are for the noobs and not for seasoned hikers like myself.
Managed Mt Madison ok as I've been there before and knew what to expect.  It's basically a rock cairn. Then off to the Madison Hut for water and a piece of corn bread and a hot chocolate.  Still sunny so off to Mt Adam's which you bypass on the AT.  You also bypass Mt Jefferson so all is good.  I've already have done both so no big deal.  On my accent to Washington I could see a dark cloud bank off in the distance but it's still sunny but breeze is much stronger.  Made it to the cog railroad which goes to the summit.  Managed to take a photo as two trains headed back down with customers who've paid $48 bucks each for the ride.  It's a tradition for thru hikers to moon the train but I wasn't in the mood.
As I made the final ascent to the summit, those clouds I saw came rushing in so I couldn't see more than 50 feet ahead.  Fortunately the cairns are spaced about that far apart so I made it.  I didn't even have to wait to take my photo on the summit.  A hiker I met on the way up, Father Time, said he didn't bother the day before because the line was too long for a picture.
Went into the visitor center and bought a lukewarm bowl of corn chowder and a piece of pizza that had been sitting under a heat lamp for a couple of hours.  What a wonderful meal!  Haven't had either for 3 years.  So good!   
Headed out to find that the sky's opened up.  Waited a while talking to a family from Dallas.  Rain slowed so off I went, the seasoned hiker.  Well the rain slowed for about 10 minutes and then it poured with hail.  Thought I heard thunder and sure enough it was thunder,, lightening  ( because you can't have one without the other) with rain and hail.
Made it the 1.9 miles to Lake of the Clouds Hut to be told that they were full up but there was a campsite only 5 miles away.  I need to mention that during my stroll to the Hut I managed to call the wife to ask her to get me a reservation to the Hut.  You know the results so off I went to the next campsite.  So now I'm on a long ridge in a thunderstorm.  Trying not to be the tallest thing there to no avail.  Plus the trail was now a stream but once your feet are wet, they can't get any wetter.  The rain kilt I bought was working well so I was still reasonably dry other than my feet.  Since I'm writing this you should figure out that I made it to the campsite.  The sun actually came out about an hour before I got there so the day ended well.  Guess it was Mt Washington's way of giving me the finger, you smart assed seasoned hiker.
The Naumen campsite is next to the Mizpah Hut so water wasn't a problem.  The caretaker showed me where to set up, after paying the $10 for the privilege. He did give me a Thru Hiker pass for $5 camping at any subsequent campsites that charge a fee. So all is good.  Met Forgetfull, a northbounder otherwise I has the place to myself and the caretaker of course.
Rained a bit during the night but I was warm and dry.  Life is still good.","Osgood campsite

Water Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639512,"Today was partly scary and partly smooth sailing.  Started off from Nauman campsite to find Mt Jackson in the way.  Once up and over, I found myself on another cliff looking down at Rt 302 in Crawford Notch.  It was a very steep decline with lots of butt slides and facing the rock to get down.  Took quite a while too.  Once down, I found myself at Crawford Notch State Park at the Ripley Falls Trailhead.  It was a nice gradual climb to the top of the ridge and then low and behold, level ground.  I was actually on an old railroad bed as there are quite a few in this area.  These were used for logging  years ago. It was a nice stroll past Ethan Pond and then along the Pemigewasset River.  The trail borders the Pemigewasset Wilderness.  I mention this as there is a nice 34 mile loop (called the Pemi Loop) that is quite popular with weekenders.  Strolling along, I finally managed to get to the stealth site before the Zealand Hut.  Each camping area/hut has a 0.3 mile buffer zone around them where camping isn't allowed.  This site was within site of the border for Zealand so I was legal.  The site was large and had water so it was almost perfect.  A privy would have made it perfect.  One other hiker arrived about an hour after me and we talked a bit (or should I say, he talked and I listened).  I actually stopped a bit early but there would not be another good camping site for quite a distance, so it wasn't where I wanted to be but it was a nice spot, one which I had  used before when I did the Pemi Loop.Weather was dry again so no worries.  Even managed to hang my food bag which is difficult in a forest with mostly tall hardwoods and conifers.","Nauman Tentsite

Water Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639513,"Did a lot of climbing and peak hopping today.  Started by going up Zealand and then on to Guot, followed by South Twin.  All are 4000+ peaks.  Once down from South Twin, I headed to Galeshead Hut for a baked good and a drink.  Seeing quite a few people today as the weekend is starting.  Lots of people doing the Pemi Loop.  Met one guy attempting to do it in ONE day!  I took three days.  Continued on to Garfield (a tough climb), past the Garfield campsite and then on to Mt Lafayette.  On the way to Lafayette I met a young man coming in my direction.  He was obviously a day hiker and was lost.  He asked me where the parking lot was.  I replied which one?  He replied, the one near the hut.  Again I replied which one?  We determined he wanted the hut below Lafayette.  I convinced him after showing him my Guthook App that he was going in the wrong direction and together we would find the trail.  It was probably good for me too as he set a pretty good pace that I was able to maintain so it got me to Lafayette sooner than I would have gotten there on my own.  Mt. Lafayette was frustrating for a southbounder as it had at least 6 false summits.  A false summit is where you can only see a prominent high point ahead only to find once  you get there that there is another prominent higher high point just beyond.  Well on the way up, we found two other hikers with a dog who were also lost.  So the four of us continued up Lafayette where I put the three of them (not counting the dog) on the right trail.  My good deed for the day.
I then followed the ridge trail which was spectacular.  Weather was great, with clear skies and light winds.  Proceeded to Mt Lincoln and Little Haystack and headed to Mt Liberty.  Fortunately the trail turns down before Liberty and I finally made it to Liberty Springs Campsite.  Paid my $5 which saved me $10 because of the Thru Hiker Pass I got at Nauman Campsite.  I was told to set  up my hammock behind platform #2 which was a group platform that was not occupied.  A smaller platform next to #2 was occupied by two tents (3 people).  While setting up, guess who showed  up?  A group.  So now there are five tents and 9 people within spitting distance.  One side of my tarp is nearly touching the group platform so we are all up close and personal.  The six people occupying the group platform were all 20 somethings and talk, talk, talk.....
I went about my business and after eating, storing my food in the bear boxes and getting my evening water, I got in my hammock to see how the night would be.  Turned out the 20 somethings were very accomodating and were quickly in bed themselves and we had a good evening.  Probably 20 people in the campsite total.  Weather was still great and sunset was spectacular.","Stealth Site near Zealand Falls

Made it down to the parking lot to find the shuttle waiting just for me.  Paid my $20 for the ride and got a tour of North Woodstock before being deposited at my hotel by 11 am.  Surprisingly got checked in so I did my laundry, showered and went to McDonalds for lunch.  Got to have my sweet tea.
That evening I walked to North Woodstock (about a mile) and went to a brewery there for a Cobb Salad and a couple of beers.  North Woodstock is a nice little town that is all about tourists.  Since it was bike week in Laconia, motorcycles were in abundance.  It was not  unusual to see groups of 30-40 bikes at a time.  Beer was good as was the salad (needed some greens).  Headed back and got a pint of ice cream from 7-11 and headed to the hotel for a bit of catching  up on Trail Journals and bed.
Daughter #1 expected tomorrow for resupply and she and a friend will hike with me for a while as I head to Hanover and the end of NH.

Cube got in the way.  Not a bad or big climb but it was getting late in the day and did I mention that I don't like late day climbs?
Well someone wasn't listening because the shelter was 0.2 miles off the trail and it went straight up.  Good thing I brought the extra water as the water source was mostly dry.
Met Hulk Hogan at the shelter.  A fellow seasoned traveler.  He didn't look like Hulk Hogan but enough people thought so, so he got the name.  We thought that we'd be the only people there but two hikers showed up, a young guy and girl.  The girl was Pippin as in Pippin Took of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.  Don't recall the guys name.  Turns out the girl was from Baton Rouge so we talked about all things Baton Rouge and LSU.  She was a 2019 LSU grad and low and behold, her degree was in Forestry.  What a small world to have two LSU forestry grads at the same shelter.
Michelle, a section hiker with no trail name came in a bit later.  She too was a hammocker so she set up near me where there were many hammock trees.  She had relatives in Bangor but she lives in Colorado.  
I was able to contact my wife by phone only to be told about the tropical storm.  The nice thing about hiking the AT is you are usually out of cell range and have broken free from the electronics in your life.  The bad thing about the AT is that you are usually out of cell range and don't hear about the storms that are coming your way.  
It only took the storm about 15 minutes to get to us so I climbed into the hammock, lowered both sides of the tarp and hunkered down.  It was quite a storm with lots of thunder and lightening and rain.  However, I was snug in my hammock and everything that needed to stay dry did stay dry.

Katahdin. Anyway, the farmers market was great.  It had fresh baked goods, pies and ICE CREAM.  I got two drinks, a huge blueberry muffin, an apple fritter, a pint of ice cream and cookies for later.  The others got whole pies with ice cream.  Couldn't quite do that just yet.  I'm sure I'll be up to it in another 500 miles.Lots of more ups and downs and finally made it to Stony Brook Shelter.  A small trickling stream provided the water and it wasn't too far away.  Reports of bears in the area and I met two hikers who had just seen a mother and three cubs about a mile away from the shelter.  We did have a bear box which is just a big industrial tool box with hasps and clips that required a thumb to operate.  Fortunately, bears don't have thumbs.There were 6-7 other hikers there.  I'm seeing more and more hikers and I'm having to learn to share my campsites.  I miss Maine.","Stealth Site at MM 459.0

Water Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640032,"Got up at my usual time of 5:30 and began my morning routine.  Heard some yelling and hiker pole clashing so I went to investigate.  Seems a young bear was maneuvering around the edge of our campsite. No amount of yelling or noise making was working to get him out of our campsite. Finally someone threw a rock and hit him which gave him a good reason to skedaddle. Always nice to see wildlife in the wild but I'd rather have some bars between me and a bear.Killington was on the agenda today. It's one of five 4000+ foot peaks in Vermont.  Actually the hike up was pretty easy as Vermont uses a lot of switchbacks unlike Maine and New Hampshire.  I needed to get to Manchester, my next re-provisioning town in three days so I made another attempt at a 20 mile day.  The backside of Killington ran along a contour line and usually that means a narrow trail with one side sloping straight down and the other side mostly straight up.  The trail reminded me of Maine as it was rooty and rocky.Finally made it down to Gov. Clement to find a group of women hikers.  The site was great with a good water source right next to it.  There were 9 women and three guys.  I talked to a couple of them in the shelter.  Not too many people stay in the shelters but they are used for cooking and eating as they usually have a level surface upon which to set your stove.Pretty uneventful night.  Back to it in the morning.I've been asked about my routine and believe me, I need a routine otherwise I'd forget and leave half of my stuff behind. This is what I do when I reach camp.1.  Get water.  I fill my 3 liter water bladder from whatever water source is available.  Sometimes it's quite a distance away.  If that's the case, the I'll leave my hiking shoes on. If it's close, I'll trade my hiking shoes for my camp shoes.2.  Begin gravity filtering the water into whatever empty container I have.  I carry two 1 liter smart water bottles.  One is for clean water and the other is for water that needs filtering.  I also carry a 750 ml bottle that hangs from one of my pack straps.  That's the bottle I drink from during the day.  If I don't have an empty bottle, then I'll drink the entire contents of the clean 1 liter bottle and then refill it with filtered water.  I may go back for more water especially if I get distracted and it overflows the bottle being filled.  I need enough water to fill all of the bottles plus water for my breakfast powder.  I'll try to have enough left in the bladder to fill my day time bottle in the morning.3.  Begin setting up my sleep system.  I'll set up the tarp first and then hang my hammock.  Many folks do that in reverse but I wanted to get accustomed to doing it like it was raining.  If it's raining, you want a dry spot to hang the hammock.  I then attach the underquilt and underquilt protector.  The underquilt is critical because the hammock provides zero warmth protection and without an underquilt, even 65F feels cold if it's windy.  I like the underquilt protector for several reasons.  It keeps the underquilt dry if its raining and the rain can splatter up to the underquilt.  It also adds 5-10F of warmth and lastly, I store the stuff sacks between the underquilt and the underquilt protector.I usually set my tarp where one side is set to the ground like a tent and the other side is set almost horizontally by using my hiking poles as supports.  This allows the breeze to blow into my hammock and is quite nice if you are situated to face either the sunset or sunrise.I then put my quilt in the hammock and stuff my puffy jacket into the quilts stuff sack.  This is my pillow.  I hang the following from the ridgeline:  My headlamp, my Garmin InReach GPS and my clothing bag in case I need something else to wear.  Once in the hammock, I'll hang my socks and shorts from the ridgeline too.  My shirt usually goes into the underquilt protector.  My quilt and underquilt are 20F gear so I often just lay on top of the quilt.  I sleep hot.  I need to get 40F gear soon.4.  I then begin my food prep.  I use dehydrated meals at night so I only have to boil water.  I don't want to get into the habit of cooking something because that means clean up afterwards.  I may add some diced spam to my meals.  This adds another 200 calories.  I can also add bacon bits or olive oil for more calories.  I consume another liter of water.5.  Finally, I'll fill my daytime water bottle and put that into the hammock organizer along with my phone and a couple of snacks.  I'll mostly consume all of the water and goodies during the night.6.  Before bedding down, I'll repack whatever is left of my gear along with any food into my backpack and hang it in the shelter if it's empty.  I've rarely found a good tree from which to hang my food bag so I'll just keep it close by but not next to me. Then it's off to bed.  But not in my bed.","Stony Brook Shelter

So I decided to stop at the Bromley Shelter which was only about 2 miles from the road.  The only serious climb of the day was to Bromley Mountain, the home of a ski resort.  It wasn't all that bad but there were several ups and downs to get there.  The summit is an open field with the ski lift and warming hut.  There were several folks already camped out on the summit as it's a good place to watch the sunset and sunrise.  Unfortunately there is no water on the summit so I continued on to the shelter a short distance away.The water source war marginal but enough to get my fill of water.  Since I was going to town tomorrow, I didn't need as much water as I usually do.  Found two trees a bit closer to other campers than I would like but it worked.  Early evening brought a thunder storm but not much rain.  The last clap of thunder sounded like it was right over us.  Too bad for the folks on the peak as there was no sunset visible that night.There were 7 of us at the campsite and I met two young people while cooking dinner.   We talked for a while and then it's off to bed with anticipation of a shower and laundry in my future.And miles to go before I sleep (in my own bed)","Little Rock Pond Shelter

This was the first time since 1973 that I had to hitch a ride.  Still got my touch.They dropped me off at McDonald's where they were going to get breakfast after their morning hike.  I proceeded up to an outfitters for dehydrated meals and a fuel canister.  Then off to Price Chopper for the rest.  On the way I stopped at McDonald's but their lobby was closed for lack of workers.  My trusty app allowed me to order curbside so I managed to get something to eat.Manchester is like Freeport ME. It's all about high end outlets and tourists.  Very quaint with low impact signage.After finishing at Price Chopper, I gave the Hostel a call for pickup.  I was hoping that they would do so even though it was only 1130 am.  KC said that she would be there in 10 min but I was not to tell anyone that I got to check in early.The Hostel is owned by a former thru hiker from Ohio.  During hiking season, he relocates and opens the hostel.  Duffy gave me a tour of the place and since I was the first one there,  I got the pick of the three beds in the assigned room.  The room had its own bathroom so it was nice.  I selected some loaner clothes so I could do laundry without having to wear my raingear while doing so.  Most hostels and some hotels have loaner clothes for the hikers.  After a nice shower and laundry, I went down to the living area to update my journal on the computer provided to the hikers.  The room also had comfortable chairs and sofas and a huge library of videos to watch.I got a pint of ice cream (first one is $1) and my free drink and went out to the back deck to enjoy them.  By this time, others began to arrive and I met my roommate for the night.  Her name was Stroop Waffle and she was maybe 25-27 yrs old.  Dinner for me was a prepared meal from Price Chopper and a gallon of sweet tea.  The others tried to order delivery but all of the delivery places had run out of food.  So KC brought them into town for another run at Price Chopper.I retired early and found it once again difficult to get to sleep.  I missed my hammock.

Stratton was an easy climb with nothing to see unless you climbed the fire tower.  This was typical for the last few days.  Nothing to see, no broad vista's like I had in ME and NH.  The sky opened up on me as I descended.  Got to see water bars that worked and those that didn't. My rain gear malfunctioned a bit and my back and pants got wet.  Rain eventually stopped but the damage was done.

I'm trying to adjust my speed to get into Dalton, MA on Monday.  So I decided to have a short day and end 4.7 miles from Dalton.  I didn't know if there would be a stealth site closer and I couldn't check into the hotel early so I could sleep in.
My feet really took hell today as it was too many days with wet feet.  Got blisters on top of each toe plus one on the back of my right foot.
It didn't rain so that was a plus and the trail was in pretty good shape.  I did slip once, getting my pants dirty.  I wear light colored pants so they show all the dirt.  I need to get my dark green convertible pants that won't show the dirt as much.
The trail was mostly flat so I made it to the campsite by 130 pm.  The sun actually came out and I decided after removing my wet shoes and socks, to take a nap.  Woke at 530 pm to find two other campers set up.  They were very considerate and didn't make a lot of noise to wake me.  One of the two was going to check on me but I had written in the campsite register that I was holding up at the campsite purposely to get a package the next day.
Nearly all shelters and campsites have a register which is simply a notebook that hikers can leave a message or whatever.  I try to leave a short message every time I stop at a shelter even if it's only for a short lunch break.
Had a nice conversation with everyone.  A mother and son eventually joined our happy group.  We usually congregate at the shelter to eat because that may be the only level surface to set your stove on. It may also have a picnic table and in many instances, it provides a roof to eat under.  In our campground, we only had a picnic table with no shelter.  But the sun was out and we eventually got a peak at a sunset.  We then had to listen to the fireworks which sounded surprisingly close.

Got into Dalton and hiked down to Main St.  From there, I walked into Pittsfield where my hotel was located.  I didn't plan to walk that far (~2 miles), but the bus wasn't running (holiday), and no Uber cars were available.   Made it to Five Guys for lunch and then called a taxi for a ride to the hotel.
Got checked in, did my laundry and then took a nap.  Now laundry means washing all of the clothes you wear and carry.  I don't carry extra clothes to wear in town, so instead I wore my rain jacket and rain kilt and walked barefoot to the guest laundry.  I may have looked weird but there were few people around to notice.  When I went to check the dryer, there was another person loading the washer while wearing her rain gear.  Another thru hiker!

It was going to be a long day as there were only two campsites in over 20 miles.  I could stay at the first but that would only get me 10 miles closer to Georgia.   The second was 11 miles further BUT it promised pancakes in the morning.  This site had a caretaker who makes pancakes and coffee for all campers.  Never one to pass up free food, I knew where I wanted to be tonite.
Two notable stops today.  The first was the Cookie Lady.  Actually, the Cookie lady sold the farm to a couple with the understanding that they would continue the tradition of providing cookies and lemonade to hikers.  Imagine my disappointment when I found no cookies or lemonade.   Hope this was just an oversight as every hiker I met wanted to stop there.
The second stop was at the bridge over the Mass Pike (I-90). My old neighbor wanted me to stop to take a picture of the bridge as she passes it whenever she visits her daughter in NY.
It was only a couple of miles from the bridge to the cabin so I made it there well before dark.  Only 6 other hikers there which surprised me.  There were 18 the day before.  This meant that I may actually get my fill of pancakes in the morning.  You got to have your priorities in order.

First obstacle was Bear Mtn.  It was quite the climb, very reminiscent of ME or NH.  Once at the top, the view would have been nice but clouds were in the way.  Muddy trails continued but not to the same extent as that seen in Massachusetts.   I think that there must be more sand in the trail as they seemed better drained.
Ups and downs continued to a road walk near Salisbury CT.  The road went by a cemetery where someone had a bench installed near the road for hikers. It was greatly appreciated.   While sitting there, a car stopped and I was asked if I needed a ride to town.  I declined but it showed that the people were hiker friendly.  I was also able to refill my water bottles from a spigot in the cemetery. (It's allowed and encouraged).
More ups and downs until I came to Great Falls.  This was where the Housatonic River was putting on quite a show.  The river broke a record for flow in July.  This flow is more common in early spring during snowmelt.
It started to rain shortly after passing the falls and it really started to pour as I started my road walk.  By the time I got to the bridge over the Housatonic,  I was soaked.   So much for dry socks.
It was just a short distance to my campsite but of course it was all uphill.  Lots of down trees in the area so I was concerned about finding two good trees. 
I had to go all the way to the rear of the campsite to find not only another camper but also two trees that would work.
We also had a group of troubled youths occupying the larger group campsite.   I couldn't see them but they sure were loud.  Fortunately they all quieted down early and it was a quiet but wet evening.","Laurel Ridge Campsite

Water Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641058,"Woke to the pitter patter of another rainy day.  It eventually subsided enough for me to get up and start my day.  It did stop raining soon after I got on the trail but it remained very gray and gloomy. 
Followed contours for a while and then did the up and down shuffle for a while.  Eventually came to Guinea Brook, only it was Guinea River and a sign advised going around it.   I decided that this was a prudent course of action but I did go down to the edge of the stream (on both sides) so that I can say I hiked the complete trail.
Since the bypass took me closer to Cornwall Bridge, I decided to go into the villageand investigate the country store.
Ordered a double Cowboy burger (it had bacon on it) and fries for lunch. Also picked up a few snacks because you never have enough snacks.  After eating my delicious lunch, I went back in and got a large ice cream cone.  Also picked up a sandwich and chips for dinner. 
I returned to the trail for a climb to a ridge and then eventually reached a four mile stretch along the Housatonic River.  It was an easy walk to the campsite, where I found a father and daughter in the shelter.
Now I only carry what I absolutely need and nothing more.  I am always amazed at what the weekenders bring with them.  For instance, the father was sitting in a folding camp chair and the daughter was reclining on her camp cot reading a real book.  I'm not one to judge but you may notice that although I would like to sit higher than 12 inches above the ground, I don't carry a chair with me.
In any event, I set up my austere camp and returned to the shelter where the picnic table was located to eat my sandwich and chips.  I was pleasantly surprised to find the two ladies I met the day before had also arrived. It was nice to see familiar faces.  Guess that's what it will be like when the southbounders show up.  We talked about the days hike and reconnected a bit.
Talked a while with the father.  Turns out, he is a Pentacostal Minister from Waterbury CT.  He took over the congregation that his father ran for 40 plus years.  His son is also his assistant pastor.  His congregation Is small, just the way he likes it.  He said he wouldn't like to run the mega churches as he was like me, a bit of an introvert.  I mentioned the mega Pentacostal church in Alexandria LA (wife's hometown) and he knew the pastor there. 
We talked about hiking and he indicated an interest in hammocking so I showed him my setup and gave him a few recommendations.  He seemed to be a genuinely nice person which I guess is a good thing to be if you are a pastor.

Water Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641086,"Excited today as I'm to meet daughter #3s father in law in Kent, CT.  Her in-laws live about 50 minutes away and they've offered to rescue me from the rainy trail.  I'm also picking up my first trail package from home at the post office.
The trail milage was 7 miles but that doesn't account for the extra road mile I walked getting to the post office.
Kent is the location of Kent School and the community seems to be on the affluent side.
I left 30 minutes later than I had planned but still made it by my 10 am deadline.  Eight miles in 3.5 hours doesn't sound like much but I had to go up St John's ledges and up Calebs Peak after that.  That averages out to be 2.2 mph with two good climbs.  Not bad for an old guy.
Drove into town with McDonald's being the first stop for a double quarter pounder with cheese and bacon, a large fry, a large sweet tea and a large strawberry shake.  Much better than dehydrated meals.
After cleaning up and laundry,  we hit Walmart for resupply.  I needed a pack cover, which Walmart didn't have, so after a nice spaghetti and meatball dinner we drove over to REI for a few things.  $112 later, I was now properly outfitted.
One last stop at Shake Shack completed the trip and it was homeward to bed.","Stewart Hollow Brook Shelter

Water Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641087,"I guess I'm just used to my hammock because once again, I did not get a good nights sleep in a bed.  The bed was firm, just the way I like it and I had a ceiling fan going for a breeze and some white noise.  Yet I still tossed and turned and didn't get a full night's sleep.
Stopped at McDonald's on the way out of town for breakfast and got dropped off at the trailhead by 830 am.  
Weather was gray and overcast but it was very muggy. The weather plus a full pack and a poor night's sleep really played havoc with my hiking speed.   I was really dragging.  A climb as the first thing in the morning didn't help.
The sun eventually made an appearance and the temperature increased as a result.  So now it was humidity,  heat, a full pack and no sleep that was working against me.
Was tempted to stop at the Bulls Bridge Country Store but decided to slug it out on the trail.  The trail followed rapids on the Housatonic River until it crossed the Ten Mile River at which point it moved inland and up to Ten Mile Hill.  I stopped at Ten Mile Shelter for lunch and got water from a well there.
I eventually made it to the CT:NY border but you wouldn't know it for lack of signage.  I was advised by signage to roadwalk around a bridge that was out.  Several northbounders told me to stay on the trail as it was easy to cross the stream.  I did find the out of service bridge and crossed it anyway.  One of the beams had broken but if you stayed close to the handrail it was fine.  In addition,  the flow in the creek was low and easily forded.   I had three much more difficult ford's in CT.  Guess NY doesn't like to take chances. 
Made it to Wiley Shelter fairly early but needed to stop to rest.  Got to talk to several northbounders about their travels and had dinner before my Zoom call with MATC.  They got a kick out of me calling in from the AT.  Guess it was the first time anyone had done that.   
I returned to the campsite (I had moved away to avoid bothering the campers with my call) to find 6 more campers had moved into the neighborhood.   It was getting crowded but I was told to expect this as I moved south closer to the bubble. 
Off to bed for a well deserved sleep.","In Laws House

Water Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641403,"Day started out nice but got hotter with the sun.
Usual ups and downs until I got to some fields and then to Route 22.  Tony's Deli is located 0.5 miles south and its a must visit.  Got a breakfast sandwich, drinks and an ice cream and also bought a sandwich to split between lunch and dinner.   Darn thing must have weighed 5 lbs.  Great deli!
A trail angel happened to be at the store and she gave me and two other hikers a ride back to the trailhead.   That's 0.5 miles I don't have to walk.  Going off trail is always a hard decision but food helps with the decision. 
The trail crosses a very active commuter rail line at the Appalachian Trail rail station.  You can take a train to NYC if you have that desire.  I didn't.
The trail follows a short boardwalk and the its up and down again.  I met three trail angels at the next road crossing. The husband/wife were giving out the normal drinks and treats while the third was a professional photographer who was taking pictures of each hiker coming by.  I was his first of the day.  This would be a proof of life photo.  
The trail finally made its way to Nuclear Lake.  Not sure how it got its name.  It wasn't glowing and the fish I saw didn't have three eyes or two heads.  But there were signs everywhere prohibiting swimming and camping although the terrain proved to be excellent camping terrain. 
Finally made it to my destination. Another nice day of hiking with feet dry and a smile on my face.","Wiley Shelter

Shortly after starting I crossed I-84 and surprisingly bypassed a deli shortly after that.  I later regretted that decision but what was done was done. 
Ran a ridge alongside the Taconic Parkway and eventually passed under it.
Made my way up to another ridge to eventually getting to Canapus Lake and more importantly the snack bar there.  Got myself some chicken fingers, fries, a drink and ice cream.  Do you see the pattern here?  Filled up my water at the fountain and proceeded out of the park.  Met the crew building a hikers building near where they allow thru hikers to camp. Appreciate the effort guys!
Not much in the way of water on the trail but my destination has potable water which is water you don't have to filter.
Camped just before the campsite in a patch of woods and met another southbounder.  God must hate me because he was an Alabama Football fan.  He did climb Katahdin but hurt himself so he moved down to CT.  He will have to go back and finish ME, NH, VT and MA.  He was a good guy who gave us his extra trail magic he had received earlier in the day.  That's what hikers do, we share what we have.

Made it to the Franciscan Friars location where camping is allowed but it was much too early and a deli wasn't far away.
The Appalachian Market is right on the trail so I stopped in for a western omelet and toast plus a few other things like a sandwich for dinner.  Thanks for putting this in a convenient location.
A short walk through a swampy area and the up I go to ridgeline.  Crossed a few roads and then descended down to the bridge that crossed the Hudson River.  Fortunately there was a sidewalk.
You then cross the road on the other side and enter a zoo!  The animals are mostly rescue animals and an attempt was made to have lots of signs to educate folks about the local biology,  botany and history.  Exiting the zoo puts you at the swimming pool for the  Bear Mtn. State Park.  It was about that time that thunder and lightning started so the pool was closed.  But more importantly,  it was also the location of vending machines.  Unfortunately the drink machine wasn't working so I had to satisfy myself with a $4 ice cream sandwich.
I continued on to the picnic area around a lake only to have the sky open up.  The place was crowded but about half of the folks were dancing around in the rain.  I put my rain gear on and continued to another vending machine where I could get a drink.
Bear Mtn was next.  Because it is a big day use area, the trail up to the top and down the backside is all steps.  I bet that there must have been over a thousand steps in all.  Vending machines welcomed me at the top along with the folks who drove up the road to get there.  After another drink, I headed down the steps and ended my day at a stealth site.","Dennytown Rd Campsite

Made it to the Palisades Parkway which you have to cross.  Wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.  There was a welcome center (can you say vending machines) about 0.2 mile north of the crossing so down I went.  Well the thunder storms knocked out the power so I was out of luck with a wasted sude trip.
Eventually made it to Lake Tiorati State Park where I was able to fill up on water.  No vending machines though.

Water Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641595,"Now the fun began.  I believe that the people who laid out the trail had a rock fetish.  The lemon sqeezer was coming up but first you had to do a bunch of rock hopping. This will become the common theme for a while.   I got to one point where I had to drop down a nearly vertical rock face.  From below it was only about 6 feet but from above it looked like 60.  My knees don't like jumping and the landing platform was small and it wouldn't have been pretty if I lost my balance upon landing.  So I took the easy route around the drop and then went up the face so I can say I did the whole trail. Basically I did a 6 foot flip flop.  In Maine, we would have installed a wooden ladder here.
Then on to the lemon squeeze which was a crevasse between two rocks.  It was quite long but just wide enough so I didn't have to take my pack off.
Shortly afterwards I crossed I-87 on a bridge.  My sights were set for Belvale Farms ice cream stand but first some ups and downs..  Finally made it by mid afternoon.   A bit pricey but I did manage to down a shake and a large ice cream.  They also had a charging station and spigot for hikers.  There was a hot dog stand nearby but it was still closed.
I hurried down the trail to find that it was much like the trail that preceded the ice cream shop, i.e. rocks and rock climbing.   i think that the ice cream shoo was in cahoots with the trail designers. Make them work hard so they will buy a lot of ice cream and then let's work that ice cream off with more work.  You did get some nice views though.  I was surprised by how wooded the area was.  Before I knew it, I was at the NY/NJ border.  It was getting late and I had a perfect hiking day with warm but breezy weather and dry rocks.  I snuck into the woods and stealth camped.","Fingerboard Shelter

Decided to go into Unionville for a breakfast sandwich and coffee.  Met two northbounders at the country store and stayed longer than normal.
I had been told about a ""secret shelter"" on the trail that had water and a donkey. I decided to skip it and move on.
The trail started to resemble New York with its boulders and rock scrambling.  Madeit to high point and went down to the state Park and took a shower.  It had been too long since my last shower.  Laundry would have to wait although I did rinse out my shirt.
Stopped at the park office where they sold Mountain House meals.  Picked up a couple along with a drink and moved on. 
Ran a ridge for a while with the normal ups and downs. Trail is getting rockier which does not bode well when I get to Pennsylvania or Rocksylvania as it's known.
Finally got to my destination and settled in with what I thought would be a big group.  It was around 6 pm which is near my normal stop time.   However, all of the young folk packed up and continued north bound as they liked to hike until dark.  This left just four of us, a couple  and another guy and me.

Ran a ridge for a good portion of the day but also did a run around a couple of lakes.   I hate lakes because they tend to be very rocky around the shoreline. 
Water was becoming an issue so after some major rock hopping,  I managed to get to the Mohican Center.  This is run by the AMC and for me it was a place to get a milkshake and water.
I have been trying to talk to people of color on the trail as part of the MATCs efforts to increase the diversity on the trail.  So far, the hikers have been very white.  There was a teacher from NYC and about 6 students of color at the center.  He started the program in an attempt to get inner city youths interested in hiking.  We talked for some time and I took his contact info for later.  I also spoke with an Hispanic fellow at Moose's trail magic.  He had a lot of good ideas and I've added him to my list.  BTW, his trail name was Flaming Hot.
More rock hopping especially around sunfish pond.  Met the ridgerunner heading in the opposite direction to handle a case of illegal camping.  I'll meet him again when he gets back to camp.

Found the church that was hiker friendly but there were no trees for my hammock and the shower wasn't ready for use just yet.I was told about a new hostel that was trying to start up.  Since it wasn't officially a hostel,  they couldn't charge for their services so it was donation based.  I called and scheduled a shuttle ride which gave me time to go down the street to a bakery.  I ordered the breakfast sandwich with coffee and also got a big vanilla whoopie pie.  My ride was ready for me when I returned to the church so off we went, which by the way was about 14 miles away.  A bit further than I expected but I was willing to try this as I could sleep in my hammock at this hostel. I was a bit appreciative on arrival to find about 6 junk cars scattered around the property.   The house was fine and the other hiker and I were shown around and given towels so we could clean up before the laundry run.   i was also provided with loner clothes to wear while doing laundry.  Loner clothes are quite common in most hostels as we do not carry extra clothing with us.  Im glad I lost weight as the clothes belonged to the owner of the hostel who was about 6 inches shorter than me and probably 25 lbs lighter.  I must have been an interesting sight..  There was a third hiker already there so once we finished our showers, we were shuttledto the laundry.  Now the truck he drove only had a front seat.  The other two hikers were female so they sat in front while I got to sit in the bed of the pickup.  The bed was covered by a cap so I wasn't exposed to the elements but I don't recall the last time I rode in a truck bed.While doing laundry, one of the other patrons approached us with an offer of free food at a local church.  We informed her that we were thru hikers and were doing fine but thanked her anyway.  I guess dressed the way we were, we did look homeless.The owners girlfriend picked us up and took us to Walmart for resupply and then to McDonald's for lunch.  Then it was back to the hostel to repack the food bag and finally into the hammock for the night.An interesting place to say the least.  The owner is a good guy who has a great dream of creating a hiker hostel.   He has a place with potential.   I hope he gets to achieve his dream.","Backpack Campsite #2

The trail was great for the first 6 miles or so giving one a false sense of hope.  All hopes were quickly dashed as the rocks started.  These rocks were similar to those seen in all the other states but the volume of rocks encountered increased as I moved south.  I did notice that the rocks were generally on level surfaces.  You climbed out of gaps on nice trails but once on the ridge, you encountered the rocks.  You also ridge walked a lot.  Unfortunately this meant no water and lots of rocks.
Made it to Wind Gap where there was a hotel that provided access to water.  Instead, I walked down the road to a convenience store 0.5 miles away.  Ice cream and sweet tea satisfied my food craving especially since I got a cup of ice for the ice tea.  I really miss ice cold drinks.A 0.5 mile walk down to a store meant a 0.5 mile walk back UP to the trail.Went back up to the ridge and eventually made it to the shelter.  There was a tight group of northbounders so I set up away from them near two older guys.  The only water was 0.7 miles down a steep slope so I decided that I had enough water to eat dinner while having some for the morning hike.Set up the tarp over the hammock as the likelihood of rain was higher than I liked.  Glad I did as it did rain for a short time.  One of the older guys was also a hammocker who didn't put his tarp up.  Well I heard a lot of commotion as he was trying to get his tarp up during the short rain event.  Guess I just guessed right.","Delaware Water Gap, PA

The trail eventually made its way to the know overlooking Palmerton PA.  I met two hikers who told me it was the worst thing they have done so far and that they didn't envy me.  With this warning,  I approached the rocks with some apprehension.  It proved to be over rated as the rocks only covered about 1/3 of the trail going down into Lehigh Gap.  In addition, the rocks were easy to maneuver so I don't know what the big deal was all about. I wanted to be able to tell them that if they thought that was tough, then they need to go home and not go to NH or ME.Once down, I decided to go into Palmerton.  The walk was a bit longer than I like (0.8 miles one way) but food beckoned.  The first place to eat was a bar so I went in for a hamburger and a beer.

Water Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642109,"Another day without rain.  Fortunately I came across a couple of water caches.  Saved me from having to go off trail to get water.  Bottled water is water I don't have to filter.Actually the trail went low enough to encounter a stream.  This is the first stream since NJ!  Didn't need water so I ventured on.  The next road crossing would have brought me to a shelter with a spigot but since I had plenty of water, I moved on.The trail turned into an old woods road which was a pleasant surprise.   I even passed another stream.  The trail was bringing me up to the Pinnacle so the number of day hikers increased.  The trail eventually moved back into the woods so it got very rocky again.  There was a huge pile of rocks near the Pinnacle.   Not sure if these were just extras but was glad they weren't on the trail.  Pinnacle had great views which was appreciated.The trail then took you to pulpit rock, another good viewpoint but it was very rocky with big rocks to maneuver over.  I don't mind the really big rocks.  They are actually easier to get over.I finally made it to the side trail to Blue Rock Campground.  This is very near Hamburg PA where Cabelas, Walmart and food is located.  There is only one hotel in Hamburg and it was full.  I decided to try the Campground and made reservations for a rustic cabin for two nights.  The Campground was 1 mile down its own trail so I wouldn't need a ride to the trailhead after the zero.The person checking me in said that they do get a few hikers staying there but it wasn't that hiker friendly.   By that I mean that they don't supply the things hikers don't carry with them like towels, soap, laundry detergent, etc.  They did have showers and a laundry so I made do with a hand towel I carry.I suggested to the host that they should provide a hikers kit that contained a towel, face cloth, body wash, shampoo and conditioner and a laundry pod but she didn't seem too interested.  The rustic cabin was a single room with a bunkbed and single bed, all with mattresses.   No linen provided.  This isn't an issue with hikers as the have their own linen (sleeping bag) but a pillow would have been nice.  Again, no interest from the host.Texted a shuttle driver to pick me up at 9 am tomorrow for a ride to Cabelas for shoes.  Got set up in the cabin, showered and did laundry and ate my dinner.  Got ice cream at the camp store and then bedtime hit.  At least the cabin is air conditioned.","Allentown Hiking Club Shelter

Water Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642354,"It was time to get back on the trail.  Made the 1 mile trek uphill back to the trail.  Mostly ridge walking once back but the rocks continued.  Not much to say as the trail appeared to be a repeat of previous days hikes.  Will make it to Port Clinton today which is just a few miles from Cabelas.  I did meet a nice maintainer who left trail magic at his truck which was parked near the trail.  We talked for a while and talked about trail maintenance and the folks we knew in common.  Most trail maintainers I've met are very dedicated and tend to mingle with other trail groups from time to time.
Finally made my way down to Port Clinton.  Was worried about crossing the busy 4 lane but found that I went under the four lane at a bridge.  Problem solved.  Got into the center of town (which was not hard as the town is very small) and started down towards the pavilion where the town allows hikers to stay.  Not far from where the AT turns, I found a curious sight.  It was a soda machine set up in someone>s yard by the sidewalk.  I thought maybe it was being thrown out but as I approached it, I found that it was functional and would take dollar bills. Soda's were only 75 cents each!  I got two and started to drink them when the homeowner came out to talk.  Once he found I was from Maine, I had to hear all of his Maine visit stories.  I've found that people either want to visit Maine or if they have, they want to tell you all about their visits.  He was a nice guy and I needed a rest so it was ok that he talked.
After my soda break, I proceeded along the trail to find that I've entered a train yard.  Just before where the AT crosses the tracks was a picnic table so I decided to take advantage of a horizontal surface with seating to have lunch.  Then it was a nice hike up and up to the ridge again for a leisurely walk to my destination (if you call walking on rocks leisurely).  Water was becoming an issue again as there are few streams on ridgetops.  I did find a couple of water caches left at trailheads which helped a lot.  Without the caches, I'm not sure what I would have done other than walk the 0.6 miles down to a possible water source.

It's been 70 days since I started this trek.  I'm glad that I've made it this far but was hoping to be a bit further along the trail by now.  I've got 61 more days until my self imposed deadline of Sept 30.  Since I've got 1,192 miles to go, I've got to maintain a daily mileage of 19.5 mpd and that's without any zeros or low mileage days for resupply.  I've got to get my mileage up to 25 mpd to give me some downtime.
The day was once again nice and sunny.  Not too hot since the slight breeze helped.  The trail is just a repeat of many of the past days.  I was told that once I got to Duncannon, I can expect fewer rocks.  I sure hope so!
Once again, water caches helped but I did stop at the 501 Shelter.  A caretaker lives next door and there is a faucet on the outside of his house that hikers can use.  There were also two Porta-Potties for hikers.  I took advantage of both the PP and the water.
The remainder of the day was the green tunnel paved with rocks.  I'd get to short sections which were nice, but then it was rock city.  I even suspected that the maintainers added rocks to the trail to make it more challenging.
I was looking forward to Duncannon and the shower/laundry that it offered.  It's pretty bad when you can't stand your own stink.  There are no streams to rinse the salt out of your shirt or other pieces of apparel.

Water Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642356,"Got an later start than usual, although the terrain didn't change much.  I did have to descend to cross I-81 and then ascend back up to the ridge.  I'm noticing that the downs and ups are coming with more rocks which is unlike that seen in Northern PA.  I finally had to descend one more time to find a warning about the trail being flooded by the actions of some busy beavers.  Based upon information provided by northbounders, rather than take the longer walk around, I decided to proceed on the AT and cross on the beaver dam.  Like the other areas I was advised to avoid, this one was no big deal and I managed to cross with feet dry.
I then found myself next to a stream, one of the few still running, but it was very acidic from the mine runoff.  There was a remediation project in place to have some of the acid water flow through a cistern that contained limestone.  The limestone would dissolve and help to increase the pH of the water.  It was enough to provide a good habitat for fish, where otherwise the fish would have died.  I decline to use this water for obvious reasons.
Made it to the shelter and found Eor there.  He was a Special Forces Medic in his previous life and had a twin brother still in the military.  We talked for some time and I really enjoyed his company.  There was a spring at the shelter so I took advantage of that water source.  Another thru hiker joined us but I set up a short distance away so I didn't really interact much with them once I set up.

Can't say much about the day other than it was ridge running on rocks which pretty much describes PA.  I did have to descent to Route 325 and then back again to the ridge.  I noticed that the trail didn't quite go all the way up to the ridge as the ridge consisted of a continuous line of very large boulders.  I was pleased that the trail didn't go over the boulders like it would have in NY but the trail was still rocky enough as it was.
I thought that there was going to be another down and then up on Route 225 but I was pleased to find a bridge over the road which didn't require going down and then up.  A water cache and a piece of fruit was my reward at the other end of the bridge.
The day was another repeat with good weather and rocks.  Finally made it to the shelter and spent the night with a group of locals occupying a good hammock site and one lone northbounder who came in after dark.  The site had a reasonable stream for water and a privy, both of which I require.  I mentioned to one couple that I'm not a bear in the woods!  I like my privies.","Rausch Gap Shelter

There is an old hotel in town that is a hiker favorite.  Don't know why.  It appeared to be very decrepit.  Not air conditioned and the service was sketchy. I decided not to stay there. 
Unfortunately the laundry didn't have a bathroom so I put my rain kilt on and removed my dirty shorts in the laundrymat.  Got everything nice and clean and once dry, put the shorts back on.  I'm glad I was the only one there.
As I made my way back to the church, I passed a bar and grill.  Passing isn't quite correct as I went in and got a couple of beers and a hamburger.  Once my hunger was satisfied, I returned to the church and then made my way up to a local grocery store.  The store is nice to hikers and will provide a return shuttle trip for free.  Got what I needed for resupply and got back to the church (thanks to the store shuttle) and repacked my backpack.  Since there wasn't a place to hang my hammock in the church yard, I decided to hit the road and get a couple of miles between me and Duncannon.  I was looking forward to a rock free trail.
Met a SOUTHbounder as I was leaving the church.  Magic Mike had started on Katahdin and he was the first southbounder that I've met.  He mentioned that there was a lady doing crazy miles who was in the lead now.
Magic Mike was staying at the outfitters who also offered hostel services.  We parted ways and I continued my roadwalk for a couple of miles to another ascent up to a ridge.  I was getting worried as the rocks seemed to be a prevalent as before but I was willing to give it some time to see if the rocks really did go away as I was told.

Worked the ridge for a while and then descended down to the valley floor then back up to the Darlington Shelter.  Didn't stop as I didn't need water at the time.  It was descending time to the valley again and then a flat walk (with fewer rocks) through wooded areas with lots of vines. No possibility for camping here.  Followed a river for some time and then started with fields of what looked like soybean.  I had expected corn but that looked like last years crop.
Crossed I-81 again and then had a lot of road crossings along with farm fields of soybean.  The trail eventually paralleled a home where it came out to a road.  A northbounder was sitting at the road eating lunch.  We spoke for a while and the homeowner came over with two beers.  He said it was his 70th birthday so he went to get himself a beer and we all toasted his birthday.  He was a great guy, vietnam veteran and a former firefighter.  We all parted company a bit happier with ourselves.Did pass a farmstand where I bought a cold drink, a chocolate milk made with whole raw milk and two peaches.  The stand was run by a Mennonite lady and it was in a great place for hikers.Managed to make it through the 14 miles of no water or camping to Boiling Springs.  Stopped at a convenience store for drinks and ice cream and then proceeded to head out again for the next shelter.  I first had to cross numerous fields of corn (finally) and then had to climb up to the shelter.  It is strange that most of my end of days were climbs.  Do they purposely put these shelters on top of ridges?  Once again, alone with myself.","Cove Mountain Shelter

You approach the town from the north along a smooth trail that borders the Potomac River.  You then have to use a walkway along a railroad bridge to get over to the town.  The walkway has to be rebuilt a couple of years ago when a train derailment damaged the walkway.  Glad they fixed it in time for my hike.

I also want to address the issue of rocks.  I've been lied to by nearly all of the NOBOs I've met.  They all assured me that the rocks diminish as you move south from Duncannon, PA. This is a bunch of BS and I found Maryland nearly as rocky as PA.  West Virginia, which has the fewest AT miles (around 6 miles) was still rocky too although the trail was getting better.
It was a very warm day so I started as early as possible which meant 7 am.  crossed the Shenandoah River and then up to the ridge for some ridge walking.  Water was an issue so I stopped at a caretaker cabin for water where I met a northbounder doing his second AT hike.  He was taking his time and would probably flip at Harpers Ferry to Katahdin and then come south.

After a series of ups and downs, not big ones but still effort has to be expended on the ups, I reach Route 522.  As I got closer to the main road, I began to follow a substantial chain link fence with barbed wire at the top.  Wonder who would spend the money to install such a structure because it was substantial.
At Route 522, there was an opportunity to get water at a B&B.  The place was closed as this was the lull between NOBO and SOBO bubbles.  I went up to the house to find a couple of contractors working on an old chicken coop.  They indicated that it wouldn't be a problem to get water from the hose at the house so I started to fill up my bottles and douse my head with the cold water.  While I was doing this, the owners returned and I got to talk to the male owner.  He was very accommodating and gave me an AT medallion that he gives to all of the hikers who stay there.  He also offered to let me look through the hiker box but I declined as I was already carrying a pretty big load.
Hiker boxes are common at hostels and many hotels near the trail.  These are boxes where hikers leave any excess items that they don't want to carry.  It often contains food items, medical items, partially filled fuel canisters, etc. I've heard of people getting sleeping bags, shoes and other costly items from these boxes so it's always prudent to look through the boxes whenever you come across one to see if there is anything you need.
It turns out that the person who spent the money to install the substantial fence is none other than Uncle Sam.  The facility is run by the Smithsonian Institute and they keep exotic animals there, hence the tall fence. I didn't see any but then it was hot and they were probably all in the shade somewhere.
The climb out of the road was tough as it bordered the fence and went uphill for some time through an open field.  Very hot in the sun and it really took some effort to get up to the woods where it was cooler.
Finally made it to the Tom Floyd Wayside.  Now in the Shenandoah's, waysides meant milk shakes and cold drinks.  This was just a shelter and one built at quite an altitude.  There was still water flowing at the spring but it was at least a 0.2 mile walk DOWN to the spring which meant it was a 0.2 mile walk back UP to the shelter.  The area was built on a slope with tent sites scattered quite a distance from one another.  I heard voices near dark so I knew others were staying in the area but I couldn't see them.

Anyway, I had my form which allowed me to camp pretty much anywhere unless told otherwise.The trail became very nice.  The first few miles are shared with a horse path so the path was smooth and rock free.  Unfortunately the sign posts left a bit to be desired.  They were square concrete columns with a galvanized or aluminum band around the post near the top that had the directions to various trails etc. embossed on the band.  So it was hard to read in low light conditions.  I missed the first one and ended up going 0.5 miles in the wrong direction which meant I had to retrace my 0.5 miles back to the trail.  A mile wasted.I was looking for the Elkswallow wayside which was essentially a store that sold tourist stuff, food stuff and more importantly cooked food and shakes.  The weather was deteriorating but still no rain.  I investigated a side trail adding another 0.5 miles round trip without finding the wayside. I finally found the wayside trail but went in the wrong direction adding another 2 miles round trip to my day.  So even though I reported 17.5 miles today, I actually hiked 20 miles when all was said and done.I did make it to the wayside before they closed and ordered 2 cheeseburgers, 2 shakes and some fries.  I also got two gatoraids, and a blueberry muffin for the morning. Spent over $40.I couldn't eat the cheeseburgers so I packed them up for tonight and tomorrow morning for breakfast.  I was also able to charge my phone as I ate so it was a productive day.  It started to rain as I was eating my meal so I moved to a covered area by the rest rooms.  After finishing and packing up, I returned to the trail in a light rain.  My original destination was another shelter 5 miles down the trail but the rain and the extra hiking convinced me to find a couple of trees to set up my home for the evening.  Fortunately, two trees are not hard to find in a forest.The hiking today wasn't too bad.  Mostly walking a nice trail in a heavily wooded area so no views.  The endless green tunnel.Rained a bit through the night but I stayed nice and dry.","Tom Floyd Wayside

Water Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643148,"When resupplying, I like to get into town early so I usually stay close to a resupply point and then do the short walk to a pickup point.  The Hostel was great.  I was picked up at the trailhead and brought into town.  After the orientation, I gave the proprietor my clothing to wash and went up to shower.  She had loaner clothes so I didn't have to wear by rain coat and rain kilt.I was brought into town by her assistant for a McDonald's run and then I set up my hammock outside.  I don't usually get a good night's sleep now in a bed so I like it when I can use my hammock at a hostel.  Plus I get charged less to do so.Later that afternoon, I was brought back into town to resupply at the Walmart.  Luray is known for it's caverns so we went by there to see a very full parking lot of cavern viewers.  On the way back to the hostel, I ordered takeout from a local Italian restaurant and was brought out once again to pick up my dinner.  That was three shuttle rides into town and of course the pick up and drop off at the trailhead.  I was able to get a couple of beers as take out to go with my Stromboli.  It was a good dinner.Headed to bed to find that the rail line parallel to the main road was active and loud.  Finally got to sleep around midnight.We settled our bill that evening as we were all leaving early the next morning.  For laundry, shower and full house privilege's only cost me $18.  That included all the shuttles.I would highly recommend the Open Arms Hostel.","Stealth Site @ 951.7 Miles

Water Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643150,"I hate the first hiking day after resupply as the pack is the heaviest it's going to be for that segment.  The pack usually weighs up to 35 lbs. when water is included.  I pack for 5 days while most other hikers pack for 3 days at the most.  I prefer fewer stops.
It was a gray day but not bad for hiking as it wasn't super hot.  Immediately had to climb up to Mary's Rock and then it was ridge running for a while.  Stopped at a picnic area expecting water to find that the water was turned off.  Very disappointing.
The trail had been rerouted to bring you through Skyland Resort so I stopped by the cafe to see what they had to eat.  It was disappointing too as they only had a few things.  I got a muffin, coffee and an ice tea.  Too much walking for the return on investment.
There was another wayside coming up but it was too far off the trail so I bypassed it.  Water wasn't an issue on the trail and the trail remained very nice.
The animals in the Shenandoah's aren't afraid of people as hunting isn't allowed near the trail.  I came upon a group of turkeys consisting of two hens and 14 young birds. They slowly moved off the trail and waited patiently while I moved by and were not too concerned about my presence.
I also came across two doe who finally did move off the trail but only enough for me to get by.  I could have touched one of them as she was busy eating at a bush and didn't want to move.
When stealth camping I like to get to a high point to maximize my chances of having cell service, so up to Hazeltop I went.  On the other hand, I hate late day climbs.  
The trail basically parallels Skyline Drive, crossing it at numerous points.  I camped a short distance from one of those crossings on top of Hazeltop.  It was a nice evening but I decided to set up my rain tarp just in case.

Water Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643151,"Another gloomy day but good for hiking.  Had a good climb up Bearfence Mtn.  The climbs aren't too bad as the philosophy here is to use a lot of switchbacks.  You end up going further but it's an easier climb.  Followed Skyline Drive the whole way but that meant you could hear a lot of traffic noise.  Went by a campground where the drinking fountains were set in large rocks.  But alas, the water was also turned off.  I had to go into the bathrooms to replenish my water supply.
From Bearfence, I went by another campground. Lots of tents.  Then it was contour following Skyline Drive.  Hoping to get water at the South River Picnic Area but that was dry too.  Not sure why the faucets are turned off.  Then it was up to Hightop, a 3,500 foot peak, followed by a series of going down to a gap and then up to a peak.  A gap is the low spot on the saddle between peaks.  Since you are up high, the opportunity to get water is very limited.  I went down into Simmons Gap to the Ranger Station to get water from a spigot.  No one was around so I got my water and took off. Since I was in a gap, the trail then went back up to Weaver Mountain but it was only 2,854 feet so it was no big deal.
Finally made it to Pinefield Hut, after climbing out of Pinefield Gap.  A small flow from a spring fed stream was available and appreciated.  Once again, I was alone.","Stealth Site @ 922.3 Miles

Ups and downs again.  I passed a wayside but it was 0.6 mile off the trail DOWN a steep grade.  I declined to go.  Instead, I stopped at the Loft Mountain Camp Store which had everything I needed, i.e. ice cream, snacks, drinks and water.  The day was hot but cloudy.  Had to go around the campground once I finished eating my fill.  Pretty much followed the contour of the land for a while as I also followed the Blue Ridge Parkway.  Crossed the parkway several times and then it was mindless walking in the forest.  My stop time of 6:30 pm finally arrived and I was still quite a distance from a shelter so I moved off the trail and found a couple of tree to accommodate my hammock.  It was on a flat area not too far from the Parkway.  Probably wasn't the required 1/4 mile from a road but then I didn't care.","Pinefield Hut

The next phase of the trail goes through the Blue Ridge Mountains and follows the Blue Ridge Parkway.  It is an immediate transition from Skyline Drive to the Blue Ridge Parkway.  The weather was gray while I was in the Shenandoah's but the sun came out when I hit the trail that started in the Blue Ridge Mountains.  I felt that was a good sign.  Plus there were three or four spots with good water so things were looking up.I had to cross I-64 to get to the Blue Ridge Mountain portion of the trail.  I was hoping that there would be a convenience store or gas station where I could get something cold to drink but all that was at the interchange was an abandoned hotel and closed gas station.Met a couple of day hikers on the trail but no thru hikers.  The trail was nice and clear but there was a climb in my future.  The weather was going to turn wet with the afternoon thunderstorm and it was getting late so I pulled off to the side of the trail and set up camp.  I try to pull far enough off trail so I'm not too obvious to a hiker. The unofficial campsites listed in my app are usually right on the trail.  I would have to climb Humpback Mtn tomorrow.","Stealth Site @ 877.1 Miles

Water Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643166,"Another beautiful but hot day.  The trail followed the BRP quite closely for some time until it deviated from the trail at Meadow Mountain.  Lots of contour hiking.  I'm not a big fan of contour hiking.  You aren't really going up or down too much but the trail is usually sloped a little so the lower foot is at an awkward angle.  Not much to say for today other than it was a nice hike day and I didn't encounter anything that wanted to bite or sting me.I do encounter a lot of spiders.  I had the same problem in Maine.  Since there were so few people hiking in the opposite direction, there is no one to knock down the webs that spiders like to make across the trail.  In most instances, the web is a single strand across the trail.  However, if given enough time, the spider will then spin it's web from the single strand and it gets messy as you try to extricate yourself from the sticky mess.  In most instances, the web is spun in a sunny area where flying insects are likely to be found.  I look like an idiot as I constantly wave my trekking poles in front of me to knock down the webs.  I get tired of this and after a while, I feel like I'm covered with webs.  This wasn't a problem when there were a lot of northbounders because they kept the webs knocked down.  We need more people on the trail.  I did notice that it doesn't take the spiders long to remake their single strand as I've encountered them 30-45 minutes after passing another hiker.Made it to Harpers Creek Shelter.  It had a good water source so that was appreciated.  There was one other person tent camping on the other side of the creek so we didn't interact.Set up with rain in mind although it didn't rain.","Stealth Site @ 856.3 Miles

I plan to hike as far as I can to minimize the number of miles I need to do to get into town.  I like to get into town early so I can resupply and clean up before dark.  The trail was fairly accommodating but there were still the usual ups and downs and contour following.  Water was something of an issue but I found enough to satisfy my needs.
I first had to go through the Three Ledges wilderness area with a couple of good climbs and a lot of contour hiking.  I then had to maneuver the Priest which is a 4,000+ summit in the Priest Wilderness area.  It was quite a workout.  Both areas offered good views of Virginia.  This is the first time where views were plentiful and expansive.  The ledges followed the Priest and good views were plentiful.  Moving quickly as the trail was nice, I made it to Salt Log Gap.  It was getting close to 6 pm so I decided to continue on to a ridge to ensure good cell coverage.  This brought me to Tar Jacket Ridge.  I found a couple of nice trees well off the trail and set up home.  Dinner and filtering water ended the day and I cowboy camped with a full moon.  Made the mistake of positioning the hammock so I was staring at the moon.  It was way too bright.  But somehow I managed to go to sleep.","Harpers Creek Shelter

Water Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643210,"Had about 7 miles to go before I got to Route 60 where I would be picked up.  The tops of Tar Jacket Ridge are fields (or balds as they are called here).  This provided great views.  I'm surprised how remote the area looks.  I knew that there would be at least one if not more climbs with 7 miles to go so I headed up to Cole Mtn. at 3,970 feet and then down to Cow Camp Gap.  The balds were used for grazing of cattle so the folks handling the cows would camp down in the gap.  Since there was a gap, that meant another climb up to Bald Knob at 4,045 feet.  Then thankfully it was all downhill to Route 60.I met The Dude at the road talking to another hiker who was just starting a day hike.  The hiker gave us both a large Gatorade which was greatly appreciated.  I had arranged for Mr. Leonard, the manager of the Budget Inn to pick me up at 11 am.  I got to the road at 10:30 am so it gave me a little time to rest and change my shirt.  Mr. Leonard arrived on time and we made our way down a winding road, 9 miles to the hotel.  I was a bit apprehensive about what I would find for a $60/night motel but it was clean and the clientele were mostly contractors.  It had a Subway right in the complex, a Burger King across the street and a Hardee's just a short distance down the street.  It also had a Food Lion and a Dollar General about a mile away.  I got cleaned up and did my laundry and then went to Hardee's for lunch.  Afterwards, Mr. Leonard dropped me off at the Food Lion and I resupplied.  No dehydrated meals this time so I picked up some Knorr side dishes and some chicken packets for dinner.  Also picked up a packet of instant potatoes with bacon since this seemed to be a popular dish on the trail.Back at the hotel, I repacked everything and picked up a couple of beers at the convenience store attached to Burger King and got a burger at BK for dinner.  I was bushed so it was time for bed.","Stealth SIte @ 816.3

Water Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643211,"I decided that I needed to sleep in so I asked Mr. Leonard for a return trip to the trailhead at 11 am.  This allowed me to sleep until 8 am and after another shower, I headed over to Hardee's for breakfast.  It was a busy place for a Sunday morning and looked like a lot of regulars were coming in to have breakfast.
As I headed back, I stopped in at the convenience store and picked up a couple of honey buns since it was such a long walk back to the hotel.  Mr. Leonard, who happened to be the only employee there since he lived in the office building, was able to break free earlier so I got to the trailhead at 11 am.  
I expected to have to hike up as I usually did but the trail actually followed a stream down so it was a nice reprieve from the normal climb I have each morning.  The trail went through an area that had been a small village of freed slaves.  They sold out the land to the NPS in 1920 so there was nothing left of the area except the signs describing what had been there.
Had to go around a big reservoir which was a nice green and you could tell the level was very low.  Then it was a lot of contour walking.  I hope that this doesn't make one of my legs longer than the other.  The weather was sunny and hot and the spiders were out in force.  The downward trend of the trail eventually ended once I got to the base of Punchbowl Mtn.  Punchbowl was followed quickly by Bluff Mtn.  I started to look for my nightly home as it was getting late and I found a nice spot in Salt Log Gap, which was the second Salt Log Gap so far.  The gap didn't offer much in terms of good trees but I could see some nice ones up on the ridge that paralleled the trail.  So up I went to find an old campsite with fire ring right on the top of the ridge.  Two trees were found and I made camp.  My hammock was positioned to give me a great view of the sunrise but first I had to deal with the full moon.  It was so bright, it was almost like daylight.
I was happy with my progress for the day since I started at 11 am.  I was maintaining my 2 mph rate so I would have gone about an easy 20 miles if I had started earlier.","Budget Inn, Buena Vista

Water Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643213,"Once again the day started off nice with some cool breezes.  These were driven away once the sun got up and heated everything up.  Contour walking started the day once I got off the ridge.  The trail eventually got me to Big Rocky Row and Little Rocky Row which were a series of cliffs that offered more views.  The elevation wasn't much at ~2,500 feet but it was nice to see things further away than your feet.
The trail brought me down and down to the James River which is crossed via a very long footbridge.  You then entered the James Rive Face Wilderness area.  Not sure how it got that name.  Ups and downs and contour walking was the name of the game as you dodged spider webs.  This continued for some time and was getting tiring.  The trail eventually came back to the Blue Ridge Parkway at one point and I didn't want to camp too close to the road so I continued on where the trail and parkway deviated a bit more. It was getting late so I found a couple of trees, probably a bit closer to the trail than I would have liked but elevated so I had cell coverage and made myself at home.
The problem with contour following is that there are no good campsites available as one side of the trail goes up at a steep angle and the other side goes down at a very steep angle.  I could find a couple of trees to hang my hammock on but I would have to be careful getting out of the hammock as the slope was very steep.  I like high or low spots as I mentioned because there are usually level areas for camping.
Another night of cowboy camping and wasn't disturbed by any one or any thing.  I'll be happy to get to a better spot on the trail as this area is proving to be boring.  I can now see why folks wear ear buds and listen to music.  I usually get a song stuck in my head and repeat the damn things over and over again.  Will have to have the wife send me my earbuds.  She had sent me the typical plug in earbuds but my phone doesn't have a headphone jack so I can't use them.  And they call that progress.","Salt Log Gap @ 794.6 miles
",Stealth Site on Thunder Ridge @ 774.7 Miles,"Aug 23, Mon",19.90
Water Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643215,"Started as a very hot day.  The trail was very quiet with no breeze to speak of.  I happened upon a nest of stinging insects.  Don't know which ones they were because I didn't stick around to identify them.  I got stung once which is usually when you realize there is a nest nearby.
People ask me if I'm afraid of anything on the trail.  One of my brother-in-laws things I should have a gun with me.  I have to carry everything I have on my back and a gun would represent about 5 lbs of unnecessary weight. If I'm going to carry any extra weight, it will be food and water.
I'm not worried about bears as they don't want to be around you either.  I've not met anyone I've been afraid to hang around, rather I've met some really nice folks I would otherwise not interact with in normal life.  Snakes don't bother me as they usually notify you of their presence and you can get around them.
The first of the two things I'm most afraid of is stinging insects.  You rarely know they are around until you are right on top of them and then it's too late.  In addition, the one guy who stings you sends a signal to the others for reinforcement, so if there is one, there will be more unless you leave the area quickly.  I'm fortunate as I don't appear to be allergic to the stings.  I've talked to a few folks whose body parts swelled up to twice the size when stung.  When I get stung, it just hurts for a few hours and then it goes away.
The second thing I'm most afraid of is GRAVITY.  Gravity makes things fall down.  I've never fallen UP, it's always been DOWN.  And gravity has a helper.  That pack I'm wearing can be as much as 35 lbs. when fully loaded after a resupply stop.  So that 35 lbs. of dead weight makes certain that I not only fall DOWN but I do so in an expeditious and complete manner.  Now, once you've fallen, you are in an awkward position on the ground often laying on top of your trekking poles.  After assessing any damage, you then need to get up but being 67 years old with two bad shoulders, there is no way I can get up with the pack still secured to my back.  I'm sure 20 somethings or even 30 somethings can get right up but not me.  So now I have to unbuckle both the waist strap and the breast strap to get the pack off.  This is sometimes difficult as in most cases, the buckles are between you and the ground.
There is one situation which is even worse.  It's when you are on a nice section of trail and you have a good head of steam.  You've built up a good bit of momentum but unfortunately, you eye missed the root that is sticking out horizontally from the side of the trail  Don't worry, your foot didn't miss the root and the root won't let go.  So, you now are falling down with the aid of gravity and that dead weight on your back but that momentum you built up is not still moving you forward so instead of a nice fall down, you fall at an angle and do a face plant with a little skidding added for good measure.  I can see the pack, gravity and momentum all doing high fives as they watch the old man crash and burn. 
The other reason I don't like gravity is that it also helps to make trees and branches fall.  I can hear them fall on quiet nights while laying in my hammock.  I take great pains in trying to find my two trees without any dead trees nearby.  That is more difficult to do and I've had to camp near dead trees as there were no other alternatives.  I check the weather to see if it's going to be windy but as I said, I've heard branches fall on a quiet windless night.  That's how fickle gravity can be.
So that's what scares me but I can generally prevent most falls by stopping when I'm tired and not walking too fast.  I protect myself from falling objects by picking a good campsite.  As for stinging insects, I just try to avoid them if I can and I grin and bear the pain for the short time it hurts.  Ibuprophen works too.Cove Mountain shelter was a no water shelter.  I carried an extra 3 liters of water about 4 miles to have what I needed for the evening and the next day.  Carrying water is getting common now as the trail is very dry.  I only met a maintainer at another shelter but didn't meet any hikers today.  Cove Mtn shelter isn't popular because there is no water there so I had the whole place to myself.  I haven't camped with anyone else for some time.","Stealth Site on Thunder Ridge @ 774.7 Miles

Not much to say about the day as it was hot and ridge running meant you are in the sun a bit more than normal. Sun meant hot and spiders.
I actually got to the shelter at 5 pm so I could have made it to the hotel by about 7:30 pm but I held up as usual and set up camp away from the shelter because there was a sign saying that there was a rattlesnake behind the shelter.  The shelter was unusual as it had a cistern which collected water from the shelters roof during rain events.  There was plenty of water so I got my fill and then some.  I don't believe the shelter is used much by NOBOs as it's too close to the trailhead and SOBOs may just go into town unless they want to save money by staying in a shelter.
It was a nice area and of course it required the usual climb UP at the end of the day.  It was positioned right on top of the knob.  I cowboy camped but did stretch my tarp over me ready to be deployed in the event it did rain.  It didn't!  I could see the lights of the town below so it was comforting to know civilization was not too far away.

Turns out it was someone going in the same direction.  Was it a SOBO?  I hurried up to see if I could catch this hiker and eventually did.  The hiker (Thumper) was indeed a SOBO and was heading into town to the same hotel  His girlfriend was about a mile behind us so I'd be with two SOBO's which is unprecedented.When I told him my trail name he knew of me and had been hearing about me for some time so it was nice to be recognized.  We made it down to the main road and then hit a bunch of fields.  We were now in full sun and some of the fields were very sloped and the climb to the top was very strenuous.  I left Thumper under the I-81 bridge where he would wait for his girlfriend.  I continued on to Route 220 which represented the end of this segment of the Northern Virginia Guthook map.  What did I find next to the road but a convenience store.  I immediately went in and got a Gatorade, a large lemonade and I was going to buy two little Debbie honey buns but the gal at the counter told me that the honey buns were 4/$1.00 or $0.50 each so I could get two more for the same price as two.  So being the thrifty person I am, I got four and ate all of them in one sitting while downing the two drinks.  The roadwalk to the hotel wasn't long but it wasn't designed for pedestrians.  I got to the hotel just before 11 am and because of my status with Holiday Inn, I was able to check in and get into my room right away.  I showered and did laundry and then went across the street to the Cracker Barrel for a meal of meat loaf, macaroni and cheese, hash brown casserole and I topped it off with peach cobbler and ice cream for dessert.  And don't forget the multiple glasses of sweet tea.Roanoke was still quite a distance away so I decided to rent a car from Enterprise (because they pick you up and drop you off) so I could easily do my errands and pick up my supplies.  I also decided to go into Roanoke tomorrow to give platelets at the Red Cross Blood Center because the Red Cross had been bugging the heck out of me to get me to come in to donate.After a nice nap, I picked up my car at 5 pm and returned to the hotel.  Thumper and his girlfriend Locomotion were put in the room next to mine so I went over and told them I had a car and I planned to go into Roanoke to a brewery downtown.  Thumper was all for that but Locomotion decided to stay at the hotel and eat locally.Thumper and I had a great time at the brewery.  It turns out Thumper works as an inspector of pressure vessels and heavy equipment in the same industries I work in during my career so we had something in common.  As he said, it was nice to talk about something other than hiking.  This was the longest I had talked to one human since I started hiking the trail.  I hope that it continues with other folks as well.  Guess I do miss human contact.Returned to the hotel and had my usual difficult time getting to sleep.  Wonder if they would let me set up my hammock in my room.","Fullhardt Knob Shelter @ 735.3 miles

I prepared to leave and found Thumper and Locomotion in the breakfast area.  I agreed to take them to the UPS store to ship a package.  I decided rather than go to the post office to ship my package, instead I too would ship via UPS. I decided to send my base layers and wool cap home.  Also sent my old shoes home.  I'm glad I got the Altras as they are much lighter than the Merrils I've been wearing.  They say every pound on your feet is like 2 lbs on your back.  Wife sent my Kindle but all I needed was the SD card which has my music on it.  I took the card out and put it into my phone so I could listen to music without the need to be online.

Walked over to Subway for a salad since I needed some vegetables for a change.  Also got a sweet tea because I'm in the south and everyone sells sweet tea.  And of course I picked up a pint of ice cream.  I weighed myself on the scale at the hotel.  It showed 167 as my weight.  The scale was one with the weights you moved along a horizontal bar.  Plus I was only wearing a long sleeve pullover and my rain kilt.  When weighed at the Red Cross my weight was 177 but I was wearing shoes, socks, long pants and a tee shirt.  I know the clothes didn't weigh 10 lbs so my weight is somewhere between 177 and 167.  I hope I've gained a pound or two since I've eaten a bunch of high calory food during this zero.
Hope I get to sleep tonite or it will be a long day tomorrow.","Holiday Inn Express @ 730.3

Water Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643497,"Been hearing about the Virginia Triple Crown.  This consists of Tinkers Cliffs, McAfee Knob and Dragon Tooth.  I started out climbing up to the crest of the ridge near a power line.  I met a SOBO named Geo on the way and we continued together.  He's 3 years younger than me but has a similar beard.  He's 6 feet tall but weighs just 150 lbs. He also holds a forestry degree but then got a Masters of Mechanical Engineering when he was laid off.  So we have relatively similar backgrounds in that we were both foresters who ended up retiring from unrelated career.  He too held a technical role and acted as a troubleshooter for his company too.  Very nice man and I've enjoyed his company.
Tikers cliffs were just run of the mill cliffs.  I've seem better.  McAfee Knob is iconic for the photo you can take there.  It's a rock outcropping that has you sitting on a rock that hangs way out with no support.   We lucked out.  The place was empty so we were able to get each other's picture quickly.   Usually there is a ton of folks up there and you have to wait.
The distance between the first and last of the triple crown is 30 miles so Dragons Tooth will have to wait until tomorrow.   We continued on the trail.  It was a bit rocky but not excessively so.  
I parted company with Geo at the last shelter before a road crossing.  He was being picked up by a friend and I was about to make new friends.
I found 4 guys from Cincinnati who hike together once or twice a year.  They were interested in thru hiking so after I set up, I joined them at the picnic table.  It was an enjoyable evening trading different experiences from the trail.  Turned out that one of the guys worked near Alexandria LA, where my wife grew up so we shared stories and memories of the area.  Nice to have commonality with someone.

I left both of them and proceeded on.  I knew I wasn't going to make the next shelter but wanted to make a few more miles.  It was supposed to rain later that afternoon so I hustled down the trail.Once on the ridgecagain, the trail was very reasonable with the normal repeating short ups and downs.  Came to Audie Murphy' memorial which is near where his plane crashed and he was killed. I hurried down the trail only to see the first of a couple thunder storms heading my way.  I quickly set up off the trail and made supper during which it started to rain.  I was able to harvest 3 liters of water off my tarp so I didn't have to carry water this time.Then off to bed.","John's Spring Shelter @ 711.5

Continued back up to the ridge where I was joined by Geo again.  He had been dropped off by a friend and managed to catch up with me.  It was nice hiking with someone again but he kept a blistering pace resulting in a 23 mile day for me.
Passed a sign indicating that we crossed the eastern continental divide.  Then it was ridge walking for some time.
The trail eventually dropped down to cow pastures.  We made our way to a turn in the trail with trail going all over the place.  We saw what we thought was a white blaze on a metal fence post and followed the most obvious trail down to a garage where three guys were working on a car.  We just followed a cow path and not the trail but we did load up on water before we backtracked to where we made the wrong turn.  We did finally find a blaze hidden behind a bush and successfully returned to the trail.  I think the cows made all these trails on purpose to screw with hikers.
Passed the Keffer Oak which is the largest oak on the AT in the south.  It was huge!
Ups and downs followed with more fields to cross.  Don't care for fields as they expose you to sunlight and are hot.  or In the early morning, they represent wet shoes from the dew.
We stopped at the Laurel Creek Shelter to eat lunch and I got to meet Angus. Geo had met him before.  We talk talked a bit but Angus was planning on staying at the shelter while we were heading to the next shelter so we parted company..  More ridge walking followed with some downs and ups as we hit roads that the AT crossed.   Finally made it to the shelter.  Geo and I were the only people there.  Geo was also a hammocker but there were plenty of trees for both of us.","Stealth Site @ 692.7 miles

Water Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643737,"You may be surprised by the short mileage day.  It was because Ida was coming in and we knew we couldn't get to the next shelter before it started to rain. So being the cautious types, we held up early.  We actually felt guilty doing so because we stopped very early in the day.
Even though it was only about 13 miles, it took us until 2 pm since the trail turned very rocky, reminiscent of Pennsylvania.   The trail was annoying as it was rocky and it generally followed the contours below the ridge so there was nothing much to see.
We passed a large group of college students heading to the Laurel Creek Shelter.  This was an activity they did during college orientation week.  Probably didn't plan on Ida.
Geo and I were the only two at the shelter and we quickly found trees to set up our hammocks.  Two hikers eventually showed up and told us about a mother and her three kids heading our way.  These hikers were just heading to a road crossing not far away so they left.
We no more got our tarps up when it started to rain lightly.  Once our hammocks were up and our sleep systems complete, we got into the shelter to sit, talk and eat.
The family eventually showed up.  It was a mother with her three very grown up children, two girls and a guy.  The three females were named Head, Shoulder, and Toes.  A third daughter (Knees) didn't want to hike this time. Mom was Toes.  We spent some time learning about each other as we prepared dinner.  The family set up in the shelter.
Angus eventually arrived as well and set up in the shelter too.  Angus was a retired army JAG lawyer who liked to hike but did so at a slower pace.
It started to rain harder so Geo and I retired to our hammocks and settled in for the night.  We planned to get up and on trail by 630 am so we needed our beauty sleep.","War Spur Shelter @ 669.4 miles

It was still dark so we had to use our headlamps for about 30 minutes or so.  First time hiking with my headlamp.  I only had a 20 mile day but Geo was shooting for 27 miles so we had to get an early start.
There was little wind last night but it picked up this morning.  A light rain started early as well so we we're in our raingear.   
The trail quickly switchbacked us up to the top of the ridge where we stayed for most of the day.  It rained off and on as we quickly moved along the ridge.  Geo eventually outpaced me so I was alone again which is normal for most hikers, even those in groups.  The trail wasn't well maintained and was overgrown so that also slowed me down a bit.
I eventually made it past the powerline that collapsed in an ice storm last winter.  It had closed this part of the trail.  Glad it was all fixed as I hate it when you have to divert around a closure.  Usually means road walking.
It was foggy along this part of the ridge and I almost missed the turnoff to a shelter.  I figured Geo was in the shelter waiting for me while he ate his lunch and sure enough there he was.  I fixed my normal bagel with peanut butter and honey for lunch and then we were off again.
Lots of signs of ice damage in the trees as we made our way down to Pearisburg.  Once down, we had a bit of road walking until I got to my departure point.  Geo and I traded phone numbers and he continued on to meet his wife in two days time.  I called the hostel for a pickup and my day was done at 4 pm.  If I had been alone, I wouldn't have gotten to Pearisburg until at least 6 pm or later.  Thanks Geo.
The hostel was run by a chiropractor.   She offered adjustments and acupuncture.   The place had a nice 3 place shower facility with washer/dryer in a lower level.  There was also a mobile home that served as a common area with kitchen. I was able to set my hammock up so it only cost me $12 for the first night (with laundry) and $9 the second night.  I zeroed because I needed to prepare a report for the MATC meeting on the 10th.  Also gave me a chance for a nap.
Resupplied at Walmart and got my sweet tea and shake at McDonald's.  The lobby at McDonald's was closed which was becoming very common and annoying.  I simply use the app and order curbside delivery.  I stand in the curbside space and they bring the food out to me. More than one way to skin a cat.

It took me about 3 hours to complete so I still had a bunch of free time on my hands.
I started the day with a visit to Hardee's for breakfast and then I walked to Dollar General to see if they had Spam singles. The downtown was small but cute and had more open shops than closed storefronts.  The DG didn't have what I wanted but the grocery store next door did so it was a successful trip.
Note that I had to walk to get what I wanted.  This is common for most town trips. You are generally at the mercy of the hostel to provide transportation and it usually costs money and time as you wait for a shuttle.  Most hostels are very accommodating and may not charge for every trip but you still spend a fair amount of time waiting. 
I returned to the hostel and completed my report.  As a reward, I walked over to the DQ for a Blizzard and a sweet tea.
Angus had arrived while I was doing my report and we reconnected.  We made plans to have supper together which meant another meal at the Mexican restaurant.  It was a good meal because of the company and we didn't sit in the noisy bar.

Got a late start as we had to wait for the shuttle to return from an earlier trip.  While waiting, I consumed the entire box of honey buns with a cup of coffee. That amounted about 1300 calories.  One of the young guys consumed an entire box of chocolate covered donut holes to the tune of 2300 calories.   That's carb loading at its best.
Shuttle arrived and off Angus and I went to the trailhead.  It was a tough climb up with a fully resupplied pack.  At least I got a good nights sleep in my hammock so I wasn't tired too.
I left Angus behind as his hiking speed was slower than mine.  This is common as we all hike our own hike.  The day was a perfect hiking day, not too hot or humid with a light wind.  The three young people from the hostel, Gazelle, Speed Stick and Bug zoomed by me with no problems.  They were trying for a 42 mile day! I was happy with half that.
Got up to about 3600 feet and ran the ridge for awhile. The trail eventually went down to around 2500 feet and started to follow Dismal Creek.  I found the unofficial campsite which happened to be near a dirt road.  Got all set up and was making dinner (boiling water) and heard voices.  Seems the road is popular with the horse crowd.   Saw at least 6 or more riders saunter by.

Also got to use a real toilet and cleaned up a bit.  The locals were having coffee so I had to listen to ""When I visited Maine"" stories for awhile.  Eventually made the 0.6 mile trip back to the trail which by the way is not included in today's mileage.
Crossed a nice suspension bridge to find the trail went up as expected. Went down a couple of times to road crossings but eventually stayed up until reaching the turn to the shelter.   I had to do another 0.25 miles to the shelter and then even further to the water source.  Water sources are always down low so it's a climb back to the shelter and my hammock.  No one around so I had the place to myself.","Campsite @ mile 616

I got a couple of ice cream sandwiches and two drinks while I talked with the owner.  She said that she has had 3 times the number of thru hikers this year vs. last year.  That amounted to over 1500 hikers this year!  I also asked about resupply as I moved forward.  She gave me a number of a person who shuttles hikers into a nearby town so I was prepared.

Water Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645168,"I stopped where I did the previous evening because the next three shelters were closed because of bear activity. I would have had to hike another 21 miles to get beyond that area and it wasn't going to happen.  I can do 21 miles in a day but not 31 miles.I was following a ridge at about 3,500 feet but like all ridges, it eventually made it down to a gap, in this case Low Gap.  Low Gap had a picnic table so I decided it was time for lunch.  It also had a nice flowing piped spring so I filled up on water at the same time.  I texted Geo with this information but didn't expect him to catch up as he was with a friend who was slowing him down.  Then it was back up and then back down but not before I had to traverse two pastures.  Wet feet again!Once back up on the final ridge for the day, it was just a boring walk.  The trail was in excellent shape but it was a walk in the woods with no views.I passed Iron Mountain Shelter but decided to get a few more miles out of the day and continued on to the campsite.  To be clear, campsites are unofficial spots that people have used in the past.  They usually are well defined and have a fire ring made of stones.  There is no privy but then Tennessee doesn't have privies anyway so I didn't miss out by not staying at a shelter.Not sure why Tennessee doesn't have privies.  I asked a lot of people but no one could give me an answer.  Actually the privy that Tennessee does have is a shovel.  Each shelter features a shovel that can be used to did a cat hole.  I want to ask our campsite manager why we are spending $10,000 per privy when we could just go to Walmart and buy a $25 shovel like Tennessee.Found my campsite and set up for the night.  No one around so it was alone time for me.  I decided not to set up my tarp as the nighttime weather was supposed to be good.  Still can't see any stars as I'm under a fairly heavy tree cover.  But I felt good as I wouldn't have to deal with the tarp in the morning.","Stealth Site @ 456.6 miles

Water Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645170,"The day would bring me by the Watauga River which had been dammed by the TVA for electric power.  Ridge walked until I got close to the dam and then dropped down over 1,000 feet to the dam.  The impoundment area is huge and is used for recreational purposes.  I traversed most of one side of the reservoir and ended up at the picnic/swimming area.  The rest room was closed but the water faucet worked on the exterior of the building.  I found a nice and level picnic table and had lunch and filled up on water.  It was a beautiful day and I had the place to myself as the gates were closed and locked.
I passed a hiker who had come from the other direction and he indicated that I would have a tough climb up Pond Mtn.  It was about a 2,000 foot climb up to the top.  I took that as a challenge and headed out after lunch.  It was a good climb but with the switchbacks, it wasn't much of a challenge.  Its funny when you think about other peoples perception of the trail.  The novices all think that the trail is so hard.  After all the miles I've traveled, the trail would have to be really hard for me to find it a challenge.  Having trail legs helped.The trail then took me back down to Laurel Fork where I walked along a waterway that featured a large waterfall and a gorge.  It also featured 525 steps that took you out of the falls area up to the gorge.  They left that out of the trail description.  Met a few people out for the day to view the falls.  I had a destination in mind and wanted to get there by 4 pm.  The climb out of the falls area was strenuous.  Rock stairs are very ununiform and it takes a bit of stamina to maneuver up them.  You are either stepping up a few inches or up as many as 24 inches with every measurement in between.
Made it down to the main road to the hostel to find the hikers I had met earlier.  This was a family of four from Oregon who were hiking the trail too.  But they had a van that they would preposition so that they would either hike to the van or hike from the van and then get picked up by a shuttle driver.  This was the second time I met up with them.  Nice group of folks.  Everytime they meet me with the van, I get a free drink!
Had to hike 0.6 mile to the hostel and ended up there at 4:05 pm.  I checked in, bought a couple of beers and found a place to set up my hammock.  I liked to stay in places that allowed me to hammock as it ensured that I would get a good night's sleep.
l got my clothes together, found some loner clothes to wear and set to do my laundry and then take a shower.  Once that was done, I felt a lot better and was then shuttled into town for a meal at McDonald's and resupply at Dollar General.  I couldn't get bagels for my lunch so instead I purchased hamburger buns.  I managed to get most everything else as the hostel had dehydrated meals for sale.
Picked up some ice cream and something for dinner and we headed back to the hostel.
My plan was to head out early the next morning so I organized everything for a quick departure and prepared for bed.  While doing that, another hiker arrived.  This was Bare Paw.  Gazelle and Speed Stick were also at the hostel.  I had met them in Pearisburg, VA.  
It was a quiet night and I managed to get into bed relatively early for a change.  Everyone seemed to want to stay to themselves so there wasn't much interaction.

Water Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645171,"Got an early start under headlamp today.  Bear Paw was stirring but no one else was awake.  Made a nice gradual climb from 2,500 feet to almost 4,000 feet in about 2.5 miles.  The trail then dropped down a bit and my elevation bumped between 3,200 feet and 3,800 feet.  Ups and downs as usual.  Made it to the Moreland Gap Shelter and had lunch.  I heard some other people but they didn't come to the shelter so I ate alone.Bare Paw eventually caught up with me and we hiked together for a while.  He was much younger and a former Marine so his speed was faster than mine.  I told him to carry on and we may get together again.  We agreed to try to meet at a Bar/Grill/Hostel called Station 19E located about a mile off trail on Virginia Route 19E.The trail eventually dropped from the 3,500 feet or so elevation to about 2,800 feet when it reached Route 19E.  Since it was only about 5 pm, I decided to trek up to Station 19E and see if Bare Paw stopped there.  I walk at a speed of about 2 mph so it took me about 30 minutes to get to the restaurant.  Bare Paw was at the bar just finishing up his meal.  I ordered a meal and beer (1st one free for thru hikers) and ended up having a meal, dessert and three beers.  We enjoyed the company of the bartender as he liked thru hikers and spent as much time with us as the other customers would allow.While in the restaurant, a domestic turkey tried attacking my pack which I left outside.  The bartender was nice enough to bring it into the bar for me.We finished about sundown and headed back down the road to the trailhead under headlamps.  We then proceeded about a mile down the trail to a campsite recommended by the bartender.  It was big enough for both of us, had a nice level space for Bare Paw's tent and trees for my hammock and it had water.  We set up in the dark with headlamps which wasn't a problem as by now I could set up with my eyes closed.Since we didn't need to fix supper, I had enough water to last me till morning.  We got in our respective sleep systems and went to bed.","Black Bear Hostel @ 420.1 miles

Water Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645172,"I got up earlier than Bare Paw and headed out on the trail under headlamp.  Found a good water source not far away and filtered some water to fill all of my containers.  As I may have mentioned, I carry 2 full liters of water in side pockets of my pack and a 3/4 liter bottle in a holder on my left shoulder strap.  I try not to drink unless I can immediately refill.  I've noticed that most other folks carry at least one liter less.  There are two things Thru Hikers are always looking for; a water source and electricity.  I did a hike a couple of years ago during a very dry period and spent most of the time worrying about not having water.  I didn't like the feeling and that's why I carry so much water.  The three containers account for 6 lbs. of my total pack weight.  There are times when I will partially or completely fill my water bladder as well and carry that to a campsite that doesn't have a water source.  Fully loaded, the 3 liter bladder adds another 6.5 lbs. of weight.  Excessive?  Maybe but the extra 3 liters ensures that I will have full containers when I start out in the morning.  It also ensures that I can properly hydrate myself in the evening.  During the really hot periods, I can drink 1.5 liters or more over night.  I found that I was dehydrated to some degree every day of the hike.  I found a good way to control my urge to drink during the day.  Since I'm a mouth breather, my mouth and throat becomes very dry.  I've found that sucking on a piece of hard candy like Jolly Ranchers mitigates the dryness and lets me go longer without having to drink.  During the evening however, I tend to be very thirsty and will consume as much water as I can spare.  If the water source is close to the campsite, I'll visit it a couple of times to replenish my supply.  If on the other hand, it's a long distance down, then I'll try to fill up everything at least once and then refill on the trail the next day.  As I have mentioned, my selection of a campsite is mostly dependent upon a local water source being available.  That's why it appears that I didn't do as many miles on a day where water was scarce and the location of the available source didn't lend itself to long miles.Bare Paw was going to end his hike in Erwin, TN.  He skipped this section and had returned to finish up his hike.  Since he lived in Nashville, his sister was going to drive down to Erwin to pick him up.  Consequently, he was anxious to get the hike done as we would be one day out of Erwin after today.  The day started out at about 3,000 feet of elevation but that quickly changed to about 4,500 feet in 1.5 miles.  It continued on through some pasture land (wet feet time) to Hump Mountain at 5,500 feet.  Keep in mind that Katahdin is only 5,267 feet tall.  Then it was down and then back up to Little Hump Mtn. at 5,400 feet.  Then it was contour walking for a while.  Just to give you a picture of contour walking if I haven't already, the trail itself can be anywhere from 8 inches to a couple of feet wide.  On one side of the trail, the land goes up at a steep angle while on the other side, the land goes down at the same angle.  So there is no place to camp although I could find two trees to hang a hammock.  I resisted that urge because the slope was so steep and if you got out of the hammock without realizing where you were, you could find yourself several hundred feet down slope.Got to Carver's Gap to find a nice parking lot with a toilet!!  Always nice to be able to sit down to do your business.  I keep reminding people that I'm not a bear in the woods nor do I want to act like one.Out of Carver's Gap, I had to climb up to Roan Mountain and Roan High Knob at 6,270 feet.  Not much of a view as the peak was forested.  Went by an old hotel site where the only artifact left is a fireplace and chimney.  Of course once you reach a high point, you can expect to drop down in elevation to another gap, so it was down a series of switchbacks to Ash Gap at 5,300 feet.  Fortunately, I didn't have another climb out of Ash Gap.  For some reason, they kept the trail on a downslope to Hughes Gap which is at 4,000 feet.The remainder of the day wasn't all that strenuous and I finally made it to the Clyde Smith Shelter by 6 pm.  I was surprised that Bare Paw didn't catch up with me during the day.  This shelter was in Tennessee since it didn't have a privy although it did have a shovel.  I set up behind the shelter and eventually, Bare Paw arrived.  I felt good doing a 24 mile day on my own.We ate dinner and then sacked out as Bare Paw wanted to finish his hike tomorrow which would require a 26 mile day.","Apple House Campsite @ 394.8 miles

Water Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645189,"We got up early as today was going to be a long hike day.  I was apprehensive as I've only done one 25 mile day although I had done several 24 milers.  I found that I could easily do 20 miles, usually by 4 pm.  That would give me 2.5 hours more of hiking as I usually stop at 6:30 pm.  I can do at least 5 miles in 2.5 hours so theoretically, I can do a 25 mile day with no problem.  The only problem is my body tends to shut down a bit after 22 miles or so.  I'm sure it's all in my head but at 22 miles, the body is thinking about laying in my hammock.In any event, we started off and surprisingly stayed together.  Bare Paw, named for his really minimalistic shoes, was complaining about his feet hurting.  I'm not surprised as the trail turned out to be very rocky and he had little protection against rocks.  We had a couple of minor climbs but it would be mostly downhill to an elevation under 2,000 feet.  We were able to chat a bit during the day but often, I would lag behind far enough to make normal talking difficult.  I can see now how I can hear people coming from quite a distance as they tend to talk much louder than normal to be heard by the person in front of them.Once we began to descend, we got closer to a stream bed which meant Rhododendrons again.  Really not a big fan of then now.  The trail got rockier but kept going down.  We eventually made it to the Nolichucky River where a hostel/rafting company was located.  We bypassed that hostel and continued down the trail to Erwin TN.  Our hostel was located on the trail so we knew we wouldn't miss it nor would be need a shuttle ride.Of course since this was Bare Paws last day on the trail, the last mile was a challenge going up and over a lot of rocks.  It was appropriate because my days always seemed to end with a climb up.  We finally made it to the bridge crossing the river and there was Uncle Johnnies.  I'm not sure how I made the 26 miles today but I felt good about the accomplishment.  Not sure I'd be able to do that again.Uncle Johnnie is no longer with us but his wife is keeping the hostel open.  It was a fairly rough place but it had dehydrated meals in the outfitter store and hot showers and laundry.  I signed up for a bunk in the bunkhouse although I could have gotten a private room with A/C.  I didn't realize that they had a great covered area for hammockers.   Bare Paw and I agreed that showers were first and food was second on the list.  We cleaned up and I put on a clean shirt and clean socks that I carry with me.  Still had to put on my dirty pants as laundry would come after food.  The hostel had bikes that we could use to get to the closest sit down restaurant which was about a mile away.  We remembered to bring headlamps as we would be returning in the dark.Of course, the restaurant was Mexican but we were able to get beer and a good meal.  Surprisingly, they were out of tequila so Margaritas were out.  I bought Bare Paws dinner to celebrate his accomplishment.  I felt bad that there was no one there he knew to help him celebrate finishing the AT.We hit the attached convenience store for more beer (Bare Paw) and ice cream (me) and headed back.  I'm happy to report that I didn't kill myself on the bike.I set up in the bunkhouse but found that I couldn't get to sleep on the mattress.  It was also hot in the bunkhouse as it was not air conditioned.  I had found out about the hammock shed and decided to as quietly as I could, move my stuff outside and set up in the shed.  Once I was in my hammock, I fell quickly to sleep and life was good.  I wish more places had hammock sheds like Uncle Johnnies.","Clyde Smith Shelter

Water Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645193,"The day started out nice but I also had to do an 1,100 foot climb in about a mile to High Rocks.  It was aptly named as there were rocks at the top.  That got me to 4,300 feet but I dropped down again about 500 feet before climbing up Little Bald at 5,100 feet.  I pretty much stayed on a ridge going up and down slightly until I reached Big Bald at 5,500 feet.  Water was becoming plentiful on the trail so I was happy and drinking my fill whenever possible.
Not much to report about the trail as it was typical for the area.  Tree covered with patches of Rhodo's.  Not much to see.  I made it to Sam's Gap where I crossed under I-26.  There was a bit of a climb up to the next peak and then it was ridge walking with it's ups and downs.  Again the trail was pretty boring as it was tree covered with no views.
My destination was just before Devil Fork Gap which was a moderately busy road.  I set up 0.1 mile from the road crossing.  There had been a water source about 0.6 miles before my evening home so I had to carry a bit of water that distance.  My App recommended that I not use the water source at the gap as it was close to pastures, e.g. cows!
There was a hostel on the road just before Devils Fork Gap so I walked down to get some water.  The hostel turned out to be a big disappointment.  There was nothing to buy and the guy who came out to see what I wanted didn't seem to be all that interested in having me for a guest.  I got my water but forgot my trekking poles.
I made my way to Devils' Fork Gap which required a nice climb out of the previous gap.  It wasn't bad because of the switchbacks.  I found a couple of trees in an area I thought was far from any homes in the area.  While setting up, I realized I had left my trekking poles at the hostel so I left everything in place and walked back to the hostel to retrieve my poles which were right where I left them.  This added another 1.2 miles to my day.
Finally got all set up and had dinner.  Once it got dark I realized by the floodlight on a power pole that I was pretty close to a house.  Not knowing if the land was privately owned, I tried to minimize my use of a light and stayed as stealthy as possible.  It worked as no one came by to see the source of the light.

The day started out overcast and by afternoon, rain had started.  I knew that I'd get wet feet but I resisted putting on my rain gear as long as possible since I was already we with sweat and I just didn't want to get chilled by the rain.  I eventually succumbed to the weather and put on my coat and rain kilt.  I try to keep my pants as dry as possible because I don't have another pair to wear.  I do have another shirt so I can get put on a dry shirt tomorrow so that's not a big deal.
If you look at the trail, I was moving southwest but it turned due south and then west and now I'm heading north.  That's the way the trail is laid out.  Even though Springer is southwest of Katahdin, you often are heading in the opposite direction for some distance.  It's usually to get you to another prominent peak or view point.
I get amused by the names given to some of these peaks.  I'll be traversing Big Butt at 4,800 feet.  There have been other creative names as well.  I'd like to know the difference between a mountain and a knob.  I didn't see the distinction as they both require a climb.
I finally made it to Allen Gap.  I decided to move across the road 0.3 of a mile to a stealth site near a water source.  The recent rains made this intermittent source into a good water source today.  Of course, the 0.3 of a mile required a climb of about 500 feet in elevation which was pretty common for me.
Set up and had dinner.  It continued to rain and rained all night.  Hopefully the trail isn't saturated and will absorb the extra moisture.  I'm sure that there will be muddy spots but that's par for the course.
I was dry and warm so the rain wasn't an issue.  I'm glad I went with a hammock/tarp setup as I haven't spent one day where I haven't been dry and warm in my hammock while I've heard horror stories from people with leaking tents or tents set up in areas where they get flooded.

Lots of ridge walking today with a few ups and downs.  Stayed around 3,500 feet most of the time.  It was a short day as I got into Hot Springs early in the afternoon.  You run a ridge until you almost get to hot springs.  You then drop down a fairly rocky trail to the river below.  You are only about 700 feet above the river on the ridge but it provides some good views.  These views attracted a lot of people who smiled but didn't really interact with me.  I think that they may have been a bit intimidated by me with my scraggly beard and smelly clothes.
Crossed the bridge into Hot Springs.  I was stopped twice by people asking either for directions or the location of the AT.  The guy asking about the location of the AT was startled when I told him I was standing on it.  Guess he thought it was entirely in the woods.
Hot Springs still has the Hot Springs resort which was the center piece for the town.  The town is tiny but does have a couple of good restaurants, a brewery and a diner where I got lunch.  It also had an outfitter for my dehydrated meals.  The only grocery store was the Dollar General which was located in a building that looked like a warehouse.  Not your typical DG.
The AT went right by the hostel but you first had to go up a relatively steep slope to the upper street where the hostel was located.  This was a nice hostel with all the amenities required by hikers.  I was able to set up my hammock so I was ensured of a good nights sleep.  I showered and did laundry and then headed back into town for my resupply and a visit to the brewery.  Guess what?  The Brewery had a Taqueria attached for food.  Another Mexican restaurant.  The pattern continues.
After the Brewery, I hit up the DG and got my supplies.  I couldn't find bagels so I ended up getting sleeves of Ritz Crackers instead.  I figured an entire sleeve of crackers would be equivalent to a bagel and they didn't take up that much room.
The family in a van showed up and we talked for a while.  There were also two older gentlemen who had been friends since the army in the 60's.  They were both about 74 yrs old and hiked only short distances between hostels.  They would get together once or twice a year to hike.  Once retired, they stopped cutting their hair so both had pony tails.  Of course, earing's were included.  They were fun to talk with and I enjoyed their company.

Water Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645198,"The day started out in the clouds and foggy.  At least it wasn't raining.  Got into my wet clothing and slogged on down the trail under headlamp.  Since I was at elevation, the trail actually started down a bit.  I need to elaborate a bit here.  When the trail goes down it also goes up a bit here and there so it's often a mixed bag.  Found a couple of good water sources and filled up for the day.  Ran along contours for some time at about 3.500 feet.  Lots of little water sources but many were too shallow to fill a bottle.  My original destination yesterday was the road crossing after Max Patch.  Wasn't sure what Max Patch was but it turned out to be a very large field or bald on Max Patch Mountain at 4,600 feet.  As I approached a road crossing, I met the family of four again (van people) and we talked a bit about trail conditions.When I got to Max Patch, I found the trail to be well used and wide so no wet feet or wetter feet as my feet were already wet.  There is no camping on Max Patch which suited me fine as there were few trees.  As I made my way to the summit which was an easy climb, I found that there was a very large group of trail maintainers working just off the summit.  I also found that they drove right up to their worksite.  I'd love to have that ability on my trail as I have to walk about 2 miles just to get to my section of trail.  I talked with the maintainers for some time and commented on their ability to drive to their worksite.  They were installing split rail fencing to keep people from making their own trails down to the road.I continued on to find a second group of maintainers working on the steps on the backside of the mountain.  They too drove right to their worksite. I spoke with them for some time and got to meet their trail manager (they have only 1 while Maine has 5).  They all seemed to want to come to Maine to experience the trail in a more remote location.  I invited them up anytime and explained how to get in touch with me through the MATC website.It was off to the road crossing where I had planned to stop the night before.  I'm glad I stopped early as I would not have been able to make the road crossing in the condition I was in yesterday.  Decided to have lunch and while eating, saw the van peoples van drive by.  Not sure who was driving but they were evidently repositioning.  I hoped to see them again as we both were expecting to finish at Springer on Oct 5th.I wanted to try to make up my loss of mileage yesterday so I didn't waste a lot of time at lunch and got back on the trail.  The trail was in reasonably good condition so I was making good time.   Some ridge walking but a lot of contour walking again.Made it to the road leading to Standing Bear Hostel.  It was getting late in the day but I didn't want to stop just yet.  I was approaching the Smokies and knew that resupply on the southern end was not possible (store closed) but really didn't want to stop in Gatlinburg either.  I probably should have stopped at the hostel to bring my supplies up to my normal 5 day supply but I didn't.The trail crossed I-40 and then the Pigeon RIver.  I continued just a short distance to a really nice stealth site next to a stream.  I set my hammock up next to the stream with the back of my hammock/tarp to the interstate.  The sound from the stream was enough to cover the noise from the highway and I had a great nights sleep.","Phil's Gap @ 263.9 Miles

Water Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645235,"Got another early start under headlamp.  Made it the short distance to Davenport Gap where I could walk to the General Store.  I finally got cell service and looked up the General Store to find that they were closed.  They were also 1 mile off the trail so that would have added 2 needless miles to my day.  With no alternative, I headed down the trail.
Davenport Gap is also the northern entrance to the Great Smoky Mountain National Park.  The only indication is a box where northbounders were requested to deposit their permit.  Thru hikers needed a permit to traverse the Smokies and the permit cost $20.  This is the only permit for the trail that costs money.  I had secured a permit but I didn't have a print copy.  I would have to figure out what to say if someone wanted to see my permit.  
I knew that the Smoky Mountains represented some high elevations.  I'll be passing by Clingman's Dome in the Smokies, which is the highest point on the AT.  I'll also be camping at high elevations and the weather can get very cold.  I had sent my base layers (bottom and top) and my wool cap home so I hoped that my equipment was sufficient to keep me warm.
Lots of contour walking starting out at a lower elevation than normal.  I was still near 3,000 feet but I had been much higher.  Of course a climb was in my future and I eventually made it up to about 5,000 feet onto a ridge.  No views because of the trees but it was nice walking.
Passed another shelter closed because of Bear Activity.  I stopped for a snack and water as it had a nice piped spring.  I had descended to 4,200 feet at Low Gap but now was climbing again to above 5,000 feet to Inadu Knob at 5,800 feet.
I've been on a section of trail that straddles the border between Tennessee and North Carolina.  The shelters generally will give an indication as to the state you are currently in.  If the shelter has a privy, you are in North Carolina.  If not, then you are in Tennessee.
The trail skirted around My Guyot at 6,600 feet.  Glad I didn't have to climb that.  I was contour walking and the slope was steep.  I stayed at this elevation (+- 400 feet) for some time.  Even though I was higher than both Katahdin and Mt. Washington, there were no views as the summits and ridges were covered with trees.  You would get a view here and there but they weren't 360 degree views that I loved in Maine and New Hampshire.
Finally made it to Peck's Corner Shelter.  The water source was right on the trail but the shelter/campsite was 0.4 miles off trail.  This was further than I would have liked but it was getting dark and I needed to stop.  The Shelter is at 5,282 feet which is 15 feet higher than the summit of Katahdin.  Still no views but I did have a good evening.
Weather was good with no rain.","Stealth Site @ 240 miles

Water Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645236,"While in the Smokies, you are required to stay in designated campsites.  These will have privies and water sources so it made sense to try to hit a shelter every night.  In addition, you are required to stay in the shelters unless the shelter is full.  Short term hikers have preference in the shelters as they have to reserve those spaces.  I didn't want to stay in a shelter and wasn't planning to.  I did find out that the NPS suspended that rule during Covid so I was ok with my hammock.
Because everyone was required to stay at a shelter, I finally had company at Mt Collins.  Everyone else was a weekend hiker so everyone was interested in my thru hike.   Lots of questions.
I would find that I would be at elevations around 5,000 feet or higher while in the Smokies.  Not far down the trail from Peck's Corner was a prominent feature called Charlies Bunion.  It was only 4.4 miles from the trailhead so it was a very popular trail.  I probably counted over 100 people coming up the trail.  Many were not adequately prepared and didn't even have water with them.  I don't understand these folks.  I won't walk in our nature area without carrying water.
The trailhead was in Newfound Gap which is at about 5,000 feet.  There were trash cans and bathrooms but no water.  I had arranged for a shuttle ride the previous day and got to the trailhead about 30 minutes before pickup.  My shuttle driver (Pack Rat) arrived on time and off we went into Gatlinburg, TN.  The park borders the town so its either woods or very abruptly a town dedicated to tourists.  The traffic was horrendous as there really is only one road in/out of Gatlinburg.  Lots of tourist traps.
My shuttle driver stopped at the Nantahala Outdoor Center for my dehydrated meals.  I then needed to go to a grocery store which unfortunately was on the opposite side of town.  My driver knew a couple of bypasses and we managed to get by most of the traffic.  I resupplies at the grocery store and then he agreed to bring me to McDonald's for lunch.  Of course the McDonald's ice cream machine was down (which is a fairly common thing) so no milkshakes.  I did get my sweet tea and something to eat and off we went back to Newfound Gap.  I hadn't planned to stay in town overnight and I wanted to get a few more miles in before dark.
It was 15 miles from the Gap to Gatlinburg so 15 miles back.  30 miles plus the 3 stops cost be $40 which I thought was a good deal.  I gave him $50 and he said he was going to use the extra for trail magic.
I got back on the trail and away from all of the crowds.  Turns out that the Smoky Mtn NP is one of the most visited parks in the US.  It certainly was busy today.
I managed to squeak out a 15 mile day even though I took 3 hours to do my resupply.  Pretty proud of myself.  I finally got to Mt Collins Shelter which is at 5,800 feet of elevation and at mile 202 on the trail.  Tomorrow I will break the 200 mile mark.
A very nice day with lots of sun.  No one was at the Mt Collins shelter so I had the place to myself which I didn't expect.","Peck's Corner Shelter

Water Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645262,"It was only two miles to Clingmans Dome so I got there earlier than I would have liked as the fog hadn't burned off yet so my view was zero.  Clingmans Dome is the highest point on the AT at 6,611 feet.  It's fully tree covered so there is a nice space ship like viewing platform that takes you above the trees.  I'm sure the view is spectacular but all I could see was fog.  It started to clear as I left and I got a good shot of the viewing platform with blue skies above but the view of the rest of the world was still obstructed.
I continued on instead with the hope that my shuttle driver was correct.  He told me that is was basically all downhill from Clingmans (with a couple of bumps).  I'll be the judge of how downhill the walk would turn out to be.
The trail did drop down quickly in elevation.  In just a few miles, I was almost 2,000 feet lower.  But there were still ups and downs in the way so it wasn't as easy as I had expected.  Went through a lot of open field areas but the views were minimal.  I noticed a lot of horse trails intersecting the AT.  Horses aren't generally allowed on the AT although there were several occasions where the two trails combined as one.  ATV's are also not allowed on the trail but I did find a couple of spots where ATVs and the AT shared the same trail.
The trail eventually dropped down to about 4,400 feet but I had a couple of bumps to cross once the trail started back up.  These bumps were Thunderhead Mtn. @ 5,500 feet and Rocky Top Mtn. @ 5,400 feet.  Not sure if this is the famed Rocky Top that country singers sing about but it was still in the way.  The climb up Thunderhead was as strenuous and challenging as those in New England but my trail legs got me  up and over.  I had met a couple of weekenders who characterized Rocky Top as more of a technical climb and was very difficult.  I found the transition from Thunderhead to Rocky Top to be relatively easy and wondered if I was on the correct trail.  I found that newby hikers seemed to inflate the severity of a climb or hike.  Of course they didn't have trail legs and hadn't been hiking for more than 120 days in a row.
Went buy Spence Field Shelter which was actually next to a field which I assumed was named Spence.  It was much too early to stop so I continued on to what I thought would be another field.  
Made it to Russell Field Shelter with no problems but didn't find a field.  There was a tie up for horses so a horse trail was nearby.  I found myself alone at this site so I set up behind the shelter and found the water source.  It also had bear cables which are used to raise your food above the average bear.  I decided to not set up my tarp and spent the early part of the night trying to see the stars through the trees.
I did hear coyotes howling in the distance.  I wasn't too concerned and fell fast asleep.  It was another nice day with more to come according to our highly accurate meteorologists.","Mt. Collins Shelter

Water Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645264,"My destination today was past Fontana Dam.  This is an important benchmark for Northbounders as it's the home of the Hilton Shelter.  I believe the shelter was constructed by the TVA and includes a real bathroom (flush toilets and toilet paper!) and a hot shower.  I was hoping that it was open as many of the other higher end amenities had been closed.
Not sure what I would find but I started out at my normal 6:30 am under headlamp and proceeded down the trail.  Fair number of Gaps which meant an immediate climb out.  The climbs weren't too bad and I made good time along the ridge.  
More small ups and downs followed and I needed some water because it had been a hot day and I was sweating a lot.  I stopped by Ekaneetlee Gap Spring and found a good flow so I drank my fill and filled up before proceeding on.  If I came across a spring that was sprouting from the ground or side wall of the trail and I couldn't see any portion of it exposed, I would drink straight from the spring without filtering.  On the other hand, if the water from the spring was collected a distance from the origin so that the water was exposed, then I would filter the water before consumption.  It worked for me but I still advised everyone to filter all water on the trail.  Just do what I say and not what I do.
Had only about a 600 foot rise to the next ridge and then ridge walked for some time.  No views to speak of so it was somewhat boring.  Made it to the trail to the Shuckstack Fire Tower.  Wasn't interested in seeing another fire tower so I proceeded on to Fontana.  I was more interested in real food.
Made it down to the trailhead to find the end of the Smokies as indicated by the box where you were to deposit your permit.  Since I didn't have a paper copy of my permit, I ripped a page out of a small notebook I carried and wrote that I had lost my permit but here are the pertinent details from the online copy.  Based upon how full the box was, I don't think it made a lick of difference.  They just wanted their $20 bucks.  It had taken me 4 days to traverse the Smokies even with my 3 hour resupply trip to Gatlinburg.  I was pleased with my progress and the trail was cooperating.
Met a nice couple on the dam who were very interested in my hike.  The observation deck was closed so they were looking for hiking opportunities.  I directed them up the trail to the AT but they were interested in shorter but more scenic trails.
Passes a group of 5 women who had been out for a few days.  Their hike was ending at the dam.  They seemed somewhat impressed by my hike but we were all in a hurry so the conversation was short.
I got to the bathroom to find it open.  All other water spigots had been shut off but I found one operable at the bathroom.  Time to fill up again.  The shower was hot but I didn't plan to stop for one and moved on.  I made it to the marina on Fontana Reservoir to find it open.  I had heard that it was closed.  The day was beautiful as it had warmed to the 80's after a few cold days and was nice and sunny so a fair number of people were out on the lake.
The marina didn't have freshly prepared food and much of their inventory was depleted since it was coming to the end of their season but I was able to get two premade sandwiches, some chips, a drink and a beer.  Also bought a few more candy bars and other snacks.  Didn't have any ice cream but I did get a fudgesicle instead.  They had a nice place to sit outside so I enjoyed my lunch while I watched all the boaters float around.
The trail from the marina back to the AT wasn't very well marked and there was an extra road that wasn't on my App so I wasted about 30 minutes walking back and forth trying to find the trail.  I eventually found it and also found a maintainer working on a set of steps.  We talked for a while and traded trail stories.  
The trail was in good condition and the climbs were shorter than those in the Smokies so I made good time.  Spent most of the day in the low 3,000 foot of elevation.  Made it to Cody Gap which was an unofficial campsite.  There was a water source there so I had pretty much everything I needed.  A privy would have been nice though.
I was alone again and like the previous night, did not hang my tarp.  The weather was great and was hotter than I would have expected.

Did get one view of the area but like most views it was only about a 90 degree opening.The N.O.C. offers bunkhouses for hikers and high end cottages for the less mobile and richer city folk.  It straddles the Nantahala RIver and offers rafting and kayaking trips.  The place was virtually deserted.  There was a wilderness EMT course being taught there so I was able to talk with a couple of the students, one of which had already done the AT.I didn't make it in time to get new shoes at the outfitters but I did get a nice burger, fries and a beer at the bar and grill.  I was also able to tank up on supplies at the grocery.  I did my laundry (sitting in my raingear while doing so), showered and got set up in the bunkhouse.  My room held two people but I had it to myself.  Like all beds, I didn't get much sleep.  Not sure how I'm going to convince my wife to allow me to set my hammock up in our bedroom.","Cody Gap @ 156 Miles

I will finally be under 100 miles to go today.  This should happened in the early afternoon.  My destination is a Shelter at mile 93.5 so I'm excited about today.  Getting closer to Georgia with every step.
The trail from here actually goes east and then almost due south for quite a distance before turning again to the southwest where it needs to be.  There is even a turn to the north for a short distance before it turns south again.  Lots of zigs and zags, ups and downs and is fairly typical of the whole trail.
Crossed a lot of side trails and parking lots today as there are a lot of other trails in the area.  The number of folks on the trail is picking up a bit as the weekend is approaching.  Made it down to Wayah Gap and passed a decommissioned picnic area.  Took the opportunity to sit for a moment and have a snack.  I like to have good seating where my knees don't have to bend over 90 degrees.  Had a moderate climb  up to about 5,000 feet which was about a 900 foot rise.  The trail was still in good shape (few rocks, roots and obstructions) and I was making good time.  I was anxious to break the 100 mile mark as it represented another of my benchmarks.
The trail crosses a major road at Winding Stair Gap.  Didn't see any stairs but it was still a several hundred foot climb back out of the gap up to the side of a ridge where I did a bit of contour walking.
I would have to climb Albert Mtn. to break the 100 mile barrier.  I spoke with a couple of hikers who said that there would be a sign.  The climb wasn't too bad and represented about a 1,200 foot increase in elevation.  I missed the sign and got to the fire tower which Guthook says is at mile 99.7.  Did a little celebration alone and proceeded down and fairly steep and rocky section of trail.  Got to the bottom to find an old sign showing 101 miles.  The length of the trail can change each year as portions get relocated for one reason or another.  For instance, as I mentioned, there were two midpoint markers in Pennsylvania, both of which didn't represent this years midpoint.  Likewise, the 101 mile mark was old and outdated and needed to be changed.
Passed another interesting name that probably would pass the PC test.  After Bearpen Gap, you have to climb up to Big Butt Mountain.  Wasn't much of a climb and the trail actually seemed to be going down in elevation to the mid 3,000 foot range.
Now that I was below 100 miles, my next milestone would be the NC/GA state line at about 79 miles.  That would be easily reached tomorrow.
Made it to Carter Gap Shelter.  It was a very large area that could hold a lot of tents.  The trees however were not in the best locations and it took me a while to find a good spot to hang my hammock.  The area also had a good water source but did not have a bear cable or bear box.  I did find a tree from which to hang my food and I did so which was uncharacteristic of me.

The trail remained at the mid 4,000 foot elevation for a while and didn't drop below 4,000 feet until I reached GA. The trail allowed me to easily do 26 miles today and I was proud that I was able to do it on my own.  I also somewhat regretted the fast pace and long distance as that would mean that I would be finishing sooner than expected.  If I kept up this pace, I would be done on the 4th but my plane wouldn't take off until the 8th.  I wanted at least one day in Atlanta to get ready for the real world but didn't need two full days (or three nights) in a hotel.  I was please to find that United no longer charged the $200 change fee so I changed my flight to Thursday the 7th.  It did cost me a few more miles but I didn't care.  I also changed my hotel for an arrival on the 5th and departure on the 7th.  Now all I had to do was find a shuttle driver to take me from Springer Mtn. parking lot to either the airport or to the northern most MARTA station in Atlanta.I met up with Four Low, a flip flopper I had met in NH.  I was glad to finally see another southbounder and we set up in the unofficial camp site together.  The camp site was just after Dick's Creek Gap where we met a gentleman from a Christian motorcycle club handing out water and coffee in the parking lot.  Finally someone else to share a camp site. Since it was supposed to rain during the evening, I set up the tarp for rain and got settled into my hammock.  Four Low was also a hammocker so we both had to find trees from which to hang our hammocks.  In a forest, that didn't prove to be too difficult.","Carter Gap Shelter

The trail was very good but lots of ups and downs.  Four Low was an off road enthusiast who owned a jeep.  His name came from his off-roading.  The four meant four wheel drive and Low was Low Range.  I kidded him that he should change it to Four High because we were making very good time.
After a climb from about 2,600 feet to 3,800 feet, we were well on our way along a ridge.  Most of the shelters in this section were well off the trail so we ignored them and kept on the trail to eat snacks or lunch.  We weren't interested in adding unnecessary miles when we were this close to the finish line.
Kelly Knob brought us to 4,100 feet but no views were available and we wouldn't have seen anything anyway with the overcast conditions. Passed another Sassafras Gap. This had to the the third or fourth one I've passed in the last 100 miles.
Most of the hiking was done along a ridge at about the 4,000 foot elevation or less.  It was nice hiking and the rain wasn't bothering our progress.  Made it to Unicoi Gap which is where we crossed highway 17.  Many folks would get off here to go into Hiawassee for resupply.  We weren't interested.  I still needed more snacks to finish the hike but I would get those at Neel's Gap.
We had a 1,000 foot climb out of Unicoi Gap to Blue Mtn.  Nothing to see so we slugged on to the campsite in Poplar Spring Gap at 3,333 feet.  We found our trees and set up for the night.  It started to rain again but I was high and dry and enjoyed my hot meal.
It was only 44 miles to go so this would bring us to Springer on the 4th with no problems.
I had texted Subman, a shuttle driver listed in the AWOL guide but he was still on the trail.  I had met Subman in PA and hoped that he would be home to do my shuttle.  I then texted another shuttle driver and after several rounds of texts, he declined to provide the shuttle saying he was booked for the time I needed.  He recommended Survivor Dave and I texted him.  It took a bit for us to connect but he agreed to shuttle me from the parking lot to the northern most Marta Station.  I learned how to use Venmo as this was his preferred method of payment.  We agreed to a noon time pickup on Wednesday.","Tentsite @ 69.1 Miles

Water Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645302,"The rain would slow our progress today so we only made 20 miles.  We had agreed on the destination as Four Low was trying to make Springer on the 4th.  I could do fewer miles today and get close to finish early tomorrow morning.  There were two shelters, one at 2.4 miles and the other at 0.2 from Springer.  I could stay at the one 2.4 miles from Springer and make it up and back to the parking lot well before the noon time pickup.  Or I could finish on the 4th and hope for an earlier pickup.
We would reach Neel's Gap today which is where an outfitter is located right on the trail.  As a matter of fact, the trail goes between the main buildings.  Talk about a captive audience.
We would have to get over 5 mountains first.  Each was below 4,000 feet so the climbs weren't all that bad.  I was watching my footwear carefully to make sure that the sole didn't separate from the left shoe.  So far, so good.  I had to stop several times to fix my repair and Four Low was very patient with me.
Made it to Neel's Gap and got rid of my garbage.  This is the first outfitters that Northbounders would reach.  The outfitter would provide take a look at the gear being carried by each hiker and make recommendations on what they should ditch and what they were missing.  It's also the location that many folks quit the trail.  There is a tree into which the quitters would throw their shoes.  Not sure why someone attempting a 2,000+ mile trip would quit after only 31 miles.We went inside to find a lot of snacks and dehydrated meals but no freshly cooked food.  They did have frozen pizzas and microwavable hamburgers in a freezer so Four Low and I each picked out a pizza.  They did have a pizza oven so they cooked them for us which didn't take all that long.  I bought up a bunch of snacks to finish the trail and a couple of drinks.  I was disappointed that they didn't have ice cream but I survived.
We chatted with the manager while we ate our lunch.  We were on the front end of the southbound bubble (if one existed) so he was excited that we were there.  I looked at what I could buy for shoes and decided (hopefully without regret) to forego a purchase and to try to get another 31 miles out of my shoes. 
We had a good climb ahead of ourselves as Blood Mountain was in the way.  Blood Mtn. was reported to be a difficult climb by the northbounders but then it's early in their hike and they didn't have trail legs like we did.  Regardless of the rumors about the difficulty we headed up as the finish line was beckoning.  The weather stayed good until we got to within 100 feet of the Blood Mtn. Shelter which is just off the south side of the summit.  It started to pour so we were happy to have a place to get in out of the rain.  The shelter is a stone building with four walls and a door.  There is no water on the summit so it's not a great place to camp but it did have a privy.  We talked with a few folks in the shelter and once the rain abated a bit, we headed back out decked out in our rain gear.
We had 5 miles to go to our destination with a bunch of gaps in the way.  As I mentioned, these gaps represented a low spot between peaks so it was up and down again.  Made it to our destination to find a nice spot with bear cables and water but no privy.  We were able to find two trees each and set up for the night.  My spot was ok but sloped a bit so I had to take extra care to make sure my stuff didn't roll down the hill.
The rain continued on/off while we were setting up and getting set for the night.  Had a good hot meal and settled in to the pitter patter of rain on my tarp.","Poplar Stamp Gap Campsite @ 44.1 miles

Water Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645306,"Four Low was anxious to get started today so we headed out under headlamps in a slight rain.  Four Low had a time/location commitment and didn't want to miss his deadline.  He was meeting one of his Tramily (Trail Family) at the parking lot before Springer and the two of them were going to summit together.  We hiked for a while but I knew I couldn't or didn't want to keep up with him so we agreed that we would proceed on at our own paces and we said our goodbyes and he headed off quickly.I didn't have any plans to finish today.  My ride was at noon tomorrow and if I could get close, it would be an easy finish and I would still be able to meet my ride.  There were two shelters close to Springer, one at mile 2.4 and one at mile 0.2.  I could hold up at the one 2.4 miles from the summit and then sleep in a bit and still finish on time.  I walk at about 2 mph so it would take me just over 1 hour to get to the summit and then 30 minutes to get back to the parking lot which was 1 mile from the summit.  So I could sleep in as late as 9 am or so and then get on the trail at 10 am to summit at 11 am and have plenty of time to take pictures and be back at the parking lot by noon.I didn't really have many climbs during the morning and the trail actually started to go down as I approached the parking lot.  There was a nice series of cascades and since these were relatively close to a road crossing, I came across about 10 people or so in small groups either walking to the cascades or walking back to their cars.  No one appeared all that interested in the old scraggly guy with bad shoes.  I finally got to the 4.5 mile mark and it started to dawn on me that the end was in sight.It was fitting that a good portion of the last few miles was through rhododendrons.  They followed several stream beds and I had to cross over a pretty precarious one log bridge to get across one wide stream.  I thought at that moment that it would be ironic that I was able to walk over 2,000 miles but would hurt myself in the last few miles.  But I managed to get over the creek without doing so.I finally made it to the parking lot and the one mile sign.  It was at that moment that I fully realized that the end was very near.  I actually stopped at the parking lot and thought about it for a few minutes.  I then noticed that there were two people at an SUV in the parking lot.  One was Four Low and the other was Kindle, the person meeting him there.  I had also met Kindle on the trail some time ago so it was nice seeing her again.  We spoke for some time and since they had already summited Springer, I congratulated Four Low with a bro hug and handshake.  We don't normally do handshakes on the trail rather its a fist bump that is used.  This was common well before Covid and probably resulted from a fear of the norovirus.  They offered me a ride into town and food but it was still early and the sun had come out so I wanted to summit today.  Tomorrow would be rain and I'd rather not summit in the rain.  They told me the trail was rocky but easy with a gradual climb up to the summit.  I thanked them for their offered help and congratulated Four Low one more time and off I went to complete my hike south.I actually hesitated somewhat and climbed up much slower than normal.  Part of me didn't want it to end but I needed to get this done so I could go home to my family.  The trail was very rocky and wet in places but it was an easy trail.  As I approached the summit, I began to recognize an area of bare stone since I had seen many photos of the summit.  The Springer summit is wooded with only one small view point of about 20 degrees.  There was a view but by the time I got around to taking a picture of it, it was obscured by fog.  It was fitting that I was alone on the summit as I've been alone about 90% of the time.  I took a bunch of photos of the plaque and first blaze and of the general area.  I then sat for a while to savor the experience.  It wasn't an earth moving experience like some have reported but it was a job well done feeling that I also get when I finish any big job.With a smile and a wave, I headed back down, first stopping at the shelter at mile 0.2 to fill up on water.  I didn't need an extrea 3 liters above what I normally carry like I normally get as I would not need water tomorrow.  I just needed enough to cook my last trail dinner and to satisfy my thirst.  Two and 3/4 liters would suffice.I made my way back to the parking lot and set up in a good spot.  I had called my shuttle driver and asked if he could come at 10 am instead of noon and he agreed so I would be heading back to civilization tomorrow at 10 am.My nighfall, the parking lot was empty and I had a full stomach.  I left one of my most favorite meals for last, eating my beef stroganoff with gusto.  I also had a big old glazed honey bun for breakfast so I was all set.It started to rain again after a while and rained off and on all night long.  A fitting ending to my last night on the trail.","Lance Creek Restoration Area @ 23.9 miles

Water Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645308,"The day started off wet with rain off and on.  I got a text and phone message from my shuttle driver telling me that he may be 30 minutes late as it was raining a lot in the Atlanta area.  He actually called another shuttle driver nearby to see if he could pick me up.
I started to break down my camp at around 9:45 am but the shuttle driver did show up at 10 so he patiently waited for me while I packed up.  I had a trash bag with me which I filled with anything that I no longer wanted or couldn't take on the plane.  I also stripped everything off the outside of my pack and removed the contents of the outside pockets.  I put most of this into the pack, packaging it up in extra zip lock bags I happened to have with me.  I managed to get everything together and off we went.  I then sent my normal end of hike message to my family:  ""Off Trail, Heading Home"".  This signified the end of my southern hike.
The shuttle driver was planning on stopping in a nearby town so I could get something to eat.  I asked him and he agreed to take me to a nearby Walmart where I picked up a new pair of traveling shoes.  I didn't want to look like a homeless person on the MARTA.  I also picked up a drink and an easy snack to hold me over.
The ride down to the northern most MARTA station was uneventful and I was dropped off at the Kiss and Ride parking area.  It was $2.50 for a MARTA ride to the airport which I thought was a deal as I was going from the northern most station to the southern most station.  It was nice seeing civilization and the ride, even though it stopped at every stop (14 of them), was quick and uneventful.
Once at the airport, I found the hotel shuttle area and to my surprise, my shuttle pulled up a couple of minutes after I got there.  Dropped off at the hotel, I went up to my room and got my shower.  I had clean underwear, socks and shirt to put on so I only had to wear my dirty pants for a while.  I secured an UBER ride to the nearest Target and purchased a pair of jeans, a shirt and a belt.  Unfortunately I forgot to buy deodorant and a comb (yes I needed a comb).
I then walked around until I found a local restaurant.  Guess what?  It was Mexican.  Seems to be a theme here.  I had a good meal and lots of sweet tea and then called another UBER to bring me back to the hotel.  While in the restaurant, I changed clothes in the bathroom so I felt a bit more ""normal"" as would be expected by the local population.  At least as normal as on old guy with a bushy beard would be, all things considered.
Had a nap and then found a local Ruby Tuesday that I could walk to and headed off for dinner.  Had a great dinner and good conversation with another person at the bar and headed back to the hotel in the dark wishing I had my headlamp with me.  Fortunately, there were few muggers out in the rain and I made it back to the hotel safely.

Found a Walmart on the MARTA line so I headed there and bought my deodorant and duffle bag and a couple of snacks and then headed back to the hotel.  After another nap, I headed out to a local Weston Hotel that had a restaurant.  It was closer than Ruby Tuesday but turned out to be a bit more expensive.  Had a burger and beer and headed back to the hotel since my wakeup call would be at 3:15 am.  I scheduled with a local taxi to pick me up at 3:30 am as my plane was due to take off at 5:45 am",,Holiday Inn Express College Park,"Oct 06, Wed",0

Water Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645312,"Since I started at Abol Bridge, I needed to return to my starting point and head north to Katahdin.  My daughter #1 and now son-in-law #3 wanted to join me on the final hike, so we had to get a parking permit for them.  I didn't need a parking permit but would need a thru hiker permit which I will get tomorrow.  The earliest parking permit we could get was on the 12th of Oct.  The long range weather forecast indicated good weather so we were happy with the date but it would mean that I would have to cool my heels from the 7th to the 11th at home.
We decided that I would drive up from home alone and park near Abol bridge.  My daughter and son-in-law would then arrive later in the early evening and pick up my truck and bring it to the hotel in Millinocket.  I would hike from Abol to the Birches Campground which is a campground specifically for north-bound thru hikers.  
There was a kiosk at the start of the trail and a ridgerunner was there to help out with the paperwork.  I got there early enough to get one of the 12 spaces reserved for thru hikers.  I was also given a card to fill out for the ranger who would be giving me my permit.
The hike was easy as the route was mostly flat but I had to get reacquainted with Maine roots.  There were a couple of very small inclines but I walked mostly along a river and a stream.  I slowed down as I had plenty of time to get to my destination as it was only 10 miles.  I started at 11 and got to the Ranger Station at 4 pm which was my normal 2 mph.  I'd like to go back as there were a couple of waterfalls that I missed.
I had to check into the Ranger Station to get my permit and pay my $10 for camping.  There were 5 other people there so the ranger did a group discussion, telling us of the rules and regs for climbing Katahdin.  They are very sensitive to excess celebration and wanted to emphasize that it was a solemn place revered by the local Indian Tribe.  Although the ranger did a great job and was very friendly, I got the impression that Baxter would be happy if no on ever climbed Katahdin.
The ranger also indicated that there were few hammock spots and that we would need to pick a location that was well used and not one that had grass or other vegetation.  He also said he would be by to check on us.  I headed quickly to the campsite to get a hammock spot rather than get water first.  There were two other hammockers so I wanted to beat them to the punch.
Got set up in a well worn area and met a Canadian who I had met on the trail early in my journey.  I hadn't met any of the other folks.  The campsite was full (12 is the capacity) but we all found spots to set up our tents/hammocks.
I had my dinner on the picnic table and watched as one of the hikers started a campfire.  This would be only my second campfire of my trip.  The first was on my first day of my hike (provided by the maintainers at Rainbow Stream Lean-To).  Ironic that my second was on the last night of my trip.  I never lit a campfire as that represented time and effort which I had little of at night.  For some reason, the folks I did share a campsite with had the same feeling and we never had a campfire.
The odor of pot started up as everyone except for me lit up.  I still plan to work part time in the petrochemical industry and they do a lot of random drug testing as well as preemployment testing.  They also use hair so I wasn't taking any chances.  I decided to head to my hammock and listen to music as I fell asleep.","Abol Bridge at Mile 15.3

Water Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645314,"With just 5.4 miles to go, I was excited to get started.  (actually the total miles for the day would be 10.8 miles but I only record the trail miles in the direction of travel).  I got up at my usual time of 5:30 am and was walking down the road to the Hunt Trail parking lot at about 6:15 am.  I knew my daughter would be at the gate at 6 am but I didn't know how long it would take her to get to the parking lot.
I made it to the parking lot just as my daughter and son-in-law showed up.  Talk about good timing.  We got our packs out and did the usual bathroom stop before hitting the trail at 7 am.  
The first part of the trail started out at 1,000 feet of elevation and was relatively smooth and level.  It followed Katahdin Stream for about a mile to a bridge crossing at Katahdin Steam Falls.  Once over the stream, the trail started up at a reasonable rate but it was becoming very rocky with larger rocks than I was used to when on the southern trail.
The rate of climb increased as we progressed up the trail, quickly going from 1,600 feet at the bridge to 2,400 feet in about a half mile.  In another half mile we were already up to 3,800 feet and it was getting very rocky and the rocks were now boulders that we had to climb around or over.  We were now in the most difficult section of the trail and there were only a few metal handholds to assist in our climb.  Climbing up is always easier than climbing down the same surface as you have a better view of handholds and footholds while those are usually not as visible when you descend.  I didn't think about descending as my focus was on getting to the top.
We were now above tree line and the views were spectacular.  Although it was a bit hazy, it was a picture perfect day for a hike.  The temperatures were reasonable and we had stripped down to our t-shirts.  The wind was mild and not a problem at all.  I could see where a strong wind would be problematic on this trail as you were often very exposed to the wind while standing on a small and narrow rock outcropping.  Much of the climb was near technical in nature but we managed.  I was regretting taking my full pack with me as it proved to put my center of gravity off a bit just when I didn't need it to do that.  However, I wanted to hike just like I hiked the rest of the trail and that meant bringing my pack with a full load.   The Ranger Station had loaner day packs for those that just wanted to take the bare necessities.  They could then leave their main pack at the Ranger Station.  I declined to do that as did many of the other thru hikers.
The most difficult part of the climb was the half mile section just before the Gateway which is the entrance to the Tablelands.  It was very strenuous and it took us some time to get up to the Gateway.  Once on the Tablelands, the trail leveled out but was still very rocky so progress was still slow.  We got to Thoreau Springs which is where the Abol Trail crosses the Hunt Trail.  We stayed on the Hunt Trail (AT) and proceeded up to the summit.  From our perspective, it appeared that a distant peak was the summit.  As it turned out, the actual summit was much closer and once we got close enough, we could see people at the summit.  
There were quite a number of folks up on the Tablelands and on the summit.  I headed out at my pace and was soon well ahead of my group.  I got to the ridge about a half mile short of the summit and waited for them.  I could see the sign now signifying the summit and it was starting to occur to me that the end was near.
Once my group got up to me, we headed out together.  I reached the sign and to my surprise, no one was nearby so I had it all to myself.  I bent down and said a little prayer of thanks that I had made it without hurting myself.  I couldn't believe that I was there.  My group arrived a few minutes later and I got up on the sign to do the iconic poles up pose on the sign, signifying the end of my thru hike.
We had hiked close to two other couples who joined us for a group photo at the sign.  It had taken us 5 hours to get to the summit so we didn't want to stay too long as we would be hiking in the dark if we did.
Reluctantly, we headed back down.  My apprehension increased as I visualized the problems that we would have in our reverse trip.  It was scary in a couple of places and we did a lot of butt sliding but we helped each other and made it down the difficult part safely.  I'm glad I had company today as I would not have wanted to maneuver down those rocks alone.
We hiked down in silence most of the time, each deep in thought about what had just happened.  The trip down took just as long as the trip up and we made it back to the parking lot at 6 pm.  It was getting dark in the heavily wooded areas since most of the vegetation was coniferous.  However, it was still light enough to get to the parking lot safely.
We headed back to the hotel which was a good 45 minutes away and I then drove home alone (after a stop at McDonald's for a sweet tea and supper).  An end to a great day.
I want to thank my Daughter #1 and Son-In-Law #3 for taking the time to join me on the completion of my hike.  It made the hike more memorable and I could not have completed the hike without them.","The Birches Campsite
",Mt. Katahdin and Return,"Oct 12, Tue",5.40
Water Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645325,"This is a summary of my activities and costs of my thru hike.
1.  Distance Traveled:  2,193.1 is the official length of the Appalachian Trail.  This does not include the 5 miles or so of wrong way hiking or the couple of miles of backtracking because the blazing was poor.  Nor does it include the miles of hiking off trail to go to a store or deli or walking in town to restaurants and grocery stores.
2.  Time on Trail:  I started May 23 @ noon time at mile 15.3 and ended on October 4th at about 5 pm at mile 0.  This encompassed 134 days from Maine to Georgia and then two more days back in Maine hiking the 15.3 miles up to Katahdin.  So my potential hiking days were 136 days.
3.  Average Daily Distance:  At 136 days on trail, I would have averaged 16.1 miles per day.  But I did not hike all of these days as I took 6 zero hiking days.  Consequently, I hiked a total of 130 days.  Several of those days were very short hiking days (< 5 miles) but I'll still call them a hiking day.  This means I averaged 16.9 miles per day.  BTW, I did not take a zero the last 30 days of my hike.  I met people who were taking zeros or multiple zeros every week.  That explains why it takes some folks up to 7 months to finish the trail.
4.  Cost of the Hike:  I tried to use my credit card to keep track of my expenses.  There were occasions where I needed cash as many shuttle drivers and some hostels only took cash.  The following is a breakdown of my expenses.
       ATM: Cash -               $340
       Dining -             $1,536.05
       Equipment -      $1,247.87
       Food -               $2,588.07
       Lodging -              $709.04
       Shipping -              $41.95
       Shuttle -              $295.11
       Permits -               $25.00
       Misc -                    $10.04
       Total -              $6,793.13
I came home with about $40 bucks in my pocket so the ATM should be $300 but I was too lazy to change it.  Dining included anything that I ate immediately upon purchase.  Some dining will be found in food as I often bought a couple of snacks and some ice cream at the grocery store and ate them as I repacked my pack.  I didn't remove them from Food so food is inflated a bit and Dining is a bit smaller than actual.
The equipment included two pairs of shoes as I started with a pair that had about 150 miles on them and I also had another pair that I had purchased on sale a few months before the hike that I wore to the end of the hike.
Lodging included all hotel and hostel stays.  I stayed at several Holiday Inns and these were free as I used my points.  So lodging would have been at least $500 higher if I had to pay for those nights.  Most hostels in the north were in the $40 range per night while those in the south were as cheap as $9 per night.  I liked hotels as I had a room to myself but I still got a terrible nights sleep as my body was used to my hammock.  Many of the hostels reduced my overnight fee by letting me hang my hammock in their back yards.  I preferred this as I got a good night's sleep (except in Luray VA where the hostel was next door to a very active RR track.)
Shipping was for packages that the wife sent to me and a package I sent back home.  Many folks mail themselves packages at many stops on the trail, basically resupplying themselves.  I didn't want to do this as it would require me to be in a specific location at a specific time.  Too much planning needed.
Shuttle - Many hostels provided free shuttle pick up at the trailheads but may charge for shuttle service into town.  These were minimal at best.  I paid as little as $5 for a shuttle but the fee generally ranged from $25 to $40 bucks and usually was around $1/mile.  The most I paid was the $125  for my final shuttle to Atlanta.  The Uber rides I took while in Atlanta were also included in this category.
The permits were for the Smokies ($20) and Baxter State Park parking ($5).
Food was the biggest expenses as I would resupply about every five days and usually spent over $100 each time.  I didn't want to cook my evening meal so I tried to get dehydrated Mountain House meals whenever possible.  (I did not use my stove for breakfast or lunch).  There was only one occasion when I couldn't get Mountain House so I had to get what everyone else gets, ramen noodles, Knorr Side dishes and instant potatoes.  The Mountain House meals cost about $9.00 each from Walmart and $10.00 from outfitters.  This was a luxury as I only had to boil water and didn't have to ""cook"" anything plus cleanup was minimal.  I could have saved about $8 per meal by going to ramen noodles and Knorr Side Dishes.  This would have saved about $1,000 or so.  As far as I was concerned, it was money well spent.  I got a good hot meal with lots of calories with minimal cleanup. 
So my daily trail costs were $50 per day using all 136 days.
5.  Wild Animals Seen:
       Bears:  3  (one in NH, one in VT and one in TN)  In no case, did I worry about bears
       Snakes:  I only saw 4-5 black snakes which are nonvenomous and in most cases just laid passively on the side of the trail.  I heard about a lot of rattle snakes and copperheads but did not see any myself.
       Other:  I heard coyotes at night when I got into the Smokies but didn't see any.
6.  Stinking Insects:  I got stung 8 times on 4 occasions.  The first occasion, I was stung 4 times and once the remaining three occasions.  I did not have a negative reaction other than it hurt like hell for several hours.
7.  Other Animals
      Deer:   Lots of deer south of PA.  The deer in the Shenandoah's were almost tame as there is no hunting there and they are not afraid of humans.  I almost had to push one out of the way as it was busy eating something on the side of the trail
     Rabbits:  Saw a few of these (maybe 10) over the entire trip.  Most were in VA.
     Squirrels-  Lots of these.  The ones further south seemed much more timid and would get out of my way quickly.  The northern squirrels hung around a bit longer but eventually moved away from me.  I'm not sure if this is the reason but squirrel hunting is very popular in the south and that may be why they were more skittish.
8.  Equipment Problems:  I really didn't have many problems with my equipment.  My pack had some stitching come loose but it didn't seem to bother it's performance.  I think my losing so much weight caused more problems as I had to readjust the pack several times.  I'm glad the pack had an adjustable hip belt otherwise, I would have had to buy a new pack halfway thru the hike.  I probably will throw my pack away as there are numerous rips and tears in the side pockets but otherwise it performed well.
I did have one time where the zipper on my hammock came apart from one end.  I was able to bring it back to the original configuration and it didn't separate again.  I was constantly concerned about the straps or whoopie slings failing but they worked great throughout the trip and showed little signs of fatigue or failure.
My shoes took the most beating from the trail.  I replaced my first pair in Hanover, NH not because the shoe had failed but I needed more cushion.  I found that ME and NH really played hell with my feet and legs.  Hanover is at mile 442 so I walked 427 miles plus the 150 or so miles already on the shoes.  So my first pair lasted about 570 miles.  
The second pair lasted from Hanover, NH to Hamburg, PA which was 500 miles.  But they also went through the rocks of NY, NJ and part of PA so I was happy with the performance.
The third pair (Merrill MOAB 2) is still in service and I wore them from Hamburg, PA to Daleville, VA.  They did very well for this 500 miles.  I sent them home and replaced them with another pair of Altra Lone Peaks as the Merrill's felt very heavy especially when they got wet. 
I wore this last pair for the remainder of the trip.  This amounted to 731 miles.  The shoes actually should have been replaced at about 500 miles but at the rate I was traveling on the lower portion of the trail, it was difficult to find a location that I could get to in the time required to get the shoes shipped to me.  I was also lazy and kind of wanted to see how long the shoes would last.  It was touch and go at the end but they made it and I felt bad about throwing the away.
So all in all, the equipment worked well.  I was never cold at night, rather I was often hot as my quilts were rated for 20F.  I bought a sleeping bag liner that I slept in when it was really hot and used my top quilt as my pillow.",,View Entry,"Oct 21, Thu",0
Water Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645780,"I did a lot of research prior to my hike and the people writing many of the stories or producing Youtube videos spoke of how the trail changed their lives.  I worried about this as I hiked because I wasn't feeling the same ""life changing"" moment.  I enjoyed my hike and I'm glad I did it but it certainly wasn't life changing for me.  I guess I like my life and I don't want it to change.  I'm hoping that my advanced maturity (e.g. age) has something to do with it.People have asked me why I was hiking the Appalachian Trail.  My answer after many hours of reflection would be ""why not"".  It wasn't a bucket list item as I don't have a bucket list.  I view a bucket list as something that would only result in regret at the end of your life.  I take life one day at a time and enjoy the moment.  There are many things that I would like to see and do but if I don't, it's no big deal.People also ask if this was something that I've been thinking of doing for some time.  I did think about it when I was much younger but life got in the way and I pushed it to the back of my mind.  I think that I viewed hiking the AT as a non-attainable activity based upon our finances and the time I had available to me to do something like this.  Once I retired and started to work with the Maine Appalachian Trail Club (MATC), the thought percolated to the surface again and I started to verbalize it first to my wife and then to all of the people she told.  Once she started to socialize the idea to her friends, I was committed.What I did enjoy from the trail was all of the people I met.  There were many friendly and generous people on the trail.  Other hikers would share whatever they had.  I turned down many offers of food, rides and equipment as I didn't need anything at the time but it was always available.  I met many trail angels who wanted nothing more than to offer whatever they had to hikers, like Moose in NY who spent over $100 per day for 31 days in July and wouldn't take a donation.  I only met one person panhandling on the trail.  I was never worried about people and enjoyed learning about them as we sat around the shelter at night.  I also liked the day hikers or weekend campers as they were very inquisitive and asked a lot of questions.  Many also had good bourbon to share.All in all, I'm glad I did the hike.  It became a challenge that I felt I was up to and being somewhat of a procrastinator and someone who may not completely finish things, I was proud to say that I did the whole thing.  It's one thing I can point to that I completed.  I was a purist and hiked every white blaze.  There were many areas where a blue side trail was shorter or easier but I didn't take those but I knew many who did.  So why did I hike the Appalachian Trail?   Because it was there and I wanted to see if I was up to the challenge.Am I going to do the Triple Crown?  The Triple Crown is the AT, the Continental Divide Trail (CDT) and the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT).  No, I have no interest in going west to do those trails.  I may do the Long Trail in Vermont.  The Long Trail is 272 miles and goes north from the Massachusetts Border to the border with Canada.  I've already done the bottom 100 miles so it would be a good hike that wouldn't take that long.  I would likely do the entire thing so I estimate it to take no more than 20 days.But first I'm going to concentrate on my 48 miles of the AT in Maine.  As the manager of the Baldpate District, I need to be very familiar with my trail so I'll be hiking that a couple of times a year to check on maintenance and condition of the trail.  I've also got over 20 miles of side trails that fall in the district so I'll need to hike those as well.And of course we'll be traveling in our RV in the spring and fall so I'll be busy for a while.  Maybe I'll try to break the oldest AT hiker record in 16 years or so.........",,View Entry,"Nov 14, Sun",0
Water Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645833,"These 10 rules were developed over time and through experience.1.  NEVER pass up trail magic.  People take a lot of time and effort (and money) to provide hikers with trail magic.  It is our responsibility to accept their trail magic and if they are present, to thank them profusely.2.  If you are a mouth breather, you should wear a head net in areas with lots of flying insects, otherwise your protein intake will involuntarily increase3.  If you are wearing a headnet, don't spit.4.  If you spit, do so with enough force to propel the spit away from you otherwise the spit will dribble down onto the hat that's hanging from your breast strap.5.  When descending a rock face, do it in the same way that you would have ascended the rock face, i.e. face the rock.  If you don't,  your face may hit the rock.6.  Never pass up a good flowing water source7.  Never pass up a trash can.8.  Never forget that wet wooden steps are slippery.9.  Replace your shoes when they need replacing.10.  Ibuprofen is your friend",,View Entry,"Nov 19, Fri",0
Water Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646412,"As I have previously mentioned, I was very happy with the performance of my gear.  I had few breakdowns but most if not all of my gear lasted through to the end of my hike.  But there were a couple of things I changed out and a couple of things I would have changed out but the opportunity never really presented itself in a timely manner.
Things I changed, added or removed.
1.  Rain Kilt for rain pants.  I never got to use my rain pants.  The original pants were from Frogg Toggs and were crinkly and stiff and my first five days on the trail were dry so I didn't need them.  Once I got to Shaw's in Monson, ME, I had the opportunity to see a rain kilt.  I had seen these on Youtube and was intrigued by them.  I didn't at the time think that they would work for me but as I moved about and found how hot the trail really really was, I decided that a rain kilt would be the way to go.  For one thing, it was easy to put on or take off where pants would require me to remove my pack and to then don or remove the rain pants.  I could don the rain kilt while wearing the pack although I never did.
The rain kilt wasn't as robust as the rain pants and I developed several tears in the material over time.  I was able to repair the rips with tape that I carried and since the tape was white and the kilt was green, you could easily see the repairs so I ended up looking a bit worn when wearing the kilt.  I make this point as I had to discard the kilt on the completion of my hike so it made it all the way from Monson to Springer, but it was too worn out to keep.
I liked the rain kilt as it kept my pants dry.  I didn't care about my lower legs and you can't keep your feet dry on the trail when the trail is saturated.  Plus rain pants wouldn't have kept my feet dry anyway.  Plus the rain kilt allowed for ventilation so I didn't overheat like you would in rain pants and then you ended up sweating so much your pants got as wet as you would have not wearing rain pants.
There were a couple of occasions when I did get the back of my pants wet while wearing the kilt.  I think it was because I was sweating so much from my upper body and the sweat was running down my back onto my pants.
All in all, I would recommend wearing a rain kilt rather than pants and in a pinch you could use a regualar contractors garbage bag for this purpose.  Simply cut the bottom out of the garbage bag and then get into the bag positioning the bag ties at your waist.  Cinch the ties tight and tie and you have a rain kilt.  Fortunately, fashion and style are not graded on the trail
2.  Added a sleeping bag liner.  I carried a 20F top quilt and 20F bottom quilt.  I always put the bottom quilt under the hammock but during the hotter summer months, I either slept on top of my top quilt or simply used it as a pillow.  Unfortunately I like some cover over my body when I sleep so I bought the sleeping bag liner to provide that cover as it generally provided enough weight to satisfy my need for a cover and it didn't add too much to my base weight.
Things I should have or will change for the future:
1.  Food Cozy.  I made a pot cozy with cover for my pot but since I only used my pot for boiling water, I really never used the pot cozy.  I think that I would rather have a flat cozy that a Mountain House food container would fit into to stay warm.  This would resemble a sandwich bag that you could slide the Mountain House meal into and would have some means to close the top so the meal stayed nice and warm.  I don't think the end result would weigh that much more than the pot cozy I made.
2.  Get a larger pot.  I used a 500 ml titanium pot as my only cooking utensil.  It was large enough to boil up to 2 cups of water which was the maximum I needed for one meal.  There were times when I would have like a hot drink in addition to the meal which would have required me to do two boils, one to boil water for the meal and the second to boil water for the hot drink.  I plan to get a larger pot (700 or 900 ml) for two reasons.  One to allow for a larger boil volume and two to allow for the storage of the larger fuel canisters.  There were quite a few instances when I couldn't get the smaller fuel canisters which fit nicely in the 500 ml pot.  The larger fuel canisters would only fit into the 700 or 900 ml pots so I ended up having to make room for both my pot (which contained the stove and cleaning cloth) and a fuel canister.  A larger pot would have allowed me to store the fuel canister and stove in the same pot saving some space in the pack.
3.  Get a storage bag for the sundry items that always ended up in the top of my pack.  Once I got the five criticals stored in the waterproof bag in the bottom of my pack, I would then put the dehydrated meals on top of that and then my food bag on top of that.  I was left with a small number of items that just randomly fit into the top of my pack.  Getting to the food bag at lunch meant I had to remove all of these things and they often got scattered over the ground if I wasn't at a campsite.  In one instance, my stove which is cylindrical, started to roll away down a hill.  Fortunately I was able to catch it before it went too far.  By putting all of these loose items into a storage bag (they are form fitted to the backpack so they provide maximum storage capacity) that zips closed, you eliminate the possibility of losing them when you repack.  I was manic about doing everything the same way each time.  This may have been deemed to be compulsive but it made certain that I never lost anything or left anything behind while on the trail.  These bags aren't cheap as they are made from very lightweight but strong material but they are worth it.
4.  I would like to investigate the use of an umbrella rather than use a rain coat.  There were only a very few instances where the rain was going sideways.  In most instances since you were under tree cover, the rain fell vertically and an umbrella would work.  I only saw a few people with umbrellas and since it wasn't raining, they were all stored away on the outside of the pack.  I meant to ask about them but never got the opportunity.  I did meet a lot of folks who just threw caution to the wind and didn't use anything to protect them from the rain.  They figured that they were going to get wet anyway either from the rain or from sweating too much so why bother.  I liked my rain jacket when it got colder and the rain was very uncomfortable.  I could see that not wearing raingear when it was hot did make some sense and there were a couple of occasions when I didn't wear raingear (usually because I was caught by surprise and once I got wet, I figured I couldn't get any wetter.)
5.  Obtain 40F quilts (bottom and top) for the warmer months.  With Covid, the wait times for gear from the cottage industry folks increased to months so I would have had to order this stuff well before I left in May.  It would also require that I be a specific spot to accept the package and to mail the 20F gear back home.  This would have reduced my base weight a bit and I would have not had to buy the sleeping bag liner.  I would have lost my 40F pillow but I still had my puffy jacket that could be used for that purpose.
As you can see, there aren't many things I would change.  I was please with my selection of equipment and I did have several positive comments about my sleep system.  They especially liked my tarp with the doors at each end.  My tarp was very large and provided quite a bit of cover from the elements.  I never got wet nor did any of my gear that was stored on the ground under my hammock.",,View Entry,"Jan 20, Thu",0
