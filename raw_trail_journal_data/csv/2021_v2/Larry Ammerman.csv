Larry Ammerman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613772,"I have been thinking about / planning / acquiring stuff for a hike of the AT for several years.  So far I have hiked about 140 miles in 3 sections but I really want to challenge myself to hiking hopefully the entire AT.  I am retiring at the end of 2019 at the age of 65 and hope to begin my hike the first week of April.  I have thought through various options and because I don't have the desire to be in or behind a large bubble of hikers, I plan to start at Waynesboro VA and hike north.  If anyone else is thinking of flip-flopping and starting about the same time let me know.",,View Entry,"May 10, Fri",0
Larry Ammerman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613313,"I am really getting tired of planning and overanalyzing hiking plans and gear.  I am doing my best to continue exercising 4-5 times a week, but I know the best hiking fitness is hiking and while I have not problem hiking with my backpack, hiking up and down AT terrain is very different. The more I read books and watch vlogs the more I just want to get started.  Alas, I still have several more months of my career before I can start next spring.  If anyone is planning a flip-flop starting early April, I would love to correspond.",,View Entry,"May 12, Sun",0
Larry Ammerman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613745,"I am paranoid about footwear to wear on my hike.  I have learned that traditional hiking boots are out.  I hiked the AT in Shenandoah Park in  traditional boots and they stayed wet the entire trip.  I tried to change out socks to keep a dry pair on and that did not work due to wet boots or rain on the trail.  I have had the issue with black toes on after several hikes and so I keep trying different shoes that are larger sizes and so far I have not found the right pair.  Part of my frustration is I have run for 30 years and NEVER had a problem with blisters or black toes.  I keep thinking I just haven't found the right shoes and socks to wear, but I hate spending $ on different shoes that you really don't know how they will perform until you have backpacked on a trail for several days.  I have gotten advice at hiking stores, but the staff there don't have my feet and so they really don't know how a pair feels.  I plan to keep hiking and trying to find the right combination because footwear can truly make all the difference in a long hike.",,View Entry,"May 17, Fri",0
Larry Ammerman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617105,Hiked the section of AT from Boonesboro to Harpers Ferry with my son-in-law.  Enjoyable hike and saw a number of NOBO thru hikers which really made me envious and wanting to start my own hike. I was able to test out footwear and clothing and everything was very comfortable.,,View Entry,"Jun 16, Sun",0
Larry Ammerman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625298,"I had begun increasing my workouts recently trying to build my fitness prior to starting my hike of the AT.  I began to notice some pain on the inside of my knee and initally thought it was just soreness related to climbing stairs.  Well finally decided the pain was similar to pain I had previously experienced several years ago prior to meniscus surgery and decided to consult an orthopedic surgeon.  Well, the prognosis is yes I probably have a tear but no recommendation of surgery and blessings on my attempt to hike the AT.  I guess getting older definitely presents its challenges.  I am determined to give this my best shot knowing that reasonable pain is part of the experience of hiking.  The doctor does not think I can do any additional damage so the plans are still going forward.",,View Entry,"Dec 15, Sun",0
Larry Ammerman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625557,"As of 12/31/19 I have officially retired!  Now I find my self really focused on my AT hike.  I have started hiking regularly with my loaded backpack doing 8-10 miles here on trails around Fort Worth.  I think I have all of my gear, just can't seem to settle on what clothes to take.  I guess I have plenty of time to keep changin my mind.  It seems there are now several of the 2020 class that are doing flip-flop hikes.  Hopefully we will meet up along the way and provide support for those early miles.",,View Entry,"Jan 02, Thu",0
Larry Ammerman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627082,"Well I had planned to start my flip-flop hike April 12.   I got the email from the ATC this morning pleading with hikers to postpone hiking due to the COVID-19 issues and the possible issues it will cause for trail communities, hostels and people along the trail.  Well I have decided to take their advice and not start now.  Depending on how this pandemic issue develops, I may attempt delay my start till fall and start at Harpers Ferry and head south first.This is really a bummer, but I don't want to possibly impact myself or people along the trail.",,View Entry,"Mar 18, Wed",0
Larry Ammerman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627215,"I have decided to restart my dream of hiking the AT the first week of September 2020, hopefully after this virus mess is completed and the heat of summer has begun to wane.  I plan to start at Harper's Ferry and hike south to Georgia hopefully finishing around the first part of November.  Taking a break over the winter months and then starting the NOBO section of my hike next April, 2021.  I am grateful to be retired and have the flexibility to possibly make this happen.  I have had a week of disappointment from having to postpone, but I realized that there is time to restart a 2020 hike and enjoy the autumn splendor of the trees as I hike south.  Hopefully there will be others who make this decision as well, because the companionship and community of the trail is one of the aspects I most look forward to.See you in the fall!Larry",,View Entry,"Mar 22, Sun",0
Larry Ammerman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632202,"After the flare up of virus infections this fall, I decided to wait until spring 2021 to start my AT hike.  I am planning to get vaccinated as soon as possible and at least have that protection prior to beginning a hike.  I am keeping my same starting location (the sounthern end of SNP) hiking north.  I want to at least accomplish a northern half hike and then evaluate a possible southern section hike.  I hope to meet others on the trail in a year when a hike will still be a very different experience.",,View Entry,"Jan 08, Fri",0
Larry Ammerman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632318,I have registered with the ATC to begin my flip flop hike starting in SNP on April 11.  I have not changed my gear much since my planned hike in 2020 was deferred due to virus.  I went on a 3 day hike in NW Alabama in October and was pleased with home most of my gear worked.  I am hoping to have one more multi-day shakedown hike before I leave for Virginia.  One change I am making is moving to Ursack AllMitey bag instead of hanging bear bag.  I had considered this before but heard mice could damage the regular Ursack bags.  Yes this bag is heavier but it will be nice not having to find a suitable branch to throw a line over.,,View Entry,"Jan 17, Sun",0
Larry Ammerman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634196,Leaving for my hike is now a week away.  I am starting in the southern section of SNP and heading north.  My pack weight starting with all my gear and 6 days of food is right around 35 lbs.  I was hoping for less but with so much of SNP waysides still closed I am carrying more food just for safety.,,View Entry,"Apr 02, Fri",0
