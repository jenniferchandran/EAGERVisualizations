Luke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635944,"Yes, I am a Lasher (Long Ass Section Hiker). This is my fifth and final year of my section hike of the AT. Last years plan to make it to Katahdin was squelched after completing 150 miles. It was not always easy getting rides into towns, strange looks from the locals, and my own concerns due to Covid took the joy away. So, I'm back this year, 30 miles south of the New Hampshire border, just outside of Killington VT.  I won't have my hiking buddy, Slow and Steady joining me this year, as he is having knee replacement. Good Luck SAS! 
I'm looking forward to NH and Maine, the Presidentals, Mt. Washington, the 100 mile Wilderness, but not the black flies. Hopefully, there journey will be near completion upon the beginning of my journey.  
I plan on starting May 21. Preparation is fairly straight forward after doing it the four previous year. Made only one gear change this year to a lighter hammock. Probably will start with a cook set, but most likely change to cold soaking after a few weeks, as I did the last couple of years. Hot trail food always sounds good, but shedding a few lbs. wins out in the end.","Long Tail Inn

Luke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638010,"Back in Vermont, 45 miles south of New Hampshire for the final leg of my AT section hike. Got on trail at 9:30. It was already hot and muggy. What happened to New England spring!
After an hour, the humidity was taking it’s toll. I knew it would be a short first day. As the temperature continued to rise, and the humidity zapped my strength, the mosquitoes decided to come out. As long as I was moving, it wasn’t bad. But stop, and those tiny blood sucking vampires went to town on me. That’s right, I didn’t have any bug spray other than some wipes that didn’t offer much protection. I stopped at a waterfall for lunch and fortunately someone offered me some bug spray. I never wanted 100% deet on me so bad. About 4 miles in, I came to a 1,200 ft. climb. No big deal, I had just completed a 100 mile training hike in Tennessee. This hill kicked my butt. I had to stop every few hundred feet to rest. I don’t know if it was the steep grade of the assent, the heat and humidity or combination of the two. I finally made it to the top and I was fried. It didn’t help that two twenty somethings, flew by me like I was standing still. Three more miles and I arrived at a shelter. It was only three o’clock, but I decided to call it a day. There was one other hiker there, about my age. He helped lift my confidence as he admitted having a tough time with the climb as well. Quick dinner of pizza that I had packed out from town and off to bed. Hiker midnight came early tonight.

Quiet night, except for a few small fury creatures running by my hammock. Up early after 9 hours of sleep and on trail by 7:00. The morning air was cool. This made an early morning 5 mile assent more manageable than yesterday’s death march. After a couple of hours, I crested the climb and was feeling strong. What a difference a day makes. Only saw two other people today, they were heading south. Made 10 miles by one thirty which was my planned stop for the day.  Too early to stop, so I ate lunch and headed back out for an easy 4 miles, down hill.  Plan was to go into Woodstock Vt, four miles away and get some bug spray. No luck, Covid has shut down the shuttles that locals provide for hikers. Fortunately, the owner of an old farm house, a few hundred feet from the trail, let’s hikers camp in his back yard. My Hammock is set up next to a river, and ready for another early night, and feeling more confident after a 13.8 mile day.","Stony Brook Shelter

Luke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638068,"14 miles to West Hartford Vt. Daniel, whose yard I camped in last night brought coffee out in the morning. I’m not a coffee drinker, but after a cold night it was welcome. It got down to 38 degrees and camping next to a river adds a natural air conditioner. I’m aware of this effect, but I love listening to the sound of the water. Three decent climbs today. Arrived at the big blue garage with a large AT logo in West Hartford around 4:00 (a road crossing with a few houses) This is a popular hostel on the trail where the owner likes to get you to jump off rocks into the river. I was spared as they hadn’t opened for the season. Fortunately, they let me stay. Had the entire garage attic to myself. This is definitely early to be this far north. Pizza from Dominos and early to bed. Tomorrow New Hampshire, 9.5 miles.","Near Woodstock Vt

Luke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638070,"Goodbye VT, Hello NH. An easy 9.9 miles into Hanover, NH, home of Dartmouth College, a quaint college town. 1,200  ft climb to start the day and then fairly easy hike following. Came out of the woods after 7 miles and then a 1 mile road walk into Norwich. Had lunch at the Blue Sparrow. Great Sandwich. After lunch 1.5 mile road walk into Hanover. Road walks are unusual on the AT. Between Norwich and Hanover I crossed over the the Connecticut River, the border of Vt. and NH. A gust of wind came up and my hat flew off my head,  50’ down in the river, aargh! There were 2 young women on paddle boards who saved my hat and took it to the shore. It wad a bit of a climb over large boulders to retrieve it...Stupid is as Stupid does. Staying at a hotel tonight, with a planned zero tomorrow. The hostels are part of the adventure, but a night in a hotel is welcomed.","West Hartford, VT

Luke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638076,8.3 miles. Still caught in the Hanover vortex. Short slack pack day. My ride picked me up at 9:00am. A short 15 minute drive to the trail head. Terrain was flat or downhill except for one 600 ft climb. A couple trail runners passed ( I was close to Hanover) and  one thru hiker. His trail name is 5am. He gets out of camp early. This is the second time we have crossed paths. Tomorrow will be another southbound slack pack day as the weather gets cold with lows in the lower thirties and rain coming in late afternoon. Will avoid camping tomorrow night with a hostel stay.,,View Entry,"May 27, Thu",0
