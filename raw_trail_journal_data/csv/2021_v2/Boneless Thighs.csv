Boneless Thighs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634107,"As is the case for many who plan a thru hike of the Appalachian Trail, this has been years in the making.  Since before I graduated from college (Virginia Tech – Go Hokies!) nearly 40 years ago I have wanted to hike the entire Appalachian Trail.  My Mom and Dad always encouraged my sister and me in our outdoor activities.  As a family we were very active in white water canoeing and kayaking, camping and hiking.  Work and family took priority (and that is a good thing for sure!) very quickly and this thru hike dream was put on the back burner.  Covid has delayed things a bit but I’ve been fortunate to be able to retire and take the time to give it a try in 2021.  My wonderful wife is very understanding and supportive but isn't interested in sleeping on the ground for 6 months.  A long time friend and hiking buddy was interested so hopefully the two of us can complete this behemoth of a hike together.   The plan is to do a NOBO flip flop starting in Harpers Ferry, WV which is relatively close to home in Maryland.  After Katahdin we will either head south from Harpers Ferry or start the 2nd leg at Springer Mountain, GA and head north.  We’re not sure yet.",,View Entry,"Mar 31, Wed",0
Boneless Thighs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634763,"A date has finally been set for me to begin my attempt of an Appalachian Trail (AT) thru hike.   I will be starting on Thursday, April 29th mid-day sometime.  My friend and hiking buddy Jeff and I are doing a flip-flop hike starting as a NOBO (short for Northbound) hike from the Appalachian Trail Conference headquarters in Harpers Ferry, WV.   Once we summit Mt. Katahdin in Maine we plan to catch a ride back to Harpers Ferry and head south to Springer Mountain, GA.  It will be somewhere around 2200 miles total on the trail plus an unknown number of miles heading to towns along the trail for resupply or for the burgers, pizza and beer that will be calling to us.  Fortunately we will both have our Covid vaccines by then!  
    For my friends who are not familiar with the AT and thru-hiking I’ll review why we chose a flip-flop hike.   A thru-hike of the AT simply means that you completed it in a 12 month period.   You could do it in sections (LASH = Long A** Section Hike), go south to north or vice versa or you can do what is called a flip-flop.   A flip-flop hike usually starts somewhere in the middle and goes to one end or the other.   Then the hiker completes the other section.  Of course there are infinite possibilities for a flip-flop hike.   We chose to start with a NOBO section - Harpers Ferry, WV to Mt. Katahdin, ME for several reasons.  

-       We want to make sure we minimize late season weather risks up north.  We’ve all heard about the infamous weather on Mt. Washington, NH. 

-       Our start is relatively close to home in case we need to deal with any gear issues during the first few weeks.  

-       We avoid the early crowds starting at Springer Mountain, GA which causes overuse of the trail and towns that it runs through. 

    We intend to keep our miles low the first few days and get used to the trail rhythm.  We’re both comfortable hiking longer distances for short periods and have done some shakedowns with our gear but it’s hard to prepare for 6 months on the trail without actually getting out there.   My hope is that my back, knees and feet hold up to the mileage.   While most of our trail time will be spent camping we do intend to take regular breaks in hostels and perhaps even the occasional hotel in towns where we resupply.  A hot shower can do wonders for your mental state when you’ve been soggy for a week. 

    Our pack base weights (backpack and essentials without counting water, fuel and food, which vary day by day) are hovering around 15 pounds.  Total pack weights will be 25 to 28 pounds depending on how much food and water we need to carry.  Technological improvements in gear have made for huge weight savings since I was in scouts with a canvas rucksack and tent and a cotton sleeping bag.   Carbon fiber for backpack frames (ZPacks Arc Haul backpack – 22.6 oz), Dyneema material for tents (ZPacks Duplex tent – 19 oz), and even titanium for cooking pots and utensils.   My water filtration system used to weigh over 20 ounces.   Now it weighs 3 oz (Sawyer squeeze).  It’s crazy.  Just 10 years ago a weeklong trip in the Yellowstone backcountry meant more than 40 pounds on my back.   Less weight means less stress on the body and less energy expended each day to get where we need to go.  

    It’s my hope that I can keep an updated daily journal with some pictures here for my family, friends and anyone else who wants to follow along.   Cell coverage, my limited data plan and how much free time I have will determine how well I keep up with it.  From what I can tell, free time should not be a problem.   

Communication with me is probably best via the Guest Book entries here on TrailJournals or you can text me on my cell if you have it.   I cannot promise a timely response to anyone except for my wife and parents!",,View Entry,"Apr 13, Tue",0
Boneless Thighs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635891,"I'm so excited to be on the trail finally.   Jeff (trail name ""Miles"") and I began our flip flop thru hike attempt in Harpers Ferry, WV heading north from the ATC headquarters with our wives hiking the first couple miles with us.  Saying goodbye was tough.  The hardest part of this trip is being away from Sue and my sons for so long.  It will make the mental part of this hike that much harder.   If they did not support me in this crazy endeavor I doubt I'd be out here.  Since we started mid day we only made it  about 8 miles to the Ed Garvey shelter in Maryland.  Our goal is to start slow and work up to bigger miles in a couple of weeks. If you've never hiked in this area before I highly recommend it.   Lots of history and stunning scenery.  The Maryland Heights hike is my favorite Maryland hike (parking limitations mean that you start on the Harpers Ferry side of the Potomac river).  Finishing the hike with ice cream in Harpers Ferry is the best.  Hiking on the AT up to Weverton cliffs is also very pretty but not quite as good as Maryland Heights.   Harpers Ferry is at the confluence of the Potomac and Shenandoah rivers.  As a teenager my parents, sister & I spent a lot of time canoeing these rivers and teaching whitewater paddling classes on the Potomac with the Monocacy Canoe Club.  Absolutely the BEST way to spend my childhood.    
Thanks Mom, Dad & Ellen!  
We had spotty showers during the day and it was pretty warm.  I am not carrying a thermometer on this hike so I suspect I'll be reporting temperatures as Hot, Cool, Cold and damn Cold.  The AT has a reputation for being a wet trail.   For the most part, once it gets warm you are wet regardless.   Sweat or rain - it doesn't matter except that you are cleaner when it's raining.  I suspect I'm carrying too much food to start this hike.   I have about 9 pounds of food which would probably last me close to 5 days.  We'll resupply at Pen-Mar at the Maryland-Pennsylvania border probably on Sunday.  At some point in a thru hike something called ""hiker hunger"" hits you.   When it does you start eating more.   Snacking during the day is critical to maintain energy levels because you are burning thousands of calories more than you do sitting at home watching My Favorite Martian on TV.  I have no idea when this is going to kick in for me but I'm prepared.   After a couple of weeks I'll be able to better predict what food to carry and hopefully cut my load some.  So, in a nutshell,  our first day was awesome!","Harpers Ferry, WV - mile marker 1026.1

Boneless Thighs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635955,"While it was a crazy windy day today it made for good hiking.   We stayed in the Ed Garvey shelter last night and nobody else came in.   Lucky us.  The temperature never got much below 60.  Breakfast was instant grits (jalapeño flavored!) with bacon bits and crushed Doritos.  Filling for sure but not so healthy I guess.  With limited gear to deal with we got out and on the trail by about 7:30.  
The trail in Maryland is a mix of more rocky and less rocky but it's almost always rocky.  Pennsylvania will be worse.  Way worse. We made our destination by 2 pm so we had some time to kill.  
We had a nice conversation with Moxie who thru hiked in 2017 in her traditional Amish garb.  Yikes.   Looks like that would be miserably hot.  This campground actually has showers so I may clean up some.   However the grunge might be what's keeping the bugs off of me. We're in a bit of an open field so with the high winds (50 to 60 mph gusts) we are safer from falling trees and debris.  Our weather looks great for the next couple of days.   The climb to Annapolis rocks tomorrow will tax our knees but we can handle it.  Time to get my gear set up.  We ran into Hawk and Quicksand at Dahlgren.  Hawk is on his 6th thru hike, Quicksand is on his 3rd.  They are rock stars on the trail. 
Finally,  we read the rules at one of the shelters today and for the privy (outhouse) rules it said ""Restroom facilities are not overnight accommodations"".  I kid you not.  Privies are beyond nasty.  I posted the picture of the rules on this entry.  While the trail is a great place with lots of awesome people I guess some folks are beyond help.  Yuck.

Boneless Thighs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636032,"Last night's wind was a tad scary.  We could hear trees coming down but we were fairly safe where we were.  Not 100% though.  Temps stayed cool with wind chills in the 30s so we had our heavy coats on.   It was good sleeping though.  The hike today was great with overall cooler temps and a breeze most of the day.  We went by the Washington monument in Boonsboro,  Maryland early in the morning and that's always a beautiful spot.  We had a mix of smooth,  easy trail heading to Annapolis Rocks and some really awful rocky sections to the north.  Annapolis Rocks is a very popular hike with the folks around here so it's crowded on the weekends.  When the trail gets rocky you have to slooow way down and very carefully choose your footing.  With a backpack on once you start falling you are out of luck.  That extra weight makes it harder to catch yourself.   That's one big reason for the trekking poles we use.  So far we've had no mishaps.   We're tenting again tonight near the Ensign Cowall shelter.  Not great spots but we'll sleep OK.   Today was about 14 miles so we're tired.  I feel like I'm getting my trail legs and will be able to do 15 to 20 in a week or so.   Sunday looks to be nice but hot and I believe Monday may be our first truly rainy day.  We'll see. Still having fun!","Dahlgren backpacker campground

Boneless Thighs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636144,"We finished Maryland today!!  Trying to tent camp at the Ensign Cowall shelter was an exercise in futility.   Miles and I got the only 2 tent pads but we still rolled downhill.   Several other hikers showed up close to dark and slept on the rocks.  A family (the Trout family) were there and had hiked from Georgia.  6 or 7 of them kids and all very nice. They are incredible hikers and very nice.  We got up and out by 7:30 am again so things were cooler.   After an hour or so we got hot.  Temps were over 80 today so we were sweating.  Again today we had some very rocky trail.   We have the big rock trails like I showed yesterday and the small rock trails that will twist your ankles a hundred times a day.  Not sure which is harder.   Our knees are screaming.   
We saw a couple of good sized snakes today (pictures in the picture section).  Our excitement today was when Girl Friday (Miles' wife) met us at the PenMar park to resupply us.  She also brought lunch and dinner.   We ate like kings - we each had a beer too.  She had enough that 2 other thru hikers (Saltlick and Crone) were able to share in the feast.   My lovely wife sent along some Apple cake too.  Thanks honey!  I'll be eating that later tonight or for breakfast.  After eating and gathering food supplies for our next leg to Boiling Springs,  Pennsylvania we did what's called a slack pack section.  Girl Friday took our packs up the road and allowed us to do a 3 mile section packless.   No - it's not cheating :) .  She hiked into the shelter and sat with us while we had more awesome food.  Baked potatoes and sausages.  We ate with hiker ""Wildcard"" and his German Shepherd ""Ace"" and Beau from Jacksonville,  FL (no trail name yet).  The tent sites are not great but we'll still sleep well.   Rain is coming tomorrow.   Not sure what our plans are yet to deal with thunderstorms.   Oh joy.

Boneless Thighs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636205,"We went to sleep (or tried to) to the sound of what we think was dueling Whippoorwills.  They sang past dark and again starting sometime after 4 am this morning.   All around us and quite loud.  Then the showers started.  I was lucky to get my gear stowed before it got too wet.  Miles was not so lucky.   We cooked and ate in the shelter and then took off.  
The others there decided to take zero days.  A zero day is a rest/resupply day with 0 miles.  It's a misnomer because often you're doing miles around town just to get your chores done.  A Nero day is a near zero day.  Hike into town or a shelter and call it quits.  
We stopped around 1 pm at the Rocky Mountain shelter.   Rocky Mountain shelter is really 2 small shelters.  Often these are designated for snorers and non-snorers.  We're hoping we have one to ourselves.   Water was a walk all the way down the mountain.   Yikes. 
Today is not really a Nero day for us since 10 miles is still pretty good for us.  We would have done more but the rain was supposed to turn to T'storms.   This shelter was in the right spot so here we are.
The hiking today was generally easier with fewer rocks.  The climbs weren't as bad and water was easy to find.  Chimney Rocks was a highlight scenery wise but every mile has great scenery of some sort.  I feel like my legs are getting stronger and the knees were better today.   That's surprising since we went from empty food bags to 10 pounds of food during  yesterday's resupply.   I have to attribute our renewed energy to all the great food and cake we ate yesterday.   I guarantee we burned it all off today.
It feels like our temps are dropping.   More rain is predicted for this week but we'll get some miles in regardless.   I think it's time for a mid-afternoon nap!Dinner tonight was Ramen with dehydrated green beans and Chipotle tuna.  Pretty darn good.

And those Star Wars fans out there,  happy Star Wars day!  May the 4th be with you.
Coming out of the Rocky Mountain shelters was a real climb.  Only 0.3 miles but straight up.  With last night's rain things were slick and Miles bruised a shin pretty good.   Hopefully it gets better fast.   The trail was relatively smooth and largely on the ridge so we had a nice breeze.   
In Caledonia State park we took a break with FourLo and had a snack and bathed a bit in the very cold stream.  Heading north from the park we had over a 1000 foot climb.  All sweaty again fast.  The trail was good though so we made it to Birch Run shelter by 2 something.   I did some laundry near the stream (Dr.  Bronner's biodegradable soap in a baggie with clothes, shake it up).  Then I put on my rain skirt and hopped in as far as possible.   It was COLD.  Felt good to be clean.  
Given that we are supposed to have T'storms again tonight we stayed in the shelter again.   Just me and Miles so it should have been quiet.  The rain started in the morning and along with the Whippoorwills calling all night it wasn't as quiet as we'd hoped.   
We camped with FourLo and Chef tonight.   Chef is a doctor from Charlottesville,  VA and was fun to talk to.  We both have knowledge of the Bath County,  VA area.  Hopefully we'll cross paths with him again.   We got out early in the morning in the rain.

Boneless Thighs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636378,"We started the day today with rain.  A slow drizzle that was just enough to get you wet no matter what kind of rain gear you have on.  Once we got a few miles from the Tom's Run shelter we looked west and saw very dark clouds.   Before we knew it the heavens opened up.   For the next hour plus we hiked in a deluge.  Water several inches deep flowing down the trail and puddles deeper than that.  And it got cold.  Upon arriving at Tom's Run shelter we had a snack, wrung out our shirts and planned what was next.  I decided to finish the 9 miles into Pine Grove by lunch and hunker down at the General store.  Others that were with us stayed there for a while waiting for the rain to stop.  By the time I got to the General store (about the size of my living room at home) the sun had come out and it was beautiful.   I hung out on the porch , dried my feet and some gear out and changed clothes.  I ate a Hiker burger and large fries.  It's an embarrassing amount of calories with a burger,  bacon, egg and avocado slice.  I ate it all and the fries.  Some intermittent sprinkles kept us there longer than planned but gave us time to catch up on some stuff.  Afterwards we hiked another 2 plus miles to a stealth campsite on the mountain up from the park.   A stealth site is not a shelter but just a flat or semi flat site where a tent or 2 will fit. FourLo is still hanging with us and is good to chat with.  Chef decided to take a night in the Ironmasters Hostel in the park to dry out.It is supposed to be colder tonight but hopefully the rain stays away.Still having fun!","Birch Run shelter

We started hiking around 6:30 with temperatures in the low 40s.  Standing around at that temperature was chilly but for hiking it was perfect.   Few clouds and low humidity made it ideal.  
As you can see from the pictures,  we made a quick side trip to the Green Mountain General Store which is a popular hiker spot.  It's a small store with some great deli sandwiches and very hiker friendly.   Great folks.  We ate a late breakfast there and grabbed takeout subs for lunch/dinner.   Much like yesterday's Hiker Burger, there's no way I can eat anything more today after my sub.  No cooking for us tonight.  Why am I carrying all this food in my pack?  We met ""Flash"" today at the store.  He's doing a SOBO (South Bound) flip flop hike and started at the New York/Connecticut border.  
From all the ""civilized"" food we've eaten the last couple of days it may seem like we're passing a restaurant or deli all the time.   Honestly I think we saw 6 people today including the folks working in the Green Mountain General Store.   On weekdays the trail is very sparsely populated.  
We have to take advantage of every calorie source that we can find out here.  Just wait 'til the cicadas start popping out of the ground.   We won't need to resupply as often.   A little olive oil and Old Bay...yum.
Our goal today was the Alec Kennedy shelter area about 4 miles south of Boiling Springs.   The tent sites are great and close to a brook for water and a quick bath.  Gotta smell decent for our lovely wives tomorrow!   (Looking forward to seeing you honey! )
Tomorrow we'll resupply in Boiling Springs and attempt our longest day so far.  We're heading for the Darlington Shelter about 15 miles north of Boiling Springs which would make for a 19 mile day.  Since we have the opportunity we plan on slack packing for a big chunk of the middle of the hike.Sorry for ruining anyone's dinner with the picture of me getting ready for a bath in my rain skirt the other day.  Just be thankful that I don't plan to participate in National Hike Naked Day.  It's a thing...  Yikes.""June 21 is the longest day of the year, the start to summer and … National Naked Hiking Day.

Boneless Thighs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636529,"Today was a big day for Miles and me.  Our wonderful wives met us in Boiling Springs for a visit and some breakfast with coffee,  lunch, and dinner (with a beer).  Miles wife also slack packed us for about 12 of our 19 miles today.   That's really what allowed us to hit the mileage we did today.   
Our weather was nice until sometime after lunch.  The rain began slowly and ramped up to a steady light rain when we arrived at the shelter.   I arrived 30 minutes or so ahead of Miles and grabbed the last bunk in the shelter.   He chose a tent over the shelter floor.  I'll give him the bunk next time.
The terrain today started with woods,  rocks and hills.  Just south of Boiling Springs the trail comes out of the woods and into farm fields.   A nice change.  After our resupply we dumped our packs and headed north into more farm fields.   Slack packing and flat terrain made us feel light as a feather.   Girl Friday met us at the closest cross road with our packs and dinner.   Up the hill to Darlington Shelter we went.  I was soaked more from sweat than rain.   Rain gear often is there more to keep you warm than anything else.   If you're hiking hard the sweat gets you as wet as if you were wearing no rain gear.
This shelter is not as nice as others we've seen but the folks you meet are really cool.  Laurel and Emerald (young women hiking NOBO), MASH, Rear View and Mike.  MASH and Rear View were with us last night too.  MASHs name comes from his ability to set up camp fast like a MASH unit.  Rear View apparently is usually in the rear view mirror. We have plans to hike 11 miles into Duncannon and stay in the trail famous Doyle hotel.  A hot shower will be so nice.

Boneless Thighs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636611,"We started today at the Darlington Shelter with temperatures in the mid 30s.  The rain had stopped sometime overnight and the sun was shining.   It was cold enough that everyone was way down in their bags and didn't want to get out.   Miles and I wanted to get to Duncannon at a reasonable time and try to beat the worst of the rain predicted for today so we got moving at 7.
The trail down from the shelter wasn't bad and opened up to a few miles of beautiful farm fields.   The trail through the fields soaked our shoes and pant legs though.  At some point we started to do some serious climbing and the trail got rocky.  Pennsylvania is infamous for their rocky AT.  It's nicknamed Rocksylvania.   
When I say we did some climbing please understand that climbs on this part of the trail are nothing compared to what we will deal with later.  1000 feet over the course of a mile or two seems hard now.  Later on we'll be climbing 4 to 5000 feet over a distance of 5 or so miles.  We go over 6000 feet in North Carolina's Clingman's Dome (6,643 ft) as well as New Hampshire's Mount Washington.   That's some climbing.  Here's a link to other interesting AT facts.  If I'd read this first I'm not sure I'd be out here.   https://www.rei.com/blog/hike/...
We finished the day today with only sprinkles and none of the heavy rain we thought we might see.    After our arrival at the Doyle Hotel it let loose for a while.  Good timing.  
The Doyle is a very inexpensive, very old, run down hotel with the basics.   Room indoors with bathrooms in the hall.   Better than we're used to on the trail so it's great.   Plus lots of hikers to swap stories and information with.  Hikers like to rough it I guess.   The burgers are awesome too!  We walked around town, picked up a couple of food items for the next leg and grabbed a pizza for dinner.
MASH and Rear View are here as well and I think we will be on a similar schedule for the next few days.   Great guys and strong hikers.
After we all grab breakfast at 7 tomorrow we'll head uphill towards our goal of Peter's Mtn Shelter.  Only a 10 mile day but rain is again predicted for the afternoon and we're tired of being moist all the time.   I hate the word moist.  Makes my skin crawl.

Miles and I had a better than expected time in the Doyle Hotel last night.   We hit Sorrento's down the street for pizza which was a welcome break from our diet of burgers and processed meat during our off trail meals.  We were supposed to have a beer with some other hikers at the hotel bar but it closed by 6:30.  Who does that?   Well, they run the Doyle the way they want and more power to them. 
This morning we basically had all of the thru hikers from the Doyle in Goodies Restaurant across the street.   Breakfast was incredible and reasonably priced.   Nobody got it but they had a Mountain pie as a special.   French toast with apples in between.   Yum!
Afterwards we grabbed our gear and headed north out of town.   First we crossed the Juniata River and immediately after crossed the Susquehanna.   Weather was cool, upper 30s,  with rain expected mid day.   Our goal was to do the 11 miles to get to the Peter's Mountain shelter before the worst of the rain.   It's a large shelter with two floors.   With the rain predicted to last thru the night we wanted to hang with everyone in the shelter.   We'll have plenty of time over the next few months to tent camp.   Tenting is sketchy around here because of the rocky terrain so sometimes there just isn't a good spot to set up.  Many folks use hammocks and a tarp just because of that.
Several nice views were kind of socked in by the weather but we still could see some of the farm fields and rivers below.   With the cool weather we didn't get to see any of the resident rattlesnakes and I think Miles was AOK with that.  I was looking under every rock to see if I could find one for a picture.   I've never seen so much poison ivy as I did today.  It was everywhere growing on both sides of the trail 2 or 3 feet high.   At one point we had to cross over a downed log with multiple large furry vines on it.  You couldn't straddle it because,  well you can imagine.   We had to carefully step up onto the log and precariously step down.  And it was raining and slippery.  
It was cold and very nice to arrive at the shelter and get warm, dry clothes on.  Temps never got above the mid 40s and our fingers stopped working by about 1 pm.  Tonight we are with Greg (dad) and Mallory (daughter) - no trail names yet, Emerald,  MASH and Rear View, 99, and Colgate (his sleeping bag looks like a tube of Colgate).  Gonna be a hopping place tonight - NOT.

It was a good group of people to hang around with.   Morning was still cool (mid 40s), windy and foggy but I got out by 6:20 since I ate a cold breakfast.   Miles hung back to eat hot food and coffee.  Our plan A was to meet at the Yellow Springs tenting site to see whether we wanted to stay or move on.  I never saw him again until he made it into the Yellow Springs tent campers site about 1:30.  Since it was early we decided to do another 4.5 miles to the next shelter.   Mostly we see each other off and on during the day but not today.   That's the way some days are on the trail.   There are lots of people behind us to help out in an emergency and today we mostly had decent cell service.  Of course not tonight so I can't post this entry until tomorrow.  The hike today was a mix of rocky and semi-rocky terrain along with some very smooth trails.   It was cool all day and good hiking weather.  Finally around  2 pm we saw THE SUN.  Boy did it feel good.  Not much interesting happened on the trail.  I saw some deer tracks but not any other wildlife besides birds.  I’m sure we’ll feel every one of those 18 miles tomorrow.  We’ll be tenting near the shelter and close to a nice stream for water and background noise.  Good sleeping tonight!I'd like to thank my dear friend Wiggy for letting me read his copy of  ""Pappyland"" by Wright Thompson.   It's a book about Julian Van Winkle III and his family as much as it is about whiskey.  Success and failure, loss and perseverance.   All things we'll experience out here.  In the book Mr. Thompson references several quotes by Kentucky monk and philosopher Thomas Merton (just in case you thought all philosopher monks had to come from Tibet).  A number of these quotes resonated with me and I suspect will with many that have been or are now on the trail (any trail, not just the AT):""We are so obsessed with doing that we have no time and no imagination left for being""""Do everything to avoid the noise and the business of men""""Be glad if you can keep beyond the reach of their radios"" - I guess tonight I truly am 'beyond the reach' as I have no cell coverage.Now I have no idea if I've taken these quotes out of context or if they were truly meant to be taken the way I took them.   Doesn't matter to me.  An extended thru hike like this forces you to focus on the basics and be happy with a few simple things...like that sunshine today. MASH and Rear View are here as well helping me and Miles enjoy the evening.  They have proved to be great hiking companions the last few days.  Lots of fun conversations.  Still having fun!","Peter's Mountain shelter

Boneless Thighs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636804,"Our tent site last night was great.  Flat space for our tents and a nice fire pit.  Good sleeping.   The hike today started with an interesting section.   Beavers have built a dam that's flooded the trail for about 100 yards.  There's a detour that's about 1.6 miles but we wanted to try to go through the beaver pond.   We put our ""camp"" shoes (basically sandals) on and walked through the super cold water.  Nobody fell in and it was pretty funny.  The water felt good on our sore ankles.  
We really had a decently easy hiking day from a climbing standpoint but one section I thought was the steepest we'd done yet.  There were some seriously rocky sections today that were real ankle busters.  No incidents occurred so that's good.   
We did have one slight mishap though.   At some point MASH and I were hiking ahead and stopped to make sure Miles and Rearview were coming.   We waited and waited and no one came along.  I went back to the bottom of the hill and realized that they had missed a turn and kept going straight along a fire road downhill.   They did easily a mile down before they realized they needed to come back up.  Painful.  The word is that , and I quote, ""we were not lost, we were creating content for your TrailJournals entry tonight"".
We started and completed our day in the sunshine.  And then had a sprinkle of course.

Boneless Thighs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636905,"Today was a beautiful day weather wise but our hardest hiking day yet.  We're gonna be sore tonight and probably in the morning.  
After a couple of miles hiking out we connected with my trail angel wife Sue where she provided us with coffee, breakfast sandwiches,  oranges and some other necessities.   She slipped me some ""beverages"" to take along as a treat for the crew we're hiking with.  Today was probably not the day to be carrying extra weight but it was nice to surprise the guys at camp.
The trail today was typical Pennsylvania rocks.  Big rocks, little rocks... real ankle busters.   Luckily there was some smooth flat dirt trail in between to give our legs a break.  Several pretty views along the ridge were nice diversions from looking at rocks.
At one point MASH and I missed a white blaze and followed the wrong path.  Rearview allowed us to go a bit before he corrected us.  He called it ""a teachable moment"" since we had teased him some about the detour he and Miles took yesterday.   We agreed and humbly took our lumps.  I have to document it for full disclosure. 
On our way into our campsite tonight we saw a sign for trail magic 0.2 miles down a dirt road provided in the morning by the Leapfrog Cafe.  ""Fresh Ground"" is the trail name of the gentleman and he's famous for providing trail magic up and down the trail from Georgia up.  We're hoping to get there for some breakfast. 
It's supposed to be colder tonight than it's been the last few nights.   Mid to upper 30s ought to be good sleeping again.   Who am I kidding?   We sleep good every night.  Some of the hikers that have been out for months already are doing 25 miles or more a day.  Makes me hurt just thinking about it.   We'll be there sometime.   Maybe.

Boneless Thighs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636983,"Today started as a great day.  We were treated to trail magic from the famous (on the AT at least)  ""Fresh Grounds"".  His mobile Leapfrog Cafe moves up the trail with the bubble of thru hikers and he feeds them.  This morning we were treated to blueberry pancakes, bacon, chicken, coffee,  and potatoes.   It wasn't all you could eat but we got enough.   So generous.   He would not take any money.
We hiked 9 plus miles into Port Clinton by lunchtime and there he was again!   Roaster chickens,  fruit,  Gatorade,  sodas, and cupcakes.   There must have been 15 hikers there counting us.  A genuinely great guy. 
We had hoped that we might score a room at the local Microtel hotel tonight and take a NERO but it was not to be.   They've been full for days.  We need a full day off and a shower.  Our hiking friend Rearview graciously offered us a ride to the Allentown KOA campground he was going to with his wife and MASH for a zero day but we decided to keep hiking and stay at the Blue Rocks Family campground.   This was a very bad idea.   First we had to hike another 6 miles from Port Clinton on already sore legs.  Then the side trail from the AT to the campground was absolutely horrible.   Long, steep, and not maintained at all.  When we got here the place was so large that I had to rent a golf cart just so we could get around.   That ended up costing more than the site.   The sites here are pretty bad for tents too.  It's really mostly an RV park it looks like.   Oh well.   We've decided that we'll take a zero day tomorrow to try and recover from the last couple weeks.   The hot shower was nice.
I had my first almost injury today.   It's to be expected out here.  Walking the rocky trail I stepped on a rock that wobbled and I did a slow forward fall onto the rocks.  Luckily the upper body work I've done allowed me to catch myself before hitting too hard.  It's harder than you think with a 28 pound backpack pushing you down.   No injury at all.

Boneless Thighs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636998,"Today I'll be entering slowly over the course of the day .
Today is a zero day at the Blue Rocks Family campground.   The folks who work here have been very nice.  That being said,  I have absolutely no idea why the AWOL guide or the Guthook app show this as a hiker campground.   The blue blazed trail to get here was horribly maintained with dozens of trees across it.  The distance around camp make it impractical to easily do what you need and the availability of campground food and supplies is limited to weekends.  The showers were hot.  A great place if you have an RV, no question about it.   Not for AT hikers.
Since I have more time today I can type a longer entry covering some things that I know folks are curious about.   
Trail Names
Somewhere in the past somebody on the trail decided that it would be fun to give nicknames to hikers.  Who knows why but they can be serious or humorous,  meaningful or whimsical.   
Obviously ""Boneless Thighs"" is meant to make you chuckle a bit and so far it has worked.   It's also a reflection of the fact that my family reuses ziploc bags at home.   Several of the bags I am waterproofing things with on the hike are labeled ""Boneless Thighs"".  Plus it's certainly indicates how my legs feel at the end of a climb.
""Miles"" name came about because of the many tens of thousands of miles run over the course of his running career.   Also there's a tie in to one of our Boy Scout high adventure trips in Yellowstone where the response to ""How much farther do we have to go?"" was always ""2 more miles, guys.  2 more miles"".
Bathroom techniques 
Most of this I'll leave for you to Google on your own.  A quick search of ""trail bathroom techniques"" results in everything from camp trowels to the ""orangutan hang"".  Suffice it to say that you need strong thigh muscles and good balance or bad things happen.
Food and utensils 
Everyone on the trail has different limits for their tolerance of filth.  When food falls on the ground it seems that whether it gets left or picked up and eaten depends upon the weight of the item and how hard you worked hauling it around.  A potato chip gets left for the chipmunks but a Fig Newton will be eaten.   Our spork (spoon/ fork combination)  will be used for days without a real cleaning and all we do is lick it off after every meal.  Imagine after dinner licking everything off and just putting it back in the drawer.   The dishwasher companies would go out of business.  If I want to clean things up a bit I'll simply put it in the boiling water I'm using to prepare my dinner.
Electronics
Our cellphone is a multi use tool out here.   It's an emergency tool, our contact with home, a GPS, and our way to plan.  We use the Guthook app to help us see where we are going,  how far the next water or decent tent site/ shelter is, road crossings and to see what hiker comments have been made about all of them.  I'm not a social media guy as many of you know (I really have no need to hear about someone's latest trip to Starbucks) but this is a useful way to get current information about conditions on the trail.  
If you have anything in particular that you'd like to know more about put your questions in as a guest entry and I'll try to elaborate as time allows.
Our rest day today is going well with some laundry,  electronics recharged and gear dried.  Hopefully the muscles are getting a good rest.I got to Skype with Sue and my son Joe today which was great.   Technology can be wonderful.   Also a big thanks to my son Jacob today for my fantastic dinner!  A super birthday and Christmas gift was dinners on the trail.   Tonight was salad,  wings and a cheesesteak sub.   Sooo good.  Doordash delivered them from a local restaurant.   My first time using Doordash and it was pretty easy.

Boneless Thighs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637084,"Our zero day seems to have helped our legs.  Getting up the hill out of the campground was easier than coming down.   We hit some rockiness for the first few miles but past Pulpit rock and Pinnacle rock the trail smoothed out and was pretty much a fire road.   I was wondering why there were lots of day hikers out today and then I realized it's Saturday.   Time isn't much of an issue out here. 
We had the very good fortune to meet Baloo and a friend on the trail with a backpack full of cold beer and Gatorade.   He was an awesome trail angel to actually carry his magic that far up the mountain.  Even at 9:30 am that cold beer was good and the rocks magically disappeared!   Thanks Baloo!
Today we're planning on rejoining MASH  and Rearview who started back at Port Clinton.   They had a pretty long day but we hiked 8.3 miles on the trail.   The hike up out of the campground was over a mile but that doesn't count.  A light day for us but it allowed us to rejoin Rearview and MASH.   We enjoy hiking with these guys so it was good to see them again.  
Folks who came behind us were hiking in warmer temperatures and saw some rattlesnakes but we didn't.   Although I would have liked to see some I didn't want to have any close encounters.
The next couple days will be hard I think.   On Monday we will be hiking up from Lehigh gap which is a very steep,  very rocky climb.   Supposedly it requires some hands on climbing.   We'll see.   It's going to be interesting. Here is a new thing I'm trying.   I would like to be able to share some short videos so here is my YouTube channel link.  Some of the videos there are hiking related.   All the other ones are from my son's robotics competitions in high school.https://youtube.com/channel/UC...

Boneless Thighs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637210,"We had a great tent site at the Eckville shelter but some rain in the middle of the night made everything damp when we packed up.   The nighttime temps are going up a bit so we're able to start our hiking with no coat or long pants.
The day started with some climbing but not too bad.   We hit rocky trail pretty early and kept it for much of our hike.  It doesn't matter how hard you concentrate,  the occasional step ends up in the wrong place and you twist a knee or ankle.   Sometimes the rock you step on wobbles a bit and you have to compensate.   It taxes your brain after a few hours.
We hit so many vistas that I stopped taking pictures of each one.  The best one today was on the knife edge section.   The AT goes right along a pretty sharp ridge here.  I'm not good with heights and this area made me nervous.   With 25 to 28 pounds on your back the wobble factor makes you worry about your balance.   We all made it successfully. While I didn't get a video of our traverse of the Knife Edge I tried to get one of the ridge north of it.  See on my YouTube channel. https://youtube.com/channel/UCOne surprise today was a restaurant that was right on trail right at lunchtime.   We had to stop in of course.  And I got a chicken thigh sandwich of course.  Thanks to MASH for springing for lunch!The trail was rocky up until the Bake Oven Knob shelter where we found a marginal tenting area.  While we were eating dinner Tinman came up and told us about a better area down trail but we'd already set up and at 6:30 pm it's almost bedtime.  This shelter is horrible.   Glad I'm not sleeping in it.Still having fun!","Eckville Shelter tent site

Boneless Thighs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637299,"Today was one of the harder days for me and that's surprising since we slack packed part of the day.   We started with a couple miles to a cross road where Girl Friday (Miles' wife) met us with breakfast and coffee.   An excellent break!  Then she took our packs up a few miles and met us for lunch where we found that my wonderful wife Trail Angel Sue had sent a homemade cherry pie!  Carrying our packs allowed us to slack pack up and out of the Lehigh Gap.  This was a climb we've been anticipating due to its steepness.   As we gained elevation the trees disappeared and we began climbing bare rocks.  Hand over hand climbing was the only way to get up this section.  I just didn't look back or down until I had a good firm footing.  The view of the valley was great.  I was a little nervous but the handholds were fine.  MASH carried a full pack (he's a purist!) but the rest of us did day packs.  
When we met back up with Girl Friday to get our packs we ate some more, had a beer and did a resupply.  We ate the rest of the pie here too except we saved one piece for hiker Sluggo who we've gotten to know over the past couple days.  Resupply time is tough because that's when our packs are heaviest.  Combine that with the fact that we had to carry extra water today into camp and the last 6 plus miles were not fun.  
The last few miles into camp looked like climbers submitting Everest.  A slow plod over the rocks and through the woods with the occasional exclamation as an ankle was twisted.  The weather was great and the trail magic made it a greater.  A fantastic day all in all but we're some tired campers tonight. Videos are at https://youtube.com/channel/UC

Boneless Thighs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637385,"Today started about 7 am with cool, clear weather.  We had carried all our water the last 6 miles into camp and now needed to go another 6 miles to get ""easy"" water.  Delps spring was a ways down the hill and we deemed it not worth the climb.   At the Leroy Smith shelter we stopped for a rest and found the spring 0.3 miles down the hill with a trickle still flowing.   The water was good though.   There are sections coming up that have little water so we'll have to carry more.  
We only saw one person all day today on the trail.   He was an 82 year old man who had a pretty large pack.  He wasn't going long distances but seemed to be enjoying himself.
After our lunch break we decided that it might be best to have a shorter day today to help with distances, water, and camping spots over the next few days.   With that in mind we took the time to hike a short distance into Wind Gap and get some ice cream from the local Turkey Hill gas station.   I got a small pizza too for 2nd lunch.  We wanted to go to Sweet Nannies ice cream shop but they didn't open until 3 pm.  Bummer.  
The climb out of Wind Gap was brutal and I think we all are pretty tired of the rocks in Pennsylvania.   Once again I've included a video showing what it's like walking on these rocky sections.  It's slow,  tedious and takes all of your brainpower to focus on walking for hours without really twisting your ankle.  Or should I say without twisting your ankle to the point of injury.   My ankles get twisted a hundred times a day.   Vitamin I (Ibuprofen) has been the solution 3 or 4 times this trip. 
We have to conserve water tonight because our next water is over 5 miles away in the morning.   Oh for a big glass of lemonade.   The temperature was in the 80s today and we have to watch each other for dehydration.  Sadly today was the coolest we're going to see for a while if you can believe the weather report. 
We're getting excited about completing Pennsylvania tomorrow.   The rocks don't immediately stop in New Jersey but soon.

Today started with rocky trail and it stayed that way for many hours.  It's hard to get miles in on trail like that.   The group decided that we badly needed to clean up so stopping for the night at the Church of the Mountain hostel in Delaware Water Gap, Pennsylvania made sense.   It's run by the Presbyterian church and provides showers,  a few bunks and a small tent site which is where we are staying.   It's good to be clean. 
When we started hiking today we immediately met up with Sluggo who we met a few days ago.   He hiked with us until he had to stop and plan for an upcoming zero day. 
Water was scarce on this section so we continue to carry heavy packs with more water than normal.   We ran into one spot with multiple rattlesnakes on one of the rocky ridges.   Sluggo heard them after we had all passed them.  I went back to try for a picture. 
The day was largely uneventful after that but was hard because of the rocks and 85 degree temps.   The rocks continue into New Jersey but hopefully not too far.  We debate what would be the best trail shoes for this type of trail.   Big, heavy boots would help but you just can't pick them up over and over for 8 hours a day for weeks.  We go with much lighter boots or trail runners that are lighter but have less support.  Painful for your feet.  Some people say that they hike the AT barefoot.   I just can't believe it. 
After she is done with work, Rearview's wife is going to generously pick us up and take us wherever we need to go here in town.   Food,  resupply,  etc.  Very nice!
We're also getting all electronics charged up here.  Not a problem for folks who hiked the AT in the early days.
Dinner tonight in town was awesome thanks to Rearviews wife coming to get us.  She and their dog Ruby made my day for sure.We finally met up with the Sutton family,  Hothands (dad), Straps (mom) and Little Man (5 year old son).  They've been on the trail since Springer Mountain,  GA.   Impressive!   Very nice folks and Little Man seems to be really enjoying himself.   I am impressed by his amazing hiking capabilities.

Sadly the rocks didn't magically disappear but things were marginally better.  Our first climb was along a beautiful trout stream.   Multiple ups and downs led us to some ridges with nice overlooks.  I believe it was Raccoon ridge that had a great 360 degree view.  See my video on YouTube. 
We had lunch at a camp called the Mohican Outdoor Center pretty close to the trail.   Then we headed towards the Beaver pond.   We saw a couple of beavers and a lodge and dam.  Pretty cool.  We had been warned that the water there was not the best so we loaded up before.   More water means heavier packs.  1 liter = 2.2 pounds and I carried 3 liters into camp.   And afternoon is when we are the most tired.  You have to be careful not to drag your feet and fall.  A nice breeze is blowing in so we're cooling off finally.   Sleep will come early tonight.

Tonight we'll kick back,  do some laundry,  eat good food and relax.   When we get back on the trail tomorrow we'll have a shorter day probably to the next shelter north of here.
As for the title of this day, when we finished hiking and sat down with a cold Yuengling, Miles stated emphatically ""I am a fan of the chair"".   This may not be obvious to most of you but when you've been without a chair for a few days or weeks you realize how much you miss them.  Sitting on the ground,  a log or rock really can't compare to a nice chair.  Add to it the fact that we're all losing weight and our butts have no more padding and that makes the simple padded chair the single most important invention man has created.  Next to the refrigeration that made my beer cold.
As a side note - we really have not hit 300 miles yet.  One of my entries was probably total miles for the day and not just trail miles and so we will not be hitting 300 miles until tomorrow. Videos are at https://youtube.com/channel/UC

Boneless Thighs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637648,"We got a late start today as planned.   Rather than a true Zero day we did 2 short days in a row.   Our hotel was acceptable last night.  Not great by any stretch of the imagination.   About the best thing anyone said about it was Rearview's comment after he read the reviews ""Of all the places with black mold this was the best"".  I think I blew Gatorade out my nose I laughed so hard.
Before we started hiking we made lodging arrangements in Fort Montgomery, NY for next Thursday night.  Figuring that it was close to Memorial Day we'd better get something locked in.   
An addendum to yesterdays entry - I can't thank Rearview's wife Monica enough for hauling our dirty selves around town to get our chores done.   She's a wonderful person!   Ruby the wonder Golden Retriever gives us post trail therapy.
It was noon before we put the packs on.  Within 100 yards we crossed a parking lot and there's a great little RV with 2 gentlemen and a great trail magic setup.  Drinks,  grilled hot dogs, and other snacks.   They're the husbands of hikers Gigi and Gidget who are on the trail now.  Such generosity.   I was glad we had not had lunch. 
We hiked less than 9 miles today in less than 5 hours.   A long break at the highest point in NJ was a shady treat because there was a pavilion.   We were seeing more than the average number of hikers today so that means it is Saturday.   If I didn't have a phone I'd have no idea what day it was.   Crazy how you lose track of time out here.

Boneless Thighs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637727,"Today may be the last slack packing we do for a while.   Girl Friday (Miles' wife) came up with their great friends Karen and Tom and fed us, reprovisioned us and slack packed us (not MASH) for all but about a mile of our 19.5 mile total.  They hiked some with us as well.  It was nice getting to know them.   A great breakfast with good coffee was delivered to a trail parking lot and lunch snacks and later dinner.   It truly made the day easy.  Of course it would have been easier if we hadn't had to hike almost 20 miles.  By the way,  I think MASH is hooked on Old Bay cheese curls now!
Our day went really well with hot but breezy weather.   Lots of day hikers were out.   I have to correct something I said in yesterday's entry.  I thought we went over the NJ high point yesterday but we hit that today.   Miles and I walked an extra mile round trip up a side trail to the 220 foot obelisk built in 1930 as a war memorial.  MASH and Rearview would have but thought that the AT would take them there.   It's odd that it didn't.   Pretty views all around but the high temperatures are making things hazy.
The trail today took us through mature forest with many old stone walls.   Property boundaries or old farm field walls?  Not sure.  Then we emerged from the forest into open,  high grass fields.   Very pretty but full of ticks.  We ran into a snapping turtle that seemed to be guarding the trail.   Very aggressive.   Some great wildflowers too.  We went through several areas of swampy terrain that required long sections of decking to keep the hikers out of the muck.  Good balance was a must.  
After our last visit with Girl Friday,  Tom and Karen we headed up the mountain to the shelter area where we're spending the night.   Here in NJ AT hikers are required to stay in the shelter areas so we're trying to follow the rules. 
After a lunchtime picture today my wife Sue commented that I'm looking thinner.   I think she said ""emaciated"".  I think that I'm just getting back to my college weight.  We'll see.   I feel great after today's hike so that's good.   
The bugs have been getting worse recently.  We could use a good frost.  
One comment about last night's shelter site.  The privy there was painted with the pinkest paint I've ever seen.   Very bright inside.   You've gotta love it.   I included a picture in the picture section. Another thing I think I forgot to mention from a couple of days ago.   We passed by a fire tower that was manned and, although not generally allowed,  the ranger invited us up.  We couldn't go into the top room where he was but going up was neat and scary.  It seemed a bit rickety even though it's sturdy I'm sure.   Great views.
A final note on a more serious topic.   MASH's home in South Dakota was hit by a tornado today and sustained some damage.   Fortunately no one was hurt.  It sounds like he has friends that will help him deal with things while he's out here.  Our thoughts are with you Lisa and Ember.

Boneless Thighs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637800,"Today was a planned short day as a follow-up to our long day yesterday.   I felt like it was harder than it should have been.   My legs just wanted to rebel.  Our site last night was pretty nice except for the bugs.  The stiff breeze mostly took care of them except for the very strongest fliers who also happened to be the hungriest ones.  Sort of like hikers I guess.  We camped with the Sutton family again (Dad ""Hothands"", Mom ""Straps"" and of course 5 year old ""Little Man"").  Also present were Sugarman (loves snickers bars), Sluggo and Blueberry.  In a conversation we heard them talking about camping at the Warwick drive-in tonight.   Whaaaat?  Can we really do that?   Well, sure enough we found that the gentleman who runs the Drive-in offers up part of his grassy space for free to hikers.   More on that later. 
The hike today wasn't bad for most of the day.   The flattest mile of the AT was along a super boardwalk style trail over a boggy area near the Pochuck river.  The scenery was very different from what we've seen elsewhere.   I really liked it.   Once we exited the flatlands we hit a crossroad that led to the Heaven Hill farm.  As it was time for second breakfast we all stopped by for some ice cream or otherwise caloric snack.  Everyone behind us caught up and we reveled in the cool, sunny weather while eating like our mothers never would have allowed.   When we finally extracted ourselves from Heaven Hill we headed towards the trail only to find a hotdog stand had opened up all of 50 yards away.   We didn't get far before the packs came off and Sugarman bought a round of hot dogs for us all.  Super cool.  It goes without saying that immediately after all this food we had to hike up the steepest climb we've seen in a few days.  Oh the sweat.   Glad it wasn't very hot.  Any calories I took in at the bottom of the hill were gone by the end of the climb. 
Several more smaller ups and downs and our day was done.   Nice trails with a few serious rock sections.   All in all a nice hike.  We're all in agreement that New Jersey is our favorite state so far.  Tomorrow we'll be crossing into New York.
At the Warwick turnpike crossroad we had planned to catch a local shuttle but Girl Friday was still in the area so we caught a ride to the Drive-in with her.  Our new friends Karen and Tom met us for dinner and treated us to a wonderful dinner and beer/hard cider.  Thanks to you both again!  After dinner MASH picked up the tab for dessert.   Awesome ice cream for the 2nd time today. 
So as for the Warwick drive-in,  this is the coolest.   ""Pop-pop"" has opened space up for hikers to tent for free.  He allows us to charge our equipment,  fill up water and as he says ""after the movies you can clear out the concession stand"".   Meaning of course eat whatever is leftover.   They even gave us radios so that we could hear the movie.  A great guy who does a lot for the community.  
 As I sit here waiting to watch Tom & Jerry (or one of the Saw movies - no thanks.  We're doing a lot of sleeping in the deep, dark woods) eating popcorn past dark I continue to marvel at the quirky nature of the trail.   A thru hike today is definitely not what it would have been 20 years ago.   In my mind it's better.  Much more social than I thought.   So many fun, quirky hikers and we all smell equally bad.
A follow-up on yesterday's tornado at MASH's home in South Dakota - his friends in the area showed up to take care of the big trees that were down.   Structural damage to his house was minimal and no one was hurt in his family.   Lucky!Videos are at https://youtube.com/channel/UC

Boneless Thighs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637847,"Last night at the Warwick drive-in was fun.  Although noisy when everyone left after the last movie, most of us slept ok.  Thanks again to ""Pop-pop"" for his hospitality. 
At 5:30 am I walked down to the local bagel store and got some coffee and breakfast for the gang.   By 7 our ride Mark showed up to take us back to the trail head.   Nice guy who doesn't seem to do this for the big bucks.  He was really helpful in letting us know about the businesses in the area and willing to take us there if needed. 
Back on trail we met up with Gidget and her husband at a crossroad.   You might recall our hot dog trail magic from just a couple days ago.   Gidget is the hiker wife of one of those gentlemen.   We had a good chat and then Gidget (and her puppy Sleeping Beauty in her pack) and I hiked until we reconnected with the Sutton family (Little Man).  Then the larger group we've been hiking with basically hiked together sort of all day.  You might not see anyone for hours but at certain points on the trail or times of day you may meet up again.   Today a bunch of us met up at the NJ/NY border for a group shot.  Then later at the Bellvale Farm Ice creamery where ""No Bad"" (No bad days on the trail!) picked up the tab for ice cream for a bunch of us.  Thanks No Bad!
The trail today didn't look bad on the map from an elevation change standpoint but in reality it seemed to be a lot of little ups and downs.   The rocks were huge and views spectacular.   A one spot there's an American flag on a large branch and on a clear day you may be able to see New York city.   We couldn't due to the haze.    These little ups and downs are often like steps but never built to any sort of code.  One step might be 6 inches and the next 3 feet.  It's hard on the knees and ankles in a different way from the rocks of Pennsylvania.   Less twisting and more pounding.   Multiple times we had to use hands to pull ourselves up.  One spot also required a ladder embedded into the rock to climb up a very steep section.  Fun!
We decided today to add a little to our mileage and stop at the Fitzgerald Falls making tomorrow's long day a little shorter.  Plus we could soak our feet in the cold water and wash up a bit.  That was a big plus although it's amazing how hard it is to get rid of hiker dirt with cold water. 
In our site tonight we met new friends Belch and his wife Hangin.   We're hoping to hike some with them tomorrow.   Tomorrow was planned to be 19.5 but now we only have 18.  The feet will be sore tomorrow but we have to hit our goal of Fort Montgomery by Thursday mid-day to buy supplies and get to our hotel.Videos are at https://youtube.com/channel/UC

",Fitzgerald Falls tent site,"May 25, Tue",13.50
Boneless Thighs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637964,"We started the day today with a climb alongside Fitzgerald Falls which was very pretty but didn't have much water.  It sure felt good soaking my feet in it yesterday though.   Today was our hottest day yet and, of course, we had planned on doing 18 miles.   The elevation changes we had looked at made it look like it wasn't going to be too bad a day.   Hah!  It was brutal.   There were a lot of small ups and downs over large rock areas.  The knees took a pounding coming down the hills.   Some of the climbs required you to use hands to pull yourself up and over.   One section called the Lemon Squeezer narrowed to such a tight squeeze that we had to remove our packs and push them ahead of us.   Another downhill was called Agony Grind.   Very accurate description.   Water was not plentiful so when we could get it we had to carry more than we would normally.   Sweat poured off of me in a continuous stream.   For some reason there was a white blaze on a 7 or 8 foot vertical climb with no easy way up.  Someone had written on a sign that Bill Bryson would go up that way.   Bill Bryson is the author of the book ""A walk in the woods"" which is about his attempt to hike the AT.  A movie was made from it too.  Of course I chose to go the hard way just to say I did.  I did it but I probably shouldn't have.   
After one particularly bad, brutal, horribly knee crunching downhill section I commented that I was wishing for some trail magic Gatorade.   Lo and behold a few yards later when we crossed the road there was trail angel Frank.  He not only had Gatorade (quart bottles! ) but really good homemade banana bread,  applesauce bread and zucchini bread.  We enjoyed our time spent with him.  I'm not sure I'd have made it today without his generosity.   They say ""the trail provides what you need "" and I'm beginning to believe it. 
We had chosen our distance today so that we'd have an easier day hiking into Fort Montgomery,  NY tomorrow to optimize our one night there.  About 3/4 of the way through the day we all decided that we needed 2 nights at the Holiday Inn Express.   That would give us a true Zero day on Friday and give us time to resupply.   Boy do we need it.  Others on the trail are doing the same so we'll have some company.  
In the middle of our sweaty hike Rearview and I were discussing the qualities needed to hike the trail.  Tenacity,  perseverance,  strength - both mental and physical, but we have determined that you all need to be a bit, and I'll give you the clean version, ""bat crap crazy"".
We all rolled into camp at very different times but safely before the predicted severe thunderstorms with high winds.  So far we've missed them as of 8:30.  No cell coverage here tonight so I'll submit this tomorrow sometime. 
I'll put some more video out there when I get to the hotel in Fort Montgomery.

Boneless Thighs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637986,"Last night's storms didn't materialize for us like some of the areas close by.   Some winds and a few showers but nothing dangerous luckily.  In camp we hung around preparing and eating dinner and discussing the day,  our lives, upcoming trail,  and how doggone hot it was.  Many folks chose the shelter due to the potential weather but I wanted my tent.  Better sleeping and room to spread out.   
With the short day today we did not roll out of camp until 6:30.  We had some climbs today that were interesting.   We got our first view of New York city in the distance.   At first it was very hard to see due to the haze.   At the next overlook it was clearer.  As we approached the Bear Mountain area we found there were steps cut into the rocky mountain.   This apparently had been a huge project and it has made the mountain accessible to many thousands of New York hikers.  The stepped trail took us over the top of the mountain past vending machines with coke, ice cream and fritos.  Oh, and the Perkins Memorial tower where we had views of the Hudson,  Palisades and New York city.   Then more steps down the mountain opening up to a really pretty park area by Hessian Lake.  The AT goes around the lake and over into and through the Bear Mountain zoo.  Right through the zoo.  The bears looked a bit like hikers lounging after a hard day of hiking.   
Our hotel was 1.6 miles up the road so we headed that direction.   None of us are adept at hitchhiking but that would have been nice.  Three of our friends from last night hitched a ride with no problem even though it's apparently illegal in New York.   We walked by a deli where we picked up lunch to be eaten in the AC of our hotel room.  MASH picked up a hat on the road that he thought belonged to Kindle.  Sure enough it had apparently blown off her head while she and Kitchen Sink were riding in the hitched ride.   By the time I arrived,  Miles had already gotten a shower.  We had gotten disconnected from Miles on the way down Bear Mountain and I think he had a bit more pep in his step getting to the hotel for that shower.
As I've mentioned, we're taking 2 nights off here so that we can rest our bodies and eat more.  I  started this hike at 198 pounds.   Today I weighed and am at 183.  Many people find that they cannot maintain their weight on the trail because carrying enough food to supply upwards of 6000 calories a day is nearly  impossible.   
Our rooms are nice and the hotel has an exercise room and a sauna.   Like any of us want to exercise or sweat any more.  Ha!
The forecast is for some cooler temps and rain.   Might be nice for a change.

Boneless Thighs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638043,"Besides eating and propping my feet up there is not much to write about today so thanks to my son Joe for asking about gear.   So much could be said about the gear we're carrying it could fill a book.   How we each came to choose our gear is as varied as our reasons for hiking the trail.   I've talked to just the 3 guys I'm hiking with so data is very limited.   If you are thinking about hiking seriously then find out what through hikers are using.  Hikers later in their hike are more likely to have gotten their gear dialed in.  So here's what I can give you related to backpacks,  tents, and shoes/boots with my comments on sleeping quilts.
_____
Backpacks Zpacks Arc Haul (Miles and I have this pack)I can write more about this pack since it's the one I have. This is a sil nylon pack, ""highly water resistant"" & very light but fragile compared to other ultralight packs.  In my opinion I doubt that my pack will have much life left after this through hike.   I'll be honest.   I like mine well enough but I tend to carry about 28 pounds when fully loaded (5 days of food and 2 liters of water) and the pack does funky things over 25 pounds.  The arc goes to the side in an odd sort of way.  Also,  one major design flaw needs to be resolved  before you consider buying this pack.  The carbon fiber rods that make up the frame and provide the arc fit into small woven nylon pockets at the top and bottom of the pack.  The rods will ultimately poke through the weave of the pockets rendering the ""arc"" part of this design useless and you could potentially lose a rod.  A major flaw that has existed for a while.   Fortunately this happened to me prior to the trip and I came up with a fix that I could bring along.  I've had a second pocket blow out while on the trip that I had to fix.  I won't go into details on the fix unless you are interested.  Let me know. 
I can't say if the new design for this year takes care of this issue.  I'd love to give it a try on this through hike but there is no way to try their packs without buying them.   I am not that wealthy.  
That being said,  I like the comfort and adjustability and the flaws in the pack really are exacerbated by heavier weights.  If you are shooting for a total weight (including water and food) less than or equal to 25 pounds then you should be OK.  Over 25 pounds and you start to really feel the weight.   You will need to add a water bottle pocket on your shoulder straps or a hydration sack if you want easy access to water.
Hyperlight Mountain Gear (HMG) - 2400 Southwest (MASH'S pack)He likes this pack.   Very water resistant and durable,  not very adjustable but sometimes that can be a plus.   Too many straps can make you crazy and can be just one more point of failure.  You need to add a water bottle pocket on your shoulder straps or a hydration sack if you want easy access to water.
Six moons design Minimalist 48 liter (Rearview's pack)He likes the vest feature of the straps.   Instead of straps it has a vest like feel that provides a more comfortable fit for him.  This is one of those features that you have to try on to understand.   Water resistant and durable for sure.  He likes its versatility.

Suffice it to say that there's a myriad of backpack choices out there.   REI is the go to supplier for many of us since they have a generous return policy.   Sadly this is preventing a lot of the smaller companies from getting their gear out there on the trail.   When you are spending several hundred dollars on each piece of gear you really need to try before you buy.  Within the first 200 miles on the trail Rearview had replaced his tent, sleeping bag/quilt, and trekking poles.  That isn't unusual because the trail is where you have the chance to see the gear others are using and look at it, discuss it or even try it out.  Regardless of water resistance it's my personal opinion and often recommended by the companies that you should pack inside a pack liner.  I use a Nylofume pack liner.  Super cheap but noisy like a potato chip bag!_____
TentsNote that the weights mentioned here for tents do not include the stakes needed to actually pitch them.   Those are typically bought separately except for the Big Agnes.  Stakes come in all shapes, sizes, and metals/plastics  based on what your needs are and what your budget allows. 
Zpacks - Duplex - 2 person - 2 trekking poles, 1.2 pounds (My tent).
Zpacks - Altaplex - single person - 1 trekking pole, 1 pound (MASH'S  tent).
Both the Zpacks tents are DCF fabric (also called Cuben fiber or Dyneema  - very expensive material) they are light and waterproof.  Very easy to setup which can be a big advantage in the rain.  Condensation is a potential problem due to just ok ventilation.  Vestibules are ok for shoes and stuff but probably not your pack.  I like the extra space for gear inside my tent so the extra weight is worth it for me.  At 6' 3"" I find that I cannot sit up in the Duplex very well.
Tarp tent - Stratospire Li (Miles' tent)1.8 pounds, Nice ventilation due to design allowing added air flow from below, large vestibules, longer setup time, requires 2 trekking poles.  While I have not slept in this tent I like the design and extra space.
Big Agnes - Copper spur UL 2 (Rearview's tent)No trekking poles required, self standing,  full tarp coverage,  heavier at 2.7 pounds.   Great overall tent with better usable interior space due to the frame.   He loves this tent._____
Boots/ Shoes Note - waterproof vs non-waterproof - a huge debate over this.   Waterproof will keep your feet dry in some conditions but folks say any wetness (sweat, rain, stream crossings, dewy grass) that does get in will not dry fast.  Non-waterproof shoes dry faster but of course get wet faster too.  Everyone seems to end up needing better cushioning inserts than what comes with their shoes originally.   Superfeet or Oboz from REI are popular.   I swear by 2 sock layers.  Thin tight silk socks first and then wool on top.  Darn tough socks rock, have a lifetime guarantee and there are sock exchange locations along the trail if needed.   
Altra Lone Peak 4.5 (my shoes)These ""trailrunner"" shoes require getting used to.   Zero drop from back to front and wide toe box are not what I was used to.   I like them but I have to say that they aren't holding up well through the rocky sections of Pennsylvania,  New Jersey and New York.   I nearly blew through the front of a pair with less than 100 miles on them coming northbound on a steep downhill into Port Clinton, Pennsylvania.  A serious lack of padding causes the rocks to hurt your feet and no ankle support.  I've got a stiffer insert in mine that has allowed me to survive.  I'm hoping that they will shine on some less rocky sections.   I will say though that they are very light and I think my legs may be less tired than if I was wearing my Merrill Castle Rock shoes.  If I had it to do over again I would wear my Merrills in Pennsylvania.   The rocks require more robust shoes with ankle protection in my opinion.  Altra has a new 5.0 model.   Not sure if they will be longer lasting.  I'd love to try them.   REI sells them so you can try them and return them if you aren't happy.
Salomon X Ultra 3 Low Aero (Miles' shoes) He's been happy with the support and durability.   Good for narrow feet.  REI sells them so you can try them and return them if you aren't happy.
MerrillMoab 2 mid height (MASH'S shoes) - not waterproof.   Very durable,  good price, readily available,  MASH wished he had more ankle support.  REI sells them so you can try them and return them if you aren't happy.
Salomon - not sure of make (Rearview's shoes). Durable and comfortable. 
 -
____
Sleeping bag/ Quilt The quilt was a new thing for me when I started researching new gear for this trip.   It relies on you having a pad under you and usually employs some strap system to attach your quilt to the pad.  For cold nights this is a good thing but on warm nights I just lay it on top of me as much as I need.   I have a 20 degree Enlightened Equipment ""Revelation"" quilt.  I love it and it's a popular quilt on the trail.   You can customize the materials,  colors, etc.  One comment I will make is related to the weight of the fabric you choose for the inside and outside.   The lighter the fabric (7D is lighter than 10D which is lighter than 20D) - the ""stickier"" it will feel on your skin.  Heavier means higher durability, wind resistance, and water resistance but will weigh a little more.  Right now we are at the end of May and we are unlikely to need a 20 degree quilt.   If you have the money to spend on multiple quilts you may want to get a 40 degree one to use during the warmer months.  Don't forget though that as you head north you will be hitting some higher, cooler temps.   I plan to keep my puffy (slang for my heavier coat) the entire trip just in case.
If there is any other gear that you'd like to know about let me know. 
Tomorrow we plan on a short, roughly 7 mile day to the baseball field at the Graymoor Spiritual Life Center where we can camp for free.  We're in a bit of a rainy spell right now but maybe it will improve by tomorrow.

Boneless Thighs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638122,"Today was a planned short day out of Fort Montgomery,  NY.   We started the hike in the rain and ended in the rain.   Cold too.  48 degrees mid day with wind.  We crossed the Hudson on the Bear Mountain Bridge which was neat.  Would have been neater if it had been dry. 
We all stopped at the Appalachian Market for light resupply and lunch.  It wasn't quite what I expected.   It's a gas station with a great deli and nice staff.  I think we were hoping for a larger place where we could spread out a bit and dry out.  I spent a silly amount of time in the bathroom using the hand dryer on my wet  shorts.   Somebody said that this might be a felony in NY.  Yikes!  Their shelves were not stocked with much hiking food but we won't starve.  We arrived pretty damp and cold but a couple coffees later we were ready to move on to the Graymoor Spiritual Life Center which is part of a Franciscan facility.  They allow camping in the ball field.  A pavilion being renovated provided some shelter for meals.   
Tomorrow's weather is going to be cold again with even more rain if you can believe the weatherman.  You have to deal with the good and bad.   Hiking tomorrow is going to not be fun.  Getting our cold, wet socks on will be tough.  Maybe we planned our zero day poorly? 
I saw some unhappy looking Boy Scouts backpacking today.   I tried to cheer them up by telling them these bad days are the ones they'll remember.   It didn't help. 
Tomorrow's plan is about 14 miles.  We'll hit 400 miles!
One major change today.  As sometimes happens on the trail we had a name change for one of our crew.  Rearview has changed his name to what he is known by in Florida for his paddleboarding business - Barefoot Curt.  (https://barefootcurt.com or lookup barefootcurt on Facebook or Instagram)  Since any one of us can be found at the back of the pack at any time (OK - not MASH but certainly any of the rest of us! ) we felt Rearview's name no longer applied.Update:  We've made a difficult decision to head back to the hotel for the bad weather tomorrow.   Record cold temperatures and heavy rain made us reconsider the safety of hiking.

We had a pretty nice night at the ball field of the Graymoor Spiritual Life Center besides the raccoons running around in the pavilion where several people were sleeping.  Barefoot Curt woke up to hear them roaming the pavilion looking for food.  Luckily nobody woke up to a raccoon licking their face.  Tastes like chicken. 
With the horrible weather that we've been having today we invoked ""old man privilege"" and decided to throw money at the problem to resolve it.  We hiked back to the Appalachian Market, had breakfast and caught an Uber back to the Holiday Inn Express in Fort Montgomery,  NY.   Temperatures are several degrees lower than the record apparently and it's pouring.   It's not good hiking weather and dangerously slippery on the trail.   Nobody wants to end their hike on slippery,  lichen covered rocks.

Boneless Thighs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638253,"** Our gratitude goes out to all who've made the ultimate sacrifice while serving our nation.  **
I gotta tell you.   Taking yesterday off was the best decision we've made as a team.   Yesterday would have been miserable and I think we would have had to take half of today to dry out.    We were all very grateful for Monica (Barefoot Curt's wife) picking us up at the hotel and transporting us to the trailhead this morning.   Thanks Monica and Ruby!  
The weather wasn't bad - cool and misty for hours.  Decent hiking weather.   By lunchtime we started to see some sunshine which was nice but it did make things a little steamy.   Trail conditions were better than expected  - that translates to fewer rocks!  We did run into a huge tree down across the trail in a bad spot which was pretty hazardous to get around.   It makes me appreciate the work done on the trail to keep it clear.   
Our goal today was the RPH shelter around 19 miles away.   Even with a long break at Canopus Lake Beach we still arrived by 5 pm.  The long break was because this place had a snack bar and it was time for second lunch.  We all got burgers,  fries, and drinks.   Some got ice cream too.  
After we hiked away from the lake we went over Shenandoah mountain .  As we enjoyed the view we met several folks who had carried trail magic up the mountain.   I believe trail name Santa Claus was one of them.  Such nice people.   They brought us cold Guinness Stout, snacks and carrots.   We're eating the carrots for dinner.  Cold Guinness Stout in bottles!  These things were heavy.  Thanks for such great trail magic!   Our knees and ankles did hurt but no more.  We had to laugh because our food bags keep getting heavier and we hardly get to eat anything out of them. 
 If it wasn't for the actual walking part of this hike I'd say it was a pretty sweet deal.  You're essentially homeless and people feed you and give you beer and Gatorade because you are trying to hike 2200 miles.  Like I have said before.   If you need to have your faith in humanity restored, this is the place to come.  So many nice people. 
Tonight's shelter is an old converted cabin with a wall removed and has several cots.  I'm tenting but everyone else is staying in the shelter.   We're close to the road so there's noise but you can actually get pizza delivered to the shelter.   
With the extra mileage we did today we were over 19 miles for sure but only 18.8 on trail.   We hit 400 miles total trail miles today!

Boneless Thighs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638356,"Today was a weird day.  Mostly good but it started with a super heavy dew which left me with wet gear.  I guess I should have stayed in the shelter with the guys.  I heard coyotes howling around us last night which was cool.   This morning we had deer grazing near us which isn't unusual where I live but out here I've seen maybe 6 deer in a month.   
Then when we started to hike Barefoot Curt had significant pain in his foot from a near fall yesterday.   He powered through it and we got to the Mountaintop Deli in Stormville, NY and had a great second breakfast.   The round trip hike was about a mile.   Early in the day these extra distances seem to be worth it but later on we start to question ourselves when the legs begin complaining. 
The trail today had long sections of smooth going.  I was even able to call my parents (Hi Mom and Dad!) and my wife Sue (Hi honey!) while I was walking.   There were a couple of pretty views along the ridge line.    This section of trail had a number of large pools of water up high that made for more bugs.  Mostly sunny with cool temperatures were welcome.
Later I passed along the shore of Nuclear Lake.  It's beautiful but the name is creepy so I Googled it.   Turns out it was a Rockefeller experiment in nuclear energy that went bad.  In 1972, there was a significant explosion at the laboratory at Nuclear Lake that apparently sent plutonium dust into the air and polluted the place.  Oh joy.  No camping there for me.
I met a number of very interesting people out for day hikes.  Then I met through hikers Hanalei and Shaka.  They are the first people I've met on the trail that recognized me from TrailJournals.   Nice folks - Enjoy your hike!
More trail magic today!   We came upon 3 coolers at a crossroad with cold drinks,  snacks and fruit.   I had an apple.   So good.   We don't carry things like that due to their weight.   When we have access to them without having to carry them we get excited. 
Even though our miles on trail today were less than yesterday we were still beat getting into camp tonight.  The shelter has bad tent sites so we're uphill a couple tenths of a mile.   If you can use a hammock setup on the AT you have many more options in the southern part of the trail than us tent campers.  No level ground needed.   I just can't sleep like that.   
Tonight's tent site is shared with Bam and Hero.  We've seen them once before when they were slack packing but it's been nice to get to know them some in camp.   Our tents are very close to a mountain brook which will make sleeping good with its background noise. 
I'm hoping for a drier morning tomorrow.

Our day started with a short hike to the nearest road where we walked a half mile to Tony's Deli.  Great sandwiches and they let us recharge our electronics and use the facilities.   As we often say on the trail,  porcelain rules!
We had a great trail time today.   The trail was relatively smooth and the weather could not have been better.    Much of it was almost park like with very little underbrush. 
Barefoot Curt was back with us today which was good.  He and Monica sadly had to deal with the loss of their beloved sweet Golden Retriever Ruby.  Hiking yesterday was somber for sure.  We were all happy to have met her and for her long, happy life.
There were a bunch of stream crossings today.  I think more than normal given the rain we've had.   Sections of the trail were muddy with little springs flowing out of the rocks.  One section was ""closed"" with a detour due to a dangerous bridge.   We looked at it and found a way across.   Anything to keep our mileage down!
Camp tonight is near the Ten Mile river which flows into the Housatonic close by.  The Housatonic is big with fairly rough water.  We were able to find a bit of a beach and get cleaned up a bit.  That water was cold.  It felt really good.   Got some clothes washed but mainly our stinky selves.  Some rain is predicted for tonight and tomorrow.   Hopefully minor.
We're beginning to see more thru hikers from Georgia passing us.   I'm hoping that the big bubble is weeks behind us.   It is what it is.
Miles and our new friend section hiker Tinman were chatting this evening and found out that they are both accountants.   Miles clarified that he is a ""recovering"" accountant.   Also In camp was through hiker Skeeter who we haven't seen since the Mohican Outdoor Center.   He had his brother out with him for a couple of days.   Nice guys.

Boneless Thighs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638422,"Happy last day of school Madeline!   
Have a great summer.  Many thanks to all great teachers like you who are dedicated to making sure our kids are educated and prepared for life!  It's a very difficult job and we appreciate you.
We got an early start out of the Ten Mile river area.  Walking along the Housatonic river was amazing.   There were some incredible rapids.  Very powerful and noisy.   I wonder if they run raft trips.   We hiked into Bulls Bridge to grab a few supplies at the country store.   Along the way we got to see the actual Bulls Bridge which is a covered bridge.   The section of river it spans is super rough.  I'll post a video on my YouTube channel.   
The country store had a few things that we could use but not a ton.  They were very nice though.  
We got lucky and didn't have any rain (yet) today but it was humid so the sweat was pouring off of me.  There was plenty of water along this section and I didn't have to carry a lot.  We didn't really see many other hikers today.  Shaka and Hanalei were on trail as were newcomers Snaps (he takes lots of pictures) and Pawpaw (she has small feet).  We walked some ridges today with nice views but close to the end of the day we hit a crazy steep hill called St. John's Ledges.  It was actually pretty dangerous in my opinion but pretty cool to see.   Picking your footing was literally a life or death choice.   Especially with a backpack on.   We all made it safely but I know nerves and muscles were tense.  My pictures don't do it justice.   Suffice it to say that one misstep would send you cartwheeling into oblivion.   Lovely.
After hitting the bottom of this (upright and on our feet) we had the luxury of an over 2 mile section along the Housatonic again to our shelter area for the night.  MASH and Barefoot Curt chose to stay in the shelter with Skeeter and his brother.   The shelters here are really small and honestly would barely hold 5 people despite the 6 person capacity.   I like these guys but they smell bad and I snore.  Not a good situation for any of us.  I set up my tent as did Miles.   The only downside to tenting tonight is that we have a pretty good chance of rain so we'll have wet gear in the morning.   Oh well.
I did spend some time today getting cleaned up a bit while I was getting water so I'm not as disgusting as I could have been.  One interesting/ disgusting thing about our campsite is that the trees are full of caterpillars and so we have a constant rain of caterpillar poop.  It's awful.  Certainly not fun to try to eat with that coming down.  Not sure what our plans are tomorrow since we will have to see how the weather turns out. 
Cell coverage here is really bad so I'll have to wait to load up my videos.

Boneless Thighs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638488,"Today was full of changes.   We discussed doing 15 miles,  then possibly a Nero day and finally settled on hiking over 18 miles on trail and a couple more into the town of Falls Village,  Connecticut.   Why did we choose this town?   Because we wanted to get some real food for dinner.   Dinner tonight was a salad,  huge cheeseburger,  and 2 extra large pizzas.   I ordered a 3rd pizza just in case other people showed up.  We'll eat it for breakfast I suspect.   
We're camping at a place called the Toymakers Cafe.   The Cafe is closed due to Covid but they still allow camping for free.  Some restaurants deliver here so it's perfect.   No bathrooms though.   We'll see how that goes. 
For some reason today was hard hiking.   I just felt tired.  Maybe it was yesterday's time on the St. John's Ledges or perhaps my diet.  We all need to eat more and get some veggies.   More water would be a good idea too.  
Our site last night was OK but the trees were full of caterpillars and caterpillar crap rained down all night.   Turns out that we had it all day too.  What I believe were tent caterpillars were everywhere.   The forest looked like it had been hit with a weedeater.  Bits of leaves everywhere, caterpillars hanging from webs and a sound like rain in the woods.   It wasn't rain.  You had to hover over your food while preparing it or you had extra ""seasoning"".  Yuck.
We reconnected with Little Man's family again today and they are with us tonight along with Sugarman and Blueberry. 
We started hearing what sounded like race cars in the woods today.   It was really loud and after a while we came to a clearing where we could look into the valley.   There was the Lime Rock Park racetrack.   Looked like fun but super loud. 
Our next excitement was a 4 to 5 foot rattlesnake next to the trail.   He buzzed me and I thought it was a cicada.  Then I realized that was unlikely yet in this area.  Sure enough it was a large black rattler.  
We're planning on another 15 mile day tomorrow and hopefully a day off on Sunday.   Hot temperatures are coming so we'll need one.

Boneless Thighs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638544,"Today was a good day.   Better food last night was the key for me at least.   I carried most of an entire pizza with me for a while today for anyone who wanted it.  No refrigeration since last night and we haven't gotten sick yet!  Honestly it was awesome on the trail. 
We hiked out of Falls Village before 6:30 am with a bit of fog and cool temperatures.   Today ended up in the 80s or 90s.  The falls are pretty large and there's a hydroelectric facility there.   I think we may be done with the Housatonic river now.  
Our big climb was up to the summit of Bear Mountain.   It was gradual and not too bad for the most part.   Since it's heavily hiked by tourists it was well maintained.   Lots of people were out since it's Saturday.   Climbing down was another matter.   It wasn't as bad as the St. John's Ledges but parts were very steep.  We each did a little sliding.   We hiked for a while along one of the prettiest streams I've ever seen.  It is called Sawmill Brook.  Crystal clear and cold.  Lots of little waterfalls since it flows down a steep hill.  Great water to drink and Barefoot Curt and I couldn't pass up the opportunity to hop in.   Crazy cold and refreshing.   And we crossed into Massachusetts along this stream.   The last 1.3 miles to camp felt really good.   
When we arrived at our campsite there were some young men and one had become badly dehydrated and sick on the trail after only hiking a few miles.   His buddies said he'd carried too much and just overdid it on his first backpacking trip.  Paramedics came up the mountain and hauled him out.  New backpackers often try to carry too much stuff.  I have 28 pounds including food for several days and water and my pack is the heaviest in our group.   He seems like he'll be just fine. 
The reason for the title of this entry is because I was following Barefoot Curt when he saw a privy.  As is often the case he had to go check it out.   The last thing I heard him say as he disappeared inside was ""It's beautiful!"".  My how our standards have changed on the trail.   
Another horribly embarrassing thing happened to me today.   Here I am in the middle of the woods.   Haven't seen anyone for a long time.   I decide to stop and look at my phone for a minute and take a drink.   A few seconds later this older woman stands up from behind the tree that I'm 15 feet from.   Of the infinite places I could have stopped that's the place I chose.   So embarrassing.

Boneless Thighs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638588,"Our first full day in Massachusetts was the prettiest but also had the worst mosquitoes we've experienced so far.  We started the day with an uphill climb to the Mt. Race Ledges.  The trail skirted along a sharp drop off the face of the earth.  Or so my fear of heights told me.  It was spectacularly beautiful and we had a great day to see it.  
Later we climbed Mt. Everett (felt like Everest but not quite) which, at 2,608 ft is the highest peak in the south Taconic Mountains of Massachusetts, Connecticut and New York.  The view was nice but not like the Ledges from earlier in the day.   
At some point we met the friends of the guy who got pulled off the trail yesterday and they said that he was OK.  Good to hear.
Our day was short today but towards the end we all needed water.  When we tried to stop the mosquitoes attacked by the hundreds.   I kid you not.   It was so bad we said to heck with the water and started hiking as fast as possible.   I was behind Barefoot Curt and he had dozens of those bastards following him in his wake.  If you stopped you got swarmed.   They got us through our shirts.  The area was swampy and we had to fly through the mud and rotted, broken down boardwalk sections.   Luckily nobody fell in.  
When we finally got out of that awful spot we weren't far from the spot where Monica was picking us up.   Thanks Monica!   She had Gatorade all ready for us.   She wisely covered the area we sat on with plastic.  We were foul.
Tonight and tomorrow night we'll be at the Days Inn in Great Barrington,  Massachusetts resting and resupplying.  Soap just doesn't seem to cut the filth.  I think I need something more like oven cleaner.

Boneless Thighs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638667,"Today being a zero day we rested and resupplied. We had great food last night at La Fiesta Tex-Mex.   Today was mostly food from the Big Y grocery down the street. 
My shoes have finally started to split so I had to go into town for replacements.   I settled on Merrell MQM Flex 2 shoes.  They are pretty close to trail runners like I had but my Altra Lone Peak 4.5s were wide toe box,  zero drop shoes so felt very different.   We'll see how things go but I can tell you that you don't want your shoes exploding on you part way down a steep,  rocky downhill.   I also made the decision to send home my sleeping bag and change over to a light liner.  At least until the White Mountains I believe it is going to be too warm for a 20 degree bag.  If it gets cold I'll put on everything I have and I'll be fine.

Since we are taking a zero day today I decided to cover some more gear issues that my son Joe mentioned might be of interest. 

Other gear info:Stove Some people don’t even carry a stove.  Fuel is heavy and in summer who wants a hot meal.  Cold soaking of food is a topic you can research.   I am not an expert…yet.
MASH & Barefoot Curt have a BRS burner -Amazon – cheap, very light, not self lighting, only 3 prongs so not quite as good for holding a pot.  Requires you to have a separate pot, etc.I have a Jetboil minimo - short wide pot is better than skinny and tall - nice insulation on the pot with handles which is nice.  Nice lid.  Short and wide pot allows easier access to food.   Heavier than other options but more efficient on fuel.  The pot actually attaches to the stove so is relatively stable.Miles has a Gigapower stove which has 4 prongs for holding up the pot and has an igniter.  Requires you to have a separate pot, etc.
-----Water filtration I have a Sawyer squeeze as do MASH and Barefoot Curt – get the regular, not mini which I tried and is too slow - connects to many existing bottles like Smart Water bottles.  Works great and can be backflushed with clean water.   Lasts for a long time and weighs 3 ounces.  I like it.Miles has a Katadyn - nice and fast at first, cannot be backflushed so it has slowed down over time, requires special container to connect to it.  He’s switching to another brand.
One note:  I have found that having a CNOC 2 liter hydration bladder is great.  It connects to and works great with my Sawyer squeeze.   It makes scooping water from low flow streams easier too.  The bags that Sawyer gives you are weak and will spring a leak on the trail.   Thanks Curt for giving me his spare CNOC.
-----Trekking polesThe choices are largely aluminum vs carbon fiber, cork handles vs rubber vs foam, telescoping extension vs folding.We all chose aluminum over carbon fiber because we know of folks who’ve had their carbon fiber poles break.  Fewer issues with aluminum that we’ve seen but we have a limited knowledge here.  Cork absorbs sweat which is good.  I have rubbery handles and my hands sweat like crazy and get slippery.  I’d go with cork next time.  Not sure foam will hold up over time.  If you are using your trekking poles to hold up your tent (like I do with my Zpacks Duplex) then absolutely get telescoping poles and make sure that they extend to a length that will hold up your tent.  In my opinion the folding types aren’t adjustable enough.   Now the locking mechanism on the telescoping style must be good because it has to support a large load at times. Believe me, your trekking poles are important out here.  Going downhill I rely on them to keep my knees from bearing all the weight and going uphill I’m using them to pull me.  I have Black Diamond Trailback poles and Miles has the Black Diamond Trail Ergo.  MASH has the Foxelli 7075 aluminum.  Barefoot Curt has some REI aluminum poles.  
Note:  wrap some heavy duty duct tape around your poles under the handle for use on the trail.   It’s great for everything from patches to shoe repair.
-----Food This is evolving on the trail for us.  I started with dehydrated meals which were good but pricey.  Now we’re more into instant oatmeal, instant coffee,  instant potatoes, Ramen noodles, foil packs of meat, tuna, SPAM.  High calorie, high protein bars are quick and easy but pricey.   Tortillas and nut butter, honey, trail mix for the constant snacking while hiking (the only way to keep your energy up all day).  Do yourself a favor and make sure there’s some dried fruit in your trail mix.  Not just candy and peanuts.   Veggies are good to include somehow but very heavy to carry.  We eat them in town and today I picked up a mix of dried vegetables that I crushed and will add to my meals.  Bring vitamins.   Some folks bring hard cheeses but we have not tried this. 
-----Socks Wool for sure even in summer.  Darn Tough brand has a lifetime guarantee and some spots along the trail where you can get replacements if needed.  REI socks are great too.  I have always been a fan of silk sock liners to minimize blisters but this is a personal choice.   Bring along something like Leukotape to wrap a hotspot before it turns into a blister.   Duct tape works in a pinch but is harder to remove. 
Note:  wool also works well for shirts.   It's cool and comfortable and doesn't smell bad after it dries.  Smartwool is great.   Miles and I both have the Icebreaker brand shirts. -----
What you think about on the trail to pass the time?Me – family, where can I find the next cool picture,  I watch for wildlife,  what were the lyrics to that song?, if Little Man can climb this mountain then so can I,  where should I put my foot next, uh-oh I don’t see the next white blaze, it’s embarrassing how bad I smell, where’s the next water, is that trail magic I see?……
Miles – where is our next zero, is it worth the mileage to get to that gas station convenience store?, how in God’s name can they actually call this a trail?, how can the ATC only consider people starting after May 11th as legal through hikers?
Barefoot Curt – family, how is my son doing, what am I doing here?, career lessons, life philosophies, privy evaluations (graded on the ""butt nugget scale"" on a 1 to 5 ""butt nuggets"" - to date no privy has scored a 5).
MASH - family, reflects on his 30 plus years of military and EMS services.
We have a lot more time on trail so I am sure these thoughts will evolve or more likely devolve to become stranger and more primitive.  Like cavemen.  Who knows?

Miles is here!  All is well.   He hunkered down during the worst of the first storm and made it into camp afterwards.   
We started the day with a ride back to the trail from a local hiker shuttle run by Papa Joe.  He simply takes donations and seems very busy.   He likes to catalog where the hikers are from and what kind of hike they are doing.   
We hit 500 miles today!  It feels pretty good.   1700 more to go.  Yikes. 
Today was very hot and humid with no air movement at all.   While our hiking wasn't hard we felt pretty disgusting.   We crossed paths with the Sutton family again who were slack packing out of Great Barrington.   Sugarman and Blueberry were with them.   Later we met hikers Tractor and Underdog.  Tractor had a Virginia Tech shirt on so I knew that he was a good guy.
My son Jake will be happy to know that I'm seeing lots of Red Sox shirts , especially Ortiz and license plates up here.  We're definitely in Boston/ New England sports country!
Apparently there is lots of bear activity at this shelter so we all have to be careful about food.   Luckily there is a bear box to store our food bags in.

The trail here in Massachusetts started very pretty but after that it turned into mud and mosquitoes.   We're not enjoying it much.  Much of the trail seems to be in swampy areas with questionably stable boardwalks or none at all.  My new shoes allow me to go through deeper mud than the Altras I had before.
At Upper Goose Pond we reconnected with the Sutton family,  Sugarman and Blueberry.   They slack packed for all but the last 3 miles but showed up with beers for all of us.   Nice!  Then somebody boating on the Pond came by and gave them more beer.   Gotta love the trail.

The trail was drier with fewer mosquitoes.  Believe me though,  they were still there.  Cooler temps and a breeze made the day as delightful as they get.  We were motivated to get the first 11 miles done because it got us to the “Cookie Lady"".  The Cookie lady is a fixture on the trail but recently changed owners.  The Sangree family made us feel welcome with cookies and Rhubarb lemonade or soda.  The Rhubarb lemonade was incredible.   They are donation based and allow camping on site as long as you have permission. It’s a blueberry farm that will be providing blueberry based products soon hopefully.  Nice folks providing a great service along the trail.

Boneless Thighs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639053,"Today felt like we were restaurant hopping.   We left the Kay Wood shelter at 6:10 am and had a great hike through the cool, dry forest down to lovely Dalton,  Massachusetts.   This is the first state where we have done much walking through town.   Our first stop of the day was the Juice N'Java coffee house.   Great breakfast sandwiches and even better coffee.   Lots of friendly folks there that wanted to talk hiking.  We ate outside and enjoyed the beautiful weather.   
As we were walking through town a man stopped us and ran across the street to talk to us about our hike.  Next thing we know he's run into the house we're outside of and brought us cold water bottles.  Then he ran back inside for a box of treats like rice Krispy snack, mini muffins and ding dongs.  Then the 3rd time he reappeared with 6 freezy pops.  By this time we couldn't carry any more and had to find a way to move on.   We ate the freezy pops on the way out of town.   Arriving at the entrance of the trail back into the woods we wondered what to do with the sticky plastic tubes from the pops.  Miles looked over at a car that had a door open and out popped a gentleman waiting for his through hiking wife.  In his hands he had a garbage bag for us to dump garbage.   Unreal.   What timing.  The trail will provide.   We find that to be true so often.
Next we hiked to another great town for lunch.  Cheshire,  Massachusetts also has a section of the trail going through it so we stopped at what I believe was called Diane's Twist for hot dogs,  Gatorade,  pasta salad and ice cream.   It was very good except that we stuffed ourselves just before climbing a big chunk of Mount Greylock.   The shelter tonight is at 2671 feet and the trail peaks out at 3489 feet.   We hate climbing first thing in the morning but we didn't have much choice.   We're staying in the shelter tonight because it doesn't look too bad, the tent sites don't look good and it's going to rain overnight. Hopefully we have no mouse issues.  The shelter last night had a mouse running around in it that had no fear of any of us.
We're sharing the shelter with Rainbow who is also a flip-flop hiker out of Harpers Ferry.   We've crossed paths with him several times. 
I had one scare today due to a grouse on trail that I assume was protecting a nest.  It exploded out of the brush and flapped around just feet from me until I walked away.   They are basically a bowling ball with a head and wings but they sure can cause a ruckus.   
It's going to be another chilly night.  I'm not sure I mentioned this but I sent my 20 degree sleeping bag home and Barefoot Curt loaned me a bag liner that basically provides maybe 10 degrees of warmth.  I need to layer up and wear my coat to be warm some nights but it saves weight.   So far it's been great. 
Tomorrow we summit Mount Greylock!   The tallest point in Massachusetts.   Soon we'll be in Vermont.

Boneless Thighs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639163,"Today was a sad day of sorts.  We found out that MASH, who’d stayed back at the Cookie Lady's place to help out with odd jobs, has decided that he’s gotten what he was looking for from this hike and is likely going off trail.   This prompted Barefoot Curt to reevaluate how he was going to manage his hike too.  Since his wife Monica was staying close by in their travel van he is now able to spend more time with her and do the trail in a more relaxed fashion.   I'm happy for them both but we’ll miss hiking with them for sure.  We hope to see them during our zero days in Bennington, VT and maybe again on the trail some.  Later maybe we can reconnect with them once we are done with our hikes.  
The hike today started late because we waited out the rain that had been falling most of the night.   The rain stopped but the trees kept dripping so we got wet anyway.   When we got to the top of Mt Greylock it was totally foggy.   While we sat and had coffee with Monica and Curt the sun came out and we could finally see the incredible views from the mountain.  Miles and I grabbed lunch at the Bascom lodge and then rolled out.   With the late start we knew that we’d be rolling into camp late.  Coming down from Mt Greylock was pretty smooth.  Once we walked through the town of Greylock we had to climb another mountain.   The end of that climb was up a boulder field that was very poorly marked.   The boulders were very light colored so if white blazes were there we couldn’t see them.  Plus many of the trees now are white Birch which are also impossible to put a blaze on.  Miles and I made it but were exhausted at the top and we still had 5 or 6 miles left.  
Today we crossed into Vermont!   One more milestone.   The shelter site we’re at tonight is packed with weekend hikers as well as section and through hikers.   There’s maybe 25 people here at least and it’s noisy even past dark.  One hiking couple that is notoriously slow and late into camp rolled in at 1 am and they were in the same site as us last night.  How the heck anyone can hike safely on this terrain with headlamps is beyond me.  I think that they need to set more realistic mileage expectations. 
We’re going to zero tomorrow and Monday in Bennington,  VT and resupply.   Hopefully we’ll miss the rains that are coming early this week.

Boneless Thighs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639191,"Crazy crowded shelter last night.  There were over 20 people there from families to through hikers to partiers.  We blamed it on the weekend,  the fact that Vermont is the start of the Long Trail (which follows the AT for a spell), and that today is Vermont Day.  Who knows. 
We started the hike with poorly maintained trail that was very overgrown.   The vegetation was so thick that it knocked my glasses off twice.   Combine that with the mud pits that Vermont is famous for and it was not nice.  My feet hurt in many different places because of the funny foot placement we were using walking around the mud.  Our goal today was Bennington,  Vermont for a zero so we pushed along.
We did get to see some moose tracks (not the ice cream variety).  Of course neither of us wanted to see a moose face to face on those tight trails. 
The final climb downhill into Bennington was hard on our already sore knees because of the steepness and the fact that it was a series of large rock steps that people put in.   They meant well but the rocks are at odd angles now and very dangerous in places and the height between steps can be large.   Going up would be easier on your knees than down. 
Coming down into Bennington we were fortunate to have Monica and Curt pick us up and take us to the hotel for one last hurrah with MASH.   We'll be sad to see them go.  MASH'S wife Lisa is coming out for some sightseeing before they both head home to the Badlands.  Curt and Monica also plan to travel some and see their son.  We'll hopefully get together again sometime after this hike.

Cell coverage in these mountains has been very poor so I may not be able to get my entries in for a while.   If all goes well tomorrow we will hit 600 miles.  We have to take motivation from each milestone because the mental game is getting harder and harder.   New state, mileage ...whatever we can get.  Seeing two of your hiking friends leave the trail starts making you want home more as well.   When asked what he does when he feels like this on the trail Denim Dan said that he just keeps walking.  And that's what we're planning on doing tomorrow.   Just keep walking.

Trail conditions were not bad but we're still dealing with frequent mud pits made worse by yesterday's rain.  The fire tower was a fun climb with great views from the top.  Bugs were bad in places.   I'm not sure how I'll do with them in the shelter tonight.  Hopefully no mice.  Miles prefers his space so he is in his tent but tent sites are not good here so I'm sheltering it.  Also it might rain so I'm trying to stay dry.  As has been the case a lot recently, cell phone coverage is spotty so I may not be able to submit my entry tomorrow in a timely fashion.

We got an early start and it was chilly.   I expected things to warm up but it never did.  The skies were pretty clear and breezy so this was perfect hiking weather.   
As we've seen the last few days the trail has more Long Trail hikers than AT hikers.   Most are slower, love to chat about gear and trail names, and are prone to get blisters.   It's been interesting to meet them but it sure does make for crowded shelters.  
We got to climb Stratton mountain and then climb the fire tower on top of that.  Scary as all get out.  The wind was blowing hard enough that I felt like my phone would blow out of my hand on top of the tower.  The view was incredible and I could see multiple ski resorts. 
We stay tonight at Stratton Pond shelter and we're actually in the shelter.  The tent sites in Vermont are bad around many of the shelters. The Pond is very pretty and would be a great place to swim if it was 30 degrees warmer.   It's going to be colder tonight than last night so we'll all be bundled up.It looks like we were at 39 or 40 degrees last night.   Chilly for sure.

Boneless Thighs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639455,"Today started with a beautiful sunrise around 5 am.  The wind was still blowing strong which made taking the tent down interesting.  Once we got off the top of the mountain we heated up fast.  
The trail down from Bromley Mountain was not good.  A trail maintenance team is working in that area so hopefully things improve.   It’s super hard work.  We had one pretty big climb early on and then things mostly “flattened” out.  It’s all relative.  Mostly flat is still a lot of ups and downs.   Just not 1000 feet.
We saw Shaka and Hanalei again today.   It’s always good to see them.   We had 5 fast AT northbound through hikers pass us.  I hope that the big bubble of people coming up isn’t close.   We’ll have trouble getting camping sites if they hit us.  
Some trail maintainer in Vermont must be out to get me.  Twice today I got conked by branches overhanging the trail that had been trimmed to just the right length to skewer me in the forehead.  The first one pretty much knocked me down and out for a couple of seconds.   It left a bit of a spot.  Hopefully no concussion but I’m not sure there’s a concussion protocol here like in football.   The second one hit a glancing blow.  Not much damage.   On this rocky, rooty, muddy trail we really have to keep our eyes down watching our footing so what’s about to hit us in the head is of secondary importance.   Until it hits you.  I broke both branches so that the next person won’t have a problem.   (And because I was ticked off at the tree.)
Our hike today ends at USFS 10 rather than a shelter because Miles wife “Girl Friday” and friends Tom and Karen are picking us up for a couple days of slack packing,  real food, and real beds at an AirBnB.   We’ll resupply as well.  We’re excited to have a break.  We are hoping to get higher mileage in while slack packing but we’ll see.

Boneless Thighs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639546,"It was an awesome day to slack pack.   We had rain last night and we weren't out in it.  Perfect timing!   The house we're in was over 30 minutes from today's trailhead but each day we'll get closer.   The mountains here are bigger than we have in Maryland and pretty steep in places.   Very green.   Maybe that's where they get the Green Mountain State nickname from?  Actually Vermont is derived from the French Vert (green)  and Mont (mountain) so there you go.   An educational moment (I Googled it).
Tom hiked with me and Miles for entire day.  Karen and Marcia (Girl Friday) generously did our resupply shopping and then met us with lunch at the halfway point.   The second half of the day was a little drizzly but mostly cool and cloudy.  We saw a couple of ponds, an overlook of the Rutland airport, and ended the day with a crossing of the beautiful Clarendon Gorge bridge.   It's a 30 foot long suspension bridge over a fast running, very clear section of the Mill River.  Besides a bunch of Eastern Newts we did not see any wildlife.   Still waiting on that bear and moose sighting.  Other folks have seen porcupines and one bobcat.   It's tough to see animals unless they are on the ground by my feet or over the trail where I'm looking for the next branch that's waiting to poke me in the head. 
Trail conditions were great with mostly smooth hiking.  What a nice break from what we've been hiking.  The rocks and roots were at a minimum.   We had it cleaned up especially for Tom and Karen.  We'd told them all about how crazy hard the trail conditions were and now I'm not sure they believe us!  Just kidding.   We were thrilled to have an easier day.   We saw many of our hiking friends.   Dancing Pants, Moxie, Sunshine and new hikers Rocketman and Tangerine.   
After the hike we went to Kelly's Snack Shack in Wallingford,  Vermont.   Miles and I each had a massive double cheeseburger with fries.   Then came ice cream.   This was just first dinner.   Later we'll be having second dinner with beer.  Gotta load up on calories while we can!

Boneless Thighs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639614,"Happy Father's Day Dad!  Wish you could be here with me for some of this hike.
We got a late start today which is understandable because we really didn't want to leave our comfy beds, food,  etc.  Miles,  Tom and I hiked the first 6 miles by 11 am.  It was another slack packing day which is awesome.   It started with a very steep uphill over large boulders.  Very different terrain than we'd hiked yesterday.  Tom got to experience some of the lovely rooty, rocky terrain we'd been telling him about.   It wasn't bad though.  We arrived at our prearranged lunch spot that Marcia and Karen were supposed to meet us at and it was a gravel road.   There are a lot of them around here.   We were afraid that they wouldn't find us but they did.  Lunch was very good and fueled us for the next 11 miles. 
Miles and I continued on to climb Killington mountain which is 4235 feet.  The climb was long and gradual but the trail was very undeveloped.   Basically an animal trail with white blazes.   The trail down was better.   We met Marcia and Karen part way down and they hiked out with us.   
I was fortunate to have a decent cell signal climbing down and was able to call my Dad for Father's day.  He and my Mom were having Margaritas out celebrating the day - I was jealous.   I also chatted with both my sons who along with my wife Sue had sent me very nice cards and a boatload of my favorite Righteous Felon jerky for the trail.  I'm packing some and some will have to wait until we flip back to Harpers Ferry. 
At the top of the mountain we met several of our Long Trail friends who'd been at the Clarendon shelter last night.   A woman had a new Ursack bear bag that had been absolutely destroyed by a bear.  Ursacks seem pretty durable and allow you to not have to hang your food.   Anyway,  the campers watched while the bear ate everything.   Nothing could scare it away.   Apparently this bear is a repeat offender and that tells me that a bear box needs to be brought in.
All in all it was a great day.   The next couple of days are going to be shorter due to shelter placement and our distance limitations.   Maybe 10 miles each day.   I'm looking forward to reaching the Whites.  We'll trade the green tunnel for the above the treeline rockiness that is the White Mountains.   Guess I need to get out the sunscreen.   I'm prepared to be scared out of my mind on some of these climbs.  Hopefully not but many hikers have told me to be prepared for some scary sections.

Boneless Thighs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639685,"Today is the Summer Solstice.   That means it is National Hike Naked Day.  I am thankful that we did not see anyone hiking au natural.  The picture with today’s entry commemorates the day.  I’ll say no more about that… 
In fact we only saw 2 people while we were hiking.   One northbound and one southbound.   This is probably because early today we passed the spot where the Long Trail breaks from the Appalachian Trail.   We’ll miss the LT friends we made but it’ll be nice to have less competition for shelter and tent sites.  Soon enough we will start seeing SOBO (Southbound) hikers and things will be crowded again.   One thing that I forgot to mention in yesterday’s entry was the Father’s Day trail magic we got.  At one of the cross roads we encountered a cooler full of Gatorade, sodas, and beer and the sign on the top said Happy Father’s Day.   It was signed but I can’t remember the names.  Pretty nice.Our day started with a great breakfast at the Sugar and Spice restaurant in Rutland,  Vermont.   Lots of maple syrup and Vermont knickknacks but great food.  I had an egg sandwich and coffee for breakfast #1 and banana cream cheese stuffed French toast for breakfast #2.  Not a bit was left.  I think Miles ate his meal and half of Marcias.   Their menu stated that artificial syrup was possible but would be an extra charge.   A joke we figured but they take their maple products very seriously in Vermont so maybe not.It was hot but very breezy so hiking was a little better than expected for me given the higher resupply day weight we are carrying.   Every meal makes our packs lighter.   Sadly for this northern leg I’ve had to lighten my pack.  Gone until the southern section is my flask and whiskey (this made me sad KB but it’s only temporary).  I added more food per day and a sleeping bag liner for the colder nights.   It’s still getting down to below freezing some nights in the White Mountains so we need to be prepared.  We saw our first bears today.  Three bears all at once just north of the Thundering Falls boardwalk.   We saw bear #1 running away from us and before I could get my camera out bears #2 and 3 came scrambling / falling out of trees (which was pretty funny to watch) and off they ran.  No pictures.   Unlike the picture from yesterday (taken by LT hiker Dance Pants) I’d rather see the rear end of a bear and not get its picture than have it eat my food and get the picture.   Maybe that’s just me.  Our short 10 mile days today and tomorrow are driven by shelter spacing and our late start today due to the great breakfast.   Neither of us want to hike late in the day especially since severe storms are predicted for late this afternoon.   We’re both staying in the shelter tonight because it seems clean and we don’t want to start the day tomorrow with wet tents.  The shelter has a bear box.  Yea!  A bear box is a substantial metal box chained to a tree away from the shelter that you put your food bag into.  It has various mechanisms that make it impossible for a bear to open.   This is easier and more reliable than hanging your food.

Boneless Thighs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639708,"700 miles!  Each milestone motivates us towards our goal.So let me clear up one thing.  We did NOT hike naked yesterday for even a second.   Our picture didn’t show that we were wearing shorts.   Have you seen the mosquitoes out here?  If anything we should be wearing more clothes,  not less.Also,  I keep forgetting interesting things that we notice on our hike.  Yesterday as we hiked north towards Thundering Falls we noticed that a fairly long section of the trail had been raked.  It was clean as a whistle.   Is this what they do to you for minor traffic offenses up here?  Seems like a heck of a lot of work.Last night was crazy stormy.  The thunderstorms kept coming and at one point the rain came down so hard I recorded it and put it out on YouTube.  I’m glad we stayed in the shelter.   Nobody else joined us.   Shaka and Hanalei were tenting and got pretty wet but they dealt with it like it was no big deal.   We enjoyed chatting with them at dinner and breakfast.   Really nice folks.The morning started with an aluminum ladder we had to climb down over a rock face.  Somebody hauled this thing in a long way.  It was cool and super humid but no rain until late morning.  Mostly we heard rain but it didn’t reach us through the leaves.   Until lunchtime.   Then we started to get wet and decided to get to the Winturri shelter to eat and wait out the worst of the rain.   This had been our destination today but we wanted to push on another 6 miles.  Beast (named because she’s a beast going up hills) was there drying out her gear from the rain and it looked like she was staying.  Our stay lasted 2 hours.  I got a nap in but it started getting chilly so Miles and I decided to push along to a stealth tent site we’d heard of. The rest of the hike was very wet and slippery.   The trail in the forest was dark due to the overcast skies.  Not good hiking.   We only saw one other hiker all day and she was day hiking southbound.  Since we left the Long Trail the AT has been empty.   It’s odd to go all day seeing nobody.   At this point Miles and I don’t talk a lot for long periods.   It might go like this: Miles – “Moose poop""Me – “hmmmm""15 minutes laterMe – “I wonder if it was fresh or just looked that way because it was wet.”Miles – “hmmmm""And it’ll be an hour before we say anything else besides the grunts and groans of exertion from the hills or slipping on a rock or root.  We’re hoping for better weather tomorrow but cell coverage is so intermittent here that we have no real clue.   Sometimes we can only get a text out so that family knows we’re safe.  Our next big goal is a day off at my friend and coworker from Aetna/CVS, Mark Matthews.  He and his wife generously offered to collect us at the New Hampshire border and help us resupply and rest a bit before the Whites.  Very nice.  Their son completed the AT in 2019 and currently is through hiking the PCT.  The Whites scare me.  The limited resupply options and the hiking above the treeline will be difficult especially if we have any storms like last night.   We’ll get it done.  We have to. I’m hoping for some sun tomorrow and drier air.  And no bears in camp tonight.

Today was as good weather-wise as yesterday was bad.  That’s what keeps things interesting out here.   
Coyotes howling nearby last night were interesting and a bit disturbing but no bears went after our food.   Tents pitched in these pine forests get all sappy so that’s gonna be a mess.
We didn’t start super early mainly because it was cold and I really didn’t want to get out of my sleeping bag.  I have Barefoot Curt to thank for this bag.  It’s a 40 degree bag that is actually usable in the temperatures we’re having versus my 20 degree quilt that was just too warm.   I had everything on except my heavy coat when we started hiking.   Immediately we went through waist high grassy field that soaked my pants and shoes.  The pants dry pretty quickly on a nice day but not my “new"" shoes.  Unlike my Altras, these Merrells stay damp for a while.   I still like them. 
Instead of all woods hiking like much of southern Vermont,  today had a number of the above-mentioned open fields.   A couple of them actually had little benches.   Our lunch spot was perfectly timed for one such field with 2 benches under an apple tree with a great view.  We had decent cell coverage intermittently today so I could call Sue and my parents.  Of course tonight I have no signal whatsoever so this entry will have to wait until tomorrow.   
The trail magic gods smiled upon us today.  We had 3 instances of trail magic.  One was early and was just sodas.  The next was just before the White River.   The girlfriend of through hiker Distress was slack packing him and Grumpy Cat to Hanover,  New Hampshire.   She had a ton of trail magic from chocolate milk to fresh apples and berries.  She was awesome.  While we were with her a gentleman with a fishing pole heading to the river mentioned that the green house on the north side of the bridge also had trail magic.  We checked it out as well because we needed to get some water.  We filled up and grabbed cold sodas.  What a magical day.   
Now if only we could have used that magic to get rid of the hills.   Northern Vermont believes in going straight up the hills instead of switch backs.  This is faster theoretically but uses very different muscles.  Also there’s lots more sweating involved.  I will try to start including the Ascent and Descent for each day moving forward since that gives you some idea of our elevation changes each day.
We made it to our shelter tonight around 4:15.  All day we saw 3 people hiking.   Then a pile of people came rolling into the shelter late including Trebek (asks a lot of questions) and a group of 7 who call themselves the Union.  They all seem very nice but I’m not used to the late chatter.  I mean, who has conversations after 6:30 pm.  Really?  That’s bedtime!

Our hike out of the Heaven Hill shelter was easy save for one missed turn and a bit of wasted time backtracking.  No big harm done but we hate the wasted energy.   Another beautiful day for hiking.   We made it into Norwich,  VT to more trail magic from the Hanover Adventure Tours folks.  Then we road walked through some beautiful neighborhoods multiple miles over the Connecticut River into New Hampshire.   One more state!  
After this momentous occasion was celebrated we walked up the hill to Dartmouth college.   Pretty college town with a great vibe.   Just down the street we stopped at Lou's Restaurant for breakfast and our free through hiker donut.  We were joined by Trebek from the shelter last night and enjoyed the conversation.   Great food.  Then on to the Co-op store down the street for some resupply.   
At noon my friend from work Mark Matthews picked us up and took us to his home for some cleanup and to be spoiled completely by his wife Barbara.   Their son Jon did the AT in 2018 and so she knew what we needed.   Everything from Gatorade to homemade cookies to salads and burgers.  We ate like kings.   She also took us to another resupply store so we're set for a few days.   Thanks Barbara and Mark !

Washington has food as well.   We’re hoping to not have to catch an expensive shuttle to a town but we will if we have to go.   Maybe we can hitchhike for the first time. The need to limit our pack weight is driven by the difficulty of the climbs on these trails.   It will be an interesting section and hopefully beautiful.   These mountains have a reputation for being foggy a lot.  Maybe we’ll get lucky.  Several of the mountains are over 5,000 ft and Mt Washington is 6288 ft.  The potentially bad weather there is infamous and makes for a risky hike.  Bad weather will cause us to postpone since we’re prepared for chilly but not cold weather.   Especially if it is wet and windy along with the cold.  Recently the temperatures have been below freezing at night and days have had winds gusting to 70 mph.  It’s gonna be interesting.

Cell coverage will be spotty from here north so forgive the delayed entries.
No bears at the Trapper John shelter last night so that was good.   These shelters should all have bear boxes and this one didn’t.   Sleep was decent and we were ready and on the trail by 6:30.  
Hiking today was going to be difficult due to a couple of climbs over Smarts mountain and Mount Cube.  Going up Smarts mountain though was our hardest climb so far due to the long, steep , slippery rock walks.  Everything was wet from the humidity.   There were places where rebar or wooden steps had been installed in particularly steep areas but none of it was easy.  We were sweating buckets at the top.   Another fire tower climb awaited us there.  I did get most of the way up and decided that the view was just fine from there.   The wind was pretty strong so after a quick rest we had to start hiking again to get warm.
Coming down off the mountain was much longer and less steep.   We ate lunch on a bridge over Jacob’s Creek with Rocketman (through hiker starting in Georgia) and Clementine (flip-flop hiker starting in Harpers Ferry,  WV).  
The next climb up was more gentle than the first but still tough.  Long steep rock sections again with many, but not all, covered with moisture from the humidity. My shoes got no traction on that.  We finally made it up only to find that we couldn’t stay long and enjoy the view because rain was headed our way.   I didn’t want to get caught on the steep rocks downhill made even wetter and more slippery by rain.  The drizzle started about half way down and is still going here in our campsite at 5:30.  I didn’t even think it was supposed to rain. 
One thing I forgot to mention yesterday.   We finally saw a porcupine.  Sadly it was roadkill but I recognized it still.
Lots of slips and slides today but no injuries so that’s good.   I felt like I’d done a good job on the climbs.
 We saw lots of moose poop today.   Just a matter of time before we see a moose!

Our site last night was great.   Flat spots,  no bears and a babbling brook in the background.   We were on the trail before 6:30 and made it to the Hikers Welcome hostel before lunchtime.   Trail conditions were pretty decent with some long muddy sections but no long straight ups like yesterday.   No great views either.  Tomorrow on Moosilauke will make up for that I hope.   When we came off trail we were met by Aquaman, a 2019 through hiker, with a carload of trail magic.   I had lemonade and watermelon.   Another nice member of the trail community.   Amazing. 
The hostel here will slack pack us over Mount Moosilauke but we're doing it from north to south for safety purposes.   The north face is pretty steep and so we want to do that going uphill.  Some thunderstorms are predicted and a high of 92.  Both of those make this a difficult day.  We'll see.   I'll try to report back tomorrow with a  status.

Boneless Thighs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639978,"Ascent: 4072 ftDescent:  3255 ftToday we slack packed Mount Moosilauke (4802 ft high) from north to south.   The steepest part is on the north side and we wanted it to go up that part for safety purposes.   
The hike was awesome.   We were literally wringing out our shirts we were so sweaty.   The climb was hard and slow but we all made it safely.   The top was beautiful and when we got there we were in the clouds but we hung out and ate lunch and saw the clouds break a few times.  
The wind made it cold but it felt good.  We couldn't stay for too long because of the chance of T'storms at 1 pm.  Sure enough just as we hiked into the hostel we could hear thunder.   15 minutes later the storm hit and quickly moved through.   
I'm all showered and clean for a change.   Sadly tomorrow I'll be sweaty and gross after 10 minutes on the trail.   The Kinsmans are coming tomorrow and they are over 4000 ft as well and supposedly a technical climb.  Like put your trekking poles away and use your hands.  Fun.
Again, we'll see.   Most of this stuff is very hard but hasn't scared me like I thought it would.   I loaded a longer than normal video on YouTube made from several sections of the climb.  Nothing professional and I did no editing.  It was a great hike.

Boy do I wish we had slack packed today too.  This was a brutal hike for me.  I’ve heard it called the most difficult mountain in the Whites on the AT.  I hope that is true.  At this shelter we’re still only partially down the mountain so tomorrow morning will continue the difficult hike. 
Miles, me, Clementine and Rocketman hiked together off and on today.  The beginning was very pretty with a moderate climb along Eliza Brook.   Waterfalls all along it just begged us to come swimming.   Some folks that we know who were slack packing today took a dip.  We could not.  As we worked our way up the trail it turned into a boulder filled stream bed that required basic rock climbing skills to get up. Use your hands, wedge your toes into little crevices in rock walls, pull on trees or roots.  We had to collapse our trekking poles and get on hands and knees a couple times.  I lost some skin off my shins to get up one section.   Some people love this stuff but not me.  The thought of a misstep causing me to tumble back onto the rocks caused me to go very slow.   Long sections literally had water running down the trail and the rocks were mossy (i.e. slippery).  We’ve actually gotten used to that. We made it to the top of South Kinsman mountain and enjoyed the view for a while.   I believe we could see the town of Lincoln. New Hampshire.   The sky was clear.  Then we hiked over North Kinsman mountain and headed down the other side towards our shelter for the night.   The downhill is worse than the uphill to me because falling is easier.   I saw one day hiker sliding down some of the slick rocky sections on her butt.  Sadly her shorts were not going to last the whole way down the mountain.   We all got cuts and bruises on legs and arms.  Of course I bonked my head again on a tree across the trail head high for me and I was watching the rocks on the trail.   The tree was OK.   
The shelter is situated on a beautiful high elevation pond.  Nice shelter too.  This is the beginning of where we have to pay for shelter or tent space.  The Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC) staffs and maintains these camping areas.  Through hikers pay $10 for the first night and $5 afterwards.   The initial fee gets us a pass and free or discounted lunches in the huts (think lighter packs because we will carry less food) plus discounted prices on other ultralight stuff at the visitor centers and Mount Washington.   Megan is the caretaker here and the place looks great.   She also gave me some Tang she didn’t want.   Yummy sugary orange drink.  
Bugs here are horrible so I am wearing my head net for the first time.   
While I wouldn’t do this hike again I do feel a sense of accomplishment.   The view was great.  Hopefully no rain tonight.   This week is calling for rain several days making anything in the Whites more difficult or impossible.   Not sure what we do then because Girl Friday is picking up Miles on the top of Mount Washington soon.

It may seem like today was short mileage but it made up for it in difficulty.   The downhill out of the Kinsman Pond shelter was slippery and very slow.  Some rain last night didn't help any.  I watch some local experienced hikers on this terrain and they bounce over it like a mountain goat.  No packs and knees that are 30 years younger.   Up was hard but downhill comes with a greater risk of a bad fall. 
  It's been so hot and humid I'm beginning to believe that I'm hiking in Maryland.   Everything is wet.  I'm probably not drinking enough even though I'm downing maybe 5 or 6 liters of water a day.
We had to hike an extra 1.8 miles to get our resupply box that had been mailed to the Flume Gorge Visitor center.   We also decided to wait until 11 am for the cafeteria to open so that we could get some food that didn't include peanut butter and tortillas.   The only downside to this was that it put us at risk of hiking during a thunderstorm.   Once we got back on trail we had a 2500 ft climb over about 2.5 miles.   And we had a fresh load of food in our packs.   New Hampshire doesn't believe in switchbacks so the climb went straight up a rocky, riverbed-like at times, trail.   I was totally soaked with sweat by the time I reached the campsite and storms were coming so I got set up as fast as possible.   In this terrain they make you use tent platforms  - basically a deck for your tent.  Setting up on these is interesting because you can't really stake things down.  It's a nightmare if you don't have a freestanding tent.  And neither of us do.
Anyway,  we made it safely through the day.  The forecast for the next few days is rainy so we're likely to stay wet.  Time for the A&D ointment to prevent another diaper rash.   TMI, I know.   Sorry.   It's an awful fact in these hiking conditions.   
I have to say that I'm considering calling it quits before I get to a point where it's difficult to get out.  After seeing how dangerous the trail has been the last couple of days I'm not interested in hiking alone.  If I can connect with others who have about the same distance goals and put safely over distance then I'll join them.  We'll see.

We started today wet.  Thunderstorms before bed and hard rains overnight made getting out of bed no fun.  Due to the additional tent that had been pitched on the tent platform we were on my tent pitch changed and thus leaked.  Yippee. 
We had to put on wet clothes this morning for hiking.  Another fun aspect of through hiking.   The temps were cooler today so hiking was more comfortable.   We hit the Franconia Ridge trail in a complete fog with high winds.   See the video I posted.   It was hard to see because my glasses were dripping wet.  Needless to say my fear of heights was not a factor since I had no way to tell how high it was.   
We hit 800 miles today!  Amazing. 
Our original goal was the Garfield shelter but I wanted to push on to the Guyot shelter so that we could get food at the Galehead hut and so we’d have less mileage to do tomorrow in the rain.  Soup and a brownie!  I miscalculated because I thought the shelter was 0.2 miles from the AT when in fact it was 0.2 miles off the Bondcliff trail.  In total it was 0.8 miles (steep miles too) extra to the shelter.   It’s a beautiful shelter and brand new.   Same architect as the one at Kinsman Pond.   Clementine made it here as well after an even longer day than ours.  
I fell twice today breaking the tip off of one trekking pole and bending the tip on another.   The poles are fine though.  On the second fall I slipped on a long rock downhill and went full turtle upside down on my backpack.  My pack is ok but not sure about my back.  Some sleep and an Aleve and we’ll see. 
Tomorrow we’ll have a later morning I think and a shorter day.","Liberty Springs campsite

Today was the hike from hell.  I don’t like hiking in the cold rain and we had it in spades.   The day started with hard wind and a foggy rain.  I contemplated staying put at Guyot shelter but got overruled by Miles and Clementine.   Again, I hate hiking in the rain.   The worst of it waited until lunchtime.  We stopped at the Zealand Falls hut for all you can eat quesadillas for $10 but were told that they were out of cheese.   Crap.  We waited an hour until lunch.was served (tomato soup)  and then headed back out.  No rain for a while but the trail was so overgrown that we got soaked anyway.   I slipped on a rock or root or something and went down hard.  Nothing broken but wetter than I was.   We arrived at the Ethan Pond shelter around 2 pm.  A crappy little shelter with an obvious mouse problem.   It holds 6 but I suspect we will see many more than that tonight.   It was apparently built in 1957 and is the oldest back country shelter.   If I could have gotten a cell signal before Route 302 I would have called for a shuttle into town and maybe a hotel stay.  No dice.
I’m sitting here in the shelter with my wet clothes on trying to dry them out.

I had a rough start to the day.   Mice were crawling on my sleeping bag overnight which was fun.  The shelter was packed so the mice had their choice of hiker flavors. 
 Getting dressed involved putting yesterday’s wet clothes on because it was supposed to continue raining.   And it did.  And the temperatures dropped during the day so I had to keep hiking to keep warm. 
Climbing Webster cliffs was enough to warm me up but included some more of those semi-technical climbs where you have to use your hands and feet,  trekking poles,  roots, trees and whatever else you can find to pull yourself up and over the rocks.  Sometimes I had to slide on my butt downhill.   I had one fall today and I hope I didn’t crack my tailbone.   Things were really wet and slippery.   I pulled myself over one ledge and looked up and got poked in the forehead by a pointy rock.  
When I got to the first hut (Mizpah Spring hut) they gave me that mornings leftover pancakes and I got some clam chowder to warm me up.    I reconnected with KC and Rebbie from a while ago and KCs husband Jim.  They were heading to the Lake of the Clouds hut for the evening.   Since the temperatures were supposed to drop into the 30s and the rain was continuing I decided to push the extra 5ish miles to that hut.   I’ve been cold and wet long enough.
 This place is expensive (over $180),  bunks only, no showers or hot water.  No heat either except for what comes from the kitchen. Great food though.  We had a turkey dinner,  pumpkin soup, fresh bread and salad.   I’m walking around in my only dry socks because my shoes are soaked.   It’s so good to be warm.   
So my poor wife had to cancel her 4th of July picnic to come up and get me.  My older son Jake is coming too.  I’m very excited to see them.  Girl Friday is getting both of us off the top of Mt Washington and then she’ll deliver me somewhere Sue can grab me.  I asked Sue to bring me some clothes but we’re not sure anything will fit me.  Ha.  Videos are at https:/youtube.com/channel/UC","Ethan Pond shelter

Today marks the end of this incredible journey.   The top of Mt Washington seems fitting.   I thank Girl Friday for plucking Miles and me off the mountain.   
The trail here in the north certainly becomes more risky.  Often more like a climbing wall at the gym than a trail.  Sitting here in the Lake of the Clouds hut I've seen the aftermath of the falls people have experienced.   Multiple people with significant head bandaging or crutches.   And that's just from yesterday's hiking.  It's not worth the risk to me.  I've fallen several times but gotten lucky.  
The other thing I have seen and been told directly by every through hiker that started in Georgia is that they are just pushing miles now.  They aren't enjoying it but have ""too much invested in it to quit now"".  I didn’t anticipate this either and I don't want to get to that point. I very much admire the mental fortitude that keeps them going.  
What I've done has been great.  I believe I've gotten what I came out here for.
