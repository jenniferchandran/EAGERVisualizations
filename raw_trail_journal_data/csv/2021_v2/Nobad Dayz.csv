Nobad Dayz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634873,"Spent night zero at Stanimals Hostel in Waynesboro, VA. Great experience. Pilgrim picked me up from Charlottesville airport and got me squared away for fuel and a bunk. Several Youtubers I follow were also there for the night. Taylor the Nahamsha Hiker, Not Today and Happy. Hiked all day with one of my bunkmates, ""Paign"". Didn't see any of our other hostel companions on trail. Several got ahead of us, were slack packing or taking a zero.
Originally planned to camp at Calf Mountain shelter but it made for too short a day. (8mi).I hiked to the next waypoint in Guthooks, to hit my daily target of 10 miles during the first week. 
Dinner was a delicious Mountain House chicken fried rice augmented with olive oil. and freeze dried mint chip ice cream samich.","Rockfish Gap

Nobad Dayz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634902,"Low temp was 36F last night. Kinda wish I hadn't swapped out the winter cover for the bug net. Similar forecasts for the next few days. 
It occurred to me this hike reminded me of starting a triathlon.  Even after months of preparation, anxiety was huge waiting to start. But when I dove in and got in a rhythm, the dark water and swoosh of the water in my ears evaporated all the anxiety. The race was on and would be done in a few hours. Similar feeling today as I hiked.Last water was a mile before I camped last night, the next was 11 ahead at Blackrock, and I only had 1L left after cooking and cleaning up. They say the trail provides, and sure enough, a trail angel left about 6 gallons of water at one of the road crossings.
Arrived at Black rock hut first time staying at a shelter. Very rocky with lots of dead yes made picking a hang sure sporty. It's the weekend, so lots of weekend and section hikers in camp. I lost one of my Wal-crocs some place, so no camp shoes. Good thing it's not raining so not running around in wet hiking shoes. Weather is forecast about the same as last night. 
I have not figured out how to post pics here, so still doing on FB and Strava.","Sawmill Run Overlook

Nobad Dayz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635089,"Planned to stealth camp at Ivy Spring but decided to press . Water filter was hooked to outside pocket but feel off and lost. Luckily I ran into the section hikers I met at Stanimals. One of the ladies, Deacon was getting off trail and gave me her Sawyer squeeze. Turns out, this is the same group who left water at Turk Gap yesterday, and have pizza to Paign.
Fun night with the group. All section hikers for the weekend. Two, Flash and another guy are flipping down to Springer.","Black rock hut

Nobad Dayz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635362,"Biggest day so far. I'm  exceedng my planned average which isn't a good thing, but I feel great. Windy and cold all day. Actually had to add a lyer while hiking (blue actic long sleeve) still have needed the REI blue capeline. Dropped into Skyline Resort for a sandwich and power up my phone. Phone is losing power quickly and I need a new one.  Going to pay a fortune to get one retail, so will prob order on line and have Brenda forward. Staying at Open Arms Hostel in Luray hosted by Alison. Great place and accommodating hostess. My bunkmates were Ballpark, Rocket, and Jimmy. All are NOBO flip floppers a little behind me so we may join up again. Paign from day 1 is next door but he is not zeroing and is doing longer miles than I'm ready for.","Rock Spring Hut

Nobad Dayz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635364,"I'm finally caught up on the journal. Vistited AT Outfitters for fuel and picked up the AT pocket guide. AT guide pdf and Guthooks are must haves but not suitable for planning.  I resupplied for two days to Front Royal but may visit Walmart again and go longer for less town time. Temps in the 20 again tonight, so glad for the roof. Warming up again this week.  Hope to synch up with Rocky, Ballpark and Jimmy after they slack pack from Big Meadows.","Luray

Nobad Dayz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635844,"This was the end of a poorly anned day. I thought I could get support from the AT. Ok end Bear Den Rock. They didn't open till 5p and had only snacks. You'd think an ATC owned facility would be hiker friendly. But no even a ride to town.  I ended up resupply I g I  Clear blue at a tiny country store.  I bought all their tuna/salmon/chicken packets and mashed potatoes. Btw, I will add the Idahoan potatoes to my resupply list. Delicious, nutritious and super az.   Then second breakfast/lunch at a small diner. Opportunity to chat with some old timers who built several AT shelters back in the day. Damn. The roller coaster was tough. They say is is just a task of the rock on PA and climbo g in New England. This is a real nice facility but a 220 foot decent and the same coming up tomorrow. I woud not have stayed except I needed water. I finally learned not to carry water to water and am cameling up at the water sources. It keep the Katadyn on my shoulder strap. 4","

Nobad Dayz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635848,"Made it. Today was also tough. The weather has gotten warm, into the 80s and I was feeling it. My left foot has been swelling and developed some blisters on top of the foot. These last two days have been very rocky and the Lone Peaks are too soft on the bottom. At the out fitter in HF, I got some Altra Olympus. Stiffer Vibram outsole and thick padding. Still has the wide toe box I need and the zero drop which I don't. Probably still use the insoles. Met up again with Pagn who zeroed last night. We had dinner and he showed me around town.
 I missed the bus to Charles Town and Walmart, so I'll resupply in the morning and 5 mile or so nero (near zero)What a fiasco this has turned to. I called the bus to pick me up at 9 but the dispatcher forgot to tell the driver.  Heading to Walmart now and hopefully on trail only 2 hrs late. T-storms this afternoon and tonight. I may end up zero'ing here and start fresh in the morning.","Blackburn AT center

Nobad Dayz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635885,"I had a few delays this morning with my resupply in Charles Town and was finally walking out of town in the rain at 1330 with a 10 mile hike in front of me. I passed the Town Inn and decided to take a zero. Start fresh Friday, rain or shine. Break in my new shoes sight seeing to boot (sts). Sending my heavy sleep socks home to make more room home in the pack. Keeping the long johns and capelene shirt for a while longer.","

New shoes seem to have been a good purchase and are working well on trail. Met up with Hawk again for a short chat before he sped off. Also meet Quicksand, another YouTuber.Camping with some new flip floppers from HF. Survivor, Annie, and section hiker Nick. Hopefully some to stick with for a while.  Met the Trout family in HF. Parent and 5 kids age 11 to 17. We sang happy birthday to Stumbles (youngest) at breakfast. They've been on trail sin mid Feb and are letting 15-20 mile days.","Harpers Ferry

Nobad Dayz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636196,"Rain was not forecast till this afternoon so I strung the tarp on the ridgeline, but left it in its snakeskin so I could enjoy the stars last night. Just before dawn I heard the pitter patter of rain on my bugnet. Got the tarp staked out in time to keep my down dry. As a result, I got an early start today. Passed the 200 trail milestone at about the Mason Dixon line into Pennsylvania. Funny pic of a gal who pitched her tent right on trail to stay dry for second breakfast. Maybe first breakfast,becasut she had her stove running. Even though it drizzled most of the day, it was quite nice for hiking. Short day as planned so I could resupply in Waynesboro and get my Garmin cable at the PO. Another first a General delivery mail drop.","Raven Rock Shelter
