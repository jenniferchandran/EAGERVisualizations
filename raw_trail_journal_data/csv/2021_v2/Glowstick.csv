Glowstick,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636598,"I first learned about the Appalachian Trail while reading a book when I was about 8 years old. The idea of doing a thru hike took root in my mind. I wanted to hike the AT before I started high school. Then it was maybe after graduating high school. Then I got serious about sports, and I was accepted to college with a field hockey scholarship. That was another dream I had, and I decided to pause my dream of the AT to pursue college sports. but the AT never really left me alone. I was always thinking about it. I could always hear it calling. It was like an itch that was just out of reach. But I was busy in college; I had more going on than ever before, and I had to give school and field hockey my whole focus. After two years, I left school, completely burnt out and degreeless. For someone who has always identified as being intelligent and athletic, it was disheartening to have to leave like that. I felt lost. I didn't know what to do, where to go in life, or maybe even who I was anymore. I tried going back to school a few times, I got a few jobs, and during that time, I started facing a new challenge. I was exhausted, like a bone deep fatigue that wouldn't lift. I would sleep around 10-12 hours at night, wake up for a little bit, and have to nap for 4-6 more hours before I went back to sleep for the night. I could barely put thoughts together. I couldn't remember anything. I went to doctor after doctor until I finally got a diagnosis: Lyme Disease. I had to do long term antibiotics to get better because I had been dealing with it for so long, and it had gotten so bad. After 2 years, I was finally back to relatively normal. This time, when I went back to school, I chose online classes. I went part time. I got a part time job. I tried to keep a better balance, and earlier today, I clicked submit on my last final. As long as I pass my classes from this semester (which, knock on wood, I should), then I'm graduating with my Bachelor's in a few mere weeks. 
When my parents asked me what I wanted to do as a celebration, I jokingly said thru hike the AT. Once I said it out loud though, I realized that it was a real possibility. For the first time, I have the time, most of my energy back, and though I'm not in tip top shape right now, I can just take the beginning of my hike slow and build up my endurance. As I sat with the idea of actually starting a thru hike, I started getting more and more excited. I started pulling my old gear out of storage. I started going on longer walks every chance I got. I started planning what I would need and what I would need to get ready. I told myself that I was debating whether I would actually put this plan to action until I had really thought through all of the pros and cons, but that's a lie. As soon as those words slipped out of my mouth, I knew I needed to do this. 
So as classes end and I type this today, ready to shift my focus fully to the thru hike, my excitement continues to grow. I wake up each day looking forward to continue preparing. I'm planning to set out by the end of this month on a flip flop hike, and I'll keep updating this with news, as frequently as I can, as the journey unfolds.

Glowstick,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636924,"Well, today grades got updated... I had 3 classes this semester, and got 3 A's. I'd say that's good enough to graduate! With that (almost) official stamp of approval (they just need to review it and send a diploma), I'll be an official college grad. To celebrate, I figured it's probably time to register my hike. I went to the ATC page and filled out the form to register my hike as a northbound flip flop thru hiker, starting May 24 from Harper's Ferry. Tomorrow is going to be another day of shopping to get together any small stuff that I need for the trip. In only 2 days I'm leaving for the beach, then about a week there, coming back to pick up all the trail gear, and then we start on the trail. It feels surreal, but I'm still so excited. I'll update again before the start date to keep people up to date.

Glowstick,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637020,"Today is the beginning (sort of) of my trip. My dad is picking me up from Bel Air to stay the night at my Grandmother's house in PA. Tomorrow morning we're going to Bethany Beach as a graduation celebration, both for me, with my Bachelor's, and my brother with his PhD last year, since we never got to celebrate that all together. Next Saturday, we leave the beach to go back to my Grandmother's for a night again, then Sunday come back to Bel Air to pick up hiking gear. Sunday night we're driving out to Harper's Ferry, and Monday morning starts the trail. So today has been pretty crazy with my last few appointments squeezed in and some packing and planning everything. This will be a short entry since I have to get back to packing, but it's really setting in that I'm going to be on the Trail in less than two weeks!Signing out for now:Glowstick",,View Entry,"May 14, Fri",0
Glowstick,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638109,"We started out today from Harper’s Ferry. We stayed in a hotel close by the night before and woke up. We went to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy headquarters, where we wanted to sign in to the guestbook. Unfortunately the headquarters was closed because of Covid still, so we continued to the parking lot by the start of the trail. We got out with our gear, and after taking a lot of pictures, my mom, my dad, Pepper, and I started hiking across the bridge. After the bridge my dad and Pepper turned back to go to the car so that he could head to Charlottesville where he was meeting some friends for lunch the next day. The forecast said the weather was going to be rainy all day, end it was lightly misting when we started off, but we were in good spirits and excited to get going. The first 2.5 miles were on the C&O canal path, so it was nice and easy and flat once we turned off the path the trail started climbing. After sweating an amount equal to the rain which had been soaking us, we decided it was time to put on rain gear. We passed Ed Garvey shelter, about 6 miles from the start, and kept pushing on. We kept hiking, taking short breaks on the uphills when necessary, trying to hide under tree cover to avoid the worst of the rain, but for the most part we focused on moving forward towards the shelter where we could finally lie down. We got to Gathland State Park, which was less than half a mile from the shelter we planned to stay at with relief. Our feet, legs, backs, and it felt like everything else hurt, and we passed the road where there was a field with a pavilion with a bunch of picnic tables under it. There was a sign there saying “shelter use by permit only”, which had us confused, since it didn’t mention anything about a second shelter, but it didn’t say anything about needing a permit either. We decided to continue, but after going up another 5 or 10 minutes up the trail, we thought maybe that was the shelter after all, and decided to head back down the hill to the pavilion. There were two other hikers there having their dinner, who we’d been playing leap frog with throughout the day. We were cold and wet and tired, but we got out our food bags and stove, excited to at least have a hot meal to warm us up some. We sat down (still in wet hiking clothes since we weren’t 100% sure that we would stay the night there) and I screwed the stove top into the fuel canister. The fuel comes out with a hiss, so you know when you can light it, but it started hissing as I was still screwing it in, and the valve was closed. I unscrewed it a little bit and tried opening the valve, but no hiss. We tried for 10 minutes, but couldn’t figure it out, so we thought, “cold dinner it is”. Luckily, mom asked one of the other hikers for her help, and she screwed it in and kept screwing past when the fuel hisses out a little bit, since that only happens for a little bit. Beyond relieved to have hot dinner back on the menu, and crowding around the stove for what little warmth we could gather, we cooked our pasta. We discussed what we were going to do that night, and while the other hikers decided to push on, and try to find the shelter, we were just too exhausted and cold. We found a little cutout in the trees surrounding the field to set up the tent so it wouldn’t be visible from the road and set everything up. Once we were in dry clothes (every layer possible), and curled up in sleeping bags in the tent, we started gaining some warmth back. It was only around 8:30, but after the hike and the cold, wet conditions, we fell to sleep almost immediately. 
In mom’s the words, “today was a sucky success”. I couldn’t agree more.

Glowstick,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638119,"We woke up early, since we were technically camped illegally and wanted to pack up before anyone saw us (which was good because by the time we set off on the trail an hour or so later they were cutting the grass in the field). It was really foggy out, and the state park where we had stayed was an old civil war battlefield, so it looked kind of eerie, but pretty neat also. We had breakfast, put on clothes and (wet) shoes, packed up everything and started up the hill. We met some more people, both going northbound and southbound. It seems like hiking Maryland is a popular option, so we got to chat with lots of people. We took more frequent stops today, resting and taking our packs off when possible. By the time we got to a backpacker’s campground, just over half way through the planned hike for the day, my feet were cramping and knees hurting. It was only 2-2:30, but we considered stopping there for the day. We ate lunch as we debated what to do, but ultimately pushed on to get to the next shelter, figuring if we didn’t make it all the way there, we could always stop and camp along the trail somewhere. From there, the ground started to get rocky. I’ve always heard that Pennsylvania was a rocky state, nicknamed Rocksylvania or Painsylvania by hikers, but damn the trail today was brutal on my already sore feet. We finally made it in to the shelter around 7:30, which was actually earlier than we were expecting, but was good since it was still light. The hikers we kept leap frogging with from the day before, and again today, were also there at the shelter, and we found out they came to hike all the way from Seattle! We eventually headed to bed again, tired from the long day.

",Pine Knob Shelter,"May 25, Tue",12.50
Glowstick,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638151,"We got up from our campsite near the shelter and cooked breakfast. Originally we’d been planning to go to the second shelter, but after yesterday, we decided to go the 8ish miles to the first one and stay there instead of pushing for the 13 mile one. When we went past the shelter to get water, our friends from Seattle said they had changed their plans as well, originally they wanted to reach the further shelter but the day before had just been too brutal to do another long day. We filtered water for the first time this morning, since the previous days, we’d been right by potable water pumps. It started out hot, even at 9am when we left camp, and it didn’t help that we started on an uphill. We took it slow, still slowly recovering from the past two days. We were optimistic, though, hopeful that the weather and trail would be nicer. We didn’t get far before realizing that wouldn’t be the case though. The trail had a lot of decently sized ups and downs, and before long they got rocky again, slowing our progress significantly and taking a toll on my knees and feet again. We stopped for a cold lunch still, since we knew we’d drag without one, but we both just wanted an easy and early day. We switched places with our friends from Seattle a few times throughout the hike. The hardest part of the day though, was the section at the end, because, usually, there are landmarks noted in the guidebook, which you pass every mile or less, but the last part of the day was a 4.8 mile section with no landmarks. It was a lot more difficult than we would have thought not to be able to pinpoint more clearly where we were and how far we still had to go for the day. It was during this time, while we were walking on a ridge with some sparse tree cover, that we heard thunder for the first time. It was far away and almost didn’t register for me. The second time, a few minutes later, I knew what was coming, but hoped we’d have some time to get further, since the sky was still so sunny. Within 5 minutes though, the thunder was essentially right overhead, and of course the ridge where we were had cleared of trees, so it was just us and some big boulders and big drops of rain making the rocks more slippery. Luckily that section didn’t last long, and we soon were able to duck under the cover of the trees once more, which was good because the next lightning strike was within a mile, close enough that we could hear the crackle before the thunder. It wasn’t the most comfortable I’ve ever felt during a storm, I have to admit haha. That line of storms moved past rather quickly, and we had a new fire lit under us to get to the campsite and set up before the next round could start. We finally made it to camp and got the tent up about 15 minutes before the next storm rolled in, so we got pretty lucky there. We were too exhausted to cook a hot meal, so we again just ate cold food before crawling into sleeping bags and letting sleep claim us.

Glowstick,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638153,"Last day of Maryland! We started early, since we were aiming to get to Pen Mar park by 5 to meet my dad and Pepper. The weather was much nicer, still a little hot, but sunny and no rain predicted. We’d heard good things about the trail ahead from some southbound hikers the night before, and it kept us in good spirits, hoping today would be the best day of the trip. We set off after breakfast and started with a climb. There were some amazing views, and at the first viewpoint, we saw the first snake of the trip (yikes), it was just soaking up the sun on a rock, which I could understand, so we just avoided it and went to see the view (although I wasn’t a fan of when we turned to go back down the rocks and it was gone). Since it was hot, I was drinking lots of water, which is obviously good to stay hydrated...not so good when I suggested we passed the first 3 springs we came to because they were all right before big uphills and I didn’t want to carry the extra weight. Needless to say, after drinking my 2.5L of water in the first 2 or 3 hours, I ran out, and of course we had now passed all of the water sources for the day. I’ll file that under oopsie, and say lesson learned: don’t pass up springs on a hot day. All of the views today were amazing. We went from rocky overlooks to open meadows to peaceful streams. The sun was shining and there was a nice breeze. We met our first ridge runner along the way, he works for the ATC, which I think would be a pretty cool job to have. The second big climb of the day came before we were planning to stop for lunch, so there was motivation to get it over with, and once we got to the top, we were rewarded with having lunch at High Rock, where we could see out for miles. The descent from High Rock was the one we’d been warned about as being difficult and rocky, and it didn’t disappoint in either of those categories. It was the first time we really had to search for trail blazes multiple times, since we were going through rock fields and going over and around big boulders. It seemed like it lasted forever, but eventually we made it to the bottom and the trail evened out some. We had another short uphill and downhill before we would be free on a flat section to the park. On that flat section, we saw dad’s blue shirt and big grin, telling us that we were only 10 minutes from the park. Pepper didn’t recognize us at first, but once she smelled us and remembered who we were (not sure how she did that when we smelled so bad haha) she was back to her usual enthusiastic (aka jumping and teething) self. We walked with them back to the park, took some pictures with the sign, put our packs in the car, and walked the last few tenths of a mile to the MD - PA border. This is the first state I’ve completed in one trip, but I know there’s more to come. I’m glad we ended on this good day, since it reminds me why I’m here. It may be hard to be without friends, family, and pets, but on days like today, it makes it all worth it. I’m going to take a few days off in a hotel to let my feet rest and let my blisters heal some, but I’ll check in the next time I have some updates.

Glowstick,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638264,"After 2 full zero days where I stayed at a hotel in Gettysburg, I’m feeling a lot better. The couple of blisters on my toes are healing well, which is a relief since foot issues is one of the main causes for thru hikers to have to stop. I got a shuttle from the hotel back to Pen Mar park, where I got my shoes on, made sure my pack was organized, and set off for the day. I’m focusing on doing at least a few short days to make sure my feet are all the way healed and I get used to my pack and everything. So today I was only going to the next shelter, which was 5 miles, and going to take it nice and slow. It was very overcast the whole day, and I wanted to get to the shelter before any rain that was going to come. I started off with my rain coat on, since I wasn’t sure what the weather would decide to do, but it was getting too hot so I ended up taking it off and just leaving my pack cover on. I stopped for a rest at the top of the big climb for the day and met Patrick, who’s also just starting his flip flop hike. Near the bottom of that downhill, I met Rollie Pollie, a NoBo hiker who started in Georgia. I talked to her for probably 10 minutes, hearing some of her fun stories from the trail so far, and we started walking while we talked (I realized after a while she was cooking and I was supposed to be taking it easy on my feet), but eventually we parted ways and she continued on ahead. Not too long after that, I made it to the shelter, where I put on my other set of clothes and cooked a hot dinner to try to recover some heat. It was so cold I decided to get right into my sleeping bag, even though it was only 3pm. I snoozed on and off throughout the day, so that tomorrow I’ll have lots of energy.","MD - PA border

Glowstick,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638332,"Today was another short hike, only 3.6 miles. I had a lazy morning and just hung out around camp, making breakfast, filling water, and soaking up the sun. I got all packed up and left around noon, taking my time with the climb out of camp. I was really in the green tunnel, so I didn’t get any views, but it was nice and shady from the sun, there was a breeze, and the trail bed was less rocky than the previous days had been, so I can’t really complain. I stopped for lunch at a park with picnic tables and water, and met a hiker who’s spent a lot of time in the area, and gave me some tips about the upcoming days. She also gave me an uncrustables pb&j, which was a wonderful addition to lunch. After the park was another uphill to get to the shelter where I stayed the night, but it wasn’t too bad of a climb. I made it to the shelter by 3:30 and just relaxed for a bit. I actually got to meet the caretakers for this shelter, since they hiked up to check on how it was doing. It’s another shelter where there are actually 2 shelter buildings, and the caretakers put signs on them, one for “snorers”, the other “non snorers”. They also put a doorbell on the outside of the privy and a light switch on the inside, labeled with solar and lunar. They’re all pretty funny additions. I set up camp and made dinner, then just relaxed until I went to sleep.","Deer Lick Shelter

Glowstick,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638505,"I woke up late again and had a leisurely morning in camp. Eventually I got everything packed up and filled up every water container I had (including bringing dirty water in my dirty water containers), since I’d heard that Rocky Mountain shelter’s water source was like half a mile down a steep hill. That was probably true, but what they failed to mention is that the shelter itself is also almost half a mile down and backwards from the way I just came. I was not a very happy camper, but I got all my stuff out and spent the night in the shelter, since I was there anyway.","Tumbling Run Shelter
",Rocky Mountain Shelter,"Jun 01, Tue",6.60
Glowstick,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638506,"The walk from last night’s shelter to the trail was...frustrating, and there were a lot of choice words said. Who decided that putting the shelter down that much further was a good idea? And why wasn’t that mentioned in the guide. Anyway, after climbing a bunch just to START the day, the rest of the morning went pretty smoothly. There were a few boulder fields that I had to get through, but they were pretty short. I got to the State Park to have lunch at the picnic tables by the stream there, and filled up my water supply. Leaving the park, there was a stone staircase and a sign at the bottom marked “most difficult”. It seemed like the climb took forever, and I was pouring sweat the whole time. At the top was a mercifully flat, wide, and even stretch of trail. For the last half mile of the day, I started to climb again, which is a b*tch at the end of the day when you’re tired. It was pretty though, it was basically a tunnel through rhododendron bushes. I got to the shelter and I have to say, I’d give it 8 stars out of 5. There are covered picnic tables, a beautiful fire pit, 2 shelters for 4 people each (and which have a roof between them as well to cover another picnic table), 2 raised tent platforms, a hanging swing, a roll down protective screen to save you from wind or rain at the picnic table, games, hanging flowers, and a flower bed next to the privy. It really doesn’t get better than this, I don’t think. I also got to meet some really cool people at camp. There’s a group of 3 guys in their early 70s who have stayed friends and continued hiking together since their kids were in scouts together (those kids are in their 40s now). I also met Molasses and Proton. Proton is a thru hiker who started in Georgia and Molasses is a flip flop hiker, but she started in Shenandoah national park instead of at Harper’s Ferry. We sat around the camp fire and talked until it got dark and then got ready for bed. It was a really good day.","Rocky Mountain Shelter
",Quarry Gap Shelter,"Jun 02, Wed",5.60
Glowstick,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638508,"With rain on the forecast for the afternoon, everyone at the shelter was trying to get out early, myself included. I hit the road by 8, which was much earlier than I’ve even woken up the last few days. We started the day with an uphill (I see a theme forming here), which I just took slow and steady with plenty of water breaks. There were lots of landmarks to look forward to and track my progress today, which was really nice to have and really helps with motivation. The trail leveled out after that first climb and I got into a good groove. I saw some paper held down with rocks on the trail and thought it was weird, so I stopped to see what it said, and nearly sh*t myself because what it said was: “rattlesnake up on right of trail!!! Beware!” It was dated the day before (which helped me not lose my mind), but I walked veeerrrrrrrrrryy slowly for the next quarter or half mile, my head on a swivel and listening like my life depended on it. I made plenty of noise and talked aloud to let any snakes in the area know that I was there and hoping that they were having a good nap, away from me, far, far, away from me, and that they were more than welcome to stay far away from me while I just sneak past. Luckily, I saw no snakes, so eventually I sped up again. There were a few more up and down hills, but eventually I made it to camp, the earliest I’ve done so far on the trail, and I had my tent set up by 12:30, which was about 5-10 minutes before it started raining, so I’d say good timing. The unfortunate part of this shelter was the lack of cell service, and when you get to camp at 12:30 and are left with nothing to do while it rains, it drives you a little bit insane. The same 3 guys were at this camp site ass well, and they eventually set up another fire in the fire pit. We all stood around and talked until it got dark and started raining again.","Quarry Gap Shelter
",Birch Run Shelter,"Jun 03, Thu",7.40
Glowstick,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638788,"So today was a long day. I’ve been saying that I’m taking some easy days to let my feet heal fully and get my trail legs under me, and then slowly increase miles once I’m ready. I had planned to go to the next shelter today, Tom’s Run, which was 6.2 miles from the previous shelter. From the forecast the previous morning (since I couldn’t get the updated one without service), it was supposed to rain on and off all day. I wasn’t really planning on getting up super early, but all the other hikers got up early and I woke up to them, so I figured I might as well get on the road. I got going by 8:45, with, you guessed it, an uphill. At the top of the uphill, someone had a tent of trail magic set up. They invited me to stop for a snack and I got to have some watermelon and a cold soda, so thank you mama pasta! It turned out that it was one of the hikers moms that had set up everything for the day. The hikers I met today were all really cool and funny. They were a big group, probably around 10 people, so they call themselves the horde. I can’t remember all of their names, but there was Mountain Goat, Squid, Dirty Pasta (her mom set up the trail magic for the day), and a bunch of others, but I’m bad with names. A few more hikers joined within the next few minutes, Cheese and Bilbo. There was also another hiker coming southbound, who said there was also no service at the next shelter. Now I’m in a pickle. I know my parents will want me to check in, I have to get in touch with the Maryland home base because I’m planning to meet with one of them Monday to get my prescription, and most importantly, I’m waiting to hear back from my doctor about if she changed the prescription yet or if I’m using the old one. There’s a state park another 3-4 miles past the next shelter, and I figured they would probably have reception. But that was much further than I planned. But I checked my watch and it was still early, so I figured I might as well try. I passed the official halfway point for the trail this year, and the marking for 1100 miles. I kept a fast pace going and got to the first shelter before noon, so I was averaging close to 2mph. With it still being so early, I decided I might as well go for it, though I was able to get enough signal to send check-ins to different people, and see that my doc hadn’t responded yet. Nevertheless, I continued on to the park. This park has the AT museum as well as the general store that hosts the half gallon challenge. I got to the park around 2 I think, and ended up ordering some fries and a quesadilla there. The group that I had met earlier in the day got there shortly after me, and all of them started on the half gallon challenge. I’m pretty sure most of them finished (proud, but with a lot of regret). I went to the AT museum, which was pretty cool, since it had info on the history of the At, a snapshot of each state, and some other stories about records and things like that. They also had the original signs from Springer, the halfway marker, and Katadhin. After a little while there, I packed up and was trying to decide if I should get a campsite at the park or continue on, since I could already feel blisters forming. There were two marked campsites on the path to the next shelter, so I figured I might as well try my best to continue forwards. So, I got my pack on and started (gingerly) up yet another hill. Uphill was definitely the most painful for my blisters, and I passed an unmarked campsite partway up the hill, but I didn’t really want to have to start the next morning with the rest of that climb, so I decided to keep going to the marked campsite, which was located near the top of this climb. When I finally got there, I saw that it was essentially a one tent campsite, and there was already one person there. There was really no other option but to go to the next campsite, so I pushed forwards. Another climb led me to that campsite, but all of the tent spots looked like they had rocks and roots and were slanted. It didn’t look very appealing. I had two options: suck it up and set up my tent in the best one I could find, or get to the shelter which was another few miles away. It was getting later in the day by this point, around 6, and I knew sunset was at 8:30, but being in the woods, it would get darker much earlier than that. I decided screw it, I’ll take a rest day tomorrow to apologize to my feet for the extra abuse I’m about to put on them and started up again, going about as fast as I had been in the beginning of the day. I finally got to the shelter turnoff, where it said the shelter was 0.2 miles east. Let me tell you, that was more like 0.4 miles, which was very annoying at the time. But I arrived at around 7:30, just as it was starting to get dark. I quickly cooked dinner and got ready for bed after sending another round of check-in texts. I was pretty exhausted at that point, and went to sleep quickly. I was woken up at some point in the middle of the night to coyotes calling to each other, which was fun to experience, but at least they weren’t right next to me or anything. Anyway, as I said at the beginning of this post...it was a really long day.","Birch Run Shelter
",James Fry Shelter,"Jun 04, Fri",17.10
Glowstick,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638789,"My rest day. The zero day I had planned after the looonnnnggg hike yesterday. But I think we’ve established by now that I’m not the best at following plans. I was thinking about the long trek just to get back to the trail, and having to add that on to the next day’s hike, and decided I should at least try to get to the campsite on the other side of the trail (which I should have just stayed at in the first place). I packed slowly and put lots of baby powder on my feet, put my shoes on, and started off again. It wasn’t incredibly painful, so I decided I might as well try to get to the next campsite, so that I could make the next day easier. I took it nice and slow, refilled my water at a creek I came across, and eventually made it to camp. Hiker Harrison was there (I’d met him at Rocky Mountain shelter...aka the shelter which shall not be named because we regret going downhill that far just to get to a shelter), and so were two other hikers, Ellie and Hiccup. They were similar to me, since Ellie had always wanted to do the trail, and her dad Hiccup was starting with her, then would go back home. They were also flip flopping the trail, but were making great time, since they’d started a full week after me. There was apparently a rock concert going on just down the road from the last road we’d crossed, so we got to listen to music for the entire evening and into the night. I also tied my first bear bag up, with Hiccup’s help. I used a rock to throw the rope over the tree branch, and of course I was holding the sharp edge of the rock, so I sliced my finger (oops, hopefully bears aren’t attracted to blood). But I got back into the tent and went to sleep with background music playing.","James Fry Shelter

Glowstick,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638790,"Today’s plan was to make it to Alec Kennedy shelter, which is the last shelter before Cumberland Valley. In the 18.2 mile stretch between Alec Kennedy and Darlington (the next shelter), there is no camping allowed, either, except at the backpacking campground about 3.5 miles past Alec Kennedy. So my goal was to stay at Alec Kennedy for the night, another short day, and that would set me up for the hike the 11-12 miles into Carlisle the next day to meet Jen. I started around 10, after  taking down my bear bag (it stayed up all night so I call that a success), making breakfast, then taking down camp. The entire day was just hills, not really much flat between the campground and the next shelter, but I started my trudge up the first hill (seriously, does someone have something against going downhill to start the day??), and I saw that the landmark at the top of the hill is listed as “rock maze”, which I found weird, because I’d been through many rock and boulder fields and they’d never been marked in the trail guide before, but when I came to the top I understood. This wasn’t a rock field. This was a cluster of rocks the size of a house and I had to go through them, because going around them would be no fun, of course. I stopped to catch my breath and curse whoever marked the trail, and then started in. To be fair, it was more fun than I expected, and though there was a lot of maneuvering needed, I didn’t have to take my pack off to throw it ahead at any point, which I’ll count as victory, though I did have to drop my trekking poles ahead a few times and use my hands to hold the rock walls on both sides to shimmy down. The next rock maze was similar, and then it was normal downhill and uphills for the rest of the day. I got to the side trail for the shelter around 1, and it was 0.2 miles (although that’s what the last one said as well and I don’t believe that at all, so I was skeptical), but looked mostly uphill. I didn’t want to do any more uphill than strictly necessary, and it was early enough that I figured I could push on to the backpacker’s campsite (who needs plans anyway, am I right?). There was one last hill between the shelter and the campsite, then the remainder was mercifully flat. So I climbed up to the summit, and just before the summit there was a side trail with a view marked. There hadn’t been any marked views in a while, and I figured I have time, and my feet aren’t exactly happy, but they’re not killing me yet, so I decided to leave my pack and go the 0.4 miles to the view. It did feel good to walk some without the pack, and it was along this ridge where I could almost see the views over the valley off to the left, but I call BS on the 0.4 miles. It was much farther than that. I honestly thought about turning around and going back a few times, but I knew that if I did that, this amazing view of the valley would be at the next rock cluster, and I’d have turned away so close to it, so I pushed on, even though I was getting frustrated, but I could see sneak peaks of the valley with the mountains in the background off to the left between the trees and I just knew shower>span class=""s1""> the next day in town, so I laid down and got some sleep to get me through the day.","Unnamed Campsite

Glowstick,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638791,"First of all...HAPPY BIRTHDAY DAD! I hope you’re having a good day!I woke up excited today because today’s the day I get a real shower! I packed everything up quickly and got started. I didn’t have much water with me, but I knew that within the first half mile, I’d be passing one of the local ATC headquarters, which has a spigot of clean drinking water on the side of the house for hikers to refill at, so I wasn’t worried. Unfortunately, they had turned off their water, and the next water wasn’t until halfway through the day, just over 4 miles from camp, and it was HOT. This was the second time of running out of water, and even though there were,mercifully, no climbs to deal with, the day was spent going in and out of open fields exposed to the sun. When I finally reached the stream I was just about ready to stick my head in and start gulping, but I managed to fill my dirty water bottle and drink straight from the filter, then fill my regular water bottle and drink down almost 3 cups, and then I could finally think about refilling the water in my pack. Freshly fueled, and ready to get to the hotel, I set back off, happily drinking water this time. The next half of the trip was a pretty easy one, and before I knew it, I got to the bridge to cross rt 11 to get into Carlisle. It’s the first town I’ve walked into, and the first one I stopped at since Gettysburg. I got to the hotel with perfect timing, around 2:15 (check in starts at 2), got the key for my room, put all my things in, and sat on a chair. That was pretty nice. I pulled some gear out of my bag to let it start airing out, let myself stop sweating, and then, finally, got to take a shower. Jen came a little while later with the resupply and meds, and we caught up and got dinner from a local diner. It sure felt good to be clean and comfy to get to sleep!
I’m going to be in town for a few days to let my blisters recover, but I’ll update once I start out again!","Backpacker Campsite

Glowstick,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639145,"I woke up this morning around 8, which was earlier than I had intended, because I did most of my packing last night, so I had a lazy start to the day, ate some breakfast, finished packing, and checked out of the hotel where I was staying. I walked back down the road to the side trail up to the AT, retied my shoes to make sure they were snug (and hopefully not create more blisters), stretched some more, then put my pack back on and started off. As a side note, I’d completely forgotten what it was like to have a pack with a full food bag and water, phew, I miss walking into town on Monday with what felt like a 5 pound bag! Today’s feels like it’s 500 pounds. Anyway, the first 4 miles were pretty flat, and it continued to drizzle and rain. Eventually, I got to the edge of the valley, and started to gain elevation. The whole uphill was about 2 miles, about a mile of which was a bit steep. I wanted to get to the shelter by around 3, because that’s when the rain was supposed to pick up. I wasn’t sure how fast I’d be hiking since it was my first day back from town, but I went faster than I though I would once I stretched out some more, so I ended up at the shelter with my tent set up by 2:30. The rain really picked up after that, so I cooked dinner in the vestibule of my tent, cleaned up, put my food away in the bear box, and got comfortable in my tent. I drifted in and out of sleep, and multiple times during the night, it was raining so hard that the noise actually woke me up it was so loud on the tent. All I can say is that I’m glad I was already in my tent and not trying to set it up still.","Carlisle, PA
",Darlington Shelter,"Jun 11, Fri",6.30
Glowstick,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639412,"Today was (yet another) day that did not quite go according to plan. The weather that I had seen most recently called for possible thunderstorms after 3, so I wanted to get in to camp with my tent set up before then. I set out early, hiking slowly, and eventually picked up some speed. I finally got to start on a downhill (and it figures that it would be on a day after rain when all of the rocks are super slippery). The day was dominated by one long uphill, and of course the only water source was right before it, so I got to climb it with lots of extra weight. When I got to the top, the guidebook noted that the trail would be rocky for the next 4-5 miles. I spent a lot of time looking at my feet, trying to make sure I didn’t break a leg, but I thought that I was looking up often enough to keep up with my surroundings. Evidently not. From the marked beginning of the rocks was 2.6 miles to the shelter. After nearly 2 hours, I was really feeling like I’d gone too far, but there was also a trail I was supposed to hit first, and I hadn’t seen that either. So I kept hiking, thinking the rocks must have slowed me down much more than I thought. When I got to the steep downhill though, I knew that I’d messed up. The downhill to the view at Hawk Rock and then down past it was 2 miles past the shelter where I was supposed to stop. I had two choices: 
Walk back to the shelter that i’d planned to stay at. Keep going (essentially straight down, an equally steep uphill, then the remainder of the downhill) another 2 miles to get to the next town, Duncannon, where the AT passes right through the town center. 
I chose the option to continue forwards, and got into town where I booked a hotel room and went out to grab some dinner before settling back into my room for the night. It never did end up raining.","Darlington Shelter
","Duncannon, PA","Jun 12, Sat",11.30
Glowstick,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639413,"Leaving Duncannon, I was tired. I hadn’t officially decided on which shelter to go to for the day. The closer was about 4 miles and the farther was around 11. I was hoping to get to the second shelter, because that would put me in great position to be in Jonestown on Wednesday for my resupply. The weather said that starting at 2 was a high chance of showers and thunderstorms, so I wanted to get out and start early, but I ended up stopping at a breakfast place called “Goodies”, and got some French toast and eggs, which was all delicious. While o was there, one of the other customers was telling us that his sister lived a little bit west of Duncannon, and the thunderstorms had already started there, which meant that they were likely to get to us by noon rather than 2. I hustled after learning that, and finished making my way through Duncannon and across the bridge over the Susquehanna, then up into the mountains again. Even walking through town I just had no energy, and the initial climb from the bridge back into the mountains was just brutal and took what little energy I had left. I knew that I wasn’t going to make it to the second shelter, since I’d left at 10 am, and even just doing those 4 miles, took me over 3.5 hours. I resigned to the fact that I was staying there and set up my tent. Luckily, there were a few sites right next to the trail. Unluckily, those sites were all pretty rocky. “How bad could it be?” I thought, “it’s just for one night”. I’d like to tell my future self never to challenge the universe like that again. The rocks were bad. I couldn’t get comfortable and ended up falling asleep around midnight, then the storms finally hit around 1:30-2:00 am instead if pm, and the rain was actually so loud it woke me up. I woke up again at 3:30 and dozed on and off until 4, but couldn’t get back to sleep. Finally, at 6, I decided screw it I’ll just get up and get started, since last I’d heard, there was supposed to be rain the next day too.","Duncannon, PA
",Clarks Ferry Shelter,"Jun 13, Sun",4.30
Glowstick,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639415,"Picking up where my last post left off, I got up at 6, which was earlier than I wanted to start, but I made breakfast and started slowly organizing and packing. Right before I started packing up, I actually saw a skunk. It came from the path to the shelter, and it continued up the AT when it got to the junction (part of my tired brain wondered if I would see it at the next shelter since it was going on the trail too). I knew that the next shelter’s water source was down a steep slope made up of “300 stone steps” according to the ATC, but which most people commented was more like between 500-600. Even if I made it to the campsite after that, there would be no water at that campsite either. So I walked down the hill with all of my treatment equipment and ended up at the piped spring, which had a flow rate of approximately 10 drops per minute. It took me a full hour to filter my two containers of water and to fill up my dirty bottles so that I could filter those later when need be. I ended up calculating the weight of the water when I need to use this method and figured out that it’s approximately 11 pounds of water that I’m adding to my pack. Anyway I went back and finished packing everything up, and though I’d seen the predicted weather was rainy and cloudy, it looked bright and sunny as could be. I decided to check the weather again, and the updated version said sun all day until 10-11 when it would get rainy, and possible thunderstorms after midnight. “Perfect”, I thought, “I’ll be able to get some good miles in and not get drenched”. I put my pack on (it really did feel like I put a couple bricks in there with the extra water) and headed up the trail. It was another day with some longer stretches between landmarks, but the sun was shining and it wasn’t oppressively humid, so I was in a pretty good mood. I got to the next shelter by 2, and figured that it was plenty early enough that I could push on and get to the campsite just over 5 miles away. So I had a quick snack and set off again, and 10 feet up the trail I saw a long black tail on the ground…it was a snake. Luckily it was a rat snake, so not venomous at least, but it was a solid 4-5 feet long. We stared at each other for a few minutes before he decided to leave, since I wasn’t going to pass him first. I got to a lookout around 3:30, which was 2.4 miles to go to the campsite destination. Just before the lookout I saw my first bear of the trip…don’t worry mom it was a dog named Bear, but I think it counts. Anyway, I wasn’t too worried about timing, since I was thinking it’s still likely to get there between 5-6, and I knew that I hadn’t been taking enough breaks throughout the day the previous days (I’m more of the person who gets to the destination and then relaxes), so I figured I should sit down, have a snack, and just enjoy the view and relax. I ended up lying on a nice big rock in the sun, using my pack as a pillow, until just before 4, when I noticed it wasn’t that bright anymore. I packed up everything and started walking. I glanced up, because I was wondering why it had gotten so much darker and saw the sky covered in storm clouds. I froze, confused, because the thunderstorms weren’t supposed to start until after midnight, but the sky didn’t look like it had gotten that memo, so I checked the weather again quickly, and saw that the forecast had changed, and there were now severe thunderstorm warnings in effect until 9. Now I knew that I had to get moving, because what I was wearing was my set of dry clothes. I started off at a brisk walk, and quickly got to the section of ridge that was exposed, no trees. By that point the wind had picked up, and it was that strong pre-storm wind that whips around everywhere, so it seemed like the storms were really rolling in. I broke into a light jog a couple of times, determined to get to the campsite I planned for. Going across one of the exposed ridges though, I landed wrong on my ankle and twisted it. I’d come close to twisting it many times on the rocks so far, but had always been able to get my weight into my other leg so I didn’t actually hurt the ankle. I wasn’t so lucky this time, and so I actually rolled it. It hurt, but clearly wasn’t broken, and I didn’t want to stop on the ridge, and I knew I had to get to camp, so I pushed on (slower than before). By this point it had started drizzling a few different times, and I had no idea how long the storms would hold off. I was still on the ridge, but luckily there were many more trees around by this point. There are usually a lot of unmarked campsites along the side of the trail, from other campers who set their tents out and made a fire ring, so I decided it was time to admit I wouldn’t make it to the original campsite and aim for the first unmarked one that I could find. I found one that looked decent and picked the first tent site I found. It takes me around 5 minutes to set my tent up, and about halfway through it, another hiker was walking up the trail and stopped to say, “hey, I just wanted to let you know, I don’t think he’s coming this way or anything, but there was a rattlesnake like right back there. So I guess just like don’t leave any containers out for it to snuggle up into, but I just wanted to warn you about that”. I thanked him as he walked away but my mind was racing. I wondered if I should deconstruct my tent and try to keep pushing forward, or should I stay at this campsite and just be extra careful. I decided to stay, since I was mostly done setting up the tent. I made a quick dinner, went out and tied up my bear bag up, and collapsed back in my tent, waiting for the storms, which ended up not arriving until after midnight.","Clarks Ferry Shelter
