SueBee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629948,"Our first steps on the AT with a full pack. Exhilarating, Sherri and I  skipped along up to Lion's head in CT to be greeted with hundreds of dragon flies and a beautiful view.  Mountain Laurel was blooming all along the way. Riga shelter has an awesome view, looks like a great sunrise location.  Next up Bear Mountain, took a rest, very hot, hot day.  Met some nice people from CT, some Dad's out hiking with their family on Father's day. Made it down to Sage's Ravine to CT-MA border! We were thrilled to see the MA sign and enjoy the cooling waters and the sound of the water.  Many bugs were on us and we had out bug nets.  A teenage girl gave us the look, I chuckled.  We could have fallen asleep right there near the sounds of the water. Made it up Mt. Race, beautiful walking along the ridge line overlooking the forest below.  Called my husband with an ETA, I had no idea really.  It took three hours to get from Mt. Race down Race Brook Falls Trail to the trail head.  This took way longer than I thought, I learned to account for off AT miles in the hike. Finished at 8:00pm, summer solstice.","CT Rt. 41 Undermountain Rd 1502.8

I knew the trail I was in for today, having come down it the night before.  Race brook falls, I don't think I want to see that trail again too soon. I was still wired, and probably dehydrated due to the heat.  We headed up, and saw a porcupine right away, I have never seen one in the wild.  Sherri and I both missed the AT sign at the top of the trail and we went South instead of North for a little bit.  I have to admit, I wasn't thinking to clearly from the start.  Climbed up Bear Mountain again, then reversed in the right direction, up Mt. Everett.  I had to stop quite often and breathe deeply.  I did lighten my pack from the day before.  I literally would just stop and sit wherever, I had to take deep breaths and try to cool down. I had gone over the AWOL guide and mapped out a little, I also had the Guthooks app but really wasn't proficient at it yet.  When we got to Elbow trail, the sign said Rt 7.  I looked at Guthhooks and Mt. Bushnell was coming up next.  I said to Sherri, I can't do another mountain, let's get off here.  I called my husband Nick and asked him to pick us up at the Berkshire school in about 20 minutes.  We timed this one better, we got out at about 5pm. We were beat, hot, blistered, and thirsty.  Nick has picked up some food.  Chicken soup and pizza.  The chicken soup was surprisingly just what I needed even though it was so hot.  Heading out again September 5, as long as weather is favorable.","Race Brook Falls 1513.8

SueBee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630533,"Awoke at 4:30am and met Sherri(Summah) on the MassPike.  We headed West for about and hour and a half to venture out on our first overnight backpacking trip.  I felt ready, as I had a better plan in place, and allowed for a different plan if anything changed.  I had called Pete, a shuttle driver I got from Guthook, to prearrange a ride.  He texted me the day before to confirm.  We parked Sherri's car on Jerusalem Rd. in Tyringham, MA at mile 1543.4.  It was a beautiful morning.  The sun was rising above the clouds that law low between the mountains.  There was a very cool house on this road, called the Gingerbread house too. Pete arrived right on time .  He was a great guy, very pleasant and reassuring.  He dropped us off, and said we could call him for anything we needed.  
The weather was perfect.  I love the morning crispness.  We walked over some pastures and  corn fields.  I had a new sun hat, which worked out perfect for this day.  We found some trail magic, gallons of water near the road.  We took advantage of it, as we know it's been a dry summer.  We saw the sign for Tom Leonard Shelter 5.1 miles away.  We were excited, but I knew from hiking in NH that climbing 5.1 miles can take 5.1 hours!  We made to the viewpoint, The Ledges.  This view was of the Mt. Everett range which we had hiked in June. We met a NOBO thru hiker named Wildfire, who had just come from there.  She was quiet and looked very fresh, considering how much she had already hiked in the summer heat.  We met a couple of day hikers also, who were very friendly.
The climbs weren't too bad and we made it to the shelter at 3:30pm. We felt good, but the next shelter was 5 or more miles away, with some bigger climbs.  We decided to stay and set up camp.  A man Chris was there setting up an A frame tarp.  He pointed us toward the platform tent area and explained where the water sources were.  We each had a platform to use, overlooking the valley.  We were able to relax and set up and change.  We went down to the water source.  We had trouble getting the water in the Sawyer bag.  Sherri came up with the trick using the backflush syringe to such the water from the source into the bag.  Our backs hurt more from squatting and bending over the stream.  We hiked back up, I was sweating again!  Squeezed our water, head over to the picnic table and boiled up some water.  We met a dayhiker family from Poughkeepsie, NY.  The man said he was a camper/hitchhiker.  I suppose he hitchhikes around and camps out.  I didn't fully understand, but found it interesting.  The woman was more of a runner, just out scoping out hiking with their new dog, and preteen son.  
A young man named David had arrived at camp.  He was going to sleep in the shelter.  He was using something in the campfire to boil his water, rather than fuel and a burner.  His water boiled quickly.  The guys were eating and we tried to get the fire going.  My firestarter didn't quite do it, so Chris has some for us to use.  We had a great campfire!  The bugs, frogs, toads, and owls were chiming up full force.  We headed to our tents about 8pm, great weather, the owl was calling again, even louder than before. I then heard some booms and saw a flash in the sky.  I went out of my tent to see if I could the owl, but never did.  The stars were amazing and I determined there were fireworks somewhere far away.  I slept pretty well, I heard raindrops on my tent about 5:00am, and decided to stay in bed.  It was so quiet at this time, slept well.  Awoke about 7:30am and rolled up what I could in my tent, then ventured out to boil water for coffee and breakfast. We had coffee and oatmeal looking at the view. Chris came by to see the sunrise view, and wished us happy trails.  I was a little slow moving in the morning, but we were ready to go at 8:45am.","MA Rt. 41 Mile 1520.2

SueBee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630604,"Headed out on trail at 8:45am.  What a feeling to step right onto to trail right away!  Felt good, the weather was great.  We headed down, then up again, through forest mostly.  We took at break at about the 7 mile mark. We were near the N. Wilcox Shelter intersection.  We were getting tired, a bit hot now.  We had met quite a few hiker earlier at a nice pond.  One SOBO hiker named Normsy was full of energy, and had his trail miles going.  I wet a disposable towel in the pond and used it to cool off.  It was a great way to me cool.  I kept it on my neck and forehead, and would dampen it when we passed a stream.  We SOBO hike Librarian who truly was that.  He enjoys reading and takes breaks at the viewpoint to relax and read.  Walker by another SOBO hiker, didn't catch her named, but she was petite and speedy.  I wish them all a great journey.  We were getting there, I heard a group behind me, and was surprised I kept ahead of them.  We came to a beaver brook, and stopped, as the group approached.  It was an older crowd out for a day hike.  A man named Pokey asked where we were headed.  I said Tyringham Cobble, he said, ""Oh, that's a little ways. Would you like a Gartorade?""   I said, YES, I asked Sherrie if she'd like to split one, and he said I have one for bother of you.  We drank, and chatted, then he said he would take out empty bottle.  Thank you Pokey!  I really needed that.  So good at that time! We carried on, few people were hiking in this section.  I realized I needed a longer break, since we didn't stop for long all day.  I had some M&Ms and we took 15.  I checked Guthooks, we had 2.5 miles to go, but it was up over Tyringham Cobble.  We pushed hard at the end, steady uphill, but there were dayhikers around seemingly cheering us on.  At the top of the climb was a huge meadow of yellow flowers, with rolling hills beyond.  I was in tears just before, then in awe of the beauty seconds later.  You just don't get that feeling driving by, or looking at pictures!","1530.2 Tom Leonard Shelter

SueBee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631495,"We stayed at the 100 mile wilderness cabins the night before.  The owner Phil had thru hiked the AT 3 times, and was now retired, running the cabin stays and shuttling people.  He was helpful in guiding us through. He had a nice map of the exact hike we were doing.  Phil drove us to the Caratunk trailhead, we started out hike at about 8:00am. It was pretty much uphill right away, we then saw Holly brook, which Phil raved about.  It was small and short.  We looked for the Pleasant Pond lean to to have our lunch, it was obscured by a huge fallen tree.  We had our lunch on a couple rocks nearby.  Sherri found the lean to when she went to the bathroom.  We went off trail to look at Pleasant Pond, it was beautiful.  Sherri got some water and filtered it. Next, we hike up Pleasant Pond Mtn, we could see the pond, it was a gorgeous sunny day, It was uphill for a while.  Some day hikers passed up going both ways.  They were faster than me, usually everybody is!  My pack was about 30 pounds.  We enjoyed the view at the top, we then met a thru hiker NOBO, his name was Valley Forge.  His pack was quite small.  He was looking forward to finishing up soon. Sherri asked him what one of his toughest days was, he said it was hiking in the hurricane rain, where the trail essentially becomes a stream.  Since his name was Valley Forge, it reminded me that I was at Fort Ticonderoga that day of hurricane rain.  It's amazing how our ancestors trekked through all of the elements while in combat, and just living off the land. We made it to the campsite at about 5:30.  It was pretty flat, we quickly set up our tents.  Sherri started a fire.  I went down to the pond and got some water.  Sherri had some Chili Mac, we just shared that.  I had a hard time settling down enough to eat.  It was getting cold, it was a clear night with a Full moon.  We climbed in our tents, and I ate slowly as my body calmed down.  I lie in my tent, trying to go to sleep, my eyes were closed, but I was not sleeping.  I had to get up twice to go to the bathroom, it was sill clear, calm and bright.  I settled down and slept until about 6 or 7am.","Caratunk trailhead mile 2041.8

SueBee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631498,"We awoke and heard either raindrops or pine needles falling in the wind. We boiled up some water for coffee and breakfast.  I had trouble eating again. I had oatmeal in a premade bag meal.  It hardened up pretty quickly.  Coffee was OK, I decided I'm going to stick with tea on my next trip, and possibly do coffee and more of the Carnation breakfast drink.  A little easier to get down in the morning than oatmeal. We got going about 8:00am and when we walked down to the pond, sure enough it was raindrops, we could see on the water.  We put on our rain gear.  I quickly got too hot as we were hiking up Moxie Bald Mtn.  I just wore my hat, I love my rain hat! I took off the jacket.  It was a tough climb, and the rain steadily picked up.  We got to the top of Moxie Bald and it was pretty spread out, with a short cut side trail, and another peak up there.  I saw Sherri up ahead and yelled for her to go on, and I would meet her at the next shelter.  She directed toward the AT. I had to go to the bathroom, and I put my jacket and gloves on.  We made it Bald Mtn Pond Lean to at 1:30pm.  It was raining steady, we were both cold and wet.  We boiled up some water, had a snack, and changed into some dry clothes.  My gloves were soaked and I didn't bring a 2nd pair.  My feet and my head were still dry. I put on my rain pants also.  I wanted to stop there, but Sherri wanted top move on, we would just be sitting there cold for too long. Also, that would leave us a 14 miles day on Day 3.  It was a nice shelter, you can see the pond from it, and the birds and squirrels were all around. I read the journal at the shelter and Valley Forge was there that morning, he said he saw a couple of mice and a bull moose walk right in front of the shelter!  
I checked Guthook and the next shelter was 8.9 miles away, there was also a tent site 5 miles away.  I really didn't know my mileage per hour in this terrain and rain. I was trying to do some math, but didn't give myself a change to work it out. I knew it would be 5 or more hours.  We pushed on, and sure enough the trail was now a stream.  I was doing good keeping my feet dry, then we had to cross the Piscataquis river several times.  Our feet got wet anyway.  The terrain was Maine terrain, rock and roots, slanted inclines and declines, trees down, fortunately no high mountains.
Well, it started to get dark, must have been about 6:00pm.  I got out my headlamp, and all I could do is forge ahead.  I could hear the river flowing to my right, and the white blazes show up great with the headlamp in the dark. All I could do is push on. I knew we were getting closer.  I heard Sherri calling me and I could see her light. I said "" Hello, I'm coming"" She walked back to me without her pack and said she found a stealth campsite. We were about 0.3 miles from the Lean to, but that seemed like eternity at that time. I got there and dropped to the ground. Sherri, said ""You need to get up and get your tent up.""  We got my tent up, and I took my clothes off ASAP.  I was wet and cold, but glad to be stopped and have shelter.  I realized I didn't have a dry towel, looking back I could have used my other dry shirt. I doused myself with powder and put on my sleeping clothes.  Sherri boiled up some water, I had some warm ramen.  It was so good, but I still had to eat slowly.  It must have been about 7:30 or later. So, my mileage is basically 1.5 miles/hour.  I held the warm pot in my hands, and calmed down.  My body started trembling uncontrollably.  I put my hands on my belly and had my down quilt, and everything dry on.  It took about a half an hour to warm up.  I realized I had hypothermia, thank  God for the pack liner, to keep things dry.  I actually slept better this night than the night before.  We could hear the river rushing along with the rain.","Moxie Bald Pond stealth site mile 2053.8

SueBee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631499,"I could see some brightening outside, but I knew it was cold and wet.  I was quite warm in my sleeping bag.  I was awake and knew I had to pack it up, so I packed up what I could in my tent, I just left my sleeping clothes on, and put my rainpants on. My hands were instantly cold after touching my wet clothes, tent, etc.  I put some bread bags over my dry socks and got my boots on.  My feet were dry! I got moving without coffee or anything, so I could stay warm.  Thank goodness the sun was out.  Sherri caught up with me at the water source.  I decided to just fill my smart water bottle and drink through the filter for the day, since we only had a 6 miles day.  Sherri decided to do that too, but she did hesitate, she wanted to fill up her bottles, but decided against it. My pack felt heavier than ever and it was leaning to the left.  I suppose with things being wet, added about 5 pounds or more. The terrain was up and down, rocky and rooty. Just beautiful forest, with lots of moss and rock formations. Sherri had went ahead of me, I felt slower than ever today. Real tired and just slow. I came to a river crossing that was quite deep, I questioned if this was really the trail? I sat at the river and checked Guthook, and I saw the blaze across the river, so Yup this really is it.  I scoped it out and decided to cross walking on built up branches, I have never done this before and really wasn't sure if they would hold me.  I was able to make it across, but my feet were submerged a few times.  This was the deepest and fastest moving river I ever crossed. It was the East branch of the Pascataquis River. I was about 3 miles away from Monson, so I just went slow, since it was still before Noon. I came to another uphill and saw a man at the top of the hill. I said ""You can come down, I'm gonna be a while."" He said, ""I saw your friend about a tenth of a mile up and I was just coming back to check on you."" So he watched climb the hill slowly, it was awkward. He was a trail maintainer and just checking on things in that area.  We crossed an ATV path with activity, since it was Saturday.  I would have loved a ride at this point! The man went on and said ""Enjoy your hike!""  I carried on knowing the end was near. I did get off trail, there were a lot of snowmobile trails and other areas that looked like trails.  I looked to the left and saw the white blaze, and got back on track.  The blazes were faded and scattered in this section, not good when you're exhausted and not thinking clearly.  I said ""keep it together"" to myself, and would take deep breath to try to get some  oxygen to my brain!  I came to an open path horizontal to the AT, and on the post it said Monson 2.0 miles to the right.  I wasn't 100% sure this was the way to Phil's, but I was pretty sure.  I turned right, and then I recognized the path to Phil's.   I was like ""Thank you God!"" I got to my car, opened the back, and took my pack and boots off.  There was a dog barking away constantly right in my face.  I was exhausted, and quickly agitated.  Sherri's  pack wasn't in my car, and I didn't see or hear her at all.  I asked the woman who owned the dog, if she had seen a woman hiker come here.  She said ""No, you're the first hiker we've seen today."" I was like, that's strange because she was ahead of me.?  I went to the showers, and heard the preteens girls playing with the dog, and there was a 3 yr old girl also.  The door didn't have a lock, but I just did my thing, hoping they wouldn't open the door.  It felt great to have dry towels. I called Sherri, texted Sherri, there is very little service up here, it got scary. I was putting my stuff back in my car, and then saw the owner Phil.  l alerted him that Sherri had not come back yet and she was ahead of me.  He said, she probably went ahead to Rt 15.  I said where is Rt 15. He said just take a left and another left, and the AT is about 3 miles up.  I waited a bit, then drove to Rt. 15.  I saw a young man get dropped off from Shaw's hostel with a full pack.  He was heading North, doing the 100 mile wilderness! I asked him to keep an eye out for a woman in her 50s, who was very friendly, her name is Sherri.  Tell her to turn around and come back here.  He said, Ok, but if she came this far she would know by now.  I agreed.  I went back to Phil's.  He was busy with the family that was visiting him with the dog, and a couple of other hikers who were heading out the next day. The barking dog was now happy and playing with Phil's dog.  I told Phil I was going to walk North on the trail to see if Sherri was on it, perhaps injured, or in need of help.  I started walking North and a couple was coming down South.  I asked them if they had passed anyone on the trail, especially a woman i her 50s with a green backpack.  They said "" No, we passed no one at all""  I walked back down with them.  They too were looking for Phil's and were a little disoriented.  I showed them the way.  They chatted with Phil, and I just waited to hear from Sherri.  I began to think that maybe that trail maintainer abducted her.  Since she seemed to have just vanished.  I was just listening to the others talk, kind of in a trance of worry and exhaustion.  Phil's phone rang, and it was Sherri! I could hear her voice, it was such a relief.  He asked her if she was at Rt 15 and she said Yes.  I went back to get her at Rt 15 and she wasn't there!  Valley Forge was there, looked like he was waiting for something.  I asked him if he saw Sherri? Assuming he would remember her from the other day on Pleasant Pond Mtn.  He really couldn't remember, but he said No.  He got picked up from the Shaw's shuttle.  I waited, then Sherri called and said she got dropped off at Phil's cabin. She got a ride with a couple of young guys.  She had got off trail on a side road before Rt 15 and was walking down, exhausted waiting for someone to give her a ride.  They did see a bull moose!  Sherri was exhausted, having walked an extra 5 miles or more.  She got a shower, we got some food, and headed home.  What an adventure!  Took me about a week to recover, mostly just all around tired, probably from the hypothermia.  I will be finishing Maine, but more likely stick to July and August, it is a beautiful state!","Horseshoe Canyon Lean to mile 2069

SueBee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631537,"Excited and nervous for my fist solo hike! Luckily there is a hotel 100yrds off trail at the midpoint of this next planned section.  I wanted to get some more miles in while the weather was good and I had the weekend off.  I arranged a shuttle a few days before with Park taxi as recommended by the hotel.  I assumed it was a large taxi service and not just a one woman shuttle, since the name was Park taxi.  She didn't take my info, and I did think it was strange.  I neglected to call and confirm the day before also, since I was preoccupied with some health concerns.  I was heaving PVCs, basically an extra heartbeat, and some chest pressure during the week.  I saw my doctor Friday, everything looks OK, but will still need a further workup.  Anyway, It was pouring rain during the early morning hours, but cleared up as I drove west.  I arrived at the trailhead and waited for the taxi.  No show, I called right at 8:30am, she said she made a mistake, and put me down on the wrong day.  It would be 40 minutes until a car could be there.  It was an hour and it was her picking me up.  I guess it is just her company, but she never gave me her name, and wasn't a pleasant shuttle drivers like the other drivers I had in the past.  She was said it would just be $20 due to the mix-up, but I gave her $40. 
The sun was coming out, but I started with my jacket on, and was a bit cautious, being solo and all. I slipped on a wooden bridge and fell pretty hard on my right knee as usual.  Came to a road with some cars parked and headed up the first climb.  The mountain has no name.  I had to go to the bathroom, and of course a young girl comes along, just out walking.  I quickly pulled up my pants and let her pass.  It was pretty steep, and she decided to head back down.  I then passed 3 hikes, I recognized one of them from Youtube maybe, and was trying to think of his name.  Well, somehow I got turned around and ended up walking back down the mountain! I was quite pissed to start my day this way, but what was my choice, go back up the mountain.  I remembered his name was Bounce, and reminded myself to pay attention! I was a bit swifter uphill the second time! It was an extra 2 miles. There was a second incline, and I was warming up.  I delayered. 
I saw the sign for Upper Goose Pond cabin 7.1 miles.  I wanted to have my lunch there, and learned from the past that just because there is a sign, doesn't mean it's close.  I chugged along, not seeing too many people. I decided to have my lunch when I was hungry, rather than waiting.  I came to the pond, it was to my left.  The sun was shining so brightly on the water. The trees were dispersed enough to see the pond from the trail.  It was a pristine area, seemingly no access from the road for cars.  I thought it would be a great place to bring Nick to try some fishing.  It was just 1.6 miles from the hotel. I cam e to the Masspike and saw the bridge with the sign Appalachain Trail Becket.  I was excited to walk over it, since I'd driven under hundreds of times.  I'd never thought I would be walking over it doing my first solo, it was cool!I made it to the hotel and just walked into my room, number 6.  There were a few other people in the parking lot, and it was still daylight.  I just took my time, getting out of my boots and clothes, settling down.  I realized I do need this time to settle before I can truly rest.  I must say a warm shower and bath is awesome<  I actually had to turn the heat on in the room, it was getting down into the 30s, and I could feel it.  I went over to the breakfast room and heated up some water in the microwave.  I had some green tea, some ramen with snap peas, sweet potatoes and some spam.  That was all I needed.  I took 3 advil, watched some TV and slept quite well.","Jerusalem Rd.

SueBee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631538,"Awoke feeling good, a little stiff of course.  Had some coffee and muffin in the room, got dressed, got water and headed out about 7:45am. Had on gloves, hat, and jacket due to the chilly morning.  The sun was shining bright, breaking through the fog on the small lake.  I headed up Becket Mtn, I felt good and was glad to be walking away from the Masspike noise.  I made it to the top by about 9:00 am, delayered to my t-shirt and pants.  I wrote a note in the AT book.  I was hoping to pass Hiking with Braids, but realized  we would miss each other by a day or two.  She's helped me so much, as far as planning out the day, water, breaks, and just everything.  You really need to use all your tools in order to make good decisions, and also stay in tune with your body.  I left a note for her. I was feeling more confident today, more than yesterday.  I love waking up and being able to step right onto the trail!  I was getting better at looking up for blazes and looking down at the trail quickly.  I felt my pace was a little quicker.  
The weather was perfect for hiking for me, I came to a small lake and decided to bio break and have a granola bar.  Shortly after I arrived a woman also came down to take a snack break too.  We chatted for a bit.  She had on a big pack.  She had started in June, going North with a friend they did NH, Kahtadin and VT.  She was now going solo South.  She said she had done about 600 miles.  I then realized I had done almost 100 miles!  She was retired and able to do more days in a row.  Now I want to join her!  I told her I had stayed at the hotel, and she said she was heading there today.  She had stayed at October Mtn Shelter, and I was hoping to get there for lunch.  She said the terrain wasn't too crazy.  It was inspiring to see a solo older woman hiker.  The shelter was still about 7 miles away, I carried on.  I was getting a little tired, so I took another break, had a fuel for fire.  These work great for me on the trail.  I was able to eat more this trip and maintain my energy level. I got to the shelter at about 1:15pm.  It is so nice to have a table to sit at!  Another hiker had stuff out at the table, but I didn't see anyone.  I could tell from the pack it was a man.  I thought he may be in the bathroom. I just sat and made my lunch.  A tortilla with peanut butter and deer jerky.  I had some water with electrolytes too.  I also took 2 more advil, my upper right trap was pinching. The man came and apologized for his stuff being all over.  He was a SOBO through hiker, his pack was huge. He said he was getting a late start, he had trouble getting up in the cold. I thought, wow 1:30 is a super late start.  I suggested the hotel, but he said he'd go to the Upper Goose Pond shelter next.  He had a southern accent and was very nice to talk to.  I used the bathroom, then headed out.  I thought it was cool to be at October Mtn in October!I passed a few dayhikers and another thru hiker, the terrain was a little tricky, more up and down, and wetlands.  There were several low flying military helicopters.  I was always looking for a moose or deer.   Didn't see much wildlife actually.  I had about 5 miles to go. I was in the hiker zone, where everything just moves in unison the way it's supposed to.  I love it!  I had to go to the bathroom again, so I did.  I came to a Washington Rd, there were many cars and dayhikers out.  I sat on the rock near the AT sign and soaked in the sun for a minute.  So nice.  I  trekked on and pretty much just kept going, the last mile always seems the longest.  I mad it back to my car by about 4pm, quickly changed and headed home on the Masspike, passing under the AT bridge I walked over the day before.","Berkshire Lakeside Lodge mile 1552.9

SueBee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631658,"Today is Halloween and the last day before we change the clocks backs.  So, not much daylight for hiking until March after this.  I had wanted to get this small section done that we had missed on our hike in September.  Our shuttle driver dropped us off a few miles after where we left off in June.  Looking back we could have done it, it would have been about a 14 miles day instead of a 9 mile day.  It was pretty much downhill, but we would have the added 1.5 miles up on the blue blaze.  Live and learn.  The AT has taught me so many things already about decision making, listening to my body, pushing myself more than I think I can, asking for help, and taking others opinions with a grain of salt.  
I got a later start because we had quite a snow storm that carried on longer than the forecast expected during the day and night before.  The temperatures were colder than expected so we got about 5 inches of snow. The trees were blanketed with snow and the sun was shining brightly.  The temps were in the 40s, but there was no wind.  Basically, I had to hike this section twice, first South then North to get back to my car.  
I started with the pasture, then climbed up the rock scramble at Jug End Rd.  It was quite steep with switchbacks.  Luckily, there was a hiker before me.  I presume a man with a dog going by the size of the footprints.  I also presumed he was from Maine, since there was a car with Maine plates at the trail parking.  I was able to follow the trail mostly by the footprints, the white blazes were obscured at times by the snow stuck on the trees.  I did get off trail once and climbed under and over a tree for no reason.  So, now I was full of moss, tree bark and snow.  
I got up to the first viewpoint, the snow had melted quite a bit down in the valley below.  There were clumps of snow on the rocks that looked like snow crystals, quite cool.  I had a small snack and a bio break.  It was warmer now, but I kept my jacket on.  My feet and hands were getting wet from the snow on the ground and in the trees hanging down on the trail.  I continues on up Mt Bushnell and then came to a brook with a deep section right on the trail.  I crossed it off to the sized and then saw the sign for Elbow Trail to the left.  I looked around the area, and vaguely remembered it from our hike in June when it was 90 degrees and super humid.  I was glad now that we didn't get dropped off there in September because when coming up Elbow trail this is not a clear sign that would make you turn left to go North on the AT.  All you can see is the blaze with the trail going South.  By now, I've learned to use the Guthook app, and would hope I would think to check.  So, I just turned and went back down the way I came.
The snow had melted off the trail, but was still on some of the trees.  I came to the Jug End lookout and stopped to have a decent lunch break.  It was quite nice, but I could feel it was getting colder again.  I headed down what I thought was the trail, it did have some foot traffic on it, but I couldn't find a white blaze.  It was quite steep, and I checked Guthook.  So, I learned that Guthook will say you're on the AT even when you are just close to it.  My body wanted to continue north, but the AT actually turned south at this point.  I went down quite a steep rock, had to throw my poles, slid down, ripped my pants.  Realized, that NO this is not the trail.  Had to go back up this steep rock with nothing to grab.  I was literally not sure if I would fall or not.  I stopped, took some deep breaths, secured a branch to grab, spoke to my legs muscles, ""This is it, you can do this, please don't fail me now!""  I made it up, I was grateful and pissed off at the same time.  Got back to the beautiful lookout and, still couldn't find the trail!  I looked and looked, held my app out, and learned the arrow shows which way you're going, DA! I had to hold my phone while I walked.  It was downhill anyway I went.  I finally saw the blaze on the tree down below the rock, the tree was covered with snow, which is why I couldn't see it.  I thought it was funny, that my body wanted to go north.  I made it down without much problem after that.  Got to my car, changed into dry clothes, cranked the heat and headed home.  It was a huge orange full moon rising in front of me and a solid orange sunset behind me.  So glad I got this done!","Elbow Trail 1516.5

We walked through Dalton, Chesire, and North Adams towns.  Adorable homes and passersby waved to us.  We arrived at our meet up location @ 3:30, so I called Debbie and asked if she could pick us up in about half an hour at the next road being Outlook Ave.  She said she could, so we pushed on.  This was our longest distance on trail we have done so far.  We felt good though.  Debbie had got a call from two other women at the same time we called, and they had asked if she could pick them up on  Outlook Ave also!  The were hiking the trail, but going back to their car to camp off trail.  One of them left the keys in the wrong car, so they had to get a ride to get the keys.  It was a bummer for them, but we had such great conversations with them.  One of them is planning on a thru hike in 2021.  Sherri informed her about Trail journals, she was excited to have a way to document her hike.  Hopefully I'll be able to find her.  She was from PA.  We got to the hotel, showered, at a bit and watched Home Alone before crashing.","Blotz Rd mile 1565.3

First time for this, I was glad I had the sit pad to stand on so my feet didn't get wet from the damp ground.  I regrouped and placed my water bladder on the outside of my pack, it was holding the water in in still. Somehow it was leaking around the opening.  I had also put on my new Zpacks raincoat.  It was great because it protected my back from getting wet from the wet backpack bottom.  We carried on, up and down quite a bit, over water and looking out through the trees.  It was still cloudy, rain at times, but a great day to hike.  This section of the South side of Greylock was just magical to me.  So much water, beautiful Birch trees, moss, and small Pine trees.  It was a long uphill, 8 miles.  We made it to the summit and it was quite windy with small snow balls flying.  We took some quick photos.  I tried to eat on the way down, but the wind picked up, and we were now cold.  We layered up, and stayed layered for the descent down.  It was the busier side of the mountain, not quite as pretty.  We saw more people, a few trail runners too.  It was 6 miles down, and it was quite steep at times.  The sun poked out a couple of times.  I had to take a few more breaks today, and noticed my feet were hurting more.  I think it's time to break in some new shoes.  We got to the bottom of Greylock, into the town of North Adams.  We could see what we climber up and down right behind us.  It is quite a wide, big mountain at 3400ft.  I must say, it's one of my favorites so far!","Outlook Avenue 1582.2

SueBee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636613,"My husband Nick and I had a planned vacation to PA for our 28th wedding anniversary.  We had wanted to see Gettysburg, Valley Forge and the Amish country.  I didn't have a plan for hiking the AT at all on this trip.  I did bring a backpack and shoes, etc. for day hikes.  When we went out to dinner on the first night we saw a sign for the AT, and I then realized the next day the trail was right there.  We were staying about 15 minutes away.  I didn't express an interest at that time to do any miles because I didn't want to take away from our time together.  We did some paddling, sightseeing, and eating, and were more relaxed.  He had wanted to get back into golf, so he actually brought it up, saying that he could play golf while I hiked.  I said heck, yeah!
He dropped me off at about 8:30, the forecast was for some rain.  I had an umbrella in my car, which I brought with me, along with another jacket, dry socks, etc.  I had to walk along the highway on the bridge, but got into the woods shortly, and started a small climb.  It was cool, but not raining too much.  I had some new shoes that I was breaking in too.  It was perfect hiking weather.  I encountered the rocks that I've heard about.  They were OK until I got to Sunfish pond.  The trail was larger sideways rocks.  It had started to rain quite heavily at this time.  I had stopped to open the umbrella, when a young girl passed by with her umbrella out too.  She said she was out for a few a days, and her boyfriend was picking her up this day.  She was looking forward to a good meal, I recommended the BBQ place right off trail in town. 
The rocks were super slippery here, more so than the rocks up north.  The trail was narrow also, with low brush that hit the umbrella.  I decided to put the umbrella away until I pass the pond.  It was tough.  I took a break after the pond, and then opened up the umbrella again.  It was a huge help at this point, I was wet, but not unbearable, the temps were high 50s.  The only wildlife I saw was a millipede, several orange newts, and lots of birds, which I loved.  It rained heavy for a while.  I carried on, and then came to a ridge when the rain subsided and the clouds were clearing.  The birds were so happy and so was I.  I changed my jacket and put the umbrella away.  I passed a couple who were out for a few days.  They still had on large poncho type rain jackets.   I was surprised I was faster than them and they never caught up to me.  I was getting close to the pickup point, the trail was a river, so I walked out the grassy edge.  Along came groups of young men, like 6 at a time, carrying a lot of gear, and wearing the large rain ponchos still.  The first couple of groups were moving along, but the more groups that came were struggling.  I thought they had too much stuff and were overdressed.  I believe that had an adult guiding them, but not too many.  One boy was lying down with the foil blanket on him.  They said help was coming.  Another boy said, he couldn't wait to get McDonalds. 
I remember doing things in my twenties, not being prepared enough.  Life is such a lifelong learning experience.  When you've got most things figured out, sometimes you can't do them physically or mentally.  I've learned I can do way more than I thought I could, and that if I want to do something, I don't have to wait for conditions to be just right to accomplish my goals.  After going to Gettysburg and Valley Forge, I couldn't help but try to imagine what the men, women, boys and girls went through to establish our country.   I arrived at our meeting point, and waited for my husband.  It was raining again, so I sat on the side of the road with my umbrella.  He went to hit golf balls, and had to finish up.  He told me he was confused about the pickup point, but I knew it was a white lie.  He's getting better at using the Maps, etc.  A few people passed in cars, one man stopped to chat, he mention the young boys also.  We laughed.  He finally arrived, I was wet, tired and hungry, but I was excited to get some miles done.","1296.0 Delaware Water Gap

I passed two men who were out for a day hike, starting slowly.  They were impressed with my mileage for the day.  I was impressed that they were impressed!  I got to Wolf's rocks, which were very large rocks, it was kind of fun.  There was a beautiful lookout at the top.  I stopped and took a break here.  I sent my boss a video message, because she was retiring today, and I couldn't be at the party.  I thought she'd enjoy the view too.  The rocks continued, my feet started hurting.  I passed another group, but just kept going.  The terrain was flat, but the rocks were tearing up my feet.  I got to another lookout on the other side of the trail, some young people were hanging out, listening to music.  I could hear the road, it was a highway, so it was still far away.  I was anxious to finish, I could feel a blister on my right lateral heel.  I've never has a blister there.  I think I had the wrong socks on.  I usually wear sock lines, but I didn't have those.  I texted Nick at the 2 miles point.  It took me about an hour and 15 to get all the way down.  It was a rocky, buggy, swampy section.  I couldn't wait to get out, mostly because of my feet.  I got to the trail parking lot and a man asked me if I needed a ride somewhere.  Lots of nice folks around here.  Nick was there waiting for me this time.  I'm so glad to have gotten these miles done unexpectanted!","Wind Gap 1280.5

We arrived at our end location, Undermountain Rd. trailhead right on schedule at 8:30am, Vanessa, a local shuttle driver and hostel owner picked us up.  Her car was quite dirty and destroyed by her dogs.  She was very pleasant and we had a good conversation on the ride.  She had said her hostel was full for the weekend, so I knew we couldn't use her as a backup.  I really didn't want to after seeing how dirty her car was, and then she said one of the tenants was sick with a stomach issue.
We started out hike about 9:30am, it was a little damp, but not raining heavily.  We had on our gear, ready to go.  There were quite a few ups and downs, no real views.  A couple of lookouts, but it was cloudy and rainy.  I had looked at Guthook to see what to expect in the last 5 miles or so, I told Sherri we have 2 more up and then the shelter is at the bottom of the second down.  For some reason, I have no idea.  I thought a water source that was 2 miles from the shelter was the last one available. I think because that's how it was on out Maine hike, last September. We filled up our water, I tried to filter it there, but my Sawyer squeeze was not flowing.  I pushed on the Sawyer bag and it burst a hole.  I couldn't use that now.  Sherri filled up all of her bags.  We carried the water for 2 miles!  We passed another brook in a mile and then a brook with flowing water was at the campsite!  What a fool I was.  One of Sherri's bags didn't have the cover on, and her down jacket got wet too.  
It had stopped raining, we were able to setup camp without more rain, it was cold and damp, about 50 degrees.  I was going to boil all my water, then quickly realized, that takes to long and uses all the fuel.  I poured my first pot of water into my plastic Smartwater bottle, and it quickly melted.  Another act of craziness,  I was still able to use the water bottle, thank goodness.  Sherri got her tent set up, just had some tea and trail food and headed into her tent to try to warm up.  I drank some warm recovery mix and set up my tent while more water was boiling.  The had some macaroni and cheese, so warm and so good.  My tent was warm enough and I was happy it wasn't raining.  There were a few men at the shelter also.  More groups of people came in later, and basically just set up camp, and I never saw them again.  One man said the rain would restart at 3am.  I looked up some hotels/hostels/anything on Guthook.  I called a few, I didn't care the price at this point.  We were cold now, and knew by adding rain, it would be miserable to camp in.  The Hitching Post Hotel said he would call me after 10am the next day, if someone checkout.  Everything else was booked, I was willing to go to a fancy hotel at this point. I had a hard time falling asleep, but I did get to sleep eventually, after the owl hooted Goodnight to us.","Hoyt Rd. mile 1458.7

The rain came and stayed, it was a lot of ups and downs, we were tired to start from being cold.  We met tow older men, Topchef and Topgoat, they were trekking along with quite heavy packs.  Topchef wore shorts! They had been out a trail a while, heading North.  Topchef was very quick and Topgoat was keeping up with him pretty good.  We were on a large downhill rock scramble, I heard a holler.  Topgoat had slipped and fell down on his left side.  Topchef came back to check on him, I was behind  him coming down too.  He got up slowly and said that everything was OK. You never know, a fracture could easily happen.   Luckily he was OK and we carried on.  
There a little clearing at Caleb's Peak, Topchef took a picture. We had come to St John's Ledges.  It was quite a steep, large boulder descent.  I was behind Topgoat, he was being extra careful, he said feel free to pass, but I had no problem going slow on downhills like that.  We made it to then bottom and ""surprise"" A man named Smoky was there with his truck, 2 coolers full of sandwiches, soda, Gatorade, chips and chocolate.  Summah (Sherri) was there, Topchef,TopGoat, and another man.  We were eating as fast as possible because we froze up as soon as we stopped moving.  The Sprite was delicious! Smoky had some great stories, and this was out first Trailmagic with a person there to greet us.  We all needed it, right at that moment.  The next few miles were flat, walking along the river. We passed Action and Adventure, married couple thru hikers from NC.  They were slackpacking for the day, they had stayed at a hostel due to the rain.  The man said we can follow them on their Facebook page. I signed up that night.  Then one more big climb, the rain was relentless, never let up.  We got to CT Route 4 and headed East toward the hotel, a woman drove by, rolled down her window and said, ""Need a ride"".  I said ""YES"" she pulled off and we put our wet stuff in the back, she knew the area, and dropped us off in 2 minutes.  Her plate was California, she said she lives in CT half the year, and CA the other half.  She lives near the PCT in CA.  We needed that right then, we were so grateful.  We got to our room, figured out the heat, showered, and hung our stuff to dry.  Sherri ordered some food, nobody delivers in the area.

We had a big day ahead of us, 21.6 miles would be our longest yet.  Connecticut is no joke with the many PUDS!  I only had 2 dollars to give him for his kindness, I felt bad.  We did pay $75 each for the room though.  We started off with a large river crossing.  We had done this in Maine, so it wasn't a surprise, but I didn't want to start off the day with even more wet shoes and socks.  I took them off and crossed, then put them back on.  Sherri just walked with hers on.  She said she was dry still.  We met another group of 3 women at the base of the next climb.  They were just starting their day, and were moving slow.  We chatted up the climb, as I'm not a fast climber either.  They were from Eastern CT, they were glad to maybe dry their stuff out later.  They stayed at the Farmhouse I tried to get into, and they said the heat wasn't high enough to dry their stuff.  They did get dinner cooked for them though. So, they got the last bed at the Farm and we got the last bed at the Hotel. I never saw them again.After the climb, I told Sherri she should go ahead and don't wait for me.  If she got to the car first, she could go pick up our stuff at the hotel. She agreed. I sent her periodic check-ins on Guthook. The skies were clearing and it wasn't raining.  I took off all my rain gear and just hiked.  I ended up using the water purification tablets for my water, and it really isn't bad at all, as long as you use the Plus tablets too for the taste and color.  I also added a Nuum tablet, which is crucial for me for hydration.  I was extra thirsty in the morning from sleeping at the hotel with the heater blowing near me.  I finally got to the Privy at Pine Swamp Shelter and was able to go.  Being dehydrated from hiking really screws up things.  I felt way better after that.  Also, got the right balance of foods to keep me going.  I noticed when  I start tripping and thinking crazy, it time to refuel. I had some energy chews to keep me going too.  The hike flattened out, and went along the river.  It was quite beautiful, purple phlox type of wildflowers were blooming.  A deer also jumped out right in front of me at one point, startled me!  I felt I was getting the miles in.  There is a handicap accessible trail with benches, people were out walking dogs, etc.  Everyone was glad to be out of the rain on the Memorial day holiday. The trail went through Falls Village, Great Falls is  large powerful waterfall. With all the rain, it was surging. Many day hikers were out around the area.  I was trying to trek along, but still take in the beauty of it.  I don't live far from there, so I could always go back.  There were more beautiful views today, with the sky clearing.  Rand's view was my favorite.  You just walk out of the woods to a large meadow, with several mountains in the distance without a road or a house in sight.  These are thing you can only see from the AT, which is why I love it!It was a bit more up and down, and the trail got swampy feeling.  The bugs were coming out with the sun.  I keep my phone in my pant pocket to update Sherri.  Somehow I called my son Ryan by accident.  It was so nice to hear his voice.  I told him I was just singing Somewhere over the Rainbow, and I got connected to him.  Sherri got to the car about an hour before me and was able to get our stuff.  I smelled so bad, she kept the windows down.  Sorry.  We said goodbye to the Great Barrington area, as we are now down with MA and CT. As painful and uncomfortable the trail can be, it is an amazing journey that you can only truly know by experiencing it yourself.  Hopefully I retain what I learn each time for the next adventure.","CT Route 4 mile 1481.3

It does have the best view of Katahdin.  We had to wear a wrist band to show that we were paid guests and not thru-hikers looking to camp and shower for free.  This put a bit of a damper, as we felt we were always being watched.  It was cool to see so many thru hikers at the end of their journey.  They had large calf muscles, a musky scent and a free spirit, although tired and weary.
The Golden Rd. to the campground is a log road, part paved, part sand, part bumpy gravel.  Sherri has a minivan and felt the road was damaging her car.  She didn't want to drive down it too many times, so we arranged a shuttle to pick us up at 10am and drop us off a KSC.  The shuttle never showed, so we had to make another plan. We can either walk some miles from here and just turn around, or we can drive each other to get these miles in.  We ended up driving down the Golden Rd a couple of more times to get these miles in. I dropped Sherri off at KSC, which was good, so we could see where our campsite was for the next day.  It is very spread out, you feel like part of nature. 
It's a beautiful section along the river, mainly flat, many birch trees, soft ground.  I didn't see one other hiker.  They did have a sign in sheet on trail as you enter Baxter State Park, once again you're questioned where you're going, etc.  It is such a vast wilderness, I can see why the would want to keep of track of who's in there.  It felt good to get the legs moving, instead of so much driving.  We went to sleep early, as we were getting up early to head to KSC, set up our tents, and hike Katahdin the next day.

We decided to do this, to see more of the mountain, and not walk the same trail twice.  Abol trail had beautiful views all along the way.  It starts out like most hikes with a gradual climb, then turned to large boulders, a bit spread out, with sandy areas between. I saw two hikers who looked a bit worn coming down.  I asked if they had gone up yesterday and they said, Yes, they had spent the night on the mountain. I let them know the ranger was looking for them and they will be OK now.  The trail then turns into just boulders on top of boulders, quite larger, which require much thought to avoid a fall.  A fall here would mean a definite injury.  Some other hikers were descending, which looked just as tough. I stopped a few times to just regroup and stay calm, and of course enjoy the beautiful views. Yoga breathing helped a lot, and the serenity prayer.  It was a sunny, muggy day.  There were some dark gray clouds forming though.
Sherri waited for me at the Thoreau Spring, which was at the top of the boulder climb.  We were both flabbergasted!  Sherri took a video of herself in her state of frighten, she wanted to remember this.  We kept ascending, we were now in the Alpine zone, it was still a nice day, not windy.  There were other hikers reaching for the summit.  It was awesome.  We made it to the summit! The view down the other side is incredible.  I took a break, had a snack, then we got some photos with the famous Katahdin sign. It is just unbelievable!  The wind started to pick up, and we headed down the AT Hunt trail.  
There was a small, black and white bird, which would fly in quickly to a rock crevice, then just disappear.  I never really got a good look at him, but he showed up periodically through my whole decent.  These rock were more pointy, and still quite large.  We had to slide down some times, and hope the landing wasn't an ankle breaker.  The skies turned darker, and we heard thunder.  We put on our rain gear.  It rained a bit, then stopped.  The sun shown down through the clouds, down on the valley, it was absolutely beautiful!  It was tough the entire way down, the rain came back, and the trail became a river.  I was soaked, getting a bit cold. My bird friend appeared again, I also saw a hare.  The water moved off trail to the right which turned into Katahdin stream falls.  It was full force, I had to keep walking because I was cold and it was getting dark.  I got out my headlamp, and finally saw the sign that said 1.1 miles to KSC.  I made it down, got to the campsite, Sherri was in her tent.  She had boiled some water and left it in my tent with a boost drink.  I just changed and tried to get dry.  We were in our tents with dry clothes on, with dry bedding, and warm drinks.  We were Ok.  What a hike, a once in a lifetime experience, which words don't even seem enough to explain.","Katahdin Stream Campground mile 2187.9

I headed North confidently. It was a little rainy, but not too bad, and it cleared up as the day went on.  I saw 3 deer run off right away.  I felt good, the terrain was similar to flatter sections of Massachusetts, with small hills.  I also passed a tortoise on the trail, he or she was climbing over a log, quite stretched out, and then fell over onto it's shell. It was bright yellow and dark brown speckled, very beautiful, and I've never seen one like that before.  I flipped it back on its feet and we both carried on in opposite directions.  I crossed paths with some other thru hiker looking hikers who were going South. There was some history in this section, a nice park with a bathroom that was open, the George Washington Monument with dates along the trail of significant times in his life.  I took a break about every 3 hours, and this felt good to stop, eat, sit, and regroup.  My left shoe needing adjusting for a while, the laces weren't quite right and it felt either too snug or too loose. I finally got it right by the end of the day.  It was a great hike, Nick was there to pick me up at Raven Rock Rd. which was right after a large creek crossing.  The water level was Ok for me, but there was a sign where to go to pass if it was too high.  Love the signage and terrain on this hike.","Turners Gap, Rt 40 miles 1043.5

It was an uphill right away.  I loved it.  I passed a large group of older folks, and they said you're almost there!  I didn't mind the uphill's in Maryland at all.  Compared to Katahdin this was refreshing.  I had never hiked without socks before, and was hoping I wouldn't get a blister.  I had to carry my water bottle also, I didn't have a backpack.  I came to another section of boulders, I was going down.  I passed a Dad and 2 grown sons who were heading up with a full backpack.  It was a tough bit, but it wasn't too long I told them.  It was nice to talk them them about sections of the AT.  They said Georgia was tough too.  I made it to PenMar Park, my feet were just fine without socks.  Nick brought me a nice sub and a slice of keylime pie.  We enjoyed it while looking out at the view.  It was a bit breezy, a perfect hiking day. We were getting chilly sitting though.  We went and checked out the history of the park.  It was quite a place back in the 1890's-1930's.

I planned on at least a 9 hour day. The terrain wasn't bad in this section, quite flat with some rocks.  There were more hikers hiking the same direction as I was.  I passed a man taking a break, and then a couple who stopped and let me pass. We ended up bumping into each other all day long.  There were some more battle sites right along the trail, I stopped and read some of the information, and just really paid tribute to the men who fought.  There was another lovely park, with some monuments, and another working bathroom.  A man was walking his new puppy German Shepard.  I ran into the man I passed before.  We hiked together for a bit.  I learned he was from Ohio, here doing the Maryland section backpacking.  He seemed to slow down, so I just went on ahead.  This section was much flatter than the Norther section.  I stopped at 2 of the shelters to take a break, the Ed Garvey shelter was like a log home.  People take care of it, in tribute to Ed, who was an avid thru hiker from MD.   I saw the couple again, he had said they were staying there, but they changed their plan and were going to hike to Harpers Ferry and stay at the hotel.  I hiked with the man from Ohio again, and he was hiking into Harper Ferry too.   It was about 5 or 6 more miles.  There was a small uphill, he couldn't keep up with me. I wished him well on this last stretch.  I've never been the fast hiker before.  I carried on, I could hear the cars and the train, and thought I was almost there for sure. Wrong!  These last four miles or so were on the cart path, along the river.  It was very hard on the feet.  Many people were out biking after work.  I was just trucking along, doing the death march.  I finally got to Harpers Ferry!  I was glad we were there as tourists a few days ago, because the town isn't marked that well.  I knew exactly where to go.  I got to the ATC headquarters, however Nick was just wrapping up fishing and would be another half hour.  I literally became hiker trash.  Took off my sock and shoes, changed my shirt, lied down on my backpack, and hung out eating gummy worms.  I just waved to the people going by in the neighborhood.  It's really a quiet little town after the tourists go home, and the hiker trash leaves!","Turners Gap, Rt 40 miles 1043.5

SueBee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649053,"It's finally Spring!  We've had this trip planned since last November. We had planned to do this Thanksgiving weekend, but Sherri had gotten sick.  It wasn't anything major, thank goodness.  It was a good thing because it was below freezing, windy and snowing that weekend! We were very lucky with the weather this time.  The last section hike we did together was Connecticut on Memorial day, and it was cold and rainy.  We got chilled to the bone, and had to scramble for a place to stay one night.  Connecticut was beautiful, but tough!  
Today was a sunny Spring day.  The trail was relatively flat, it was a great way to start the season.  There are not too many view points, I did pass the Appalachian Trail Deli. I didn't stop it because it was only about an hour into my hike.  I then came to Franciscan Way, I stopped at the red barn and had a rest.  The church bells were chiming, I said a little prayer, it was Good Friday after all.  Mostly I just thought of Mom.  The daffodils, hyacinths and forsythia are in full splendor this year. 
I carried on, I came to the Ledge lookout point, but noticed a couple of male hikers cowboy camping there. I descended down the steep section, and realized I had gotten off trail. I found the white blaze and was relieved to get back on trail, but then came to the men on the Ledge again and realized I was going the wrong way!  Good thing they were there, because much of the trail in this section looks the same.  I was due to meet Sherri at the half way point, as she was walking the opposite direction.  I started getting nervous we would somehow miss each other.  We had cell service, so I sent a text.  Some other day hikes were out, it was a sunny day about 70 degrees, with a breeze.  A beautiful young girl walked by, her long hair way blowing and she wasn't carrying anything.  She commented ""We couldn't ask for a more beautiful day""  I agreed, and then wondered where she came from.  I don't know the area, so there may be a neighborhood nearby, but it seemed to me she was like an angel.  
Sherri and I finally met!  We stopped and had lunch, exchanged car keys, told each other about the trail, and the car parking situation.  She told me she again had been sick with a bad cold, but she felt up to doing the hike, she's amazing!  I had a bit more than half way to go, Sherri hikes about 2.5 mph and I'm about 2mph.  It was a nice hike, but as always, that last mile is sooo long.  I passed the phone in the wind.  An old phone placed to for anyone to talk to a loved one that has passed.  I picked it up and just listened.  I think I was hoping to hear from someone, I didn't hear anything, so I just hung up and in a few minutes, I was at the parking lot.  Sherri was already there with my car.  We just ate, changed, and relaxed.  We went to bed early. It was a beautiful night with a full moon.  I slept OK, not great.  I was planning to get up early, drive to the next spot, and hike back to Sherri's car.  It was a great first day, and I was surprised how well we did","South Mountain Pass Rd mile 1409.1

I took a phot of it, it was really cool.  The trail became more rocky, and it was kind of fun, scrambling.  I met Sherri up on the ridge. She was feeling better as well.  We had both felt 2 rain drops and put on our rain gear.  We quickly became overheated.  It never rained!  I took mine off, and put on my t-shirt.  Much better!  I kept my rain jacket close, but never needed it.  I think we were having flashbacks of Maine, where we waited to put on our rain gear! We carried on, there were more rock scrambles up and down.  I came to Canopus Lake, and thought how wonderful I'm close to the parking lot.  Sherri had made it to Depot Hill Rd about an hour and half before I was done.  She said the bugs were so bad at Depot Hill parking, that maybe we shouldn't stay there.  I said just drive back to Canopus Hill Rd parking and we'll stay there again.  It took me about another hour to walk around Canopus Hill, it was a lot of up and down, and I was dragging.  Sherri had to wait for me in my car.  Next time I'll just give her her keys too, so she can get into her car too.  The rain started coming now, it felt good to cool off a little!  I made it to the parking are, quickly got some water boiling, got changed, and got as much ready for the next day.  It started raining hard.  I just sat in my car and ate.  The rain eased up a bit, so I was able to get everything ready for the next day, and firm up plans with Sherri.  This was a bit longer day, with more ups and downs, but I still felt good.  I slept better this night.","Canopus Lake Rt 301 mile 1425.7

The trail turned into beautiful pastures with cows.  It was chilly today, so I kept my jacket on, and had been putting my gloves on and off again.  I met Sherri near the AT train stop.  We didn't stop long because it was windy and chilly.  I came to a long boardwalk with chairs and benches.  I chose to stop at a bench in the sun that was shielded from the wind, I ate and it felt good to rest.  
I carried on, it became colder and some small hail balls were flying.  I put my gloves on again and kept them on for a while.  I came to the Dover Oak tree, an even bigger and older oak the one before.  It appears they really like the muddy soil!  There was more mud all along the way.  I was glad it was a colder day, because the bugs would have been bad.  I then came to Nuclear Lake, it did seem eerily quiet.  I wondered if there were fish in the lake?  I had stopped to go to the bathroom, and then I noticed an eagle fly across the lake!  That answered my question. I waited to see if he/she would fly back my way, but it never did.  It flew around on the other side, but it was too far away.  A day hiker walking past said he sees them quite often.

We had done the Northern part of NY in April, so we were familiar with the trailhead.  It was a small, secluded area in a rural neighborhood. The houses were quite far apart and secluded as well. The road to the neighborhood wasn't paved, and seemed like the residents preferred it this way.  We slept in our cars at the trailhead Friday night.  It was a peaceful night, and we slept well.
George Lightcap came to pick us up, he was a little early, we were ready, so we went.  George has walked the AT in sections as well, it took him 27 years! I'm hoping to be done by 20 years. He had lots of good tips for us.  He gave us each a beaded necklace that he makes for some of his students and hikers he shuttles.  I love it! He dropped us off, and said if we needed anything to give him a call. Except, not after about 6:30 that night because he was having a gin and tonic, too funny.
It was about a mile up until we hit the AT.  George had told us to take a right, it was also clearly marked North and South.  We moved right along, with Greenwood Lake on the right.  Lots of people were out enjoying the holiday weekend and the nice weather.  We passed several SOBO thru hikers, this was really cool.  We climbed up the rebar with our heavy packs, this was the beginning of thing to come! Fitzgerald Falls had no water at all, it was kind of creepy to see.  It looked so empty.  I was getting low on water, some thru hikers we passed said the Hot Dog/ice cream stand had spigots.  We saw the blue blaze and took it up to the road.  There was a hot dog cart right there.  I said, ""This is good for me, let's stop here""  It was about 12:30 and starting to get warmer.  We got ice cold sodas, water and I had a hot dog, so good! We had done about 6 miles, but still has more 7ish more to go.  I didn't feel rushed, and it was good to cool off. 
We passed Wildcat Shelter, Sherri needed water, so we took a look for a spring.  There was a man sleeping in the shelter. We could see him before getting to close.  Farout app had comments about a mentally unstable man hanging around this shelter.  We decided not to got there. There was a Trout brook that had some water flowing according to Farout.  We got to Trout brook and it did have some water.  We each filled up.  Trail angels had also left gallons of water at various roads.  When we approached Kloibers Pond looking for stealth site, someone had left just enough water for the two of us.  It was amazing, and we felt much better.  The pond was a ways down, through the brush.  We were able to relax, and set up our tents.  I boiled some water and had some tea and a pasta meal.  We tried to sleep. The bugs, frogs, people, fireworks, and mainly the geese were making noise all night.  Then, when they did quiet down, we heard a tree fall! We couldn't hang our food bags because all the trees were just straight, without out low branches. We didn't have any bear or rodent issues though.  It was a sticky night, and we didn't even need our sleeping bags.  I slept a little, but not too good.

I was getting tired, I took a break looking up at the steep rocks.  I was soaked, and overheating.  Every chance I had water, I would fill up and wet my whole head and bandana.  I drank the electrolytes all along too. 
 There were so many tough rock climbs this day, I can't even remember them all. It was seemingly never ending.  I walked through Harriman State Park, many people were out having cookouts.  I thought of going to ask for a hot dog bun.  My stomach was getting upset, and I was having trouble eating my trail snacks.  The hot dog I ate the day before seemed to calm my stomach and give me energy.  I didn't ask, just took a break and tried to eat what I had.  Gummy bears have become a favorite, but not long lasting.  I carried on, but I was struggling.  At the end of one climb the water jug had a note saying, you just survived Agony and Grind.  Pretty much, how I felt.  I took another break near where many day hikers roam around. I enjoyed people watching people from a different area than me.  I saw a few SOBO thru hikes in the are, and warned them of the Agony and Grind!  One said he was going to just keep walking as far as he could today, because he couldn't stand the up and down rocks anymore.  I tried to carry on, but was really running out of gas.  I thought, I'll just stop at the next shelter"" but then I would be separated from Sherri, and I needed water.  I was starting to hallucinate too.  I was looking for the shelter and every rock looked like a tent, or a shelter roof.  I found the Fingerboard Shelter, it was a little of trail. I thought I saw a car ahead, thinking there was a road with some water.  I walked forward, but there was no road, car, or water!  I said, well, I'm certainly not walking backward to the shelter.  I pushed on, the terrain did calm down and I was able to compose myself.  I came to the road bout 2 miles down, and there was water there.  I filled up, cooled down and pushed on the shelter where Sherri was.  
I still had some daylight, but not much.  I decided to sleep in the shelter, because I had no energy left.  A SOBO thru hiker Moxie was also staying in the shelter.  He showed how to hang my food on the bear cables. We talked a bit, he knew the Natick area.  I went and changed, laid things out to dry as much as possibled.  We heard a new bird sound right before dark.  I told him I thought it was a whipporwhill, but I don't know for sure.  This shelter area was quiet.  It was still humid, but I was able to sleep.  No bugs or mice bothered us at all.  I was shaking.

I slowly climbed, taking breaks as I needed.  There was a nice wooden bench at the top and I took a rest there too. I noticed my arms were sore where they rubbed on my body from moving back and forth.  I looked and sure enough I had a rash on the underside of both arms.  I had a chapstick, so I rubbed the areas with that.  I was wet from the humidity, and feeling overheated again.  I could now see the Hudson River and the tower on Bear Mountain.  I felt hopeful I could make it!  Although I still had thoughts of calling George or Sherri to come pick me up throughout the day.
There were many people out at Harriman State Park enjoying the holiday and the nice weather.  They were casually walking and talking.  I did pass some more SOBO thru hikers today as well.  Most of them were men, only 2 women. The climb up Bear mountain was quite long, it had a lot of switchbacks, and there were lots of people out.  I eventually got to the top, many people were up there, because there is also a road that you can drive up.  I again thought, ""Should I ask someone for a ride down?"" I saw a vending machine, many people were waiting in line to get a cold drink.  I sat on the rocks nearby and enjoyed a cold Coke and a bag of Lays potato chips.  It was so goo to stop moving, cool off, and just watch the people.  I filled up on water and got a popsicle too.
It was time to head down.  Much more people were climbing up on the side of the mountain.  The descent had many more man made steps, coping stones on the sides, it was very well done. I was amazed at all of the work that must have gone into this.  I made it down to the Bear mountain recreations area.  There was a pond with paddle boats, bathrooms, a huge field, vending machines, and hundreds, probably thousands of people.  I didn't stop long here, I looked for the trail for a bit.  I knew it went through the Trailside zoo, so I just followed the sign to the zoo. I walked on through, the bears were the only animals I saw.  One of the workers asked me if I was thru hiking.  I said ""No, just out for the weekend.""  I really couldn't imagine staying out for another day, unless I had dry clothes or a dryer.  he stated this was the lowest point on the entire Appalachian trail.  The zoo wasn't very long and I came out to the Bear Mountain bridge over the Hudson river. 
This was amazing too.  I took some photos, right behind the bridge was South Mountain, the final mountain of the hike.  I made it over the bridge, then texted Nick that I was 2 miles from my car, but it was uphill and downhill.  I crossed the road, thankful again it was a holiday and traffic wasn't too busy.  I began to climb, and quickly noticed it was a steep climb for a mile.  I was in agony again.  Some day hikers were out just climbing up and down happily.  I man with a Jewish cap on his head was descending happily with his young daughter.  We said Hi and he asked how I was doing. i said "" I'm on the last mile of a 40 miles trek""  He encouraged me and was very smiley.  This helped me continue.  Shortly after that raindrops began, but not just the usual light rain we've been getting, but a good soaking rain.  I just stopped and let the rain wash over me.  I felt about 20 degrees cooler almost instantly. I was hiking, and thanking God, Jesus, Buddha, Mother Nature and aby being that could hear me! It was still a struggle, but I made it to the top.  I came to the campsite that was just above where our cars were. I took one more rest here.  The trail was a river, my feet were soaked. I made it down to the flat area.  Finally, I could see my car, and I was almost out out the woods an Owl hooted 2 times.  I just laughed to myself, and said thank you, until next time!","William Brien Memorial Shelter mile 1397.4

They had heavy packs, and were drained.  I changed my wet shirt and put on a dry one. We hiked along to the ridge, it was still a bit cloudy, but the trail was easy to follow as it has rocks on either side.  This is the Alpine Zone and they don't want people walking off trail.  Suddenly, I was at the summit of Lincoln, the at the summit of Lafayette.  It was amazing!  Sherri went up ahead at her pace.  I was descending off Lafayette and the clouds broke and sun appeared.  I could see the view, and I could see where I was heading.  I was about half way for the day, and I was feeling pretty good.  Trying to drink electrolytes and eat what I could.  I hiked down and then up Mt Garfield, I knew there was another water source at the Garfield ridge campsite.  I filled p there and proceeded the descent.  The descent turned into a steep river, very difficult, and I was getting tired.  I was moving along, so I thought.

I thought, I would have rather stayed at the campsite than continue this descent.  I think I had like 3 miles to go, but it was now raining and getting dark.  I put on my rain jacker and headlamp.  The headlamp worked a little better in the dark of night, but my breath was making a smoke that was obscuring my sight.  The AT in NH is not blazed very well at all, and I didn't have confidence or reassurance that I was on the right track.  I had to check the Farout app a couple of time.  I did send a check-in, in case something happened to me.  I've had hypothermia before, and I could tell it was beginning to set in.   I put on my glove which we still dry and continued.  My legs could barely move, even though it was downhill.  I finally saw the lights of the hut and walked up a small incline, to see the stars shining, and the milky way.  It was amazing, but it was all I could do to find the door handle and get inside.  I knew I had to change, I asked where the bathroom was, but Sherri said we had the room to ourselves.  The were two other young men there also.  I changed and dried off as fast as I could. I was delirious as I was talking Sherri, I had no idea what I was saying.  I went out to the dining room and tried to eat some soup and drink some hot tea.  I could barely eat.  Ben and Andrew were at the table with me, talking. I was glad they were there.  They said they would have come out to find me if I wasn't there by 9pm.  I think I made there by like 8:15pm.  Sherri was in bed trying to keep warm.  I went to bed soon after, but my body was not having it.  I had heartburn, and my body was trembling.  I sat up, thinking I had to burp, but then suddenly I had to vomit.  I vomited mostly water some corn from the soup I ate.  I was like, whoa, that's crazy and hasn't happened to me before, although I do feel nausea after hiking for 10-12 hours. I felt better after that and was able to get some sleep.  We awoke to a young girl singing Shenandoah river, she had a beautiful voice.  She served us breakfast, I still couldn't eat the oatmeal, but the eggs and bacon were just what I needed to carry on to day 2","Liberty Spring Trailhead mile 1821.3

SueBee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658386,"We awoke to a young girl singing Shenandoah river, she had a beautiful voice.  She served us breakfast, I still couldn't eat much of the oatmeal, but the eggs and bacon were just what I needed!  We chatted more with Andrew and Ben.  They had a big 18 mile day over Zealand and the Bonds.  We were just going to Zealand, and staying overnight there.  I was glad it was a shorter day, but I felt I was at a deficit.  I would just go at my pace.  We did tag Galehead Mountain without our packs, it was only about .5 miles.  We grabbed our packs then headed up South Twin.  It was a steady climb.  I could see Mt Garfield and the Franconia ride when I stopped and turned around. I was amazed how that mountain nearly broke me, I felt so humble and weak.  I am after all just a human being.  I decided I would not try to tag North Twin mountain, as it was a mile off the AT from South Twin.  After summiting South Twin the trail turned into large rocks, no trees, a different king of Alpine zone than the ridge.  It was sunny today, luckily I had dry clothes, but I had to carry all my wet clothes and towels.  I stopped and turned around, I saw two black birds flying by.  I thought they were crows, but they were flying quite fast.  The birds turned around and I could see the wings were turned and pointed at the end.  I then realized they must be the peregrine falcons, they were amazing to see, I wish I got a video, but like I said they were fast! I didn't eat or drink much at all today, I was afraid to upset my stomach.  I just drank little bits and ate some sugar candy.  I felt okay, but not great.  I carried on, got back into the tree line.  It was becoming more wet, more water crossings and waterfalls.  I had come to a sign that said AT and hut, and I read it wrong and took the wrong trail which was a steep rooty descent. I thought I heard voices, so I thought I was heading to the hut, but no, I was off trail and had to hike back up, then it was another 2 miles or so to the Zealand hut. I passed the beautiful waterfall and took a breath.  I made it to the hut by about 5:15.  Sherri and I were the only ones staying there!  We felt like queens, spreading all of our stuff out.  I changed and got everything settled, Sherri chose the high bunk with a window, so she could see the stars.  I was then thinking, imagine if the hut was full and I was on the top bunk and I vomited!  Thank goodness no one else was in our room the night before.  We had a lovely CiCi serving us dinner. The kale salad was delicious! My body was like Yay!  She made French onion soup, which also went down well.  After that I couldn't eat much again.  She had made butternut squash ravioli with sage butter.  I got two down, then had to stop.  It was warmer at this hut, even though the clouds were rolling in again, and some rain.  We chatted, grabbed some books, cleaned up and went to bed.  I took a couple of Tylenol PM and was asleep fast.  I slept well, actually got hot and had to delayer a bit.  We awoke to guitar this time, although I missed it because I was in the bathroom.","Galehead Hut mile 1834.2

SueBee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658387,"We awoke to guitar this time, although I missed it because I was in the bathroom. The young man, whose name I never got was making breakfast today.  He was a bit green, and didn't interact with us much.  We had an egg, bacon and oatmeal.  Still can't eat oatmeal while hiking.  I had done this trail down before, the Ethan Pond Trail.  It was beautiful, a mixture of vistas, waterfalls, bogs, roots and rocks.  I decided I would take the side trail to see the Thoreau Falls this time.  It was amazing, you could see the water falling for about a mile, with the backdrop of a mountain and some of the fall colors, green, yellow and red!  The trail was flatter today, I was so grateful.  It did involve a lot of balancing on rocks, planks, avoiding mud, etc.  I was hoping to see a moose, but I didn't.  I did see moose tracks yesterday, surprisingly up near the Alpine Zone.  I would really like to see a moose bouldering someday.  I did see a grouse, a red squirrel and a chipmunk.  I gave the chipmunk some peanut m & m's.  I passed some hikers climbing up, some day hikers and some with full packs.  They were all full of energy.  I then got down near the parking lot and met a man having a rest, making some tea.  He had an English accent, but I didn't ask where he was from.  He commented how unhelpful the kids at the hut were about where the trail was.  I agreed that they seemed a little green to be working up there alone.  I could see some more day hikers and knew the parking lot was near.  Sherri got there before me and had gone to the store for some pizza.  I got down about 1pm.  It was a mixed cloudy and sunny day.  The foliage was beginning to pop, many tour busses were coming through Crawford Notch.  We headed back to get Sherri's car at the Liberty Springs trailhead, then back to Lafayette campground.  We both headed for the showers.  It was so nice...but when we opened the door to get out of the shower it was pouring rain!  I just went to my car and laid down.  I was able to get some service and catch up on Youtube videos, etc.  The rain never let up, and we had to stay in our cars from then on.  I was awake at 11:00pm, not able to sleep.  I finally slept and woke up  to a still cloudy, cold day.  Everything was damp, and we really couldn't do much.  We decided to head home, and get our stuff dried.  It was an adventure for sure.  Amazingly beautiful and demanding!","Zealand Falls Hut mile 1841.2

SueBee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659323,"Sherri and I had planned this hike a while ago, and I was so excited the weather was looking good.  We both left for the trailhead right after work on Friday.  Traffic wasn't too bad.  I was tired from the work week though.  I got to Trescott Rd. and struggled to find the trailhead, it was twilight, and the road was windy with set back houses on it.  I did find a trailhead parking lot that had some cars in it, so I parked there.  Some bikers were coming out of the woods, and I was unable to fully relax.  I drove up and down the road trying to find a smaller trailhead, but I couldn't find it.  I was brushing my teeth when Sherri called and said she couldn't find the trailhead either.  I drove down to where she was, and we just parked at the bigger trailhead.  Sure enough, at 4:30am many trucks pulled in to the parking area, left their trucks running, and were talking loudly.  Apparently this is a parking area for hunters as well.  I was awake anyway, but was anxious for them to leave, so I could get dressed, etc.  They finally left, and I decided to go to Starbucks for coffee and something to eat in the town of Hanover.  It was a quiet, foggy morning.  People were just starting to stir.  I got back to the parking area, we got ready four our day's hike.  Sherri was going to drop me off near the trail, then go park at Lyme-Dorchester Rd and hike south back to my car.  I was using the Farout app to locate the trail, then we saw the small AT parking lot!  I had Sherri bring me back to my car, and I moved it to this lot, so Sherri wouldn't have to walk another 1/2 mile for nothing.  I felt better with my car out of that other parking area too.  It was about 7am when I hit the trail.  I was able to get a blaze orange vest from the other parking lot also.  I was glad, because there were so many hunters out today.  NH rules are different from MA, I didn't know it was black powder season, because in MA it's only bow season.  I was a frosty morning, and I did see a deer running off in a field area.  It warmed up quickly, I delayered and hiked on.  The trail was not too steep, and I was feeling good with the cooler temperatures.  I was listening to an audiobook as well.  I got to the summit of Moose Mountain and took a rest.  It was quite sunny up there, but it felt good.  I had about 2 liters of water on me, and it was just enough.  I did have my water filter on me, but remembered that it can't freeze.  I think it was safe in my car overnight.  I never used it though.  It was a pleasant day of hiking, my stomach was much better on this trip.  I took a Nexium pill to help with the heartburn I get while drinking so much water, and climbing up and down hills for 10 hours.  It worked, and I was grateful!  I got to Lyme-Dorchester Rd about 4:30, there were many other cars in lot too.  I got there before Sherri, surprisingly.  She had to drive my car back to spot, she's usually a much faster hiker than me. She said she was sluggish this day though.  I changed my shirt, just sat in her car warming up a bit.  I had some more to drink, and had a snack while relaxing.  The trail head was right on the river.  Hikers and hunters were coming down and leaving the trailhead too.  Sherri came along in about 20 minutes.  We changed, had dinner, chatted and got ready for bed.  We'd get up early the next day, and we had Smarts and Cube to get over.  The stars were shining bright!","Trescott Rd mile 1756.6

SueBee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659324,"We awoke early, we were the only cars at the trailhead.  It was a peaceful night, a bit chilly.  The skies were bright with stars, they look a bit more yellow at 5am.   We got dressed, etc.  I needed some warm coffee before I started my hike.  I was going straight uphill in the dark.  Sherri was driving my car over to Route 25A and hiking South.  She wasn't sure which way to go, as there was no cell/GPS service.  We looked at the map at the parking area, and she remembered some of the road names.  Hopefully she'd get service on the way and find the parking area.  I offered to do the driving today, but she wanted to.  I'll do more driving on the next one.  I was bundled up with my headlamp on.  It was dark, but calm.  I wasn't afraid at all, I knew the sun would be coming around very soon.  It's amazing hiking into the sunrise, so many colors and so peaceful.  
I got to an outlook called Lambert Ridge, I could see the many colors of orange and pink against the black mountains.  I could also see Smarts Mountain from here.  I delayered, went to the bathroom and ate and drank.  I was feeling good, I definitely like it cooler, I think it was about 46 degrees.  It was a bit warmer than the day before, so I did bring an extra water bottle.  I hiked on, listening to an audiobook.  I climbed up to Moose Mountain, the sun was shining bright now, it felt good.  I stopped and had lunch and soaked up some sun.  The trail became more dense after this, and I felt a tick on my hand.  I brushed it off and hiked on.  I then felt like a hair was hitting my left ear.  I pushed my hair in, but continued to feel something there.  I made it up to Smarts Mountain and got my phone out to look at myself.  Sure enough there was a tick crawling on my neck! I squeezed it this time, to make sure it was off of me.  I hiked on down, still feeling good.  I met Sherri halfway, gave her some trail notes and tick information.  She was feeling good too.  She said Mt Cube was tough too, with some water crossing.  
I made it to Mt Cube, got a little off track on some of the ledges. I could see Smarts Mountain from this side now.  I didn't stop much, but I was slowing down.  It was hotter on the slabs, and I was now about 25 miles in for the weekend.  I was about to hit my 400th mile on the AT!  I did stop and make a sign out of rocks to acknowledge it.  The trail was kind of messy on the descent of Mt Cube.  I did like the water crossings, but there were more leaves on this side too.  I just kept going, however slowly.  I knew I would get to the end soon.  Those last few miles are always tough for me.  The terrain was a gradual downhill, so I feel like I could have gone faster, but the feet and legs said Nope.  I made it out to my car at about 4:30.  I just changed, got some fresh water, a snack, and headed home.  I too, didn't have service and didn't know which way to go.  I used my Farout App to determine where I was, and which way the highway was.  I was able to drive West and catch 91 South to 89 South.  A beautiful ride!  We had a great weekend on the AT for sure!","Lyme-Dorchester Rd. mile 1771.6

SueBee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659713,"Today is the last day of 2022.  The weather has been super cold last week, but warmed up for this weekend.  Rain will be coming through last tonight, but not today! I drove up to the trailhead early and arrived at about 8:00am.  There were quite a few cars there already.  I needed to get some of the miles between this trailhead an Rt 25, so I just hiked along without my backpack.  I did need my spikes, gaiters and poles though.  It was a road walk for a bit, not too well marked, but I found it pretty well.  This also gave me an idea of what the trail would be like tomorrow.  
I got back to my car, got my pack and headed up!  It was a steady uphill, similar to the Hancock's I thought.  The trail was still a firm snow pack which was great.  There were quite a few hikers out today, so I certainly didn't feel alone.  Everybody was happy, even though we knew there wouldn't be a view at the summit.  I hiked in just my shirt and pants, I had my gloves handy.  As I approached the summit it quickly became windy and much colder.  I put on my headband, gloves and rain jacket.  I felt comfortable.  The summit isn't far once you get above tree line.  I hit the summit sign and decided to go forward a bit more to the Beaver Brook Trail sign.  I put my mittens on, my hand were getting cold quick.  I just turn around and headed back down.  The snow was becoming more mushy and I did slip and slide quite a bit.  It was slow going down.  There was just no way to prevent a slip if I tried to go any faster.  There were some people ahead of me, going about the same pace.  I made it down back to my car about 3:30. 
 I had a room at the Notch Hostel, so I found my way over there down Rt 118, a bendy mountain road.  Serena, the owner checked me in, and told me which bed I had.  This was my first stay at a hostel, and it was New Year's Eve.  She had a pot luck party planned.  I brought some pasta salad.  There were lots of people there, some staying at the hostel and some just for the party.  I haven't been to a house party since my drinking days.  They were all very nice young people, not drinking crazy either.  I took a shower and relaxed on my bed for a bit.  I was getting hungry, but dinner wasn't until 7pm.  There were some snack on, which I enjoyed.  I met a few people, but it was hard for me to talk in a big group.  I was just tired and hungry.  I ended up grabbing some of my pasta and just eating that at the table.  Serena had some ornaments to decorate, so I made a couple of them, and chatted with some people.  More food was coming out, and more people were coming in.  Many people had costumes on, for fun!  I ultimately checked out of the party at about 8:00pm.  I had the room to myself, there were 5 beds in my room.  I had met the people that were in my room downstairs, so that was cool.  I watched a movie and was probably asleep by 10pm. I heard nothing from the partiers, and slept well until about 7am.","NH RT 25 1795.4

SueBee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659714,"I awoke at about 7am and headed downstairs. It was quiet, and there was glitter everywhere! It looked like quite a party, I can't believe I didn't hear anything. There was coffee made.  I was so excited for that.  I grabbed a cup and found a nice corner chair.  I was able to relax while drinking my coffee, reading some hiking books with awesome pictures too.  I grabbed a second cup, and was surprised how quiet it was all morning.  I had arranged for a shuttle to pick me up at Rt 25 at 11:00am. It was nice to relax in the morning, I really needed that.  I got dressed and headed out.  If found my way down 118, I was glad to have time because it's a bendy road.  It would rain at times, then stop.  Marlene picked my right on time, she said she had a busy night driving NYE partiers around.  She dropped me off, I had my jacket and gloves on to start.  
The trail started out pretty rough with ice, not solid and deeper water beneath it. Then snow, then snow covered planks, then mud and roots and ice.   It was about a mile of slow going.  I had to get my bearing with the blazes too.  There weren't any people tracks to follow.  The trail did reveal itself, and it was a well blazed section.  I was moving along now, warming up.  I took off my jacket and gloves, and got going.  There were so many animal tracks, I was loving that.  The trail cleared up when it went uphill, then it became a pine forest.  So many blow downs and branches everywhere.  I took a couple of breaks, trying to eat enough and drink more water.  I have a hard time drinking the cold water.  I started later in the day, so I knew I'd be hiking toward sundown.  The day was seeming longer for this reason, I think.  I was hiking along and I saw some big animal tracks, then I looked up, and there was a big Moose right on trail!  I stopped, grabbed my phone to try to get a picture.  She looked right at me, but I only got a picture of her sideways in the trees.  As soon as she saw, she trotted down the side mountain, I saw another moose down there too.  They were gone in seconds, I was trying to catch up, but there was no way.  I can't believe I actually saw a moose so close.  So, I spent the next mile, not paying attention to walking, and just looking for the moose.  
I said to myself, get busy walking.  It was getting colder at times, but not bad at all.  I carried on, I could hear the road.  I thought I was close to it, but it was probably another 2 miles.  It was getting dark, so I got on my headlamp.  Good thing, because the trail turned into a rock scramble.  I then heard coyotes howling to each other for about 5 minutes.  They were just getting going, I think.  I was like, I'm done and ready to rest.  I mad it to my car, and headed back to the Notch Hostel, I was glad I knew 118 well by now, because it was dark.  No street lights up here.  Tonight at the hostel was a Fireside Chat with a trail athlete.  I had a shower, some dinner in my nice corner chair again.  The house was full.  It was a wonderful presentation, and so inspirational.  I will never be a 20-30 mile a day hiker, but it is great to be around people who strive for something and try to attain it.  This guy actually did it on his third attempt.  He hiked every trail in the White Mountain guidebook in one season.  Basically 2000 miles with 8000 feet of elevation in 3 months!  Also, in attendance were some guys I've seen on social media.  Nice guys too.  It was a great experience at the hostel, I did feel a bit older, but it was nice to be around so many like minded people, and see the younger generation enjoying the outdoors as much as I do.","NH Route 25A mile 1785.7
