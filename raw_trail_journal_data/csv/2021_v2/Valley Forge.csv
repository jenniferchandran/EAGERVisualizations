Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639289,"A book called ""Start with Why"" was a corporate fad a decade ago. Using Apple and others as examples, it examined how they evolved their businesses around a core raison d'etre. Rather than being a computer maker, Apple's why is to empower people with intuitive technology. That's how they came to dominate the music and phone businesses rather than remaining a niche vendor for graphic arts professionals. My former employer, a financial software company, came up with its own Why, though it was a bit forced and didn't influence our actions very much. That soured me on the concept for many years. 
I first heard the concept of Why applied to hiking in a book called ""Appalachian Trials"". A hiker's Why, like a company's, isn't supposed to be a list of checkboxes to complete. It's a touchstone to remind us, especially on difficult days, why we're out here and to motivate us to continue. The books uses a carrot and stick approach, where the carrot is what you hope to gain by finishing and the stick is the consequences you can expect if you quit (shame, disappointment, lack of confidence, etc). But I prefer to focus on the reasons why I came out here, not the reasons for not leaving.
Because I want my Why to have motivational power and not be a superficial artifice like my old company's, it reflects what really drives me to be here. That is not always the deepest thoughts. Sometimes I just wanna have a good time. So here's my Why, in no particular order:
1. Experience SOBO life
While I've logged 5000 miles on the AT,  virtually all of it has been northbound. SOBOs have a very different experience. They start with the trail's most difficult ascent, having no trail legs whatsoever, must then trek 120 miles without resupply, and then enter the most grueling stretch of the trail, 300 miles of huge climbs and descents. My section hike will cover this entire trial by fire. I've always been curious as to how I'd do starting the trail at the harder end. In addition to comparing it with my own NOBO experience, I hope to learn how first-timers view the journey by meeting as many SOBOs as I can. 
2. Maine's ponds
I mean, if there's a better place in the world to take a swim surrounded only by nature than in northern Maine's pristine ponds, I haven't found it. My first time through Maine I was in too much of a hurry to swim. I'll never make that mistake again. 
3. Boulder scrambles and open views
Nothing wakes you up like a steep, precarious and exhausting scramble to the top of an alpine bald with hundred-mile views. Epic hiking almost every day in Maine.
4. Get out of your comfort zone
This is becoming second nature by now. If I'm not feeling at least a little nervous I'm doing it wrong. Just choosing to go SOBO is creating new challenges.
5. Enjoy the ride
There's no point in being out here if I'm not enjoying it on one level or another (type 2 fun is still fun!) Accept and adapt to things I can't control. Keep a positive attitude and look for the bright side. The trail really does provide, and an opportunity often grows from a seeming disappointment. There are no bad days, only bad attitudes.",,View Entry,"Jun 14, Mon",0
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639322,"I feel like I'm throwing this hike together at the last minute. I'm about to climb the toughest mountain on the AT and go off in the wilderness for a week with no access to resupply. But here I am tossing all my gear together this morning, an hour before I need to get to the train station and head for Maine. 
I pulled all the gear together, cross-checked against my packing list on lighterpack (https://lighterpack.com/r/ja4w9b), and stacked it all nicely in my ULA CDT frameless backpack. Then I weighed it and it came out two pounds more than I expected. Okay, big deal you think, but for a UL hiker that's a 20% error! The pack is built to carry 18 pounds, and I'll be carrying 15 pounds of food and water to start the 100 Mile Wilderness, so when the base weight comes in over 12 pounds instead of under 10 as planned that's a problem. 
So I hurriedly tore everything apart and weighed things individually to see where the extra weight came from. Some items like the pack, sleeping pad, and tent were heavier than they had been when new. Apparently all that dirt that never scrubbed out weighs something. 
There were a few false alarms as well. The biggest of which was that I had secured my trekking poles in the middle of the pack to prevent damage. Since I normally carry the poles they aren't part of my baseweight. Accounting for those and a few smaller add-ons I figured out my baseweight had increased maybe a pound. Not happy about it, but I'd rather have these items than not. After the 100 Mile Wilderness resupply will be more frequent and the pack will rarely exceed 18 pounds total.
But trekking poles raise another issue I'd put off to the last minute. In flying to Bangor, Maine, I wanted to avoid checking a bag. Both because it could be lost and because of the extra fee. But things like trekking poles, my pocketknife (tiny as it is), tent stakes and even my cathole trowel are prohibited from carry-ons by the TSA. I'd heard of other hikers getting their poles through security. So I figured I'd pack everything and see what happened. Worst case, I'd have to check a bag. 
Still, I was nervous I would be delayed or somehow lose the poles at security. Checking a bag made sense but I balked at the cost. Distracting myself from the dilemma, I went to check in for the flight online. The site unsurprisingly tried to upsell me to First Class. But instead of the $300 upgrade it would have been, it was now just $47. Apparently American Airline's algorithm had figured out this was the sweet spot to squeeze a little more revenue from their puddle jumper. I took it. It was an easy decision for two reasons. First Class came with free checked bags, and just checking a bag would cost $30. So I could enjoy First Class for effectively a few bucks. The other reason was that this looked like serendipity, a ""trail provides"" moment, that shouldn't be turned down. Part of an adventure is walking through open doors. You never know where they might lead. Besides, I haven't flown First Class since a trip to India in college when coach class was overbooked and they had nowhere else to seat me and my friend. So it was about time. 
My daughter drove me to the train station, where after a couple connections I arrived at the Philly airport. The flight to Bangor was little more than an hour. So quick the upgrade hardly seemed worth it! The plane pitched out over the Atlantic for half of it, which I discovered to my surprise when I glanced out looking for landmarks to find no land at all. 
Leaving the Bangor airport I passed a gazebo where a young guy in a flannel shirt and sandals was playing a guitar. Seemed like a local hipster and I almost thought he was playing for money until he called out and asked if I was thruhiking. Looking closer I saw a large backpack by his feet. He introduced himself as Johnny Appleseed, a 2017 NOBO thruhiker going SOBO this year. He comes from Asheville, North Carolina but grew up in Raleigh. Or, as he put it, left the Yuppies for the Hippies. He's teaching himself the guitar, which he intends to carry the length of the trail after being inspired in 2017 by hiking with four - yes four - guitar-carrying thruhikers.
I resupplied at the Hannaford's supermarket nearby, yet another task I left to the last minute. I left the stove behind to save weight and because it's summer. But that makes putting together lightweight meals challenging, especially for seven days. I ended up with a lot of tuna, salmon and chicken packets, tortillas, cheese, salami, and granola bars. I couldn't bring myself to carry a jar of peanut butter yet. 
The Cyr bus took Johnny and me up I-95 to Medway, where a girl from the AT Lodge was waiting to pick us up. Two other SOBOs, Sully and Daniel, joined us. From North Carolina, they've been hiking the southern mountains for years and came up here to start in unfamiliar terrain. 
Our host peppered us with questions about our plans. Were we staying two nights to take advantage of their SOBO workshop? Did we need a food drop? If not, did we have 20 pounds of food (10 days worth)? Don't underestimate Katahdin or the Wilderness she warned. I appreciated her caution for first timers. But having done this section three times already, never needing more than six days, it felt a bit condescending. Johnny had the idea of hiking across the Knife Edge to reach Katahdin then hiking out of Baxter the same day. This prompted a lecture from our driver about the difficulty of that hike and the logistical problems. In the end she rhetorically wiped her hands of any guilt by deferring to him ""if you know what you're doing"". 
At the hostel are a mix of SOBOs leaving tomorrow, others spending tomorrow prepping, others returning after encountering problems in the first week, and even a NOBO, a young kid called Mighty Mouse, who just finished the trail in 93 days, the fifth NOBO to finish this year. One SOBO was back after tweaking his knee 40 miles in. Another father/son duo were leaving the trail after a week because it was ""not what I expected"", a common refrain I've heard among new NOBOs as well. 
Johnny and I pre-loaded carbs at Scootic restaurant across the street, trading barbs with a waitress who begged us to get her fired.  
Time to turn in. The sun rises ungodly early here at this time of year. And there are mountains to climb...",,View Entry,"Jun 15, Tue",0
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639745,"Left the AT Lodge just after 6. Breakfast was meager compared to my expectations - a frozen egg sandwich. Apparently the cafe has closed, but this isn't mentioned in their SOBO Special that advertises breakfast. Ole Man drove, giving tips and warnings throughout the hour-long drive, but I couldn't hear much in back. We arrived at the ranger station in Katahdin Stream Campground, loaded up daypacks borrowed from the rangers, then got another talk from Ranger Tim before he wrote out permit cards for us. Baxter Park is notoriously strict in controlling usage. I understand limits on cars and camping, but writing each prospective thruhiker a special permit we must produce on demand seems gratuitous. We have camping or parking reservations just like other visitors, who are not subject to this permit. People often warn SOBOs to plan ahead because they'll be treated like any other visitor. Nope - they have to jump through even more hoops. Baxter's thruhiker permits make sense for NOBOs, who are given special consideration because they arrive without any reservations. But SOBOs could easily pass for any normal visitor. The only difference is we walk out of Baxter rather than driving. There's an annual limit on these permits, so burning them on SOBOs is unfair in my view. 
Anyway, as I headed up the trail I felt out of place. I didn't feel the joy I expected at being back here. It felt like I was going through the motions for awhile. This is my fourth ascent of Katahdin so I didn't expect the thrill of the unknown, but at least some excitement at starting a long hike. I needn't have fretted. Within an hour, after sweating out a couple miles, I was happy to be here and looking forward to the journey.
The climb up Katahdin was challenging, but thankfully dry. Above treeline the wind was strong, and the clouds swept briskly over the peaks. 
At Baxter peak the weathered sign stood sentry just as it had eight months ago when I finished my thruhike. A NOBO couple named Link and Smiles were finishing, looking very healthy and fit after 111 days on trail. 
Not long after, two middle-aged guys in blue shirts hiked up. Lemonade and his friend have section hiked the trail over 12 years and were finally finishing. Lemonade seemed ecstatic, like a little kid, as he high-fived and climbed up on the sign. Having done it both ways, I know how he felt. Section hiking is harder in some ways. Having the patience and persistence to carve out sometimes dozens of trips from vacation time and family time is a major challenge. It's not unusual for section hikers to take 30 years to finish. 
Baxter peak was windy and chilly. I threw on the fleece and wind/rainjacket. The sun came and went. After waiting a bit to see if other SOBOs were coming, I hiked towards Hamlin peak, on the western arm of Katahdin. It's a 4000-footer and on my list to complete all the 4Ks in Maine. Last year I climbed 11 of the 14 while thruhiking, often going several miles off trail to bag a peak. Hamlin makes 12. On the way I met fellow peakbaggers Tommy and Pete from the Adirondacks area, tackling New England's Hundred Highest list. After crossing paths and chatting with them several times I learned they were planning to hike a nearby range tomorrow that included North Brother. That's another 4K on my list, and the most difficult to reach. I had originally hoped to hike it while in Baxter, but had given up on it due to the distance from Katahdin, the lack of transportation, and camping restrictions. So this opportunity was too good to ignore. I asked if I might join them, and Pete graciously agreed to pick me up and take me along. We set a date for 7:30 in the morning. As I was saying in my ""Why"" a few days ago, an adventure is made by walking through open doors. Serendipity is not to be passed up. What are the odds I would meet someone doing exactly what I wanted to do but couldn't do on my own? The trail provides.
Hamlin was interesting because it allowed me to spend more time on Katahdin's flattish Tableland, an alpine vista of angular rocks that looked like they had barely weathered, and the hardy plants, mosses, and lichen that call them home. Hamlin provides an excellent view of the north side of Baxter and Pamola peaks and the Knife Edge ridge that runs between them. With insanely steep drop-offs, it's easy to see why the main access trails come from the south.
I returned to Baxter peak to find Johnny Appleseed relaxing in the rocks. He intends to hike directly out of the park today, concerned he may not have enough food to make it to Monson. Two more SOBOs joined us, one with a pin on his shoulder strap reading ""Safety Meeting Officer"".
Johnny and I soon headed down, passing a couple of groups with young kids maneuvering down through the boulders. These kids had climbed all the way to the top. They looked to be around seven or eight. 
Still on the exposed boulders, we saw rain clouds moving in from the west. The shower hit while we were still exposed, the wind sending the drops almost parallel at times. There was even briefly sleet.
After the rain stopped I made it down to tree line. As I descended, the sun came out and the wind dried off my jacket. It became uncomfortably warm. By the time I reached Katahdin Stream, below the waterfall, I was ready to cool off. I stripped down to my shorts and waded into a small pool in the stream's rocky bottom. The water was very brisk but refreshing. Exactly what I needed. I wondered if I could find an opportunity to swim every day in Maine. 
A SOBO named Kevin and his dad were climbing down. Kevin saw me dripping wet and considered the pool I pointed out, but decided against it. He and his dad had already hiked the AT trail leaving the park yesterday, so he'll be jumping into the Wilderness tomorrow. He reported a ranger had actually stopped him to see his permit yesterday. I hadn't heard of that before. The park is getting a little aggressive. 
It was around four when I got back to the campground and retrieved my pack. SOBO couple Melissa and Dave were there, but I didn't get too much out of them. 
I shared a lean-to next to Katahdin Stream with Henry, a William & Mary econ grad from DC who's done a bit of backpacking in Shenandoah, and a couple from Bellingham Washington. The very fidgety guy, trail name Joker, has hiked the PCT 3 times and the CDT twice. His girlfriend Julia, with a very relaxed personality, is attempting her first hike.
Wildflower and Mando, the other couple in this morning's shuttle, came over. I built a fire with birch bark and firewood sold at the ranger station. My cold dinner was prosciutto, salami and cheese wraps, Fritos, and veggie chips. We were all very tired, and laid down as the sun set quite late.","Katahdin Stream Campground

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639746,"Pete and Tommy picked me up at 7:30 from Katahdin Stream Campground and we headed northwest on the Tote Road six miles to the Marston trailhead. On a loop trail we bagged Mounts Coe, South Brother, and North Brother. The last is my 13th Maine 4000-footer. Now I have all the 4K's in Maine except Old Speck, which I can easily get to from the AT in a couple of weeks. 
The hike was fairly gnarly climbing the last half mile to each peak, with lots of boulders and less grooming than more popular trails. Mount Coe had a particularly difficult approach: a half-mile bedrock slab at an improbably steep angle with slippery black slime in some spots. 
We also bagged Fort Mountain. There is no trail to it, only a bushwhacking path trodden by a few other peakbaggers. It was a long one-and-a-half mile roundtrip down into the saddle and up, most of it pushing through dense krumholtz and spruce, many downed trees, boulders, and branches scraping and poking my head and torso and scratching my bare legs. Not as bad as an Arizona bushwhack though: no Cat's Claw here. I lost very little blood! The summit sign was an instrument box from a small plane that went down near here many years ago. 
Each peak gave us a view of Katahdin from a different angle, all of them from the side and rear compared to the iconic front view thruhikers see. If anything it was more impressive as it showed the sheer mass of the mountain, stretching over to Hamlin peak and beyond on one arm of the huge glacial cirque that sits below Baxter peak, and over the Knife Edge to Pamola peak on the other arm. 
On the way out we stopped by a peaceful lake. There a beaver swam slowly across. 
Pete is a Verizon lineman from the Adirondacks in upstate New York. He's been bagging all 46 4000-footers there, though he considers himself an amateur next to Tommy. 
Tommy is a retired Verizon lineman and spends all his time hiking and peakbagging. He's climbed all the 4K's in the Adirondacks and New England (115 total) several times and is working on climbing each in every season. He's also ""redlining"" the Adirondacks, meaning hiking every mile of every trail, and made up a challenge called ""bluelining"" where he canoes all the lakes and ponds. Currently he's working on lists like 52 With a View, which are sub-4000 mountains in the Whites that are worth the climb. Also the Hundred Highest in New England, which Coe, Fort, and South Brother all land on even though they are under 4000. And a list of most difficult trails in the Whites called the Terrifying 25. But best of all, he shared his cheese sticks and monster cookies with me. 
We followed another hiker from Gorham, Maine around the loop who was carrying a stuffed lion to raise awareness for a muscular dystrophy charity he promotes. Like me he wore shorts through the bushwhack but didn't seem to mind. He's meeting his father to hike Katahdin tomorrow, who is a very active hiker despite pushing 80.
Pete drove me back to Katahdin Stream where I jumped on the Blueberry Ledges Trail for a quicker exit from Baxter Park. It was nearly 5 and stealth camping is prohibited in the park. A five mile hike through tranquil forest brought me to the Abol Bridge and campground. Sadly the campground store was closed, so no ice cream or cold drinks today. 
I walked up to where the AT enters the Hundred Mile Wilderness and looked for a place to tent close to the road so I could walk back to the store in the morning. I have five more days until I reach Monson so I want to get a little more food and treat myself to a cold drink for the day. I saw a few possible areas but nothing that looked like home for the night. 
It was fortunate I held off because two minutes later I spied a pond near the trail, and walked around until I found a serene spot on pine needles by the shore. I stripped off my clothes and waded in, washing all the dirt and sweat off and scaring off some small ducks in the process. Pond water feels so soft and silky. The water was a comfortable temperature, and I dried off quickly before dressing and setting up the tent. Dinner was herbed salmon from a foil packet on a tortilla, followed by salami and cheese, Fritos, and M&Ms. 
I left the tent flaps open to catch the sunrise in the morning, and listened to the bullfrogs and occasional loon over the moonlit pond. 
After a few minutes I heard footsteps in the woods nearby. A large animal. Possibly a moose. I couldn't see it, but I heard it munching leaves. I was a little concerned it might run over my tent. Moose have done that to hikers who set up directly on the trail after unsuccessfully looking for a flat area. But it walked past and waded into the pond, still hidden from view by the dim light and a large boulder on shore, and splashed around for quite awhile, probably feeding. Definitely a moose! It wandered to the other shore and off into the darkness.","Katahdin Stream Campground (mile 5.2)

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639764,"Daylight woke me around 4 and the sun was up not long after. It was chillier than I expected, but not uncomfortable. I slept only in underwear and a T-shirt so I could have added more layers. A cold spot runs along the zipper of my 45-degree sleeping bag. 
I rolled over and suddenly it was almost eight, with full sun warming the tent. There was splashing in the pond. This time I had a full view of the moose causing the ruckus. It was smallish, with antlers that still had velvet on them. It walked along the pond's edge not five yards from my tent like I wasn't even there, stopped for a few seconds while I unsuccessfully scrambled for my camera, then moved on. 
I met Wildflower and Mando as I was heading back to the campstore. They stayed at the Abol campground with her parents. Even though the couple has already hiked Springer to Newfound Gap in the Smokies, Wildflower's Mom worries about her and wanted to see her safely off Katadin. 
The campstore was open and, in another bit of serendipity, the owner was about to make sandwiches for the day, so I not only got a supply of cheese sticks and cookies and a cold tea, but a big freshly-made hoagie for lunch. 
Caught up with Wildflower and Mando at Hurd Brook Lean-to. Mando is a schoolteacher who's a big advocate of bringing technology into the classroom, at least for older kids. They're from central Mississippi but looking to relocate to an area with more hiking opportunities. With every state needing teachers his certificate is accepted almost everywhere.
Three NOBOs were just leaving the shelter. Two older guys, Rumbles and No Filter, who started near Marion, Virginia and are flipping back down to finish. With them is a guy about my age, Mr. Freeze, who started in Georgia on February 1st (on the Approach Trail he made sure to note!) and also journals on Trailjournals.com. He recognized me from my journal last year. He'll be finished by the time this posts. Congrats, Mr. Freeze!
After an hour I headed on and soon ran across Dreamer, a white-bearded Erie native,  sprawled on the trail in the shade eating an early lunch. He wrote a book about his 2006 thruhike and has sectioned most of it again since. His right calf sports a large AT tattoo, belying his mild-mannered appearance. In his 70s, he's taking his time through the Widerness and enjoying the moment, shaking his head at hikers who are in a hurry. He started journaling in his 40s after discovering a journal left by his grandmother at the same age. He got to know a woman that he otherwise remembered mostly for her oatmeal raisin cookies.
The trail climbed over Rainbow Ledges for a view of Katahdin. The blueberry bushes that I fondly remember picking over in August are just starting to flower. 
Hiking along Rainbow Lake I was becoming sweaty in the 80 degree heat and hungry. I stopped for a swim among the boulders along the shore, then sat on a rock, ate my hoagie and gazed over the lake while I dried off.
By 4:30 I made it to Rainbow Stream Lean-to where I dropped my pack and backtracked along the stream to immerse myself in a tub under a small waterfall. The roiling water made a natural spa and the pounding waterfall gave an excellent massage. 
After drying off I met a hiker named The Wolf enjoying a smoke. He's from Georgia, 39, ex-Army, and an Afghan vet. He had dayglo painted nails as a lark and was taking it easy southbounding, watching hikers who started after him pass by. ""Twenty-two year olds, man!"" he laughed, as he explained young Henry had kept going.
Stopping at the shelter to use the privy was a four man trail crew from the MATC. Led by a 2019 thruhiker, they were working on placing stone steps a half mile south of the lean-to. It's a two day job and doesn't require power tools, just back-breaking work. I thanked them for all their effort. After experiencing a few bushwhacks I well know the benefits and the cost of maintaining a well-built trail. 
Julia and Joker, the couple I stayed with at Katahdin Stream, were here, but decided to push on a few miles. I'm surprised they are in such a hurry this early. I suspect Joker, the multiple thruhiker, might be encouraging his girlfriend to do too much too soon.
After I ate a satisfying tuna wrap dripping with olive oil, a young northbounder named ID came through. He was nearing the end of a 33 mile day and wearing a head net. He's 20 and got his name by being carded for a beer at Standing Bear Hostel outside the Smokies. Which is hilarious to anyone who's been there, because the helpers there are frequently stoners or drunks and have been known to deal drugs on the side. ID took off after a brief rest to go a few more miles this evening. Soon after, his young friend zipped through, then another, then another guy named Young Chef who stopped for water. He whips up vegan meals on the trail, including hummus today. But variety is challenging out here and he's looking forward to getting back to a real kitchen. 
I decided to stay the night rather than hike another 7 or 8 miles to the next shelter. Tomorrow I will see if I can stay at White House Landing 15 miles away. 
The Wolf is also staying, but he went off to tent to avoid the mosquitoes. They've been mildly annoying most of the day but the Picaridin seems to work well wherever I spray it.","Pond near start of Hundred Mile Wilderness (mile 15.5)

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639766,"Woke up to rain pattering on the metal shelter roof around 4. It sputtered on and off, then gathered strength. The Wolf had gone to tent to escape the mosquitoes, but that looked like a questionable trade-off now. The skeeters are holed up elsewhere so for now I'm dry and unpestered.
The trail crew returned at 7:30. They all have extensive hiking experience. One bags peaks in the Whites. Another hiked 880 miles across the dry trackless canyons of southern Utah. Yet another has hiked the Gila river in New Mexico. They headed out with ladders and buckets into the rain to finish the job. 
As they left, a group of nine friends on their first backpacking trip hiked in. They made breakfast and seemed in good spirits despite the rain.
I passed the trail crew quarrying and placing rocks on the steep sides of a gully. The youngest guy said they'd moved 84 cubic feet of rock. That must weigh at least several tons? ""It's enough that I feel it today!"" he answered, indicating his arms.
On Crescent Pond a couple was fishing from a rowboat. My attention was then grabbed by a cow moose browsing in the water near the shore. I circled her on the trail to get some pictures. She looked at me once or twice, then slowly ambled into the trees. 
On the far shore I passed an overturned aluminum canoe. A couple dozen dragonflies roosted on its hull, soaking up the reflected heat.
Relatively easy trail continued to a viewpoint over Nahmakanta Lake with Katahdin on the horizon. A fiftyish woman named Elizabeth was resting. A SOBO, her daughter had, according to her, talked her into attempting the hike. She sounded less confident and seemed to want to talk and be reassured, so I tried to pep her up. Said she helped a woman climb down Katahdin and was told her name should be Savior or Trail Angel. I suggested the less loaded name Florence Nightingale but she didn't like it. Another hiker later suggested Karma which she seemed to like because she considers herself a yogi. She complained she was carrying too much food and tried to give me her oatmeal. I demurred but took a fruit bar that she said made her constipated.
Two NOBOs raced past as I ascended Nesuntabunt Mountain. One's girlfriend was slackpacking them between logging roads. Pretty good deal. 
The humidity wore me down over Nesuntabunt, and the bugs were active today. Thankfully there's been no more rain since early this morning. 
Also on Nesuntabunt I crossed paths with an older woman lugging a huge backpack and leading a Benji-type dog. They've hiked from Monson and she was still smiling. An older gentleman a few minutes back was not with her, but had taken it upon himself to keep an eye on her.
At Wadleigh Stream Lean-to I stopped for lunch and water. White-haired SOBO Gordon, from Seattle, came in for water. He's hiking halfway to Georgia. So far Maine feels like the Pacific Northwest to him. 
I found my entry in the shelter log from last October. It was the day I got trail magic in the Wilderness. Hot coffee and freshly-made donuts on a camp stove from two brothers who fish the area. Most surprising trail magic I've ever gotten.
Soon after leaving the shelter I went for a dip in Nahmakanta Lake. The sun was shining now. Butterflies congregated on a small rock, so close they jostled and climbed over each other.
I caught up with Gordon. He's a schoolteacher hiking over the summer. Moved to Seattle 30 years ago and loves it, except for how expensive it's become, and the major homeless problem. We encountered Joker and Julia resting nearNahmakanta Stream. Julia forced a smile and said she's holding up well, but they look a bit spent. Fortunately they have a food drop at mile 60 so no need to rush.
Took a break at Nahmakanta Stream Lean-to where Jacob, a thirty-something Brooklyn native schoolteacher, was having trouble lighting a fire due to the damp kindling. He's also on the summer vacation hiking plan, but hopes to piece the whole trail together eventually. This is his first hike since an injury seven years ago, so he's taking it easy.
I took a side trail to Mahar Landing to see if I could spend the night at a fishing camp called White House Landing, one of the few hiker stops I've never visited. But when I got to the shore there was no sign for the boat pickup. There is service here and I called, only to be told that after being closed last year they now require reservations and a two-night stay. Not a hurdle most hikers on trail can clear! Disappointing. I was looking forward to their famous one-pound burger. The Guthooks hiker comments from 2019 agreed that the owners really cared about hikers. 
Plan B - I hiked another 2.5 miles to Potaywadjo Spring Lean-to over easy trail. The trail's been easy all day, with only a few small climbs. Lots of rocks and roots of course, some of which were wet and slippery. But I noticed all the improvements to the trail like rock steps, bog bridges, stepping stones and the like. The trail could be much harder. I imagined what crossing Maine without a trail, or only a deer path, would be like. 
At the shelter I found Henry, last seen at Katahdin Stream campground, already in his sleeping bag. He's been here since 3 waiting out a possible thunderstorm. Thunder has rumbled on and off this afternoon but nothing came of it. A half hour after I arrived though it showered for about twenty minutes.
Henry's seen five moose already, but he told me how one blocked the trail and, when Henry left the trail and hid behind a tree, the moose followed him. It shadowed him for twenty minutes until Henry started singing a silly old camp song about a moose drinking juice. That's when the moose decided to leave.
After the rain a trio of hikers walked in and began setting up tents. It was a father with an adolescent son and daughter. They're finishing a northbound thruhike. Even more impressively, this is the end of their Triple Crown. They hiked the PCT in 2018 and the CDT last year.
Without a stop at White House Landing I need to manage my food to stretch it through the remaining 66 miles. For perspective, I'm only on mile 48 after 4 days, although I've hiked 65 including off-trail miles. Still, I need to average 22 miles a day to finish in the three days for which I estimate I have food. Today I struggled for energy at times thanks to the humidity and possibly not drinking enough. The trail will be tougher ahead. Time to dig a little deeper.","Rainbow Stream Lean-to (mile 30.1)

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639769,"This morning before leaving the shelter I christened Henry Moose Juice after his close encounter yesterday. He liked it. 
The shelter is by Potaywadjo Spring, an artesian spring that bubbles vertically from the ground and is crystal clear. The water was cold and delicious.
Got an early start, aiming for 30 miles today to set up two shorter days into Monson over the Chairback Range. Didn't come out here to rush through Maine, but you gotta do what you gotta do when food is low.
Cruised eight miles over mostly easy trail to Jo Mary Rd, one of two semi-public dirt roads in the Wilderness. Kept up the pace to Cooper Brook Falls Lean-to which has gorgeous cascades. And also a leech-filled swimming hole, one of the few I've passed up.
Caught up with Johnny Appleseed, who I last saw on Katahdin. He's hiking in sandals to strengthen his feet for barefoot hiking eventually, and his feet aren't liking it. We chatted awhile. His name comes from trying his hand at homesteading on land in Nevada and North Carolina. He studied agriculture and has worked for years on farms, landscaping, permaculture and the like.
By 11:30 I reached Crawford Pond, almost 15 miles in. It has an excellent beach which I took full advantage of to swim in the clear, cool water before lunching.
Passed a northbounder named Braveheart getting towards the end of his last section to finish the trail. He tried to thruhike 5 years ago but lost 65 pounds despite eating lots of olive oil and honey, so he switched to sectioning. It looked like he could spare the weight, but losing it so quickly could be concerning, especially if too much of it were upper body muscle loss. He was, in any case, happy with finally nearing Katahdin.
Met a couple when I took a break at East Branch Lean-to who are accompanying a SOBO friend through the Wilderness. Just then another SOBO, a young woman, showed up chatty and frazzled that her food drop hadn't appeared. She asked if she could have the food back that she had given the couple. Then the couple, contemplating a four mile climb to the next shelter, laid down for a nap.
For the second day in a row I found fishing line strung along the trail, this time with a hook and sinker. I gathered it all up to pack out. Hikers have been getting tangled in it. Sorry there will be no ""Trail Provides"" moment for the aspiring angler who hikes along next. Someone needs to watch their gear more carefully.
I continued climbing up to Logan Brook Lean-to to find a SOBO named Zach, the friend of the couple at the last shelter, and his girlfriend Stitches who is also joining him for the Wilderness. Also a young bearded guy I mistook for a youth group chaperone because his shirt reads ""Trip Leader"". An older guy and a younger woman trudged in soon after. The guy had a fishing pole sticking out of his pack, probably my culprit. His name is Trout, and he's caught and cooked fish each day in the Wilderness, often sharing with other hikers. 
Johnny and I pushed on through the last seven miles to cross the White Cap range. We were greeted by a 1300 foot climb that contained hundreds of boulder steps. I thought of that trail crew placing just ten or so steps. What incredible amount of effort went into this? 
The climb was tougher than anything since Katahdin, especially after already hiking 23 miles. We got a clear view of Katahdin near the top. What is that, like six or seven views since Abol Bridge? This is probably the last. The weather was pleasant, not too hot or humid and an occasional breeze, but not enough to staunch the sweat.
The last five miles were up and down over Hay, West Peak, and Gulf Hagas mountains. It was almost more than I could take after this long of a day. I finally reached the Carl Newhall shelter after 8, a 13.5 hour hiking day. 
There was a fun crew here of Gambit, a Freeport, Maine native out for his first section, two girls Jinx and Onward, and Kevin who I met coming down Katahdin. They all seem in great spirits. Hopefully I see more of them after Monson. 
Johnny staggered in as darkness fell, his feet howling. Time to rest up from this marathon day.","Potaywadjo Spring Lean-to (mile 48.3)

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639771,"After yesterday's 30 miles my feet were scolding me this morning. I told them, Tough, we're getting to Monson in two days so suck it up. I was the first one out around 6:30.
Today's goal is a more modest 16 miles, but it includes most of the challenging Chairback range. It started with an easy five miles down to the Gulf Hagas area and the West Branch of the Pleasant River. Here I saw a woman with grey pigtails approaching. She asked if I was Valley Forge. I didn't know her, I hoped nothing was wrong. Turned out she recognized me from my trail journal last year. She introduced herself as Robin from Colorado, now a ridgerunner for the Maine ATC. She was headed up to check out the shelter I'd just left. I mentioned the first aid kit and Sawyer filter plunger I'd found on White Cap mountain and taken down to the shelter last night. 
The Pleasant River was calf high and was so wide it had to be forded. I took off my shoes and socks and leaned on my trekking poles to navigate the bed of slippery rocks. 
The climb up to Chairback mountain was more difficult than I expected. Lot of ledges. Two women sectioning coming down told me it would rain tomorrow and they were concerned about wet footing. Was White Cap as bad as what they just went through? Probably not, I suggested. Turns out I was right. 
After struggling through another mile of boulder and ledge scrambles, I made it to Chairback Gap Lean-to where I found SOBO Green Bag. He's hiked the Wilderness before, but is taking his time. This is day 9 for him, though he zeroed after climbing Katahdin. 
From the shelter I climbed over Columbus mountain and into a gap with a side trail to West Chairback Pond. Several canoes and fishing boats were stored on shore. I waded into the pond but the bottom was deep, muddy and uneven so I just dunked myself and got out. The wind whipped up, drying everything quickly. As I sat watching the pond and journaling, the wind caught a small bird which collided with my right hip. It sat up and stayed next to me, only inches away. I stroked it and examined it to see if anything was broken, but I'm not much of an avian doctor. It opened its mouth several times like it was hungry. After a few minutes I snagged an ant to see if it would eat, but just then it flew off to a bush a couple of feet away. Perhaps it had simply been stunned.
The afternoon was rough going. I averaged little more than a mile an hour over the steep rocky descents and ascents. Even in the ""flat"" areas frequent ledges required scrambling up or down 5 or 10 feet. This may not be the most physically difficult section of the AT, but it's in the top five. For southbounders this is their biggest challenge yet. Nothing in Georgia or North Carolina compares. Compared to these constant jolts and changes of direction, trudging 2000 feet up well-groomed switchbacks is easy. NOBOs got nothing to complain about. 
Met a guy named Lone Star carrying a huge pack he christened Lieutenant Dan, like Forrest Gump carrying him off the battlefield. Lone Star carried in two weeks of food and hikes about seven miles a day. Says he's eating very well, and seems quite content. His younger friend was a short ways ahead, studying one of the many insanely steep rock ascents when I caught up to him. 
After what seemed like a very long and sweaty afternoon I made it to Cloud Pond. It's a beautiful setting, full of bullfrogs, peepers, and numerous birds, dragonflies and other critters. Green Bag made it too, and we set up tents on an outcropping into the pond. I took a dip, but the water was shallow and the bottom rocky and muddy so I didn't stay long. A steady breeze should have dried clothes out quickly, but the humidity has gotten too high. 
After eating the rest of my dinner and lunch foods I retired to the tent and it began to rain. I have lots of granola bars left, but that's about it. If I don't get to Monson tomorrow I'm gonna be an unhappy camper.","Carl Newhall Lean-to (mile 78.6)
",Cloud Pond Lean-to (mile 95.3),"Jun 21, Mon",17
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639778,"Rained steadily last night. The bullfrogs serenaded Green Bag and me all night. They apparently have a lot to say to each other, maybe things like ""I can't sleep, can you?"" It all became white noise after another long day though.
We also heard a train in the distance. Despite the name this is not a remote wilderness.  There are numerous logging roads, tote roads, and recreational access roads crossing or approaching the trail corridor. Getting out is fairly easy with a good map.
So as if to prove the point I looked ahead and found several points where an abandoned woods road crosses the trail and leads to a public road, and thence to Monson. Good to have a back up plan if 19 miles seems too far for today. 
Cloud Pond was literally in a cloud when I woke, water dripping from the trees and no visibility beyond a few dozen yards. I packed up the wet, dirty tent and all my damp clothes and headed over fogged-in Barren Mountain.
The hiking was easier than yesterday, though that's not saying much. Wet rocks and roots make everything harder, and my Lone Peaks shoes slip easily on them. Wooden bog bridges suddenly are treacherous, I duck-footed over anything wet, and avoided rocks and roots whenever possible. That slowed things down. 
A long descent over rocks and ledges led past Long Pond Lean-to and two waterfalls. The second I stopped at to climb down and take a dip in the wading pool below. Keeping up my streak of swimming at least once a day!
I remembered there was a side trail in the area that accessed a road used by Shaw's hostel to slackpack hikers. Another mile in I thought I'd found it. It was a grassy, overgrown doubletrack that led a half mile to a creek where it forded to go one direction. The other fork stayed on this side, but was marked as a snowmobile trail, no other vehicle access. Definitely not the one Shaw's uses. But my map showed it eventually would reach a road that went to town. 
I continued along a very buggy stretch by the creek, some of it flooded out, some overgrown. I took off my sweat-soaked shirt - it's the most humid day so far - and began swatting my shoulders and head with it rhythmically to keep the bugs are bay. Even my Picaridin was having minimal effect.
After a couple miles I reached a maintained road away from open water and less buggy. It quickly turned into a county road, though still dirt. A house was on one side, and a gate on the other where a man stood. I waved and we chatted. He's from southern Maine but winters up here for the snowmobiling in the backcountry. Keep in mind the AT and the ""wilderness"" is less than two miles away. He was waiting on the state biologist to look at a yearling moose that he believed had died of a tick infection, something that's affected the moose population across the state. 
The next house up the road looked very rural compared to the neat vacation home before. A man outside waved and I returned the gesture. Then he called out he was going to town and if I wanted a ride. I'd fully intended to walk all the way to Monson. The adventure as I saw it was discovering what lay just beyond the trail corridor. But like I've said before, if a door opens you walk through it. 
So I got a ride to town from Paul Boynton, who runs a bear hunting camp outside Monson. Says he took pity on me because of the humidity. He's helped many hikers in the past, because the old AT route goes right past his bear camp and hikers sometimes get off there looking for help. 
I think Maine's bear season is the reason the bears keep a low profile here. Apparently there are quite a few of them, but the number of moose sightings far exceeds bear sightings. Paul's hunting groups have taken 500 bear over the years. I'm not a hunter and I understand people coming from different viewpoints on this, but there is a definite separation between the hunting that guys like Paul do and the poachers who kill bears and other animals for trophies. He's found a bear with just the gall bladder removed (worth 40K in Japan for making aphrodisiacs), and a buck with just the head removed for someone's trophy.
Paul delivered me directly to Shaw's, which was humming with activity. NoBox, Smoky Bear, Pappy, Jacob, Lucky Charms, Alex - almost 20 SOBOs in all - plus a couple of flip-floppers headed back to Massachusetts or Harper's Ferry after Katahdin. Also two NOBOs who just finished and were waiting to shuttle out, including a 14-year-old black kid named Huff 'n Puff, who according to the other hiker was crushing miles. 
Got my first shower in a week, laundry, and a light lunch. Didn't feel as hungry as I likely would have walking all the way in. But by the end of the day I managed to down most of a gas station pizza and a small dinner at the pub with Alex and Tyler - both from Pennsylvania - and Pappy who treated us all.","Cloud Pond Lean-to (mile 95.3)

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639783,"I was up at 5:30, offered to help with breakfast but Poet, Shaw's owner, has an impressive system in place to feed two dozen hungry hikers. Eggs, bacon, fried potatoes, and blueberry pancakes - all of it absolutely delicious and more than filling. And of course he made his signature pancake cairn. 
I resupplied, dried all my gear, got a 2021 hang tag at the ATC center in town, took a dip in Monson Pond (another shallow muddy bottom mostly for fishing, but keeps the streak alive!), watched Poet do pack shakedowns, and helped demonstrate the PCT bear hang. But mostly hung out and chatted with everyone. 
Many SOBOs (no northbounders came through today), were concerned about their pack weight and kept Poet busy for hours. Two college freshmen came in, having gotten off 40 miles from Katahdin because their packs were hurting their knees.
I tried to finagle a 2020 hang tag off the lady at the ATC center. I have a small collection starting in 2017. She didn't seem amused. Kind of sad they can't give out a souvenir piece of plastic. But can't say I expected anything more from them. 
There's a BBQ place in Monson which is considered one of the best in Maine (I know, I know), but I've never eaten there before despite three Monson visits because of their weird hours. This year the owners went the full monty and declared their hours to be ""Hit or Miss - On a Whim - By appointment"". Stitches called earlier and got no response. Then around 4:30 word spread through the grapevine that they were open, but only for a couple hours! So Alex, Pappy, Green Bag and I raced over to enjoy some fine North Carolina style pulled pork sandwiches. Maine's finest!
Had only one beer but basically crashed back at the hostel, the accumulation of a week of overstimulation I guess. Back on trail tomorrow.","Monson (mile 114.5)

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639886,"Had every intention of hiking out this morning after another huge breakfast at Shaw's. I settled my tab but didn't hop on the 8:15 shuttle to the Rt 15 trailhead with Alex, Tyler, Joseph, and Pappy. I planned to ""retro-blaze"", or walk the old AT route directly out of town along Lake Hebron.
But first I wanted to take out the kayak Shaw's keeps beside the house. Green Bag helped me carry it the couple hundred yards to the small launch and dock behind the General Store. Then I took it for a circuit around the lake, maybe a couple miles, stopping along the way at one of the very few undeveloped stretches of waterfront to go for a swim. Keeping the streak alive!
Lugging the kayak back myself was a workout. It was 70 pounds, could only be held by one hand, and the handle wasn't balanced so one end dragged on the ground. An elderly man in an electric wheelchair was coming from the old Swedish Lutheran church and saw me struggling. He wanted to help, and even told me to attach one end to his chair, but I didn't think that was a good idea. Instead he accompanied me over to Shaw's and chatted to cheer me on. Very kind of him. Darryl was his name, a Philly native but a Monson resident for 45 years.
Back at the hostel a 2018 thruhiker from San Antonio named Fi'ty Cent was hanging around and giving rides to hikers. Green Bag was shaking down his pack and mailing stuff home. Also around are a couple named Wayfinder and Pacesetter, a long-haired middle-aged guy named Rooster, Lucky Charms, a traveling nurse, Adam (aka Trip Leader), and the girl who missed her food drop. 
Moose Juice and Kevin came in from the trail, both looking happy and proud to have gotten this far. Also a very chatty northbounder finishing the hike he started in 2015, who later walked around shirtless to even out his hiker tan.
One of the common reactions I hear from SOBOs is amazement at how effortlessly and quickly the NOBOs move. ""They just float over the rocks"" one gasped. That's true - coming through the Wilderness it was a big gulf between the smooth, quick, purposeful gait of NOBOs, sometimes a train of them, and the slower uncertain plodding of SOBOs.
I grabbed lunch and for awhile I was trapped by indecision. Should I hike out now, with time still to get to the shelter the others were targeting, or hang out another day and leave with this group tomorrow?  
Hostels (and towns) are often vortices for hikers. I was trapped by the lure of relaxing and eating well. Being after 2 pm it would have been easy to say it was too late. But I knew better.
So I hiked out. Said goodbye to Hippie Chick and Poet. They'll be hiking the El Camino in Spain next spring before the season starts in Maine. That's a trail that's also on my list. Maybe I'll see them out there. 
I walked along Pleasant Street by the lake fronted with tidy homes. The road dead ends after two miles so traffic was almost non-existent. But halfway there a car came along and offered me a ride. It turned out to be a trail maintainer. 
Once at the trail it was 15 miles to the shelter at Bald Mountain Pond. It was uneventful, all green tunnel, little elevation change, almost no ledges or rock scrambles, and mostly followed brook and stream valleys. An impressive gorge in Horseshoe Canyon held a very attractive swimming hole, but it was unfortunately about 100 feet below on an extremely steep slope so I kept moving. 
Several NOBOs passed, including a fiftysomething guy finishing up his 2020 thruhike, having returned at Harper's Ferry. It's still a thruhike, he told me, This trail's too hard to call it anything less.
I barely stopped for five hours, arriving to find Alex, Pappy, Tyler, a wiry loner named Joseph, an intense young guy named Voyager, a giggly black woman named Pearlie, a new guy named Pancho, and Smoky Bear. Smoky is the same guy I met on my thruhike last year in northern Virginia. He's a gruff guy but clearly tickled that I remembered him. After dark, tucked into my warm sleeping bag in the shelter with Voyager, I saw the full moon rising through the trees. It must be a fantastic view over the lake, I said. Voyager urged me to get up and go look. I demurred. But he insisted, pulling out his headlamp so I could find my way. I jokingly cursed him for making me get up. But I'm so glad he did.
I joined a couple other silent observers on the shoreline. The full moon rose over the pond just after sunset. A loon called out its solitary cry over the twinkling waters. Does it get any better?","Monson (mile 114.5)
",Bald Mtn Pond Lean-to (mile 132.4),"Jun 24, Thu",15.70
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640056,"Despite the sublime full moon last night, Bald Mountain Pond was shallow and debris-filled, not an attractive swim spot yesterday or this morning. I would just have to hike until I found something better.
Arriving late to the shelter last night was a guy I'd not met before named Pancho. He had appeared behind me as I was hustling to get in last night and I thought surely he was moving faster and would pass me soon. But he fell back as we hit a hill and he arrived a half hour after me to the shelter. He later told me he had been taking a break when he saw me go by and wanted to see what I was made of. He wasn't happy that I outpaced him, however unintentionally. From Moline Illinois, he yoyo-ed the AT in 2019 (hiked north then south), and last year hiked 1000 miles on the CDT. This year he's repeating the AT and will, as he puts it, finish his Triple Crown in mileage if not in actual trails. He's a trim, muscular guy who carries a large external frame backpack with fading patches from all over the country. With him is a small fox terrier named Foxy Lady that started following him as he hiked around Kansas on the way to the CDT. He has the dog extremely well-trained and it functions as a service dog when in town. 
The day started with a climb up Moxie Bald. At the summit, relaxing behind a wind break, I found Smoky Bear (not ""Smoky THE Bear"" he pointed out). As I mentioned we met in Virginia last year both headed north. He explained that he later got injured in Pennsylvania. After recovering for a few weeks he acquired a kayak and paddled his way down the Schuylkill River, then down the Atlantic coast, eventually making his way back to the Smoky Mountains and hiking the AT south. He has a quick wit and a lot to say, some of which seems to bely his outwardly roguish character. 
I took a side trail to Moxie Bald's North Peak, which has a more open summit with grand 360 degree views including of the upcoming Bigelows. Previous hikers have created a spiral of rocks on one section of bedrock, maybe 50 feet in diameter. I added a rock to the end to keep it growing. Not exactly Leave No Trace, but harmless fun. The side trip added one and half bonus miles so it's rarely visited by thruhikers. The log at the summit had few entries, but all agreed it was worth the trip.
Coming down Moxie Bald I met a northbound couple, Punisher and Boppit. Except they started in Key West, followed the Florida and Pinhoti trails to the AT, and have hiked over 4100 miles so far. Unfortunately they can't cross into Canada to complete the International AT and with it the Eastern Continental Trail. So instead after Katahdin they are headed to Glacier National Park to hike the CDT southbound, another 3000 miles.
Boppit complained about waiting on the Kennebec Ferry. It can only take two passengers at a time, but she was stuck behind a large group of girls. 
Down in the valley it was warm and I was tempted to jump into a lake called Joe's Hole as the trail skirted it on a dirt road. But a hiker I didn't recognize was curled up napping on the dock, which seemed the best place to access the water. 
By the time I reached Pleasant Pond I was ready for a swim. Pancho beat me to it, but I waded right in from the leafy beach over the stony bottom. It looked like a private boat launch was nearby but, seeing no one about, I gave little thought to skinny-dipping. Wet shorts are no fun to hike in. 
Pancho and I walked up through forest towards the shelter, passing a group of about 10 boys out for a backpacking trip. Tyler and Alex already had tents set up even though it was barely 4. Tyler is now called Pre-pack. Apparently this morning he told the others he needed to pack up before his morning safety meeting.
Pappy was also in the shelter, but he was ready to conquer another six miles to get to Caratunk and a soft bed tonight. So he, Pancho and I set off. Or rather Pappy got a head start and Pancho and I never caught him until we hit the highway to Caratunk.
Along the way Pancho and I took a break. Pancho loves Snickers and likes to stop for a Snickers several times a day. Back at the shelter he asked if I wanted one and I said sure, but when he tarried around with his gear for too long I decided I would start moving and suggested we do it later, and he hiked out behind me. Now, as we reached the middle of a big climb he suggested stopping for that Snickers break. After an awkward minute he asked where I kept my Snickers. I started to laugh, then apologized because clearly he'd misunderstood. I don't carry Snickers. I was happy to eat one if offered, but I had none to share. Pancho had eaten his last Snickers that morning and somehow got the idea I had some. He was clearly disappointed so I hid my amusement. He fumbled in his pockets and found a few crumbs of an old Snickers which he carefully nibbled at, declaring it sufficient for the moment. 
At the road, Pappy and I headed to the post office which had an outside phone for hikers to call for pickup. Pancho disappeared, headed he had said for a convenience store. 
We were picked up by the owner's son and taken to the Sterling Inn nearby. It's a bed and breakfast popular with hikers for its cheap lodgings and the owner Eric caters to hikers with a resupply shop, rides, and a comfortable lounge. The son ran us to a restaurant up the road to grab takeout for dinner.
In the lounge I found two girls Timber and Zombie and a guy Forrest, all southbound. Timber had hurt her foot or leg, I didn't get the full story, and all have been zeroing together here for several days. They've been watching DVDs pretty much continuously. I introduced these Millennials to Shakespeare in Love, but I'm not sure it resonated.","Bald Mtn Pond Lean-to (mile 132.4)

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640057,"Slept in, relatively speaking, til after 7 and enjoyed the Sterling's continental breakfast. A couple at breakfast was staying to attend a wedding and had many questions for the two SOBO girls Timber and Zombie who have been resting up for several days.
They and Forrest decided to continue resting today, but moved up the road to tent to save some money. Eric, the owner, opined later that the longer they stay off trail the less likely they are to return.
He'd taken Joseph, who had arrived before Pappy and I yesterday but was unhappy sharing a room, over to the trail earlier and come back with Pancho. Last night Pancho had hitched up to a restaurant and then camped, but hadn't found his way to a convenience store yet. Eric thought he wanted to resupply and so brought him to the Inn which has a resupply store designed for hikers. Pancho's idea of resupply though was tobacco and beer so, disappointed, he walked off to hitch to a store. 
Eric then took Pappy and I to the trail, a little over a mile, where a short walk along the Kennebec brought us to the canoe ferry. We could see Joseph being ferried to the other side. The river looked fordable, even shallow, further north but there were likely deeper channels we couldn't see. Mike the ferryman, standing in for Greg, explained that the upstream dam operators are required by the state to release water daily from 10 to 1 for use by the rafting companies along the river. Water released at 10 doesn't reach here until 2, so the ferry schedule in high season runs only from 9 to 2. This seems to imply one could ford before 2 without worrying about a dam release suddenly raising the water level.
The shore had a little stone jetty to assist in boarding the canoe with dry feet. The passage took only a few minutes. Then the process started anew with a waiting northbounder. Mike does this from 9 to 11 each day until hours extend to 2 pm in July and August.
Pappy and I followed Pierce Pond Stream from its confluence with the Kennebec River up to the pond itself, less than four miles. The plan is to stop there for a short day, rest up from yesterday's late push, and take advantage of the pancake breakfast at nearby Harrison's Pierce Pond fishing camp in the morning. A group of 8 girls passed us on a narrow stretch, heading down to the ferry. The same group Boppit had encountered?
The stream had numerous cascades, rapids, and waterfalls. Very picturesque. I stopped at one with a particularly deep swimming hole below one waterfall and above another. It was difficult getting in and out because the bedrock dropped off steeply, but once in the swimming was fantastic. There was a definite current towards the lower fall, but easily managed. 
Drying off from my usual skinnydip I glimpsed a backpack passing by on the trail thirty yards above and moved to a more modest spot. While I see several people a day moving in both directions there is usually ample time to take a dip before anyone comes along. Swimming in my hiking shorts is generally a bad idea because they can take all day to dry, especially around the waistband, leading to rashes. 
I took the side trail to Tim Harrison's camp. It's a collection of rustic cabins on the hillside over the stream, with an equally rustic lodge holding a kitchen, dining room and lounge with a wood stove, bearskin, and fishing and hunting decor. This is a genuine backwoods camp from early last century, if not older. It used to be owned by the Sterling Inn, which acted as a stage point to send anglers by horse to the camp. 
Tim was out retrieving a tractor from New Hampshire. The camp was empty of fishermen, the busy season being May, but for a caretaker who helped me sign up for tomorrow's breakfast.
The shelter was less than a half mile away. But first I had to ford Pierce Pond Stream. I started rock hopping but halfway across I reached an impasse and had to sit down and take off my shoes. I remember crossing this a couple times before with dry feet. The water level seems a little higher, covering that key rock. I later learned the trail was relocated. It used to cross at the dam where the stream empties from the pond.
The shelter sits in a beautiful spot looking out over the pond. Pancho caught up with us a few minutes later, then a pair of girls - Just Maine and Viewmaster - who had arrived late at the Sterling Inn last night. Pancho is staying for pancakes tomorrow but the girls moved on after having hot tea and muffins. 
After downing a large lunch - hiker hunger has definitely kicked in - I inflated my sleeping pad to submerge it in the lake to find the leak that left it half-inflated two nights ago. I've used this Thermarest Xlite for about 2000 miles, maybe 60-70 nights on trail, and this is the first problem. The leak was easy to find but I had to let it dry first. Rain drizzled on and off so I brought it into the shelter. Then I lay down. Soon I was asleep. 
It was 7 in the evening before I fully awoke. I had no idea I was that tired. The rain had ended but the sky was still overcast. I couldn't resist going for another dip here before eating dinner. The water felt clean and refreshing despite the weather and my not having exerted myself all afternoon. Although the shelter is twenty yards from the water, a thick clump of cedars screens the bedrock shelf used for swimming.  
A group from the Wallace girls' camp near Damariscotta had arrived while I napped and tented a little ways off. They offered me their leftover fusilli pasta. Having no bowl, I had them dump it on a tortilla. After they returned to camp I heard someone say ""You just gave him pasta?"" and minutes later Lila their young counselor came over offering shredded cheese. She confirmed what I suspected. They are from the same twin boys/girl camps - the boys' being Camp Kieve - that I encountered in 2019. There are 3 groups of girls who started from different spots but are all going to Katahdin, a trip of about 180 miles. It's the capstone of their camping careers, a trip they've looked forward to for years. The group of boys Pancho and I passed yesterday near Pleasant Pond must be part of the boys camp. 
Lila later returned to ask how they should protect their food here. Usually they wrap it in a tarp, but tonight they're using the tarp as a raincover. Surprised the camp didn't have clear-cut rules on food storage and trying not to be the trail police, I suggested if all the food were sealed in plastic bags they could store it on the ground well away from camp. Bears fortunately aren't a problem here and, though it's possible rodents could find it despite the sealed bags, the campers didn't seem equipped to hang the food. 
Heard a loon or two over the lake, as well as some early-season fireworks.","Caratunk (mile 151.2)

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640058,"Woke at 5:30 to Pancho breaking down his tent. The Pierce Pond was incredibly still, the water almost glass. The three of us walked over to Harrison's camp for Tim's famous pancake breakfast. Eggs, sausages, and a baker's dozen of raspberry, apples, and blueberry pancakes (patriotic red, white and blue per Tim). The hiker hunger has arrived in force. I polished off the food, OJ, and coffee and could have eaten more. Tim's eyes lit up when I asked him about the tractor for which he'd gone to New Hampshire yesterday. A new Kubota, it's his first tractor despite running this camp for decades, to help with all kinds of jobs. 
Today was a generally level walk from pond to pond on the old Carry Trail that Benedict Arnold's force followed to attack British Quebec in 1775. The trail varied between nice leafy tread and the usual rooty, rocky Maine stuff. Damp rocks and roots were dry by afternoon as the temperature climbed into the 80s and the sun shone much of the day.
Thanks to all the ponds I got four swims in today - a grand slam! East Carry Pond, West Carry Pond, and Flagstaff Lake were all large, clear, lovely swimming areas with easy access by small pebble beaches or boulders. The last dip was in an cascading brook by Little Bigelow Lean-to with granite catches called the Tubs. The water was pretty chilly, but exhilarating on this hot day. A breeze came and went frequently all day, drying me fairly quickly each time. I even got to observe two loons fishing at East Carry Pond.
Leaving the beach at East Carry Pond I found two northbounders snacking on the trail, a young guy and a fiftyish guy, both with prodigious beards.""There's a great beach just ahead,"" I offered. The older one snapped back ""Why are you SOBOs always trying to get us to go swimming?"" Well, it was worth a try. I guess I could have parried ""Because you stink!"" 
But it illustrated two things: northbounders think SOBOs are annoyingly untested, and NOBOs are in too much of a hurry. I find NOBOs take me more seriously if I mention I thruhiked last year (NOBO of course). Lacking that context I'm sure I come off like some overawed greenhorn, rather than someone who's made the same mistakes they are but has had time to reflect on them. The hikers finishing early have almost always been in a hurry. Once they finish, they will probably wonder why they were so eager to return to normal life. 
I met only one hiker today not going a long distance, a guy named Chris who was covered head to toe under a wide-brimmed hat. He's piecing together Maine and out for a couple days. A young guy, but he's recovering from knee surgery so being careful not to overdo it. Other than him I saw two dayhikers climbing Moxie Bald two days ago. Everyone else is hiking at least a hundred miles, even the camp girls.
I leapfrogged with Pappy and Pancho all day, and later with Viewmaster and Just Maine, the two girls who stopped for tea yesterday. They also took advantage of the lake and Tubs. Viewmaster just graduated from nursing school and is thruhiking before she gets a job. Just Maine was born in South Africa and bounced around the US, first as a horticulturalist and now as an EMT near Pittsburgh. She's accompanying Viewmaster for the first few weeks through Maine. 
The humidity tested me a little today. I had visions of cold sodas much of the day. Without the swims it would have been much more difficult. Late in the afternoon I seriously considered hitching to town from Long Falls Dam Road. I prayed for soda trail magic at the road. Not to be. Though I did find some empty water jugs and an empty box of Clif bars behind a rock. 
Pappy, Viewmaster, Just Maine and I ended up at Little Bigelow Lean-to and enjoyed an evening fire and cool breezes as the sun retreated. The water here is delicious.","Pierce Pond Lean-to (mile 155.2)
",Little Bigelow Lean-to (mile 172.9),"Jun 27, Sun",18.20
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640059,"Absolutely perfect sleeping weather last night. Around 70 with cool breezes keeping the humidity at bay. Viewmaster got up in the middle of the night to set up her tent in the woods to escape the mosquitoes, but they didn't bother me much. It started raining around six so she hurriedly picked up the freestanding tent and carried it into the shelter to stay dry. 
I left camp intending to hike to route 27 and get into Stratton. It's only 15 miles. But Pappy, Viewmaster, and Just Maine didn't expect to make it, so I debated with myself if I was moving too fast. I might find another group of hikers ahead. But I'd have to slow down eventually if I didn't want to pass them too. The lure of town was great, though.
It was mostly sunny and very humid. I was sweating buckets climbing up Little Bigelow. From the peak I could see Sugarloaf and its ski runs across the valley, and the angular Bigelow peaks farther up the ridge. 
The trail ran down into Safford Notch, below a cliff called Old Man's Head. The next hour or more was consumed by a mere mile and a half of trail to Avery Peak, but it required climbing 1800 feet over rocks, roots, and boulders. By this time my shirt was on the back of my pack drying off, and I was dripping with sweat and praying for breezes to cool me off. I could hear my heart racing as I steadily climbed the wall. This is hard. Harder than I remember as a NOBO.
I was rewarded with steady breezes above tree line on Avery Peak. The peak is named for Myron Avery, the head of the Appalachian Trail Club in the 1930s who oversaw and personally built much of the AT. He was the first to walk every inch of it during various construction visits. It was his idea to extend the trail into Maine, so I personally owe him my gratitude for blazing access to this wonderful section of the country. Without him the trail would have ended on Mt. Washington in New Hampshire.
Met a ridgerunner in the col between Avery and West peaks from Vermont named Becca, or Bus Driver. She was inspired to do this by meeting a ridgerunner during her 2017 thruhike. Ridgerunners monitor the shelters, remove trash, answer hikers' questions, promote Leave No Trace, and report areas needing trail maintenance. For that the trail club gives them a small salary and stipend that covers maybe four nights a month in a motel to clean up and relax. The rest of the time they live on the mountain. 
Also passed several dayhikers and section hikers. A man named JJ is working on his final section after 14 years of section hiking. He abandoned last year's section after being harrassed by hut croo about camping in the Whites and is bitter about the way he was treated. A younger guy is section hiking from Massachusetts and seemed to be having a great time. A NOBO named Skywalker met me on Bigelow's Horn peak. He started March 23rd, less than 100 days ago. Said he just wanted to get to Katahdin and be done. I sympathized but told him I regretted rushing. We'll see what he does. 
A section hiker named Elsewhere was waiting for his slower buddy at the intersection with a side trail to North Horn Peak. I took the four-tenths mile round trip and was rewarded with a view of the Bigelows' north side I've never seen. Plus since the peak is 3800 feet it's probably on some list. 
By this time I'd reflected a bit and determined the only thing I really wanted from town was a cold soda. Pushing to get to town this afternoon was possible but would mean a night in a hostel, buying dinner, etc - basically a $60 soda. Plus I might miss the hostel dinner run anyway, hitching might not be easy, and I'd be leaving the others behind. 
So I decided to stop at Horns Pond where there's a campsite and shelter. I swam in the pond - a rocky, muddy, shallow one - and relaxed in the sun before retiring to the shelter. 13 days of swimming in a row! Pappy and the girls showed up within another hour. Pappy even cooked me one of his dehydrated meals since I'd eaten nearly all my food last night in the expectation of getting to town. 
Viewmaster asked about the forecast, wondering whether to tent to escape the bugs - the gnats here are bloodthirsty. I miraculously had a bar of service and saw a 30% chance of rain, so she set up her tent in the second lean-to. Twenty minutes later it began to drizzle, and over the next hour it alternately drizzled and poured. Such is weather forecasting in the mountains.
The shelter has two neighbors who visited us before the rain. A red squirrel who seems intent on finding our food, and a large, brown, floppy-eared rabbit. And I thought the mice were bad.","Little Bigelow Lean-to (mile 172.9)
",Horns Pond Lean-to (mile 183.1),"Jun 28, Mon",10.70
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640060,"It poured several times last night, but by morning the sky was blue and I was up at 5:30 with so much energy I was doing crunches and push-ups. Must be the cooler less humid air up here at 3000 feet. I got a lot of sun yesterday hanging out on Avery Peak and by Horns Pond which probably helped me sleep as well. 
Pappy hiked out while the girls Viewmaster and Just Maine were still asleep in the other lean-to. I detoured on the way out to Horns Pond for another dip. The water and air were both warm enough for it to feel refreshing. There are no more swimming opportunities between here and the highway so I had to keep the streak alive. 14 days and counting!
After a little climb to a rocky overlook above Horns Pond, where I watched the mist curl up from the forest, the trail turned down steeply and dropped 2000 feet over the next two miles. Not quite as rocky as yesterday, and eventually it was mostly dirt trail. 
My destination, the Hostel of Maine, would be dropping hikers off at the trailhead at 7:30 and 9:30, a good time to catch a ride back. At this pace I'd be there around 8:30 but no matter. Maybe I'd hitch to the convenience store for second breakfast. A honey bun only goes so far. 
A little after 8 a northbounder passed me. He looked intense and didn't say much so I just assumed he'd been dropped off by the hostel at 7:30. Several minutes later two more northbounders appeared and I asked one how the hostel was. He gushed about it being all renovated, comfortable, huge, and having a steak dinner (that got my attention). But he wasn't talking about the Hostel of Maine. It was a new hostel called the Maine Roadhouse. I got the phone number from him but, having no service, wasn't sure how I'd find them. The hiker, Skeletor, had no idea where it was. 
I reached highway 27, which I'd been hearing for over an hour as large trucks occasionally whizzed past, and crossed over to the pull off with trailhead parking. To my delight I had one bar of service. I was just about to call the Roadhouse when a woman with purple hair who I'd seen wandering around the lot asked if I wanted a cold Gatorade. Wait, let me think, ... Yes! Please! There's nothing I want more in the world at this moment than a cold drink! You're my hero! Okay, I didn't get all that out but my delight was evident. She gave me a Snickers bar too. Her name was Jen, as was the other woman she was with. The Two Jens. And they weren't just doing trail magic, they were, you guessed it, from the Maine Roadhouse. 
Once Pappy appeared we were whisked through Stratton to a farmette several miles west of town where we found a large, extensively remodeled farmhouse with a huge bunkroom over an amazing rec room. Couches, ping pong, a large bar, woodstove, TV, all rustic wood paneling and quirky decor. The sixteen bunks all had real bed mattresses, curtains, personal fans and outlets, and lots of head room. There were private rooms somewhere but the bunk was practically a room. And the huge kitchen was ours to use as well. 
The Two Jens just opened the Roadhouse to hikers yesterday, and we are only the fourth and fifth guests. They were high school friends who got back in touch 30 years later and bought this place from a woman who had once thruhiked and also owns the now-closed Stratton Motel. The Roadhouse was once lodging for lumberjacks, then later a hiker hostel, before becoming a ""grow house"" (pot) and falling into disrepair and grime. The Jens and purple-haired Jen's father-in-law have spent the last year cleaning and fixing it up. Both have grown kids and had corporate jobs and suburban lives, but are now pursuing their dream on their own terms. They have plans for a backyard retreat with chickens and farm-to-table vegetables, fruit, and herbs. They just want to delight hikers, skiers, and canoers exploring the area's backcountry with home-baked treats and other personal touches.
Pappy and I had the run of the place, hung out and played cornhole, were driven to town to resupply, and brought back veggies and steak to grill (for me, Pappy is a vegetarian). And an inexpensive Bourdeaux to celebrate 200 miles. 
I haven't said much about Pappy. He's a Merrill Lynch financial advisor from Chicago, originally Wilmington, North Carolina, ex-Marine, married with two daughters in their twenties, taking a sabbatical from work to ""scratch an itch"". I met him at the AT Lodge in Millinocket the night I flew in. He'd hurt his knee on his fourth day and come back to rest for a few days. It was a major disappointment after planning this hike for so long, but he rested, got a knee brace, and got back on trail. He takes the uphills nice and slow to go easy on the knee, but he can pump out the miles in the flatter areas. Already he's left many younger hikers behind, even as he prudently curtails his miles. 
We shared the wine with our hosts and gave them what advice we could to help them better understand hikers and be successful. With their commitment and the work they've already done I have no doubt the word will spread and this will become a must stop on the trail. I'll certainly be telling everyone about them.","Horns Pond Lean-to (mile 183.1)

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640153,"The Two Jens cooked us a big breakfast at the Maine Roadhouse and we headed back to trail. Hope the Roadhouse becomes a success. They've done an amazing job and seem intent on doing whatever they can to make it an ideal hiker haven. 
Dave of Dad's Shuttles was sitting at the trailhead as he often does, waiting for hikers who need a ride to town for a small fee. He  offered us some huge muffins a hiker had left with him, but I was too full and said the hikers coming in would enjoy them more. There's some tension between him and the hostel because the Jens are driving hikers in for free. But ultimately they should be helping each other out with referrals and slackpacking. 
A NOBO named Tall Son passed heading to town and then straight back on trail. Rather than a Nero (near zero) this is known as a Hero, because of the resolve it takes to leave town so quickly.
A sectioner named Chris from Augusta, Maine was slowly plodding up the first hill to North Crocker. He could only finagle a few days off before he has to be back for Army National Guard duties for Independence Day. He's been working on completing the AT in Maine. His buddy was waiting at the summit when I arrived. He's an hour ahead of Chris on thisfive mile stretch. It's the first time they've hiked together so they don't know each other's paces yet. 
Viewmaster and Just Maine were taking in the view on top of South Crocker. They had successfully left Stratton yesterday after doing their own Hero and tented near the road. The climb up the Crockers was not bad. Mostly dirt trail. I cracked open the Coke I'd lugged up from town.
I've decided to tag all the 4000 footers in Maine on this hike, since I've hit any that were on the way so far. Whether for the challenge, or to equalize things with the other SOBOs I'm trying not to outpace, or just for the fun of it I don't know. I had tagged all eight 4Ks in this section from Stratton to Rangeley on my thruhike last year so I knew exactly what I was getting into. First, from South Crocker, I followed a herd path to Mount Redington. Two and a half bonus miles. The path is not an official trail but is marked by ribbons and was not nearly as bad as the bushwhack path to Fort Mountain in Baxter. As I flew down the path I felt like a little kid, and the Appalachians were a giant playground. I went out and back in a little over an hour without my pack, and lost almost no blood!
Got back on trail and started going downhill as expected. After a few minutes, though, the trail turned uphill. Odd, I thought it was downhill all the way to the river? It kept going up. I got a sinking feeling. I checked the GPS and sure enough I was headed north and was climbing North Crocker again. Augh! I laughed at myself. I was still in a great mood and this was more humorous than annoying. Only a half mile in the wrong direction, easily corrected. I turned around and climbed South Crocker - again! - and continued on steeply down to the Carabassett River.
As I hit a rock slide, it began to shower. It ended after a few minutes but it made for slow going over wet rocks. 
The two section hikers stopped here for the day, before the steep climb up to Sugarloaf. ""We're on vacation!"" Chris called out and laughed.
I rockhopped downstream a ways until I found boulders large enough to skinnydip behind. 15 days of swimming in a row! This was the only spot available today. Fortunately the sun came out and the water felt refreshing. 
Sugarloaf was a difficult climb. At one point the grade was gaining 2400 ft per mile. One jumble of rocks to climb after another. I put my poles away and just pulled myself up with my hands. I had grabbed extra water from the river and could feel the weight.
Viewmaster and Just Maine were snacking near the top. Said Pappy had practically run downhill past them. ""No wonder he hurt his knee before!"" one said. I stopped for a quick lunch with them. They had tea time again today but I missed it. 
Up on the shoulder of Sugarloaf I found Alex and Pre-pack. It's been five days since Pappy and I left them to go to Caratunk. Alex is now Beach Day after his gaudy shorts and huge camp towel. Their tents were already set up. That last climb had been enough for Alex to call it a day. 
I dropped my pack and took the mile roundtrip side trail to the top of Sugarloaf. There are radio towers, a chairlift, a helicopter pad, and a large decrepit octagonal structure that may have been an old lodge. The wind picked up but wasn't as strong as the last time I was here. Waves of mist blew over the nearby mountaintops.
I followed the AT for several miles to Spaulding Mountain but was getting tired. Thunder was rumbling in the distance. At the short side trail to the summit I found the girls' packs and passed them coming down. ""I'm turning you into peakbaggers!"" I cried. ""There's no view up there!"" Just Maine laughed. ""I know, I know. I'm going to tag it anyway!"" I replied.
It started drizzling again when we got down. The thunder was closeing in. The rain soon picked up and became a downpour for several minutes. I struggled to pull on my poncho for the second time today. I was already soaked.
Then began the longest mile of the hike to date. Everything was soaked and very slick. The dirt between the slippery rocks and roots was flooded so there were no good places to step. The trail was a mess. I slipped on some mud and jammed my knee into the pointy roots of a downed tree laying in the trail. Ouch! It started bleeding. I began cursing the weather, the trail maintainers, my luck, everything. I was in a mood. On top of the world this morning, ready to throttle somebody this evening. The AT is an emotional rollercoaster.
Finally I reached Spaulding shelter and found Pappy and three northbounders. I was a miserable wet dog. I squeezed in, stiffening whenever the wind hit me in my wet clothes. When the two girls arrived we made more room. A full house tonight.","Stratton Rt 27 (mile 188.2)

Pappy left soon after. I dreaded putting on my wet clothes and lingered as long as I could over my sticky bun breakfast. Viewmaster and Just Maine dawdled as well. As I packed up I found a rock in my water bottle side pocket. Viewmaster had snuck it in there when I left my pack to tag Sugarloaf's peak. I laughed. It was the first time I'd ever been rocked in all this time on trail. All in good fun. 
After a mile I dropped my pack - knowing full well the risk I was taking of gaining more weight - and took a turn off to Mt. Abraham, another 4000 footer. Almost two miles one way, the last half mile of trail was over a talus field. Beautiful views of the mist circling over the nearby peaks. I took the wrong trail off the peak and had to circle the peak over extensive talus to get back to the right trail. Lost a little blood on that bit. 
I leapfrogged for several miles with section hiker Chris and his buddy, as well as Viewmaster and Just Maine, and Beach Day and Prepack. At Sluice Brook above Orbeton Stream I took a (very shallow) dip in one of the pools to keep the swim streak alive, then Viewmaster invited me to tea time. Hot Earl Grey poured into my water bottle. What a nice treat!
At Orbeton Stream there was metal rowboat crushed like an aluminum can against a huge boulder. Must have been a flash flood at some point. 
After a tough climb up to Poplar Ridge, along which I met a northbound LASHer and history buff named Old Army 1775 who was delighted by my name, I hung out on a sunny boulder for awhile. My socks still haven't dried from last night's downpour. Meanwhile I called around to every lodging in Rangeley but everything was booked due to the holiday weekend. Even the Hiker Hut wasn't sure if they'd have room. 
I walked down to the nearby shelter to find Beach Day and Prepack ensconced for the night. It was a little after 4. I decided I'd gone far enough as well, since the alternative was an eight mile dash across the Saddleback range to the next shelter, or tenting somewhere in between with rain in the forecast. Either way I'll be in Rangeley tomorrow. Pappy left a note saying he had pushed on over the Saddlebacks. He's quickly becoming a hiking machine! Viewmaster and Just Maine stopped to chat but headed on a couple miles to tent.
There is a ""gushing brook"" here that is barely moving right now despite the recent rains. The waterfall at Orbeton stream was at low volume, though it was still entrancing. Maine has a ways to go to recover from the recent dry spell.","Spaulding Mountain Lean-to (mile 201.7)

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640392,"Woke to rain that had fallen through most of the night. It tapered off as I lingered in the shelter, eating my last honey bun, and I headed out around 7:15.
Leapfrogged the whole day with Prepack, Beach Day, Viewmaster, Just Maine, and the two section hikers. Pappi had cleared the mountains and gone to the Maine Roadhouse yesterday evening, surprising everyone including himself.
Today's highlight, the three Saddleback peaks and the three miles of open alpine ridge between, were in the clouds. No sweeping vistas from Katahdin to Mt. Washington today. At 4000 feet it was in the high 40s, wet, and generally windy, though Saddleback peak itself was oddly calm. My hands were cold and I lost dexterity. Of course I didn't pack any gloves. But this was nothing compared to my traverse in a tropical storm four years ago August, where the pouring rain and whipping wind sent me into hypothermic shock to the point I couldn't even think clearly. 
Lots of northbounders were coming up from the road to Rangeley. A sixty-something guy from Quebec City named Not Yet, a seventy-something flip-flopper named Forager who planned to get some more cortisone injections to control his knee pain before flipping back to Harper's Ferry, and a few more NOBOs who weren't as chatty.
But most impressive was the Trout family - Mom, Dad, and five children that looked to be between 10 and 17 - who had started in Georgia and are still trucking north. They all had the same green emergency ponchos covering themselves and their packs. They briefly stopped to exchange words but marched on swiftly to keep up their body heat. 
Once below treeline, after an interminable stretch in the alpine during which I grew increasingly colder, the trail descended precipitously. It dropped off large boulders gnarled with roots, and slid down bedrock slabs at steep angles. All of it soaked and slick, of course. The outside temperature rose slightly and the physical effort raised my body temperature. 
By the time I reached Eddy Pond I felt I was warm enough to take a dip and keep the streak alive at 17 days. The pond was covered in thick mist. I hesitated before plunging in, but the water was warmer than the air and felt good. The bottom was soft and muddy though, and the water shallow, so I soon got out. The air was chilly but not as much as I expected. 
Back on trail I cruised the last three or four miles to the road, stopping to wish Chris the section hiker and his buddy well as they drove home to Augusta. They lamented the lack of views on this trip. It hadn't occurred to me, but yes, to them it has all been green tunnel or fog. The Crockers were largely forested. I had climbed peaks on side trails like Sugarloaf and Abraham which had outstanding views, and of course had been hiking for two weeks before this stretch and taken in plenty of panoramas. White-outs on a few peaks are to be expected and only a minor disappointment to a long-distance hiker. But if you have only a few days and it takes you the whole day to climb a couple of peaks, then you are gambling the trip on the short-term weather. They live close enough however that they could dayhike the Saddlebacks if they really wanted to take in the view. I met a dayhiker going to Saddleback's Horn who had climbed what he said was an easy 1.7 miles from the base lodge of Saddleback ski resort. 
An older dayhiker couple was ambling through the pleasant fir forest a mile from the road. Compared to the summit, it was drier and warmer down here and the moisture in the air felt invigorating rather than oppressive. I commented on the nice weather and they looked at me like I was crazy. I asked the man how he was doing and all he said was he felt ""moist"". I guess it's all relative.
At the Sandy River crossing the trail bridges a narrow cataract created by walls of neatly cut and stacked boulders on each side. I wonder if a water mill stood here once. 
The Hiker Hut was a quarter mile up route 4 and was quiet after a very busy evening yesterday. The first person I saw was Rooster, a guy I met twice last year: first in Virginia, then in New Hampshire after he flipped to Katahdin and went south. This year he's hiked a thousand miles from Harper's Ferry and is headed to Katahdin. This is not the first time I've met someone on trail I knew from an earlier year.
Beach Day and Prepack beat me in, and Viewmaster and Just Maine followed later, along with a northbound girl named Sunrise that Rooster knows. Joseph, whom I last saw crossing the Kennebec, was also here finishing up a zero day. There are several small cabins with bunks. Everything is off the grid, so no electric service, no indoor plumbing and no heat. There's a porta-potty, and an outdoor shower with gas-powered hot water. Steve, our host, made us egg sandwiches in the tiny kitchenette cabin. An open fire was the only heat, and only place to dry wet clothes. 
Steve usually shuttles hikers into town. But because of the staggered arrival times he handed me the keys to his minivan and I drove the guys into Rangeley. The girls had to hitch once they'd showered because Steve's partner Vera didn't show up with the other vehicle in time. But everyone got their laundry done at the laundromat, and Beach Day, Prepack and I hung out at Sarge's pub for three hours charging devices and nursing beers between plates of food. On the way back we stopped at the IGA to resupply, rushing up and down the aisles since they closed in ten minutes. It was only 8 pm. 
Dark but cozy here in the bunk cabin with five people. An upgrade from a damp shelter for sure. It has continued to drizzle throughout the day and into the night. Tomorrow is a zero day with fireworks in town. Hopefully the weather improves.","Poplar Ridge Lean-to (mile 209.7)

Bring her your favorite photograph and she will reproduce it. For those with AT passports she draws a unique design rather than applying a rubber stamp. Steve has other items for sale. A silver AT necklace. And hand-tooled leather-bound journals made in India by Steve's friend that benefit kids there. I bought one with a Tree of Life design and had it sent home. 
It drizzled on and off this morning while we had our egg sandwich breakfasts. An elderly couple stayed in the private cabin by the stream last night. They are English but have lived in San Antonio for 45 years. They've been sectioning the AT and this could be their last section. The woman wondered aloud how anyone could enjoy the hiking in Maine. That was a bit surprising considering she'd done most of the trail. But Maine can be an acquired taste. Especially in the rain. 
Lucky Charms hiked in mid-morning. He's been only a few miles behind me for some days, but I haven't seen him since Monson. Calls himself Falcon Punch now, after being attacked by a goshawk near the Kennebec River. That's his fifth or sixth trail name. He's a nurse from south Florida. Going through a divorce, sold his house, and ready - perhaps - to see the world through different eyes, away from the stress and cynicism of urban life.
Several of us were shuttled into Rangeley by Hiker Hut neighbor Bill. First stop: the outfitter Ecopelagicon, where I was able to exchange my worn Darn Tough socks for new. Darn Tough provides a lifetime warranty. So much thicker and softer than my old pair. It will be like walking on air! For a few miles at least.
We walked to the other side of town, almost a mile, to get coffee and hang out at Moose Alley. I bowled and played pool with Beach Day and Prepack. Viewmaster, Just Maine and Falcon Punch got picked up by the Maine Roadhouse for the night. They all wanted a dry indoor retreat with power and heat. The day is damp, cool, and raw. They took my pack with them. I'd decided to hang out in town all day. 
Watched the England vs. Ukraine football match. Beach Day is a big fan of the English Premier League, particularly Leicester United, so I rooted for Ukraine. They got blanked 4-0, so I bought the next round.
My swimming streak was challenged today. Rangeley is bustling with visitors on this Independence Day weekend. All the inns, B&B's, cabins, condos, and motels are full. While the town sits between Rangeley Lake and Haley Pond, there are no discrete but publicly-accessible spots to jump in. The public park that juts into the lake is hosting an art show. Most of the waterfront is private homes and businesses. I found a church with excellent lake access, but even on a Saturday afternoon a car stood in the lot with a church lady at the wheel. After walking up and down the main road I finally found a spot: a small boat launch behind the lumberyard, which closed early today. The lake here was very shallow but served its purpose. Even on a cool day the dip felt refreshing. But I did zip up my jacket as I walked back to the pub. 
Found Jacob at Sarge's pub. Jacob is the kid who took a few days off in Monson to sit for the state police exam. Now calls himself Bait because he's been harassed by a hawk, grouse, and a red squirrel. Just now he left his pack in the shuttle car and was hoping Bill would notice it soon. Later he nearly got shut out of the laundromat where his clothes were drying. He ripped his pants and shattered his phone screen on a guardrail walking to the Hiker Hut, and his sleeping pad has a leak. But he's got a wry smile every time he speaks, and seems to be loving the adventure.
Moose Juice, Green Bag, and Kevin, now Spud, came into town from the Roadhouse with Falcon and the girls. We all ate at Sarge's, which was extremely busy and took forever. Plus we sat out on the upper deck and shivered from the cold wind. We paid up just as the fireworks display started and hustled over to the lakefront to catch the spectacular display that went on for over 20 minutes above the lake. The Roadhouse picked us all up after.
My last visit here was just three nights ago.  There was just one other guest, Pappy. But yesterday and tonight they're hosting around 20 guests. So they've quickly had to scale up the operation. Shuttling people to trails and towns, making breakfast for a big crowd, accommodating all the wet gear hikers want to dry out. The Trout family of 7 is here and is slackpacking tomorrow. Jenn has partnered with Dave of Dad's Shuttles to offer slackpacks over the Bigelows and the Crockers. Quite the rapid turnaround from the bad blood of just a few days ago. 
Viewmaster saved me a bunk where my pack was waiting. It happened to be the same one I had before. Jenn says she's going to put my name on it in honor of being one of their first guests. And for driving so much business their way. Never in my wildest dreams did I think so many hikers would find them so quickly off word of mouth and one Guthook comment. I'm very happy for them.","Rangeley Rt 4 (mile 220.4)

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640400,"After a big breakfast at the Roadhouse Jenn drove five of us to the Rangeley trailhead, over 30 minutes away. There are no major mountains in this stretch, and the MATC sign calls it ""relatively gentle"", but the climb from the road was still a steep one. 
Bait and I started off together. Just 20 and a high school middle-distance track runner from the northern Boston suburbs, he sports several bracelets on his wrists. They are from 5Ks he's run in honor of his older sister Ashley. She was killed in a car crash four years ago. It didn't take him long to outpace me. Not many people do, but I was happy to fall back and take a more relaxed pace.
I walked through or under a cloud most of the day. The trees dripped steadily, cooly splashing on my pack, head, and clothes.
I leapfrogged with Bait, Falcon Punch, and Prepack, who started from the Hiker Hut, for most of the day. We stopped to canoe on South Pond. Someone, somehow, dragged canoes and rowboats miles into the backwoods to ponds along the trail. If there's road access, it's not on any of my maps. 
To underline the point, we found fisherman out in a canoe on Little Swift River Pond, 5 miles from the road. The other canoes on land were in bad shape, one patched with flexitape, one with holes bigger than the remainder of the hull. 
Both ponds were too muddy to swim in. So after lunch at Sabbath Day Pond Lean-to, I found a narrow beach on nearby Long Pond. The bottom was sandy and stretched maybe 100 yards out. I had to walk well out before it even reached my thighs. Best swimming since before the Bigelows.
By the time I reached route 17 a real rain shower was coming in. It obscured the normally spectacular view from Height of Land. Bait and Prepack were already shuffling off.
We dropped steeply down from the road over 700 feet to a wide stream, the last good water for many miles. Just past, at a dirt road and before the big climb out, sat a cooler. Trail magic! Home-baked cookies, sodas, and PB&J. I'd brought a drink from town so I sampled the cookies and left the rest for the next hiker. 
The climb to the first Bemis peak was 1800 feet. I've entered the realm where massive climbs and descents become routine, even expected. Even the low peaks require dramatic elevation gains. Fortunately the rain moved on and the view back north began clearing up. I emerged into an alpine landscape of bedrock, stubby firs, and distinctive groundcover. They give the appearance of an informal garden of beds between bedrock paths. The sun struggled to come out and highlight the rich greens, yellows, reds, and grays around me. 
The last mile to the shelter was a long one through a jumble of roots, rocks, puddles, and dense firs brushing me with their watery fingers. I think I prefer climbing straight up to  fighting through the boggy mess of a ""level"" section. 
At the shelter were Beach Day, Bait, northbounders Rain Shower and Viking Man, and a middle-aged brother and sister from Maine sectioning the state. Prepack and Joseph were tenting nearby and Falcon Punch hung his hammock and set out his (ultralight) camp chair. 
The water source is an orange puddle, disappointing many hikers. Joseph came by. His filter was malfunctioning and didn't seem up to the task. I gave him the extra liter I'd packed out from the stream miles back. I'm not cooking, and I drink little. Especially on a damp day like this. 
Bait started a fire despite the wet conditions. He'd brought up hot dogs to cook and shared with everyone. He has a lot of equipment problems. In addition to his busted phone and ripped pants, his sleeping pad leaks, he lost his toiletry kit at the Roadhouse, he almost left his water filter at the last shelter, and the can of fuel he nabbed from the hiker box ran out of fuel while he was cooking Mac 'n cheese. He finished cooking in the fire.
Beach Day used the fire to dry some gear. He held his undies over the fire with a stick. Prepack pushed his wet boots over the gaps in the rocks where heat escaped the fire ring. Waterproof boots still get wet.
Viking Man must be in his seventies. He hurt his leg a couple of miles before the shelter and limped in. His first injury in 1900 miles, as he bitterly repeated to one person after another. Hopefully he feels better tomorrow.
Viewmaster and Just Maine camped at the bottom of the Bemis climb. Just Maine is leaving tomorrow to go back to her EMS job in Pittsburgh. Viewmaster will continue on to Georgia on her own. 
I passed numerous northbounders today but exchanged few words with any of them. One I stepped aside for and greeted didn't even glance at me. He had earbuds in and walked by like I didn't exist. I understand why SOBOs and some hostel owners think a lot of northbounders at this point are arrogant or entitled. Single-mindedness is not a virtue in most cases. Having been there I understand the drive, but I always tried to be polite and friendly. Some, it seems, need a reminder that we all share the trail. And that is what makes it special.","Rangeley Rt 4 (mile 220.4)

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640468,"It was cold last night, around 40 degrees. One of only two nights so far I've regretted not having brought long underwear or my warmer quilt. Still, I slept well enough. I did some crunches and push-ups to warm up before eating breakfast.
The hike down to South Arm Rd was less than 9 miles but was very rough. I climbed Bemis and Old Blue mountains up wet granite slabs and over tumbled rocks and boulders. The descents were much worse, and even the flattish stretches had no dirt to stand on, just constant twists and turns hopping from wet rock to slippery root. The slick bog bridges were the worst. Several times I nearly ate it as my foot slid out from underneath me. All this for no view on forested Bemis and limited views from Old Blue. 
Bait and I scrambled down Old Blue for the last 3 miles. It was a hellish descent at times. Wet slabs of steeply angled bedrock with no good footholds and only wet roots to arrest any slide. I fell on my butt once and it's a wonder it didn't happen more. Rebar rungs and railings were affixed to several of the steepest slopes. I was gleeful to finally reach the road after some five hours of painfully slow progress. 
Falcon Punch, Bait, Joseph and I were all shuttled to The Cabin in Andover by Don, son of Honey the family matriarch. Honey will be 89 in a few days and will spend her birthday hiking Gulf Hagas in the Hundred Mile Wilderness. 
Rusty and Swan are still here from last year, living in a giant tent in the yard and helping run the hostel. They both thruhiked in 2019. Hopper, who's hiked the trail multiple times, arrived today from her home in Virginia to help out for yet another season.
A northbound woman and mother of two young kids from South Carolina named Pink Croc came in. She's been hiking between bubbles so happy to see some people. There's also an older northbounder named Cheap Chardonnay who's climbed Kilimanjaro among other things in his long interesting life.
I sunned myself in the yard and dried out my gear, and later walked a half mile down the road to a creek to get in my daily swim. I only had twelve inches to work with and had to scramble down a steep bank under a bridge, but the streak is now up to 20 days. On the way back I passed the nineteenth-century schoolhouse and fire company garage for East Andover. 
Don cooked up fresh-ground burgers and Honey served corn on the cob and homemade potato salad, followed by ice cream and homemade brownies. We all swore we'd never eat again, but Honey encouraged us to take ice cream for later and she was right. Packed out a burger and brownies for tomorrow's slackpack in case I run into other hikers.","Bemis Mountain Lean-to (mile 238.1)

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640470,"Swan cooked up a large breakfast of pancakes, eggs, and sausage to send us on our way. Alias (formerly Falcon Punch and many other names), Joseph and I went off the slackpack ten miles around Andover.
I packed out pancakes, brownies, and a hamburger in case I ran across Prepack and Beach Day. 
It was cloudy and threatened rain all day but never came through. But the humidity was impossible to escape. 
Despite cresting only two mountains, Moody and Wyman - both under 3000 feet - this dayhike kicked my butt. The climbs were all steep, the descents were steeper, and I don't remember any level stretches. The humidity didn't help. I calculated we climbed 2100 feet from Sawyer Brook to reach Wyman's peak, elevation 2900. The climb into the Presidential Range is less. But it was great exercise for the quads, and the trail was less technical than the Bemis range. 
We never did find Beach Day and Prepack.In fact we only passed a handful of hikers. An old section hiker by Sawyer Brook out for a couple months, taking his time to Katahdin. A lean guy named Jonathan at Hall Mountain Lean-to who's been section hiking for 17 years, belying his youthful appearance. A tall dark-bearded northbounder named Buck being slacked by his visiting parents. It was already 1 pm when we crossed paths with him but he was entertaining the idea of doing the ten miles we'd just done plus 13 more. I can't imagine. My feet already hurt. 
I passed several clusters of tents belonging to two trail crews. The first was quarrying and placing rock steps. The second was crushing rock with hammers to make travel for bog bridges. Both crews climbed up the mountain each day with 50 pound packs of equipment to perform their unpaid work.
I jumped in Surplus Pond along the way to the road. A bit chilly compared to other ponds but still refreshing. Swim count is up to 21 days in a row.
Don was waiting at the road to whisk us back to Andover for lunch and on to the Cabin. I had the lobster roll at Mills Market. I'm almost out of Maine and hadn't tried one yet. Viewmaster and Just Maine were there with Maine's sister from Massachusetts. Viewmaster is continuing on trail tonight but Just Maine is headed back to the EMS near Pittsburgh. Sounded like she had mixed emotions.
New hikers at the Cabin: northbounders Halo, Pippin, Dirty Mike, Squid, and No Shame. They made no bones about wanting to be done and being tired of the trail. They hung out all afternoon watching movies and moving as little as possible.
Big dinner of ham, corn, pineapple sauce, sweet potatoes, and salad (green food? What's that?) The massive dining table was milled from pines on the property and assembled and lacquered by thruhikers over 20 years ago. Since then the underside has been signed by countless hikers, including the first thruhiker Earl Schaffer in his final years.
Tomorrow it's back on trail to get to Grafton Notch and the town of Bethel. A hurricane or tropical storm is headed up the coast and likely to dump rain here on Thursday or Friday so trying to plan around that. The toughest stretch of the AT lies just beyond Grafton Notch.","South Arm Rd (mile 246.8)
",East B Hill Rd (mile 256.9),"Jul 06, Tue",10.30
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640519,"There is something special about the Cabin in Andover. As a hostel it's pretty basic: the bunks are simple and mattresses worn, the carpets dirty, the bathroom and common area are showing their age and rather tight for the 15-20 hikers they often host. No one comes here for these, anymore than one goes to the famous Kincora hostel for the outdoor toilet stalls or attic bunks. Certainly one attraction are the wonderful and copious dinners and breakfasts served every day, family style. But our hostess, Honey, aka Margery Towne, is the primary attraction. Like Kincora's Bob Peeples, she is a trail icon. Aside from bringing hikers into her home for over 20 years she is a lifelong hiker, trail maintainer, and supporter of numerous causes in the trail community like Wounded Warrior hikes. She has decades worth of stories, and sage advice for both greenhorn SOBOs and world-weary NOBOs. At 89 she is going strong. The trail would be poorer without her. 
Breakfast was big and early, just the way hikers like it. I sent out some postcards that Rusty, Honey's helper, made herself off of one of her paintings of an AT scene. We divided into groups to shuttle back to the trail. Alias, Joseph, and I going back to East B Hill Rd where yesterday's slackpack ended. Bait went to South Arm Rd to hike both yesterday and today's hikes in one long day, a total of 20 miles. NOBOs Squid and Pippin joined us in the car to go further south to Grafton Notch, planning to hike the same 20 in the other direction. 
Today's ten miles wound slowly up Surplus Mountain, then over the three peaks of Baldpate Mountain. But the first stop was Dunn Falls, a bit off trail but a beautiful set of cascades falling into rocky pools. I got my swim in early, dipping into the cold waters and showering under one of the cascades. To my surprise I did not feel particularly cold coming out despite the moist cool air. 
I walked the whole day with Joseph, who has no trail name. From Lawrence, Massachusetts, he was born to a teenage mother whose father drifted away early on, but he was lucky enough to attend a good town school in New Hampshire. He's a personal trainer who's studied nutrition and health extensively and practices a strict regimen, fasting in the mornings, sticking to a keto diet, using natural supplements, turning in early and, when he's not hiking, training for 4 hours a day. We have a compatible pace, so we sauntered the ten miles talking the whole time. Joseph has a prickly personality when you first meet him, and he readily admits as an only child that he prefers bring alone, but get to know him and he's friendly, fascinating, and engaging. 
He's also extremely independent and drives himself. His competitive streak came out early in his hike and he found himself tempted to speed past everyone. But last week he had an epiphany. He doesn't need to rush, he doesn't need to meet any expectations. He can stop or slow down whenever and wherever he wants. He can't control most of what happens out here, but he can control his own choices. So he's been enjoying the company of other hikers and hiking shorter days. He hiked the first 700 moles of the AT last year, including through the height of Covid hysteria, and by his own account he was miserable much of the time, mostly because he pushed himself to finish without trying to enjoy the journey. He's still intent on finishing the entire trail this year, but ready to bend with the winds when they blow. 
The trail was steep but not as rocky as yesterday. Everything was wet, and the foliage leaned into the trail to wipe their water off on us, but we made good time with few stumbles or cursing. 
Near the Frye Notch Lean-to we passed several section hikers and met more in the shelter. Two older women were stopping for the day at 11 am because they lacked the energy after climbing over Baldpate. An elderly couple and their energetic daughter were resting, preparing to continue through Maine. They've hiked the whole AT south of here since attempting a thruhike in 2017. The woman has since replaced her knee.
Our climb up Baldpate was laborious but exciting. The open bedrock slanted at close to 40 degrees. A girl coming down fell as I greeted her. A couple others coming down looked similarly trepidacious. Much of the rock here was wet, even exposed to wind and occasional sun. 
We had long views from the alpine summit, views that probably included Mount Washington. Numerous NOBOs and a few dayhikers and section hikers passed us. The thruhikers said little or nothing except for a girl named Dance Party. The dayhikers, two of which were former thruhikers now living in Iowa, were much chattier. 
The descent on the open rock face was not as difficult as I feared. The sun had dried this face very well. Bedrock slides continued below treeline but not as steeply. We continued to talk and barely noticed the descent. We must have passed a dozen NOBOs in this stretch. 
At the road we crossed route 26 into the Grafton Notch parking lot where we found a SOBO named Chester. He was serious-looking, bearded, and heavy-set. I never got much out of him. Kevin, the owner of the Bethel Village Motel, was already here to shuttle us out. 
Kevin is another Boston-area native and enjoyed bantering with Joseph. He and Ruthie run a very tidy motel in the center of Bethel, a good-sized town by Maine standards with numerous restaurants and services. They are used to having hikers, and did our laundry while we went off to get calories. 
The Butcher Burger is the place to be. Not only was it the only place serving beer open on a Wednesday, but the burgers are the best I've ever had. Seriously. The beef is ground up with bacon. I ate a concoction called the Bacon Bacon, which in addition to bacon strips has bacon jam. Later for dinner I had fried lobster mac 'n cheese. I'm expecting a heart attack on Old Speck tomorrow.
Beach Day, Prepack, and Alias showed up, all staying at a motel several miles outside town. Bait came in, only an hour behind us despite doing 20 miles. We seem to have become a tramily. It was nice. 
Visited the outfitter, Walgreens and food market for minor resupply and microwavable breakfast sandwiches. Expecting to head out early tomorrow. A lot of rain is forecast over the next two days. Five of us are heading out anyway. Joseph decided to take it easy and double zero to wait out the weather. Viewmaster, I learned, had gotten stuck in the rain last night trying to cross Baldpate and had to cowboy camp in a small saddle. She is already south of Grafton Notch, possibly through Mahoosuc Notch, the most difficult mile on the AT. We'll be doing that in the rain.","East B Hill Rd (mile 256.9)
",Grafton Notch (mile 267.2),"Jul 07, Wed",13.10
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640587,"Ruthie at Bethel Village Motel runs an extremely clean and pleasant place. The rug was like a massage for my feet. Why motels are putting in tile floor more and more I don't understand. Ruthie, I later learned, is a native of the Bethel area who lost her husband almost forty years ago. She inherited and had to learn the business from scratch, while raising their three-year-old. On the ground floor she runs a boutique store as well. 
Kevin drove Bait and I back to Grafton Notch. Joseph opted to double zero to wait out the rain. Kevin moved up here from Boston decades ago but says he will always be treated like an outsider by the locals. Although Bethel has since seen many more Massachusetts folks migrate in. Bethel has apparently long been a site for diversity trainings run by an outside advocacy group and a radical bubble has developed around it. In any case Kevin worked in concrete most of his life, introducing new mixes and techniques to the area. That and his rough accent bely his wide reading. In our short conversation he alluded to Plato's allegory of the cave and summarized William Faulkner's Reevers. 
A hiker coming in to Grafton Notch said Beach Day, Prepack, and Alias had started up a few minutes earlier, having been dropped off by the West Bethel Motel. I climbed the Eyebrow Trail alternate to connect to the AT further up since I've already done the AT stretch. The two are the same length, but the Eyebrow is extremely steep for part of it and provides some views across the notch to Baldpate. Once back on the AT the climbing continued. Almost 3000 feet vertical by the time I reached the firetower on Old Speck. The last 4000 footer in Maine! Now I've collected them all, most of them 2 or 3 times. Time to finish up the New Hampshire 48.
Speck has the only extant firetower on the AT in Maine. There are no stairs. Just a vertical ladder. It's a metaphor for the Maine AT: why build switchbacks when you can climb straight up? But the sketchy ladder climb was worth it. 360 degree views of mountains in all directions. The weather so far has been cooperative. No rain, just overcast. The Carter range was on the horizon to the southeast. Only the Presidential range beyond was in the clouds 
Rough descent down to Speck Pond. I searched for a discrete place to skinnydip but ended up jumping in right off the trail where it crossed a beaver dam. Fortunately it was a quiet ten minutes. Beach Day and the others meanwhile went to the Speck campsite and talked to the caretaker, who told them the beavers tended to harass anyone swimming in the pond. So I guess I lucked out. Anyway, the swim streak is up to 23 days straight.
The climb down Mahoosuc Arm was miserable. Steeply slanted bedrock and rocks everywhere. I still had my trekking poles out when I was trying to maneuver between some boulders and lost my grip, sliding down until my knee banged into a pointed rock. Man that hurt! Lost a little blood on that one, as well as my temper. Put the poles away after that.
It's not a simple matter to compare the difficulty of northbound and southbound hikes of this section, or any other. My memory of northbound hiking is colored by the weather, which was cool and dry and ideal for hiking, and the fact that I'd already walked 1900 miles and was in peak hiking condition. But after trying to adjust for this I feel southbound is the harder direction here. Old Speck is a very steep climb with more altitude gain than almost anything in the north outside Katahdin itself. Mahoosuc Arm is not as much vertical change, but is even steeper, and more challenging to descend. 
Then there's Mahoosuc Notch, the toughest mile on the AT. Near the beginning I met a NOBO who'd just come through, casually checking her phone, who assured me ""It's not bad."" I checked the time - 11:55 - secured my phone to a strap, and plunged into the rocks. But not long after, when trying to take a picture, I found the phone was restarting for some unknown reason. It inexplicably reset the date and time back to April 27th. That threw my mental game off, and I had to refocus on the task at hand.
The threatened rain thankfully held off as I scrambled and contorted from boulder to boulder, trying to keep 2 or 3 points of contact at all times. I did not want any accidents here. My first time through several years ago I had leapt from rock to rock, taking the high route. But with damp rocks in places, the traction wearing off my shoes, and my recent brushes with injury, I took a less aggressive approach and slowly wound my way. Using hands and feet I stepped, pulled, pushed, balanced, rotated, leaned, embraced, and squeezed around, over, through, and under the rocks. White blazes were only suggestively placed. It was choose your own adventure. Two or three times I squeezed and crawled on my belly through narrow gaps under boulders the size of cars, managing to keep my pack on. Once I nearly face-planted on the rocks when my right foot wedged between two roots. I caught myself with my hands as I fell headlong, my face hovering inches above the rocks.
An older dayhiker couple was returning through the notch to their car, doing the entire thing a second time today. Several NOBOs passed by, though each time we had to dance a bit to get around one another. Near the south end of the notch I heard many voices. The first thing I thought was, is this trail magic? I guess I was pretty hungry by now.  But it turned out to be an Outward Bound group of 13 young people resting all over the boulders. One girl told me it was only the third day she'd ever hiked, and she seemed very freaked out about tackling this stretch. But the leaders, two girls, were very upbeat and chatty and seemed to have the situation well in hand. 
I remember the stretch south of the notch as being easy, but this is not the case. Not even close. Fulling Mountain lies in the 1.5 miles to the Full Goose shelter. And it felt every bit as steep as Old Speck. I even tripped on the bog bridges on the flat summit. I was exhausted.
I arrived at Full Goose shelter to find Bait and a couple of older NOBO ladies. Not sure if I would continue, I stopped to eat and rest. Bait was definitely done for the day. As Beach Day, Prepack, and Alias filtered in it became a given we were staying put. It was only 2:30 and the rain had held off this long. But we didn't want to hike another 5 miles to a potentially full shelter.
Bait started a fire and we cooked up the hot dogs he'd carried in. One of the woman told us of a NOBO girl who'd fallen fifteen feet that day, miraculously with only a bruised ego, and was tenting nearby. We sent her a hot dog to cheer her up. 
Northbounders poured into the area over the next two hours. We ended up with 12 in the shelter, after some uncomfortable moments. It's a big shelter and people should be prepared to make room, but there were also plenty of tenting spots and it's bad form to squeeze into a shelter if you arrive late. In at least one case a NOBO named Rocket Man said he had no tent. Sorry, that gets you zero sympathy out here. Sucks to be you if you don't bother carrying necessary equipment. Expecting shelter space because of your poor choices is as bad as refusing to make room for someone. 
I ate way too much of my food. I can't go to town tomorrow because rain will almost certainly blow in, it's 20 miles away, and both hostels are full anyway. So I'll have to stretch it until Saturday.","Grafton Notch (mile 267.2)
",Full Goose Shelter (mile 276.9),"Jul 08, Thu",10.30
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640851,"The several older northbounders were packing and out of the shelter by 5:30. Everything looked thoroughly soaked, and rain came and went. Less rain was forecast than the last time we checked but it would still be a very wet day thanks to the tropical depression off the coast. We hung around waiting for the rain to subside. It would be another short mile day.
Alias made breakfast burritos for everyone from a dehydrated meal bag. Considering I'd planned on only two days to Gorham and hadn't resupplied well this was much appreciated. I've been scavenging a lot of food this trip. Pappy gave me a pasta dinner, Bait brought in hot dogs twice, and now breakfast burritos! I'll have to pack out a treat for everyone. I'm usually pretty generous with whatever I have - Fritos, chips, M&Ms. Pay it forward.
The day started by climbing down a soaked wooden ladder from the ledge on which the shelter stood. It didn't improve. I believe this ten miles to Gentian Pond is not as difficult as the last ten miles, all else being equal. But all is not equal. Today featured thoroughly wet roots, boulders, and ledges, constant mud puddles, slick bog bridges, steady rain and, perhaps worst of all, long car washes from water-logged fir boughs pushing in and down on the trail. Staying anything close to dry was never an option. 
Throw in deteriorating tread on my shoes and the downhills in particular became treacherous. Inching down, planning each step, contorting to keep my center of gravity over my planted foot, avoiding any angled surface. On some level it was an adventure, even a little fun, trying not to bite it on some insanely steep slopes. But mostly it was miserable and stressful. Some days are like that.
I took the side trail to Carlo Col shelter to see if anyone had stopped there. It was over half a mile roundtrip over the same kind of terrain, including a slide of loose round boulders, and no one was there. Oh well, bonus miles. 
I had to put the phone away, and with it the audiobook that had distracted me enough to keep me calm, due to the increasing rain. So the last four miles over Mt. Success and its aftershocks felt a little longer than usual. Here the car wash was much more active, leaving my clothes completely soaked. The temperature was around 60 but I felt chilled even while hiking. 
Met a number of northbounders but only a couple exchanged words. One actually welcomed me to New Hampshire after I'd crossed the border. But generally they looked pretty unhappy and paused just long enough for one of us to squeeze by. 
At the south end of the Mahoosuc Notch there is a sign for the Mahoosuc Trail, which the AT follows. Some wag appended ""ks"" to the name. By the early afternoon that pretty well encapsulated my feelings about the weather and terrain. Mahoosucks.
Gentian Pond Shelter sits on a small knob above a pond with a view of the Moriah-Carter range. When I arrived at 2:30 the clouds were circling the mountains. Over the afternoon they would completely obscure them and reveal them numerous times. Beach Day and Prepack were already here. We were all wiped out after just ten miles. 
So I jumped in the pond - muddy, rocky, shallow and populated with a beaver house - and then began the drying out process. I ate almost all my food, played checkers on the shelter floor, and napped while the mountains disappeared and reappeared. Alias arrived later and shared his home-dried meal of pesto gnocchi with me which I loved but he was disappointed in. No one else showed up, so we spread out on the lower level of the capacious, mostly-enclosed shelter and Alias hung his hammock above.

The day started out better than yesterday's washout, though soon I was being brushed by wet trees again. Stopped at a sunny patch of bedrock to dry out with Beach Day and Prepack.
We gradually made our way over somewhat rocky terrain, passing numerous northbounders getting back on trail after the storm. There were also section hikers and dayhikers. One older couple, a man with a huge backpack and a woman with a large daypack, asked if I was dayhiking. I've gotten this a few times. My pack is fairly small, especially compared to standard weekender packs. And today it was even smaller than usual because I had no food except a tuna packet, a couple tortillas, and a few granola bars. I told them I was long-distance hiking and headed to town with no food, but this didn't satisfy the lady. ""Do you have a tent?"" Yes, I have everything I need. Except food. But town, you see. Shaking her head in disbelief she parted. Beach Day later met them and was asked if he was with that unfriendly guy in the orange shirt, meaning me. Not sure how I rubbed her the wrong way. I always try to be polite and positive with fellow hikers. My guess is her daypack was weighing on her.   Prepack and I raced down the steep hill the last several miles. Despite 2000 feet of descent the trail was mostly dirt and felt wonderful. We were deposited on a dirt access road and roadwalked to route 2. But as we approached the Androscoggin River I spotted a perfect ledge to swim from and hustled down to the shoreline. The water felt fantastic after the hike. It was cool, deep, and clear. The sun was shining. I lay obscured by rocky outcroppings from the bridge as I dried off. Then I dressed and walked in to Rattle River hostel. Even though I wasn't staying - they were booked - I was given a popsicle. I bought a Coke but the vending machine was malfunctioning so someone opened it up and got me what I wanted. They folks know how to make hikers happy. Eric, the owner, also known as Guardian of the Vortex (hostels are often considered time vortices), recognized me and remembered our meeting on Max Patch two years ago when he, Crazy Korean and Sticks had hiked up to bring beers to us. 
I hitched into town with a generous local named Elizabeth heading for the laundromat. I didn't even need to stick out my thumb. I stuck out like a sore thumb just the way I was.
She dropped me at the Barn hostel where the owner Paul welcomed me. It's been less than 10 months since I was here last. Mountain Man is here, having hitched over from Bethel to save on lodging costs while his chafing heals. Everyone else had left to hike. A handful would be returning after slackpacking. Alias showed up, and after showering and doing laundry we grabbed lunch at Mr. Pizza with Beach Day and Prepack, who'd come in from Rattle River. Bait made it to town yesterday through the rain, and his girlfriend has come up to visit for a couple days. 
Alias really wanted a haircut, being a former Marine, but the local salon was closed so Paul shuttled us to Walmart to try their barber. They too were closing. Meanwhile, I had found a set of hair clippers in the hostel and cleaned up my own Einstein hair in about 15 minutes. 
I didn't think I'd need to eat again after my calzone at Mr. Pizza (which for some reason uses cheddar instead of mozzarella on their pizzas and calzones), but by 8 I was at the all-you-can-eat Chinese buffet with Alias, Bait, and his girlfriend Mae, who just graduated with a microbiology degree. 
After that and a cold walk a mile back to the hostel, it was time for sleep in a real bed in the Barn's hayloft.","Gentian Pond Shelter (mile 286.5)

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640859,"I woke up planning to zero, watching others scurry around to catch the shuttles to the trailheads. I walked across the street to get a breakfast sandwich (okay, two sandwiches), and marveled at what an absolutely gorgeous day it was. How could I zero today? I didn't even feel tired. I played Hamlet for a little while before finally deciding to hike. Did a quick and dirty resupply for an overnight over the Carter-Wildcat ranges to Pinkham Notch, after which I'd return to the Barn and really zero. 
Beach Day and Prepack were hiking up from the Rt 2 trailhead by Rattle River. I decided rather than hitch and chase them I'd hike a trail directly out of Gorham up to Mt Moriah and intercept the AT there. It's about the same distance and same elevation gain. I'd considered hiking this trail into town last year during my thruhike but stuck to the white blazes. But now I have no reason not to veer from the beaten path when opportunity presents. In just four years I've gone from white-blaze purist to ""continuous footsteps"" to simply ""eh, it's in the corridor"". At this point hiking the AT is just an excuse to explore the mountains. With 5400 miles of AT on my feet I have nothing to prove to myself or anyone else.
The trail was dreamy for the first couple of miles - dry, dirt, on a steady, reasonable slope. I felt fantastic. I was happy just to be outside and walking on this perfect day, surrounded by the mountains.
Found Beach Day and Prepack on Mt Moriah with several dayhikers. One whose grandmother I'd met two miles back. She had made the ascent in May but was tired and stopped at a viewpoint where the trail had started up steep bedrock slopes. She sent her grown grandson ahead who'd never summited before.
After lunch and drying out our shirts we dropped down from Moriah and climbed up into the Carter range. Here we crossed paths with all the slackpackers from the Barn. Had to take a side trail to the Imp Campsite for water. The stream was running fast down a bedrock sluice. Half of a hollowed-out branch was positioned as a spigot for easy access. 
The three of us hung out at the shelter for a bit where we met the caretaker, Adam. The same catetaker who'd been at Speck Pond warning them about the beavers. We bought thruhiker passes from him which give you discounts on AMC-maintained campsites throughout the Whites, as well as free or reduced-cost food at the huts. Adam is an Adirondack peakbagger and a trail runner. He's been running up to the Carters from here for exercise.
Beach Day and Prepack wanted a short day so stopped when we found a large stealth site on Middle Carter. I continued on down into Zeta Pass and up over Mt. Hight and Carter Dome before plunging down into Carter Notch on a steep series of stone steps. 
The terrain has been an improvement over the Mahoosucs, but is still extremely rocky. Less rooty and boggy, though still plenty of puddles, and fewer ledges and cliffs, though there are still quite a few good scrambles. Having mostly dry surfaces was a huge improvement. Not trusting my worn shoes on wet rocks and roots has been the biggest challenge. 
At Carter Notch I approached the hut. One of the hiker guests called out that I was just in time for dinner. ""That's what I like to hear!"" I answered. Inside, a girl on the hut croo asked if I wanted a bunk. I was surprised they had any availability. But at $122 a wooden bunk was too rich for my blood. I asked about work-for-stay: not happening this year, confirming what I'd heard from many northbounders. Tenting nearby? They pointed me up the trail. Well, that was easy! Dinner? You can't buy just dinner, but there might be leftovers. No guarantees. But I'm willing to gamble! First I bought their last two slices of shoofly pie for four dollars, then gobbled them up as the croo lined up, banged pots, and cried out that dinner was ready. 
While everyone was busy eating dinner I walked down to the pond and skinny-dipped. 26 days in a row! A few minutes after I dried and dressed, two northbounders came along. I'm sorry to say my first thought was that I'd have to fight for leftovers! But all they wanted was a bathroom and water, and shortly they were climbing up to Carter Dome to camp. I, meanwhile, followed the side trail past the sleeping huts and through some rough-looking terrain on the Wild River Trail until I stumbled on a perfect previously-used tent spot. I don't know if it was outside the quarter mile no-tenting area around the hut, but it was far enough that no one would see me. 
Outside the hut I was reunited with Pappy. He's been a day or so ahead for the last week but slowed down in this stretch after zeroing during the rainstorm. He bought an AMC membership and is taking advantage of his flexible budget to stay at this and several other huts over the next week. In fact he only has to walk six or eight miles a day. This is ""platinum blazing"" at its finest.
I poked my head in the hut at the suggested time and the croo immediately knew what I wanted. A girl took me into the kitchen, gave me a plate and fork, and offered a half full 9x12 pan of manicotti, peas, and carrot cake. Manicotti! It's Heaven! I ate nearly all of it, and could have cleaned it out but held back to avoid feeling too full. The croo had moved into their private quarters leaving me the entire dining room. I could hear them laughing and playing music, their work done for the day. All the guests have retired to their bunkhouses or gone on strolls. 
On my way back to camp I took a detour to a placed marked ""The Ramparts"". It's a large field of enormous sharp-angled boulders. I carefully manuevered past a few hut guests and picked my way out to a distant boulder with a view of the valley to the east. As dusk settled in I found my way back to the tent. The air is still and silent, not a sound in the forest.","Rt 2 Gorham (mile 298.2)

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640864,"What a pleasant morning. It was a perfect night to tent. It didn't even drizzle as forecasted. I packed up and caught the hut croo right after breakfast. Leftovers would be available soon, but I decided to leave them for others, possibly Beach Day and Prepack, and eat what I'd brought as I sat by the lilypad-strewn pond.
I hiked out with Pappy, chatting as we climbed the steep slope out of the notch. On the summit of Wildcat we lingered for quite awhile, gazing over Carter Notch. Tendrils of fog wafted up.
While negotiating the Wildcat Ridge we crossed paths with hikers starting the one-day slackpack of this 21-mile section. Alias seemed in high spirits. Not long after Bait and Joseph came through. They had started more than an hour later but were closing the gap fast. I spurred them on a bit, telling them an old man like me did it in ten hours. They were having fun. 
Wildcat has 5 peaks, and on Wildcat D there's a ski lift. Unfortunately not running today. But skiers get an amazing up-close view of the Presidential range. Mt. Washington was in the clouds but the other peaks were clear.
The climb down the Wildcats was not as bad as Adam the caretaker and everyone coming northbound had warned us. There were some bedrock slides and some ledge scrambles but not as bad as we'd had in the Mahoosucs. It did take awhile though to drop 2500 feet. I have no interest in taking my last step, or a hike-ending step, here and planted every foot carefully. It was around 1 when I finally reached the bottom after only five miles. Early on I passed two pairs of northbounders who were very pleased to hear the top was near. I try to be accurate with passing hikers, so if I tell someone they're almost there, they will find the summit right around the corner. 
An English family was starting the climb as I came down, hiking up to Carter Notch hut. Their two young kids were ahead of the parents, eagerly tackling the rocks with their own little backpacks. 
The trail meanders by Lost Pond before bringing hikers to Pinkham Notch. I took the opportunity to get my daily swim. I was drying off when I saw a dayhiker I'd passed earlier slowly approaching. I stepped behind a large boulder to make some token effort to hide my modesty while he slowly - agonizingly slowly - picked his way over the rocky trail. Casually I said hi, since he was just a few yards away, lamely explaining that I'd been hot.
At Pinkham Notch I used my AMC thruhiker card to get a $2 large bowl of Quinoa chili soup and bread, which was delicious. Beach Day and Prepack appeared and we hung out with Pappy until we felt it was time to return to Gorham. Prepack rolled his ankle badly on the way down and it had already begun to swell. Pappy was continuing his hut-to-hut tour with a stay at the Joe Dodge Lodge here in the Notch. 
We stuck out our thumbs and got a ride from Dan, who normally shuttles hikers. He wasn't charging us, just going our way, but I gave him some gas money as a thank you. He's been shuttling for decades. Once he shuttled Bill Irwin, the blind man who thruhiked the AT.
Mountain Man was still at the Barn recovering from chafing but is hiking out tomorrow regardless. Couples Pippi the Hippi and Lollipop, and Wonder and Bean are zeroing. We've been following them in the logs for weeks. Tech, a young southbounder, is recuperating from possible shin splints with his father-in-law Vertigo Tom. Pappy told me how he'd found Tech depressed that he wouldn't make it to Gorham in time to meet his father-in-law. Pappy gave him the confidence to get all the way to Gorham, hiking with him. Pappy told me he was inspired to help Tech by the way he and I had hiked together. I hadn't realized he felt I'd somehow helped him. He certainly surprised me by how quickly he'd regained his confidence after his early injury. 
Vertigo Tom had his own unique story. He'd intended to thruhike when his daughter backed out of hiking with Tech. But he spent 25 hours summiting and descending Katahdin, bruising some ribs and other injuries in the process. He decided to end his hike there and then. Katahdin is a formidable starting line. 
We grabbed pizzas at the Public House Eatery, which seems to be the most popular joint in Gorham. Their brick oven makes the most wonderful pizza pies.","Carter Notch (mile 313.5)

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640866,"First zero since Rangeley, ten days ago. Though I've barely hiked more than 10 or 12 miles a day since so it's a guilty pleasure. More to stay on pace with my tramily than anything else. But I've grown fond of zeroes. When I section-hiked, zeroes were an unnecessary and unscheduled luxury, and I was too antsy to do more than a nero on most trips. During my thruhike I zeroed only twice in the first nine weeks and 1200 miles. But mental weariness made rest days more important in New England. I zeroed four or five days in New Hampshire and Maine last year. On this trip I've already taken three zeroes and several neros. 
Alias had found a gym in town to work on his upper body a couple of days ago. This seemed mildly attractive, as I've been lax in getting my exercises in at the shelters. But the clincher was the hot tub, pool, and sauna. All for ten bucks for the day. 
So Beach Day, Prepack, Alias, Joseph and I spent several hours availing ourselves of all of the fitness center's services. Bait hiked out this morning. From the 170 degree sauna to the hot tub to the pool and back again. I got some reps in on the Nautilus machine so my pecs and biceps aren't completely neglected on this hike. I even snuck around back to jump in the Androscoggin River to get my swim in. Pools don't count. Only natural water sources. The Androscoggin here was the first to have a strong current. It has a shallow and rocky bottom but runs fairly clear.
We followed the gym with the Chinese buffet, only ten bucks for all you can eat. Gorham is a great town for thruhikers! Resupplied at the Dollar General, and saw numerous new hikers coming through. I walked to the post office next door on a whim to see who was hanging out in front and was reunited with Adam, who I last saw in Monson and think of as Trip Leader after his hiking shirt. But now they call him Tarzan because he carries no poles and just swings around the trees. With him were Zombie and Timber, the two girls who had been holed up at the Sterling Inn while Timber's foot healed. They just arrived and planned to zero tomorrow but, to save on lodging, were going to tent behind Walmart tonight. I'm unlikely to see them again. Gorham serves a unique role in bringing together groups that are several days apart on trail. 
Beach Day and I threw the hostel's frisbee around in the park across the street. He played a lot of Ultimate Frisbee in school but hadn't had a game since before Covid. He skunked me in ping pong yesterday, and checkers back at Gentian Pond. A man of many talents. Either that or I've gotten rusty. 
A NOBO couple, the same one that passed me by Carter Notch Hut two evenings ago, was helping Wonder and Pippi lighten their packs, doing pack shakedowns. Wonder's sister came to whisk her group away for a night off trail.
The town held a concert in the park this evening. Two locals, a singer and an acoustic guitarist, covered favorites like Country Road, Hotel California, Beatles, Sweet Caroline, and much more. Fun time. Several dozen locals set up on the lawn. A handful were dancing, mostly some children and adults with developmental disabilities who were being encouraged by their caretakers to enjoy themselves. It was endearing to watch. Gorham seems to be a strong and family-oriented community, the kind of small town America was built on. 
Chatted with a young guy from Israel named Ehud back at the hostel who is northbound. Plans to work at an AMC hut this August when he finishes his hike - to see all the hikers he passed, as he put it - then will hike the Colorado trail. Maybe I'll see him out there.","Pinkham Notch (mile 319.4)

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641009,"The beds are closely spaced in the Barn's hayloft, but surprisingly hikers are so quiet getting up that I was unaware most had already gone downstairs. For some reason I felt tired enough to want to sleep in, but I couldn't miss the 7:30 shuttle. Pinkham Notch would be a long hitch.
Prepack's ankle was swollen and purple, wrapped with an ankle brace gifted by another hiker. Although it felt better than yesterday, he wisely decided to rest another day, even though it meant falling behind. With Bait having taken off yesterday and likely hiking big miles, our six person tramily was only four when we set off for the trailhead.
The visitor center at Pinkham has a sculpted display of the Presidential range. It is at once intimidating to see the terrain, and reassuring to see the trail follow what appears to be a reasonable route up a ridge. Not as reassuring is a comprehensive list along one side of the display of all the hikers who have died in this range since the early nineteenth century. Message received!
We started as a foursome chatting excitably up the Old Jackson Road, also known as the AT. Since these trails predate the AT, they are first labeled with their traditional names. More recent signs append AT in parentheses to help map-challenged thruhikers. White blazes are rare. 
Northbounders were already passing us at eight in the morning, headed to the road and a nero into town. Telling the thruhikers from the weekenders is generally easy, even without smelling them. You occasionally get thrown off by the weekend warrior with dialed-in gear and a full beard, or the thruhiker, typically female, that looks too clean or carries too large a pack to have come 1800 miles. But mostly thruhikers fit the stereotype of gaunt, dirty, scruffy, lightweight machines. If nothing else, they seem to walk with a sense of confidence, even ownership. It's hard to describe without seeing it. Their glance is casual yet penetrating, judgmental yet uncaring. Some barrel through while others politely step aside, but always it's clear they are playing by their own rules. From their viewpoint, there is little difference between southbounders and weekend backpackers. We are both woefully inexperienced, a bit of a nuisance, and perhaps a danger to ourselves. 
The trail rose gently (for the Whites) to Lowe's Bald, a viewpoint up to the high peaks. Clouds swirled through, threatening to engulf the landscape before opening up slightly again. Alias fell behind. At the Peabody River, under a swaying suspension footbridge, Joseph and I jumped into the refreshingly cold and clear waters. A strong current from the cascades buffeted me as I submerged. 
From Osgood campsite the trail, now the Osgood Trail, turned sharply upwards. I quickly fell into a steady plodding pace, stepping from rock to rock at a sustainable heart rate. For the next mile or so I climbed 1800 feet with barely a breather. Not at all easy, but I recall the descent feeling much steeper as a NOBO. 
Once I broke above treeline the breeze picked up and I became less aware of the climb, steep as ever, because the scenery grabbed my full attention. The trail turned completely to rocks. Wind pushed across the ridge we were climbing, turning back clouds like they were hitting a wall. The view ran across the Great Gulf, a huge glacial cirque carved by an old ice age, from Mt. Madison past Adams and Clay to Washington. Only Washington's summit was threatened by cloud cover. It was so clear I was tempted to push across the ridge to Lakes of the Clouds hut today. But even better weather was promised for tomorrow.
Several backpackers heading down Madison looked and sounded quite unhappy, even exasperated. It is a frightening descent. Climbing it is far safer, and more fun. Beach Day and I leapfrogged and scrambled up the boulders like little kids. 
The gusts on Madison's peak had me second-guessing any idea of pushing to Washington today. I almost toppled over more than once. From the summit I followed Whitman in sounding my barbaric Yawp o'er the rooftops of the world, shouting into the wind with equal intensity, matching nature's raw fury with joy and exhilaration.
A short but careful rocky descent brought us to Madison Spring hut, where we found only Joseph. Emily, the sole croo on duty, gave me some leftover chicken and mushroom casserole from last night's dinner, which I supplemented with blueberry cake and lemonade. 
Being two in the afternoon, it was too late to push across the twelve miles of alpine where no camping is allowed. And too early to retire to the Valley Way campsite below treeline nearby. So we dropped our packs at the hut and hiked up Mt. Adams in the clear under partly sunny skies. The trail was mostly a suggested route marked by cairns. Joseph and I took a steeper, more technical route directly to the summit just for fun. Class 2 bouldering but nothing too sketchy. 
The 1.6 mile loop took an hour and a half. By now several groups had come through the hut, some staying for the night. A northbounder with a large white beard stopped in for soup. He looked very tired. I tried to make conversation but he brushed me off. Later, perhaps after seeing the tags on our packs, he came in to ask if we were thruhiking and to apologize for his gruffness. It was a nice gesture. Though it made me wonder whether he would have apologized if we were just out for the night. 
None of us sport much of a beard after I cleaned myself up in Gorham. And we look a bit too clean. It would be easy to mistake us for short section hikers or even dayhikers unless you looked at our pathetically worn-out shoes. 
Despite the pleasant weather a thunderstorm was forecast for this evening. Alias decided to pay to stay at the hut. Beach Day and Joseph made for Valley Way campsite. I was torn. I've never stayed at a hut as a guest, only as hiker trash doing work-for-stay. In fact my son and I crashed in the dining room of this very hut three years ago. I wasn't excited about paying through the nose for a wooden bunk and a couple meals I could probably score leftovers from anyway. But then, with a storm forecasted and the tent sites being far down the mountain and not very pleasant, I wasn't excited about my other options. 
Novelty won out, so I bought into a hut bunk and joined the tourist set for the night. Except for Alias, all were families or couples out for a few days walking hut to hut. The huts make this experience far more accessible than it would otherwise be. Without them, far fewer people would attempt any extended ascent to the alpine zone. 
Emily was joined by four other croo members. Each arrived carrying a wooden frame backpack laden with 65 pounds of vegetables and other food. An exceedingly uncomfortable load to carry over the 3.8 miles from the nearest trailhead.
Dinner was pulled pork BBQ, roasted corn, mashed potatoes and peach cobbler. I wasn't hungry enough to do much damage. I've been hiking ten miles a day on average and eating like twenty miles. My body has long since adapted to hiking and seems to require less food than it did when I started. Alias, on the other hand, single-handedly ate half the table's supply of pulled pork. 
A croo girl from Downingtown, PA, minutes from my home, gave an interesting lecture on alpine plants, showing us several of the rare species found only in the 13 square miles of alpine in the Northeast. Some species are even more limited, like a plant that grows only on Mt. Washington.
The sun set over the valley as I chatted with a guest who runs a publishing business. He published Jennifer Pharr Davis' book Becoming Odessa. When he learned I keep a detailed journal he asked if I ever considered writing a book. I've considered that from time to time. Perhaps I will someday if I feel I have something meaningful to share beyond trip reports. My personal journey is somewhat unusual, yet grows from some yearnings and struggles common among the millions who share my circumstances. And while I feel I've grown significantly from these experiences, even gained a bit of wisdom - at least enough to know what I don't know - it's also taught me humility enough to wonder how applicable or interesting any of this is to anyone else.
As always, I write primarily for my future self, and to help me process and learn from each experience. These are initial reactions that, on rereading, may help me draw some lessons I can use to improve how I adapt and respond to life's opportunities. It's not the circumstances that make the man, it's how he reacts.","Pinkham Notch (mile 319.4)

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641122,"The Madison hut was busy with activity shortly after six. Breakfast was at seven: oatmeal, eggs, bacon, and pancakes. A great lineup, but the croo is not at all good at refilling empty plates. Our table ran out of bacon and pancakes - Alias got none at all - even as other table had leftovers. I've heard this from other guests before, where certain dishes disappeared before they made it around the table. Poet at Shaw's hostel would never let the bacon run out. And he's charging a fraction of the hut's 120 bucks a night.
The company was amiable, the vibe more like airport travelers forced to share a table than hikers with a common mission. I returned to my bunk to pack, the thin mattress adequate but hardly worth the price of admission. Huts in the Alps are far cheaper and more comfortable than these, I'm told. The croo here is paid peanuts (they do a skit with the sole purpose of asking for tips), and the food and amenities are bare bones, so nearly all that cash goes to the AMC. They seem to spend very little on trail maintenance, the reason the organization was founded. No doubt like many flush non-profits much of it goes to fund salaries, lucrative insider contracts, and all kinds of non-core missions the leadership indulges in for publicity. It's not nicknamed the Appalachian Money Club for nothing. Yet thousands of people come every year and many make it a tradition. 
Beach Day and Joseph hiked up from Valley Way tentsite after a mostly dry night, and we headed around Mt Adams to Mt Jefferson. Several hikers were out doing the Presidential Traverse, a one day and 22 mile hike across all the peaks in the range. Clouds rolled through the valley below and across the peaks, obscuring and revealing vistas all the way to Mt. Washington. The trail is almost entirely rocks. In most places they lay naturally, though at least around Mt. Clay they've been arranged almost like pavers. A forest service trail crew was out quarrying and placing rocks on a short stretch of dirt trail that they determined to be overly impacted. It seems comical, that a crew is actually throwing more rocks on the trail, making the often heard joke or lament among hikers a reality. 
Joseph and I reached the cog railway below Mt. Washington, passing a white-bearded man hiking from Key West to Canada, the Eastern Continental Trail. It's 5400 miles and ends in Newfoundland. Maybe by the time he gets there the border will be reopened. Punisher and Boppit, who I met in the Chairbacks, were doing the same route but after reaching Katahdin ended up jumping over to Montana to hike the CDT southbound instead.
It's thruhiker tradition to moon the cog train as it carries tourists to or from the summit. Joseph wasn't up for it and I wasn't wild about doing it on my own so we waved to several cars until Alias and Beach Day showed up. Beach Day was down for a show, but the cars had stopped for awhile so we waited and ate. Finally a train appeared, we waved and, once we had their attention, showed a little more than they expected! Another item checked off the bucket list. We got a glimpse of a man on the train cracking up as it pulled away. 
The Washington summit had the usual mob of car and train tourists, with the added wrinkle that the train we'd just mooned was unloading its passengers. All of whom immediately cued up for a picture with the summit sign. Having no patience to wait in line with folks who took a ten minute scenic ride to scale a mountain we'd spent two days climbing, Beach Day and I grabbed a selfie with the sign and its mob in the background and went on to the more important business of exploring the offerings of the cafeteria. As we left a lady whispered to another ""I think it was them!""
While I was downing a hot dog and some clam chowder in the cafeteria someone yelled out ""Valley Forge!""  I turned, expecting to see some SOBO I may have passed recently. But instead it was a familiar bearded face I never thought I'd randomly see in the Mount Washington Visitor Center. It was Belch, and his wife Hangin', who I'd hiked with for several days in 2019 in Tennessee before completing the AT for the first time in Damascus. I'd later driven out to meet them in Boiling Springs, but soon after that they ended their hike so Hangin' could return to her teaching job. They had overcome tragedy in their lives before the trail. But then, just ten days after I left them in Damascus, they'd survived an attack by a crazed hiker that took the life of a hiker named Stronghold and seriously injured another. That they continued hiking to Pennsylvania after this near-death experience between police interviews and trial dates is incredible by itself. Now they have picked up the hike from where they left off and are one state away from finishing. 
They looked beaten down by the Whites, or by two months on trail, but they were determined to press on and finish. It's amazing the pull the AT has on people. A goal that is achievable but often seems impossible is very difficult to resist once you emotionally invest in it. The difficulty itself makes it seem necessary to accomplish, lest you disappoint yourself. 
Also in the cafeteria was a woman wearing a pageant-style ribbon across her chest that proclaimed she'd just finished climbing the 48 high peaks in New Hampshire. I went over to congratulate her. Her husband had finished in November, and her daughter had flown in from Seattle to hike this last one with her. Up here thruhiking is only one of several extreme mountain pastimes.
As I descended Mount Washington to catch up with the tramily, passing dozens of tourists brave enough to venture away from the parking lot, the gray cloud that had hung over Washington all this time opened up and let loose a squall of large, stinging raindrops that soaked everything and felt like hail. The saying here is if you don't like the weather then wait a minute. Sure enough, less than ten minutes later the rain had stopped, the sun was out, and I had passed into dry ground. Washington seems to have a perpetual cloud hanging over it even when the rest of the range is clear. 
Joseph and I took a short side trail to the upper Lake of the Clouds where we swam from a private rocky shore. This was certainly my most iconic swim of this hike. A nationally-known glacial pond at nearly 6000 feet with hordes of casual hikers passing a few dozen yards away over a small rise. But for ten minutes no one else came down so I got to skinnydip and keep the shorts dry-ish. 
The bottom drops off sharply ten yards from shore into an unknowably deep pool. From beneath the surface the water is a deep azure blue reminiscent of the Caribbean. Of course it was fairly cold, but not uncomfortably so. After drying off we visited the nearby hut, but not for food. We were still full from the cafeteria.
I hiked out from Lakes of the Clouds hut with Joseph to explore the Southern Presidentials. We followed the Crawford Path and took side loops over Mounts Monroe, Little Monroe, Franklin, Eisenhower, and Pierce. Met a female ultrarunner from Virginia doing the traverse in one day. The sky was clear and the views were excellent over the rocky alpine landscape.
At Mizpah Springs hut it was too late to get soup or cake, so we scouted out tent spots in the Nauman tentsite nearby. Adam, the caretaker we'd met at Imp, had left this morning but Autumn was here to help. The tentsite has a dozen wooden platforms, most occupied, and is still cluttered with scores of blow downs, so dirt spots are hard to find. Joseph struggled to set up his Duplex on a platform. As a trekking pole tent it requires tension to stand up, and the platform offered few tie-down points. Rocks were the best option to pin down the guylines. I found the dirt spot I used last year where Alias had already dropped his pack. But as a hammocker he had more flexibility so he graciously shared the area with me. 
A church group from Toledo had several tents near me. They've brought city kids to experience the mountains and have been hiking around the Presidentials for 4 days, including the very steep Tuckerman Ravine trail. The kids seemed to be doing well, and I told one this was some of the most difficult hiking around, which seemed to please him. 
Another large group arrived, and Autumn sent three guys with a four person tent to set up on Joseph's platform. We tried to make it work, but his rock anchor was in the way and their tent was too big. Moving the anchor would have collapsed the tent. Eventually a dirt spot was found for them back in the woods.
The three of us and Beach Day went over to the hut to see about dinner leftovers - lasagna was on the menu! - but the croo hadn't eaten yet. Two other tenters were right behind us with the same idea and camped out in the dining hall to wait. They didn't look like thruhikers, and the leftovers I saw didn't look like enough would survive the croo dinner for more than a couple servings. So we filtered back to our tents, content with our packed food for tonight. The night was very calm and I fell asleep quickly.","Madison Spring But (mile 327.2)

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641123,"I woke early but didn't want to move. A very light rain sprinkled the tent, enough of an excuse to wait for it to dry. The Toledo group around me packed up and left. 
Around 7:30 Alias brought a fresh-cooked breakfast burrito to my tent. He prepared all his food for the hike in advance (his first trail name was Freeze Dry), but breakfasts were all oatmeal, which he tired of quickly. Now he's obsessed with making great breakfast burritos on trail. Since Spam singles are in short supply he used precooked bacon, along with reconstituted eggs and habanero cheddar. He even crisped the bacon on the stove. Best trail breakfast I've ever had!
After moving my sorry butt and packing up, I hung out with Joseph and Beach Day in the Mizpah hut. Both are meeting their parents in Crawford Notch this afternoon for a day or two off trail. The croo put out breakfast leftovers around 9 so I ate very well this morning. Despite having a big day planned I didn't get moving until ten. After all, it was the last time I'd see these guys.
My big day included an unconventional route. Having already traversed the Whites twice I want to see more of what is off the AT, and specifically bag some 4000-footers that are nearby but I've never taken the time to blue blaze. So instead of hiking down the notoriously steep Webster Cliffs I headed down the Crawford Path. It's a much easier descent, but also much more direct to the peaks I wanted to visit. Along the way I swam under Gibbs Falls in a clear, cold, rock-bottomed pool.
Several hikers passed on their way up, including a woman heading up to finish the last two of her New Hampshire 48 peaks - Monroe and Washington. Washington seems to be a popular place to finish. She warned me not to leave Mt. Isolation to last, a mountain maybe six miles from Washington but very difficult to reach otherwise. Hmm, probably too late for that. It'll be a very long dayhike if I ever decide to tackle that peak. 
In the notch I stopped at the AMC Highland Center on the site of the old Crawford House. I've been having intestinal issues this morning, part of the reason I hung around the hut earlier. Had some lunch in the Highland's cafeteria and it was after one before I felt ready to hike further.
Met a painter by the old rail station - now a gift shop - who is the artist in residence this week. His painting session of the station and notch was interrupted by a brief but heavy rain shower, so we scurried under the porch roof.
From there I headed into the diminishing rain up the Avalon Trail, over Mt. Avalon, to Mt. Field, a 4000 footer. Then along a very muddy and rocky ridge for a couple miles to Mt. Willey - an out and back route I had to repeat. Neither peak had a summit sign, just a cairn of rocks surrounded by dense spruce forest. A trail runner wearing only shorts and a hydration vest passed me going out and coming back. Once the ridge path intersected with the A-to-Z trail (Avalon to Zealand I guess?), I dropped my pack for an out and back to Mt. Tom. That's three peaks added to my collection. If my count is correct I have 27 of the 47. 
The A-to-Z trail dropped gradually over 3 miles to the Zealand Falls. Just above the falls sits the hut. It was 6:30 and dinner was in full swing. I planned out tomorrow's peakbagging along the AT, then went in search of a stealth spot, finding one by the Whitewall Brook that feeds Zealand Falls, a few hundred yards from the hut. 
Walking back I found Pappy sitting outside the hut reading a Heinlein novel. He had a short day from Crawford Notch where he'd stayed at the Highland Center, but when the shower came through he decided to stay rather than try for Galehead hut. He enjoys the background chatter of hikers here, while staying apart. We're both headed to Garfield shelter tomorrow. 
Tried to buy a Hershey bar from the hut but they didn't have change for a five, so I ended up buying three bars. Good decision. Headed back to my tent where the roar of the falls lulled me to sleep.","Nauman Tentsite (mile 339.0)
",Whitewall Brook above Zealand Falls (mile 353.2),"Jul 16, Fri",12.60
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641126,"Awake around 5:30 when an early-rising dayhiker passed, miles from the nearest parking lot. Two more lone hikers passed in the next hour. I was on trail before seven. Planning another big day of peakbagging. I decided against returning to the hut for breakfast leftovers. Takes too much time, and someone else will appreciate them. But it was calories I could have used.
Within a mile, after a steep climb, I was treated to a great view from a rocky overlook called Zeacliff of the rockslides along Whitewall mountain, and behind it the Presidentials.
I spent the morning leapfrogging many sets of backpackers, peakbaggers, and trail runners. Met a flip-flopper named Lizard on the wooded summit of Zealand with her three cousins doing a section with her. Coming into Guyot campsite for water, behind me was a girl named Katie doing the Pemi Loop and very curious about my hike, as she plans to thru herself. She's bagged all 48 New Hampshire high peaks not once but thrice in the past year, so I think she's ready. 
Rain came and went throughout the day, and I spent much of it in the clouds. Often the clouds descended as I approached a peak, then lifted as I left. A bit of bad timing. The rain was never heavy. Just light and long. Everything was soaked by the afternoon, the trees brushed water on me, my rainjacket wetted out, and mud puddles were everywhere. Which of course meant wet feet. The trails were almost all rocks dumped at crazy angles, and with everything wet and slick the going was slow. I kept my good humor most of the day, accepting that I had no control over any of this. The choice is merely to hike or camp. 
All in all I bagged eight 4000-footers today: Zealand, Guyot, Bond, Bondcliff, West Bond, South Twin, North Twin, and Galehead. Only South Twin is directly on trail. The Bonds required a five and a half mile out and back, North Twin two miles, and Galehead a mile. How much extra elevation I gained I can only guess, but the day's total probably exceeded 7000 feet. And none of it was easy. 
At Galehead Hut the croo gave me hot tomato soup. I'd been looking forward to hot soup for hours, chilled in my wet clothes and wet jacket. Only hiking kept me warm. The soup was more like marinara sauce, and that was just fine with me. A SOBO named Doubletime came in. He's hiking with his sister - both of them had been planning thruhikes so they decided to join forces - but she'd fallen behind and didn't appear in the hour and a half I was in the hut and out bagging nearby Galehead Mountain. No doubt the ugly rockslide climb down South Twin was slowing her down. 
The three miles to Garfield Ridge shelter were tedious, over very rocky, muddy trail and my legs and ankles were tired. My mood by now was sliding into the familiar litany of cussing the trail, the trail-builders, and the trail-maintainers. But at this point at least I am very self-aware that I've simply lost patience. It's my own fault for making it such a long day. The last half mile was a tough climb to the shelter, including a very steep loose rockslide with a waterfall streaming through it. My nearly tractionless Lone Peaks slid off a boulder in front of a sympathetic NOBO coming down the slide. It was far from the first time I slipped today. My happiest moment of the day was seeing the shelter turnoff. The rain had stopped but everything was still wet. Nothing dries until the sun comes out. 
The shelter is full of NOBOs keeping mostly to themselves. A large tramily occupies the top shelf. Pappy is here, and a man with his labradoodle. A large group is tenting nearby and still talking loudly as everyone in the shelter nods off. A grizzled NOBO named Polar Bear is a big snorer. Have been lucky not to have many of those.
Although the day was wet and often miserable, it was liberating to run off trail, often without my pack, to bag peaks I've not been to before. My regret is not jumping in Zealand Falls this morning. There were no other water sources bigger than a spigot today. So sadly my swimming streak ends at 31 days. Still a full month! Maybe I can make it an AT challenge: a month of swims. If nothing else it's just downright enjoyable.","Whitewall Brook above Zealand Falls (mile 353.2)
",Garfield Ridge Shelter (mile 362.8),"Jul 17, Sat",18.50
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641142,"Garfield shelter was bustling early, but no one was eager to head out into the rain. Wet clothes hung from dozens of hooks around the large open area in front of the sleeping platforms, no drier than last night. Only my rainjacket showed some improvement. It'd be great if it didn't wet out in the first place though. 
One middle-aged NOBO kept fiddling with his phone as he'd done all yesterday evening, apparently looking for the silver bullet that would turn this day into an easy one. Weather forecasts, hut locations, stealth sites, even the idea of just zeroing in the shelter, were bandied about by the northbounders. I can't blame them. They were facing at least several days to the next town and might not dry out until then. I, on the other hand, was headed to town today. 
It was still ten miles to the valley, however, and the overnight rain gave me no optimism that today's conditions would be better than yesterday's muckfest. I ran out to the bear box to get my nearly empty food bags, getting a taste of the rain. Even if I didn't need to catch a bus out of Lincoln tomorrow, I wouldn't have enough food to hang around here.  Pappy left and I followed twenty or thirty minutes later. 
Garfield Ridge is a slow and tedious section below treeline even in good weather. Today was not good weather. Plenty of slick rocks, oddly angled boulders that invited me and my work shoes to slide off, and a sea of muddy water all around them. So it was slow and cautious rock-hopping to stay above the muck, with the inevitable slips or stumbles to frequently soak the shoes. I made the mistake of checking my progress by GPS, only to learn I was doing about one mile per hour. At that rate I would be in town for dinner instead of late breakfast.
Caught up with Pappy taking off his wetted out rain pants as I began the climb up to Lafayette, highest peak in New Hampshire outside of the Presidentials. ""A mile and a half to the summit,"" I told him, which was the last time I would check the GPS for hours. ""I'm going to keep trudging on.""
The steady but light rain, more of a dripping shower from the saturated trees above, quickly grew heavier and more direct as the forest fell away. The calm air I'd taken for granted almost instantly whipped into a frenzy. Around me was nothing but whirling mist and the boulderly alpine trail. I was reminded of my ascent up Saddleback four summers ago when a crazed hiker coming down had warned me of the wild conditions above treeline, a warning I took too lightly and paid for with a brief bout of hypothermia. 
""Shelter in the krumholz!"" he'd cried, before dashing further down to safety. 
Only there is no krumholz here. Just rocks and the alpine vegetation clinging to them for dear life.
One false summit after another loomed through the mist, at least a half dozen in all. On a clear day I might be able to see along the ridgeline to Lafayette about a mile away. But visibility was only a few dozen yards so I had no idea how far it was. My GPS phone was sealed in a Ziploc and not coming out unless the situation was critical. I had to be patient, and just keep moving forward.
I met just one hiker on this normally packed stretch of ridge, one of the most scenic in the eastern US. He was a trail runner going north, and as we met he yelled something completely lost to the wind. I merely smiled and gave a thumbs up. Whether he spoke a warning, advice, a question, or wry commentary on the weather hardly mattered. I was already in the thick of it and not going back. 
Gale force winds more suited to a tropical storm buffeted me whenever the trail wound to the eastern or southern sides of the rocky knobs. Rain pelted me sideways. My poncho wanted to fly off my body and leap a thousand feet in the air. 
I monitored myself for signs of hypothermia. Fingers not yet numb but dexterity fading. Toes alright. Dizzy? No. Confused? Not yet.  
As I approached Lafayette I started to get a little silly, even punch drunk, laughing at the storm and reveling in its intensity. I was aware if I stopped and cooled down, even out of the wind, it might get worse. So I rushed ahead, hiking hard over the boulders and rubble, gliding over rocks and trying not to take any bad steps. Pappy was somewhere behind me, but I couldn't stop and wait. Hopefully he still had his wind pants.
Lafayette's summit was peak wind intensity, and of course I found the highest point, clambored up, faced the wind full on, and yawped as loud as I ever have. No one could hear. 
From there, it was generally downhill to treeline, still two miles off, but with several legitimate peaks like Lincoln still to be scaled. I hiked quickly, the cold winds seemingly energizing me.
Then, before I expected, I was descending back into the trees and swampy trail. I had practically run across the alpine zone. The wind died down to a breeze, the rain lessened to a steady drizzle. A young man with a small pack passed, heading up. I warned him of the conditions but he said it's not bad. Well, not right here, but up there! He waved it off, saying he works up here. Soon a second guy came along who looked like a thruhiker. He was much more open to the warning but proceeded cautiously. Again, normally I would be passing hundreds of people here, so many I'd practically have to elbow my way through. 
I passed the turnoff to Mounts Liberty and Flume and paused. I had made it across the worst of the exposed trail, but spending another two miles above or near treeline seemed foolhardy. There would be no unnecessary peakbagging today. 
Below the ridge the wind disappeared entirely. Then the rain. Steep but reasonable trail led past Liberty Springs Campsite where backpackers began to appear. It was late morning. I warned every group I encountered of the storm above. But as the sun came out and the birds began chirping, it began to seem ludicrous. I wondered if conditions could have improved so dramatically up on the ridge, or if I was simply descending out of it. 
This Liberty Springs Trail and the Crawford Path are the least technical descents I've encountered. They are also among the oldest and most popular. Steep, sure, but also well-maintained. Enough rocks to prevent erosion and make a safe ascent or descent in the rain, but not so much they slow you down with acrobatic contortions. Why there aren't more such trails in the Whites after 150 years of AMC trail-building is the question. 
At the bottom I scrambled under the footbridge over Cascade Brook, stripped down, and went for a swim in the madly rushing reddish whitewater. I was soaked anyway, and this was cleansing and refreshing. 32 out of 33 days for swims in this section.
As I walked down a mile of paved bike path to the Flume visitors center it began to rain again. Well, so much for it improving up on the ridge I guess. At least they won't think I'm crazy.
Teri, a local trail angel who thruhiked in 2016, picked me up in his new black F-150 along with three northbounders who had also come out of a wet mess. He had no room for them at his place, so made arrangements for them to go to another trail angel named Chet and dropped them at the McDonald's. He drove me a mile up the road to his ski resort condominium. 
He's hosting seven hikers in his two bedroom condo tonight. Alias, who arrived late yesterday after pushing over the ridge (and getting some nice views!), Billy Goat, who I met at the Barn in Gorham, and two northbound couples, all of them zeroing today. 
Teri sent me to Black Mountain Burger where  their special is the Smitty, a half-pound of beef between two grilled cheese sandwiches. I polished it off and all the sweet potato fries and was still hungry. I'd had only a couple breakfast bars and crackers earlier today. Alias and Teri joined me in a beer.
The condo resort is mostly absentee owners renting their places to vacationers. Teri is one of the few residents, though he is usually only here during the summer. The resort has two pools, two hot tubs, a game room and a gym available to all. Quite the luxury hiker spot. I can't call it a hostel because it's really operated as a trail angel opening his home to selected hikers. Teri has had to send some individuals packing who were being overly obnoxious to the others. Sometimes they aren't really hikers, but yellow-blazers looking for a party. It's hard to screen over the phone. Chet, the other trail angel in town - who is legally blind and in a wheelchair - used to quiz hikers, mostly in jest, as to which mountain they'd just come over or what was next to separate the poseurs from the real hikers.
Alias and I hit the Mexican place for dinner. I tried to go light, ordering ""only"" a burrito. I devoured it and was still hungry. But I have to be good and get back to a normal diet now that I'm off trail. 
Everyone was asleep when we returned, but Teri had gone to meet some other southbounders called the Mountain Turtles at the Woodstock Brewery and returned even later. He and I ended up staying up even longer engrossed in conversation. 
Tomorrow, a few reflections on this hike.","Garfield Ridge Shelter (mile 362.8)
