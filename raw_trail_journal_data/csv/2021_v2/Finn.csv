My inability to fall back to sleep is providing me with an opportunity to write my first entry into our blog. We are to head south early Sunday morning to begin our latest AT adventure. For Huckleberry the trail is always “calling” him...a challenge to be met, a place where he feels at home and one with nature...surrounded by natural beauty, ruggedness, he is eager and excited. For me, Finn, I am less sure of what my body and mind will be able to accomplish, which makes me more anxious. Huckleberry always takes care of me, and that should be good enough...but for me it is a test of trust. Having hiked some of the trail, and being aware of “pitfalls” along the way ...”both real and imagined...” I need to summon what feeble courage I have, take one step at a time, and set out with my very best friend and “True Companion” for our 2021  “hike into spring.”
Please join us vicariously in our journey, and post occasionally if you wish...your encouragement will be appreciated.

Some of you will recall that two years ago our friend Mark or “Stick” as we call him, as this is his trail name, injured his leg very severely in a fall.  This resulted in quite an adventure, including a rescue operation of paramedics and firefighters. This guy was “so bad” that the first hospital literally turned us away. Anyhow...more about Stick later.

It’s been a good day to travel and the three of us have shared many stories and lots of laughter. Our destination is Knoxville, TN which is about two hours from where we plan to start our hike tomorrow.  Stick’s wife, Debby met us at our pick up point. It’s her birthday tomorrow (Happy Birthday, Debby!!🎂)  and she gave her husband a great send off and her blessing!!  My brother, Bruce met us there too and although we keep in frequent touch by phone it was so nice to see him in person as it had been almost a year.  Signing off for now.

Left the Comfort Inn in Knoxville around 9 am.  We didn’t get to bed until around 11 but we slept like babies, tired but happy to have reached our destination as planned. We headed for Uncle Johnny’s Hostel in Erwin, TN where we left our car and shuttled to our starting point at Allen Gap. On the way, our driver, Tom, stopped for us at the volunteer fire station in Laurel where we thanked the paramedics, ambulance drivers and firemen that had helped us when our friend Stick had badly injured his ankle and leg.  They were very pleased with the homemade maple syrup we brought as our thank you gift.

This is definitely one of Huckleberry’s favorite places on thE AT. He has always wanted to come back to this spot...Firesscald. To be honest, it was a grueling hike but now we are in our tent (very stiff, sore and tired) but pleased that we did it!  Providence prevailed as we were able to set up our tent just before dark and it rained just a little.

Today’s hike was like “Walking into Spring...” Spring beauties were prolific and filling the gaps with lush white and green...reminds us of pure white snow.  Interspersed in forest splendor were beautiful purple violets...I decided that every time I see a violet I will think of Hadley and every time I see a spring beauty bouquet I will think of Hazel. It is nice to have things and people you love to encourage you to move forward, step by step. I am wearing a necklace that a dear friend has given me in memory of her daughter, Heather, that has already given me strength and courage. This is not an easy trail...far more challenging physically than the Camino de Santiago in Spain that we did in 2019, but with Huckleberry’s help, we will get through this. Just-a-note, dear friends.  We are “off the grid” much of the time and on the blog guestbook we can not respond to you, so no need to worry, but your encouraging guestbook signings, emails and texts are welcome.

Today we left Flint Mountain and the hiking day was perfect to be able to “move out” at a pretty nice clip. We were only going three miles to a hostel to take what we call a “Nero” day. The owner of “Laurel Hostel” is a very nice young man who had lived here all his life..Tim. He was so kind to make us three pizzas on the grill  in front of the shelter.  Refrigerator is packed with pop, beer, hot dogs, hamburgers, and other good food that is so appreciated when you are on the trail.

 Stick left Laurel after us as he wanted to get a few things organized. He is a good strong hiker and caught up to us at the Cascades. We decided to do a selfie of all of us and Huck offered Stick Man his phone to use...well, it dropped into the creek and Stick scrambled to retrieve it...thank goodness he did NOT fall!  Falling with a thirty-five pound pack on your back is never a good thing!  Anyway, all has ended well, the phone appears to be working just fine.  Huck and Stick are back to kidding each other, like immediately. No hard feelings. 
We met lots of kind hikers today and sat around the campfire sharing our personal stories. All of the younger hikers were so attentive, respectful and kind (maybe because they know we’re older) but actually I think they are just all nice people. Tomorrow we are considering possibly doing 10 miles. Huck has taken a good portion of my weight to help lighten my load. I wish he didn’t need to, but the terrain is rugged. Keep those prayers coming.

P.S.  a few additions...the hike also included a “little picnic” at the top overlooking the beautiful mountain vista. We could see what we thought was Bald Mountain in the distance.

Finn had a rough night sleeping due the cold. Awake until almost 5 and then woke Huckleberry to get warmed up. Finally, fell asleep and got enough rest to carry on today. 
Lots of good things happened today. After hiking about 2.4 miles we got to Sam’s Gap where I experienced my first Trail Magic. Coming down out of the mountains to the highway, we were greeted by a pick up truck and table set up next to the highway with bananas, apples, bread, peanut butter and jelly, cheese crackers, and best of all hot, brewed, strong, smooth coffee!!  I felt like I had arrived at a hiker’s Starbucks!!  The gentleman who was sharing this hospitality was Jerry, a retired trucker from Greenville, NC. Others do this periodically along the trail and are called “Trail Angels.”  Huckleberry enjoyed wonderful “Trail Magic” during his thru-hike.  Another bit of “Trail Magic” happened on the top of a mountaintop when, a young hiker “Little John” from Oregon met up with us and gave us a double cheeseburger from McDonald’s that a friend had delivered to him at Sam’s Gap. His friend had delivered twenty burgers for him to share with his fellow hikers. Needless to say we were thrilled and extremely thankful!!  We continued hiking until 4 o’clock. Stick had gone ahead at Sam’s Gap so we will meet him tomorrow or the next day. He is a strong hiker as is Huckleberry, but Huck and Finn need to stay together...as you all know, dear friends, “it is a life sentence!:)”

We left Low Gap this morning having had a breakfast of Cream of Wheat and coffee mocha. We were headed towards a well known spot on this part of the AT, Big Bald. It was quite a climb...elevation is 5000plus feet. It was a beautiful day, but temps in the morning and nighttime are quite chilly, averaging in the 30’s. Huckleberry decided to zip our sleeping bags together to help me get warm as I am having trouble sleeping...partly because I am cold and possibly partly because I can’t unwind and settle down.  Last night a group of young hikers had us play a game of cards by the fire. It is called “Insider.” It was a lot of fun and we just had some really good laughs. Felt so good. These young people were so kind and respectful of us and nicely impressed with Huck’s thru hike accomplishment. Chaps just graduated from Purdue and plans to go into National Park Management. He had to have an infected tooth pulled out in Gatlinburg and is going to wait until he gets home to Indiana to have it taken care of.  He is currently wearing it around his neck on a cord. Makes him sound like a hillbilly but he is far, far from it!  He is a hunk and very, very handsome!  And not only that he is just such a great young man with a great future. All those guys were just great!!  When we got to Big Bald the view was amazing!!  We spent time there calling Jon and Jenny also the Vorpahl’s to wish Rick a Happy Birthday (a little early because we don’t ever know when we will have cell service.) One other highlight was that we were able to link on to our zoom worship church service from First Prez.  Good to at least link up though we couldn’t stay on as we have limited battery power. Our best to everyone!  Stick Man is fine and ahead of us. We will meet in Erwin on Tuesday...God willing.

Finn,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635261,"Finn finally had a full night’s sleep!  This morning after 8 days of hiking, I finally am “into the groove.”  Looking at my dirty fingernails, and disheveled hair, I am thinking...not WHY am I doing this...but how good it will feel when I can actually get cleaned up. We have been blessed with ideal spring hiking weather, beautiful panoramas of spring beauties and wildflowers and mountain vistas that one can only appreciate by being here. Nature’s testimony to the glory of our awesome Creator God. Just a side note...we have been hiking for eight days and we miscalculated how much food we would need. We are almost out of food and realized this would happen two days ago, which could have been one of the reasons Stick Man decided to move ahead by a day. To stretch our food further, we ate a half of the amount of pea soup Saturday night and stroganoff we had dehydrated last night. In a “hiker’s box” at Laurel Hostel, Huck picked up an instant potato packet which made a really good breakfast this morning. Packing up and heading out.

P.S.  Today was a good day of hiking. We had trail Magic at Spivey Gap...Gabe our host and Ratatouille his cute little dog had a wonderful spread for hungry hikers. Being low on food until Erwin, we enjoyed a Sausage Egg McMuffin (cold, but it tasted delicious!!). From there it took us about 5 hours to get to camp. I have a tender spot on my left foot so Dr. Huckleberry taped it up for tomorrow. Should help. Saw beautiful wildflowers...several new species. Some wild irises that were stunning.

It’s been a week since our last showers and it was heavenly!!(previously my fingernails were filthy and my hair was pasted to my scalp.) I managed to clean up pretty well. Since our car was here, we were able to go into town and have supper. At this point, you realize how hungry you are and you want to order everything on the menu. We went to a really good diner and the food was satisfying, delicious and our server was such a nice young woman we gave her a generous tip for all of her kindness. Got back to the hostel, did laundry, and sat around gabbing with fellow hikers. We have met so many interesting people.

It has been quite the day!  We left the Super 8 at 8 this morning. I would NOT recommend staying there, unfortunately. The people were nice enough but overwhelmed and cleanliness was definitely not even possible. After driving thru McDonalds we headed up towards Rowan’s Mountain.  Researched a hostel where we could arrange for a shuttle and leave our car there. Super neat place...a hiker’s favorite. After arranging to reserve bunks for tomorrow night, we grabbed the shuttle and went to the top of the mountain (about a 45 minute ride).  Upon arrival Dave unloaded our gear and we realized that all three of us had left our hiking poles behind...NOT GOOD!  A Very kind gentleman from New York who was supplying his daughter and her friend hikers, kindly took us back and forth. He would not accept any payment, but Huckleberry slipped some money into his car next to his water bottle. He was definitely “heaven sent.”  We started up the trail about 11. The trees were frosted with ice and snow and creating a breathtakingly beautiful landscape. Thankfully, the trail pathway was not really slippery, but rugged for sure. All three of us made our way through the miles working hard, but making progress. It was very cold all day but we were dressed for it.  Stick made it to camp ahead of us and when we arrived we all set up camp.

In addition (for ladies only)  I had to crawl out of the tent eight times (yes, I counted) to do what men get to do by “peeing in a bottle.”  Totally, not fair!!!  However, I did survive so I shouldn’t complain. The good thing is that the ground, etc. wasn’t wet, which would have made it so much worse. The wind kept the mountaintop we were on as “dry as a bone.” Huck made mashed potatoes and hot coffee for breakfast and Stick packed up and started hiking at 8:30...we started out at 9. Cool, sunny, nice day for photographing and hiking. The terrain was really demanding on our bodies. The rocks were EVERYWHERE and we had to negotiate and navigate around them in such a way, slowly, tediously, carefully so as not to fall. My hiking ability and Huck’s and Stick’s are world’s apart, and that is why Stick needs to go ahead so he can achieve the best pace for his own safety and comfort. Unfortunately, Huck is not able to adjust his pace to what is good for his body as he has to watch over me. All of us were very, very weary when we arrived at Station19 Hostel. Our host, Dave, was waiting to shuttle us from the trailhead at the highway because Stick had alerted him on our expected arrival. We were able to get to our bunks, unload and have delicious food prepared by Dave’s wife, Karen and “Miss Hospitality” Amy, who I immediately hugged!!  (What’s really neat is that the three of them are excited to go hike the Camino when this COVID is over.)  The three of us shared a Yuengling  beer brewed in Pottsville, PA that Huck had discovered during his thru hike in 2017. In a collection of the Hiker’s Yearbook 2017 I was proud as his wife to show off his picture to everyone we talked with that night. We reunited with a lot of the hiker friends that we have made along the way and ended the evening with karaoke with my personal favorite young man, Chaps” singing “Breakfast at Tiffany’s” for his girlfriend. She is one lucky girl, I would think. ( I am sure he must feel the same way about her.  Not every girlfriend would want their boyfriend taking off for six months!)  Stick, Huckleberry and Finn ended the evening at “ Hiker’s Midnight” and slept without a care until morning, each of us personally satisfied with what we had accomplished on our hike.  The future for us all lies ahead, but what I do know is that “the AT and it’s mountains will always be calling my Huckleberry” if only in memory.”  I am beyond blessed!!

Finn,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635695,"Abingdon, VA driving to Damascus, VA to bike the “Virginia Creeper.”
Slept in at the hotel and left at 11am for Damascus to catch our bike shuttle up to Whitetop Mountain. We got fitted for our bikes and then driven up to the start of the Creeper. The Virginia Creeper got its name from a rail line that ran from Abington, VA to Whitetop Mountain. The train delivered people, supplies and coal to the top of the mountain. On its return to town it would bring down timber. The total line length was 33 miles. As the train passes through town and heads up to the mountain, it would barely be moving going up the mountain. Because of the SLOW speed it was nicknamed the Creeper. Later named the Virginia Creeper. Now it’s used as a bike trail. It follows a raging river for over 17 miles, with multiple stops to photograph and soak your feet in the water. 
What an experience for three “mature” bikers. I could scarcely get my leg high enough to get on the seat (which Ron had to adjust 3 times.) None of us had been on a bike for years ( well, to be fair, Huckleberry rode this trail 4 years ago when he thru hiked.) Stick rode well, in spite of the fact that his bike seat came loose while he was riding 
causing significant discomfort for the entire ride. But when you are dropped off in a remote location and there is no cell service you have no choice but to “make due.”  
To sum up our AT hike, it has been an awesome experience to re-live what it takes to hike such a physically and mentally challenging trail. It is not for the “faint of heart.”  At any age it is a test of an individual’s fortitude, strength, and determination.  The effort is commensurate with the rewards. The natural beauty that we witnessed in the mountains, woods, in wildflowers, in panoramic landscapes, in blue skies, in rivers, creeks, cascades and snowy mountain tops, is best experienced by “being present...being there.”  We faced rigorous challenges...bitter cold, lack of sleep, rocky, treacherous terrain, conservation of food and water, and even though there were three of us...loneliness...missing not just the comforts of home, but more so the other people we love. 
Our actual section hike took 12 days away from civilization and we walked over 70 miles. We met so many awesome people that we might have only 
talked to for a few minutes or some that we shared some deeper connection with, but we can honestly say that we found that the challenges of the trail creates a community of caring, compassion, and kindness that brings out the best in people. We are grateful that we were able to finish what we started and that God watched our steps, keeping us safe and healthy.  To all of our dear family and friends following our hike...THANK YOU!
