Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637528,"Our Hartford, Connecticut friends Al and Cathy were kind enough to take me from the airport to where I began my AT adventure in 2014. Since then I’ve hike almost 900 miles south to Bland, Virginia and now I’m heading north for a few weeks. I started hiking around 4pm and didn’t get to the shelter till 8 so I was still filtering water and eating when everyone was asleep in their tents or the shelter. I think they’ve call 9pm “hiker midnight” and it was true tonight. I’m not used to being the last one up at night. I thought about not setting up my tent and sleeping in the shelter but was thinking the gnats might be bad. Actually when I was walking down by the bear box I saw a rat so maybe I made the right decision to sleep in my tent.","Bulls Bridge

Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637624,"Since I was the last one into camp it didn’t surprise me that I was almost last one out of camp in the morning. Met two sixty plus section hikers from Florida and Alabama who told me “hiking the AT gets exponentially harder after age sixty” - not what I really needed to hear. There was a tough (steep and rocky) descent early is day which was the twenty somethings also said killed their knees so some things are universal out here. Perfect view today from Caleb’s Peak where I was able to call my wonderful wife for her birthday. The trail went along the Houstanic River and I’m camping along side it tonight with a weekend hiker from Brooklyn who installs high end artwork in homes and an emergency medical tech from Mystic, Connecticut. The heat made it a tough day so was glad to get into my tent by 9","Mount Algo Shelter

Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637669,"Got an earlier start to beat the heat but encountered some biting flies and mosquitoes which were faster than men. Trail Angel (Butterfly Bob) was at a road crossing so I enjoyed a Gatorade, cliff bar and banana. Bob was a veteran like my dad who passed away in October. Maybe my dad helped arrange this trail magic! Also went to the Mountainside cafe for a tasty meal although I felt like I was in another world made up of non long distance hikers - the snippets of conversations I heard included “mom just opened up her pool”, “what Venture Capital company are you working with”and cooking asparagus with brown butter. I’ve heard none of these topics on my last 3 days on the trail.  Shelter tonight is way off the trail (1/2 mile) and a very steep. Only group is a family of 3 here for the night","Caesar Brook Campsite

Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637736,As it start getting dark we started hearing the coyotes (8 short “woots” or 1 long). The dad of the family at the campsite said he and his son camped in the same spot a year ago and he said a pack of coyotes surrounded their tent but turning their headlamps scared them away. So..when I heard the coyotes at 3 & 4:30am we both turned on our headlamps and I never heard get close. A new life skill every trip.  Lots of weekend hikers enjoying the views on Bear Mountain and had a nice conversation with a guy from Charlotte who has been section hiking the AT since the 80’s and has less than 75 miles to go.  Met “Juice” from Harper’s Ferry and he and I are at the same tentsite tonight and we are heading in for a food resupply and I spending a night at the Travelodge.,"Limestone Spring Shelter

Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637809,"The hiking day consisted of 2 big climbs, a 180 degree view of the valley, and a porcupine who paralleled me walking and then climbed up a tree. We were unable to find a shuttle from the trail to Great Barrington so the only option seemed to be to hitchhike (vs walk 5 miles). My hiking partner Juice suggested that it works out better if one guy sticks out his thumb and another guy waits in the bushes and when someone stops you ask the driver if your buddy can get a ride. So I tried (and I don’t ever remember hitchhiking) and after 15 minutes Juice comes out and says I’m hitching in the opposite direction. Of course he tries next and we get a ride in a pickup truck from a really nice guy with a bunch of piercings on his face and he said he gave us a break because he has trouble getting picked up hitching. So we went to the Great Barrington for a couple beers and a nice off trail meal","Laurel Ridge Campsite

Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637909,Since we had challenges yesterday with getting a ride to town our waiter at the brewery said his brother would contact us in morning for a ride to the trail. Unfortunately he was on a late night schedule and we hadn’t heard from him by 9am so we had to go to Plan B. Luckily I had seen Luigi (hiker from Austin who we met yesterday) at the hotel and he gave me Trail Angel Papa Joe’s number who picked us up right away and also let us know he had left jugs of water out for hikers about 10 miles away (which worked out nicely for us as some of the streams didn’t look great). Quite a bit of the area was boggy/muddy so really appreciated the hard work the Massachusetts Trail Club did to put long runs of boards thru those areas.  We stopped Tom Leonard Shelter (has an upper loft) for lunch and met Freebird and Air Drop who have recently retired from the US Military.  Passed beautiful Benedict pond (the kind you want to jump into) and arrived at Mount Wilcox North Shelter.  Guacamole (young guy from New York) and Perseverance (75 year old from Florida) were already here.,"Travelodge Motel

Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638071,"I had read about this Shelter and was looking for to but this 2 story cabin which sleeps 15 was still closed due to COVID (but open for tenting). When it is back in operation the Appalachian Mountain Club staffs it with a caretaker who cooks pancakes for breakfast (much better than my recent breakfast of 4 Pop Tarts) 


We took a swim and rinsed clothes in lake just before a Thunderstorm came through. Ate dinner on balcony with Juice, guacamole and No Plan (Clemson student who took a semester off to hike the trail.)","

Saw my second bear on the AT, was across a lake with it’s cub so we made plenty of noise for the next few miles. Got another view of Mount Greylock (tallest mountain in Massachusetts) which coming up in a couple days.

Today’s update is mostly about meals. Breakfast burrito in Dalton, meatball sub and milkshake while waiting for bus to motel, another dinner and a beer at Applebee’s. Since you burn about 5000 calories a day it is hard to eat enough to keep weight on and backpack hip belts don’t get as small as you need them. Luckily I learned a trick and stuck a pad between my hip and backpack belt so now I can cinch up my pack so it rides on my hips and not on my shoulders. 


We (Juice and I) came into Cheshire to resupply plus 1.2” of rain and a low of 38 degrees tonight.  


FYI. If you want to see videos by a thru hiker on the area I’m hiking. Taylor “nahamsha hiker” has hers starting in Connecticut at day 82, I’m currently in the area around day 89. https://m.youtube.com/channel/...","Kay Wood Shelter 
",Econolodge,"May 28, Fri",11.80
Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638246,"As we got off the bus in Cheshire to restart our hike I realized I had no trekking poles! I thought I must have left them at the bus stop (I had run back and forth from the bus stop to the bus making sure it was the right one) or the hotel. It would have taken hours using the bus system to go back to the hotel so…I look across the street and I see a guy coming out of the post office heading to a Jeep with a dog. I must have had a panicked look on my face as he asked me if he could help with anything. With that Dave, his dog Griffin and I were headed 20 minutes back to search for my poles.  No luck at either the bus stop or hotel so he also took me to Dick’s Sporting Goods where I bought poles and a gift card (as he wouldn’t let me pay him)for Trail Angel Dave. Dave then drove me the 20 minutes back to Cheshire! Talk about there being good people in this world.  
Now Juice must have been thinking “how can this guy have completed 1000 AT miles (today’s milestone including my 3 other section hikes) when he tries to hitchhike in the wrong direction and can’t keep track of his trekking poles” but he told me he would wait for me at the first shelter 
Two big lessons
Back in the “real world” we hear too much about people that do the wrong things. When I’m on the trail I’m always amazed by the kindness of complete strangers. I think the reality is that this world is full of wonderful people who we haven’t met yet. A big reminder to myself that I make mistakes when I rush or get disorganized- so I need to take the time to do the “next thing” correctly which may mean more slowly! 
Juice was at Mark Noeppel Shelter where but he was tired and cold and wanted to sleep and join me later at the next shelter


Weather was wicked (cold, rainy, very windy) and it hailed at the summit of Mount Greylock (highest peak in Massachusetts) and thin sheets of ice were coming off the monument. One hiker said a bear came fairly close to him when it was crossing the trail so I made plenty of noise with my trekking poles when I went around blind corners. 


Made it to shelter by 4 and an AT Ridgerunner (who walks the trail checking on any issues and answering questions) named Sawtooth was here. He ended up building a fire and Juice arrived around 7pm. What a day!","Econolodge
",Wilbur Clearing Shelter ,"May 29, Sat",11.80
Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638247,"Started hiking in 20-30 mph winds with over an inch of rain forecast. We stopped at Seth Warner not too long after crossing into Vermont and joining the “Long Trail” The Long Trail and the AT share the same path for 105 miles in Vermont so about half the hikers we met were Long Trail hikers. After visiting at the shelter we decided to make the cold, wet, muddy push to the Congdon Shelter which we heard was packed with hikers. The trail is really overgrown but there were some amazing feats of beaver engineering along the way. The shelter was completely packed (10 hikers including a volunteer caretaker) but they managed to make space for me to sleep on a table which was fine as I do not want to set up my tent in the pouring rain. Although Juice decided to tent. I wrang out my socks, shook water out of my shoes and crawled in my sleeping bag.","Wilbur Clearing Shelter 
",Congdon Shelter ,"May 30, Sun",17.40
Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638290,"Sleeping on the table in the shelter kept me dry during a rainy night bu Juice’s tent leaked at the seams. The volunteer who helped out at the shelter gave me an MRE (Meals ready to eat) bag which he said was peaches in syrup which would’ve gone perfectly with my oatmeal. When I opened the pouch it turned out to be spaghetti with meat sauce, which I ate mostly cold since my Jet Boil stove only boils water.  Before we left the weekend hikers gave us some stove fuel and protein bars as we were running a little short on both. Slippery rocky descent started the day and all the hikers, including me, had a couple minor slips. One stream had so much water so we had to walk through it so I took the opportunity to record a video for our two year old grandson of me going through it since he has a book that reads “we can’t go over it, we can’t go under it, I guess we have to go through it- splishy, splashy, splishy, splashy”. The sun finally lit up the forest around 4pm and it was stunning. After a long ascent arrived at the shelter and there were 3 other hikers we knew.","Congdon Shelter 
",Goddard Shelter ,"May 31, Mon",14.40
Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638411,Reluctantly put on wet hiking shoes and wet socks for the 3rd day in a row but it seemed senseless to put on dry socks which would be soaked through shortly trudging through the Vermud (Vermont term) and streams of water coming down the trails. By mid afternoon my feet were getting blisters but not to much I could do until getting to camp. I’ve seen lots of beaver ponds and beaver dams but the view of one today showed both the dam and the beaver lodge. Fun fact- We also saw beaver scat on the trail which looks a lot like deer scat but their round pellets are bigger. Red Devil and Old Army Man were both again at camp tonight.,"Goddard Shelter 
",Stratton Pond Shelter,"Jun 01, Tue",17.50
Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638413,"Heard some crazy barking/screeching animals last night (Juice thought it might have been foxes and after googling it I think that is what it was). Today we headed down to the regional vacation destination of Manchester, VT which is nestled between two mountain ranges. Stopped for lunch on Prospect Rock overlooking Manchester and arranged a shuttle in to town. Lots of “bog board” walking but still plenty of mud.  Wayne, our shuttle driver/trail angel, took us on a loop thru town to show us the Outfitters and restaurants and on to our hotel. It’s amazing how good it feels to get your laundry done and take a hot shower. Next we headed to Sam’s Pizza where one of the patrons asked us if we were hiking the AT. We asked how we knew and he said “the black fly bites on our arms and legs and the bandages on the back of our heels”.  Went shopping and bought a “second dinner” to bring back to the hotel.","Stratton Pond Shelter
",Hampton Inn,"Jun 02, Wed",10.80
Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638468,"After multiple rounds of food at the Hampton Inn breakfast bar Shuttle Driver Wayne took us back to the trail at 9. Highlight of the day was top of Bromley Mountain Ski Resort where there are 360 degree views of the area mountains that we’ve hiked (Stratton, Glastonbury, Greylock) and ones that are coming up (Styles, Pico, Killington). Styles Mountain was the big climb for the day but we kept mileage down since my feet are still recovering from multiple wet days and pinched toes due to rocks. Later in the day we started seeing huge amounts of scat (animal poop) which looked very similar to what we had been told was beaver scat, but we saw no beaver ponds and were at  pretty high elevation.  We later learned it was moose scat and if you ever get charged by a moose you run into the woods and hide behind a tree since moose aren’t very mobile and have poor eyesight. Made it to Peru Peaks Shelter before it rained and view is idyllic, a small wooden bridge with a stream with mini waterfalls. Should be nice  background noise for sleeping and perfect to look at over dinner. Adam, who we’ve hiked with before and Nick, a Long Trail Hiker were at the shelter.  Nick is doing the Long Trail as training for the 2,600 mile Pacific Crest Trail later this summer.","Hampton Inn
",Peru Peak Shelter ,"Jun 03, Thu",10
Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638539,"The combination of a metal roof on the shelter, the waterfall/stream and almost an inch of rain made for quite a background noise last night. Trails were sometimes not just muddy but flowing streams of water. The last stretch of the trail up to Baker Peak was pure slabs of steep granite so that made for slow going. Juice was reading the description of our planned destination but saw beautiful pics of Little Rock Pond 5 miles sooner so we decided why not stop early and enjoy a sunny afternoon. Sitting by the pond was like a biology lab. Dragonfly larvae were crawling out of the water on to rocks, leaving behind a dried casing, waiting till their wings opened and dried and flying away. The red eft (tiny salamanders) we see on the trail had moved to the water, with just little red spots on their dark green skin indicating their former phase of life. A Long Trail Hiker from Vermont tented at the shelter. I made several trips to sit on the rocks by the pond as it was such an amazing spot (no one else around) but never saw a moose.","Peru Peak Shelter 
",Little Rock Pond,"Jun 04, Fri",9.70
Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638666,"Had my earliest start so far as I left Shelter at 6:30am knowing we had some challenging terrain and my blisters are still bad so I’m not moving as fast. Trail continues to have lots of roots and rocks but only occasional stretches of mud. Passed by a big “rock garden” where there must have been over 50 people or gnome-built 50 sculptures (rock cairns).  Bully Brook was a raging stream and I ended up throwing my shoes across to the other side and walking barefoot instead of trying to balance on the not too thick birch logs that were in the Brook. Spent some time on Airport Lookout Rock (overlooking Rutland, VT Airport) as there was good cellphone coverage so I could update my journal. As we were there we saw a big storm cloud in the distance put it looked like it would pass north. As I walked over the bridge over Clarendon Gorge (a popular local swimming area) the rain hit for a few minutes. We then did a rocky climb up to Clarendon Shelter and I’m not sure whether my rain coat was wetter on the outside from the rain or on the inside from sweat from the climb. Because of the downpour the stream (our water supply) was very muddy but it cleared up after an hour. Birch (the Long Trail Hiker) built a fire and five thru hikers tented here. This was the first shelter without a metal bear box so we had to hang our food from branches. The one thru hiker had a sketchbook and she had done some amazing drawings from her time on the AT.","Little Rock Pond
",Clarendon Shelter ,"Jun 05, Sat",13.60
Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638670,"Completed my section hike!
Started early again as we knew we were going over Killington Mountain (a 4K peak and 2nd tallest mountain in Vermont) but of course we were passed by the twenty-something hikers who didn’t leave camp until at least an hour after us when we took a break at the first shelter. About 8:30AM I looked up and could see Killington looming in the distance and we started the ascent. Once we got to the shelter at Killington we did a .2 mile rock climb up (the rocks at my feet in the photo above were the path up to the view)and the view was absolutely worth it. I’ll try to post a video as a single photo doesn’t do it justice. Note: I’ll also post more photos in the next day or so. 


Ended my hike at the perfect place- The Inn at Long Trail! Includes everything hikers appreciate including an Irish Pub with excellent food and Long Trail Ale. 
Two other hikers that we knew joined us at the pub for dinner and later we all did the “hiker hobble” using the railings on the stairs to get up to our rooms!


I’ll do a post-hike entry tomorrow but thank you for sharing my adventure by reading my journal and your comments in the Guest Book. 


By the numbers… 
This hike: 243 miles, 53K’ vertical ascent, 51K descent
Cumulative miles: 1,114 miles from Bland, Virginia in 4 section hikes (2014, 2015, 2020, 2021)","Clarendon Shelter 
","The Inn at Long Trail (Killington, Vermont)","Jun 06, Sun",17
Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638740,"Relaxing in the lobby of the Inn at Long Trail in Killington with its old time birch/pine mountain decor catching up on a few things before our friends Al & Cathy and my wife pick me up this afternoon and we head to Maine for a weeklong vacation. (I’m loading more photos and videos this afternoon. Video from Killington Mountain at bottom of this page) Had nice breakfast with Juice and Koivu (Means “birch tree” in Finnish). The Long Trail and Appalachian Trail are the same trail up to this point in Vermont but now Koivu heads north on the Long Trail to the Canadian border and Juice heads east towards New Hampshire and Maine. 


Had a chance to meet Punisher who is working on a “Triple Crown Plus” hike. A Triple Crown consists of hiking the Pacific Crest Trail (2,600 miles), Continental Divide Trail (3,100 miles from Montana to New Mexico) and the Appalachian Trail (2,200 miles). PLUS he hiked from Key West, Florida to Springer Mountain, Georgia (the Southern Terminus of the AT). As you can see from the photo above Punisher is an ultralight hiker. The base weight of his pack (without food in water is 9 lbs; my base weight is 19 lbs!). 
It’s always difficult to summarize a section hike. This one was probably more challenging than others..I fell down more (but never hurt myself) due to slippery rocks, mud and roots, never took a “zero” (full day off from hiking) and endured some cold and wet weather but I look at it as a boot camp for body and soul. I feel in really good physical shape, spent almost 3 weeks outside in nature and each day my only goals involved water, food, shelter and enjoying myself. Each day I met really interesting and nice people from all over the country and learned about their hike and their lives. Of course meeting Juice just a few days into my hike was my most fortunate moment. Having someone to hike with when the conditions are tough makes it easier but also hiking with someone who is in agreement when you cut your hiking day a little short when you find a beautiful lake or unique shelter to stop. As another saying goes “it’s not the miles, it’s the smiles”. This trip had plenty of both! Thanks to the Trail Angels, Appalachian Trail Conservancy & their volunteers and to the Green Mountain Club for all they do to enable long distance hiking. Thank you to my wife and family for supporting me in this adventure and thank you for reading my journal!",,View Entry,"Jun 08, Tue",0
