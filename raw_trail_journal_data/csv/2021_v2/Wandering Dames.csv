Wandering Dames,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633383,"So we decided to start the AT hike via day hikes. Our original plan was to start training and then officially start on 3/19. After Suzanne's mom's memorial.
Last year when we were training, we started to get discouraged by hiking so many uncounted wasted miles. While this year is TOTALLY different and we can't start the hike yet, due to the admin stuff for Suzanne's Mom's estate, we are starting and doing a few day hikes each week. Since we live so close to the trail,  we wanted to make our training miles count this year!
Our hike up to Springer Summit was a chilly one. When we got to the summit, we had it all to yourself. We were able to put some of Suzanne's mom's ashes on a pine cone and left it in a tree so she could keep track of everyone coming and going. Suz's plan is to carry a small vessel of her mom's ashes, and release  them at Katahdin when we summit. We will need her and all our elders guidance for this long journey!",,Springer Mnt Parking Lot,"Jan 06, Wed",1
Wandering Dames,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633385,"We grabbed Simon and drove 30 minutes down forest service road 58 to the Three Forks area. Usually this area is packed with cars but not as much on cold January day.
Turns out to be a 6.6 mile day as we hike from Three Forks south to Springer Mountain parking lot. What a great day. We didn't realize how much snow was on the ground at higher elevation. 
As we climbed higher the snow kept getting deeper! It made this 6.6 mile hike from 3 Forks, to springer Mountain parking, and back to 3 Forks truly mystical. Everything so quite and pure as all our breaths become a misty cloud from the 29 degree temps!",,Three Forks,"Jan 09, Sat",4.30
Wandering Dames,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633386,"Hiked from Three Forks to mile 7 on AT. Again, we had the trail to ourselves. Starting out at Three Forks, there was a little snow on the ground. By the time we got to Hickory Flats Cemetery, everything was covered in snow. Very pretty. Temp was 31 degrees. When we were hiking back to Three Forks, an Army ranger snuck up on us and scared the bageezies out of Suzanne 😃!
We had lite packs, gear working well, but still need to figure out our glove system. Hands still getting cold in colder weather.",,"Mile 7,","Jan 12, Tue",7
Wandering Dames,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633387,"Today we parked at Hightower Gap, hiked south to Mile Marker 7, then back through Hightower gap another mile up to to mile 9.5. Yes, a bit of out and back on both sides of our starting place today, but touching every mark on the trail. When hiking south to mile marker 7, we were looking for the line across the trail and snow we had left 2 days before. The weather was warmer, but not all the snow had melted, so we could still see our line in the snow and on the trail. We hiked past Hawk Mnt Camping and Shelter, both excellent camping locations. Another day of Blue Sky's and great views. Today we were also lucky to have Buckeyes to snack on thanks to our sister-in-law. Yummy!",,Mile 9.5,"Jan 14, Thu",2.50
Wandering Dames,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633388,"Today was a cold hike, but we got to Hike with Jen and Lucky. We met up with them and drove to Cooper Gap together. This was one of Jen's first hikes on the AT. Snow was gently coming down, hands still get cold, even though we had our mittens on. Still not prepared for rain and cold, need to figure that issue out still. We hiked back to mile 9.5, then came back north. This required us to go over Sassafras twice. Very challenging summit 3,347' high. Cindy prepared hot mocha for us to share at the top.  Great day with friends.",,12.1,"Jan 16, Sat",12.10
Wandering Dames,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633390,"Great day to hike, Simon, Suzanne and I started at about 11:30. We drove out to Gooch Gap, dropped the Explorer Off, then drove south to Cooper Gap to drop the Jeep off and started our hike north. For some reason the Garmin didn't start tracking from the start, we restarted it at lunch and it began tracking correctly. Not sure what the issue was there, a learning curve probably. Temp in low 40's but wind was blowing and we were cold. The sky was blue and after we got on the other side of the Mnt, it warmed up. By the time we ended the hike, we had taken our rain jackets off and just had 2 layers on. Saw 4 other groups out on the trail, all day hikers, one other person with a pack, but he was day hiking also. Halfway through the hike we stopped for a quick snack. SImon had his snack's also, but he says more is better. We hiked past Gooch Shelter, which was kinda cool. Last year, we stayed the night there and there must have been 50+ hikers, far cry from the peacefulness of today's hike.",,Gooch Gap,"Jan 18, Mon",4.80
Wandering Dames,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633391,"We hike south today. Very foggy, but eventually burned off. Suzanne tried her new Altra hiking shoes for the first time. Seemed to do good. Only saw one other person on the trail going North. Great local hike for novice hiker. We had tea at the top of Ramrock Mountain. No view today due to fog.",,Woody Gap,"Jan 21, Thu",20.60
Wandering Dames,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633393,"We had a great hike. 37 degrees outside, but boy that wind! Jen and Lucky were with us. We found this weird side trail about 200 yards off the AT where we could leave our car. We hiked North heading towards Blood Mnt. Didn't realize that it is a 4.2 mile hike 2 Blood Mnt, 1 mile up, then 1 mile down. Saw some familiar sights from last years trip. The weather was clear at the top of the mnt. We had lunch in the shelter. I made chicken soup, Jen made granola, Suzanne brought a Reese's Peanut Butter cup. There was ice on the ground just before we came to the summit. Honestly speaking (or writing) we were nervous on the ice. On the other side of the summit it was clear and dry. Doggies did great! Made it down the Mnt with only 1 fall between the 3 of us. Blood Mnt, is officially behind us.",,Neels Gap,"Jan 22, Fri",31.30

Wandering Dames,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633397,"Started from Neels gap at about 9:15 AM. We had left the Jeep at Hog Pen on Sunday. As we get further away from our cabin the logistics of dropping off our vehicles become more challenging! 
Our morning out of Neels was crystal clear with not a cloud in the sky! Winter hiking has its perks as the views are more plentiful without all the leaves on the trees yet. Quickly, within a mile climb we stopped to shed our layers and as the day went on we even removed the bottom half our hiking pants..Yay! The vista's were endless, as far as the eye could see. Simon just loves the trail and is ALWAYS the pack leader! Circling back to make sure is pack is in tack as I huff and puff up the mountain! We ended the hike at Hog Pen and let me tell you that straight climb out of Tesnatee Gap pushes your heart, lungs, and legs to the maximum and lets you know you're ALIVE!!!",,Hog Pen,"Jan 26, Tue",38.20
Wandering Dames,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633425,"33 degrees out, but the wind was just a blowing. We had a really hard climb up, but the views were worth it and the sky was blue.",,Tray Mnt Road,"Jan 28, Thu",0
Wandering Dames,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633435,"This was a hard section! We had Simon with us, he just loves being in the woods. The climb out of Winding Stair gap is a long assent. We did have Tea at the top with a southern view of the mountains. After that though we were on the northern side of the mountain where the cold picked up. We went past Siler Bald, didn't go up, but saw it from a distance. There is snow on this side of the mountain. Keep walking a bit and then we got into a lot more slow. Probably 6"" in some places. Very pretty. About a mile from the end, the trail was descending and there were several streams we had to cross over. The hard part was the stream was frozen solid, so we had to go above or below it so that we didn't fall on the ice. Suzanne actually got on her hands and knees at one point. Thank goodness we have ice crampons being delivered. We can put those on our shoes to help with the ice.",,Wayah Crest,"Feb 02, Tue",5.80
Wandering Dames,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633436,"Today we hiked South from Burning Town Gap to Wayah Crest. We did run into a thru hiker named Scooter. He has an instagram called Scooter Hikes. The ice was not that bad today, but still snow on the ground. We saw Scooters footprint in the snow. He has some BIG feet, compared to our little feet. Kinda funny how our whole shoe fits in his foot print with plenty of room to spare. We had Tea at Wayah Shelter, no one was there. This was where we spent our last night on the trail last year. As we continued our hike south, we went over Wayah Summit. This time there was a GREAT view. On the way down we were tracking some folks. Didn't know who, but saw the footprints in the snow. Looked like they had a small child with them based on the shoe size. That would be an 8 mile hike for a little kid. After further discussion we determined that it was probably doggy shoe prints, not a child's. This was confirmed as the further we did go down, we then saw paw prints.",,Burning Town Gap,"Feb 03, Wed",8.80
Wandering Dames,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633434,"Short hike today, only 4 miles. We hiked past the section where last year some guy stole our Bear Line. That freaked us out and we hurried off the mountain and got a ride into Franklin. We didn't see anyone all day, it was sunny and clear, but the wind was howling. Getting this hike under our belts has us feeling good. We are tired of making the drive out here each day to get the hikes in. After today, we can circle back closer to the cabin to get other sections done.",,Winding Stair Gap,"Feb 05, Fri",3.70
Wandering Dames,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633420,"Woke up this morning with excitement in the air, the cold air. Today is our first overnight hike of the season. There are a bit of nerves within us. The weather is 29 now, today should be good, but rain tonight. We didn't start our hike until Noon, with only 7 miles planned, we didn't want to get here too early. Mostly ridge running with a few climbs. Passed some day hikers coming out of HogPen. Passed ""Justin "" a solo hiker who was going to stop at Low Gap. He seemed like he was struggling a bit, but he is out here. From Low Gap to our campsite, we seemed to follow an old overgrown road. 3 feet of it was clear for the AT Trail, but the rest was overgrown. Maybe old forest road, I prefer the possibility of old Moonshines road. Took several times to get the bear line up, but Suz did it!  Had a great fire, Simon is sound asleep in the tent. Time to join him, good night.",,45.5,"Feb 21, Sun",45.50
Wandering Dames,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633422,"Didn't sleep great, but we both expected it. Did hear an Owl, just after dusk, always cool to hear that. The wind was howling and made us cold, rain came in at Midnight which was earlier than the forecast of 4AM. We were both awake enough to take notice in the changing forecast and wondered what that meant for the rest of the morning. Our elevation was about 3400'. It did rain off and on thru the night and sometimes a bit heavy. There was a break about 4:30 in the morning, which is our normal waking time, so Simon and Suzanne went out for a bio break and grabbed the bear bag to bring it in. We were both able to go back to sleep till 7. We keep Simon wrapped in his own down sleeping blanket, so he was very comfortable. I started breakfast at 7:30 in a light drizzle, the rain stopped about 8:30 and we were able to pack up and break the tent down before it picked back up again. At mile marker 48.5, the trail turned to rocks, and it stayed that way for the rest of the day. We were rock hopping in the rain. We took a 20 min break at Blue Mnt Shelter to eat some snacks and rest. The rocks are challenging. A few other hikers came in to do the same. Several of them talked about taking a ride into town to dry off. The rain stopped about 12PM, and we hiked out about 1PM. Everyone was tired and hungry, but we got another section DONE!!",,Unicoi ,"Feb 22, Mon",7.30
Wandering Dames,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633429,"Ouch! Long day, especially over Tray Mnt and Kelly Knob. We got an early start, on the trail at 9:22 after an hour drive to the trailhead and Tray Mnt Road. The weather was perfect, Blue skies, moderate temps, we were thrilled with the forecast for such a challenging day ahead of us, 13+miles. The hike up Tray Mnt (4430')was not bad, and we were happy to get that behind us early in the hike. Lots of great vista views. In 2020 it was pouring down rain and we didn't see anything. At about 1pm, 6 miles into the hike, we pulled over for lunch. During the whole hike, we didn't see very many people. 1 AT Volunteer heading south, 1 Sobo, and 1 Sobo Trail runner. After lunch we still had several climbs including Kelly Knob (4126') which kicked out butt. 1 mile up at 1000' elevation change. Slowed us down to 1mph. Twice during the day we had a few Blue Bird Chaperones which were guiding us down the trail. Nice to see a little color, and some new wild life.",,Dick's Creek,"Feb 24, Wed",13.30
Wandering Dames,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633437,"Our longest drive yet in trying to get to a trailhead and get a section under our belt. We are learning more each day in better ways to get the hikes and the drives in. We decided to drive out to the furthest place we think we will get to before we start daily and overnight sections. This way we are driving a little bit less each time and not backtracking as much. We did have a pretty, but very long drive today. Went on Wayah Road for the first time. Very pretty area and beautiful lake, certainly a place to come back and visit. When we finally got to actually hiking, I was a bit ornery, as I think Google Maps took us a much longer way. The driving and logistics got on my nerves, and I just wanted to get out of the car and start walking already. The temp was 36 degrees, but we warmed up quickly, as we hiked strait up. We remembered this section from our 2020 attempt. This was the last day we were on the trail and had to hike 15 miles to catch a shuttle driver. Today it was blue sky's and we saw very few people on the trail. We did see Cypress and Fern, they are part of a larger group also thru hiking. We didn't stop for lunch today because it was such a long drive there and we knew it would be a long drive home. Overall, a great hiking day. We left the Jeep at Wayah Crest, mile 109.4 and will pick it up on our next hike from Winding Stair Gap.",,Tellico Gap,"Mar 01, Mon",128.80

Wandering Dames,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633431,"Today was our third day on the trail and thus far our longest day. After a long restful night of about 10 hours of sleep, yes its very common to get that much sleep because you're so exhausted when you get to camp. You gather water, set your tent up, cook your dinner, clean up and then get horizontal! Let just say thats one of the best feelings after a long hard day of hiking!At around 830 this morning we summitted Standing Indian. The mountain peaks were like little islands as they poked thru the clouds. 
It was a balmy 60 something degree March 13 weekend which explains the encounter of several South bound hikers. We learned there's a nice 24 mile loop that starts at Long branch trial via Standing Indian campground. That connects you to the A.T. then you take the Kimsey trail out of deep gap back to Standing Indian Campground. Super cool for weekend getaway in the mountains! Not to mention you get ice cream at the top of Standing Indian to help enjoy those outstanding views!!",,Deep Gap,"Mar 12, Fri",9.10
Wandering Dames,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633432,"It was not a great night for sleep. We found a nice spot under Mountain Laurels, we knew rain was coming for the night and thought this would help protect us, and it did. But unfortunately, it was on a downward slant so we keep sliding downward through the night and having to adjust our bags back up. Rained off an on, not too bad, just enough to get everything wet. The time changed this night, so we lost an hour of sleep. We hit the trail at 8:15ish The hike up to Albert Mountain was not too bad, the rocks and roots were wet, so we took our time. There really was not much of a view as the clouds were still low, and the sun had not burned them off. We had 4 young hikers pass us during the day, they also spent the night at Betty Gap. So far, most of the hikers we have seen have been young, early 20's and even an 18. year old. We were both tired as we trekked into Rock Gap about an hour earlier than planned. While waiting an older gentleman pulled up in his beat up older model van. The gentleman got out of the van, offered us some beers and snacks, we politely declined as we really did just finished off all our snacks. He is a local and bent our ear back as he drank from his Red Solo Cup. Just a lonely man who wanted to get out of the house, drove down to the trailhead seeking company of others. With finishing this section up, we have connected all the sections from Springer to Tellico Gap. We will start the rest of our hike on Friday.

Wandering Dames,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633433,"As you slowly approach Albert Mt. you wander along the edge of a mountain. You can reach out and touch the seeping cliff walls as you climb up rocks and thru Mt. Laurel. It has a kind of sub tropical feel and it reminds me of Hawaii and the mountains on Maui!
The rock scramble climb to the top of Albert mountain gets the adrenaline pumping its literally hand over fist with a fridge on your back but then if your lucky and not socked in with clouds the views leave you more breathless and that's how you achieve your first 100 miles on the north bound trail!",,Rock Gap,"Mar 14, Sun",8.50

Wandering Dames,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633512,"And we're off..
 Nerves were high and bellies were upset this morning as we checked off items to do before we close the door on our cabin for 6 months. After doing two months of on and off day hiking and a few overnights on the trail we believe we have our gear dialed in, how much food we will need, setting up and breaking down camp, throwing a bear line, fetching water, sleeping in uncomfortable position, sleepless nights... I could go on but nothing prepares you for what you wil need mentally. I like to remind myself that it's getting comfortable with the uncomfortable. 
Gratefully,  we had Louann and Noelle pick us up and drive us to Tellico Gap. They help calm our nerves while they hiked a couple miles up the trail with us. We said our farewells at Wesser shelter and Suz and I headed north. Ironically, this was the last section that we hiked last year before we got off the trail due to covid. It was pouring down rain last year as we raced down the mountain to the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC) to get a shuttle home. An upsetting and emotional end to our attempt last year! So it's only fitting that we're starting where we left off, kind like righting a wrong.

Thank goodness because we had to climb 7 miles out of NOC a 2600 ascend!! Suz with her brilliant strategic mind broke the hike up into 3rds and we took breaks upon each one. The views were amazingly spectacular and seem to be mother nature's way of telling us to just keep going, there's another view even better up over that ridge. Often,  in the faint distance I could hear the Great Smoky rail road train blowing its whistle. Another encouraging sign we're fast approaching those majestic and awe inspiring mountains!

Wandering Dames,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633593,"Our home for the night was perched on a beautiful grassy ridge above Sassafras gap shelter. Great dinner views but not so good when the wind picks up! Suz and I layered up and crawled into our 30° down sleeping bags. We also have a liner that adds additional warmth to your bag and it certainly helps! Suz puts these red down booties on her feet for extra warmth and I can't help but laugh cause she looks like a little elf, yup I'm sleeping next to elfin magic, lucky me😄We woke to blustery winds and heavy cloud cover so thick it was like rain. I retrieved the bear line and food and hurried back to our tent. My paws were freezing but these little pouches called hot hands quickly took the edge off. We made coffee and breakfast under the vestibule. Kinda like breakfast in bed but tent instead! Slowly, we broke camp and headed up to Cheoh Bald. Unfortunately,  there were no views, too socked in with cloud cover.Onward we trekked. A few hikers that stayed at the shelter last night passed us. One was a solo hiker named Bonanza jellybean(trail name) She had a very calming presence about her and even played her ukulele last night. So soothing to here deep in the forest. It lulled me to sleep.So Suz and I decided to renamed her to Namaste she just doesn't know it yet, ha! If anyone knows us well, knows we love nick names! Luckily for us as we switched back our way down into stecoah gap road crossing there it was, trail magic, our 1st one! Trail magic is where generous people set up a little station, sometimes under a tent, sometimes out of there vehicle, or wherever. They prepare some wonderful treats for us hungry hikers. Out of pure generosity and kindness! Could you imagine if we would do this out in the real world ...🤔 Perfect harmony, you know ""I like to teach the world to sing"" stuff! Anyways,  back to reality. This trail magic was in honor of a fellow hiker that unfortunately went missing last year on the approach trail. His trail name was Noon. They found his body by a waterfall. Not sure of all the details but none the less a tragic story. We remember when he went missing as it was close to our cabin, we even signed up to volunteer to search for him.

Wandering Dames,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633781,"We were deep in hollow down from the shelter last night. About 2 tenths of a mile off trail. Had a fire and we were close to a creek, all the comfort you need in the woods!🙂Something funny happened as we exited the side trail from the shelter this morning, I wanted to go left but Suz was going right. Of course she was correct or we would have been going SOUTH,  back the way we came!A reminder that no matter how tired you are when crawling into camp you need to pay attention. A lesson learned today!
Quickly,  we were joined with two other hikers...our shadows! The sun was shining out the gate and remained until dusk. Shorts and t-shirt were the comfortable attire for me and Suz put her Sir Edmund Hilary hat on. It's a ball cap that has side attachments to shade the sides of her face. She hates wearing it but when I'm in the back, which is more often then not🙂 I enjoy watching as the  winds blow, the sides puff up as she intently treks in time with her hiking sticks. It's like we're on a exploration to find a lost pyramid somewhere in Egypt...your mind goes a lot of places when your hiking miles and hours on end! Without the shade from the forest canopy, we were actually hot in some sections! Completely different from last year. We had two weeks of rain almost everyday! I kept reminding myself and Suz that we have to remember these sunny days for when we're trudging thru a creek of water up a mountain. Oh, and that creek often will be the trail!!This section from the NOC to Fontana Dam has proven quiet challenging. The climbs have been extremely steep and often without switch backs and since we don't have our trail legs yet, it makes it more difficult and humbling! It's a prelude to the Smokey's and explains why my left knee and both our right achilles are tender.  We were passed by a handful of hikers today, Detox, Frogman, A chick hurrying so fast that I said she was must be late for the bus at Fontana..lol, The original Auqa man, and Light house. He's hiking home to Maine..super nice guy!

A small gap with room for one tent maybe two and no water!  So we trudged on down the trail to a footbridge crossing a creek and found a flat enough spot to sprawl out our z-pack triplex tent. More tired today, we propped ourselves up against a tree and rested a bit before we set up the tent when all of a sudden a loud SNAP and CRASH happened!! Mind you no one was here but us and the day was calm and sunny.... behind us was a enormous old rotting tree that decided right then and there to drop one of her large limbs to the ground..THUMP! There it lands, forever on the forest floor to decompose. I'm sure everyone has heard that saying..""If a tree falls in the forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?"" And we can say, ""why yes does!"" It may not have been the whole tree but none the less it was a powerful moment in the woods that moved us!The cresent moon was illuminating brightly thru our tent, and I wished there was a string attached that I could pull to darken the night!!We woke with excitement, it was going to town day with only 2.4 miles ahead of us. Our packs and steps were light and the sun was shining  as we could see Fontana lake and Dam to the left of us. We continued to meandered down the trail when there went a  blurr of gray across the trail and at first I thought it was a raccoon but then we realized it was a Bobcat!! Small in size, perhaps a juvenile but none the less a BOBCAT! Suz whipped out her phone and started to video while I watched in awe of how she methodically moved along the forest floor. Searching and hunting! Amazingly, she wasn't fazed by us at all, probably more annoyed then anything! Later we found out that it's rare to see a Bobcat in the wild! Truly grateful to have witnessed God's creature in the elements!
Before you know it we were at the Fontana Marina where we met Dave, he runs the store at the Marina.. He's a super super nice guy and  so informative about the history of Lake Fontana and the Dam! We had no idea that there is over 900 miles of trails in the Smokey's and how quickly the Dam was built for WW2 efforts! The Marina is a great resupply spot for all your needs before you head into the Smokey's.

Tom ""High Loon"" is hiking the A.T. this year as well and he'll get back on the trail in June, perhaps we'll see him again down the trail! The clouds were low, the mist blanketed Lake Fontana, and the pre dawn sun was peaking over the mountain tops as we walked over the Dam towards the Smokey's! It was a mystical and surreal introduction towards the southern terminus trail head and our emotions were hard to contain!  We past the permit box feeling super rested and our packs were considerably comfortable even though we were loaded with 5 days of resupply. We rode that adrenaline and excitement all the way to Russell field shelter our longest  day. It was a perfect day to hike, sun high and slight breeze. We even took a side trail to the top of  Shuckstack fire tower. Let's just say WOW! My vocabulary cannot do it justice! If the day is right,I highly recommend because you can climb all the way to the top, that is if your knees will let you!Once we got to Russell field shelter we were greeted by a ridge runner name Ricky. He informed us that the shelter was reserved for a large group and that we'd have to tent if they showed up. No problem for us as we are trying to stay away from shelter sleeping due to covid! The shelter was packed with hikers everywhere! It was like a party deep in the middle of the forest and we were fortunate to get a nice tent site tucked away from all the commotion. Next couple of days calls for high winds and rain...stay tuned!","Fontana Visitors center

Wandering Dames,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634131,"Crawled out of our tent with all our rain gear on and hit the trail behind everyone else. Rain, high winds, and storms are in the forecast for today and tomorrow...Ugh! There is a saying that many thru hikers say, it's kinda like a mantra..""No rain, No pain, No Maine""! Today was  incredibly tough and I think we underestimated what was in store for us.  The first day of the Smokey's was a gradual climb and often with switch backs to ease the steep terrain. Well, today the climbs were high and traversed grassy balds. It was beautiful even with wind gust and thunder off in the distance. One of my fears is lightning and that was constantly on my mind as we kept climbing higher and higher. We ran into a hiker yesterday and he told us about his experience during the severe storm that came in on Wednesday. He was on one of the balds and a gust of around 50mph knocked him right off his feet and to the ground. He got himself up and then a big bolt of lightning struck near him. Luckily, he was able to get off the trail at a shelter that was near by! He was fortunate that a shelter was close by. Sometimes they can be several miles  apart and when you're deep in the forest during an electrical storm you quickly find your religion! We were about 1.7 miles from our shelter for the night when the sky's opened up, the wind whipped, the trees bent and quickly the rocky trail became a flowing creek bed! Hard to have a quick pace in those conditions. We even experience some slight hail as we got into the crowed shelter where everyone was head to toe soaked! The rain let up a bit so we pitched our tent and really secured the stakes and tighten the lines as we were in for a long nite of howling winds and rain, a good way to test our new tent!","Russell field shelter

Wandering Dames,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634168,"So where to begin... at Derrick Knob  Shelter we were the first to put our tent up in the rain.  Honestly, we thought we would be the only ones to tent but as the evening went on more and more soaking wet hikers stumbled into the shelter which was at full capacity. The winds blew so forcefully thru our tent all night and with each gust the tent snapped!Oddly, we were comforted knowing that others were experiencing the same conditions.One thing you quickly learn before you set the tent up  is to look above your set up area for any dead branches or widow makers they're often called as last night proved to be a perfect scenario for them to crash down and make for a really bad night. I was up early and retrieved the food bag from the cables. In the Smokies each shelter provides cables that have a pulley system to hang your food. While we have yet to see bears (may be too early in the season) they often visit shelters and if they become a nuisance the rangers will close the shelter, track the bear, tranquilize it, and relocate it to somewhere else...I think its called Bearville..😋 The rangers don't mess around with aggressive bears! We got ourselves packed up and on the trail in the rain. There was another couple in front of us and  soon they were out of sight. No one else passed us the rest of the day and for good reason..its was a monsoon kind of day. We slushed thru ankle deep  water at times while trying to keep our footing. It was going to be a long dreadful hike. All our rain gear didn't help as everything was cold and sopping wet! Lightning flashed and under our breaths we would count, one one-thousanths, two one-thousanths,..We've experienced rain on the trail but NEVER like this and we soon had to except our current situation ...THIS SUCKS! I must have fell three times and I think Suz did a couple times as well. I felt like a turtle that had landed on his back, I couldn't get up until Suz grabbed my shoulder strap and heaved me up right. Finally, we saw Double Springs Shelter in the distant rain fog! It was kinda early for us to stop hiking but the next shelter was too far for us tired ass Dames! Luckily for us the rain stopped and we found a level spot under a tall pine. We were freezing as we pitched our tent! Suz retrieved the water and then we quickly removed our drenched clothes and boots. Hurriedly put on our dried clothes and wool socks and then jumped into our sleeping bags to try and warm up.  My feet felt like a foot on a corpse in the morgue, only thing missing was a toe tag..lol!","Derrick knob shelter

Wandering Dames,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634188,"So whatever wind we encounter yesterday was trumped by the events of  last night! We were situated on a ridge next to a water source and the elevation was 5500ft. In my minds eye I pictured the winds coming up from the valley below and colliding with the wind from another mountain valley. Much like the colors and movement in Vincent Van Gogh's ""Starry Night"" and this went on ALL night long. Eventually the night was clear and the moon was stunningly bright in our tissue paper thin triplex.. When we woke everything that was wet now was frozen. Boots, socks, underwear, buffs, water,  you name it!  Sleep was elusive, as I was truly worried that the tent was going to collapse last night. I used hot hands while massaging my feet to warm them up. Hard to sleep with cold feet! Being exposed to the elements deep in the forest was somewhat exhilarating I must admit. When I do sleep it's deep, exhaustive, and often vividly strange with imaginary dreams. Suzanne has said the same. Odd!The morning sun and blue sky's helped thaw our physical and mental state and soon we were on our way to the highest point on the Appalachian trail, Clingsman Dome as well as reaching the 200 mile mark on the trail! Two big carrots to make up for the last two lousy, miserable, days! The hike towards Clingsman Dome is thru a thick mystical pine forest. Any log that fell or rocks on the forest floor was covered in lush vibrant green moss and on this day the suns rays peered passed the pine needles and illuminate the forest! Amazingly, it felt like an exclusive show by Mother nature and we were blessed to be the only ones hiking through this mysterious and tranquil utopia.Clingsman Dome was quiet with only a handful of people. We took in the miles and miles of Vista's and then moved on towards Mt.Collins Shelter. We traversed the half a mile side trail and when we arrived, the Shelter sat completely empty. No one was there and we felt a bit uneasy so we pressed on another 4.5 miles to Newfound Gap. Where we were greeted with an enormous amount of people(Spring Break) all there to see the sunset and to take in the Smokies! We were overwhelmed with the stimulation and even more so when we arrived at Gatlinburg for our resupply! Yuck 🤮!

Wandering Dames,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634536,"We couldn't wait any longer in Gatlinburg. You see we never wanted to be in Gatlinburg in the first place but finding a reasonable shuttle to Cherokee was impossible. Our original plan was for a zero day but looking at the forecast we quickly changed our mind and realized that we'd have to take a couple zero days!  I think it was harder to stay in the Gatlinburg motel then hike the Smokey's 🙂Julie ""Stripper"" former thru hiker picked us up at 8 on Friday morning and we were on the trail by 830. It was blustery morning as we headed out of Newfound Gap, temps in the teens with wind chills freezing our nose hairs! Trekking uphill and along side of the mountain we   were immediately challenged with thick ice on the trial! Neither one of us wanted to stop because we were freezing but we realized that the ice was going to be today's nemesis so we dropped our packs and put our crampons over our boots. (It's like chains on a tire) Wise decision by the Dames! We're so happy to have this piece of gear  and today it proved that its worth its weight in gold! We hiked the rest of the day in them as everything on the trail was covered in ice. The conditions proved to be our toughest challenge on the trail thus far! It required ALL of our attention and concentration because one slip could land you down the mountain side in some areas, or with a cracked head, or, I think you get the picture. We passed a hiker heading back towards Newfound Gap because he had rolled his ankle pretty severely. We ask him if he needed emergency attention but he thought he could make it. His hiking buddy was carrying his pack back down the mountain along with his own🥺 We hoped and prayed he made it back safely and got the needed medical attention. We were pretty exhausted when we arrived at Pecks corner Knob Shelter. With fridged temps in the forecast we decided to stay in the shelter. With a fire going in the fireplace, body heat from 10 other hikers, and wearing ALL the clothes you have to bed, westayed mostly warm considering how low the temps dipped! 
We both agreed that today was super difficult but super beautiful at the same time. We can actually say we've walked in a frozen crystallized forest and it was truly AMAZING!","Newfound Gap

Wandering Dames,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634538,"This shelter slept 14 but there were only 10 of us. We chose the top bunk which is only about 6ft off the ground and provided more head room. There's no privacy and for me I don't sleep well in those conditions but we were more protected from the elements then in our tent.The low teen morning made everyone stay in there cozy bags a little longer as we were the first to stir. Actually, the hard wooden bunks were the reason we got up. Are bodies were aching from the long uncomfortable night, we had to get vertical! Slowly we got ourselves breakfast and packed up and in-between we kept warming our hands with Hot Hands! We trekked out of camp like a couple of old ladies because our feet were frozen. About a mile into it we warmed up as the Sun was casting her rays! Once again the trail was covered in ice. Thick and slick in some areas but it was melting thank goodness! We stopped for a break at  Tri knob shelter and then pressed on. We passed a very pleasant trail runner and she told us that we'll come across a helicopter landing spot on top of the next mountain. Guess it's for emergency reasons, scary thought! The day was long and hard but the views were outstanding, the sky's were vibrant blue and the sun was so encouraging as we made our way to Cosby knob Shelter. Suz pulled a way from me to try and beat the bubble of folks behind us going to the same shelter. The rangers told us of couple nice level tent spots and we wanted to make sure to secure one. Suz greeted me at the trail for the shelter. The shelter was perched on a cleared  mountain side facing East with a perfectly piped spring on the southern side. We set up our tent towards the East tucked in and hugged by Rhododendrons. Extremely exhausted we divided our chores. Suz prep our mattresses and sleeping bag, I collected water and filtered for dinner. I started the stove and realized we were out of fuel...ugh!

I was awake early and writing in my journal when I peaked out of our tent's vestibule to see a glorious dawn over the mountains ridge! Easter Sunrise in the Smokey's, so stunningly beautiful! I woke Suz and we both watched as the Sun peaked over the treeline. I took a moment to reflect on all the many Easter Sunrises I had with my folks and I know they'd be touched by this one! Feeling the warmth of the sun as we packed we became energized knowing that this was our last day in the Smokey's! I think we were more excited to exit the Smokey's then when we entered! Actually, I know so. Still touching the clouds we had a long and rocky descent thru the now slush and muck. Finally everything was rapidly thawing. Even us, ironically! As we hopscotched down and across the rocks we finally switched back our way to a softer trail . ...ahh our feet thanked us! We passed several day hikers going up to the fire tower which we skipped because it was over a mile off the trail. When suddenly,  on the left, there it was, the last shelter, Davenport and just like that the Smokey's spit us out the northern end! We literally felt like a pinball at times! We fricken made it! Another milestone behind us and a notch on our backpack strap😉 We're still very grounded but we certainly gained, really earned more confidence! After we deposited the second half of our permit slips we were treated with trail magic by a nice gentleman named Ed. He had beer, sodas, fruit and more. We grabbed a few things, chatted a bit, and then off we went towards Standing Bear. This is a strange and squirrelly section of the trail as you hike under enormous power lines, past pigeon river, and then road walking under the I40 over pass then back into the forest until you cross a creek to a gravel road then take a hard left towards Standing Bear Hostel...a place that time forgot.

It was super nice because we separated ourselves from the peace, love, and hemp life that normally happens at SBHThat evening we had another hiker tent next to us,  her trail name is Indigo. She just did 20 miles to get out of the Smokey's oh and I forgot to mention shes 72 years young! Suz and I were truly impressed with her capabilities. Although she is modest I couldn't wait till morning to ask her what her secret to longevity is. This trail is incredibly challenging and difficult and makes even the most athletic person humbled. That is part of th the many allures of the A.T.We woke early to the sound of a cow bell letting us know that breakfast was ready and we were too! We got our bellys full and made a plan with Indigo to do 10 miles to a stealth spot. Today we hike four miles up to Snow Bird mountain and boy was it difficult! Saving grace was that is was a blue sky as far as the eye can see kinda day. Good weather makes everything better! At the top of Snow Bird there's a unique FAA building and boy does it have some breathing taking 360 views. We stopped and had a bite and then we meandered down to our home for the night at Brown Gap Springs stealth Site. Indigo was waiting for us. Water source was good too.

Today we were headed to Max patch, a beautiful 360° bald that Suz, Simon and I have actually camped on top of a couple of years ago. Originally the bald was a cow pasture and what a beautiful place to graze, happy cows for sure! When we stayed the weather was ideal and we were thrilled to have experienced an incredible sunset, a zillion stars, and then had coffee  as we watched the early morning mountain mist slowly raise from the valleys below lifting the curtain for dawns dramatic show. This time we ascended at the top of Max Patch on a exceptionally warm and brilliantly sunny spring afternoon. You could see vista's for miles and as we turned and faced the southwest, there in the distance was the Smokey mountain range!! We stode there for a moment and reflected on everything we experienced, from the misty morning walk over Fontana Dam, toclimbing Shuckstack fire tower on a sunny cobalt blue sky day, to wading in ankle deep rushing water on a trail that had become a creek from all day pouring down rain and hail,  then froze our butts off as the trail turned from water to thick sheets of  ice, watched as the strong winds filled our tent and then snap as it left,huddled in a shelter one night in hopes we'd stay warmer from the low teen temps we weren't really prepared for, and then constantly reminded of God's beauty on every ridge and pine forest that surrounded Clingsman Dome.

We picked our tent site, set up, and then heard Indigo coming up the trail. She made it to camp but now BOTH her feet were causing her pain. She wasn't sure if she could make it to the nearest forest service road nearly 4 miles down the  mountain tomorrow. She could barely stand and realized she should of shuttled out of Lemon Gap, to seek medical attention but that was several miles back.She dropped her pack and sat down on a log, we joined her. Concerned, we helped set her tent up and then we discussed what the plan was to help her down the mountain. She said she has a very high pain tolerance and that was apparent when she removed her shoe and discovered an open blister that looked terribly painful and she didn't even know it. She ate and we gave her a couple 500 MG of Naproxen, helped her to her tent and tried to comfort her as she was visibly upset. Suz and I took a little walk and were able to get a signal and make a call to The Happy Gnomemad Hostel and spoke with Sunshine. Thankfully,  she could meet us at Granenflo Gap tomorrow and shuttle Indigo to a walkin clinic in Hot Springs! We shared the news with Indigo in the morning and decided that we would carry her heavy items in our packs to help lighten the load. We got on the trail around 830am and said a little prayer to help guide us safely. We trekked behind Indigo the whole way down the mountain and were so impressed with her will and determination, one strong woman for sure! We arrived at the Gap around 11 am and Sunshine was there within minutes!

Our last  night there we chatted with three  women that were across the hallway from us.  Actually, we were all at the same stealth site a couple nights before but were preoccupied with helping Indigo so we didn't really chat much. They've been doing section hiking and have completed all of Georgia and now into North Carolina! One thing we noticed and were drawn too was there laughter! It was contagious. While they enjoyed hiking together, what they really enjoyed was each others company and we admired that connection. Like the tide, people ebb and flow in and out of your life on the trail. Some touch you so briefly and then they're gone. That wasn't the case for Sally, Jan, and Karen or Larry, Curly and Moe as Suz fondly called them. We felt a link, kindred spirits I would call it.

Tree and Gandalf headed out of camp early for a 14 mile trek towards Jerry's Cabin Shelter (which is an awesome scaled down Smokey's style Shelter complete with a fireplace in it and also several grassy tent sites to choose from) We were certain to not see them again as we left camp and headed north. Soon we passed a couple sobo section hikers who warned us about the approaching thunder storms in the area and said it was supposed to be severe between 1-2pm. We were head for a 1.5 mile ridge hike that neither one of us really wanted to be on during a storm. So we picked up our pace and made it to Little Laurel Shelter around noon. We were relieved that Tree was tucked in the shelter and that she didn't press on! Gandalf decided to trek on, brave lady for sure! We climbed up in the shelter and hoped that the storm would pass quickly so we could continue with our plan.

We dressed into our costumes,  first layering for warmth, then for dryness.  We didn't know if it would be rain or snow, but hoped for snow.Reviewing each other's outfit looking for flaws in our attire. Are we ready for her, we wondered?
We left camp at 7:30 AM, the morning still fresh, but the sky divided.  To the right of our path, the sun was slightly breaking through the clouds and trees, to the left (North) we saw ominous clouds heading for our path.
She did not pounce us right away, but let us warm up with a 3 mile gradual climb.  
The stage was set, our entrance would be from a protected treeline on the Southwest end of the Mountain.   As we came out onto the stage she greeted us with a fierce gust of wind from the North.  We summitted and decended Little Hump Mnt slightly shaken, but in one piece.  She gave us about a mile of intermission.  We adjusted our gear and attire during an intermission which was tucked in the lower treeline section. 
The next scene was climactic as we went over Hump Mountain at 5,587'.  It was a mile climb that never seemed to end.  There was no talking as Mother Nature read her script and whispered gusts into our ears and blocked out all voices.  Her power pushed us off the trail several times as we were clearly puppets for her amusement. 
As we finally submitted, she let us loose of her grip.  Probably just to entertain herself with the next hiker heading up the mountain for scene 2 act 1..","Stan Murray Shelter

So off we headed to walk a half a mile on a very busy 19 East to pick up the trail where we left off.  Log loaded Semi's, work trucks, and cars, quickly whipped by us as we hugged the guardrail, paying attention and keeping an eye on any vehicle that may stray over the yellow line. It was the most unnerving experience of the day!
This mornings hike was a welcome change, we meandered over grassy hillsides and could see little hump and hump standing so calm and peaceful to our left, hard to imagine that just the other day we were socked in, getting tossed, turned, and blown around up there. Amazing how quickly things change from day to day.
We trekked past the beautiful Jones water fall and mile marker 400 when I heard a hard thumb behind me. Suz had fell hard on her right side and was on the trail! I quickly dropped my trekking poles and access if she was ok. She needed a minute but then reached for my arm to help pull her up. Thank goodness she was not hurt!

It was soo beautiful and we could here and see the strong moving water well below us!

We actually ran into a couple hikers later on that actually Auqa blazed part of the trail on the lake. Aqua blaze means that they rented kayaks and paddle the same distance they would have hiked on the A.T. For purist that's a no no but we were intrigued by the idea.

Sources have been dry so we have to go longer between refills or carry extra which is never fun! We have the AWOL data book and the GUTHOOKS app on our phones that we constantly reference for how far the next water source is, to stealth sites, next towns, elevation changes, etc. We are so thankful for these useful and helpful tools! So our stealth site last nite was by a spring that several hikers had passed up because it was a stagnant source. But I went up an overgrown path and actually found the spring! It was flowing slowly but it met our needs. We set up our chairs for the evening and started to filter the water in preparation for dinner when we heard off in the distance ""who cooks for you, who cooks for you, who cooks for yooou"". The familiar sound of a Barred Owl. A sound we frequently hear in the forest. So Suz open her Merlin bird app and proceeded to call back to our dinner guest. We waited and sure enough he responded back. This went on for a bit when all of a sudden a swoop over head with a wing span as long as we are tall flew over us. It was him, Mr. Barred Owl sitting on a limb directly above us, maybe 20' at the most. He was close!  We called him in, curiosity got the best of him as he stared down at us with those enormously piercing eyes that looked right thru us. I mean his eyes were big, kind mean but beautiful. We felt if we looked at him too long he'd come down and gouge your eyes out.

We were hiking by 7:30 and looking down on Palmerton by 8:30.  There is alot of controversy over the historic Zinc factory that operated here several years ago.  The process of smelting Zinc and the disposal of the waste has left a significant environmental impact locally.  Through revegitation initiatives,  trees and grass have began to grow again.
We got to the shelter side trail about 4:30, walked past the tenting area and saw it was not so inviting. Agreed we would tent back up by the trail on the ridge as it seemed nicer and cooler than by the shelter.  Next step was fetching water.  We dropped our packs near the shelter and headed down the blue blaze for water.  Got to the firsr spring, and it was dry.  Trecked another quarter mile to the 2nd spring and it had enough flow to work.  You want the water to be moving atleast or it is stagnant.
On the hike back up the blue blaze we were startled by a Timber Rattlesnake, and he was NOT happy!!Thankfully he warned us enough in advance so we were able to before we got to close. He made us wait a few minutes,  as he wanted us to know, this was his trail.
""For nearly 80 years, the New Jersey Zinc Company disposed of 33 million tons of smelting waste at the site. Former smelting operations released heavy metals into the valley, causing the wide-spread loss of trees on about 4,000 acres of Blue Mountain. This barren area allowed for surface water contamination from erosion of contaminated soils into Aquashicola Creek and the Lehigh River.""  Reference from EPA article, ""PALMERTON ZINC PILE PALMERTON, PA Redevelopment""","Palmerton

The weather will be a factor again today. 89 degrees and no water until we get to the shelter, 13 miles away.
We got to Wind Gap, about 5 miles into our hike and took a break.  The gap has a busy road running through it which we had to cross, and a trailer park on the other side.  One of the residents was working in his yard, so I walked over and asked if he had some extra water he could share.  Taking him by surprise,  I had to repeat my question.  Wearing his Dale Earnhardt T-shirt and a cigarette hanging out of his mouth, he welcomed me into his yard.  I explained there is no water for the next 9 miles and he questioned if I got enough.   I thanked him, then was on my way again, crossing the busy road before rejoining Cindy by the trail.

Today we go over Mnt Greylock.  Honestly I was not familiar with the Mountain,  but it is a popular tourist spot.  We were one of the firsts to get to the top, where we had a great view of the vally below.   The monument at the summit is War Memorial, from the state of Massachusetts.  
After walking around and taking in the great views, we decided to see if the Lodge was open.  A short walk later, we were being seated for breakfast and had a hot cup of coffee in our hand.  What a blessing.
After breakfast we started our trek down the mountain.  We were taken by surprise when we saw several trail runners run past us with numbers on thier shirts.  When we crossed the next road ahead of us, one of the Park employees told us about the Haf Marathon that we found ourselves in the middle of.  So we started cheering the runners on, and stepping aside for them as they ran up the steep Mnt Greylock.
As we continued cheering runners on, telling them ""You got this"", ""Looking good"", ""Stay strong"", I realized I didnt recall when I had saw the last White Blaze.  I asked to ""Stitch"" and ""Pheonix"", ""Do you guys see a blaze?""  No response.  I pulled out my phone, opened Guthooks and.... said ""Shit!""   We were NOT on the trail.  We somehow missed the turn as we were cheering these darn runners.  
We all agreed we were NOT going to go back up the trail to try and find it.  It was too steep to do this twice.  The trail had to join down the mountain, and it did.
After we got our bearings, the next task for the day was resupply.  We started walking towards town and putting our thumbs out asking for a ride.  It only took us about 5 minutes before Pete & Virginia picked us up.  They were vacationing with thier family from Manhattan and agreed to take us to the store and back to the trail head.  They were our trail angels for the day.","Mark Nopel Shelter
