So, which voice in your head do you listen to?  I’ve spent a lot of time over the last 10 years reading many (hundreds?) trail journals on this site and walking vicariously with those hikers who got on the trail with the goal of thru-hiking the AT, always wondering if I would ever join their ranks. 

Well, this year, I am. 

I made the decision to hike this year relatively late - near the end of January. As this journal progresses, I will touch on some of the reasons that influenced my decision but will begin by saying that without the support of my awesome wife, none of this would be possible. 

I’ve spent the last two months scrambling and assembling gear from a starting point of near zero. As I write this it is April 4th, Easter Sunday, and I just received my last piece of gear yesterday. If nothing else, this should be an entertaining venture!",,View Entry,"Apr 04, Sun",0
Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634421,"So this is where I will define a few terms common to the AT (Appalachian Trail) hiking community. Thru-hiking: completing all the trail miles in one 12 month period 
Section Hiking: hiking...well, a section of the trail. LASH: Long Ass Section Hike - just what is says - a long section hike.
HYOH - Hike Your Own Hike - a.k.a “I thoroughly appreciate and honor your unsolicited advice, I know my sox aren’t the preferred brand and may retain 9% more moisture, but can I please go back to eating my cold oatmeal?”
NOBO - a northbound hiker. NOBO hikes are by far the most common with thru hikers starting at Springer Mountain in Georgia. 
SOBO - southbound hikers who start in Maine at Mt Katahdin and move south to Georgia
Flip Flopper - starting the AT somewhere in the middle and hiking one direction, then flipping back to your starting point and hiking the other direction. Flip flop hikes can be very convoluted, flipping and flopping in multiple directions with the goal to finish all the trail miles. 
Gram Wienie: a hiker that will do almost anything to cut grams off of their pack weight. Cutting off 1/2 inch of excess strap. Drilling holes in their shortened toothbrush. I swear this isn’t me, though I’m not judging anyone.  Ok, I may have cut my toothbrush handle in half. Trail Magic: an unexpected boon received along the way. A ride to town, a cooler of Gatorade, a bag of m&m’s from a day hiker. Anything, really, where your fellow humans show a kindness with no expectation of return. Trail Angel: someone providing trail magic. There are some truly incredible and even legendary Trail Angels on the AT who support hikers who are out putting in miles.",,View Entry,"Apr 07, Wed",0
Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634622,"Hoo boy, do I have theories.Theories have a hilarious way of interacting with reality. My theories about long distance hiking are likely akin to my theories about parenting - before I actually had kids. Mike Tyson once said that everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face. Dwight Eisenhower said that: “In preparing for battle I have found that plans are useless, but planning is indispensable”I’ve done the planning and I’ve got my theories about what a thru hike is like,  but I think I’m thinking rationally and know that my plans will change and I’m telling myself I’m ok with that.When the decision was made to do a thru hike, I then had to decide how and when to start. The “when” was mostly easy as I wanted to give my employers plenty of notice of my leaving and given that I didn’t decide on this hike until the end of January, an April start was the call. My theory being that an April start will give me the best weather and hiking months to complete a thru. (And I also had no gear, so I needed time to make decisions and purchases)As to the where, I’m in no hiking shape to do a Southbound hike from Maine- so that was out. The traditional NOBO start from Springer had some appeal, but the amount of hikers starting on the trail in Georgia in April puts a lot of stress of trail resources and I wanted to avoid the “bubble”. My theory is that avoiding the large crowds will make for a happier hike.By doing a flip-flop hike I “plan” to start on a quieter section of trail with maybe warmer temps and perhaps a less-steep learning curve.  The theory here is that I can use the first few week as an on-trail “shakedown” as I get use to my gear and sleeping in a hammock.Some potential theory disruptors: thru hikers I will be meeting will be putting in bigger miles as they’ve got their trail legs, so I won’t be able to keep that pace.  I won’t have other newbies to lean on as I get use to trail life.  Also, when getting to Maine nearly everyone will be finishing their hikes while I’ll still have 1/3rd of the trail to go - without the hikers I will have been hiking around for months.  So there is some potential for mental game issues as my trip south will probably be a lot more isolated.Theory will meet reality on April 12.But, as hikers have always said and written: “hike your own hike”As always, we shall see!",,View Entry,"Apr 11, Sun",0
Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634734,"After spending 5 days in Tennessee with friends from college, I was dropped off at noon in Troutville, Va at mile 731.8 and I started my flip flop hike going north on the AT. 
I didn’t have a specific plan in mind other than not to go too far, too fast. The trail had great views of central Virginia as a lot of it ran along a Ridgeline. 
I stopped for a break at the Fullhardt Knob shelter and decided to heat some water for a dehydrated meal. Naturally, I managed to burn my hand lighting my alcohol stove, but the resulting Buffalo Ranch Chicken was good. 
Hiked in and did not see any other hikers until I got to the Wilson Creek shelter at 6 pm, where I met three other hikers: Reset - who started in January at Springer Mt (Reset began with a 60lb pack!) LAF who is a flip flopper as well - he started back in Damascus. Trail mix came in about 7:30 and he is a flipping too, he started at mile 250. And Special Ed who is section hiking the few parts of the trail he hasn’t yet done. 
Got my hammock set up pretty quickly but skipped any dinner - still recovering from those 5 days of overindulging with my friends. Turned in at 8 to spend my second ever night sleeping strung between two trees.","Troutville RR crossing
",Wilson Creek Shelter,"Apr 12, Mon",9.70
Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634781,"Had a leisurely start to the day as I had planned to go 10 miles to a tent site. Got packed and in the trail just before 9. The trail followed the Blue Ridge Parkway most of the day and the views were incredible, with vistas from both sides of the ridge. Found some patches of wild strawberries that were sadly not ripe yet. 
Came across Special Ed (a section hiker who was at the shelter last night) when stopping for water and he encouraged me to consider going to Cove Mountain Shelter. I told him I’d see how I felt when I hit my planned camping spot for the day. 
The afternoon had a few more good climbs and I got slightly concerned when a half dozen turkey vultures kept circling around me. What are they seeing? Do I look like I’m that close to being their food?
Hit my target camping site at 3:15pm and checked the terrain map and it showed it was mostly downhill for the next 2.8 miles to Cove Mountain. So, onward!
My left shoulder was starting to bother me quite a bit, which is a worry just two days in  I adjusted my chest strap on my pack to move the shoulder strap to a new spot but it was still getting very sore. When I got to the shelter I looked at my pack and the right side external frame post had popped out of the pocket where it clips in. I got it fixed, but will really have to keep an eye on it.
Met a section hiker named Not Sunshine who is out for a few days and also met Roo who started at Springer in February and has the stories to prove it.
Had a Whipperwill start up at 8:30 and he went aaallllllll night.  Didn’t bother me much, but opinions varied!
Planning for a short day Wednesday to Middle Creek Campground as I have a resupply box there and there is rain coming for the afternoon and evening.","Wilson Creek Shelter
",Cove Mountain Shelter,"Apr 13, Tue",13.80
Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634805,"So my plan to start the trail was to do roughly 8 miles a day over three days to get to the Middle Creek Campground, which is 1.2 miles from the Cross Jennings Creek intersection with the AT. I ended up hiking more the first two days so I had a short hike on the docket for today. Had fun at the shelter last night listening to Roo’s stories about starting the AT in February with the frozen knots and stiff-as-a-board frozen pants. Reset also started the trail earlier in January and had to post-hole his way through the snow storms in the Smokies. 
My mini hike down to the road crossing did involve getting passed twice by twenty-something hikers who were both jogging down hill as they went by me.  As if their knees will never grow old.  I secretly vowed to hate them both. What good is it getting old if you can’t begrudge the youth their youth?
I had sent ahead a drop box to the campground and it was there when I got here. I was kinda hoping it was lost, as I haven’t been very hungry the first three days and still had half my food left. Now I have 5 or 6 days of grub for the next three day stretch. Ah well, I’ll carry the pounds as punishment. I’m now sitting in the bunkhouse at the Campground, just chilling. I did use my cork massage ball to work over my muscles. Also took a shower and did laundry. I’m currently the only one here and don’t know yet if anyone else will check in for the night, the bunkhouse sleeps 5, but I wouldn’t be sad either way. 
Well, I said that I haven’t been hungry, but I did have a double bacon cheeseburger (pic at the top) here at the campground. I rationalized that this will probably be my only chance to have a burger here, so, I did.  I loooooove rationalizations that let me do what I want to do!
I will be heading out early tomorrow to get to the trail by way of that 1.2 mile road walk. Then I plan on hiking until I don’t feel like hiking anymore. Might stealth camp between shelters.
I saw that they also have ice cream and milkshakes here, I wonder if I can whip up another rationalization...","Cove Mountain Shelter
",Cross Jennings Creek,"Apr 14, Wed",3.20
Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634867,"Started early this morning as I had a road walk from the campground back down to Jennings Creek where I left the trail the day before. Had to fuss with my Zpacks backpack again as the frame support popped out once I loaded my pack. Left the one-man bunkhouse at 6:15 and got back to the trail 1.2 miles away at 6:30. Side note: only miles actually hiked on the trail itself “count” as miles walked. All the side trails and town walking only wear your shoes out without contributing to your mile total. Today promised to be a lot more up than my previous 2.3 days on the trail and right from the road it went up. Early morning found me walking through a pine forest with moss and ferns all around. It smelled like your finest bathroom air freshener. Near the top of my second climb I met a turkey hunter who was taking a break from trying to find his quarry. He told me he doesn’t bag many, but enjoys the pursuit through the mountains. I took a side trail to Black Rock Lookout (picture of the sign above) and was blown away by the view - and the wind. It’s one of the most dramatic overlooks I’ve had the pleasure to be at, as you can’t see anything as you walk up due to the rock formation and then BAM! Killer view for miles and miles and miles. I’ll try and attach a video link in the sidebar when I get to the next town. Last major climb was a biggun’ - Apple Orchard Mountain. I realized just before I started the climb around 1:45 that I had neglected to eat anything today. So I found a big rock sitting quietly in the sun, took my shoes off, and had a 650 calorie Greenbelly Cashew/mango/coconut bar. Good enough!Getting to the top was a slog, but well worth the awesome views to both sides of the trail. It was fairly cold and windy up at 4224 feet (my first 4000 footer) so I did not tarry. On the way down I passed beneath the famed “Guillotine” rock formation where a large Boulder is suspended overhead between two rock formations. Pretty cool. I had intended to make camp for the night at a shelter, but it looked very sketch and there were A LOT of dead trees around. With high winds tonight and the fact that it was at 3900 feet, I decided to take my chances and find a stealth site further down the mountain. Which I have. So I’m sitting on a decaying log and typing this.  Next move will be to set up my hammock and tarp, hang my food bag a good 200 feet from my camp, and crawl into the insulated goodness. As my hands are getting cold. Hope all is well with everyone who reads this.","Jennings Creek
",Stealth Campsite,"Apr 15, Thu",16.18
Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634924,"I got a little cocky last night and consequently, a little cold. The temps dropped to the mid 30’s and the wind HOWLED all night. Luckily, I picked a stealth site on the other side of the ridge so I heard more wind than I felt. By the time I realized that I was going to be sleeping cold, I was too warm to get out of my hammock and get my extra clothes out of my pack. So I just rode it out. The toesies suffered the brunt of the chill, but we’re still on speaking terms. 
Started packing up at 6:15 and was bushwhacking back to the trail an hour later. Nice uphill to start helped me warm up and the trail was awesome. Lots of flowers and bees and birds even in the chill. 
Encountered a large Doe coming down into a meadow and she seemed completely unconcerned with my presence. You should know one thing about me: I think deer are awesome. They’re like cows, only without all the attitude and stuffy manners. So I had a nice conversation with her as she moseyed on in front of me to join her cohort in the woods. 
As I hiked thru the morning I had nice views of what I hiked yesterday and the trail continues to be mostly smooth. I decided to hike to the James River and stay the night at Stanimal’s Hiker Hostel where I also had two packages waiting for me. I had to wait about 90 minutes at the parking lot by the River for my shuttle, but I occupied myself by trying remember movie lines. The one that stuck with me was this: “If ever I meet one of you Texas waddies who ain't drunk from a hoofprint, I think I'll… I'll shake their hand, or buy them a Daniel Webster cigar!”  Know the movie?
I’m now at the hostel and it is full for the night. I’ll be in a 12x10 bedroom with three bunk beds and 5 other hikers. Should be a hoot. 
Plan tomorrow will depend on whether I can can get someone here to mail two packages for me. If not, I’m heading out after my postal visit is done. If the mail drop gets handled for me, I will slack pack from 15 miles up the trail and stay one more night here. Slack packing involves hiking with a light pack or no pack and getting dropped off to hike either back to where you left off or forward to where your gear will be dropped off. 
Either way, this is fine.","Stealth Campsite
","Stanimal’s Hiker Hostel Glasgow, Va","Apr 16, Fri",12.70
Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634999,"So the snorers (including yours truly) were outnumbered in the bunk room last night but we held our own. I actually feel poorly about this, but allergy season here in Virginia is hitting me hard and the congestion is real. Charlie the hostel caretaker organized everyone’s departure plans last night and made pancakes for everyone this morning. I didn’t eat, because breakfast is for nerds. True story, look it up.


I leaned into the slack packing idea for today. Three of us who were at the hostel took a 50 minute shuttle ride north to a point where the trail crossed a back country road. I borrowed a day pack from the hostel and left most of my gear behind, so I was only carrying about 8 pounds (2 liters of water included). We had 15.0 miles to hike southbound on the trail back to where I left the trail yesterday at the James River in Glasgow. 


I hiked the first two hours with/around Grinder and Storm (should be a tag team duo name in professional wrestling.  Interesting sidebar: hiker trail names seem to fall into two categories, either fierce WWE names like the aforementioned Grinder and Storm and Ice Bear or muppet names like Grumpy Cat, Sweet Corn and Slippers. Side note ended) but hiked on ahead when they broke for an early lunch. They were going to take a side trail to a shelter .2 miles down the hill. That was no bueno in my book. Just more terrific views today as I climbed to Bluff Mountain where there are concrete footings from a now-gone watchtower. Right next to the summit was a memorial for a young boy who wandered away from his school house in the 1950’s and climbed seven miles up the mountain, only to perish from exposure. Quite sad. He was one month shy of 5 years old. 


Met a few of my fellow hostel inmates as they hiked north while I passed hiking south. Will maybe/probably see a few of them in the next few days as I go back to northbound tomorrow. Took my break at 2pm at the Cliffs overlook (picture at the top). Actually ate a blueberry probar and a keto bar, though I’m still not what you would call hungry.
The hike down from the cliffs had scenic views of the James River and I still can’t say enough about how gorgeous this part of Virginia is. Hiked from 8:15 this morning until 5:15 when we were met by the shuttle driver Strings. (Probably goes in the muppet category, don’t ya’ think?)
Contemplating dinner but nothing sounds good, maybe another probar and some peanut butter.
So I’m going to be bunked up in the hostel for one more night (put your money on the Snorers, giving 6 1/2) then get dropped back tomorrow morning where I got dropped off today. 
Have to say, I really like the hiking part of hiking, just putting one foot in front of the other and eating up the trail, one stride at a time.","Reservoir Road
",James River Crossing,"Apr 17, Sat",13.66
Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635106,"Settled up at the hostel this morning. $30 per night for two nights and $45 of bonus shuttling. I didn’t go for any of the pizza, ice cream, or beer (lagers only).  Gotta be me. I paid for my stay with a portion of a gift card that my coworkers (organized by Russ) passed the hat around to give me as a “stay away as long as you want” present. People’s kindness has been a little overwhelming, truth be told. 


Grinder, Storm and I were dropped off in the same spot as the day before only going north away from the hostel instead of south. They had arraigned for our packs to be dropped off 13 miles up trail where we planned to camp for the night, so I had another day pack for the hike. Charlie, our hostel host and shuttle driver joked that I may have set a record for slack packing my first 30% of the trail. I think that if someone like Grinder, who since 2013 had nearly completed the entire trail mileage four times, suggests something, it’s wise to do it. 
Part of the walk was through an area where freed slaves lived for a while along the banks of the Brown Mountain creek. There are still stone walls, a chimney or two, and a few foundation stones remaining as well. Hard to imagine what it had to have been like for those newly freed after the civil war, trying to start from nothing to survive and care for their families.  They had to work as sharecroppers, with 1/4 of their harvest going to the landowner. The Community disbanded in the 1920’s when they sold their land to the US Forest Service. Makes me think. 



The second 5 miles began at 1375 ft of elevation and went up to 4045 feet. So the first five miles took me two hours and the next five just about 4. I keep telling myself that 2 miles is just about the distance of a walk around my block at home. For whatever reason, that helps me rationalize the distance, leaving out the terrain.At the top of the climb we came to Bald Knob. A bald is simply what they call a mountain top down here that has no trees on it. Strangely, Bald Knob may have been a knob, but it wasn’t bald, mostly covered with dead or dormant trees. 




>span class=""s1"">

The walk down to our meeting spot with the shuttle driver and our packs was chilly. The meadow where we had planned to camp was nice, but in checking the weather, I saw that a cold night was in store for Monday and if I didn’t move further on, I would probably need to make camp Monday night above 3600 feet. Little known meteorological fact: the higher you go, the colder it gets. So I departed from Grinder and Storm at 4:45 and moved up the trail another 3.5 miles before setting up camp.I am writing this Sunday night, laying in my hammock with no cell service and holy Mary mother of God! - an owl just hooted so loudly and close by I nearly soiled myself. 


I’m going to aim to hike about 15 miles tomorrow (the last 4 all downhill) and get below 1200 feet before the cold weather hits. 


Ok, blood pressure is dropping back down to normal heart attack levels. It’s nearly Hiker Midnight (sunset in the real world) so I’ll post this on Monday as soon as I have connection again.","Reservoir Road 
",Forest Service Road 286 - stealth site,"Apr 18, Sun",16.40
Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635151,"Started raining about 2:30 then got heavier around 4:30 this morning. I had wanted to get any early start, but didn’t want to pack in the rain. 


Finally at 7 I went ahead and got dressed. It’s possible to change your clothes lying in a hammock, but it ain’t easy. I was wishing there were two orderlies and a nurses assistant to help out. After getting my rain jacket on is swung my feet out into my shoes, which I had apparently left juuuust a half inch too far out side of my tarp and they were consequently swimming in water. Ah well, this is fine. I did manage to pack everything dry in such a way that it stayed dry. I then hiked off into a slight drizzle. 
The first 5 or so miles was through undulating terrain with many rocks, boulders, streams and bogs. Really put me in mind of the Trollshalls in LOTRO. (For those 3 of you dear readers who know the reference, you’ll understand. Everyone one doesn’t share our refined taste in recreational online games. And they’re the poorer for it.)Based on the recommendation of Charlie from Stanimal’s hostel, I did take a side trail (promised you I would, Jessica) to Spy Rock and was once more blown away by the 360 degree views. The sun even made an appearance as I arrived. There was also standing water on top of the rock that was lousy with tadpoles. I was amazed frogs could live up there, let alone...well, you know...


I continued up the the Priest shelter were by tradition hikers confess their sins in the log book. I had a ton of them that were quite scandalous and concerned everyone reading this, but you’ll have to climb up there and read them for yourselves if you want to know the deets. Although I’ll give you one freebie - I didn’t vote for Ruth Messenger when she ran for Mayor against Rudy Giuliani. 


I’m a trail noob, but coming down the Priest (there’s a Catholic joke in there somewhere - HEY-O!) was five miles of sliding rocks, roots, boulders and post cars views of Virginia farmland 3000 feet below. It was brutal, only thing worse might be to climb it. Didn’t see any other NOBO hikers today, just a few SOBO section hikers. 


I’ve avoided taking any vitamin I so far (ibuprofen) but my knees are singing tonight so I’m going to pop a couple before bed. I’ve set up camp next to the Tye River at Virginia Rt 56. Planning to ease back a bit in mileage tomorrow as I have a 3200 ft climb in 5 miles to the top of Three Ridges, which will be my last 4000 ft mountain until Vermont, I believe. 


Keeping my eye on the cold front Canada is gifting us, do not want to be caught high up somewhere if temps go below freezing.","Forest Service Road 286 - stealth site
",Tye River,"Apr 19, Mon",15.70
Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635241,"So, interesting night and morning. Go back a few days: met a hiker in Glasgow who was getting off trail due to having a run in with aggressive dogs at a shelter by the Tye River (not where I was camping). So just before midnight I woke to screaming and shouting from up the mountain. Gradually the voices got closer and I at first thought I might have a problem with locals as I was camped right next to the road. A light began to play against my tarp as what I now recognized as a woman’s voice kept screaming curses and saying “I’m hurt!”  Then I thought that maybe someone got hurt at the shelter 2.5 miles away and came down for medical assistance. Thankfully, they moved across the suspension footbridge and I eventually got back to sleep. 


So now it’s morning, I’m packed up and heading uphill, but I don’t want to stop at the shelter for water - just in case - I loaded up 4 liters from the river and headed up the trail. As an afterthought, I tied a rock into my “Run The Jewels” bandana that my son Alex got for me at Coachella a few years ago. I figured either they were dumb dogs who would need a rock up side the head or they were intelligent dogs who would be impressed and awed by my taste in music, either way, I’d be covered. 


Stay with me here.


So after a 2 mile climb I came to a trail junction and saw a hiker packing up his tent. I stopped and asked him if he’d seen or heard any dogs last night. He said no. I started to walk away but stopped and asked him if he heard a screaming woman, he said “oh hell yes!”  He told me a man and a woman stopped just outside his tent and a screaming argument about whether the person in the tent might “put them up for the night”. The man prevailed in saying they were “close to the car, let’s keep walking”. The hiker told me “I’m a psychiatric nurse and see this all the time. They were tripping mad balls”. I figured that was some clinical term, so I thanked him for the info and moved on. 


My supposition is that they went up to Castle Rock to view the sunset, get chemically altered and get up to what Frogs seemingly get up to on top of a mountain. 


Fear assuaged, I began the 3 mile, 3000 foot climb up past Castle Rock to Three Ridges Mountain (which contrary to my claim yesterday, is only 3965 feet, so it’s the last 3965 foot mountain will climb before points far, far north). I had set a loose goal to get to top from my camp in 5 hours and made it in 4 and a half. Victory was hard to relish. 


Sadly, I keep having issues with the frame on my Zpacks Arc Air pack, the sewn in pockets for the braces don’t seem to be deep enough to hold the pieces in place. So even as I hike they try to worm their way out. Once I get to Waynesboro I’ll contact them and see what can be done. But I know that if this is happening in my first 100 miles, it doesn’t bode well. 



This is fine  
Met a hiker going up by the name of Hikes A Lot who I had actually read about in a trail journal like this a few years ago. His original name was Falls A Lot, then Sir Falls A Lot, then hikers decided that was too negative so they changed his trail name. Anyway, he’s out doing a 43 miles section he hasn’t done before, then he’s got about another 400 miles of trail to complete the entire length. Section Hikers are a dedicated lot. 


Looooong post continues. 


So after coming down the mountain, I made the decision to head for Rusty’s Hard Times Hollow Hostel off the Blue Ridge Parkway. Downside: I had a three mile road walk to get there. My hitching skills must leave a lot to be desired as not one of the dozen cars that passed me as I walked did so much as tap their brakes. Even a fellow Michiganain dissed me. 



This is fine.
As I neared the place one guy did stop to ask where I was going. I told him and he said it was just ahead around the corner. This was Rusty. He didn’t offer me a ride because he wanted me to have a chance to read all of his signs that are posted on the trees as you head down to his place. 


With a post this long, I’m going to write something incongruous: words cannot do Rusty of his place justice. I’m not sure much has changed since he opened it back in 1982 - including the mattresses in the bunkhouse. The mice seem pretty fresh and ready, so there’s that 



I spent three hours talking with Rusty and helping him figure out which of his four Polaroid cameras might work. After a half dozen attempts he had a picture of me that he liked and then we spent a while trying to find a stapler that would work from the 6 or so he had so he could post my picture on his ceiling. 


He’s an original character and it was the reason I wanted to come here. I don’t anticipate sleeping much tonight  in the “bunkhouse” what with the holes in the walls and the pitted patter of little feet, but at least my friend Josh has prepared me for such circumstances. 


It’s a one of a kind experience. 


Be well!","Tye River
",Reid’s Gap,"Apr 20, Tue",10.70
Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635325,"Got a ride back to the trail at Reid’s gap from Rusty at 7:30. Suffice it to say it was an unforgettable experience. 


First encounter of the day was with a man walking his dog, which I recognized as an Airedale. The gentleman was surprised I knew the breed, as it wasn’t very common, but my in laws had two over the years. As payment for my knowledge, I got two enthusiastic and muddy paws prints on my shirt. This is fine. 


Hiking plan for the day was to have to plan until I hit the Paul Wolfe shelter, 14 miles up trail. There were no huge climbs today, though I would go back over 3500 feet at one point on Humpback Mountain.


Early in the morning as I was going up a ridge I saw two men dressed in matching burnt orange robes and sandals coming down the trail. They both carried wicker drums and one had an incense stick. I gave them a Midwest-nice “good morning” but only got stares in return. Apparently their oneness with the cosmos didn’t extend to my corner of it. Ah well, at least I didn’t get a recruiting pitch. 
Climbing up Humpback mountain their is a 3 foot high rock wall at least a mile long that goes up and over the top. The shear manpower needed to build that boggles the mind. 


Coming down the mountain I ran into a couple that I had seen a week before at Thunder Hill shelter where I passed on due to the wind and dead trees. Always nice to see a familiar face or two. 


I made the shelter well before my self appointed cut off time, so I decided to push on 5 more miles to Waynesboro. It helped that the trail was much less rocky once over the mountain. 


Interesting things on the way to Waynesboro:
Lowe Family cemetery plot was right next to the trail. The grave markers were just plain stones, no engravingsMet a SOBO section hiker named 5 liter because he carries so much water. His pack resembled a tanker truck. Passed the ruins of a homestead cabin with just a chimney and a few foundation stones left. Was on the phone with my wife and was going to flick a stick off the trail (it’s hard for me to pass by sticks and branches without cleaning them up. I have issues) when I realized it wasn’t a stick. Immediately hung up the phone (sorry, honey) to take a video of the 4-5 ft snake stretched across the trail. Just before Rockfish Gap I rounded a corner and saw a tent set up across the trail. It was a young family of 5 out camping for hand first time and they were practicing with their tent before getting to the shelter campsite. I wished them well and said a prayer for their safety. 


When I got to the gap I had a half mile walk to the visitor center to try and get a ride into town. I think that at 4:30 EST that Rockfish Gap may have been the windiest place in America. Twas’ brutal. As I got to the center a yellow truck pulled up, it was a local trail angel who gives hikers free rides into town. 15 minutes later I was checking into the Residence Inn (thanks mom and pops!)


After showering I did walk 15 minutes to a Walmart to pick up a few things. I swear to Odin that they’ve cloned the same 98 people and stocked every Walmart in America with them, just so you always get the full Walmart experience. 


I’m taking a zero day on Thursday to do chores, laundry, a mail drop and to try and get my pack sorted out. 


Back in the trail heading into the Shenandoah National Park on Friday.","Reid’s Gap
",Rockfish Gap,"Apr 21, Wed",19.10
Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635406,"So today was chore day. I needed to call Zpacks regarding my pack. Had to get laundry done. Wanted to do a shakedown on gear I had brought and decide what to send home. Needed to go downtown to Stanimal’s Waynesboro Hostel to pick up a box that they sent up from Glasgow. Then needed to go to the post office to send whatevs back to hearth and home. Oh, and get a beer. 
I called Zpacks soon after 8 am to tell them about the issues I’ve been having with my Arc Air Robic 50l pack (full names always sound way cooler. Oh wait, I’m going by “Sev” and not my full name. Oh well, I’ve never been accused of possessing excess cool). Carolyn at Zpacks was very, very helpful and apologetic about the apparent defect. I assured her that I wasn’t that upset about it, things happen, it isn’t personal, it isn’t life threatening, I just wanted to know if I was doing something wrong. She said it was likely due to a production issue with the frame pockets not being sewn correctly (I guessed right!). She told me she would get with the production team to expedite the construction of a replacement pack - they are a cottage business and don’t have 50 sitting on a shelf. Then she would contact me once it was ready to be shipped and we’d figure out where to send it. 
What more can you ask for? 
And to skip ahead, Carolyn called me in the afternoon to say the pack would be ready to ship tomorrow!  So I’m having sent 100 miles up the trail to Front Royal, Va where I will hopefully be in the middle of next week. 
Thanks, Zpacks!
Next order of business: Laundry. I called an Uber (first for me) and headed downtown to the laundromat. So, to set  the scene: I need to do ALL my laundry - you really don’t pack excess clothes on a hike. What to do?  Well, I bought a pair of shorts at Walmart last night for $8.44 (washed them in my sink and hung them to dry overnight. I’m not deranged enough to wear something right off the rack from that glorious institution of American commerce), then I put on my rain jacket. 
That’s it. Shoes, no socks. Shorts. Rain jacket. No shirt.  It’s 44 degrees. I, am a bum.  
Interesting thing at the laundromat. I saw two women folding and sorting clothes in to about a dozen garbage bags. When they were getting ready to leave I asked if they needed help (from a bum) loading their car. They said sure. Turns out they do laundry for people who live near them but can’t get out to do their own. People always surprise, for good and ill. The good always feels so much better. 
Laundry done, I slipped my pants over my shorts while hiding behind an industrial dryer, donned some socks and packed everything up into the Outback Steakhouse bag I found under the sink in my hotel room. 
This is fine. 
Back to the streets for a two block walk to the hostel. Got my package and started walking to the post office. Waynesboro is NOT pedestrian friendly. I dodged traffic while walking on lawns and business frontage for 10 minutes (no sidewalks), then realized I was walking the wrong direction. So, back track dodging traffic to where I had started at the hostel and then do my 15 walk to the post office. 
This is fine. 
Bonus time! 5 minutes shy of the post office I saw a sign for a Bridal Shop/FedEx shipping store!  So I walked in, packed up things to go home (still too much food) and tried on a delightful Princess dress with a drop-back and understated train (still too much beading for my tastes, the search continues). 
And then the true destination: The River burger bar. Had a Waynesboro burger and two local IPA’s and...bliss. 
Back to the hotel - Lyft this time, two transportation firsts!  Going back to my room I passed a sign I hadn’t noticed before that said “Guest Laundry” with an arrow pointing to an area about 75 feet from my room

This. Is. Fine.

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635449,"My shuttle driver DuBose picked me up at the hotel at 7:30...7:45...8:00...8:15...830 (he had forgotten and was horrified when I called him at 8:15. It’s a free ride, I’m going to get pissy? It’s all good) to get me back to the trail at Rockfish Gap. When he gave me a ride here on Wednesday as I got in his truck he said “I don’t want to know your name. I certainly don’t want to know your trail name. I don’t care where you are hiking or the troubles you have. I just want to know where you need to go, where you’re from and what you do for work.  Here’s my card.” This, is a Trail Angel.  He gives free rides to town, just no unnecessary conversation. 


While I waiting for my ride, the desk clerk badgered me into having a complementary “grab and go” bacon, egg and cheese biscuit. Hey, I’m up for dangerous experiences, breakfast counts in my book. Took one bite and realized they left one word out of the description: congealed.  Made a beeline for the lobby restroom and spit it out in the wastebasket. Guy coming out of the stall must have thought “that bum is having a rough morning”


Other than that, it was a great two night stay in Waynesboro at the Residence Inn.  I watched Godfather’s One and Two, caught up on my day by day picture and video album and I’m ready to start walking - where it counts - once again. 


Got to the trailhead at 8:45 without a plan much more complicated than “move north”. They have you fill out a permit about 1/4 mile in at a kiosky thing and they want to know how long you think it’ll take to hike through the National Park. Heckfire, how am I suppose to know?  They should have some sort of table with pack weight on the “x” axis and body weight on the “y” axis that allows you to match the columns for a SWAG. I ended writing down 13 days, one short of the maximum time thru hikers are allowed to hike through the park. I’m a go-getter. 



The hiking today was a bit meh. It was a hazy day without many views to be had. Lots of forest walking through trees without and leaves yet. I did stand underneath a cell tower on top of a rise at one point for about 10 minutes, basking in the radioactive glow of 5 bar heaven.I didn’t meet a single northbound hiker on the trail today. Which has been the case on 5 of my days so far. I did come across a few SOBO’s again out section hiking. Oh, and I also met another 4 or 5 foot snake crossing the trail as I came up a hill. Nearly stepped on this one. I use to really hate snakes, but after seeing Raiders of the Lost Ark when I was 14, I figured not being afraid of snakes was an easy way to get one over on a fictitious hero like Indiana Jones. I’m the same way with Kryptonite. Suck it, Superman. 


I did make one big goof today. I forgot to check on water sources. It wasn’t until I was about 12 miles into the day they I realized the last water source I passed was three miles behind me and the next was 9 miles ahead. Whoopsies. I had about half a liter left of the two I had exited with from the hotel. Big whoopsies. 


But as can happen the day came around. I got a text from my wife remarking that it looked like I had beautiful weather - I did, so I decided to enjoy it and turned around a mentally down kinda day. It was just the pick me up I needed at exactly the right time. Then three miles ahead at a road crossing I got my first Trail Magic of my AT hike: someone left a water cache at a road crossing. This awesome, nameless person obviously knows about this dry section, so they buy gallon jugs of water and keep them stocked for hikers they’ll never meet. Just so, so cool. 


I ended up pushing into a camping area by a shelter (they have bear boxes and cables here to keep food away from the rascals) and doing my first 20 mile day. I think I had stupidly tempted fate by mentioning the big, steep climbs are behind me for now, but the ups and downs today were plentiful. My Garmin watch tells me I climbed the equivalent of 400 plus flights of stairs. 




>span class=""s1"">

There is heavy rain in tomorrow’s forecast. I may hike a short day and set up somewhere before it hits and while away the afternoon in my hammock. We shall see.
And Happy Birthday to my son, Alex, who turned 25 today. Miss you, bud.","Rockfish Gap
",Black rock Hut,"Apr 23, Fri",20.80
Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635640,"I rolled out of my hammock at 6 this morning, left the hut at 6:45 and was back at the trail by seven. The weather report remained unchanged: rain by 3:30 becoming heavier at times throughout the night. 


So in looking at the map, it was 13 miles until the next hut, and after that there were no huts or camping spots for another 8 miles. Seems like I’m going 13 miles today. Hopefully before the rain hits. 
 
Right out of the gate I had to climb black rock Mountain. And let me tell you it was steep. The top of the mountain was literally a pile of rocks there was a sign that said climb at your own risk. My risk told me, don’t climb. I usually consult my risk when asked, though his consul doesn’t always hold sway. 


span class=""Apple-converted-space""> The campground area is very pretty surrounded by mountains there are Bear boxes at every campsite. I don’t think they’re there for show.


I made it to the camp store well ahead of schedule so I took the side trail 3/10 of a mile to the building. The camp store is not open yet and the bathrooms were locked but I was able to get water and charge a few devices. I also took time to cook lunch for the first time in a few days. Cheesy beef tacos were on the menu which in reality weren’t tacos but just a rehydrated meal with beef, spices and one big clump of cheese.


After lunch I hiked on with 6 miles left to go to my planned stop for the night. About a mile down the trail I came across a man taking a selfie, his name was Jeff. Jeff is from Maryland and is trying to hike all 560 miles of trail in the Shenandoah national park: he’s completed over 400 miles to date and when I came across him, he had just completed his last 2.6 miles of the AT that runs through the park. In all his time hiking in the park he has never fought a bear, and he’s poorer for it. I hiked with Jeff for about 4 miles back to where he had his car parked. He’s a bit of a madman, competing multiple times in an extreme trail racing event called “MEGA” up in Pennsylvania. It was good to have some company for 90 minutes or so. 


I got to Pinefield Hut a little after two with rain already threatening. Shortly after, another hiker came in, he just started a flip flop hike four days ago in the southern end of the Park with designs like me to hike the whole trail in 6 months. He’s 56 and an engineer by trade and is taking this hiking hiatus to evaluate what comes next for he and his wife. I was amazed by the amount of cooking gear he had, he explained he had hiked the National Park countless times as a Boy Scout leader and never skimped on meal time. 


By the time the rain started, three more hikers came in and now at 6pm there must be 10-12 people here. Most of them are SOBO’s section hiking the park. I was cocooned in my hammock by 4 and dozed throughout the afternoon listening to a weird and wild book called “Gnomen” recommended by my friend Chris. My dreams should be lit tonight. 


Going to be a wet night.","Black rock Hut
",Pinefield Hut,"Apr 24, Sat",13.20
Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635641,"So the rain stayed steady all night as was forecasted, finally letting up about 5 am. Was pumped that I made it 13 and a half hours before the call of nature could not be denied. 54 year old dudes take their w’s where they can get them. 


Was also happy that my tarp set up kept me, my hammock, and my gear dry all night. Two weeks in and I’m mostly happy with choosing a hammock. The sleep had been good, there’s no muddy/wet tent to pack up. Also, no condensation inside like you can get when tenting. Downside is that I don’t have a mini-home in which to layout gear or change clothes easily. Also, it can be a bit stressful looking for the right trees, the right distance apart, and hopefully facing the wind the right way.


So, hiking on this Sunday. The weather was ca-ray-zee. Seemingly every half mile it would change. Started in a light mist at 6:45, then the sun popped out for 3 minutes, then the wind picked up and blew in fog, then it would repeat all over again. I had the toughest time getting warm and staying warm. Did a lot of hiking above 3000 feet where it was 42 degrees with 10-20mph winds. 


At one point as I was ascending Hightop Mountain two women were coming down from the summit raving about the gorgeous views. When I got to the top 20 minutes later the fog had everything totally docked in. Lesson for the day: women lie. 

There were a lot of day hikers out today as well. Must have passed at least two dozen going up Hightop as a descended the opposite slope. And also noticed about half of them were hiking with masks on. To each their own.
The camping areas weren’t really convenient today. I could have stopped at 8.9 miles or around 12 miles. Or go for a bigger day to Lewis Mountain Campground. I was feeling ok, so I made for Lewis. As with most plans, this one didn’t pan out. The Campground was almost completely full and the few open spots that I *maybe* could have used for a hammock were in a veritable wind tunnel.
So I moved on from there about 4:30 and hiked another 1.2 miles to Bearfence Mountain Hut. Lots of shelter dwellers and tents set up here. Nearly all section hikers from what I gather (they smell better). 


This has been a rough three days out Waynesboro, what with very poor cell connection. So I am sorry if I have worried anybody, but even getting a post up has proven to be beyond me. Better days ahead!","Pinefield Hut
",Bearfence Mountain Hut,"Apr 25, Sun",20.80
Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635684,"It was cooooold last night. I hit my snooze alarm twice and finally started my day at 6:15. There were ice crystals in my water bottle, but I had taken the precaution of putting my water filter in the hammock with me so that wouldn’t freeze and be rendered useless. There were two older section hikers tented near me and they came over as I was packing up to look at my hammock set up. They also informed me that the Skyline restaurant was open if I were heading that far north today. 


I was now!


I got back up to the trail at 7:15 and just a half mile up the first climb I got three att bars for the first time in days. So I stood on the trail and got my journal updated. Chore done!


It was a fantabulous morning on the trail. 37 degrees, sunny, and little to no wind. I took a lot of pictures of the mountains waking up. I availed myself of a short side trail to go to the top ofBearfence mountain. Back at the trail junction I came across Ryan and Easy who I had seen off and on over the last two days. Ryan was ending his 60 mile hike today while Easy is going to Front Royal where he left his car. Those two hike faster than I, but we would usually play leapfrog during the day as they took breaks while I methodically plod along. Plod plod plod, I’m a plodder. 


Crossed over a few 3800 footers today and the tread underneath was very rocky at times. The downhills have been particularly vexing for me the last few days as I had injured my right foot on Friday. What had happened is that I was going down a steep incline and had about a 24” step down from a boulder, I had planted my left trekking pole into leaves and soft ground so I stepped down with my right foot directly onto a large hidden rock with a nasty point. Ay carumba, that stung more than a little. So now the outer arch on that foot is bruised and very tender. I have to be very deliberate with where I place it, but you can only do so much. My left foot is left to fend for itself. 


So I rolled into the Skyline Resort about 2:45 and ordered a beer (so so) a burger (not bad) and their signature Blueberry Ice Cream Pie (oh, momma). I couldn’t finish dessert. I should have remembered my mother inlaws advice and eaten that first before filling up on the non-essentials. 


I debated staying at the resort, but rooms start at $150 which is a lot in bum parlance. So, I hiked on.


A short while later I came across three guys backpacking together just as they were giving directions to a lost hiker. As we were consulting maps and chatting it came out that the young lady was from LA. One of the guys lived in LA for a few years, about 3 miles from where she had lived. She asked where they were from. They said “New York”, she asked where? They said “Brooklyn”.  She said where?  Turns out she’s rented an apartment for two years about 1 block away from where these three friends live. It’s a small, weird world sometimes. 


I hiked on, not intending to go much further than the 16 miles a had already gone. But I couldn’t find any sites that I liked. There was another Hut about six miles away, but that didn’t seem in my range, given the trail. As I passed through a picnic area who should I see cooking dinner at a table? Easy. He told me he was too tired to move on and was going to chance camping against park rules at the picnic area. Sounded like a plan to me, so I hiked another quarter mile and picked a spot for the night. 


So I’m currently camped at about 3400 feet on a ridge looking out to the west in a sweeping vista. Pretty cool. Not supposed to get quite as cold tonight. So I’m hoping for an early start in the morning. Warm temps are coming.","Bearfence Mountain Hut
","Random Ridge, Va","Apr 26, Mon",20.43
Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635804,"Well, the cold did hold off, but the wind announced it’s presence with authority about 9:30. It blew hard enough coming up the ridge that I was really concerned my stakes and guylines would come loose. Then I started to wonder if I had sufficiently battened down all my ancillary gear and tchotchkes attached to my pack. Lastly I schemed on and off through the night about how I’d manage to pack up in the morning without having something of mine fly off the mountain and end up in Maryland.  As with most worries, all were unfounded and I survived the night and packed up just fine, though a bit wind battered. 

I got an early start partly due to the wind and partly to wanting to get some miles in before it heated up into the upper 70’s. First climb of the day was up to Mary’s Rock. There was a .2 mile side trail to the summit that I elected to take on the off chance a fellow Papist named the mountain and I’d get a chit to play with St Peter when I have to face him and account for myself. “Well, yes, I know I took the lord’s name in vain 52,972 times...but I did climb Mary’s Rock! And those miles didn’t even count!!”

I spent the first hour or so really nursing my right foot along. I must’ve looked like Fred Sanford stumbling around about to have the big one. (The great thing about making references to TV shows that aired 40 years ago is that some people get it, some watched them in reruns 20 years ago and get it, and the youngsters can Google it. Everyone wins). But by and by I loosened up and as long as I wasn’t going downhill, everything was copacetic. 

I took a short break about two hours in when the trail went by a rest area off the Skyline. I spent 10 minutes just repeatedly flushing a toilet for the shear joy of it, tears silently coursing down my face. Then I washed my hands for a good five minutes and rounded out my revelry by dunking my head under the faucet. Bum shower!


Hopscotched around a hiker named Larry who is out sectioning, I pretty much knew that if I caught him it was because he had cell reception and was taking a phone break. 

Big happy happenstance today was getting to the Elk Wallow wayside about 1 pm and seeing four familiar faces. Easy, who I’ve hiked around for a few days. Trail Mix, who I had met my first day on the trail at a shelter and whom I hadn’t seen since. Slippers, with whom (yeah, I just whomed y’all twice) I shared my first shuttle ride into Glasgow. And Polka Dot, who was at the Glasgow hostel the second night I stayed. It’s been two weeks since I saw someone I recognized from earlier on the trail and then saw three at once. 


 I splurged on bought an unsweetened black tee and a 12 oz Diet Coke- no rules!!  The others were sitting at a picnic table eating chips, cookies, and ice cream bars. They wondered if I didn’t see that they sold “trail food”.  I answered that you don’t get a body like mine by eating junk food. You get it by eating stress!
30 minutes later and I started the last major climb of the day l, a two miler that went up roughly 1100 feet. It was hot, but I actually got into a nice plod plod plod (with a little moseying tossed in) up to the summit. It was the long downhill that reacquainted me with my pains and led to me calling it a day about 4:45. 

I’m at Gravel Springs Hut waaaaay up on a hill (in order to find hammockable trees). Nice group of 6 or 7 people here tonight including Easy, who ends his section hike tomorrow. Also here is Songbird who is a flip-flopper and is hiking towards Maine while her husband drives their van-life home along the trail, staying at national parks and the like. 

There is such a wide variety of people out here, it’s amazing. There’s an equally wide variety of reasons that they are hiking. The great equalizer is the trail, we are all walking it.
Tomorrow I will hopefully be getting my replacement pack which has arrived at the Stumble Inn Hostel in Front Royal. I’ll have the option of hiking 13 miles to get picked up or hiking 21 miles for pick up. I’ll let how I feel and the heat dictate what happens. 


I wouldn’t have guessed I’d hike the Shenandoah National Park in 6 days, but the steps just take me where they will. 

I can begin to see the end of Virginia, I don’t plan to zero in Front Royal, just handle my pack business, do a light food resupply, and move on towards Harpers Ferry. 

Be well!","Random Ridge, Va
",Gravel Springs Hut,"Apr 27, Tue",19.77
Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635812,"Last night was so warm I didn’t know what to do with myself. To date, when I climb in for the night I’m wearing two pairs of sox, merino wool bottom layer, a pair of shorts, a merino wool t-shirt, I fleece jacket, and my winter beanie. Then I have my quilt liner, my 40 degree top quilt and my 30 degree under quilt. Then I put my foam sit pad in the hammock that goes from my knees to my feet for extra insulation. 


Last night it only got down to 63 degrees. So I went with sox, shorts, t-shirt and quilt liner with the bottom quilt in place. About 11 I grabbed my top quilt as well to keep the chill off. What a difference two days makes. 


Before bed I was talking with a few of the hikers, one guy who hiked on late who’s name I didn’t catch said he planned on doing the Four State Challenge. This is where you start in Virginia, hike the short miles of West Virginia, then hike all of Maryland into Pennsylvania- roughly 44 miles. You do that all in one day. 


Out. 


I packed up early and was back on the trail a little after 6. Temps would approach 90 and I wanted to get some miles in before it got hot. About 45 minutes in a got passed like I was standing still (which, technically I was, because I stepped out of the way) by the hiker who was going to do the Four State Challenge. He looked like a Norwegian cross country Olympian as he strode past. I think he can do the mileage. 


Later on Easy came past me for the last time. We chatted for a few minutes about hammock vs tent and then he was on his way to where his car was parked. He was one of those guys who just exudes “good dude” vibes.  


Sadly, there was only one major climb for the day and that was right at the start where we went up to 3400 feet then it was 9 miles down to Front Royal. I deftly managed to step down with my sore foot right onto a tree root - hachimama, that did sting. Came across my second trail magic as well: a cooler at a road crossing filled with juice, fruit, granola bars and water. Can you guess which one I had?


By noon I had 12 miles in (a 12x12, the cool hikers tell me) and made the decision to only do a 13.5 mile day and not push on another 8. I called the Hostel and got a shuttle from the trail. The Stumble Inn is very, very nice and was just opened this year by two former thru hikers.  My replacement pack was waiting for me and I spent 45 minutes swapping over belt pouches, side pockets, clips, water bottle holder and other accoutrements. The problem area with the suspension appear to be redesigned and instead of a netted outside back pouch it has more of a stretch mesh. Seems to be ok?  Trail time will tell.Most hostels have a thing called a “hiker box” where unwanted items are left for other hikers to use. I scored six packets of tuna, half a roll of TP, some apple cinnamon oatmeal (which I promptly ate) and a sugar free drink mix. Bum Christmas!  


I think I’m going to do a short 8 miles tomorrow after icing my foot tonight and then stay at the hostel one more night and rest and ice some more. This will hopefully give time for my second pair of shoes to get to Harpers Ferry before I do. My Altra Lone Peak trail runners were great on my training hikes in Michigan, but these rocks and mountains are a wee bit different. So I’ll try a heavier trail shoe and see how it goes.","Gravel Springs Hut

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635886,"As per yesterday’s thoughts, I went ahead and did an 8 mile hike today from the west side of Front Royal to the east side. There were five of us who got dropped off for this slack pack: myself, Brian and Matt who are friends and southbound flip flippers from Pennsylvania.  And then a married couple - the Hurries. (He’s Inna Hurry, she’s Inno Hurry). The Hurries are also flippers who started their hike about 2 miles from where I began mine. 


The hostel owners Danielle and David recommended this hike as an easy 8 miles to do and they were correct. There were only a few stretches that were rocky and requiring my full attention. I’ve taken to calling my right foot Dudley Dursley and my left foot Harry Potter. I shower love and attention on Dudley diddims and look out for its every need and want while metaphorically shoving my left foot into the cupboard under the stairs to fend for itself. The analogy does fall apart in that my left foot has no cool lightning scar and shown no innate magical abilities, unless you count being able to avoid injury (so far - I shan’t tempt fate!).


Hiked with Brian and Matt and talked a lot of beer. Both have a highly refined taste in beer (meaning it matches mine) and Brian works at the Tattered Flag Brewery in Hershey, Pennsylvania. It’s brewery started by a veteran for veterans, which Brian is. Pretty Cool. Between the two of them in their years of service to our country they seemingly have visited half the globe. 


We completed the miles in just under four hours and sat talking until the Hurries arrived an hour later, then back to the hostel. So that’s it for today’s hiking. My sweet little Dudley did ok (he’s just so special!) and is feeling much improved. Tomorrow I set off for Harpers Ferry WVa. 


Q and A: (from a few I’ve received)


Q: Has anything surprised you so far?A: Yes: how quickly I’ve become used to backwoods privies. 


Q: Do you think you’ll stay on trail?A: That’s my intention. My Wife and family are beyond awesome in their support and coaching, so if I can stay healthy and life doesn’t intervene, I’m walking on. 


Q: Have you seen any hippies?A: Only when I look in the mirror. 


Q: How much time do you spend studying the trail ahead?A: Not much. I look (if I remember) at the water situation for the day and maybe Towns that are ahead for resupply, but I really don’t look too much at the trail elevations or read comments from hikers about what to expect. I mean, it’s the trail, I can’t change it, just move along as best I can. 


Q: Is this really Fine?A: This is fine.","US Rte 522

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635981,"Checking in late yesterday afternoon were three hikers who all started in Georgia. Whisper just retired from the army, Cheesecurd is from Wisconsin and looks young enough to make you mad, and Santa: who got that trail name for giving away extra things he didn’t need but who is only 19. I may have mentioned that every year I pick a few hikers on trailjournals to follow and Santa was one of my 8!  It was trippy to meet him. 


So I went full nerd and had breakfast at the hostel for the second straight day, as the honorary Dutchman in me won out over the fussy pedant that usually makes my decisions. For $5 we got sausage gravy over a massive biscuit, hash brown casserole, and scrambled eggs along with all the coffee you wanted. That’s $5 well spent. 


Today was a tale of three hikes. Started off by climbing out of Front Royal at 8:45 into a sea of wild flowers and trees in full leaf. I saw pink azaleas, white and pink trillium, yellow buttercups and purple violets by the bushel. The first nine miles flew by in gorgeous weather. Then after one o’clock, the winds picked up and I went through a kind of depressing section of trail through an area of tangled underbrush with dead trees being chocked by vines. It was weird and a little disconcerting.  This was mostly near Sky Meadows State Park. I’ll just charitably assume the trail went through the most boring part of the park and not that Virginia is into showcasing hellscapes. 
The last part of the hike is where the sphincter factor went to 9.3 on a 10 point scale. I knew I’d be entering a section of trail referred to as “The Roller Coaster” where you go up a steep incline, then down a steep incline, then up, then down and so on and so on. I also knew that high winds were going to be around until the wee hours and that rain was likely as well from 4 until 7. Well, everything arrived as promised.

I had a chance to finish hiking early around 2:30 near a shelter, but had heard there was a lot of dead trees and widow makers in that area. So (stop me if you’ve heard this before) I pressed on, hiking further than I had planned. What I failed to take into account was how these ridges and hills compress the wind and make it a terror. Depending on the wind direction and what side of the ridge you are on, you can hiking in a placid calm or watching trees whip around wildly while casting off branches like a burlesque dancer with her feathers. If a burlesque dancer were standing in the woods. In the rain  in Virginia  


Walking through this in the rain while huffing uphill or trying not to slip and fall downhill added an exiting element to the festivities!  I heard several large trees crack and go down. The trail was strewn with branches, sticks, leaves and assorted tree trash. I’d occasionally get pelted with bits of bark or twigs. Just before 6pm I heard from ahead the unmistakable rushing sound of a big tree falling. The noise was awesome. 10 minutes later I came to a creak crossing and found two large trees tangled across the trail. I had to bushwhack around them as the trail was impassable, almost running into a small Doe that was just looking at this fat, wet, turtle looking thing floundering about in the brush towards it. 
Then, huzzah! The rain tapered off and a few minutes later the sun was shining. I stumbled into a shelter area and thankfully found some nice young trees with (seemingly) no old nastiest ready to fall on my hammock. I got out of my wet duds and am now cocooned in my quilt, listening to the wind race through the trees one ridge over and praying it stays there.

Today’s tallies:
122.495 flowers
1 large rat snake I nearly stepped on
1 ring snake I shooed off the trail
1 actual turtle messing about a pond

Back at it tomorrow.","Tucker’s Lane
",Sam Moore Shelter,"Apr 30, Fri",22.20
Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636066,"Set up my hammock last night in “storm mode” with the hammock itself lower than normal and the tarp staked almost to the ground.  Quickly got into dry clothes and filtered water for tomorrow then chatted for a while with some hikers out to walk the “roller coaster”.  Then turned in at my new bedtime of 8pm. 


Turns out, though the wind blew hard up on the ridges and you could hear limbs falling, down by the shelter it was calm. Me, Dudley and Harry had a comfy night and slept well. 


It got down to 39 overnight so I made the executive decision to sleep in another hour until 615. I got back on the trail around 715 and immediately saw two downed trees just passed the shelter, another bullet dodged.


Climbed immediately to start the day  and scared a half a dozen deer who ran off further into the woods, but it was a beautiful morning cool but sunny with almost no breeze.


About 3 miles in I came to the Bear’s Den overlook. It’s the best view I’d had since the Shenandoahs. Soon after it was day hiker after day hiker out on the trails. It’s always great to see so many families, friends, dogs, runners and the like out enjoying the trail. Through hikers are vastly outnumbered on the AT as so many people up and down it’s length access it to get out into the woods. 


For the next 3 or 4 miles until the Raven Rocks overlook I probably came across 100 hikers. I say “came across”, what I actually mean is “getting passed by good smelling, happy people who climb hills so easily my feelings get constantly crushed”. Seriously, I’m suppose to be Mr Trail Legs by now and then a chirpy 8 year old in a pony tail walking with her grandpa just cruises by me. Humbling doesn’t begin to cover it. 


After Raven Rock the traffic thinned out to about three hikers an hour. Around 11:15 I passed the sign that read “you are exiting the roller coaster”. The 14 miles of Coaster wasn’t as tough as I expected. Some of that may be due to my having hiked the first half in a high state of tension during the storm. I wasn’t really much concerned about the terrain, just watching for that tree with my name on it!


Water being scarce today, I did elect to take a side trail a quarter mile and 250 feet down a mountainside to a water source. I loaded up with 4 liters, adding about 8 pounds to my pack - yikes!  I should mention that I weighed my pack at the Hostel and with three days of food, fuel for my stove, and two liters of water it came to 25.5 lbs. Very happy with that, though I may still go lighter once it warms up for good as I can send some spare clothes home. 


Near the end of the day I did meet two Trail Maintainers: volunteers who take care of a section of the AT. They were out repainting the white blazes that mark the trail and dealing with any small blowdowns or limbs on the trail. The heavy crews should be out soon to deal with the big stuff they needs chainsaws. Without the countless people who volunteer to maintain hiking trails, they’d be all but impassable. Many thanks to those who do so!


I did a third of a mile road walk about two miles shy from where I planned to camp in order to go to a gas station. I bought an Arnold Palmer tea and a bag of pork rinds (did you know pork rinds have 2% of the daily recommended amount of Riboflavin?). Then I went outside and sat in the grass and ate my hiker box tuna (4 pouches) with the tea and pork rinds while being stared at by people pumping gas. Bum dinner!
To show I am no dietary saint, I did duck back inside and bought an ice cream sandwich. 



This is fine  
I did have an elderly lady roll down her window as I was leaving to give me a cheery “Have a good hike!”
Then, road walk back to the trail for the last 2 miles to where I’m currently camped around 20 other people on a ridge about 4.5 miles outside Harpers Ferry, WVa. One of those times I’m super happy to be the lone hammock guy as the tenters are dealing with sloping ground and/or a lot of rocks. 


I plan on rolling out early tomorrow to be in town for a few hours, seeing the sights. Then hike out in the afternoon into Maryland where my new shoes should be waiting for me 27 miles up the trail on Monday.Addendum:  I should add that the replacement pack is working well so far and that my right foot is a little better than it was. Two days of icing and an 8 mile slack pack sure helped.","Sam Moore Shelter

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636156,"I was camped about 40 yards away from some teenage Boy Scouts last night. As I lay in my hammock around 7:30pm writing a journal entry I heard their troop leader come over from where he was camped to bring a shovel and have the lads dig a group latrine a little ways down the hill. They trooped (scouted?) off to do so. Around 11:30 I woke to cries of dismay; apparently one of the boys went to use their group cat hole and stepped in it by accident. I’m not sure they have a badge for that, but his trail name should be a memorable one. 


Up at 5:30 to pack and head into Harpers Ferry. I had 2.7 miles to town but the trail wreaked havoc on my feet. Sharp stones, roots and lots of down down down left me limping the last mile over the bridge and into town. About 7/10ths of a mile from downtown there was a side trail that goes to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy Headquarters: the home of the AT. Now, I knew that the center was closed (opinion alert: due to shortsighted Covid rules) but it’s kinda obligatory to take your picture there. I dallied for 5 minutes trying to decide if I wanted to climb the hill. Finally, I climbed. So 20 minutes later I staggered to their building and met 4 hikers on the sidewalk: Viking Man, Tall Boy, Not Yet, and Wicked. They had all started in Georgia and were nearing the halfway point of their trek. They were kind enough to take my picture and then mean enough to leave me in their dust going back to the trail and then town. 


When I got downtown I posted up in a coffee shop to try and decide what to do. I really didn’t think I had miles in my feet today. I got a large coffee with a large amount of cream and a roast beef breadless sandwich - so basically a pile of roast beef with onions, lettuce and horseradish. Do I take a zero and maybe find a shuttle to drive to pick up a package on Monday and drive me back? Or just stay the night and hike out Monday and pick up my new shoes 32 miles up trail on Tuesday?  I had another coffee and then some chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream to think on what to do. The ice cream didn’t help me decide, but it didn’t hurt either.  


After an hour and a half of more wafflind a decision was reached: I loaded up and walked out of town. 


(Side note, Harpers Ferry is a fascinating place to visit. Thomas Jefferson, Lewis and Clark, John Brown, Civil War history, the second  Niagara conference, hiking, biking, touring - there’s a lot to see here).


So I crossed the bridge into Maryland and...blisssssssssssssssss. Nearly three miles of flat walking on the cinder towpath next to the C&O Canal.  Potomac River on the right, canal and flowers and turtles (I stopped counting them when I hit 100), bikers and joggers galore, it was just the walk I needed. 




The trail eventually left the towpath and climbed a few hundred feet into more bliss. 80% of the trail I walked in Maryland today was soft forest floor or large flat rocks almost like paving stones. Apparently the trail builders in Maryland didn’t get the memo that they were supposed to dig up the rocks and stand them pointy end up like on the rest of the trail, you know, as a challenge!The other 20% of the trail did have rocky sections, mainly when crossing up and over a ridge. But like an attentive waiter who notices a smudge on your knife and quickly and apologetically getting a replacement, the trail would eschew the rocks and get you back to smoothed walking.So, I walked. 


I did come across trail magic where the trail crossed through a state park. A couple by the name of O’Donnell had water, cokes, and sandwiches for hikers. I gratefully took a soda but passed on the sandwich. I had already eaten once today, and you don’t want to push these things. 


I rolled into a backpackers campground about 6:30 to get set up for the night. There are actually flush toilets and showers here. After some more internal debate, I went to take a shower, letting it run for a few minutes until the spiders had either fled or drowned. I did find my right heal had sneakily formed it’s third blister since I started hiking, so I lanced that baby before turning in. 


Two things on tomorrow’s agenda: a lot of rain (reportedly) and a package (hopefully) including new shoes waiting 15 miles up trail. I have until 4:30 to get to Smithsburg, Md before the post office closes. 


Promises to be an...interesting day.","
",Dahlgren Backpack Campground ,"May 02, Sun",21.40
Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636240,"Today we were promised rain starting at 7 am, but being a “trust but verify” child of the Reagan years, I set my alarm for 5 am anyway. Sure enough, when I woke the weather prognostication had changed to rain by 5:30. I practiced a wet pack up anyway and had everything secured and stored by the time the rain hit.  


My goal for today was about 13 miles away on the form of Smithsburg, Md where my package was scheduled to arrive. I started out uphill in the rain and about a quarter mile later came to a road crossing where there was also a bar and restaurant, which helped explain the rather giddy hikers who came staggering back into camp about 9pm the previous night. 



The first sight of the day was the Washington Monument.No, not that one, the original one. A squatish stone structure that local Marylandganders (I just made that up. I hate the term “Michigander” I’m a Michiganian) erected in the early 1800’s. You can see the outside of it, but the inside remains closed due to Covid apparently being super transmittable on federal property.I took a few rainy pictures and marched on. 


I did have on my rain gear today, more to try it out than anything else. Rain gear tends to have limited functionality when hiking because you sweat so much inside it you might as well be rained upon. I did look particularly stylish in my plum colored Marmot jacket and gray Enlightened Equipment rain kilt, if I do say so myself. 


Around 9 or so I had stopped to talk to two hikers when Santa (who I had last seen at the hostel in Front Royal) came cruising past. He had started the four state challenge at midnight and was nearly halfway done with the trek. I did not see Cheesecurds with him, so perhaps he had decided against the endeavor. The other hiker who I had met in Shenandoah who was going to do the challenge was named “Skeletor” (thanks, Easy!) which I should have guessed as his power was beyond my understanding. 


I contemplated my shoes as I walked some more nice Maryland trail. I didn’t want to leave you, dear reader, with the idea I hadn’t tried out my Altra Lone Peak 4.5’s before hitting the trail.  No indeed! I had about 100 miles on the pair I’m wearing, only the miles I had were Michiganian miles of mostly flat terrain and sandy soil. To their credit, the Lone Peaks have caused no toe issues, have had a sure grip, and were cheap at $65 for a pair. But the heal blisters and the overall feel just aren’t getting it done, so, we’ll try something new. 


I think that some Maryland trail builders may have read yesterday’s journal post and took offense to my calling their trail soft. Because I think they went out last night and installed about half a mile of the trickiest rock scramble I’ve come across to date. The rain didn’t help matters, but the rocks were quite something. Some half the size of me (and I’m no slight lad) would shift or move when stepped upon and you just had to keep moving. So to clarify: my classifying Maryland trail as soft was a compliment and was not meant pejoratively!


I got to the road that goes to Smithsburg at noon - so 13 miles in 6 hours was pretty good. The two mile road walk into town was less so. Called the post office as I was walking in and...no package yet. But “it could still arrive today”. So, continue to town. Once I arrived the post office was closed until 2 and the only restaurant in town isn’t open on Mondays. So I followed my nose to a store/deli called the Trailside Kitchen. It was really unique, run by Mennonites, and filled with home made bread, snacks, candy and other baked goods. And the deli counter had a special: 4 pieces of chicken for $7.95, in!  They let me sit at an inside table due to the rain. The chicken was fantastic and the people even nicer. 


Tried back at the post office after they reopened and still no package. The clerk was very helpful and said it would likely arrive after they closed. More punches to roll with. 



This is fine. I booked a cheap hotel room in Hagerstown that was 15 miles away and I wasn’t going to walk that if I could help it. Uber and Lyft weren’t an option this afternoon with no drivers available. So I called a cab company, gave them an address where I was standing and they said “see you in an hour or so”. While waiting, I did have a kindly older local man offer to give me a ride, but as he had just come out of the bar, I politely declined. 


90 minutes later a early 2000’s Crown Vic painted puke green pulled up. My chariot!  But rather than go to the hotel, we made a side trip to pick up another fare who needed a ride to the grocery store. More experiences!  The woman who needed the ride walked out her front door talking and didn’t stop even after being dropped at the store 10 minutes later. It wasn’t so bad, she really didn’t require a conversation partner, just some oxygen and off she’d go. The cab driver told me they had been crazy busy all day, as they always are the first Monday of the month as that is when people get their relief checks. 



The things you learn  
Checked in at the hotel and started to do some laundry in the sink when my friend Mike informed me that according to the hotel website, they had laundry facilities here. I went back to the lobby and saw I had walked right past the GUEST LAUNDRY ROOM sign without noticing. This may be a trend. So, emptied the sink and shame-walked back and did a load of laundry the first-world way. My room also had a microwave so I heated some water and cooked one of my trail meals! (Coconut curry chicken - meh)


Maybe the package being a day late wasn’t the worst luck, as there were severe thunderstorm warnings and a tornado warning nearby as well. 


I’ve got a ride booked back to Smithsburg at 9:30 tomorrow morning and as soon as I get my new shoes, it’s a road walk back to the trail and move on north.

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636316,"When you put your plans in the hands of the federal government, expect your plans to go awry. So, guaranteed Monday delivery means...maybe Wednesday?


So, going forward I need to fine tune my OODA loop so the government can’t get inside it. Ship further ahead, or go with UPS. 


Not knowing if the delivery would show today, I caught an Uber into Smithsburg at 9:45 to see what was what. What was what was no delivery last night. “It might come in today” was the best I could get (totally not blaming the Postal workers, they don’t control what shows up and have been very kind and helpful). So, I walked to Dixies Diner and sat down to a lot of coffee, a side of bacon, and a cinnamon roll. Seriously, they have a large commercial bakery in Smithsburg and the whole downtown smells like cinnamon rolls all day. It’s irresistible, at least for those of us not prone to resistance. 


I stretched out the coffee for as long as I could manage - 90 minutes - then moved outside to a bench and did Duolingo Spanish lessons for another 90 minutes. (Hay una nevera nueva en la cocina!)
The Mennonite grocery/deli had a sign board announcing that every Tuesday is Soft Pretzel day. As every fan of “The Office” knows, pretzel day is the best day of the year. So I went in and got a $2 soft pretzel fresh out of the oven and talked to the store manager again, everyone seems more disappointed that my package hasn’t arrived than I am! Of course, I don’t discount the possibility that my presence may be bringing down property values and they want shut of me, and that right now. 


Walked across town to Dollar General for some down market window shopping and bought a few things for a total of $6.93. One of the things I bought was a new one liter smart water bottle. The one I have I had stupidly peeled the label off for reasons that aren’t even clear to me. Consequently, it would no longer slide nicely into my shoulder strap water bottle pouch, it would stick. My solution for the last two weeks was to take a plastic glove and slide it up over the base of the bottle, with the finger holes on the bottom. Resulting in a water bottle that roughly resembled a cows udder. 


So that’s remedied. 


Decided to walk back across town to the library (post office reopens at 2). I walked through some charming old neighborhoods and when passing a very nicely kept white house, someone said from the front porch: “weren’t you at the diner this morning?” Ended up chatting with this nice elderly couple from the diner who had noticed my backpack both there and here in front of their house. (Backpacks are a great icebreaker, at least with the elderly, not saying it’s the key to scoring with the opposite sex, not that I’m trying to score mind you, but, well...better end this parenthetical while there’s still an exit ramp) (Also, I walked about 8 miles today WITH a full pack. So a zero, but not a slack pack, and no miles on the trail. *sigh*). Turns out the lady grew up in Rhode Island, just like my friend Mike’s mom and I had been texting with Mike when she hailed me from her porch. Small, weird world. She and her husband had also lived in Maine for many years and were very familiar with the AT. She did tell me not to judge northeasteners, as they aren’t unfriendly, just reserved. We parted acquaintances. 


Near the library I saw the city cemetery. Score. I love wandering though old cemeteries and trying to read the history of an area through the names, dates, epithets, and headstones. But every once in a while you see something that just hits hard. I saw one family plot where between 1898 and 1904 they buried four children, none older than two years old. What a different world we thankfully live in. 


It was now 2:30. Call to the post office, no package. Time to make a decision. I had planned to take a zero day later this week, so I moved it up to today. My friend Mike awesomely offered to shoot me some of his hotel points and get a room for the night. I don’t deserve the friends I have. I went to the library to kill some time juuuust in case my shoes arrived before the post office closes at 4:30. I found a book on the civil war battles of South Mountain and Antietam and sat down to read, as I had just walked up and over South Mountain on Sunday. 


So, time was killed and package didn’t arrive before the post office closed. I got an Uber back to Hagerstown for the night. I’m currently eating Peruvian Brasas pollo and rice from a local joint (I highly recommend Peruvian food) and drinking hotel room coffee. 


Plan for Wednesday is to go to the post office in the morning at 9. If no box, I’ll see if they can forward it up trail when it arrives and hike on.

So I took my fourth taxi/Uber in two days back to Ye Olde Poste Office in Smithsburg only to strike out again: no package. They had one more delivery to check in so I waited in the lobby as it rained. About 5 minutes later I see a hiker walking up to the door. She went to the counter and picked up a package that had been sent here for her. New shoes. 


I was happy for her. Ecstatic.  Giddy even. I revel in others triumphs. As long as one of us had new shoes I was content. This is fine.  


But really, the poor lass came in wearing her camp shoes because the shoes she had been hiking in were too small and she had the sores to prove it. I bestowed upon her my hard won knowledge of all things Smithsburg and she went on her way. 


Last delivery checked in: no package. They checked my tracking number again and it still showed the box was in Baltimore where it had been since Saturday. They kindly offered to forward it up trail once it arrives, but when questioned they said it would have to be routed back through the Baltimore hub I gave them my cell number and they’ll call me when they have it so I can decide what to do.


It was about this time I realized my glasses were not in there spot on the outside of my pack. Back at the hotel as I was leaving, another guest had run into me with one of these suitcase caddies you see at hotels. His was so loaded he didn’t see me in the vestibule. Thinking back, I wondered if they popped out there. So I called the hotel and they did have them turned in at the desk. They are mailing them to me (uh oh) about 90 miles up trail to a spot I picked. Here we go again. So please forgive any grammatical errors or misspellings for the near future. My phone is a little...fuzzy. 


So, time to head out for the 2 mile road walk back to the trail. About one half mile in at a road crossing I saw a handful of nails in the road. 30 seconds later, I turned around and walked back saying to myself “clearing those out of the road will put some good karma into the world.” So that’s what I did, collected them up and put them off the roadway. Not 1/4 mile later a Ford Ranger was coming down the mountain and slowed, then made a u-turn. Up pulls Slippers! I hadn’t seen him since Shenandoah! He’s been using his truck (stored at his brothers place near Harpers Ferry) to slack pack the last few days with Sweetcorn. He said: “need a ride to the trail?” I said “does the post office have my package?”  And off we went and he dropped me at 11am. Too cool. 



The rain had stopped by now but was failing heavily off the trees. The birds were all in full throat after the storm and the woods were lively. I saw two new flowers - wild geranium and pink lady slipper. Then I met a SOBO section hiker named Sugar Bear and chatted with him for a bit. It was very nice to be walking back on the trail after almost 48 hours.
About an hour later a came to a rain swollen creek that had spilled its banks pretty significantly. Sugar Bear had said he was able to ford across, so I waited 5 minutes just to watch and make sure the water level wasn’t rising precipitously. Once I felt sure, I used my trekking poles and legs to slowly cross the knee high creek, always keeping three points in contact with the creek bottom. 



Then about 30 minutes after that I got caught out in a 15 minute deluge of rain. It hit so fast I didn’t even have time to grab my rain jacket. At least my shirt and shorts now matched my socks and shoes.
Just after the rain a saw a Tahquamenon (Chipmunk, in the common tongue) sitting on a fallen log, regarding me with what I read as indifference. We just looked at one another for a few beats, but as soon as I made a move for my camera, he was gone. Chipmunks don’t cotton to the paparazzi. 



Three hours and one long and tricky boulder descent later and I crossed the Mason/Dixon line into Pennsylvania. Two states now completed.
I intended to hike about 14 miles on this short day, but then I arrived at the target shelter at 6 pm it was very, very sketchy to my eye and there was nobody there. Just a lot of non thru hiker trash in the fire pit. 


No bueno. 


I kicked into my fastest hiking gear and made for the shelter were I am right now which was another 4 miles up trail. Though I couldn’t find quite the right trees from which to hang, so I’m making the best of what I gave here. Said hi to some thru hikers I haven’t yet met and crawled into my less than ideal hammock hang.

There were flowers at the covered picnic table and the privy was fully stocked with 2-ply toilet paper. TWO PLY!!!! 


It was 38 degrees when my alarm went off so I opted to stay lazy and warm in my quilt for another half hour. After packing up I was on the trail at 6:45. There were a few somewhat technical boulder scrambles early in the day and more than few “ouchy” moments (Dudley still demands attention but Harry is back for the holidays with troubles of his own), but by and large the trail was pretty kind today. 


I kept checking on my delivery status for the ongoing Saga Of My Lost Shoes. About midday there was an update that the package was at the Frederick, Md post office - which is not where it was supposed to be delivered. Current plan is to just send that box back home and hopefully find some new kicks either in Boiling Springs, Pa on Saturday or Carlisle, Pa on Sunday.

This is fine  
I had 10 miles in by 11:30 and came to a road crossing. The Guthooks AT app listed a burger joint .9 miles down the road. I should note that included with my shoes was three days of food resupply. So I was down to roughly 2500 calories in my food bag. As I contemplated, two other hikers emerged from the woods and we all decided to make the road walk. One hiker is called Happy (he’s vlogging on YouTube) who started in Georgia in January and the other was Grumpy Cat who I met back in Glasgow, Va. GC has been on trail 75 days and is just shy of halfway. I had a double cheeseburger that was not bad and not great and some cold fries. All in all: acceptable is acceptable. 



The road walk was actually only .4 of a mile, so the walk back to the trail 90 minutes later only took 10 minutes.
I met one couple out day hiking who highly recommended that when I get to Vermont, just across the river from Dartmouth college, that I take a side trip to the King Arthur Flour headquarters and eat at the company store/deli. So noted. They told me their son lives in New Hampshire and has as a goal to trail run all the presidential range in every season of the year. I asked which one of them was responsible for producing such a wacko, and she immediately pointed to her husband, he just slowly nodded. 


For the first time in a few weeks, I decided to call an early end to the day’s hike at 5pm. I wanted a leisurely set up and to rest my feet a bit before the cold rains arrive tomorrow morning. I ate a 400 calorie dinner and talked with Grumpy Cat, Happy, and another hiker called Skippy who will all hit the halfway point of their hikes tomorrow. Quite a feat.

Hikers had been talking about getting to Pine Grove Furnace State  Park and their famous “half gallon challenge” for thru hikers: eat an entire half gallon of ice cream in one sitting and it’s free. When I got to the park’s general store at 10 am, it was not yet open. A few hikers were planning to do a short day and stay at the hostel next door, but I decided not to wait (50 and rain doesn’t strike me as ice cream weather) and I was itching to get some miles in. So onward I went.  I passed a couple of section hikers just outside the state park, but then didn’t see anyone for the rest of the day. I did get a phone call from Smithsburg that my shoes had arrived!

I shared the bench with a section hiker who thru hiked back in 2008 when he turned 60 and a flip flopper who lived just a few miles away and decided to head home for a few days to get out of the cold and rain. Had a good conversation with the SH for about an hour while he waited for his ride  he did give me a heads up that the next 5 miles of trail had some very tough rock climbs. Back on the trail, the rain really started to come down. I kept my rain jacket on more for warmth than to keep dry. The rocks were very slick but the climbs were hella fun!  A few times I had to chuck my trekking poles up above me onto a rock ledge and hoist myself up. I’m just daft enough to think this was made better by the rain fall. I’m now trying to get warm whilst laying in my hammock and listening to the rain hit my tarp. I did manage to get everything set up while keeping my gear dry, a victory I will relish!  The toughest thing about writing these entries is that my hands turn to ice. Maybe someday, spring will arrive.","Birch Run Shelter

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636628,"So I had rolled into the Kennedy Shelter last night about 6 when the rain was still insistently coming down. I selected poorly on my first attempt to set up my tarp - trees were too close. So I moved to a better spot, got the tarp set up and managed to keep my hammock and gear dry as well.I didn’t leap up at 5:15 when my alarm went off, thinking “it’s 38 degrees, I’m good here for a bit”. But nature was calling, and then it called a little more persistently, so up I got. Now, it’s very important to always make sure you have dry clothes to change into at the end of the day (hypothermia is a cool word, though NOT a desirable condition). There was more rain on the forecast for the day,  Soooooo, I put on my still wet, 38 degree clothes from the day before. Yeesh. I did balk at putting on my sodden hiking shirt, opting to just wear my sleep t-shirt as I have one other back up. That was a bridge too far for me. Cold cold cold.I collected my food bag from the bear box by the shelter as I left camp at 6:30 making for Boiling Springs, Pa and the TCO Outfitters store. It started raining about a mile from town as I was walking through Pennsylvania farm fields so my shoes and socks were pool-wet in about 60 seconds. When I got to town the outfitters were 45 minutes from being open so I went to a nearby cafe for a coffee. They had outside seating only (did I mention it was COLD AND RAINING?!?) that I shared with a fellow hiker named No Bad - as in No Bad Days. He started in Rockfish Gap/Waynesboro, Va and has been doing a lot of miles.  The outfitter was mainly geared towards fly fishing, but they did have some hiking supplies. I managed to find a pair of Oboz hiking shoes in my size after trying on some Solomon’s that were waaay too tight in the heel. My wife had provided good counsel, as usual, and said if I found an acceptable pair to get them and try them for a week until I hike to my mailed pair. Then I can make the call on which to keep. Left town at 9:45 moving towards Carlisle, Pa where I had decided to grab a hotel room. I hadn’t done laundry in 5 days or showered in 4 and I really didn’t think it wise to big miles the first day in new shoes. Met a few other NOBO’s on the way - probably the most I’ve met on the trail in one day so far. The new shoes paid immediate dividends in that stepping on a root or rock didn’t cause me to buckle with pain. Check back in a few days and see if all my toenails fall off or some other such horror from new shoes.  I got to the Carlisle road crossing at 12:30 and got a Lyft for $7.00 to my hotel. Took care of chores, bought a lot of iced tea at the gas station next store and did something very, very rare for me: I actually turned on the heat in the hotel room. AaaahhhhhhhhhOf course, it suppose to rain from tomorrow noon until Monday morning *sigh* - dry for a day at least!In case I don’t have cell signal tomorrow- Happy Mother’s Day to my Mom who is to blame for all my failures and short comings (did I do that correctly, Dr Freud?) so send any critical comments regarding me, to her. And also Happy Mother’s Day to my wife, without whom this hike would not be possible. Treat her well, kiddos!","Alec Kennedy Shelter
","Carlisle, Pa","May 08, Sat",11.80
Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636709,"For the first time in a while I had a hard time falling asleep last night. Probably from the excitement of watching “Bring it On” until 9pm. The hotel I was in was in the bottom 10% of the Holiday Inn Express hotels I’ve been in, but the bed was very comfortable. Unfortunately, the shower didn’t drain well and I had to spot-clean areas of my temple 30 seconds at a time. Why didn’t I switch rooms, you might ask? I had already unpacked and laid out every piece of gear I owned and didn’t want to pack it back up to move rooms. This is fine  
Scheduled an Uber for 7:30 am pickup last night and then as I was sitting in the lobby at 7:40 am the driver cancelled the ride. Tried again and no dice with either ride share app. So at 8:15 I gathered my things and started the three mile road walk back to the trail. Not the ideal way to continue breaking in my new shoes, but, ah well...the best laid plans. I showed some degree of restraint as I walked past a McDonald’s and two donut shops and tarried not. 


By 9:15 I was back on the trail and walking through more bucolic Pennsylvania farm fields. Had a few fence stiles (stairs built over a fence, for the uninitiated) to clamber over but alas! No cows in the fields!  Cows are the deer of domesticated animals and I was hoping to have a bovine encounter, to no avail!


Early in the hike I crossed paths with a SOBO wearing a Detroit Tigers ball cap. I had to ask him: “are you hiking to avoid having to follow them this season?”  As it turned out, he was a section hiker from Grand Rapids and only lives about 25 miles from my home. His daughter lives in this area so he came down to see her and do a few days of backpacking. Before parting we settled on 65 wins as the best case for Detroit this year. 


Roughly 3 miles in and it was back to the woods and hills, leaving farm country behind. About 10:30 rain started to threaten (2 hours earlier than predicted by those paid to predict such things). I took my pack off and stood frozen with indecision: put on my rain jacket and get sweaty or just roll with getting wet?  I decided to roll, so I opened my pack and stored my jacket, then put my pack back on. Then stopped. Took my pack back off, got out the jacket and put it on. Sooooooo glad I did: it never got to the mid 50’s as predicted (by those paid to predict such things) and I would’ve had a heck of a time keeping warm as the rain turned to heavy rain most of the afternoon. As it was, my hands actually got cold when hiking - a very rare occurrence for me. 


Once back into the hills, the rocks came out to play. I’ve got to say, had I not replaced my shoes on my wife’s advice yesterday, I would have been one hurtin’ cowboy today. The rigid soles of my Oboz saved me at least a few dozen “gosh darn”s and a similar number of “fudge!”s.  Although Harry has some issues now with He Who Shall Not Be Named (Lord Ingrown Toenail) that pained me a bit. 


SIDEBAR: 
Why is it we have names for our fingers: pinky, ring, middle, index, thumb - but not for our toes?  I mean, there’s the big and the pinkie, and by default the middle toe, but not the others?  100 centuries of language and this hasn’t been worked out yet? 


Patient: “Doctor, I think I broke my toe!”
Doctor: “which one?”
Patient: “for the life of me I don’t know what it’s called”


Can we resolve this and come to some kind of naming convention for toes? Working from the inside out: Big, Second, Middle, Clarence, Pinkie?


Patient: “Doctor I think I broke my left Clarence toe”
Doctor: “well let’s have a look!”



hese are the things I think about when I’m hiking in the cold, pouring rain.SIDEBAR ENDED


So Harry’s Clarence toenail had an issue that I’ve corrected, but it was still tender. All in all, the new shoes have been great so far. 


Had one funny encounter with two SOBO day hikers. As I was coming uphill they stopped to allow me pass (trail etiquette) and I caught a bit of their conversation where he said “there was a whole episode about shrinkage” and then she said: “It shrinks?” and I blurted out “like a frightened turtle”.  All this from a Seinfeld episode. They cracked up and so I stopped for a few minutes and we talked about our favorite Seinfeld Episodes. The second one the guy mentioned was when George claimed he was donating money in lieu of gifts to the “Human Fund”. Just the day before I was texting with my sister and referenced that same episode. The world can be very strange when something I hadn’t thought of in a decade pops up in back to back days. 


About 3pm I reached my target camping spot, but even given the road walk I felt it was too soon (and raining too hard) to call it a day. I was 4 miles short of Duncannon, Pa and there’s an...iconic hotel there called The Doyle. I called them up and was told they were closing at 4 but she had one room left and I could knock on her door after 5pm and she’d get me into the room for the night. 


Hikers know about the Doyle. It’s a hotel in the sense that it says “hotel” on their sign, but that’s about where the similarities end. It’s really not much more than a down on it’s luck hiker hostel. But, I’m out on this journey for experiences, not just miles, so I’m in. 


I got to town a little earlier than expected so I grabbed an Arnold Palmer ice tea at the gas station then stopped by an outfitter/hostel. I bought some Spam (don’t judge) and some moleskin for my old blisters. When I talked to the woman at the counter she asked where I was staying, I hesitantly said “The Doyle” and she said that every hiker should stay there once. I asked her if that was her way of saying her hostel was full, she laughed and said “yes”


So, I’m in my room here. It’s roughly 10x10 with a box spring and mattress whose better days have seen better days. There’s a heater on the wall that doesn’t work. I bare light bulb in the ceiling with a pull cord. Various stains on the walls and ceiling that one can only hope are urine. I’ve already got two escape routes planned, should the need arise, and I’m just sleeping in my quilt on top the bedspread (which I have reversed). I certainly believe this will qualify as an “experience” and for the bargain price of $25!


All together now...”This is fine”

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636814,"After yesterday’s miles combined with overnight temps of 39, I was in no hurry this morning and snoozed my alarm for 45 minutes. Gathered up my gear and got to the trail at 6:50. I was just about 30 yards behind three hikers - Roo, Not Yet and Tin man and followed them. We were hiking directly into the rising sun and so missed the turn off for the trail and found ourselves on the Beaver Dam bypass trail. Well, we realized the error and turned around about .4 of mile down the bypass as none of us wanted to turn down the chance to wade through a cold beaver pond!
25 minutes later we had our opportunity. One could try and pick their way over logs and branches and boggy areas and stay kinda dry if you chose well. Some took off their shoes and socks and put on camp shoes (crocs) to keep their stuff dry. I went a different route and just waded right in up to my knees. The cold water was refreshing and the mud was likely good for skin tone!  Out the other side and began a stout little climb for the next hour. 
The trail was its normal mix of rocks, roots and mud, but it was a very pretty morning with some sun and little wind. The normal hikers who pass me, passed me, but a little later I came across Tall Son (his real trail name, not Tall Boy as I had thought) who packs a fly rod with him and was doing some fishing at a river crossing. 
Shortly after I talked to two women out day hiking with their dogs who had just seen a bear on the trail. They didn’t seem to think of themselves as being as lucky as I thought they were. I kept my eyes peeled as I hiked, but alas, the bear was gone. 
Took a short break around 10 and posted yesterday’s journal and then it was up up up for the next hour. Then I did something I hadn’t done in two weeks on the trail: I stopped and used my alcohol stove to cook some lunch. As I looked at the trail ahead, I realized that my long awaited shoe package had arrived in Port Clinton, Pa about 28 miles ahead. So I made a decision: I would hike another 4.5 miles today to the 501 shelter, then hike 17-20 miles Wednesday, setting up my arrival in Port Clinton Thursday when the post office there opens at 12:30. 
What a fortuitous choice this turned out to be!
When I got to Pennsylvania Rte 501, Roo and Tall Son were excitedly pointing at a van in the packaging lot. Fresh Grounds was here. Fresh Grounds is a trail legend, he travels up and down the trail all hiking season, providing meals and support to hikers. I was just hoping to meet him at some point, I didn’t expect what was to come. At the shelter, he took Roo and Wicked and went to a local store. I was having dinner of three low carb granola bars and a protein bar when they walked in with chicken, salads, pork egg rolls, watermelon, deviled eggs, ice cream, cake, cantaloupe, drinks, parfaits, and potato chips. All courtesy of Fresh Grounds. He had only one rule: the 16 of us here had to eat everything. What a throwdown. And it gets better: tomorrow morning he’ll have an all you can eat breakfast ready at first light along with...fresh ground coffee. 
Yes, I’m going full nerd and will try to eat myself sick in the morning!
I should mention, there is a family of seven here at the shelter hiking the trail together, the youngest is roughly 9 years old. They have their dog as well. They are zeroing here as Mom hurt her leg yesterday and they hiked the two miles back here to recuperate. I hope she gets well quickly. 
One last bit of trail magic: the ATC caretaker here was offering free epsom salt hot water foot baths on the porch of his cabin. Good golly, did that soak feel incredible
What an unexpectedly fantastic day.","Rausch Gap Shelter

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636789,"I rolled out of The Doyle this morning at 5:45 for the road walk where the miles count back into the woods. I chose not to shower and risk the yellow on the shower floor was some exiting new entrant into the fun world of fungus. I did contemplate going to the gas station for a cup of coffee, but it was .2 of a mile back the way the trail came in to town. I hate the feeling of going backwards, so I turned left and started the walk out. 


About a mile out of town is the Charles Ferry bridge over the Susquehanna River. To the left I saw a Pilot truck stop and the promise of coffee, but the five lanes of Monday morning traffic that would have to be crossed was too much for this Frogger. Once again, I turned away and crossed the bridge into the woods. 


Although there are no “big” mountains on today’s hike, there were two climbs over 1000 feet and a lot of up and down thrown in (for the day it would add up to 307 flights of stairs).  After the first big climb away from the river, there was a ridge walk/boulder scramble where the wind was fairly strong in the 43 degree overcast. In a word: cold. But that provided me with plenty of motivation to keep moving. 


About 4.5 miles in I passed a shelter area where quite a few hikers spent the night. As I came up, No Bad was just getting on trail. I had shared a table with him in Boiling Springs on Saturday morning and then we both went to the outfitter for some gear. I hiked with him for about an hour, discussing where he lives in southern Arizona and also all things hammock. He gave me a really great tip on how to quickly select the right trees for my set up by extending my trekking poles at arms length to approximate the ideal distance (a tip I used tonight with great results). When No Bad stopped for a break, I continued on. 


I’ve really enjoyed Pennsylvania so far. Yes, it is very rocky and requires a lot of concentration on the trail, but it has also had farms, fields, views, forest walks, fun rock scrambles and the shelters have been nice. My opinion might change radically in the next 115 miles, but so far, I’m a fan. 


Just after 1pm I came to a road crossing and saw in the parking lot 4 hikers (a true tramily) who I had met at the ATC headquarters back in Harpers Ferry. I really didn’t think I’d catch them again as they’ve been on trail since Georgia and and strong hikers. Not 60 minutes later and I was passed by a hiker named Roo who I had met my second night on the trail waaaaay back in Virginia. So it was kind of an old-home day for me. 


My normal standard operating procedure is to take stock of where I am and how I’m feeling around 2 each day, and then pick a potential camping spot for the night. Well, today I decided to go for the Rausch Gap Shelter which was 9 miles ahead. It wasn’t until I got here that I realized I had done 29 miles today. My feet, however, tell me they are well aware we walked that far. 


I did get a calm through to the post office in Pine Grove, Pa to see if my glasses were there. No dice. I then called the hotel back in Hagerstown to make sure they had mailed them out. The conversation didn’t fill me with confidence. I gave them my home address for shipping “just in case they hadn’t been sent yet”. We shall see. 




So it’s now 7:45 and I’m laying in my hammock, typing with cold hands and missing my wife just a wee bit. I don’t think I’ll be posting anything over 20 miles tomorrow. I plan on taking an actual lunch break and throttling back a bit. But, I am constantly at war with myself and which part of me wins this battle remains to be seen.","Duncannon, Pa

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636906,"I started my day with a .3 of a mile limp to the privy near the 501 shelter and a somewhat lighter .3 mile limp back to my camp. I then spent 10 minutes applying mole skin patches and bandaids to both of my big toes, my right pinkie toe, and both heals. Suffice to say that my new shoes have solved one issue but caused others. Oboz? More like Ono’s - amirite?!?I walked back to the road to partake in Fresh Ground’s Leap Frog Cafe breakfast offering. He had eggs, sausage, bacon, potatoes, blueberry pancakes, watermelon, chips, oranges, Oreo cookies and fantastic coffee. It was quite a spread. I showed some moderation so as to actually enable myself to hike today. Again, this is all free and all Fresh Ground wants is happy, stuffed hikers. I knew that I wouldn’t be doing big mileage today due to the post office timing in Port Clinton. I only needed to do 14 or so to set up a short 9 mile hike into town on Thursday. I hiked all day with and around the Trout Family as well as the “Locos” who I had camped with for two nights. Nice people all around, although the Trout family’s dog seemed to take a shine to me That she’s in heat is both hilarious and troubling. For the second straight day I managed to walk into a tree limb dangling over the trail and the rocks were a sore subject (ha!) all day. Then about 1.5 miles from the shelter I was intently watching the jagged, rocky trail and I walked into a tree trunk that blocked part of the path. My stars and garters, did that really hurt. I managed to keep my feet (still haven’t fallen, yet) thsnjs only to my bucket hat saving me from a worse blow. Just shy of the camp there was a gravel road and a sign reading “Fresh Ground’s Leap Frog Cafe .2 miles east”. Off I went on the detour. There were 26 hikers total there within 30 minutes. I had a beef burrito, chicken fritters, salad, watermelon, and a good time. I saw two hikers I hadn’t seen since Front Royal: Whispers and Cheesecurds. Talked to the. For a bit then decided not to camp in the field where the van was parked but to instead continue .6 miles (.2 trail miles) to the shelter for the night.As everyone was eating, we discovered that three other hikers had knocked heads with the same tree I just tangled with. Two of them went to ground after their encounter. Here at the tenting area I sat and talked with Maps who is on a section hike. Maps has hiked on 5 continents and has even hiked to the Mt Everest base camp. People do some amazing things.  If I get up early enough, I just might backtrack to the Cafe for coffee, bacon and pancakes. Fresh Ground is then planning to take a few days off and chances are I won’t see him again this trip. Decisions, decisions. The post office with my long awaited package is 9 miles away and opens at 12:30pm. So I have one target for the day!  After that, maybe another 6-10 to camp. We shall see.","

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636975,"I did the .4 of a mile walk back to the Leap Frog Cafe, primarily to take down Fresh Ground’s sign at the trail crossing so he wouldn’t have to walk back to get it. When I got to his van it was a bit chaotic as another dozen hikers had shown up the night before after I had left for the shelter. Fresh Ground was a wee bit frazzled. I grabbed half a cup of very good coffee (thanks to Tall Son) and a blueberry pancake then I backtracked to the trail. I had 9 miles to cover by 12:30 to make it to Port Clinton when the post office opened. It was right back into the rocks and brush for three hours. I was less than thrilled to be the one silk blazing through the forrest. Every 100 feet I had to pull out my bandana and swish my melon clean of webs. This is fine. The last 3/4 of a mile was a challenging, steep, and rocky downhill into town. I couldn’t imagine trying to traverse it the rain. When I got to the bottom and crossed the railroad...there was Fresh Ground. He had chips, drinks (iced tea - yes!) fruit and chicken. Though Fresh Ground bought everything, a local trail Angel named Millie had provided the funds. Millie told me she’s lived next to the AT most of her life and never thought much of it. Then in 2018 her son thru hiked the trail and she really got in to the trail community and has been providing support ever since. At 11 I walking into town to the Port Clinton Hotel and bar to kill 90 minutes. Wouldn’t you know it, they had beer at the bar!  I ordered a bacon cheeseburger and a local IPA as the place slowly filled with motorcycle riders who come to the nearby BMW dealership to drool. The first beer went down so well I ordered a friend to keep him company. There was another hiker waiting at the post office - Sugar Man, he was giving up on trail cooking and mailing all his stove gear back home. Thankfully, my package was where it was promised to be and I unpacked my Merrill’s (picture above) and a few days worth of food. I sent back the Ono’s and a light jacket I’ve been wearing to bed in the cold temps. I decided it was redundant as I have both a rain jacket and a puffy jacket if I need to keep warm at night. (Plus I’ve walked off a few pounds and my puffy fits better than when I started)The walk out of town went from 396 feet at the river up to 1400 feet in about two miles. Buying a friend for my first beer may have been costly. I was dead-legged all afternoon. Consequently, I called a halt to the day’s walk after another 6 miles at 4pm. My big toe on Harry is not in great shape. Most of the skin rubbed off between the knuckle and the bone is a little inflamed. Gross. I’m really going to have to take it easy and monitor how it responds to new shoes. It’s possible I may have to take a few days off trail if it doesn’t improve. The Trout family and the other hikers I’ve been around the last three days were already here when I arrived. Had a nice evening chatting with everyone and also talking with two section hikers who separately less than 300 miles from competing all the AT miles. I’m going to try and sleep tonight without my insulating pad under my feet to see if they don’t hurt so much from rubbing against the foam.

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637052,"The Trouts encouraged me to set up my hammock near their tents last night, i forewarned them that reliable witnesses have informed me I snore and I could move further away. Trail veterans that they are, they said it wouldn’t bother them. I did ask what time they planned that be up so as not to disturb them so 5:45 was my wake up alarm. 

The privy at the shelter was interesting. Many of the newer ones on the trail are composting privies that use the open air and microbes to break down...material. This privy was open on one side and whatever you choose to put down the chute can be seen by anyone strange enough to want a look. Though I do suppose if you were hiking with your Gastroenterologist, she could make a quick diag of any issues your issuances might have. 

Any who...

I said my good mornings to all the breakfast nerds and walked out to the trail at 6:20, knowing we had a few climbs today and a lot of Pennsylvania’s finest rocks ahead. What I didn’t expect (because I didn’t look ahead) were two great views. The first was Preacher Rock that I reached around 7. The rolling farmland looks so inviting from up on high.  Right behind Preacher Rock were 3 small observatories, I’m not sure if they are still in use or if they are obsolete. There were a few amateur astronomers camped out who had been star gazing with their own equipment overnight. 

Next up was Pinnacle Rock which was the real show stopper (pic above). Just as I got to the overlook Tall Son caught up to me, followed shortly by the rest of the crew: Not Yet, Roo, Wicked and Viking Man (SKOL!!” They had a Nero planned and were getting picked up by a relative of Viking Man - who apparently is one of those people who has relatives spaced 6 days apart through most of the Eastern US. 

I would say “have a great afternoon off, thanks for letting me tag along, and see you up the trail” about 3 miles further ahead at a road crossing. It was enjoyable listening to their banter and hearing their perspective on having less than 900 to go. I’m sure they’ll pass me once again on the trail in the days ahead. 

I also saw Maps at the road crossing (thanks for following my journal!) as he was now hiking southbound back to his car to complete his section hike. Near there was Soundscape, yet another flip flopper who started his hike in Harpers Ferry on April 22. I chatted with him for a bit just up the trail, he had just received a call that a close colleague of his had passed away unexpectedly at the age of 53. Just awful. Life is short, off times shorter than we know. 

After that it was rocks rocks rocks rocks rocks and then some rocks. Pennsylvania is persistent in that way - and it REALLY gets rocky starting tomorrow, or so I am told. 

If I was being recorded when rock hopping through a boulder field, it’d sound like this;
*tuneless, nervous whistling*
Oop!
Hi-yah!
Ouch
NO!!!
Hagrunich!
Careful!
Garn!
AAAHHH!
Whoa!
Don’t you move!
*mild to severe curse*

Humph 
Gnurt
Phew!

And then on to the next boulder. I will say this, it does tend to help you focus in the moment, you (okay, I) really can’t think more than one step ahead. 

And then here comes Megn (real name, no trail name 1209 miles in) a hiker who started in Georgia March 8th and is already here, stepping by me like a mountain goat. Oh, and no trekking poles. Show off. 
Late in the afternoon I made the difficult decision to grab some Buffalo wings from a restaurant just a stone’s throw from the trail. Just behind me the Trout Train arrived and they kindly asked if I’d like to sit with them (we were all outside - hikers be gamey), so I gratefully accepted and didn’t dine alone. 

At 6 I limped away from the table to hike another mile to the stealth site where I am camped. Harry’s big toe looks like a scene from a cartoon when someone hits their thumb with a hammer and it immediately swells and pulses red or purple. But, it didn’t get worse today! So there’s that!
I plan on getting out early on the morrow to make some slow miles and hopefully cover the 50 miles to Delaware Gap, Pa by Monday.

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637106,"I packed up and was on my way at 6:10 this morning. I knew there were going to be several challenging rock scrambles in the next 19 miles - and boy howdy, were there!


First up 3 miles from my camp was Knife’s Edge. Which turned out to be a roughly 150 yard rock walk on a very narrow ledge of rock that stuck up like a knife’s edge. There were drops of varying but potentially serious heights on either side. At one point I was standing with both feet on the one-inch ledge of a huge boulder when I looked down to my left and saw a 40 foot drop to the rocks below. “Wow”, I thought: “That drop would be hella painful, all it would take is one slip”. I was reminded of sports psychologists who preach that success comes from a positive mindset, and that negative thoughts are no help. Then I thought about times I had not come through in the clutch and if negative thinking was an issue. THEN I REALIZED I HAD BEEN STANDING ON THIS TINY LEDGE FOR 30 SECONDS. 


I moved on. 



This section of Pennsylvania trail is very dry. The only water to be had is often a half mile downhill off trail. I had packed out with three liters and had drank one by 9 am when I came across a water cache. There were 25 one gallon jugs of water. This was the first of three caches on the day all provided by a local man who goes by “Mun”. This was such a stress reducer. I still carried heavy all day with four liters as I was very thirsty for some reason or another. Not having to do a steep off trail mile for water was a blessing.I had 13 miles done by 12:15, but staring down at me was the 900 foot climb from the Lehigh river to the top off the ridge - in just 1/2 mile. I was finagling with my water bottles when an older couple came off the mountain and told me I wasn’t going to get to the top just sitting there. I told them I was waiting for a reroute of the trail. They did tell me to watch out for rattlesnakes as they had seen one on their way down just off the trail. Alas, I never saw it. No bears in Virginia and no rattlesnakes for me in Pennsylvania. *sigh*


I gave myself an hour to do the climb and was at the top in 45 minutes. Their were 3 or 4 places where I just hucked my trekking poles up above me as I needed both hands to climb. Falling was an unattractive option. 


Speaking of which, I had more close calls today than I have had the previous five weeks. Three where I was borderline going down and twice as many serious stumbles. The closest call came as I going over a nameless rock rise and as I went around a tree growing between the rocks my backpack got caught and then spun me to my right. I stabbed down with my trekking pole only to find a chasm between the stones. I was looking at a 3-4 foot fall right into my face (and I have a big face) when I cast out my left hand and caught myself on the edge of the rock. PHEW! It was close. But so far on my hike - no falls. 



The last part of the day was spent walking around the Lehigh Superfund clean up site. The EPA had been here for years working on an old zinc mining operation that has leached heavy metals into the surrounding waters.After the walk around there was one of those fun AT trail routes that took you up a rock scrambles, then turned left across it, then down to the left and then finally back to the right to the top. Meanwhile you can look through the woods and see a level gravel path the locals use to get to the overlook. Now, I’m not complaining, the trail is the trail, but it sure goes out of its way to be a “challenge” for the hiker. 


I’m ending my day at a stealth site about 19 miles  from where I started. My tootsies are no worse. I’m going to try and do another 20-ish tomorrow so I can get to Delaware Water Gap on Monday and then take a zero Tuesday. 


If you have any questions hike-related, please drop them in the guest book and I’ll answer them on my off day. 


It’s possible I won’t have a post up tomorrow, as all my electronics are about dead since I haven’t charged in 7 days. 


Onward!","Stealth Campsite

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637240,"So before turning in last night I did what I normally do at a stealth-site: pre dig a cat hole for possible excretory needs as they arise. Well, there was a late arrival last night who set up his tent about 20 feet from my excavation, probably good for both of us that nature was elsewhere and didn’t come calling for me. 


I was on trail just before sunrise at 5:36, knowing I had a long slog in front of me. The section I was on is the rockiest of rocky Pennsylvania. 



This is fine  
As per usual, it took about a mile of hobbling along for my feet to settle in and flexibility to return. This was going to be another dry day for water. There were only two springs listed that I saw, .4 to ,6 off the trail. I had two full liters to start so that was good. I passed a few tents in the first three miles and being the weekend it could be anybody. 


I came to a road crossing about 9 am and walked past a Pee-Tee. You read that right. It’s a portable structure about six feet high and three feet square at the base. It’s used for backwoods privacy when things need to be handled (bucket sold separately). Across the dirt road two guys were sitting on a wooden barrier. I walked over and they were busting on their friend who packed along the Pee-Tee on their just concluded 25 mile three day hike. They had no lack of fun at his expense for bringing that along. A man and his comforts. 


I took off my pack and talked to them for a bit, they could not believe the rocks they had hiked through in two days. Seemingly all they saw of Pennsylvania wilderness was the area directly under each step. I commiserated. We chatted about my hike and they offered me their unused water and a dehydrated meal they didn’t use. I declined the dinner but gratefully accepted the 1/2 liter of water. That was going to be enough to tide me through to Wind Gap 8 miles up trail. 


Back to the rocks. 


Not much to say about the morning trail - no views, just rock, step, rock, lather rinse repeat.  I did tell myself repeatedly not to think too much about town on Monday, but rather focus on the moment and enjoy the trail. In this, I was moderately successful. 


By noon I had reached Wind Gap out of water and decided to hike .7 of a mile down the hill to a gas station in town. Once there, I made my purchases and crossed the street to sit on the steps of an Episcopal church and have lunch consisting of ranch flavored tuna (which I’ve carried since Front Royal, Va) pork rinds, chocolate milk and a Snapple. What I really wanted was an Arnold Palmer ice tea made by Arizona Tea, but the gas station had 14 different tea flavors, but no Arnold Palmer. In Pennsylvania. I was crestfallen. Oh well, at least my post lunch burps should prove to be interesting. 


Road walk back to the trail for the 9 miles I had to go to my proposed camp spot. 


What a long afternoon. The trail didn’t vary bat all: it’s as if Pennsylvania said “this is my only pitch, so try and hit it”. The only thing that broke up the monotony was a thunder shower that lasted about 39 minutes. When your only excitement is a rain storm that makes the rocky trail that much harder too hike, you know it’s not a great day. 


Near the end of the hike I came to Wolf Rocks (known for its many snakes) which had warnings in the trail guide to be very cautious if the rocks were wet. I reasoned they were only wettish, not fully wet. So I skipped the side trail and started up. The first people I encountered were two teenagers coming down who told me they both had fallen. I though to myself “well, no shame if I do!” , which I didn’t. The biggest disappointment was that the rain and damp had driven all the snakes into their dens. Damn my luck. 


I now at the Kirkridge Shelter about 6.5 miles from Delaware Water Gap where I plan to hike tomorrow and take a day and a half off trail. The Trout family arrived after I had turned in so I popped out of my hammock to say hi. I’ll probably see them in town tomorrow.","Stealth Site
",Kirkridge Shelter,"May 16, Sun",23.01
Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637306,"When I got to the shelter last night there was one guy there. He has a house nearby that he Airbnb’s and sometimes when it’s booked he camps for a few nights at the shelter. Something that I never would have considered, but he seemed happy. I got my limp on early just beating the sunrise out of camp. I had six miles to town and two nights planned at a hotel. Man, did I have barn fever. There were a few nice views down to the Delaware river valley and the fog over the river was pretty thick. I did so much silk blazing through the forest and underbrush it felt like I was wearing a wedding veil. I can report that whatever variety of spider is responsible for the drag lines is not endangered. Though it wouldn’t break my heart if they became so. On the way down into Delaware Water Gap I met two older hikers climbing out, they asked if I was staying in town and when I said yes, told me I had to stop by the Village Farm and Bakery for their apple pie. Itinerary adjusted. When I got to town I turned right and began the half mile walk across the Toll bridge so as to reach the Pennsylvania/New Jersey state line. I was more than willing to break my “no backwards” pledge to check off another state and Guthooks map. Back into town and then to the Outfitter’s just as they opened at 9. I broke both of my trekking pole tips over the last two days of rocks and was looking to replace them. On further inspection at the shop, I noticed the carbon fiber had started to splinter on one pole. This is fine. I found a pair of $99 Leki brand poles, a new pair of sock liners (old ones blew out at 500 miles), Superfeet shoe inserts (for more support), gaiters to cover the tops of my shoes and keep debris out, two probars, and a Gatorade (which never stood a chance). Then a short walk to the Bakery which had more pies than I’ve ever seen in such a small space. Hundreds of pies. They also had a permanent special called the “True Love” - a hotdog and piece of apple pie for $2.95. Hell. Yes. (I’d been up since 4:45, so it was lunchtime)Washed it down with a coffee and then another short walk to the motel where they were nice enough (or I smelled of 30 day old cheese and they wanted me gone) to get me a very early check in. Washing off 8 days of trail felt sooooo good. Then I did my laundry. Going back to my room I found two boxes of food outside my door. What the...? I toed it aside and then got a text from from my friends Mike and Jason who had ordered all that grub for me. Wings, garlic bread, garlic twists, mozzarella stix, a chicken Parmesan sub and a whole pepperoni pizza. Dayum! I got after it with a vengeance. Then a Lyft to Walmart for a resupply, mostly foot care and health products and some peanut butter and almonds for my food bag. Just now finishing a second foot bath and getting ready for bed. Tomorrow I may walk a half mile to the post office, but that’s about it. Going to stay off Harry and Dudley as much as possible.","Kirkridge Shelter

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637386,"Killing time can be a chore, but I think it was a necessity for me today. It feels odd not to be on the trail and moving miles under my feet. I’ve soaked my tootsies about 8 times since yesterday evening in a basin with hot water, Epsom salts and mouthwash (kills bacteria, I’m told). Did some blister care and generally took it pretty easy, keeping my feet elevated when not dunking them. Headed out about 11 for the short walk to the post office to ship a few things home. I’ve decided to go stoveless for the near future. Trail cooking has just seemed to be something I couldn’t rally myself to do. So the titanium pot, stove, and alcohol bottle are going back to Michigan. The other piece of gear I sent back I’ve actually worn a lot, but with temps (likely) not going back to the 30’s at night, my wool bottom layer is probably overkill. They are Smartwool 250 weight Marino wool and really worked well. Side note: little known fact, Marino wool was developed by former Miami Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino, who after a very successful turn as an Isotoner gloves pitch man, decided to get into the fabrics business himself to great success. True Story. On my way to the post office I saw the Locos having lunch at the Bakery before heading back to the trail. I thought they would have been long gone this morning, but they stretched leaving the hotel until check out time and planned on a short 14 mile afternoon hike. I gifted them the three dehydrated meals I hadn’t used instead of shipping them back home. I may see them in a few days up trail. Time will tell After leaving the post office I bumped into Slippers, who I had last seen back in Maryland when he gave me a lift back to the trail head. The trail can be a small world. Back to the hotel for the afternoon where I managed to finish the last of the food bought for me yesterday by my friends. Thanks, guys! (I think). I’m pretty happy with how I felt after walking a couple of miles today. I’m going to keep a close eye on the healing process and if I need to limit miles the next few days or take a break, I’m going to do so. (At least I tell myself that, being your own worst enemy can be a thrill ride!)Back hiking tomorrow, looking at maybe going 13. Got some great info from Easy, who I met back in the Shenandoah’s, he’s a New Jersey native who knows the upcoming trail really well. Kinda fired up about the next week!","Delaware Water Gap
",Delaware Water Gap,"May 18, Tue",0
Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637458,"I consulted with my sports psychologist/hiking coach this morning  and came up with a slow-walk plan for the day: leisurely exit from the hotel and see whether it would be a 4 mile day or a whatever mile day. In conjunction with this, NJ native and faster-hiker-than-me Easy inadvertently threw out a “New Jersey Challenge” for me in the Guest Book. He was kind enough to list some cool spots and highlights of the NJ section that I then took as a throwing down of th gauntlet: game on!Leaving the hotel at 8:30 after making some adjustments to my pack straps and suspension (either my hip bones are moving higher or there’s less of me hiding them away)  I walked by the Village Farm and Bakery and saw two hikers I know sitting and having breakfast. (Some sources report that a certain gimpy hiker may have had a piece of pie and a large coffee, but these reports remain unconfirmed as of this writing). It didn’t sound like anyone had a big day planned as Grumpy Cat had three weeks to do 300 miles before he flies out of Albany to Colorado for his Army retirement and Sugar Man was just taking a short day. Retraced my steps back to the Tollbridge and the NJ border, crossing the painted line at 9:15. By the by, I intellectually understand the engineering principle that flexible structures are more durable and resilient than rigid structures, but when you’re walking across a four lane concrete bridge 50 feet over a river and every time a semi passes you feel the bridge bounce, it’s a little...disconcerting. After the road walk ended I stepped into a NJ park and the first 1/4 mile hiking up a falling stream was more pretty than the last 45 miles of Pennsylvania. I had an idea for an ad campaign the Pennsylvania tourist bureau to try and lure daredevils, thrill seekers and masochists to their stage: “Come hike Pennsylvania - WE DARE YOU!”Now, there were still rocks. Geology generally doesn’t respect state lines,but for the most part they never went over a 7 on the horror scale. A few miles in I stopped at an actual spring fed stream and was getting water when Grumpy Cat came up. As he was filtering he found two ticks on his arm. Yikes!  Another half mile up I took my first shoes off/socks off break of the day on top of Raccoon Ridge (the first stop on my NJ challenge) and had lunch. As I chilled another.hiker came up (didn’t catch her name) and as she sat she found a tick on her leg. Double yikes!Move ahead another 3 miles (about 10 total for the day) and I came to the road that leads to the Mohican ATC center where cold drinks beckoned. I took the .3 mile gravel road to the center for my second break of the day. Got a. Iced tea and sat in the shade in an Adirondack chair for a good 45 minutes. GC, Sugar Man and three other hikers arrived and all decided to call it a day. They did have a good $10 hiker camping special that as really tempting, but I eventually decided to move on a few more miles. As I was re- shoeing myself to day hikers sat down nearby and one of the ladies found a tick on her neck. TRIPLE YIKES!  Paranoia eventually set in and I felt as if I was crawling with ticks. I sent all my hiking clothes to a company that tears them with permethrin and says it will resell tics  thri 70 launderings. So far, so good. No tics on yours truly. After leaving the Campground, there was a climb and then an awesome ridge walk with views for miles and miles and miles to the east. It was still rocky, but I could stop occasionally and soak in the view. One day in and I like New Jersey, this being the first time I’ve ever been to the state. Around 5:30 I came to the Catfish Fire tower and lo and behold! Someone was in it. There was a picnic table at the base so I stopped to eat dinner (being that I don’t want to eat where I camp and invite bears to snoop).  As I was unpacking the man up in the observation post at the top of the tower leaned out and shouted down that I was welcome to climb the tower for a better view, but then I couldn’t go the observation deck due to regulations. As he was apparently at least shirtless, the distinct lack of personal space up there made me glad I didn’t have to decline an invitation to go son the way to the top. He was there to monitor a industrial fire about 30 miles away as it is very dry in the region. Luckily, the winds are low.m, keeping the threat of a spread low. Hiking forward, I next came to a beaver dam and there was one of the critters chilling in the waters edge about 30 feet away. I also heard two loud snacks from my left - like a beaver tail hitting the water - and two more seam into view. Cool!About 1/2 mile away was my proposed camping spot for the night, but it ended up being to close to a road and brought back memories of earlier in my hike and the Night Of Tripping Mad Balls. Ok, head off another 1.2 miles to a stealth site. On the way there a came across a juvtsnake about 8-10 inches long that was a rat snake,  garder snake or ring neck snake. It coiled and looked menacing. Hopefully I got a good enough picture to identify it tomorrow. Last but not least, the gaiters. I bought gaiters that attach to the top and back of your shoes to keep debris and dirt out. First day of using them and I’m a fan. When I got to camp tonight and did my tic and toe checks, my feet were clean and nothing got into my shoes. All in all, even given the rocky trail, Harry and Dudley are content tonight. The next test will come in the morning. I won’t stay up studying.","Pennsylvania/New Jersey state line

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637512,"Good news: stealth camping usually means lots of leaves on the ground so nothing can sneak up on you. 


Bad news: all night long it always sounds like something is sneaking up on you. 


I got packed and out at 6:16 with the plan to take lots of breaks today and work on thinning out my food bag. The feet felt ok and there are no other aches reporting for duty. The spiders were certainly on duty and had worked through the night to crisscross the trail with webs from ankle to face height. At some points they were so thick I was walking with my poles out in front of me, flailing up and down in a futile attempt to clear the way.  I finally tied a bandana over my face and pulled my hat down low so that just my eyes were uncovered. I got a lot of webs right in the peepers. 
This is fine. 
After two hours I pulled off on a side trail with an overlook to a small lake just so I could clean off the silk and have a break. I was really hoping someone might pass me and talk the brunt of the arachnid scourge. When I went back on trail, alas, I was still silk blazing. 
I mentioned yesterday I came across a small, aggressive snake late in the day and wondered if that was potentially my rattlesnake story. Today, I got the real deal. I was coming down some large rock slabs and the trail took a sharp turn to the right. As I stepped on a large boulder it shifted slightly and I saw something move quickly into a crevice and then...the rattle. I jumped about 4 feet sideways shouting a “CRIKEY!” as it buzzed at me. Shakily I got my phone out and was able to record the noise. It had gone deep between the rocks and I thought that rather than enticing it out for a pic, I would leave well enough alone and sidle around it’s den. 
This is f-f-f-f-f-f-ine. 
To celebrate checking off a bucket list item, I had lunch 45 minutes later on top of rattlesnake mountain. Though the only encounter I had there was with a bunch of trash someone left sitting on top of the rocks. *Sigh*. I got out one of my plastic grocery bags and gathered it all up, as I was going to be near town in a few hours and would toss it out there. I did finally try Spam for the first time in a tortilla with some peanut butter. Not bad. 
The town that I was aiming for was Culver’s Gap, NJ. I mentioned that in the guest book NJ resident Easy had given me some suggestions of things to see along the trail that I morphed into The Easy Inadvertent New Jersey Challenge (known hereafter as EINJC). Yesterday I had completed the first two legs by having second breakfast on top of Raccoon Ridge and then taking the road to the Mohican Outdoor Center. 
Today brought leg three: Taking a short road walk to Gyp’s Tavern for a burger and a beer and sitting in an Adirondack chair by the lake. I got to Gyp’s at 2 and they were very hiker friendly. They showed me where I could recharge electronics, filled my water bottles, and told me I could relax there as long as I liked (they hinted I’d be more comfortable outback, I may have been a wee bit sweaty from the 84 degree weather). So: burger, beer, then chair by the lake. I upped the difficulty by taking a 20 minute power nap while sitting lakeside. (Picture above is from my lakeside perch). An hour and 45 minutes later I was back to finish the last 3 miles of the day to the shelter. This is another shelter that is way too close to a road and consequently has a lot of trash strewn about. 
Back at it tomorrow, though I hope I see fewer rocks than I did today. I had a lot of difficulty getting into any rhythm and just seemed to fight it all day. Didn’t see any NOBO’s today, only a few day hikers moving south. I think I’m 1-2 days behind the “bubble” with a bubble of flip-floppers 1-2 days behind me.","Stealth site in NJ

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637582,"Was woken around 9:30 last night by voices from the shelter about 30 yards away. They didn’t converse long and I didn’t hear anyone hatching plans to rob and kill me, so I went back to sleep. (Mostly). Only other incident was someone screaming something from the nearby road about 12:30am then the sound of a car peeling out and racing away. Lovely. 
I usually get my next day’s water the night before, but I went back to to spring this morning to get another two liters to cover another dry 13 miles. I did see that two thru hikers were sleeping in the shelter, explaining the voices. I was trail walking by six o’clock and sweating by 6:05. I did have a stroke of genius (about six weeks late, but still, genius) when I remembered I had a head net to stave off bugs that worked wonderfully to stave off spider webs. I looked like a fool, but was blessedly silk free!
I was taking a breather at Leg Four of the EINJC (privy at the Mashipacong Shelter is painted pink inside, like the visitors locker room at Iowa’s football stadium) when a hiker rolled in. Turns out this was Punisher, who along with Bopit has been hiking since Jan 1st. They started in Key West, Fl and are hiking the Eastern Continental Trail towards Nova Scotia which is over 5500 miles!  They’ve already done 3500 miles since starting. Mind blowing. They met last year on the Pacific Coast Trail and hatched this plan. They generally hike 30-35 miles per day like a couple of hikers perfected in a lab. 
I hiked with Punisher for a short while and honesty, I don’t know how some hikers can seemingly throw themselves downhill and their feet find good tread. I’ve tried, and whatever it is I lack - vision, confidence, shoes, luck, skill - I just end up with turned ankles and sore feet. 
I just went on my merry, slow, plodding way. 
I did catch up to them later when they took a break and they told me that a hiker hostel in Unionville was holding a community cook out tonight - hikers invited. I called the hostel and was told by Doug (thru hiker in 2013) that they had four beds and were a first come - first served hostel. I didn’t like my chances to get a bed, given I was still 10 miles away. But, I deceived to see what happened. 
Two miles shy of town was the Secret Shelter, a privately owned place where hikers could camp for free and also the home of Jake the Donkey (visiting was another leg of the EINJC). I did the short side trail and there was Jake (pic above) and also the owner doing some work on the place. Jake gave me the once over and then went back to eating grass. The owner asked if he could borrow my phone as his car had broken down in the driveway and he didn’t have cell service. I obliged and drank some nice well water while he called for assistance. 
When I got to town I turned right to the local bar and got a drink (vodka and 7 up - too hot for a beer. Then went into town and got a slice of pizza (Easy had listed the bar, the pizza place, and the general store) then continued on to the hostel. Much as I guessed, the hostel was full for the night, but Pastor Doug (preacher as well as former thru hiker) invited me back for the cookout at 6:30. He did tell me I looked pretty happy and that my hike must be going well  I assured him I was and it was and that I’m just rolling with whatever God presents to me  
Back into town to register at the general store to camp in the town park for the night. I had checked it out and my only hammock option was to attached one end to a chain link fence and the other to a tree - and right underneath the park’s arc light. 
This is fine. 
As I sat on the porch drinking a vitamin water and eating a granola bar, Punisher came up to get ice for the Pastor’s cook out. He told me he and Bopit weren’t going to stay at the hostel after all as Bopit had a friend coming into town to meet them. I quickly called Doug back and he said the last bed was mine. 
This is what I call trail magic. 
An hour later I was showered and wearing  an ill fitting track suit (loaner clothes) while doing laundry. About 35 people showed up for the cook out and I had a good time chatting with hikers, church members, and neighbors. Could not have come at a better time!
Turning in a bit late as there are still people outside s’moreing it up. Not going to push too hard tomorrow as the rocks are still taking a toll on me.

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637657,"When I was talking Pastor Doug yesterday  (trail name banzai) I told him I was from Holland, Mi and it turned out he was from Grandville, Mi - about 20 miles from Holland. And the very next thing he said was “what do you think about that Castle abomination they built by the highway”.  I just lost it laughing. Everyone around West Michigan will know exactly what he’s talking about and why he called it an abomination. Huge apartment building that is allegedly nice inside but looks like it was built using plans from Chernobyl. Anyway. Didn’t get out of bed until 6:15 this motioning and left the hostel at 7:30. Can’t say enough nice things about Doug and his family and the cookout last night with neighbors and members of his congregation. They don’t just profess their faith, they live it. Off to the General Store for my final task in town for the EINJC- the Taylor Ham and egg sand sandwich (pic above). It was so good, I had a large coffee and a vitamin water to keep it company. Already on the porch were Hangs and Belch who had spent the night at the secret shelter just short of town. Then Saint, Halo and Zoomie came over from the hostel as well. While we sat, Punisher and Bopit walked by for the trail. I sincerely doubt I will see them again, they are on a mission.Got to the trail at 8:39 and had a flat first 4 miles including the longest road walk so far. Later, I walked around a massive wetlands restoration project intended to bring waterfowl back to the area. If it can somehow attract every single Canadian Goose from Michigan, I’m all for it. I got water from behind the abandoned house (EINJC) then began the first 1000 foot climb of the day. I stayed with it without stopping (plod plod plod) and was so soaked with sweat when I got to the top I could have been swimming. The theme of the day was hot, humid, and no breeze. The bugs have really bloomed over the last few days and the mosquitoes, gnats and deer flies showered me with love and attention. On the backside of the hill I came to a fast flowing stream with large rocks by the banks. So I sat down, peeled off my shoes and socks and soaked my feet in the cold water for 10 minutes. Heaven  Next up was the long boardwalk through a massive swampy area  it’s at least a mile long and the day hikers were out in force. Though most coming towards me back to their cars seemed pretty grumpy in the heat  After crossing another boardwalk though a boggy pasture 11 miles into the day I came to the road crossing where Easy had said there would be a hotdog stand an a farm market.  Before I got there, I saw a truck in the parking lot with it’s tailgate open and a cooler perched there. I went over and there was a hand lettered sign that read “trail magic”.  Ohmygodohmygodohmygod! Gatorade in the cooler.  A box with an assortment  of frito lay chips.  A five gallon jug of water.  None of this was part of the EINJC, but I hit it all.Then 50 yards to the hotdog stand for a dog with sauerkraut.  Then across the street to the farm market where Easy had listed three things:Ice cream - checkApple cider donut- checkCold drink - check  Only one more item on the EINJC - a side trail near the summit of the next 1000 foot climb called “stairway to heaven”.  As I was going up, down the climb came D-day - a friend of Bopit’s who I met at the cookout and who was the reason they didn’t stay at the hostel.  He immediately offered me some crackers and I asked him if he was the source of the trail magic.  He was! I told him I had loaded up already on his kind spread and thanked him profusely.  Also on the climb - I PASSED THREE DAY HIKERS!  And they weren’t overtly disabled in any way and appeared to be under 30 years old.  I could almost retire now from thru hiking.  About three miles shy of the shelter I was heading for I came to another rocky stream and repeated my earlier cold water soak.  Two section hikers were lingering there, only .5 miles from the parking lot and the end of their hike.  One of them thought my soak was a capitol idea and he found a rock of his own to sit and have a soak.At the shelter now and the bugs and mosquitoes are pretty think.  There are probably a dozen people here and everyone got in their tents pretty quickly - I as well.Tomorrow promises to be just as hot as today.  I have no plan at this point and the shelters aren’t spaced well. I’ve got 42 miles to Fort Montgomery, NY where I have a food box waiting and where I may take a nero on Tuesday to give Dudley some rest.  Hope everyone is well.","Unionville, NJ

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637728,"About 7:30 last night a group of weekenders came to the shelter area to set up camp. Hilarity ensued. One guy somehow put up his tent inside out and another forgot his tent stakes. A lot of discussion ensued as the skies darkened. Eventually another hiker politely let them know that “hiker midnight” was sundown and that quiet would be appreciated. To their credit, the threesome quoted down as they fussed and fought with their gear. It was so hot, I couldn’t fall asleep anyway and was mostly just cracking up. Then around 9:45 one of them headed cross-country to the privy and when they came back, couldn’t find their camp. He actually circled my hammock twice, muttering to himself. I was dying. 
I rolled out at 6 am and took a side trail to park headquarters to load up on water as most the sources today came from ponds or swamps - negative, ghost rider. I had about 4 miles left of New Jersey before reaching the state line with New York. I had been shut out in NJ when it came to seeing deer, I saw lots of tracks, but no live ‘uns. About 1/2 mile from the last road crossing I spooked 4 white tails and breathed a sigh of relief - way to go NJ!
Then just past the last road crossing I found Trail Magic/hilarity. There was a bag weighted down with rocks (pic above) that had my name on it. Inside was a note from Easy. He had printed out a Certificate of Completion for the EINJC and signed it. Also included was an AT buff that I’ll wear with pride. That Easy took time to do all that AND drive however far he had to come just to leave that for me is something that I will never forget. I’m glad he took my literal reading of his NJ suggestions as a challenge and ran with it. I had a blast doing it and loved my time in the Garden State. 
A lot of the day today consisted of rock climbs over small NY peaks with some great views down to the lakes below. I also had my first rebar climb where assist handles were sunk into the vertical face of a huge boulder. I kept looking for snakes, but was shut out. Around 11 I ran into a SOBO day hiker named Stan the Man and he handed me a frozen Powerade as a trail magic treat. 
I got to enjoy the drink an hour later while waiting for a creamery that was 1/4 off trail to open. I bought myself a chocolate shake and used the charging station and water station provided for hikers by the Bellvale Farm creamery. 
I set my sights on doing another 6 miles (stopping once for a long foot soak in a cold cream) and ended up at a stealth site on a ridge. The wind is helping keep the bugs to a minimum, but I am a little nervous as this is a high bear activity area. In fact, one of the trees from which I’m hanging has old claw marks in the bark about 6 feet off the ground. 
This is fine. 
After another day with temps in the mid 80’s, tomorrow is supposed to cool off significantly into the 60’s which should make for a good hiking day. For the first time in my 6 weeks on the trail, I may actually get to town on Tuesday with an empty food bag!I go to bed as the first person to ever complete the EINJC.  I could see coming back here in the future to do it a second time

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637788,"Enjoyed a bear-free night in my hammock, just had the usual unexplained leaf rustling and a Whipperwill going off now and again. After a quick pack up I was hiking by 5:45. Today’s hike was one where looking at the elevation profile would leave an incomplete picture of the hike. I never crossed a peak over 1400 feet, yet it was a top-five day for total elevation gain. There are just so many “up and over” hills that it really adds up (425 flights of stairs, according to Garmin).  There were a handful of rock climbs as well where trekking poles just got in the way. Balancing the ups and downs was a perfect weather day for hiking: partly cloudy, breezy, and highs in the low 60’s. ‘Twas a bit of a lonely hike for most of the day. I’m a day behind the Trout family who constitute their own hiking bubble and a half day ahead of some of the hikers I met in Unionville. About noon a came to a section called “The Lemon Squeezer” where the trail went under and through a large rock formation necessitating me to take off my pack and slide sideways through the rock. As I was putting my pack back on Punisher came through - I had thought he was long gone, but he and Bopit took a zero yesterday to get out of the heat. As usual, after chatting for a minute he was gone-daddy-gone up the trail at a speed I cannot match. Around 2pm the trail passed a shelter and Punisher was there along with Free. Free was happily getting...relaxed and Punisher was waiting for Bopit who arrived 5 minutes after I did. This will likely be the last time I see them. If you want to check out Bopit’s hike, she has a YouTube channel called, I believe, “Bopit hikes”.After a half hour break I hiked on. I have a food box waiting for me at the Fort Montgomery post office and a hotel room booked for Tuesday night (Thanks, Vargas!) so I needed to find a spot that’ll put me within a morning’s walk of the road. As I was topping another ridge I noticed that I could see the New York City skyline about 40 miles away across the Hudson River. (Pic above is of the skyline which you can juuuuuust make out). This is the first time I’ve seen it and the closest I’ve been to the Big Apple. I have one more mountain to cross in the morning that may provide a better view. I did manage to find a hanging spot, through the only two trees I found are pretty far apart. Good thing I have long straps!  The shelter about .4 of s mile away has had an active bear reported, so I’m a bit paranoid about an ursine encounter. Consequently I hung my bear bag far from my camp, shooing away two large rat snakes from under the tree where I tied up. As the man said, This is fine.","

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637853,"Another successful night with no bear attacks, though the wind on the ridge where I camped was cold this morning. I was in full cocoon with my quilts and warm hat. I am getting pretty efficient at packing up my gear in a systematic way, clocking in this morning at 33 minutes from waking to walking. Had some fantastic views this morning along the ridge past west mountain and then from the top of Bear mountain four miles down the trail. Looking down on the valley you can see why the Hudson River school of American artists were inspired by the natural beauty of the area. Though I was on my way to town for the day, I still hit the vending machines at the top of Bear mountain for a $3 Powerade. Then sat on a bench enjoying the view. I didn’t feel the least bit guilty about this. As I was leaving, Free wandered over with the same idea I had: Powerade, view, chill. The 2 mile trail down into town was the most groomed section I’ve been on, and will probably remain so. They really did a nice job making a steep descent/ascent accessible for hikers of all skills. I did find myself getting annoyed by the amount of trash on the trail. Since I was on the way into town, I decided to play Trail Maintenance Man and got a plastic bag out of my pack. By the time I got to the bottom it was full of discarded water bottles and masks. The AT goes through the Trailside Zoo just outside of town, but only between 10:30 and 3:30. I was way early so I took the bypass trail towards Fort Montgomery. On the way I went through the 1777 revolutionary battlefield site where the British - backed by loyalist forces, defeated the revolutionary forces. To put things bluntly, I smelled bad. So I took a hobo shower in a convenience store bathroom and put on my least offensive shirt. Slightly spruced up, I continued the 2 mile walk towards my hotel. I checked Yelp and saw that there was one coffee shop in town. As you would naturally expect, it was located inside a Ducati motorcycle repair shop. They had a special of one large coffee and French toast for $5, how could one say “no” to this once in a lifetime experience?  I sure couldn’t. Got to the hotel at 10am and got an early check in, then went through my gear and got laundry together. I don’t know if I mentioned it or not, but I shaved my most of my last week. I really tried to give it a go for two months, but it came in so patchy it looked like a garden seeded by a spastic blind man. It was no bueno. So I’m back to the goatee life - a beard for guys who can’t grow beards.This is fine.All cleaned up and smelling human, I got my laundry started and then went for a half hour swim in the hotel pool. ‘Twas devine! And not only was my hotel room comped by my friend Mike, once again my friend Jason hooked me up with way, way, way too much food.  But I powered their the burger, salad, onion rings, mashed potatoes and T-bone steak. (The chicken wings will keep for tomorrow).Now I am clean, stuffed, and getting repacked for hiking tomorrow. Not sure what the plan will be as there are thunderstorms predicted for the afternoon and overnight. I’ll keep an eye on the weather and play things by ear. Happy birthday today to my older brother Tom, out in SoCal!","West Mountain stealth site

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637930,"I was troubled by strange dreams involving late shipments of books, friends lost on the golf course, and being unable to get clean water. The last is explainable in that I found two pin-holes in my Katadyn water filter bag that I can’t explain. The holes are patched for now with Gorilla tape, but I may need a replace soon. I saw two hikers eating breakfast at the hotel as I hit up the coffee bar and had ran into two others in the elevator last night. I’m not in a “bubble” at the moment, but a lot of the early Georgia crowd is now passing through the flip-flip gang. Even though I’ve been on trail for 45 days, those Georgia starters just have a different aura around them. I forgot to mention in yesterday’s entry that my wayward glasses that I lost three weeks ago in Maryland have been located! My seventh call to Kelly at the Port Clinton post office paid off!  She told me they had arrived on Saturday and were likely misplaced at the Baltimore mail hub. Color me shocked!  She is forwarding them to Great Barrington, Ma about 110 miles up trail. I should be reunited with them early next week and once again be able to read what I type here! I caught an Uber back to the trail and was hiking by 7:45. First order of business was crossing the Hudson on the Bear Mountain Bridge then a road walk to where the trail went back into the woods. Yesterday marked the physical low point of the trail at the Trailside Zoo at only 129 feet above sea level. Nowhere to go but up from here!Today’s hike had just one view to offer (a 3 on the trail scale) and was mostly just a lot of walking up and down ridges in the woods. The one diversion came about 10:30 when the trail crosses the road about 100 feet from a deli. Though the food looked really good, I was still reeling from yesterday’s dinner throw down and the left over chicken wings I ate before leaving the hotel. I did indulge in my new obsession: cold chocolate milk. This new fixation really came out of left field: I don’t drink milk anymore and chocolate milk is a true throwback to my childhood and the Hershey’s syrup we’d add to a glass of cow juice. But I gotta tell you, it really hits me in all the happy places right now, so I’ll roll with it!Had another one in one with a rat snake laying on the trail. I told him I was cool going around him and didn’t want to harsh his mellow, but there were five hikers and a dog coming behind me and it might be time to slither into the underbrush. Strangely, it didn’t answer. Snakes can be so aloof. The afternoon heat, a whiny, petulant Dudley, the threat of strong thunderstorms, and the availability of fresh, cold drinking water led me to end my walking today at 25000 steps (aka - 15 miles) here at the Dennytown group campsite. There are the five hikers and Fido that I mentioned here along with two other hikers: Bookworm and Easy (not that Easy, this Easy).  Bookworm mentioned he was posting on Trailjournals and when I looked him up, I realized I had read part of his journal back in March before I started. Random coolness to end the day!I am laying in my hammock right now, hoping the early end to my day and the time it allowed me to set up will pay off when the storms hit. The thunder is announcing it’s presence with authority right now but I think my hatches are all battened down and ready. We really could use the rain. Many of the creeks are just pools of stagnant water and the trees could use a solid pollen-wash.Tomorrow promises a short road walk to a deli about 10 miles into the day. I’m already jonesing for another chocolate milk!","

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638001,"It ended up just raining for a few hours overnight - the heavy thunderstorms passed both south and north of where I was camped. Only my tarp was wet when I packed up, so my drip-strings on my hammock straps kept the water away from the rest of my gear. Hopefully I have this dialed in as rain is predicted from Friday afternoon through at least Monday evening. I rolled out of the camping area and did the .2 walk back to the trail by 5:45. The first 5 miles of the day turned into an absolute mosquito-fest. I quickly gave up any sense of dignity and put my bug net on over my hat. I felt no sham in this...well, maybe a little shame when I crossed a road and a guy in a passing truck looked to be laughing at me. So some shame, but no regrets. The little buggers were so bad I couldn’t even stop to take a picture. When I went to pull out my phone three landed on the back of my hand. I passed one hiker who was flailing about trying to swat them away while searching for his bug spray buried in his pack. About 4 miles in I passed the Telephone Of The Wind (suffering one mosquito bite to get the picture above).  This is an instillation for anyone dealing with the grief of losing a loved one. The idea being to pick up the phone (out of bug season) and talk to whom you are missing and listen for their voice on the wind. My first goal for the day was to see if I could register a 12x12 which I did even with about 40 minutes of breaks. My second goal was to get to mile 15 and do a .5 mile road walk to a deli. I got to the place just before 2pm and bought a large Gatorade, a chocolate milk, a sleeve of fig newtons (don’t ask me, my lizard brain is driving this bus) and a chicken sandwich. I relaxed out back in the shade at their hikers table for about an hour and bought an iced tea for the road. I arrived at this shelter area just before 5 and had a leisurely set up. Then I sat in the shelter and had a great conversation with Pit Stop, a local who has hiked a boat load of trail between here and Maine and had tons of good advice and insights about the trail. He’s been trying to rehab a hard to diagnose foot injury for the last 8 months and I hope he can get it fixed as he plans to thru hike next year. I’m going to enjoy the end to my last dry day for awhile. The first wave of rain is supposed to come tomorrow afternoon so I’m going to try and be flexible as to how far I’ll hike. I have options at 10, 16, and 20 miles with no deli stop to factor in. Given the forecast, I’m wondering how many people I’ll see out over the Memorial Day weekend.","Dennytown Road Campsite.

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638050,"Forgot to mention yesterday my awesome slip-but-not-a-fall on a wet, rocky downhill. I was inching my way down a damp boulder when my left foot slid, I tried to regain my balance to no avail. As I slipped my left trekking pole went flying (I chose not to use the straps for this very contingency) as I grasped for purchase. My left foot swung behind my right as I did a 180 and ended up in a pass rushers three-point stance facing uphill. After a few deep breaths, I retrieved the errant trekking pole and moved on. Back to today: steady rain was in the forecast starting sometime between one and seven. With it comes temps down into the low 40’s and a high Saturday of 49. Yar. I decided to hike with few breaks and keep an eye on the weather to hopefully make camp before the wet hit. There wasn’t much in the way of views on tap, it looked to be a forest walk kind of day. i was passed by Captain America (started in Georgia) about an hour into the day and then crossed paths with him again around 9 as we both filtered water from a creek. He had the same thought I did: try to get in some miles and set up before the rain. My first decision point came at mile 10 where a sign informed me there was a deli .5 miles away that allowed camping behind their store. Tempting as a deli visit would be, I didn’t want the 60-90 minute detour. So I hiked on towards the Wiley shelter sox miles away. I should add, at the deli road crossing there is also a train line into NYC with an Amtrak station right there. I’ve read of hikers taking this train into the city for a few days. Not this country mouse. After crossing some pasture land and using a few fence stiles it was back into the woods. I texted my wife that I just wasn’t feeling the hiking vibe today but when I checked at noon I had already covered 13 miles. I got to the shelter at 2 but was a little discomfited by all the dead trees around. So I decided to press on once more and aim for the Ten Mile River site.  I knew I’d be pushing my luck getting there in time to set up before the promised rain, but with rain forecast all tomorrow morning as well, I wanted to get in a few more dry miles. It barely worked out. I arrived at 4 after going over 10 Mile Mountain and down to the river. I got my hammock up, my clothes changed, choked down a quick dinner, brushed my teeth and put my bear bag in the provided box. And here came the rain. So now I am in Connecticut and New York is in my rear view mirror. There’s a decent chance I may just stay in my hammock until mid- morning if the rain lets up. If it doesn’t, I’ll probably just pack up and start hiking into the cold Memorial Day weekend.","Morgan Stewart Shelter

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638135,"The rain that began at 5pm yesterday intensified overnight and didn’t stop until 5 am. I clicked the radar on my weather app and saw that there was a small window of no rain until 6:30. So, I scrapped my lay about plan and got packed up. I saw Free outside his tent wrestling with something and walked over, turns out the heavy rain turned into a creek under his tent and all his gear - sleeping bag included - was soaked. I looked at the Guthooks app and saw there was a laundromat 9 miles up the trail in Kent, Ct. He’d be headed there to make his sleep system usable. 
One mile in I took a half mile road walk to a convenience store that is hiker-friendly. This was Bull’s Bridge, Connecticut and I had to cross a one lane covered bridge to get there. The river had gotten angry from all the rain and the rapids were in full action. At the store I got some coffee, a chocolate milk, a vitamin water (packed for later) and a bag of macadamia nuts. The store owner, who is from India, was very nice asked me questions about my hike as she rang me up. While I sat outside and drank I charged some gear and threw some nuts to the sparrows who were holding some sort of revival meeting next to the building.  Oddly, I saw a man wearing a Covid mask emerge from the woods across the street and go to the porta potty the store owner had outside for hikers. A few minutes later he left the porta potty, crossed the road and went back into the woods. I had many, many questions, but was more concerned about possible answers, so I let it go. 
Back on trail I came across Free going through a large garbage bag where the trail left the road. Turns out someone had left a whole mess of crackers, instant meals, snack cakes, sodas and beer as trail magic. Sadly, the mice had already been at some of the food as a garbage bag isn’t quite what you need to keep critters out. Free had already salvaged the good snack cakes (stoner’s gold) and some other chow. I had a Diet Coke and moved on. 
The next 6 miles of trail was Newt central. Holy Moses, there was seemingly a rust-orange Newt every 20 feet. I had to watch carefully lest I trod on one as they don’t move when you approach, seemingly relying on camouflage for defense. Once the rains came back at 9:30 they seemed to disappear back into their...dens? Lairs? Pits? Burrows? Fortresses? I guess I don’t know the proper Newt-house nomenclature. 
I did chat with one day hiker for a bit at the top of a climb. She had thru—hiked back in 2001 and was out for a 12 miler to get some strength back. She had fallen on a hike back in February and had broken her shoulder. This was after losing her job as a Wine Sommelier in Chicago due the pandemic and also losing her apartment. My problems don’t compare. 
I was surprised to see about a dozen day hikers in the rain and even 5 or 6 people out to backpack and camp for the holiday weekend- weather be damned. I gave no problem admitting that I would’ve changed my plans. 45 degrees and heavy rain isn’t the starting point for good times. 
Later in the day I came to an overlook called St John’s Ledges. There were a man and a woman there and when I said hello they called me over. Turns out they had just finished their sixth climb to the top for the day. There were 7 of them doing this as a tribute and in remembrance for a six year old boy who had died of a brain aneurysm last year. The gentleman told me they were about to head down and he had trail magic at the parking lot. I told them I’d see them there!
I almost didn’t. I could barely make it down the steep, slippery rocky downhill without falling, let alone do it six times like they had. At one point I actually sat on the edge of a boulder to let myself down to the ledge below. Though it has been established that I suck at going downhill. 
At the parking lot Smokey (that’s the guy’s trail name) opened up coolers full of drinks, sandwiches, water and he had baskets of fruit, candy bars and chips. What a spread. Smokey is a retired sheriff  (as in Smokey and the Bandit) who did a 750 mile AT section hike two years ago. It was just poor timing that I was the first NOBO they had seen all day. I helped myself to a Powerade, a chicken sandwich and some chips. Sat and talked trail for 30 minutes until I realized I was shivering from the cold and made my apologies to move on. They told me I might run into a “very tall woman” who had completed the 6-up 6-down earlier and went to hike some more. 
The rain had stopped by now as I hiked to get warm, my intention being to go to a shelter area about two miles away. But once again I altered my plans, figuring this momentary lack of rain meant I should push a little further on. There was another campsite 4 miles up trail that I made my new target. 
About one half mile from the camp I saw a very talk woman coming downhill toward me. I said to her: “You look like someone who hiked the ledges 6 times today”. Then I explained how I knew this. Turns out that in addition to doing the memorial Ledge climb, she was also finishing 26.2 miles of hiking for the day as part of a Make A Wish fundraiser. Then next weekend she’s going to hike all 50-some miles of the AT in Connecticut in 24 hours for another fundraiser. I’ve said this before and I guess I still mean it: people will surprise you with their generosity and kindness. 
When I got to the camping area I changed into dry clothes and put on my warmest stuff. It still wasn’t enough to ward off the shivers, but it helped. I downed some calories and then spent 15 minutes looking high and low through all my gear for my toothbrush and toothpaste. I gave them up for lost and resigned myself to a few days with trash mouth. Suddenly I remembered that I was clever this morning (I really thought so at the time) and put them away in a hip belt pouch. Trash mouth averted, I finally changed out of my wet shoes and sox and am once more cocooned in my hammock. 
This weather is nuts. Three days ago I’m sweating through my clothes in 88 degree weather and now it’s 42 degrees with rain predicted starting Sunday at 3 an throufb Monday noon. I plan on getting up early, packing up, putting on still wet gear, and waking to stay warm.

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638229,"Connecticut has some really nice shelters and campsites, Silver Hill being one. Newer privey, a large bench swing, a seating area and a pavilion that covers two picnic tables. I found two trees spaced perfectly for me AND facing such that my tarp would block the wind. I had hiked an extra 4 miles yesterday to get there after I had called Maria in Salisbury, Ct. to see if she had a bed available Sunday night. She did!  So the extra miles yesterday put me in reach of town IF I got up early and got on trail. The forecast called for rain from early Sunday morning to mid-morning Monday with high temps in the mid 40’s. The few hikers I had spoken to the last few days had mentioned taking zeroes and getting off trail. I reasoned (in my unreasonable way) that wet is wet and hiking big miles would be fine. This is going to be fine. Alarm went off at 4:30 and I was walking in a light mist by 5:15. I knew if I averaged 2 mph I would get to Maria’s house by 5pm. Goal set. The first hitch for b my scheme came 45 minutes later when I came to Guinea brook and found a rain-swollen creek about 40 feet across and the stepping stones submerged. I spent 10 minutes scouting for a better place to cross to no avail. Whelp, I’m going to have wet feet all day, might as well embrace the suck right out of the gate. I took off the bottom zippered portion of my hiking pants and took off my socks as well. Then it was “step in and see what happens”. What happened was that the water came up over my knees and the current was strong enough that I had to use extreme caution every time I moved a trekking pole or foot. I made it across and then dried off and reassembled my kit. Hiking uphill from the creek I came to a road that had blue blazes on the trees. Hmmmm. Checking my Guthooks app for the first time I saw that there was indeed a high water bypass road walk that would have taken less time and far less drama than my route. Mark this down as lesson learned? I doubt it. Around 8 I passed three SOBO weekenders (don’t they have warm, dry lives to live?) who told me there was trail magic at the next road crossing. 20 minutes later I was drinking a Vitamin Water and eating a Clif Bar courtesy of Butterfly Bob, a retired Navy Seabee who comes out most days to provide magic. Bob served in Morocco, Puerto Rico, Panama and Guantanamo Bay. He was obviously and deservedly proud of his service. After that, not much to say about my hiking day. I had sorted some food into the top of my pack for lunch, but never stopped hiking due to the temps. I knew if I stopped, I’d have a hard time getting warm again. It poured rain like piss out of a boot from 8 until 10 (a saying I heard from my father that seems to imply a lot of rain, but why is your boot full of urine in the first place? Questions must be asked) then settled into a steady shower for most of the day, occasionally mixed in with a short downpour or a light drizzle. Walking around puddles was pointless, so I didn’t. But Mandy, was it some cold water. My rain jacket held out until 2pm when it started to wet-through in spots, very few things are truly waterproof. I just kept my focus on 22.5 miles while still enjoying what is truly a pretty trail through the state. Pic above is from one of the few views not socked in by clouds and rain. I made it to Maria’s house at 4pm, a wet, cold, dripping rat of a hiker I’ve read about Maria’s place before, it’s not technically a hostel and she takes in only three hikers per night. At 92 she’s only got so much energy. After a 20 minute hot shower I felt warm again. Maria had set up a drying rack in front of her radiant heater for my clothes. She apologized for not driving me to the laundromat, but she had an auto accident a few weeks ago and has decided to give up driving. I ordered a pizza from a local place and sat with Maria at her kitchen table as she fed me hot tea, Nilla Wafers, and chocolates. If I were playing Hanzel in some macabre story - I would have died a warm and happy runaway. When my pizza arrived, I shared it with Maria as she told me about being a war-bride from Italy. She had left the where she had worked and hitched into Piza to get a job. She married a GI at 17 and moved to Connecticut with her husband who told her “I don’t know where we’ll live or what we’ll do” but things turned out alright in the end. I’m going to lounge here Monday morning and help her turn the rooms over for three new hikers tomorrow. It’s supposed to rain until 10am and I’ve got two days to cover the 20 miles into Great Barrington. Side note: two days ago while doing a steep climb I cracked me head against a protruding rock. Now that I got in front of a mirror I see I bruised my melon in style and that it was apparently a bleeder. Inspecting my hat, I found this to be the case. Lesson learned to watch for obstacles?

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638286,"One of my favorite manager bromides is “tell your story backwards” - simply give me the decision/conclusion/incident and then we’ll decide how much backstory we need. 
So, story backwards: I thought I had an easy half marathon walk today that became my most humbling day on the trail and if you’re keeping score at home - my first (and second) fall on Day 50. 

Story forwards:
I slept in until 6 am at then did Spanish lessons in bed. The other two hikers at Maria’s were getting a shuttle at 7:30, while I didn’t plan to leave until 9;30. After they had left I striped all the beds and collected towels as Maria’s grandson wasn’t available this weekend to help her. So I made up the beds with fresh sheets and did a quick bathroom clean for her as well. Going downstairs I made some eggs, toast and coffee for myself per her instructions (she even had the frying pan sitting out for me with bacon grease already in it). Maria had told us the night before that she doesn’t put in her hearing aids until 8:50 and doesn’t get up before nine. 

Thankfully, my hiking clothes had dried out over night and even my shoes were 2/3rds dry. I got repacked and put my gear outside and true to her word, Maria came out at 9 for her morning waffles. I told her since she enjoyed the pizza last night she could keep it as leftovers as I wasn’t going to pack it out. She tried to give me a $5 discount off my nighf’s stay for taking care of the beds and bathroom, but I told her the two Pepsi’s, three cups of hot tea and the Nilla wafers from last night were worth 5 bucks. On my way out the door she gave me a hug and told me she’d be praying for my safety. I’m glad I stayed here. 

So back to my easy hiking day. There were three climbs on the docket over 2000 feet - the first time I’ve seen that elevation in 400-some miles. The rain had continued all night until about 5 am but the forecast for the rest of Memorial Day was dry. What I hadn’t fully considered was three straight days of heavy rain and what that would do to these steep ascents and downhills. What it did was turn much of the trail into creeks and waterfalls. 

I had 5 miles of steady uphill to get to the start of Bear Mountain. I soon had given up on keeping my feet dry - it just wasn’t possible with all the standing and running water. I had read that going down the North Slipe of Bear Mt could be tricky, especially in wet weather. The climb up was steep but not really much of a struggle and a met quite a few dhikers who had made the climb and were on their way back to the parking lot. 

After going over the summit, the humbling began. The sheet rock faces you have to go down were in many areas just covered with running water. It was difficult to look from above at a 8-14 foot drop and figure out how the hades I’d be able to get down. About a quarter of the way down, I didn’t. I had the classic “both feet slip simultaneously” fall and ended up on my backside sliding down a muddy rock face. Dammitt. Made it to Day 50 and now - bam!  I was kind of miffed that I wouldn’t finish the trail “clean”. 

Five minutes later, the real fun happened. There was another massive boulder about 10-12 feet high that I had to go down. It looked like there was a nice little ledge across its face I could use to traverse sideways down the rock to the far side and then zigzag back. On my third step both of my feet went and I was gravities pawn. I may have had to exclaim “good heavens!” when my right shin stopped my fall by colliding with a small white Birch tree growing out of the rock. Had it not been for that, I would’ve been a** over tea kettle to the next rock 6 feet down. I grabbed the tree with my hand and reoriented myself feet-downhill and lowered to the rock.

Did anyone see? Nope - phew!
Am I ok? Too soon to tell, endorphins running amok
Where’s my gear? One trekking pole next to tree - retrieved. Water purification bottle missing. It’s back up at the top of the rock from whence I fell? Holy Bejeebus, how did that happen?!?
So climb back up, retrieve gear, turn face towards the rock and go down feet first using hand holds to get down. (By the way:,there’s a real good reason Alex Honnold does Free Solo climbs going up and not down, that being gravity is not your buddy). Maybe I should have done this in the first place, but might have ended up with all the skin missing from my face. The real tragedy occurred later as all the twisting and tumbling I did caused a permanent misalignment between my shorts and my skivvies leading to borderline wedgie issues all afternoon  

A little further down I checked myself over and didn’t seem worse for wear other than alarming swelling occurring on my right shin (pic above). The good news was it wasn’t directly on the bone - the tree trunk just missed it. Over the next hour it got to the size you see, but then slowly went down over the last 8 miles. i, on the other hand, was mentally shot. It took me almost an hour to do the .7 mile downhill and then I had two more still to do. i saw two other day hikers take minor falls as well. 

There was so much water running straight down the trails that you could have filled your water bottles. It stayed like that all the way to this shelter. 

About two hours after my fall, I was able to experience what may be the high point of my life to date (I’m still so pleased I’m smiling in my hammock). I was talking with a SOBO section hiker who was telling me of Bear activity in the area. He looked at me and asked if I had fallen, I said yes. He said “did you know you’re bleeding?” and I immediately answered “I ain’t got time to bleed”.  Thankfully he was my age and cracked up at the reference. We parted with mutual “Hurry! Run to da choppa” salutations. (Hit the google machine if you need edification).
So that was my “easy” day. It took me seven and a half hours to cover 13.1 miles and I lost some confidence along the way. Tomorrow is a short mileage day (two more steep downhills, I don’t anticipate they’ve dried out) then a road walk into Great Barrington, Massachusetts where I’ll be staying two nights and taking a zero on Wednesday. Sev needs a full day off. 

Please fell free to drop any comments or questions in the Guest Book (drop down menu) and I’ll respond on Wednesday. 

Thanks to everyone reading this who served our country in the military. A special mention for my father in-law, Lee, who’s brother Lupe was killed in action in the Mediterranean Sea in World War Two.  Hope you had a fall-free Memorial Day!","Salisbury, Connecticut

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638353,"When I got to the shelter area last night I had a good conversation with a hiker named Gangster who had been off trail for the weekend at a friend’s place in Boston. We talked gear and hiking tramilies and then talked about how tough that hike from Salisbury was. At least it wasn’t just me. Slept a bit fitfully when I would bump one of my new owies, my elbow most of all. I’ve also been fighting a cold bug for a few days and the coughs got to me more than once.I had a ride a scheduled to pick me up at Rt. 7 at 10:15, so I got on trail before six. The first bit was the same water track as the day before, but gradually cleared up into occasional puddles and mud bogs. I (hopefully) gave myself plenty of time for the downhill sections that were in the first half of the hike and though there were some tricky spots, I was incident free today. The weather was actually nice up on the ridge (today’s pic) but the fog was very heavy down in the valleys. I did a good job keeping my feet dry going down the hill but it didn’t matter because there was about a mile of pasture walking and the grass was drenched from the fog and then so was I. This is fine. For the fourth day running I crossed paths with a group of SOBO hikers who are out for a week’s hiking. They hike SOBO and there’s another group hiking NOBO and they hand off car keys as they pass and then one group picks up the other. All kinds of ways to hike!I got to my pick up point about 40 minutes early and took a seat. I took a little more in depth inspection of yesterday’s tumbles and found a few more bruises and scrapes but still nothing mission critical. I got myself as town presentable as I could and waited.And waited. And waited. And my scheduled ride never showed up. So I started on the 3 mile road walk to the CVS pharmacy. 50 yards into my walk and GREAT GOOGILY-MOOGILY a pickup pulled over on the shoulder in front of me. A local business owner named Cindy offered me a ride into town! She drove 5 minutes out of her way to drop me right at the pharmacy. I was overwhelmed with gratitude. Resupply done, I walked to the post office 10 minutes away and picked up a food box from home and my glasses that I had been without for four weeks. So any typos or grammatical errors are mine and not to be blamed on my lack of clear vision. I’m now at the Fairfield Inn in Great Barrington for tonight and for a zero tomorrow. I’ve got some gear to repair tomorrow and some beer to drink (maybe).  Going to go have a soak in the hot tub and get some rest and downtime.","
","Great Barrington, Ma.","Jun 01, Tue",7.90
Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638401,"Just a nice zero today. I hurried towards nothing, drinking too much coffee this morning then heading to the dollar store 10 minutes away for a few things. My only firm plan was to check out the local brewery this afternoon. One of the things I picked up was some shoe spray deodorizer because my Merrill’s- while doing a fantastic job healing my feet - smelled like roadkill after four days of being wet. I know it’s kinda pointless - the trail will be wet again tomorrow, but at least for 24 hours I can cohabitate with my shoes. I had double wrapped them in plastic bags and shoved them in the closet of my room when I checked in yesterday. I did introduce  myself to the Hotel pool and hot tub, which was niiiiiice. They just changed all the Covid rules here in the People’s Republic of Massachusetts and there were no restrictions on pool use (though no one else came the three times I was there today).  All the businesses in town have been changing their signage to reflect the new-old normal. I went to the brewery around 1 and had their kielbasa special and a beer for $27 - welcome to the Northeast. On the way back to the hotel I stopped at a confectionery shop and bought some espresso chocolates to celebrate National something or other day.Then back to the hotel for more doing nothing and a second run of my clothes through the laundry.My sister had asked in the Guest Book what I missed the most besides family and how much my pack weighs right now. What I do miss are familiar faces, it can be a little solitary on the trail and it’s interesting how those daily short conversations I’d have with my co-workers really help me mentally. My pack weight right now is unknown, I think it’s around 25 lbs with water and food but until I get to a hostel with a pack scale I don’t know for sure. I really don’t notice the pack much once it’s on and I’m moving (unless it’s causing me to fall).  I’m still probably carrying more clothing than a true ultralighter would have like two T-shirts and three pairs of socks. My toiletries kit is a little over full too because I’m still heavy on bandaids and foot care products. I’ll probably do another shakedown once the weather warms up for good, should that day ever occur. Also thanks to Kaylie W. for dropping some Newt-knowledge on me!I called to schedule a shuttle ride for tomorrow only to find out the shuttle driver died on Saturday.  Wow.  Second  call placed and now I have a ride back to the trail at 8:30 in the morning.  The crazy weather continues with highs in the 90’s starting Friday  I’m going to try and dial back my mileage a bit as I want to get to New Hampshire and the White Mountains in good shape as that is where it’s often said “the trail really begins”.Also, cell coverage may be spotty the next week so I may not have a nightly post, but I’ll get one up as some as I have connection the next day.","
",Not moving ,"Jun 02, Wed",0
Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638443,"My timing for leaving the hotel this morning was pretty good, as the rain tapered off about 30 minutes before my shuttle arrived at 8:30. My driver was a retired planning commissioner for the city and now runs shuttle on a donations-based system for hikers coming into Great Barrington. Papa Joe - as he is called - also supplies a water cache about 8 miles north of town after the climb back up the ridge. Super nice guy. 
Forecast for the day was very humid and cloudy with afternoon rain and countless mosquitoes. My thought was to hike with one eye on the weather so as to set up camp before the heavens opened. Stealth camping in Massachusetts is strictly verboten...well, actually up until last Saturday ANY camping in Massachusetts was illegal due to Covid, but now they’re back to only stealth being outlawed. Consequently, planning your day can be dicey as the designated sites aren’t always convenient. 
I’ve been fighting what I think is a cold bug since last week and as my family, friends and coworkers can attest: when I get a cold it goes right to my chest and I start hacking and coughing like a donkey with tuberculosis. (I’m my mother’s son, but this I get from my pop).  So I’ve been congested and yesterday the cough started. A mile and a half out of town the climbing began and two hours later I was in a state. I wasn’t sure anymore if I had a cold or maybe something more along the lines of a bronchial infection or pneumonia. It seemed like each step brought on a fit of coughing or wheezing hard to catch my breath. I was launching enough nasal-rockets to make Elon Musk take note. I was ready to call for a shuttle at the next road crossing and head back to town for more zero days. 
So then I did what any strong fella would do and called my wife. She assured me that after talking to me for half an hour last night that I sounded normal awful and not specifically awful and that maybe I was just pushing too hard on the hike.  As we were speaking I came to a view called “The Ledges” and stopped for a bit to chill out. Both the call and the timeout helped (though the mosquitoes started to swarm)  and once I started walking again, calm returned and by going waaaaay slow on the uphills I no longer risked rupturing my esophagus. I can only imagine what my wife was saying to herself after hanging up with me. 
A short while later Grumpy Cat came past me with Sundance and Gidget in tow. We all headed for a shelter a mile ahead for a break. Sundance has been hiking with GC for a few weeks now and is called a “Platinum Blazer”, meaning he usually stays in motels when hiking as he is also being supported by his wife who is driving along the trail most days.  Gidget is from Rochester, Mi and is hiking with her dog. This is the first dog I’ve seen that doesn’t  actually hike.  It’s about a 4 lb dog that Gidget tucks into a special compartment in her pack made for the little diggity. Too funny. I didn’t even know she had a dog until she unpacked it! Gidget moved on first and I followed shortly after, though I never saw her again today.  
I got to the South Wilcox shelter at 2:30 but stopping at 11 miles would make for a very short day or a very long day tomorrow during what promises to be a very rainy day. So I pushed on two more miles to North Wilcox shelter where I intended to stay but then saw there was no cell signal and no bear box listed as being available.  After consultations with GC and Sundance (who were hiking one mile more for their pick-up) i pondered things  
Hmmmmmm.
*Checks Guthook App*
Four miles to the Shaker campsite, mostly kind trail, should still beat the rain.  Let’s go  
So I did the last four miles in about an hour and forty minutes and did indeed beat the rain  when I arrived I saw Free and Captain America already set up as well as Chef whom I met for the first time  Turns out Chef just had her first fall after 1600 miles and Captain fell twice today  You know what they say: slippery loves company. We all ate dinner with clouds of mosquitoes hovering around, though I wasn’t very hungry and only managed to eat about 800 calories.
I lounge now in my trusty hammock (one small tear recently repaired) and the rain is just starting to fall  Free and I are having a coughing contest, though my causes are not the same as his  There may be a short window around 6 am with no rain, so perhaps a mostly dry pack up will be possible. I’m going to let tomorrow figure itself out tomorrow.  Campsites are 10 miles away and 19 miles away but at least the rain won’t be hypothermic.  There is some talk of a guy who lives nearly on the trail up a ways who opens his property to hikers so they can camp and also talk of maybe hitching into Town and splitting hotel rooms.  
This will all be fine.","Great Barrington, Ma.
",Shaker Campsite,"Jun 03, Thu",17.70
Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638492,"Last night’s rain wasn’t nearly as heavy as predicted. I still lazed in bed longer than usual but got up when I heard others stirring. I even ate this morning before hiking as I really couldn’t bring myself to eat last night. So I had some Steve’s Paleocrunch Granola (1000 calories) and hit it at 6:20.  
There were only two designated camping areas in reach - Upper Goose Pond at 10 miles and October Mountain at 18.8 miles. Yesterday talk was of maybe jumping off the trail due to the rain or doing short miles before the thunderstorms arrived. I decided to get to Goose Pond first and then see what was what. The rain did arrive about 9, but by that time I was soaked anyway due to the high humidity and having to walk through some pasture grass. So the rain gear stayed packed away.  I did make a quick side trip to the AT stand - a roadside stand that offers cold drinks for a dollar, free water refill, charging station and a garbage can. Super sweet. 
The rain stopped after about 45 minutes and just went back to maximum muggy.  There was no breeze to be felt so I just tried to keep a nice steady pace and make sure my breathing didn’t bring on a coughing fit. When I got to the Upper Goose Pond side trail I checked the weather and the forecast for rain had gone away. Had thus been Sunday (predicted to be 90 degrees) I may have stopped anyway and spent the afternoon swimming. But with the ATC Shelter here still closed, I moved along.
A mile or so later I was at a road crossing and there was a lodge just a short walk up the road. The Berkshire Lakeside Lodge was listed in the guide as “hiker friendly” and as having water available. When I got there a woman was coming out of one of the rooms she was cleaning and I asked if I might get some water and take a break at their picnic table. She was happy to show me the refill station and also let me know they had sodas for sale for a dollar. Bingo!  I sat outside and had two Coke’s and ate a meal bar while doing some Spanish lessons. Muy Bueno!  When I went to leave I ducked my head in the office to say thanks and they handed me a home baked chocolate chip muffin - muy, muy bueno!! I packed it away for later. 
The afternoon trail had the whiff of Pennsylvania about it with lots of rocks that required some concentration and care. I didn’t hurry much as I only had 7 miles to do. Dudley went the whole day without a mishap, which hadn’t happened in a while and was quite welcome. 
I got to the camping area right at four and Just Tim was sitting at the picnic table. I had been at Maria’s Hostel with he and Forager last Sunday. Turns out Just Tim is having a foot problem that may actually be a stress fracture and could take him off trail. I feel just awful for him, no one wants to leave due to an injury.  Shortly after Captain America arrived followed by Chef (who didn’t stop at Goose Pond, either) and then Grumpy Cat who slack packed part of the day and then hiked with a six pack of Space Dust, two of them still in cans, the other four inside him! I think I’d just lay down in the middle of the trail if I drank four IPA’s in 90 minutes while hiking. 
Then the real crowd arrived: two troops of scouts from Connecticut out for a two night excursion. Every spot of ground has a tent on it. My hammock is surrounded. Captain America said he feels like he’s on deployment again and living in tent city. This should be interesting as they’ll be up late and we hikers will be up early.  
This is fine.","Shaker Campsite
",October Mountain Shelter,"Jun 04, Fri",18.80
Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638556,"So other than a phone call from a parent around 9:15 last night, the Boy Scouts were good neighbors. I had my headphones on and fell asleep listening to The Jesus and Mary Chain channel on Spotify and was only disturbed from my slumber with the aforementioned call and when the boys came back after having their evening s’mores. I packed up as quietly as possible and was trail ready at 5:45.  I talked with the troop leader just before leaving and their group was going to go 9 miles to Upper Goose Pond for the night. Hopefully there was a little more elbow room for them there. 

True to what he had told me, Just Tim was already on trail to cover the 12 miles to town on his gimpy foot. That meant no silk blazing for Sev!  I figured it would take me until noon to get to town and then decide about where to camp the next few days. The trail itself wasn’t too taxing the first 8 miles though there were a lot of bogs and mud to work through. Most of the bog areas have raised boards spanning the worst parts, but the boards are of dubious quality due to age and exposure. You really can’t trust them to be level or well secured, so it’s “step lightly and be prepared” as you traverse them. On occasion you might find one that isn’t actually nailed to its support and the opposite end pops up.  Good times!
It was less humid than the last two days and temps were in the low 70’s most of the morning.  There was a woman known as “The Cookie Lady” who lived just off trail about 3 miles from the shelter and she had given free cookies to passing hikers for a long time, but she sold her place two years ago.  There is a apparently a new Cookie Lady who looks our for hikers and they have water refills and allow camping too, but she and her husband wouldn’t be at the house until next week. Alas. No cookie for me. 
I caught up to Just Tim about halfway to town and he was hurting. Just sucks to see someone with an injury and see the discouragement written all over them. 

I made really good time and came down the muddy hill into Dalton, Ma. at 11:15. Walking into town I came to the house of Tom Levardi who has been a Trail Angel to hikers for 40 years.  His home is directly on the trail and he happened to be outside when I came by. He invited me over to his picnic table and offered me a Coke.  We sat and chatted for 20 minutes about many things hiking (the ultralight equipment is the single biggest change he’s seen - hikers use to come in with 80lb packs. I wouldn’t make it).  He also recommended a coffee shop and sub shop in town and said if I wanted to stretch my mileage that the Father Tom campsite in Cheshire was nice. While there I called the outfitter in Cheshire to see if they had water filtration systems for sale but they only had the Sawyer Mini in stock, so I’ll stick with my slow, leaky Katadyn for now.  I had thought about camping at Tom’s for the night, but decided to move on as there was another camping area 4 miles out of town.  

I did hit up the coffee shop (16oz Mocha, please) and the sub shop next door (12” triple cheeseburger sub with piles of veggies, vitamin water, bag of chips for $13) and then the gas station across the street (two Powerades and a chocolate milk).  Grumpy Cat, Captain America and Rapture all arrived then as well as Just Tim who planned to go the local urgent care and take two zero days to see what comes next.  

Caloried up, I left Dalton (I thought it’d be bigger) about two hours after I arrived.  Had about a 1000 foot climb out of town and I really didn’t want to do give-backs with lunch, so I just plodded slow and steady up the trail. About halfway up a man came running past me down the trail - he wasn’t quite outfitted like most trail runners. A little further on I found his wife sitting Trailside - she said they had dropped a car off and driven back in another so they could hike one way, but her husband had left the car keys back at the parking lot. Oops.  I’m not entirely sure This Was Fine.
Arriving at the side trail to the Crystal Mountain Campsite it was only 2:30 and the Father Tom camp was just 4 miles further.  Can you guess what I did?
On the way down the mountain into Cheshire I stopped to talk to a man who was hiking up.  Turns out his wife has been the driving force in establishing the Father Tom site with a lot of community involvement. They have tenting space, hammock poles, a bear box, Port a John, water spigot, charging station, picnic tables, chairs and two loaner bikes for hikers. All free. Pretty awesome. 

I hit Cheshire at 4:30 and the ice cream stand across from the camp was still open. One chocolate milkshake later I was at Father Tom’s setting up. (Strangely, the ice cream stand is only open Saturday and Sunday from noon until five. Bully for me on my timing!) There were three SOBO section hikers here and GC, Capt America and Rapture rolled in an hour later.  GC and I took the bikes to a gas station two miles away for some sustenance - my bike had the charming quirk of a loose handle bar so as I rode it would lurch about in exciting ways.  I bought two Gatorade’s (gave one to Rapture) and splurged on dinner - $1.99 for some cashews. I was still full from lunch.  

While we were sitting at the picnic table a local Trail Angel named Polish Hermit came by and handed out more drinks and some snacks.  He does this to honor his Polish Grandmother who would feed the hobos who came through town back during the depression when they had nothing to eat.  He’ll be back in the morning with coffee for anyone who hasn’t rolled out by 6.  I may wait!
One other thing I did today was call and get a room at the Bascom Lodge on top of Mt Graylock - which I’m climbing on the morrow.  It’s going to be 90 and I don’t have to do big miles over the next two weeks as I try to time my arrival in New Hampshire with my sister's planned visit there.  I have a room for $35 with shower facilities and I’ll be doing some bum-laundry in there along with cleaning myself.  

Grumpy Cat flies out Wednesday for his official Green Beret retirement celebration and Rapture and Captain America were making plans to fly to Atlanta Tuesday to pick up CA’s van and drive it up to the northeast and then use that and Rapture’s car to do self-supported slack packing through New England.  Hike your own hike, baby!","October Mountain Shelter
",Father Tom Campsite,"Jun 05, Sat",20.50
Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638613,"So the Father Tom campsite is so named in honor of a local Catholic priest who provided shelter for hikers at St Mary of the Assumption parish in Cheshire. Father Tom was an avid hiker himself, but passed away in 2018, so the community has established this site to continue to provide support for hikers for years to come. The Polish Hermit came by at 4:45 and dropped off coffee for everyone, so the day started early!
Still dealing with this stupid cold and knowing I had only an 8 mile, 2500 foot climb on the docket for the day, plod plod plod was my plan.  I hiked the first mile then took a short road walk back to last night’s gas station for a coffee and also to buy another Gatorade to pack up to the top of Mt Greylock.  As I was leaving Grumpy Cat rolled in to get loaded up for the day as well.  

The hike was steep but wasn’t too strenuous or technical and I even caught a breeze from time to time depending on which side of the ridge I happened to be on.  I didn’t stop for more than 30 seconds for some water breaks as I climbed and by 10:30 I had reached the summit where the mountain is topped by a war memorial erected in the 1930’s and the Bascom Lodge near by. I climbed up the tower to check out the views from the top but got the evil eye from a couple who didn’t appreciate my well earned hiker perfume that had accumulated over the last four days of hiking. So I didn’t tarry and went back down, leaving them to deal with my fumes. I have a much more full appreciation for the Pigpen character in Charles Schulz’s Peanuts comic.  I use to identify more with Charlie Brown due to my large, bald head.  I guess I’m evolving.
Sitting in the shade at the base of the tower a day hiker struck up a conversation with me. He is planning a though hike in 2023 and was very interested in what I was carrying. Being that I had two hours to pass before I could check in, I unpacked my bag and gave him the rundown. I also realized I could (and probably will) shave another 1.5 pounds from my kit from extra clothing I don’t really need.

Shortly after that the guys I stayed with at Father Tom’s arrived and I sat with them while they had lunch at the lodge. I waited to eat myself and do a late lunch/early dinner as they were open for service until 4:30 and I wasn’t interested in their $39 dinner sitting at 7pm. Later I had hot dogs, chicken salad and a 20 oz beer, so I didn’t go wanting. 

Once checked in I got cleaned up and did shower laundry then took the wet stuff outside to dry while I called my parents.  Then I started reading a book on Grierson’s Calvary Raid during the Vicksburg campaign in the Civil War.  Paint drying to some, interesting to me!
A section hiker named Swede checked in later in the afternoon, he’s out doing a 600 mile tune up in preparation to hike the Colorado Trail in July.  He thru hiked the AT five years ago (I don’t know how that’s possible when he looks to be 20) and had some good advice to share about the hike in front of me in New Hampshire.  

I’m still trying not to think too far ahead, planning even two or three days out makes my head hurt.  I’ll likely get going early tomorrow and pass up the 8am continental breakfast here as temps will again be near 90 before two days of stormy weather arrive.  I will probably do a half mile road walk to a grocery store mid morning for a light resupply to take me into Vermont.  
Hard to believe that I should cross the 900 mile mark by week's end and that I’ll still have nearly 1300 miles to go!","Father Tom Campsite
",Bascom Lodge,"Jun 06, Sun",8.19
Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638755,"‘Twas truly a “green tunnel” day, as the AT is sometimes called. Walking through the rocks, roots, ruts and mud of forested southern Vermont.  Early in the day I had a long and steep downhill to Rte 9 which goes into Bennington and I was glad it was mostly dry.  After crossing the road it was right back up again for about 8 miles until you reach Glastonbury Mountain. Was another hot day in the mid 80’s so I did make a concerted effort to not just carry water, but actually drink it - I’m told that’s key.
While hiking today I tried to remember as many names and faces as I could from my third grade class with Mrs Olsen (who often wore dresses far too short, according to some).  Then I had a Bob Marley tune running through my head and I’d occasionally sing out “Buffalo sol-DIER” to the trees.  Lots and lots of toads of all sizes were hopping around including one that had a reddish tint to it.  Do toads crossbreed with other species of toads?  What’s the zip code of every place I’ve lived in my life?  What were the addresses? I wonder what recalls Ford has issued since I’ve been gone from work.  I hope they replaced the laminator that broke  - Marisol or Annette can get that handled.
That’s kind of a typical “what do I think about when I’m hiking” montage.  It’s amazing what will just float in to my mind, rattle about for a few minutes, then float away.  Just the other day I remembered my Aunt Bernie teaching me a song about John Brown’s baby having a cold upon it’s chest while we were on a car ride more than 45 years ago.  Why? Who the heck knows.  But there it was, parked on some dark alley in the synapses of my brain to emerge, unbidden, almost half a century later when walking in the Massachusetts woods.  
I pulled into the Glastonbury shelter at 12:30 and took a half hour break before deciding to move on, now that the predicted thunderstorms were to arrive at five instead of two.  I chatted briefly with someone hiking the Long Trail and a section hiker named Red Raven who it turned out was a yooper.  She lived outside Escanaba for many years and also went to school in Grand Rapids.  
The four miles from the Glastonbury shelter here to the Kid Gore shelter were pretty rocky and getting them done before the rain made me happy.  The shelter itself had no room for tents or hammocks by it, but there’s an area 200 feet further up the trail that supposedly had space.  Well, there was space for one tent and one hammock and both were claimed.  If I had only a tent, I would have been out of luck.  I did find some good trees to hang from with rocks underneath, so as long as I’m careful getting in and out, all should be well.
After setting up and cleaning up I went back to the shelter to eat some dinner.  There was another Long Trail hiker and a section hiker staying in the shelter and two AT hikers as well - Iceberg and Quicksilver. Iceberg is finishing his Covid-interrupted hike from last year and Quicksilver is a fellow flip flopper who is also a Michiganian, hailing Livonia. Red Raven then turned up as well and everyone talked about all things trail. I bragged about the time in the Shenandoah’s where I stayed in my rack for 14 hours without having to get up to urinate - maybe my proudest accomplishment to date.  As a fellow hammocker, Quicksilver said that there is a technique to being able to pee into a bottle without leaving one’s hammock. I have to tip my cap to him, as I think I lack the coordination to pull that trick off. 
The rains started at 5, so I got under my tarp and into my hammock just in time. About 5:30 a big thunderstorm passed just south of here and we got hammered with rain for almost an hour. I think I’m well situated to ride out the other storms headed this way though I do expect to have a lot of damp gear come morning. I’ve got a 1700 foot climb tomorrow up and over 3940 ft Stratton Mountain. 
I called and reserved a bunk at the Green Mountain House hostel in Manchester Center for Thursday night as I desperately need to do some laundry. I’ve also been going over my kit in my mind the last few days and plan on making some changes when I get to Hanover, NH in 10 days or so.  I’m going to try and shave another 2 2 lbs from my set up.  We shall see.","Congdon Shelter

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638720,"I did not go out last night to watch the sunset from Mt Greylock, but I did make it out this morning to watch the sunrise - it was spectacular.  I had already 95% packed last night, so when I went back into the bunk room at the lodge I was ready for the trail in just a few minutes. I decided not to wait for the coffee and muffins at 8 am.  How good can a muffin actually be?


It was already 74 degrees at 6 and promised to get hotter.  I had about 6 miles to hike down to North Adams, Ma where there was a grocery store .5 miles of the trail.  About a mile short of town I passed a flip-flopper named Sojourner who I had briefly seen at Father Tom’s two nights previous. I slowed my pace and chatted with him during the descent.  That dude is a PLANNER.  He had broken down the entire trail before he started, picking the shelters he’d be at, how many miles each day, he even had booked reservations in Bangor, Maine in two months!  Non refundable!  He’s been trying to cut weight from his pack, but hasn’t had much luck. 


At the grocery store I did a light resupply (tortillas and peanut butter) and grabbed some lunch as well - two Gatorades, Buffalo chicken wrap and a whole mess of sliced pineapple.  I sat outside at a shady picnic table to enjoy my repast.  15 minutes later Sojourner came out with his purchases and I saw why he had trouble cutting pack weight as he bought two different lotions, shoe inserts (just in case) and some more food. 


By the time I got back hiking it was 83 degrees and climbing, which is what I had to do as well leaving town.  About a mile later I ran into an area that just had a fire about two weeks ago.  The burned area was quite extensive and I probably hiked through it for at least an hour.  Around eleven I crossed over the border into Vermont and started on the Long Trail which the AT shadows for about 100 miles. The Long Trail runs the length of Vermont north to south and is the oldest long distance hiking trail in the US.  


Having said that, I was surprised at how overgrown this first section of Vermont turned out to be. There were times when the branches and underbrush were so thick I couldn’t actually see my feet and had to lower my head like a running back hitting the hole.  It wasn’t really well marked in places either, leading to some guesswork on which way to go - more on that later.


I took a break at 2:30 at a shelter that was thirteen miles into my day.  After getting water I contemplated life for a bit, trying to choose between calling the end to a hot day or hiking 7 more miles before a day of rain sets in. Dry miles won again and I moved on. 


So a week ago on Monday I suffered my first and second falls about five minutes apart. This Monday I had two bear encounters about three minutes apart!  As I was coming down a muddy, rocky and steep section just before a beaver pond I looked up in response to a noise to my right and 40 feet away staring right at me was a juvenile bear.  I no sooner saw it then it about-faced and ran off into the trees. I had no time to get a picture, but I did pull my phone out for a quick after action report.


Putting my phone away I continued down and not 50 yards later there is a crashing sound to my left and I see another, slightly larger bear running off into the underbrush on that side of the trail.  Perfect bear encounters: I got to see them and they ran like mad away from me!


I was so jazzed by all of this that 20 minutes past the beaver pond I missed a trail turn and ended up hiking nearly a mile in the wrong direction down a two-track mud run.  In my defense, there were a lot of footprints in the mud, indicating I wasn’t the only one to make this error.  Still, I was ticked off at the 40 minute delay that resulted from having to backtrack and find the trail.


I got to the shelter area a little after six and set up.  I had no cell signal and it took almost 45 minutes to get a satellite text sent through my Garmin InReach to my wife.  I had begun to wonder if this was going to be the first night on trail where I couldn’t let her know where I was.  Also here is Odysseus, who is a section hiker plus.  He comes out to the trail for 7-10 windows of time and RUNS the AT.  In this stretch he’s on he’s had a 50 mile day and a 45 mile day.  And here I was thinking I had no new inadequacies to catalog.  He’s been doing these section runs since 2018.  My mind boggles.Swede came into camp at 7:30 and described to me in detail just how good was the muffin he waited for at Bascom Lodge.  I remain skeptical.  


So I lie here pretty tuckered out from the heat but happy with another interesting and fun day on the AT.  I tell myself that everyday out here is a blessing and that enjoying the here and now needs to be my primary focus.  I’m getting better at this!","Bascom Lodge

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639000,"Well, nothing went bump in the night so I slept pretty well, though it did get colder then I anticipated and around one I had to layer up a bit. 
Back at the trail I had a small river to cross where the bridge was unusable. I tried my darndest to make it as difficult as possible before realizing there was a nice rock-step crossing about 15 feet from where I was attempting a tightrope walk on a log. I gave up on stubborn, went back to the bank and went across where the sane people do.  
The trail was still quite muddy and wet but I was determined to keep my damp shoes from getting soaked before my short mile day was done so I wouldn’t have to walk around town in squishy kicks. My determination mattered little to Dudley, who promptly slipped off a rock and dunked himself in a puddle. What a jerk. 
So I motored along and got to the road crossing at 8:30 with pancakes on my mind. Trying to improve my chances at getting a five mile hitch into Manchester Center, I ducked into the woods on the other side of the road and changed into my cleanest clothes so I would look my most fetching. Back up on the road I tossed out my thumb and waited.  To my everlasting surprise, after 15 minutes a guy in a Toyota Celica pulled over and asked if I needed a lift. I jumped into the front seat with my backpack in my lap so we wouldn’t get killed by traffic on the side of the road. Turns out he’s an event planner on his way to an author event at the cool independent bookstore in town which was about half a block from the restaurant I was headed to. 
Me and the Hungry Hiker special met and became fast friends, though the friendship was destined to be a short one as only one of us would leave the joint alive. I sat at the counter and watched the five ladies who worked there absolutely kick butt getting food out of a very busy kitchen. And they all seemed to be enjoying themselves. 
I went to the bookstore and spent 45 minutes browsing around. It was such a cool place and made me a little wistful that independent stores like this are a thing of the past. It’s good I was hiking and won’t carry extra weight, otherwise I could’ve dropped some serious coin there. 
After picking up some chocolate milk and Gatorade and Arnold Palmer ice tea at a gas station, I went to the park and enjoyed the morning doing Spanish lessons while chugging liquids while my shoes dried in the grass. Being a bum with time on your hands has it’s advantages. 
Then over the to Depot Street Burgers for today’s main attraction - a burger and a beer. Both were excellent as were the French fries, but 1/4 mile walk back to the grocery store was interesting as I was so stuffed I felt like a parade float.  Quick resupply at the store for the next few days (peanut butter, tortillas, and protein bars) I called the hostel and got picked up 15 minutes later. 
This Hostel is really top notch. Huge living room/hiker lounge, free reign of the kitchen, super nice owner, free laundry and most of all - showers with water pressure!  After getting my food sorted out and getting cleaned up I did laundry and hung out. Two hikers who were at the Kid Gore shelter two nights ago were here (Cat and Trail Spice) along with Iceberg and Quiksilver. Quiksilver’s wife arrived in the afternoon as she is going to hike the next three days with him. I went to dinner with the three of them, though I skipped ordering an entree and went with an appetizer, which to my hiker shame, I couldn’t finish. 
Back at the hostel, Iceberg asked if I would be interested in slack packing 18 SOBO miles back to the hostel tomorrow - yup, in!  So we’ll be leaving tomorrow at 6 am to get dropped off for the hike back. I’m going to use a daypack with some light lunch, water bottles, and sundries.  Probably about 7 pounds l told. 
In related news, there is a pack scale here so I weighed my full kit with four days of food and two liters of water and it came in at 26 pounds, which isn’t bad, but I still think I can cut some more weight when I get to Hanover and do a refit. 
Until tomorrow!","William Douglas Shelter

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638915,"Well it rained like it meant it until 11pm last night, then in spurts until 3 am.  I had a good set up with my tarp so I stayed dry as did all my gear.  The little creek I was next to had turned up the volume by 5 am and had gone from a gurgle to a rush.  I traversed the slippery trail back to the shelter to retrieve my bag from the bear box and was finally ready at 6:10. 


It only took about 5 minutes of hiking to realize that any attempt to keep my feet dry would be a fools errand. Water ran freely down the trail and the mud holes were open for business. The biggest thing for the day would be to stay vertical and avoid a costly fall.  About an hour in I did have one slip that caused my left hand to go wrist-deep into a mud puddle. I was on a slight decline and there was a log out of the water that I saw and said to myself: “Self, that looks heckin’ slippery, don’t step on it”. Then I stepped on it and whooshed down it, only stopping a complete fall into the mud by sacrificing my left hand. 


I took a break 4 miles in at a shelter right on the trail and as I was eating my peanut butter tortilla, Iceberg came up.  I ended up hiking the next 7 miles with him and it was nice to talk this and that with someone. We hit the parking lot before the 3.6 mile climb up Mt Stratton and got some trail magic curtesy of Heith.  He was offering large Gatorades which gratefully took and out mine in my pack as a treat for when I got to the top of the mountain.  Up we went on the 1717 foot ascent. Quiksilver passed us about .8 miles from the summit as he’s a pretty strong hiker. 


At the summit there is a caretakers cabin run by the Green Mountain Club and staffed five days a week by a couple who have been doing so for decades. They provide information on the Long Trail and the AT as well as local history.  They told us that they had 4 inches of snow two Sunday’s ago.  


Iceberg, Quiksilver and I then climbed the fire tower to have lunch. Pretty impressive views from the top and also cool and windy, which felt pretty nice after the last few days and the humid morning.  In talking with them it turned out we’re all staying at the Green Mountain House hostel in Manchester Center Thursday night. Quiksilver’s wife will be meeting him there to hike with him for three days. Iceberg is thinking about staying two nights and slack packing 16 miles back to town on Friday. He asked if I was interested, it’ll just depend on how much dinero is involved.


I had been a little leery of the trip down the mountain, given how wet and rocky the trip up was.  But I needn’t have worried as it was pretty tame as long as care was taken.  We got to the Stratton Pond shelter at 3pm and they opted to stay there and have a 10 mile hike to the road crossing into Manchester Center tomorrow.  I decided to hike another 5 miles to the William Douglas shelter to have a shorter hike myself. It wasn’t an easy choice, as this shelter is .5 miles off the trail.


My feet were pretty wrecked from being wet all day and they were quite dirty as well from all the mud that had creeped into my shoes during the day. But I cleaned up and had dinner in front of the shelter and feel fairly human.  It was surprisingly bug free, especially compared to the last two campsites I was at. I’m the only one here tonight so I may not sleep as well if things go bump in the night. 


Tomorrow morning I’ll try my hand at hitchhiking from the road crossing into town. Others (including the hostel owners) write that this is an easy hitch. I guess I’ll find out soon enough. Looking forward to getting laundry done tomorrow and maybe a burger and a brew can be found as well.","Kid Gore shelter

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639057,"Sleep alluded me for a while last night, nothing to do with the hostel itself which is really nice but just one of those nights. I ended up listening to some music for a while and finally drifted off around 11. Around 1 am one of guys sharing my room fell out of bed with a crash, but seemed no worse for wear. Iceberg and I had the the first shuttle out at 6 am to go about half an hour away to slack pack back to the hostel. I borrowed a day-pack from Jeff, the hostel owner and took my two water bottles, food, my Garmin “oh shi*” satellite device, and toilet kit. All told, including the pack I had 7.5 lbs versus my normal 27 or so which makes for a different day. We got to the trail at 6:30 and began our hike south. There were three big climbs on the day and some other various ups and downs. We actually caught three views today! Which is two more than the usual allotment so far in Vermont. We took a break about 3 hours in and had some grub - Iceberg is a positive influence on me when it comes to taking breaks and eating during the day as he actually does so instead of just intending to do so as is my usual schtick.Ran into some trail magic in the form of a free banana, courtesy of day hiker Yonder who was at one of the three views we had on the day. We met the other hikers who were at the hostel and were hiking northbound. I also ran into Yak and Whispers who I hadn’t seen for a few weeks. And when we finished at the end of the day Captain America was there with his RV.  He gave us each a Gatorade and then Rapture arrived from the woods as well.  Captain showed me the inside of his rig, it’s very cool.  He and Rapture are using the van and a car to self-support some slacking for the last 500 miles of the trail.  Iceberg and I then successfully got a hitch from Kathleen, who was going into town and dropped us at a place for an early dinner.  She’s a hiker as well and has done many sections of the trail.My stupid feet were a little balky today as my little toes are still blistering and a heal blister has reappeared on my right heal. Ah well, such is the trail - a constant battle to keep the feet healthy. I’m going to try another pair of shoes next week and see if I can find some improvements. So in the morning it’s back to the place we started today, with maybe a plan to get to Rutland, Va by Sunday afternoon. I’m still trying to time my arrival in Hanover for next weekend to meet my sister who is coming out for a week.  All in all it was a long 17.7 miles, made a little different with the light pack and hiking with Iceberg, but a good day!","US Forest Service Road 10
",Green Mountain House Hostel,"Jun 11, Fri",17.70
Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639162,"Great second night at the hostel and a few more hikers came in later - Yawp, Wrong Way, Girl Scout and Oogie Boogie (who is from Grand Rapids).  They ordered a bunch of pizza and assorted appetizers and did Hiker Folk proud by getting after it in style. Also at the hostel were two women from the Mitten State - Howell and Ann Arbor - section hiking, who insisted they were Michiganders. I don’t even have words. 


It ended up raining all night, but had stopped by the time we were dropped off back at the Forest Service road at 7am.  Iceberg needed to do his morning stretches, so I headed out ahead of him. 


The first hour of today’s hike was uphill along side a beautiful creek with waterfalls, cataracts, pools and eddy’s. Of course if your hiking next to a creek in Vermont the trail is also going to have it’s share of waterfalls, cataracts, pools and eddy’s.  Such is the way. But it was still gorgeous.  Then the trail went partially around Little Rock Pond (let’s be clear, it’s a lake. They just call them ponds in these parts) which was equally pretty in the early morning.  


Then it was a mountain walk through a nature pine forest that was very quiet and peaceful (other than the middle aged man occasionally gasping for breath on the climb). Then I came to a spot called the Rock Garden when people have taken stones from the forest floor and built a whole area of rock cairns. Naturally, the world being what it is, other people climb up here to knock down the rock cairns. So there’s a back and forth regarding this area and whether piling up rocks spoils the natural beauty and violates “Leave No Trace” principals or whether it is whimsical and cool. It’s a real rock fight, that’s for sure. 


I broke for lunch just before noon by taking a side trail to a rock formation named Domed Ledge. Other hikers listed it as a great place to take a break and I’d agree. I sat on my foam mat it the sun and took off my shoes and socks to enjoy the view across the valley to White Rocks where I had been an hour before. It was so chill that I ended up hanging out for 45 minutes before getting back at it. 



Then around two I got a bit of a surprise when I glanced up at a small tree right on the trail and saw a baby porcupine sitting about 10 feet off the ground. Every time I moved, it would move so that it’s back full of quills pointed at me. For the life of me, I couldn’t remember if they shot their quills at you or if you actually had to touch them to get stuck. Taking no chances, I did a wide semi-circle around the tree and back to the trail.Later in the day I did the steep descent into Clareton Gorge with its rushing river and sketchy suspension bridge. Crossing the bridge, I noticed a lot of American Flags attached to it and remembered that Trail Angel Heith had mentioned he might be here in a few days to put up flags and provide more trail magic. Sure enough, he was in the adjacent parking lot and gave me TWO Gatorade.  Iceberg was there as well (he had passed me when I was at Domed Ledge).  Just too kind of him to do this for hikers. 


One strep rocky climb out of the gorge and j was at the campsite for the night. Being that I got here at 4, it was a leisurely set up and then a slow mosey through my food bag for dinner. Quiksilver and his wife Lamb’s Ear came in about 5 after an 18 mile hike.This has been one of my favorite hiking days as Vermont turned on the charm. Tomorrow I’ll be going up up up Killington Mountain and then towards Rutland and the Yellow Deli and then plan for the next 3-4 days into New Hampshire.","

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639185,"Had a very restful night and only hit my snooze button once before getting my day started at 4:55.  I was trail ready at 5:45 and started with a steep climb right away. This is actually my preference, as an uphill section helps get everything warmed up and loose for the day. At one point early on I think I just missed seeing a moose. There was a lot of noise ahead of me and to my left in the underbrush and it sounded like something big was moving away. Then I saw a hoof print in the mud - too large to be a deer, I think.I took a 15 minute break at 8:30 to eat a peanut butter tortilla and a probar before tackling the 4 mile, 2100 foot climb up Mt Killington. It was really interesting terrain going up with missy rocks, creepy looking trees, and occasional mists. It was very Scooby-Do ish. All that was missing was a crooked caretaker looking to scare away meddling kids. I surprised myself by completing the climb by 11 am.  This meant I had six more miles plus a road walk to get to the Long Trail Inn around 2:30 for a beer and late lunch. With that motivation (and the swarming black flies near the summit) I declined to do the .2 mile walk up to the fire tower and instead turned my attention back to the trail. The descent was very rocky (not boulders so much) which put a pounding on my toes. I listened to an audiobook to pass the time and was standing down at Rt 4 by 2:05. I walked the mile to the Inn and had that beer and a Rueben (Irish Pub, don’t ya’ know) and then waited for the bus to Rutland. Iceberg arrived about half an hour before the bus (he did do the Killington climb) as we had decided to go into Rutland for the night and stay at the Yellow Deli Hiker Hostel. Quiksilver and Lamb’s Ear got there just before we left, but they were checking into the Inn for the night. The people here at the Yellow Deli are very helpful and friendly. We were given an iced tea and then were taken upstairs to the hostel. They even offered to carry our packs if we were too tired. After cleaning up and getting situated, Iceberg and I went back down to the deli where we met Quiksilver and Lamb’s Ear for dinner. I’m super impressed with Lamb’s Ear.  She came out and hiked 51 miles of pretty challenging terrain in three days and didn’t seem worse for the wear. She’s flying home tomorrow, but plans on meeting back up with her hubby to do the  100 mile wilderness in Maine next month. After checking the weather for tomorrow, we decided to take a zero here in Rutland and then hike out on Tuesday with a three day plan to get to Hanover, NH.  I plan on bumming around the downtown a bit and going across the street to Walmart to see if I recognize any of the clones I’ve seen at other Walmart’s along the way. I’m trying not to get psyched out by what’s coming in New Hampshire and Maine, which have the toughest trails on the AT, but are universally lauded for the views and scenery. I keep telling myself that everyone who has they hiked the AT manager to get through, and I will too.","Clarendon Shelter

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639217,"So I decided to take a zero day today along with Iceberg and Quiksilver and stay out of the rain for a day while resting up for the last bit of Vermont. We considered doing a nero and hiking to a shelter 10 miles up the trail, but have been cautioned by a local ridge runner that there was a lot of bear activity there and to stay away. Did a mini supply run to the Walmart across the street, buying shaving cream to clear the stubble off of my head and some tortillas. I still have enough food otherwise for the three day run to New Hampshire. I did a short walk around downtown Rutland to work out the foot and leg kinks and discovered 75% of the restaurants are closed on Mondays. I then walked to the other grocery store for a half gallon of chocolate milk that would help me while away the day. Quiksilver came to the hostel after his wife left to catch her flight back home, then we went downstairs to the deli for lunch. They do a brisk business at the Deli, most of what’s on the menu comes from their nearby farm. We then started to look at the upcoming week to ten days as we leave Vermont, enter New Hampshire, and then hike into the White Mountains. I may fall behind Iceberg and Quiksilver during the first part of the Whites while enjoying time with my sister and her friends outside of Hanover, I’ll just have to see how it goes. I’ll fall back on my favorite Eisenhower quote: “plans are worthless, but planning is everything”.  I’m getting exited about these last 500 miles going northbound, the scenery is suppose to be amazing. Plan for the morning is to shuttle back to the trail at 7am, be hiking by 7:30, and do about 18 miles to a campsite.

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639299,"Can’t say enough about how well we were treated by the Yellow Deli/12 Tribes people during the two nights we stayed there. They were only interested in making sure we were comfortable and had what we needed. They even offered to bring us breakfast early as we were leaving at 7am, a half hour before they normally served. Just kind, odd people. Our shuttle driver arrived at 7 to take us up to the trail. Tom is a retired army colonel and is not what you would call the current stereotypical Vermonter. He’s be an awesome neighbor to have. Whenever you were bored you could wander over and strike up a conversation about nearly anything and he’d be off an running with an entertaining and blunt opinion. Started hiking at 7:30 with a plan to go just over 17 miles for the day. There were two steep climbs today over 800 feet each and for the day my Garmin watch claims I climbed the equivalent of 419 flights of stairs. I hiked most of the day around Quiksilver, though he dusted me on the first climb. At the top of that is where we saw the bear print in the mud underneath a power line clearing. Thankfully, the trail wasn’t going the same direction as the bear. 10 miles in we stopped at a shelter for a break and a bite to eat. There were signs posted about recent bear activity there and that the bear had been aggressive seeking food. Iceberg arrived after a few minutes and we kept our eyes peeled for any wildlife. I was hoping that any bear would prefer Iceberg’s tuna wrap instead of my peanut butter and frito tortilla burrito.  Luckily, only a chipmunk came by to check out the offerings. Then it was 7.3 uphill miles fo go to our campsite for the night with one more climb to do to get there.  I also had to make sure and get water about three miles from the destination, as that was the last water before the dry shelter.  I normally carry two liters at the most as I hike, but took and extra liter and a half from the stream.  Doesn’t sound like much, but that’s nearly 10% of my normal pack weight  We arrived at The Lookout at 3:30pm.  It’s a privately owned cabin that they open for hikers to use.  There is a widow’s walk deck on the roof that you reach by a steep ladder and are then treated to some amazing views of the surrounding mountains.  Iceberg is sleeping inside with two hikers who were at the hostel with us but who hiked in SOBO from a road a few miles away and spent the afternoon “blazing” up on the roof. Quiksilver and I both set up our hammocks outside, though it’s raining lightly right now and may rain some more tonight  I’m not equipped to sleep in a shelter and didn’t want to hang from the rafters, in case other hikers showed up later who wanted to stay inside.Tomorrow I’ll likely hike another 15 or so miles over some roller coaster ups and downs, then Thursday hike into Hanover  I didn’t start out liking Vermont much, but the last three or four days of hiking have been pretty nice.  At some point tomorrow afternoon I should cross the 1000 mile mark.  That seems like a lot, until I realize that still leaves 1193 to go!Ah well, one step at a time.

It came up as predicted, which was a relief, and was worth the slight delay in getting packed up this morning. It rained a few times overnight, but only briefly, and the wind kicked up with a purpose but I was unfazed in Hammock Central. Another roller coaster trail today with lots of little ups and downs and a few steep climbs thrown in. The weather was close to perfect, though, with temps in the low 60’s and sunny skies. Hiked mostly by myself for most of the day and had an early lunch at a spot with a great view with Theory, Guacamole, Yak, and Quiksilver. There was a farm store listed on the Guthooks app about 1.8 miles away that sold ice cream and cold drinks. Quiksilver and I did the .3 mile uphill walk only to find out there were closed. Ah well, I didn’t really have high hopes they would be open and I’ll be in Hanover tomorrow and can feed the beast there. The hike today went really well. I had 9.9 miles done by 10 am and got to the target campsite at 1:30pm to complete the 15 mile day. The last four or five days of hiking in Vermont have been very enjoyable and I feel I am as prepared physically as I can be for the upcoming hard hiking in the White Mountains.  Had thought about hiking on, but there aren’t a lot of hammock sites for another 10 miles, so here I stayed. The picture above is of the privy here that they moved from another shelter that was closed a few years ago. As you may have noticed, it give the “percher” a nice view, including a view of those waiting their turn. This is also…fine. Theory and guacamole were here already and originally planned to hike further but called it a day and hung out for the duration.  Theory spent the afternoon, well, theorizing. He’s got a few. He’s got me fairly convinced that I should sleep with a tinfoil hat on at least once in my life.  This is fine. He’s also an amateur firebug fine fire builder and he and Guacamole kept that going all afternoon, too.So tomorrow we’ll have about 14 miles to hike into Hanover, NH.  Iceberg and Quiksilver are staying at a hostel and I’ll be the guest of some awesome Trail Angels - Patricia and Michael - who live just outside of town.  They’re friends of my sister, who is arriving on Friday to spend some time with them and slack pack me around for a few days.

I decided to practice a “rain pack-up”, pretending I had to keep everything dry and under cover as I broke camp. I did pretty well (it helps when you hand out your own grades) and was back to the trail junction at 5:27. Iceberg had headed out a little before me and Quiksilver was drinking his coffee when I left. Had some more roller coaster trail for the first few miles before going down into West Hartford, Vt for a mile road walk. I caught up to Iceberg after an hour as he had stopped to shed some layers and add some bug spray. The trail itself was fairly benign and the weather was just about perfect again. Iceberg and I chatted about TV shows we had watched and this and that.  Iceberg was the one who spotted today’s picture entry just off the trail: a mother raccoon and her three babies. They were chittering and chattering at one another until she convinced them to turn around and head away from us. I did not know that you can refer to a group of young raccoons as a “gaze” until today. And now you know, too!We came across some trail magic at the road into town, courtesy of Karen. So I ate some peanut butter crackers and drank a Coke until we came to the bridge over the White River. It is a tradition with some hikers to jump off the bridge into the water some 25 feet below. I deemed it too cold and me too old to do so. I passed the “if someone told you to jump off a bridge” test. This time. Just across the bridge is a home with a big “AT” sign on their barn and the owner Linda was on the porch. She invited us up for some more trail magic with hot coffee and hard boiled eggs for the asking (yes,l please and no thank you).  We took a 15 minute break before signing her hiker log book, thanking her, and getting back to the road walk. We had a 900 foot climb coming up with about seven miles to go to reach Norwich, Vt.  Iceberg stopped at the bottom of the trail after leaving the road to organize his pack and I started the climb. Felt really good today and having agreeable weather and a soft trail sure helped me along. The next section just flew by and despite a short and awkward encounter with an 8 month old Labrador pup that should have been on a leash, had no trouble moving along. Helped by my early start I got in 10 miles by 10 am for the first time on my hike. I exited the woods onto the road into Norwich and got a third helping of trail magic in the form of a cold bottled water from a cooler provided by Hanover Adventure Tours. What a great day!  20 minutes later I was sitting in the gazebo on the town Green having done 13 miles by 10:45. I wandered a bit up the road to a convenience store and treated myself to a chocolate milk and waited for Iceberg and Quiksilver.Many weeks back I had talked to a husband and wife who were day hiking who had lived in Norwich and told me I really needed to go to the King Arthur Bakery and Deli in town and have a cinnamon roll. I said I would. Iceberg and Quiksilver came with me as it was in the way to Hanover, about .4 miles off the trail. Sadly (for them) I literally got the last cinnamon roll for sale in the place. Kinda weird that they’d run out of a signature item, but they did. Thirty minutes later we were on the bridge crossing the Connecticut River into  Hanover, New Hampshire. First stop there was at Lou’s bakery for our free (to hikers) muffin or scone. We stayed for lunch and had the EBA chicken sandwich a Hanover classic from a now closed restaurant, but now served by Lou’s. This they hadn’t run out of so all three of us had one and it didn’t disappoint. My friend Jason delivered countless EBA sandwiches (restaurant was named Everything But Anchovies) when he was a student at Dartmouth back in the late 80’s and he steered me true in recommending I have one.Continued on the trail through town to the Hanover food co-op to poke around and buy a few things. Parted company with Iceberg and Quiksilver here as they were heading to a hostel and I was being picked up later by my Trail Angel hosts. I headed back into town, as there was a pizza place that gives a free slice to they hikers, which I paired with a libation before going into the Dartmouth campus to my pick up appointment.  We may try to hook up in a few days for the hike over Mt Moosilauke, which is suppose to be a humdinger.I relaxed in an Adirondack chair in front of the Dartmouth library, just across from the Dartmouth Green and enjoyed more of a great afternoon. Patricia and Michael arrived and drove to their home in Canaan, NH about 20 miles away. They have a beautiful home here on roughly 30 acres where I’ll be staying for a few days. Had some great conversation and Shepard’s pie for dinner.  They’ve already showered me with hospitality and showed exceedingly good manners in refraining from comments about my trail odor. Good upbringing always shows. Tomorrow Michael is dropping me off up-trail about 5:30am for an 18 mile hike back into Hanover. My sister, Laura, should be arriving in the afternoon and I’m looking forward to seeing her (weird to actually see that in writing, but there you go).  She’s going to slack pack me for a few additional days into next week before I head into the Presidential Range and the real meat of the Appalachian Trail. This is all absolutely fine!","Thistle Hill Shelter

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639473,"My hosts took me to the trailhead this morning, arriving there at 5:45 for the hike back into Hanover. So it's a slack pack day with my normal pack, a little food, odds and ends and a liter of water and a 28 oz Gatorade, totaling about 9 pounds. I even removed my hip belt pouches as they won’t be needed for a few days. It was in the mid 40’s when I began with a decent climb right out of the box and a climb up Moose mountain in the mid morning. Felt really good again today and fell into a good rhythm while listening to an audiobook.  It’s nice knowing I can recharge at the end if the day and I needn’t worry about killing my phone or my charging brick. Had some really nice views of the New Hampshire hills and the pine forests are always cool to walk through. Started running into NOBO’s after 9 am as they were heading out from the shelter’s and out of town. Captain America and Rapture passed me first and Rapture warned me about a balky boardwalk just ahead - and he wasn’t kidding: it was in bad news of replace my. Sat for a while by a stream with Whispers and talked about the trail ahead and his recent retirement from the Air Force. Also saw Yak and Pneumonia as I was leaving and took some of their trash with me as I was heading back into town anyway. Ran across Theory and Guacamole next, Theory has been dealing with a knee problem and may have to take a few days off to rest it. Got some more trash from Girl Scout and then saw Wrongway, Yap and Oogie Boogie. Last was Quiksilver who was dropped back at the trail around 9:30 in Hanover. Iceberg was slacking 20 miles today back into Hanover. If things work out we'll probably be around Mt Washington in a week at about the same time. I completed today’s miles at 1:45 and decided to walk back into town, returning to Lou’s for a smash burger and a Coffee milkshake. Both were divine. My crazy sister had driven through the night from Michigan, arriving at Patricia and Michael’s about 9:30. So I called and they came back into town to collect me a little after 3.Then began Hiker Christmas!I had ordered some new gear and some replacement gear and had it shipped yo my sister who brought it with her: new hiking shorts, new hiking shirt, new shoes (Hoka Speedgoats), replacement water filter and replacement socks. Then a package arrived from my wife’s Aunt Andrea (Tia from the guestbook).  She sent me some Arnold Palmer ice tea and great trail snacks (and it’s HER birthday, no less!).  Then while we were eating dinner UPS dropped off another package from my friend Mary Jo with more trail food, a gift card and a t-shirt that reads: “It’s fine. I’m fine. Everything is fine” and also a nice card (pic above) with notes from Mary Jo and Stephanie from where I work.What more could a possibly ask for? Great hike. Great lunch. Sister in town. Great Trail Angel hosts. Great Friends. Great Family.My cup doth runneth over.To top it all off, I think I’ve got a good hiking plan together for the next week to cover the miles up to Mt Washington, removing some of the stress from this next stretch of trail. Tomorrow I’ll do another SOBO slack of 18 miles or so back towards the Dartmouth Skiway.Until then, adios!","Dartmouth Skiway

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639557,"Day two of SOBO hiking in New Hampshire, heading back to the point where I had started yesterday morning. My sister took me to the trail and dropped me off just as the rain started at six o’clock.  It rained pretty hard for about 20 minutes and then lightly for 10 and that was it for the day. It was enough to make the rocks and granite slabs slick, which was a good test for my new shoes. It’s too early to make a call on whether these will be “the pair” - new shoes always feel good the first day, but the grip was good, so that’s one box checked. I ran into Rain Catcher and Beats halfway up Mt Cube and gave them each a frozen Gatorade, six of which I packed out to hand to NOBO hikers as some trail magic. I handed out the others throughout the day including one each to Iceberg and Quiksilver. The second big climb of the day was up Smarts Mountain which had a fire tower at the top which I climbed and ate the free cookie and muffin I scored from Lou’s Bakery in Hanover yesterday. Then I had the Payday and an Arnold Palmer that my wife’s aunt sent me yesterday. The views were awesome and I lingered for 20 minutes or so. Coming down the mountain I decided it would be thrilling and exciting to take the wrong trail junction and hike .7 miles downhill, then turned around and hiked back uphill to the turn I missed and then hike back down again. About a 45 minute “oopsie”. Ah well, as the shirt says: this is fine. The last two days I have had a little “stress” in my left knee on long downhills, so I’ll have to watch that and make sure I’m using my trekking poles to ease the descents. Other than that I’m still feeling pretty good. Tomorrow I’m having my sister drive me an hour north so I can hike the 27 miles starting with Franconia Ridge over two days while the weather looks favorable. I’ve had multiple former hikers tell me to try and go over Franconia on a clear day as the views are supposed to be tremendous.  I’ll break up the mileage into two days and spend tomorrow night on the trail before returning here to Patricia and Michael's Monday afternoon. I may need the day off from Patricia’s cooking as I’ve stuffed myself over the last three days with homemade Shepard’s Pie, Chicken Pot Pie and then a full turkey dinner with the sides.  Soooooo, so good. I’m in danger of putting weight back on!My new duds seemed good today as well, switching to a pair of running shorts and a shirt that actually fits. I’ve got my pack loaded and ready for two days and a night back on the trail and will be heading out around 5 am again tomorrow. In case I don’t have cell service tomorrow evening - Happy Father’s Day to all qualifiers!","Grafton Turnpike
",Dartmouth Skiway,"Jun 19, Sat",16.10
Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639643,"Where to begin?  Ok, at the beginning.


Sister Sherpa and I left for the trail, heading about 45 miles north to the Liberty Springs trailhead which connects to the AT near I-93 and the base of Franconia Ridge.  I really appreciate that Laura came all this way from Michigan to support my hike for a week. Other hikers have talked about how incredible the Ridge is and how hiking it on a clear day is the only way to go.  So getting shuttled up here to start the presidential range on a beautiful day was incredible. 


I did have a .7 mile hike from the parking lot up the spur trail to the AT. Then it was climb climb climb 3300 feet in four miles to get above the tree line into the Alpine zone and go to the top of Little Haystack Mountain.  From here you can see Franconia Ridge stretching up to the north, with Mt Lincoln next in line, it’s summit a mile away and shrouded in mist. The views were simply incredible - surrounded on all sides by the Mountains and valleys with mostly sunny skies. 


For much of the next 7 miles I put away my trekking poles and kept my hands free for when I needed to scale the rock faces. I couldn’t imagine hiking this section in bad weather without being prepared to fall a dozen times. 


At the summit of Mt Lafayette (5260 ft) I wan into Slippers and Sweet Corn, who I hadn’t seen in almost a month. They were out doing an 18 mile slack pack. Talked to them for about 10 minutes before we started the downhill, where they quickly outclassed me and disappeared into the trees when we left the Alpine zone.


span class=""Apple-converted-space""> The descent was even more steep and at least a half dozen times I flipped around and climbed down backwards to avoid a potential fall. Halfway down the mountain there was a campsite and I had to decide whether to stop there or continue on to the next site five and a half miles away. 


Well, if you’ve been following this journal you probably know what I did. But between me and the other campsite was the 1500 foot climb up South Twin mountain. It was a hard, hard climb. Rock faces, boulders, roots and all stacked towards the sky. Part way up I pulled off at the Galehead Hut - run by the Appalachian Mountain Club. The huts have a bunkhouse available, but they are still at reduced occupancy due to Covid and all the accommodations have been booked for months. I contended myself by eating a payday candy bar and refilled my water.  I was also able to text with my youngest and return my daughter’s phone call from earlier in the day. 


I created the summit at 4:57, beating my goal by three minutes and then calling my pops to wish him a happy Father’s Day. I am so fortunate to have the father that I do. He instilled in me to treat people as individuals and don’t prejudge anyone based on their race, color, or creed. He’s always shown an interest in other people and can strike up a conversation with just about anyone, always showing an interest in them, not as a means to talk about himself. 


I do so miss my wife, children, family and friends. 


I made it to the side trail to the shelter at 6pm, only to discover that it wasn’t .2 miles from the trail but .7 miles. Ouch. I sighed aloud and made the trek down to the site and managed to find two live trees amongst all the dead pines around here. Answered a lot of questions about thru hiking as a was setting up from a group of retired guys who are out for a four day hike. They were fun to talk to. 


So this was, by far, the toughest 16 mile day I’ve had on the trail and probably the overall toughest day as well. The Whites are just as advertised: steep, rocky, difficult, and breathtaking. I really couldn’t have asked for a better hiking day.","Liberty Trailhead
",Guyot Campsite,"Jun 20, Sun",15.70
Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639660,"Passed a restless night at the Guyot Shelter due to the air mattress of a restless sleeper near me. It sounded like someone crinkling the worlds largest piece of cellophane wrap. I can only hope that I was snoring up a storm and returning the favor. The campsite area probably had about 30 hikers total but as far as I could tell I was the only thru hiker there. It is kinda cool to see how many people are out hiking these difficult trails and enjoying the outdoors. At 5:30 I started the .8 mile slog back to the AT, reaching the trail junction a few minutes before six. I was treated to a great view of a cloud covered Mt Lafayette illuminated by the rising sun. I had a short climb to the top of Mt Guyot (elev 4580 ft) then a rocky downhill presented itself before another climb to the peak of Mt Zeeland, another 4000 footer.  I met a handful of hikers on their way up the mountain, coming from the AMC Zeeland Hut at the bottom of said mountain. It rained for about 20 minutes, making the rocks slick the rest of the day but it was manageable.As I approached the hut I could hear a group of hikers preparing to leave - it was the Trout Family along with Wicked and Forager. It turns out they were just behind me yesterday doing the same hike I did, but they made the wiser decision to stealth camp past the summit of Mt Guyot and forgo the long side trail to the shelter. I talked with Bad Santa (dad) and Ninja feet (oldest child) for a few minutes before they headed out. They were eager to get to the road crossing as they were going to rent a condo with a hot tub and a pool to take a zero day on Tuesday. Forager was doing the same as well. I went into the hut, as Bad Santa said they had leftover coffee for free (they feed the paying guests, thru hikers with good timing can get leftovers if available).  Sure enough: free coffee!  Then a member of the Croo (what the staff call themselves) offered me two peach pancakes that had gone unclaimed. They were cold, no syrup, but they were delicious - made even more so by the kindness of the Croo. I then went outside and took an extended break on the porch and just watched the mountain across the way while listening to the nearby falls. From there I had about 8 mostly downhill miles to the road crossing where Sister Sherpa was collecting me.The big surprise of the day came an hour later when I bumped into a SOBO hiker - it was none other than Section Hiker Special Ed whom I had met my first day on the trail exactly 10 weeks prior.  He was back out from his home in Philadelphia to complete another section of the trail.  I last saw him outside of Waynesboro, Va nine weeks back.  Small world, small trail.  After he completes this section hike he’ll only have 300 miles of the trail left to complete. What an achievement.  We wished each other well and hiked on in opposite directions.My sister was waiting for me down at the road crossing where the climb up to 6000 ft Mt Washington begins (plan to be back here on Friday).  She was loaded for bear with trail magic goodies, but, alas - had just missed the Trout’s getting picked up by their shuttle.  She was able to share some of her goods with a father-daughter section hiker duo before we headed back on the hour and forty five minute drive to Patricia and Michael’s.  Since I did 11.9 miles and finished at noon, I’ll classify today as a “nero”.  My niece was supposed to arrive this evening by plane from Michigan, but storms in Philadelphia canceled her flight. So I’m chanting up plans for tomorrow and will attempt the Mt Moosilauke climb - a very steep and challenging 9.4 miles.  Depending how that goes, I may try to knock out another 12 miles to complete the mileage I’ve left behind doing the slack packing of the last few days. I’m not going to push things, with all the rain in the area I’m prepared for a slick and difficult day.  I’m hoping it’ll be fine.","Guyot Campsite

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639721,"I fretted a bit in my sleep (or not sleep) last night about my plan to hike Mt Moosilauke as it rained through the early morning hours and I’ve read that’s a tough climb in the wet. So I called an audible and had Sister Sherpa take me to the same starting point, but I hiked north instead of south. In the interest of full disclosure, my throat began to get sore and painful Saturday evening and had become progressively more painful each day since. I didn’t sleep well due to that, so I started the day dragging a bit. Still, I was back out at the trailhead at 6:15 and ready to get at it. Today’s hike would take me up and over Mt Wolf and then South Kinsman mountain and North Kinsman mountain. Other hikers have rated the Kinsman’s as some of the toughest climbing on the trail - I was intrigued!The hike today was through pine forests where the trees and rocks were all covered in moss and dripping from the misty clouds. The heavy overcast kept everything very dark and still, and slightly creepy. It was like walking through the story “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow”.  I don’t think the sun peaked out even once today.I stopped to take a break 8 miles in at the Eliza Brook Shelter and found Iceberg and Quiksilver there just finishing a break of their own. They got dropped off the same place I did and I just missed them as I toured the privy at the parking area. I forced myself to eat two peanut butter wraps and drink a liter of water (throat be damned) because the hike up South Kinsman began immediately after the shelter. Both South and North lived up to their billing and proved to be very challenging climbs, requiring me at times to puzzle my way up the rocks and using my hands instead of my trekking poles. The rain set in about the time I went over the south peak and both summits were socked in with clouds. The descent of North Kinsman was the big challenge for me as my interest in falling has not grown over the last few weeks. The rain made every rock and tree root slick, making me think carefully about nearly every step.  Having a nine pound slack pack rig versus my normal 26 pound kit really helped ease the way. But going down took almost as much time as climbing up  I finally complete the 16.5 miles plus a .7 mile walk to the parking lot in just under 10 hours.  Another day in New Hampshire where you earn every mile.  As my sister was coming to collect me she saw Quiksilver and Iceberg by the I-93 overpass eating for their shuttle back to the hotel. So she was able to hand out some trail magic to my hiking companions of the last few weeks.  She had also bought cokes and Gatorade and left them in a cooler back closer to Hanover at a road crossing so she was a Trail Angel extraordinaire today!  Additionally, she convinced me to go to an urgent care clinic on our way back to Patricia and Michael’s. I got right in and was diagnosed with an infection (not strep, thankfully!) and picked up some antibiotics they called in to the grocery store/pharmacy across the parking lot. It looks like I’ll be taking a zero tomorrow and then tackle the last stretch of miles I have to complete between Hanover and the start of the climb to Mt Washington on Friday.   My niece Rachel is arriving late tonight, it'll be nice to see her for a couple of days before she and my Sis vacation in the area.I may even drive a car tomorrow  for the first time in almost two and a half months!","Kinsman Notch

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639754,"I slept in all the way until 5:30 this morning with plans to zero today, as my Driver and niece didn’t get back from the airport until after 2am.   I did borrow my sister’s car and went to town to run a few errands, first time I’ve driven since April 5th.  I was looking to replace my Darn Tough hiking socks that suffered simultaneous blow outs after making it 1000 miles. Now, Darn Tough guarantees their product “for life” and will replace socks at no charge, but I think that 10 weeks of daily wear and 1000 miles is probably the life of a sock. So I just bought a new pair. I also bought a new one liter Smart Water bottle as my current one was starting to get a little gunky around the spout and I’m not really interested in getting some discount penicillin from potential mold build up.  When I returned to the house I decided that rather than doing a zero today and then 19 miles tomorrow it would make more sense to have to half-days instead. Iceberg and Quiksilver had told me the 10 mile section this side of Mt Moosilauke was relatively tame so I felt well enough to tackle it. I did the “Iceberg” and drank about 2 liters of water before I left to stave off any lingering dehydration from the last two days.  Sister Sherpa drive me the 45 minutes to the trail crossing and off I went. I can’t even call what I did today “slack packing” as I didn’t take a pack. Instead I borrowed a fanny pack and put my water filter, bandana, driver’s license (to allow easy identification of my remains, should the need arise) and some throat lozenges. Wearing my blue shirt and the pink Adidas fanny pack made me feel like I was a walking gender reveal party. But hey, I’m hiking the AT, self respect and ego are tertiary concerns. This is fine. The hike was as I was told, fairly gentle miles with about 2000 feet of total climbing over the 9.7 miles. If not for the rocks, I could have been hiking in Saugatuck Dunes State Park near my home with all the oak trees and leaf detritus on the trail. I’m glad my sister had suggested splitting up the hike, as I won’t be on the trail for 10 hours tomorrow and will have time to get repacked as my awesome time here at Patricia and Michael’s winds down.  My niece was with my sister at the pickup and was great to see her and score some Airplane pretzels and biscotti that she had brought along.  Tomorrow I’ll finish the last bit of mileage I have left before heading up to the Mt Washington climb - the 9 miles up and over Mt Moosilauke.  I may go minimalist again (but taking my Garmin emergency device along) and use the fanny pack to have a light weight day.","Glencliff, NH

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639822,"Today *should* be another lesson for me about the uselessness of worrying about six different outcomes when only one thing is going to happen. (Read on if you want to see if I have learned a lesson!)My sister dropped me off at Kinsman Notch which is the northern end of Mt Moosilauke AT trail at 6:15 (she’s been awesome, by the by, it was an hour drive each way for her).  Hiking up from this direction put me next to the Cascades almost immediately. It’s about a mile stray here that goes severely uphill next to a waterfall and is known to be slippery and dangerous if considering are wet. There is sign posted that reads: “This trail is extremely tough. If you lack experience please use another trail. Take special care at the Cascades to avoid tragic results”.  That’ll fill you with confidence!  Thankfully, it had been dry all day Wednesday and I found the climbing had been dreading to be very manageable. It was easy to see from my eyes that coming down that trail in the rain would not be an easy task. As it turned out, I fairly flew up the 3.7 miles to the main summit by 8:30. There was only one other person up there, a New Hampshirite who hikes to the summit every year and she told me she had never been up there without at least a dozen or so people being there as well. The 360 degree views were just more White Mountain magic and the lack of wind was surprising.  I apologized for spoiling her alone time and hiked on.After crossing over the South summit it was down down down for the last 5 miles of the hike. I bumped into True Grit for the second day in a row and he was the first of three thru hikers I saw who asked how the Cascades were today (apparently I’m not the only one with falling on the brain). The descent down the south side of the mountain was very manageable, although I did bark my shin of a protruding rock, leaving a scrape and a bruise for my troubles. I texted my sister that I was going to finish an hour earlier run my noon prediction and then enjoyed a nice morning walk to the road crossing. Today’s hike completed all the miles for me up to the start of the Mt Washington climb. I keep looking at the weather forecast for my planned Saturday summit and it’s now calling for 40- 50 mph winds. I’m trying not to worry about it as the weather up there is so unpredictable it could be snowing or sunny one minute and the opposite the next. This is fine. I spent the afternoon cleaning my pack, doing laundry, and reorganizing my gear. I’m sending some clothing and various and sundries back with my sister in order to further cut weight. I am keeping my long hiking pants through the end of Maine due to the mountains and wild weather. But I think I’ve eliminated another two pounds of weight. That’ll be a little less for the Mt Washington wind to blow around. My sister and niece will be taking me an hour and forty five minutes to the furthest point north I have hiked, then it’s goodbyes and thank you’s.I can’t fully express my gratitude to Patricia and Michael for hosting me for the last week and feeding me as well. They are true Trail Angels and have been perfect hosts to an imperfect and sometimes odiferous hiker.  A fella could get use to taking a shower every day!","Kinsman Notch
",Glencliff NH,"Jun 24, Thu",9.40
Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639872,"I said a regretful goodbye to Patricia and Michael this morning as my time with two awesome Trail Angels came to an end. 

I also said farewell and thank you to my sister and niece when they dropped me at the trail just before 10am. My sister did her best to pamper me all week and let me hike some lower stress miles with little or no pack weight. She also dragged me to the doctor when I probably would have waited another week if I were on my own. 

My plan today was to hike the eight miles up to the Nauman Tentsite which is the last place to hammock before hitting the Alpine Zone, which lasts for 12 miles. I knew that Iceberg and Quiksilver were a day ahead of their schedule and kinda had the same plan. That would set up a 14 mile day Saturday. up and over the 6200 foot summit of Mt Washington. 
Standing at the bottom of Webster Cliffs and looking up was a bit intimidating, but hey, it’s the trail, so you hike it. So, I hiked it. It was a fun challenge and I warmed up quickly. After a week of mostly slack packing I felt like I adjusted pretty quickly to the full pack and the first climb went pretty well. I even passed a few day hikers!  The views all day were just fantastic. The Whites have been just as tough as I had read, but you get rewarded by endless views of the mountains, rushing streams, and sweeping vistas. It’s not New York with steep climbs with nothing to see. 

I got texts from Quiksilver and Iceberg, saying they were able to book bunks at the Lake of the Clouds Hut, which would mean four more miles of hiking, but four fewer miles tomorrow. They kindly got me a bunk as well, which would leave about 1.5 miles and 1300 feet of climb to the summit.  Count me in. So with a new target to reach, I recalibrated and gave myself a target of five o’clock to get up to the hut at 5000 feet.

I did remember to stop and eat and take my antibiotic around two, so points for that. Then it was uphill uphill uphill.  Strangely, there were two spots where the AT went around a mountain peak and the blue blaze trail went over. This is not normal AT behavior. The trail required me to skirt Mt Eisenhower (this was tough, I barely had enough fabric to do the job and the Eisenhower complained that the skirt made his butte look big) and then Mt Monroe on the way to the hut.  

The hut itself can hold 96 people (once Covid restrictions are lifted) and they provide dinner and breakfast to guests. It’s not cheap - $150 for one night in a bunk room, but I felt it was worth it for the experience and it makes me a little less nervous for tomorrow’s hike. 

There are six of us through hikers here tonight and about 30 other hikers.  We thru’s are all planning to be on trail by 6 (skipping the breakfast) as the weather prediction for the morning on top of Mt Washington is 45-60 mph winds - and it’s only going to get worse as the day moves on with gusts to 80 and rain. So we’re hiking as a group and getting it done. The clouds that sat on the summit all day cleared about five and we got to see the weather stations up there, I doubt we’ll see anything in the morning. If all goes well, I’m going to try and hike 15 or so down to a hostel where Iceberg and Quiksilver are staying tomorrow. 

Really looking forward to the challenge tomorrow, I’m putting all my gear inside my pack with nothing dangling on the outside. This will be fine.","Webster Cliffs trailhead 
",Lake of the Clouds Hut,"Jun 25, Fri",11.10
Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639913,"Our entire room of six thru hikers was up by 4:45 and packing for today’s hike. I slept pretty well and did not have any anxiety dreams about the hike ahead - which was welcome. Looking up the hill, Mt Washington was cloud free. This put a little “summit fever” in everyone as Birdman and Beat left just after five for the climb followed shortly by Quiksilver and Yee-ha.  Iceberg and I left the hut just before 5:30 for the mile and a half climb. 


As the hour progressed, the wind speed slowly picked up as we gained altitude towards the top. The trail wasn’t too arduous and I made good time, reaching the windy summit at 6:20. We really got lucky to have views in all directions with a wee bit of sun and overcast skies. I don’t know how windy it was, but it was enough to turn me around a bit when it caught my backpack just right. I stayed at the top for about 15 minutes snapping pics and enjoying the view.  Once I got cold enough (48 degrees with winds a blowin’) it was time to get on with the day’s hike. 


And what a hike it was. The best description I heard was from Iceberg: “it’s like Pennsylvania with views and elevation change”. It was tough trail with loose rocks and gorgeous views. I lost count of how many times I turned an ankle today and my knees are singing a merry tune with the 6800 feet of total descent on the day. 


The climbs I had up the mountains after Washington were actually a relief as it’s soooo much more stable than going down. Mt. Madison was the last up before a 1.5 mile 3000 foot downhill that was the toughest section of trial I’ve done to date. The wind was really blowing as well and would blow my trekking pole sideways just as I would go to place it on a rock. Twice the wind caught my pack and turned me sideways, but thankfully both times I was in an area that had a boulder for me to grab. Getting below tree line wasn’t any better, other than the lack of wind. By the time I reached the bottom of the mountain I was spent, but still had five miles to go to the pick up spot for the hostel in Gorham, NH.We took the shuttle into town to the Barn hostel, though I am actually staying next door at the B&B as the hostel was overbooked. 


On the way down the mountain, my sister texted me that she was in the area so we arranged to meet and have dinner one more time before she and my niece head back to Hanover. So I pigged out at a really good Italian place on my sister’s dime (a bum bumming another dinner!) then she dropped me off for the last time. 


Tomorrow is going to be a zero day to recover a bit from hiking the last 12 days.  I’m moving over to a motel down the street and then on Monday it’s back to the trail as I head into the last 40 miles of New Hampshire. 


I think I’ll do a gear post tomorrow and maybe another fake Q&A. Unless you, dear reader, have a legit question you’d like to pose in the Guest Book that you can find in the drop down link.","Lake of the Clouds Hut

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639946,"I took the picture above back in Canaan last week. The bear in the picture had come up behind me as I was talking with my sister.  It was about 40 feet away when I turned around, then turned and trotted up the driveway and then into the woods. I’ve now spied more bear run deer since I left New Jersey. I survived my night surrounded by the glassy-eyed soulless dolls in the 80 degree attic room at the B&B, so points for that. Decided yesterday that today would be a zero day here in Gorham but the hostel was already booked, so I made a reservation at a local hotel with good reviews and an even better hiker rate.  Paul, the owner/operator of The Barn Hostel let Quiksilver, Iceberg and I stay in the common room of the hostel until 11 which made for a relaxing morning. Paul runs a good hostel and was very accommodating to everyone there. Had lunch at a BBQ place and Wrong Way joined us as she was also taking a zero to heal a balky quad muscle.  After lunch we  checked into our rooms and I vegged most of the afternoon and made a few phone calls.  Then dinner and back to the hotel.  We have a shuttle coming at 7am to go back to the trail for two days as we have some climbs coming in the Wildcats.  My goal over the next 300 miles is to stay healthy, hike smart, and get myself safely to Virginia by the end of July to tackle the last third of my AT hike.I feel good.  I’m enjoying the challenges that happen every day and get constant reminders about what I can control and what I can’t control.  The good news is that this is still fun and I want to enjoy every moment I’m out here .New Jersey hiker Easy asked in the guest book what my thoughts were on the hammock versus tent after the halfway point.  I haven’t had a bad night sleep in the hammock and have been able to find a camping spot in some less than ideal terrain. Three times I’ve set up on a severe slope and around the same number I’ve been able to hang over rocks and roots where a tent could not have gone. So far in the Whites, I’ve been able to hang, but it does require some planning as you can’t hang a hammock where there are no trees. I do have some concerns as I move in to Maine about finding suitable campsites, but so far, so good. Not having a sleeping pad does mean that I’m not equipped to stay in a shelter. So far, that hasn’t been an issue - but it has been a concern in the back of my mind that if I am forced into a shelter I’m going to have an uncomfortable night. It probably took me about three weeks to get really comfortable with the set up the hammock and tarp - I’ve used the tarp every night as I don’t want to deal with damp gear from the dew or dripping sap from trees. I’ve now set up in the rain and taken down in the rain and have been able to keep my dry gear dry.  I also don’t have to deal with packing a wet tent or rain fly. I keep my tarp in the outside pocket of my pack, so even if that’s wet it doesn’t contact my other gear.  I do miss the tiny home with walls that you get with a tent. I don’t have the space to spread out my gear or do a repack in the rain with some protection. But I’ve had no regrets about choosing the hang versus sleep on the ground. It’s also given me a lot of flexibility when it comes to stealth camping when needed. One hiker’s opinions, but I do love my hammock!","Gorham

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639994,"After a relaxing zero day (not as as relaxing as it could’ve been because I got caught up watching “Hoosiers” and didn’t go to sleep until 11pm) I was up at 5 to shave my head and get packed for hiking. I had time before the shuttle arrived at seven to slide up the road to McDonald’s for a coffee and hashbrowns. I had a chance Sunday afternoon to call and talk with my parents to make sure they hadn’t floated away from all the rain in dear old Michigan. We arrived in Pinkham’s Notch at 7:15 for the two-day hike to the next hostel. The hike on the AT is about 21 miles, so we decided to split it up into two days and then do a resupply before heading into Maine. I had contemplated found all 21 in one go and then taking another zero, but this is more cost effective as I’ll have a nero of 8 miles tomorrow with only one night at the Rattle River Hostel. So after a one mile pond walk the trail turned north and up up up we went. The first stretch went up 2500 feet in about 4 miles with some very steep sections in the first two. Quiksilver soon disappeared up the mountain as I slogged along. I do have “trail legs” in the sense that I can continuously climb, but I still don’t do so very fast. After crossing the last Wildcat peak it was a steep 1200 feet down in just under a mile to the Carter Notch Hut where we took a break. This is the northernmost hut the AMC operates along the AT. Iceberg and Quiksilver got some lunch (potato soup and bread) while I just sat, drinking water and yawning like it paid money. Then it was a steep 1500 feet back up in 1.2 miles to the top of Carter Dome. The afternoon brought a few sprinkles until about 2:30 pm when a heavy rain shower hit just after I crested North Carter Mountain and started down the rocks and granite slabs on the north face of the mountain. I had some Bear Mountain, CT flashbacks as I started down (the knot on my right shin is still present a month later), but I was determined to take care and really think about where I was placing my hands and feet. Three times I chucked my trekking poles down a rock face, turned around, and went down backwards facing the incline. This strategy seemed to work better than my old one just falling. I may employ it in the future as well!I got to the campsite at 3:30 in one sweaty (it was 88 degrees), rain soaked piece. Quiksilver and I had no trouble finding hammock spots and Iceberg and Yeeha are at the tenting platforms. It rained for about 15 minutes just after I got set up and there are still showers in the area, but Tuesday should be rain free. I ate my cold dinner of peanut butter wraps and a protein meal bar before filtering water and sacking out in Ye Olde Hammocke. I am starting to think about the logistics involved in dragging my carcass back down to Virginia once I complete the Maine section. I’m not getting too far ahead of myself, as a flip flopper with 731.8 southbound miles yet to do I don’t have a case of “Katadin Fever” like the NOBO’s who’ve been hiking since Georgia are susceptible to contracting. I’m going to enjoy my time in Maine as it is widely regarded as perhaps the most beautiful state on the AT. I have plans A-B-C and D currently, but plan A of renting a car may be out as one-way rentals are hard to come by. I’m confident it’ll sort itself out even if I end up on a two day Greyhound bus trip. This is fine. I’ll be up by 4:45 tomorrow and packing up camp for the climb up the last mountain I’ll be climbing in The Whites. Have a great evening/morning/day!","Pinkham Notch
",Imp Shelter and campsite,"Jun 28, Mon",13
Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640036,"Twas’ a hot night at the Imp campsite, I don’t think the temperature dropped below 72 degrees. I slept barefoot and wore my retired hiking shorts and a T-shirt and did use my hammock under quilt.  I drank a liter of water upon waking, as I don’t think I drank enough yesterday through the heat and humidity. I’ve been really good at carrying water but a tad remiss at drinking it. I was packed and on trail at 5:45 for the last mountain we had in the Whites: Mt Moriah. It was a dainty climb of just under a thousand feet and the views looking back south were just stupid good.  I think I crossed five exposed ledges on the way to the peak and stopped each time to goggle.  Dorothy, we’re not in Michigan anymore. Then it was some steep downs for the next 4 miles until the trail leveled out into what I used to think “trail” meant: woodsy, with soft leaves and a gentle slope. Yeeha was right behind me the whole way even though he’s battling a shin injury that may force him off-trail. He’s taking a zero on Wednesday to ice and recuperate and then assess how he feels. I’m just gutted for him to be this close and then have an injury. It’s a reminder to me that at anytime I may take a step and have something go “pop” and my hike could be over. I’m trying to enjoy everyday I am blessed to be out here.  I finished the 8 miles in just under 4 hours and arrived at the Rattle River hostel which sits right next to the trail.Here, they great you with a complimentary popsicle so you can unwind, then they have you grab loaner clothes and take a shower next to their pack room.  Shoes have to stay outside and packs and gear cannot go into the house-proper.  All your laundry goes into a mesh bag and then they wash and dry for you. I’m sure these rules may seem overly stringent to some, but the payoff is that the common areas are clean and the bunk rooms don’t reek of wet socks and sweat-soaked packs.  Sev approves.  Four of us took the 11:30 shuttle to Walmart to resupply for the next 3-5 days of hiking.  I was wearing  a slightly torn pair of basketball shorts, a t-shirt two sizes to big for me and unlaced, beat up hiking shoes. I felt like I was one with Clan Walmart.  I picked up my peanut butter and Fritos as I had all the other food I would need already and then grabbed some lunch.  In a mild upset, I chose a pre-made Caesar salad, chicken salad and cantaloupe.  I don’t even know who I am anymore.Back to the hostel to while away the very hot day and put together some plans for the next stretch.  Sitting 22 miles away in Mahoosuc notch - a mile long boulder scramble that takes anywhere from an hour and a half to three hours to navigate.  So we’re trying to time our arrival so we can tackle it in the earlier part of the day.  Immediately after comes the Mahoosuc Arm climb which is among the steepest on the trail going up 1500 feet in less than a mile.  Complicating matters are the thunderstorms forecast for tomorrow and rain on Friday.  So I may hike 11 miles or 15 miles, just depending on what the trail brings.My plan is to hike, and deal with whatever needs to be dealt with.","Imp Shelter and campsite
",Rattle River Hostel,"Jun 29, Tue",8.30
Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640107,"Following a hot night in the hostel, I was out of bed at 5:30 and downstairs to have pancakes with the breakfast eaters (one must take care not to be ostracized from the group by showing anti-breakfast proclivities). Quiksilver had posted up in the kitchen and was making pancakes for one and all. I was drinking water prodigiously to try and pre-hydrate for another hot and muggy hiking day. I had an interesting conversation with the hostel owner the afternoon before as we talked about magnetic pole reversal, local water ordinances, mega-volcanoes, how to split and replant Hostas, doomsday tidal waves, Gatorade vs Powerade, and other odds and ends.  Being widely read sometimes pays off. I can talk with just about anyone about nearly anything. This is fine. Yeeha was taking another zero today to see if he can continue his hike as he battles a shin injury. So I headed out first at 6:45 with Iceberg just behind and Quiksilver a ways back. After a one mile road walk I entered the woods and started up, completely sweating through my clothes in about 45 minutes.The elevation profile for the day promised lots of climbing (I think the mist in one day so far in the trail for me) and we had decided to make the Gentian Pond Shelter our rally point about 11 miles up trail. There were 22 miles or so to Mahoosuc Notch and Mahoosuc Arm (a iconic one mile boulder scramble followed by one of the steepest climbs in the AT) and a few ways to split up the distance. Doing the Notch in the rain would be far from ideal, but with three days of rain forecast, we mayn’t have much choice. The other issue today was going to be water, it’s been very dry here and the streams and creeks are drying out. The first decent water source looked to be 8 miles away, but when I got there there were only stagnant pools, no flowing water. I arrived at the rally point at 12:45 to find that water source all but dry as well. The 11 miles had been fairly tough and it rained just as I arrived. Iceberg roller in a little after one and after some consultation we decided to go for the next shelter 5.8 miles away. Had the shelter had good water, we probably would have stayed. We messaged Quiksilver and started uphill, with the promise of a reliable stream about two miles away. After two more steep uphills we got to the steam that had been flowing a week ago to find one stagnant pool and nothing more.  Out of options, I scooped out what I could and treated it with iodine tablets before filtering it as well. Then I checked the weather: 30% chance of afternoon rain but no thunderstorms.  That left one big 1400 foot climb up Mt Success.  Well, don’t be too shocked, but the weather forecast was bunk. I was witching a half mile of the summit when it began to rain and thunder. The closer I got to the top, the more the thunder picked up. I had a cell signal and it showed a thunderstorm about 3 miles south along another ridge. I was standing in a group of pines hardly taller than me so I wasn’t well protected. Time to throw caution to the wind!  I crossed a few exposed granite outcroppings and then saw the summit 100 yards away. I had gone this far, so I then crouched slightly and ran across the rock and bog boards, went up and over the top abs then back into the trees on the other side. Phew!New Hampshire wasn’t done with me yet, though. The next three miles were rooty, rocky, slippery and challenging. Thrice more I had to throw my trekking poles down an incline and then go hand over hand (hand under hand?) down the rocks. I added two good scrapes and another shin bruise along the way to the New Hampshire/Maine border about half a mile from the campsite.  Then Maine said “HELLO!” with three rock scrambles of its own in the last .1 miles to the shelter. I am now hammocked-up, having had my standard dinner of a meal bar, peanut butter wrap, and Landjaeger sausage. Tomorrow we plan to be on trail at six so we can reach the Notch late morning before the rain sets in. There are a few SOBOs here as well, and we shared info about the trail north and south of here. Hopefully we’ll find some good water and dry trail. Iceberg and I plan to go to Bethel, Maine Friday night for a resupply but Quiksilver may stay on trail as he’s already packing about 11 pounds of food. I’m exited to be in Maine, though I know it’ll be a stout challenge. My new shoes are looking very beat up from all the rocks over the last 140 miles, but my feet are as good as they’ve been since Virginia. So good news there!As an added note, cell service is very spotty in Maine, so there may be a day or two delay in posts. I will still be writing every night and then posting when I can.","Rattle River Hostel
",Carlo Col Shelter,"Jun 30, Wed",16.80
Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640142,"After a good nights sleep I got on trail at 6:15 with Iceberg and Quiksilver with the plan to hike fairly close until reaching Full Goose Shelter 4.5 miles away. There we would take a break before entering Mahoosuc Notch 1.6 miles ahead. 


The weather was very overcast and after the first climb of the day we remained in the clouds for the next three hours. Passing over multiple summits buffeted by a strong wind forced me to hike with one hand one my head to keep my hat from Mary Poppinsing away into the ether. Then I would go down below the tree line and relax into normal hard hiking. It took me three and a half hours to hike just under 5 miles to the shelter. The good news was there was actually flowing water .1 miles downhill so I drank up and packed out two liters for the next stage. 


900 feet of descent later, we were at the west end of Mahoosuc Notch, often described as the most often described mile of the AT.  How to convey what the trail was like…it was like walking through an auto salvage yard, only with the cars stacked in every possible configuration with occasional gaps of 5 feet between them and 10-20 foot drop in the gap. The Notch is at the base of opposing steep cliffs (and it was hard to get the notion out of my head that all these boulders had started up above and fallen down here - would one join them now?) and has its own microclimate to the extent that there was still ice in some of the low spots.  


The Notch-proper is just under a mile in length and takes most hikers somewhere between an hour and a half and three hours to traverse.  Hiking poles stowed away, we entered at 10:30.  I for one, had a blast jumping, climbing, crawling, controlled-falling, and shimmying through the morass of rocks. Twice I had to take my pack off to squeeze through a rock tunnel and I only made one dumb decision to jump three feet down onto a rock and still lived to tell the tale. The three of us took turns picking a path and emerged 90 minutes later from the east end of the Notch with a few scrapes and bruises for our troubles.  There are plenty of places on the trail that require boulder scrambling, but nothing like this where it’s all you do for most of a mile. 


After taking a break, we then had the Mahoosuc Arm climb, which as I mentioned yesterday is one of the steepest on the AT.  But it really wasn’t bad - sorta just another long plod-plod-plod sixty minute slog up a mountain. Halfway up we ran into Rain Catcher and Vikingman. I was really pleased to see Vikingman in particular as I had last seen him just before entering New Jersey. I knew that his Trail family had split up at about mile 1600 as some started to do bigger miles and others had off-trail obligations, but all are still hiking.  I’m excited for Vikingman that he’s still hiking and is so close to his goal of completing the AT. 


After all the tough hiking over the last two days I managed to emerge injury free until we were walking along the edge of Speck Pond and I absentmindedly slammed my left knee into a rock that had waited 300 million years for me to come along and do something asinine like not look down. I’ve got a nice cut and another knot to show for my self-inflicted troubles. 



This is fine.
So we are at the Speck Pond shelter for the night and I am beat. Maine is a butt-kicker and will remain so for another 80 miles. It’s supposed to start raining this evening and not stop for 36 hours with temps plunging into the 40’s. Iceberg had already arranged for a hotel room in Bethel, Maine for tomorrow and Quiksilver and I are going to bunk with him to get out of the weather and resupply. We’ve got Old Speck Mountain to climb first thing and then a steep three mile downhill to the road. With the rain that’s predicted, it’s going to be slow going over the harsh terrain before we meet our shuttle at 10am. My goal is not to fall.","Carlo Col Shelter

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640225,"The rain started this morning at 12:13 as the pitter-patter of the rain hitting my tarp woke me. I made a calculated decision and got up to answer the call of nature, knowing that the rain was suppose to intensify by dawn and might have made pack up more…complicated. Around 3 am I heard some four legged critter snuffling around on the tenting platform next to me, it didn’t sound very big so I ignored it. Rainy pack up went well as I kept everything dry that needed to stay dry. I was down at the shelter at 5:30 and finally just before 6, Iceberg, Quiksilver and I looked around, shrugged and hiked off into the steady rain. We had a steep climb up Old Speck mountain and had to traverse some granite slabs that were a tad treacherous but we got to the top unscathed by 7. Iceberg contacted our shuttle to let them know we’d be a little earlier than our 10 am pickup. The 2800 foot hike down was nowhere near as bad as I had anticipated and we were at the parking lot at 9 am. The hotel owner Mark picked us up at 9:30 and he could not have been more accommodating. He stopped on the way to the hotel and let us pick up some food from a deli then dropped us at our door. So hot showers were taken (separately) and some gear explosions occurred. Mark then took us back into town to an outfitters where I was able to pick up some shoe repair silicone as the rocks have been demoing the ties of my trail runners. I also lucked out in that their Probars were sold out, but ups had just dropped off a shipment and I was able to stock up. I finished my resupply at the grocery store and bought dinner as well (clam chowder, cheese, and pineapple). There may have been beer purchased as well. May have. Back at the hotel in the lounge we discussed how to tackle the next section of trail, given that the cold and rain is supposed to continue through Sunday.  Iceberg was able to set up two days of slack packing the next 35 miles, using The Cabin hostel as a base. The Cabin also offers dinner and breakfast for a low price which means we should be able to hike the next 5 days without a resupply.  The I’ll have a resupply box from home. The goal is to be in Monson by the 13th or 14th to set up the last leg through the 100 mile wilderness and the climb up Katahdin. We’re heading out at 6am with rain starting around noon. It’ll be a tough 20 miles, but with lighter packs it should easier to do. I did forget to mention yesterday that we had a fourth hiker with us through Mahoosuc Notch. When we were done, I took off my hat and found a large spider stuck inside the brim. It had likely crawled in when I had taken my hat off at  Full Goose shelter. I’m sure he’s bragging to all his friends today.","Speck Pond Shelter

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640281,"Iceberg, Quiksilver and I were up before five and getting out light packs ready. I went down to the common area for some coffee and remembered I had a pint of clam chowder in the fridge still from yesterday. I decided to roll the gastrointestinal dice have a second dinner, rather than waste food. Hiking on a full stomach of clam soup - what could go wrong?Mark, the hotel owner, took us on the half hour drive back to Grafton Notch at six am. Not only that, but he took our gear to Andover and dropped it off at The Cabin Hostel for us, saving us $40.  He could not have been more helpful during our stay - a true Trail Angel. So as slack packers, we were committed to a 20 mile day, no tents or hammocks or extra gear to survive in the cold, rainy woods. First on the menu was a 2300 foot climb up Baldplate West and East Peaks. Once we got above 3000 feet we were hiking in the clouds with light rain and a steady wind. The final ascent up the East Peak was on exposed rock slabs and it was simply exhilarating in the weather. I even broke out my rain kilt as my big concern for the day was avoiding hypothermia, so staying as dry as possible was on my mind. We got the first 5 miles done in just over three hours, but we were back below the tree line and the rain has stopped.  I kept my rain gear on to stay warm on the long descent off the mountain and did my level best to stay vertical.  I did forget to mention that I had one slip yesterday where my feet slid out from under me and I slowly went to ground like a ship slipping below the waves. Not quite a fall, but certainly not staying on my feet. Then came a long 1700 foot uphill to Wyman mountain. But this was unlike any ascent I’ve seen since the mid Atlantic states - it was gradual, mostly rock free, and we were able to average over two miles per hour. This was a welcome development on a big mile day with over 7300 feet of elevation gain and lots of downhill too. We had to make time somewhere in order to get to the hostel before evening. The last climb of the day was a very steep up and over Mt Moody.  When I got to the summit I broke out the first trail beer of my hike. I had packed it out from the hotel that morning figuring I might as well make some use of the 50 degree temps and keeping beer cold seemed a good use. Iceberg called for our shuttle pickup and then down we went to the road. The Cabin Hostel is described as a “trail icon” which translates loosely as “sardine bunk rooms, one toilet, and strong odors”. On the plus side, it’s owned by Miss Honey who is 89, loves hikers, and is hiking the 100 mile wilderness herself later this summer.  Also on the plus side she is assisted by two former thru hikers who run shuttles and assist with cooking. Finally on the plus side, they served a $10. dinner of bbq chicken, salad, potatoes, corn on the cob, iced tea, brownies, and ice cream. Miss Honey and her crew kept bringing food until everyone had waved off. Truly nice people. I took a shower after dinner (shower shoes firmly on) and put on some loaner clothes - including the first pair of cutoffs I’ve worn in 45 years.  I knew I’d have new experiences on this hike, wearing Daisy Dukes wasn’t on my list of probables. Tomorrow is again supposed to be cold and rainy, so we’re doing a 13 mile slack pack southbound back to the hostel. This is fine. I Swear.","Grafton Notch

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640337,"After a surprisingly decent seven hours of sleep (does funky wet shoe smell contain some anesthetic properties?)  and a nice breakfast repast, we were shuttled to the Heights of the Land (picture above, before the fog rolled in five minutes later) and began the SOBO hike back towards Andover at 8:30.  After yesterday’s 20 miles I thought I’d be a little more dead-legged to start the day but actually felt kind of spry. The fifth day in Maine was a copy of the previous four, with cool temps and overcast skies. The forest was wet through and dripping, so I went ahead and donned my rain kilt for the third straight day in order to keep my hiking shorts somewhat dry. Just 20 minutes in we came to a road crossing just as Gregg, a local Trail Angel, was setting out some trail magic. He had cookies, drinks and granola bars that they put out everyday at 9, 12, and 3. He also told us that there is a local group that does a weekly “banquet”, cooking food for the hikers. All they ask in return is that hikers sign their register. How awesome is that?  After chatting with him for 10 minutes we started our climb 2000 feet up Bemis mountain. Once again, as soon as we went above 2000 feet we were back walking in the clouds for the next 6 hours which has been the modus operandi for us in Maine. Every mountain we’ve crossed has been socked in with varying degrees of rain and wind. But, it’s not something that I can control so I just try to roll with it and then enjoy the day for what it is, not what it isn’t. It can be so still and peaceful with the trees dripping softly and the ground underfoot muffled by the damp.  The only things to watch out for were roots, rocks, and moose droppings. Just after noon I crossed paths with Grumpy Cat, who had been off trail for 8 days last month to celebrate his retirement from the US Army Rangers.  He was knocking off some sections up here in Maine during the poor weather, then will go back to New Hampshire to hike when it gets warmer. He’s probably about four days back but it wouldn’t shock me if he passes by me before the end of Maine. It was good catching up with him.I caught up to one SOBO hiker on a steep downhill section about half a mile from our pick-up point at South Arm Road. He was really struggling in the wet rocks and fell twice, cursing as he did so. But he got up both times, which is the important part. He was trying to go as fast as he could to meet his 3:30 shuttle and got to the road just in time. On the way back to the hostel we made a side trip to the convenience store in Andover where we had a random celebrity citing as Tucker Carlson was at the register as we walked in. Do with that what you wish. Back at the hostel I did the standard clean up and laundry and then did some planning for the next few days. Dinner was Shepherds Pie and then brownies and ice cream for desert. Miss Honey joined us and told us some trail stories and some history of the hostel. We also celebrated the birthday of one of her neighbors who thru hiked back in 1977. So I’m starting to zero in on a possible finish date in Maine around the 22nd or 23rd of July. It looks like when I do finish NOBO (the Good Lord wiling) I’ll try and take Amtrak back down to Roanoke, Va to continue my flip-flop. Hope everyone had a great 4th of July!","Height of the Lands
",South Arm Road,"Jul 04, Sun",13.30
Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640450,"Night two at the cabin was a little more chill as there were half the hikers as the day before. Iceberg sweet talked Miss Honey’s son Don into getting us a 45 minute shuttle back to the trail at 6:30 instead of 8:30. Don was ready and off we went on schedule to Maine route 17 “Height of the Lands”.


On the drive there we were shocked to see hilltops and mountain tops as previously all we had seen of Maine were clouds.  The forecast for the day was mostly sunny and 68 degrees. Perfect hiking weather. Naturally the section we planned to hike had mountains to cross so our views and vistas would be limited. Still, it was a great improvement over 50 and rain. 


We got on trail at 7:25 with a planned rendezvous about 13 miles away in case we hiked separately through the day. As of turned out, the trail was fairly tame and we never got more than 10 minutes separation all day. We came across a pond 8 miles in and Quiksilver took one of the canoes out for a spin. Several of the ponds in Maine have canoes for anyone who wants to use them. I choose to sit and eat some lunch and then talked to two local fisherman who came out to try and land some Brook trout. Speaking with lifelong Maine residents is interesting as their accents are so pronounced.  They also told me they scour the woods for Moose Antlers, using the droppings to track the animal’s paths. 


After the break at the pond we decide to hike to the next road crossing and take a short road walk to The Hiker Hut outside of Rangely, Maine, a well known off-grid hostel.  We were in search of a cold drink and found what we were looking for with free sodas and $1.50 Gatorades. Iceberg and I opted for the $3 fried egg sandwich on offer as well while Quiksilver continued his quest to eat-down his 10 pound food bag. 


Just as we were finishing and packing up to leave, a Trail Angel calling herself “Pineapple” pulled up in her car and offered us trail magic (she had spent most of the day back where we started serving hikers). Although we had just eaten, we didn’t want to disappoint her (there may have been other motivations) so we helped her unpack her car and she made us sandwiches, gave us chips and cucumbers and cookies as well.  She said she had lived in Maine for a few years and had a hard time finding a sense of community, so she decided this year to become a Trail Angel. She had already driven down to New York earlier this spring and did magic for a week before returning to Maine to continue to feed hikers. She was very emotional about how the hiking community had embraced her and helped her feel connected. 


Stuffed, we helped her pack her car back up and then began the last five miles of the day uphill about 1000 feet to Eddy pond where we had read that there were camping sites next to the water. We got to the pond about 4:30 and got set up for the evening and chatted a bit about the next few days. Rain and thunderstorms are in the forecast for Tuesday and we have to traverse about 4 miles of exposed alpine areas first thing in the morning. Hopefully everything holds off until the afternoon 


After dinner Quiksilver and I took a canoe out for a paddle on Eddy Pond and on the far side we came across a beaver lodge and one very agitated beaver who let us know by smacking his tail on the water that we were not welcome in his world. Naturally, this meant we went back to our camp so Iceberg and I could switch places so he could go and agitate the critter. 


My knees are telling me that the hiking over the last fortnight has been rough.  My many encounters with rocks and scrub brush have left my shins looking like a feral cat had a go at me and then ran a cheese grater over them for good measure. The next 45 miles are going to have more to add to that ledger before the trail in Maine will flatten out a bit. Tomorrow I’ll be climbing over two 4000 footers, a 3600 footer, and two 3000 footers. 


Today though was a gorgeously pleasant day in Maine. The sun was out, the trail was dry, the humidity non-existent, and the people awesome. Another great day to be on trail and I’m grateful for every single one.","Height of the Lands

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640452,"Spent a restful night on the shore of Eddy pond listening to the frog chorus through the wee hours. Started packing up camp at quarter to five and was on trail 45 minutes later. Iceberg and I both rolled out early to get climbing up the Saddlebacks before the weather came in. The ascent was pretty tame and afforded cool views of Eddy Pond and the surrounding mountains. When I t Saddleback the clouds hadn’t arrived and I had great views of the mountains to the north (pic above) and also to the next peak - The Horn. I had to descend about 600 feet to the saddle between the two peaks but the alpine bog was mostly dried up meaning no wet feet! It was a mile and a half from the peak of Saddleback to the peak of The Horn but by the time I got halfway up The Horn the summit was awash in a cloud bank and the wind was howling. Looking back, Saddleback was the same. The climb down the north face of The Horn was very rocky and technical in spots. Twice I chucked my trekking poles downhill to free up my hands to figure out a way down.  But I was below the exposed alpine region so I wasn’t too worried about any stray thunderstorms. We walked though a lot of SOBOs today as we are in their bubble. It’s mostly the low milers and late starters we’re seeing, but there are a lot of them. We saw six SOBOs taking a zero day at a lean to (they call shelters “lean to’s” in Maine) because they didn’t want to cross the saddlebacks in the rain. Weather forecasting being what it is, it never did rain today, just cloudy and damp. I did pass one shirtless SOBO hiking with his dog. I must say, the dog looked slightly embarrassed. I got to the campsite about 2:15, having done just shy of 15 miles. Decided to end the day here and not put more stress on my joints. I’ve got an 800 foot up to start the day and then a 2100 ft climb midday before the descent into Stratton, Maine. It looks like Thursday is going to be another rainy day so I may take a “zero” at The Hostel of Maine.  Then there is one more mountain day over the Bigelows before the trail gets a little more tame as Monson approaches.","Eddy Pond

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640501,"The 10% chance of overnight rain turned into 100% about 10:30pm as the rain hitting my tarp spurred me out of my hammock to put my not-dry shirt and shorts under the tarp as well. The wind also really picked up and even though I was strapped to two big trees, the buffeting of the wind among the tree tops caused my hammock to sway and shake all though the night. But all in all, I still slept well. I was on trail at 5:35 and heading up Spaulding Mountain to warm up for the day and then tackle the bigger climb to South and North Crocker. For the first time in about a week, I did start the day with two ibuprofen to help my knees a bit. I’ve really tried to resist taking too many anti-inflammatories and just feel what I feel. But the downhill pounding is adding up. I stopped for a break about 6 miles in and had my obligatory peanut butter tortilla wraps and then started up to the top of the 4050 foot South peak and then the 4228 to the North peak. I was really making good time while still remembering to enjoy the views when available and take pictures as well. The Hostel of Maine had a scheduled pickup at the rod crossing at 1 pm that I thought was out of reach, but when I checked at noon I only had just over a mile to go. I figure the prospect of a town day put a little giddy-up in my plod today. I arrived at the parking lot at 12:30 and was able to pull out a few pieces of gear to dry out from last nights rain. The shuttle was on time and I was at the Hostel 10 minutes later. Iceberg, Quiksilver and I are sharing a room and had planned to zero on Thursday, then slack pack the Bigelow mountains on Friday. The changing forecast may alter those plans as heavy rain and thunderstorms are on the docket for Friday. It’s looking as if we’ll hike the 16.6 miles tomorrow instead and have, hopefully, at least a morning free of rain. I talked to a few SOBOs here at the hostel and shared info about the trail south of here. They all agreed that after the Bigelows, the trail for we NOBOs will smooth out.  The Hostel of Maine has some thru hiker rules that I’m totally behind:  no smelly shoes, packs, or gear in the hostel. Showers taken on arrival. Clean up after yourself, and just in general be a normal human being and not a one person wrecking crew. Not hard. I did make a short trip to a convenience store and scored both chocolate milk AND Arnold Palmer ice tea. I also received a resupply box here with trail food for the next four hiking days along with another battery bank for my electronics for the upcoming 100 mile wilderness. All in all, another great day both on and off the trail.","Spaulding Mountain lean to
",Maine Rte 27,"Jul 07, Wed",13.50
Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640567,"Had a good, cold night’s sleep (windows open!) and then twiddled my thumbs waiting for our shuttle to take us an hour north to slack SOBO back towards the hostel. Limey and Grizz - a British expat couple went with us to do the 16.6 miles through the last big mountains of Maine - the Bigelows. There were two 4000 footers on the docket and some alpine zones to traverse with rain and possible thunderstorms in the afternoon. 
On the way to the trail, I kept on seeing the mountains looming up before us, and I gotta tell you, I become progressively more fired up looking at them. The challenge of hiking. 2800 feet of climbing from the road to the first 4000 footer and then once on trail I kept catching glimpses of the vertical rock faces approaching, getting more fired up. Why? Dunno, but it did get my blood pumping for sure. 
The other two things pushing me forward today were the possible weather over exposed areas and the added anxiousness that slack packing brings on for me due to the fact that I don’t have any options to pull off trail and set up camp. Being pot-committed to getting to a road crossing does tend to focus one’s mind. 
I was behind Quiksilver most of the day and occasionally he’d come in sight, then either Quiksilver mode would activate and he’d pull away, or Sev mode would activate and I’d plod and fall behind. The trail, while challenging with elevation, had a decent tread underfoot and not many rock scrambles to navigate. There were a few sections that were tricky, but nothing quite like the first part of Maine threw at us. 
Quiksilver and I ran into a troop of 11-12 year old boys who were out with a chaperone from a local summer camp and who were hiking up from the other direction. They were having a snack and still had a bit of a climb to do yet before they would hit a side trail and head down to a waiting ride. I listened to the lads cracking on each other and my heart was warmed when one boy said of his sandwich “it’s sticky and wet” and one of the others immediately threw out “that’s what she said”. The future of America is secure. 
Quiksilver and I hiked the last 6 miles in proximity to one another and realized that we could make the 4:30 shuttle at the trail if we stayed on pace. Even if I had wanted to slow, the mosquitoes and deer flies near the swampy areas spurred me to keep moving. We got to the road at 4:00pm, doing the 16.6 miles in just over seven hours. 
We’re taking a group zero tomorrow and the biggest decision on the docket is whether we shuttle to the next town over to hang out at a tap room. 
I’m finalizing plans for the end of Maine and hopefully will have that locked down tomorrow.
The only downer today was worrying a bit about Limey and Grizz and whether they would finish before dark. Good news is they did and they arrived back at the hostel a little after 8pm. 
I think I’m going to buy them a drink tomorrow. They earned it.","East Flagstaff Road

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640629,"So what to talk about on a zero day?  Slept in until 5:15am. Drank an absurd amount of coffee this morning. Glued my shoes and crossed my fingers that they can last another 140 miles (starting to doubt this). Went to the convenience store for some Arnold Palmer iced teas and Vermont white cheddar cheese. Made sure I have food to hike the next four days. Confirmed reservations at the last town before the 100 mile wilderness. Shaved my dome (well, somewhat carved with a dullish razor - ouch).  Read some more from Griersen’s Raid - a book about a Calvary raid during the Civil War. Charged every electronic item I’m carrying. And generally killed some time. I’m currently relaxing in a comfy arm chair with the aroma of baking banana bread from the hostel kitchen wafting through the joint (it smells like a grandmother’s hug) while contemplating which flavor of ice cream I’ll be decimating later this evening. I did talk with my friend Jason (trail name never to be activated: Wedge) who is going waaaaaay above and beyond and driving to Bangor, Maine in two weeks from his home in Pennsylvania to gather my sorry self and get me back to Virginia a few days later. I have some good - no, great friends.

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640714,"Third and last night at the Hostel of Maine brought some sad news: Travelin Beat took a seemingly innocuous fall yesterday afternoon while slack packing through the Bigelows.  He was on a mild downhill and just stepped on a wet tree root and down he went, instinctively trying to arrest his fall by putting his hand down and immediately knew something was wrong. A very kind woman who was working remotely from the Hostel took him 45 minutes to the hospital and he was diagnosed with a break near the base of the ring finger on his left hand. He will have to wait until Monday to see a specialist to see if he needs surgery. 170 miles from the end of a 2193 mile hike and that happens. All we could do was commiserate (he stayed more upbeat than I did) and hope he gets good news from the Doctor that’ll allow him to get back on trail and finish soon. It just sucks for him.Iceberg, Quiksilver and I were joined by Birdman, Ally and Trebek for the hour ride back to the far side of the Bigelows to resume hiking. We were given a free ride in a 1988 Chevy hightop camper van by Trail Angel and local police chief “Batman”.  Batman frequently gives free lifts to hikers and will also hand out beer and Gatorade trail magic while doing so. Yet another friendly Mainer who gives freely to hikers. I neglected to mention that a few days back while hiking the Bigelows I stopped at one peak and talked with a husband and wife who were out hiking with their dog. Husband and I had the same make and model of shoes, so we were immediately sole brothers. They mentioned they were heading to the same place I was and that they could give me a ride if needed. They arrived at the parking lot five minutes before the Hostel shuttle just as the rain started and they gave Quiksilver and I a ride back to the hostel. Turns out they are on a “gap year” of sorts from where they live in Hong Kong (he’s a British expatriate, she an American and they’ve lived there for 30 years) and came to the northeast to see her son who is a professional rugby player in Boston. In between his matches they drive into the rural areas to hike. And we met them in northeast Maine and hitched a ride. What a weird, wonderful world. Today’s hike started at 9 at the trailhead and only had moderate elevation gain the whole day - something like 2800 feet total. The sun was out and temps hit the low 70’s during the day. With four days to cover the 57 miles to Monson I was in no particular hurry. There were no mountain vistas to be had but the trail wound around a series of ponds (they’re lakes, by cracky, LAKES) that were quite beautiful.  Being from Michigan, it’s odd to see these large bodies of water with only a handful of camps (they’re cottages, by cracky, COTTAGES) and no power boats zipping around on a July Saturday. I arrived at the lean-to (they’re shelters, by cracky…oh, never mind) at 3:30 just as a half dozen southbounders arrived from the other direction. Among their number were a British couple who are here via Mexico on a 90 day tourist visa to hike as many miles as they can. With all the Covid travel restrictions there is a dearth of foreigners on the trail this year. Which is kind of a bummer, as I’ll miss out on meeting the usual international hiking cadre. Quiksilver and Birdman had arrived about 2:30 and they went ahead about .3 of a mile on a side trail to Harrison’s Pierce Pond Camp to sign a group of us up for their breakfast tomorrow morning.  $12 for pancakes, eggs and the like at 7am before we head out for the Day. There’s a hard-stop at the Kennebec River about three miles away as the canoe ferry doesn’t start operating until 9am.  The river is wide and unfordable and also downstream from a damn. I’ve heard of hikers swimming across, I’ve also heard of hikers drowning in the attempt. They’ll likely be a fair crowd waiting to go across two at a time. Out trio has a short day planned, so we’re not in any particular hurry. Looking forward to yet another great day in the AT on the morrow - and it promises to be another sunny one!","East Flagstaff Road
",Pierce Pond lean to,"Jul 10, Sat",16.40
Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640792,"The Loons arrived at Pierce Pond just before sunset and serenaded the campsite well into the night. I don’t know where you stand on Loons (hopefully not directly on them, that’s just mean) but I could listen to their calls everyday.I didn’t leap up when my alarm went off, knowing I had time to kill before coffee would be ready the the Camp a quarter of a mile away. What I hadn’t known was that just .1 miles down the trail there was a 15 yard wide stream to be forded. Now, one could take the side trail to the Harrison Camp for breakfast and then take another blue blaze trail over a bridge back to the AT, but where’s the fun in that?  So off came the shoes and socks and on went my shower shoes and into the water I went. 



The deepest part only reached my knees and with some careful stepping on the submerged, moss-covered rocks I was soon across and retying my shoes. Then down to the side trail to the Harrison Camp for the $12 breakfast.
When the owner brought out three platters of pancakes at 6:58, I assumed that was for our table of 7 hikers. I, was wrong. Each of us received our own platter of 12 saucer sized blueberry-raspberry-apple pancakes.  Then came the scrambled eggs and sausage along with a glass of OJ and coffee to boot. I decided the only way I was going to eat all of that was to start and then not stop until it was all gone.  This took me 20 minutes on non-stop fork work. 



This is (burp) fine.
After breakfast I played fetch with the owner’s dog out on the front porch before leaving for the 3 mile walk to the Kennebec River. It was a nice post-bacchanalia stroll along a rushing stream dotted with waterfalls as we walked through a pine forest. There was no hurry, as the ferry doesn’t start until 9am. 


When we reached the river at 9 there were already half a dozen NOBOs waiting to cross and four SOBOs on the other side of the river coming our way. The Canoe ferry operates from May 22nd until September 30th and this time of year the hours are 9 until 2. It’s a free service for hikers as they strongly discourage attempts to ford the river due to a dam 17 miles upstream that releases water intermittently. People have list their lives trying to swim across.  


After a 45 minute wait in the queue Iceberg and I climbed in (after our safety lesson) for the paddle across. Our ferryman today was a local guide who takes people on whitewater trips. He use to do fly fighting trips as well, but said he got tired off pulling wayward hooks out of his back, arms and head. Once we were on the far bank, I thanked him and tipped him a 10-spot as I had heard you get “something special” if you do. Well the “something special” turned out to be a ferryman’s blessing where he dipped his canoe paddle in the water and thence touched it too my head and arms while asking for a safe and healthy hike for me. He said in four years anyone he had thus blessed had finished their hike. So I’ve got that going for me, which is nice. 


From there I kind of took off like a shot, hoping to cover the 6 miles to Pleasant Pond in two hours. This I did, allowing me to get there by noon and take the quarter mile side trail down to the pond shore.  I had told my wife and myself that I would not rush trough Maine, just piling up mikes. I wanted to enjoy Maine and that included at least one swim. As Pleasant Pond (again, this is a large lake) was listed as one of Maine’s cleanest and (largely) leach free, I wanted to partake of the water. The temperature was in the low 70’s and the pond (lake) was fairly warm so I splashed and floundered around for about 20 minutes. Then I went back to the small public dock and had lunch. After an hour break I was back on trail for the 1100 foot climb up Pleasant Pond Mountain.



Then my day got interesting.
About two thirds of the way up I was faced with a hunting dog with a gps collar around its neck he standing in the middle of the trail with his tail low and ears back. At first I did think it was an aggressive dog, but after a few moments I realized he was just exhausted.  I began taking calmly to him and he laid down, panting heavily. As I walked past he got up and followed. When we got to the top of the mountain I found a depression in the granite and filled it with the last half liter of water I had. He lapped it all up and then decided to be my hiking buddy.  


So for the next five miles he was either on my heal or just in front of me. About an hour later I was able to find a pool of rain water under in a rock crevasse. Once I got the diggity to understand how to reach the water, he dove in head first and drank his fill.  After that, his tail was up and he seemed much more relaxed. I passed quite a few SOBOs over the next three miles and many asked if they could pet my dog, I said “sure, but it’s not my dog”. Being constantly reminded of a Peter Sellers movie isn’t the worst way to spend an afternoon. 


Finally down the mountain and at a road crossing I came upon the dog’s owners: backwoods Mainers who had over 10 dogs out running around in the hills looking for bear. Ah well, judge not, lest ye be judged, right?



The tail end of the afternoon (tail, dog, I made a funny!) was a mosquito-ridden three mile uphill to the Bald Mountain Brook Lean-to where Iceberg, Quiksilver and I had targeted for our stopping spot. Tomorrow is going to be a little odd as the only decent camp is just nine miles away and Monson is 22 miles away. None of us really want to do 22 miles - even if the terrain is easy as we already plan to do a nero and a zero Tuesday and Wednesday.We’ll be looking for a stealth site about 15-17 miles away and hope we come up with something. 


I’m in my hammock currently, watching the light fade from the sky, with no cell signal to post this entry. Such will be the case for the next fortnight.

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640803,"Last night was one of the darkest nights I’ve had on trail as I was camped in a deep pine forest and the cloud cover was thick. Woke up twice during the night and had the literal “can’t see my hand on front of my face” moment. But, the sun came up on time and I roused a little after five.  As we had a shortish 15 mile day planned I didn’t hurry out of camp. The first two miles of trail was the climb up Moxie Bald and at times it was as if the trail were paved.  It seems like Moxie Bald is just one big piece of granite with about 2 inches of top soil in places. Where the soil had been worn away it was just a hard, smooth trail. At the top of the bald we had 360 degree views of the Maine wilderness and *maybe* a view of the final trail mountain in Maine off to the northeast.Quiksilver and I hiked pretty near one another most of the day and had 13 miles completed by noon. We had a long walk along the banks of the Piscataquis River that really reminded me off the trail between the Lower and Upper Tahquamenon falls in Michigan’s upper peninsula. I had occasion to talk to a section hiker who was out with a partner for the day and had a nice conversation. I got to the area around Lake Hebron where we planned to stealth camp when Quiksilver got word that Iceberg had called Shaw’s hiker hostel in Monson already and had booked a bunk for the night. Though this was a day earlier then we had planned, Quiksilver and I decided “what the hey” and did another six miles or so to the main road into Monson and called for a shuttle. They only had one bunk left open, so I opted to set up my hammock outside for the night. There are quite a few NOBOs here getting  ready for the last 114 miles of trail, including the 100 mile wilderness. It was good to see Allie, Rat Bastard, Birdman, Trebek and Whisper one last time. Those who started in Georgia are really feeling the end of the journey setting in. Shaw’s is kind of the last hurrah before Baxter Park and summiting Katahdin in 5-8 days. Some are still trying to decide what’s next post-trail. Tomorrow will be a zero day here in town as we await the arrival of Lamb’s Ear (wife of Quiksilver) who will be hiking the 100 mile wilderness with us. Iceberg is already scheming to do some slack packing the following two days and you know what?  I’m down to clown. This will be my last chance to jump into the Iceberg Vortex before he concludes his hike next week. Until tomorrow, adieu!","Bald Mountain Brook lean-to

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640850,"So the nero originally planned for today became a zero once we hiked the 22 miles into Monson yesterday. I slept outside in my hammock and had a peaceful, dry night and a leisurely morning as I took my hammock down well before breakfast. Iceberg woke hungry and pre-gamed the rest of his ice cream from the night before by 6:15 while awaiting the 7:00 breakfast. After everyone was done and those leaving settled their bills, we said goodbye to Ally, Peps, and Trebek as they left in the shuttle to enter the 100 mile wilderness for their planned summit on July 18th. Whisper also headed out to Katahdin, but we will likely see him as he’s not planning to summit until the 22nd, so he’s going to be camping for a few days. Being this was a zero day in town, I ate waaaaay too much. Iceberg and I had lunch with TP (Trail Pimp) at the one restaurant open for lunch. I’ve bumped into TP a handful of times since Gorham, NH and have really enjoyed her chill energy. When she went full thru-hiker and ordered Key Lime Pie for dessert, I just had to do the same. It was so good and so unnecessary after the food and beer I had already had - but I can live with the slight regret. Two Tums and a 25 minute nap later at the Hostel, all was well once more.TP has a trail story few can match, as two days ago an aggressive Goshawk swooped down on her and snatched away the hat and bug net right off of her head.  There had been warnings posted about the nesting hawks protecting their turf, but no warnings about their apparent intense interest in haberdashery.  On the downside, TP got a scare and is out some gear.  On the plus side, she covered the next half mile of trail in record time.Back at Shaw’s, Quiksilver’s wife arrived in the early afternoon, driven here from the airport by his Father and wife who came to Maine from Michigan to spend a few days exploring.  Lamb’s Ear is joining us for the last 115 miles to the northern terminus of the AT.  She owned the 51 miles of trail she hiked over three days back in Vermont last month and she’ll be a nice addition to our little hiking group over the next week.  So overall, plans have changed a bit. Tomorrow won’t be another zero, instead we will be doing a 15 mile slack pack back to Monson from the north. Then Thursday will be another slack pack 16 miles over the Chairback Mountains. Friday we’ll be dropped back on the trail with full packs (well, mostly - more on that later this week) for the last 85 miles of hiking. The trail ahead has many, many tree roots and if the predictions of rain thru Sunday materialize it’ll be slow going. We do have a lot of flexibility on when we finish, with a three day window between the 20th and 22nd. So the miles shouldn’t be an issue. But that’s all in the future. The task at hand is to just take each step, each mile, and each day as it comes. I want to make sure to enjoy whatever comes my way and be in the moment. The hikers who started in Georgia are really feeling the end of their journey rushing at them as they stay at their last hostel and do their last resupply.  For flip-floppers like Quiksilver and I, climbing Katahdin will be cool, but just another climb in a way.  But we are both looking forward to being there and experiencing the culmination of the NOBO’s hikes.  We’re really curious to see how the mostly stoic Iceberg will react!As far as things go with me, overall I feel pretty good.  Dudley is a little swollen as two days ago I once again reaggravated the never-quite-healed arch sprain that I’ve been dealing with since Virginia. I’ll likely pop some ibuprofen in the morning and once I start hiking, things be fine, as long as I remember to eat and hydrate. I’m happy with my gear and feel good about what lies ahead. I glued the peeling areas of my shoes once more and have my fingers crossed that they’ll hold until the end.  My only other option at this point would be to buy a pair of ill-fitting Altras from the gear store here at the Hostel.  I gave two more data to make that call.So being that I’ll be here at the Hostel thru Thursday, I should have daily journal posts up. After that, it’s possible I won’t have a chance to post again until I get to Bangor, Maine on Friday the 23rd. If that’s the case, I’ll probably post two days of journaling per day as I make my way towards the SOBO section of my hike from Troutville, Virginia to Mt. Springer in Georgia.","Shaw’s Hiker Hostel

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640900,"Spent a nice restful night in my “private room” (bed in the old dining room with a movable partition) at the hostel then had another too large breakfast before getting a shuttle out to the trail at 8:15. We had a half hour drive down a paved road, then a dirt road, then an old logging road to get close to the trail. I had consumed 5 cups of coffee and a liter of water before leaving the hostel and the worn springs of the Suburban gave my bladder way more than it bargained for. Relieved to get to the drop off point and soon relieved in another way, we walked .8 miles up a side trail to reach the AT and begin hiking south.  It didn’t take long for the rain to begin, starting off as a light patter in the trees. I had my rain jacket on but shed it not long after reaching the trail, as I was too warm.  I hiked the rest of the day in my normal shorts, long sleeve t-shirt, and bucket hat and was pleased to be soaked through to the skin with something other than just sweat. The rain stayed pretty much all day and varied from a light drizzle to moderate downpours a few times. Iceberg and I passed a SOBO family about 7 miles in and the youngest boy did not look to be enjoying the hike, even though they were getting close to being through the 100 mile wilderness section. I passed a handful of other SOBOs as well, including a barefoot hiker who goes by “No Shoes”.  I had heard of him from Ramdino’s weekly YouTube trail updates and knew he had to get off trail due to a foot injury. He’s back now after hiking 750 miles NOBO, having flipped up to Katahdin to go south. He was not moving very fast.I also met a few fellow NOBOs who had left the hostel this morning, including TP who had just been stung twice by yellow jackets.  It is not been her week with the wildlife. I also talked with two section hikers who told me where the bee’s nest was and I was able to walk very softly and carefully past it to avoid getting stung. Shortly after noon I sort of got into “hurry mode” and had a blast fast-hiking through the rain, rocks and roots. I got to the end of the hike a little after three and called the hostel shuttle which arrived at 3:45 just in town to also collect Iceberg and a SOBO heading for the hostel. Shaw’s is packed tonight with hikers. All 30-ish beds are full and there are roughly 15 tents set up out in the yard. The NOBO bubble is getting close, but we should finish just ahead of it next week.I just finished some delicious blueberry milk (the store was out of chocolate) which is a local thing and surprisingly good.

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640960,"The owners and staff here at Shaw’s have been phenomenal during our stay, they are real pros who excel at hospitality.  They drove Iceberg, Quiksilver, Lamb’s Ear and I out for our last slack pack at 5:30 this morning and we were back on the AT at 6:15, headed north into the Chairback mountains. 

We had a 1700 foot climb over three miles and the sunlight was absolutely gorgeous slanting through the trees and light fog. It was like we were walking in a fable. There were no sounds other than our footsteps and the birds. No cars, no planes, no leaf blowers, nothing motorized. The climbing was easy (comparatively) as long as I kept my eye on the wet tree roots that are lying in wait, looking to turn an ankle an ruin ones day. 

We had a total of six peaks to cross over and I was aiming for Chairback Third Mountain (they are a prosaic lot, these Mainers) for a lunch break and I chose wisely. There was a 180 degree panoramic view north into the mountains and I sat on a rock for 45 minutes just taking it all in. Sun, 75 degrees, food, birds taking baths in a puddle just behind me - it’s a lunch I’ll remember for a long time. 

The afternoon hike was a largely stress free walk as we all needed to finish around the same time.  We called the hostel from the last peak (Chairback One)  about 3.3 miles from the road and arranged a retrieval time of 3:30. There was one neatly vertical rock scramble after the final peak, but it was only about 150 feet and was manageable with some deliberation. 

We were all down at the logging road by 3:20 and the shuttle was there shortly after.  The road is privately owned and maintained but open for use for people to access some of the backcountry areas. There is a $16 charge for non-residents to enter and $11 for Maine residents.  There is a home hard by the road and the woman who lives there collects the tolls and she has a rope-gate that she can raise and lower from her living room to allow vehicles to pass.  Everyday in this life brings it’s little surprises!
We are still running into a lot of SOBOs which has surprised me a bit as some of them won’t finish in Georgia until Christmas with a July start. They vary from the still fresh and exited to the disillusioned and weary - probably similar to NOBOs after their first 100 miles in Georgia. Poet here at Shaw’s performs pack shakedowns to help hikers lower their base weights. Yesterday he filtered out 10 pounds of gear from one hikers pack. I know I could cut another two pounds from mine, but I refuse to give up my camp clothes. I just like changing into a (relatively) clean shirt and pants and get out of my hiking gear.  I also prefer to use three stuff sacks for my two quilts and spare clothes - another 3oz penalty.
Iceberg commented today that this was to be his last Thursday on the AT as we are planning to summit Katahdin on the 21st. We also arraigned for his (our) last resupply on Saturday when we’ll get a food drop roughly 30 miles up trail from the people here at Shaw’s. Not having to carry 5-6 days of food makes for happier, faster hikers. 

We also finalized post-trail plans on where to stay before heading for home or points South. The last hurdle will be trying to get into the thru-hiker campsite at Baxter State Park on the 20th.  But that’ll get figured out too - this is fine.


Si you may not be seeing a post from me until the 21st or 22nd as cell signals are nearly nonexistent between here and Katahdin.  I’ll be writing posts daily and then putting them up if I catch a signal or when I get to Millinocket next week.

Be well, and send some positive thoughts my way!","Long Pond Stream lean-to

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641193,"After one last night at Shaw’s where I shared a room with Iceberg, we were shuttled out at 5:30 for the hour drive down the logging road to the trail. Mike, the shuttle driver, is a retired former thru hiker from Georgia who is working for six months at Shaw’s because he likes the hiker community.  He told us that after dropping us off the previous morning he came across a full grown bull moose in the middle of the road!  We had missed seeing it by 5 minutes. 


Just a half mile into the hike we had to ford a shin-deep river, so out came my $3.32 shower flip flops/camp shoes for the crossing. Then began the last mountain climb of Maine, save Katahdin itself: a total of 3100 feet over 11 miles and four peaks to White Cap Mountain. 


Just after 10:30 there was a 15 minute heavy rain shower as I was climbing the second of the four summits. I didn’t bother with rain gear as it was 70 degrees and I was already damp from sweat. Then around 11am it started to get dark with some rumbles of thunder. It soon was so dim it seemed like it was past sunset - the kind of mid-day dark that you know means heavy rain. When the skies opened up it was a deluge, a real gully-whumper (I may have just made that saying you) and I was jump-in-the-lake wet in less than a minute. 

The trail had turned into a waterfall as I ascended White Cap Mountain and just before the top I put away my lightning rods (trekking poles) as the thunder had me slightly concerned. Then just like it began, the rain stopped as I crossed over the top. 25 minutes later the clouds started breaking up. Another half hour later and the sun came out.
There were about a dozen SOBOs that I passed today but I did not meet any NOBOs other than the three I was hiking with. We did just under 17 miles to a lean-to and I had enough time get my clothes dried out for tomorrow. There are six more SOBOs here along with a guided hike of ten sixteen years old boys who are hiking the 100 mile wilderness. They have huge packs and are carrying roughly 45 pounds of gear. Yikes!
After some discussion regarding weather forecasts and departure timelines,  Iceberg, Quiksilver, Lamb’s Ear and I came up with a three day plan to reach Baxter State Park on the afternoon of the 19th to set up a summit on the 20th or 21st. Iceberg had a rough day, tearing his shoe, face-planting, losing a water bottle, finding his bug net mildewed, and discovering some wet gear due to a hole in his pack liner. He’s ready to be done. 


Tomorrow we pick up our last resupply/food drop at 1pm then we plan to hike to the Antlers campsite and have a chill afternoon. 


Katahdin is in our sights.","Katahdin Ironworks Road

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641243,"The gaggle of 16 year old hikers finally settled in at 9:30 pm so I had a fairly restful night. There was no reason to hurry out to the trail as we had a scheduled food drop at 1pm about 12 miles away. So I hit the snooze on my watch alarm for an extra 10 minutes of shut eye. Then after a visit to Le Privy I laid back down in my hammock for a 20 minute nap. But even with all my dawdling, I was hiking out at 6:15 because I couldn’t kill anymore time. 


This section of the 100 mile wilderness is relatively flat with only one climb of note early in the morning. For the day it was only the equivalent of 148 flights of stairs. I had already decided that I would take a long break at Cooper Brook Falls lean-to and it was a great place to do so. The falls came down from the right and there was a large pool in front of the shelter. Very idyllic. I also saw my first newt since Vermont.  He was just a tiny little guy about half the length of my pinky. I was beginning to wonder if they lived this far north. 


A solo SOBO cane by after I had been there 20 minutes then Iceberg arrived just after. We chatted with her for 20 minutes and tried our best to allay her fears about the trail. Much like I had done, she was psyching herself out about the mountains of Southern Maine and then the White Mountains to follow. I didn’t try to downplay the difficulty- it’s hard miles - but you don’t have to do anything physically heroic to get through. Just be safe, plan ahead, and realize it’s a mental game, too. Iceberg was great with his calm and reasonable matter of factness.  In the end, if Grandma Gatewood managed this, almost anyone can as well. 


We all got to the road crossing for the food drop by noon. Mike from Shaw’s arrived early at 12:15 when disaster struck. Quiksilver and Lamb’s Ear were sitting on a rock by the fast moving river, when Lamb’s Ear stood, her phone tumbled in and was gone. We tried to locate it, but it was an impossible task. Maybe it’s her training as a trauma surgeon or just her nature, but she handled the loss well, reasoning that no one was hurt or anything dire. I would have rent my garments and gnashed my teeth while  changing religions twice and crying tears of rage. Then started lashing about wildly and screaming that I was on fire. Po-ta-to/po-tah-to, I guess. 


After filling my food bag with what I had sent for resupply, I hoisted my now-too-heavy pack and hiked the 3.5 miles to our planned campsite. Once we had all arrived, Lamb’s Ear and Quiksilver went for a quick swim in Jo-Mary lake. After looking at the campsites the next few days and cogitating on the miles remaining we agreed to hike another 3.4 to this lean-to to set up the next two days. Another factor was that the only water by the lake was the lake, while the Potaywadjo lean-to has an artesian spring for a water source. 


This turned out to be another good decision, as the water was cold and clear and we have the whole camp to ourselves.  After dinner we sat and shot the breeze for a bit and finalized plans for tomorrow (22 mile hike) so that we’ll have a two-day summit window. 



The Baxter State Park has strict rules on access and camping. Most of the campgrounds in the park are booked months in advance. They do have a 100 mile wilderness-only campsite named “The Birches” that is limited to 12 hikers per night and is first-come first-served on a daily basis. There is a daily sign-up list where the AT enters the park about 10 miles from the campground. Staying at The Birches leaves you with the five mile climb to the summit of Mt Katahdin and then the return down. If you can’t get into The Birches, it’s an additional 10 mile hike from the nearest campground just outside the park.With rain in the forecast the next 5 days, it looks like any summit day is as good as another. So we’re hoping to get into The Birches Monday afternoon for a Tuesday climb. 


This will be fine.","East Branch lean-to
",Potaywadjo Spring lean-to,"Jul 17, Sat",19.49
Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641280,"I heard Iceberg stirring in his tent around four as I lay in my hammock dozing, so I got up as well about 4:30. He was hiking by 5:15 but I lazed about some as Lamb’s Ear and Quiksilver starting breaking camp next to me. I meandered out at 5:45 with just shy of 22 miles to hike. We all agreed to meet at the Rainbow Springs Campsite later in the day, so it was “hike your own hike” day. 


I’ve been a little surprised at how the 100 Mile Wilderness hasn’t been as wilderness-y as I had imagined. The forest is more open and lacks the density I had been expecting. There are also many ponds with side trails and road access.  I passed a lakeside campsite this morning with a few families set up there with big tents and screened eating areas. 


The conga-line of SOBOs continues unabated, I probably passed a dozen today. I chatted with a guy who was filtering water from a lake (I’d only do this as a last resort and there were plenty of stream crossings) and he warned me about how tough the upcoming 900 foot climb was. I thanked him for the info, and then internally dismissed it. If a SOBO tells me a trail section is easy, I believe them. If they tell me something is difficult, I tend not to rely on that assessment. And the climb was steep, but not arduous at all. At the top I took the side trail to a viewpoint and was rewarded with a view of Mt Katahdin, 12 miles away as the crow flies, 35 miles by the AT.


I saw two section hikers I knew at the viewpoint - Nines and Short-shorts. They were booked into the Whitehouse Landing lodge for the previous night, but upon arriving at the dock on Pemadumcook Lake for their pickup by boat, they were told the owner changed his mind and wasn’t renting to hikers until Wednesday. Not cool. They then set up their tent at a nearby site when a Bull Moose wandered in and walked right towards them. It stood about 6 feet at the shoulder and came within 25 feet, staring and snorting. They bugged out and hoped the beast would move on, but he just stayed there.  After 45 minutes is moved around their tent and stood again, only this time with a downed tree between it and the tent. Short-shorts quietly went over, grabbed all their gear, and they hustled away.  



The hiking went well, even with a constant light rain that began about 6 am. I got 10 miles in by 10 and 14 by noon. There were lots of wet roots to contend with but I only had two slips on the day. Around 2:30 it started raining harder and when I got to the campsite at 3:15 it was a steady shower. Thankfully, I didn’t have any issues with my set up, hanging my tarp first to create a dry zone then setting up my hammock underneath. The rain is going to continue thru midnight and I might be able to pack up in the morning without any rain. I’ve got to say: my tarp and hammock setup is pretty sweet. By using my trekking poles to raise one side of the tarp into “porch mode” I have a lot of dry space at my disposal and avoid the claustrophobic feel of a cinched-down tarp. If I were dealing with strong storms or heavy winds, I’d batten down both sides to keel everything dry.I did end up eating dinner sitting in my hammock for the first time on my hike - something I’ve avoided to this point due to bears and critters.  Then I saw Nines and Short Shorts taking a break nearby, talking to Iceberg. They were going to hike on a few more miles and stealth camp, but I’m talking to them earlier, I knew they were low on food. I gave each of them a probar to help tide them over until they reached the camp store the next day. Iceberg also gave them some of his ramen he had cooked and they gratefully and quickly scarfed it down. 


So we have 11.5 miles left of the 100 Mile Wilderness, ending at Abol Bridge campground just outside Baxter State Park. We’ll go to the park kiosk a half mile further and check the sign up sheet for The Birches campground. If we can secure four spots, we’ll hike the extra ten miles (well, after hiking back to the camp store for ice cream and cold drinks) and plan to summit on Tuesday, the 20th.","Potaywadjo Spring lean-to

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641322,"It rained until about 10 o’clock last night and then the rest of the night brought the soothing drip-drip-drip from the trees overhead. I also heard a loon a few times overnight from wherever he was out on the lake. This was to be the last day of our four-day 80 mile hike to the base of Mt Katahdin. 


It remained cloudy most of the day, but the rain never materialized as we hiked. The terrain lacked any climbs over 300 feet, but as we spent much of the time hiking around lakes or next to rivers, there were multiple ups and downs through rolling terrain. I only saw two SOBOs, both getting a late start from a shelter where Iceberg and I had stopped for a snack. When I told them we had already hiked 10.7 miles by then (it was 9:45), they seemed incredulous. But, hey: I know how NOT to hike 10 miles by 10 am - don’t leave camp. 


I was able to get a good view of Katahdin from the top of Rainbow Ledges, but to tell it true, I was more focused on picking wild blueberries. They were growing everywhere on this rise and half were at peak ripeness. I slowly grazed down the trail in a half-squat that could have been straight out of an “How Early Man Lived” series on the History Channel. I wasn’t sure if I’d end up looking like Violet Beauregard from over indulging or Christopher McCandless because I was only 75% sure they were actually blueberries. 


By 11 both Iceberg and I had exited the 100 Mile Wilderness and were crossing Abol Bridge.  This did feel a little surreal to me as I’ve been reading about this iconic crossing (though it’s just a simple one lane bridge) for a decade. The view of Katahdin from the bridge was very dramatic as the summit popped in and out of the clouds. We stopped at the camp store for what would be Iceberg’s last convenience store of his hike. I had a soda and some popcorn and bought a Gatorade to pack out for later. 


We then went to the kiosk a half mile further on and found that we were the first hikers signing up for The Birches campsite. A week of wondering and uncertainty vanished as we filled out the form and began the last 10 miles to the campground. 8 of the last 10 miles from Abol to Baxter was mostly along the river and streams and was very enjoyable. The last two miles was a mosquito-riddled deer fly infested slog. I arrived a little at Katahdin Stream Campground just after 2pm and saw Birdman, who had summited that morning to complete his hike. Then I saw TP (Trail Pimp - still an awesome sobriquet) as well and happily congratulated them on completing their thru hikes. There was a mixture of relief, pride, exultation and a little unreality on their faces. Tomorrow it’ll be time for some more thru hikers to summit and complete their hikes.



There are seven hikers here tonight, getting ready for the climb tomorrow. Peps and Iceberg will be finishing their thru hikes. Quiksilver and I are finishing the NOBO portion of our respective flip-flops. Nines and Short-shorts are completing a 160 mile section hike from Grafton Notch. And Lamb’s Ear has kicked the behind of the 100 Mile Wilderness in six days.  All of us got the standard “your not in Kansas anymore” introduction/lecture from Kevin, the Baxter Park Ranger (this was fine: their house, their rules) and received our summit permits for the following day.Now it’s one more night in the woods before our planned 4:30 departure time from the campsite for the quarter mile walk back to the trail. We are really, really hoping to beat at least some of the rain and thunderstorms coming tomorrow. We pushed the mileage over the last four days as the weather for Wednesday and Thursday looks even dicier. If all goes well, we should be back down off the mountain by 2pm!

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641382,"Many hikers report that the night before they summit Katahdin they are unable to sleep due to the anticipation of the climb. I was out like a burned out light bulb by 8:30 and slept like I meant it until my alarm went off at 3:30. Iceberg had been up since just after two and Quiksilver and Lamb’s Ear were up already as well. We wanted to be out of camp by 4:30 so as to get off the mountain before possible afternoon thunderstorms.  I was also surprised to see Short Shorts and Nines up and packed, as they are later risers then we folks with a few more years under our belts and weaker bladders under our shirts. So headlamps lit (Iceberg’s last day on trail and his first swing at night hiking!), we walked the quarter mile back to the campground to drop off all the unneeded gear from our packs for the day hike up the mountain. I choose to use my regular backpack instead of borrowing a daypack from the ranger station, as I wanted my phone/camera to be easily accessible from its shoulder hosted and not in my pocket where it might fall out. I was packing a jacket, a little food, incidentals, and a liter and a half of water. The AT follows the Hunt Trail up the mountain and is just over 5 miles. The first 3 miles or so is below tree line as it moves up 2300 feet. The last 2000 feet above tree line covers the last two miles and change. Iceberg and I reached tree line first and spent a few minutes talking with Shorts and Nines before they continued up. We waited for Quiksilver and Lamb’s Ear so we could go together up the boulder climbs and summit at the same time. We all stowed away our trekking poles and got ready to move up.Immediately above the trees the trail turns nearly vertical at times.  It was hand over hand work and at times there were pieces of rebar embedded in rocks that you had to grab and pull up, then put your foot on the same rebar to push up.  It was like a vertical Mahoosuc Notch with the added adrenaline boost that comes from realizing falling would be a bit more ouchey in this instance.We had a blast.After three quarters of a mile of climbing, we reached The Gateway where the terrain flattens out into what is called the Tablelands (pic above), a relatively flat section on the ridge. From here we could see the peak in the distance about a mile and a half away. Iceberg’s anticipation was growing, he had less than 45 minutes left to go in his 2193.1 mile hike that covered five months over two years. From half a mile away we could make out the rock cairns and the silhouette of the Mt Katahdin sign.  Then we had one last 300 feet of “up” to cover.Popping over the last ridge I could see the sign just 150 feet away. I have to say - as this wasn’t the end of my hike - that up to this point I had thought of this as just another mountain climb.  But seeing the terminus of the trail right in front of me and knowing what this has meant to so many hikers over so many years…I got chills. We had Lamb’s Ear go up first followed by Quiksilver and I so we could all watch Iceberg finish his hike. To put it simply, he was ECSTATIC.  Two years of dedication and dealing with injuries, Covid, and not really liking to camp had paid off and he was achieving his goal. We took a lot of pictures, celebrated with a waiting Shorts and Nines, took some more pictures, and generally enjoyed being in the moment. We had great views only slightly obscured by smoke from Canadian wildfires drifting through the area. Then it was time to go.  We decided to take the shorter, steeper, but less potentially deadly Abol trail down the mountain to our shuttle pick up. On the way down we bumped into Pep who was a half mile from summiting and ending his hike. We congratulated him and wished him well as he takes his 19 year old self off to college on New York.  Then it was a three and half hour boulder/rock/scree/gravel slide down the mountain. It seemed to take twice as long as the climb up.  Iceberg and I had pushed our little group hard to hike through the 100 mile wilderness to get a summit day free of rain and it paid off as we had a dry and safe day.  I’ll sing the praises of Lamb’s Ear once more as she covered all those miles with out having first tucked a 1000 miles under her belt. And she did so with some blister issues too.It was special to be able to share Iceberg’s moment of accomplishment and I’m glad I bumped into him and Quiksilver on a rainy afternoon in Vermont at the Kid Gore Shelter.  Just an awesome day.We’re in Millinocket, Maine right now and getting ready to go to dinner and then make plans for the next few days.  Quiksilver and Lamb’s Ear are flying out and I’ll be waiting for my friend Jason to come out on Friday from Pennsylvania for the return trip there on Saturday. This was fine.","The Birches campsite

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641563,"It is said “confession is good for the soul.  I won’t pry into anyone’s metaphysical leanings, but regardless of where one stands on the question of the soul, letting a secret out for a walk can lift a weight of one’s shoulders.The secret I’ve been hiding is that I’ve been scheming for almost two weeks to make an unannounced trip home to Holland, Michigan, which I have now done!  There were many reasons great and small for doing so, but the big hike-related reason is that this will allow time for Quiksilver to close the 200 miles between our “flip” points and we can hook back up in early August and hike the final 731 miles together to Springer Mountain.  There is obviously something seriously amiss with him as he didn’t object to hiking another 8 weeks with me walking shotgun, but we had both talked about how different the SOBO miles were going to be without the community of thru hikers we had been around for nearly three months. I’m sure the trail won’t be empty as there will be many section hikers and campers enjoying their summer sojourns, but other long distance flip-floppers and SOBO thru hikers won’t be as far south as we will be. I’m guessing Quiksilver’s main motivation is to have someone with which to split the cost of shuttle rides.  Or I’m a charity case. Either way, I’m looking forward to having a friend as I continue hiking south. To catch everyone up: after submitting Katahdin and spending a night in Millinocket, Quicksilver, Lamb’s Ear, Iceberg and I took a shuttle to Bangor last Wednesday and had a farewell dinner that night before Quiksilver and LE flew out Thursday morning for Front Royal (Quiksilver) and home (Lamb’s Ear). Iceberg had already rented a car to spend two days explore some non-hik8ng parts of Maine and invited me to tag along as my friend Jason wouldn’t be getting to Bangor until Friday evening for our drive back to his home in Pennsylvania. Thursday we went to Bar Harbor for the de rigueur lobster experience and to find some of that iconic rocky Maine coast to admire (picture above).  Friday we went to the LL Bean headquarters/store and played tourist. My friend arrived Friday night after a grueling fourteen and a half hour drive, then we turned around early Saturday morning for the return trip which was thankfully not as time consuming due to the much lighter traffic.  I spent Sunday doing nothing but eating and enjoying his families hospitality before he took me to the Pittsburgh airport for my flight back to Michigan. Upon arrival my friend Paul collected me and then drove me home, dropping me in my driveway about 7pm.Whether my surprise was kind or not, it was a rousing success!   My wife and family had not seen through my subterfuges (what a fantastic word to transform “lying” into something that sounds almost altruistic!) and were genuinely shocked at my arrival.  So, points for me?Anyway, I did get an opportunity to help my daughter as she moved into a new apartment and to also go and see my parents, as my dad had back surgery on Monday and was still awaiting discharge from the hospital.  My bushy and overgrown beard won universal acclaim (at least that’s how I’m choosing to interpret the comments) and my backpack has been banished to the garage where it awaits a thorough cleaning.I plan on getting some trail chores done the next few days including some gear swaps and phone battery replacement.  I will have some posts up over the next week doing some gear reviews and updating when I’ll be back on trail once more - likely August 7th or thereabouts.Throw any questions you’d like answered in the guest book and once again, thanks for reading along!","Bangor, Maine

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641890,"Hello again, friends and neighbors!  I’m currently sitting at the airport in Grand Rapids, Mi waiting for my flight to Philadelphia to board where I’ll (hopefully) make a connection to a flight heading for Roanoke, Va from where I’ll take a shuttle back to the trail. 

I’ve been home for 10 nights and had the opportunity to see my family, surprise my parents, play some golf, go bike riding, help my daughter settle in to her new apartment, harass my wife’s cats, make crab cakes, mow the lawn, switch out some gear, see friends at work, drink some adult beverages, eat ice cream, and generally enjoy some off time. 
Now I’m looking forward to getting back on trail for the 731.8 miles SOBO to Georgia. In the interim, Quiksilver has hiked over 200 miles to erase the gap between our original starting points in Virginia and will be waiting in Daleville when I arrive. He’ll actually be ahead of me by a mile and a half.  Once I arrive this evening I’ll head back to my starting point just outside of town then hike back on the trail to the hotel for the night. Friday we’ll be hiking out and I’ll be back in to mountains and woods. 

I was able to plan out some food drops I’m Virginia and look at places to stay every 90 miles or so.  Whether we do any slack packing remains an open question: one that we’ll answer as we hike and see how we’re feeling and how the trail treats us.  I’m very curious to see how different the trail versus what I’ve hiked the last 5 weeks in New Hampshire and Maine.  And also how much of the “green tunnel” I’ll experience, as when I was last in Virginia there were still no leaves on the trees about 1500 feet.
I shed some equipment and swapped out a few things for this next leg. Left at home are my hiking pants (added another pair of shorts), my insulated puffy jacket (I’ll rely on my long sleeve shirt and rain jacket on chilly mornings), some clothing (spare shirt and socks), and my Ursack bear bag.  Iceberg loaned me his waterproof food bag that I’ll be hanging PCT method from a tree versus tying my Ursack to a branch. I decided on the switch due to the heavier bear activity I’ve been reading about in North Carolina and Tennessee - I’d like to avoid a bag-mauling from an ursine friend. I practiced someone line-tossing at home and I’m 75% sure this will be fine. 
My pack base weight (everything except water and food) now stands at 14 lbs. Not ultralight (that’s 10 lbs or less), but a weight I’m happy with, given that I’ll likely need to carry more water between sources with it being summer and all. I washed and my gear including my backpack (twice) and it’s mostly acceptable for polite company. 
I also added another battery charging brick as my iPhone battery performance has left me bummed out. It’s a 11 ounce weight penalty I’ll gladly accept for a little more peace of mind. 

Now my only worry is that my checked bag gets to Roanoke when I do. I’ve got my back pack as a carry on, but can’t take trekking poles or tent stakes onto the plane. So into a cheap, disposable duffel bag they went and then onto the bowels of the airport, surrendered to the whims of the American Airlines baggage handlers.  In my backpack are my hammock and quilts - things that would be very, very hard to replace on short notice. 

I’ll likely have another post up tonight derailing then sure-to-be grueling mile and a half trek (3 miles if I don’t catch a ride) from where I began my hike back on April 12th to the Super 8 in Daleville.

I had the best kind of air travel day - uneventful. No issues boarding, no delays, no luggage problems, I even arrived in Roanoke 20 minutes ahead of schedule. Strangely, the shuttle I had arraigned didn’t seem that interested in picking me up and even suggested I call an Uber. So I did. I like to support the locals who support hikers, but maybe the driver was having an off day. It happens. I first had the Uber stop by the hotel I had booked so I could drop my pack off and then had him drop me over at the trailhead where I had started waaaaay back on April 12th. That’s right: first day back and I’m already slack-packing! There was less of me then back in April and more of the trail in terms of greenery and canopy. So call today a “nero” as I did 1.4 miles. Quiksilver was already at the hotel as he had an easy 12 miles into Daleville today. We caught up on his hike over the last 10 days and my time at home. Tomorrow we will be heading out into the fun part of Virginia, getting to experience Tinker Cliffs which is the first leg of what’s termed the “Virginia Triple Crown”.  We also discussed how we plan to approach the next 730.4 miles to make sure we’re enjoying miles and the trail experience. I’m really looking forward to the next seven weeks!","Rte 11 Troutville, Va

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641958,"After a somewhat fruitless search for an open restaurant this morning, Quiksilver and I left the hotel and walked the 100 yards to the trail just about 8:30. Being my first day back hiking after being off trail for 16 days, Quiksilver agreed to take it easy in me with a 15 mile day.  While there was a decent amount of elevation gain, the trail itself was a dream: soft ground at times, few rocks or roots compared to the northeast, and the presence of switchbacks when going up a grade. In fact, even with a late start we got in 10 miles by noon and 11 miles by 12:30 when we reached Tinker Cliffs where we took a midday break for an hour. Tinker Cliffs is the first of the Virginia “Triple Crown” when heading southbound and surrenders magnificent views of the valleys below and mountains in the distance. There was even a nice breeze to keep the flies as bay as we lazed about for almost an hour. Truly idyllic. Once we got up to leave I did notice some discomfort on my right glute (a literal pain in the ass) that persisted the over the last 5 miles of the day’s hike. Also, both Harry’s and Dudley’s big toe nails are sore from trail-breaking my new pair of HOKA shoes, this despite the shoes having being worn for over 75 miles of walking since I got them after completing Maine. Again proving that flat walking Michigan terrain is NOT hiking. Other aches and pains are sure to surface when I get up tomorrow as I get back in trail shape. The non-view highlight of the day came a mile from the Campbell Shelter when we had a fun and exciting trail encounter!  Quiksilver was about 15 feet ahead of me when he suddenly executed this complicated dance-hop-high step-spin move while looking wide-eyed to his right. I thought “just an old dude, turning an ankle”. I was wrong. Quiksilver had been surprised by the warning rattle from an honest to goodness rattlesnake about 6 inches off the trail. When I can up it’s upper body was coiled as if to strike and it’s rattle unmistakably counseled caution. I wisely chose to exercise some. I moved uphill and off the trail to the left, but that just seemed to agitate it more. Once I moved past it and about 5 feet away, it stopped the rattling. We decided to wait for a few minutes to see what it did as there were a few day hikers behind us and I thought that letting them stumble across a rattler with an attitude could be considered bad form. After a minute, it started to cross the path and we could see it was about two and a half feet long. Sure enough, once it crossed the trail it went where I had been standing, slithering away on some inscrutable snake business.Blood pumping (but shorts still unsoiled) we covered the last bit to the Campbell Shelter.  We had met a Ridge Runner back at Tinker who told me that this shelter had the last water source for another 10 miles. The only water we had passed in the previous 15 was a non-flowing stream that had some pools of water. The water source here at Campbell is slightly worse (it’s high summer and Virginia has been dry) so we pulled water from a tiny puddle, using a cup to scoop about 4 ounces at a time. Both Quiksilver and I took the extra step of treating the water first - him with iodine/chlorine tablets and me with Aquapure drops - then filtering it normally. Staving off gastrointestinal distress is worth a little extra expense and effort, at least in my book. After dinner, a troop of about 10 kids aged 12-16 or so came into camp - this seems to be a reoccurring theme and a welcome one. I’ll gladly trade the additional noise and perhaps a little less sleep if that means kids are getting outside and into the woods. It’s amazing out here.   Tomorrow we’re planning to break camp by 5:30 or so and climb the last half mile up to McAfee knob and hopefully catch a sunrise. Being it’s a Saturday, we surely won’t be alone as this is one of the most popular spots in Virginia and the most photographed point on the trail (yes, more then Katahdin because more hikers make it here than make it all the way there!).  Pleasant rest to you, dear reader, if it’s evening where you are, and if it’s not, have a pleasant whatever-is-left of your day!","US Rte 220

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642014,"As planned, we were up well before dawn to pack up and climb up to McAfee Knob to watch the day arrive, leaving just after 5:30 for the .7 uphill to the overlook. I’d like to take back yesterday’s praise of young people on the trail, as this morning the group from our campsite blew past me on the uphill and made me feel bad. The wretches. 
Quiksilver and I stopped just short of McAfee at the Cliffs overlook and though the sky was cloudy and overcast, we still had amazing views all the way down into Roanoke.  We tarried for half an hour then walked the additional.1 mile to McAfee knob in order to take each other’s photo on the iconic ledge. Although I know that eventually this piece of rock is destined to break off and plunge down the cliff, I reckoned that it wasn’t likely to do so just at the moment I was standing on it. I’m such a risk taker!
After spending an additional 30 minutes at McAfee we got back to hiking. Both Quiksilver and I were dragging a bit as neither of us had slept that well, so it was a blessing to be traversing some more soft Virginia trails.  
10 miles in we reached a road where a .3 mile walk off-trail held the promise of cold drinks and food at a gas station/grocery/deli just outside Catabwa, Va. I purchased two Gatorade’s a burger, and I also bought the first YooHoo fake chocolate milk of my life in honor of Iceberg.  The Yoo-hoo was palatable, but the ingredients list left me a little bewildered at it’s length and complexity.  I’ll stick with real stuff, thanks. 
After getting back to the trail my lethargy had not abated so I told Quiksilver to go on ahead and he took off and was out of my sight in about a minute. We had a two mile climb to Dragon’s Tooth - a vertical rock formation that requires some measure of technical climbing.  Quiksilver was waiting for me at the base so we could snap a few action shots of the climb. It’s not too tough but it was mildly challenging in a “falling would hurt” kind of way.  
With that behind us, there was another 5 miles to the shelter area we planned to stop at. Water was nonexistent on the trail again today, and though Pickle Branch was .3 off trail the promise of ruining water couldn’t be passed up. We did scare up a large Barred Owl as we hiked, it flew about 70 feet away and perched in a tree, regarding us with disdain. Once we arrived at the shelter and went an additional .1 miles down to the creek, it was decided that we’d stay here for the night. We both enjoyed a 10 minute foot soak in the creek as well. 
What I didn’t enjoy so much was realizing I had blisters under both big toe nails. So I had to tend to those before dinner and I’m not sure if those nails are going to hang on. I’m not sure why I got the blisters as I’m wearing the same model Hoka shoe I wore throughout New Hampshire and Maine, but it is what it is. 
Tomorrow we plan a longer 19 mile day with a couple of substantial climbs in front of us. It’s likely to be hot and muggy so long water carries will be the rule of the day. 
Until tomorrow, sayanora!","Campbell Shelter

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642065,"It’s certainly going to be an adjustment getting used to sunrise coming after 6:30 versus 5:00 like it was up in Maine. Being further south and west makes for a dark wake up at 4:45. Accordingly, I didn’t get up until 5:30 this morning and slowly broke camp until it was light enough to hike. Quiksilver and I planned on a 19 mile day and had also scoped out water sources for the trek. The day started with a 1500 foot climb over four miles on more of that gentle, switch-backy Virginia trail. It’s nice to be able to actually walk and not to constantly short-stepping or long-striding betwixt rocks and tree roots, which was the order of the day the last 400 miles NOBO. At the top of the climb there was a short side trail to the Audie Murphy memorial.  Audie was one of the most decorated soldiers in WW2 and tragically lost his life  in a plane crash near this spot back in 1971. It was quite moving to see not only the monument itself, but also all the small mementos - some very personal- that people have left by the monument over the years. A long three mile downhill and then two mile uphill brought me to the Niday shelter where I loaded up with 4.5 liters of water and took a lunch break. I also took some time to examine my toenail blisters *GROSS CONTENT WARNING* and popped the one on Dudley resulting in a Mt St Helens eruption of fluid. Needless to say, my big toes hurt. But I laced back into my shoes and hoisted my very heavy, water laden pack and continued uphill.  Quiksilver pulled into the shelter just as I was leaving and we confirmed the plan to hike another 9 miles. The afternoon brought with it sun and temps of 90 degrees, so it got a little…warm. I shifted down into plod mode and gave myself 5 hours to get to camp. There were some rock slab traverses that brought back memories of New York and New England, but the views were a fantastic recompense for the dicey footing. Today was also a big wildlife day with many deer to be seen (including an 8-point buck), a box turtle ambling along the trail, a 4 foot black snake that scared the bejesus out of me when it dashed across the trail under my descending foot, and lizards galore running hither and yon. Tomorrow is going to be another hot day - in fact the whole week will be hot - and we have two big climbs. The second of which will take us above 4000 feet. That second climb will be with loaded packs again as there won’t be any water once you start the climb. So it’ll be 4-5 liters - that’s 10-12 pounds - on the back for the last 12 miles of the day. This is fine. Dehydration is worse than discomfort.","Pickle Branch Shelter

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642102,"It got surprisingly cold and damp last night, probably attributable to camping near a creek and on the west side of a ridge. Cold enough that I pulled out my top quilt and laid it over my legs about 3 am and damp enough that my hammock was noticeably wet to the touch when I packed up. Also being on the west side of the ridge meant that the sunrise was further delayed and I didn’t head out until 6:30. 



The first three miles of the day took me through gorgeous rolling pasture land that was being lit by the rising sun and was awash in golden light. Just an awesome morning to be out for a walk. I must have seen or spooked two dozen deer as I passed on thru and even saw a deer grazing amongst some cattle on a ridge. I was able to have a nice conversation with a spike-buck, telling him he could enjoy this year, but next year he’s better watch out for hunters.

I had left camp with one liter of water and armed with information from the Guthook app that there was a flowing stream 3.5 miles distant. This turned out to be…optimistic.  When I reached the stream it was barely flowing and I had to use a scoop and a little patience to get a liter and a half for the 1600 foot climb up to Kelly Knob. The trail was fairly tight with many large bushes on either side, which naturally meant a LOT of silk blazing. But I endured (hopefully my medal is already in the mail) and took the side trail to the Kelly Knob overlook. To get the best view required a large, four foot stride over a crevasse between two rock slabs with a potential 20 foot fall in one slipped. This one didn’t and I was rewarded with a “meh” view over some trees. 


A mile ridge walk gave way to a three mile downhill section and then another  half mile uphill to the Warspur Shelter and the last water we’d see for about 10 miles. The first three of those miles took us up 1900 feet to a ridge that is over 4000 feet tall. It was after the climb that the real challenge began. 



The next six miles along and up and down the ridge was on trail mostly overgrown with grass, weeds, and pricker bushes. When that came to an end then the loose rock section began. It was like Maryland all over again: I say nice things about the trail and the next day it turns into a torture chamber.
Quiksilver had passed me as I stopped for lunch back at Warspur shelter and we agreed to meet at Bailey’s Gap shelter before deciding if we’d hike farther - which was our original plan. When I stumbled into Bailey’s Gap scratched, bleeding and footsore I was delighted to find Quiksilver in the same condition. Well, not delighted he was scratched, bleeding and footsore - but glad he didn’t want to hike any further today either. So we called it at 3:30 and then sat and did nothing for almost an hour. 


It’s now 6:00 and we’ve cleaned up, eaten, hung out food bags and are now staring longingly at the hammocks. 


We’ve also decided to do a shorter 16.5 mile day tomorrow and then have a 10 mile day into Pearisburg on Wednesday. We’ll see if that plan holds. 


I hope everyone reading this is finding a way to enjoy this last month of summer.","Stealth Site

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642169,"It was another big night for the tree frogs at the Bailey’s Gap Shelter as they started their serenade at sunset and kept it up until 3 am. Once they had taken their bows and exited stage left, the owls had their turn at bat calling back and forth to each other, undoubtedly bragging about all the tree frogs they had eaten that night. Quiksilver and I had set our sights on a 16 mile day, anticipating more of the rocky and overgrown trail we had yesterday - as had been reported to us by hikers two days ago. I got on trail at 6:45, waiting for the sun to rise so as to make the downhill trail a little less treacherous. There were some dark rhododendron thickets to walk through that really block out the light and lend a quiet stillness to the trail. I always enjoy those sections. I got to my first planned stop at 4 miles where the last water source was located. After ranking up with 3.5 liters I ate a snack and tended to my tootsies. Then I noticed, for reasons known only to him, that Dudley had decided to sprout a blister on the back of his heal. This is fine. Socks and shoes back on, I hit the trail for the 1700 foot climb ahead. This was one of those cases where the elevation and trail profiles tell one story, the trail another. It was perhaps the quickest and easiest climb I’ve had to date. The progressive switchbacks served as a distraction and before I realized it, I was on flat terrain. I consulted the trail app to make sure I wasn’t being fooled, but I was indeed at the top of the climb: score!A little later I stopped for a lunch break and Quiksilver caught up to me. Being that we only had another 7.5 miles to the shelter, we took it easy and hiked together. This was the stretch of bad trail we had been warned about and our low expectations for good Trail we’re firmly in place. But…it wasn’t that bad. I mean, it wasn’t great, but it wasn’t bad. I only ended up bleeding from a half dozen new spots on my arms and legs, so not bad! And I want to make it clear: I don’t think I’m owed good trail. The maintenance on the AT is done by volunteers and life can pop up for anyone. They work hard when they can to keep things clear for the hikers, it’s just that the local trail club is having a hard time getting any right now. Hopefully things I prove for them next year. We cruised into the Rice Field shelter at 2:30 and stuck to the plan to call it a day. We only have 7.5 miles into Pearisburg in the morning for a chore day and relaxing afternoon. We had a good time shooting the breeze until 7 and right now I’m on a ridge looking over the stunning countryside, only wishing my wife were here as well. So expect a restaurant report tomorrow and a review of the Angel’s Rest Hostel - which is supposed to be a peach of a place. Goodnight, all!","Bailey’s Gap shelter

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642216,"After watching the sunset I retired to my hammock where I was inundated with strange dreams involving (in no particular order): Earthquakes, having my dog (which turned into a kind of tyrannosaurus bear) chase my friend Mike, being suspended above a hockey rink during an NHL game by Meredith from the office, buying the house next to mine (but not my actual house) and finding it was full of spiders that talked.  Please, any Freudians out there, keep your analysis to yourselves. I got up and went back out to the ridge (which was actually in West Virginia) and watched the day arrive over the valleys and mountains.  Then Quiksilver and I lit out at seven for the short day into Pearisburg. He took off with verve and was soon out of sight. This bummed me out not in the least as he would be the one doing the silk blazing today!  Once of the ridge it was a pretty dull, mostly downhill hike. I listened to an Isaac Asimov Foundation novel on audiobook as I hiked. About four miles in I started running into a lot of spider webs and it took me about five minutes to realize that this seemed odd. I wondered: “Is Quiksilver ducking under these to mess with me?” Just then I got a text from him that he took a wrong turn and was behind me. I remain dubious - he may have hidden and let me pass to do the silk sweep again. I’ll have to keep a closer eye on him. Once we crossed the New River we called the hostel for a shuttle and they arrived toot-sweet. The shower felt fantastic after five hot and humid days of hiking. All the clothes went into the laundry and we walked half a mile to a Hardees for some breakfast-like substances and middling coffee. Quiksilver also got a milkshake. Then on the way to the local outfitters we passed a Dairy Queen and a splurged on a caramel Moolatte and, channeling his inner Iceberg, Quiksilver stepped up and sent a blizzard chasing after the milkshake he had just finished. I spent the afternoon getting caught up on my iMovie project - I hadn’t updated anything since July 12th and getting my pack reorganized with the food box I had mailed to the hostel. My food bag weighs in at 10lbs - that’s five days of food - which makes me a little bit weepy knowing how much water I’ll be carrying as well over the next week. Ugh. This is fine. There is a NOBO hiker here named Ursa who started in Georgia after Memorial Day and two other SOBO flip floppers - Doc and Professor who apparently have been just behind Quiksilver and I since leaving Daleville. So we may be not so alone on the trail the next few weeks. We shall see.  We’re heading out around seven tomorrow with a big climb out of town and into the ridge-dessert of Virginia.  Hopefully looking to do 18-20 miles but the trail will tell. Oh, and today’s picture is of one of the hostel dogs here.  He enjoys standing on the picnic table, all the better to drool on your neck when you sit down and then put his head by your ear until you pet him to his satisfaction. Good times!","Rice Field Shelter

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642291,"Had a great night in the air conditioned bunkhouse at Angel’s Rest hostel and woke up rested and ready. What I wasn’t ready for was a trip to Hardee’s with Quiksilver - once was enough for me. Instead I ate the fresh pineapple I picked up from the grocery store yesterday and forced myself to drink a liter of water to hydrate. The hostel owner, Doc Peppa (chiropractic and acupuncture available) drove Quiksilver and I back to the trail at 7am.  The staff at the hostel were all great and it was a clean and quiet half day off. It was a steep 2000 foot climb out of Pearisburg and frankly, it kicked my tookus.  I was soaked through and wore out after the 3.5 mile climb and drank half of the water I had carried out. We had planned to hike to the Doc’s Knob shelter about 9 miles in, meet up, and see if the spring there had any water. It didn’t. So we engaged Plan B and after hiking another two miles we did a half mile road walk to Wood’s Hole hostel. Wood’s Hole had been open since 1986, the current owner is the daughter of the original owner and she’s done a fantastic job with the place. It’s rustic, but has been modernized and had shade and rocking chairs galore. The owner welcomed us to rest as long as we liked and allowed us to fill our water bottles as well.  Quiksilver treated me to a 7up and we took an hour break in the shade. Doc and Professor came in just as we were leaving and we sketched out our afternoon plans. Quiksilver was aiming to do 43 miles in two days to meet up with a NOBO section hiker he had met coming our direction. So we had decided to shoot for a 21 mile day and hopefully camp near water. The briars returned with a vengeance in the afternoon and I ended up with some fresh scratches on me and fresh snags in my clothes. Thankfully, the last 4 miles had clear trail as we were pretty tired through the afternoon. Our water source near camp was a barely flowing creek, but the water was cold and clear and we tanked up. We got to the stealth site at 4:30 and spent an hour setting up before Doc and Professor arrived.  So we’re all camped here for the night. Well, we four and about two dozen bees that started swarming my clothes that I had laid on top of my tarp to dry. I didn’t notice them until I went to pick up my shorts and got stung on the finger for me troubles. I’ve never seen this before: bees attracted to sweaty hiker clothes. I reasoned I have a brain exponentially larger than a bee so there must be a way to get my stuff off the tarp without earning a dozen stings for my troubles. Enter the 8 foot stick.Having scrounged a long branch, I gingerly removed everything one by one and slowly moved them away from my tarp, being very patient in letting the attached bees to fly off. Which they were somewhat reluctant to do. Once I had everything, I ducked under the tarp and stowed the clothes, then slid into my hammock and zipped closed my bug net. Now an hour has past, but the dirty buggers are still swarming around, on, and under my tarp. If they don’t disperse by morning, pack up will be…interesting. Tomorrow we plan to hike 22 miles, with the last water source being a gas station a half mile off trail about six miles distant. I’m confident that some of this, will indeed be fine.","Angel’s Rest Hiker Hostel

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642332,"Suffice it to say, my dreams were dominated by all things yellow jackets.  I won’t go into detail, the strangeness was a little much even for me, but it wasn’t the most restful night, waiting to see what I would be facing from my winged nemesis’s.   I was using the red light on my headlamp and working in the dark, just in case the bees came back at sunrise. It was one of the quickest pack ups I’ve done, all while freaking out every time I saw bug fly by. I did find two of the yellow jackets still on my tarp. They are now resting in peace. Quiksilver and I got on trail at 6:30, knowing we had a 22 mile day planned and that we’d continue experiencing a typical hot, humid, dry Virginia summer day. Professor caught up to us about 3 miles out and we hiked together for another hour and then did a .5 mile road walk to Trent’s grocery. What a great place. It’s a combo gas station, convenience store, grill, gun shop, and meeting place. They happily fixed us cheeseburgers at 8:30 am while we purchased cold drinks and hot coffee. A klatch of local retirees were seated at the tables with one old overweight gentleman telling another old overweight gentleman “you’ve got to quit eating all that processed crap, get some cauliflower and steam it and don’t drown the damn things in cheese”.  Sage advice!We chilled there for an hour, long enough for me to break down and buy myself the first Moon Pie I’ve had in a quarter century. I have no regrets. Then came the water calculations: how much to carry over the next 16 dry miles to stave off heat stroke while not carrying to much and causing back ache from the weight?  Given that the shelter we were aiming for likely had no water, I decided on just under 4 liters, and filled up. After getting back to the trail there was a fairly steep 800 foot climb through pasture and woodland. There was a very large bull in the pasture about 20 feet off the trail, but he seemed much more interested in eating thistle than messing with us. As per normal, I was sluggish after eating and Quiksilver quickly disappeared ahead of me. Once the climb was done, it was a lot of bebopping up and down along a ridge.  There were a lot of thunderstorms in the area all afternoon and at one point I was bookended by thunderstorm on either side of the ridge. After hiking 8 miles I ran into Quiksilver, who was taking a break. We assessed the ongoing water situation and that Lost and Found - a NOBO section hiker we were supposed to meet at the shelter - had decided to go to Weary Feet hostel instead of the dry shelter. We decided to do this same, but rather than get off at the road we were at, decided to hike another 8 miles to the next road crossing in order to get this dry section completed. So he called the hostel and arranged a pick up three hours hence. I took the lead on the trail from there and had a total silk blazing free for all for the next eight miles. I was covered in webs by the time I was done. The only things that broke up the monotonous horror was seeing a juvenile bear running away from me downhill and then having a staring contest with a large Whitetail Doe that was standing in the middle of the trail. I won.Also today we crossed two milestones: less than 600 miles to go and more than 1600 miles hiked on the AT.  Today’s picture is of the 600 miles to go written with rocks that was right beside the trail.So we’re now at the Weary Feet hostel, a really nice old farm house converted into a hostel. The owner is great and has a well appointed place here.  Because of the water situation, we’re going Iceberg tomorrow and doing a 16.5 mile slack pack NOBO back towards the hostel for a seconds night stay.  I’m sitting on the front porch, keeping an eye on the storms roaming around the ridges that surround the hostel. Goodnight!","Stealth Site

Our shuttle driver Robbie is a great dude, we talked hunting and cattle ranching (he runs the farm for hostel owner Julie on addition to helping at the hostel) during the drive and I learned that in rural Virginia, you didn’t grow up somewhere, you grewed up somewhere. After hiking 44 miles over two days with an over-full pack, it was nice to have about 6 pounds riding on my spine today. The trail was also in pretty good shape with nice grades on the climbs and very few briars - only one bleeding scratch today! Quiksilver and I hiked together the whole day as well, talking about this and that and just enjoying a nice day. There was only one view to be had on the day (pic above), but it was a stunner with the blue sky and clouds over the valley below. We also had a bear encounter as we rounded a corner of a ridge and surprised a mama bear and her two cubs about 50 yards ahead right on the trail!  They initially broke uphill, but then the cubs ran back downhill with one continuing down the slope but the other climbed a tree right next to the trail. Mom then ran back and paused on the trail and stared at us before continuing about 30 yards downhill and then stopping to keep an eye on us. After roughly 5 minutes, the treed cub slowly started down while watching us, then scrambled down the last 15 feet to join his family. We hiked on then. We covered the 16.6 miles in just under 6 hours (hooray slack packing!), feeling pretty good about the day. Then we enjoyed a nice home cooked dinner from Julie and then had some of her homemade pound cake and sweet tea. Quiksilver has been hiking for 12 straight days, so made the decision to take a zero tomorrow. We’re still on schedule for our anticipated but not cast in stone “summit” of Springer Mountain in late September. It looks we are going to get a visit from tropical storm Fred next week and they are currently predicting 2-3 inches of rain for the AT where we will be hiking. They really, really need the rain here. I’m finishing my night watching the fire flies in the field in front on the hostel and listening to the thunder from stray storms in the area.

Quiksilver fulfilled his function as a trail-dad and walked with her to the road crossing. I fulfilled my role as trail-slug and sat on the porch, drinking coffee. Weary Feet isn’t close to anything other than the trail and Trent’s Grocery store, which happens to be closed on Sunday’s. So today was a true zero day with nothing on the agenda. I chose to read a trail book called “Platinum Blazing the AT” which gives advice to the deep-pocket set on how to have the most possible first-class experience on the trail. After perusing that offering, I read a good bit of Treasure Island- something I’ve been meaning to read for years. After lunch I went for a leisurely walk (side note: rural Virginia drivers speed like armies of the living dead are following them) and managed to secure one bar of ATT cell signal and used that opportunity to call my parents.  I hope they enjoyed their chat with their hobo son as much as I did chatting with them, though the two horses staring at me from the other side of the pasture fence didn’t seem to be enjoying my proximity to them at all. The hostel owner’s husband stopped in and sat for a bit on the porch with me and we bonded over a mutual dislike of North Carolina Tarheel basketball.  Then Quiksilver and I spent a half hour or so fishing for Brook Trout in the stream in front of the hostel. I did catch one trout to his zero, bringing back memories of the many, many times I’ve out-fished my younger brother. One takes small victories, when that’s all that’s available!We also did a little map-reading of the trail ahead over the next week to see where we can find water and do a resupply. Next up will be a two day hike to Atkins, Va before heading on to Damascus and the end of Virginia, but that’s still 95 miles in the future. One day at a time.","Weary Feet hostel

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642517,"Fred arrived last night just a lot 7:30 with a rumble of thunder and a gust of wind. I had been dozing in my hammock and got up to tie down the storm doors on my tarp (just in case).  When I laid back down, I could hear the wave of rain approaching through the trees and when it started it soon became a torrent. It rained hard for a good 45 minutes and I had a waterfall off the far corner of my setup. 
The rain finally eased and then was sporadic until 2am and then stopped altogether after that. Waking at 5:45, I found myself and my gear happily dry. I’m getting very confident with my camp skills (yes, I’m now preparing to eat those words at some point). Quiksilver had also weathered the rain just fine and we headed out at 7:15 for a two mile hike to the Bear Garden Hostel where we hoped to get water for the rest of the day. 
The sign posted for the hostel read “cold pop for sale” and Quiksilver said that had to mean that the owner was from the upper Midwest as we’re the only ones who call it “pop”.  Upon arrival we met the hostel owner Bob and sure enough, he was a retired school teacher from Michigan who had moved to Virginia and opened this hostel with his wife. He was on his way out, but told us to make ourselves at home and just leave money on the table for whatever we bought. In honor of our shared Big Thumb heritage, I chose a $1 Faygo orange pop from the fridge. We got watered up for the rest of the day and got back on trail at 9 o’clock. 
There weren’t going to be any views in the day, just trail through pasture land and a series of climbs and descents ranging from 400 to 900 feet as we made our way another 12.5 miles to Atkins, Virginia. Portions of the trail were very overgrown once more, through we did come across a farmer doing some trail clearing through his property with a big Case skid-steer with a brush hog attachment on it. We passed along our sincere thanks!
Unlike the pastures I crossed up north, the Virginia pastures have been well stocked with cows, which is of course, awesome. The downside today was that it rained so hard from 9 until 12:30 that I couldn’t unlock my iPhone due to all the moisture on my hands and on the phone screen. Consequently, I was unable to get any pictures or videos of my close enCowters.  Dang. 
We also passed to NOBO section hikers who were not enjoying the rain as much as Quiksilver and I were. We recommended they pop in (see what I did there) to the Bear Garden Hostel for the night and dry out. We were doing the same in Atkins as we had contacted a Trail Angel by the name of Murray-Ann who takes in hikers at her home about 10 miles off trail. I had found her name listed on Guthook and thought this might prove to be another memorable trail experience.
We called her from the Mexican restaurant that is right on the trail by the interstate exit (8.75 lunch special: three chicken enchiladas - DONE!) and she picked us up there. She and her late husband bought an 1870’s house and opened it up through the years to hikers. It’s not a hostel, they do this just because. (see Hebrews 13:2 for her reasoning). Murray-Ann’s husband George he thru-hiked the trail many years ago and even after he passed away in 2014 she continued and continues to take in hikers. The house is gorgeous, though like any old home, it’s a work in progress. She made us vegetable beef soup with homemade bread for dinner and chocolate cake for dessert. 
We sat for almost three hours and talked about her husband, her remodeling skills (formidable), hikers she’s met, our shared love of the trail and the people on and around it, and her three dogs. Just another unexpected, serendipitous evening on this journey. 
It’s still raining hard here, but the tornado watches have expired and tomorrow afternoon we’ll revert back to typical August weather in this neck of the woods: 80 degrees with a 30% chance of afternoon thundershowers. Quiksilver and I will be heading out with the goal of covering the 75 miles to Damascus by Saturday afternoon. I’m not sure what cell service will be like along the way, but I’ll endeavor to post promptly when I can.

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642491,"Julie came and collected us at 7 this morning, but not before I had one more glass of her awesome sweat tea (it was good, not like McDonald’s syrupy sweet tea - blech!) and some coffee. The ride back to the trail took an hour and 15 minutes and my poor bladder, swimming with sweat tea and coffee, barely made the voyage intact. 


Once at the trailhead, Quiksilver and I each gave her $20 as a thank you for the water caches she and her staff have been doing during the drought and to help fund the continued effort. 


Camped at the trailhead was a group of volunteer trail maintainers from a group called “SAWS”, though from what we could tell, they must have just arrived the night before and hadn’t done any trail maintenance as of yet. 


We hiked off into the damp clouds that had descended on the ridge line and spent the next three hours hiking amongst the drips and mists. Around 11am after a steep climb, we reached the Chestnut Knob Shelter. It’s a stone hut built in the 1920’s for the fire warden’s use and has been remodeled a few times since. It’s a fully enclosed structure, which is very rare for the AT.  We had lunch inside and read the various shelter log entries, well…Quiksilver read entries and I watched for mice. 


Shortly after hiking out we had our first and only views of the day when descending from the shelter and shortly after that, the rains started.  For the next three hours it varied from a light drizzle to heavy downpours. This is probably going to be pretty constant for the next two or three days as Tropical Storm Fred enters the region. 


Around one thirty we came to Lick Creek (the only water source on the day) where the trail bridge had washed away a while back. Due to the drought, I barely got my shoes wet when walking across the stream bed. They did, however, get soaked from above as the rain really came down while I was gathering and filtering water. 


We met a NOBO section hiker named Bandanna just past the creek and we spent a few minutes trading trail intel both north and south. Bandanna is doing a LASH (long ass section hike) from Georgia to Harpers Ferry - I have no doubt he’ll make his goal. 


We eventually reached our target of Knot Maul Shelter at 3 just as the rain - which had let up for a bit - started in again. So we sat in the shelter for 30 minutes and waited it out before setting up our hammocks and doing camp chores.  It looks as if the rain will return after midnight and then pretty much stay all day Tuesday as we hike another 15 miles or so to Atkins, Virginia. 


My poor widdle toenails are a bit better today, but in true trail fashion, my left achilles is slightly swollen and sore. I’ll wear a compression sock tonight and see if that makes it any better in the morning. It’s always something out here. As Doc said a few days ago: “you can’t walk this many miles and expect everything to be in good shape when you’re done”.


I’ll post this entry (written Monday evening) as soon as I can but the rain may preclude that until Tuesday evening. We shall see.","Va Rte 623

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642684,"So yesterday afternoon, Quiksilver received an out-of-the-blue text from an unknown person, indicating they had got his number from an emergency contact list on a phone they had found. The phone they had found was in a river up in Maine by Jo-Mary road. It seems that a 13 year old boy had spotted the phone that Lamb’s Ear had lost a month ago, underneath the bridge about 75 yards from where it entered the river. The lad’s mom had plugged it in and it charged up and that’s how they got Quiksilver’s number. A month submerged in the river, and the iPhone still worked. Lambs ear had already replaced her phone weeks ago, so she very kindly invoked the ancient “Finders-Keepers” rule and told the mom that if she was ok with it, the boy could keep it. Pretty awesome story, all the way around. 


Had a very restful evening at Murray-Ann’s, sleeping on a soft bed with a ceiling fan going all night. I didn’t hear the wind and weather hit around 1am, as I was on the side away from it’s approach. Our host fixed us eggs, cinnamon toast, and coffee and we returned the favor by clearing away some hard to reach cobwebs from the upstairs hallway. Murray drove us back to the trail at 7:45 (a single hand on the wheel of her Jag; hugging the blind corner’s like an Indy Car driver)


We said our grateful goodbyes in the gas station parking lot and thanked her for a truly memorable stay. What an awesome lady. 


We then pointed ourselves uphill and started back SOBO into the woods. It had been sunny in the valley back at Murray-Ann’s house, but looking up into the hills, the clouds had not lifted. We had a 1600 foot climb up to the tree covered top of Glade Mountain, so we got to it. In order to reach Damascus by Saturday, we needed to hike about 21 today to reach a shelter area and set up the next few days. With all the bopping up and down we had a decent elevation gain for the day. 


We stopped just after noon at the Mt Rogers visitors center which is still closed due to Covid, for reasons that must be clear to them. It had been raining pretty steady since we got over 3000 feet on the climb and I was soaked through. I had a piece of cake that Murray-Ann had sent along as well as a new menu item for Ol’ Sev: pepperoni wraps. Not bad. 


We left, with 10 miles still ahead of us and rain clouds gathering again. It did rain briefly, but then cleared up around two as we ridge-hopped into the afternoon. I could feel my feet starting to crack and get hot spots due to being wet for the last few days (hooray!) but on I went, goal in mind. The rain the last two days has also jump-started some of the creeks. In fact, this was the first day since I’ve been back in trail that we found water somewhere other than the bottom of a valley. 


Also saw a lot of dear again today, including three bucks - the largest of which was a six-point. I’ve now encountered deer everyday I’ve been on the trail in Virginia. No bears the last few days, though. Dang. 


We did pass three SOBO section hikers today, one of whom had been hiking for two months, averaging 7 miles a day. Once upon a time, I may have been judgmental about this, but being out here on the trail, I’ve grown to respect all the hikers, regardless of miles. 


Arriving at the shelter about 4:15, we got set up and started to unwind. Well, at least until I got stung once again by a yellow jacket.  Little @$”;#*^~!!  This shelter also has the first bear box we’ve seen in Virginia. Apparently there has been a lot of bear activity from here to Damascus and all the shelters will have boxes at them. So no hanging food bags!  This is super-fine.


I’m mostly dried out (until I put on my wet hiking clothes in the morning) and relaxing in my hammock, safely away from the bee-riddled shelter. Tomorrow we hope to hike another 20 miles, but there are three big climbs in front of us, the last of which (if we get that far) will be a climb up to just under 5000 feet. 


We shall see!","Highway 11

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642724,"It’s still an adjustment for me to not be up at 4:45 like I was on the trail in New England. At 5:45 this morning it was still pitch dark in the Virginia woods and wasn’t light enough to hike until 6:45.  I put on my still-wet clothes and shoes from yesterday and took down my camp set up.  Quiksilver was having a blister issue, so I warily unpacked my pack by the shelter (keeping an eye peeled for early rising bees) and gave some moleskin to him before packing back up and getting trail bound at 7. 


We agreed to meet up at Old Orchard Shelter about 15 miles away just to make sure we were both feeling good and were on target for our planned 20 mile day. 


I chose not to wear sock liners today, hoping that just having my merino wool hiking socks on would allow my feet to dry better during the day, if given an opportunity. I won’t go into groddy detail, but my toes aren’t looking so fine between nail issues and blisters from the previous two wet days. My left achilles is still a bit tender from stepping in a hole in the front yard of the Weary Feet hostel a few days ago. Something upon which to keep an eye. 


It was a green tunnel day on the trail with no views to be had and the trail was quite rocky at times, requiring my full attention on each step. The three climbs on the day were not strenuous at all with good inclines up all three. I only spied one deer today as it ran off to the left as I approached it. Not much other wildlife to be seen, either. I was able to send out yesterday’s journal entry at the top of climb number two, so that was a relief. 


I reached the Old Orchard Shelter at 1:15 and had my breakfast/lunch. I had only stopped briefly up until then to grab a liter of water from a stream, not even bothering to take off my pack. I munched a peanut butter and Cheetos wrap (variety bring the spice of life) along with a few odds and ends from my food bag. Two SOBO section hikers arrived and I chatted with them for a bit before Quiksilver arrived.  We both were feeling good and agreed to hike another 5.4 miles to the campsite we had picked out. 


This last section (after finishing the climb to 4952 feet) brought us into the Grayson Highlands area of Virginia. The highlands used to be a big ranching area and the US Forest Service now owns most of it and has stocked the area with “wild” ponies that serve to keep the vegetation chewed down. I crossed a few different gated areas designed to keep the ponies in place, and much like the Moose up north, the trail was littered with signs of their presence.
 I didn’t see any ponies today, but will have one more chance tomorrow as I hike on. 


We arrived at the Big Wilson Creek campsite just about the time the scattered showers and thundershowers did. I set up in the rain, had dinner in the sun, and then packed up my food bag in the rain once more. Pony “sign” is littered all over the ground here and it’s possible we may get a visit during the night. 


I can hear more thunder in the distance as I write this, not sure what the weather has in store for me tomorrow, but I’m hoping for some clear skies as we climb up over 5000 feet twice before starting the downhill into Damascus on Saturday. 


Sometime in the morning we will pass the 500 miles to go mark.  That seems like a pretty big number still!","Trimpi Shelter

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642735,"Last night’s rain tapered off about 8 o’clock and stayed away the rest of the evening. It did get a little chilly around 3 and I pulled out my top quilt for the first time since I was in Maine. Quiksilver and I both woke up with the same idea: quick pack up and hike one tenth of a mile to the Wise Shelter and their handy privy!
Morning ablutions completed, we hiked out at 6:45 for the climb up to 5475 feet in the Grayson Highlands. The trail this morning put me in mind of other places on my hike: we had Pennsylvania rocks, Vermont water sources, Connecticut/New York waterfall trails, New Hampshire mossy woods, and Maine rock slabs and cloud walking. It rained on and off, either that or the clouds were so thick it was like walking through the rain itself. My beard was dripping most of the morning from the accumulated moisture. We did get our pony encounter, though!  There was a mare with two foals standing in the middle of the trail as well as a few other ponies just off trail in the brush. They were pint-sized cute and didn’t seem to fussed with our presence. Later I saw more ponies as well as some grazing Longhorn Cattle in a pasture above 5000 feet. So I left the highlands feeling like I got to check the trail experience box with gusto. 
Quiksilver and I split up shortly after, as he hiked a side trail to the summit of Mt Rogers, Virginia’s highest point. He’s been collecting state high points along the trail in a semi-competition with a neighbor back home. Being as there was no views from the summit (clouds or no: it’s tree covered) I declined the extra 1.2 miles and hiked on. 
The afternoon trail descending from the highlands was mostly annoying. A mixture of rocks, green tunnel and stinging nettles overhanging the trail. Ah well, bad trail makes the good trail even more appreciated and I still was able to see the wild ponies. This is fine. 
I stopped about 1:45 at Lost Mountain shelter after hiking just shy of 18 miles, where we had agreed to rendezvous and determine if we were going to hike anymore. Quiksilver arrived at 2:15 and after cogitating for 15 minutes, we decided to tack on another 6.5 miles so as to be closer to town Saturday. 
Thankfully, most of the last 6.5 miles was on good trail (thanks, contrast!) so I covered the distance in two hours and 15 minutes. There was even a little sun shining down when I arrived so I was able to pretend to dry my clothes out a bit. Hammock set up and water retrieved from about .1 miles away, I sat down to a repast of a peanut butter tortilla wrap, mixed nuts, and a chocolate almond butter packet. I also chatted with Rocket Man, a really late starting NOBO lad who seems serious about completing a thru hike. He’ll have to flip up to Maine eventually before they close Baxter State Park in October and then hike south. But I like his chances. 
Third day in a row I don’t have enough cell signal to post any pictures, but I should be able to put some up when we get to Damascus tomorrow morning. 
Hope everyone reading this is well, and I really appreciate that you are taking the time to follow along. We passed the 500 miles to go mark today as well as the 1700 miles hiked. Soon, we’ll be in our last month of hiking. We’re not counting our chickens just yet, that’ll wait until Georgia!","Big Walker Creek campsite

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642781,"It was fairly bright in the woods last night with the moon almost full, but for reasons unknown, I just couldn’t seem to fall asleep until 10:30 or so. Both Quiksilver and I were trail-ready at 6:45 for our NERO into Damascus.It was a mostly ho-hum treadway with one view and one 500 foot climb. Though we did encounter a bear crossing the trail in front of us about 50 feet away - which makes my 10th bear of the trip. While we hiked we could occasionally see the Virginia Creeper Trail off to our left, a former railroad line that had been converted into a bike/walking path that is mildly graded and travels along a beautiful mountain river.  But we’re hiking the AT! Not some crushed-limestone Nirvana that goes to the same place. It’s ups and downs for the likes of us!We arrived just after 9:30 and went directly to the 7 Trails cafe for coffee and their hiker special breakfast (eggs, bacon, sausage, two pancakes, biscuits and gravy, and a fruit cup) and then had some delicious banana pudding to round out the meal. $18 for the whole shootin’ match  Then it was off to the Broken Fiddle Hostel for laundry, showers, head shaving (just me) and a light resupply at the Dollar General down the street. Mid afternoon we went back to the 7 Trails for a beer and while I was there, Mark, a friend from high school, was texting with me and then he called the bar to buy me a beer (pic above). Trail Magic from Michigan via electronic payment to my hand - sweet! That really made my day. Later we had dinner at the Damascus Diner and it’s amazing the price difference between Virginia and the New England for a good meal. (I think I’m starting to sound my age. I won’t get into portions or early-bird specials).We’re hiking out early in the morning and will have to cover at least 19 miles due to camping closures from nuisance bear activity. It also looks like we’ll need to carry water up out of town as it’s very dry up on the ridges. If water cannot be found we may have to duck into the Rabbit Hole hostel for the night, but that decision will come tomorrow. We are planning to cover another 40 miles Sunday and Monday before taking a zero day on Tuesday at Boots Off hostel next to Watuga Lake.But for tomorrow we’ll be leaving Virginia behind and entering Tennessee.  11 states down, three to go!","Saunders Shelter

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642854,"After a slightly hot and stuffy night at the Broken Fiddle Hostel, Quiksilver and I were packed up and out the door just before 7 am. As luck would have it, the gas station/deli across the street opened at 7, so we able over there so Quiksilver could get a breakfast sandwich and a sticky bun. I’m back on the “breakfast is for nerds” bandwagon so I just window shopped. While we were outside eating and not eating we chatted with a local who was curious about our hike. Turns out the gentleman lived up in Michigan for almost 40 years working as a tool and die man before retiring back to Damascus where we was born. In chatting with him it also turned out he lived in Clarkston, Mi for many years about one half mile from where my friends Mike and Vicki live (cue the animatronic Disney characters).  Weird world we live in. We hiked out of town and began the climb up (they build surprisingly  few towns on top of mountains) from 1900 feet up to 4000 feet where we remained most of the day. About three miles up we came to the Virginia/Tennessee border and took the de rigueur pics at the sign post. Quiksilver pulled out the small painted rock made for him by a neighbor’s child that he had carried all trip and takes a photo with at every state line. Something he’ll only need to do two more times!Shortly after crossing the border I crossed paths with a FIOUS (Flying Insect Of Unknown Species) when it flew directly at my right eye and stung me on my eyebrow. I immediately dropped my trekking poles and exclaimed something along the lines of “golly!”, as it felt as if I had been hit on the head with a hammer. I suspect it might have been another yellow jacket, but can’t confirm that and I don’t wish to cast unearned shade in their direction.  But dang, it did hurt. Luckily there was no swelling (one of the benefits of having a swelled head is that it can only get so big…) and other than a few hours of pain, I was no worse for wear. Quiksilver and I hiked fairly close most of the day and both had carried out just shy of 4 liters of water due to dry conditions up on the ridge. Additionally, there is an 18 mile stretch south out of Damascus where camping is currently banned due to aggressive bear activity. We had pre-decided to hike 18 miles to the Double Spring Shelter and then figure out the rest of the day. Arriving a little after two we took a break and looking at the map, saw an unofficial campsite about 4 miles further on. Onward we hiked.  It was mostly downhill in this section and just before the campsite there was a good water source at a piped spring and we took advantage to fill up. Hiking to the site, we found a small clearing with a few hammock-ready trees and being a little footsore after 22 miles, I talked Quiksilver into calling it a day. But after some closer inspection, we saw several large dead trees that could potentially ruin one’s night or life. So in the grand tradition of this AT hike…we decided to go just a little further. The little further was another 4 miles mostly uphill to the Iron Mountain Shelter which made for a total of 26.3 miles on the day. A hiking marathon!  We covered the distance today in 10 hours all told, and yes, I’m feeling it. But this is a good shelter area and we are the only hikers here. This also sets us up for a “short” 16 miles into Boots Off Hostel where we have a planned zero day on Tuesday. We’ve got some pen and paper work to do as we begin to flesh out where we want to stop over the last 430 miles and what miles we’ll need to average to finish on our appointed date. I don’t think you’ll be seeing many days like this again, barring weather. But if we do decide to do bigger days we’ll have to schedule some more zeros as well. This is fine.It’ll work out as it works out and hopefully we can both stay healthy and injury free in the coming weeks. Hope everyone had a restful (or at leash interesting) weekend!","Damascus

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642892,"After another good night’s sleep in my hammock I woke to a still-shining almost full moon just before 6 am. I had a leisurely pack up and performed a little foot maintenance as I waited for the sun to come up at the shelter. Tennessee shelters have the benefit of almost always being directly on the trail (no .3 mile hike down a hill) but with the absence of privies, they have their own…challenges. Typically there will be a shovel at the shelter to help address…challenges, but you’re on your own when it comes to finding a suitable out of the way spot. If you’ve hiking after the ground gas frozen, it is recommended that you collect and pack out any challenge that you may produce. Anyway, Quiksilver and I were hiking by 7 and stopped just past our campsite to grab a little water from a small spring, as this would be the last water we’d see for 14 miles. With a depleted food bag and only two liters of water my pack was comparatively light for today’s miles. We had a bit of ridge hopping ahead of us with 50-150 foot ups and downs before heading down a bit to Watuga Lake.  Seven miles in I passed the Vandeventer Shelter where 4 section hikers were packing up and getting ready to go SOBO. I talked with them for a few minutes and learned they were heading for the same hostel as we were.  About a mile down the trail I was be-bopping along and was in mid stride when I heard a sharp rattle and before I even registered what I was seeing I had jumped backwards on one leg and said something along the lines of “GEE WILLIKERS!”  One step in front of me, lying directly on the trail with its head coiled in my direction was a 4-5 ft black timber rattler. It had only given that one, short warning to me, but thankfully - that was enough. It just stayed where it was without moving an inch. Quiksilver was in Quiksilver mode and had been well in front of me at this point.  I did a quick check above and below the trail - no corpse. This was fine. After my heart rate dropped back below 200 bpm I assessed the situation and my options. I banged my trekking poles together: no reaction. I moved a few feet  to my left and then to my right: no reaction. I grabbed a six foot branch from nearby and slid it towards the snake: no reaction. Ok then. I decided to go to my left uphill about 10 feet to move around the scaled obstruction, reasoning that if I tried going around it on the downhill side it might launch itself at me like in the movies (I really didn’t wish to see an example of life imitating art).  The snake never moved. Once I was past it and back on the trail, I naturally and understandably moved closer for some photos!  Then I waited, knowing that the foursome of hikers would be coming this way and not wanting anyone to get hurt, I stay and warn them. About 10 minutes later they appeared and I was able to give them a heads up, then I moved on.  The curious thing about seeing a rattlesnake on the trail is that everything you see afterwards looks like a rattlesnake as well: twigs, branches, dirt, rocks, weeds. It’s all snakes, man. The rest of the hike was thankfully uneventful - oh, I should mention I got stung again on the left shoulder just after breaking camp (sorry, Cheryl) and this can stop anytime now. But post-snake, the Watuga reservoir was twinkling through the trees on my left and the miles clicked on by. I arrived at Boots Off just after 12:30 having done the 16 miles in five and a half hours or so. I’ve got an 8x8 air conditioned cabin for the next two nights as we are taking a zero on Tuesday after completing 300 miles in the last 18 days. I may rent a paddle board or kayak tomorrow or I may just go for a swim at the lake 5 minutes away. I hope my dreams tonight are snake-free, and yours as well!","Iron Mountain Shelter

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643016,"I had intended to go to bed last night at 8:30, but instead headed to the deck area to play cards with Quiksilver and section hikers Goldbond, Polaroid, Lois and Clark - two couples out for a week of hiking who I had warned of the snake yesterday. We talked about hikes, trips, places we’ve lived while we played cards and just enjoyed a great evening with perfect weather. If there in one thing I hope to retain from the trail, it will be to keep enjoying the random and unplanned moments that can speed on by if I’m too glued to my own schedule. With nothing much on the menu for the day, i spent the morning reading and then the staff here at the hostel hooked me up with a foot basin and I grabbed some Epsom salts from the hiker box and had a good soak. *EXPLICIT CONTENT WARNING*. I did end up with two fewer big toenails than god gave me after a half hour soak. Had to happen. The blisters I got two weeks ago doomed them and now they can heal and regrow properly. This isn’t an unusual thing for hikers, but it is a little unusual for this to pop up after 1400 miles. I blame the pedicure. Around noon Quiksilver and I made the five minute trek downhill to Watuga Lake and found a nice shady picnic table to enjoy the view and the 88 degree temps. We had been there about 20 minutes when we noticed a minivan cruising through the parking lot with the sliding door open. The van parked and who should get out but Quiksilver’s neighbor James and his 5 year old daughter Ryan. They had made the two and a half hour drive from Charlotte, North Carolina to surprise Quiksilver and bring some trail magic. And what magic!  Pizza, salads, fruit, snacks and some beer!!  We had talked more than once about how we had likely seen our last trail magic back in Maine, as we were now way out of any hiker bubble. And lo and behold - some of the best trail magic of the hike finds us!  We spent a few hours at the lake as Ryan played in the water and we passed the time. What a great afternoon. Back at the hostel I had my resupply box waiting for me (can’t say thanks enough to my wife and my youngest for shipping these out to the trail) and once again I have far too much food. I also ditched my Katadyn water filter and changed to the Sawyer squeeze that most everyone uses out here. I’ve loved the Katadyn for it’s simplicity, but as the water sources have become more sketchy, the Katadyn just plugs too fast and then the bag leaks. So for the last 430 miles I’ll have a new system to master. My sister asked in the guest book if I’m feeling good about my decision to flip flop. Answer: I am. It’s been made better by having met Quiksilver and Iceberg way back in Vermont and getting a SOBO hiking buddy in Quiksilver. It would pretty lonely out here otherwise as I’m ahead of most of the flip-floppers and true SOBOs. As an example: we stayed at the Yellow Deli hostel in Rutland, Vermont and had 6 of us there. With the NOBO bubble up in the northeast right now, the Yellow Deli had 65 hikers there one day last week. I’m very, very happy I’ve stayed out of the mega crowds. We are hiking out in the morning to cover 34 miles to Roan Mountain, Tennessee and then we’ll have our noses pointed towards Hot Springs, North Carolina, hoping to arrive on September 2nd. But, as always, one day, one step at a time.","Boots Off Hostel

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643133,"After yesterday’s zero, we lingered a bit this morning at Boots Off in order to say “adios” to Lois, Clark, Polaroid and Goldbond and to get a picture with them before we all headed out. They had just one more day on their section hike before returning to their respective homes in California and Rhode Island.  It was a blast meeting them and shooting the breeze, it’s great to see friends like that out enjoying the outdoors. 


We left the hostel at 7:30 and immediately started the climb to the summit of Pond Mountain, which must have been Iceberg’s favorite place on the trail because he mentioned it more than any other.  I’ve heard some cynics describe the AT as a series of PUD’s (pointless ups and downs) and Pond Mountain has the reputation of being the PUDIEST PUD of them all. The old AT was a one mile road walk through here. The Pond Mountain reroute goes up and down 1600 feet in six miles and ends up at the sand spot as the old AT. Ah well. The trail is the trail. (Though I didn’t mind Pond Mountain at all, well except there is no pond at the top and no view either)


Anyway. 


With that climb behind us we started the longer climb along Laurel Creek that would take us up to 4000 feet. Along the way we saw Laurel Falls - which was awesome. One of the prettier waterfalls you’ll see with a wide cascade down into a deep pool. We took some pics there and then climbed the 300-some stone steps up and away from the creek.  On the way out we met a couple from Iowa who had a bucket-list item of hiking a part of the AT in all 14 states it traverses. I thought that was a pretty cool idea. I may steal it. 


Our next milepost on the day was a .3 road walk to the Kincora Hostel owned by Bob Peoples. Bob is a legendary trail builder in this area and he’s known for good switchbacks and clear tread way. I’m a fan. Unfortunately, Bob wasn’t at home when we arrived. We did talk with a hiker named Lion who was just leaving the hostel. Lion had spent the last 12 years living in monasteries in India and Nepal and is something of a guru now, hiking around the AT as he waits for Covid to domino. People do lead interesting lives.  


We had our sights set on the Moreland Gap shelter where we would decide how much to hike for the day. About two o’clock, clouds began to build and we could head thunder as well. Twice I saw lightning and based on the resultant thunder, figured the storm was two miles away. It hit with heavy rain when I was about 10 minutes from the shelter, so I got a bit of a soaking. We waited out the rain for half an hour, finally deciding to call it a day here and leave an 18 mile hike for tomorrow. 


Sadly, the frame on my backpack failed today. I felt the metal support jamming into my hip. On closed examination, it looks like the frame piece has worn through the fabric and will no longer stay in. I tried to sew up the hole, but the material proved too strong for my now broken needle. Not sure yet what I’m going to do. I don’t think my shoulders are going to enjoy 400 miles of a frameless pack. I’ll probably contact Zpacks tomorrow, though I’m not sure they’ll do anything  after 1400 miles of hiking with this replacement pack after my first one broke. We shall see. 



This’ll be fine  
Tomorrow will bring us to the Mountain Harbor Hostel where Quiksilver has a package waiting.

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643158,"Had a nicely bright night with the moon shining down all throughout. About 8 pm I heard a fairly large tree fall somewhere down the hill from where we were camped. This is always disconcerting. That makes the fourth tree I’ve heard or witnessed falling during my hike. I think I’m good now on both falling trees and rattlesnakes, thank you very much. We left out just before seven with 18 miles on our plate. Water sources appeared to be plentiful so I left with only one liter of water and no plans to carry more than that all day. With my pack a bit fubar, the less weight I carry, the better. Quiksilver lead out for the first two miles, but when he stopped to filter water I hiked on into the very, very spider web covered trail. I silk blazed for most of the next 10 miles, given one brief respite when a NOBO section hiker came past me, but he had only been on trail for 30 minutes. Boo. I got into a pretty good hiking groove and the miles went by smoothly. I stopped just around noon after 13 miles and took a short side trail to Jones Falls which was spectacular. It doesn’t have a high water flow, but it’s roughly 100 feet high and cascades down in fine sheets. Quite beautiful. Quiksilver caught me at this point and took lead for the last 5 miles to the road crossing near Roan Mountain, Tn. Just as we reached the road, it began to rain. Quiksilver had called The Station at 19e Hostel to see if their bar was open. The owner David said it’s always open for hikers. He even came to the trailhead and gave us a ride to his place a half mile away. We had some food and some beers as we watched the rain come down in sheets outside. After loitering for about an hour, we left just as the rain stopped and walked a mile to the Mountain Harbor Hostel where Quiksilver had a resupply box waiting and where he had booked us in for the night. This is a very chill hostel famous for their breakfast (with which we will be partaking on the morrow). After loading up in the morning, we’ve got a steep climb up into the Roan Highlands and elevations over 6000 feet. But that’s tomorrow, tonight I’m going to relax and do some reading before we throw ourselves into the next 120 miles.  We did pass the “400 miles left” mark today. Which is fairly hard to comprehend. I think it’ll feel more real when I get below 300 miles. One day at a time.","Moreland Gap Shelter

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643227,"Last night Quiksilver and I spent 15 minutes looking at the Guthook app, finding campsites and water sources, talking about resupply options and mile goals as we push 120 miles in six days over the Roan Highlands into Hot Springs, NC. We agreed on a tentative plan to accomplish this goal. This morning as I sat looking at the $13 breakfast that Mountain Harbor laid out for us, I turned to Quiksilver and said: “I think we need to slack pack today back to the hostel and eat here again.”  It took him about .3 seconds to agree and just like that we booked a second night and a shuttle ride out to the trail to make this new plan happen. I love being flexible!  Seriously though, the spread they set out for their guests (hikers and their B&B guests) would easily - EASILY - run $35 in your finer hotels and it’s be worth it. So, score one for the nerds, I got roped in. Now I also had about half a dozen sound rationalizations (you’re not the only one, Curt) that backed this decision to slack pack: We can stretch our food to Hot Springs and avoid paying for a shuttle resupply, this sets up the mileage nicely to do the 120 miles we planned, my broken pack has hurt my shoulder so a day of slacking would help, we’d lock in great morning weather for the hike over the Highlands, we’d reestablish NOBO cred, etc. But, truly, it’s the breakfast. After getting dropped off at Carver’s Gap at 9:30 we DID have awesome morning weather and views for miles and miles and miles. This section of trail straddles the Tennessee/North Carolina border and is breathtaking when the weather cooperates. We unhurriedly clicked off the miles, and after the last few days of “green-tunneling” it was nice to be out in the open air and sun. We did a side trail to the old Overmountain Shelter to take in the iconic red barn (closed due to structural issues) and the privy with no walls of roof but with a king’s view from the throne. We met a first time backpacker there who was playing his guitar well (not always the case!) and setting up camp for the day. I may or may not have partaken of the throne view, but the break was nice regardless. *Side Note*. The Overmountain shelter is named for the Overmountain trail which passes nearby which is named for the Overmountain Men who participated in a key revolutionary war battle. Look it up. It’s a heckuva yarn!We then had two climbs up Little Hump Mountain and Hump Mountain - two balds with more incredible views. It got pretty hot and muggy in the afternoon, but only carrying 4lbs of gear does wonders for one’s outlook. On the descent back down to Rte 19E Quiksilver placed a losing bet that we were going to get rained on.  So back at the hostel I enjoyed a free Two-Hearted ale - victory beer is sweet beer!Talked with some section hikers here at the hostel and someone who is actually a professional puppeteer who works on off-Broadway shows in NYC.  I may have mentioned this, but people do lead interesting lives. So come morning, I’ll Nerd it up to the max before hitting the trail once more, hoping to hike about 22 miles.The good lord (and cell service) willing, I’ll be back tomorrow night with another post from the trail.","Carver’s Gap

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643274,"After returning from yesterday’s hike, I recontacted Zpacks about my frame issue, as I hadn’t had an update from them in 24 hours. Their customer service rep responded that her “repair team” had been “in meetings all day” and I wouldn’t get an update until Monday. Hmmmm.  Color me suspicious. I emailed back that if the answer for assistance was “no”, just tell me, no worries. I didn’t get an answer before 5 o’clock Friday hit. Ah well. This is fine. 
The folks at Mountain Harbor dug up a travel sewing kit and after I ate and had a couple Two-Hearted Ales I set to work. The hardest part turned out to be threading the dang needle, which took me 15 minutes. Then I just started to stitch back and forth until the needle was too bent to continue (the frame strapping is thick stuff) then tied off the thread. There was a safety pin in the kit so I threw that through and taped it closed for good measure. If I’d had access to a hot glue gun or an acetylene torch, I would’ve used that too. 
After a second go at the fantabulous Mountain Harbor breakfast (to call it breakfast is really a disservice in a world where a gas station donut can be called the same) we got a ride to trailhead from section hiker Brad who was on his way back home to Wilmington, NC. Thus saved us $10 each, got us to the trail 20 minutes sooner, and gave us a chance to chat with him as well. Another helping of trail magic!
We climbed out of the gap and over Roan Mountain at 6200 feet, then we just set our sights on putting miles behind us and enjoying another near perfect weather day.  Temps were in the 80’s and it was a bit humid, but it's dry and the trail was as well. With so much good food in us, we only stopped twice for water until we reached the Cherry Gap Shelter after 19 miles of hiking. We had clicked right along, covering the distance in about 6 1/2 hours. After a 30 minute break, we decided to hike another three miles up 1200 feet to Unaka Mountain where there’s an unofficial campsite.
I did see deer today for the first time in 5 days, both times the animal had frozen at my approach, likely due to my music playing (Rage Against The Machine in heavy rotation - I’m fickle).  Strangely, we haven’t heard many birds over the last two weeks. Must be they’ve already moved on from the higher elevations. 
In other gear news my remaining hip belt pouch broke today (the other broke off 1000 miles ago) and I got my bear hang rock bag stuck in a tree (no one tell Iceberg, it was his).  So I had to cut the line as high as I could and execute a non-standard bear bag hang. I may wake up to a missing food bag. On the bright side, my pack weight would be 8 pounds lighter! (I’m such a Pollyanna).
After we had hiked 26.3 miles out of Damascus, I had thought our 20 mile days were behind us. But after today we still have three more planned over the next four days as we try to stay in front of the approaching hurricane and get to Hot Springs next week for a zero. 
One last interesting point: I mentioned earlier to my friend Mark that I was camped at 5000 feet tonight. He said that is 2 1/2 time higher than the highest point in Michigan.  Wow.","Carver’s Gap

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643315,"I forgot to mention a few days back that when I arrived at Mountain Harbor Hostel, the innkeeper informed me that she did not have enough guests booked to make their famous breakfast the next day. I feigned a stoic resignation while quietly dying inside and then she said that she was just joking and that four young hikers had been there that morning and asked her to play a joke on us and say “no breakfast”.   So congrats Polaroid, Goldbond, Lois and Clark: you’re ploy worked on me!


It got cold just after sundown last night as the wind picked up at 5000 feet. But around 11:30 the wind completely died off and it was soooo quiet up there. No tree frogs, no crickets, no flies, no bugs at all, no traffic sounds, no planes. It was creepy silent. At one point I looked off into the woods and saw a yellow light bobbing up and down. I stared and wondered for a few minutes if it was g one of those soul-stealing Native American ghosts that a “friend” (Daron) told me about - stalking through the woods in search of my liver. But being that the light never moved at all, I figured that it was a far off light on another ridge. So I went back to sleep - but I woke up and checked every once in a while. Can’t be too sure. 


I lit out ahead of Quiksilver at 7 am with the goal in my head of reaching Erwin, Tn - some 14 miles up trail - by noon. A few miles in I hiked through some formed pasture to a place called The Beauty Spot. It is mostly clear of trees and gives commanding views to the mountains and valleys surrounding it. Seeing the fog fill the valleys like a cotton sea was very pretty on this sunny morning. I stopped for 10 minutes to soak it all in. 



The hike down into Erwin wasn’t a straight descent, there were lots of little roller coaster hills to bob up and over before getting to the creek that I followed for the last few miles into town. I crossed the bridge over the Nolichucky river and crossed the street to Uncle Johnies Hostel at 11:58.

Uncle Johnies is another hostel known as a “trail icon” and though I didn’t tour it to attest to it’s state of cleanliness, I can tell you the staff was extremely hospitable and let me sit in the shade out front, charge my phone, and eat some food. I did buy two Gatorade’s, a Coke, a Klondike bar, and a new bear bag hanging kit in the 90 minutes I was there. So I was a customer! Quiksilver arrived about 12:45 and then I got back on trail at 1:30 for the long climb out of Erwin. 


I told myself I was going to take it easy for the afternoon as it was near 90 degrees with high humidity. But I rarely listen to my rational self, and went ahead and hiked the 6.3 uphill miles by 4 pm. I did meet three section hikers who were headed past me going down to Irwin. The last of which was weirded out that she had hiked over 7 hours and hadn’t seen anyone until she saw me. (And getting a look at me, undoubtedly became even more weirded out).


So another 20 miler in the books with either two or three ahead by Wednesday. It looks like (Tropical Storm by then) Ida’s path is just on the Tennessee-North Carolina border and is arriving Tuesday evening. We’re monitoring the storm and plan to be under a roof in Hot Springs come Wednesday night. Tomorrow promises to be another hot and muggy day as we’ve got 2000 feet of elevation gain ahead of us over Big Bald 11 miles out.

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643351,"Despite my misgivings, my bear hang survived the night unharmed and intact, though we discovered later that Quiksilver’s bag had a hole chewed in it by a rodent. It was very hot last night and for the first time on trail I didn’t put on socks or use my quilt liner all night. I did go all lazy-bones and hit my snooze twice and didn’t get up until 6:15. After getting packed up I just sat at the picnic table in front of the shelter and yawned for a while, finally plodding out of camp at 7:15. 
I wasn’t relishing the day ahead. There were three big climbs in the first 11 miles taking us up over 5500 feet at Big Bald and with the continued heat and high humidity I knew I’d be sweat soaked all day. There were no views from the first two climbs over High Rock and Little Bald, but the third climb over Big Bald delivered some great scenery. 
I had stopped halfway up Big Bald at the shelter and had some lunch. Quiksilver arrived shortly after I did and we checked out the water situation for the remaining 10 miles we planned to hike. Quiksilver got water at the shelter, I elected to gamble that I’d find water up trail and left out with 2/3rds of a liter. 
My gamble did not pay off. I didn’t find a useable water source for the next 4 1/2 hours. I rationed what I had left and just hunkered down to some hiking. I did pass two NOBO section hikers and exchanged a few words and trail intel with each (I’m continually impressed by the number of solo female hikers out here).  I also hiked down into Sam’s Gap with four day hikers who were completing a 13 mile round trip to Big Bald and back. Turns out two of them have hiked in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and we talked some Tahquamenon Falls trivia. 
Twice today I got the bejeezers scared out of me when Woodcocks exploded into the air from brush right by the trail. I’m beginning to miss the comparatively serene rattlesnakes.  I also had a conversation with a yellow jacket that landed on my watch twice, but did no more than threaten a sting. (By the way, it’s not just me: Quiksilver has been stung four times in the last few days).
Arriving  at the shelter about 4:30, I encountered a hiker taking a nap on the picnic table. It would turn out this was section hiker Crepitus (name for the sound your joints make when you get old) who hails from Saline, Michigan - which is just down the road from where my Father In-law lives. (I think - THINK - Saline is where my wedding cake came from.  If so, I think I should get some points for remembering that).  He, Quiksilver and I had dinner together at the shelter and chatted about gear and things trail.
I’m now hammock-bound and listening to a thunderstorm walk and talk it’s way by about 8 miles south of here. Kinda looking like we’ll be spending the next two days hiking in and around rain and thunderstorms from Tropical Depression Ida.  I hope that there is only limited loss of life for those in Louisiana who took the brunt of the hurricane. 
Tomorrow brings a few more climbs (but not the 5800 feet of elevation gain we had today) and some challenging trail as we aim to hike another 20 mile + day. At least my food bag is much lighter and this makes the miles slightly easier.

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643383,"I was out on trail hiking just after seven this morning, but the combination of the hills and clouds left it fairly dark as I moved out. The weather forecast called for rain after 11am, so naturally it began to come down at 7:15. This is fine. It’s not as if we expected to stay dry anyway and as long as your moving, it’s not so bad. I knew that as far as hiking days go, today would not likely be a memorable one as there were only two areas that might afford views and the trail was overgrown in spots (intel from Section Hiker). Quiksilver had a planned rendezvous 15 miles out where we’d check on the weather and plan the rest of the day accordingly. So I cued up an audiobook and just walked into the miles. The first big climb went up to an area named Big Butt. For reals. Big Butt.  My inner twelve year old was delighted by this.  I marveled at the one view afforded to me - a little hole through the crack in the trees. The trail up to the peak was a little hairy and downright stunk in places.  I liked Big Butt and I cannot lie. Go ahead, insert your own joke - oops! Didn’t mean to say quite that!Anywho…After stopping at Jerry’s Cabin Shelter for food and water, Quiksilver and I decided to press on another seven or so miles to the next shelter area. We reasoned that if the weather did turn violent overnight, being near a structure wouldn’t be the worst idea. I left out ahead of him just as the winds began to pick up. The trail climbed up and over Firescald Knob at 4500 feet and the wind was gusty and strong over the exposed bald. My hands were so wet I couldn’t unlock my phone to take pictures, the views weren’t great anyway thanks to the rain and mist.  The trail turned fairly rocky over the last 5 miles and I managed to roll my left ankle three times. Nothing horrid, just annoying.  I arrived at our target shelter just after four and did a hasty set up in the high winds, trying to beat the return of the rain. It’s very windy where we are with gusts over 35 mph. I’m a little nervous about my tarp set up in this kind of wind. I’ve retightened my tie outs twice and I’ll hope for the best. Also, previous campers here have said the mice defeated the bear cables and chewed holes in their food bags. So morning may tell a story on that front. Morning pack up will be in the rain as Ida passes through here tomorrow. At least the winds are expected to drop some after midnight. Tomorrow will be a long hike in the rain down to Hot Springs, NC. I’m really looking forward to a hot shower and getting some laundry done. I should also have a pair of new shoes waiting for me.  My current HOKA Speedgoats have about 550 miles on them and are showing the miles. We are now under 300 miles to go until Springer Mountain in Georgia.

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643451,"Quiksilver and I guesstimated that the wind gusts topped 50 mph last night up on the ridge, the wind finally blowing itself out at 3:30 am.  I was repeatedly awakened by my rain fly smacking the side of my hammock- this despite having the pullouts deployed for only the second time all trip. Still, I slept fairly well all things considered. My biggest issue was that I had to have all of my clothes inside the hammock (I have a ridge line mesh basket) so it was fairly odiferous.   I’ve become fairly adept at packing in the rain - in fact I usually pack up as if it’s raining even when it’s not. I got all of my dry gear stowed and the hammock packed up without incident and moved my backpack to the cover of the shelter and then went back to pack up the rain fly and tie downs. Quiksilver was at the shelter and had already retrieved his food bag and mine from the bear cables nearby. Wouldn’t you know it: despite the high winds and rain, some intrepid mouse had defeated all the varmint countermeasures, climbed the metal cable, chewed a hole through my food bag and ate the corner of my favorite flavor Greenbelly Meal Bar. I couldn’t even be angry. I have to tip my hat to the little guy, he probably caught grief from his mouse wife for going out in the storm like a fool, but he persevered and ate well. Kudos. We stepped out into the rain at 7:10 for the (nearly) 20 mile hike into Hot Springs.  There were three climbs on the day and as it turned out, all the rain we wanted. There were a few periods where it nearly stopped and there was just water falling from the trees. But for most of the hike it rained steadily. Everything I was wearing was still wet from yesterday, so any attempt to stay dry was pointless. I only avoided the deep puddles on trail but otherwise just sloshed through what was there. Strangely, though I was able to get my feet dry overnight, my hands never did dry off and I started the day with puckered hands and it only got worse. We passed a shelter just over 8 miles into the day, but neither one of us wanted to stop so we just accepted the role of grim and stony hikers and trudged on. Although it really wasn’t that grim. As I’ve mentioned before, I really like walking in the rain. There’s just this happy resignation that comes over me and I love listening to the water fall in the woods. All the hike, we never stopped for anything, not even water.  Quiksilver did snack as he walked but in a major feat for two fifty-somethings: neither of us answered the call of nature!Quiksilver kept egging me on by casually mentioning what we could get in town: beer, steaks, apple pie, coffee, Mexican food, dry clothes, ice cream. He was really shameless. He kept me out in front the entire time, whipping me figuratively with evocative thoughts of food and comfort. It worked. We covered the 19.5 miles by 2 o’clock. We immediately went to the brewery and changed into dry clothes. Then ordered burritos from the taqueria and went into the taproom for some suds. It was sublime. If you have to be soaking wet, it’s not the worst thing for it to be a day you’re heading into town.We checked into the Laughing Heart Hostel just after three after first stopping at Dollar General for this and that and Nilla wafers and milk (I’m a weak, weak man). Hot showers and laundry were accomplished and we're taking a zero tomorrow to get some chores done (I need a new food bag and pack liner as mine has sprung a leak).  Quiksilver’s wife Lamb’s Ear arrives later in the day to hike the next 35-40 miles with us up to the entrance to the Great Smokey Mountain National Park and Bear feeding trail. Turning in (and posting) late for me as it’s 9:30 right now.

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643515,"I slept better in the rain and wind two nights ago than I did last night here at the hostel. No particular reason that I could cipher, just put it down to the vagaries of the human condition, I guess. 
Quiksilver and I went to the Smokey Mountain Diner for breakfast and lo and behold - he finally found a place that served apple pie ala mode!!  He’s been on this kick since I got back on trail 450 miles back but had been shut out in every town we’ve been to and now he finally scores it for breakfast. What a triumph of the human spirit and a stirring testament to the power of faith and perseverance. 
Afterwards we killed some time at Dollar General while waiting for the Outfitter to open. We also wandered through an awesome small town hardware store and marveled at how much product they stuffed into a small, wood-floored store. There’s not much in the way of commerce in Hot Springs, but what they do have here is dripping with quality. 
Bluff Mountain Outfitters opened at 9:30 and we were perusing their wares at 9:31. I was in need of a new food bag to replace the one I had that was now sporting a giant mouse-chewed hole. I also picked up Nuun electrolyte tablets and some blister tape. Quiksilver filled out his list as well. I did forget to get a new pack liner as mine was leaking badly, leaving an inch of water at the bottom of my pack yesterday, but Quiksilver grabbed one for me later in the day. 
Back at the hostel we were able to avail ourselves of the clotheslines out back and got all of our gear strung up to dry. I taped three small pinholes in my rain tarp that hadn’t leaked yet, but better safe than soggy. Between my wet gear and the water that was in my pack I probably hiked in to town about 2 pounds heavy. 
Witnessed an interesting encounter just after noon when a man from New Zealand  stopped into the hostel. He had hiked the AT in 1981 and had stayed here at Laughing Heart. The new owner, Maria, took him up to the lodge to look through the old hiker logbooks that had been kept  by the previous two owners. The man - trail name Luigi for reasons I don’t know - was able to find the logbook he had signed 40 years ago. He was quite emotional, reading entries from four decades ago and remembering people he had met and hiked with. He said he has kept in touch with two hikers all these years. Pretty cool. 
Mid afternoon, Lamb’s Ear (Quiksilver’s better half) arrived and after she settled in we walked back to town and poked around again before heading over to the Brewery for dinner and some oat sodas. When we got back to the hostel, she offered her sewing skills learned as a surgeon to help me try and repair my pack. Zpacks had overnighted a sewing repair kit to the hostel and Lamb’s Ear stitched things up for me. Fingers crossed, it’ll hold for another three weeks and 275 miles. I really don’t want to buy another pack at this point. 
Tomorrow we’ll be climbing out of town, going from 1336 feet here to 4680 feet over Bluff Mountain. I’m curious to see how many hikers we meet over the next four days of Labor Day weekend. The weather looks promising.","Hot Springs, NC

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643592,"I woke today in no particular hurry to get packed up. I relaxed in my hammock for nearly 45 minutes reading and then had an unhurried 30 minute camp breakdown. It was nice knowing I’d have a short day to the hostel and that the trail would likely be kind. It was probably the latest I’ve actually left a campsite all trip as I started hiking a little after 8. 
First order of business was the 2.5 climb up to Max Patch - a very popular “bald” that had a road and parking lot just .5 miles from the summit. There was a bit of an issue here last year when scores of people were camping at the top and left copious amounts of trash and debris behind. Due to that, they have closed the area to camping for the next two years. Kinda hard to imagine that people don’t know that leaving your trash and unwanted gear just laying around is not cool. But, it happens frequently. 
When I got to the top I posted yesterday’s journal and then checked on the result of the Michigan State football game from Friday night (go green!).  The summit of Max Patch was a swirling mist with the sun occasionally trying to poke through. I caught brief glimpses of the surrounding area that would be blocked by the mists again 30 seconds later. It was very eerie and Hound-of-the-Baskervilles cool. After about 30 minutes, I moved on. 
I did meet about 10 or so day hikers and overnighters throughout the morning and passed on information about the Roaring Fork Shelter where we had stayed and some were heading.  I also talked with a family of five who were out backpacking for 3 nights. They looked like they were having a blast, the youngest (aged 5) most of all because he wasn’t carrying a pack. I have to admit, it’s fun being seen as a minor celebrity when people find out I’m thru hiking. Most will express curiosity about how much my pack weighs and if I’ve seen any bears. Some ask how I manage to do it and I say in all seriousness: no one hikes alone. The support of my family and friends has been  indispensable and all of the people I’ve met in towns and hostels make this possible. All I do is walk. 
At the top of the last climb I passed Quiksilver and Lamb’s Ear as they took a sit-down break. It was a little over 4 miles downhill to the road at that point and I went out in front. I had thought that the silk blazing would be done for the day as I had passed numerous NOBOs. 
I was wrong. 
About a mile from the road I walked right in to a massive Orb Spider web across the trail (HOW IS THIS EVEN POSSIBLE!!). It hit me in the face like a pie from a clown. Then as I reeled, the spider ran across my face and I stepped of the edge of the trail while spluttering and flailing about. Luckily a grabbed a tree as I pitched forward, but my momentum cause my water bottle to fly out of my pack another 20 feet downhill. I eventually managed to retrieve the bottle and about 27% of my dignity, then clambered back uphill and finished the hike. 
I’m in a pleasant little creek side cabin adjacent to Quiksilver’s with it’s porch over the actual creek as I write this entry. We were cautioned by the Hostel owner that there has been a “curious” juvenile bear that has been crossing the creek and climbing the deck at times. So best not to leave any gear outside and maybe skip the screen door and close the sliding glass one. 
Can do. 
Tomorrow Lamb’s Ear heads home and Quiksilver and I enter The Great Smokey Mountain National Park.  We'll bottom out a mile from here at an elevation of 1357 feet and then start the big climb into the park where we’ll hopefully go over 6310 feet later in the afternoon. It promises to be…fine.","Roaring Fork Shelter

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643577,"What a perfect hiking day today!  Temps were in the mid 70’s with low humidity and though there was a lot of climbing to do the trail was nearly pristine with few rocks and gentle grades. I left the hostel just before 8:30 and about 10 minutes behind Quiksilver and Lamb’s Ear and I had a “no hurry” mindset for the day. 


It seems funny to think “only 17 miles today” but that’s what was in my head all day and I was able to enjoy the walk and soak in a beautiful day in the woods. With the low humidity and temps near 70 I barely broke a sweat even though we had over 5000 feet of elevation gain. I could get use to this. 


I stayed behind but in sight of Quiksilver and Lamb’s Ear all the way up to the top of Bluff Mountain where they stopped for a well earned break. I continued on another three miles to the Walnut Ridge Shelter where I took five and had lunch. There were two section hikers there and I chatted with them for a while and learned they were from Ohio. Being that football season is here, we talked college football and bonded over our shared amusement at the continued hilarity of UofM football. Good times!



The last 5 miles to Roaring Fork Shelter was a combination of downhill then gradual uphill, again over excellent trail. I should also mention that water was plentiful today and the streams were running clear and cold. I was anticipating that we might run into some weekenders at the shelter being that it’s Labor Day weekend and this is the closet open camping area to the popular Max Patch bald. But there was only a couple from Columbus here (more shared amusement!) who are our hiking for a few days. So only 5 of us here tonight. We shared the picnic table and had our respective dinners and talked hiking and places we’ve lived (I don’t have much to share on that score).
Tomorrow promises to be another great weather day and we’ll hopefully have great views from Max Patch in the morning. Lamb’s Ear has hospital obligations and will only be hiking with us for two days. So Saturday will be another short day as we’ll hike about 16 miles to Standing Bear hostel right on the edge of The Great Smokey Mountain National Park where her car is parked. Hopefully we can get our Park hiking permits there and then enter on Sunday. We should be in Gatlinburg Monday afternoon as we scheme to enjoy the trail, see some sights, have some experiences, and aim for our September 23rd finish.","Hot Springs, NC

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643659,"Had a good night’s sleep right on the creek at Standing Bear Hostel with no snuffling bears on which to report. Quiksilver made some coffee in the hiker kitchen which was passable and I downed a liter of water as well before we headed out. Standing Bear has a mixed reputation with mixed reviews, it’s close to being a nice hostel but seems like it may stay “close” for a while. I’m glad I was able to get a private room for $40 versus sleeping in the bunkhouse for $25. 


Lamb’s Ear drove us the .2 miles to the trailhead (down with waking that doesn’t count!) and dropped us off as she headed back for home. We’ll be seeing her again in 18 days at Springer!  


It was time for us to gird our loins for a long day of climbing up into the Great Smokey Mountain National Park, knowing this would be one of the biggest elevation gain days for us on the trail. Quiksilver and I were both motivated and geared up for it and we talked about subjects various and sundry as we went up.


span class=""Apple-converted-space""> Arriving at the lookout - a lookout is different from a watch tower in that a lookout is a building that sits in the ground while a watch tower is a structure on top of legs, thank you informational sign - we had the place to ourselves and enjoyed the vista for 15 minutes. 


We then hiked on to the Cosby Knob shelter for a noon lunch break and were joined shortly by four section hikers. We got to talking and probably stayed a little longer than we planned, but it was a nice place to sit and relax. I lead out once we got back on trail 45 minutes later, but when I pulled over for a pit stop Quiksilver hiked on and the last I heard from him was the clanking of his coffee cup and then a sonic boom as he took off uphill. 


I remember way back in Vermont when Iceberg clued me in on “Quiksilver Mode”.  It usually engages on a long, steady climb when he gets the Eye of the Tiger and just flies uphill. I possess no such Eye - with me it’s more like the Foot of the Sloth. 


So I hiked the next two hours in my own plodding manner and took in some of the great ridge views as I went up to 6000 feet. At one point as I crossed a narrow spot there was sunshine on my left and misty clouds rolling up the mountain on my right. Very cool. 


In the National Park you are required to camp in designated sites only. No stealth camping or backwoods camping like you can do in the Shenandoah National Park. Covid has granted me one boon, though: up until this year AT hikers HAD to sleep inside the mouse infested shelters. The only exception allowed was if the shelter was at capacity. But they are allowing dispersed camping around the shelters during the pandemic. So it’s hammock heaven for both Quiksilver and I. 


Now I just need the bears to stay away.  The shelters have bear cable systems and tonight in addition to my food bag and smellables bag, I’ve also hung my backpack from the cables.  Hopefully there are no mice around here that have escaped from the circus and are eager to demonstrate their high-wire skills and chew into my gear. 


We may get some rain later tonight and in the morning, that’ll realism to be seen. We plan on heading out at 7am for a 15.5 mile day to Newfound Gap where we have a shuttle arraigned for 1 pm to take us into Redneck Nirvana: Gatlinburg, Tennessee.

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643678,"The rain started last night at 11:30 and came down pretty steadily until 4 am. The thing that I’ve found…different about hiking is that every campsite has it’s own sounds, even in the rain. Different trees, different rocks, different tree frogs. In this case: a different roof on the privy. When the rain dropped on it it made what I can only describe (as weird as it seems) as a snuffling sound. So I spent the hour between midnight and one trying to figure out what I was hearing. That mystery finally solved (ok, it’s not a bear) I got back to sleep. Quiksilver and I planned to hike out at 7 for the 15.7 mile hike to Newfound Gap where he had arraigned for a shuttle pick up for us at 1 pm. This did have me *slightly* on edge as you never know what the trail will be like until you actually hike it. There was a fair amount of climbing to do, though nothing like the previous day. We started out in the light rain and mist in a true Smokey Mountain morning. On a different day, it would have been a walk overflowing with views as for about three miles we crossed a narrow spine on the mountains with steep drop offs on both sides, North Carolina to the left, Tennessee to the right. As it was, we had a beautiful cloud walk. I checked our progress at 10 and we had covered nine miles in three hours. Slight edge gone!  Now I could throttle back just a bit as we had three hours remaining to cover the last seven miles. I stopped at 11:30 for a short break at the Ice Water shelter and there were two hikers still in the shelter having a lazy morning. Turns out, this was the only lazy thing about them. There names were Loco and Medicine Man and they are SOBO thru hikers that have covered the 1980 some miles from Katahdin to here in 84 days. They wanted to be the first SOBOs to Springer and will finish on September 13. They’re averaging just shy of 24 miles a day - off days included. Medicine Man had hiked a 50 mile day just last week to catch back up to Loco. They have hiked in so much rain that they resolved to stay in the shelter until the rain ended. Then they were going to hike 26 miles in the afternoon. They will hike the last 211 miles in 8 days to finish on the 13th. Amazing. I realized I had stopped for longer than I had planned and had just over an hour to hike the last 3.1 to the road. Off I went, passing day hikers on the downhill like it were a paying proposition. Quiksilver had reached the parking lot at 12:15 and I cruised in at 12:45 and we hopped into Neil’s shuttle for the ride down into Gatlinburg. Tomorrow is a zero day for us and I’m pretty sure I’ll have a few things to say about Gatlinburg!","Tri Corner Shelter 
",Newfound Gap,"Sep 06, Mon",15.70
Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643717,"So here’s the thing about Gatlinburg: it’s kinda awesome. As long as you’re fine with crowds, kitch, traffic, a bit more public smoking than the average town, slightly inflated food prices, tourist traps,  confusing street layout, and general sensory overload. Other than that: awesome!The biggest thing on the menu for today for Quiksilver and I was playing nine holes of golf in neighboring Pigeon Forge. We took a taxi over to the course this morning and we’re paired up with two guys from Argentina, of all places. Lorenzo is visiting on a three month tourist visa (he owns a golf course in Argentina) and his friend Antonio lives and works here in Tennessee. It was a nice sunny morning and no matter how poorly we played, we couldn’t change that (thank goodness). But we did have fun and it was a nice diversion on a non hiking day. It is interesting, last night we talked with a Romanian couple that just opened a food stall in town, got a taxi ride from a Russian immigrant with a booming cab business, and played golf with two guys from Argentina. In what is suppose to be Hillbilly Heaven in eastern Tennessee. Gatlinburg is an interesting place. So after doing the town thing - relaxing and eating too much - we have a short day planned for tomorrow as we have three days to cover the next 43 miles through the rest of the National Park. We’ll cross over Climgmans Dome, the highest point on the trail at 6612 feet. We’re getting a shuttle at 9 am back to Newfound Gap and the trail. We’ll have to wait and see if the Smokies will be smoky or if we’ll have some epic views.","Gatlinburg

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643740,"I enjoyed an unhurried morning at the hotel in Gatlinburg and even indulged with another shower after eating some Cheerios. Our shuttle driver, Mike, arrived at nine for the drive back up to Newfound Gap where we had left the trail on Labor Day. I was guilty of some slight miscalculations, having downed a Diet Coke, a can of Iced Tea, and four cups of coffee before leaving the hotel, forgetting we had a 45 minute drive ahead of us. The last 10 minutes of the ride were a little nerve wracking, but thankfully, dry as well. 


Knowing we had three days to hike the last 43 miles of the National Park, we elected to go light today and hike a mere 12 up and over Clingman’s Dome to Siler’s Bald Shelter. Starting out with a low mileage day proved to be wise because both Quiksilver and I each felt about 10 pounds heavier after a day and a half in town. Still, we hiked the eight miles up to Clingman’s in respectable time and though it was cloudy, we got some nice views from the observation deck. Leaving the summit, we knew we had checked off the “highest spot on the AT” box. 


We were also treated to sunny skies and nice ridge views for the the four and a half miles of the day into camp. We had the option of hiking another six miles if the the Siler Bald Shelter didn’t have decent hammock options, but once we arrived we proclaimed the area satisfactory. There are bear cables here to hand food bags and backpacks and the business end of a busted shovel to help excavate cat holes. 


While Quiksilver was down at this spring filtering water, three large Whitetail Does walked up to the shelter. The first one actually half ran until skidding to a stop about 30 feet from where I sat. We studied each other appraisingly and after a minute. mutually agreed that we would peacefully coexist. Then her two lady friends also came up and they spent about 20 minutes around the outskirts of the building. They seemed very interested in the grass that I had…watered earlier and the the three of them cleared that area in no time. Deer are cool. 


So shortly after departing back to the trail from Clingman’s, we also crossed over the “200 miles to go” on our flip-flop thru hikes. It’s beginning to feel real: the sense the the hike is nearing completion and that we have a little over two weeks to go. We both agree that we don’t want to over-plan the last 200 miles and artificially limit how far we hike. We’d rather hike 20 miles if that’s what feels good and maybe take an extra nero or zero day if we get ahead of schedule. The main thing is to still enjoy every day out here. 


Tomorrow we plan to hike just short of 18 miles, though we do have a few rather steep climbs on the docket including Thunderhead Mountain and Rocky Top. We can bail out to another shelter at 15 miles, but if I were a betting man, I lay money on the 18.","Newfound Gap

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643820,"I fell into a deep and restful sleep around 8 last night - a deep and restful sleep that lasted for almost an hour. Then we got hammered by a thunderstorm thrashing itself against the ridge we were on. The rain was pretty intense for about half an hour. At one point I saw a light over where Quiksilver had his hammock. I hoped we was ok, but there was really nothing to be done if he wasn’t, though the large shelter was at hand so I knew he had a refuge if there was a problem. The intensity of the storm started to lessen after half an hour and then settled into a soaking rain until 10. It kept raining off and on through 5:30 am, but once again, I stayed safe and dry in my hammock. 
When I got up at 6:30 the fog was heavy and thick. Quiksilver had already rallied out and was readying his morning coffee. (He too had stayed dry all night, his headlight was on to check for potential leaks when I saw it). I retrieved my pack from the bear cables (they recommend hanging food AND packs in the Smokies) and got my gear stowed away. It was relatively cold, what with the fog and winds, cold enough that I donned my rain jacket and kilt to stave off the chill. I headed out on trail at 7:30, still wearing the rain gear. 
The first third of the day was more or less downhill to the Derrick Knob Shelter. I met two NOBO section hikers in this stretch and we shared our stories of riding out the storm the night before. One of the hikers had only a small tarp for her backpacking trip, so when the storm hit she made a run for the Shelter and waited there for the worst to pass. When I arrived at Derrick Knob there were two more section hikers there. I was taking a short break and we chatted. I mentioned that I was hiking with Quiksilver and they wanted to know if that’s the same guy who’s been tagging all the shelters with his name. I said yes, yes it was. And wasn’t it a shame he felt the need to do so. 
Hiking on, the sun began to peak through the mists and it was slowly warming up. I took off my jacket, but I was looking so stylish and avant-garde in my kilt that I decided to just keep it on. There were two very steep climbs as you go up to Thunderhead Mountain at 5500 feet, though you are denied any views by the 10 foot tall rhododendrons at the summit. A half mile beyond brings you to Rocky Top and great views to the south, west and north. 16 months ago my wife and I had hiked up to Rocky Top from Cades Cove. I nearly didn’t make it at that time as it’s a tough day hike and I wasn’t close to being as tough my wife. I may be in slightly better hiking shape these days. 
Coming down from Rocky Top I passed half a dozen day hikers on their way up. One was a guy who thru hiked the Appalachian Trail in 1985. That blows my mind. I don’t know if I’ll be fortunate enough to one day celebrate the 36th anniversary of my hike, but I hope to. 
We arrived at the Mollies Ridge Shelter at 4 and after some scouting, found two doable hammock hangs. We passed over 2000 miles hiked today and that seems a bit unreal. Tomorrow we have a 13 mile day down into the Fontana Dam area where we’ll be staying at the Hike Inn Hostel. We have 14 days left on the trail and 177.7 miles to go.

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643856,"The winds really picked up last night, but in a strange way: there would be strong gusts followed by no wind at all. Then it would repeat. Luckily it did not rain and it was just windy. I saw a headlamp in use up by the shelter and then some talking. I looked at my watch and saw it was 6, so I figured Quiksilver was awake and talking to himself (he’s getting old, it happens, poor guy).  But then I heard another voice and saw two lamps, rechecking my watch I saw I had misread and it was actually 4 am (I’m getting old, it happens, poor me). 


Apparently a couple might hiked in to the shelter and we’re trying to set up camp at 4 in the morning. The dude walked over by the bear cables and succeeded in blinding me repeatedly being his bright white headlamp (most have two settings, white light and a red light - the red is so you don’t disturb others).  The two of them carried on a normal voice conversation for about 10 minutes before Quiksilver exclaimed from his hammock: “Could you keep it down?”.  They then proceeded to whisper for a few minutes before settling in to the shelter. 


I was able to go back to sleep, Quiksilver wasn’t so lucky. We both were packed up and hiking by 7:15, resisting the urge to talk loudly and stomp around, do unto others and that sort of thing. Sometimes my upbringing ruins potential fun. 


Six miles in we took the side trail to the Shukstack fire tower and climbed to the top of the somewhat rickety structure. We were treated with clear skies and 360 degree views of Fontana Lake and Dam and Clingman’s Dome. We spent about 30 minutes at the top of the tower soaking it all in. After the last week of Misty, cloudy mornings it was nice to have a clear and sunny one. 


We met quite a few hikers today, day hikers heading up to Shukstack and section hikers heading into the park for 3-6 days of hiking. We keep getting “congratulations” from hikers but are a little superstitious about accepting them when we still have a lot of miles to go. 


We cruised into Fontana Dam at noon and went around the closed visitors center (Covid) and I talked to a some folks on a motorcycle tour about the trail. How this happened is one of them was reading a sign about the AT and said aloud: “who would be nuts enough to hike 2144 miles?!?”  I stepped around the sign and said “it’s actually 2193 miles now and I’m just such a nut”. 


Half an hour later we reached the end of today’s hike at the Fontana Marina. We hitched a golf cart ride down to the water and I bought Quiksilver a birthday beer (today is his special day!) and we sat by the water until our shuttle arrived at 1pm. 


We’re heading into Bryson City for the afternoon to resupply and hit the outfitter and a restaurant. Tomorrow we’ll be slack packing NOBO back to the Marina and then back here to the Hike Inn hostel. I’ll see if I can find Quiksilver a birthday piece of apple pie while we’re in town. Then I’ll make fun of him for being older than me.

Nancy runs a great hiker hotel, doing laundry for us and taking us into Bryson City yesterday for dinner and resupply. She really excels at taking care of hikers and the Hike Inn is very clean and comfortable. This has been a great stay. 


Nancy dropped us at the trail head at 7:30 for our NOBO slack pack back to the Fontana Lake Marina. We had another glorious morning with clear skies and a bright sun coming up over the eastern mountain ridges. We had a steep climb up Jacob’s Ladder from Stecoah Gap, but we old guys (one of us older than the other) like a nice climb to start the day to get the muscles warmed up and stretched out. 


We had 13.8 miles ahead of us and the weather was perfect in the upper 60’s with low humidity, it was enough to make one teary-eyed. We met four section hikers from Indiana and Virginia who were out for a four day hike and chatted with them for a few minutes. We had great views into the Smokies from the top of a ridge and soaked in the atmosphere for a moment. 


I’m sure like many of you, Quiksilver and I spent some time this morning remembering where we were and our recollections of the 9/11 attacks 20 years ago. It seems like both a lifetime ago and just yesterday that the attacks happened. The simple heroism of those who ran towards the danger to help still humbles me two decades later. There are not many days where you can definitively say the world changed, 9/11 is undoubtedly one of them. 



The highlight of the day came on the last climb when we passed two other NOBO hikers. It took me a moment to place the faces, but it was none other than Inna Hurry and Inno Hurry (they actually are known as the the HMC now - Happily Married Couple) who I had last seen waaaaay back in Front Royal, Va back in April. They are still out on the trail working on their thru hike. They hiked up to Maine and then flipped down to Springer to hike north to their starting point in Daleville, Va. They have less than 600 miles to go and I know they’re going to make it. Good on them!Tomorrow we’ll go back to Stecoah Gap and go back southbound on the AT.

Quiksilver and I sat and chewed the fat with her for an hour, enjoying the cool evening temps and mountain air. We also enjoyed the state police ticketing motorcyclists driving like aggressive idiots all afternoon. Back the Blue!  The one down note from yesterday evening was watching Quiksilver struggle in the wake of his birthday on Saturday. He’s having trouble when going out to eat trying to decide if the early bird special or a regular menu item with the senior discount is a better deal. Tragic dilemma, you don’t want to make the call.  You really have to feel for the old fella.  Nancy drove us back up to Stecoah Gap at 8 so we could hike on. She really runs a great hiker hotel - she actually only serves hikers, not the general traveling public. Doing this as she has for 28 years, she knows hikers and what they need. She goes out of her way to make sure you have what you need and her thru hiker deal includes laundry and trips into town for food and resupply. And she’s super nice. Hard combo to beat!Back on trail, we had a 2000 foot climb up to Cheoah Bald over the first five miles. I have to say we did pretty well for one senior citizen and one middle-aged guy.  (Full disclosure: the senior citizen did reach the summit first.) There were great views to the south and East from the partially clear bald. Just before we had reached the top, we came across an apparently abandoned duffle bag sitting trail side. It's always a bit disconcerting to find gear on the trail or at a shelter. Why was it left?  Where is the owner?  Should we be concerned? Quiksilver called out a few times to see if the owner might be nearby or in need of help, but got no response. I can tell you, for the next mile I kept glancing back over my shoulder to make sure I wasn’t being stalked. As we started downhill, we passed to NOBO section hikers and as always, we were pleased to see them. Seeing hikers coming towards you means the spider webs will be cleared from the trail for a while. This is welcome!  I mean, great to meet people too, sure. But let’s remember what’s important!We arrived at the Nantahala Outdoor Center just after 1pm and it was a zoo. The NOC is right on the Nantahala river and is a center for rafting, kayaking, canoeing, scenic train rides, and a major AT crossing. We were able to get a room in the Dogwood Hotel for the next two nights. It’s a small room with two beds and shared bathrooms and common areas with about 9 other rooms. We will be taking a zero here tomorrow, as we try to balance hiking miles while targeting a September 23rd finish date in Georgia. Quiksilver and I are on the same page that we’d rather hike more miles and maybe take an additional zero versus limiting daily miles over the next fortnight. We’ll wait and see how it works out!","Stecoah Gap

His trail name is Salamander and he thru hiked the trail back in 1993 when he was 20. Turns out, he’s from Grand Rapids, Mi. We asked him lots of questions about life on the trail pre-cell phones and how they figured out resupply and the like. He also told us he took 26 straight zero days at Rusty’s Hard Times Hollow - wow!  I showed him pictures and videos from my stay at Rusty’s back in April. He said it really hasn’t changed much. As usually happens when I’m not sleeping in the woods, I couldn’t get to sleep until 11pm last night. This doesn’t bother me that much, but it will catch up to me when I get back to hiking. We had signed up for whitewater rafting today at 10am as a zero-day distraction and mosied down to the center after 9. They set us up with life jackets and had us watch an instructional video before getting on the bus for the 15 minute drive up to the drop in spot. Quiksilver and I shared a raft with a three person family who were on a short trip before their son goes back to college next week. The mom and dad were originally from Taiwan and i think if I hike another 5 months I might meet someone from every country on the planet. It also turned out our guide grew up in Ionia, Mi before embarking on a career as a river guide. Yes: I’ve met a lot of former Michigangsters on this hike as well. The trip we took was pretty tame with one class three area and one class two area but was fun nonetheless and there were lots of great views of the mountains rising on either side of the river. All in all, an enjoyable two hours on the water.I spent the afternoon catching up on my photo-video project as I hadn’t put together any daily summaries in over a month.  I also spent some time finalizing our hiking itinerary for the last 10 days (lord willing) of the trail.  It looks like we’ll need to take one more zero this coming Sunday, but will be spending the next three nights camping on the trail.  The weather is going to be turning rainy starting Wednesday, but temps above 4000 feet should be in the upper 60’s during the day and around 60 at night.  We’re both eager to get back hiking tomorrow and as you might expect when leaving a river/gorge area, we’re going to be doing some climbing.Thanks again to all of you reading along with me, it does mean a lot to me to know that you’re out there and I hope that I’ve been able to entertain you just a bit!","Nantahala River

We sat and drank coffee in the common area of the hotel with two firemen from Tampa who are at the NOC for a five day Swift Water rescue class.  The news was on the TV as we sat and talked, good googily moogily, I don’t know how anyone can watch the news first thing in the morning and still face the day. I’m not made of such stern stuff. Instead I made an intensive study of the stained carpet in the common room.  If that carpet could talk, it wouldn’t, it would just mumble “the horror…the horror” over and over again until put out of it’s misery by Martin Sheen (obscure reference alert).
We left the for the walk down to the trail at 8:15, knowing as we crossed the river that we were at the lowest elevation we’d experience the rest of the trail: 1727 feet. Today would be a big climb day as we went up out of the gorge with the fire tower on Wesser Bald as our first waypoint. Five miles in as we were still climbing we caught up to a hiker.

We knew he had been coming up behind us thanks to info we got from the shuttle driver who took us into Gatlinburg last week. Wicked cool to bump into yet another hiker still out here on trail from way way back. 
We hiked the next hour with No Bad, catching up on this and that. When we got to the 4600 ft Wesser Bald fire tower No Bad didn’t climb up with us, as at this point of his hike he’s not interred in taking one more step than he has to. Quiksilver and I spent 10 minutes up on the observation deck, I still can’t get enough of these high Mountain views!  After descending 800 feet to Tellico Gap we went back up 1200 feet over Copper Ridge.  No Bad dropped back on the climb as he takes a more deliberate pace on the uphills. 
We also ran into three trail maintainers from the Nantahala Trail club, based out of Franklin, NC.  They are out repainting blazes on trees, cutting in water diversions, and doing general trail and shelter work.  The AT is maintained by volunteers from many individual trail clubs along the way.  Each trail club has a section of trail they oversee with help from the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, an umbrella group that coordinates the entire trail.  We chatted with one of the volunteers as we took a break and I had lunch. Quiksilver is going to be joining one of the clubs as a volunteer once his hike is completed.  If I lived closer, I’d do the same.  
We must have passed 15 NOBO section and day hikers today which was surprising, as it’s a Tuesday. Still, with weather like this I can see why people are out hiking. We arrived at the Wayah Shelter just after 3 and decided to stop here for the day. No Bad got in at 4, but elected to hike another two miles to a campsite. We’ll probably see him again tomorrow sometime. 
After picking a hang site I retrieved my rock bag and line to prep my bear hang. This is the first time doing this in two weeks as we’ve either had bear cables to use or have been under a roof. There’s a slight chance of rain tonight and then some wet weather looks to be moving in Wednesday afternoon. Might have a stretch of wet feet coming our way.
We are planning on hiking out by headlamp in the morning to see if we can catch a sunrise on top of Wayah Bald about a mile ahead and 700 feet up. Not sure if the weather gods will cooperate, but we’ll do our part and be there if there’s a show to be seen. 
Nine days to Springer!","Nantahala River

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644103,"We were up well before dawn with the plan to hike the mile up to the Wayah Bald Tower to try and catch the sunrise from the observation deck. Our plan worked, as the clouds and rain held off long enough for us to spend an hour at the summit, watching the sun slowly reveal itself and light the sky on fire. What an incredible start to the day. 


Hiking away from Wayah, Quiksilver and I slowly separated and did our own thing. We generally have a pre-selected rally point anywhere from 12 to 15 miles up trail where whoever is in front will stop and wait for the other. We do this just to make sure that if one of us has an issue, the other isn’t too far ahead. Today we picked the Rock Gap shelter as our rally point. We met two more trail maintainers there as they did privy work and then we decided to stay on-plan and hike another 4 miles to our target shelter.



This was one of those hiking days (after the sunrise) that was pretty monotonous and low energy. Not everyday is filled with “wow!” moments or hiker-highs. It’s on days like these that I need to mindfully appreciate the trail. It’s still amazing that I’ve been blessed to attempt this thru hike and that I’ve managed to avoid major injury. Getting the opportunity to meet other hikers and members of the trail community is always rewarding. I met 6 different hikers today doing NOBO section hikes that started at Springer, and each conversation I had recharged my batteries just a bit.
We rolled into camp a little after two, normally it was a bit soon to call it a day, but with rain moving in we took the opportunity to set up before it got wet. Finding a tree to do a bear hang was difficult but after nearly maiming myself by knocking over a dead tree, I managed to find an adequate tree limb for the purpose. I was done with dinner by 4 and hung my food and smellables.  A short while later No Bad made it in and he told us he’d booked a bed at the Around the Bend hostel in Hiawasse for Friday night. So we’ll get a chance to perhaps go out to dinner with him before he moves on to his planned summit day of the 12th. There are six other hikers here besides we thru hikers as we all listen to the falling rain. 


Tomorrow we are hoping to do our last 20 mile day and hike to the Muskrat Shelter. That would leave us with a short day Friday into Hiawassee and a chance to dry out.  Early Thursday morning we’ll cross the 100 miles to go mark. This is fine.","Wayah Shelter

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644133,"The rain started yesterday evening at 5pm and it rained steadily all night. My tried and true hammock set up kept me warm and dry and well rested. I rallied out at 6:30 am and all of my packing practice paid off as I was all buttoned up at 7. The rain had let up by then and we waited for sunrise before heading out.
We immediately started up Albert Mountain, a nice way to warm up on a chilly morning. Two miles in I passed the “100 to go” mark and took a moment to reflect on that fact. It’s a bit overwhelming. Like many things in life, sometimes it seems like I’ve been out here forever and sometimes it feels like just yesterday I was being dropped off by my friends Jason and Tony outside Troutville, Virginia. 


Sadly, the last fire tower I’ll pass on the trail was atop a socked-in Albert Mountain, so no views to be had. The 400 ft descent off the mountain was a steep and rocky trail that was like walking down a hill of live snakes. I was super paranoid that I’d fall after just going sub-100 miles. I took my time and didn’t take any chances on the rocks. 


Shortly after it began to rain and continued to do so for the next 90 minutes. As you faithful readers surely know: I love walking in the rain. Yesterday was a bit of a blah hiking day but the rain today recharged my hiking batteries and I had a blast. I was in no particular hurry, but the miles still piled up almost effortlessly. 


I took a short break at the Cooper Gap shelter around 10:30 and had a bite to eat. I had a bit of an audience as o noticed two mice sitting on the ceiling crossbeam, watching me eat my s’mores Probar. Just after leaving the shelter I passed the second milestone of the day as I went over 2100 miles hiked on the AT. That number is also a bit daunting. I still vividly remember when I hiked my first 10 miles and realized I was .45% done. Reality is sinking in. 


Continuing on, the trail began the long ascent up Standing Indian Mountain, which was our third milestone of the day: our last 5000-footer. There were several blow downs on the trail and it was overgrown in spots, but trail crews have been out clearing weeds the last few days. Because this area is in the Southern Nantahala Wilderness, power tools are not allowed. So all weed-whacking must be done with scythes. I applaud the efforts of the volunteers out here, it’s not easy work. 


I caught up to Quiksilver near the summit of Standing Indian as he chatted with a section hiker. Once past the summit, we blew by the shelter where we had planned to rendezvous and hiked on another 5 miles to the Muskrat Creek Shelter, arriving just as three NOBO section hikers walked in. For a change, they weren’t from Michigan but were from Quiksilver’s hometown of Charlotte, NC. We spent a pleasant hour or two with them taking trail while everyone ate dinner. A short while ago No Bad arrived as well. He’s staying at the same hostel as Quiksilver and me tomorrow. 


We’ve got another milestone in the morning as we’ll be crossing the North Carolina - Georgia border and entering our last state!  It’ll be a “nero” for us as we have only 12 miles to the road at Dick’s Creek Gap and then a half mile road walk to the Around The Bend hostel outside Hiawassee, Ga.  


It’ll also be my last Friday on the trail!  Yikes!!!","Long Branch Shelter

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644178,"It was a dark and stormy night.No, not a hackneyed opening for a horror story, just a straight news report about last night. The rain started again around 8 and was steady until about 5 am. I roused a little after six and executed another successful wet pack up by 6:45. Then we milled around the shelter and waited for enough light to begin hiking. Had another pleasant chat with the boys from Charlotte and wished them well on their section hike. Shortly after hiking out the rain began again, but the “green umbrella” - so named by Quiksilver - kept the worst of the water up in the forest canopy and we dealt with the drips down below. We were cloud walking once again, so there were no sweeping vistas to take in, just lush, green, soaking wet terrain. I had donned my hiking kilt to reduce some of the hiker-car wash affect from the overgrown trail sections. Once again, I looked quite fetching. We had a relatively short 11.8 mile day planned but with plenty of moguls and PUD’s to grapple with. We hoped to knock out this section by noon and then walk the half mile to the hostel. I happened to check the Guthook app at 10:30 and saw we had exactly 3.1 miles to go - a 5k!  I got a little fired up and decided to try and finish in less than an hour.  I activated my version of “Quiksilver mode” and started hoofing it. We still had two climbs to negotiate, but I had a purpose. Off we went. And got to the road at 11:25. Pointless victories are my specialty!We walked to the Hostel Around the Bend (Quiksilver still insisting on walking on the wrong side of the road) and within 30 minutes I had showered, had my clothes in the wash, and a frozen pizza in the oven. This is a really nice place with great owners. We’re going to town shortly for resupply and hit a restaurant and then back here for the night. We plan on an early start tomorrow for the 17 miles we plan to hike. Like pumpkin spice this time of year, we’ll have more unwanted moguls to contend with.  This is fine.","Muskrat Creek Shelter

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644280,"Had a great night at the really well run Hostel Around the Bend. The owners Lisa and Gordon just opened it this past February (it was formerly called Top of Georgia) and they’ve done a fantastic job remodeling and refreshing a tired property. And it’s not just a nice place, they are great hosts who really like what they do. A great combination!I was up at 5:45 to drink too much coffee and repack after drying out some gear. I even went crazy and ate breakfast of a sort - three Skippy Peanut Butter individual squeeze packs. Bring on the day!  Lisa gave Quiksilver, No Bad and I a ride back to the trail at 7:30 and we were toes-south and ready to hike. I had looked at the trail profile last night and it had Quiksilver-mode written all over it. Nothing gets his blood running like a long, steady, steep uphill. He was already champing at the bit when we got out of the car. (Obscure reference warning) I felt like The Humongous holding Wez on a chain and as soon as we hit tree line, releasing him to wreak havoc. We wished No Bad well on the last leg of his hike.  Quiksilver was off like a shot. I made a miscalculation by trying to keep on his heels, it only makes him go faster!  I need a more sedate start to my day: one can’t just jump straight into plodding, one needs to sluff along a bit first. We had four peaks to climb, the third being Tray Mountain at 4398 feet. Halfway up Tray I caught up to and lasted two day hikers who were treating some flash-burns from Quiksilver blowing past them. I commiserated for a moment, then pushed my sweaty-self onwards and upwards. We had planned to meet near the top of Tray and decide if we should move up our 3pm shuttle based on our progress. When I got to the top of Tray: no Quiksilver. He had gone by in a blur. I did finally manage to catch him just past the summit when he stopped to chat with a woman who is planning a 2022 thru hike. We had gotten over the top at 11:30 - some 12 miles. So we contacted our driver and moved up our pickup to 1:30.  I have to tell you: I felt like a hiker today. We were both in a grove and just chewed up at mileage today. We talked about how fortunate we both are to still be physically fresh and mentally engaged with only a few days left in our hike. Today’s hike was AWESOME. I continue to feel fortunate to have this opportunity to hike and I’m enjoying every single day out here. John the shuttle driver collected us and drove us to our hotel in Helen, Ga. Helen is a small German-themed town whose big draws are tubing on the Chattahooche River and fake Alpine architecture. It’s actually a cool little town and they have Oktoberfest weekends all September and October. We’ll take our final zero here Sunday, enjoying some beers and food. My cousin Lee and his wife live nearby and are coming to town tomorrow to have lunch with us. How cool is that?I’m hoping to post a rather longish entry tomorrow.

Quiksilver and I had a nice evening enjoying the Oktoberfest atmosphere here in Helen and watching tubers get caught on the rocks in the river. A surprisingly high number of people don’t seem to understand the fundamentals of physics or Newton’s Laws of motion. But this lack of working knowledge sure does make for solid entertainment!


Had some great trail magic today as my cousin Lee Feldpausch, his wife Carol and her mother drove 90 minutes from where they live in Ellijay, Ga to meet us in Helen for lunch - and they graciously picked up the tab!  We spent about two hours with them eating German food, talking home remodeling, family, trail stories, various wildlife encounters, and what to get for dessert.  I hadn’t seen Lee in quite a while, but it was great caching up and it was a great way to spend time on our last off day.  What a treat!After they headed home, we returned to our hotel to watch some football and I did one more pack shakedown, removing a few pieces of unneeded gear - like two water bottles.  We’ve got our resupply done as we head out for the last stretch of trail.  There’s a lot of rain in the forecast through Wednesday but we’re still exited to get back to it.I continue to feel a tremendous amount of gratitude for everyone who has made it possible for me to tackle this endeavor. My wife for her support and understanding and patience with me when we discussed this AT thru hike and her continued unconditional love.My three children for their humor and supportive messages and excitement in cheering me on.My parents for their weekly Sunday call and the Marriott Hotel points!Sister Sherpa (Laura) for visiting me in New Hampshire and slack packing me all over the granite state.My brother Dennis and his wife Dee for seeming to know when I needed a phone call.My brother Tom for sending me trail related news clips and drafting my Fantasy football team.My niece Rachel for the cool Mt Washington magnet.Lee, Jason, Stephanie, Tressa, Sam and all my wife’s family who have all been supportive from the start.My friends Mike and Jason for hotel support, LOTS of food delivery, and generally keeping me in line.  Also Jason for driving 27 hours over two days to pick me up in Maine and help me get back home to surprise my wife.Adam, Elaine and Sam Howell - knowing you’re out there and reading kept me fired up and motivated.Easy, for his Inadvertent New Jersey Challenge and leaving me a surprise package at the last New Jersey road crossing.I’ve got more people to thank, but I don’t want to totally jinx myself!  So I’ll have more to add over the next few days.In the spirit of Oktoberfest…PROST!","Helen, Ga

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644345,"So after a night of very weird dreams involving floods, bus journeys, faceless creatures emerging from a bubbling pool, shrieking monkeys, and a fully clothed young Morgan Fairchild, I awoke at five and began going over mental checklists preparing for our 8 o’clock shuttle. (Seriously: you people who don’t remember your dreams, count yourselves lucky. The subconscious is a dilly)We went next door to The Huddle House for wake-up type food and then returned to the hotel for too much coffee. As I’ve probably already said, I’m glad we picked a finish date of September 23rd about six weeks ago. It’s enabled me to not just focus on the end, but to enjoy the journey towards the end. We’ve still been able to hike in a satisfactory way (in other words: more than 12 miles a day) without going too far the other way and getting burned out with day after day of big miles. Both Quiksilver and I are ready to get to Springer. Our shuttle driver John was right on time and had us back up the mountain to the trail at 8:30am. We knew there was very heavy rain in the forecast for the next 60 hours (as of this writing flash flood watches have been issued) so we had a plan but were ready to adjust when needed.  Out of the gate we had an 1100 foot ascent up Blue Mountain and right on cue at 8:45 it began to rain. It rained with authority, passion, and purpose for the next four hours, turning the trail into a series of creeks and ponds. I wondered at times if I was hiking the AT or swimming the English Channel. It was a day to release my inner six year old and just tromp through any puddle I saw. I was soon covered from shoes to knees in mud and leaves.  With the rain, temps in the low 60’s and strong winds it had turned into a miserable weather day, and it was totally fantastic!  A true “This Is Fine” test case. As long as I kept moving I knew I’d stay warm enough, though one of the hikers I crossed paths with told me I was nuts to just be in a t-shirt and shorts with no rain gear. Quiksilver and I planned a rendezvous about 10 miles in at a shelter .2 miles off the trail. I arrived a little ahead of him and then we took counsel on what we’d do next. The original plan was to hike 17 miles to a campsite, but seeing as we were both soaked through and cognizant of potential hypothermia, prudence dictated we go to a shelter area at mile 14. (How Prudence came to be at the shelter is mystery - HEY-OH!!) we reasoned that having a structure at hand if hammock disaster struck would be wise. It would also allow us to eat and get organized as needed out of the rain. As luck would have it, the rain abated once we got to the 1.2 mile side trail to the Whitley Gap Shelter. I know, I know: two side trails in one day? Are we even thru-hikers anymore?!?  Once at the shelter we took advantage of the lull in precipitation to quickly set up camp, get water from the spring, change clothes, and eat. By 3:30 my teeth were brushed, my food bag was hanging from the bear cables, and I was tucked into my hammock-cocoon ready for a nap. So instead of a 14 mile day tomorrow, we’ll hike 17 instead including a visit to Neels Gap and Mountain Crossings Outfitter (the trail goes THRU the building) and then our last big climb up our last 4000-footer: Blood Mountain. We’re ready for a night of wind and heavy rain and another two days of hiking wet.

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644380,"Man oh man, did it rain last night. It started at 3:30pm and didn’t let up until 8 o’clock this morning, varying between steady rain and downpour. I’m happy to once again report that I stayed warm and dry for the duration. I’m sure this has involved some mix of luck and skill (heavy on the luck) for me, but it’s allowed me to meet my goal of not having to sleep in a shelter during my hike. Huzzah!
I didn’t exactly leap out of my hammock this morning, hoping the rain would abate but this was not to be. So I got up and at it at 6:45 as Quiksilver and I had planned to leave at 7:30. I was only a few minutes late and we took the 1.2 mile trail back to the AT and were SOBO a little after 8:00. The rain stopped about 9 and for a change the weather forecast for the day was incorrect: the heavy rains never came all day and the sun even made a cameo appearance after noon. 
I’ve been surprised by the number of section hikers we’ve seen in Georgia, but apparently this is a very popular time for section hikers to start from Springer and get some miles of trail done. Today I saw another dozen or so, undeterred by the weather (though not happy about it!). You can usually spot a section hiker because they still have a little more gear than your typical thru hiker - though I’m not judging!
We hit Neels Gap where the trail goes right through the Mountain Crossings outfitters. There are many pairs of shoes that have been thrown up into the tree in front of the building by NOBO hikers who quit the trail at this point. We went into the store and I had a hot pocket and two cups of coffee. Aaaahhhhhh…. The guys at the outfitters were very accommodating and just great to talk to. Naturally, one was originally from Michigan and had actually worked as a phone installer years back for the blueberry farms around Holland. I’ve come to the conclusion that 1/3rd of the people in the US used to live in Michigan.
We headed back out just before noon and with a climb up Blood Mountain - which has quite a reputation from NOBOs as it’s the first 4000 footer on the trail. For us, it was just another 1300 foot climb (slight brag) and our last mountain before Springer. We fairly cruised over the next three hours to Woody Gap where we were getting picked up by Above The Clouds Hostel. 
When I got to the parking lot I was happily stunned and surprised to see Iceberg walking up to me!  He drove down from Cleveland to hike some of the last miles with us and finish with us at Springer. I can’t tell you how happy I was to see him and how fired up I am that he’s going to finish with Quiksilver and I and see the end of our hike like we were able to experience watching him finish at Katahdin. I also got to see Iceberg surprise Quiksilver as he arrived at parking lot and the smile on his face was priceless.
So the three of us are staying here at Above the Clouds Hostel tonight and then Quiksilver and I will hike about 17 miles to a shelter 3 miles from Springer. Iceberg will meet us halfway and hike 10 miles and then hike with us up to Springer Thursday morning. So very, very cool.","Whitley Gap Shelter

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644443,"Had a great last off-trail night at the Above the Clouds Hostel in Suches, Ga. Lucky and Nimrod own the place and though they’ve only been open a year, they have it all down pat. Nimrod hiked the AT for the first time 45 years ago and possesses a wealth of knowledge about the trail and the hiking community at large. I got a bed, shower, laundry, stories, dinner and breakfast for $60. We also talked with five women who are section hiking thru Georgia on a program run by the hostel. I’d highly recommend it to anyone who wishes to dip their toe into hiking, backpacking, and the AT. 


So this morning I was unusually relaxed as I packed up to leave, normally I’m a bundle of nerves for reasons unknown. Not today. I was looking forward to my last full day of hiking and the downpours forecast for the morning hours. Quiksilver and I got a shuttle back to the trail from Nimrod at 8:15. Iceberg was taking a later shuttle and planned to get dropped off and meet us about 12 miles up trail. He’s allowed: his thru hike is complete and he hiked this section last year. So he’d instead hike the last 5 miles today with us and then hike the final 2.8 miles on Thursday.


As forecasted: the rain started right when we began hiking and would continue for the next four and a half hours. At times it came down in buckets and the trail became a ruddy, bloody, muddy quagmire. The good news was once your feet are soaked thru, any pretense of avoiding the puddles goes out the window and it’s STOMPSTOMPSTOMP through everything.  We crossed two rain-swollen creeks running chock-a-block above Norman levels, the second of which required a knee-deep fording. This is fine. 


We reached the Hawk Mountain shelter just before one and found a shivering Iceberg huddled inside. After a 30 minute lunch break the three of us headed out for the final 5 miles of the day. It was like old times up in New England as the we hiked and talked. We took a side trail and to see the Long Creek Falls and then shortly after passed 45 Army trainees and their instructors on maneuvers in full combat gear, as the trail runs right next to the base where Rangers and the 10th Mountain Division train. Man oh man, did they look young. 


We reached the shelter at 3:30 and set up camp for one, last, time. We then sat and ate dinner (I ate waaaay too much because stoopid Quiksilver was making fun of me for potentially finishing with food in my bag. But I still couldn’t eat it all. Now I’m going to have to have stoopid breakfast in the morning).  Lastly we each had a celebratory beer that Iceberg had packed out from the hostel. This was more than fine!


Having Iceberg here at the end is very special and I’m happy he could make the trip - though seeing him in a blue shirt instead of the threadbare red shirt that was his trademark is a bit disconcerting. When I took of my soaking wet socks and sock liners I put right into my trash bag due to the holes in them. I got one last blister today thanks to that. Tomorrow I’m hiking in my sleep-socks. Everything is stored for the night (food in a bear box, pack hanging from a bear cable) and it’s just one more night until this journey is at an end. 


I’m actually at a loss for words. 


We’re planning to head out at 7:30 as my wife Jessica and Quiksilver’s wife (Lamb’s Ear) and parents are going to be at the summit of Springer Mountain at 8:30. I’m so exited to see Jessica and while I’m sad the trail is at an end, I’m looking forward to being back home soon. 


I want to add to my thank you list:


Patricia and Michael for hosting me for 8 days up in Hanover, New Hampshire and making me one of the most fortunate hikers on the trail. 


All of the thru hikers I met who always had a kind word of encouragement to share. 


Bonsai in Uniontown who shared his hospitality and genuine Christian spirit  at a time when I really needed it. 



The innumerable section-hikers whom I encountered - their perseverance is inspiring.

Lynn in Lehigh who made me laugh with her motivational words and her kind comments in the Guest Book.


Everyone who took a moment to drop me a line either by the Guest Book, text, or personal message passed along by another.

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644462,"So I’ve decided to end my AT thru hike attempt, it’s just not worth the effort after all. 
Ok, maybe not. 
I spent one last night in my trusty hammock and delighted in the mid-40’s temps. Other than a few bursts of machine gun fire from the Army base around 10, the night passed quietly with no Morgan Fairchild bus driving hijinks to disturb my slumber. I even got a chance to practice breaking camp by the light of my cell phone, having discovered the night before that I left my headlamp at the hostel. This is fine. 
Iceberg, Quiksilver and I were packed and ready for our planned 7:45 departure, though truth be told I was pretty cold and kinda-sorta got us all on trail a little early at 7:30. Jessica, Susan and Quiksilver’s Dad and step mother had all stayed at the Amicalola Lodge Wednesday night and were departing for the hour drive up to the Springer parking lot at 6:30 - then they’d hike the one mile to the summit. 
It was cold and misty as we got on trail, it was still wet and muddy but the rain had stopped yesterday afternoon and things were a bit more dry. We covered the 1.8 miles to the parking lot in about 40 minutes and then decided to wait there for 20 minutes or so to allow our families time to get to the summit. 
Hiking this morning, it felt like so many other mornings over the last five months, but I knew it the ending would be so very different. As we approached the summit, Quiksilver said: “We’ve hiked over five million steps, only 1000 more to go”.  That really hit me hard. There is no other way to do anything than one step at a time, but looking back on those steps it seems almost monumental.  But I reflected that getting here was just a series of daily decisions to keep moving forward. That, and a large dollop of good fortune. 
With less than .1 miles left, Iceberg went on ahead to let them know we were near and Quiksilver and I came on up. I was hoping to have an “Officer and a Gentleman” ending, but Quiksilver and I kept arguing over who got to be Debra Winger.  Then we were going to be Batman and Robin (finally, a chance to use my purple tights!), but then Iceberg had to show up and ruin that. We were left with simply finishing as three friends.  Stumbling into the not-so-great Kid Gore shelter on a stormy Vermont Afternoon and meeting those two yahoos turned out to be the most fortuitous event of my entire hike. My growing list of “thank-you’d” wouldn’t be complete without including the two of them for their friendship, camaraderie, and tolerance. 
Then, we were there. A nondescript mostly tree covered mountain in Northern  Georgia.  And just as we arrived, the sun burned through the mist and there was blue sky above. True story! Seeing my wife there along with the others and with Iceberg and Quiksilver is what made it such a special morning, not the miles. We celebrated and took a ridiculously awesome number of pictures. Susan had banners made for the three of us and Quiksilver and I got our “summit” pictures. I signed the log book with a “Sev wuz here” and we took a few more pictures. Then it was time to head back to the parking lot for the drive back down to the lodge. 
After cleaning up, we met in Richard’s (father to Quiksilver) room on his patio and had a champagne toast before having lunch together. The party broke up at two as we all had some driving ahead of us and we exchanged “see you later”’s before hitting the road. 
I do have more to say about my AT hike (shocker, I know) and plan to have two or three more posts over the next few days, if you’re interested in that kind of thing.

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646410,"Hello to anyone still randomly checking in to see if I would ever post again!  I know this is just a tad overdue (I was never good at doing anything in college without a panic-inducing deadline - I once wrote a 26 page term paper pulling a 16 hour all-nighter, research included) but I did want to prove my friend Tom G wrong...
So, first - a quick life update:  On the drive home from Georgia back at the end of September, my Wife and I finally decided to do something we had been contemplating for about three years.  Namely, sell our house in Michigan and move to Tennessee to be near the mountains.  This was a very difficult decision for us to leave family and friends and strike out into the unknown, as middle-children we have not been known for bold action, but the time just felt right. Moving further from our respective parents and two of our kids has been a tough one and saying goodbye's to all of my close friends at work was difficult, as I had been there for almost a quarter century and truly enjoyed the people I worked with.  But as I learned on the trail, you can't do everything.  Choosing to do one thing invariably means that you can't do something else.  But Jessica and I felt a strong push to make this change while we're both still relatively young enough to get out on the trails and enjoy what the mountains have to offer.
I've spent the last 4 months getting the house ready to sell, paring down 29 years of accumulated ""stuff"" for the move, selling the house, packing up, travelling to Tennessee to look for a place to live, and then unpacking into our temporary rental home before we decide where to drop anchor for a while.  I've not spent the last four months writing journal entries - apologies.
So we are about 10 miles outside of Jonesborough, Tennessee on the far eastern edge of the state.  From our home I'm roughly an hour from the Appalachian Trail in many directions:  northeast to Damascus, Virginia.  South to Erwin, Tennessee.  Southwest to Hot Springs, North Carolina, West to the Smokey Mountain National Park.  I'm looking forward to getting back on the trial for some day hikes and overnighters this spring as well as going out from time to time to provide some trail magic the the 2022 AT hikers.
I'll be back in the next day or to with a gear review post and some un-asked for advice about hiking the AT.",,"Jonesborough, Tennessee","Jan 20, Thu",0
Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646503,"As always when it comes to gear, it's just one person's opinion.  What worked for me may not work for others and what I was comfortable or uncomfortable with is highly subjective.  I had only ever car camped prior to the AT and had always slept in a tent, so it was what I was used to and had some experience in set up.  But I also had some concerns about possible overcrowding and competition for suitable tent spots on the trail and wanted some flexibility when it came to site selection.  I also knew that I had NO desire to sleep in any of the shelters that are on the trail as I considered them just a mouse-magnet and kinda gross. 
So I started thinking about using a hammock. 
During my years of reading trail journals I had only followed one hiker who used a hammock and they had dropped out after completing 500 miles, so I went to he interwebs and began to watch hammock videos and read articles on the pros and cons.  There's a youtube channel from a guy named Shug who has a wealth of info on how to properly set up and tweak your hammock as well as many reviews of equipment on the market.  Then my friend Josh put me in touch with his buddy Nelson who had about 7000 miles of backpacking under his belt and was a confirmed hammock camper.  Nelson was a great source of info as he told me he could always find a suitable hammock sight on the trail and that there wouldn't be a lack of trees outside of a few areas in New Hampshire and Maine.  I found that to be the case as well and only had one ""sketchy"" hang where I had to use some trees that were slightly smaller than I would prefer.  So after waaaaay too much research on hammocks or all stripes I decided to go with:
Warbonnet Blackbird single layer: made with 40d dream-tex nylon: 16.45 oz/467g (including double ended stuff sack and Hammock Gear ridgeline organizer) 
                 The Blackbird has a sew-in foot box which makes getting into the desired flat lay sleeping position (no sleeping in the shape of a banana) and I found it to very durable fabric.  I had to repair one hole that I made when I sat on my knife while attempting some minor foot surgery.  I used one piece of tenacious tape and it held for 1200 miles.  in addition to the footbox, the Blackbird also has a built in gear shelf that made life in the rack very easy.  I would put my electronics bag, stuff sacks, extra clothes and sundries on the gear shelf for organization and easy access during the night.  The Blackbird also has an integrated bug net that I used every night.  Can't say enough good things about the Blackbird and how comfortable it was.  The added benefit of never having to pack a wet and muddy tent was priceless.  I got to the point where I would set up and take down as if it were raining.  Namely: set the tarp up first and then hand the hammock and when braking camp get everything packed up under the tarp and then pack that last.  The Blackbird has two sewn in shock cords to stake out: one to keep the bug night up and out of the way and one for the gear shelf.  Stake weight below. 
                  Pros: Durable, strong, well constructed, integrated bug net (a weight ""penalty"" I was happy to pay), never had a zipper fail, never a bad nights sleep, legs were always slightly elevated helping recovery.
                  Cons: there is learning curve to the set up, you have to get used to sleeping (snoring) primarily on your back, limited site options in the designated camping areas in the Whites, some people make fun of you for being a nerd, if you want to camp at a hostel to save money there are usually very limited options to hang, lack of a sleeping pad in you had to stay in a shelter (thankfully I never experienced such an emergency), biggest con for most is that a tent provides you that little ""house feel"" with four walls and space to spread out your gear.  Hammocking means you have to be a little more organized and that your gear explosions are saved for the Hostel or Hotel.
Warbonnet custom Thunderfly: 20d silpoly tarp, 11ft with added panel pulls, and two tarp ticks: 14.95oz/424g (including tie-out line, two mini carabiners, and four shock cord loops added to tie-outs)
                  I chose the silpoly fabric because it is very water resistant without the high cost of a Dyneema Tarp.  In exchange for the added weight I also got the added benefits of the silpoly blocking a little more light than the Dyneema tarps and also being a little easier to pack up.  The Thunderfly tarp is a compromise of sorts between a full-door tarp and a flat tarp with no doors.  I choose it so I would have some weather protection on the ends and an added bit of privacy as well.  MY go-to set up was to put my tarp in ""porch mode"" where the side towards the wind and/or the shelter was tied down close to the ground and on the lee side I'd use my trekking poles to raise the tarp 3-4 feet off the ground before securing it to the stakes.  This allowed for a more open feel, more headroom, and view as I laid in the rack.  I would vary the height if it were rainy or particularly windy but only on a few occasions did I have the tarp cinched down tight to the ground on both sides.  So effectively, the hammock and tarp combo as a floating tent.  I probably had the doors deployed about half the time, when I wasn't using them I'd either clip them back with mini carabiners or use the tie-out cord I attached to tie the doors around the trees from which I was hanging for added room.  The tarp needs four stakes and tie out line (weight below) to deploy and if the pullouts were used then two addition stakes and additional line were required. I used my tarp every night that I was in the hammock - keeping rain, bugs, tree droppings and dew off my gear was worth it to me.  If I wanted to see the stars, I'd just step out and do so.
                  Pros: Having small doors came in very handy during a few of the heavy storms I experienced, keeping me dry and happy, never leaked water and silpoly was easy to compress and pack and dried quickly, 11ft tarp (a saw more hammockers with 10ft tarps) kept me well out of the elements, 
                  Cos: Silpoly fabric, while very water resistant, is heavier than Dyneema tarps and also weighs more when rain-soaked, that's it - that's my only con to this tarp.
Dutchware Beetle Buckle Suspension Straps: pair of 12' Spider/Poly straps with Dutch's titanium Beetle Buckles. 6.05oz/172g including two shock cord drip lines

                 So after countless hours watching videos about Whoopie slings and lots of time practicing various knot tying techniques I punted and decided that simple is better!  Dutchware's website is a hammock geeks nirvana, with lots of well thought out little pieces of gear and hardware to make hammocking more nerdy and enjoyable.  The 12 foot straps are not ultralight compliant, but having the extra length was great piece of mind for me if I was stuck with very large trees (happened multiple times) or trees further apart then would be ideal (ditto).  
                 Pros: they never slipped, never failed, gave me great piece of mind during a few raging storms that a failed knot wouldn't send me crashing into the mud, easy to coil and pack, super fast set up in the rain
                 Cons: there are lighter alternatives when it comes to straps, knots are lighter than even titanium hardware, extra water weight when wet
Stakes:  Six Warbonnet 5"" Titanium stakes - including 8ft of zing-it cord and one Dutchware Ringworm on 4 of the stakes 3.05/87g  - 5 spare aluminum stakes (you pack your fears!)  2.75oz/77g

                Yeah, I carried too many stakes.  So sue me.  I never claimed to be an ultra lighter!  I actually only started with the six titanium stakes but my second night on the trail i found 4 aluminum stakes stuck in the ground in the out of the way place I had set up my hammock, so in the interest of Leave No Trace and cowardice, I packed them out with me.  Somewhere along the way I acquired one more and kept that too.  Later in Maine I bent one stake so badly I discarded it  - in town.  What worked for me was permanently attaching my line and Ringworms to my stakes, that way when I packed up camp I was less likely to misplace or forget a stake because of the line attached to it - and this worked!  Never had an issue.  You can find many strong opinions on which stakes are best for backpacking but I never really had an issue with mine.  Sure, they got bent a bit from time to time but I'd just find a rock and pound them flat-ish again.  Good enough.
                Pros: Titanium and aluminum are both light weight, they worked just fine for me
                Cons: They're stakes, I got nuthin'
Stuff sacks and tarp line:  Warbonnet gray tarp line, two Dyneema stuff sacks for stakes and straps, extra shock cord  1.8oz/52g

               I had two 12 foot tarp lines, two spare 12 foot lines for the pull outs (only used a few times in heavy rain/wind), two 8 foot lines for additional tie-out and some spare shock cord.  Yeah, yeah, overkill - I know.  But the miniscule weight penalty didn't give me a moments thought.  My hiking buddy Quicksilver used a lot less hardware, line, stakes, and sundries than did I and he did just fine with his hammock.  That's why some of this is just so individual.
So that's my Shelter system.  Total weight (this is the FIRT TIME I've ever added it up!) is 42.4 ounces (or 2.64375 pounds) or 1202 grams for my Canadian and European brethren.  That's plenty ultralight for me.  I suppose if I ditched stuff sacks, extra lines, extra stakes, went with a smaller tarp, splurged on Dyneema fabric, shortened and lightened my straps, ditched the hardware for knots, and generally became more miserable I could get that well under two pounds.  
But I NEVER had any regrets about my shelter gear.  I had a few anxious times, knowing if I had to shelter up I would be sleeping on the cold, hard mouse feceed wood, but that neve came to be.  There were at least a half dozen nights where had I been tenting I would have been on a slope, sleeping on rocks, waking in a rain created puddle, or other misery.  My hammock packed dry into my pack every time and my tarp (wet or dry) lived in the mesh pouch on the outside of my pack. I never slept poorly due to sliding off my sleeping pad and really believe that having my feet slightly elevated every night was key to having fresh legs every morning.

Sev,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646579,"SLEEP SYSTEM
I had originally thought if I were to hike the AT someday I would be starting in Georgia in February and would need some heavy duty cold weather gear.  But as I had to decided to hike the AT fairly late in the game - the end of January 2021 - I made the call to do a flip-flop hike kicking off in Virginia in April.  This allowed me buy just one set of quilts for my sleeping system, not a cold weather set up and a summer set up.  I tried to thread-the-needle on cold protection while still being useable in the hotter months as well in the interest of saving a few shekels.  I knew I'd still be dealing with temps around freezing at night, but hopefully would avoid the real frigid stuff.  I ended up having roughly a dozen nights that were right around 32 degrees with a few in the mid 20-'s.  I sleep on the warm side so I decided to go with a 30 degree under-quilt and a 40 degree top quilt.
Most every guide that I read said you can take a quilt or sleeping bag rating and add 10 degrees to it to accurately reflect the lowest temperature you can comfortably sleep in.  I opted for a top quilt over a sleeping bag because the quilt is lighter (uses less material and no zippers, at least on mine) and i don't particularly care for the confined ""cocoon"" feel I get from a sleeping bag.  My top quilt did have a zippered foot book to trap a little heat and help keep my legs warmer.  For my bottom quilt (never, ever try to sleep in a hammock with out a bottom quilt unless you have a way to use a sleeping pad in your rack without having it slip out from underneath you) I went with a torso length Yeti from Warbonnet.  I choose the smaller under quilt to save some weight, save some money, and save a little packing space.  The torso length quilt covered my underside from the back of my knees to my neck.  If I were going to be facing consistent temps in the teens or twenties, I would have opted for a full length under quilt.  As it was, I would usually use my foam sit pad at night, placing it in my hammock underneath my lower legs for a little extra insultation.  This worked out well.
Additionally, I had a quilt-liner that I bought from Dutchgear for a little more insulation.  Though the primary reason I bought the liner was to help keep my quilt from getting funky from being in direct contact with my hiker stank.  Whenever I did laundry I would throw the quilt in as well and wash that.  I highly recommend using a liner for your quilt or sleeping bag if you are like me and are a tad fastidious when it comes to keeping your gear as clean as possible.  
During the coldest nights, I would wear my Merino Wool leggings, my camp shorts, two pairs of socks, a merino wool tee shirt, my mid layer jacket, and a knit cap.  I had mu Puffy Jacket in reserve if needed, but never had to wear it at night.  Once we got to the warmer months, I would usually just wear shorts and a tee shirt, socks and my knit cap.
TOP QUILT:  Warbonnet 950 fill 40 degree w/ stuff sack  16.4oz/464.9g
                   I paid a little extra to go with the 950 fill in order to save a little weight.  This quilt performed extremely well for me and I had no regrets choosing this over some of the more popular manufacturers like Enlightened Equipment.

                   PROS: lightweight while still performing well, packed easily, footbox zipper kept the quilt from twisting on cold nights, easy to vent/move aside when I got warm
                   CONS: can leave you exposed if you thrash in your sleep
BOTTOM QUILT:  Warbonnet Yeti 30 degree w/ stuff sack    9.9oz/280.7g
                  Having to use my sit pad for leg insulation was a bit of a hassle - especially when it had become wet during the day, but I'm still happy I went with the torso length as I was able to avoid overheating once the nights became warmer. By getting my hammock, tarp and under quilt all from Warbonnet it meant that everything was designed to work together and I had no issues my my under quilt slipping out of place.  Once I had it on the hammock, it was rock solid.

                   PROS:  Lightweight, easy to set up, no tweaking needed, performed well down to 27 degrees, packed small
                   CONS: torso-length isn't for everybody, some stitching stated to come loose near the end
QUILT LINER:     Dutchware quilt liner      2.25oz/63.8g

                   PROS:  loved this piece of kit, easy to use (during the hottest times I used just this and not my top quilt), easy to clean, durable, extra layer of insulation
                   CONS: aesthetically it looks like a garbage bag 
BACKPACK
When it comes to backpacks, I made the decision that smaller and lighter versus larger and heavier was a tradeoff I was willing to make.  I knew that I still wanted a frame of some sort and a hip belt (some ultra lighters forgo both and basically carry a sack with two shoulder straps) but I also knew that ounces and pounds matter.  I purposefully looked for a pack under 55 liters so I couldn't carry a bunch of gear even if I wanted to.  Secondly, though Dyneema was the lightest fabric available I had read that it was prone to abrasions and tears and also kind of noisy so I didn't think the extra few ounces were worth it, given my less than graceful ways.
After hiking 2193.1 miles I've come to the conclusion that no pack will hold up for the whole trail without an issue or two cropping up (at least no pack I saw).  Four to seven months of continuous use will wear on any piece of gear and even the heavier duty backpacks I saw in use had webbing split, hip belts wear through, shoulder straps come loose and various zipper failures.  My Zpacks Arc Air was no exception.  Due to a manufacturing issue, the frame on my first pack failed about 100 miles into my hike.  The sewn in frame retention pockets were made incorrectly and the vertical frame stays would pop out while hiking.  This lead to an unbalanced load and some shoulder pain.  Zpacks quickly shipped me out a replacement that I picked up in Front Royal, Va and I used that pack for next 2000 miles.  That pack also had a frame pocket failure (this time on the bottom) about 300 miles from the finish, but Zpacks sent me a repair kit and the awesome Lamb's Ear sewed it up for me.  Post trail, I sent my pack back to Zpacks and they had it back to me within a fortnight with all issues fixed and even a few minor blemishes repaired that I hadn't even mentioned.  
The ROBIC fabric performed very well, it was water resistant, abrasion resistant, didn't stain easily and looked pretty cool!  I ended up with a 50 liter pack which proved plenty big enough for me.  I added two Zpacks hip belt pouches that both failed due to the elastic retention strap breaking (one at 500 miles, one at 1500 miles), one shoulder strap pouch from Gossamer Gear for my phone, one shoulder strap pouch from an ETSY store for a 1 liter water bottle, and two external mesh side pockets from Zpacks.  If I had to do it again I would ditch the hip belt pouches.  I was not much of snacker when hiking and in retrospect I would have done just as well with an additional Dyneema pouch I could have kept in my bag for to hold small pieces of gear that ended up in my hip belt pouches.  
The top side pockets were a great addition.  In one went my toilet kit and glasses (NOT in the same bag) and in the other I kept whatever small gear I needed handy during the day - water filter and the like.  The phone pouch worked great (I took a LOT of pictures) and I also attached my Garmin inReach to the pouch with a carabiner.  The water bottle holder was also a great addition for me to keep hydration within easy reach.
All in all, I was very happy with my Zpacks Arc Air and would buy it again.
BACKPACK:  Zpacks Arc Air 50l ROBIC medium frame and medium hip belt   20.9oz/592.5g

                   Zpacks Dyneema hip belt pouches    3.1oz/87.9g
                   Zpacks mesh top side pockets         .8oz/22.6g
                   Gossamer Gear shoulder strap phone pouch    1.4oz/39.7g
                   Water Bottle mesh shoulder strap pouch      .3oz/8.5g
                   PROS:  Lightweight, durable fabric, even load distribution, arc-frame allowed for some airflow on my back, looked cool, shoulder straps and hip belt held up well
                   CONS: lightweight means not as durable (maybe?), only can carry 30 lbs comfortably, frame prone to failure, hip belt pouches fell apart,",,View Entry,"Jan 28, Fri",0
