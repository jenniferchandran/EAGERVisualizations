We've always enjoyed the outdoors and we look forward to enjoying nature, fellow hikers and the whole Appalachian Trail challenges.",,View Entry,"Mar 17, Wed",0
Silver Goat and Chaser,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633598,"Our plan was to drive a one way rental car from our home in Pennsylvania down to Georgia. We were going to drop the car off at the Atlanta airport and then get an Uber to Amicalola Falls State Park.
Well, my friends took me out for a retirement celebration Friday afternoon and I kind of lost track of time and I arrived  at the rental car place 20 minutes too late,. It turns out it was spring break weekend and none of the other rental car companies we're making one way rentals.  Needless to say, this was very upsetting.
So we tried to make a new plan to get to the trail.  After searching for buses, trains and other methods to travel, my daughter and her boyfriend Josh suggested that we should just drive our car to Amicalola and they would eventually drive down and bring it home.  It turns out that Amicalola Falls State Park will let you park there for months at a time.  And it only costs $25(with Senior Citizen discount). So the plan was set.  Thank to Hannah and Josh we were good to go.
We left on Saturday the 20th.  We also planned to visit my nephew Brandon, his wife Beth Ann, and their four children in Augusta.  We drove 12 hours,. arriving at their place at 6:30 pm.  Brandon and Beth Ann moved to Augusta from Pennsylvania about 5 years ago.  Brandon works for the Federal government and Beth Ann is a school teacher.  They also operate a ice cream,. actually frozen custard, operation called The Meadows.  This is a franchise they that is based in Holidaysburg, PA.  We had a great visit with them
The next day we drove to Amicalola Falls to start hiking.  Just before we arrived there we stopped at a Five Guys to get a greasy squirt-burger fries as our last real meal before eating dehydrated food for many months.  I can't think of a better way to prepare than this. It should be in the training manual.
We checked in at the entrance to the approach trail at about 1:30.  It was a beautiful sunny day in the 50s  - great hoking weather.  We registered as thru-hikers 1057 and 1058 for this season.     Right now it'6 pretty much the peak starting date for northbound thru-hikers.  They told us that at least 50 started today.  We weighed our packs.  Tom""s was 26 pounds and Lucy's was 24.   That was with 4 days of food and 2 bottles of water each.  We were pretty happy with that.
Then off we went to start hiking.  The approach trail is about 8 1/2 miles from Amicalola to the top of Springer Mountain, hich is the starting point for the Appalachian trail.  So the miles on the approach trail don""t count for the thru-hike.  We hiked a little over 7 miles to Black Gap. shelter.  The trail guide calls this hike ""strenuous"" and it was a bit of a challenge since we're not in hiking shape yet.  But we made it we'll before dark.  All-in-all,. The last two days have been very exciting.

Silver Goat and Chaser,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633658,"We stayed last night at a tent site at Black Gap Shelter.  There we're about seven other tents set up, and a couple people used the shelter.  But it wasn't crowded at all.  The Appalachian Trail Conference is strongly discouraging the use of shelters due to Covid.  In addition, the privies are apparently shut down throughout the trail.
We hiked up to the top of Springer Mt and took pictures at the official southern terminus of the trail.  From there we started our official northbound thru-hike.
There were lots of people out on the trail.  Some were thru-hikers but most we're day hikers.  It was another beautiful day to be hiking.  We were originally going to stay at Hawk Mt shelter, but it was only mid afternoon when we arrived there, so we hiked on to a stealth campsite atop a ridge north of Hightower Gap.","Black Gap Shelter

Silver Goat and Chaser,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633701,"We got up just before first light and were treated to a beautiful sunrise.  A perfect way to start the day.
There were lots of ups and downs today.  The terrain reminds me of the hills in West Virginia.  The trail itself is in great shape.  We met a Georgia trail volunteer along the way and he said they take pride in keeping the trail well maintained.  Then he told us not to get used to it.  Apparently it gets worse when we get out if Georgia.  We're very thankful for these volunteers.
We had some gear casualties today.  Lucy took a tumble on some rocks.  She was OK, but  smashed the face of her call phone.  It's still functional but it's hard to read the screen through the broken glass.  Our water filter also stopped working.  We couldn't get anything out of it or even backflush it.  Another hiker gave us some chlorine tablets to hold us over.  We'll pick up  new filter in Neels Gap in a couple days.
We're running into a lot of the same people along the trail and are striking up some friendships.  We've met people from Texas, Florida, Georgia, Maine, Wash DC and other places.  Everyone is very friendly.","Stealth tent site north of Hightower Gap

Silver Goat and Chaser,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633775,"We went over Blood Mountain today. This is  the highest point on the trail in Georgia, at 4400 feet or so.  One of the locals told us that Blood Mountain gets its name from when the Cherokee Indians came down from the north and wiped out the Creeks here, sending them into Florida.  Another story claims that the mountain gets its name from red flowers that grow there.  We'll, I didn't see any flowers so I'm going with the Indian story.  Makes better conversation.
The climb up the mountain was a challenge, but the worst part was the descent on the north side.  It was treacherous, with steep rock slabs and many rocky jumbles to negotiate. Glad that's over with.
At Mountain Crossings in Neels Gap we bought some supplies, including a new water filter.  The people there were nice enough to adjust our packs for us.  They said ""you have to wear your backpack, not carry it"". So now we're wearing our backpacks. They're great enhancements to our wardrobes.","Woody Gap

Today's hike was relatively easy but it rained all day with thunderstorms and high winds at times.  Our rain gear held up pretty well but eventually we got a little wet because it rained for so long.  Tomorrow is supposed to be nicer.","Neels Gap

Silver Goat and Chaser,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633881,"Last night we hoped to stay at Low Gap Shelter to keep out of the rain, but when we arrived there the shelter was full.  So we found a flat spot that was not in a drainage area and set up the tent.  All night there were heavy thunderstorms and torrential rains.  It was pretty scary.  There were flash floods warnings throughout the local area.  We found out today that 4-5 inches of rain came down last night.  Our tent held up very well.  There was very little water inside in the morning.  I have to give a shout out to Big Agnes.  We're using their Tiger Wall UL2 tent.  The picture of our tent in this post was taken a few days ago.  The tent only weighs about 2 1/2 pounds and it has performed really well for us.
Lucy has decided that she would enjoy this adventure much more as a support person rather than hiking the trail every day.  We've met a few other couples where one is hiking the trail while the other follows along in a vehicle for resupply, shuttles into town.  It was fortunate that we left our car at Amicalola Falls.  A couple days ago we got a ride back to there and picked up the car.  Now Lucy will operate the chase car.  We'll meet up every so often and she'll hike in from nearby parking lots to stay in the tent.  Another cool thing about this arrangement is that she can operate as a trail angel, giving out water and food to hikers as they pass through road crossings.","Low Gap

Then we were back at Your Home in the Woods B&B to enjoy the hospitality of Bonnie and Paul again.  Can't get too much of a good thing!

Silver Goat and Chaser,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634049,"We crossed our first state border today.  I was hoping to receive a shot of Jameson and a marching band, but they must have left before I got there :(.   It feels good to have one milestone behind us.  Georgia was a good state to train for the rest of the hike.  There were lots of challenging ups and downs.   I definitely enjoy the ups more than the downs.  It's just easier to fall or blow a knee out on the downs.
We had an interesting experience while driving to the trailhead this morning.  As we were driving on a two lane highway a dog was limping towards us right in the center of the road.  A little further along two other dogs of a similar breed were also roaming unleashed where a driveway met the road.  One of these two dogs was missing a leg. All of the dogs looked like they were we'll fed.   There were no humans around.  After driving a little further we decided to turn around and see if we could find the owner to let him know the dogs might get run over.
So we turned into the driveway and knocked on the door.  After a few minutes a man came to the door looking very unhappy that I was there.
Man in house: ""Yeah, what do you want?""Me: ""Uh, there are three dogs near the end of your driveway that are going to get run over and I thought they might be yours""
The guy looks me over.  I'm dressed in my Sunday best hiking clothes (clean T-shirt and shorts)
Man in house: ""Who are you and where are you from?Me: ""Look, I just thought you might want to help with these dogs""Man in house: ""Dogs! I don't care about no dogs.  Why don't you get back in your car and get out of here""
So much for trying to be a good Boy Scout.  I guess his reaction might have been expected, but I was surprised by this harsh reception.  I was glad to get back on the trail.  Everyone we've met on the trail has been very friendly and helpful.","Dicks Creek Gap
",Muskrat Creek,"Mar 28, Sun",11.80
Silver Goat and Chaser,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634050,"The Muscrat Creek shelter area was packed last night.  There were at least 20 tents set up with another 10 people or so in the shelter.   It had been raining most of the day and it finally stopped in the early evening.  People were hanging bear bags containing food and other smellables all over the place. The idea is to hang these bags at least 10 feet off the ground and at least 5 horizontally from tree trunks so bears couldn't reach them.  But many of the campers hung them haphazardly.  Some were only a few feet off the ground.  A bear could have a feast at this campsite.
AWOLs AT Guide, the guidebook used by  most hikers, warns that normal methods for be hanging bear bags will not protect your food in this area. Apparently the bears are smarter here.  Or maybe they go through special training.  The Guide recommends using bear canisters.  I've only seen one hiker with a canister.  Nobody wants to carry the extra weight.
The temperature dropped all night, and our shoes which were soaked from walking in the rain yesterday, were frozen stiff this morning.  Our water bottles we're partially frozen also.  After hiking an hour or so we were warm again. Lucy and I hiked north together for 4 miles to the car, which was parked at Deep Gap.  Then I continued on to Betty Creek Gap.  I hiked a little further than originally planned so I could have a shorter day tomorrow, when we'll stay at Baltimore Jack's Hostel in Franklin, NC.","Muskrat Creek

Silver Goat and Chaser,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634075,"The first hundred miles are in the bag.  Our son Jerry texted us and informed us that we are 4.6% done.  I guess 100 miles doesn't sound so impressive from thatperspective.  One step at a time.
Most hikers get off the trail at Winding Stair Gap or one of other nearby road crossings to go into Franklin, NC.  Franklin is a hiker-friendly town that has a number of hostels, hotels, and B&B's.  It also has an outfitter for new gear and gear repairs, a brew-pub and other places that provide hiker necessities.  In the town square there's a large welcome board for 2021 thru-hikers.  Hikers are encouraged to sign it.
We're staying tonight at Baltimore Jack's Hostel. Baltimore Jack wrote a nice resupply guide a while back that we're using as a reference.
Tomorrow is supposed to be rainy most of the day with heavy downpours and thunderstorms in the afternoon.  We may try to do some hiking in the morning before the heavy rains come.","Betty Creek Gap

Silver Goat and Chaser,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634127,"Yesterday evening we met up with our son Brian and his wife Adele at a restaurant in Walhalla, SC. Brian and Adele drove down to Greenville,SC to explore the area for a potential place to live when Brian finishes his Residency,. Wahalla is about half way between Greenville and Franklin, NC, where we're staying right now.  It was great to see the two of them.
I started hiking today from Winding Stair Gap in the rain with the intention of quiting just before the thunderstorms arrived in the early afternoon.  Apparently I was the only knucklehead with this plan because I only saw one other hiker on the trail today.  And he  was hiking back to the nearest road junction to get a ride home because he blew out his knee.  I felt bad for him.  I've heard of a number of hikers who've had to end their hikes due to injuries.
I met Lucy at Wayah Bald tower, which at 5300 feet, usually provides a great view of the mountains for miles around.  Today it was socked in with clouds.  It was still early and the thunderstorms were still hours away, so I hiked on to Burningtown Gap,. That will make for a shorter hike tomorrow when we hike into the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC).  There's a small cabin waiting for us there with a hot tub.  We're trying to enjoy the local amenities as much as we can as we continue this adventure.","Winding Stair Gap

Silver Goat and Chaser,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634173,"Hi everyone,Tom asked me to tell you what kind of day I put in ""on the trail"".  Well, our morning started @ 6:00am. We were in the car by 6:30 looking for a gas station and checking on the oil to Mini.  Then it was off on a 53 minute car ride  on winding backroads to  Burningtown Gap to drop Tom off where I picked him the day before.
I followed the road towards the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC). Our afternoon meeting place.  I drove through this incredible canyon with a raging river along side.  It reminded me of the Pacific Northwest. I actually drove through it twice....I turned around and drove through it again. It was so pretty in this canyon.  I later found out the 2013 freestyle kayaking championships were held on this stream.  
Today was an easier day for me. I hiked 2.5 miles on the AT to meet up with Tom.  Then we hiked 2.5 miles back to the car.  It was a very cold hike. I don't think it got much above 40 today and it was very windy.  I saw less than 5  hikers today.  I think the rain and freezing cold had something to do with this.

The day started off pretty cold.  When I started off hiking around 8:00 AM, it was 27 deg.  But it wasn't uncomfortable.  Yesterday the temperature was in the upper 30's in the morning and the wind was blowing around 20 mph.  I was very cold for the first few hours.  Today the wind was light and it made a huge difference.  Looking ahead, I know we're eventually going to be hiking in 90 deg temps with high humidity.  I'll take today's conditions over that.
Lucy spent the day hiking, checking out the local towns and shuttling hikers from Stecoah Gap into town.  She really enjoys helping others.  We met up at the Gap and hiked on a mile further to a tent site.  It's going to be cold again tonight, but things are looking up in the days ahead.","Nantahala Outdoor Center

Silver Goat and Chaser,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634264,"Today the hike took us to Fontana Dam.  The hike was long and mostly downhill, which sounds easier but it was really hard on my knees.  Other people I met we're having difficulties also.  I just have to slow down on the downhills.  Lucy met me about 2 1/2 miles from the dam and we hiked in together.
I hiked a few miles today with rodNreel.  He's 69 years old and has already hiked the trail twice ... when he was 23 and 62.  He walks a mean pace and I had trouble keeping up with him.  He gave me lots of good advice about food, gear, and hiking technique.  Nice guy.
The picture in this post is the FontanaHilton shelter.  It is supposed to be the most luxurious shelter on the trail.  It has room for quite a few people, maybe 20 or so. There are picnic tables outside, a grassy area for people who want to set up tents, a charging station for cell phones, a hot shower nearby, and it overlooks Fontana Lake.  It's as good as shelters get.
Tomorrow I'll enter the Smokies.  The Smokies are notorious for bad weather, and the next 4 days or so are looking pretty good.  I hope to get through in 5 days.  It's about 74 miles so it'll be a challenge. Lucy is going to drive home to State College, PA tomorrow.  She's going to swap out Mini Cooper for our truck.  The truck is more reliable and she can help more people with the truck.

Speaking of church, last night we stayed at Lonnie's Stecoah Wolf Creek Hostel,  and after we checked in we met Eddie Grunenwald there.  Eddie goes to our church back home and usually sits about six pews behind us.  Neither of us had any idea the other one was hiking the AT.  We just happened to choose the same hostel on the same day.   It was cool to see him.  It's nice to have a local connection.","Fontana Dam
",Russel Field Shelter,"Apr 04, Sun",14.50
Silver Goat and Chaser,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634358,"I entered the Smokey Mountains yesterday mornning.  Before entering the Smokies I had to walk over the breast of Fontana Dam.  The dam has an interesting story.  It was built during WW2 to create electric power to support the warm effort.   At 480 feet high, it is the highest dam east of the Rockies. It's almost a half mile walk across the breast   The amazing thing is they built the dam 2 years. 
After crossing the dam I started climbing into the Smokies.  The first stop was to drop off my thru-hiker permit in the drop box.  The box was overflowing with hiker permits.  In fact, when I opened the lid, 5 other permits fell out. So I stuffed mine and the ones that fell out back in and moved on.  The Smokies are one of the few places on the trail that require registration.  I think the Shenandoah's and Baxter State Park in Maine are the others.
There a bunch of regulations that you have to agree to when you sign the permit. You're supposed to wear a mask when you're near people on the trail (no one does).  Because the bear population is so large here you're supposed to hang your whole backpack on the bear cables, not just your bear bag (no one does).  The most annoying regulation to me is that you have to camp near the shelter areas.  We're used to just hiking along and just finding a flat spot to set up our tent.  You can't do that in the Smokies.  Again it's because of the bear population.
The hike up to the mountains from Fontana Dam was long but not steep.  In fact, it appears that the trail designers in North Carolina have made the effort to minimize steep ascents and descents.  The elevations have been higher than they were in Georgia, but the trails are a bit easier on you're feet and knees.

Silver Goat and Chaser,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634428,"A bunch of us from the shelter decided to hike three miles up to Clingmans Dome in the early morning to catch the sunrise.  Clingmans Dome is the highest point on the AT, and it has a special tower for viewing the surrounding mountains.  So one by one, begnning about 4:30 am, people started straggling up the mountain using their headlights.  I started about 5:00, arriving at the tower at about 6:30.   The last time I hiked in the dark was with my friend Dave James on My Charleston in Nevada.  During that hike my flashlight died about half way up the mountain.  Dave lent me his backup flashlight that day.   This time I was ready and there was no problem with my headlamp.  Sunrise was just after 7:00 and there we're about 30 people waiting there.  The sunrise was worth the effort.  It was beautiful.
One of road crossings during the hike today was Newfound Gap.  Passing through Newfound Gap is a significant milestone because that's where Bryson and Katz hung up their hike in the book ""A Walk in the Woods"".  When they arrived there they got a shuttle into Gatlinburg.  While there they saw a 4 foot tall Appalachian Trail map hanging on a wall. Katz looked how far they traveled so far and he said something like ""Hey Bryson, we've only traveled an inch on this map"". That's when they quit their hike the first time.
When I passed through Newfound Gap there were lots of cars and people milling about. It turns out this is a popular place for people to take day hikes.   In addition, there was a van from a local Baptist Church handing out all kinds of goodies to thru-hikers.  They had chocolate milk, apples and most of the other food major groups.  So, about a dozen thru-hikers were sitting in the grass in front of the van chowing down.  The local people were walking checking us out.   It felt like it was a zoo and we were the critters.","Double Spring Gap Shelter

Lucy has been driving the chase car as we move along.  She follows me along and we usually meet up at a road crossings or campsite at the end of the day.  She also chases down other hikers,  giving them rides to town and back.  So she has been named Chaser.  
A few different people have noticed that I can do fairly well climbing the hills.  They've been calling me the goat.  rodNreel took it one step further and named me Gray Goat because I'm a geezer.    I was going to call myself Rolling Thunder because I sometimes leave a trail of flatulence as I walk along.  But you're not supposed to name yourself and no one else has experienced that (yet).  So Gray Goat it is.
So we can check the box on the trail names.
Here are a few other trail names of people I've met:
ReRun : an older guy who keeps wandering off the trail and then he has to backtrack.
Kodiak : a big 300 pound guy who looks like Hulk Hogan.  Very gentle, friendly guy.  He keeps a slow but steady pace.  He's the only hiker I've seen out here that doesn't use hiking sticks.
The Last Boy Scout : he has already hiked the AT twice.  Now he's hiking from Key West to Canada ... 4800 miles.  And I thought I was nuts!
Fire Goddess : a self-proclaimed pyromaniac.  She loves fire.  She would fit in well with our old Boy Scout troop.
Stanky Leg : I didn't want to ask him how he got his name.

Silver Goat and Chaser,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634597,"This was our last night in the Smokies.  Most of us are glad to be getting out of this park because of all the extra rules and regulations.  Many of these rules relate to bear avoidance.  The Smokies have one of the highest concentrations on bears in the country.  And, sure enough, one decided to visit our campsite early this morning.
At about 6:00 AM, while it was still dark,  I heard someone yelling ""Go Away Bear!"".  It was Stankey Leg (mentioned in my previous post.  I crack up every time I type his name).  Sometime before that, Stankey Leg noticed that his tent was jostled by something.  He thought someone got up in the middle of the night to go to the privy and bumped his tent as he walked by, so he fell back asleep.  It turns out a bear had ripped a hole in the side of his tent and snatched his backpack.  Minutes later Stankey Leg woke up again and through this gaping hole in his tent he saw the bear's butt.  The bear was just sitting there ripping through Stankey Leg's backpack.
The interesting thing was that Stanley Leg had set up his tent in the middle of all the other tents.  My tent was about 25 yds away.  We were wondering why the bear chose Stankey Leg over the rest of us.  It turns out that Stanley Leg left some trash in the bottom of his backpack.
Once the shouts from Stankey Leg woke people up,  the whole camp came alive with shouts of ""Go Away Bear!"".  And flashlights from about 5 surrounding tents and the shelter we're focused on the bear.  It was like the bear was on stage.  In addition to all the shouts of ""Go Away Bear"", every now and then Stankey Leg would chime in with ""F__ You, Bear"".   I don't think the bear understood English because that didn't faze him either.    It was almost comical if it wasn't so intense.
Well, the bear was still just 5 feet or so from Stanley Leg, and amid all of the yelling and flashlights and rock throwing the bear started to mosy on out of the campsite.  Eventually, the bear just dropped the backpack after partially shredding it, and slipped away into the bushes.
In the aftermath it wasn't so bad.  Stankey Leg is a hard-core Tennessee boy, and he really didn't seem too frazzled by the whole ordeal.  I would have fared much worse.
I found out later that the park service sometimes closes the Cosby Knob campsite where  we were at due to bear activity.  I wish they would have told us.   The bear clearly wasn't afraid of humans,  and that's not good.   I'm glad to be out of the Smokies.
I met up with Stankey Leg again a couple days after the bear encounter.  The picture shown in this post was taken then, after he got a new backpack.","Cosby Knob Shelter
",Standing Bear Farm,"Apr 08, Thu",10.70
Silver Goat and Chaser,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634604,"Last night, after getting out of the Smokies, I stayed at Standing Bear Farm.  This hostel is only 0.2 miles off the trail so it's very convenient for hikers.  There was a rumor circulating among the hiking community the night before last that a bunch of people were sick at the Farm, and many of the hikers were deliberately avoiding the place.I decided to go check it out anyhow with the intention of just getting my food resupply there if it seemed sketchy.
When I arrived there I found that one of the people there, who was gluten intolerant, had too much of the stuff and got sick.  That was it.  The rumor was blown way out of proportion.
Standing Bear Farm is a unique place.  Most hostels have everything contained in one building.  At Standing Bear there's a collection of out buildings : one for an outdoor shower, one for camper cooking and cleaning, one for resupply,  and portajohns instead of a bathroom.  All eating and socializing is done outside around a central fire pit.  They have a regular bunk house, a tree house, and a creek house.  I was able to secure the tree house for the night.  I was happy with that.  I had watched a number of YouTube videos about Standing Bear before starting my hike and I thought it would be cool to stay in the tree house; and it was. A bonus : the tree house is right beside a small stream.  A perfect setting.
Everything there is done on the honor system.  When you check in they give you a small clipboard with a blank sheet of paper.  Everytime you grab something like a beer or pizza or some supplies from their resupply building, you just write it down on your sheet of paper.  When you leave, you just tally everything up and pay them.  They only take cash or Venmo.
I had a great time there.  I spent most of my time sitting around the fire talking to other hikers.  Some of these guys stay there for a week or more at a time, just hanging out doing some kind of karma thing.  There's clearly a hippy-type culture there.  It was a nice place with really nice people.
Lucy is back on line now.  She drove down from State College today and we're staying in our tent on the top of Max Patch tonight.  I'm really glad she's here again.

Max Patch is the highest of the balds on the trail, and it is unique in that there are 80 acres of space at the top.   Max Patch is 4600 feet high,  and all of the surrounding mountains can be seen. There was a full 360 deg panoramic view.   It was a great place to see the sunset and the sunrise.  The attached photo shows setup and you can see rain coming from the right.  By the time evening came there were at least 20 tents at the top.
It was windy all night with sustained 20 - 30 mph winds, but the rain passed us by.  We didn't get a lot of sleep but it was still a cool experience.
Today we're heading into Hot Springs, NC for some R&R.  It's a long hike but it will be good to get some real food again.","Max Patch

Tonight we secured a private room at The Laughing Heart Hostel. Another nice place.  It's nice to have a private room.
Hot Springs counts on the hiking community for commerce.  They have businesses to support all hiker needs including an outfitter, restaurant that serve large meals for very reasonable prices, a Dollar General and Hillbilly Market for resupply, and, most important of all, at least 6 drinking establishments.  Many of these places feature live music.
We ate tonight at the Iron Horse Station, a restaurant/bar with very good food and beer.   We highly recommend it for anyone traveling through this town.
So, Hot Springs is a great place to take a day off.  Tomorrow we'll climb out of town and get back to trail life..","Hot Springs, NC

Lucy also had a rough day.  She spent most of the morning driving around Tennessee and North Carolina trying to find a road/trail intersection we had previously agreed upon for a meeting.  Most of roads in this area are dirt roads and they're not well marked.

Lucy could not find a convenient road crossing to meet up with me s she slept inside the truck.  The rear seat flips down and it's just enough room for her to stretch out.  
Since I was alone, I carried my hammock and tarp instead of a tent.  I couldn't find an ideal spot for the hammock in Flint Gap, where I set up camp.  But I found one that was good enough.  I slept well and I was able to elevate my feet to give them a break.","Spring Mountain Shelter

There were two major highlights of the day:
 (1) the view from Big Bald the highest mountain of the day, was spectacular.  There was a 360 deg view, and even though it was cloudy, you could see for miles around. 
(2) Trail Magic.  A man and his wife drove to one of trail crossings and set up a table with food and fresh water.  They were not hikers themselves.  They just wanted to help hikers out.  When I arrived there I had apple pie, a big glazed donut, and some other health food.  It's hard to get enough calories.  That was just what I needed to tackle the big mountain that was ahead.

The hike was mostly downhill.  Lucy had to go about 6 miles.  Just before she reached the truck, a young lady she met on the trail caught up with her.  This lady was complaining about her boots and needed a ride to REI.  Lucy had some time to kill so she offered to take her to REI after the lady told her it would take about 1/2 hour to get there.  We'll, it took an hour to get there and the lady spent an hour in the store, and then it took an hour to get back.   Lucy's a great trail angel.   Lucy just made it back to our rendezvous point in time to pick me up.

I wasn't looking forward to the climb today out of Erwin.

Lucy met up with me at one of the shelters and we hiked along further to a unoccupied campsite on an old logging road.  She spent the day handing out water and food to hikers at one of the road intersections.  Tomorrow we'll tackle Roan Mountain, the last 6000 footer in the NC/TN section of the trail.  After that the trail will get easier for quite a while.","Erwin, TN

I said that's cool, and then the conversation went a little deeper and I asked him what he did in his normal life.  Again he said ""I'm Aquaman."" I'm thinking maybe this guy is nuts and I better stay away from him.
It turns out he really is Aquaman.  He works part time for DC Comics.  He said they pay him to travel all over the world to promote Aquaman.  He does autograph sessions and photo shoots with other superheros.  He showed me some of his publicity photos on his phone.
He also gave me some really good advice on nutrition while on the trail.
As far as I can tell he doesn't have any special powers, but there were a few waterfalls along the trail today, and he said he basically took a shower at each one.  The air temperature was about 45 deg and the water is mountain spring water.  Now I know he's nuts.

The weather forecast for today was pretty lousy, with slight rain, temps in the upper 30's to low 40's, and winds at 15-20 mph, gusting to 35.  Most hikers were taking a zero today, just hunkering down where they were.  I decided to slackpack(just carry food, water, and a little extra clothing).  That's the luxury of having Lucy driving the chase car.   So I hiked a bunch of miles on relatively easy terrain.  It didn't rain that much, but the cold and wind showed up as advertised.  Nonetheless, it wasn't so bad.  We decided to stay in another hostel tonight, The Rabbit Hole, to stay warm and dry.","Boots Off Hostel

The most interesting thing about the place was that the owners didn't wear any shoes.  They walked around in the cold on stones and other uneven terrain in their bare feet.  They also drove in their bare feet.  It was like we were in Fred Flintstone land.
Today we crossed into Virginia.  That wasn't our original plan either.  We wanted to take it a bit easy and find a place to stay in Damascas, VA tomorrow night.  But there's an ultramarathon in town and there were no rooms available at the dozen or so hostels/inns in town.  So, we decided to get as close to town as possible with the intent of stopping in town tomorrow for a good meal and then traveling north to the a shelter outside of town.  We found a tent site on a hill just 0.2 miles south of town and set up camp there.  At that site we camped beside a nice young lady called Alaska and her beautiful husky pup.  Alaska is going to be a National Park Ranger.  She's already spent a lot of time at Denali Park in Alaska and intends to make that her home for a while after she's done hiking.

But the biggest thing that happens in Damascas is Trail Days, which occurs for a couple days in mid-May.  During this event past and present thru-hikers gather together for a big celebration.  People wear silly clothes in preparation for the marquee event -- the parade of hikers through town.  During this parade the locals throw water on all the hikers because they smell so bad.  Many hikers that have already hiked through the town get shuttle rides back to town for the celebration.  
So, we hiked into Damascas.  We stopped at the post office to pick up a package that our daughter Kelly had sent to us containing my summer sleeping bag, which I won't use for a little while, new shoes, and a couple other things.  Then we were off to Mojo's Restaurant for a big breakfast.  We spent a lot of time there.  I wanted to stuff as many calories of real food as possible into me.  I know I'm not getting enough calories. 
I've lost some weight, maybe 10-15 pounds or so, and I need to arrest that somehow.  It's hard to not lose weight when you're burning 4000-5000 calories per day.   It was good to lose some excess fat, but I'm pretty sure I'm also losing muscle.  And I didn't have much of that in the first place.  Soon I'll be negative in that department.
I received a call today from Bruce and Ken fro my old work place.  It was good to hear from them.  It seems like so long ago that I retired but it's only been 5 weeks.

Trail Angel : Lucy has transported dozens of hikers to local towns, and she has handed out water and food to many more hikers.  She has also hiked quite a few miles.  I'll meet hikers I haven't seen before on the trail and ask me if I know Chaser.  Then they'll say she's awesome.  I'll tell them. Yep, I know that.
Gear:  Our gear is holding up well so far with only a few issues.  The first issue was Lucy's cell  phone was badly cracked early into the hike.  It's still barely functional.  We're looking forward to finding an Xfinity store as we head north to replace it.  I also lost my little titanium shovel for digging a poop hole.   I left it at a place in the woods where I made a deposit.  That thing was too expensive to replace.  I've been using the heel of my shoe and my hiking pole to dog a hole and it works fine.
Weight: When I started the hike I weighed 181 lbs.  Now I'm at 167.  Almost all hikers lose weight, especially male hikers for some reason.  I've been taking a protein supplement and I'm trying to eat as many calories as possible.  It's hard to replace the 4000-5000 calories I'm burning every day. Hopefully I'll stop losing weight soon.
Health: I haven't had any major aches or pains so far.  Early on I has some minor issues with my right knee.  But all is fine now.  Every day my feet usually hurt by the end of the day, especially if there's a lot of downhill and/or rocks.  I talked to other hikers and they have the same issues.  After a good night sleep the feet are ready to go again.  I've been experimenting with different types of insoles including the stock insoles that came with the shoes, Superfeet insoles, Easy Feet insoles, and Dr Scholl's.  The Dr Scholl's have worked out best for me and they were the least expensive.
Food: the backpacker meals from Mountainhouse are starting to get old.  We sometimes mix other ingredients with them for variety, but it doesn't help much.  I'm tired of the protein sawdust bars too.  I think I'll try to carry more 'normal' food like fruit and  maybe some packaged meats.  It will be heavier but I'll enjoy it more.  I'm still carrying peanut butter.  I don't think I'll ever get tired if that.","Davis Hollow

The trail to Dragons Tooth was steep and very rocky.  When I reached the monolith, hiking from the south, Lucy was already there, having hiked in from the north.  She commented about the difficult trail she had taken.  I thought it couldn't have been much worse than the trail I was on.  We went out the way she came in and trail was very difficult. There were many places where we had to crawl down rock faces.  The first mile was probably the toughest mile on the trail so far.  It was tough on our feet.

We had a nice surprise when we reached Gathland State Park in MD today.  A lady named Vicky (trail name : the Real Deal, I think) was handing out trail magic.  When I met her, she asked me my trail name.  After I told her, she said she's been following our journal.  She's the first person we've met on the trail that's been reading our journal.  That's cool.
But the best part was the trail magic itself.   Vicky has salads, strawberries, blueberries, apples, and other healthy food.  After eating packaged carbs on the trail for days on end it was great to get some fresh healthy nourishment.

Silver Goat and Chaser,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638069,"The trail through Maryland has been very nice so far.  After the climb up South Mountain from Harpers Ferry, the trail just rides the ridge.  And most of the time the trail had been on old forest roads that were graded  at one time.  So, the surface has been relatively smooth with no steep hills.  Many hikers use this as an opportunity to add extra miles.  I'm treating this as a chance to rest a bit before we enter the tougher terrain up north.
South Mountain also has lots of historical significance, especially regarding the Civil War.  It appears that just about every Gap was contested leading up to the Antietam campaign in September, 1862.  There are lots of placards posted, and I stop to read most of them.  It's really interesting.  In addition, the first Washington Monument was constructed on South Mountain.  It was constructed in 1827 by the residents of nearby Boonsboro to celebrate their independence day.  At the top of this monument I could see my home state of Pennsylvania.  That's the first time I've seen it in almost 10 weeks. 
I met another Aquaman today.  I met the first one back in NC/TN on Day 30.  The picture of the guy I met today is in the Photos section of this journal.  He claims he's the real Aquaman.  He also said there's a third one on the trail somewhere.  It's like there's a whole school of these creatures.","Crampton Gap

After that, some of us continued north for about 8 miles on the trail to Pine Grove Furnace State Park while the others backtracked the half mile and drove there. We were in a rush to get there because we weren't sure when the general store was closing. We had to get there for the half gallon challenge.  The tradition is to eat a half gallon of ice cream at the half way point. Fortunately, we made it there on time.
There we hung out with the four Lost Boys, Rolly Polly, Aquaman, and Boston. All of us bought a large tub of ice cream (1 1/2 qts) and an extra pint, and sat down to try to devour it.  Boston finished first in an impressive 27 minutes.  He said ""I didn't forget how to be a fat kid"". It took me 60 minutes to do it.  Everyone finished eventually and we all felt pretty crappy at the end.  I think it's going to take another 1000 miles to flush this out of my system.

The hike today was pretty easy.  The first 10 miles or so north of Boiling Springs was on flat land.  It's probably the flattest section of the whole trail. I hiked 16 miles by 1:30, took a long break, and then added a few more to get to the top of the ridge.

An unusual twist today was we got off trail about noon to go eat at the Doyal Hotel in Duncannon.  This was something Tom had on his bucket list to do.  The place  on the outside looks pretty runned down. The building itself is 116 years old.   But the owner was a hoot to talk to and the burgers were much better than the trail food we've been eating.  After our lunch Tom finished his milage for the day.  We met at the next parking location for me then hiked 3 miles together to the next shelter. 
On the nature note as we were crossing the Susquehanna River on the Clarks Ferry Bridge, at rivers edge I spied red ear slider turtles swimming and diving for food.  I haven't seen turtles like this in quite some time.

The most interesting part of the hike today was the beaver pond we had to cross.  Before reaching the pond there's a warning sign stating that you'll probably get wet crossing the pond and they strongly recommend taking a 1 1/2 mile detour around it.  After walking many mile it's really a lot to ask a hiker to add another 1 1/2 miles.  Sometimes I'll bypass springs if they're just 0.1 miles off the trail.  So, over the beaver dam we went.  The picture in this post shows Lucy deftly maneuvering the dam.  The crossing wasn't too bad actually.  We both made it across without getting wet.","Peters Mtn Shelter

That helped to give my feet a break.
It rained off and on for most of the afternoon.  That's when I entered the Knife Edge section.  This section consisted of large slabs of rock oriented at an angle, making it difficult to get flat footholds.  The rain made it slippery and I fell in this section, snapping one of my hiking poles in half.

That makes it more exhausting to climb the hills and it also seems like the mosquitoes and other nuisance bugs thrive in these conditions.  I'm trying to avoid using deet but I may have to give in and get some.  Second of all, the hills are tougher.  Today I went over Bear Mtn, Mt Race, and Mt Everett.  These mountains aren't that high, but the ascents/descents are very rocky and sometimes very steep. I guess this is training for what's to come as we proceed north.

It's an interesting story though and it helped make the case for a strong federal government.
The hot humid weather continued today, bug terrain was a bit easier. There was a section of trail that went through a bog for about a mile and I got eaten alive by mosquitoes.  It was a feast day for them.  And once they started on me they sent word out to all the children and grandchildren.  There should be some kind of mercy rule.","Guilder Pond

While Tom has been on the continuous hike, I would try to meet him in a further north location.  However, when i would get to a road w/parking where the AT crosses, the AT parking lot was blocked off or gated shut with no parking signs on both sides of road.  Sometimes 2 miles before the actual AT parking area. At first i chuckled at the signs which read: ""Due to the abuse of 2020 there will be no parking on either side of road.  Then it had an additional sign of the tow truck company w/phone number to retrieve your vehicle. Soon my chuckle turned to frustration.  Starting today i have a main location (local state park) to stay.  Then,  an estimated time to retrieve Tom off the trail on a main road.  So much for helping others....i will try to figure that out as the days progress.  I know water is an issue for all hikers w/ this hot weather.

From the trail today we caught a glimpse of Saddleback Mountain, a 4000 footer and one of the objectives for tomorrow.  In fact, the next three days are going to includes number of challenges including Spaulding, Crocker, Sugarloaf, and the Bigelow Mountains.  But after all of that is over, the terrain will become much easier.
Jeff, Roadrunner, Gigi, and I plan to stay together for the rest of the trail.  We're all the benefactors of Lucy's kindness.  She picks us up at trailheads, drives us to towns, and much of the time we can camp with her in campgrounds where there are hot showers and sometimes even electricity.  We are very thankful.","ME Rt 17

Meanwhile, Lucy was helping Patches, who we've run into a number of times on the trail.  We both really enjoy his company.  He is about a day ahead of me.  He called Lucy and told her the soles of his shoes have come off and was wondering if she could help him. So of course, she jumped in the truck and picked him up.  Then she took him to an outfitter in Rangeley.  Patches is staying in his tent at Lucy's state park tent site tonight.  She'll take him back to the trail tomorrow.","ME Rt 4

That will be a big relief.  I've been hiking about 11 hours per day and it's taking its toll.  Soon the terrain will get quite a bit better and I'll cut the miles back a bit to make it more enjoyable.
But most importantly, I crossed the 2000 mile marker today.  It's starting to feel like the end is coming quickly.  Right now we're planning to summit the final mountain, Mt Katahdin, on August 13.  That's subject to change, but that's the goal for now.
Lucy and our daughter Kelly have been working to secure campsites in Baxter State Park, which contains Mt Katahdin.  We have a number of family members who would like to summit with us.  There are very strict rules that only allow you to enter the park if you have a campsite or a parking pass, both of which are hard to get because they are booked well in advance.  But we were able to lock in a cabin and a campsite, so we're good to go.  The only real issue is the weather.  The officials can shut down the mountain if it is bad weather, and then you have to reset your plans.  I'll be praying for good weather.","Perham Stream

I've been hiking for the last four days with Jeff.  He's a really interesting guy who's about my age and we hiked at about the same pace.  That's a big change for me because up until now I've been hiking by myself for the most part.  It's nice to have his company. It looks like we'll stay together until Katahdin.
After that Jeff will continue on to Nova Scotia or Newfoundland, or some other cold place in Canada.  I don't think he's nuts.  He just likes this life.  He's hiking the Eastern Continental Trail (ECT), which runs from Key West to the innards of Canada.  Tomorrow he'll mark 4000 miles.","Flagstaff Rd

And a huge yard for those who do.  As i walk around tonight there are 17 tents in the yard.  They also do a huge breakfast in the morning starting at 7.  And... shuttles to the trailheads.  It's THE hiker place to stay if your in Monson, ME.

Tonight is one of the last nights we are with our tramily (trail/family)...Road Runner, Gigi, Patches, Jeff, Tom and I.  We've been together for the last 10 days.  I've really enjoyed their company, stories and the cleaver witt of Jeff.  He makes us laugh over the silliest things.  They will be one thing i will really miss as we finish up on the trail.

On a nature note, I've been looking since we got to ME but still no moose.    :(
However, wild blueberries are in season.  Even as I walk the trail South to meet-n-greet, I've been finding many blueberries on the bushes along the trail.  Yum!!
Tomorrow we'll head into the 100 mile wilderness.  Tom and I will be separated for 7 days.  I'll set up camp at Abol Bridge which is the northern end point of the wilderness.  After that, we'll probably take a day off, then spend a day hiking into Baxter State Park, then climb Katahdin on August 13..
