Jim Fergione,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640326,"My wife (Jo-Ann) and I have been prepping for this trip for a couple of years. One thing after another delayed our start but it was the Covid-shutdown that really put us on the back burner. Initially, we had planned a “traditional flip-flop”, starting from Harper’s Ferry and hiking north to Katahdin and then, we weren’t exactly sure if we’d go back to Harper’s Ferry and hike south of go to Springer and hike back to Harpers’ ferry, but that point evaporated with the trail/covid shut down. … so we waited, patiently. 
    With the vaccination roll out and the reopening of the trail, we have now decided to start our hike and do it a bit “non-traditionally”. We’re planning on starting at the Delaware Water Gap on the NJ/PA line and hike south to Springer, take the winter off and start back at the Water Gap in late April 2022 and hike north to Katahdin, finishing within the 12 month window.",,View Entry,"Jul 02, Fri",0
Jim Fergione,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640327,"I’ve spent the past two years testing equipment and prepping for this. It’s not like I haven’t spent most of my life outdoors in one capacity or another, but nothing of this duration. Last summer, because all the trails (in New England anyway) were so crowded, I opted to test some equipment another way. I had my wife drive me up to Northern Vermont and drop me off in the Conn. River where I paddled south for a couple of weeks. I primarily used the Conn. Rivers’ Paddler’s Guide to find campsites along the way, and I must say, the guide was very accurate and the campsites well maintained. It was an awesome trip, but most remarkable was how empty it was, considering what I was reading about the hiking trails being so overcrowded. I had one or two other people in my campsite on three different nights and that was it. I was alone the rest of them.

I got to test out my tent, raingear, new sleeping bag, foods I’d been preparing, but mostly just relax and enjoy the quietness and peacefulness that comes with being outdoors. The Connecticut River, especially in the far north, is stunningly beautiful (and the fishing was pretty good too).",,View Entry,"Jul 03, Sat",0
Jim Fergione,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640328,"My Pack and most gear, is all set and I’m still fiddling with a few minor items (whether I want to take something or not, or swap something out), but for the most part, I’m ready. I’m now well into cooking, dehydrating, and portioning food for my wife and me, at least for the first few weeks. After that, and once we’re in the “swing of things”, we’ll be resupplying in town. My wife is all packed also. We leave in 31 days, and it’s very exciting. I’m finally retiring (again) from over 39 yrs in Air Traffic Control for the FAA and Midwest Air Traffic Svcs. I’ve been dreaming about doing this hike since I got out of High School over 50 yrs ago, but after the Army, “Life” took over and I could neither afford nor justify taking the time to do it. Now, there’s nothing stopping me but myself.

Jim Fergione,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640534,"My Partner-in-crime, and wife, has her own
trail journal, and I’m sure she’ll be updating it more often than me as well as
being more descriptive and “artsy”. If you’re interested, her trail journal is
at https://www.trailjournals.com/josmith
When asked why am I doing this, a question was
raised in my mind. I had to ask myself, Do I love being outdoors or am I in
love with idea of being outdoors?  Then,
I had to ask myself the same question about hiking the Appalachian Trail, and more.  Have I
wanted to do this for so long that I’ve romanticized about the journey so much
that I’ll be disappointed for some reason? I’m a realist so know about bugs,
ticks, rain, cold, wet, sweat, stink, water, food, etc, but this is so much
more.  I do know that I’m “stubborn”
enough not to give up on anything once I set my mind to doing something, so I’m
not worried about if I finish, but possibly when I finish. Luckily, there’s not
a definitive timeline we need to adhere to, beyond the weather. I’m hoping to
do this within a year to claim to be a thru-hiker, but if injury is in my, or
my wife’s “cards”, so be it. It won’t be a “failure” in any case, not making
the attempt would be. It’s more important that we try. We’ll just come back and
continue at another date and be section hikers, which is fine.  
Leaving my dog, Scuppers is going to be the
hardest part of all this, although where he’s going to be (close neighbor) will
be more like “going on vacation” and “moving on up” (sung to the tune of “The
Jefferson’s Old TV series jingle). I definitely won’t be worried about him in
that respect, for which I cannot express my gratitude enough. If it wasn’t for
Kathy, I probably wouldn’t be going at all at this time. I’ll just miss him
terribly (he’s pushing 12 y.o.) and hope, somehow, I’ve gotten through to him,
that I haven’t abandoned him and will be back. (I talk to him and tell him
every day) (I know, bat-shit crazy)
Anyway, just some random thoughts about this
hike. It isn’t like this is our first outing outside. I’d have to say Jo-Ann is
a more accomplished hiker than I am and it was she, who re-stoked the fires in
me about hiking. Many years ago, I changed over and spent my time backcountry
and whitewater canoeing/camping and ocean sailing & racing, as well as bike
riding. “Not backpacking” allowed me to bring multiple “luxury” items on my
trips, which I couldn’t bring on my back, as well as having much more available
water, which kind of spoils you in some respects. For example, a good size tarp
to set up and sit under during rainstorms, (drinking camp coffee) can easily
fit into a canoe or kayak but I’m not going to carry one on my back, and there are many things like that, including higher quality food choices. I’ve had
to “relearn” hiking with only the essentials because I’m not willing to carry
the extra weight.
 I have volunteered the past few years with the
Appalachian Mountain Club with both the Berkshire Chapter (now Western Mass.
Chapter) as well as helping out the Connecticut Chapter, maintaining a
section of the Trail as well as maintaining a campsite on the A.T. in Southern Mass. It was in this capacity that  I’ve met many hikers, (Thru, Section, Day,
weekenders, etc,) and between them and my wife, the “need” to do this was
reignited. 
Jo has hiked quite extensively, out West and
through the White Mountains. The past few
years, we’ve been hiking or kayaking through Connecticut, Massachusetts,
Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine and trying to instill the love of the outdoors
to our  kids, even taking the youngest two
on multiple “adventures” in the White Mountains, which includes the Presidential
Traverse, and peak bagging the N.H.48 (still in the process). They seem to love
it but we’ll see how that turns out someday. Will they go outdoors on their
own, or only when we bring them?
What do I hope to get out of this? Like I
said, I’m finally retiring for the last time (hopefully) (I’ve got to have
something to do, I can’t just “sit”) so hope to be able to clear my head and
“reinvent” myself, minimize news and social media contact for a while, while
finding peace, quiet, and tranquility in the outdoors. I also hope it will restore
my faith in humanity because after watching how people, in general, have acted in recent years, and especially since the “covid lockdown”, watching the almost
daily horrific news and shootings, selfish, senseless violent acts and
destruction and disrespect, etc I’ve pretty much lost faith (in humanity). I
really hope, and need,  to overcome that.
 I also understand  it’s somewhat hypocritical to make that
statement concerning social media, knowing I’ll be posting portions of our
adventure on TrailJournals and Instagram for friends and family back home to
follow.  It is what it is … but I

Jim Fergione,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642064,"So, we're sitting on the side of a road dripping with sweat after a grueling day, low on water, sweaty, stinky, dirty, (my) phone dead, Aches and pains unimaginable.... My feet hurt so badly because of all these sharp, pointy rocks everywhere, I don't even feel them anymore. I have aches and pains in places I didn't even know I had. (The good thing is everything hurts, and neither of us have any blisters!!!) But, Ugh, it's still about 82 degrees at 4 pm and we're looking at another half-mile climb straight up the side of another granite strewn mountain to a tent site. We'd be fine with water overnight, but tomorrow's 8 mile stretch in 90 degree weather and no water source till the end spooked me. I didn't think we'd have enough (water) So, Jo found a little place on Guthooks (The Country Side Deluxe Suite) (semi B&B) and randomly called, and this wonderful, friendly lady came (she's a hoot!!! I love her!!! ) and picked us up at the trailhead, brought us to the grocery store and we're now sitting at this table in her backyard with a cold beer eating grinders!!! 😀 We're taking showers, she's doing our laundry (lemme tell you it's nasty), and after breakfast tomorrow bringing us back to the trailhead!!! Perfectly set for another grueling up and down, hot day!!! Clean, electronics all charged, plenty of water, and living the dream.. It's AWESOME, definitely the best thing I've ever done!!!... loving every minute of it!!! It's STILL better than a great day at work!!!🤣

Jim Fergione,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643272,"So, thinking ahead, because we're concerned about possibly getting caught in the Smokies in snow/ice in November, we're planning on hiking to Harper's Ferry, WV., flipping down to Georgia on Amtrak and hiking northbound from Springer, until we've got to pull out because of the weather. If we don't make it back to Harper's Ferry before November that's OK, we can head back next March (late)/ (early) April to where we pull out (We'd like to be home for Thanksgiving) and finish this southern segment (to Harper's Ferry) then, well ahead of the northbound bubble beginning at Springer (Georgia) next March/April. (We want to avoid that if we can) When we do make it to Harper's Ferry, flip up to the Delaware Water Gap,  where we started Southbound this August, and continue our adventure northbound. By doing this,  not only will it ease congestion, hopefully, it'll also be a bit ""cooler"" at the 4 & 5 thousand foot elevations down in the Smokies  than the oppressing temps/humidity we're experiencing here (PA), and most likely will throughout Virginia and the Shenandoahs. In any case, we'll be doing our thing, and still planning on finishing within our window...That's our thinking 🤔 and what looks like ""plan B""... ""Living the Dream""

Jim Fergione,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644294,"Update... We've finished the Shenandoahs (106 miles!!!) which were beautiful 🤪. We (me & Jo) took Amtrak out of Charlottesville, VA last night, to  Gainesville,  GA, arriving around 8 a.m. this morning(Sun, 9/19) and then a shuttle to Amicalola Falls to start hiking Northbound from Springer Mountain in GA, and eventually, into the Smokies!!!

(back to Waynesboro,  VA) ... Have lost 24# +, as well as toughened up my legs and back quite a bit. I feel GREAT!!! What an adventure!!! We've met lots of wonderful people and I'm well on my way into believing in humanity again!!! ❤ Why did I wait so long to do this? ... and, Jo? ... just a phenomenal person!!! ... love that girl more every day 💕","

Jim Fergione,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644506,"Update: 9/24/21...As I had alluded to before, we flipped down to GA from Charlottesville, after a nightmarish overnight train ride (Amtrak) sitting across from an older woman who started talking (loudly) around 10:30 pm with some guy sitting right behind me, and didn't shut up until she got off around 6 am!!! The whole rest of the train boxcar was quiet, except for this one (obviously) lonely old lady. (and I was exhausted but couldn't sleep because of her)... OY, ... We arrived at a small, unoccupied ""station"" at 7:30 a.m. which automatically locked at 9 (so get out) until 6 pm, and was literally ""in the middle of nowhere""  and being Sunday morning, was even more desolate than normal (felt like I was in an old Charles Bronson / Henry Fonda movie, ""Once upon a time in the West"") ... we googled and spent all day in Gainesville, GA. sitting at a Dunkin Donuts waiting for a shuttle. (my fault,  but Dunkin was sooo nice)💕... Finally got picked up and brought to Amicalola Lodge to pick up our packages/resupply box and be dropped off on top of Springer Mountain, but, (should have known), USPS was late (by almost a week) in delivering our food. So, we were forced to wait, and fortunately, the Lodge had room/accommodations for us. It had just started rain and the fog moved in. We showered and changed, then went down to a  fantastic ""all you can eat buffet"" (they lost money on us)🤣 and to bed. As it turned out,  it rained hard for two days while we waited for our package, so we ""rested""... gotta be flexible!!! 🤣 Finally, resupplied and ready to go,  we were shuttled to the top of Springer Mountain,  dropped our packs and headed back to the Terminus. Then, forward to Stover Shelter for the night. (Very short hiking day) Jo's knee was a concern as it had been bothering her for a few days now and we thought ""resting "" it since Dawsonville would help, but now I was concerned.  We left Stover and ""hobbled"" to Hawk Mountain Shelter (another short hiking day) in the cold, driving rain, set up our tent, met lots of great people, and went to bed. Winds were howling about 50 kts and temperatures dropped into the low 40's. Needless to say, we didn't want to get up in the morning so stayed in our tent chatting and giggling like schoolchildren 💕🙂. (I love that girl)❤Finally,  we got up,  packed up, dressed in our cold, wet things and headed out (it was almost 9:30). By the time we walked around 2 & 1/2 miles, I called it quits with Jo's knee. She was in obvious pain and discomfort but didn't want to stop... she wanted to ""work through it"", but I'd watched this ""machine"" tear up the trail for over 400 miles and this just wasn't it... so, I refused to budge from a road crossing (Horse Gap) and forced her to call for a shuttle...  An ANGEL, known as Nimrod, came to pick us up. Nimrod is one of the most eclectic, wonderful human beings I have ever met!!! He brought us to his hostel (very much recommended under ANY circumstances) where we discussed our options.  We went to ""Above the Clouds Hostel"" in Suches, GA. Definitely a top 5 place!!! Jo-Ann's right knee is sore and swollen, could barely hobble from the living room chair to the dining room table... and to say I was ""concerned "" would have been an understatement... so ""tomorrow "" (9/24), we decided to take a shuttle into Dahlonega, GA to get an Orthopedist to look at it. From what I ""saw"", it didn't look good. I suspected it's from overuse and the Doctor was going to tell her to rest it for a couple of weeks which will force us to make some hard decisions about what to do. I didn't want to stop hiking but also didn't want to hike without her, my bestest friend! I avoided thinking about that so I had a couple of beers and went to bed to await a professional diagnosis... (slept fitfully, )... bottom line: 3 sets of x-rays, no physical damage (other than age related arthritis) 😉... so, we need to take a week off, she'll be on prednisone and anti-inflammatories and we'll get back on trail around 10/2!!! Awesome!! I was so happy hearing that news I teared up (isn't that weird?) and hugged her and did a little jig in the parking lot!!! I had been so worried her hike was over ... but, as it turns out, it's just another obstacle to overcome!!!    So, We're going to ""chill"" for a week here in Georgia  where friendly and hospitality is the ""norm"", and then start out SLOWLY (again) at Horse Gap, put in a few short days to "" test the waters"" (so to speak), and hopefully continue this epic,  fantastic adventure!!!    That's all I have for now... I'm ecstatic I didn't have to make ""the decision"", and honestly could use the week to rest my feet too. 🤪","Springer Mountain

Jim Fergione,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644965,"10/8/2021 ... Just an update...🙂... When we pulled off trail a couple of weeks ago to get medical treatment for Jo's knee, we sat around (pretty much) at this beautiful resort (Barefoot Cabins) in Dahlonega, GA for 7 days resting Jo's knee. What a beautiful week weather-wise!!! Great temperatures, zero rain... hardly a cloud in the sky!!! But, cold beers, real food, and nightly fires with other friendly guests made sitting around ""tolerable""!!! 🤣  After much discussion, We decided to head back out on Sunday morning, Oct 3rd from Neels Gap, GA and did, and just as you'd expect for me, it started raining about half an hour before our shuttle driver dropped us off. 🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️ (my luck) (we had known what was in store for us) ... but, off we went, and never believe the mountains in Georgia are ""easy"" (no such thing), they're tall and brutal. We were ""taking it easy"" with low mileage days to see if Jo's knee held up with a full pack...  easy-peasy right?... NOT!!! ... the rain was relentless. It rained almost constantly for the next 5 days. By then, everything we had was either soaking wet or at least moderately damp. We hiked up and down tall mountains, passed some iconic, picturesque viewpoints that were so socked in with clouds (we were literally ""in them""), that we had maybe 1/4 mile visibility (when the rain did happen to lightened up), so we got zero ""views"".  So much water  was running down the trail, it would hit your shoes (which were mostly under-water anyway) and come half-way up to your knees... you couldn't avoid it, so you just got used to it. But, the outside air temperatures weren't too bad and as long as you kept moving, you were fine... not that there was anyplace you could sit to rest anyway. You were wet, from rain and/or sweat, didn't matter and it wasn't going to get any better. Gotta say though, it was a very pleasurable week hiking, even though you were drenched from morning to night... Then, after you got to a Shelter and/or set up your tent (stealth), you could change from your wet things into your damp things for the night !!! 🤣      Finally, after 5 days of this  and everything beginning to smell ""moldy, we decided to pull out at Dick's Creek Gap and get a shuttle to the Budget Inn in Hiawassee, GA where we took showers. We then walked into town looking for a place to eat and ended up going to McDonald's, which we thoroughly enjoyed! (haha... we were ""splurging""). Returning to our ""Budget Inn"", and going to bed, I ended up having a hard time sleeping because it was so quiet (no wind, rain, trees... no night noises"", etc) and the bed was soft. That had us get up early, and we walked to a little place close by for breakfast, which was inexpensive and great!!! ... then began the gargantuan task of washing clothes, cleaning and drying out water bottles, as well as sleeping bags, shoes, gaiters, tent, etc... even our packs, then walking to a grocery store for resupply and finally,  in the late afternoon,  sit outside chillaxin a bit ... pizza delivery for dinner, then begin packing up and prep for a 7 am shuttle ride back to trail and back to our epic adventure. We should be in North Carolina very soon, leaving Georgia behind. Gotta say I love it here in Hiawassee! It's got everything!!! Mountains,  lots of water/lakes/fishing, beautiful surroundings and about the friendliest people you will ever meet ❤. Well,  that's it!!! We're officially beyond 500 miles hiked  and still kicking it ... and loving it more than before,  in spite of our ""curveballs""!! ... about 42 more days of adventure!!!😍... stay safe!!!Grit","

Jim Fergione,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646041,"Update to our Thru-hike…  As of Dec 1st, We have hiked about 750 miles. Quick synopsis: We started at the Delaware Water Gap on the NJ/PA line and hiked through PA, MD, WV and Northern VA through the Shenendoahs before pulling out at Rockfish Gap in Waynesboro, VA in September. We then took an overnight Amtrak train from Charlottesville, VA to Gainesville, GA and got a shuttle to Amicalola Falls Lodge where we spent two nights awaiting our resupply clothes/food box, during cold, driving rain. Then we started hiking northbound. We made 3 short days before Jo’s knee became a serious issue, so we pulled out at Horse Gap and got a shuttle to Suches, GA. We decided to get another shuttle to Dahlonega, GA for some medical help where Jo got X-rays. Fortunately, there was nothing “broken” or anything, it was simply “overuse”,  and was put on meds to help with the pain and spend a week resting it. We stayed at the beautiful Barefoot Hills resort in the hiker room, which we had to ourselves, for the most part... and beautiful, warm weather.  

     After being off trail for almost two weeks (after Waynesboro), between travel and her knee didn’t seem to be “cooperating”, she was just about ready to come home alone while I had to decide whether I continued on or came home with her. But we decided to try it again by “slackpacking” a bit, and we’re very glad we did. It gave us the confidence to continue our northbound hike. It didn’t help that it began to rain before our shuttle dropped us off and didn’t stop for 5 full days, most of it torrential. But, after the scare of Jo’s knee possibly stopping/altering our hike, the rain didn’t bother us a bit! (Ok, maybe a little) 
We just slowed our days to about 6 miles for about a week with her full pack weight, and her knee wrapped, so we could gauge how her knee handled it, and slowly increased that to 8 - 10 miles.  

    We did great, “Life was good”,  so we just kept plugging along, out of Georgia and into North Carolina, across Fontana Dam and into the Smokies, which were/are beautiful. The concern about Jo’s knee presented us issues with places to stay/tent as the Smokies are very restrictive, and it was getting very cold at night... around 30 degrees, with the days (hours of sunlight) considerably shorter. It even snowed a couple of times. But, even with the overnight temperatures, we were fortunate enough to have great weather and great views, for the most part, while the colors changed almost daily. Our hike through the Smokies was a fantastic, beautiful, almost magical hike. It was more than I had imagined it would be, and I’ve got a very active imagination. It’s hard to imagine a more beautiful one, although the White Mountains are just as wondrous. 
    As we had planned pulling out/off the trail for the winter anyway, and not wanting to get into the increased costs of “Holiday Travel”, which appeared would triple our costs getting home, we decided it was “time”.  The only thing that changed was the location, as originally, we hadn’t planned on flipping down south, but we’re glad we did. We made it to Davenport Gap, across the Pigeon River, under I-40, up the “staircase” to Standing Bear Farm where we stopped. Friends picked us up there (and it’s where we’ll start northbound in the spring) and brought us to Asheville, NC where we spent a few days before flying back home to Connecticut. We almost got stuck in Charlotte during those days when American Airlines didn't have pilots to fly and over 1,800 flights were cancelled nationwide. In spite of that, we made it. 
     We didn’t stop hiking either. We knocked off all of Connecticut, except the northern-most 6 miles over Bear Mountain to Sages Ravine and the CT/MA line… and the trail and campsite (Laurel Ridge) that I maintain for the Western Mass Chapter of the AMC.  We've done about 750 miles (total) so far, which leaves a lot of hiking to go. It's been quite the learning experience, but easily the greatest adventure I’ve ever done. 
    Our ""plan"" is to head back down to North Carolina around March 1st to the same spot we pulled out (Standing Bear Farm), and hike north to Waynesboro, VA, where we flipped. That's a total of 622.8 miles which we're going to try and get done before we shuttle up to Harper's Ferry, WV for the Flip-Flop Festival on April 23rd. (Long distance hiker festival/kick-off party). We've got a good friend we met down in southern North Carolina and ended up hiking with for a week through the Smokies, who is now ""tramily""(trail family). He's beginning his thru-hike, beginning at Harper’s Ferry, northbound after the festival, and we just want to be there to ""send him off"" (so to speak). If we do get those 622 miles done, after the flip-flop festival, we'll jump up to the Delaware Water Gap on Sunday, April 24th where we began our adventure, and continue our trek to Maine. By that point, we will have hiked 1,296.1 miles (plus CT (about 50)), and we'll have c850 miles to make it to Katahdin before August 4th. All in all, that will come to averaging hiking 10 miles a day, which shouldn't be all that hard at that point, and the weather should be glorious. I’m very much looking forward to Vermont, the White Mountains, and “God’s Country”, Maine and it’s infamous 100 mile wilderness. I’ve done a lot of wilderness canoeing through the Allagash & St. John’s River basin through Northern Baxter State Park, but I’ve never hiked it, other than day hikes on Katahdin and along the Maine Coast. I Love Maine… at least AFTER black fly season!! 😊 
    The ""learning curve"" for hiking this kind of stuff has been immense. Even with all the outdoors stuff I've always done, this was totally different in almost every respect, some unforeseen. My feet almost sent me home in Pennsylvania. After a couple weeks, at the end of the day, they were bleeding. My toenails were falling off and I was ""duct-taping"" them together!!! ha... I began with Merrel Moab 2’s which for me, broke down almost immediately on the Pennsylvania Rocks. Then, in Duncannon, PA. I changed to trail runners (Altra Lone Peak 5’s) and my feet healed and I never looked back. After switching, I didn't have any knee issues either. The trail runners were game changers for me. It also didn't hurt I dropped 20 pounds. I would not recommend starting Southbound from Northern Pennsylvania in August to anyone. The rocks were sharp and plentiful, the water supply scarce, and the heat indices brutal. 
    But, by the time we hit West Virginia, we were cranking miles. Climbing mountains didn't even slow us down. My legs were like rocks and I could go all day, and we both did. Sure, we were tired at night, but as long as we didn't over do it, we could do it day in and day out, and “life was good”. The best part was we could eat anything and as much as we wanted and we were still losing weight!!! That is awesome!!!  haha... we were burning about 6,500 calories a day (+/- ) and couldn't possibly eat that much, although it certainly seemed like I tried at times!!  

      I very much miss not being out there, and am counting the days before I get to go back.  (less than 80 days) :-) It's much more peaceful and serene out there, not hearing the senseless daily news of idiots trying to “out-moron” each other, not hearing any “fake news”, and not having cell phone coverage… and it's beautiful. It is definitely one of the best things I have ever done, and I'm not sure I'm going to stop until I have to (at this point). I've already got two other trails I'm planning on doing before winter 2022-23… but, age does have it’s ways of slowing you down. (I’ll turn 71 in August) (Long Trail in VT (end of August 2021) and the Northville-Placid Trail, NY in September)... 

   Simply put, I'd rather be out there …  Life is an adventure, and the adventure continues!!!  😊 
 

 

 

“You have to age, but that doesn’t necessarily mean you have to grow up…..  “ 

 

 

I will update this journal again as March 1st approaches. Right now I’m in the process of cooking, dehydrating, and packaging meals for our resupply boxes. The way I look at it is I’m darn good at cooking trail meals and preparing them, and enjoy them so much more (than expensive, prepackaged meals) after a long, weary day of hiking, not to say I don’t enjoy just about anything after that. It’s the logistics of sending them and where to send them that is more daunting, which makes it difficult. I figure if we provide ourselves with about 60% of our meals, which is what we found ourselves to be doing, and doing the other 40% resupply locally, I need to prepare about 180 meals for the two of us for March to August. As of Dec 10, I have 130 done, with another 50 to go. Our “dinner menu” (subject to change) will consist of  Bolognese and pasta, Beef Stroganoff, “Thanksgiving Dinner”, Hamburger gravy with veggies over arborio rice, Unstuffed Peppers, the infamous, delicious “Jo’s Black Bean Chili”, Tuna-shrimp casserole, Gumbo, Chili Mac, etc. I cook them all so they can be rehydrated using the Qt size freezer bag method which minimizes clean up. There’s enough to do at the end of the day, when you’re tired and sore rather than scrubbing cooking pots. Breakfasts for me consist of peanut butter (sometimes with jelly or Nutella) and protein bars, which may sound spartan, but are quick, energy efficient and easy, and surprisingly good and enjoyable. Then I snack/graze during the day with turkey sausage, cheese, trail mix (my own blend), protein bars, granola, dried fruits, nuts, Baby Ruth’s and Snickers’ bars, etc. The options change regularly, which makes it very nice.","

Jim Fergione,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646603,"We've been hard at work over the winter prepping for our return to the trail... we're very excited!!!  
  Update on our plans for our upcoming hiking season... I think I've mentioned the hiker we had met and stayed with through the Smokies. We met “Dodger” just north of the Nantahala Outdoor Center, NC when he was starting out on a week long shake down hike in preparation for a thru hike this year (2022), and we hiked together through the Smokies. Originally he had been planning the traditional Northbound hike beginning in early April from Springer Mountain. But after hiking and talking with us, he changed his mind and decided he would start out in Harper's Ferry after the Flip Flop Festival on April 23rd. With Dodger now being “tramily”, Jo and I decided to change our plans a bit and start out on March 1st, where we pulled out (near Davenport Gap, NC).  March 1st is a bit earlier than we originally had planned when we pulled out last October, but, we wanted to  finish the Southern portion of our hike, before flipping up to Harper’s Ferry for the Flip-Flop Festival for ""Dodger's Send Off"", and then flip up again to where we began our adventure, at the Delaware Water Gap on the NJ/PA line last August, and continue North. So, with that in mind, we booked our Airline Tickets into Asheville, NC. (BDL to AVL, March 1st)
    Dodger lives in Sylva, NC and over the course of the winter, and because of family and transportation concerns, decided he wanted to start closer to home, rather than Harper's Ferry. So, long story short, we've all decided to hike together (once again :-)  )   and start from where Jo and I pulled out, where the trail crosses just south of Standing Bear Farm north of Davenport Gap / I-40 Underpass. Now that Dodger is coming with us, none of us are planning on making the Flip-Flop Festival in Harper’s Ferry (this year). We could have started a bit later than March 1st, but after looking at the sheer number of hikers registered to start from Springer this year (241.5 miles south of our starting point), we thought it prudent to leave that change alone. So, as it stands now, we’re starting on March 1st, 2022, and hiking to Rockfish Gap, Waynesboro, VA (622.8 miles) where we stopped our southbound trek last September. Last summer, we had hiked south from the DWG (NJ/PA line) to Waynesboro, VA  before flipping down to Springer to hike north through the Smokies before winter, and to be home for Thanksgiving. This year, initially, Dodger will be hiking with us (Davenport Gap, NC to Waynesboro, VA) and who knows what will happen to his plans during this time? We’ll all have plenty of time to talk about it and adjust our plans accordingly. But, as of today, this is our plan.
  Once Jo and I reach Waynesboro, VA, our plan is to flip up to the Delaware Water Gap and continue North to the NY/Conn line (Pawling, NY) (162.4 miles) where we'll stop and go home for a couple of days (We live in Northwestern CT), which should be somewhere in the middle to end of April.  We will then start out again north of Salisbury, CT, because Jo & I have already hiked the length of the A.T. through CT (51 miles) this past November (and it was unexpectedly beautiful!!!) 😊, and hike into Massachusetts, onto the portion of trail that I maintain for the Appalachian Mountain Club, Western Mass Chapter (Sages Ravine to Mount Race), past the campsite I also maintain for them/us (Laurel Ridge), which should give me an entirely new perspective to this part of well-known and loved trail,  and continue our adventure to Katahdin. 
 This “timing” should be just about the end of the Mud season in Vermont (I certainly hope so), and Black Fly Season (even more so) but I’m sure we’ll still get to “enjoy” nature at it’s best!!! Haha… Over the winter, We've been very busy making over 214 dinners, as well as breakfasts, snacks, etc, as well as maintaining/swapping out our gear. All of this will be covered soon in another upcoming post. We're both very excited to be getting back out there, to the ""safety"" of the Woods, especially with Dodger who has graced us with his presence and with whom we've enjoyed multiple ""zoom meetings"", talking over things this past winter. Also, I must say, hiker hunger and trying to keep it ""under control"", as well as Post Hike Depression are real things. Maybe next time I'll be better at handling them because I wasn't this time, even though I had read, and knew about them, and thought I was prepared.","
