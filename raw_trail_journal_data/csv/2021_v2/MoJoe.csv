After a short night of sleep (had to re-seat a toilet bowl due to a broken bolt) and then finish packing, I had a smooth ride to Atlanta. Met Finder (F) at North Springs station where we got a ride from Ron Brown up to Amicalola Falls State Park. Having been a ranger at AFAP for 8 years and now running an AT shuttle service Ron was a veritable fountain of info. F and I registered and at about 2 pm we set off under clear skies and mid-70s temperatures. Our campsite was 7.3 miles in but 1.5 miles short of the actual start of the AT.

What an amazing day of hiking! After a breakfast of oatmeal and, of course, coffee, we had a quick 1.5 miles to Springer Mountain, the start of the AT. Photos (have to touch the first blaze), log book entry and selecting a pebble (which is to be carried 2190 miles and delivered to the top of Mount Katahdin) preceded our first AT steps. I felt much better today (I didn’t mention I had a couple of sessions on the ivory throne before my plane took off—made for a pretty tough start to the trip), and we passed up our planned campsite and went on a little farther. I’m going to bed early again trying to catch up on sleep.","BLACK GAP SHELTER

Well, don’t get too bent out of shape if my numbers don’t work out. Sometimes Finder and I use AWOL (thank you Ever Forward), but also The Companion Guide to the AT (shout out to Just Paul from REI Reading), and sometimes Guthooks. 
Today was about 16.7 miles up and over Blood Mountain, the highest point on the AT in Georgia. This mountain was a frequent battle site between the Creek and Cherokee, hence the name. The trail goes right through the Mountain Crossing store so we decided to resupply there rather than going off trail in a couple of days at Dick’s Gap. Lots of gear and food options and knowledgeable friendly staff; met Bill Hutchinson who runs the place. He also maintains the Creeper Trail near Damascus.","GOOCH GAP SHELTER

Most miles in one day, but with less elevation change, it seemed easier. Highlight was the log staircase up to Albert Mountain fire tower—quite some vertical! Even though it’s been clouding up the view was great. Photos of the history of the tower were interesting. Sprinkles around 2:30 pm and a forecast for thunderstorms mean we could have a wet entry tomorrow into Franklin for our Nero. Our shelter tonight was built in 1965, is small, and has duct tape on the roof. There were 4 people there when we arrived; I chose to pitch my tent. Looks like I’ll find out how it does in the rain! My main concern is that the terrain slopes into the tent sites, so I hope I don’t get flooded out!","STANDING INDIAN SHELTER

Well last night it did sprinkle but it really didn’t start raining hard until this morning. FINDER and I headed out at about 7:30 AM in the rain and it rained most of the way to Franklin. Chica and Sunsets Hostel was full so we booked a place at Gooder Grove Hostel, but when we got there there were so many people, and only two restrooms and shower facilities, we decide to head out to Sapphire Inn. We heard about it from Cumin, a thru-hiker we met at Rock Gap Shelter last night. After a Mexican lunch at Mi Casa we headed off to do laundry at the community coin laundry call five minutes up the road. This morning was our first rain (during the day) in seven days of hiking and tomorrow and the next day are also supposed to have rain, so will get to test out our rain skills.","ROCK GAP SHELTER

Up at 6 am even though the bus doesn’t come until 8:30 am. Went to McDonalds for breakfast but the inside area was closed. Tried to drive through but nobody seem to serve us. Fortunately a kind lady in a car rolled up to the speaker phone and we were able to order. After stuffing ourselves with lots of calories we still have plenty of time to make the bus. The skies have gotten darker so it looks like the rains coming, so think like a duck! At 8:45 took the 10 passenger Macon County Transit back to Winding Stair Gap. Light sprinkles in the air. The first shelter 4 miles in is predicted to get 1-2 inches of rain today.

It came in quietly. Wind. Sprinkles. Rain. But then torrents. Lightning. Thunder!!! At one point in afternoon a flash exploded right over our heads! The light and sound made it seem like the end of a 4th of July fireworks display! We took “lunch” at about 1:30 at Wayah Bald Shelter (with 8 other thru-hikers who were holed up) and tried to warm up (my hands were freezing!), but we headed out for Cold Springs Shelter. The shelter is small with a fire pit right in front. The “current residents” were drying clothes, so rather than deal with the smoke we pitched our tents. It had started to rain so I used my tent footprint, poles and fly to build cover and then set the tent up from underneath (thanks to JP at REI Reading for the cool tip!). Now it’s time to get dry clothes on, eat and go to bed! PS—I haven’t taken a single picture all day!","FRANKLIN

Started in the light rain at 6:37 am. Today we have about 3000 feet down and then 3000 feet back up. But we did cash in on a quick load of laundry, resupply, lunch and dinner to go at the NOC. And guess who we met at the NOC—Hannah! She started the same day we did and is in trailjournals.com/hannahvickeryhiking—very funny! 
Yesterday and today we were hiking around Smiles and JetPack, two hikers who have already done the PCT and the CDT. Great people and strong hikers. Twice today we had things falling out of the sky. First was a 3 inch diameter branch that would have hit Finder if he hadn’t heard it falling and stopped. The second was a larger limb but it was farther off trail. Crazy!","COLD SPRINGS SHELTER

Got rolling about 6:45 AM just a little bit later than yesterday morning. After a big day of ups and downs yesterday our legs were pretty tired. FINDER did see a rabbit today, and both of us saw a snake but otherwise there hasn’t been a lot of wildlife. We saw several lady slippers (sorry no picture) and they were beautiful. Rolled into Fontana Dam just when the last shuttle was leaving for town (5 pm), so we headed down to the general store and decided to stay at the resort. Guess who we saw? JetPack was doing laundry next to the General Store—she and Smiles had taken a room too. I guess thru-hikers think alike?! Had a great taco salad for dinner and ordered a pulled pork sandwich for lunch tomorrow will be up and at it early.

The Rhoddies are blooming down at about 1700 feet, but not yet up in the mountains. Finders at it again—this morning, right on the trail, he found a Doobie. The Fontana Dam is amazing. I took a video of Finder commenting on it (he’s an engineer) which you should check out once I get it posted (which won’t be until I’m in town). The trail in the Great Smokies National Park is more of a constant gradient than prior to this point. The tread is also pretty smooth relative to before. Finder and I both took town food with us—the pulled pork sandwich we had for lunch was outstanding! In the afternoon we met a guy named Goob, short for Goober. He just retired in April after 20 years in the Air Force. Finder and he talked aviation—it was very interesting and 1.5 hours flew by. We headed out at about 9:20 this morning and got in at about 5:30; a very good, but cool day. But at least it didn’t snow as was predicted!

Didn’t get up real early today and when we did we had to walk the maze of bodies on the ground in the shelter due to the heavy rain last night. Got underway about 7 PM and had a mostly downhill day into Standing Bear Farm just on the other side of I-40. The weather was mostly cloudy with a few sprinkles now and then and a generally wet tread that left our feet soaked. At Standing Bear, we did the typical chores laundry shower try to dry out our wet stuff and eat, eat a lot. We ran into Hanna here at Standing Bear Farm but she’s going off trail for a couple days she has to attending a wedding this coming weekend. 
The next couple of days could be continued showers on and off—we’re looking forward to being in Hot Springs in two days.

Skipped breakfast at Standing Bear, paid the bill and we’re on the trail by about 7:45 am. Very foggy this morning but by lunchtime it had started to clear and we we got to Max Patch it was a beautiful sunny day and we had great views. Supposedly Max Patch is one of the most popular trails in the southern AT. The trail from Max Patch to Walnut Mountain Shelter was mostly downhill and the tread was good. Got into camp about 5:00 pm.

Backstory: Tumbleweed the trail magic man. Yesterday just before we got to Standing Bear Farm a section hiker name Tumbleweed gave us pizza when we cross the dirt road—boy was that great!

5:15 am. Hard Rain. I rolled over for another 1/2 hour and noticed the rain had let up a little. Packed up, including taking the tent down, under the fly, but ate breakfast at the shelter. We left at about 7 am, in the rain, and had a slippery trip into town. At points it was so “greasy” I could hardly stay on my feet! I took a tumble on one switchback, landed on my pole, and almost hit a tree! Fortunately the pole wasn’t bent badly. 
Even though the trail was tough we made 10 miles by 11 am. Rolled into Elmer Sunnyside Hostel (check out the photos) about 1pm and checked into the room Earl Schafer used twice when he did the AT. We had lunch across the street at the Smoky Mountain Diner and tried to plan the next leg of the trip. There’s no gas in NC due to the computer hack so Finder’s sister-in-law may not be able to pick us up for a trip into Asheville. If not, we’ll have to get more food to make our next resupply point.

Trail out of Hot Springs went right along the French Broad River and was beautiful and then climbed up the slopes for a spectacular view of Hot Springs. In general the trail north of Hot Springs had good tread ,wasn’t too steep and we had a sunny day so we had a fantastic time. Ran into Smiles and JetPack again, but we expect that they will be getting ahead of us as we are soon to exit the Trail to go into Asheville to see finder‘s sister-in-law. After dinner we met two experienced hikers, 3rd Monty (73) and Fix-It (81). They’ve done the PCT twice, the CDT and now they’re hiking the AT, and they said that the AT is by far the hardest of them all.

But due to the gas shortage in NC, car trips can be limited so Nancy got a friend Teresa to help out. Teresa drove me to a phone store for a new battery and then we went to the new house that Nancy and Ted had built recently. Their home has wonderful design aspects and many special appointments which makes it a great place for renewal. We were welcomed and treated with special affection. Lunch was at the White duck—their specialty is tacos—and dinner tonight, oh wait we had pie after lunch, and then dinner tonight was, I can’t remember where, but I had a wonderful prime rib sandwich, sweet curried corn and Keylime pie.

The Roan Highlands were very mystical when shrouded with fog, but it started to lift and we did get some views.

Today was a day of sun, scenery and a snake. We had one of our first days of completely blue sky. The sun shone brightly but it wasn’t too hot and there was a gentle breeze most of the day. The views were great, the scenery was superb, we even walked along the stream for a while. At one point there was a super steep staircase of stone steps that lead down to Laurel Falls, one of the highest Falls that we’ve seen so far on the trip. The hot weather did bring out a rattlesnake—Finder had to jump backwards to keep from stepping on it! It was black with a red diamond pattern, about 4 feet long, about 3-4 inches in diameter, and had 11 rattles. I used a long dead branch to distract it. Soon it headed uphill while Finder and I ran past it! Quite exciting—trust me!! It’s been fun to share this day with my Super friend, Finder.


When we got to Watuga Lake, we got a hitch into town (Hampton, Tennessee) from six guys from the same Mennonite church in Heartsville, Ohio. They were: 
Vanguard & Ethan, Cameron, Jake, Rookie and Ross. Tomorrow they are getting a shuttle about 40 miles south and then they’re hiking back to Hampton. They were such great people and very generous!

We ran the Creeper Trail a little longer than is on the red line (it’s an alternate), but it was very cool right by the river so we enjoyed it. We saw deer, a guy catch a trout, and even a porta-potty! We passed over a bridge and Finder filled an engineering report. Open fields with grazing cattle gave way to Buzzards Rock and near the end of the day we got some Trail Magic. We stopped in a field with a piped spring (not at a shelter) and we hope to sleep well tonight!","Crazy Larry’s, Damascus, VA

Big day today—crossed the 500 mile mark! Also saw the ponies on Grayson Highlands! And on top of that we saw a steer with incredible horns!! Of course it was lying down, not even moving—(skip to next sentence to avoid a “Dad joke”)—I don’t think I can recommend it to anyone—I wouldn’t want to give anyone a bum steer. (I warned you :) We hiked through a very narrow slot in the rocks called “Fat Man’s Squeeze.” It started sprinkling about 2:30 pm and continued even until now at 7:45 pm.

The trail today seemed not as steep and had better tread. Again we traversed some pastures, saw cows, and had fine weather. No afternoon showers today and it’s the warmest evening in camp of the whole trip. I’m rethinking my warm weather kit—I’m probably going to send some things home and swap out for more lightweight equipment.

It sprinkled on and off throughout the night but the total amount of rain wasn’t much. After we packed up our first event was a stop by the Lindamood School which was built in 1894. The desk design was cool—behind the backrest one person was book cubby space for the person behind them (wish I had taken a picture of it). Our excitement and anticipation for a full-on breakfast at the Barn Restaurant located near I-80 turned to disappointment when we found out the restaurant was being renovated and was only open on weekends for outdoor service. Coffee and donuts from a Sunoco station was the stand in. Mile 550 (1/4 trail mark), a black racer snake, and rhododendron blooms filled up the day. Just before we got to the Bear Garden Hostel Finder noticed a fawn lying still, just off the trail, in a tree well of a fallen tree! You could hardly see it!

By the way, Craig and Pam did a great job filling in for the owners of the Bear Garden who were out of town for a wedding. It rained early in the morning but stopped by the time we headed out. There is a washed up bridge over lick Creek but we could cross on the logs. The Chestnut Knob Shelter was a very cool shelter—completely enclosed. Today Finder found a baby skunk along the path.

We woke up to sprinkles on the tent, but it didn’t rain hard. When I got out of my tent I did see what went “thump” in the night. I had thought it might have been a raccoon or bear dropping someone’s hung food bag by cutting the line holding it up in the air. In reality it was a branch that had dropped from a tree! Fortunately I was under a rhododendron tree far enough that the branch hit the tree and not my tent!

The trail tred was very nice today and we made pretty good time. Near lunch time we got Trail Magic from Bob, Chris and Anna from Marshfield, Massachusetts. They were down to drop off their daughter Emma who was joining her brother “Indy” who had started in Springer. Their whole family is awesome and we really enjoyed the food!

The day started cool and gray but at least it wasn’t raining. Most of the day the trail tread was great. There’s a saying that Virginia is for lovers and today we were loving the tread and gradient. We went over a cool suspension bridge on our way to where we feed hostile. We had second breakfast there and did a little bit of resupply. We were seeing some new blooms of a new species of rhododendron. We made it all the way to the shelter with only a few sprinkles but our gear is pretty damp and wet yet. Tomorrow we’re looking forward to drying out in Pearisburg.

Backstory: Nimblewill. We met the oldest guy traveling the AT this year, 83-year-old Nimblewill. He’s done the AT four times already and I asked him what’s the thing that has changed the most since the first time you did the AT. I expected him to say there’s more hostels or resupply is easier. But instead he said that the trail tread has really worn down. Think about it he said; roots should grow underground, and there’s so many roots above ground on the trail and that shows how worn out the trail is. He’s got a point.","Jenny Knob Shelter

We slept through a cloud up on the mountain so everything was wet this morning. Fortunately the sun came out and we plan to lay everything out once we get to town. The trail tread and gradient were again great—we love Virginia! We hiked into town and and stayed at The Plaza Motel. Linda checked us in and was VERY helpful! She gave us a place to store our packs (our room was being cleaned) and we crossed the road to resupply at Food Lion. Lunch at DQs, the usual clean up chores and a pizza dinner took most of the day. It turned out to be a sunny, warm afternoon (probably the only one this month) and if we were hiking it may have been the only day we could have worn sunglasses 😎

There was a tremendous view at the first bald,


but shortly thereafter the trail swerved left and right around fallen branches and limbs. I’m not sure what type of tree predominates this part of the woods but it seems an ice storm or something similar peeled off a lot of debris. It really slowed us down.




But by the end of the day we were able to make it to Wind Rock.

We were met Joe, a.k.a. Firewalker, and got some trail magic from him. He had a very cool hiking pole with lots of metal emblems attached to it.

We have over 6000 of elevation gain alone today so we plan to cut back on the miles. Last night in camp we met a guy from Georgia named Kitty Hawk. He and his wife started the AT last year, but had to get off. This year he’s out by himself. During the day today apparently Kitty Hawk lost his phone. We came up on a guy named Lens who had just found it, but without a label it’s hard to tell who’s phone it was! But inside the phone case were spectacles—so not a young person’s phone! We guessed Kitty Hawk and off went Lens running. Below you can see the happy ending with Lens on the right and Kitty Hawk on the left.   

We went past one of three weather and plane tracking stations in the lower US, 

as well as a rock called the Guillotine.

Other than Max Patch, I can’t recall any place with such full vistas. We dodged rain all day today. At times it would appear very dark, but it didn’t rain on us. A few miles away we would come upon wet ground so we knew it just missed us. We ran into a trail maintenance guy doing some weed wacking. 

Generally this helps a lot especially in keeping ticks further off the trail (I found one crawling on my leg right after we walked by some grass close to the trail that hadn’t been weed wacked. I’m pretty sure the Deet I sprayed on my socks and pants made it move and helped me find it!) Today, however, with the rain on the rocks and loose vegetation I ended up falling twice! It was a little steep as well, so in the future I’ll have to make the decision to slow down. But my biggest news has to do with my lighter pack! I cut almost 5.5 lbs by sending home my bear canister and in it my Nano Puff, quilt, gloves and compass. It’s amazing how much lighter my pack feels.

An uphill 3,250 feet climb in high humidity was the first thing on our to-do-list. The rain started about 2pm which added to the slipperiness of the rocks on the trail.

Did a little “yellow-blazing” today—my feet were hurting because of the trail conditions in last 2 days and Finder turned his ankle (not badly, but it was noticeable). 

As a result, we even learned a few things. 

We’re staying at Stamimals in Waynesboro and I can’t say enough about the place. Very organized, well run, clean and friendly. Highly recommended! For dinner we (Kitty Hawk, me, Finder and Makkreel) went to all-you-can Ming’s. I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I ate too much! 



Backstory: yesterday while hiking, Finder and I both heard something big move on the steep terrain up and to our left. We both stopped—and it’s a good that we did! A large tumbling rock that looked like a bowling ball, at least 1 foot in diameter, came crashing down from about 20 feet above us, crashed past the trail and continued down hill!!

Last night was warm. It was the first night in my sleeping bag liner where I didn’t feel chilled through the night. We got going early in an attempt to beat the heat, but we knew we were going to deal with the afternoon sun because we needed to stop in Duncannon to shower, resupply and eat!

The Susquehanna River came into view. 

Before we got to town we got trail magic from Darren. He works on a chicken farm that produces 100,000 organic eggs a day. He did about a couple hundred miles of the AT this summer—next year he is going thru-hike—and he just wanted to do something nice for thru-hikers. Thank you Darren!!

Today was another hot and humid day, so much so that the rocks were “sweating.” Not really, but they were colder than the air which was saturated with moisture and with a high dew point the rocks appeared to be sweating. To keep cool, Kitty Hawk deployed his fan! 

In other animal news, we saw a timber rattler and a turkey today—we felt threatened by one and appeared threatening to the other. 


Additionally we traversed a pond that was backup water due to beaver activity.
Fortunately for us we had trail magic food and drinks several times today. First we got trail magic (lots of bats) from Z (the mom), Ang (the daughter) and Sarah (Z’s sister).

Not sure how it got there but I got it off and took the one of the extra doxycycline doses I got in Buena Vista. Now I only have one spare dose left.

Mike is a great guy, friendly, fair and generous, and he also runs the Old Mill Hiker Apartment. I’ve used both and very highly recommend both!

On the way we went through the village of Wamamaker where there is also a General Store by the same name. 

This is so interesting to me because before I left for the trail I was working at Wanamaker Hardware in Arlington, MA! Seems like those Wanamakers are all over the place!

Today we were a little more prepared for slackpacking. Instead of Three Men and a Pack we had 2 day packs and 1 Fanny pack.

The rocks were much harder to navigate with a heavy pack on and even though I was being careful just after lunch, in less than 30 minutes, I stubbed my toes 3 times and did a full face plant into the ground!

We made a plan to take some yellow-blaze and some dirt-road blaze paths today in addition to the traditional red-line of the white-blaze in order to get a second breakfast as well as to keep our feet dryer so they could heal up from the wet conditions they had been through in Southern Vermont. Sometimes these alternates add miles to the “official” total and at times they subtract. Almost always the conditions are better.

We stopped in South Pomfret for second breakfast. SP is a very quaint, nice little town with a ski resorts called Suicide Six and an awesome General Store called Teago. They had great breakfast sandwiches, a lunch menu, fresh fruit and the typical food hikers would like. Very friendly service.
  











Next we came across Galexy Hill Farm. This property used to be a tavern on the Old King’s Highway.

We met Brandon Whitaker, the caretaker. He gave us some water and sour cherries. He manages the home and surrounding pastures.
  



The area around the farm is full of maple trees and sugar houses. 

Then we met Jim the road foreman for the town of Pomfret. He was out grading roads and he does it two, sometimes three times a year (in the spring after mud season and then to get ready for winter). Jim told us that the old Saint Johns farm 280 acres is going up for sale soon for a asking price of $3 million.


The roads he manages are quite remote—at one point, some goats just came wandering up to us.

We passed on going to Dan & Witt’s on Norwich in order to get Forest’s packages from the PO. Besides, we figured we could get at least as good of food at Lou’s in Hanover. Only problem—there was a 1/2 hour wait at Lou’s. So we ate and recharged electronics at Starbucks. 


There’s still a few low areas in NH including ponds with cattails. 


We tried to hustle to our shelter but still had to stop for trail magic.

Monday, August 23.

We decided to stay at Shaw’s and see what Hurricane Henri does to Maine. Hopefully the weather will clear up and we can make the rest of the miles to Katahdin and climb it in decent weather.



Poet did another great job of whipping up a fantastic breakfast. Spent the day checking food supplies, trail conditions and weather reports. Time will tell what happens. Hikers who rolled in recently but I met earlier on the trail: Classic and Sunny, Unfiltered, Suds, Nonstop and friend, Sunflower, Cousin Eddy (Grunt is off-trail for a bit), Dirty Pasta, The Last Boy Scout, Whippoorwill and Defcon, and Rocket.","Katahdin Ironworks Rd

Started the day off with Trail Magic from Biscuit—thank you!


Mike from Shaw’s had shuttled us back into the 100 Mile Wilderness after our Zero day yesterday and it sure was nice to start off with treats! The trail tread and gradient were pretty nice today and we even got a view of Katahdin!

And the end of the day was nice too—yet another round of Trail Magic from Water Queen, and a beautiful sunset. Quite a nice day!","Shaw

Last night by the lake was amazing! We had clear weather and a view of the skies over the lake. It was the first night I saw stars and the moon came up over the lake to shine moonlight all night! Awesome! And sunrise was pretty nice too! 

The birches in Maine have been great. I’ve seen some of the largest diameter birches since some I saw near VVR in CA when I hiked the PCT. Unfortunately, today I saw a cluster that fell over. 

My buddy Just Paul from REI knew I’d be getting to the Rainbow Ledges and he’d given me a tip to keep my head up. Well I did and was rewarded with my first really good view of Mount Katahdin. 

In two days I should be standing at the top and my AT trek will be done. Hopefully I can stay injury free so I can get it done.","Namakanta West Beach

Thursday, August 26.

Woke up at about 5 am; couldn’t sleep in. Didn’t have to get up early today given we were able to get service on Rainbow Ledges and we secured a campsite near the Birches. That means we don’t have to compete for the 12 NOBO slots at the Birches. Some people are lining up at 3 am just to get a slot. A ranger from BSP came down to the AT Info Center in Monson two days ago to assure hikers that only a handful of times had he seen all 12 slots get taken so everyone should calm down. But guess what? When we got to Abol Bridge this morning a hiker we knew said he was #15 and now had to go to a campground by car 15 miles away. Later on 11 more hikers had come out of the 100 Mile Wilderness and were trying to find campsites so they could summit tomorrow. The “bubble” is here! Heading over Abol Bridge we got another view of Katahdin.

We picked up a few resupply items from the store and headed to our campsite. On the way we stopped at a picnic table for lunch. 

Our campsite is 2 miles away from Katahdin Stream and really is a lean-to that’s supposed to fit 4 people. Three would work nicely; 4 would be tight. 

Forest started our last fire of the trail. 

Tomorrow morning we plan to get up at 4 am to head toward the summit and after we descend we’ll head to the AT Lodge hostel in Millinocket. Amazing!! One more day, and the AT is done. Even though this trail has been very tough (I’m sure it’s tough every year but the rain this year was especially tough for me), it’s kinda bittersweet to see it end. However, I’m very excited to head home, be with my wife and family, and catch up with friends. Thank you so much to all who supported me in this adventure. I couldn’t have done it without your encouragement!","Hurd Brook Lean-to

Friday, August 27.

We woke up at 3:30 am so we could eat, pack and get to the AT Hunt Trail early. Yesterday it was 92 degrees at base camp and, although it was predicted to rain followed by cooling to 72 degrees, it didn’t rain and it’s still hot. We want an early start to beat the heat and possible thunderstorms. By 5:50 we had hiked to the ranger station/Katahdin Stream Campground and off-loaded gear from our backpacks. 

Only the essentials were heading to the summit. We planned to go up and down the AT on the Hunt Trail which is open again now that a new bridge is installed.  


The trail started easy enough but there were several false summits.

Making it to the summit today was both an emotional high and a relief.

Each of us, Forest, Jersey and I, had our photo taken on the signboard. 

The skies were fairly clear today but it was quite windy. I got a nice 360 at the top and reminisced about the last time I was there.

We met Fargo at the top of Katahdin and he said he passed 74 people on his climb up here! Many people recognized Forest from his Facebook posts and greeted him. He’s such humble and unassuming guy—he never told me he was a Commissioner! :)

Well, we still had 5.2 miles to descend and then about a 40 minute drive to Millinocket. On the way I had my last indignity; I got stung by a yellow jacket! However, all things considered, we had great weather to summit; clear, least haze in weeks, mostly sunny and not hot or humid! 

At the end of the day, we all said: WE LOVE THE AT! 

After a celebration dinner and a great sleep at the AT Lodge hostel, (by the way, AT Lodge owner Ole Man bought the first AT thru-hiker, Earl Schaffer’s VW micro bus!)

Trail angels Chris and Wendy arrived in Millinocket to shuttle Forest and Jersey to Boston Logan airport and to take me home. It’s about a 4.5 hour drive—so thanks so much for driving both ways to extract us from the end of the trail! That was a HUGE help!

It’s kinda sad to be breaking up the tramily, but we feel great having helped each other hike this trail. Best wishes guys, and Hike On!!","Katahdin Stream Campsite
