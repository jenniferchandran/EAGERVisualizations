Traveller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633834,"If all goes well, I will be making my 4th section hike. My wife and I first met the AT by its alias the Long Trail, in the beautiful State of Vermont. That was 2007. Oh, we'd been backpacking, canoeing and enjoying the outdoors together since our early days in Maine. But this was our re-acquaintance with backpacking as older, more circumspect adults. And we discovered much better gear!",,View Entry,"Mar 25, Thu",0

Traveller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633836,"After it became clear that my wife's knees would no longer allow her to shoulder a pack and put in long days, I continued to be drawn to the AT and planned another long section hike for 2019. We bid our farewells at Amicalola State Park and I set out for Springer Mountain in early March of that year. With luck and the support of my friends and family, I completed another 410 miles, ending my effort near Roan Mountain, TN.  While I know down deep that each day was a stark reality of mental challenge, physical strain and occasional loneliness for my lifelong hiking partner, I now only remember the magic of certain moments on the trail and the interesting people I met. And so I continue to think about hiking on.",,View Entry,"Mar 25, Thu",0
Traveller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633837,"I'm looking forward to returning to the trail on April 19, 2021. Picking up near Roan Mountain where I ended my 2019 hike, I hope to return to Harper's Ferry. There is much more of the trail to tackle but time enough to consider that later. For as many section hikes as I (and my wife) have completed, there are almost as many attempts that had to be put aside. Now that I have fewer obligations, and still enjoy the support and love of my wife, I'm optimistically looking towards Maine, but for now I'll be happy just to take that first step off Highway 19E.",,View Entry,"Mar 25, Thu",0
Traveller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634972,"I was happy to see that the good folks at Trail Journals made it easier to highlight personal charitable causes on our journal accounts. I've admired past hikers on the AT for their charitable incentives, and so for this my 4th section hike (and I am so anticipating stepping out on the AT in two more days!), I want to shine a light on one of the premier land trusts in our precious Appalachians. I've been a member, volunteer and board member of Conserving Carolina (www.conservingcarolina.org) for many years and am proud of the great work they do to protect over 45,000 acres of our watersheds, mountains, vistas and farms. CC reaches out to our western Carolina communities in so many ways. They have built and supported over 39 miles of accessible trails, with more in the pipeline. Every local or regional land trust helps add to the permanent legacy of this great country. I happen to love mine, Conserving Carolina, and the work they do ""For Nature and People. Forever.""

As always, I was impressed by the condition and the lack of litter on the trail. AT hikers as a group love and respect the outdoors, even if it plays rough with us on occasion. Right now it's gentle, so I am gathering in all of the sun, the wildflowers and all of the budding trees that I can.","Mountain Harbour Hostel

Traveller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635234,"after a surprisingly cold night near a stream, I awoke to another clear day and hit the trail with the usual early aches and pains. It turned out to be such a beautiful hiking day with wildflowers everywhere, that I pushed on and added miles to get to Bears Den Hostel. I probably shouldn't have done that, but now on the morning of the 21st, after a comfortable bunkhouse sleep, I'm ready to go again. Lots of discussion around the significance of ""420"". Apart from the fact that I passed the 420 mile mark from Springer blazed on a tree on April 20th, hikers were buzzing over that conjunction, and some other off-the-wall occurrences on 4/20.

For everyone who loves the AT, the outdoors, clean air and water, this date harkens back to the Inauguration of Earth Day in 1970. A response to lakes on fire, eagles and falcons perishing from pesticides, dioxin that was being conveniently dumped into rivers and streams. A whole host of environmental problems. Fortunately many of these problems have been addressed because of environmental awareness and good stewardship of our lands. I am supporting Conserving Carolina (Conservingcarolina.org) because they and other land trusts are continuing to fight the good fight.","Black Bear Resort and Hostel

Traveller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635451,"I had a great stop at Boots Off Hostel, even though the only room available was a tenting site. And a cold windy night it was. But we were all able to use the kitchen- dining area and that was kept comfortably warm all night, and the next morning. The stay included good hot coffee, fresh fruit , cereals and pastries. Made for a slow start that morning. Most of the hike northbound out of the hostel followed the shoreline of Watauga Lake, a damned lake that is part of the TVA system. There were some stunning views of lake and mountains but the real treat was the appearance of lots of spring wildflowers along the trail. The latter part of my day, once I left the lake behind, was a lengthy ridge hike with a lot of ups and downs and no water features to speak of. A cold wind blew across the exposed ridge and by the time I got to a nice tent spot with a nearby spring, I was cold and tired. That night was hopefully the coldest temp I have to endure. It must have been somewhere in the upper 20's. I wore every piece of clothing in my pack and still shivered in my sleeping bag a good part of the night.","Boots Off Hostel

They made for good company the next morning as we broke our camps and prepared for the day's trek. My feet were telling me to ease up a bit, so this fairly flat hike to Rabbit Hole Hostel was timely...and it was a tad warmer; certainly less windy. I am now in another warm hostel with fellow hikers and I've had that hot shower and a town run for some food. I plan to rest tomorrow here, the on towards Damascus, VA on Sunday.

But after spending two wonderful nights at the Rabbit Hole, the magic of trail friendship and support from a dozen other hikers sweeps all that isolation away. And it's now official, Wokking Buffalo and his sweet dog Roxy are among my favorites so far. Roxy is only 6 months old and WB rescued her from a bad situation but she has gotten so used to love and attention from hikers that she is now just part of the family. I hope to see them again on up the trail. It's bittersweet to be a slow walker amongst all the high-energy folks. I can only hope we cross paths again soon.","Rabbit Hole Hostel

Traveller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635689,"After a long day for me, I settled into a nice tentsite trailside. But no water. I already knew this was one of those stretches where springs were far apart. So I had enough for that night and saved some for today's hike into Damascus. But after eating a double portion freeze-dried meal and not drinking enough before I went to bed, I woke up feeling sick. In fact, I felt poorly all the way to Damascus. Rather than some stomach bug, I'm hoping that I just got too dehydrated, a killer on the trail. But I checked in to Crazy Larry's Hostel, got cleaned up, drank several liters of electrolyte-fortified water, and slept for 3 hours. Larry has been so generous with some resupply needs, and it looks like I have the small Hostel to myself tonight. I plan to zero in Damascus tomorrow and make sure I feel better.

I also met a few young hikers struggling to find their way along the trail, hindered by unseen financial and personal constraints. we all seemed eager to start walking again, back to the woods.

The shelter was large, with lots of flat, grassy area for tents. And best of all, it had a privy and good spring water close by. A large clutch of younger hikers piled in, got a good fire going and we all enjoyed some sunset camaraderie. So many nice people out here, and so many personal stories. The scene was repeated at Lost Mountain Shelter. Today's hike went by and along the Virginia Creeper Trail. A spot I have ridden many times with friends.This would be the last night I would see a few of my fellow hikers from the last week or so. Eventually the law of averages kicks in and they move on ahead of me. See you up the trail, Wokking Buffalo, Huck Finn, Mellow, Joe Pine, and all you other sojourners.

Roger's takes you through the finest of high country forest.  All day I was reminded of the other high elevation woods of the southern Appalachians. When I arrived at Thomas Knob Shelter, the fir trees were dense and close in. The shelter itself sits on the edge of a large rock outcrop that opens to the south on the barren balds and rocky grasslands where the ponies abide. And as if appearing on demand, eight ponies were accosting the tired hikers, nibbling at the salt of their pack straps, licking the salt off their legs, and generally dominating the scene. As I was looking for my tent site in the conifers, out of the howling wind, the ponies moved through the trees, adding to their considerable pile of manure. I was especially careful where I stepped that night. And the wind howled all night, the temperature dropped to around 30, and we all knew we were not in Kansas anymore.","Lost Mountain Shelter

In fact, these trails are pretty good warm-up for the rocks of Pennsylvania that my wife and I know too well. It was unusually busy because of perfect weather, an ultra-marathon trail running event (thankfully on other trails, not the AT), and the usual weekender folks. By coincidence this day, trail magic was offered by the folks organizing the running event, with tons of great snacks and cold drinks for hikers and runners alike. What did I scarf down? 2 bananas, 2 oranges, 2 canned potatoes, 2 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, 2 ( or maybe 4) large pickle halves, and a bottle of Gatorade. Suddenly the rest of the walk to my night's tent spot seemed easier.","Thomas Knob

Yes, all of the AT is finally in a protected corridor but where it has to traverse farms or fields, those corridors may have been secured by conservation easements with the help of land trusts like Conserving Carolina.

The owners are committed to organic, low impact living, and appear to be practicing their form of Islam. I went to bed to the sound of gentle singing (prayer?) from the hostel Sanctuary. It was a fine and soothing voice. The hike this day included some rain, scattered but persistent through the day. I was happy to have a light poncho, which I draped over my backpack and secured on my head with my sun hat. Kept me dry. I and a few other folks waited out a thunderstorm at a shelter during midday. It was a convenient place to stop, and became especially nice for keeping us safe from the thunder and lightning. After a two-hour snooze there with the patter of rain on the tin Roof, we headed on to Partnership Shelter. I tented but this busy double-decker shelter was abuzz with hikers. The main attraction? You can walk next door to the Mt. Roger's Visitor Center and order a pizza delivery by a wall phone. As long as the order is $30 or more...they deliver. The picnic table in front of the shelter was covered with pizza boxes, soda bottles, paper plates and napkins. The Visitor Center even had a dumpster for the debris. There was no leftover pizza...of course.","Sufi Lodge

Fortunately I was taking a lunchbreak at a shelter when the thunder and lightning started, so my short break turned into a two hour respite from the thunderstorm.

I know some of the bunkmates, and others are new faces to me. I am now the proud owner of almost two complete mail drops and the weight of my food pack is as heavy as its ever been. The second mail box was a mistake of planning. All I can do is eat as much as I can to get back to a reasonable weight.

Bert, the hostel owner, made two trays of Texas Chocolate Cake. It was delicious and whatever was left was gone the next morning for breakfast. My recent hiking compadre, ""Tweek"", has come up lame with a bad foot. He stayed behind at the hostel hoping for a shipment of better hiking shoes. I pressed on early today to make the long slow climb up to Chestnut Knob. The reward for a hard day is a stunning view of Burke's Garden, know as ""God's Thumbprint"". The old fire wardens cabin has been converted into a hiker shelter but it is dark and windowless.

It let up enough for me to eat breakfast under the vestibule of my tent and eventually pack up, wet tent and all. The delays caused me to get a late start around 10am, and when I realized that at this higher elevation I was actually in a cloud with all its attendant weather, it was a real motivation to get my ass moving to a lower elevation. That took a while. I was hiking the long Ridgeline that forms the south rim of Burkes Garden, and it was more up than down for most of the day. Clouds and occasional light sleet came over the ridge in waves, interspersed with moments of sunshine. None of this diminished the beauty of Burkes Garden Valley. It eventually stopped raining as I got to Jennings Shelter, where there was a big, friendly crowd and lots of tenting space. I went to bed to clear skies, a canopy of stars and plummeting temperature. I put on everything I had, slept warmly and woke up at 4am to another round of rain.

Knowing this would be a long mileage day for me, I decided from the outset to take a slower, easier pace. With the increasing daylight and the knowledge that I had lots of time to get to my destination for the night, I felt no pressure to quicken the pace and tire myself out. The leisurely pace was like a whole new experience on this trip. I wasn't getting winded on the short but regular climbs. There was time to pause and look more closely at the woods. I challenged myself to identify as many different kinds of violets as possible.  And there were violets of all shapes and sizes right along the path (I counted 4 different types by the way). I took regular breaks and sat longer to listen to the woods. The slow pace felt even more relaxed since most of the day's hike was on flat, straight paths through a creek watershed. Unexpectedly, because I really did feel like a tortoise, I arrived at Wapiti about the same time anyway. What seemed slow was not really dragging out my day probably because I was seeing the forest with fresh eyes, a more intimate perspective.","Lickskillet Hostel

Low Gear downloaded the app right then and we had a good time closing out the evening. The next day I ran into them taking a break along an open ridgetop, and Low Gear heard, then spotted, a beautiful Scarlet Tanager right over our heads. Out came his phone and he verified the find.

I ended up at a nice tentsite with plenty of water for tonight's meal and tomorrow morning. There is a spring about 4 miles ahead so I can at least drop some water weight. The extra 4-6 pounds I carried today made a big difference in how all the muscles feel tonight. My pack weight is so critical for my potential success in the long-term.

I did get a fabulous view of the Virginia-West Virginia border area. And there were many stretches where all kinds of new wildflowers started to pop up. Because the upper Ridgeline was still mostly devoid of leaves on the trees, the ground was covered in green, with a seasoning of beautiful flowers. Some of the trilliums were fresh and really stunning. I decided that these long ridgelines were used to delineate the state line because neither state really wanted to claim the entire mountain; they just split the difference and called it a day.

If this is another easement provided by a private landowner, I'm reminded yet again of the value of conservation easements and the work of land trusts like the one I support,  Conserving Carolina. Yes this is a plug. But I do think we users of the outdoors often assume that public lands open to access are simply the result of our National forests, national parks, and their state equivalents.

There is a separate trail leading more directly to the memorial, but the AT also happens to pass nearby.

Oh, there are always tough climbs, and they challenge me more than any other aspect of hiking. But this one combined with a technically difficult scramble down the other side of the mountain. Steep, narrow and precipitous. So a relaxing 6-mile day didn't pan out. And I was lucky. Later in the day a gentle rain started. I was already safely ensconced in the bunkhouse at Four Pines Hostel.

So I had a chance to take in more cliff views at Tinker Cliffs (the third feature of the Triple Crown). And unlike those long, unappealing ridge walks of a week ago, the lower elevations here changed the look of the forest. I was enjoying Shady walks through pine and oak forest, with the understory of mountain laurels in full color. I had so much free time when I got to my campsite that I built a little evening fire before turning in. There have been some nice campfires at shelters, campsites and hostels and it's always fun to enjoy them with a small huddle of fellow hikers, but this spot and this fire was all mine, with the exception of 3 deer that ambled by the tent in the evening dusk.

Traveller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637881,"A town stop like the one I had at the motel in Daleville, VA can be a busy, not so restful 12 hours or so. I arrived at the motel in early afternoon and went right to work on chores. Paramount was tamping down serious hunger pangs by going next door to the gas mart and buying a large soda, 3 bags of chips, and enough lunch and pastry snacks to fill out my food bag for the next three days. Then, I hustles to get laundry started. While that process was underway I showered and shaved. And wow, how quickly the fatigue and soreness vanishes after that. So now what? Waiting on the clothes to dry I figured out a dining option close by. But it's still early afternoon so before walking the 1/2 mile to the restaurant, I calculated my next few days of walking so I could end up somewhere convenient to meet Joani along the Blue Ridge Parkway. That meetup and the prospect of 3 nights of relative luxury at the Peaks of Otter Lodge became the sole objective from then on. Working that out and then communicating a plan with my wife proved aggravating because the wifi and phone signal from the motel was, in a word, awful. But a plan was hatched, with reasonable mileage to make as long as the trail Cooperated. That almost never happens, but what else can one do? Every day on the trail is a surprise of one sort or another. That planning done, I went to work updating my Trailjournals entries and photos. And THEN, I trekked off to the Three Little Pigs BBQ. I try to stick to my plant-based diet but seeing myself in a mirror for the first time since starting this adventure convinced me that fat, meat protein and a large slug of calories was needed. I have to start eating a lot more food every day from here on out. So I indulged, had two beers and staggered back up the road to my room. I organized my food bag and pack, then crashed. The next morning the motel's promised ""hot breakfast"" lived up to its name by having hot coffee and a working toaster. So I ate whatever I could, strapped on my pack and headed out of Daleville at 7:30am. It was a long, hot day with little opportunities for getting water. So for most of the day I was carrying an extra 4 pounds of water  just to be on the safe side. I'm glad I did. When I got to my nights destination I was dead tired, but at least I was well hydrated.

Water was still scarce,  but the trailside displays of rhododendrons and mountain laurels took the edge off the day. Once again there was no decent tenting ground around the shelter so I slept in the large, 2-level structure and met 5 new hikers. Hearing the water of a small stream nearby was comforting but the warm weather and lower, wetter terrain brought out the no-see-ums, and I was covered with small, itchy welts the next morning wherever my skin had stuck out from the sleeping bag.

At over 4000 feet it was the tallest point around.

Last night was one of those nights. The raindrops hitting the outside of the tent caused little sprays of condensate to hit my face and worse...the top of my down sleeping bag. So the next day's hike to Crabtree Falls Campground was fortuitous. They had a clothes drier! The rain had mostly stopped by the time I packed up in the morning, but the clouds having in the trees and dripping leaves kept me wet all morning. It finally cleared by the time I hit the 3-mile connector trail to the commercial Campground. It was a happy arrival and the Campground owner, AJ, took care of me. Sleeping bag dried and fluffed, my mail drop food supply had arrived there, and I met some nice folks in the campground who shared their campfire with me.

But first I had to hike about 12 to 14 miles. This was probably not the best day for me to extend my mileage because there were several big climbs. But the views this day were wonderful, the weather was perfect and the beauty of the woods was a rolling scene of color and variety. The mountain laurels and wild azaleas were in full bloom, and the oak-hickory forest was that early-spring green of new leaves. Finally arriving at the ridgetop where I hoped to camp that night, I was greeted by the noise of what sounded like 20-30 noisy people. Oh my goodness could that many hikers be here? The trail had been so quiet lately. It turned out to be a dozen or so 8th graders and a couple chaperones on an outdoor backpacking experience. At first my heart sank as I looked around in vain for a flat spot to put my tent. But I was directed farther back away from the trail, and found a nice, level and open spot.

In less than a mile I was entering the southern end of Shenandoah National Park and the start of the Skyline Drive. The NPS has a kiosk on the trail for registering as a backcountry hiker. You fill out a paper tag permit and hang it on the outside of your pack. The Park service wants to keep track of the number of hikers but there's no charge for the permit. You have to estimate which campsites and shelters you plan to use, and the number of days inside the park boundaries. This part is clearly guesswork. I'm not ever sure where I will end up each night. Today was an easy walk to this shelter, and there don't appear to be many other ""unofficial"" camping spots along the trail.

Traveller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639912,"The previous 3 days have been tough,  no doubt about it. So today was a good day to ""NERO"". I didn't leave my room till almost 11am. And knowing it was a short day to get to Graymoor, I had a chance to physically and mentally relax a bit. The trail east of the Hudson gradually leveled out a bit, the rocks diminished, and I had a chance for a big sandwich at the Appalachian Market, right next to the trail. Energy restored. Lots of hydration. A weight was removed from my shoulders. Oh wait...I was still carrying a pack. Can't escape that. So as I tap out this update, I am sitting on a bench at the ball field of the Graymoor Spiritual Center. The tent awaits. Rain has so far missed us. The Graymoor Center is a Franciscan Monks' Retreat and they have opened their property to AT hikers since the early 70's. Part of the generosity of communities along the trail.","Bear Mountain Inn

Traveller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640121,"The Graymoor Spiritual Center was a welcome stop. More a scattered compound than a center, the Franciscan Order has opened its ball field to hikers for decades. But the night in the field was warm and damp. The day's hike immediately led me to some colonial American history. First you cross the ""Old Albany Post Road"". One can image horses and carriages moving up and down the path in the 1700s. Well, it might not have been a graded gravel road then, but you get the idea. Nearby I saw the old foundations of ""The Innoculation Barn"" where troops of the Continental Army were inoculated against smallpox. The corridors along the Hudson and Housatonic Rivers led settlers north from the eastern seaboard. Into the wilderness.","Graymoor Spiritual Center

Traveller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640122,"Through this heat wave I have been sustained by the fortuitous occurrence of roadside deli's and some trail magic. It's hard to get too much to drink. The trail hasn't made it any easier with lots of steep, rocky climbs and descents. So getting to the Grill at Fahnestock State Park 5 minutes after it closed was a huge disappointment. But the concession stand was still selling cold drinks and ice cream. That helped. It is surprising how exhausted the body feels after a long day of hot, humid weather and how quickly you can feel revived by sitting in the shade with several bottles of Gatorade and 2 Klondike Bars. Leaving Fahnestock was uneventful and the hike to Morgan Stewart Shelter was a blur of heat, clammy clothes and constant water refills at streams. Through these long days, I've been distracting myself by listening to tunes or audio books. Really helps.","Fahnestock State Park, NY

Traveller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640123,"Despite the worsening heat, today provided some changes of scenery and a wonderful rest stop. It made the day bearable. Hearing about this famous spot on the AT for years, I finally got to the trailside train station for the Metro North Line. Here hikers can catch the train to and from NYC and Grand Central Station. I could not picture myself schlepping around mid-town Manhattan with a backpack and trekking poles, but for many hikers who haven't yet seen the city, it's a cool way to venture off trail. Right after the station, in the middle of this scorching day, I stopped at The Native Landscape. This is a nursery and garden center that helps out hikers. They offer cold drinks and ice cream for sale and an outdoor shower behind the center with hot water, and a spigot for refilling water bottles. I was encouraged to sit under their gazebo and enjoy the refreshments. And then, after I had a chance to profusely thank the owner, I stepped out to the road and immediately rejoined the trail.","Morgan Stewart Shelter

I also had a food mail drop to pick up there at the post office. Another long day of tough, rocky hiking through intense heat continually affirmed that this was a good place to take a break. Had a great room and dinner at The Fife and Drum Inn, and found all my resupply needs within a 5-minute walk.

But I made the long walk out of town late in the morning and the rain let up a bit once I reached the woods. It was a much cooler day and so things felt much better. A lesson to be learned for me has been to experience the dramatic changes in one's physical and mental state from day to day. Among the the toughest, most unhappy days, most are followed in quick succession by the best. So mood swings are quite normal. And when I actually found myself zipping along a flat, wide, rock-free section of the AT that parallels the Housatonic River, I was practically euphoric. I was smiling again, to no one but myself. And reaching Silver Hill Campsite, with all its hiker amenities (it even had a swing on a deck overlooking a nice view), a good day was complete.

There are still some views, and some interesting people along the trail. The holiday weekend brings out many local hikers and we chat, share stories and contemplate the next weather change. Yes, it will get better. The light rain continues off and on but the cool air is surely nice for this early July.","Silver Hill Campsite

Granted, there were some very steep, almost treacherous climbs through wet, rocky terrain. But overall, it's a beautiful area. I also met what I expected in the local people.

As the trail has weaved in and out of nearby towns and hamlets along the US Hwy 7 corridor, our colonial and early American history is everywhere. Countless old stone walls are scattered through the deep woods along the trail; clear signs that this area was once teeming with early American agricultural life.

It was one of those days when the whole world around me felt damp and dark. At times, as when I got to the shelter location, the leftover rainfall that was just dripping from the leaves made it seem like the forest would be wet forever. Still, there was comfort in a dry tent, and it was definitely good to be shielded from the mosquitoes. I haven't mentioned bugs much because they really have not been overwhelming.

Traveller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640827,"Sometimes on a long, rainy day of hiking, a little bit of incentive helps. So the thought of getting to an actual cabin for a night out of the predicted storms put wings on my feet, at least when they weren't mired in mud and rocks. Upper Goose Pond Cabin was a great surprise. This cabin, maintained by the Appalachian Trail Conservamcy with the assistance of the National Park Service, was perfect for the weather that was to come that night. Nothing like listening to a rumbling thunderstorm and rain on the roof a through the night when you are warm and dry in a bunk. Kathy the caretaker and her 4 kids were great hosts, a d the breakfast of pancakes and coffee put an exclamation mark on a welcome stop.","North Mt. Wilcox shelter

And to make sure my phone didn't have moisture issues, it was packed away deep in my pack. Photose are just not a priority. But Kay Wood Shelter was one of the best I've seen this year. A Massachusetts bunk-and-loft design with a nice overhanging roofline to cover the picnic table. Nothing could be finer than that, convenient water...and above all the easant meeting of new a d old hiker friends.

Another wet day of walking, but as the afternoon came on the rains stopped. I was hustled through Dalton, MA via some back roads. This designated ""Trail Community"" doesn't seem to really mean it. But my destination for the day was Cheshire, MA. And this little town dies take it's trail-friendly status seriously. Right in town, next to the post office and the public works department, a small plot of open grassy land has been set up and set aside for tent and hammock camping hikers. It included picnic tables, drinking water, a port-a-potty, and a small shed with power and charging ports. They even keep loaner bikes there so you can get around town. By the time darkness fell there were about ten tents set up. It was great to see some familiar faces among the crowd.","Kay Wood Shelter

As my diminishing weight has been a real concern, how could I pass up a real meal? Mt. Greylock State Park signaled a return to higher elevations again, and the occurrence of New England conifer forest. As I approached the summit and the Lodge the spruce and fir woods felt almost exactly like the trails of Mt. Mitchell State Park in NC. And indeed, our similar forests down south are a remnant of this northern forest; a leftover reminder of the last ice age. The Lodge was small and cozy, and I wound up sharing the small bunkroom with two young Indian couples who each had two adolescent girls. I felt like a fly on the wall as this group of family friends dominated the scene. What at first seemed awkward became familiar and friendly. It always helps when your bunkmates are pleasant, intelligent and interesting. Such was the case. They were of course interested in my journey, with lots of questions about the experience of backpacking. It was as much fun, maybe more so, than a stay at a hiker hostel. Capping a good stay was sharing a dinner with two fellow travelers. The three of us ended up at a little table, all of coming from entirely different circumstances, but enjoying each other's company. My dinner companions were not AT hikers. In fact,  I don't think any other AT hikers spent the night at the lodge. They missed out.","Father Tom's in-town campsite

Well, in fairness, with the heavy rains over a weeks time, anyplace would become inhospitable. The AT was a shoe-sucking mess. There are always stret he's where one tries to dance around or over mud puddles. But that can be tedious. So when all hope is lost of keeping your shoes and socks dry, it gets easier to just wade on through it all. Sure, each foot starts to feel like it's wrapped in concrete. But there's no more guesswork about where to land each footfall. Arriving in the rain at the shelter, I quickly found a nice tentsite next to my new friends, Trout Lily and Blossom ( I dub them the Flower Children!)

The AT and every little stream or rivulet was proving that water will find a way. This day of hiking to the trailhead near Bennington has capped several days of the most difficult walking conditions I've experienced anywhere.
