One minute I'm freaking about being away from Arline and the Giz for a while, then I'm excited about finally getting to do this. Not so much worried about the trail, sleeping in a tent, eating ramen or getting rained on for days.....that's all part of it.

Only got about 2 hours of sleep between the lightning, thunder, heavy rain and high winds that sounded like a freight train! General concensus around the shelter this morning was to wait it out in either Blairsville or Dahlonega. I opted for Blairsville and got a shuttle ride from Donald and Chris! Both are past thru hikers, and are the absolute best at taking care of us on the trail! They even made sure I had a hotel room waiting when I got there!

Was happy to see Chris today...I left my gloves in the back of his shuttle Tuesday and he came today dropping off more hikers avoiding the storms.

Once at the top the views were awesome.  It started getting cloudy while we were up there so after some pictures we hauled it down to Neel's Gap. Splitting a cabin at Blood Mtn.

Nothing like starting the day off with a 1.5 mile uphill and 37° temps. The sun was shining and the sky was clear blue! They say Georgia is one of the worst AT states because of all the PUDS (pointless ups and downs) and I agree so far. North Carolina seemed easier and Tennessee was more rolling....can't wait to hit NC probably Tuesday....1st state down...13 more to go! We hit some amazing trail magic at Hog Pen Gap. Had a delicious burger and an ice cold coke! What a spread...the had anything a hiker could want!  Wonderful people doing trail magic out of the goodness of their hearts...there are still good people out there. 5.5 miles later we got to Poplar Stamp and are camping here for the night. 8 mile NERO tomorrow to Hiawassee for laundry and a shower....I smell bad!,"Neel's Gap / Mountain Crossings

Of course that means everyone in the shelter is up too. Started packing up around 6, grabbed my pack off the hook, reached inside and a mouse ran up my arm and back down my leg and across the shelter floor. I put all my food items in my food bag and stored it in the bear box, so there was nothing edible in there. He ate the back pocket out of my rain pants! Guess new ones are gonna be needed! Hiked out....uphill for 2 miles, then finally downhill all the way to Dick's Creek Gap. Got a ride from Bill at Outdoor 76....awesome guy. Today is a very sad day...we're losing Jim, our hiking buddy. He's having some bad knee problems. He was going to get off in Hiawassee, but after a zero he thought he could keep going.

We hit Dick's Creek Gap at 8:30 with 11.7 miles to knock out today. Of course the first 6.5 were all uphill! Georgia wasn't going to let us get out easy! Finally hit the border at 2. Take photos, share photos, etc. Then another climb out of Bly Gap, everyone says it's one of the worst in North Carolina! It just seemed to climb forever. We were hoping to get to Muskrat Creek Shelter and get some space inside, but the entitled 20somethings were spread out, taking up space and didn't want to squeeze up and make room. Shame really.....trail karma is real and tends to bite those types further up the trail. I'll tent tonight, away from the noise The trail itself is really awesome.  The smells of pine and earth is like an air freshener. The sky looks bluer, the mountains look taller. It really has an effect on how you view things. You're huffing and puffing on the uphills, but you know a downhill is coming so it's no big deal. The sunny days are great, but everyday can't be a sunny day....it's gonna rain...deal with it! You're sore in places you didn't know you could be sore, but vitamin I cures all.

The trail became a river, no way to keep your feet dry. My shoes filled up so fast. Right now they're hanging upside down on my poles, hoping they'll drain overnight. We have a ""clothesline"" tied up between two trees covered in soaked smelly hiker clothes. Tomorrow is another 12'er to Rock Gap. Up and over Albert Mountain. Hope the weather is better, would be nice to climb the firetower and get some pictures...it is the unofficial 100 mile mark. Then Monday on to Franklin for a Nero!

About an hour in it started to pour on us again. It didn't stop!! My rain jacket wetted thru so I'll pick up a new one in town. If your rain gear fails, it could be bad. We made it 4.6 miles by 10:45 and decided we were wet enough. Called Bobby the Greek and he picked us up along with another hiker we met at Mooney Gap and took us into Franklin. At the Sapphire Inn for tonight. Heading to Chica and Sunsets hostel tomorrow for a real zero and to dry out. From what the locals are saying, these storms are very unusual and pretty severe this year. We're not falling behind or getting a head.

Went in to Outdoor 76 and got new Altra Olympus 4's and a new rain jacket. The guys at Outdoor 76 are awesome with shoes for hikers.

Water, snacks and TP! No weight=faster hiker! We got to Mooney Gap at 9 and started a 1.4 mile straight up boulder climb of Albert Mountain. 40 minutes we hit the firetower at the top. (Pics posted) Beautiful views, only A.T. hikers get to see....lucky us! All downhill for several miles afterwards so we were getting it. Hit Rock Gap for water and a snack, then on to Wallace Gap, 7 miles by 1. We had 3 miles left to Winding Stair Gap so we started hitting it and rolled in at 2:15. Not our farthest day, but we killed it time wise! Now of course we have a flood warning for tomorrow....the weather has not been our friend.  Heavy rain, high winds, cold front, blah, blah, blah.

We actually had to grab hand over hand to get down some of them. After the boulders it was rocks and roots all the way to NOC! One side of the trail went up, the other side drops off. Some parts are only about 10"" wide. And mud....I hit some slippery stuff and just about went over the edge. My hiking poles have saved me so many times....They're my best friends!

We've been watching the weather closely, bad storms are rolling in from the mid-west in the next couple days. Hiking in the rain is fine, you get used to it pretty quickly.  Packing a wet tent up in the morning sucks! It's heavier, you have to try to get it dry....somehow...during the day. It's your shelter, it keeps you dry and your sleeping bag dry. If it all gets wet, you could be in trouble! Of course we started the morning  hike  with an uphill...Jacob's Ladder! If you see Jacob, please punch him in the mouth for me! It went up, and up and up. We've climbed higher and much worse. I'm not really complaining, the views are spectacular, but it would be nice to have a more level day every once in a while. I know why everyone always says ""up North"" and ""down South""!

The First Baptist Church of Sevierville does a shuttle service for AT hikers for the month of April. It leaves NOC in Gatlinburg at 8:30 and drops at Newfound Gap and Clingman's.  They're so awesome at helping the hikers.  They told us they'll be at Trail Days in Damascus with their portable showers and laundry trailer....woo hoo....free showers and laundry! When we left this morning the temps were in the mid 30's, at Clingman's it was 34° and windy. We froze on the .5 mile hike back up the path to the AT. Once down on the trail it was less windy, but I still hiked in my 250 long sleeve and my rain jacket and gloves all day. 
We were about 5 miles in when we ran into a Ridge runner (work for ATC and NPS, checking permits and walking the trail as eyes on the ground) who checked our permits and told us that at 6000+ elevation temps would hit the teens Friday night and Saturday with snow accumulations.  The next shelter was another 5 miles ahead and above the 6000+! Seems the weather was going to bite us again! We ran thru all the scenarios and decided if we could hitch a ride at Newfound Gap, we'd head back to Gatlinburg and out of the path of the snow. As soon as we walked up a gentleman we had run into days before doing trail maintenance was there and I asked if he was shuttling a hiker. He told me he missed his pick up at Clingman's but had plenty of time to take us to Gatlinburg...what luck!  So now we're back in the Gatlinburg vortex...trying to break out and get out of the Smoky's.

We probably hiked a good 8 miles without a good water source. A few times I started thinking about ice cold sodas, cold chocolate milk and ice cream. It helps the miles go by, especially when you know they're coming up soon. We had already planned to go to Bland on Thursday, but due to the heat and water scarcity we figured we'd see if we could shuttle in today and slack pack tomorrow. So...we called Bubba who shuttles hikers in this area and headed in to the Big Walker Motel, a really nice, cheap hiker hotel. The place was full of hikers we've been hiking around for a while, so it's like being on the trail. We had to walk .3 miles to Subway....keeping it fresh, because the Pizza place didn't have a delivery driver! Tomorrow we'll slack pack back here, then move north and try to catch Bullet and Rosie....he texted me and said he sprained his ankle and is going slow, hoping we'll catch them.","Chestnut Knob Shelter

Started up at 9:30, cooler temps today. We found out why we were sweating so bad yesterday....it was 90°! No water, uphill, big bolder scrambles and 90° make for a really bad day and we had it yesterday! Today was literally a walk in the park. The ups were nice with great switchbacks.  The downhills weren't steep and just so easy. It was a perfect day! We stopped at 11:30 for a break, we've been trying to do that every 2 hours to give my foot a break, and checked Guthook's for distance. We only had a little over 2 miles to go to finish this easy slack pack day! We headed off and around 12:30 we got to the road. There is a .5 mile road walk to Brushy Mountain Outpost. It's a small general store/burger place that all of the hikers hit coming down the mountain.  They carry some resupply stuff, but make killer burgers and fries or onion rings. Plenty of cold drinks....I had 2 Yoohoo's, an Orange soda, a Grape soda, chocolate donuts and some peanut M&M's! (The food mood is real!) Bubba came and shuttled us back to The Big Walker Motel and then we walked to DG for some stuff we needed. We bought 2 $5 backpacks for slack packing to Lick Skillet hostel tomorrow.  It'll be a 15.1 mile hike and Bubba will drop off our packs to Mongo at the hostel.  He said Mongo slack packs hikers up to Pearisburg, so we've been thinking about that too. We could make up some time and avoid the thunderstorms they're predicting for this Memorial Day weekend.Two Knee headed into Bland and the post office and I headed back to the hotel. I decided to hit the Dairy Queen across from the hotel (not much else here) for some burgers. I went up to the door, it was locked with a sign saying ""drive thru only"". Not good for a hiker. I started to walk away and the door opened and a guy asked if I was hiking. I told him I was and he told me to come in. Needless to say, I got my burgers, thanks to the great guy that works there! There is trail magic even in town! The trail always provides!","Va. 615 Laurel Creek

Not Sure,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638054,"We got picked up by Bubba at 8:30 for our shuttle back to the trail. He was dropping our full packs off at Lickskillet Hostel after he dropped us at Brushy Mountain Outpost, where we got off the previous day. Grabbed a cup of coffee at the Outpost and started a 1 mile road walk, part of the trail. I checked Guthook and saw it was going to be a pretty smooth day....minimal ups and downs. The temps weren't too bad, a little humid from the rain last night, but it wasn't raining on us this morning. Every time we'd get a breeze the water up in the leaves would start falling and it would seem like it was. The weather said 70% chance of rain for today, so we knew it was possible. We just kept hiking and kept our fingers crossed.
It took us a few hours but we finally hit another milestone. 600 miles are now in the books. It's hard to believe how far I've come. Seems like yesterday I was hiking up Springer Mountain to start the AT. Huffing and puffing on the uphills, stopping every 100 feet or so to try and catch my breath. Only a few weeks since I had quit smoking! Now I don't stop on the uphills, I just power thru to get to the top....it's easier! My legs are stronger, although my upper body has really lost out on the trip. I think that's where the majority of the 32.5 lbs came from! It's funny...just yesterday I was talking with Gushers about weight loss and we were looking at pictures of us when we started....we were both pretty big. Now we're both pretty slim with jacked legs!
After 12 miles we made it to Jenny Knob Shelter and called Mongo at the hostel. We still had another 1.2 miles to go, but we told him we'd be at the road in 30 minutes. Of course it finally started to rain on us, but just lightly. I had my i-pod cranking and we motored on and met him right on time. The hostel is an old church with 9 bunks, a setup for hammocking, a large hiker area with a kitchen, living room with a TV and sound system, couches and a pool table! I already played a game of pool with Winkie another hiker I met yesterday. He's from New Hampshire. So tomorrow we might slack pack again if Two Knees knee feels better....it's been feeling a little tight he said. Might just need a rest. Supposed to storm, and since this hostel is pretty cheap, might hang and rest. My heel feels great so I'm ready to make some miles when we're ready!
The i-pod song of the day was: It's Alright by Big Head Todd and the Monsters, the live from Red Rocks version with Hazel Miller. It rocks and she's amazing...check it out!","Brushy Mountain Outpost

Not Sure,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638197,"After taking a zero at Lickskillet Hostel so Two Knees knee could heal up and binge watching Ozark on Netflix we headed out this morning at 6:40 for the trail. It was going to be a big mile day to get to Wood's Hole Hostel where we already had made reservations. The trail was really good to us today. The ups were great,  the downs were great. The weather stayed cool and it never rained on us! The miles flew by. We stopped near Dismal Falls for a quick drink and a snack, but decided the .6 miles side trip wasn't worth it. If it had been hot we would have opted for it. It's a great place to go swimming and cool off, but today it was overcast and in the 50's....not in the cards. We pushed on trying to keep up the pace and stay warm. We made great time today, probably our best time to date. My feet haven't felt this good in a while. I think it's because of the Tumeric I started taking after a suggestion from Squatch.  It's a natural anti-inflammatory and really seems to have helped. Two Ibuprofen and 2 Tumeric in the morning and I'm busting out the miles.
We made it to Wood's Hole Hostel around 2:15, got checked in and grabbed our bunks in the bunkhouse.  It's full tonight! We saw signs up near the road telling hikers if they didn't have reservations, they were out of luck. Right now sitting on the porch, just had a cup of fresh ground coffee, it's pretty cold. I don't have long pants....just shorts, but I have my puffy on. We opted for dinner tonight. They supposedly make a mean family style dinner, mostly homemade and grown here on the farm. Tomorrow we'll head out early for our next hike to Pearisburg.  Should be an easy day....the weather is supposed to warm up and no rain forecast!","Lickskillet Hostel

We're in the bubble and every hotel and hostel in the area is filling up days ahead.  We checked a couple this morning and we're told ""sorry....we're full""! It's kind of a bummer....looking forward to hostel hopping and then no go! We figured we'd end up camping just outside of town, then maybe hit it tomorrow.  After about 5 hours of steady hiking and my 3rd fall in the mud we decided to try one more in Pearisburg....Angel's Rest Hiker Haven. It has such a good reputation that most hikers fall into the vortex and stay for days! I texted them from the trail and within a few minutes they texted me back and said Yes! We got their last two bunks.....woohoo! We continued on down the trail and Pan came and picked us up at the road. Got checked in, met everyone and I headed for a shower...I thought a hot one. Not so lucky...they were working on the hot water heater, so my shower was a little cool! I think we're going to slack pack from here tomorrow and then come back. We've got a big section coming up with few shelters and no hostel or hotel breaks. Might as well make the best of it. Stuffing my face at Pizza Plus, then hitting Food Lion for some of my favorite....chocolate milk! I got on the scale at Wood's Hole Hostel and couldn't get past 180 lbs. fully dressed! That's a loss of 34.9 lbs since I started! I feel great, but I'm not used to grabbing medium shirts and 30"" waist shorts from the loaner clothes while I'm doing laundry.

Not Sure,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638402,"Well....We've been slack packing for the past few days. We took it easy on Tuesday and busted it out today with a 16 miler across some serious rocky sections. The weather was still good, cool with some sunshine. The views were another story. We were pretty much hiking in the woods most of the day with no view. Water was another issue. Seems most of the water sources are drying up. I carried enough, 2 1.5l water bottles and my Gatorade from yesterday. 
It was probably 10 miles before we got a view and it was awesome. You can see for at least 100 miles when it's clear....maybe farther! Some of the tops of the mountains have camping areas, which would be perfect on a clear night. The towns below would be all lit up. I've seen a few views like that so far and other nights where the fireflies are out by the thousands! Tonight won't be one of those nights, we're expecting severe thunderstorms thru tomorrow.  We ran into Clothesline and he was trying to get off the ridge before dark tonight. Ran into Crunchy and Gushers on our hike today....always good. We've realized that the major part of the bubble is right here in Virginia, so we get to keep seeing our hiker buddys on a regular basis!

I thought it was going to be an easy day, turned out to be my worst day on the trail so far! It was extremely hot and humid, the rocks were non stop! My feet and knees were killing me! There were absolutely no views at all. I think if I would have passed a bus stop, I would have gotten a bus to Roanoke Airport and said I'm done! Of course I told myself to never quit on a bad day, so I kept hiking on. We finally made it to the shelter, I set up my tent, got some wraps and piled up I needed to sleep today off.

Had a pretty steep uphill climb to Kelly's Knob, it was hot and humid, but the views were spectacular. It was worth the ""120 yards"" off trail as the sign said. We continued on for a while, then turned downhill and past Laurel Creek Shelter and Laurel Creek  where we loaded up the CNOC'S and filtered enough water to make it down to VA 42. We talked about heading to 4 Pines Hostel for the night, hoping to grab a bunk and a shower. Had to cross a couple farm pastures on our way down, out in the bright sun really cooks you. We waited at the road for almost 2 hours for our shuttle, the had a wild ride to the hostel. Good food there, bar-b-que pork sandwiches, Cole slaw, potato salad....yummy.

We seem to cross paths often, had breakfast and dinner with them and look forward to seeing them again up the trail. They're moving north tomorrow and we're going to hike the Triple Crown back to Daleville. Got showered and did laundry, although the washing machine still can't get the funk out of my hiking clothes.  They say you have to wash them 3-4 times in a row to get the funk out. I think mine will be trophies in the garage when I finish. Went to 3 Little Pigs bar-b-que for dinner. Jerk Pork tenderloin was great. Had a real salad which is a treat and the special treat is they give thru hikers free banana pudding for desert. A big bowl with nilla wafers and whipped cream.

I got up and walked it off, thinking it would be OK. We headed up to 311 and started hiking. I really felt pretty good, my heel is almost normal, my knee was great, but my right ankle was definitely a little sore. We made good time, it took us 1.5 hours to do the 4 miles up to McAfee Knob. We got our pictures, ate a snack and laughed at having 16 more to go. I thought I'd take my shoe and sock off to let my ankle rest....big mistake! My ankle was huge! It really was the size of a baseball. I was shocked, I've never had an injury that swelled like that. There was no way I was going to hike 16 more miles on that. When we got dropped off we were told that if it got worse to call and she'd come back....we took that option. We told her it was going to take a while to get back down....it was really starting to hurt. When we got to the parking lot she was waiting. They had ice and when I took my shoe and sock off they all said oh no! There was a new Ridgerunner there too. She gave us our ATC bag tags and gave me an ankle brace to wear.

Not Sure,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639610,"I haven't updated TJ in quite awhile.  It's been a rough couple of weeks. After rolling my ankle in Daleville right before McAfee Knob and then hiking the 8 miles up and back to 311, it was pretty swollen and I was having a hard time putting weight on it. I kept it iced' elevated and wrapped and it seemed to be improving pretty quickly. We headed on to Waynesboro and took a couple more days to rest it before an attempt at Shenandoah National Park and hopefully smoother and less rocky trails. We headed out from Rockfish Gap on 6/9 and hiked 7.8 miles to Calf Mountain Shelter....finally in the Shennies! It was a great feeling....getting closer to half way and Harper's Ferry for our official ATC photo for the Class of 2021 log book! We opted to stay in the shelter, it was supposed to storm that night. The shelter packed up pretty good and there were probably 6-8 tents and hammocks also. Pretty good thunderstorm rolled in after dark and it rained steady until around 5 am. We got up and got packed early, hoping to get 13+ miles to the next shelter. We were the 1st out and down the trail where I loaded up with water at the spring. It didn't take us long to realize the trail was muddy and very slippery.  Everything was wet, just walking and the grass would soak your shoes and legs. That's when we hit a pretty good rocky patch and I started to lose my footing, grabbed to plant my poles and rolled my ankle again! I didn't fall....I caught myself, but I felt and heard my ankle pop. I kind of knew right then that what we had told ourselves since day one, "" one wrong step could end you hike"" was about to be tested.
Of course then it started to rain. Now hiking on in pain and in the rain all I wanted to do was sit down and rest. It was time to head in to town and figure out what I needed to do. I made it to Sawmill Run Overlook on the Skyline Drive, called for a shuttle back to town and said good bye to Gary who needed to continue north. I got back to the hotel, took my shoe off and was shocked at how big my ankle was. It was turning colors up my calf and I knew it was time to get it checked out. 
Flight home, x-ray, MRI confirmed my fears. Fracture, torn tendons, grade 1 sprain, etc.  5 different damages, all keeping me off trail for a little while. Doctor wants to try PT to help it heal faster. He's hoping it will heal without surgery, but it's not off the table yet.
So for now my days are filled with thoughts of the trail. Where would I be, where is Gary, how's the weather for his days hiking. My nights are filled with dreams about hiking the trail, walking everywhere, the hikers I met, the friends I made. The sayings we would say when things were crappy and when they were great too, which was most of the time. It hurts. It's like an ache. I'm not sure if the longing for the trail will fade anytime soon. If I could go back to Daleville and undo that one day, I would in a heartbeat. I'm glad I have Arline and Giz, the kids and grandkids. They make it home and for that I am grateful. For now I'll follow the doctors orders and see if I will get the opportunity to hike again this year.","Calf Mountain Shelter
