Doug and Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632851,"Jody, Levi and I have concluded that this is our year to hike the AT.  Everything is lining up and I am not getting any younger, so would like to take advantage of this open window while it is available.  We intend (hope) to thru hike the entire trail from Georgia to Maine.  It is 2193 miles, so will take us 5+ months.  My wonderful, beautiful wife has been beyond supportive of my bucket list idea, so, MANY MANY thank yous to the greatest, most amazing wife in the history of the universe.  I am so grateful for this opportunity.  I would never be able to repay her for this.  
 We will be doing what is referred to as a 'flip-flop' hike.  Our plan is for Levi and I to take our camper to southern Vermont and park it with my niece (thank you Tim and Beth).  Then we will rent a car one way and drive to Port Clinton PA and start our hike, walking north on April 20.    On May 26 Jody and Gavan will fly to Vermont and meet up with us when we get there (hopefully about the same time).  From there Jody and Gavan will meet up with us via the camper every couple/few days  as we head north.  When we get to Mt. Katahdin, Maine, we will drive back to Port Clinton PA and start south.  Around the third week of July, Jody will need to head back home for school.  We will continue to walk south from there until we get to Springer Mountain, Georgia.

Doug and Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634209,"This past Monday I went over my plan with my manager at work and she was very supportive of everything (thank you Genevieve).  As a contractor there are no assurances of available work in the future, but I was glad for the positive conversation.  My friends at work and church are interested in following the adventure, so that has been fun sharing the details.  One friend from work is planning to join us for some time when we walk through the Great Smoky National Park.  That will definitely be fun.  As of today we are 14 days away from heading out.  I think I am ready.  Yesterday Elijah came home from college for 4 days so we can spend some good time together.  I won't get to see Elijah hardly at all during the summer, so that is the one negative thing for sure.  I am taking a ball cap that he gave me from his school (LeTourneau University) so I will keep him close that way.  He plans on making a trip or two out to see us while we are hiking, so that will be good.

Doug and Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635014,"So Levi thought taking the camper straight from Texas to Vermont was not adequate distance to qualify as a proper road trip so we took a little side road on up to see Niagara Falls. We opted for the night viewing experience at the Falls because 1:  It was night time when we were there, and 2:  There was no #2. The extra miles were definitely worth it though, great views.
While in Buffalo we ate at Applebee’s and had our first proper meal of the weekend.  Levi thought that the revolving menu selection of Diet Coke and beef jerky needed to end. Where has the true Spartan attitude gone?
So after seeing the Falls we found a Walmart parking lot, climbed into the camper and called it a day.  It has been a great first two days though.  The Suburban has towed the camper beautifully and the traveling has been easy 
Tomorrow we will be in Rutland VT where we will park the camper before heading to PA to commence our hike*  Attitude is the difference between an ordeal and an adventure",,View Entry,"Apr 17, Sat",0
Doug and Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635143,"Yesterday we made it to my niece and her husband’s (Beth and Tim) home in Vermont, and had a great dinner, and fun time with their kids.  if you ever want to see some well mannered, happy, respectful kids, just visit their home. This morning we took a rent car one-way down to Reading Pennsylvania, then Uber to the trail. We finally got on the trail at about 4 PM.  This afternoon we hiked four miles through some really rocky hills, but it was a great first few hours on the trail.  For dinner we didn’t do any cooking other than have some tuna on tortillas, peanut butter on tortillas, trail mix, and Cliff bars. Tomorrow we will break out the camp stove and cook real meals. Levi did awesome today, he is a great travel mate. The day was filled with lots of fun bantering. Tomorrow we will be up early and put in probably an 8 to 10 mile day. Everything I read said to start out with low mileage, and work your way up. That is the best way to prevent muscle strains and other injuries. Missing Jody, Elijah and Gavan already. Jody and Gavan will join us for 7 weeks with the camper starting May 26. Elijah will come up a couple of times during the summer for visits as well. Until then it will have to be daily phone calls **  My soul is from elsewhere, I am sure of that, and I intend to end up there.","Port Clinton, PA

Doug and Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635197,"Yesterday was a very nice day but got down to 38 degrees last night so we both had to bundle up in our tents. Today was a beautiful day, all day. We had all sunshine, and BIG rocks on the trail. Many places we went long distances and never touched the ground because we were just going from boulder to Boulder.  When we started out we immediately gained 1000 feet in elevation, then had several more shorter quick elevation gain climbs.  That was a tough way to get warmed up.  When things leveled out we stopped for a snack and met Mr Freeze.  He was a through hiker that started in GA in Feb. The great coincidence was that I have been following Mr Freeze on Trail Journals since he began. It was great to have a fun conversation with him. After 10 miles we were done, so fixed a dinner of rice and salmon (the cheap kind in the packets on the store shelf), chick peas and of course, the requisite tortillas.  Levi is about done with tortillas, so of course I will have to keep bringing it up 🤣. We are at a shelter tonight but using the tent spaces. The nice thing is it has water from a spigot, so No Filtering 👍. That is about all for today.

Doug and Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635279,"had a great night in the tent last night and got up to a beautiful morning. We started the day with another quick ascent. Over the first 2 miles the elevation rose 1500 feet. After that it was another day of lots of rocks. I assured Levi that it was not all like this. We had a goal of making it to a burger joint just off the trail at the 12 mile mark but when I called they said they were not open on Wednesdays☹️ overall it was a good day. We are not close to a shelter or tent site so we just found a flat spot along the trail and set up our tents. Right now it is sleeting, and is supposed to get down to 29° tonight. I guess we are going to see how good my sleeping bag is. I think we are going to be fine.We are three for three of camping without any company so far. Not hardly anybody out on the trail. We only saw one other person today. Had a great dinner of pulled pork and mashed potatoes (and the customary tortilla).

Doug and Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635411,"This morning we woke up with a dusting of snow on the ground and our tents.  It was hard to get out of the sleeping bag because it was going to be a cold experience getting dressed and the camp packed up. We headed out and made good time for the first few miles until we came to the first rock field.  Then it was slow sledding again. When you are picking your way across these fields, trying to find a safe place to step you are moving way less than a mile an hour. We came to an iconic place on the trail called Knife’s Edge.  It is so named because it is a ridge line made up of slabs of rock leaning against each other in an inverted V formation. I took a picture of it but it turned out to be too large of a file to load into the journal.  We did put in a very big day and made it to Palmerton where we will resupply our food. I thought we could make it 6 days on our food but I don’t think we can carry that much.  Friday will be a short day because we will do our laundry and get food in the morning.  I started getting a little frustrated with the rocks until I met a guy headed south and he said we only have about 3 more days of this then the path will be nice. I am going to stop thinking about how many miles we put in each day until then. Our mileage will be good starting early next week and we can make up some time then. While in Palmerton we did stop in and shared an 18 inch meat lovers pizza and 2 liter Root Beer. That definitely hit the spot","Mile Mark 1245.4

Doug and Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635446,"Today we got up, did a load of laundry, had a great breakfast at Bert’s café, and went to the store to re-supply our food. By the time we got all of that done and got back out on the trail it was 12 o’clock noon.  We started out with the trail going up 1000 ft elevation over the first mile, which included what you see in this picture. After that we had some easy miles and some more rocky miles, but a good time for most of the day. Today Levi really got his hiking legs under him. He was chugging along and had an easy time of it.   He felt good and really out performed me.  I was glad for him.  We are camped along side of the trail, ready to close out the Pennsylvania part of the hike. It is a beautiful state, but just lots of difficult paths.  Overall we had a lot of fun, and it was a good day","Palmerton Hostel

Doug and Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635535,"Today we got a good start relatively early and right away saw a white tailed deer. Later we saw two porcupines.  Levi continues to hike along like a wild man. See that’s the difference between a 24-year-old and 61-year-old. I trained for four months on an incline treadmill and stair stepper wearing a 40 pound vest, while he long boarded. I start out relatively ready, and he struggled for the first four days.  Now he is completely up to speed walking circles around me.  Go figure.  But today was a good day.

Doug and Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635633,"Today we packed up in the rain and headed out. We were headed to Wolf Rocks which is typically pretty hazardous.  Yesterday I read that Mr Freeze fell at the rocks and got cut and bruised up pretty good. When we got closer we met another hiker who said he fell on the rocks  this morning. There is an alternate route called Wet Weather Bypass that we decided to take to avoid the wet rocks. On the bypass we found a decent stream to replenish our water. We typically carry a 2 quarts of water, but the last couple of days we have been carrying 4 quarts because of the scarceness. The extra weight isn’t welcome, but neither is being thirsty.  We made it through the day and ended our hiking in PA. Tomorrow we cross over into Néw Jersey.  The hiking is supposed to be nice in NJ so I expect the rocks to stop at the boarder.....  On our first 7 days on the trail we made 75 miles.  I consider that right on target for our first week.

Doug and Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635685,"So today had a U-Turn.  We got up and headed down the trail, and within 1.5 miles Levi’s lower shin hurt so bad he felt like he would not make it to the next town.  He has been struggling with it, but today it was much worse.  We came back into town and found an Orthopedic doctor who had an open slot. Unfortunately he did not have a silver bullet, but did say that if we rested and iced it a couple of days he might be able to go forward,  if we ramped up our miles slower.  Tomorrow we are going to a outfitter shoe store for a pair  of better shoes. If we do all that, it will be the the best we can do to give Levi a chance to continue on.

Doug and Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635816,"So after sitting around for two days waiting for Levi’s ankle to hopefully heal, we made it back on the trail. We decided we would not push it or have an expectation as to how many miles we would cover, so as to not put extra stress  on the ankle. After starting out a little slow Levi felt pretty good and we managed to put in over 13.5 miles, so that was more than expected. First thing we did this morning was cross over the state boundary and are now hiking in New Jersey. The rocks are “better”  but not great. But we did manage to get to our tent site in good time so are just getting ready to fix a dinner of pulled pork, mashed potatoes and chocolate candy.  😊. Once again we are camping alone. We have tented alone every night without anyone being around (except for the guy with the chainsaw, and the banjos that we hear in the distance). In the end, I was very happy to see Levi feeling better and being almost back to his old self. Many thanks for prayers of friends and family. Much appreciated","Delaware Water Gap Borough

It rained on and off all day so everything was pretty wet. Not great for walking across big flat slanted rocks, as my back side found out.

Doug and Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636054,"I am adding this entry a day late because we had no cell service at the shelter we stayed at. Yesterday was a tough go for Levi. He had lots of knee pain and had to take it slow.  I know it was frustrating for him because every time he stepped on a large sharp rock it hurt, so we took it easy and put in a short day. I did make a wardrobe adjustment though.  I had been wearing toe socks to keep my toes from blistering, as some of my toes step on top of each other.  Unfortunately when I would go down a steep hill it would cause my socks to jam up tight in the space between my toes so by the end of the day it hurt there a lot.  Today I taped up my toes and put on some wool socks and it worked a lot better. Yesterday we saw seven deer and a rattlesnake. For supper we fixed mashed potatoes and something that I could not identify. But it is amazing if you add a little habanero to anything, it gives it a nice flavor. Tonight is supposed to get down to 30° so it will be chilly again.

Including the drive to Vermont, we spent 15 days together, just the two of us. While the hiking days were difficult, the evenings were hilarious.  Once we set down the packs and took off our shoes each day we had nothing but crazy fun.

It is not how either of us envisioned the second week ending, but here we are. Todays hiking had a little of everything. We had 2 1/2 miles of easy boardwalk, a good bit of rock free climbs and an excruciating climb that gained 1200 foot of elevation that was all rocks.  It got up to 80 degrees today so was a little warm for strenuous work. I saw a copperhead snake and more deer, but no blackbear yet.  I haven’t figured out what to do for dinner yet, Levi usually took care of that.

The morning was filled with climbing boulders and the afternoon had mostly dirt paths. The path continues to slowly get better with less rocks, although this morning seemed to be an exception. I have increased my daily goal to 17 miles, that is taking a little bit getting used to.  The weather was decent all day with just a brief shower occasionally, but it is raining hard now that I am in my tent.

Doug and Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636400,"It rained most of Monday night so everything was wet Tuesday. I started out going up some big rocks and immediately fell. It always seems to be a bit more impactful when you are carrying a 40 pound pack.  When I set my tent up the night before I tied the tent bag to the side of the tent. That way when the wind blew it would always rub the bag against the tent and make me think something was out there. And it is true, when you are tenting in the  woods, at night, alone, a mouse sounds like a moose. I was the recipient of some nice trail magic. When I crossed New York State Highway 17.  There was a man sitting there with all kinds of goodies. He gave me a huge piece of homemade banana bread, some Gatorade and a big bag of trail mix. It kind of lifted my spirits. Near the end of the day I passed through the famous Lemon Squeezer. It is a rock passage so narrow that you have to take your backpack off and push it in front of you then throw it up on a ledge over your head.  I have read about it many times, but didn’t realize how small it was.","Stealth camping

I am going to take a half-day off tomorrow, then when I get to Kent Connecticut I will take a full day off for resupply.  I did come to a nice deli near the end of the day so bought myself a half pound of pepperoni and a box of crackers with a Poweraid chaser, so I am feasting while I write.","William Brian Shelter

It did rain in the afternoon and while I set up my tent so that was less fun than it might have been. I did walk across a farmers pasture, so shared the trail with some cows. They didn’t seem of mind. Also I realized I have passed 225 miles on the hike. That isn’t impressive compared to the total miles of the hike but is important from a probability perspective. When a person sets out to thru hike the AT they are considered to have less than 20% chance of succeeding, but if they make it past 225 miles they have greater than 50% probability of finishing, as most of the people who quit so it within the first 225 miles.

Then I will resupply on food and visit the trail shoe outfitter to see if he has some kind of pad for my bruised left foot. Today I did start my day off with some classic oatmeal.

I just got down the highway a couple hundred yards when a truck pulled up and offered me a ride into town, of which I gladly accepted. I told him I would put on a Covid mask if he would take off the hockey mask and put down the chain saw.  He dropped me off at the Days Inn, and the friendly guy at the desk allowed me to check in right away, and gave me the hikers discount. I have learned to always ask for the hikers discount for everything, because there often is one. These trail towns are very accommodating to us hiker trash 😁. It was very good to be able to check in in the morning because that way I did not have to go around town with my backpack all day. Plus I got to go up into the room and plug my stuff in and reconnect with Jody and let her know I was back on track. Having to come into town today was not really a loss because I was going to need to stock up two more times before getting to where I am meeting Jody in Vermont anyway, so this was just one of those stops. I will now hike for six days before going to into the next town for re-supply, then five days after that I will be at the Hewitt‘s which where I will meet Jody and Gavan (Yay!!!).

",Great Barrington ,"May 14, Fri",2.21
Doug and Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637150,"So once again last night I seem to have found a stealth camping spot with  no cell coverage. Whenever I do not make a blog update that is usually the reason why. 
So in the morning I make the 2.7 mile walk back to the trail (which do not count towards the daily or cumulative miles because they are not on the trail) and begin to hike on. Again, the great thing about hiking after a resupply day is that you’re full of energy because you have had rest and great food. But now your pack is heavy again because it is fill of groceries. I did realize one thing though and that was my pack was probably heavier today than it will be any other day on the hike going forward. The next time I resupply will only be for five days, then after that Jody will be here for seven weeks for which  I will have a much lighter pack. After she leaves I will have ditched all of my  cold weather gear and it will once again be lighter.  So, easier days ahead.  At least that is what I tell myself. 
So the path was relatively easy today which was good because I had a long walk just to get to the trail. It always amazes me how much the trail can change from mile to mile. When I walk on a flat level path I can walk 2.7 mph with a full pack. When I walk down a steep decline with rocks I go under 1 mph. There have been some days where I have hiked for 13 hours just to complete 15 miles.  Anyway, today was a day of solitude because I saw almost no people all day, stealth camped alone, and did not get to talk to Jody at the end of the day because I had no cell coverage. Some days are just that way. On the upside my foot felt much better.  Hopefully it is a sign of things to come.","Great Barrington

On Sundays people from the surrounding communities tend to hike the trail, so I saw a lot of people earlier in the day. They always want to talk about the dynamics of a thru hike, but that is fine. Everybody is very positive and supportive.  Other than that I am just tenting at a shelter area while it rains outside.","Stealth Campsite

Then another cub comes running towards the same tree, and when he sees me he turns around and runs away as fast as he can.  Fortunately no momma bear shows up before I get my picture and exit the area myself. Other than that it was an uneventful day.  Lots of easy ups and downs. Tomorrow will be another red letter day as the trail will take me through Dalton where they have an ice cream shop and a restaurant that serves from the breakfast menu all day.  I looked forward to that all day today.

Doug and Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637399,"So last night I had an interesting encounter.  When I got to the shelter there was a man, my age, there who was section hiking the opposite direction. We had a great conversation for a couple of hours.  What was interesting was that he worked as the chief editor for the foreign news bureau  at the Washington Post. Here was somebody that was left of liberal, talking with someone from Texas, who I am sure he thought was an extreme conservative who clings to his guns and Bibles. But for those two hours we were just two smelly old men who had a great time talking about hiking, camping, equipment and all-things AT.  He even offered me a shot of rye whiskey from his flask. (That is pretty much an invitation to be family). But, despite our large political and idealogical differences we both very much enjoyed the evening, and the next morning when we packed up, without a thought about the things that would have kept us from having a civil conversation in another setting.  

After leaving camp this morning I hiked four miles that led me through Dalton Massachusetts.  as I went through town I stopped at a restaurant and had a great turkey sandwich, cinnamon muffin, and large coffee. Then they made me a foot-long spicy Italian sub sandwich to go, for my lunch later. Then before leaving town I stopped off at the dollar general store and picked up several Gatorade‘s, payday candy bars, almond chocolate bars, Cliff bars and she cheese crackers. Those things made for a great feasting throughout the day. I ended up at another shelter where a father and son from Boston were section hiking.

Made it to the top of Mount Greylock, and when I went to get the water at the lodge next door it had been shut off. That left me three hours away from the next creek where I could resupply.  I was pretty concerned because I only had very little water remaining. When I got about a mile down the mountain I met a hiker coming from the other way. When I asked if the water was running at the creek they said yes it is, but said they had some extra water and asked me if I wanted some. I was pretty grateful to get an additional pint. That carried me through.  Much of the forest on the trail was burned, from a forest fire that went through the area last week. That didn’t leave much of a path to follow, although I could always follow rock fields, because that seems to be where the paths often goes. It amazes me that someone sees large swaths of rocks going up a steep hill and say “ what a great place for a hiking path”.  In the end I crossed over into Vermont, and now I’m within 85 miles of the Hewitt’s","Mark Noepel Shelter

Doug and Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637536,"Today was a good day because I got to look forward to ending it in a hotel, complete with a shower, air conditioning and a soft bed.  Today I also discovered the notorious Vermont black flies. They love flying into your face and arms and legs and biting you. I have a head net to keep them away from my face, but it doesn’t do anything for my arms and legs. But if this is the worst problem I have, I am doing pretty well. So when I got two miles away from the crossroad that leads to Bennington, I called the hotel and asked if they had a vacancy, if they have a hiker rate and if they provided a shuttle. They answered yes to each of them, so I was in business. When I got to the trail head on the road to Bennington there was a man there waiting to shuttle a different hiker coming from the south. He gave me a Lipton peach iced tea, an apple and a camping chair to sit in. When his hiker arrived and it was time for him to leave I got up to give him back the chair, and he said just keep it and take it to the hotel. That he would  stop by later and pick it up. These small communities are so generous for providing helps to hikers.  And a simple thing like a chair to sit in is really nice when when you’ve been walking up and down hills all day. When I got to the hotel one of the benefits they offer is that they will do your laundry for five dollars. I took them up on the offer.  Now I have clean clothes, had a shower and resupplied enough groceries to get me to the Hewitt’s on Wednesday .

Doug and Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637670,"So since entering Vermont the Appalachian Trail has been using the Vermont Long Trail. It will use it for  a hundred miles or so. One of the things that seems to result in is that the trail is more of a hiking trail as opposed to an obstacle course. There are not these  rock fields for paths.  With two groups of people using the same path there are a lot more people to see these days. Before I would go all day and not see anyone, now I see someone every few hours, at least on the weekends. 
Today was another sunshiny day, which is always great. It is getting in the high 80s and low 90s though so that is fairly warm for hiking. I would use one of the streams to take a bath if it wasn’t for these gnats. Maybe I can find one where there is a nice breeze, that way the gnats won’t be around. Without that, I’m getting pretty smelly. Today’s hike was pretty easy until the last bit when it gained 1000 feet in elevation and then descended  1000 feet going down the other side of the mountain.

The temperature was cool, the mosquitoes and gnats were gone by mid morning and there were only a few steep climbs and descents. I think the gnat and mosquitoes no longer like me because they have realized I have Tabasco and habanero in my veins.  When they finish their  draw and fly away they spontaneously combust.  I was going to do my usual 15 miles today but would have had to stealth camp, and with all the spring growth along the trail there is no where to put up my tent. There was a Shelter at 12 miles, which I took, because the next shelter was 8 miles up the road and I was not prepared to do a 20 mile day.

Today I got to slack pack, meaning I didn’t have anything in my back pack except food, water and an extra coat. Having a light back pack made for easy work of all the inclines. I started off at 800 ft elevation, by the time I was up to 4,000 ft there was snow everywhere.  I had a puffy coat but didn’t bring the gloves so my hands were a little cold.

I did, however make a discovery. I always knew there were 100 difficult miles in Maine that rivaled the Whites.  I had understood that to be 100 Mile Wilderness. Today I realized those miles the first hundred miles encountered in southern Maine as you head north.  So instead of having some normal miles ahead of me, I now have another hundred miles where I won’t be able to get out of first gear.  Jody did provide an excellent solution though. She has put together a plan where she can pick me up more often and we won’t have long days. Just manageable days until we get out of this section.  Today does include climbing Mahoosuc Notch where it gains  1,500 ft altitude in under a mile.  I have 15 miles to do today to get to where Jody picks me up.  It is questionable whether I will be able to get there.

Doug and Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639389,"Today was a microcosm of the full trail experience. I started off in NH and quickly passed into Maine. I ascended to above the tree line much of the morning where it was drizzling sideways with 40-50 mph winds. With my big backpack and wet boulders it pushed me, and knocked me down a few times. By lunch the front had passed through and it was clear and sunny.  I made it to the famed Mahoosuc notch where I went through .8 of a mile of  rock climbing and boulder hopping.  My app says it is the hardest mile on the AT.  I know it took me forever to get through it.  There was still snow at the bottom much of the way as it sees very little sunlight.  Then I climbed up Mahoosuc Arm, which rises 1,500 ft in under a mile. There is a lot of tree root and branch grabbing to get up some of the steep inclines, but made it without incident. After that there was a lot of surprisingly moderate ups and downs, so I made up some time.  I hiked until past sunset so was getting fairly dark in the forest when I finally finished. Overall it was a good day, but am glad to have it behind me","Stealth Camping at Maine Boarder

Doug and Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639430,"So the 100 miles in southern Maine seem to be difficult but not rock field obstacle courses.  Some people like rock hopping but I find not that much fun.  So today was filled with steep inclines and declines but enjoyable because there was a lot of dirt or smooth rock slabs to walk on.  The inclined rock would be difficult in the rain but today was clear skies with great views.  I did spend considerable time above the tree line so had some nice chilly wind but that is preferable to heat. Hiking in 50 degrees is perfect.  When Levi and I hiked in PA we spent considerable time hiking with another hiker with the trail name Timex.  We even took a zero day at the same time so got to know each other well.  He was from southern Maine and was northbound section hiking into New York then heading home.  I texted him yesterday and said I was in Maine.  Turns out he lives close to where Jody had the camper, so he came over in the evening and we spend a couple hours catching up.  It was great to see him and I filled him with questions about the upcoming miles. I think we will continue to do these shorter mileage days during the 100 miles.  We have the time and it allows for me to spend some extended time with Jody and Gavan.","Trailhead at ME26

Doug and Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639511,"Yesterday was another cool and sunny day.  I have had an uncanny run of good weather which is rare for the AT, but glad to have it.  The day started out with a manageable climb up Wyman Mt that had 1,700 ft of elevation gain. Then there was a 20% grade decline  going back down into Sawyer Notch, followed by another 22% incline climb.  There was a lot of hand over hand climbing during parts of it, so it was a challenge.  The trail maintainers have put iron bars in the rocks some places to give you something to hang on to to get over the vertical face rocks. The southern Maine 100 miles definitely earns its reputation.  I lost the trail at one point and had to bushwhack uphill through the trees until I could find it again.  Fortunately my app keeps me from getting seriously lost, but it did cost me a lot of time.  The app uses gps functionality of the phone so I do not need cell phone coverage to use it.  Late in the day I came across an adult black bear.  I was down wind and he did not notice me until he was about 30 feet away. But as soon as he did he immediately turned and ran.  Unfortunately I was not able to get a decent picture.  Saturday will be a zero day so will sleep in and rest.","East B Hill Road Trailhead

I am half ways through the southern Maine 100 and it is proving to not be as difficult as I had feared.  The only real difficult part of the day was at the beginning, the elevation rose 2,200 ft in less than three miles.  Once I got that out of the way everything was more moderate.  The decent’s in Maine are definitely much more manageable than stepping down the rocks, so that is greatness.  It was another sunny day with temps in the 70’s.  They are in a dry spell so I may get out of Maine without getting too wet.

It is my last day to slack pack for the hike so I made it worth my while. Tomorrow I will head out with 3 days (2 nights) supplies to get me through the next section.  Today there were a few steep inclines and declines but the rocks were minimal so stepping down when heading down hill was easy.  I am starting to see some southbound hikers, so I will expect a lot more of that for the rest of Maine.  Mt Katahdin opened up May 27 this year, so people started hiking around June 1.  Being a southbound hiker is rough because you encounter three of the hardest parts of the trail in the first six weeks.  Lots of people do it every year so more power to them.  Actually, lots of people attempt it every year, not so many finish.  Still, good for them.","ME 17

At that point I was thinking I just wanted 15 ft of level ground.  So, I got my wish.  The middle to late part of the day was very moderate, and I was grateful.  At the end I descended 1,000 ft to get out of the night cold wind and found a spot along the side of the trail to pitch my tent.

At lunch I stopped at a trailhead where the trail crossed a road and made lunch.  While there, a truck stopped and a guy got out and talked all about the trail and thru hiking. Before leaving he pulled out a cooler and gave me a fist full of PayDay candy bars and a Pepsi.  Later I looked at the upcoming topography and saw that it was going to be downhill then  fairly level for the next 20 miles , so I shifted up a gear and put in a 19 mile day and got to within 8 miles of the Kennebec River.  You see, on the AT, to cross the Kennebec river you have to be ferried across in a canoe.  There is even a white blaze painted across the bottom of the boat. In June the boat is only working from 9am - 11am, so I have that window to get there tomorrow, otherwise I will have to wait until the next day to cross, or pay a private individual $40 to get me across when they are available.  So I got close enough that I should be able to cross Sunday morning.","Stealth Campsite

So my plans are tomorrow to start a 37 mile section that should take 2.5 days, then I will take a zero, then Jody will drop me off for the start of the 100 Mile Wilderness and she will move the camper north where we will meet when I come out the other end of the 100 miles.","Stealth Campsite

So it was not a bad day after all.  Tomorrow looks to have moderate elevation changes as well, and I keep telling myself that I will walk out of the rocks if I keep going south.  I think we will make it slightly shorter day tomorrow, as we are going to go visit the Hershey chocolate plant in Hershey, PA late in the afternoon.  Actually, it is all about the free samples they give out at the end of the tour.","Port Clinton

I only had a little over 11 miles to do, and the rocks continue to become less and less of an issue, and on top of that  the altitude gains and losses were negligible.  I had a very big breakfast, then started eating my lunch around 10:00.  Proving once again that I can resist anything, but temptation.  When I finished hiking, at the trailhead there was a stash of Gatorades, apples and oranges.  That really hit the spot.  Then we went to the Hershey Chocolate Experience and went through their tour of how the chocolate processing works.  Then we went through their factory store and bought way too much chocolate to take with us (well really there is no such thing as too much, but others would have thought so).  Tomorrow, if I want Jody to pick me up at the end of the day I can either go 11 miles or 25 miles, there are no other roads between.  That is an easy decision because she is only going to be with me a few more days so I am going to go with 11, (that and I have never done a 25 mile day) and I can go back to my regular daily miles once she is gone.","PA 183

Overall the day was fairly easy as I had a few steep ups and downs, but nothing drastic. Got a call from Jody about 2:30. It seems that earlier in the day she had run over a piece of tire and unknowingly it kicked up and hit the trailer electrical plug-in at the back of the Suburban, and knocked the plug out. It drug on the ground until It shaved the plug head off. Now she was in Memphis with no lights or brakes to the trailer. She googled and called a nearby trailer repair place and they helped her out. They fit her in without waiting, put on a new plug end and got her back on the road. That was stressful for her for sure and cost her a couple of hours on the road.  It was stressful for me being 1,000 miles away and not being able to do anything other than to talk through it with her on the phone.

I typically get up when it starts to get light outside, so am getting to sleep in a bit later as the days shorten little by little.  So when I got up I had my three packets of oatmeal and headed out.  When I got to a stream I had  a washcloth bath and put on a clean shirt so when I got to  Boiling Springs I could go into town as clean as possible.  Right on the path was Cafe 101, so I stopped in and had a delicious large  meat lovers omelet.  After that I went across the street to an outfitter and picked up some new shoe gators.  The rest of the day was spent going up and down hills until I got here.  These days have some extended stretches of relatively flat trail so am able to put in a couple extra miles.  We will see how long that lasts.  I will enjoy it as long as it does.","Stealth Campsite

Also, some of the water sources that are supposed to be reliable have proven to be dry. I just need to carry extra water all the time to make sure I don’t run out.

Packing up goes quicker when you stay in a shelter because you don’t have to mess with the tent, plus you can stand up to fold up and put away everything. I got 5 miles down the road and came to Dahlgren Backpack Campground. That is a campground provided by the ATC for backpackers only. What that meant for me was they had showers. So I went in and took advantage of the nice hot showers and put on clean clothes. The clean experience lasted for about 20 minutes, then I was soaked with sweat again. But it was new sweat, not old sweat. The day had quite a bit of difficult altitude changes, but not too many rocks. The one constant was the the gnats.

Right before crossing the Potomac River bridge I stopped and cleaned up a bit in a stream, and put on a clean shirt. Hoping to curb the hiker smell. First thing I did when I got there was to find an outdoor breakfast cafe, and ordered two breakfast sandwiches of bacon, lettuce, tomato, cheese, egg and avocado on sourdough bread, plus large muffin, large coffee, and large lemonade (it’s all about the food). Then I went to the AT Conservancy, and they asked me if I would register my hike with them. I asked them if they would recognize my pre June 1 miles as I started before they relaxed their Covid restrictions. They said no, so I said no. I think ATC took a black eye on their Covid position this year.  Now I needed to find a grocery store to re-supply my food. I thought I had found a place earlier, but upon further review they did not have enough good food selections for meals.  I struck out finding any good store in walking distance both in Harpers Ferry and the next town on the trail.  I also struck out trying to find a shuttle to take me to one further away.  I started walking to an outfitter to see if they had additional names for shuttle drivers, when a random car stops, rolls down their window and asks me if they could give me a ride anywhere. I said “I need to go to Walmart, but I know you’re not going there”.  They looked at each other and said “we can go to Walmart”. So they took me to Walmart and I got my groceries, then they took me back to where they picked me up.  Turns out they were both former through hikers.  Jehova Jihra, for sure.  After that I started south towards Virginia. Tomorrow, at some point I will do the first five miles of the Virginia Roller Coaster.  Then I plan on checking into the Bears Den Hostel to do my laundry and get a shower.

The only thu hikers in the area are the flip floppers headed south.  And if we’re headed in the same direction, going about the same speed, we’re not likely to run into each other.  I did walk through some   heavy rain today. Cannot really complain about that, considering they are in a drought here in Virginia, and it’s been hard to find water. It is just what the area needs, just more of it.    Gretel, I answered the question you posted in the Guest Book.  There is a reply section, so I put it in there.","Stealth Campsite

Doug and Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642153,"So today the trail took me back to my roots. Rock scrambles with big climbs and declines. I ended the day going up a steep 1,000 ft elevation gain, then a 1,300 ft. decline.  The whole day was fairly difficult, it took me 12 hours to go 17 miles. I wouldn’t have gone 17 miles except there really isn’t a place to pitch a tent on the side of this mountain, so I had to make it to a tent site.  I guess that’s just a warm-up for tomorrow, because the first thing I have to do on Tuesday is a climb of 3,000 feet elevation gain up another steep mountain.  The only other noteworthy thing today was I stepped right beside a coiled snake on the path. I didn’t see him until I was right there. I’m pretty sure he was not venomous, but I didn’t really want to get bit anyway.  Water continues to be very short supply. Basically the streams are pretty much dry, but the springs still seem to be producing water. So I plan my day looking for the next available spring.  The days are warm, but they are beautiful. The bugs are not a problem, so hiking it’s pretty good.  Definitely all alone out here these days. day hikers don’t seem to be on these mountains during the week.  Cell phone service is pretty spotty, so my updates may come in groups.

Doug and Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642243,"Well I did not get to make my entry last night because I had no cell phone coverage, and I also forgot to make notes so I could enter them today.  So today’s entry is a bit Spartan.  I do remember getting up in the morning and knowing I had just a small amount of water left, as there was supposed to be a reliable spring a couple miles back, but that proved to not be the case. The next confirmed spring was 8 miles ahead, which was going to be a problem. So I prayed about it and headed out. Not that my prayers are anything special.  About 500 yards down the trail I came across an undocumented stream, it was producing a good amount of water. In my 1,300+ miles of hiking the AT, I have never come across an undocumented stream, so I was pretty surprised. There is a common saying on the trail that says “the trail will provide“ when you need something. I never subscribed to that, but always believed in Jehovah Jireh.  And today more than ever. My apologies for not having more in today’s entry, but my one little tidbit was important to me.","Stealth Campsite

Doug and Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642245,"I always like resupply days because I’m very motivated to get to my pick up spot and get into town. The first thing I do in town is check into the hotel, get a shower, wash some clothes and get to a restaurant for a real meal. The food is a huge motivator, I think about it all morning. Today I came across a spring a few miles before my pick up spot, so I gave myself a washcloth bath and put on a clean shirt. That made it a little more tolerable for the others that had to be around me. Good thing too, because when I got to the hotel they were not able to check me in until 3 o’clock. So I walked across the street to the Waffle House where I had two orders from the breakfast menu. Then I walked over to Walmart got all my resupply needs, and and generous supply of comfort food, then headed back to the hotel. I sat in the lobby eating oatmeal cookies until 3 o’clock rolled around and I could check in. Resupply days can be a little bitter sweet because I like getting cleaned up, restocked and fed, but I end up with some idle time on my hands and it makes me miss Jody and home quite a bit. September 3 is coming up pretty fast though when Jody will be here, so definitely looking forward to spending an extended weekend with her and other family members in North Carolina. In my morning hike I did manage to get my fifth bee sting of the hike. The sides of the trail are loaded with flowering plants, and plants with berries, and pollination is part of that process. And every once in a while some bee doesn’t like the fact that I am passing on by and they give me a sting. Frankly, it hurts a lot for about 30 minutes but nothing to do about that.  Now it is the end of the day and my shuttle driver is going to be here at 7 AM tomorrow, so it is time to finish this entry.  Thanks for following along.","Stealth Campsite

The day started with 6 miles of fairly level terrain, followed by two climbs of 1000 foot elevation gain each. After that I had 4 miles of downhill, and finished the day fairly level again. I am tenting at this place called “the cliffs “, it is a beautiful overlook of  the mountains. We have some good August heat going these days, but almost all the hiking is in the shade.

Virginia has lots of rolling mountains with nice paths.  As a side benefit, today when I came down from one of the mountains and crossed the road, there was some trail magic. Someone left a bunch of personal size Frito Lay chip bags and Gatorade’s. So I took one of each and enjoyed the moment.  The total elevation gain and loss today was 4,800 vertical feet ascended and 4000 vertical feet descended. The temperatures were in the 90s, so it was a day of sweat dripping off my nose and elbows most the day. Tonight when I finished hiking my daily miles, I looked for a tent site and found a relatively level spot beside the trail. I took off my backpack and spread out my tent.  I moved a rock so I could stake down one of the corners and uncovered an underground wasps nest. Unfortunately, the wasps did not like their home rock being moved, and about 10 of them gave me a personal visit to let me know.  Other than that it was a good day of hiking as I chip away at the miles.","The Cliffs tent site

Did not have to many exceptional sightings or things happening. I did pass under the guillotine. That is an iconic spot on the trail. It is just a large round boulder that is lodged between two vertical rock faces that you have to walk under. You kind of wonder if it’s going to stay in place as you pass through, but it’s been there for decades. It is a landmark like the Knifes Edge and the Lemon Squeezer and that I have been by previous.  Water tends to still be very short supply so I’m caring a lot more than I prefer.  We did have rain last night, so the temperatures today were cooler in the morning, but he did get warm later in the afternoon with the benefit of additional humidity.

Doug and Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642429,"So today was an ideal hiking day. The temperatures were fairly cool for mid August in Virginia, there were some ups and downs but they weren’t real high, and the paths were smooth.  I met a northbound hiker early on and he confirmed for me that I had good water sources intermittently throughout the day, so I didn’t have to carry huge amounts.  And I confirmed for him that he was not as in luck, so he needed to camel up and make sure he did not run out.  Somehow he didn’t seem as happy as I was after the exchange.  The AT crossed and paralleled the Blue Ridge Parkway a good part of the day so I ended up seeing many of the same sites and overlooks, so that was nice.  Early in the afternoon I came out of the woods at a trail head and there was a man sitting in a chair at the back of his truck in the parking lot, and asked me how long I had been on the trail. When I told him, he asked me if I wanted a drink and a snack. So I sat and join him for 30 minutes and talked about the trail while I enjoyed the root beer and 2 packs of Oreos that he gave me.  I actually made it to a shelter tonight, and when I arrived there was a large group of people at it, so I just went to a tent site and set my pack down. One lady came over to me and said they weren’t staying they were just a family having a picnic, and they will be leaving soon. And she asked me if I wanted to roast a hotdog and have some snacks. So I join them and had some hotdogs, Frito chips, Hersheys chocolate bar and a Dr. Pepper. So another fine trail angel moment.  Tomorrow is resupply day. It’s hard to believe it’s been five days since I restocked on groceries. So I will hike to Daleville where I have a reservation (with a hiker discount) at the Howard Johnsons.  I will take the afternoon to get a shower, do my laundry, restock groceries and sleep the night in air  conditioning.","Stealth Campsite by Jennings Creek

It rained all night last night, but I was inside the shelter by myself so no worries. It’s always an easy hike right before resupply because I am out of food. I only carry enough water to get me to town, so my pack is light.  It rained most of the morning as I walked to Daleville.  The rain always helps the water supply, so I’m glad to see it. Once at the hotel I see why it is heavily discounted. It is hard to believe this hotel stays open it is so run down. But the sheets are clean, the shower is warm, and the air conditioning is cool, so it is kind of luxurious compared to the trail. I washed my clothes at the hotel laundry and headed down the street for some barbecue, which did not disappoint.

The weather continues to be moderate, and the trail continues to be rock free. So I am enjoying the experience. With the temperature differences between the ground and air, and high humidity, it was foggy in the forest today. Making a Sleepy Hollow kind of experience. Late in the day the front came through, bringing heavy rain, which is good for the water supply. I walked in the rain a couple hours, then made it to the shelter. I am here alone again, so spread out and letting stuff dry, as much as it well with the high humidity. I did make it to McAfee Knob today. It is probably the most photographed place on the Appalachian Trail. And it is supposed to give you one of the best views of Virginia from the trail. With the trail in the clouds today, there was no view.

Was a little humid for a while but later in the day a nice breeze came up with mild temperatures so it was quite pleasant.  All of this rain has caused the creeks to have water again so that is greatness. Today I crossed the 1,493 mile mark. Leaving less than 700 miles to hike. The morning hike was relatively easy, but right after lunch I made a steep 1,200 foot climb through rocks.  That left me a little worn out. I ended up not getting even 16 miles, but that’s how some days are. 15 days until Jody flies in. We are going to drive to Sara‘s house (my sisters daughter), where we will meet up with my mother, then my sister Leslie and her husband Bruce will come Sunday afternoon.

But that’s OK, because that means nothing exceptional happened to hold me up or slow me down or cause me trouble. The recent rains continue to help the water situation, most places. Yesterday it rained much of the afternoon.  Some places the grass and foliage is completely overgrown on the trail so your legs and arms and your feet stay wet. None of that matters too much, except you take your shoes and socks off at night and wring a considerable amount of water out of your socks, and they don’t dry by morning because of the humidity.  So nothing says “warm and cozy” quite like putting on wet socks and shoes first thing.  Nothing to complain about really though, this is just part of the hiker experience. I have actually had relatively little rain and water to deal with, so wet clothes have been minimal for me compared to the experience of most through hikers. Sunday is a resupply day for me again, unbelievable that it will have been six days already since last time.  I see there is a Dairy Queen next to the Food Lion grocery store in town so there is absolutely a large chocolate extreme blizzard in my future.  Yes I think about food a lot.

I had this argument with myself about calling a shuttle for that mile and a half and decided I would walk it, but I really didn’t want to. When I got to the parking lot there was a man looking at the trail map and inquired about my trip.  When I told him I was heading into Pearisburg he offerd to give me a ride.  There was no polite declining on my part, I gladly took them up on the offer. In town I did the usual washing clothes, getting a shower, recharging my electronics, buying groceries, and of course a big meal.  I love the big meal part. Today was Sunday, and in this small town there was no store open that carried canister fuel. I have a day or two of fuel left, so I had to re-supply mostly with groceries that do not require cooking. We will see how good I did at that. Should be interesting.  The hard part of a resupply day is, once you have all your chores done you have some idle time. You go outside and see everybody with their families, that really makes you miss your own family. Jody and I solidified our plans for getting me home at the end of the hike. She is planning on picking me up at Springer Mt. Georgia on October 10. That has some buffer time built-in so if the Georgia mountains slow me down a little bit, I should be fine.

It pretty much just gives a place for the mice to hang out and bother humans.  I only stay in a shelter if one lines up with my daily mileage requirement, and if no one else is already there when I get there.  Today started out on a good note.  I got to put on clean dry socks, into dry shoes. Made my feet feel better just thinking about it.  I headed out the door at 6 AM and walked straight into Dairy Queen, for a breakfast platter meal.  Then I made the mile and a half walk back to the trail. Of course, first on the agenda was a mountain with a 2,000 foot elevation gain. Tough way to start the day when you have full pack of food and are still carrying extra water. I eventually made it to the top, and the rest the day was easier, with minor ups and downs.  I actually walked farther than intended today. I needed to find water before stopping, so I could have supper. Then after that I needed to find a level piece of ground for my tent. I found the water at about 17 miles, but didn’t find level ground coming down the side of that mountain. So I kept going until I came to the shelter, which I’m glad I did.  Every time I ate something out of my pack, I always thought “that should make it a little lighter”.  I know, most of all of that is it in my head, but I have to shape the thoughts to what makes the pack feel lighter.  That’s about all I know, more hiking tomorrow","Pearisburg, VA

You just leave everything that is out on the shelter floor and you only have to roll up your sleeping pad and put your few things away in the backpack and away you go. I made good progress all morning as the path was easy, and I had easy access to water. I did notice that my next water was 20 miles away, so that’s not much fun. I found the gas station/deli a half mile up the road where the AT crosses the highway, so I went off trail for that mile and re-supplied with water and got a couple cheeseburgers and Gatorade’s. They also had canister fuel so I picked that up right away. The afternoon climbs were very arduous so progress was slow. Today was over 90° again so it made for slow sledding most of the afternoon.

It was great to see and catch up with everyone.   My nephew  Daniel and his wife and family joined us as well on Monday. My mother made homemade rolls, cookies, salted nut rolls and kuchen . So  along with all the meals that Sarah provided, we ate like kings. Taking a rest from the trail, and getting to see Jody for six days was a dream.  It was very hard to drop her off at the airport today.  I got a ride back to the trail late in the afternoon and manage to get five quick miles of hiking in. There is a lot of bear activity around here so there are restrictions as to where and how you can camp. I opted to stealth camp again, with the hope of finding a good tree to hang my bear bag. I did not find a tree, but there was a tall bridge near me that I hung my bag down on a long line from. I am thinking it should be good there till morning. At least it is not inside my tent.

I got him to leave, but will definitely be hanging my food from a high extended tree branch tonight. Tomorrow I walk through a 13 mile stretch where all overnight camping has been prohibited due to aggressive bear activity.  Which is just to say they want your food.

In retrospect it would’ve been nice to do. I started and ended my day in my puffy coat. I had Jody take it home when she left in July, but ask her to bring it back on September 2 when she came for the visit. I’m really glad I asked her to bring it because between now and October 9 there are probably going to be a lot of cool days.There were a lot of blueberries along the side of the trail today. I know lots of people eat them, along with certain mushrooms that grow wild. I don’t eat any thing wild because I would probably make some mistake and end up like Chris McCandless.  They say if your blueberries taste salty it is because you picked them too close to the edge of the trail. Another mistake I don’t want to make.  Tomorrow there is a place to re-supply that is along the side of the trail, at about the 13 mile mark of my day. I think I will take it because it allows me to re-supply and not loose most of a day.  That will get me to Erwin, where the trail again walks right through the middle of town.

The only state remaining that I have not been in is the last one, Georgia. I ran into an old hiker acquaintance again today named “one eyed Jack “. I first met him when we were both heading north, in Kent Connecticut. After that we leapfrogged a few times in Massachusetts and Vermont, and then I saw he submitted Mt.

So when I ran into him I asked him what he was doing back on the trail and he explained he had the same route that I did. It was good to see an old face, I see so few people. I am now on my seventh consecutive week of tenting, sheltering, or camping at night near nobody except three people.  That is mostly because I stealth camp most nights.  I might meet one or two people on the trail in a day, but that results in a 0-2 minute conversation.  I should have made my trail name “monk “, because it has absolutely been a hike of solitude.

The difference between connecting with your family and feeling good about the day and sitting in your tent all evening not being able to talk to anybody, is your cell phone coverage.   It is interesting peoples reactions to finding out you are a through hiker as you get closer to the end.

From the looks of the plan Jody will pick me up late Thursday afternoon, October 7. The end is near.","Stealth Campsite

Doug and Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644689,"So today was my final resupply in town. I found out yesterday that if I could get to the screening clinic in Franklin before 3 o’clock I could do my drug screening on Thursday and get back out on the trail sooner on Friday. So all morning and early afternoon Thursday I speed hiked so I could get finished in time to get to the clinic. That part of the plan worked.  I got done early, got my ride into town, and got over the clinic by 2:30, only to find out the testing person went home at 2 o’clock. Oh well, that gave me more time to go downtown and find a good burger place and have strawberry shake and a hamburger with bacon and cheese, and lettuce and tomato and onions and an egg (over easy) on top. That alone can cure most ills.  So far I got my shower, my food shopping done, clothes washed, and electronics are charging as I write. Tomorrow morning I have a 7:15 AM appointment at the clinic and then my ride will pick me up at 8:30 and I will commence my last week on the trail.  Since September 7, I have been counting the days and weeks until I will get to see Jody again. Yesterday it occurred to me for the first time that, I will be home next week.  Time to start shifting gears.","Stealth Campsite

Doug and Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644720,"This morning I got everything done and was back on the trail by 8:30.  And the day turned out to be a textbook kind of hiking day. The weather was perfect, and the inclines/declines were very manageable. Even though I got a late start, I still got 16 miles in.  I crossed over the 100 mile mark, and have 93 miles remaining. The only logistics I have left, is to make sure I get to Neel gap during the business part of the day, as I want to top off my resupply and get a hamburger or three.  I’m having to be careful conserve power because for this last stretch I am going seven days without getting recharged. So at night I turn my Garman and phone off to help with the effort. Usually I leave one of them on in case someone wants to get in touch with me.      Saturday topography looks to be pretty moderate. The weather also looks good, so I’m looking forward to a great day.","Franklin, NC

Doug and Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644767,"Today I crossed over into Georgia, and at this point I am only 75 miles from Springer Mountain. That is merely an ultra marathon away from being done. If I had any spunk I would drop my pack and run to Springer Mountain and be there in two days.  
Today was a beautiful fall day. The temperatures continue to be moderate to cool, and the day was all sunshine (but I do understand that is about to end with rain coming my way for the next few days).  The path gets interesting from here to the end. Basically there’s a lot of terrain where it is 500 feet ascent 500 feet descent, 1,000 feet up, 1,000 feet down. I am pretty motivated by my proximity to the finish line, so I’m sure I will make it through just fine. Five days to go.","Stealth Campsite

Doug and Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644817,"Today had the predicted steep and repetitive ups and downs, but the backpack is pretty light so it has not been a problem. I timed my food to run out on Tuesday when I walk into Neels Gap. At that point I will top off my food for the final two days of the hike.Today I channeled my inner Red Auerbach and smoked a metaphorical cigar. Years ago when  Red was the coach of the Boston Celtics he had a habit of pulling a cigar out of his suit coat pocket and lighting it late in a game when a win was assured.  He would then sit back and enjoy the final minutes of the game. I feel like for my hike, the outcome is finally assured. Up until now I have felt like there were were many things that could have taken me off the trail, mostly injury or illness related. But with three days remaining I seem to have survived all of that and get to finish my final 58 miles in confidence.  Between 75% and 80% of the people who attempt a thru hike never finish. As a 62-year-old who never hiked or backpacked before, the odds were definitely not in my favor. But here we are.","Stealth Campsite

Doug and Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644842,"Georgia continues to be surprisingly challenging. I knew there were a lot of difficult ups and downs, at least more than in North Carolina or Tennessee, but the steep grade has surprised me a little bit. I had figured that the people who complained about the difficulty had just not gotten their trail legs under them yet.  But it certainly has given me everything I care to handle.  These last few days of the trip I will get to take my foot off the gas a little bit. No need to put in 17 mile days every day, I just need to end up at Springer Mountain on Thursday afternoon. I had planned on spending the night at a shelter just down the path, but by the time I finished cooking dinner and getting everything  around, there were six other people there. I am not a fan of staying in a full shelter, so I excused myself and packed up my stuff and headed down the path another mile to a stealth site.  Fortunately there was a pause in the rain and I  set my tent up with out a problem. I will probably have to pack up in the rain in the morning though. There are certainly worse things than that.  Tomorrow will be a short day as I will arrive at Neels gap.  Definitely looking forward to some food from their grill and anything else they have in the store that is fun to eat.  Three days until done.","Tray Mountain Shelter

Doug and Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644862,"So it seems like today was miniature boat derby day on the AT foot trail again. It rained hard and steady all morning, and then a lighter in the afternoon. There were some miniature class three rapids the trail was so deep and fast with water. At first you try to walk along the side of the trail to minimize the the water on your shoes. But by mid morning when you feel the water squishing between your toes inside your shoe you know the cause is lost, and you just slog down the middle of the trail the rest of the day. But no doubt, it is easier to endure three days of rain when it is the end of your hike, rather than when there are still 500 or 1,000 miles left. It does look like it will rain the final two days of my hike as well, but that’s part of the journey.  I did walk past Neels gap today and loaded up on my final two days of food. I made  sure I got a generous supply of the much-needed vitamin C1 and C2 (chocolate and cookies).  I got also got some for my food bag as well, so I can enjoy the last two days with some comfort food. When you are down 30 lbs. from when you started the hike you can do that.  Georgia continues to give me some steep ups and downs, but even though I’m walking it in difficult weather it is easy to negotiate because now I only have two days left. As of tonight I’m sitting 32 miles away from the finish.  I have thoroughly enjoyed the experience of hiking the trail, but I am ready to go home.  Life is good","Stealth Campsite

Doug and Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644900,"Started out the day with it not raining which was great because it was dark out which made it that much easier to see with the headlamp. It rained most of the night though so trail was already full of water. I rock hopped  for the first few hours trying to keep my shoes and socks dry, but again, after a while the inevitable becomes apparent, and I feel better once I give up hope. Made it to the top of blood mountain, which at 4,442 feet was the last significant climb of the AT for me as a south bounder. The hourly forecast shows greater than 80% chance of rain for every hour for the rest of the day, but by 2pm it stopped raining and never rained again until 7 PM when it resumed, but by that time I had my tent set up and was comfortably inside.  Tonight is my last night on the trail, and I am camping at Justice Creek, and fittingly, I am stealth camping with nobody around.  With all the rain we’ve been having the creek is really high so I had to put on my crocs and wade through the water using my trekking polls keep my balance.  I got to the other side and set up my tent. Tomorrow I have 14 miles to go. Jody and Gavan are on their way here and we should all be getting to Springer Mountain about the same same time in the early afternoon.  Definitely looking forward to that.","Neels Gap

Doug and Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644915,"So today I completed hiking the Appalachian Trail.  I really should say ‘we’ completed hiking the trail.  I absolutely could not have done it without Jody’s help and support.  I am beyond grateful for everything she did for me to help me get across the finish line.  This morning I could not sleep, so at 4am I got up, packed up for the final time, and headed out. Today was only 14 miles, so was easy from that perspective. It rained most of the day as predicted, but the rain was easy to take, knowing I would see Jody and Gavin shortly and was headed for a hot shower, soft bed and good meal.  The trail had a lot of people on it, so that helped pass the miles more easily.  All day hikers and section hikers.  Jody picked me up as planned and the grand adventure was over. Tomorrow I will write some post hike concluding comments, but I have a request for you. If you have followed my blog for at least part of my journey would you sign my guest book?  You can find it in the menu.  Most of the fields are optional, so just fill in at least name, city and stare.  Thanks so much for following along. It has been an amazing journey.","Stealth Campsite

Doug and Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644955,"Well I am home from my AT journey. Hard to believe that more than 5 1/2 months have passed since I left. I was telling Jody that one of the things that I missed while on the trail was chairs with backrests. When sitting, it was always on a log, or boulder, or the floor of my tent, and my back would always get tired. I got on the scale a bit ago and indeed, I lost almost exactly 30 lbs.  No wonder when I got home the dog was skeptical that it was really me.  Thank you to those that signed my guestbook. It was great to hear from all of you, especially some of you that I met along the way. Hiking the trail was a grand adventure. It was harder than I thought it would be. It got really hard being away from my family. But we are together again now.  Besides the weight loss and loosing eight toenails, the only physical recovery for me to have, is to get back the feeling on the bottom front part of my feet and toes. I am told that feeling loss is typical for a thru hike, and the feeling will return. I get to go back to the job I left in April, so I am excited about that. I was a contractor and they had no obligation to have me back, but it worked out, and I am grateful. Thank you to each of you that followed my blog. When I would see the number of views increase each day, it made me feel like I had company with me on my trip. This is my last blog entry. It is time to go forward with ‘normal’ life, and to focus on my family.  All the best to each of you.",,View Entry,"Oct 08, Fri",0
