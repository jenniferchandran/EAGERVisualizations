Ahab,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639040,"This is ""drive day"", the day in which I drive down to my trail head. As the years have gone on and I have positioned myself closer to home, I have been able to get more and more miles in on the trail on drive day. I remember the very first drive day, Lil and I made it to Springer Mountain late at night and very disoriented. We slept in the van and started the next morning. This little distance has taken out a lot of back roads around mountains and forest service roads, making drive day much more productive.  This year I was able to get in 7.7 miles on drive day, which is not a bad day of hiking on anyone's terms.
Gina dropped me off at I-40 and Green Corner Road at 3:30 and I took to the trail immediately after changing clothes. Like any gap in the mountains, the trail always heads up, and up, and up I went for several hours. I knew this climb was coming and I was mentally prepared for the rigors of the climb. I passed ""Jen"" about .25 miles up the trail and I kept on walking, never to cross trails with her again for the remainder of the week. She entered the trail as I was getting ready and saying goodbye to my wife. 
The trail quickly became familiar, the constant step after step, and the familiar smell of decaying leaves. Interstate 40 was humming in the background like a big monster and I was looking forward to when I could not hear civilization. The temperature was 80 (ish) with no rain, so I was happy to be out, finally, after 8 years of surgeries. Before I knew it, I was ready for my first break and as I sat there resting I realized that I-40 was gone. I could hear the song of the woods, which consists of the birds, squirrels, and bee's moving about doing their daily routine. I continued with my hike to the top of Snowbird Mountain (4,263 feet) and as I neared the top, the trees gave way to the underbrush and then the bald. It is truly amazing how the trees stop growing at an elevation and the little vegetation takes over until that gives way to grass and then nothing. On the top, someone erected an awesome AT sign where the T made the cross-bar of the A and the bottom of the T was the pole holding it upright from the ground. I was not prepared to see the the giant bowling pin looking thing on top of the mountain and had no idea what it was at the time. I did know that I did not want to spend any time near it, as I am sure it was producing something that would later cause cancer, so I moved on quickly. Later this night in the shelter, I was discussing this with the rest of the people and I was told it was an Aviation Radar station to track planes outside of the radar signature of Nashville, etc.  
It was several more hours until I made my way into Groundhog Creek Shelter. The walk off the mountain was not much fun since there were no views/vistas, and the constant downhill was getting to my toes. In addition to growing tired, I felt like I was in a race against the sunset, which is not a good feeling. I knew that I did not want to arrive in camp after dark. I finally came across a family camping and I asked the gentlemen how much further. He pointed over my shoulder and said ""100 feet"".  Ok, so I knew I was close, but that was close, so I thought. The sign said "".25 miles down"", so I knew that was an extra half mile add on to the trail in the end. 
I was very tired and no overly hungry, so I took a quick break and settle for a Protein Bar and a lot of water. After dinner, I set up my tent behind the shelter against the advice of a boyscout who thought I was too close tot he bear line. I'll take my chances because I am not moving my tent at this point.  The noise of the shelter turned to silence and then the silence turned to darkness. After I was all set up and ready for bed, I set up my trail camera in hopes of seeing something in the night. My hips hurt and I am in need of some Chapstick, but other than that, I am well and I feel very safe.","I-40

Ahab,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639042,"I woke up this morning at 0608 on my own and was the first stirring in the camp. I sat there in my tent wondering what had happened last night, as sleeping out in the woods is supposed to result in a restful, wonderful night sleep.  I would classify last night as the worst night of sleep I have ever encountered on the trail or anywhere other than my own bed.  So, what happened? It felt like minutes after I went to sleep, I heard a loud breaking noise and I knew exactly what it was because I spent my childhood evenings cutting down trees in the farmers tree-lines that outline their fields.  This was the sound of a very large tree breaking in half.  Why, on a calm, quiet night, is a large tree breaking in half?  I am  still not sure, but I am sure of where it fell. After the loud break, the tree began to fall, letting out the normal breaking, snapping, crushing sounds that large trees make when they are on their way down.  I curled up in a ball as small as my fake knee would allow and prayed it would be short of my tent.  I could hear it bounce and I knew that I was in the clear.  I could see through my tent that other hikers were awake and the flashlights started coming on from each one. I called out and asked if everyone was ok, and I got a few answers. Two of the other hikers got out of their tent and went to look at the tree. This tree had fallen into the middle of the tents without touching any of them. The funny story behind this is, as you recall from yesterday's journal, I ate dinner with a young man that worked tree trimming with his father. We specifically discussed trees falling on people and he assured me that this type of accident was ""rare"".  Rare turns out to be several thousand people die around the globe, which would include limbs of trees and tree debris. Good enough for me - I now check trees near my camp for damage or rot and I now pick my spot very carefully. So back at the ranch, what is going on?
Sometime around 0200 in the morning, an owl takes up residence in a tree just down the drawl from our camp. The owl is the typical variety for the area and starts in with its questioning of ""who cooks for you?""  As this questions was asked, over, and over, and over, and you get the idea, I was beginning to wonder if I needed to get out of my tent and go find this feathered friend and send him on his way. Then I heard something yelling back. Whenever the owl started with questioning, this unknown creature squawked back in some kind of disagreement. While entertaining, I had to sleep so sometime during this debate, I drifted off to sleep. Then 0243 came and just above my tent and up the hill several feet (yes feet) came an awful yelp that woke me to 100% and sent goosebumps running all over my body. I have spent countless hours at night in the woods being retired from the Marine Corps and nights on the Appalachian Trail, and I have never heard anything that sounded like this scream. Moving ahead, I did a lot of internet searches for that sound when I got home and I am still unable to identify the culprit. However, if you imagine a scary witch in a white night gown running through the woods, you have the a close idea of what that sounded like, the only problem is mine was real and you are imagining things.  Needless to say, it took me a while to go back to sleep after that awakening.  
At 0802 I had cleaned up my camp and took my first steps towards Max Patch and Roaring Fork Shelter.  Like most shelter locations on the trail, the morning was met with a great climb and difficult terrain. I hiked from Groundhog Creek Shelter towards Brown Gap and for the most part it was deep in the forest and over-grown. From Browns Gap to Max Patch could possibly be the hardest section of the Appalachian Trail. If not the hardest, it ranks up there on difficulty. Hikers were literally hiking from Blaze to Blaze, resting, and then going to the next Blaze and resting. It was difficult. The trail seemed very steep and tended to go straight up the mountain side. I did manage to take a lot of photos and I rested a lot, which is why I was able to finish. I had lunch that day on 1182 with the company of a few folks from the Appalachian Trail Conservatory.  They took my trash, which is trail magic, and made for good conversation. After lunch I headed up the hill towards Max Patch, which is one of the most prize destinations on the trail so far (Clingman's Dome, Nantahala Outdoor Center were others).  The trail leading up to Max Patch was a climb and just before the summit there's a series of steps. These steps on their own were not a big deal, but being tired from the days hike was seriously slowing my progress. Then there is the issue of my knee not wanting to bend or pull my weight up to the next level. At last, Max Patch summit was upon me and everything from the day sort of fell off like water running from a Ducks back. The 360 degree views are breath-taking and there is nothing up there but clean air and nature. The panoramic view of the mountains is amazing. Layer upon layer of mountains filled the background so far in the distance that you could not seem them anymore. As each set up mountains fell behind the next, they became a slightly lighter shade of blue and presented themselves to you like something from a great painting. This feeling, I thought to myself, was what drew people like John Muir, Lewis & Clark, and Daniel Boone to the wilderness. The sound of nature (or nothing) was inviting and I knew this was a place I needed to spend some time. I am very thankful that I had the opportunity to experience this place and it is something that I will not soon forget. I pulled out my sleeping mat, water, and pillow. I settled in the patch and set a timer for one hour. I knew that I had to limit my time or I could have possibly spend the rest of the week right here on the mountain top. I drifted off to sleep for some time and was happy to be me that day. 
After several hours on the top, I started to make my way down the trail towards Roaring Fork Shelter. The trail dropped off into the valley quickly and I found myself walking along a stream filled with Rhododendron bushes. The rhododendron were so thick, they made tunnels in various sections. You can see a good example of these in my photos from the day. Compared to where I was coming from, the trail seemed very easy to hike (flat) and had a lot of scenery. I followed the trail down to the shelter where I finally stumbled in around 5pm. The shelter is just off the trail (not .2 miles down) and very nice. It was already occupied by a great American from Ohio. He is a police officer in a small town and a former Marine. We immediately hit it off and I think I talked too much to the poor guy. He was section hiking the trail from Brown Gap to Lemon Gap and then back, as he did not have a lot time and was doing things solo. We were later joined by a family hiking with two small boys and two other gentlemen who were just interested in sleeping. The first set up a 20-person tent at the top of the hill, a place my police officer friend kept referring to as the Taj Mahal, and the other was an older gentlemen that was very nice. Finally there was Thru-hiker who agreed that he was very late in the season for the activity, but insisted on going anyhow. He said he had to manage 16 miles per day - every day - for the next 128 days to finish before October 15th (winter deadline).  I'll call him sleeper.  Nice, young guy that was very happy to be part of the great adventure.
I was able to rest the remainder of the afternoon and do some maintenance on my gear. I decided to sleep in the shelter that night and not set up my tent, which I knew was a mistake, but I did it anyhow. The mice leave me unsettled and I never get a good nights sleep. I so needed one because of the night before, but as past experience has shown, things do not go well in shelters.","Groundhog Creek Shelter

Ahab,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641275,"Woke again at 0620, which seems to be my 'natural' time for getting up on the trail. Not much different than back at home, but the everything feels better when not using alarm clocks, for whatever reason. I would like to say that I was the first one awake at the shelter, but I never really went to sleep, so I'm not sure if I can claim that title. It seemed like every muscle in my body was hurting at the same time, and I'm not sure if this is even possible, but it was happening. If you had to pick one, sleeping or walking with a pack, which one do you think would hurt worse?  Of course, sleeping - only makes sense, right? I question where my body got the energy last night to hurt so much. I'm sure that I would wake up 50 lbs less because of the calories burned from hurting. So while I was on over watch for the camp last night, I heard the guy in the 50 person tent yell ""no"" in the middle of the night and then a twig broke. I wasn't sure what was going on there, but that was it for the excitement. I had my trail camera set up again in hopes of capturing bigfoot photos but I just snapped a few photos of me checking my pack. I got out of bed around 1am because I thought it was raining. It turns out that the noise was just the wind, which was awesome. Nothing else to do and the sun up ""enough"", I broke camp at 0800 and began my days journey to what I thought would be Big Rock Spring, some 9 miles up the trail to the north. The morning was uneventful and the trail followed a well-established stream through the thicket.  In the photo's you'll see a series of bridges that cross this stream. I think there were about 9 in total, they are well built and safe to cross. From Roaring Fork to Lemon Gap, the trail is relatively flat. I was very happy to be walking along this section because it gave my body a serious break from climbing. I enjoyed the flatness, as this was the flattest section of trail that I've walked on since Springer Mt. 
Lemon Gap was just a spot near a gravel road where the trail crossed. There's absolutely nothing there except a place to park your car. Plenty of room for cars, in fact.  I knew I was in for a climb out of Lemon Gap, so I took a break and had some lunch. The trail is supposed to be something like 800 feet elevation gain over 1.5 miles, it was arduous and tiresome to me. Others zipped right up the hill and walked out of sight, but my body had it's own pace in mind, so I went with it. The elevation dropped back down and the real climb started. I think it was Bluff Mountain that I was headed up. I was not surprised when I found myself walking short distances and then taking a break. At the end, I rate it as the second hardest climb of the trip.  I had to walk from blaze to blaze again, resting at each one as I got to its level. The top opened to a meadow that is unkept. No trees, lots of grass, but the grass is tall. After I crossed it, the trail went back into the woods and up to the summit. I was making my way up the trail and had to navigate a few switchbacks. As I rounded a corner over a finger, I stopped to enjoy the view and take a breath before continuing on. I was standing there looking out over the hillside and movement caught the corner of my left eye. I hiker and his black lab passed me a few miles back and I though I stumbled upon him taking a break. As the black lab rounded the corner, out from behind an evergreen tree, I could see that the lab was actually a Black Bear! I was within 20 feet of the bear at this point and it was still smelling the ground, snout to the ground as it kept getting closer. Not wanting to scare it, I did the best I could to get its attention without a startle. It must have heard me swallow because around 10 feet way it stopped and looked up. It stared at me for the better part of 1 minute and then it darted off down the hill. I was very impressed with the speed of which it went down the mountain side. Know this - you will never out run a bear in any condition. I was excited and a bit startled but glad I had the encounter.
From the summit I started down the mountain, which turned out to be just as arduous as going up. When walking down hill constantly, the knee started to get weak. I took a break in a saddle and drank the last of my water. There has been plenty of water flowing around me all day, I'm headed down hill, so I'm not overly worried about the water situation at this point. Headed down the mountain, you can hear the sounds coming up out of the valley below. I heard a waterfall off in the distance and I though I would take a break once I got to that location. I walked over several streams crossing the trail and then eventually went past the waterfall. I was making great time on the trail and wasn't excited about stopping for a break at this point.  I figured the trail would continue to cross the water as I went down the mountain, but that figuring was completely wrong. The trail kept going and the water never showed up. I made it to my stopping point for the night, but couldn't stop because there was not a water source. I thought I could make it to Gerenflo Gap and there would be a water source there. I finally walked into Gerenflo Gap to find a lady sitting in a very comfortable looking chair (not sure how people hike with some of the gear they have) and my first question to her was for directions to the water source. It has been 4 hours at this point since I had water and I was starting to feel it.  She said there is not water at this location and kept reading.  Wonderful! I took off my pack and proceeded to sit down on a log. I asked her if she was hiking north or south and she stated that she came from Hot Springs (North - South). I asked her about water on the way from Hot Springs and she stated that there is a shallow stream about a mile north of our position. The giggled to myself underneath my breath because any direction on the trail includes the words ""about a mile - mile and a half"". She asked me about the trail headed south and I told her about the waterfall. I'm not sure of her destination for the evening, but it includes a long walk up hill.  I headed north on the trail, looking for the stream she talked about. About one and a half miles up the trail I came across a little stream that was good enough to drawl from, so I filled everything up. At this point I was looking for a place to sleep for the night. Back at the Gap, there was a sign that said Deer Mt. Shelter was 3 miles away. I figured that I had already walked 1.5 miles of it, so I stepped off to the shelter to spend the night.
Arriving at the shelter late, I found two young people were already there and they had set up for the night. They were travelling artists from Chicago and Michigan. Isabelle Wilson paints whatever and she had just finished painting the fence near the parking lot in Hot Springs. She sells her work and I encourage you to check out her paintings: www.isabellehwilson.com and @isabelle_wilson_art .  I set up the trail camera again and actually captured an ""Orb"" of light that went around my head, down my tent, around the tree, and can be seen on the left side of me in the photo. At 10:15 I was out for the night.","Roaring Creek Shelter

Ahab,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641323,"I think everything caught up with me last night because I don't remember much after zipping my tent and pulling the sleeping bag over my shoulder. I do remember the rain that came through in the middle of the night, which was very nice as it provided that white noise that I sleep with at home, which may be why I do not recall anything after that started.  Anyhow, as usual, I was the first person up and out in the camp which is nice because I actually like the morning time to myself and not talking. What was not great was that the young couple set up camp very, very close to the bear cables, so getting my bag down without waking them up was a challenge, but I think I succeeded because they were still asleep when I stepped off. I was up by 6:15 and out the door by 0800 for a very short walk into Hot Springs. Yesterday was a monster day (19.5 miles) which left nothing for the 10 mile day that I had planned today (left 3.2 miles).  The trail and morning were typical for this area, but I did climb slightly out of Deer Park Mt. Shelter to a summit (.2) and then 3 miles downhill into Hot Springs.  I paused at the summit of the Mountain to take a few photos of me sitting on the rocks enjoying the view before the 3 mile sprint downhill.  The descent was pretty steep as I lost 1,004 feet over three miles. Pretty interesting to walk into town after being out in the back country for several days. I rounded the last switchback and the noise of the mountain gave way to the hum of the city. It is very interesting how you do not hear the city when living in it and you cannot hear it until it is taken completely away for a period of time. Once you are immersed within the concrete jungle the noise becomes distant and things go back to usual. I immerged from the trail by way of some very, I mean very, steep steps. The trail lets out right into a parking lot where people have staged their vehicles for future operations and it was then that I was able to see the fence that @isabelle_wilson_art painted for the hostel.  Very nicely done and fitting for the location. The trail heads out of the hostel parking lot and across the road and at that point I was lost. Literally!  I did not know if I should turn right or left on the sidewalk, so I turned right. I walked about a quarter of a mile and realized that I should have seen signs for the trail (or something) so I turned around and headed back the other way. Not long (several feet) after crossing the point where I came out of the woods I saw the the gigantic AT signs embedded in the sidewalk.  Every few sidewalk slabs are engraved with these signs. This direction took me into town and I stopped at the first restaurant that looked full, which is my sign that the food is good because the locals fill up the diner.  I called for my wife to meet me for breakfast and that officially marked the end of my 2021 hike.","Deer Park Mt Shelter

Ahab,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641324,"Back home and it is all over for another season, so I guess. I have a feeling that I want to drive back down in the fall and hike from Hot Springs over the I-26. That distance would be a game changer in the world of driving to the trail head. Crossing 26 would be the equivalent of crossing I-40 and not having to deal with those mountain roads anymore. As I move north every year from this point, the drive will become easier and the hike will become less strenuous (to a degree). 
It is great to be home but there is a part of me that misses the trail. The mountains truly do call and if you enjoy your sanity, you must go. The jury is still out on the fall trip. 
Until next time.",,View Entry,"Jun 04, Fri",0
