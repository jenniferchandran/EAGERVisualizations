Aengus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632780,"Zach Davis' book, Appalachian Trials, recommends that potential thru-hikers examine their reasons for hiking the Appalachian Trail (AT).  This sounds reasonable to me!  I have multiple reasons for thru-hiking.  First, I want to see all the beauty that the trail has to offer.  I have spent time on the trail and have watched many videos of thru-hikes and know without doubt just how beautiful the trail is.  I want to wake up every morning in this beauty.  Second, I want the physical challenge of a thru-hike.  I am a firm believer that the body is capable of amazing things.  I have lived this motto while hiking long distances and running marathons and ultramarathons.  It is true that my body is not as strong as it once was but there's still plenty of strength and energy left in me.  Third, I see this as a spiritual journey.  I want to spend time thinking about God and what His plans are for me.  I also want to spend time drawing other hikers closer to God.  Finally, I am hiking in order to fulfill the dream of a lifetime.  I have wanted to thru-hike the AT for at least 40 years.  This is my opportunity to fulfill that dream.  
I start this journey on April 18, 2021, just 53 days from now.  I am both excited and humbled by the opportunities ahead.",,View Entry,"Feb 24, Wed",0
Aengus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632935,I'm trying to learn to use Trail Journals on my phone.  My goal today is to upload photos.  I've selected a photo from my September 2020 trip on the Knobstone Trail in southern Indiana.Addendum--I was able to upload two photos to Trail Journals but could only get one at a time to display.  No problem!  I'm a work in progress when it comes to hiking and electronics.,,View Entry,"Mar 04, Thu",0
Aengus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633561,"I planned to start my AT hike on April 18 but have to abandon that date.  I will now start on May 19.  To explain, I volunteer as a Site Coordinator and Tax Preparer with the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program.  VITA prepares income tax returns free of charge for low and moderate income taxpayers.  This is a program designed to provide economic assistance to these taxpayers.  The tax season was scheduled to end on April 15 until...it was extended last week until May 17.  I am a volunteer and can walk away from the program anytime I want but I choose not to do so until the tax season is over.  I think I owe that to myself, my fellow VITA volunteers, and to the taxpayers who rely on us for assistance.  So, my new start date is May 19.  I will move my starting point north from Damascus, VA to Waynesboro, VA.  The latter city is at the southern end of Shenandoah National Park.  I am anxious to start and look forward to May 19.",,View Entry,"Mar 21, Sun",0
Aengus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633723,"Mount Katahdin is the highest mountain in Maine at 5,269 feet. Its name comes from the Penobscot Native Americans and it means ""The Greatest Mountain.""  It is the northern terminus of the Appalachian Trail.  From my starting point in Waynesboro, VA it is 1,328.8 miles to Mt. Katahdin.  I have looked at this photo nearly every day for the last year and dreamed of standing on the summit.  Dreams do become reality and I look forward to that day.",,View Entry,"Mar 24, Wed",0
Aengus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634440,"An Appalachian Trail tradition is the use of trail names.  I would be very happy if hikers called me by my real name--Dan--but that is not how things work on the trail.  I selected my trail name of Aengus.  It's pronounced Angus (Scottish spelling) but spelled Aengus (Irish spelling).  I chose the Irish spelling from a short story written by William Butler Yeats.  Yeats was one of the greatest storytellers from a country known for its storytelling.  The title of the story is Where There is Nothing, There is God.  It is the story of Aengus, ""who went into the forest that he might labour only with song to the Lord.""  He became prideful in his work and took to the woods as a wanderer that he may atone for his sins.  He eventually came to an Irish abbey where he found the ""nothing that is God.""  In the hope that you will read the story I won't describe the ""nothing"" that it refers to.  Suffice it to say that it is an inspiring story and a great example of God's omnipresence and love for the least of mankind.  A link to the story can be found here: http://www.online-literature.com/yeats/2861/#:~:text='There%20is%20nothing%20beyond%20that,there%20is%20God.&text='The%20ruby%20is%20a%20symbol,'  
As a side note, I first read the story in August 2020 while visiting my mother.  Her parents, who are now deceased, owned a book entitled 44 Irish Short Stories.  That book sat on my grandparents' coffee table for as far back as I can remember.  I didn't read it until my mother was decluttering her house and gave me the book.  I never hesitated to accept it.  Just seeing it brought back many good memories of my grandparents.  That night I read Where There is Nothing, There is God and I immediately fell in love with the story.  It was then that I became the hiker named Aengus.",,View Entry,"Apr 07, Wed",0
Aengus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634932,"I originally planned to start my AT thru-hike tomorrow but it is now delayed until next month.  To explain, I have volunteered for 13 years as a tax preparer and site coordinator with our local Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program.  This program prepares income tax returns free of charge for low and moderate income taxpayers.  VITA volunteers understand the powerful financial tool that an income tax return can be.  It provides financial stability and a means for financial independence to many disadvantaged people in our community.  When the tax filing season was recently extended from April to May I struggled with delaying my hike in order to remain with the program until the end.  As you can tell, I chose to stay local.I was influenced by the words of another Appalachian Trail thru-hiker, Burt ""Wildcat"" Emerson.  In reading his trail journal I saw words of truth.  He wrote, ""People are more important than miles.""  The trail will still be there in May, and so will I.  My volunteers have been so loyal to me as the site coordinator.  They are equally loyal to the community that we serve.  I could not leave them behind.  The new trail start date is Wednesday May 19, 2021.",,View Entry,"Apr 16, Fri",0
Aengus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635399,"I spent yesterday and today in Hoosier National Forest hiking the German Ridge Trail in southern Indiana.  I hiked 15 miles yesterday and 11 miles today.  It snowed yesterday and the weather was quite cold.  That was not a problem except for last night when I tried to sleep.  My sleeping bag was not up to the task and I shivered much of the night.  Discomfort is usually temporary and that was the case last night.  I survived and am thankful for the opportunity to spend time in the out-of-doors.  I saw no one on the trail on day one and two trail runners and two turkey hunters on day two.  The trail was beautiful with spring flowers, flowering trees, and plenty of soothing spring-fed streams.  My legs are tired this evening but that too shall pass.
I recently obtained a new cellphone and cannot post photos to this site because they are too large in memory size.  The Trail Journal limit is 6 meg and my camera's photos are 8 meg.  I can provide a link to some photos from this backpacking trip.  The dogwood trees were in full bloom this week.  I hope this works: https://www.amazon.com/photos/...",,View Entry,"Apr 22, Thu",0
