Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641862,"Preparing to finish up my AT hike is not without apprehension.  2020 was a bust with lockdowns and quarantines. 2019 was cut short with an illness. 2018 I suffered a foot injury coming down Mt. Madison.  2017 was supposed to be the year I went NJ to Maine, but came down with Giardia in NH.  All totaled it took me three years to get out of NH.  Not exactly a stunning way to complete the AT.
Seven years ago I retired from corporate life and set two major goals, to become a  Certified Flight Instructor and to hike the Appalachian Trail.  I’ve accomplished the first goal to become a CFI, and now trying to complete the second goal to complete my AT hike.  The analogousness between flying and long distance hiking is not lost on me, they both require a tremendous amount of dedication and perseverance.  You don’t accomplish either goal unless you work hard, are prepared to sacrifice along the way, and quite often are dependent on others for help.  And the rewards are also similar; you enjoy great views, a freedom you’ve never experienced before, a tremendous sense of accomplishment, and quite likely a new found inner peace.  You also come to realize that you are never truly done.  There is always another airplane to fly, another rating to achieve, a mountain to climb.  And that is the real beauty of flying and hiking.",,View Entry,"Aug 04, Wed",0
Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642137,"It was now time to go through the ritual of pulling together my pack and gear for the AT hike.  I had the sad realization that it had been two years since I had last opened the plastic tub that contained all my gear.  (On the positive side, I did not find a half eaten bag of Gorp in my tub!) I have not done a single backpacking trip since I got off the AT in August 2019.  No backpack trips to Colorado or New Mexico where my sons live, no hikes in the Missouri or Arkansas Ozarks, no New England hikes.   2020 was truly a disappointment.
My gear was substantially the same as it had been for the last few years.  I pulled my tent out and set it up to waterproof it.  I tested my stove, inflated my sleeping pad, and went through all my gear to make sure it was all there.   I essentially set up a mini-camp in my backyard to make sure I had everything.  I also treated my hiking clothes with Permethrin.  So far it has worked well and I haven’t had any tick problems.
Like all hikers I’m constantly looking for ways to lighten my load.   I am far from an ultralighter, however I am envious of those that find a way to get their base weight down to 12-14 pounds.  I’ve found that I still like to have hot food, so I carry a stove.  My tent is a fairly light 1 man tent, but there are lighter versions that don’t need separate tent poles.  I’ve been carrying two sets of clothes, one to wear and one to keep dry or change into.  Other hikers just go with one set.  I’ve switched over to an inflatable air mattress, some hikers use a lightweight foam pad.  I get great sleep on my air mattress though.   All in all I’m happy with my gear choices.   It’s been a good compromise of weight and comfort.One of my heaviest items is my food bag. Generally I carry about 5 days worth of food, plus snacks for munching along the trail.   This year my food bag was 8 pounds starting out.  It will go down fairly quickly, but then I’ll resupply and it will get too heavy again.  Never let a hungry hiker go grocery shopping.   We’ll come out with 4 grocery bags of food and only have room for half bag in our packs.
As I touched each piece of gear and pack it into my pack,  memories of the trail came flooding back.    It’s amazing how an inanimate object can stir up emotions and memories.  Memories of lighting a stove on a snowy morning in Georgia to make some hot chocolate, of trying to inflate an air mattress after an exhausting climb up a Virginia mountain, watching my clothes stuff sack go bounding down a Tennessee mountainside after it rolled out of my pack, and setting up my tent with a perfect sunset view in Vermont.  Memories both good and bad, but memories well earned of a life on the Appalachian Trail.",,View Entry,"Aug 07, Sat",0
Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642268,"Today is the day I’m moving on, ready to start the hike.  I spend my summers on Cape Cod so I start my journey with a bus trip to Boston’s South Station, and then another bus to Gorham, NH.  From Gorham I have a hiker shuttle arranged tomorrow to Grafton Notch, Maine, about 40 miles away.   In 2019 I had started hiking from Pinkham Notch, about 12 miles south of Gorham, and made it to Grafton Notch before coming off with an illness.  This year I’m starting at Grafton Notch and hoping to make it to Katahdin.I’m not sure of what kind of cell coverage I’ll have traversing through Maine so I don’t know how well I’ll be able to keep up this journal, but I start with good intentions.  Thank you for following my journey.",,View Entry,"Aug 11, Wed",0
Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642313,"I left the Gorham Motor Inn at 8 with my shuttle driver “Golden Waldo”.   Waldo completed the trail in 2000 as a section hiker at the age of 66.   He’s now giving inexpensive shuttle rides in the Gorham area as a way of staying in touch with the trail.  If anyone needs a shuttle, Waldo is your man!  (504-615-9497)


We arrived at Grafton Notch about 9:15 and found another Trail Angel.  Water Queen thru hiked the trail in 2020 and now her daughter is thru hiking and Water Queen is following along while doing trail magic! @water_queen_2020 to follow her journey.


We chatted a while and then I put on my pack, took a picture at the trail head and headed north.  Everything immediately felt familiar and good.  My pack felt exactly like it did two years ago, the trail felt familiar, my boots even felt the same.   I was back.  Another thing that hadn’t changed was the trail, 20 minutes later I was struggling up a mountain side full of rocks and roots and pouring sweat.  Yes, I was back.


In Maine the trail designers haven’t learned about switchbacks yet, and so I pounded straight up the mountain.  The day was already hot with scattered clouds and no breeze.  I knew I was not in trail condition and it showed.  I was huffing and puffing all the way up.  Usually it takes about three weeks to get your trail legs, and it’s going to be a painful three weeks.  Baldplate Mountain is about 2500 feet above Grafton Notch, and there are two mountains separated by a saddle.   This first days climb was about 3000 feet and descending almost 2000 feet to the shelter site I was planning to camp at.


As a bonus, there were wild blueberries all over the summit of West Baldplate .  The descent down East Baldplate was where my trouble began, there was about 700-800 feet of slick granite for a trail.  To avoid slipping on the slick granite, I had to inch down, using whatever handholds I could.   It was a sketchy descent.  On the way down, I met up with Denise again.  Denise was an ultra fit trail runner I had passed on my way up West Baldplate and she was doing a 20 mile circuit today over the Baldplates and back.   She runs these trails often and gave me some good advice on the various sections and water sources.


Arriving at the shelter I found Fun Facts cooking her dinner.  We had leapfrogged each other several times during the day and she ended up at the Frye Notch shelter as well.   I had only seen 4 thru hikers and 5 day hikers all day so the trail had been quiet.  There was however, a large group of Explorer scouts at a nearby campsite.  They were very loud and one of the leaders came by and apologized.  There were 12 teenagers in their group, and we were just glad that they could get young folks interested into hiking.


I found a tent site and set up my tent.  There was no one in the shelter but I generally prefer my tent for bug protection and privacy.  After I had my camp set up I looked around for a tree branch to hang my food bag.  Fun Facts had identified one about 30 feet high and so we took turns trying to fling our lines over the branch.  It took about 3 tries to get it over the branch but we finally got it done.


With that done I set about cooking my dinner.   Fun Facts tried to get a fire going in the fire pit but wasn’t having any luck.  After dinner I cleaned up, hung my food bag and got some more water.   Fun Facts crawled into her hammock and said she was a late sleeper so be quiet bin the morning.


It was dark now and I was using my headlamp to do my final camp chores before going to bed.  I was hot, exhausted and ready to lie down.   Once in my tent bit was too hot to crawl in my sleeping bag, so I just laid on top of it.  It had been a good day, a good reintroduction to the trail.  I didn’t get many miles in but with a late start and considering the climbs and descents, I was pleased.","Grafton Notch

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642376,"I woke up several times through the night alternating between too hot and barely cool enough for my sleeping bag.  I woke up again as it was barely getting light but decided I was still tired and stayed in my sleeping bag a little bit longer.  I managed to fall asleep again and when I woke up the sun was just poking above the trees.   The Explorer scouts were up as well, and noisy as ever.


I gathered my food bag and had a quick cold breakfast.   I packed up my gear and was back on the trail.  Fun Facts had not stirred at all.The morning was hot and humid and I was dripping sweat.  I kept stopping for a drink of water and to catch my breath.  At the top of the climb I took a break and took my pack off.  The morning was beautiful with blue sky and bight sun. It was going to be a hot one once again.  Fun Facts came down the trail and surprised me.  She said the noise from the Explorer group was too much and destroyed her morning revery. Fun Facts was planning on going into town for real food, I thought I would just keep on going.  We kept leapfrogging each other once again throughout the morning until we came to the Dunn Cascades.  This was a delightful stream with waterfalls and pools to soak our feet in.  It felt good to cool off in the pools with the warm sun.  The trail had been quiet once again passing only one SOBO so far.


It was only 0.8 miles to the road and I wished Fun Facts good luck getting a hitch into town.   After a quick climb out of the Cascades the trail wound it’s way around a hillside and past a few more creeks.  When I got to the road, Fun Facts was still there.  No cars had passed by yet.   The lure of town and real food was too much and I decided to go in too if we could get a ride.  


A few minutes later an aging van pulled up and Fun Facts starting working on a ride for us.  Mullethead had been thru hiking until he got off for personal reasons.  Now he was driving the trail in his van with his dog Gouda and just doing day hikes and trail magic where possible.  He decided he could give us a ride into town and so we hopped in.


Andover is a small town and when we got there Mullethead’s van was overheating.  Fortunately we were right by a market that also served food so we went to get lunch while he and Gouda worked on his van.


While eating lunch, Fun Facts made a call home and the best I could gather arranged to meet her parents in Maine after summiting Katahdin.  I finished my hamburger and took the last bite out to Gouda.  I repacked my pack and was getting ready to go when Fun Facts came out and announced she was going to get a shuttle to a hostel to rehab her knee.  She would jump ahead somewhere I guess, to make her final push to Katahdin.


Mullethead was ready to go in his van and took me back to the trail.  It had been a nice diversion on a hot day to get some real food and down some cold drinks.  Unfortunately the market didn’t have any fresh fruit that I was craving, but it was a good break.  


Once back on the trail it made a steady climb up to Surplus Pond and then up Wyman Mountain.  The climb wasn’t too bad, other than the heat and persistent gnats.  It was over 90 degrees and very humid still.  I only met one NOBO that afternoon, Bags, and he was headed for Hall Mountain Lean to.  I thought I’d just go for Surplus Pond tonight.


Reaching Surplus Pond about 5 pm, it looked beautiful from afar.  As I walked closer it appeared to be marshy around the edges and I didn’t see a good place to go wading or swimming.  This was a beaver pond and so the trail guide cautioned to filter the water.  I found a good campsite and located a small spring that was barely running, but hoped to coax enough out of it.  


I was still full from lunch so just had some snacks for dinner.  I buttoned everything up and prepared for the rain that had been promised for overnight.  Hiker midnight came early and by 8 pm I was in my tent and falling asleep.","Frye Notch Lean to
",Surplus Pond,"Aug 13, Fri",6.40
Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642380,"I slept on and off but was still quite warm, half in and half out of my sleeping bag.  It started to get light and I wondered what happened to the forecasted rain.  About 6:30 am all of a sudden I heard it as a blast of wind came across the Pond.  My tent shook and I knew the rain was about to start.    Not knowing how long it would last I gathered my water bottles and made for the spring to make sure I had some water.  I also grabbed my food bag from its branch and tossed it into the tent vestibule in case it would be raining a long time.  The rain hit with a fury just as I crawled back into my tent.  


It rained hard for two solid hours.  My tent mostly stayed dry but I had a few drips.  When I crawled out there was no sign of the other campers at the tentsite, they must have packed up in the rain.  The campsite was a muddy mess and as I packed up I did my best to try to keep my gear from getting too muddy, but it wasn’t easy.   I let things dry out the best I could, but things weren’t going to dry out for a while.  The skies had gone overcast again and it was still very warm and humid.


I started my first climb of the day up Wyman Mountain.  After about a half a mile, another gust front came through and the rain came once again.  I donned my rain jacket and pack cover but it was a hard rain and I got soaked.I tried to sidestep the deeper places but in many places there was no choice but to walk through ankle deep water.  The storm continued for about 2 hours again, and when it finally let up I was getting near the top of Wyman Mountain.  I had thought I would just try to get to Hall Mountain shelter to dry out, but I passed a happy SOBO hiker, Sojourner, who said she was staying at a hostel.  That sounded like a great idea so I started calling around to find one with space.  Pine Ellis hostel in Andover had space and so I made a reservation.   This would give me a chance to dry out, do laundry, take a shower, snd get some real food.  I arranged a shuttle pick up at South Arm road and then I had a deadline.  As it turned out the descent down Hall Mountain and the ascent up Moody Mountain were very tough.  The wet slippery rocks were treacherous.  I face planted and back planted several times as my feet went out from under me.  It was slow going, steep, and nerve racking.  By the time I made it up Moody Mountain the skies had cleared and it was a beautiful day.  I didn’t have time to enjoy the views but it was nice to have the sun out and a nice cool breeze.


The rain had swollen the rivers and the steppingstones that normally were used were all under water.  This made for more fun, but I hear it’s common in Maine.


Pine Ellis hostel is run by several elderly women, and it’s like staying at your grandmother’s house.  With random decor and a lot of clutter, it is just like your grandmother’s house.  Super nice people and very accommodating to hikers.  It’s affordable and a chance to do laundry, get a shower, and a dry bed.   Two other hikers were staying in my room, Chewy and Dilly Dally, both NOBO thru hikers.


 The weather is looking great for tomorrow, cooler and drier and I’m looking forward to it!","Surplus Pond
",South Arm Rd - Andover,"Aug 14, Sat",8.20
Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642668,"I decided on a late shuttle from Pine Ellis hostel so that I could enjoy some town time and everything dried out, repacked, and charged up without having to rush.  I had a leisurely breakfast at Miller’s Mart in Andover, bought some replacement food, and caught up on my trail journal.  Dilly Dally was taking a zero that day and Chewy would be moving up the trail.  After Chewy left, another hiker, Bags, showed up to take his bed.   I had met Bags on the climb Wyman Mountain the other day.  He was going to zero as well.


I got my shuttle out to South Arm Road trailhead at 11 and started the ascent up Old Blue Mountain by 11:30.   The topo map showed this ascent to be steep and tough, but it actually wasn’t so bad.  It helped that I was fresh and rested.  Getting to the top of Old Blue was about a 2200 foot ascent, but a lot of it was just hiking and not too many rock climbs.  On top of Old Blue I took my pack off and just laid down on a large rock and relaxed for a while enjoying the warm sun and cool breeze.
 The descent down was fairly moderate as well and it was just great hiking in cool, dry air with a nice breeze for a change.  As I approached the campsite, I met up with Blizzard, Remy, and Wild Man.  Their little trail family, tramily we call it, had been hiking together since Vermont.   We set up camp near each other and enjoyed telling stories while we ate.  I was inspecting their tents looking for recommendations on a replacement for mine since it was leaking.  Blizzard’s comment on his was “ it doesn’t so much stop the rain as filter it”.  He needed to replace his as well.


I learned that Blizzard was from Texas, Remy was from Virginia, and Wild Man said in his words, “I have  post office box in Massachusetts”.  It is always interesting how the trail brings together people from disparate parts of the country.


Tonight would be great sleeping weather!  We all agreed this was a perfect stealth site, utterly peaceful and calm.","South Arm Rd - Andover
",Bemis Stream Trail,"Aug 15, Sun",6.10
Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642711,"After an early Hiker midnight (8:30 pm), I woke up about 2:30 am for a nature call.  Crawling out of my tent I was amazed at how dark it was, dark and quiet.  From where I was camped, I couldn’t see a light anywhere, nor the glow from lights beyond the horizon.  Few places in America are afforded that beauty of a truly dark sky.   From a different place on that mountain there may have been some visible lights, but from my campsite it was totally dark.  To add to the richness, there was no sound to be heard.  No insects, no road noise, not even a breath of wind.  It was totally quiet.


One on my biggest disappointments on the AT has been the lack of sky, there have been few opportunities for sunsets , sunrises, and stargazing.  I am from the wide open spaces of Kansas where the sky is ever present.


Having breakfast and packing up I was able to chat more with Blizzard, Remy, and Wild Man.  One of the great things about the AT is getting to know the hikers that are so driven to come out here and walk 2200 miles.  Leaving jobs and families for 6+ months and enduring heat and cold, rain and mud, bugs and bad food, all so that we can experience the Trail.  It’s a compulsion for those of us that are drawn to it and we talk about it with each other all the time; “Why are you here?”


Todays hike was planned to continue up Mt. Bemis, and then a long descent of about 2500 feet down to the Bemis River and then another ascent to Long Pond.  The morning started out cool and sunny but we had lost the wonderful breeze overnight.  The grade today was not too steep but the rocks and roots, mud and short little descents down a pile of rocks were tough on the knees.   I met up with Yeti at the Bemis Mountain Lean - to and he was commenting on the same thing.   “These 15-20 foot rocky descents don’t show up on the topo map, but they’re tough on your knees”.


I was really slow today and toward the final descent was passed by a woman hiker named Hip Hiker.  She had two hip replacements before attempting the trail and she said “those are the only parts not hurting after today.”


As I neared the bottom I could see a road with a truck with several people standing by it and Hip Hiker called out, “Hey Ranger, trail magic!”  Down by the truck, Hip Hiker and Bags were with Greg and Geri, a couple of local residents had set up a bench and a cooler with cold sodas and snacks.  I was in desperate need of a cold drink and the Mountain Dew they had really hit the spot!   Greg and Geri said they do this nearly every day knowing that the descent down Bemis Mountain was a tough one.  Greg was a retired real estate broker and also served as the local school board superintendent.


Dilly Dally and Argentina showed up a few minutes later and it was like a little homecoming of hikers that had seen each other on the trail but never really had a chance to get to know each other.  Greg and Geri were interested in each of our stories and our experiences.   They were wonderful hosts!


Greg told us about a few stealth spots  right across the Bemis River and instead of a late afternoon climb up the next mountain, Bags, Argentina, and I opted to stealth at the River.  Hip Hiker and Dilly Dally went up the mountain to get in a few more miles.


Bags and I set up our tents near each other and made our dinners.  A little bit later, Mountain Goat and Explosion showed up and decided to pitch their tent by us.  Bags knew them from a few hundred miles back and so they caught up.  Mountain Goat’s sister had summited Katahdin a few days before and she had the interesting comment.  She had talked to her brother and he said “he could listen to their sister for hours, but never really comprehend or understand what she had experienced out here.   If you haven’t lived it yourself, you just couldn’t.”


It reminded me of the quote from the great Stephen Ambrose book, “Band of Brothers”.  


“From this day to the ending of the world,But we in it shall be remembered—We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;…”


Shared experiences like the Trail bring us this connection.","Bemis Stream Trail

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642712,"After a great night at Bemis Stream I woke up to the gentle sounds of the stream.  Eating breakfast and packing up, Bags got me talking about aviation and unfortunately for him once I get going it’s hard to stop.  I took off up the mountainside toward Maine 17 highway.  It’s a steep climb to the road but once up there, there is a bench with a beautiful view and a Scenic Overlook parking area.   I was sitting on the bench when a SOBO hiker, Guttah Trash, yelled out, “Trail Magic at the Overlook!”  I couldn’t see any cars in the parking area from the bench so started walking that way.  Once up there I met AT Gracie and she offered me an ice cold drink!  Another vehicle with Lanky and Batgirl were setting up to do trail magic as well.  AT Gracie has been doing trail magic for almost 30 years as well as section hiking when she can.  Lanky was a 2019 thru hiker and was doing some hiking as well as leaving trail magic.   As I was sitting there one hiker after another showed up and received a drink and a snack as well as signing Gracie’s logbook and got their picture taken.   It was a hiker convention with a dozen or so NOBOs and SOBOs swapping stories.   Gracie was glowing with being able to make so many hikers happy on their journey.


I continued up the mountainside fueled with a cold Mountain Dew and was pleasantly surprised that the terrain had leveled out and was an undulating path through the forest.  My main objective for this day was Long Pond, a spring fed pond with a sand beach where I could go for a swim.   I got to the pond about 12:30 and the weather was perfect for a swim.   The water was crystal clear as I glided through the water.  The water was cool and occasionally I could feel currents of cooler spring water as I swam around.  When I stopped to float in the pond, the silence was profound.  There  was a total sense of quiet and serenity.  


After my swim, I continued on past Sabbath Day Pond Lean-to and met up with Send It and Alaska.  I had met them at the trail magic convention and it was fun chatting with Alaska and getting some tales from Alaska.  I continued on to Little Swift River Pond campsite through relatively easy terrain.  Arriving at the pond I was disappointed that the water source was just a small dribble out a plastic tube.  Party Dave was already camped there and he said he used one of the canoes that MATC left for hikers to use to go get some water from the center of the pond to get some water.   (Thank you MATC!). While he was out in the canoe a cow and calf Moose entered the pond and began feeding.  When I took the canoe out I didn’t get to see any Moose, but I did have a pleasant moment of serenity floating on the pond and enjoying the sounds of silence.


After my canoe excursion I was talking with another hiker that had come to the campsite and as we talked it turned out he was a pilot and CFI as well, except that he was an ATP Corporate pilot.   As we talked some more it finally came out that he was also a rather famous musician.   He was doing the trail with his wife and they had spent their anniversary on the Trail.   They went by the trail name of The Praise Team and were the nicest couple.   Congratulations to them!


I left my tent fly open to let some air in as it had gotten warm again.  Later that night as the sound of rain started splattering on my tent, I closed the fly and drifted off to sleep.","Bemis Stream Stealth Site

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642713,"A light rain lasted until early morning, nothing like the blast associated with the cold front a couple of days ago.   The air was warm and humid, and a low overcast blanketed the sky.    The Praise Team was up early and on the trail in order to meet their planned shuttle pickup to go into Rangely.   I made Hot Chocolate for breakfast and decided to take the canoe out on the pond one last time and eat my breakfast on the pond. Again, the pond was silent as my oars slipped in the water.  No moose, no birds, no wind as I slowly paddled out into the pond.   I ate my breakfast in silence and then slowly made my way back to shore.   Eric and Timber were waiting and they were going to take the canoe out to get some water from the middle of the pond.


I finished packing and then went to chat with Eric and Timber before heading out.  They were SOBOs so I would never see them again.  They had life circumstances happen that made for an opportunity to do the trail so they decided to go for it.   They were taking it slow, and didn’t intend to finish it, just to go as far as seemed fun.  They were another nice couple and I wished them safe journeys.


Water was the biggest issue, most of the sources were rough looking swampy pools.  I was able to find enough clean water to fill a bottle,  but keeping hydrated was difficult on such a humid morning.


I arrived at the parking area and who did I find but AT Gracie!   She was there dropping off Superwoman and Supergirl (a mother and 7 year old daughter thru hiking the trail).   She remembered me from yesterday and said, “Ranger, could I offer you a cold drink!”  I gratefully accepted and she asked if I needed a ride to Rangely which I did.  A few minutes later, other NOBOs showed up, Si, and then another, Kiddo.    Each grateful for a cold drink.   Si was going on but Kiddo needed a ride into town as well so Gracie loaded us up and shuttled us into town.   She dropped me at my hotel, and then took Kiddo down to the laundry.   The thing about Gracie is that she doesn’t just drop you off, but takes care of you.   She took Kiddo to the laundry and had loaner clothes, laundry detergent, quarters all available for her.   A real trail Angel!


After I checked into my hotel I went down the street to do my laundry as well.  As I was waiting for my clothes to dry, Kiddo and Gracie came back from lunch and Gracie offered us a ride to the supermarket for resupply.  A trip to the grocery store before eating lunch is a dangerous thing, but getting a ride was too good to pass up.


We both did our resupply and then Gracie dropped me off at my hotel and took Kiddo to her hostel.  Gracie had to head home after this, but I have a feeling I’ll be seeing her up the trail again.


At the hotel I ran into Yeti and he mentioned that weather was coming in and he was going to Zero the next day.  I decided that would be a good idea as well, I didn’t want to be up on Saddleback Mountain in a thunderstorm.  I was able to extend my reservation and then walked down into town for a late lunch.


Rangeley is a beautiful town and has lots of tourists, sportsmen, vacationers, and well… hikers.  It’s a great place to spend a Zero day.   I found a popular pub, Sarge’s, and had a terrific Lobster Roll lunch.   Rangeley is no where near the sea, but this is Maine and you’ve got to have your lobster!","Little Swift River Pond

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642718,"Zero Days are a blessing and a curse.  It’s fantastic to have a day to let your body and feet recuperate and to get some nutrition in your body for the next push, but it can also make you revert to your normal unhealthy habits.   I started my morning going out and looking for breakfast and exploring Rangely.   I thought there would be lots of breakfast dining options but apparently not.  I ended up walking the length of town until I got to the bowling alley which had a cafe/pub inside it.   It turned out to be outstanding and my blueberry pancakes were excellent.


As I explored the town I found that they had a seaplane operation on Rangely Lake.  I would have loved to get a seaplane ride in a Super Cub, but this morning the ceilings were too low to go flying.  I also visited a couple of outfitters looking for some seam sealant for my leaky tent.  The Sport Shop was a nice little outfitter primarily for fishing but had a few other camping items, but the best place was Ecopelagicon, which looked like a gift shop from the outside but turned out to have a great selection of gear snd supplies.  (The owner and I had a great discussion on the name which I still can’t pronounce)


After exploring the town I went back to my hotel and got lazy.  I had the whole day to sort through and clean up gear, seal the seams on my tent, and catch up on trail journals.   Mid- afternoon I met up with good friends from Texas who we’re staying about an hour away and we went to lunch at the Parkside restaurant.  Nice place!


I finished my day by returning back to town and getting some ice cream at the Pine Tree Frosty and sitting on the bank of Haley Pond behind the Frosty.   Evening was falling and kids were feeding the ducks on the pond.  The night was quiet once again, looking out over the pond things were very peaceful.  I’ll look forward to returning to Rangely in the future, and get that seaplane ride.","Maine Route 4 - Rangely

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642913,"I got a late start from the hotel after my shuttle driver didn’t show up, however another shuttle driver (Kim) was available and she was able get me back to the trail by 11.  The trail up the Saddlebacks started very easily all the way to Eddy Pond.  At the pond I and a bunch of other hikers took advantage of the large rocks along the shoreline to lay in the sun and enjoy a breeze.  


After Eddy Pond however, the trail went straight up the mountain including a fair amount of rock climbing.  Saddleback has a broad summit with 3 peaks that are all above treeline.  It was a hazy day so the views were diminished while still impressive.   After another 500 foot descent the trail climbed back over 4000 feet to The Horn (The Saddle Horn I’m guessing) which offered even more impressive views to the mountains to the north.  The descent down The Horn was very steep and rocky, and exhausting.   


I arrived at Redington Steam campsite just before sunset and made camp.   It turned out I was the only one camped here tonight, a first for this trip.  Redington had a good water source however the tent pads were austere to say the least.   Most of them were very small with a lot of roots and blown down trees around them.   Night fell as I was making my dinner and I quickly fell asleep once on my tent.","Maine Route 4 - Rangeley

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642914,"Waking up to clear skies at Redington Stream, I made breakfast and broke camp as quick as I could.  I expected it to be a hot day once again.   The climb and descent of Saddleback Junior was very steep and it made for slow going for me.  On the way down I ran into Denise again, the ultra fit marathon runner, who had been out for an overnight to Spaulding Mountain.   We talked for a bit and she had all kinds of good information on water sources and difficulty of various mountains.  


I continued my descent to Poplar Ridge Lean-to where I had lunch, before continuing the long descent to Orbeton Stream.   The day was incredibly hot and humid, and many  southbound hikers I passed where saying they just weren’t feeling it today.   By the time I reached Orbeton Stream, I was roasted and the water looked so inviting.   I found a deeper pool in the stream and went for a swim.  It felt so refreshing!


Drying off, I met up with One Peice and her father, Lost and Found.  They were section hiking and debating whether to find a stealth site or make the 3 mile climb up to Poplar Ridge shelter.  I advised what I knew of potential stealth sites snd then I headed for my stealth site at Perham Stream.  The climb up to the stream was fairly enjoyable as it followed a stream most of the way snd had few rock climbs.  Arriving at the stream site there was one other hiker, Huck Finn, set up already.   I found a spot for my tent and quickly made dinner.  Rain was forecast, and just as I finished dinner it started raining.  I wasn’t quite cleaned up so I was stashing gear and covering my pack as best I could before diving into my tent.  It rained fairly hard but my tent seams that I resealed in Rangeley remained dry.  The rain continued into the night and I hoped that all the southbound hikers I had met had made it to the shelter or found a stealth site.","Redington Stream Campsite

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642915,"I woke up to the continued wet drips on my tent.  Usually I’m pretty anxious to get out of my tent and start packing  up but this morning I just wanted to stay cocooned in my sleeping bag.   I really wasn’t anxious to face all the wet that awaited me outside and the mountains that needed to be climbed.    This was another day of mountains, and looking ahead I had about 3 more days of big mountains before I got into the flatter parts of central Maine.


I did as much packing as I could inside my tiny one man tent and crawled out into the drips.  It was like being in a cloud, with just a fine mist falling.  I fired up my stove to make hot chocolate and began eating my last honey bun.  I’ve found that Honey buns make a pretty darn good breakfast.


I had hoped to do about 10 miles a day and be in Stratton tonight, but I’m only averaging about 7 miles a day so I won’t get to Stratton until tomorrow night.  My goal today was Crocker Cirque Campsite, 9.5 miles away.  That would put me part way up the Crockers and only 7 miles from Maine 27 and Stratton.


I was passed by a few young NOBOs on the climb and met a delightful older SOBO couple dressed out in matching blaze orange.  View Finder and See Bear were flip floppers on their way back to Harper’s Ferry.  After topping Lone Mountain I continued on to Spaulding Mountain Lean-to to dry out a bit and have an early lunch.  When I arrived, the 3 NOBOs that passed me earlier were chowing down.  Shawty, Show Pony and another hiker we’re planning on 13 more miles to get into town.  They had all started around the end of March and were about 2 weeks away from finishing.   They were going for the big milestone today of crossing the 200 and 2000 mile mark.  200 miles to Katahdin and 2000 miles from Springer!  I wouldn’t be able to do those kind of miles but would be passing the 200 mile mark!


As I was about to leave the shelter, Topo, Gruncle, and another hiker showed up.   Chatting a bit I learned Topo was recently retired and doing a LASH from NJ to Katahdin.  He was also a glider pilot and so we got to talk aviation. 


I started the climb up Spaulding Mountain and Topo caught up with me.  We started walking together and he had a million questions about getting his Private Pilot Certificate.  Once I get started talking about Aviation it’s hard to stop me, and we soon came upon the plaque dedicated to the completion of the AT by the CCC at the 200 mile mark.  200 miles to Katahdin!


We continued walking and talking aviation and the miles went much faster than usual.  Topo was exactly the kind of convert we in GA need to capture!  


I did my best to keep everything dry while setting up my tent.   A quick dinner and I dove into my tent.   The rain continued throughout the night.  Sometime during the night another camper came in late and set their tent up next to mine.   That must have been miserable walking in the dark and rain up and down these mountains only to have to set up camp in the dark and wet.  I was glad I was snug and dry in my little cocoon.","Perham Stream

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642920,"2000 is just a number, not significantly different from 1999, or 2001, or 2004 for that matter.  But 2000 holds a special place in AT hikers hearts.  It’s a big milestone, and also signifies that over 90% of the journey has been completed.  The length of the trail varies every year with reroutes, this year it’s 2193.1.  The ATC conservancy issued certificates to those that have completed the entire trail; the certificates are called “2000 miler certificates”.   But of course you need to go more than 2000 miles for one.  It’s a lot of work for a piece of paper.


Today I would go over 2000 miles.   Unlike many that I’m hiking around, it’s taken me 7 years to go that far, well 6 hiking years with 2020 being a bust.  But I have walked 2000 miles from Georgia, and that’s been the experience of my life.  It’s been more of an experience than I could have imagined.   I’m not done yet, and painfully aware that one slip or fall could doom my completing it this year.  However I’ll keep putting one step in front of the next until I do, for as my favorite Jerry Jeff Walker song goes - 


“But every mile and footstep goin' downAin't no way a man keeps a count,you just never forget that lonely stretch where you keep on for keepin on”.


It wasn’t raining anymore so much as misting.  I was dry inside my tent thankfully, but everything around me was dripping wet.  I made my hot chocolate breakfast and packed everything up.   The hiker who had come in late turned out to be a young woman from Israel who was SOBO for two months.   She was late getting in because she had gone into town to resupply.   I can’t imagine her climbing down the rocky descent of Crocker Mountain in the dark and in the rain.  I just told her good luck on her journey as she worked to pack her wet gear up.  Topo was still in his tent as I left, I had hoped to walk with him again and hopefully will see him down the trail.


I was going to be spending the night at the Roadhouse of Maine hostel tonight.  I only had 7.3 miles to the road where I would get picked up, so a relatively short day.  The climb up the Crockers was a tough one again with numerous steep rock climbs, followed by a long descent down to the road.   On that descent I hit the 2000 mile mark.  Someone had arranged small pebbles to mark the spot, another person had arranged sticks to spell out 2000.  The weather was cloudy and misty, so there wasn’t much of a view to commemorate the milestone, but I could imagine.  


Truth be told mile 2000 was like many of the 2000 before it, lots of rocks and roots and mud.  Oh but the experiences of those 2000 miles; the people of those 2000 miles, the towns and the hostels of those 2000 miles, the views and the wilderness of those 2000 miles, that’s what we all hold dear.  And just 193.1 miles to go.","Crocker Cirque Campsite

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643066,"I was slow getting around to leave the Main Roadhouse.  All of my gear was scattered around to dry it out so I had to repack everything.  I also had to go through my food after resupply and decide how much to carry.  I’m only 3-4 days till my next resupply at Caratunk, but I wasn’t sure what would be available there.


The Main Roadhouse provides a breakfast and so I enjoyed a sit down breakfast of pancakes, bacon, and fresh fruit.  So good!!   When I was packed and ready to go I took my pack out to the front porch and found the owner Jenn to pay my bill.  After 2 days of rain, the skies had cleared and it was a beautiful Maine morning and so I found myself relaxing on the front porch enjoying the sunshine and talking to Jenn and the other hikers.


The Roadhouse was an interesting story.  It was a newly reopened hostel.  Jenn and her partner, Jenn, were a couple of suburban Atlanta moms who decided they wanted to do something.  Yes, there are two Jenns.  Jenn had a friend who had the property and had struggled with it.  The two Jenns purchased it and went in and totally redid it on their own.   New woodwork, new bunks, new flooring, new paint, everything.   It’s beautiful, and clean.  Jenn described how they had their first customer 7 weeks ago before they were even ready to open, a week later they had 21 hikers in one night.  They haven’t even advertised, it’s just word of mouth on the trail right now.  They’re learning a lot everyday and what is impressive is they are adapting to the needs of their hiker customers, instead of hikers adapting to the hostel.   The only rule- no boots in the house.  It was one of the best hostels on the trail.


When I was ready to go, Jenn gave me a ride out to the trail.  The Bigelows are the last big mountains for a while.   I was excited to go over them.  The first couple of miles were great, just walking through forest paths, and then the climbs started.   The trail took me up a mountain side strewn with huge boulders, some 30 feet in diameter.  I’m guessing they are glacial relics from when the glaciers retreated.  It was another tiring climb, but so interesting with the boulders.  I made my way up to the first viewpoint and had lunch.   The view was so impressive and to see what had been lost in the clouds for the last few days.  The trail continued on to The Horns Pond and campsite, and then continued up the mountain to the South Horn. Again there were beautiful views of the Sugarloaf Ski Area.  The trail then takes you along along a long ridge up to Mount Bigelow West Peak.   The final climb up to the summit was along a narrow exposed spine and the wind was blowing pretty good.  I had to be extra careful as it was a long way down off that spine.   Once on top, the views were magnificent!  Bigelow is known for having some of the best views in Maine.   The sun was getting low and so I decided I had better get going to my campsite.   I would have loved to stay on top of the mountain for sunset, but knowing how tough some of the descents are I didn’t want to be doing them in the dark.


I found Bigelow Col campsite after a short descent and hike.  It’s one of the few higher altitude campsites and so was cool and I had a wonderful breeze.  There was only one other hiker there, a SOBO flip flopper, John Wood.   The mountain had been quiet today, I had only seen 3 day hikers all day and no thru hikers.


Night came and I actually had a few stars and some moonlight through the trees.   Tomorrow would be a climb up Bigelow Avery peak and then down into lakes and ponds region.   The last of the big mountains was almost done for a while.","ME 27 Stratton
