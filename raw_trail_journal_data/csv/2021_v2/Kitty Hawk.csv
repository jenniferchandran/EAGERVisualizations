Kitty Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626614,"STONE COLD KILLER. What an awesome
trail name! Everybody will remember it. Kind of long though. I
could abbreviate it. SCK. No, doesn't have that ring to it. People
won't remember initials. It's Stone Cold Killer. People will
probably shorten it. Stone Cold, or just Stone.
Stone Cold Killer. “How did you get
your trail name?” Uh, sounded cool? Douche!
Ok. What describes me? Guitarman. I'm a pretty good guitar player. Like, plays in bands in bars good. Dropped out of college to travel around the country with a band. But
I'm not taking a guitar out on the trail. Four or five pounds and
bulky. So no to Guitarman.
After two years of ups and downs, the
band broke up, I went back to college and got a degree in
biochemistry. The Biochemist. No. I threw my diploma in the closet
and built a career in banking. The Banker. Hell to the no!  What do
I do now?  I'm a consultant. The Consultant. Nope. Isn't work what
I am getting away from on the trail? 
I considered calling myself Raindrop. They say we pack our fears. My fear is not bears, not snakes, not
Giardia...its rain. Specifically, setting up and tearing down in the
rain. It is just misery in my mind. I updated the BJ Thomas song –
Raindrops Keep Falling on my Head:
                                                                       ♪ Raindrops keep falling on my back

                                                              Just like the guy who's got too much in his pack

                                                                             My hips are killing me, but

                                                                 I'm never gonna get to Maine by complaining...
So I could be Raindrop. But I just
don't feel it.
On January 26th, my wife and
I were hiking the Approach Trail. Hikers asked the usual 'how far
you going?' My wife responded, “all the way!” Then she
would provide detail. Too much detail. “We live in Dahlonega, so
we are going to knock out Georgia on days when the weather is good,
and then we'll start on April 1st and keep going from
there, and...”
Afterward, I would say “Just tell
them we are thru-hiking. They don't need to know all the details. Keep it simple.”
And she responded “That's my husband
– a Simple Man.”  
EDIT - if you read my entry from March 3, 2021, you'll see what happened, and how I changed my trail name from Simple Man to Kitty Hawk.  It will probably change again when some hiker names me for some stupid thing I do on trail.  Bound to happen.",,View Entry,"Jan 26, Sun",0
Kitty Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626615,"Why am I hiking the Appalachian Trail? Adventure? Yes. Connect with nature? Yes. See America? Yes. Get
in better shape? Yes. Get away from work? Yes. A bad day of
hiking is better than a good day at work, right?
What it really comes down to, is
something a coworker and friend said on a consulting job last year. The team had various tasks to work on, and I asked my friend “What
are you going to do today?” 
In total seriousness, he replied “I
am going to sit in my chair, and watch my life slowly ebb away.”
LOL! I cracked up. I wrote it down,
along with other pearls of wisdom he has said. But the more I
thought about it, the more I realized I was doing the same. Aren't
most of us doing the same? 
I had recently been taking day hikes
and overnight hikes with some of my buddies at work, and really
enjoying it. It brought back memories from youth of how much I liked
camping and hiking while in the Boy Scouts. And I realized I need to
get back to that. I need to get back to the outdoors. I need to do
something epic. I need to hike the Appalachian Trail!",,View Entry,"Jan 26, Sun",0
Kitty Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626616,"I didn't think my wife would like me
going off for six months, but I thought she would support me. And I
would miss her. Nights alone. I would miss her every time I saw a
great view or experienced something unique, knowing my description or
even pictures would not do it justice. I would miss sharing those
things with her.
My wife is very close with her 2
brothers and 3 sisters. They talk every day. Every weekend there is
a family event – a birthday, anniversary, graduation, ballgame,
etc. During the week there is dinner here, trivia night there. My
wife cannot be apart from them for long. That is is why I was
stunned, and thrilled, when she told me she would like to hike the
Appalachian Trail with me. 
In her youth she enjoyed camping. It
was mostly car camping, but she enjoys the outdoors. Bizarrely, in
26 years of marriage, we had never gone camping together. 
My new hiking experiences were in
beautiful Idaho. My job was in Boise, and my buddies and I enjoyed
time in the Boise National Forest and in the Sawtooth Mountains. Yellowstone was a half day's drive east. I had to take advantage and
see it while I was out there. I took a week off, and my wife flew
out to visit. We spent the week camping in Yellowstone. It was
great. We decided we should do more camping. So maybe I shouldn't
have been surprised by her desire to join me on the Appalachian
Trail. I don't think she has the same burning desire to climb
Katahdin, and I don't know if she'll last six months on the trail
(will I?), but I am excited that we are going to try it together.",,View Entry,"Jan 27, Mon",0
Kitty Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626618,"My wife has a nickname for everybody in
her family. She comes up with nicknames for co-workers. She came up
with my trail name - Simple Man. And together, we have tried to find
a trail name for her. Every time she says or does something
memorable, or silly, or funny, it sparks a name, but nothing that
sticks, or that she likes.
For 60 years old, I am in pretty good
shape. My buddies in Idaho were calling me Mountain Goat. (Yes,
that was a contender, but I expect there will be several Mountain
Goats on the trail). My wife, at 57 is pretty healthy, but not in
the condition I am. I can hike faster. She prefers to
have me lead, and says she will just tag-a-long behind me. Tag-a-long. That is her trail name.",,View Entry,"Jan 28, Tue",0
Kitty Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626619,"I had no intention to journal. I
thought that I would have enough on my plate just getting in mileage,
setting up camp, cooking, resting, keeping my wife engaged. She
likes hiking, but camping is boring when we're alone and don't have
all the luxuries of car camping. Also, carrying a notebook is just
another unnecessary weight in my pack. Or pecking on my smartphone
keyboard would be/is aggravating. But many books and videos
recommend journaling to capture the memories. And so it came to be.",,View Entry,"Jan 30, Thu",0
Kitty Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626620,"As I mentioned previously, we live in
Dahlonega, and from my house to Gooch Gap is 5 miles. Springer Mtn
is a 40 minute drive. Neels Gap is about the same. I live right in
the middle. That is a blessing.
So here is the plan. When the weather
is not too cold, or too rainy, we are doing a small section – a day
hike or an overnighter. We plan to knock out Georgia before April. In the beginning of April, tentatively April 1st, we will
continue hiking from our last hike and keep going. 
We hope that puts us in or near
Damascus for Trail Days. After that, we hope to make good mileage,
but at the same time don't want to push ourselves so hard we miss the
sights, and the fun. 
Zeros and neros are expected. We like
to sightsee. And given our age, we will probably need rest. I said
I was in good shape, and that refers to muscle tone and cardio. My
weakness is my joints – ankles and hips. Tag-a-long has a bunion,
but an orthopedic surgeon gave her an orthotic, and her Altra Olympus
trail runners provide great cushion. She hasn't had any issues yet
on our shakedown hikes and the first 31 miles of the AT.
We have one side trip planned so far. Tag-a-long has always wanted to see Frank Lloyd Wright's home at
Falling Waters. This happens to be less than 3 hours from Harpers
Ferry. 
In the end, I hope we make Katahdin. If we are don't get far enough fast enough, we could flip flop, but I
hope it doesn't come to that.","

Kitty Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626621,"As consultants (Tag-a-long does the
same), we can choose to take some time off. My first hikes in Idaho were tough on my feet and my hips. I
used a bookbag for my gear, borrowed a hammock and trekking poles,
and my shoes were Wally World sneakers. My first couple of
overnighters I carried about 35 lbs, with little water and just a few
meals. Each time was great, but I hurt afterwards.
So began the gear hunt. Researching
every day. Darwin. Dixie. Bigfoot. And many more. Kindle
Unlimited. Buying gear. Shakedown hikes. Return gear, give away
gear, buy new gear. More shakedowns. Buy more gear. It's been fun,
but I have spent a LOT of money. And remember that I am buying for
2. 
One word, two syllables: Zpacks.After the trail edit:  I recently read a scathing online post about poor customer service from Zpacks, following by several replies from other hikers all railing against the company.  While not knowing both sides of the story, I can only sympathize with these hikers.  However, my own personal experiences with the company have been consistently phenomenal.  The first pack I bought for my wife was the Arc Scout.  It is a junior sized pack that did not work for her.  I told Zpacks I'd like to return it and buy their Arc Haul pack instead.  They had no problem with this.  Later on I bought their Altiplex one man tent, but found it too constricting to me, having gotten used to their 3 man Triplex tent.  They took back the Altiplex and refunded my money with no issue.  On trail my brand new Arc Air pack broke within a week.  Zpacks repaired the pack and shipped it back to me on the trail at no cost to me.  Meanwhile, I used my Arc Haul pack while I awaited the repair.  When a carbon fiber rod broke on the Arc Haul, the shipped a replacement pair of rods to me immediately at no cost to me.  Near the end of my thru hike, the Arc Air pack broke again.  When I asked Zpacks to repair it a 2nd time, they asked for pictures of the damage.  After reviewing the pictures, they decided to send me a brand new pack.  My pack had endured about 1800 miles on the AT, and was really beat up, but they gave me a brand new pack anyway.  I think that is stellar customer service.","

Arc Haul and she has the Arc Haul Zip. We are sleeping in a Triplex. She has a Zpacks quilt, but I have a Sierra Designs quilt. We both
have Zpacks Vertex rain jackets. We have Thermarest, Outdoor Vitals, Sawyer, REI, Sea to Summit, and
more. Both wearing Altra Olympus trail runners, although I also own
and like my Altra Lone Peaks. My base weight is 18 lbs, hers is 13
lbs. While our big 3 are very light, we are are carrying lots of (too many) luxuries.
I mentioned my fear is setting up and
tearing down in the rain. In addition to our tent, I also bought a
tarp. The plan is that whenever we set up camp, we first put up the
tarp, and then set up the tent underneath it. I've got cam jams on
the guylines of the tarp, so that we can set it up in a minute. Then
I can relax or setup underneath it, protected from the rain. In the
morning I can tear down as easily. The tarp then stuffs into a side
pocket outside my pack. One side benefit, when it is raining we
won't have the constant patter of rain on the tent, the rain will be
hitting the tarp above. We'll still hear it, but not as loudly. That and earplugs should help me sleep better. And whiskey.","

Kitty Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626743,"Jan 26 - We started at Amicalola Falls, and registered at the Visitors Center.  I am hiker #36, and Tag-a-long is #37.  We hiked 7.4 miles to Black Gap shelter.  We don't plan to stay in shelters often, given the associated nuisances:  crowding, snoring, mice; but since we had the place to ourselves, we made ourselves at home.  I set up a tarp to create a partial 4th wall.  Tag-a-long tried to make a fire, but everything was damp, and she gave up.  The weather had been a bit chilly, but went down into the upper 20s that evening.  We slept ok, but a tad bit chilly.  The next day was a constant drizzle, with snow predicted.  Given the weather, and identifying some comfort issues with her pack, we decided to head home.  On the way back to Amicalola we met Tribute, former thru hiker who was helping other newbies get started on their thru hikes.  Nice guy, giving back!
Feb 3 - We left Tag-a-long's car at Woody Gap, and drove my truck to Springer Mtn.  After hiking to the plaque at the top of Springer, we hiked about 8 miles to Hawk Mountain shelter.  Again, we had the place to ourselves.  This time I attempted a fire, and my Boy Scout skills proved themselves worthy.  We enjoyed the nice fire for a couple of hours before turning in.  The temperature was upper 30s this time, and we slept comfortably.  In fact, I had to shed my wool socks and thermal bottoms in the middle of the night.  The next day was hiked 12 miles to Woody Gap.  We were a bit stiff in the calves, but not bad.  
Feb 17 - We did a day hike from Woody Gap to Neel Gap.  Along the way we met Screwball and Arkansas.  Nice views from Blood Mountain.","Springer Mountain

Kitty Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626982,"This past week we
hiked 38 miles, from Neel Gap to Dicks Creek Gap. This will be our
last section until we head out for good on April 1st. We
hiked 8 miles Wed, 16 miles Thurs, and 14 miles Friday. Tag-a-long
is the one who was pushing the mileage. I'm very proud of her and she is one tough he-woman. We might have to find her a new name, because she has not taken a
liking to Tag-a-long.
Some gear observations: 
Umbrellas – we have these goofy
umbrellas that sit on your head, but they work great to keep the rain
out of your face, and off your back and pack. And your hands are
free to use your trekking poles, take pictures etc. And they were
only like $12 on Amazon. Very good deal. 
Zpacks Triplex tent – anyone who
camps a lot knows a 3 person tent really fits 2 people, while a two
person tent really fits 1 person, and a 1 person tent is
just a covered sleeping bag. So the 3 person Triplex fits us very
well, is incredibly light at 23 oz, and is super convenient with 2
doorways and 2 vestibules. Of course, it was super expensive. Condensation is an issue, but manageable. We like it.
Dry sacks – even though our packs are
made of basically waterproof Dyneema fabric, and even though we put
our sleeping gear and clothes in a trash compactor bag inside our
packs as an extra layer of protection, water still managed to find
it's was inside. I don't know what we did wrong! So we are buying 2
waterproof dry-sacks each, for our sleeping quilts and for our
clothes, as a third layer of protection. Wet gear sucks!
And finally, our Dyneema tarp. We set
up the tarp first, which is very easily done in a minute using
cam-jams on the guylines, or a few extra minutes if we don't have 4
convenient trees and have to use trekking poles on one or even two
corners. Now, protected from rain, we can set up our tent, or in the
morning tear it down, without getting soaked. Yes, it is redundant. Yes, it adds 10 more ounces to my pack weight. But keeping our
selves and our gear dry is worth it to me. It probably rains 3 out
of 4 days on the trail during the spring. Another hiker who saw us
thought it was a great idea. I may start a new trend!
We leap-frogged some other hikers on
days 2 and 3. Coffee Maker and Deadliner, and Fred (no trail name
yet) were all very nice. At Unicoi Gap, former thru-hiker Bluegrass,
and his lovely wife, provided trail magic to us and other hikers. There was coffee, beer, juice boxes, fruits, chips, fudge rounds,
pretzels, and more, plus great conversation and hiking advice. At
Dicks Creek Gap, someone left a 12 pack of beer for  hikers. There
were 3 left, so Coffee Maker and Deadliner had one each, and
Tag-a-long and I split the last one. Tag-a-long managed to yogi some
water and bananas from a family that were day hiking. Yogi-ing (a la
Yogi the bear) is getting someone to give you stuff, without begging
outright. She taught them how to be trail angels and give trail
magic. Clever girl!","Neel Gap

Kitty Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627743,"For anyone who reads our journal, I apologize for this untimely and delayed notice that Tag-a-long and I decided to suspend our hike due to the virus.  After arriving home, some good contract work we can do from home came in, so we have changed our hike plan to 2021.  I am jealous of those still out there, and don't blame them at all for sticking to it.  The stats are coming in now, and Stanford U antibody studies showing that mortality rates are not much different than the 2017-2018 flu season, and most people have very little risk of serious illness.  None-the-less, the elderly and those with underlying health issues need to be especially careful (as always), so I don't feel bad about canceling our hike.  See you next year!EDIT (2021) - Ha!  Sure didn't see how that was gonna play out!  There is plenty of contention about how much of the numbers are real and how much is hype, but covid has been serious, and has seriously sucked!","

My wife gave me the trail name of Simple Man last year, but I've heard from Crusoe that he has crossed paths with another wearing my trail name and since he is ahead of me, I'll always be #2.  It has led me on a quest for a new name, and open to being named on the trail.  As luck would have it, successful thru hiker and book author, Ultra Hiking Girl, has bestowed me with the name Kitty Hawk.  In our emails we discussed our pets, as well as trail prep, and she gave the name Kitty because I have two cats I love, Hawk because I have dialed in my gear and pay attention to detail like a hawk.  Shout out to Ultra, who is hiking the AT again this year and on the trail now.
Proposed start date is April 8th.  I'll tell you about my gear and agenda in my next posts.After the hike
edit – My trail name was memorable, because it had a good story to
back it up. Almost every hiker I met immediately assumed I was from
Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. Nope. Or it had something to do with
the Wright Brothers. Nope. Two navy vets thought I must have served
on the USS Kitty Hawk aircraft carrier. Nope. I then explained, and
they always liked the unexpected way my name came together. And some
hikers had seen Ultra's videos, and that added to the story. People
usually remembered me when we met again later, even months later.",,View Entry,"Mar 03, Wed",0

Pack weight runs 20-22 lbs.

After the hike
edit – My pack is discussed in another edit. My tent worked well
the entire hike. I seldom had condensation issues, and used a microfiber towel to wipe down the interior when needed.  I lost a couple of stakes, and replaced them with .90 cent Walmart stakes.  The tri-sided stake generally worked better than the hook style stake, but it was convenient to have both.  I sent the tarp home because it didn't really help
that much. I was lucky that I never had to set up in the rain until
New Hampshire, and only once more after that. Luck and timing. I
did cut my air mattress down to 60 inches length, following
instructions on several youtube videos. It worked well.  My luxury Thermarest air pump was awesome, and some hikers said I could make money renting it to others.  In 2200 miles, I only changed the batteries once.  My extra large Sea to Summit pillow was a luxury that I appreciated throughout my hike.

The Zpacks 20 degree quilt and the Enlightened Equipment 50 degree quilt both worked well.  On the few nights that it got down into the 20s, then I needed both to stay toasty warm.  Fortunately, I carried both from Franklin to Damascus, an extra 12.5 ounces.  After Damascus, the 50 degree quilt was plenty most nights, and when it was a bit cooler I just slept wearing my puffy.  I switched back to the 20 degree in Hanover, and never had any issue with it.

I ditched
my stove and cold soaked for a while, and then I quit cold soaking
too. My food was restricted to protein shakes and food that was
edible straight from the package. It was not healthy, but I packed
in a lot of calories and kept my weight up.  When I did use my cold soak container to make ramen noodles, there was oily residue from the flavor pack, that I cleaned using dirt.  Hiker Truckstop called me a real mountain man when he saw me do that.

I kept most of
my rain gear, but changed from the cheap Amazon umbrella to a Six
Moon Designs umbrella. The Six Moon Designs umbrella was much more
durable. Using the umbrella, I seldom needed my rain jacket. If it
rained hard, the umbrella plus the rain kilt did a good job. The
rain jacket did make a good windbreaker. The water proof socks did
not hold up. I had two pair. One pair quickly got a hole in it, and
the other pair still let water through after a couple hours. 

My Moto G Power phone was
phenomenally good! The battery life lived up to it's reputation as
the longest in the industry. I went six days thru the Smokies on a
single charge by using airplane mode and turning it off at night. Also, I dropped the phone into 3 feet of water in Massachusetts, and
it continued working without a hitch. Kudos to Motorola! I did get
a 5000 mAh battery backup along the way, when I started using the
phone more (calls, texting, music) and to recharge a USB handheld fan
I bought. I know, talk about a luxury item! But it was super hot in
Pennsylvania and beyond. All the guys thought it was hilarious, but
I think they were jealous.

My gaiters are
discussed in other entries. I switched from hiking pants to a pair
of shorts that were lighter and more comfortable. I switched back in
New Hampshire, because I thought it would be colder, but it was not
necessary. August was still warm and I was still sweating heavily. My puffy was great...the very few times I used it. I immediately
ditched the safari shirt. The Icebreaker shirt was nice, but it
quickly became a stinky mess, holding body odor. The wool t-shirt was SO much better,
but by Pennsylvania the shirt started falling apart. I ordered
another wool shirt online (very few outfitters carry wool shirts in their store) and finished my hike with it. Socks. I
stayed with lots of socks. The only problem was my shoes stayed wet,
so new socks quickly became wet. But the clean dry socks were still
nicer to start my day in, rather than the wet, muddy socks I wore
yesterday.  The Injinji Nuwool socks did not last very long, but regular Injinji socks lasted the entire hike.  Darn Tuff socks also lasted throughout.  The wool beanie was nice, but slipped off every time while sleeping.  The balaclava worked ok, but sleeping in my hooded puffy was best on the few nights it was really cold.  Wool gloves and rain mitts were good at keeping my fingers warm, but I did not need them after Tennessee.

I switched from Altra Lone Peaks to the more cushioned Altra Olympus on day four, after experiencing knee pain.  I stayed with the Olympus throughout, finishing my hike in my fourth pair. I also used a Dr Schols insert for runner's knee. This combo helped
my knee recover from initial injury at the beginning (discussed
ahead) and held up throughout some seriously tough terrain up North. I did have continual though mild issues with my Achilles tendons. I
don't know if this was caused by or increased by the zero drop shoe. 

The Zpacks Multipack worked well as a fanny pack.  I switched out the Petzl lamp for a Walmart lamp that was 2 ounces heavier, but was much brighter. The Petzl worked fine in my tent, but did not put out much illumination for night hiking, which I did a few times.  The Walmart lamp did burn up some batteries, so I had to carry spares.  I almost never used my sunglasses.  They might have been useful keeping bugs out of my eyes, which is an important issue in later entries!  If you are comfortable changing diapers, then touching yourself down there is ok to ensure a satisfactory cleansing after using a trail bidet, followed of course with hand sanitizer.  Not carrying TP saved space in my pack, and reduced trail impact as well.  I used only 1 bandaid.  I used lots of Ibuprophen and Naproxin (Alleve).  I carried Doxycycline for Lyme Disease and it ending up being a crucial luxury item.  I, and several other hikers got Lyme Disease, and getting a prescription from my doctor, and filling it to be able to carry the pills with me, saved me significant time and money!  I highly recommend this!

Hanging a bear bag on a tree - I didn't do it.  If the shelter had a bear box, or a pole with cables, I used that.  At first I used an Ursack, but decided that even that 1/2 pound was too much weight.  I put my food in a smell proof Loksak, and then put that bag inside another Loksak just to be sure.  I also did not cook, putting aromas into the air to attract a bear.  I figured a bear would much rather go after the uncontested and poorly hung bear bags of other hikers, than mess with my tent which had little or no food smell.  I never saw or heard a bear.  Some of you will criticize me, but by the time I got to New England, a majority of hikers I spoke with admitted that often did not hang their food.",,View Entry,"Mar 06, Sat",0
Kitty Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633786,"As I said in my first entry last year, one day I asked a co-worker what he was doing (meaning - what was he working on that day) and he replied ""I'm going to sit in my chair and watch my life slowly ebb away.""  That sad reply made me think about how I spent my time, and I realized that I should spend more of it outdoors, hiking, camping, seeing nature, keeping in shape, seeing the country.  My wife also enjoys these things, our child is grown, our house is paid off, nothing tying us down...so why not?  
The more hiking I did, the more I was drawn to the idea of a thru hike of the Appalachian Trail.  I live 4.7 miles from the trail, and only 30-40 minutes from Springer Mountain where the trail begins in Georgia.  It's a no brainer.  It is said that a bad day on the trail is better than a good day at the office.  I am going to put that to the test.
My wife is not going this time (family issues she's taking care of) so I'm on my own.  She is worried that I will be attacked by a bear, or bitten by a rattlesnake, or get Lyme disease, or fall off a cliff.  But it will take a lot more than any of these to stop me!
I have watched many hundreds of hiking videos on Youtube, and greatly appreciate all the information other hikers have shared, but the idea of holding up a selfie stick while I walk, and then spend time editing and posting videos is just not my thing.  I don't mind writing, so this journal will provide my trail memories when I am old(er) and senile, and it gives my family, friends, and well wishers the opportunity to keep track of my adventure.  There are some photos from our hiking attempt last year, and I will post many more photos going forward.  Previous entries detail experiences and gear and hint at some of my insanity, and future entries will be covering new experiences and greater insanity.  Please feel free to ask questions, comment or make recommendations.  You are my virtual friends and family.After the trail edit:  Ha Ha!  I did get Lyme disease, but that didn't stop me!",,View Entry,"Mar 25, Thu",0
Kitty Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634143,"Actually, I am not.  As long as I've got something to eat, I don't care much about what it is.  I can eat the same thing everyday without much complaint.  And I don't have a sweet tooth.  After about 4 years of being a flexitarian, as they call it, a vegetarian that occasionally gets a hankering for a hot dog, I've been full vegan for a year now.  At 61, with no medications of any kind, my blood pressure is 110/70, my cholesterol has dropped from 270 to 185, and I am in great shape.  My only issues are in the joints, and my current diet and stretching routines have greatly reduced if not eliminated issues in my knees and hips.
So here is my meal plan on the trail:
Coffee when I wake up on a chilly morning.  I've always been hard core, but I've switched to decaf for the past couple months to hopefully improve my sleep cycle.  I'll need good rest to recover each night.  In the summer I may skip this and go straight to breakfast.
Breakfast - morning smoothie with a meal shake (it's a vegan protein shake with added fat and carbs) with powdered soy milk, with a scoop of Amazing Greens.  Quick and easy so I can get on the trail.  700 cal.
2nd Breakfast - another meal smoothie, but swap the Amazing Greens for oatmeal, hemp seeds, raisins, and a dash of cinnamon.  1200 cal.
Snacks/lunch/snacks - throughout the day will be Pro Bars, Clif Bars, etc and gorp.  And peanut butter in squeeze pouches.  Avg 1000 cal.
Dinner - a blend of ramen, couscous, hemp and chia seeds, cranberries, powdered peanut butter, and nutritional yeast - may be cooked or may be cold soaked.  1100 cal.
I'm shooting for 4000 calories per day to start.  I know many people don't have much hunger initially, but I have been walking 6-8 miles or more a day since last May.  I'm halfway to hiker hunger already.  In town I'll be looking for Taco Bell, impossible burgers at Burger King, Subway veggie sandwiches, or any veggie options at restaurants.  I'm going to have drop boxes sent to locations with meager resupply options.  I can't guarantee that I won't cave in for some pizza (mmmm pizzaaaaa) or BBQ (mmmm BBQuuuuu) but I am going to try to stick to my vegan diet.
One more week till I hit the trail.
BTW, I only weigh 155 lbs, so I don't have much to lose.  


After
the hike edit - So here's how it went in the real world. I ditched
the stove almost immediately to cut weight. I cold soaked my
concoctions. Within a month I was sick of them. After a pizza in Hot
Springs, I gave up vegan for the remainder of my hike, eating
anything I could. My breakfast was a protein shake, but now whey
protein. Muscle Milk brand has not only a lot of protein, but also
the highest amounts of fats and carbohydrates, to provide a more
rounded meal. To go with it I usually ate a honey bun or some mini
donuts. Lunch was a PB&J tortilla. Occasionally I went with
pepperoni and cheese tortillas. Snacks were Snickers or Milky Way
bars, Peanut M&Ms, gummy whatevers, Oreos, etc. BUT NO MORE CLIF
BARS, PRO BARS, LARABARS etc. I never want to see one of those ever
again! Dinner was another protein shake and couple more tortillas. Everyday I would pray for trail magic, especially for a Coca Cola. Two Cokes would really get me going, In town I ate enough for two at
every meal. Even my hiker buddies were impressed. While many guys
had dropped 20 to 30 pounds, I never lost more than 5. When I got
home, I was only down 2 pounds. 

My
blood pressure is still very low, but my cholesterol spiked 60
points, and my blood sugar jumped up too. I am back on my 100% vegan
diet.",,View Entry,"Apr 01, Thu",0

Since I live in Dahlonega, and can get on the trail any time I want, why start on a bad day?  I was debating with myself that it is always raining on the Appalachian Trail, and I might as well get started.  But the deciding factor was an order I placed for a new pack from Zpacks, a cottage manufacturer.  It was supposed to have arrived last week, but they are behind schedule.  I received an email today that the pack has shipped.  I should receive it by Saturday.  If I wait for the pack, I can start Sunday or Monday and have several nice days to ease into trail life.  Sold!After the hike
edit: The Arc Air pack is very nice, and I like it even better than
the Arc Haul. It really keeps the pack off of your back, so less
sweat. It is smaller, lighter, and more waterproof than my Arc Haul. I did not use a pack liner inside, or pack cover outside, and never
had any water issues with my gear. By the end of the trail I refused
to carry more than 2 days of food, requiring more frequent
resuppling, but that kept my pack weight at 20 lbs or less. 
I did have a
problem with the pack. It has two curved carbon fiber rods that give
the pack it's shape, the curve keeping the pack off of your back. The rods are held in place by very thick material at the bottom. Within a week, one of the rods broke through the fabric, and then dug
into my back. Extremely uncomfortable. My sweetheart of a wife,
brought me my Arc Haul to Franklin, NC, and took back the Arc Air. She mailed it to Zpacks, and they repaired the pack, returning it to
me in Damascus VA. All was good, until somewhere in New England the
other rod would slip out of the sleeve where it is inserted . I
would, with great difficulty, push it back into place, but it didn't
take long for it slip out again, so not providing the proper framing
on that side. Then, in Maine, the first rod broke through it's
fabric at the bottom again. This time, I removed the rod altogether,
creating a semi-frameless pack. This worked ok for the remainder of
my hike. 
Now here is
the good part. When I got home, I told Zpacks about the problem. I
wanted to return it for repair under their warranty. In addition, I
was willing to pay for some other maintenance, because after 1800
miles, the mesh pocket was torn up, and the Dyneema was delaminating
in some places. They requested pictures of the rod issue, and after
review decided to send me a brand new pack! They said that if the
first repair did not fix the problem, and 2nd repair
probably would do any better. So my new pack is on the way. Wow! Now that is great customer service!",,View Entry,"Apr 07, Wed",0
Kitty Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634764,"Are all for naught!  I did all the stretching, supplements, and 20 mile day hikes, so that I was READY to hike 20 miles a day from the get go.  My left knee said otherwise.  I put in 17 miles on Day 1, but should have stopped at 15 (or sooner).  I stealth camped about a mile past Gooch Gap.  Two Alleve's and an Ibuprofen for good measure, allowed me to make 7 miles on Day 2 to Lance Creek Campsite.  It was very crowded, but since the weather was perfect with no chance of rain, many of us cowboy camped (open air, no tent) so that we managed to fit.  Today was another short day of 7 miles to Neels Gap.  Some of us couldn't sleep, so we got up at about 4:00 AM to night hike and see the sunrise on Blood Mountain.  Tough climb in the dark, and on a bum knee, but I did it.  Hopefully a few short days will let the knee shape up.  So many nice people, just a few I met: Kelly, Grace, Andrew, Faith, Mijal, Fern, Kaila, James, Stephanie and her dog Huck, Colleen, Kevin, and Ed.

Kitty Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634785,"I decided to take a zero (zero miles hiked) after my knee stiffened and swelled.  So today's thoughts are observations on the mix of hikers I met.  In a youtube video I saw a couple of weeks ago, the hiker stated he had seen a number of female hikers, but at his campsite that night, all sixteen were men, with about two thirds being younger and a third being older (retired or nearly so).  In my first couple of days I have seen different ratios.  I think it has been closer to 50-50 male/female.  It could be 60-40 or somewhere there about, but a lot of women.  Many older hikers, but I think the number is closer to 80% younger, i.e. 20s and 30s.  Older tended to be 50s and 60s, and a very few 70s.  All of these numbers are guesses.  
In the first three days, I spent time hiking and talking with 7 people (all younger), and talked with a few more in camp (some younger, some older).  Two, myself and Kelly (Kelly Hays Hikes), do contract work, making it easier to take this 6 month sabbatical.  Three experienced job dissatisfaction or burnout, and were considering career modifications or changes after they completed their hike.  One man was retired.  One woman, after some years in the Navy, was working out some post deployment stress.  I heard from my friends that they had heard similar from two other former service members.  Four people I talked with had given up their apartments, or sold their home, and put all of their belongings in storage.  All corners of the continental US were represented.  As best I could tell there were only two foreigners, a young woman from England (who has almost no accent) and an older woman with a German, or Dutch accent, or something like that.
Most people were very social, and happy to be on trail.  There are some introverted hikers, who have to drawn into discussion, but most hikers are glib.  I did meet an older man who was a bit rough, somewhat of a loner, and carried a knife on his hip belt.  I don't want to judge a book by it's cover, but he did not fit the typical AT hiker profile.  
Other than this one exception, everyone was friendly and welcoming (and to be fair, the rough guy was friendly).  All are equal, regardless of age, sex, income, career, or motivations.  Everyone experiences the same trail and the same trials.  There was zero political or religious discussion.  
After
the trail edit – I think my feelings are reflected well in
subsequent entries, but it cannot be said enough that the trail
community is friendly, caring and generous beyond belief. I don't
think I am experiencing much post trail depression, but I certainly
miss the comraderie every day since I left the trail.","Neels Gap

Kitty Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634911,"Another zero day to rest my knee.  A couple of you have asked how I am icing my knee on the trail.  Fortunately, I am still so close to home that my lovely wife picked me up Tuesday afternoon at Neels Gap.  I have been resting in bed or in a living room recliner most of the time.  My knee is feeling much better, but I think two more days of rest are needed.  Tentatively planning a Sunday return to the trail.
On the trail you meet people with similar values and aspirations, and those who hike at a similar pace as yourself are met over and over again.  You get to know these people very well, very quickly.  You help each other.  You watch out for them and they you.  You become a trail family, or tramily.  Over time, you may move out of one group and into another as paces and schedules change.  Or your tramily may lose some members, but pick up new ones.  In only a few days a tramily was forming, and I am the first one out, due to my knee.  Yesterday, Kelly was taken to the ER and emergency surgery, due to a twisted ovary caused by a cyst.  Totally unexpected, and very painful for her.  Her recovery will take at least two weeks.  That made it a bad day.
Some of the crew are taking a zero today in Blairsville, which is an hour from my house.  Last night I drove up there to  meet James, Ed and Grace.  Grace was at the hospital with Kelly, so we brought her food.  When Kelly was being prepped for surgery, I went back to pick up Grace to join us at Longhorn for dinner and drinks.  The four of us a had a great time, which made for a good day.  
I am one of the few that already have a trail name, but last night we did some brain storming (or it was the liquor talking).  Stephanie carried her pack AND Kelly's pack 5 miles to get Kelly to a road for pickup to the ER, so she might become known as ""Badass!""  While the guys sipped our beers, petite Grace was knocking down shots of whiskey neat.  I think her trail name will be ""Whiskey"".

trail edit – In North Carolina we had some cold nights, down in the
20s. Some stroke of genius had me ask my wife to bring my summer
quilt with her to Franklin. So I carried two quilts on the trail,
and together they kept me warm and toasty. I sent the 20 degree
quilt home in Damascus, and then switched them in Hanover, NH. I
seldom had any sleep issue due to cold. I did have sleep issues
though. I toss and turn, and have to pee once or twice each night. I wake often throughout the night. But that is no different than my
sleep at home, so it was no better, but no worse.
My second
night in Franklin I stayed at Gooder Grove Hostel, run by Zen, who is
an interesting character. Jaw was also there for the night, but the
rest of the tramily did not have reservations for another night, so
they either went to a motel, or continued hiking.
After
Franklin, Jaws went home with knee issues, and was unable to return
to the trail. We stay in touch, as I set up a text group for our
tramily. The tramily texts each other ongoing with updates on
progress and milestones. As of today, September 26th,
Kelly (9 Lives), Grace (Mighty Mouse) and Stephanie (2 Pack) are
still hoping to complete their thru hikes. Yes, Kelly came back
after 3 weeks at home recovering from her surgery. She's tough!
In North
Carolina, I met an older hiker named Sherpa. He had thru hiked in
2003 and was trying to repeat because he loves the trail and loves to
meet, talk with, and help hikers. His wife, Rita, or Trail Mom, was
assisting him by slack packing his gear. He had knee issues, as did
I, so that started our conversation. He asked if I would like to
slack pack with them the next day. I was not sure, so he offered to
sweeten the deal – they were staying in a cabin at the Nantahala
Outdoor Center (the NOC) and I could stay with them, enjoy a
spaghetti dinner, and there was a 12 pack in the fridge. SOLD! The
next day our hike without packs was super enjoyable. I was sold on
slack packing. Sherpa and Rita's hospitality really made an
impression on me, and I wanted to, and began paying it forward
whenever possible.
Other
thoughts; the climb out of the NOC, up to Cheoah Bald and then up
Jacob's Ladder, 9 miles altogether, were the toughest climb that I
experienced until New Hampshire.
After the
NOC, the next major landmark is Fontana Dam, the largest dam east of
the Mississippi. I was hiking with a guy named Spokes (he bicycled
from Anchorage Alaska to Leesburg Virginia, like 4900 miles, in
2018). When we got to the marina, we each bought a cold beer. As I
was leaving the store, I saw a bag of chocolate mini donuts. I
impulsively grabbed them and bought them as well. Outside, we sat on
the deck and I polished off the beer and bag of donuts within a few
minutes. It seemed as if nothing had ever tasted so good. Beer and
donuts became a mainstay of my hike. 

The shelter
in Fontana is known as the Fontana Hilton dues to it's large size,
showers, and solar charging station, but the shelter and surrounding
area was packed. Spokes found accommodations at Creekside B&B
and got me in as well. It was luxurious. Spokes took a zero there,
but the next day I headed out, hiked to and over the dam, and into
the Smokies.","Muskrat Creek Shelter

hike edit – The Smokies had some tough climbs, but I mostly
remember the first shelter, at a flattish hilltop, with trees over
open spots for tenting. I remember Elizabeth laying out her tent
footprint, laying on the ground to look for lumps, and looking up for
deadman limbs. I told her not to worry about it, only the good die
young.
For the
first three days I hiked mostly with Duckie and Smoky, but
leapfrogged Elizabeth, Zach and Courtney. Courtney had an all red
tattoo of a mosquito on her leg. I asked what that was about, and
she explained she was a big fan of Pearl Jam, and they have a song
called Red Mosquito. So I thought her trail name could be Mosquito,
but who wants to be named for a pest, so instead I called her Pearl
Jam. She liked it and accepted it as her trail name. Zach's claim
to fame so far was wearing sandals, and jamming his toe into a
rocking chair at the hostel in Hiawassee. This led to a trail name -
Toe Jam. Pearl Jam and Toe Jam. Elizabeth wasn't accepting trail
name suggestions.
Day three
started with a 4 am start, night hiking to Clingman's Dome, the
highest peak on the AT, to see the sunrise. Friends Kaila, Faith and
Mijal were also planning to see the sunrise, but Kaila bailed. I
enjoyed a freezing, windy, but spectacular sunrise with Faith (who
became Strawberry Lightning) and Mijal (who became Allstar). Later
in the day I arrived at Newport Gap, where many hikers were going
into Gatlinburg. I had decided that the glitzy, expensive tourist
trap was not for me, and I was carried six days of food to get me all
the way through the Smokies. I ran into Spokes at Newport Gap, but
he was zeroing. I was introduced to Trip, known for her stumbles. Spokes introduced me to Shooter, who was continuing, so I joined him. Shooter is also 61, so we had much in common, but my pace wore him
out. When we ran into Elizabeth, she agreed to join us, but only if
I would slow my pace. Shooter decided to change his schedule, and
soon went home with knee problems. For the next few days, Elizabeth
and I hiked together, at her pace. She told me of many interesting
and strange experiences and accidents she has had. I told her she
needs to write a book.
My wife
joined me at Davenport Gap, the end of the Smokies, to slack pack me,
so that I could do bigger mileage and make it to Hot Springs in two
days, where I would spend a zero with her. I was able to convince a
reluctant Elizabeth to join me on this slack pack. The first day was
rainy and cold, and at the end I was worried about hypothermia as we
waited for my wife to pick us up. But day two was sunny, with scenic
views from Max Patch, and a good, but long and tiring 21 mile hike
into Hot Springs. That put the kabash on Elizabeth hiking with me,
and she explained she enjoyed a slobo lifestyle. The play is on nobo
(northbound) and sobo (southbound), where she is slow bo. At the

much to offer for my sightseeing wife. She was ready to head home,
and I was ready to get back on trail. The tramily was arriving, but
they would zero. Kelly was coming back at Hot Springs, but I wasn't
sure she would make it. Elizabeth and Kaila were taking another
zero. No Duckie or Smoky, or anyone else I knew to be seen, so I hit
the trail alone. For the next several days I hiked alone, though I
met other hikers. 

One day I met up with a pitbull. He was alone, and staring into the
woods, which made me think he might be looking at a bear, and I
should be looking too. But when I saw no bear, I looked back at the
dog, who was now staring at me. He started slowly approaching me,
with an almost lifeless stare. Pitbulls are known for their violence
and their strong jaws, so I was scared. If he charged, I hoped my
trekking poles could fend him off. But he came up to me, sniffed me,
and looked at me expectantly. He had a collar, and I guessed he
strayed from his owner or his home. I sensed he was hungry, so I
gave him the only food I had that I thought he might enjoy – peanut
butter. He lapped it up. I gave him all I could. His collar had
the owner's phone number, but I had no cell service. So I wished the
dog luck, and continued on my way. The dog followed me. I thought
“oh great”, just what I need. I soon came to a dirt road, and
there was a couple giving trail magic. They offered to take the dog
back with them and call the owner when they had service. In addition
to food and drink, they also brought a guitar, so I was able to play
a few songs for them. They were former thru hikers named Mickey and
Minnie.

About this time I started writing my limericks in the shelter
journals. As I hiked I would pick someone and think of a limerick
about them. By the time I reached the next shelter I had crafted my
rhymes. 

One of my stays was at Mother Marian's Hostel. Marian and her
husband take in up to 4 hikers in their home. Her husband is a
retired Navy commander. The other guests included a former Navy POL
(Petroleum, Oil, and Lubrication) and a retired Air Force surgeon. The service stories and commentary on post service life were
constant, and entertaining.","Davenport Gap

I have met so many people that I always run into friends in every town, every hostel, every hotel, every bar that I step into.  I met people that have heard of me, from other hikers, or seen the limericks I've been leaving in the shelter logbooks.  I've been writing one or more for each of my hiking buddies.  Some examples:
The Brooklyn gal would talk, 
Of the slobo lifestyle she'd walk,
So no matter where she be,
On the AT,
She'll never catch Kitty Hawk.

Another:
Her trail name is Mighty Mouse,
She can drink all the whiskey in the house,
Is that why she trips, 
From all of those sips,
And jumps off of boats when she's soused?

And:
This rhyme I really want to peddle,
For 2pack no less can I settle,
When Kelly went down,
2pack got her to town,
The woman deserves a medal!

Each reflects things happening or have happened to us.  
My joints are holding up, but each day there is a new pain.  It's like each body part gets it's day to bitch about what I'm putting myself through.  While most male hikers are loosing weight I have gained 3 pounds.  However, I am getting tired of the vegan meals I prepared for myself, and have started eating anything put in front of me.

After
the trail edit – I was not planning to zero in Erwin, but I ran
into Spokes again, and it was his birthday, so I stayed. We also
celebrated the birthday of Brews Traveler. Brews is a personal
trainer, who brews beer for fun. He won first place in a contest for
one of his brews. So naturally, our celebration involved beer. The
next day, Spokes and I headed out, with Juice, who was 17 at the
time. Juice was having some trouble with his shoes, and he fell
behind. Spokes and I continued hiking together for about 190 miles,
until he also went home with knee problems. Are you seeing a
recurring pattern?","Hot Springs, NC

Kitty Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637269,"At mile 395, staying at the Mountain Harbor B&B and Hostel.  It is very nice, as hostels go.  Everything a hiker needs: bed, food, shower, laundry, resupply, and beer.  Still hiking with my buddy Spokes.  His 57th birthday was a few days ago in Erwin, so I was easily convinced to spend a zero day in Erwin, relaxing and drinking beers to celebrate his birthday.  Another friend, Brews Traveler; it was also his birthday.  More beers.  The next day Spokes and I started with Duncan Donuts, got a ride back to the trail from a kind stranger, and hiked 21 miles.  The next day another 19 miles, and yesterday an easy 11 to the hostel.  This hostel has been voted by hikers to have the best breakfast on the trail for 13 consecutive years.  I've only another hour to experience it for myself.  
I stay in touch with many of the friends I've made, via cellphone, but they are gradually falling behind.  Elizabeth and Kaila are a day behind.  Ed is 2 days.  Kelly, Grace, and Stephanie are 3 or 4 days back.  I have no clue where Duckie and Smokey are.
The plan, after a humongous breakfast, is to stumble back to the trail and try to make Damascus, VA in 4 days.
""Kitty Hawk is one of the fastest,
But today he's as slow as molasses.
His energy, it's clear,
Comes from donuts and beer,
Which he'll need to get to Damascus.

the hike edit – At Mountain Harbor I met Nimbowill Nomad, a legend
on the trail. He is thru hiking again, at age 82, and will turn 83
this year, making him, if he completes his hike, the oldest person to
have thru hiked the AT. I ran into him again in Maine in August. He
meets people constantly, so I did not expect him to remember our
meeting back in May. When I showed him our picture from that first
meeting, he looked at me and said “You're starting to look like a
thru hiker.”   So I'm starting to look like a homeless vagabound –

We've been told that things flatten out as you approach Virginia, so we thought we could do another 25, but we were  deceived.  It was tough hiking and we stopped after 18 miles.

Damascus is a very nice town.  Every lawn is mowed and there is almost no litter anywhere. It seems that almost anyone who owns a house has a B&B.  Damascus has a convergence of 7 major national and regional hiking, bicycling and motorcycling trails.  They are extremely hiker friendly.  Every year there is a Trail Days Festival, where approx 20,000 current and former Appalachian hikers attend.  This year's festival was last week, so I missed it, but I'm kinda glad.  I'm a kid at heart, but that kind of craziness is too much for me.
Spokes and I got in before 9 am and went straight to the Damascus Diner for a great breakfast.  It might have been the 2nd best I've had on trail.
Stats so far:
I'm guessing I have  climbed up an down approx 200 mountains (wild guess), walked 470 miles of trail, not counting non-trail miles also walked, and completed 3 states.  Zero falls on trail, although I have fallen twice in camp - stupid actions but no injuries.  I have rolled the ankles a few times, but again no injury.  I've had 1 very minor blister, on my heal that occurred around the 400 mile mark.  I am mindful of my knees and Achilles tendons, but no real issues.  I hike faster than most.
Critters seen:
Bears - 0
Rattlesnakes - 0

Kitty Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637960,"Spokes and I left Damascus and hiked to the Grayson Highlands, home of the wild Shetland ponies.  They are very used to people, as many visitors come to the park, in addition to thru hikers.  The ponies usually allow touching, but can become overbearing if they think they can get food from you.  They have been known to nip people, and even to kick if you get behind them.  I was helping another hiker named Thunderstruck get a picture petting a stallion, when he nipped her.  She made a second more cautious attempt and he started turning his body around to kick, so I reached out to slap his but and jumped out of the way.  I might have saved her a serious injury.  
After the Highlands, we pushed north for a couple of days toward Marion,  Virginia.  We learned the city provides free bus service from the trailhead, so we hopped into town to do our resupply at the only town near the trail with a Walmart and grocery store for the next 100 plus miles.  There are some Dollar General's and convenience stores along the way, but I needed a few things from Wally world.  We each got a room at a cheapo Travel Inn, did our shopping, drank a few beers and hit the sack.
Spokes knees had been bothering him, so he decided to take a zero, to be followed by some shorter days.  So we have, for now, parted ways.  Looks like I wore out another hiking partner.  First my tramily, then Elizabeth, and now Spokes.
The next day I did 24 miles and passed the 1/4 way mark.  25% of my mission is accomplished.  I then hiked past Atkins Virginia, where I reviewed 2 doses of trail magic.  I'm going to soon write about the many instances of trail magic I have received on my hike.
Yesterday I decided to do a short day of 17 miles, as my feet we tired, and stayed the night in a hostel owned by a retired  English doctor who moved here from Africa, to a Victorian home in the middle of farmland in rural Virginia.  He walks around in a poorly fitted suit, and the place is run by a former thru hiker named Lemonade.  So Doc and Lemonade are quite the characters.  The place is not in good condition, it is not clean, but after my initial surprise (disgust) I have come to enjoy my stay.  They provide everything a hiker needs, the view is beautiful, the atmosphere peaceful, the company is good, and Lemonade makes some killer cheeseburgers.  I'm headed back to the trail this morning.

Kitty Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638219,"Talk about extreme differences, Mountain Garden and Woods Hole are polar opposites.  But first, let me tell you about the in between.  Lemonade took us for breakfast to Mattie's Place, an Amish general store.  The food was great!  He then dropped us at the trail at 11:45, which is so late it's almost like the next day.  But the terrain was mostly good, and I hiked a good pace.  I figured if I got in 15+ I had a good day.  About 11 miles in I ran into a young couple I had met 2 days prior.  Bubbles and Fastlane hiked slow.  I blew past them the first day, hiking those 24 miles, set up camp, ate, met fellow hikers, and then the  couple pulled into camp at dusk.  I thought ""good for them"".  Bubbles excitedly told me about a bear she had seen a mile back, their first one.
So onto the second time I overtook them, we chatted a bit.  I asked how far they were going, and they replied they wanted to get to Trent's Grocery, a well known spot.  But to get there would be a 34 mile day.  They replied they knew, and would night hike to do it.  I told them that was crazy, and I was totally onboard if they didn't mind my tagging along.  They were actually excited to have the company and off we went. 
Discussion as we walked proved that looks, and first impressions can be deceiving.  This very young and physically small couple had thru hiked in 2019 and this was their 2nd time around.  They were both intelligent and well read.  Fastlane is a black belt in ju jitsu, with a degree in environmental science and Bubbles is a graphic arts designer in the music industry in Nashville.  
We had a great time together, and ended up hiking until 3 am, going 32 miles.  In the morning we hiked the last 2 miles to Trent's Grocery where enjoyed brunch.  Then we hiked to Dismal Falls to enjoy the water and soak our feet.  Fastlane pulled out a 6 pack of beer and that made the time all the better.  Unfortunately, Fastlane had been struggling with trench foot.  After working on his feet the previous few days, he realized he needed medical attention and rest, so they got off trail to head home to Tennessee for a week.  More trail partners injured while hiking with me.Incidentally, Spokes had to go to the emergency room due to the pain in his knee.  It is bad tendonitis, and he is now home for a 2 week recovery.","Mile 576

Or your tired and discouraged, and it's been raining all day, and you wish you were in town, but the next town is 20 miles away.  You cross a forest road.  You will only be at that place for a few seconds, but at that very  moment a total stranger drives up, stops and asks if you need help, and then takes you 20 miles to town.  The trail provides.  ( True story, as told to me by 2 hikers).

Or you've been wearing a hiking shoe that just doesn't fit right, and over time has been causing you serious pain.  You've decided you're going to have to get off trail, so that you can shuttle to a town with a good outfitter, where you can get better shoes.  It will be time consuming and expensive.  But soon after this decision has been made, the trail leads past on old schoolhouse dated  1912.  It is maintained by a nearby church, who have a register inside for visitors to sign (mostly thru hikers).  Out of curiosity, you step inside to check it out, see the register, but then see, underneath the table the register is on, a pair of hiking shoes in decent condition, IN YOUR SIZE!  The trail provides.  (True story per the hiker, and he showed me the shoes).

Kitty Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639041,"Over the last few days, I start each day alone, as most of my friends are now behind me, but I meet someone who I hike with who becomes a new friend.  Going into Buena Vista, and met a guy named El Tigre, who was hiking fast.  That challenged me to keep up (being the competitive little shit that I am).  Turns out he was hiking 20 miles, and while he had his pack with him, it was mostly empty - he was slack packing.  His wife was visiting and had most of his gear.  I had my full pack, and my total would be 29.5 miles if I went to the same destination, which would get me into Buena Vista so I could recharge my phone and grab some food.  Yes, I kept up, and we pushed each other.  He was happy to offer me a ride.  The 3 of us had dinner together and then they dropped me off at the Budget Inn.  

I did not expect to see him again, as I thought he would be slack packing and would have a head start to the trail head, but the next afternoon, while I was taking a snack break, there comes El Tigre.  I must have passed him while he took a break at a shelter, and so we met and hiked the rest of the day together.  We camped at the Priest Shelter, located near the top of Priest Mountain.  Because of the name, hikers use the shelter ledger book to confess sins.  I had nothing to confess.

The next day was El Tigre and wife Hallie's anniversary, so he was off trail.  I met a elderly gentleman from New Jersey, but originally from Cuba, named McQroll.  I chatted briefly in Spanish with him, with plans to continue when we reached Devil's Backbone Brewery.  It rained lightly on the way, but began pouring as we waited at the roadside trying to get a hitch.  Luckily, a kind couple stopped and took 3 of us (me, McQroll and McLovin, named from the character in the movie Super Bad) to the brewery, which had marvelous beer and good food.  I first had a vegan burger and a salad, then a giant soft pretzel, then a plate of wings, and then a pasta dinner, along with 4 beers.  We camped for free on their grounds, and got a ride back to the trailhead by Stanimal's Hostel in Waynesboro, which took my pack with them, and I hiked 18 miles into Waynesboro with just a small daypack.  Nice!

I got a private room at the hostel the first night.  I did not book 2 nights originally, but decided to stay an extra day to rest up and resupply, so I've had to move into a bunk room that holds 5 hikers.  There is a decent guitar here, and while playing it I met a guy from Athens, GA named Mando who is staying here, and he brought his guitar with him, so we played together and for a small audience for over an hour.  He is a good player and we had fun.  McQroll is also staying here and provided me with beer all day.  Mando made a giant plate of scrambled eggs and cheese which he shared, and a staff member made BBQ sandwiches, so I've been stuffing my face all day.  

Tomorrow I head into Shenandoah National Park, which some hikers who thru hiked before say was their favorite section of the AT.  The trail is well maintained, not too hilly (compared to the rest of the AT anyway), and has waysides about every 30 miles, which offer food, milkshakes and resupply options, so I won't have to carry much food in my pack.  There is also a good chance that I'll finally see a bear, as there are many in the park, second only to, of all places, New Jersey.  NJ has more bears per square mile than any other place on the AT.  Who would have guessed?

Montana is the trail angel from Front Royal.  When she brought me back to the trail, she gave me a card and asked if I would carry it with me.  On it was a picture of her eldest daughter, Anna, who was killed by an impaired (meth) driver on 2/19/19.  On the back is the heart wrenching story, of which I learned more about later, as you will see.  I promised I would carry the card, and the memory of Anna with me to Katahdin.

Truckstop and I planned a 3 day hike into Harpers Ferry, to arrive on Saturday.  His wife was driving down from their home in Maine to meet him on Saturday, and I had a room booked for  Saturday.  We hiked a leisurely pace, but still did 24 miles.

Friday we made it to Virginia's infamous ""Rollercoaster"", a series of puds (pointless up and downs).  It was no worse than anything we had already experienced, but compared to the relatively nice terrain in Shenandoah, it was annoying.  We managed 21 miles.  However, we did hit the 1000 mile mark, a momentous achievement!

We had been hiking with, or near MoJoe and Finder for quite a while, the same two who helped find my lost phone a couple hundred miles back.  (Did I mention that in a previous entry?). MoJoe's wife was also coming to Harpers Ferry on Saturday, so we planned a Sunday lunch for the 4 hikers and 2 wives.

Truckstop and I did the final 9 miles into town, and stopped first the the AT Conservancy headquarters.  The ATC coordinates the actions of the twenty something trail clubs that maintain the trail (i.e. The Georgia AT Club, etc.) and the state and national parks that the trail goes through.  They also promote and educate on Leave No Trace principles, monitor and maintain usage stats, and keep thru hiker yearbooks by taking pictures of hikers and getting some basic info.  I was hiker #535 to come thru this year.  Given there are an estimated 4000-5000 thru hikers this year, of which  3000 or more were ahead of me, the attrition rate is significant.

Harpers Ferry is a small, historic town, famous due to the 1850s rebellion led by John Brown, and it's strategic location between the Shenandoah and Potomac rivers during the Civil War.  Downtown is comprised of buildings from that era, preserved, with many providing displays of historical and architectural significance.  There is also a busy section of shops, restaurants and bars.  We found a place serving breakfast, and had a good meal.  Truckstop then left to join his wife, while I stayed to sightsee and find an outfitter.  It was time for new shoes.

I had previously texted another thank you to Montana, who then offered to drive up to Harpers Ferry if I needed another ride.  I did need a ride to my hotel, 7 miles away, but agreed only if she allowed me to buy her a meal.  She picked me up in the afternoon and we ate at a restaurant called The Anvil.  Here I learned the full story about Anna, and about all of the things Montana was involved in, to help her cope with her grief.  This woman has a big heart.  We also talked about trail life, and I mentioned some of my friends and tramily.  Montana told me I could  give them her number, and she would help them too when they got to this section.  Wow!

At the hotel I showered, did laundry, and resupplied at Walmart.  On Sunday I was picked up by MoJoe and his wife Wendy, and Finder, to meet Truckstop and his wife Jennifer.  Due to my good dining experience, we went back to The Anvil, and had a great time.  Truckstop insisted on picking up my tab.  It seems I came along and hiked with him at a difficult time and it helped him, and he was thanking me for that.

New list - trips (times I trip on a rock or root).  Truckstop noticed I was tripping alot.  I wasn't falling down, but it happened a lot.  I had been aware of this for a long time, wondering when I would fall.  So we started counting.  At the 20th trip, all of which happened that morning, I stopped to check my mileage.  I had tripped 20 times in 9.1 miles.  This happened just over the 1000 mile mark, so doing some quick extrapolation, we determined that I had hiked 9.1 miles about 110 times, so 111 x 20 = 2200.  I have tripped over 2000 times without falling!  I have to credit my trekking poles.

This does not include slips.  Slips occur on wet rocks or in mud.  I slip from time to time, but not nearly as much as I trip.  I have had 2 falls due to slips, at mile markers 853.7 and 1009.5 (what a memory, huh?).  Both occured on wet rocks when I did not have my poles engaged, I just carried them in one hand.  Always, always keep trekking poles ready and in use!","

",The Mind vs the Body,"Jun 29, Tue",0
Kitty Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640041,"I previously posted about the saying ""the trail provides"".  Is it a superstition, a silly idea, karma?  Most (maybe all?) thru-hikers believe it. As most of my readers are not thru hikers, you probably have your  doubts.

If you read the mind vs the body entry, you know my shoulder has been hurting lately.  Quite a bit.  My father suggested a topical lotion called Zoltaren.  I already knew of this lotion from my friend Bill Kaler, and I had used it when my knee tendonitis flared up at the start of my hike.  When my father made the suggestion, I was no where near a drugstore, and did not expect to be for several days.  

If the shoulder wasn't bad enough, my shin started mis-behaving the very next day.  And the following day it started shooting sharp pains up my leg.  I then worried that 1) I couldn't keep up with Finder and MoJoe anymore, and 2) I might need to zero for several days, and 3) it was going to be a painful walk for a couple days into Hamburg PA, where I could get some Zoltaren.  

So we stop at a shelter to get some water, and inside the shelter is a tube of Zoltaren.  I kid you not.  I quickly applied the lotion, which greatly reduced the pain, and allowed me to keep pace with the guys and make it to town.  And I don't have to buy a tube, cause the trail provided me with one.

Bizarre coincidence? 

Gaiters are cloth shoe covers that keep rocks and debris out of your shoes.  I started the hike with a pair, but every time I wanted to switch my convertible pants from long to shorts, or air out my feet, I had to take off the gaiters before I could take off my shoes.  It was just one extra step and seemed inefficient, so I sent them home.  

A lot of dirt has been getting in my shoes, and my feet are filthy each night.  It takes more effort to clean them, which is also inefficient.  So I decided to go back to gaiters.  In Harpers Ferry the outfitter did not have my size.  In Boiling Springs the outfitter did not have the right type.  In Duncannon the outfitter did not carry them at all.  Three strikes.

Two doors down was a laundromat.  I needed to do laundry.  There was a wall of washers.  I picked one to wash my clothes. There was a wall of dryers.  I picked one and opened it to put my wet clothes.  Inside of this otherwise empty dryer was a pair of gaiters.  I kid you not. The right kind, the right size.  I kid you not!  The trail provides.","

Kitty Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640044,"I left Harpers Ferry with Finder and MoJoe, doing about 22 miles per day.  I had wanted to be pushing 30 miles each day, but their good company, and a tender Achilles tendon, encouraged me to dial back my mileage.  Must listen to the body.

We passed quickly through West Virginia's short mileage, into Maryland.  The trail was not flat, but gently rolling, sometimes mostly smooth, but sometimes extremely rocky.  It took only 2 days to cover the 40 miles in that state, and cross the Mason-Dixon line into Pennsylvania.

Also known as Rocksylvania, where boots go to die.  Infamous for the last 75 miles of fields of rocks.  Paraphrasing an author whose name I can't remember, most places have rocks and dirt, but Pennsylvania has rocks on rocks, on top of more rocks.  There are rocks growing on rocks.  If you look up (not advisable, very dangerous) you'll see rocks growing on trees.  I've hiked about 150 miles in this state, and it has often been very rocky.  But as the song says ""You ain't seen nothin yet!""

Pine Grove Furnace, PA is the current half way point to Mt Katahdin, Maine.  There is an AT Museum there, and a general store where some marketing genious came up with the idea that hikers should eat a half gallon of ice cream, since they are half way to their goal.  They have probably sold a million dollars of ice cream to hikers.  Some can't eat the whole thing, some get sick trying, but generally we are a very hungry bunch, and most of us finish the half gallon and go hike 10 or 15 more miles.  In my case, after finishing my ice cream, I hiked 8 miles to another general store, where I ate a meatball sandwich, a milkshake, and a large bottle of gatorade.  

A day or two later (they all blur together) we arrived in Boiling Springs.  It is a very picturesque town and there is a lake or reservoir that had the clearest water I've ever seen.  We ate breakfast at Cafe 101.  Delicious!  I had the french toast special and the mexican breakfast special.  Yes, two breakfasts.

A couple days later we arrived in Duncannon.  It is a small blue collar town.  I don't know what they have going on besides the trail going thru it.  There is a hotel from the 1800s that is now a hostel (where no one should stay) with a bar on the main floor.  I was expecting a large saloon a la old west, or old english pub, but instead was sitting in a smallish room, whose primary decorative feature was aliens.  No clue.

We are now in Hamburg, which features the largest Cabelas in the world, and more importantly to me, a Walmart.  We go back on trail tomorrow morning, to face the dreaded rocks.  We also face the heat, with the heat index over 100 degrees each day.  Ouch!

After the trail edit -  looking back on it, Pennsylvania had some tough hiking from Palmerton and beyond, but nothing near the difficulty of New Hampshire.  At least PA was generally flat.  I guess it is perspective, because Elizabeth had a foot problem while in Pennsylvania, and she absolutely hated hiking there.  Several hikers thought New York was ok, whereas I hated the continuous ridge climbs (again, a pre-cursor to New Hampshire.  Everything is a precursor to New Hampshire.)  But my perspective is colored by the fatigue I felt from Lyme disease, discussed in an upcoming entry.","Harpers Ferry

Kitty Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640156,"A couple more days in the books, first 24, and today 21.  We stayed at the Old Mill apartments, setup by trail angel/shuttle driver Mike Sheridan aka Sherpa.  He picked us up in Port Clinton, which we hiked to from Hamburg, and took us to the trail head, picked us up at the end of the day, and took us to the 2 bedroom apartment, setup for hikers.  Today he took us back to the trail and later picked us up in Palmerton.  Both days we slack packed, carrying just the essentials - lunch, water, water filter, and a few odds and ends.  Yesterday was super hot, so the rocks were tough going, even without the weight of our packs.

Today it rained most of the day, which made it cooler, but also made the even more rocks we encountered slippery.  There were a few places that were dangerous if you weren't extremely careful.

I've been battling shin splints for 4 days. So far I've used Zoltaren lotion, Ibuprophen, and compression while hiking, and ice and elevation at night.  My next option is amputation.  Only 2 days left in Pennsylvania.","Hamburg

Kitty Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640158,"A common trail question is what is your favorite piece of gear?  My answer is always my pee bottle.  No piece of gear saves me more time and effort.  Every night I have to take care of nature at least once, if not twice.  I don't have to unzip my bug netting (letting in pests), nor put on shoes, find a spot to go, and hoping I'm not stepping in poison ivy.  Definitely my best piece of gear.

Honorable mention goes to my umbrella.  I first brought an umbrella hat that I got on Amazon.  Bill Kaler bet that it would not make it to Katahdin.  Bill, I owe you a beer.  The umbrella was attached to a head band.  It worked well, unless it was windy, or it hit low hanging branches.  Then it slide around or completely off.  It soon began falling apart.  So I bought a Six Moon Designs hiker umbrella.  It works great, handles wind and low hanging branches well, can attach to my shoulder strap so that I can still use both trekking poles.  It is also great at providing shade on the occasions I am not under the forest canopy.  Highly recommended.","

Animals:
Bears - still zero.  I must make too much noise.  My poles click or clack more than most.  Truckstop says he knows when I am approaching just by their sound.
Snakes - 2 rattlesnakes and 2 water moccasins.  I made up a song for the rattlers: Rattlesnake, rattlesnake, friendly neighborhood rattlesnake.  Will he bite?  Rest assured, poison is your reward.  Look out!  There is a rattlesnake.
Obviously sung to the theme for Spiderman.
Ticks - still 3.  Surprisingly none in PA, although MoJoe has gotten a couple.  The man is a tick magnet!
Pretty much the same on all the other animals.  Lots of deer, rabbits, turtles, birds, etc.

Trips (you know...stumbling over rocks and roots) - I previously counted 20 trips in just 9 miles, extrapolating over 2000 trips during this thru hike, without a fall.  I don't know if that was just a bad day, or if counting keeps me better focused, but lately I'm counting less than a dozen in the entire day.  However, slips continue to cause falls.  I had my third fall at mile 1057.9.  Again, as in the previous 2 falls, I was not using my trekking poles.  You'd think I would have learned by now!

Insects flying into my eyes - surprisingly no more, so still at zero for the left eye, and 7 for the right eye.  Maybe that bounty on my right eye has been cancelled.  One can only hope.

That damn horsefly - is back!  After over 100 miles of torment, he stopped bothering me in the Shenandoahs, until the past couple days.  My hiker pal Elizabeth said I should name him.  I'm taking nominations.","

I had 2 ticks attach at the beginning of Shenandoah Natl Park. I thought I extracted them, but maybe something got left behind.  I don't remember exactly where they bit, but it was lower leg.  They say it can take a couple  weeks for symptoms to appear.  So around Duncannon I get an achy and swollen shin - symptom #3 on healthline.com.  I started putting lotion on it, got a rash, and thought I was alergic, but rash is symptom #1.  By the end of the week, I couldn't keep up with my hiking companions.  Fatigue is #2 on the list.  I got a headache, thought nothing of it, but that is symptom #4.  So I conclude a tick bit my shin and gave me lyme shin.  You may say ""Kitty, go to a doctor!"". The worst case scenario is the doc will say 'Yep, you got lyme disease.  Take doxycycline for 14 days.' Well, my doc in Georgia already gave me a 14 day perscrip, and I have carried the pills with me, so I already started treatment.  🤕On the bright side, I don't have to go off trail for a week or more to rest my shin.

Kitty Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640686,"Hi everyone.  I'm feeling fine.  The antibiotics seem to be helping already. The swelling is gone, the rash less pronounced, and the shin is less tender.  

In case anyone looks at the mileage counter and wonders how I hike ginormous mileage, the miles are the total hiked since my last input, normally about a week apart.  My daily average is probably 22 miles.  My high is 32.  Today is zero.

Since I don't provide a daily accounting of where I've been and what I've seen, you may benefit from the journals of my latest hiking partners: Finder and MoJoe.  They both write in trailjournals, so for the past 17 days you will see exactly where we have been and what we have experienced.  Their journals include pictures and videos that include me.

I have also posted more pictures.  

The rocks in Pennsylvania are for real, and they wore out my shoes alright.  But I think Maryland had some sections with serious rocks, as did New Jersey, and don't even get me started on New York!   New York has had these ongoing ridges you have to boulder scramble and rock climb. I don't see how shorter or less athletic people make it.  And if it is raining...very dangerous.

A few points of interest: the Deer Head Inn in Delaware Water Gap, PA, established in 1853, is the oldest continously operating jazz club in the country.  My father went there in 1957.  I went to the inn and looked inside during the day. I was really looking forward to going back to hear some great music and enjoy a beer, but didn't make it due to the fatigue and leg pain I had from the lyme shin.  It was also raining that night.Another highlight was the Bellvale Farm Creamery, in New York, established in 1819.  When it opened at 12 noon, there was a line of people waiting to buy, on a Wednesday.  I had two milkshakes, and they were awesome!Another highlight was the trail in New Jersey.  I was expecting short sections of woods between suburban areas.  Instead I walked thru vast green, pretty country, with some of the nicest trail so far.","Palmerton

Kitty Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641067,"Kitty Hawk is back on trail;
Northward bound without fail;
Have no doubt,
'Bout how it'll turn out;
On Katahdin he shall prevail!
Many of you know I got back on trail last Sunday.  I sent this limerick to many of my hiking friends, and three of them sent back limericks of their own.  It's nice I inspired them to be creative.
So everyone's question is how is my lyme shin? I have been taking the antibiotics for 10 days, four more days to go. My shin is completely pain free, the rash is gone, but I am still fatigued.  I have been mostly hiking slower, and doing less mileage.  I feel better overall.
Sunday thru Wednesday I hiked alone, crossing into Connecticut from New York. While passing thru Kent I met a nice young couple named Peas and Carrots.  We decided to hike out together, and continued on Thursday.  I pushed myself to keep up with Carrots, but when Peas led, neither Carrots  nor I could keep up with her.  And she is only 5' tall.  Her little legs were eating up the miles.  She's a beast.
Friday we parted, as I wanted to go to a restaurant a half mile off trail for breakfast, while they wanted to go on to a market/deli 10 miles up the trail.  I wanted that 2nd stop as well, and ended up catching them at the deli, so we ate together.  We parted again, as I wanted to hike a little further and cross into Massachusetts. 
In the beginning of this hike, every state crossing was a big deal.  'Yay, I finished Georgia' or 'Yay, I made it to Virginia!'.  Now it is more like 'Well, here comes Mosquitochusetts, ugh! Next is Vermud.'
Mosquitos are awful up here.  They really started in Pennsylvania, and have been getting worse state by state.  We hikers associate the bugs with the state we're in, but the reality I'm sure is the season.  Virginia had no mosquitoes when I was there, but I'm sure there's a bazillion of them now.
I mentioned a while back that trail angel Montana had asked me to carry a picture of her daughter, killed by an impaired driver, to Katahdin with me.  Anna liked hiking, just like her mom does. I have been taking a picture of Anna's picture at the state crossings, and sharing those with Montana.  Here is the most recent.  I'm also putting the back of the card here so you know what happened.  When I get to the sign at the top of Katahdin, I'll take Anna's pic there too.


So now I'm in Great Barrington, Massachusetts.  There is a Holiday Inn here, so I'm spending the night to shower, do laundry, resupply at the grocery store, clean and repair gear, and scribble in this journal.  Tomorrow I plan to get back on trail.  I would like to get to New Hampshire by the end of the month, but that is 240 miles away.  I hope my fatigue passes and I can gradually ramp up the miles between now and then.
MoJoe and Finder are now 2 days ahead of me.  Truckstop and El Tigre are 2 days behind me.  Of my original tramily, Kelly (9 Lives), Grace (Mighty Mouse), and Stephanie (2Pack) are in Pennsylvania, as is Elizabeth (still no trail name).  Ed (Steady Eddie) may be in Jersey or New York.  James (Jaws)  and Spokes are still sidelined with knee problems.
I may hook up again tomorrow or the day after with Peas and Carrots.  We shall see how it goes.

Almost forgot.  Just as I was nearing Great Barrington, and came upon a roadway, there was a huge tent, and people from a church grilling food for hikers.  As it was late in the day, I was the last hiker before they packed up.  Then they offered to drop me at my hotel which was 6 miles away.  They fed me and saved me time and money.  Yay, trail magic!","Ft Montgomery, NY

Kitty Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641300,"It rained a ton the past couple weeks.  I mean serious flooding.  A section of the trail just north of Great Barrington  runs beside the Housatonic River, which overflowed its banks.  In some places, the trail and adjacent fields were just an extended part of the river, three feet under water.  The Appalachian Trail Conservancy ""closed"" several sections of trail thought to be either dangerous or impassible.  In reality, ""closed"" only means they sent out a bulletin, or got the local trail club to post a sign.  Many hikers, including yours truly, did not get the memo.  Not knowing how bad it was, I hiked.  At first the water in places is a couple inches deep, which is normal after a good rain.  The shoes get wet.  But then the water got a foot deep.  I had never seen that before, but the shoes are already wet, right?  So I continue.  Then its 2 feet deep and I'm thinking this is crazy.  Then it's 3 feet deep and the tall grasses are under water, and I'm thinking I need to turn around.  But checking the GPS map, I'm almost at the end of this section, and the trail elevation was soon to increase.  Hoping it doesn't get any deeper, I trudge on.

Now it gets better.  I'm pulling my shorts and briefs up to my crotch to keep them dry, because unlike socks, I don't have a 2nd pair.  Pulling them up pushes my phone out of my shorts pocket, and into the water my phone goes.  This is not clear water, but dirty, muddy brown water.  Fearing my phone is gone, all concern about getting wet is out the window, as I bend over and reach for the bottom, blindly feeling for the phone.  My shirt, fanny pack, shorts, are all getting soaked, but I find the phone.  And miraculously, it's working!  Perfectly.  I can now say that my phone not only has the longest battery life in the industry, it is also waterproof to at least 3 feet.

Anyway, that day and the next 2 were hell on trail, trying to get through or around bogs.  My feet were prunes the whole time, and my shoes and socks a muddy mess.  

Yesterday was a better day, and today was finally a good day.  The weather reports call for some clear and cool days, so I hope to cover some ground, and enjoy it.

Regarding my lyme disease, I finished taking the antibiotics.  Fatigue seems to come and go, but I have been improving.  Chow!","Great Barrington

Kitty Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641485,"And I thought The pain ended in Mosquitochusetts.  Ha!  All the rain that drowned Massachusetts hit Vermont too.  The trail is a mud pit.  Yesterday I hiked through miles and miles and miles of mud. If misery loves company, I needed a bus load.

I crossed into Vermont and that morale boost was short lived, as fatigue slowed me for the rest of the day.  I barely made 14 miles.  At this point, I consider myself to be a professional hiker, able to comfortably do double that distance, so I was disappointed.  I've had several days like that, hiking 14 to 16 miles.  Other days I feel good, and hike 20 to 23 miles with gusto.  I don't know if it's the Lyme disease, or just bad terrain and low moral.

My shoulder continues to hurt (that I fractured in the car accident years ago).  Naproxen helps greatly, but sometimes even that is not enough.  I am weeding out of my pack anything not getting used regularly, and trying to keep my food supply at 3 days max.  The goal is to never exceed 20 pounds.  That means 4 days of hiking won't work (I'll run out of food), and these short days are a problem.  MoJoe is ahead of me, and says there is less mud ahead, which will be a blessing if true.

BTW, my buddy Finder has left the trail, leaving MoJoe to forge ahead by himself.  Finder was having problems with his feet, and he was tired of the trail.  He expressed it well in his journal entry on Friday the 23rd.  I can relate to a lot of what he said.  Feel free to look at his trailjournal as I am not going to rehash it here.  I have to admit that the thought of leaving has crossed my mind a few times since New York.  Is that the Lyme disease talking, or the trail?  

They say never quit on a bad day.  If the sun is shining and there is a beautiful view, and you decide you're done, it's time to go... then it really is time to go.  I haven't had that moment.

Right now I am enjoying a zero day at the nicest Hampton Inn I have ever seen.  That may explain why it cost me nearly triple the points to stay here. (For those that don't know, I have lots of hotel points racked up from all my travel as a consultant.)  Manchester Center is a lovely town to spend a weekend.  Shopping and eating par excellence.  

In addition to my usual chores of shower, laundry, and resupply (in that order), I went to an outfitter to have my trekking poles serviced.  One had a tip broken, and the other had a release mechanism stuck.  I also bought a replacement water filter, just so I have maximum water flow in my last 600 miles.  Filters  gradually clog up and the water flow can become annoyingly slow.

I've been looking for a wool t-shirt to replace my existing wool shirt for the past 600 miles.  I have been sewing the holes that keep appearing, until it looks like a Frankenstein shirt, but at least I'm not showing a bunch of skin.  I finally ordered a replacement online, shipping to my next stop in Rutland, Vermont.  I likewise ordered my 4th pair of shoes, Altra Olympus 4, as I cannot find them in any local stores either.  I tried on several shoes today, but there were none that I felt I could entrust my feet to for 600 miles.  Nothing is more important than foot health.

Speaking of, I got my first blister a few days ago. I wear a wool sock and toe sock as a liner to prevent blisters. It has worked for 1600 miles, plus a few hundred more before my thru hike.  Because of the rain and mud, and both pairs of sock sets being a muddy mess, I decided to wear a third pair of toe socks I carry (very unusual for a thru hiker to carry more than 2, some only carry one).  I don't have a 3rd pair of outer socks, so my foot slid around more than usual, had more friction, and more moisture obviously than usual, resulting in a blister on the ball of my foot.  At my wife's advice, I did not pop it, but instead cleaned it with an alcohol wipe, and let it air dry overnight, so that the blister did recede.  Then covered with a bandaid, plus a corn pad to help protect it, it was a non-issue the next day or thereafter.I hope to hit New Hampshire in 5 days, but that assumes I have good days.  Coming in the next entry, which you may or may not read before this entry, is a List Update.","Williamstown

Kitty Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641489,"Let's start off with a bang!  In the bugs that fly in my eye category, the left eye finally scores!  And it happened just a few minutes ago.  I'm in Manchester Center, Vermont, waiting on a pizza I ordered from Sam""s Pizza Shack, when I saw it coming at me.  In an instant I knew left eye was going to score, which amazed me as much as it pissed me off.  So left eye is finally on the scoreboard with one bug.  However, back in Mosquitochusetts, 2 more bugs hit the right eye, so current score: left eye 1, right eye 9.  Still statistically untenable.

In the sad category of hikers who went home due to illness or injury within days of hiking with me, known as ""the Kitty Hawk Effect"" I will say no new victims.  However, some might argue that Finder's recent withdrawal from the trail, being partially due to foot issues, qualifies him.  I disagree, as he hiked two more weeks after we parted, and his departure involved more than just his feet hurting.

In the category of wild animals, still no bears.  I'm just too noisy a hiker.  I did see a beaver yesterday.  He was a curious fellow, swimming toward me until he was about 10 feet from shore.

After the earlier calculation of tripping being possibly in the thousands, I stopped counting.  In the category of falls, I've actually had 5 more, adding to the previous 3 for a total of 8.  Going over 800 miles before my first fall, they seem to be coming now at an increasing pace.  Twice, on a large slanted boulder, my foot slid down until my butt was sitting on the boulder.  Almost comical.  The next time,  my foot hit my trekking pole, but my body kept going.  Normally, the leg adjusts and I catch myself to save the fall, but with the pole planted and stopping my foot, I instantly knew I was going down.  Number 4 was sliding in the mud, foot going one way, the body going the other.  Number 5 was grabbing a sapling to swing my body past a section of mud.  I've done it quite a few times.  This time, the sapling bent like a wet noodle, landing me on my back in the mud.  That was actually my pack in the mud, which I was later able to rinse off.  My feet were technically still on the ground, and I was able to pull myself up towards the saplings base to extract myself.  But a pack covered in mud is a fall in my book.","

The trail is about 10 miles from Rutland, but there is free bus service.  In town I came to the Yellow Deli, a restaurant and a hostel run by the 12 Tribes.  A communal cult many call them, but the hospitality is excellent, the facilities top notch (for a hostel) and the food is delicious.  The hostel is free...they ask for a donation or a work for stay, but no obligation.  Definitely worth my donation.

I want to share 2 things I share with fellow hikers.  Two things I've figured out about hiking.  Honestly, I don't think they take me seriously.  What do you think?

1st - the faster you walk, the greater is the air pressure that is created by your body pushing the air in front of it.  So you are generating your own breeze.  The faster you walk, the stronger the breeze, so you cool off.  The faster you walk, the cooler you get.2nd - When does the body have the greatest need for water?  When it is dehydrated!  So obviously you should save all your water for when you're dehydrated.  That's when you really need it.Now that I've shared those pearls of wisdom, I'll sign off.  Need beauty sleep. 🥱","Manchester Center

Kitty Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641720,"3 more days of hiking brought me across the Connecticut River which separates VT and NH.  The first day out of Rutland I felt sluggish.  I no longer felt like the guy other hikers said hikes like a 21 year old.  I felt like I aged 30 years (that would make me 51...I know I'm really 61, I'm talking about how I feel inside).  Kind of discouraging to age so quickly.  I only hiked 10 miles that day, although I did spend 2 hours at McGrath's Irish Pub.  I know what your thinking.  I waited over an hour for them to open while it rained outside, and I only drank Cokes.

That 10 miles got me to Jeff and Nancy, with whom I camped.  They were doing trail magic the next day, but gave me some magic early with a great dinner and great conversation.  In the morning they fed me a great breakfast.  Although I didn't get on trail until 9am, and stopped later for more trail magic from Wilderness Bob, and spent an hour at the pie lady's store (yum), I still hiked 18 miles because I felt great. I felt better than I have since Virginia.  

Today I did not feel quite as good, but still hiked another 18 miles into Hanover in good time, beating the rain.  I am staying at the Hanover Adventure Hostel.  As it is raining a good part of tomorrow, I will zero here and get back on trail Tuesday.

It is said when you reach New Hampshire, you only have 20% of the trail left to hike, but 80% of the work still to do.  The White Mountains of New Hampshire, and much of Maine, are the hardest parts of the trail.Fyi - I looked at the step counter on my phone:April 453,731May 1,093,101June 1,355,041July 1,218,204","Rutland

Kitty Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642242,"In Hanover, I stayed at the Hanover Adventure Tours Hostel, which is actually located across the river in Norwich Vermont. A good facility with great staff.  I decided to zero there.

On my zero day I went back into Hanover, home to Dartmouth University, and picked up a package from my loving wife containing my cool weather sleeping gear.  While there I ran into Peas and Carrots, and Tagalong.  That called for a celebratory pizza and beer.  We finally finished and were preparing to walk around town, when my buddies El Tigre and Pitfall, with whom I had hiked with in Virginia, arrived, requiring more celebratory pizza and beer.  El Tigre and Pitfall were also staying at the hostel but the others were not, so we parted.

Marched out of Hanover the next day in good weather thru nice terrain.  It was a refreshing difference from previous weeks.  We did about 25 miles.

Subsequent days took us to a great sunset at Smart Mountain, next day to Mount Cube, and then camping at Eliza Brook beside a river and waterfalls.  Perhaps obe of the best camping spots on the trail yet.  

After this we entered the infamous White Mountains.  It was no joke.  It was hard climbing and tougher descents.  Take the steepest climbs of North Carolina and Tennessee, add to them the worst of the rocks in Pennsylvania, put away your trekking poles cause you'll need both hands to climb, and pray to your God it doesn't rain.

First Mount Moosilauke, with great views.  Several more moutains, after which we camped. The following day a few climbs and then Franconia Ridge, with incredible views!  Up to Mt Lafayette and more incredible views, and then a few more peaks until we arrived at Mizpah Spring Hut.  Huts are really lodges run by a staff of young people who carry in all the supplies and food.  And then carry out all the trash.  Tough work.  No wonder they charge $180/night to stay, and are happy to let us thru hikers have any leftovers from their paying guests.  The more we eat, the less waste they have to carry out.  Win - win.

After the trail edit:  Above I mentioned running into Tagalong again.  I met him on the day I crossed into Vermont, and then later hiked with him a few days in Vermont and into New Hampshire.  What is interesting about our meeting was not only his name, Tagalong, being my wife's trail name, but also that he had embroidered on his pack ""A simple Man making his way through the Galaxy.""  My original trail name was Simple Man.  I think it a bizarre coincidence.  Sadly, Tagalong injured himself in the Mahoosic Notch, dislocating his patella.  Search and Rescue had to get him out.  Another casualty of the trail.","Hanover, NH

Kitty Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642297,"I didn't finish updating you yesterday.  We left Mizpah Spring Hut very early Monday morning to hike to Lakes of the Clouds Hut, and then on to Mt Washington, which is notorious for having the worst weather in America.  The highest wind speed ever recorded over land was there at 231 mph.  There have been 161 fatalities since 1849.  There average only 40 sunny days per year.  It snows every month of the year.

I'm Happy to say we had sunny calm weather, but it was still a tough hike.  The path is nothing but rock rubble and requires careful footing.  See the pics.

After standing in line for the obligatory photo at the summit sign, we headed futher to climb Mt Madison.  There is a line on Mt Washington because it is a very popular destination, with 3 cog trains bringing people up and down the mountain all day, in addition to the day, section and thru hikers that make the journey.  

The climb and descent of Mt Madison was equally difficult.  We managed 15 miles that day before reaching a campsite.  On Tuesday morn we hiked 5 miles to a road where we were picked up by a shuttle from The Barn Hostel in Gorham.  We spent the night and zeroed yesterday.  Today, the owner slack packed us, and we hiked 21 miles from where we left off the other day, hiking over 8 different peaks, back towards Gorham.

It was hard work, even without our packs.  The rocks were slippery from rain last night.  I rolled an ankle and had a Peter Griffin moment ( a Family Guy tv show reference) and fell 4 times.  For the first time I had some real, though still minor injuries.  On one fall I got a knot (or contusion for the erudite) on my left forearm. The other injury occurred when my feet gave way on a steep slippery boulder, and I slid down about 6 feet on my back.  I have a nice raspberry on my back, a small one on my left wrist, and some scraps on both calves.  Add to this tired feet and knees, and tomorrow will be a shorter and slower day.

We are only 16 miles from Maine.  Our first road intersection in Maine will be Grafton Notch, where we will be picked up on Saturday by Sherpa and his wife Rita, who I met and hiked with in North Carolina.  They are off trail now, but have invited us to stay in their home.  They were so nice to me in NC, and this goes way beyond to host me, Pitfall, El Tigre, and his wife Hallie, who is driving up to join us Saturday. Sherpa and Rita have never even met the other 3, but are opening up their home to all of us.  I'm sure I'll have pics and more to share in a few days.","Gorham NH

Kitty Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642732,"Everyone wants an update.  So here it is: left eye 2, right eye 13.  If you don't know what this means, you have not read all the journal entries.  Go back to the first ""Lists"" entry.

After that news, the rest of the story will seem bland.  El Tigre, Pitfall and I (the 3 amigos) left Gorham on Thursday, and on Friday were crossing into Maine.  On Saturday, we tackled the Mahoosic Notch, the hardest mile on the AT.  The Notch is a one mile stretch of bus sized boulders that you have to climb around, over and under.  There is ice there year round, so it gets very chilly.   Trekking poles are useless, it requires hands.  Our hands were getting numb gripping the freezing wet rock.  There are plenty of scary climbs, drops and leaps.  It could be fun, working the obstacle course, but it rained on us.  It took almost 2 hours to go a mile.

After the Notch is a very hard climb, also no fun in the rain.  It was a long day for us, hiking from 6 am to 7 pm, but we had a mission: to meet Sherpa and his wife Rita. They were waiting for us at a trailhead in Grafton Notch.  They have a second home nearby, providing us with 2 nights in soft beds, showers, laundry and home cooking.  They also lent me one of their cars to run around. I hope I get to return the favor one day. 

El Tigre's wife Hallie also joined us that day, driving up from North Carolina.

From Monday through today (Friday), we have worked our way across Maine.  Having Hallie meet us at trailheads with food, hold our packs, and carry us to a motel 2 nights made the hiking bearable. We still have 187 miles to go. 
 
Sadly, El Tigre had to leave the trail today.  His father has severe Alzheimer's, and has been in hospice for some time. Recently, his condition has deteriorated drastically, and doctors are trying to keep him alive long enough for El Tigre to make it home.  It's a 20 hour drive.  Pitfall and I send him and his family our deepest condolences.  I know El Tigre will be back to finish his journey when the time is right for him.","Gorham NH

After
the trail edit – The Kennebec River is wide. Crossing has been
done by many hikers but is dangerous. There is a dam upstream, and
periodically, water is released, resulting in sudden unexpected
surges. After a hiker drowned, the ATC hired a rafting company to
transport hikers across in a canoe. I was happy to get in the canoe
and I helped paddle. In Caratunk, we stayed at the Sterling Inn. It

",Monson,"Aug 24, Tue",37
Kitty Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643542,"At long last, the trail has been hiked.  I was going to say the journey completed, but I am still a long way from home.

The 100 mile wilderness begins with a sign that warns there is no place to get supplies or help, and recommends carrying at least 10 days of food.  That makes sense.  Many people hiking this section are day or weekend hikers, who are challenged to hike even 10 miles a day.  Even Sobo hikers are just starting their thru hike, and haven't built up their trail legs yet. But us Nobos are hiking professionals who can knock out the 100 miles in 3 to 5 days.  

I hiked the wilderness in 4 days.  19 miles day one, after a late start, over mostly nice terrain.  Day two was tougher, with a lot of climbs.  However, along the way we were surprised by trail magic.  As we hiked along there was a sign not just announcing trail magic, but it specifically was addressed to Kitty Hawk and Pitfall.  Who could that be?  Who knew where we were, and would come all the way out here?  It was spooky.  Turns out Sherpa and Trail Mom knew when we entered the wilderness, and guestimated when we would arrive at a place they could get to.  The fed us, and every other hiker who came through.  It was such a beautiful thing!

Days three and four were (relatively) pleasant.  We did 31 miles and then 26 miles into Abol Bridge.  There were spots where we got views of Katahdin.  K-town, the Big K.  The end was in sight, and it was majestic.

At Abol Bridge there is a campground and a camp store.  I immediately downed the required 2 sodas to restore my blood sugar levels.  It was too late to enter Baxter State Park, and there is a sign-up and permit process required to hike the mountain.  So we had to either get to the nearest town, Millinocket, which is 30 minutes by car, or pay an exhorbitant $30 to tent at the campsite.  Being older, financially solid, and tired, Pitfall and I paid for a campsite.

We saw 3 young hikers, a guy (Goat) and 2 gals (Rocket and Slayer), nearby with a couple of six packs, debating their options, and what it was going to cost them.  After conversation revealed they were good kids, I offered to pay their fees to tent in the campsite, in exchange for some of their beers.  They happily agreed, and bought a couple more 6 packs to ensure Pitfall and I were well taken care of.  

Since we had a merry group and plenty of beer, I decided to buy some firewood, and made my first campfire on my thru hike.  We had a great time.

After breakfast the next day, Pitfall and I said our farewells, and hitched into Millinocket, because the weather forecast was rain and thunderstorms for the next 2 days.  It is a very bad idea to climb Katahdin in that kind of weather.  We changed our summit day from Sunday, Aug 29 to Tuesday, Aug 30.

You recall that Pitfall rented a house in Millinocket for the week of Aug 29 to Sept 4.  We went to the house, which was large, nice and comfortable.  Two days of rest were just what the doctor ordered.

Along the way we invited some hikers to come stay with us if they needed a place.  Slayer was one, and a gal I met twice in Virginia, named Kiddo, who we were constantly leapfrogging in Maine was the other.  Kiddo was on her 2nd AT thru hike, having done it 10 years prior.  What I did not know, until she took us up on our offer, was that she also hiked the Pacific Crest Trail and the Continental Divide Trail, and so was a triple crowner.  In addition, she is a wilderness guide at Glacier National Park, has hiked in the Alps and New Zealand, and she guessed she has hiked 18,000 or more trail miles.  That is incredible.  She is also a talented pianist and guitar player, with a beautiful voice.

On the big day, Kiddo asked to join us on our summit climb.  We were glad to have her company.  It was a challenge to keep up with her, but Pitfall and I met the challenge.  It was a sunny day.  The first 2 miles up were hard work, at the adrenaline fueled pace we set, but not crazy.  The next two miles were serious and difficult rock climbing.  The final mile was a rock scramble in a foggy haze, as the mountain decided to shroud it's crown from the sun.  

It was cold and windy at the top, despite it being sunny and warm below.  There was no view.  But the famous sign at the summit was there to greet us, and we took many pictures.  I was happy to have achieved my goal, at long last, but not overwhelmed by my happiness, nor sad it was over. I felt that I should feel more, but maybe, being 61, I didn't need to feel like I had a life changing experience.  I felt from the beginning of this hike that I did not expect or want to change my life or my career or my perspectives.  I just wanted to do something epic.  I hiked 2193 trail miles, and who knows how many off trail miles, walking from Georgia to Maine.  I saw beautiful landscapes, and wildlife, and met many wonderful people. It has been a good hike.","Monson

Kitty Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643552,"If I write a book, I'll need an epilogue.

What next?  Many hikers asked if I will hike the Pacific Crest Trail, or some other significant trail?  Maybe.  Early on I enthusiastically said yes, I will hike the PCT.  But now I'm not sure.  I'm tired.  I miss my wife and I miss home and my simple routines there.  I want to play my new Taylor guitar.  But I don't feel quite ready to go home.  My nephew Cris and niece Karina go to school in Boston, and my sister is there right now as well.  I would love to see them.  I have never been to Boston.  Pitfall and MoJoe both live near Boston and have invited me to visit.

Truckstop also invited me to visit him in Maine, but he has not yet completed his hike.

I still have numerous friends on the trail, and I would love to see them, maybe surprising them with trail magic.  Some have even asked if I would hike with them for a bit.  Maybe I would enjoy that?

I'm helping Sherpa and Trail Mom this weekend. They do a hiker feed each year on Labor Day weekend.  Some well known trail angels are friends and also attend: Miss Janet and Odie.  I have not met the legendary Miss Janet, and look forward to meeting.  Guess I'll figure it out.","

Kitty Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644595,"I
have re-read all of my entries, and added “After the trail edits”
to many of them, providing commentary on what happened, what worked
and didn't work, and detailing more of my experiences. It gives you
before and after perspectives.  10/13/21 - Lots of after trail edits to the March 6 gear entry, and misc other after trail edits.

While
I have your attention, here's how things worked out in the end. Pitfall and I,
along with his wife, and mother and her SO, stayed at the rented
house in Millinocket after our summit on Tuesday, August 31st,
eating, drinking and resting. We basked in satisfaction and relief. I promptly sent out texts with my summit picture to family, tramily
and other trail friends. On Thursday, we got up early and drove to
Acadia National Park. We wanted to see the sunrise from Cadillac
Mountain, the first point in the US to see sunrise, but learned that
the park has recently begun requiring passes to drive up the
mountain, and no passes were available to us at this short notice.
The park says the passes reduce congestion and assure parking. Instead we drove around, parking along the coast and walking a couple
of miles, enjoying the sights and fresh air. 

Near
lunch time we drove to nearby Bar Harbor, a tourist mecca, and did a
little shopping. We contacted Sherpa and Trail Mom, who live nearby,
and they were able to join us for lunch. Sherpa and Trail Mom
were planning their annual hiker feed for Labor Day, that Sunday. I
volunteered to assist, and switched my pack and gear from Pitfall's
vehicle to theirs. I said my goodbyes to Pitfall and gang, and spent
Thursday night with Sherpa and Trail Mom. On Friday, Trail Mom and I
loaded up their truck and rode to their other house in Ormand, near
Grafton Notch, on the way buying groceries for the feed, and stopping at a music store to buy new strings for Sherpa's guitar. Sherpa planned to join us in their RV later in the day, after running
his own errands. The house already had hikers staying there: Fiddy,
who I shared a room with in Pennsylvania, and his fiance Bremba;
Hops, who I met and gave a beer to at the NOC in North Carolina; and
Buns. 

On
Saturday, the hikers took advantage of their opportunity to slack
pack a section of trail. Sherpa, Trail Mom and I then went to
Rangeley, which was having it's annual Trail Fest. There was a good
crowd of people enjoying the music and events, along with some trail
legends. Hawk is a hiker who this year completed his sixth thru hike
of the trail. So Hawk meet Kitty Hawk. :-)   I had been following his
youtube posts before I started my hike. I also met Warren Doyle, who
has hiked the trail more than any other person, 18 times - 9 thru
hikes, and 9 complete section hikes of the trail. He once held the
record for the fastest time to complete the hike. Odie, founder of
the hiker yearbook and trail angel was there. I met Odie previously
in Waynesboro VA and again in Hanover NH. The Ice Cream Dude was
there, a trail angel who gives ice cream sandwiches to hikers up and
down the trail. I met him in Tennessee. And I met Miss Janet, a
trail angel who for the past 15 or so years has ridden up and down
the trail in her van helping hikers. One event was an ice cream
eating contest, split into groups: children, adults, and hikers. Odie sat next to me in the hiker group and demonstrated about a half
dozen different attempts to cheat, to the amusement of all.  A young hiker who did the 1/2 gallon challenge in five minutes won, but I came
in 2nd place.

Sunday
we took the truck and RV to Grafton Notch to set up the hiker feed. When we arrived we found two other angels also setting up, so we
combined efforts, and had food, beverage and seating for a large
group. And hikers soon arrived. A bus load of hikers from Colby
College arrived, which is Sherpa's alma mater. We fed them while
Sherpa regaled them with colorful accounts of life at Colby, and of
hiking the AT. Then thru hikers began arriving, and before long we
had around 30 to feed and entertain. I played guitar, and Sherpa
ad-libbed a blues song for the crowd.   Among the group were my good
friends Strawberry Lightning and Fern. I had met them on day one in
Georgia, done sunrise hikes with them at Blood Mountain in Georgia
and Clingman's Dome in North Carolina, met in Franklin and at the
NOC, and we had been texting throughout, so it was great to see them
again.  

A
group of hikers took Sherpa up on the offer to stay with us in
Ormand, including Meriweather, from Snellville GA, and Running Bear,
who has her own blog on trailjournals, and she is a witty and
entertaining writer. I spent Monday and Tuesday with this group,
with me using Sherpa's truck to take them slack packing. On
Wednesday, Bremba wanted to sightsee Portland, Maine, which has bus
and train terminals, so I said my farewells to Sherpa and Trail Mom. In Portland we checked out the fish market and Shipyard Brewery, and
then I took a bus to Boston. My sister, nephew and niece picked me
up, and I spent the next four days walking Boston, sightseeing with
my sister. Our wanderings included Boston Common, the Boston tea
party, the graves of Samuel Adams, John Hancock, etc, many buildings from the Revolutionary War era, the harbor, the Samuel Adams Brewery, and
the bar from the TV show Cheers. 

I
was walking about 10 miles a day, hoping it would ease my stiff feet
and joints. As on the trail, I felt good when walking, but hiker
hobble set in whenever I sat or lay down for any period. The
stiffness and tenderness has not left me, almost a month after my
summit. I flew home from Boston on Monday, Sept 13. It is nice to
be home, to my wife, my pets, all my belongings, my daily routines. Thank God I don't have to return to a job like many of my friends. I
have notified my contacts that I am back and available. They
congratulated me for completing my hike, and assured me they will
keep me in mind when the next opportunities arise, but for now my
time is my own.

So
let's get down to it. How do I feel? What changes do I want to make
in my life? When am I going hiking again?  After a few days at home I thought it would be good
to start my exercise routine again, to stay somewhat in shape and
help my soreness. So I did light stretching and walked 2 miles on an
inclined treadmill for a couple of days. My knees and hips went from
bad to worse, so I stopped. The balls of my feet are still sore, and
my toes still tingle. But it is subsiding, and when I feel normal
again I will resume my workouts.

Seeking
before and after comparison of my health, I had blood tests and blood
pressure checked last week. I confirmed that there is no Lyme Disease
bacterium present in my blood. My before blood pressure was 110/70. After blood pressure was 114/72. That is close enough that I'd say
there was no change. However, my cholesterol went from 185 to 244,
up 59 points! And my blood sugar also went up above recommended
levels – damn those Coca Colas! And honey buns, and snickers bars,
and... I am back on my vegan diet 100%.

Mentally,
I am fine. (I realize the irony of that statement.)  I miss the comraderie of the trail. I assuage that by
continuing to text my tramily and other trail friends, by setting up
a photo album of my hike, and by doing this update.  I have over two thousand pictures, and culled the duplicates and out of focus pics, and those that have little meaning even to me, down to around 900 pics.  From there I selected about 120 best shots for the photo album, writing in the date, mile marker, and brief comment for each.  I would totally enjoy looking at more pics, but figure that most people who are not hikers would get fatigued by too many. The rest of my
time is spent maintaining the wilderness on my property. Dahlonega
is like a temperate rain forest, and the vegetation quickly takes
over. My wife did a good job while I was gone, but my hand is still
needed to maintain the property in a resort-like condition. I
believe that mindset developed when I was young, living in the Virgin
Islands and staying at a resort. My home would make a great B&B,
but my wife doesn't want to do laundry for other people every day.

After
living out of a backpack for months, many hikers feel urges to
minimize their possessions and simplify their lifestyle. I thought
about it quite a bit on the trail, and discussed the concept with
some of my hiking buddies. Now that the hike is over, I have no urge
to purge. I am comfortable with all that I own and the space in
which all is kept.
Will I go hiking? I am already
looking forward to day hikes and overnighters. I have invited
Meriweather and Peas & Carrots to come up for a reunion hike of
Blood Mountain, and to do some trail magic. They responded
affirmatively. As for thru-hiking, that remains to be seen. The
Pacific Crest Trail, with it's better weather, smoother trail, and
phenomenal vistas, is very alluring. And unexpectedly, the idea of
re-hiking the AT has planted itself in my brain. I think I will like
the opportunity to re-visit things that I enjoyed, see things that I
missed, and re-experience the wonderful trail community. However,
the soreness is still too present and work impacts too vague to make
plans now.
So again, I have added “after the
trail edits” to earlier entries for your review.  I may continue adding edits and detail as memories come to mind.  Thank you for
reading my journal. I hope you enjoyed. And on a final note, there
have been NO bugs flying into my eyes, left or right, since I left
the trail!","Mt Katahdin
