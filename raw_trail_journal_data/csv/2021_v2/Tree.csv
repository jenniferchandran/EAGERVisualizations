Tree,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624325,"Dear Family and Friends,
I hope this note finds you well.  I am writing to let y’all know I’ve decided to attempt a thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail (AT) which means, as a north-bound hiker, the journey begins on the summit of Springer Mountain, Georgia and ends at the top of Mt. Katahdin, Maine for a jolly distance of approximately 2,189.2 miles.  I like the .2 because it reminds me of the marathon’s 26.2 miles.
The AT was the brainchild of Benton MacKaye, a land planner and conservationist.  But it was Myron Avery, an attorney and explorer, who made it a reality.  Sadly, the two men had different visions, could not agree and finally had a permanent falling out.  It was Avery’s plan, that the AT be solely a hiking trail, which won in the end.
Apart from a general awareness of the AT, my inspiration for this adventure is Emma Gatewood, better known by her trail name “Grandma Gatewood” who was one of fourteen and mother of eleven.  At 67, she was the first woman to thru-hike the AT unsupported which means walking the entire length in one go with no help. Emma slept in a shower curtain and wore Keds. I expect to be better equipped.
On March 5, 2020, I will be 67, which happens to fall on a Thursday just as it did back in 1953 so good karma is with me.  I’m in pretty good shape, having had only three children, and am preparing to be in better condition come next March. I have read much about the trail, followed a couple of bloggers all the way, watched a bunch of videos, taken copious notes, scouted REI/L.L. Bean/ Amazon and spoken with a few true thru-hikers so I’m feeling pretty good about it.  I’ll have to get used to the backpacking lifestyle, eating less greens and fresh fruit, filtering my water every day and being smelly.

Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
This is the forest primeval. The murmuring pines and the hemlocks, Bearded with moss, and in garments green, indistinct in the twilight, Stand like Druids of eld, with voices sad and prophetic,
Stand like harpers hoar, with beards that rest on their bosoms. Loud from its rocky caverns, the deep-voiced neighboring ocean Speaks, and in accents disconsolate answers the wail of the forest.
In 7th grade, I had to memorize the above two stanzas of Longfellow’s epic poem.  Although most of Longfellow’s story is lost to me now, his description of Acadia’s forest still stirs me.

I love hostels. I love the hostel community, the inclusivity of it. Hostels are still the way I travel today.
Well, I just got off the phone with an AT thru-hiker who suggested, with good reasons, that I seriously consider hotels over hostels when hiking the AT. WHAT?!?
It’s no surprise that hikers on the AT support whole communities as they trek north, south or the flip-flop route.  There’s a window of time in which a lot of money can be made by towns near the trail. Cha-ching!
Hostels, which may initially look like a good deal, can become exorbitant on the AT due to extra charges for everything including towels, food, showers and laundry services.  I don’t know. I do know I am prepared to take care of myself during this effort and, if I decide I need a hotel occasionally when I go off trail to resupply, I’m going for it!

Turns out her youngest son had successfully completed the trail and she had dutifully served as his support person offering to help me out as well. WOW!
Judy then popped up and ran down to her basement returning with a full blown map of the AT mounted on foam-core board.  She was happy to lend it to me and I was thrilled to take it.
It sits in my bedroom, propped on a chair, sending out  “You can do this” vibes.

My teachers are awesome and my fellow hikers…well, I could go on and on...a GREAT group!  No complacency here.
Recently, I led my second hike. I had nailed a solo preview after two teacher guided efforts so felt very confident the day of.  Man, right at the rock!  The directions couldn’t be any simpler.
I took a left and my mentors had to rein me in.  UGH.  The rest of the two hour effort went according to plan.  When the hike leaders met for coffee afterwards, I was happy I had Christmas cards and cookies for them in my russack.
All of this is to say that the AT is marked with white blazes (165,000) which are painted on trees, rocks, structures, etc. all the way from Georgia to Maine. Posted approximately every 70 feet, they guide hopeful hikers along the way. 
I guess if I go left on the trail instead of right, if I miss a blaze, I won’t have a trusty sweep to call me back.
I may end up in Ohio!

I am about half way through it and have learned a lot ~ the proper setup for a campsite, S.T.O.P., ways to hang a bear bag, what to do in a severe lightning storm, how to forge a stream, knots, risk assessment, safety management and first aid.  Of course, nothing teaches like authentic experience.

I feel prepared.  I’ve read field manuals, taken notes, scoured stores and websites for gear, watched any number of youtube videos and have had many chats with hikers of all sorts including several A.T. thru-hikers.  Although my backpacking experience is minimal, I think I can manage it.
Initially, my checklist was huge...it had a life of its own...but now it's under control.
I prepare for the worst but expect, in my heart, the ABSOLUTE BEST the trail will give me.  Living outside for five to six months is an extreme undertaking. I am not a pampered person.  I think I can do it.  I want to enjoy the quest but the devil is in the details!
I recently placed all of my gear on my den floor in an attempt to look it over and  get my pack weight down. What to take?  What to leave behind?  A fellow 2020 A.T. hiker lent me a scale so to weigh every gram and it nearly drove me crazy!

This journey has been a long time coming and there are many people to thank...my family, wonderful neighbors, good friends and the hiker community!
Shout outs to Andy, Bill and Nancy, Cathy, Donna, Joan and Jennifer for watching over my house and getting me to Georgia safe and sound.
My first day on the Appalachian Trail was rainy, foggy, windy and cold.  They say, “No Rain, No Pain, No Maine”!  I made it to terminus and managed to sign the soggy register so to make my quest official.  From there, I hiked on in the rain to the shelter where I was happy to celebrate my 67th with new friends including Tom, a ridge runner, who works for the park and oversees that particular shelter. No cake or candles or even a fire but “Hey, I’m on the A.T.!”","Amicalola State Park Approach Trail

In the first two days out, I’ve experienced a microcosm of life on the Appalachian Trail. Much like the Camino, they say there are certain types/groups of people who hike the AT ~ young people, folks in transition, seniors and perpetual hikers.  Perpetual Hikers? I was told by a 2019 thru-hiker, “You’ll know them when you see them.”  It had been a sunny day but cold with night time temperatures expected in the low twenties not factoring In the roaring wind chill. Everyone anticipated wearing every item of clothing they had to keep warm.  In the late afternoon a youngish man with rakish hair wandered into camp wearing jeans, an oversize yellow hazmat jacket and no shoes. Turns out he has been homeless since 2007, living a hobo’s existence on the road, catching freight trains, picking up labor jobs across the country and finding purpose now on this hike of all hikes. He was an interesting man, a kind soul and his stories of walking across Texas barefoot amazed and saddened me.           I hope our paths cross again.","Springer Mountain Shelter

Took a wrong turn out of the shelter this morning and hiked along quite happily humming in the sunshine until I met up with “Banjo” who was trekking in the opposite direction.  He informed me he was headed northbound to the same site I anticipated staying at this evening. UGH!  I dare say he took pity and we hiked together all day striding through lovely rhododendron tunnels and enjoying some wonderful Trail Magic along with gallon jugs of fresh water left on the trail.  It’s so nice to be given clean water and not have to filter it.  So many kindnesses extended along the way.
Upon arriving at the shelter, a group of young women, one of whom had thru-hiked the AT, arrived with more Trail Magic!  Hot cider, chips, fresh fruit, toilet paper and an offer to take away our trash! My day may have begun with a wrong turn but it ended with so much bounty and good karma.
Tonight, almost everyone was lamenting,  “Why didn’t I bring ear plugs?”
It occasionally happens within crowded shelters and throughout entire campgrounds where a single individual disturbs the whole site.  I found myself in the shelter sandwiched between two masters. No sooner would one snore when the other would reply. They had perfect timing!  While the rest of us tossed and turned, these two fellow hikers played on. All mice, coyotes and bears stayed clear last night!","Hawk Mountain Shelter

I enjoy traveling by myself.  It’s not that I eschew fellow travelers because I cannot abide by them or haven’t good friends I could be with but rather I just prefer to go it alone most of the time.  
I love being totally free out in the world… getting a little lost, having to seek directions in a language I don’t know, trying to find my way and arriving safe and sound to a place I’ve never been.
Well, my attitude has changed...just like that!
Here on the AT, I have found that I prefer to have a buddy.  We need not maintain the same pace or keep up a running conversation.  It’s enough to know that there is a kindred spirit just ahead or just behind me.  It’s fun to have someone to share a well-earned view with, to take a lunch break on a log with or even to commiserate with especially when it’s been raining hard and the trail is a bit treacherous!
Beautiful shared views today from Ramrock Mountain, Preaching Rock and Big Cedar Mountain. We also lucked out with two Trail Magic offerings!  Got into camp with plenty of light, set up my tent by a lovely stream and enjoyed time with members of my tramily, JJ, Matt and Sarah (The Brits), Holly and Kentucky aka Daniel Boone.","Gooch Gap Shelter

A pleasant morning that all too soon was hijacked by dense fog with intermittent rain which is, to say, a normal day on the AT!  It’s not a hard cold icy rain but rain, nonetheless, so layers, zippered openings, gloves and headgear must be adjusted accordingly especially when the wind begins to blow.  It’s somethin’!  I hike with my raingear on most of the time in order to minimize the on/off again effort. So far it seems to be working.
The climb up Blood Mountain, the highest point in Georgia (elev. 4457’), was a nice ascent. It must be beautiful when the rhododendrons are in bloom. 
Atop its peak is a wonderful old stone shelter which was constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s.  Miraculously, the fog lifted and the rain stopped just in time to afford a magnificent view out over the Appalachians!  Coming down into Neel Gap was slow going.  The AT is quite arduous given the rainy conditions and the ever present roots, rocks and mud.  You must be vigilant.
The trail spits you out right at the front door of “Mountain Crossings” a wonderful outfitter which has everything a hiker might possibly need and then some...gear, food, clothing, coffee, candy, bunkhouse, bathrooms, etc.  There was a hiker’s box by the front door. In it were all sorts of things my fellow hikers no longer wanted - a free goody grab bag! I switched out my hat for another and found a cover for my cook cup.  Tramily members were there hanging out and catching up.  Many were beginning to talk about the coronavirus but we were all quick to agree that the AT was the best place to be. The level of concern was low.
My hiker buddy and I opted to book a cabin next door where the price was right and included a laundry service!  A warm room, a hot shower, clean clothes and a comfy bed plus wifi!  All the comforts of home.

We began our day back at the outfitters with a “shakedown” appointment. My hiking buddy was looking to lessen her load a bit and the Mountain Crossings staff were happy to oblige by sorting through her backpack item by item. She left a couple pounds lighter and the Hiker Box gained some new castoffs.
Another slow and mindful day as the rain continued.  I am not complaining about the pace as I welcome the chance to stop and rest my feet as I wait!  I tilt my toes uphill and let gravity do its work, if only for a few moments, to relieve the pressure of hiking with a 30 pound pack.
When will my trail legs kick in?
At day's end, we camped by a stream in Hogpen Gap and ate dinner. One more chore awaited us...hanging our bear bags.  On the trail, there are three ways to secure your food bag which includes scented items (ie.toothpaste/deodorant) and any trash you’re packing out. Shelters often provide a latched bear box or bear cables which enable you to hoist your bag high above the ground for safe keeping.  As we were stealth camping, neither of these options were available hence the need to manually hang our bear bags from an appropriate tree. We staggered through the woods, about 100 feet from camp, to select a good tree. Easier said than done! As night loomed, picture two 67 year old women trying to throw a rope (secured to a small sack with a rock in it) over a lofty limb some 20 feet high!  We threw our lines again and again, falling down in the leaves laughing until at last success! Holy Moly Good Night!!","Neel Gap/Blood Mountain Cabins

A beautiful sunny day!  I expect the inclement weather will eventually lessen a bit as Spring turns into Summer.  I know I will miss this season’s cooler temperatures though with the misty rain and creeping fog.
A gradual climb up through a number of gaps today (Low, Cold Springs, Chattahoochee and Red Clay).  These passes are pleasant to hike as they traverse the ridgelines between mountains often dipping down to a road (paved or dirt) where, if you’re lucky, Trail Magic might show up!  But not today.
We arrived at Low Gap Shelter where we stopped for lunch.  Other tramily members had gathered there to soak their feet in the stream and relax a bit over a bite to eat.  I was soon ready to go on but my buddy was tired and decided to stay put. That’s how it is.  I said my goodbyes, with a promise to stay in touch, and hiked on alone into the brilliant day.
I made it to Blue Mountain Shelter where I pitched my tent and gathered with a friendly group for dinner followed by a lovely fire.  Shortly thereafter, it began to rain, sending all of us helter skelter to our shelters. I settled into my solo sanctuary and contemplated the next day’s adventure. Nearly everyone was headed off trail to Hiawassee, the first major trail town, for rest and resupply but I decided to move on.","Hogpen Gap

Headed out into fog which persisted all day and masked all views.  This is not a bad thing as the woods and the trail when wrapped up with fog are beautiful.  It’s easy to feel like an interloper until I think of my Trail name and the community I am a part of.  I reach out to touch white blazed trees in passing. Silently, I thank the trees and ask that I might be imbued with some of their strength and grace so to continue on successfully.  I paused along the trail to rest my feet even though there was no one to wait for.
Midday, I met up with a young ranger who warned me of severe weather expected on Tray Mountain.  She suggested using campsites on either side of the summit including one called The Cheese Factory.  She was gone before I thought to ask about the history behind the name.
I hiked on alone with the goal of actually reaching the shelter.  It had rained on and off all day, my tent was wet and, with no chance to dry it out, I was anxious to secure a spot inside.
Upon reaching the turn off, I noticed another hiker just ahead of me.  He/she had stopped and was attending to something I couldn’t see. I hustled my bustle to overtake them.  As I scurried past, I looked up into the face of a former running buddy from Florida!
I knew he was on the trail, had even anticipated running into him and now here we were.  Well, I slowed down and we went on together.  Upon arrival, my friend set up his tent and I was happy to unpack inside with room to spare.
Later that evening, “Darwin”, a popular YouTube hiker host, showed up.  We all squeezed together to fit him in. Darwin and his wife had thru-hiked the AT in 2015 and he had returned to section hike a favorite portion.  Despite his online “celebrity” status, he came across as a nice fellow, unassuming, willing to answer our questions and listen to our tales before settling down for what proved to be, a very windy night!","Blue Mountain Shelter

Being on the Appalachian Trail shares certain elements with being retired - like not always knowing what day it is. Friday the 13th is simply another day with another mountain (or two) to climb.  I’ve been on the trail one week...just beginning!
I hiked with my friend, “Danja”, pronounced as a New Englander might day “Danger”, up, over and along a few gaps ~ Wolfpen, Steeltrap, Sassafras and Adis.  I am sure there is someone out there who could speak to the historical origins of these interesting names!
It is  nice hiking with someone.  I much prefer it. Our paces are different but that’s alright.  The trail skirted the summit of Kelly Knob and led us to a great campsite with mountain views and a cell signal!  We made calls, set up tents, filtered water and then enjoyed a hot lasagna dinner with cocoa and a blueberry pop tart for dessert… fancy!","Tray Mountain Shelter

Everything about backpacking speaks to efficiency/organization.  You must maintain your pack, mind your equipment, monitor and prepare your food, filter your water, pack out your trash and watch over your stuff.  Every task that needs to be done can be broken down into steps. The quicker you get at completing those steps, the more time you have to enjoy your dinner, to sit by a fire, to hang out and to have a little down time.
Hiking the AT is work, people!   It’s challenging and the ups and downs go on for, well, 2201.8 miles!
Finishing up your chores so that you can have a bit of free time before going to bed is important because the morning comes bright and early with its own set of tasks.  Packing and unpacking as efficiently as possible goes a long way to making the hike more manageable...more enjoyable.
And I’ll tell you, when you swing that pack on your back and head out, you’re smart to know where every single item is so as not to leave anything behind because you’re not coming back.","Vista View Campsite

I must back up first and report on yesterday as it was the BEST!  All day it had been cloudy with off/on rain per the usual. Coming down through Dick’s Creek Gap, we came upon the most incredible Trail Magic!  It was hosted by a bunch of former thru hikers who had set up two pavilions, a hot coffee bar, plenty of chairs and tables chock full of all kinds of food, first aid items, tp and other necessities.  I had a BLT on wholewheat with avocado which was to die for, hot creamy coffee and a favorite ~ chewy oatmeal cookies. It’s indescribable how wonderful it is to encounter Trail Magic...to be the recipient of so much unexpected tasty generosity!
I also want to give a shout out for Plum Orchard Shelter...last night’s refuge.  This place was the best of its kind so far.  Built in collaboration with the Air National Guard and the Army Rangers from Camp Merrill, it is a large three decker structure able to accommodate 14 hikers with a nice protected table for gathering.  This was ideal because “Stump Jumper” hoofed a 5 liter box of wine up the trail yesterday and we all enjoyed some with dinner.
Ok, back to today!  Another foggy one with intermittent rain. The trail on days like this is slow going.  I was excited because I expected to cross my first state line from Georgia into North Carolina.  We were hiking along an easy section which is always welcomed.  Three members of my tramily had passed me and I was sure they, too, were in a hurry to cross the state line.  My buddy and I moved along at a slower pace.  Up ahead someone shouted “Tree” and I looked up to see my young friends gathered by the side of the trail.  There it was, a simple wooden sign nailed into a tree with GA/NC carved on it.  I took a moment.  One down!","Plum Orchard Shelter

Highs and lows. Ups and downs. The best the worst.  Last night, everyone agreed that, sadly, the first shelter in the beautiful state of North Carolina, did not have much to recommend it.  As I strung clothes out to dry over nearby bushes, I tiptoed through the mud and puddles all around, ate quickly on a meager counter and retired early.  I will say there was a dear little dachshund who shared my space and made me smile.  Dogs on the trail are a plus!
No rain, no pain, no Maine!  After hiking by patches of mountain laurels and through beautiful rhododendron tunnels in the mist, rain and fog, we made it to Beech Gap Campsite.  At a certain elevation, naked oaks and spindly pines make room for laurels and rhodies. No blooms yet but the dark green shiny leaves make for a nice change.  
In certain parts of Scotland (Mull of Kintyre) rhododendrons are considered an invasive species meant to be cut down, rooted out and burned!  Believe me as I spent a full day doing just that. I’ve never looked at a rhododendron in quite the same way since. But here in the States they are very popular.
My tent tonight is set under a mature canopy of ( you guessed it ) rhododendrons...a sanctuary I much appreciate!","Muskrat Shelter

Hiked in the rain all day.  It may sound miserable all this stomping around in the wet but, quite honestly, I do not mind it.  The wind rarely picks up to where it chills, the temperatures are relatively mild (40’s/50’s) and it is not always a constant downpour.  It is just that, in the rain, my head is down for the most part and I must exercise great caution all the time, especially on the descent. The sun finally came out in midafternoon. YAY!  We decided to stop, set up camp and give our gear a chance to dry out.  
While sorting through my things, two young hikers passed by with dire warnings of trail towns closing down and services beginning to be disrupted. I have yet to get off of the trail but shall be going into Franklin, NC soon for a resupply/zero day. There has been some talk about the spreading corona virus and the dilemma it may pose for everyone on the trail.  Most seem confident we will weather the storm and feel that being up on the A.T. is the safest place to be right now.

Up, out and over Albert Mountain at 5250’.  A rather hard climb for a rather short person with some steep rocky parts and the regular riot of roots. Thank goodness for hiking poles. Rainy and foggy with a bit of good weather at the top.  A fire tower afforded, for those willing to climb a few more steps, a lovely view over the Coweeta Basin.  This region is home to one of the oldest environmental studies in North America which involves forests with different climates.  It is studied by scientists from all around the world. Interestingly, there are many students hiking the trail who have science related majors - forestry, agriculture, technology, geology. I hiked one day, early on, with just such a student who studied seeds… plum seeds, believe.
Just beyond the tower, I came upon the first mileage marker ~ 100.  I know it is just a number but in my heart it is much more... so many friends and family on my shoulder.
At home, I live alone, a little off the grid ~ no TV, wifi computer or facebook.  I do, however, have a smartphone and, in the course of preparing for this adventure, I tuned in to many YouTube videos!  All the shows had followings and I had my favorites. One program documented a family who hiked the A.T. in 2018 with six children, the youngest of whom was two!  Hiking down from Albert Mountain to Rock Gap, the “Fight for Together” family awaited us with corn dogs, beer, salad, blueberry fritters, toilet paper, water and more. A M A Z I N G! ZING!!
Hiker hunger, a phenomenon where a hiker can consume an insurmountable amount of food in a single sitting overtook me. I think I ate enough for four!  
Two members of Danja’s tramily, a mother and daughter, offered us a ride into Franklin which we graciously accepted.  After a hot shower, pizza, a Coke Cola and some TV, I was ready for bed.","Betty Creek Gap Tent Site

Where are my entries? Well, I transitioned to a paper journal almost immediately upon starting my hike as the unpredictability of time and connectivity is a reality along the AT. 
I am sorry, as I love the digital format.  I do not want to take many nero/short days in trail towns, however, in order to update an online journal.

NOTE:  Please know that due to the CV, the Appalachian Trail Conservancy is advocating all hikers get off of the trail. 
I shall make my decision soon.
I am presently in Franklin, NC having passed the 100 mile mark which transpired along a lovely corridor of rhododendrons just south of the Albert Mountain fire tower.  I want to hike to Fontana Dam which serves as the southern entrance to the great Smoky Mountains National Park. My concern is that all rangers and ridge runners have been pulled from the park which is a safety line I am reluctant to cross given the elevations and potentially severe weather conditions up there.  Trail towns are closing down with limited services and dwindling supplies.
My initial effort may, by surreal necessity, become a section hike.  Whatever happens, I look forward to speaking to the Ladies Auxiliary of Cape Cod Hospital upon my return home and sharing stories with my friends and family. I have learned so much already and am so thankful for the trail and the beautiful community of trees.
As I suspected, I love the green tunnel and shall return, if need be, to hike another day.
Happy Trails,

A “0” day.  No hiking. A day to sleep in, take a shower, do laundry, go food shopping, purchase needed items, make calls and catch up on current events.
Well things have changed.
Due to covid-19, virtually all stores are closed in Franklin.  The hotel no longer offers breakfast but a spot next door served up eggsn’bacon, buttered raisin bread toast and coffee at a picnic table set up in their parking lot.   I was able to purchase a few items at a nearby outfitter and catch the town shuttle to a local laundromat and grocery store where a few familiar faces gathered.  My tramily is getting smaller as they slowly opt to leave the trail. The coronavirus is becoming a pandemic.  
I am beginning to doubt the possibility of continuing.  Making it to the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC) seems risky now never mind making it to Fontana Dam.  Cracking open a fortune cookie after dinner, I had to smile.","Franklin

A sunny start!  The driver brought a van full of hikers back out to Rock Gap this morning.  The thing about a gap is that there is usually an immediate ascent out of it to an upper ridge line or mountain top.  Clouds moved in quickly and a steady rain followed us the rest of the day. I had been wearing a support sleeve on my right knee for a couple of days before Franklin and had previously given the other to my hiking buddy.  He had purchased his own braces in town so we were good to go.  Old joints can use help in these hills!  A very dear friend of mine, age 101, often had great difficulty getting around. She was not a candidate for new knees and had to manage as best she could. She rarely complained. I think of her on descents.
Upon arrival at Siler Bald Shelter, we met up with a fellow who is an avid hunter.  He had been napping but quickly came around and regaled us with interesting pictures and stories about his family and accomplishments.  Later, others joined us, including one, just one, of my tramily.
It’s official.  The Appalachian Trail Conservancy has asked all prospective hikers to postpone their trek and all current hikers to come off of the trail as soon as they can.  Seems this request was actually posted three days ago. The rumors were true.  The best spot with connections out is the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC).
 So be it.","Rock Gap

A brilliant sunny day and only 6.8 miles to go.  Although it was virtually all uphill I did not complain.  The sun felt so good and the views were spectacular!  
I am still hiking with a former running buddy of mine.  We’re not moving as quickly as perhaps we had anticipated but priorities change especially when inclement weather factors in.  I intend to savor my time left on the trail. Who could have foreseen the pandemic!
We made it to Wayah Bald (el. 5342’) where there was a great stone tower with majestic views of the Appalachians.  The summit was accessible by car and a fair number of tourists were milling about. The name Wayah comes from the Cherokee word wa’ya, meaning wolf.  Back into the woods for about a mile and there was the shelter. No familiar faces. One young woman confessed to being essentially homeless. She had been on her own for four years and had recently come back on the trail having worked-to-stay at a place in town.  I was curious about her but she kept to herself refusing the shelter for her tarp which she draped over a railing. I wondered if she would try to stay on the trail, where she would go.","Siler Bald Shelter

Got going a little bit later than usual but it is a short day and we were still ahead of a few stragglers.  I am impressed by how quickly most hikers break camp and get hiking. One moment a hiker’s tent or hammock is up and their pack in disarray and the next moment they are gone...just like that.
It was a decent day, if overcast, as we made our way down through Licklog Gap, up and over a few puds (pointless ups and downs - new vocab) and on to Burningtown Gap.  We noticed a “weed kit” neatly left in plain view by a tree on the trail. Neither of us felt compelled to pick it up. I imagined someone would be thrilled to find it. Well, here they come!  In short order, the young woman from last night and a wiry fellow with a knife in his boot came busting down the trail from the opposite direction hightailing it for the kit. We let them pass and continued on feeling a little uncomfortable and wondering if they were going to be staying in the shelter ahead.  They passed us again, grass in hand, and later on we did meet up with them. There was a second fellow at the shelter who completed their trio. He was a hefty man who reminded me of J.K. Rowling’s Hagrid, except with dreadlocks and a cape. They eventually moved on and we settled in. It began to get chilly so we made a valiant attempt to make a fire but to no avail.  A couple of hikers passed through and then a young couple stopped, set up their tent, proceeded, in short order, to make an awesome fire and joined us for dinner.","Wayah Bald Shelter

BOOM!  Tremendous thunder storms last night.  I have never been so exposed to the elements but the shelters on the A.T. are sturdy buildings and we were able to stay safe and dry.
This morning, we set off in a light rain and fog with plans to hike to the next shelter.  I was up for hiking a longer day so we could get into the NOC sooner but my friend was in no rush and I had to agree.  Why hurry?  Two more days and it is over.  So sad.
We made good time and arrived early only to find the menacing trio firmly in place with no plans to move.  A red flag.  I told my friend that I would set my tent up in the pouring rain somewhere rather than stay there.  He was happy to push on as we had heard the county was holding a meeting this very night to decide if the General Store at the Nantahala Outdoor Center should remain open in light of the virus threat.  Tonight might be their last and I had a package to pick up!
Parts of the descent into the NOC were treacherous as it was so rocky, wet and steep. We were negotiating one tricky stretch when it happened.  We both slipped and fell down. Undeterred and uninjured, we carried on and miraculously got into the NOC General Store five minutes before it closed.  The clerk fetched my parcel, waited for us to select a few snacks and handed over a list of shuttle drivers still willing to pick up hikers and drive them into town. We successfully arranged a ride and accommodations in Bryson City at an inn which was closing down the next day.  It was like I was just ahead of a line of falling dominos.
Arrangements were made for the following morning for a ride into Sylva to secure a rental car.  The plan was for my friend, my hiking partner, my running buddy to rent a car to drive home to Florida. He would drop me off on the way at a spot in Asheville where good friends I knew from Orlando would pick me up.
I am blessed.  My friends offered a wonderful respite for two days and then it was time to go. I rented a car for a solitary drive back to my home, my mouse house on Cape Cod. As I drove north, the Appalachian Mountains were just over my shoulder.  I could see them. I shall return to the Appalachian Trail, the white blazes, a new tramily and the community of trees. xoxo Tree","Cold Spring Shelter

I shall also keep a pen and paper journal moving forward as it is too difficult for me to maintain this online presence. I am finally prepared to acknowledge this may be a section hike as a precious baby’s arrival is imminent and I might have to leave the trail so to hold my first grandchild!
