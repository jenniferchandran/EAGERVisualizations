Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637547,"Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.  
So said Albert Einstein, except that he really didn’t.  More likely the phrase has its roots in 12-step programs.  It was first cited in an October 1981 newspaper article describing a meeting of Al-Anon and in a November 1981 publication of Narcotics Anonymous.  Either way, it’s been on my mind lately as I prepare for my third attempt to thru-hike the Appalachian Trail.
My first attempt in 2013 ended in failure in North Carolina at the Nantahala River, about 135 miles from the southern terminus on Springer Mountain in Georgia.  The nearly 3,000’ descent from Wesser Bald was the final insult to my knees, and I was fairly crippled, flying home from Asheville to Sarasota, Florida the next day.  
I was first diagnosed with patello-femoral osteoarthritis in both knees, while hiking Virginia in 1997, at a medical clinic in Bland, Virginia.  Large doses of prednisone, industrial-strength naproxen, and codeine at night enabled me to complete my hike.  I consulted an orthopedic surgeon, who took one look at the x-rays and, without even examining my knees, confirmed the diagnosis, cheerfully adding, “Progressive.  Degenerative.  You will eventually need knee replacements.”  I was advised to quit running and to save my knees for hiking.  The episodes became more frequent and more severe, and in 2010, I had arthroscopic surgery on both knees to release the patellae, which were locked in place and frozen.  It is a controversial procedure, but the risks were minimal.  It worked great and I was even able to take up running again.  That’s what gave me the hope that I could attempt to thru-hike in 2013.
After I returned home in shame from that attempt, I consulted another orthopedic surgeon, one with better bedside manner, who recommend knee replacements, but first he had to attend an international conference.  He returned convinced that he would be viewed as a barbarian for having done replacement surgery, that stem cell regenerative therapy would be the standard treatment within five years.  He wanted to hold me together until then with cortisone injections and custom full-offloading braces.  The cortisone did very little, but the lidocaine mixed in with it gave me about three days of pain relief.  The braces worked, sort of, but were uncomfortable and awkward.  Stem cell therapy with a standard protocol and proven efficacy, like the old Soviet five-year plans, remains a rolling target.  
We moved to Burlington, Vermont in 2016.  By then the braces had become ineffective.  I consulted the orthopedic practice at the University of Vermont.  They referred me to physical therapy for the first time, and the improvement was remarkable.  I had good hikes in 2016 and 2017, and was confident I could try a thru-hike again.
I started in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia at the Flip-Flop Festival in April 2018 and hiked from the Potomac River to the Hudson River without much difficulty.  I returned home for a few days (Amtrak makes that very convenient).  When I started again from Bear Mountain, New York, I was hurting just walking across the bridge over the Hudson, and the 500’ climb to the ridge crossed the moderate pain threshold.  The pain only increased the next day on easy trail.  I returned home after 412 miles and started physical therapy again.  It didn’t work.  The nurse practitioner at UVM said that the x-rays didn’t show enough damage to justify knee replacements and suggested moderating my activity.  I asked to see an orthopedic surgeon and was told it would be three months.  At that point, walking more than 50’ was painful.  I contacted Mansfield Orthopedics in Morrisville, Vermont, and couldn’t have had a more different experience.  I received my first knee replacement in February 2019 and the second knee eight months later.  Rehabilitation is hard work!
I tried thru-hiking the Northville Lake Placid Trail in the Adirondacks eight months after my second knee, joining my favorite trail companions from 2018, my cousin Debbie and Willow.  It was premature, and I again returned to the physical therapist.  He had some excellent suggestions, particularly doing interval training on a treadmill and adding incline.  He speaks of building “tissue tolerance.”  I can now walk at least 10 miles at a pace of 3.5 to 4 mph, without discomfort. Occasionally, one or the other of my knees will complain, but not very stridently.  All of the “What to Expect After Your Knee Replacement” guides suggest that full rehabilitation takes 12 - 18 months.  I found that’s true for regular activities, but returning to more intense activity takes longer.  My older knee at 27 months is raring to go, but my newer knee at 19 months is still improving, but even it feels vastly better than even years ago.
I had hoped to start another Flip-Flop Thru-Hike attempt last month, but the Appalachian Trail Conservancy was still actively discouraging long-distance hiking that involved going into towns for resupply because of the Covid-19 pandemic. In March 2020, ATC suspended its 2000-miler recognition program, stopped handing out thru-hiker backpack hangtags, and closed its visitor centers.  ATC was following the best scientific guidance, particularly from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  It wasn’t only ATC.  The U.S. Forest Service closed all of the AT shelters and privies in the National Forests. The Appalachian National Scenic Trail Park Office (NPS-APPA) closed the shelters on its lands. Some states like Massachusetts banned overnight camping altogether, and other states such as Vermont had testing and quarantine requirements that would apply to hikers coming in from out-of-state.  Nonetheless, ATC bore the brunt of vehement criticism from many hikers. 
The Appalachian Trail was never “closed” in a physical sense.  How do you close a trail with over 500 road crossings?  Hundreds, quite probably more than 1,000, thru-hikers started in Georgia this year, flouting the USFS, APPA and state rules, loudly blaming ATC for caving in to political correctness and cancel culture and daring to change its advice as scientific knowledge accumulated.  A cottage industry in counterfeit AT hangtags started. 
I thought about going ahead and starting my hike anyway, but the more I thought about why ATC and the federal and state agencies were taking their positions, the more I found that I agreed with them.  Part of it is living in Vermont.  Early on, our state committed to following the science and bringing transparency to the decision process.  Our governor and agency heads hold broadcast Covid press briefings twice weekly.  Vermont is a very small state.  Only Wyoming has fewer people.  There’s a sense that everyone is a neighbor.  It’s a bright blue state where a Republican governor garners greater support from Democratic voters than from Republican voters.  Widespread Covid testing, effective contact tracing, widely followed masking and social distancing protocols, and now vaccinations have made Vermont a national leader by most measures.  It’s often said that Vermonters have been following social distancing since 1791, when Vermont became the 14th state after 14 years as an independent republic.  I started to feel strongly that doing the right thing was more important than when I would get to do a thru-hike.  I decided on a very simple determinant for whether or not I would start my thru-hike.  I wouldn’t do it unless ATC were handing out AT 2021 backpack hangtags.  That took the decision was out of my hands.  
On May 11, ATC announced that it would start distributing AT 2021 backpack hangtags at its headquarters and reopened visitor center on May 27.  The next day, I registered my thru-hike at ATCamp on ATC’s website and made reservations for AmTrak for August 17 and lodging in Harpers Ferry for that night.  The hike is on!  My plan is to start hiking south from Harpers Ferry on August 18, reaching Springer Mountain in Georgia in early November.  I will return to Harpers Ferry in April 2022 and hike north, summiting Katahdin before August 18.  I will complete the entire trail within a twelve-month period, ATC’s definition of a thru-hike.  I am delighted that my cousin Debbie, who earned her trail name Rocky Raccoon in 2018, will be joining me from Harpers Ferry through Shenandoah National Park.  
I started this entry with a definition of insanity, repeating the same thing multiple times, expecting different results.  I’ll end with an even older proverb:
Third time’s a charm!",,View Entry,"May 16, Sun",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637609,"When I registered my hike on ATC’s website, it invited me to enter a reason why I wanted to thru-hike. I thought about it for a second and entered a single word, “Stubbornness.”  As I explained in my first entry, this will be my third attempt at thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail.  It will be my umpteenth long-distance hike on the AT.  My first was in 1994, and it was an annual tradition until 2019 and 2020.  Especially after this past year of Covid isolation, I am delighted to be returning to it.  Maybe “habit” would have been a better word.
When I started hiking the AT, I was a tax partner in a local CPA firm in Sarasota, Florida that I had helped found.  Even with perfect partners and staff and only outstanding clients, it was still stressful.  I would keep a hiking schedule and flight reservations in my upper right desk drawer as a survival mechanism during tax season.  Hiking the Appalachian Trail restored me to myself.  It took me eight years and ten hikes to complete the trail in 2001.  I’ve hiked other trails since then including the Long Trail, the Benton MacKaye Trail, and the Duncan Ridge Trail, but I keep returning to the AT.  It is my trail.  
I became involved with the Appalachian Trail Conference, since rebranded as the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, in 1997 as the first board member from a non-trail state, and served 14 years, mostly as treasurer.  ATC is headquartered in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia.  Between meetings and hikes, I figure I’ve been there close to 50 times.  So I’m delighted to be starting my thru-hike there.  One reason that I’ve decided to start hiking on a Wednesday, is that I want breakfast at the Country Café in Bolivar, which adjoins Harpers Ferry.  They are closed Mondays and Tuesdays.  As you get to know me, you will learn that food is one of my primary motivators.  I’ll eat simple foods on the trail, but in towns I want more than All You Can Eat (AYCE). 
There are as many reasons to thru-hike as there are thru-hikers.  Among the more common are finding oneself, finding God, and figuring out what to do with the rest of one’s life.  If by age 70, I haven’t figured these things out or at least stopped looking for answers, something would be dreadfully wrong with me.  Going on a quest, adventure, or rite of passage are other common reasons.  They don’t apply to me either.  My next rite of passage will be rather permanent and I would just as soon postpone that for a few decades.  A quest in the sense of Don Quixote appeals to me, but I am not addled enough quite yet.  I’m not embarking on a hero’s journey — being called to adventure, initiated with trials, and returning the same only different.  I don’t have a magic ring or a friend who just happens to be a great wizard.
I’m hiking because I can, or at least because I think that I can, and that’s more profound than you realize.  I was the kid who was never chosen or chosen last for every team, who never learned to throw a ball and never learned the rules of the game, any game.  I was the class spaz, the class sissy, the one who took any excuse to avoid exercise.  I preferred to read or to listen to classical music.  You’ve all known kids like that.  If you were that kid, I’m sorry, but you’ve already learned what I have — that things get better!  That doesn’t mean that I’ve learned how to throw a ball, or hang a bear bag, or that I enjoy groups of people.  But I have found others who enjoy what I enjoy and have come to realize that the ones who seemed normal in every respect were just as queer as I am, just in their own way.  
How’s that for a segue?  The hardest part of thru-hiking for me is being away from home.  Tom and I have been together for 44 years, legally married for the last 6.  He supports me in my hiking, but still, I feel like I’m running away.  The love of a good man.  It sounds like a bad country song.",,View Entry,"May 21, Fri",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637684,"There’s a button to the left where you can explore the gear that I’ll be carrying.  I left off a few things, like a 7” section of 3/4” PVC pipe.  You may not need it, but I do.  I use it as stick roller to massage my leg muscles and the tendons surrounding my knees.  It helps me considerably.  The lightest stick roller I could find weighs 9 ounces.  The PVC pipe weighs 1.3 ounces and works better.  Note the little hole I drilled at one end so I can clip it to my pack with a small carabiner.  Things have a way of escaping from the side pockets of packs.  With a little duct tape, the PVC pipe could splint a broken hiking stick.  It could also pipe a spring, making it easier to collect water.   The total weight of my pack except for consumables is just shy of 15 pounds.  Considering several luxury items that I’m bringing such as camp shoes (7.2 ounces for the pair), a camp seat (1.1 ounces) and a knit baby raccoon (0.7 ounces) and that I carry a bear canister (33.6 ounces), this is reasonably light.  My leaving town weight with water, food, toilet paper, and all the other consumables is under 25 pounds.  With the superior suspension of the ULA Circuit backpack, this carries well and isn’t a problem.  I’ve gone lighter and it hasn’t mattered.  Heavier than 30 - 35 pounds total pack weight, and I start to complain.  Even then, I just need to remember the good old days, when 40 - 45 pounds was the norm, or my starting pack weight in 1994 of 58 pounds.  Ooph!
Each time I leave for a hike, I am convinced that I have the optimal gear.  And each time, I find things that don’t work, or I see something that I like better, or find things that have worn out.  I’ll highlight a few of the items that are new for this hike.
I’ve replaced by ULA-Equipment Circuit backpack with a waterproof model.  I have never found pack covers to be wholly successful.  Rain always gets between the pack and my back, ponding in the bottom of the pack cover like a diaper in need of changing.  In spite of my confidence in ULA-Equipment, everything in my pack will be in roll-top dry bags.  
The Zpacks Solplex tent served me well in 2018.  When I abandoned my hike, I offered it to Willow.  It was lighter and more weather resistant than the tent she had been using.  I’ve replaced it with the Zpacks Pleximid.  It’s slightly larger, sets with only one hiking pole, and allows me to have my pack next to me instead of at my feet.  
The MSR Pocket Rocket stove that I used in 2018 wore out.  I’ve replaced it with a Soto Windmaster that offers greater wind resistance and a built-in piezo-electric ignitor that actually seems to work.  I’ll carry a Mini-Bic lighter as insurance.  I’ve also upgraded my cookset stuff sack to a Gossamer Gear pot cozy that weighs 0.7 ounces and should reduce my fuel consumption.  I’ve tried going stoveless several times.  What I saved in weight, I lost in boring meals and grumpiness.   
Montbell earned my loyalty when they surprised me by replacing my Plasma 1000 down jacket under their lifetime warranty.  The zipper had worn out from normal wear and tear and I sent it to them for repair, fully expecting to pay.  Instead, they replaced the jacket free of charge. I’ve since purchased their Versalite rain jacket and pants, Cool Hoody, CoolLite t-shirt, and headband.  They have earned most-favored vendor status by both their customer service and the quality of their gear.   
The rain gear is a good example of gear not mattering until you need it, like a first aid kit.  When Rocky Raccoon, Willow and I hiked the Northville Lake Placid Trail in the Adirondacks last year (only Rocky Raccoon completed the hike), we had a cold rainy day.  That’s when I discovered that my ZPacks Challenger rain jacket and pants that used a proprietary membrane had failed.  The water resistance was gone, and I spent the day cold, wet, and unhappy.  On a warm day, rain can be pleasant, but consecutive days of cold rain are trying.  My personal best is 18 consecutive days of cold rain in Pennsylvania in 1998.  I’ve tried ponchos, The Packa (a combination pack cover and rain jacket), a large zippered conical “rice” hat made from foam covered with Dyneema Composite Fabric that is like wearing an umbrella and is also a camp sitting pad, and various jackets and pants ranging from inexpensive Frogg Toggs to the Montbell rain suit I now have.  With the right gear, hiking in the rain can be very pleasant.  
On my 2018 thru-hike attempt, I was envied Willow her Sea-to-Summit Ultra-Sil Dry Day Pack.  She used it both as a waterproof stuff sack in her pack, for slack packing, and also as a town and travel pack.  I purchased one and have used it often when I walk down to the Y on a rainy morning.  It weighs 3.2 ounces and fits nicely alongside the bear canister in my pack, holding all of the little things that like to lose themselves, like my headlamp, first aid kid, repair kit, and electronics bag.  The Montbell rain pants will double as my travel pants, but they lack pockets.  The day pack will be perfect on AmTrak, serving as the butch equivalent of a pocketbook.  
I am obsessive about gear.  I am a gram weenie.  There’s always something better that I should have gotten.  But once I set out from the trailhead, it doesn’t matter.  At least not until I reach the first outfitter.",,View Entry,"May 23, Sun",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637839,"I’ve been accused of enjoying the preparation for a hike more than the hike itself. There’s an element of truth to it, but I wouldn’t enjoy the preparation if it were not followed by an actual hike.  
You can hike the Appalachian Trail without any planning at all.  I don’t recommend it, but I’ve seen hikers starting at Amicalola Fall State Park in Georgia completely clueless with packs that are missing basic equipment. There are shelters along the trail so I don’t need to bring a tent, right?  The South is warm so I don’t need a sleeping bag or quilt.  I’ll just get wet if it rains, like the animals.  No need to carry food; I’ve read Euell Gibbons and can forage, hunt, and fish for what I need.  No need to carry water; it’s everywhere.  I’ve seen the opposite extreme, hikers starting with packs weighing in excess of 80 pounds, with 42 ounce canisters of Quaker Oats, cast iron skillets, hatchets and axes, hand-held weather stations, marshmallow toasters, and dress clothes for special occasions like dining at the captain’s table.  Ask members of the Georgia Appalachian Trail Club about the discarded gear they haul out each year!  I have seen huge survival knifes and Multi-Tools.  The pictured Victorinox Swiss Champ XAVT has 83 functions including a digital watch, altimeter, thermometer, ruler, LED light, various screwdrivers, a fish scaler, and more, much more, in addition to two possibly useful knife blades.  It weighs only 12.4 ounces and can be yours at www.swissarmy.com for only $429.99!  If it also included an umbrella, I might be tempted.  
When I started at Amicalola Falls Start Park in 1994 on my first solo hike, my pack weighed 58 pounds at a time when I weighed 153.  A pair of binoculars would let me distinguish between an innocent tree stump and a bear disguised as one.  A kit to turn my hiking pad into a cushy camp chair seemed rational at the time.  A dozen pemmican bars, each weighing about 6 ounces, would stave off starvation if I ran out of food.  There were trail guides and nature books.  There was a mini-ceramic filter that required superhuman effort to produce the merest trickle of clean water.  I thought that The North Face Tadpole was an ultralight tent at 4-1/2 pounds, plus the required groundcloth.  The Gregory Robson backpack, empty, weighed 8 pounds.  The times then were different.  There was no sylnylon or Dynema Composite Fabric.  When I got to the outfitter at Neels Gap four grueling days later, I trashed the pemmican after having nibbled one bar and mailed home 15 pounds of gear that just a few days earlier I would have sworn was essential.  I had read Colin Fletcher’s The Complete Walker and thought it was The Bible.  It was still five years before Ray Jardine published Beyond Backpacking, kicking off the movement toward much lighter weight gear. 
I have learned a few things since then.  I now keep a gear spreadsheet with each item weighed to the nearest tenth ounce.  I use it as a checklist when packing for a hike, so I don’t forget something like the charging cable for my iPhone (done that and had to replace it in Grand Central Station at a dear price).  When I return home from a hike and clean my gear for storage, I first weigh my favorite snack, usually a Little Debbie Oatmeal Creme Pie at 1.35 ounces, and compare that to each item in my pack, asking which I would rather have.  A typical Swiss Army Hiker Knife at 3.2 ounces or a single, very sharp, 1-3/4” inch CRKT knife at 0.9 ounces and an extra Little Debbie? If the gear is essential, like some sort of first aid kit, do I really need more than a few bandages, a tick key, a nail clipper, anti-bacterial ointment, and a couple tablets of Benadryl?  How many Little Debbies was the mobile field hospital I started with?  
Some means of navigation is essential for me.  Some would say that it’s optional on the Appalachian Trail, since you just have to follow the 2” X 6” painted white blazes adorning tree trunks and occasionally boulders.  That’s fine until you realize that you haven’t seen a blaze in some time.  Or you don’t know if you are hiking trail north or south.  I no longer carry paper maps but I still carry a small compass so I can be lost linearly instead of wandering aimlessly in a circle until I meet a tree stump that isn’t.  I have downloaded an app to my iPhone, Guthook Guides.  It works offline, using the GPS function of my phone, with minimal battery drain, and includes information about town services with user comments. Don’t be put off by the name “Guthook.”  It is the trail name of a very fine gentleman, Ryan Linn, who founded the company.  I also have the PDF version of The Thru-Hiker’s Companion on my phone.  I suggested to Rocky Raccoon that she purchase Guthook for Northern Virginia so she wouldn’t be dependent on me.  The cost is $7.99.  Alternately, she could purchase paper maps from ATC for $59.75 for the required five maps that collectively weigh more than several Little Debbies.  
I hadn’t thought about it, but “Plan ahead and prepare,” is the first principle of Leave No Trace. In my 2018 trail journal, I used my pre-hike entries to address the 20 common questions hikers are asked, like what do you eat, where do you sleep, and the ever popular aren’t-you-afraid-of series. As a way to organize my thoughts and to pass the 84 days until I leave for the trail, I’ll try a series of pre-hike entries organized around the seven LNT principles.  I’ll try not to write boring or scolding essays or lists of do’s and don’t’s but instead offer illustrations of what I actually do and share stupid things that I have done. I’ll continue with planning in my next entry.",,View Entry,"May 24, Mon",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637917,"Listen to your ass.  
The most common trait associated with donkeys is stubbornness, which if you recall, was my instinctive reason for wanting to thru-hike the Appalachian Trail this year.  For real donkeys, this is apparently a misunderstanding of a donkey’s stoic nature, subtle body language, a tendency to freeze when threatened or frightened, and a strong sense of self-preservation.  “You want me to do what?” a donkey is apt to ask in response to your desire that they do anything.  Only you can’t understand a thing they say.  “What’s in it for me?” they will add.  Horses run at the least provocation.  Donkeys plant their feet and refuse to move, until they’ve had time to study on it or until a carrot or an apple is proffered.
Donkeys were domesticated at least 5,000 years ago from the African ass, long enough to have had a major supporting role in the Bible.  They were fortunate to be considered unclean, because they do not chew their cud (Leviticus 11:26), and so escaped being eaten.  They were not to be yoked with an ox (Deuteronomy 22:10), but were to be rested on the Sabbath (Exodus 23:12).  Samson used the jawbone of an ass to slay a thousand Philistines (Judges 15:16).  Poor Absalom found himself suspended by his neck when his ass rode beneath the thick branches of a great tree and kept going (2 Samuel 18:9). An ass’s foal carried Jesus on his triumphal entry into Jerusalem (Mark 11:2 and all the gospels).
My favorite ass of the Bible belonged to Balaam, a non-Israelite prophet.  As told in Numbers 22, God was pissed because Balaam had saddled up his ass and was riding off with the officials of Moab to Balak, the King of Moab, before God gave his leave.  Balak wanted Balaam to curse the Israelites who came up from the desert and were slaughtering nations left and right, something God apparently approved of.  God sent a fearsome angel with a drawn sword to put an end to the disobedient prophet. The angel was invisible to Balaam, but his ass could see the angel and turned aside, earning him a beating from his master.  The angel took another position on the road, hemmed in by vineyard walls on either side.  Again, Balaam’s ass turned aside, causing Balaam’s foot to be scraped against the wall.  Balaam again beat his ass.  The angel moved to a more strategic position with no room on either side of the road.  This time Balaam’s ass sat down and refused to move.  Balaam beat him bloody, but the Lord gave voice to the ass, who rightly reprimanded his master, and opened Balaam’s eyes so that he could see the fate that would have been his, but for his faithful ass.  The lesson, of course, is LISTEN TO YOUR ASS.
St. Francis of Assisi referred to his body as Brother Ass, and had a tendency to punish it for what seemed like disobedience with scourging and casting himself naked into a pile of snow, without having first bathed in a sauna.  Toward the end of his life, Francis is said to have regretted not taking better care of Brother Ass and apologized to him.
As you will see, this does relate to preparing for a thru-hike.  I’ve been hurting the last two days, especially my knees.  Perhaps it is the approach of a cold front that should pass this afternoon.   Perhaps it is today’s Super Flower Blood Moon.  It’s both legs, so I don’t think it is injury.  I worked my legs at the Y this morning using reduced weights and admittedly poor form, poor enough that it got the attention of one of the fitness trainers I respect.  My tendency was to snap at him, but I reined it in and thanked him for telling me what I already knew.  
On this hike, I am hoping for the wisdom to listen to my body, to heed the warnings of Brother Ass, and to pay attention to his needs for nutrition and rest.  On most previous hikes, I’ve woken before daylight, had a bit of cold breakfast, and started hiking at first light.  This time, I intend to heat up water and have a cup of hot coffee. Starbucks Via Instant Dark Italian Roast is close to palatable.  I intend to do the same stretching and physical therapy protocols I do at home before walking down to the Y.  I will miss my foam roller!  For stretching, I follow the Assisted Isolated Stretching techniques developed by kinesiologist Aaron Mattes.  His clinic is in Sarasota, Florida, and I had the good fortune to be taught by him personally 30 years ago.  I use a collapsed hiking stick with strap as a substitute for his preferred rope.  I’ll do 45 sets, 12 of which are physical therapy.  If done daily, only about five repetitions are needed to maintain a full range of motion, with extra reps if there is pain.  It sounds like a lot, but only takes about 30 minutes.  Brother Ass is worth it.",,View Entry,"May 26, Wed",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638157,"The choices I make before leaving for the trailhead can increase my safety, build my self-confidence, and increase the odds of my having a successful hike.  Good choices can also reduce my impact on the trail. Most of the Leave No Trace suggestions are just good common sense.  
The timing of this hike was dictated by Covid, but even if there had been no restrictions, I still would have elected a flip-flop hike.  I am not a misanthrope, not exactly, but I can identify with Linus van Pelt of Peanuts:  I love mankind … it’s people I can’t stand.  I enjoy people in ones and twos, up to a dinner party, but I freak at cocktail parties and I break out in a cold sweat at the thought of attending a sports event.  I have no desire to exceed the LNT guidance for a maximum group size of 10.  The latest count I saw for hopeful thru-hikers leaving Georgia  this year was 3.300!  I shudder at the thought.
Carrying a map and compass or other navigation device can help me not get lost or when I do find myself “misplaced” increase the chance of finding my own way back to the trail, avoiding the heavy trail impact of search and rescue, not to mention the embarrassment.  Hint: If you are depending on your cellphone for navigation, consider carrying an external battery and downloading any needed maps before starting your hike.  
I carry a strong, durable Big Dig trowel for burying my poop, and I wish everybody did instead of thinking, “I won’t be hiking this trail again, so who cares if I poop on the trail itself and don’t bother burying it?” At 1/2 ounce, my trowel is a small price to pay to propitiate the LNT gods who are always watching.  
Stripping excess packaging from food saves weight and volume, and there’s less to carry out.
LNT suggests bringing a piece of screening for filtering food scraps from dishwater and packing them out.  I go one better and clean my cooking pot with a little water and my impeccably clean index finger and drink the dessert soup.  Repeat a couple of times, and it’s clean enough until I get into town for a proper pot cleaning.  Similarly, I use only a tiny amount of toothpaste and swallow it as an after dinner mint.
I have suffered borderline hypothermia twice, so the LNT suggestion of preparing for extreme weather is not an option for me.  I identify a town near the section of trail I’ll be hiking and look at the historic average and record low temperatures, subtracting 10 degrees for the elevation of the trail.  I plan for comfort at the average low and survivability at the adjusted record low.  I have had my face pelted by hail in summer, so I carry a Buff that can double as a balaclava. 
More controversial is the LNT suggestion to have a waterproof bag and 50 feet of line or a bear-resistant canister for food storage.  There remain hikers who use their food bag as a pillow at night.  I try to tent at some distance from them.  Have you heard of trail magic?  It’s an unexpected occurrence, often involving food, that lifts a hiker’s spirits and inspires awe or gratitude.  The best trail magic is spontaneous, like a young boy offering to share his Chicken McNuggets with me at an overlook along the Blue Ridge Parkway, with the approval of his mommy and daddy.  A lovely lady who lives near Waynesboro, Virginia sets up an ice cream social at a gap along the trail every Memorial Day weekend.  Those who make magic happen are termed trail angels.  With the increased number of hikers and the increased number of bears, the frequency of interaction has greatly increased.  Bears are losing their instinctive fear of humans and are coming to see us as trail angels, odd two-legged creatures who carry tasty goodies into the woods for them.  A true hiker never asks for food, although walking by a picnic intoxicated by the smell of fried chicken and salivating is permitted.  Bears lack any sense of hiker etiquette and take what they want.  Bears do not share well with humans, and their table manners are atrocious. Bears that successfully obtain food from hikers may need to be relocated or even euthanized.  
It used to be that the only animals you feared might get into your food were mice.  The nighttime routine was to hang your food from a shelter roof beam with an inverted tuna can as a mouse baffle. This was before tuna came in pouches.  Until recently, simply tossing a line over a branch, hauling up your food bag and tying it off to a tree trunk was sufficient to defeat bears.  
More hikers has meant more food and more opportunities for bears to perfect their art.  It’s an arms race of sorts, and hikers have developed ingenious ways of hanging food.  Google “PCT Method Bear Hang” and see for yourself.  The bears are winning.  In 2019, The Appalachian Trail Conservancy reported 65 incidents of bears obtaining human foods.  User comments on Guthook this year include many reports of bears defeating even elegant hangs, sometimes by simply breaking the limb, or hauling the bag up from above.  Bears have even learned to defeat Ursack Bear Bags that are claimed  to be puncture and tear resistant by bears.  It’s like trying to keep a determined squirrel out of a bird feeder.   Professional backpacker (yes, there is such a thing) Andrew Skurka offers five reasons not to hang a bear bag:

You probably suck at it — My line seldom went over the limb I aimed for.
It’s often impossible — At the end of a long day of hiking, good luck finding a limb that will result in the food bag positioned twelve feet off the ground, six feet away from the trunk, and six feet from the nearest limb.
It’s time consuming — Do I want to spend my time searching for the perfect tree or starting dinner?
It can cause injury or death — Hint: Don’t stand on the line when you throw the rock over the limb, and don’t hit the limb causing the rock to ricochet back toward your head.  When the rock comes untied from the line, think about where it might go.
It’s rarely effective against a determined bear.

Increasingly the trail maintaining clubs have been providing bear poles, bear cables, or heavy steel boxes with bear-resistant latches for safer food storage.  If hikers took responsibility for properly storing their own food, this dreadful burden on the clubs would be unnecessary. The alternative is to carry a hard-sided canister.  There is only one five-mile section of the Appalachian Trail, in Georgia, where camping without a canister is prohibited.  Hiker resistance to bear canisters has been strong.  The most frequent objections are the bulk and weight of the canisters and the notion that SOMEONE is telling the hiker what to do.   
I have carried the Bearikade canister, made from carbon fiber and aircraft aluminum, for several years now.  The 9” diameter exceeds the bite radius of even a grizzly bear and is too slippery for a bear to carry far.  It remains undefeated in testing with bears and there has not been a single report of a bear defeating a properly-locked Bearikade.   It’s large at 750 cu. in., and will hold six or seven days’ food, plus my stove and cook set and toiletry items. It weighs just over two pounds.  It didn’t carry well in the backpack I had been using, so I switched to the ULA-Equipment Circuit weighing one pound more.  Even with the heavier pack and the canister, the total weight of my gear, except for consumables, is just below 15 pounds.  Carrying the canister allows me to carry snacks like chips and cookies that would be crushed to crumbs in a standard food bag.   At 12” tall, it’s a good height as a stool in camp or at breaks or lunch.  
I always feel honored when I see a bear.  I’ve seen them in 12 of the 14 trail states, all but West Virginia and Connecticut.  One definition of wilderness is places where there are bears.  If my careless food storage caused the death of one of these magnificent creatures, I would have a hard time returning to the woods.  I carry a canister for me, but even more, I carry a canister for the bears!",,View Entry,"May 30, Sun",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638421,"I woke up yesterday thinking that I have either been foolish, optimistic, or overly faithful in thinking that my new knees could handle the demands of hiking on real trail.  They couldn’t last August, when I had to bail on the Northville Lake Placid Trail in the Adirondacks.  At that time, my newer knee was only eight months old.  I’ve been working my legs hard at the Y, building strength and endurance.  They’ve done well on long walks on the lakefront bike path, but because of mud season, I haven’t been able to test them on real trail.  Nonetheless, I went ahead and registered my hike and purchased Amtrak tickets last month.
Most places have four seasons (cue Vivaldi here), but Vermont has five or even six.  The fifth is mud season which is inserted between winter and spring, when the melting snow and the thawing ground create huge patches or even ponds of mud on Vermont’s trails.  Hiking during mud season damages the trails and is actively discouraged.  Traditionally, mud season ends on Memorial Day weekend.  The sixth season, if you are curious, is stick season, when is between autumn’s leaf season and winter, when the trees are bare and the snows haven’t come yet.
I didn’t want to go out on Memorial Day weekend, since the trails were bound to be crowded, so I waited until today.  The weather this morning is grand, with clear skies and temperatures in the upper 50’s and low 60’s this morning.  I chose Mt. Philo State Park.  Mt. Philo is only 968’ tall, but the mountain stands alone near Lake Champlain in Charlotte, about 30 minutes south of Burlington.  The trail from the parking area to the summit is about one mile but gains 600 feet in elevation and is steep in places.  There’s also a park road to the summit in case I had to bail.  The original carriage road was built in 1903 by the owners of nearby Mt. Philo Inn (still in operation).  In 1924, they deeded 150 acres to the State for use as a recreation area, and it became Vermont’s first state park.  In the 1930’s, the Civilian Conservation Corps built the present road and the wooden structures on the summit.  Subsequent land donations have increased the size of the park to 237 acres.  
The park opens at 8 AM, but I arrived around 7:45.  The gatehouse was not staffed so I continued in and parked.  For people 62 and older, Vermont offers a lifetime Green Mountain Passport for $2, that includes free admission to state parks.  I stopped on my way out, and it turns out that entering before 8 AM is free for everyone!  When I lived in Florida, the state parks were gated outside of operating hours.  If you purchased an annual pass to a specific park, you were given the gate combination, but otherwise you paid.  
I immediately noticed that the trail has been improved since I was last here in 2017.  Areas prone to poor drainage or erosion have been rebuilt.  A new summit trail to eliminate the steepest section is under construction.  I was bothered by tiny biting flies, so I put on my permethrin-treated headband, and they were banished!  I won’t say that I scampered up like a young mountain goat, but I made good time and had absolutely no pain or discomfort.  The view over my shoulder is superb of surrounding farms and Lake Champlain.  Going down, I met a lovely Golden Doodle named after Ruth Bader Ginsberg and her person.",,View Entry,"Jun 02, Wed",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638433,"The second Leave No Trace principle is “Travel and Camp on Durable Surfaces.”  The reason for this recommendation is obvious — to reduce impact on the trail itself and the surrounding ecological communities.  One reason people hike is to enjoy nature and to immerse themselves in wilderness, but the very act of hiking impacts nature and the experience.  The more hikers, the more impact.  Measuring these impacts and designing mechanisms to mitigate them has actually become a respected academic discipline, recreation ecology.  The science has informed policy, adding important buzzwords such as Limits of Acceptable Change (LAC) and Visitor Experience and Resource Protection (VERP).  In the Appalachian Trail community, there’s talk about loving the trail to death.  
The number of hikers on the Appalachian Trail is not limited by regulation at present.  The Appalachian Trail Conservancy encourages hikers to avoid crowded start dates and to consider alternatives to the “traditional” Georgia-to-Maine thru-hike, but it’s all voluntary.  Another National Scenic Trail, the Pacific Crest Trail running from Mexico to Canada, requires  a long-distance permit issued by the U.S. Forest Service and the Pacific Crest Trail Association.  There are daily and season limits, with a complex queue management system in place.  Could this be the future for the AT?  I personally think that AT permits are unlikely due to the difficulty in enforcing them, with over 500 road crossings.  ATC and its ridge runners have no law enforcement authority.  How many National Park Service Law Enforcement Rangers do you think are assigned to the 2,193.1 miles of the AT?  I’m not sure today, but I’ve never known the number to exceed two, and it’s often been the Lone Ranger.   Mostly, the NPS law enforcement rangers coordinate operations with local law enforcement agencies, who have better things to do than check hikers for permits.  
Hikers should walk down the center of the trail to avoid inadvertently widening the trail.  That’s also a good practice for tick prevention, since it minimizes contact with trailside foliage.  But it doesn’t always work that way.  If the trail is muddy or ponding water, hikers are tempted to hike on the edges or even to create a new parallel trail.   ATC suggests wearing gaiters and waterproof boots and walking through puddles and mud.  I personally dislike boots with water-resistant membranes except in winter.  The breathability of the membranes is compromised when they become dirty, which is the perpetual state of trail shoes.  I find them to be like hiking with plastic bags around my feet with sweat and the resultant odor accumulating, even if I take them off at breaks.  I much prefer low hiking shoes that get wet quickly and dry quickly.  I wear a low non-waterproof gaiter made by Dirty Girls (really) that are sufficient to keep pebbles, leaves and other trail debris out of my shoes.  When it first starts to rain, I try to rock hop and even to walk on the edge of the trail to avoid puddles, but it isn’t long before my shoes are waterlogged. Then it doesn’t matter and I transform into a little boy taking great joy in splashing in the puddles.  
ATC sometimes seems to view hikers as the villain, responsible for degradation of the trail, but I take issue with that.  Too often the reason that there is poor drainage and that hikers have created a large quagmire out of what was once a narrow trail is poor trail design and maintenance.  It’s easier to construct trail at the base of a ridge, but that’s where fine sediment and water collects.  If the trail were relocated to the side of the ridge with good design, for example, using Coweta dips instead of water bars, maintenance would be minimal.  Recreation ecology even recommends not trimming the foliage on the outside of sidehill construction, to encourage hikers to walk on the inside where the trail is stronger and erosion less likely.  
There’s another time when I will not walk down the center of the trail, and that comes from having hiked Vermont several times.  If the trail in front of me is black, especially shiny black, and I don’t see footprints, I won’t step there.  It’s apt of be bottomless mud, bootsucking mud.  Mud season in Vermont ends on Memorial Day weekend, but the mud bogs can persist until it freezes again in late Fall.  Mud with the consistency of oatmeal isn’t too bad, but any runnier, and I tend to poke at it with my hiking sticks, hoping to find a submerged rock or limb that I might step on.  The first time I hiked Vermont, in 1998, I wore high boots and knee-high gaiters and once stepped where I ought not to have, sinking knee deep.  Fortunately, only one leg went into the bog.  Hiker Tip:  Extract your foot very slowly until the suction breaks, or risk losing your boot!  I haven’t heard of hikers completely vanishing into the mud, but I can imagine archeologists in the future discovering hiker bog bodies in Vermont and speculating on their religious significance.  Thinking of the mud as a beauty treatment really doesn’t help.
I’ve been told that it takes only two consecutive nights of tenting on a pristine site to degrade the environment.  Dispersed camping is allowed in the National Forests.  Some states including Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts restrict camping to designated sites, but hikers persist creating “stealth” sites.  I spent a day with a maintainer in  Connecticut scattering fire rings from stealth sites along the Housatonic River and trying to disguise the sites with brush.  Most hikers find a so-called stealth site by seeing it from the trail, but if you can see the campsite, others can to, and it isn’t long before a pristine site has a fire ring and attracts more and more overnight visitors.  I think it is a better practice to use official shelters and campsites or at least to avoid creating new ones.  One spinoff of recreation ecology has been the practice of siting new shelters on sloping ground, where the only level places for tenting are constructed pads.  It prevents the shelter area from expanding with use.  Gooch Mountain Shelter in Georgia is a good example.  Also, instead of surrounding ""revegetation areas"" with tacky orange plastic fencing to discourage tenting, iceberging a boulder in the center of the site makes tenting impossible, solving the problem. Concentrating overnight use helps to keep the wilderness looking wild, at least between the shelters.  I used to look down on hikers who sought out every hostel, bed and breakfast, and motel along the trail and arranged for shuttles at road crossings, anything to avoid a night on the trail.  Now I think of them as LNT heroes.  By minimizing their nights on the trail, they are protecting the resource.",,View Entry,"Jun 03, Thu",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638577,"The third Leave No Trace principle is “Dispose of Waste Properly.”  You know what that means.  There are a few types of innocuous waste we can dispose of quickly, and then we need to speak about poop.  Please don’t giggle.  I would prefer to use the good strong S-word, with Proto-Germanic roots to Old English, but I don’t want to be accused of vulgarity and risk my PG rating. The use of feces from the Latin faeces or excrement from the Latin excrementum is just too precious and clinical.   And so we will use the onomatopoeic poop of uncertain origin.  This is what comes of solitary hiking without being plugged into music.  Too much time to plumb the profound mysteries of the universe.  
About a year ago Vermont began requiring food waste to be separated from trash and either composted on site or picked up by a vendor for composting.  There was much wailing and gnashing of teeth among some of the residents or our condominium, but in short order, it became second nature.  We keep a small OXO compost bin in our refrigerator and small trash and recycling bins under the kitchen sink.  A couple of times a week, we take them all out to the carriage barn behind our building and deposit their contents in the appropriate rolling bins.  Proper waste disposal along the Appalachian Trail is different but quickly becomes as automatic.  It is just a matter of getting used to it.
There shouldn’t be food waste, at least not after the first week or so of hiking when THE HUNGER sets in.  If you do find yourself with more food than you can eat, first try to find someone hungrier who will scarf it down.  That transforms your waste into their waste.  If the problem isn’t your appetite but your culinary skills, you may need to add the leftovers to your garbage bag (usually a quart Ziplock plastic bag) and carry it out.  Store it in your food bag or bear canister.  What is unacceptable is dumping it in a privy, broadcasting it into the woods, putting it into the fire ring thinking that someone else will burn it, or catholing it with your toilet spade.  These methods attract animals into the shelter or campsite area.  What about orange peels, apple cores, or banana peels?  They may even be organic, but in the woods, they are trash, your trash.  Treat them as such.  Orange and banana peels take up to two years to degrade.  Cigarette butts take up to five years.  Don’t leave them in fire rings; carry them out!  I promised myself that I wouldn’t scold or hector, but I loathe seeing cigarette butts on the trail and around shelters
I already mentioned trying to remove unnecessary packing materials from food before adding it to your food bag or bear canister, but it’s hard to eliminate all of it.  My beloved Little Debbies Oatmeal Creme Pies are individually wrapped.  Freeze dried or dehydrated dinners come conveniently packaged in “just add boiling water” pouches.  If you can carry in the packaged food, you can carry out the empty packaging.  Most food packaging does not burn cleanly in a campfire, certainly not tin cans.  
Before “Leave No Trace,” there was “Pack it in; Pack it out.”  This applies not only to food waste and packaging but also to anything you might be tempted to leave in a trail shelter, even partially-full gas canisters, paperback books, or even Bibles.  Your intentions may be pure and noble, but your treasures are others’ trail trash. Save them for hiker boxes in hostels or trail motels.  It’s bonus LNT points to carry out more trash than your own or to cajole a day hiker into carrying out the bag of garbage left at a shelter by someone less considerate than you.  
Then there are the 100-feet-from-the-shelter items, like disposing of dishwater, toothpaste and pee. You can do as I do and drink your dishwater and swallow your tiny dab of toothpaste.  Peeing near the shelter or campsite encourages animals such as deer to come in for the salts.  The pee odor at older shelters can be intense, like an understaffed and uncaring nursing home.  Thirty-five or forty steps will do nicely.  
Peeing in the Great Outdoors is a special privilege for guys at least.  It means never sitting at your desk, thinking, “I really need to pee, but first I’ll finish this draft.”  No special skills are needed.  Just take it out and enjoy.  Try not to pee on foliage, or at least spread the wealth.  It is preferable to pee on stone, gravel or duff (the stuff on the forest floor, like leaves, pine needles and twigs).  With practice, you can even continue to hike as you pee.  There is adventure peeing, like peeing across state lines or, if you hike the Long Trail, the U.S.-Canadian border.  There are special concerns for women, and I know nothing about that, but Google does.   
A question often arises, “Should I pee in the privy or in the woods?”  The answer is the favorite answer of CPAs everywhere, the one I loved to offer to any tax question: “It depends.”  There are three basic kinds of privies:  

The oldest design is the pit privy, a hole in the ground with a toilet seat mounted above for convenience, and hopefully a surrounding structure with some sort of ventilation system.  Pee in the woods.  Urine increases the stench of a pit privy.
There are composting privies.  A handful of provided bark mulch should be added after each personal deposit.  Composting privies tend to be low to the ground and surrounded by various barrels of mulch and bins for compost to age before it is spread on the forest floor.  Pee in the woods.  Urine increases the amount of mulch needed to absorb the moisture, creating more work for the volunteer caretaker whose job is miserable enough without the added burden.
The gold standard is the mouldering privy that typically is raised one-to-three feet above the ground over a slatted base.  Users should add a handful of provided wood shavings after each deposit.  The waste is slowly decomposed in the presence of air by worms and microorganisms.  Moisture is needed, so it’s okay to pee in a mouldering privy.  

There are sometimes signs indicating “Pee in the woods” or “Pee in the privy,” but  these signs are usually on the inside of the privy door, seen too late to do any good.  
Bill Bryson, in A Walk in the Woods, is inordinately proud of having pooped in the woods like a bear, as though it were a validation of his manhood.  He used the “s” word, perhaps scratching his butt, affecting a southern drawl and spitting to the side as he says it.  He bought tons of useless gear for his hike, but drew the line at a little orange backpacking spade, “on the grounds that these were unnecessary, too expensive, or invited ridicule.”  First, you cannot kick a proper 6-8” cathole with the heel of your boot unless you are on a sandy beach. Second, Coghlan’s orange backpackers trowel, which is probably the one he was shown, costs $5.50 at Walmart and I just found it on sale for $1.59.  Third, showing concern for the environment and other hikers — no one likes to see unburied turds and toilet paper — does not make one a “sissy.” A gentleman perhaps, but not a sissy.   
I prefer not to poop in the woods. For most of my life, I either ran or walked in the morning before work. There are few things worse than being several miles from home and having the urge to poop manifest in a way that cannot be denied. No stores open yet. No construction sites with Porta Potties. No dense woods. There were certainly embarrassing incidents and I would change my route for the next week or so.  My body proved trainable.  By the time I finished my stretches, my body was ready for pooping and then for safe running.  My knees put a stop to my running, but I remain a morning pooper. Since there’s usually a privy associated with shelters and designated campsites, I only rarely need to poop in the woods like a bear.  There are shelters, particularly in the Smokies and in Tennessee, that lack privies and occasionally poorly maintained privies that are too disgusting to use.  So mastering the art of pooping in the woods is essential.
The LNT guideline is to walk 200 feet (about 75 or 80 paces) away from shelters, campsites, and water sources.  I recommend bringing your pack with you instead of leaving it on the trail, so that if you forget where the trail is, you at least have everything you need.  Dig a hole 6-8 inches deep, squat and release.  You will quickly learn to spread your feet and bunch up your shorts, and your aim will improve in time.  It helps to site your cat-hole so that a small tree trunk is within reach for support.  Add a little water or pee and stir with a stick to speed decomposition.  Push your toilet paper to the bottom of the poop soup  and bury it, scattering duff across the top to disguise it.  It is unpleasant, and unlike Bill Bryson, I do not find it to be an act of affirmation, but it is the right thing to do both for the environment and out of consideration for your fellow hikers.  
There are natural alternatives to toilet paper.  I’ve read that rocks, leaves, sticks, snow and even pinecones work just dandy.  A friend in Georgia collects a soft variety of fern as he hikes for the time of need, but I’m not personally convinced that ripping up live ferns to wipe your butt is a good LNT practice.  I carry white, unscented toilet paper, preferably Charmin Ultra Soft.  I am not a bear.  Extra LNT credit is available if you pack out your toilet paper or bring WAG bags and carry out your poop.  I’m not there yet.",,View Entry,"Jun 06, Sun",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639034,"I woke up this morning with a conversation going on in my head.  I eavesdropped.  At first, I thought it was my angel self and my devil self, like the cartoon trope in various Warner Brothers cartoons and even The Simpsons, where a little angel and a little demon stand on opposite shoulders whispering contrary advice in the character’s ears.  Then I realized that the voices represented my Apollonian and Dionysian selves, a concept I haven’t thought about since college.  Did I mention that I went to one of the experimental, hippy, liberal arts colleges in the 1960’s?  For those of you who didn’t, both Apollo and Dionysus are sons of Zeus.  Apollo is the god of the sun, identified with logic, prudence, and rational thinking.  Dionysus is the god of wine and dance, the ruler of emotions, instincts, and general irrational chaos. During periods of my life, one or the other has held sway.  The conversation went something like this:
Apollo:  I trust that you are good and sore this morning.
Dionysus:  I am, but it’s no worse than my typical hangover.
A: Why did you put the thought into Sug’s ear to hike the Camels Hump Loop yesterday?  Didn’t you remember how difficult it is?  Or have you forgotten that he’s an old man with double knee replacements?
D: He did it fine 20 years ago, and that’s but the flick of a black fly’s wing, for Zeus’ sake.
A: Have you forgotten what short lives mortals have?  Twenty years is an eternity to them.  They age so quickly.
D: There were only a couple of places he might have died, and better to die a hero than to slowly rock away.  Besides, you know how my memory is, what with all the booze and drugs.  I thought the tough parts were south of where Sug intersected the Long Trail.  
A: Didn’t you read the trail description?  Sure, it’s only 5.5 miles with an elevation gain of 2,300 feet, but didn’t you notice the average grade of 16% and the maximum grade of 82%? 
D: I didn’t remember it being that hard, so I trusted my memory and not the numbers.  You know how I am.  Besides, Sug survived, didn’t he?
Camels Hump is my favorite mountain in Vermont, the second highest peak in Vermont at 4,015 feet with the second largest alpine zone after its neighbor Mansfield at 4.393 feet.  Downtown Burlington is built on a hill, rising about 250 feet to the University of Vermont at the top.  We live directly across the street from the campus, and it’s only a two block walk to the crest of the hill and great views of both of these majestic peaks.  From our living room, we look out over the City and Lake Champlain, to the high peaks of the Adirondacks on the other side.  Yeah, I know, 4,000 feet is far from majestic, but what we see are just the nubbins of what were once Everest-sized mountains, slowly worn down by water and wind over 400 million years. The glaciers of the last ice age, performed a facelift on the Green Mountains, and they look far younger and gnarlier as a result. 
I completed section-hiking the Appalachian Trail in 2001 though a series of 10 sections hikes over eight years.  I loved hiking Vermont; I had a dry mud-free hike in August 1998.  So in 2002, I started the Long Trail at the Canadian border, intending to thru-hike the 273-mile Long Trail.  My knees had other ideas, and I aborted in Johnsonville.  The next year, I started in Williamstown, Massachusetts and hiked north to Johnsonville, my knees temporarily quiescent.   For some reason, the wooden ladders placed by the Green Mountain Club on the most difficult sections were out on vacation or being rebuilt. It was incredibly difficult in places, having to lower myself root-by-root at times.  The hike over Camels Hump was the highlight of the journey, mostly because the summit is undeveloped and getting up there requires hiking.  There are no roads and no gondola.  The view is unimpeded, back to Killington and over to Mt. Washington.  I remember some difficult bouldering but my mind placed the tough sections south of Camels Hump.  I should know better than to rely on my memory.  
The Burrows Trailhead parking area (elevation 1,792’) is a 40 minute drive, and I got there about 7:30.  It was chilly in the upper 40’s, and I was tempted to switch to a long-sleeved hoody, but I knew I would warm up quickly.  The Forest City Trail up to the ridge line and the Long Trail is 1.4 miles and gains 900 feet, a nice warmup.  From there it is 1.8 miles and 1,300 feet elevation gain to the summit.  The trail is rocky, with some significant bouldering using hands and feet. There were not as many white blazes as I would have liked, but Mud Season has only just ended so now the maintainers can begin. There were several instances where I had to stop and look for the trail, including notably at the near vertical rock face of the summit looming above.  I had already been up some steep stuff, but I couldn’t imagine that.  I thought about turning around, but there was no way I was going to go down the things I had already come up.  After a few minutes, I spotted a blaze to the side.  The trail slabs around the cliff face.  For someone with longer legs, it would have been easy.  It is one of the places where a fall could have serious consequences, and I kept reminding myself not to look down past my feet.  This was the spot that had terrified me in 2002, but my memory conveniently shunted it to another mountain.  From there, the final ascent is clambering up a series of rock ledges, in the alpine zone.  There were a half-dozen hikers on the summit and I took my break there, listening to the white-throated sparrows, one of my favorite songbirds.  One very good thing is that the mountain is made of a course-grained granite that offers excellent grip and traction.  The 2.4 miles back to the parking area was much easier.  The loop took me about five hours, not counting my summit break, which is about average.  My knees were no sorer than the rest of my body, so I count that as a success. 
I view yesterday’s hike as my knees’ final exam for my AT thru-hike.  They passed, perhaps not with honors, but my undergraduate college had no grades anyway.  I am none the worse for wear this morning, but I will limit my exercise to walking down to Church Street to meet a friend for coffee.  I carried all of my gear, except for tent, sleeping bag, sleeping pad, and bear canister.  The backpack rode incredibly well and I never noticed it.  I found that I didn’t like having a bottle of water mounted to the shoulder strap and will return to using a liter Platypus Hoser in a side pocket.  Yesterday’s hike was far harder than anything on the southern portion of the AT.  The climbs yesterday remind me of the Kinsman Mountains in New Hampshire and Mahoosuc Arm and Katahdin in Maine.  I can do it!
Being me, I totally forgot to take any pictures, but the stock image above shows the mountain at about this time of year.  The Long Trail pretty much follows the ridge.",,View Entry,"Jun 11, Fri",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639085,"Yesterday, I was hurting from my Camels Hump hike the day before.  All better today, and after stretching, I resumed my exercise routine at the Y.  Aside from the inevitable gray hair and wrinkles, the greatest physical change I’ve noticed with age is the lengthening of recovery time after overdoing things.  It used to be that a good night’s sleep cured anything.  Nowadays, it’s hardly worth abusing myself since I lose the next day.  That’s my Apollonian self.  But as soon the pain recedes, I’m ready for a Dionysian romp in the woods again. 
We’ve all heard the adage, “Leaves of three, let it be,” referring to poison ivy.  Leaving aside that poison ivy leaves are  compound, so that the three leaves are actually leaflets, it expresses a valuable truth for those allergic or sensitive to poison ivy.  That’s about 85% of us.  I carry a small tube of cortisone creme, and that’s sufficient for the occasional rash.  My previous doctor’s advice was to keep it clean, something not easily achieved on a hike, and unless it was either on my face or privates and the itching was driving me crazy, try and ignore it.  Only once did I have to phone him for a prescription for oral prednisone when it was out of control.  I will forever associate Pearisburg, Virginia with poison ivy.  I itch at the memory of it.
That’s my introduction to the fourth Leave-No-Trace principle, “Leave What You Find.”  It’s easy to leave noxious plants alone, but not so easy with raspberries, blackberries and blueberries.  Only the most zealous LNT practitioners will say to leave them alone, too.  LNT.org advises that “experienced campers may enjoy an occasional edible plant, but are careful not to deplete the surviving vegetation or disturb plants that are rare or are slow to reproduce.”  
More specific guidance is found in the Superintendent’s Compendium for the National Park Service Appalachian National Scenic Trail.  They administer lands that were specifically acquired for the trail and are outside of national parks and national forests.  Wendy Janssen, the Park Superintendent, issued a revised Compendium in May of this year.  It provides a list of various fruits, berries, nuts and fungi that may be gathered by hand for personal use.  

Blueberries (Vaccinium spp.)
Strawberries (Fragaria virginiana)
Blackberries (Rubus spp.)
Grapes (Vitis spp.)
Elderberries (Sambucus pubens)
Gooseberries/Currants (Ribes spp.)
Black raspberries (Rubus occidentalis)
Huckleberries (Gaylussacia spp.)
Cherries (Prunus spp.)
Serviceberries (Amelanchier laevis)
Persimmons (Diospyros virginiana)
Black walnuts (Juglans nigra)
Hickory Nuts (Carva spp.)
American hazelnuts (Corvlus americana)
Apples (Malus domestica)
Pears (Pyrus spp.)
Peaches (Prunus persica)
Pawpaws (Asimina triloba)
Red Mulberries (M. rubra L.)
Mushrooms (limited to above-ground fruiting bodies and at least 200 feet from the trail)

Up to one pound of each species per person per day is authorized, with all mushrooms combined.  There is a special prohibition on the collection of ramps (wild onions) and ginseng.  Commercial harvesting of any plant is not allowed.  
A hiker bent on making miles is unlikely to exceed this limitation, so nibble away, with a clear conscience. The Compendium doesn’t address it, but I also enjoy the young shoots, leaves, and tendrils of greenbrier (Smilax spp.) as a trailside snack tasting like baby asparagus.  Young leaves of garlic mustard, a noxious invasive species, make a nice potherb.  Stinging nettle (Utica dioica) leaves lose their sting when cooked and taste similar to spinach.  Wood sorrel (Oxalis spp.) is also a good potherb or can be enjoyed as a salad with a sprinkling of olive oil.  As its Latin name suggests, sorrel is rich in oxalic acid, which inhibits the absorption of calcium.  In large quantities, far more than I would eat, it can be toxic. 
Fishing or harvesting crayfish is possible along the Appalachian Trail, with proper state licensure, but I’ve only rarely seen hikers willing to take the time.  At Speck Pond, the highest freshwater lake in Maine, a  fly fisher up for the day offered us his catch of brook trout.  It took a group effort, but we managed to clean the fish, crush granola bars for a coating, stuff them with sorrel and sauté them in olive oil.  It was a memorable feast, especially after having done Mahoosuc Notch that day.
I started this entry with “Leaves of three, let it be.”  “Let it be” is pretty much the guidance ATC offers for this Leave No Trace principal.  Cultural artifacts are not yours. leave them.  Don’t collect rocks, flora or fauna for souvenirs.  The shelters and signposts are not yours; don’t vandalize them with graffiti.  Don’t mar the land by trenching around your tent, something that was commonplace fifty years ago.  Don’t cut down live trees for firewood; it burns poorly anyway.  Leave dead standing timber alone — it’s useful for wildlife.  ATC also advises the use of rubber tips on the bottom of your trekking poles.  I personally find rubber tips useless since they are sucked off by the first muddy patch of trail.  It’s easy enough not to scratch rocks with the carbide tips of trekking poles by learning to use them properly.",,View Entry,"Jun 12, Sat",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639205,"The fifth Leave No Trace principle is “Minimize Campfire Impacts.”  That is really easy for me.  I hate campfires.  It doesn’t matter where I sit, the wind will shift and soon my eyes are burning and I’m coughing.  I hate the way my clothes smell afterwards.  
I would like to blame post-traumatic stress syndrome from a house fire we had in 2008, but the truth is that I’ve hated campfires, bonfires, and any sort of open outdoor flame for as long as I can remember.  I’m scared of crowds gathered around a fire.  I sense a shared feeling of purpose, that something significant is about to happen, like the burning of a heretic or a witch, or even worse, a pep rally.  
Death by burning was the preferred punishment for “crimes against nature” from the 12th to the 18th century in various European states.  The pejorative term faggot referring primarily to gay men and boys is said to derive from Old French fagot, meaning a bundle of twigs bound up.  The only way to get a fire hot enough to burn a witch is first to burn a few faggots, or so I’ve been told.  When I see a campfire, I think auto-da-fe´ and look around for the Inquisitors.   
You are probably thinking that as a gay man I’m being overly sensitive and dramatic, that such things could never happen here.  The reality is that most states had anti-sodomy laws on their books until recently.  Sodomy included not only what you might think, but often any sex outside of marriage, even between consenting adults.  In practice, the targets of sodomy laws were usually lesbians and gay men, sometimes even in the privacy of their own bedrooms.  The 2003 Supreme Court case of Lawrence v Texas largely invalidated these laws, but they remain on the books in 16 states, including the AT states of North Carolina, Maryland and Massachusetts.  
So forgive me if I don’t help gather wood for the nightly fire.  If you do believe that a hike isn’t a hike without an open fire, please only build them where it’s legal and in an existing fire ring.  Collect dead and downed wood that you can break by hand, and be sure that the fire is cold and completely extinguished before you leave the campsite.  Food waste and containers seldom burn completely and can create poisonous fumes or attract animals.  Do be leery of branches entwined with a vine that may be poison ivy.  I personally find a small square of dark chocolate to be infinitely preferable to a graham cracker slathered with melted marshmallow and milk chocolate.",,View Entry,"Jun 14, Mon",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639391,"There seem to be an unusual number of chipmunks and bunnies this year in my part of Burlington.  The chipmunks want nothing to do with me.  No matter how quietly I walk, they quickly scurry for cover.  I imagine that this is how early mammals survived in the age of dinosaurs.  Don’t ask any questions; don’t be curious; just get out of the way and hide.  The eastern cottontail, on the other hand, while quite wary, is also intent on feeding.  If I walk quietly, in a straight line down the sidewalk, and pretend not to see it, bunny is apt to stay put and continue nibbling as I walk by just a few feet away.  If I make any unpredictable or sudden movement, then bunny is gone.  The gray squirrels in my neighborhood seem relatively steady in numbers and have individual quirks and temperaments.  One squirrel who I see daily will hang upside down on a tree trunk and bark, alerting all the squirrels on the block and many of the birds that a potential predator is out and about.  Most of the other squirrels ignore him and me and go about their business.  The chipmunks, bunnies and squirrels have all adjusted well to life in a human urban environment.
I wish I could say the same for humans entering into wildlife habitat.  I was taught that when you visit someone else’s home, you are on your best behavior.  Sit quietly, engage in quiet conversation, and try not to spill whatever food or drink you may be offered.  In other words, basic etiquette. You don’t go into someone’s living room and start rearranging their furniture, criticizing their taste, or offering them a snack to perform a trick.  You remember that you are the guest and that they are the host. 
When we enter the woods, however, many of us leave etiquette behind.  We don’t walk quietly so much as invade, like wilderness is something to be conquered.  Trees exist to be felled for pasture, farming, or for a little campfire.  Animals exist to amuse us or as food to be harvested.  We speak of swamps as being infested by alligators and snakes (at least in Florida) and shelters as being infested with mice.  No, in the woods, humans are the infestation.  It behooves us to be good guests.  
The sixth Leave No Trace principle, Respect Wildlife, is basic etiquette.  Just for fun, I looked up the word respect.  I preferred the Lexico Oxford English Dictionary definition:  A feeling of deep admiration for someone or something elicited by their abilities, qualities, or achievements;  due regard for the feelings, wishes, rights, or traditions of others.  Doesn’t that say it all?
It means keeping group size down, both while hiking and camping, to avoid undue stress on the environment and wildlife.  The Appalachian Trail Conservancy recommends limits of less than 10 people for overnight use and less than 25 for day use, but it’s up to the relevant land-owning agency to make and enforce rules.  I’ll be a group of two to start this August (my cousin Rocky Raccoon and me) and then I’ll be solo, so it really doesn’t apply to me.  
Because I have a lot of time before I leave for the trail, I looked at some of the various agencies administering the lands of the Appalachian Trail from Harpers Ferry to Springer in Georgia that I’ll be hiking this year.  As might be expected, the National Park Service Appalachian National Scenic Trail office mirrors ATC’s policy, since they work closely together.  Shenandoah National Park limits backpacking groups to 10 or less.  The maximum group size, including affiliated groups, for a campsite in the Great Smokies National Park is eight.  The Washington & Jefferson, Pisgah, and Nantahala National Forests sets a maximum group size of 10 in designated Wilderness areas.  The Cherokee National Forest says that six or less is best, and the Chattahoochee National Forest is silent on the issue.  I’ve concluded that if you are planning a group hike on the Appalachian Trail, check with the applicable federal or state agency about the need for a special use permit.  
ATC discourages commercial use, races, competitive events, and fundraising events on the trail.  A special use permit from the relevant agency may be required.  Planning a large event on the AT is like showing up for a wedding with your kids in tow when the invitation was for two.  
If you are hiking with a dog, please don’t allow the dog to chase or otherwise harass the wildlife.  Pets are prohibited in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and must be leashed in Shenandoah National Park.  Even though you are in the Great Outdoors, it is still your responsibility to bury your dog’s waste and to prevent your pet from fouling water sources, both out of kindness to your fellow hikers and the wildlife.  
Maintain a respectful distance from wildlife.  How far?  Far enough that it doesn’t disturb their activity.  Like with my neighborhood bunnies, it is best to avoid sudden or unpredictable movements that might startle an animal.  Practice quiet walking. Yes, there is such a thing and you can Google it for yourself, but the key is to avoid slapping your foot down.  Not only does this minimize disturbance to the animals, but it also reduces impact to your joints.  If you see a fawn or other baby animal, please resist cuddling it and continue walking so it can maintain the illusion of invisibility.  Momma is usually watching, and it is unlikely to have been orphaned.  
White-footed shelter mice can be endearing, accomplished beggars.  Feeding them only emboldens them, increasing the odds that one will run over your face at night.  Eating outside of the shelter and proper food storage will go a long way toward controlling this problem.  Especially in northern New England, you may encounter red squirrels.  They do not so much beg and scavenge as demand tribute.  One shelter in Vermont had a resident woodlands jumping mouse who redefines cuteness.  They can be up to 10 inches long, of which the tail is six inches.  The hind feet are enlarged and muscular, allowing them to jump nearly 10 feet!
Then there are bears.  It is not enough to respect bears.  They must also respect us.  Let’s start with a few facts.  First the only bears along the Appalachian Trail are black bears, not grizzly bears.  That’s a good thing, because black bears tend to be shy and easily frightened. They are also intelligent, resourceful and curious, and like us, lazy and opportunistic.   They have excellent memories, especially for food sources.  If a bear is successful in getting food from people, they will return like Yogi for another picnic basket.  Eventually, they will have to be relocated or even euthanized, a polite term for killed. 
Now that I’ve gotten your attention, let’s do a reality check.  How dangerous are black bears?  How many deaths by black bear have there been in the wild in the lower 48 states in the twenty year period 2000 to 2019?  Six.  Given the number of hikers and other outdoor enthusiasts, that isn’t very many, but really, if you are the one, isn’t one enough?  Buck Tilden wrote a delightful book published in 1997, How to Die in the Outdoors: 100 interesting ways.  Wouldn’t you rather be mauled by a black bear than bit on your privates by a black widow spider when you sit on a privy?  Would you prefer to be trampled by a herd of zebra?  Or perhaps, you could be one of the 49 people on average killed each year by lightning in the U.S.  Nearly 100 Americans are killed each year by bee stings, and an average of 3,500 to 4,000 drown.  Does the knowledge that over 38,000 people are killed in auto crashes each year on U.S. roadways dissuade you from driving?  To flip the perspective, between 400 and 500 black bears are killed on highways annually, just in Pennsylvania.  People are a far greater danger to bears than bears are to people!  
How do bears encounter people?  First, their sense of smell is seven times more powerful than a bloodhound.  A bear’s hearing is about twice as sensitive as ours over a broader frequency range.  Black bears have excellent vision close up, but details are blurred beyond about 90 feet.  It is possible to surprise a bear. If you approach from downwind, you may see the bear before the bear sees you.  Bears appreciate and use the footpaths humans have carved out, so these encounters are not uncommon.  Back off slowly, continuing to face the bear and from a safer distance, click your hiking sticks together, shout a hearty “Hey, Bear!” or otherwise make a distinctly human sound.  The bear may move their head around trying to sight you, and might even stand for a better view.  In most cases, the bear will move off and you can safely pass.  A bear may make a huffing sound, which I translate as a warning for you not to approach and also a sound of exasperation, “Oh, ^$*#, I was having a perfectly fine time, and that #% $@ human had to show up and ruin it.”  Raise your arms with your hiking sticks, to show the bear what a large and fearsome creature you are.  It’s possible that a black bear may even make a mock charge.  Remind yourself that about 85% of their diet is vegetable and try not to foul yourself.  Do not run from a black bear, lest you trigger a prey response.  If a black bear is intent upon attacking you, the advice is to fight with whatever you have, aiming particularly for the eyes and snout.  
It used to be that most sightings of black bears along the Appalachian Trail were random, and usually the only part sighted was the rump, running away.  As bear populations have increased and the hiker population as increased, bears are increasingly coming into shelter areas and campsites looking for food.  All too often, they are obtaining it, and return again and again.  At the moment, bear activity has led to the closure of four shelters and cautions at an additional three In Virginia, Tennessee and North Carolina.  
More and more shelters have some sort of bear-resistant food storage system, either a bear box — a heavy metal box with a bear-proof latch —  a bear cable — a metal cable strung between two stout trees with a series of pulleyed lateral cables with clips to which a food bag is attached and the bag elevated, with the cable locked to an eye-bolt in another tree — or a bear pole — a 3”x3” steel pole with steel prongs at the top and a gaff for lifting a food bag over a prong, not easy to do with a heavy food bag.  Alternatives are carrying a bear canister, my preference, or pretending to throw a proper bear line each evening (See my entry of May 30).  The advice now is never to leave food unattended in camp or at a shelter.  If you aren’t actively cooking, the food should be secured from bears.  If a bear does come into camp, everyone should scream, bang pots and pans, and otherwise let the bear know that they are not welcome.  If the bear successfully gets food, you can count on it returning and quite possibly bringing friends.  One bear would be bad enough, but a bridge party of bears would ruin a good night’s sleep.   There are incidents of bears ripping into tents, possibly drawn by the smell of food within or cooking odors, and even love bites to the occupants.  Canadian black bears seem less mannerly and there have been fatal attacks, with the hiker dragged off as a late night snack.  Some tenters refer to hammocks as bear piñatas.  
A few hikers carry canisters of bear spray, containing red pepper oil that inflames the eyes and upper respiratory system. It’s much stronger than the similar product intended toward rogue humans.  There are several cautions.  First, keep in mind that it is not a bear repellent like mosquito repellent.  Don’t spray it on yourself thinking to keep bears away.  Obvious, yes, but it happens every year.  Second, if you are going to carry it, it needs to be in a holster or otherwise available if you need it.  And third, remember that the cloud of pepper mist drifts with the wind, sometimes with unintended consequences.  Do not spray it into the wind!  Carefully position the bear so that it is downwind.  
If a bear is looking to score your food or worse, you, it probably doesn’t matter if it is a male or female.  Most mature black bears are about four to seven feet from nose to tail, and two to three feet high at the withers.  Males are larger, commonly weighing 130 to 500 pounds, with females approximately 90-250 pounds.  From my experience, males have broader faces and a stockier build.  The muzzle on the female is more elongated, and in relative terms, dainty. With mature bears, I have never been in doubt about their sex.  My first hike through Shenandoah National Park in September 1997, I saw six bears and compared notes of my sightings with the park naturalist.  We agreed on the sex of each.  The largest was a male that we both estimated at 600 pounds.  He was feeding alongside the trail on Loft Mountain, and requested that I wait until he was finished before I passed.  I did.  I have usually smelled bear before seeing them.  It’s an acrid musty odor, quite distinct from hiker funk.  The males seem to have a more pronounced stench.  I have always smelled it on the trail just north of Bearfence Mountain Hut in Shenandoah and being cautious, continued up to Lewis Mountain Campground for the night.  I’ll have Rocky Raccoon to protect me this year.  My favorite black bears to see are the yearlings.  Cubs are born in January while the mother is denning and stay with her through the second winter, until she is ready to mate again.  By then they weigh 50-80 pounds, about the size of a Labrador Retriever.   If they have learned their lessons well from Momma, they will be fine, but temperamentally, they are like teenagers with a propensity for poor judgement.  Another Fall, also in Shenandoah, I was tented above one of the shelters, called huts in the park.  In the morning, I got out of my tent to pee.  It must have been a weekend, because I could smell bacon frying below.  My thoughts were locked into a loop of, “Bacon, bacon.” Not 20 yards from me was a yearling, standing, catching the scent, also thinking, “Bacon, bacon!”  He ran when he saw me and I spotted him later crossing the trail.  
I have great fondness and respect for black bears, and indeed for all of the wildlife along the Appalachian Trail, and try to follow good hiker etiquette.   You don’t need to bring a hostess gift when you visit the trail.  Instead commit to carrying out a little litter that you didn’t create.",,View Entry,"Jun 17, Thu",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639437,"Two months to go, and I’m feeling a mixture of emotions.  Anticipation and excitement predominate, but there’s also self-doubt.  Will I be strong enough physically?  Will my new knees be able to cope with hiking day-after-day-after-day?  Will another body part shout at me to act my age?  Snakes, bears, and even ticks don’t scare me, and I’ve worked to improve my balance to minimize falls.  There’s a part of me that feels like I’m running away, leaving my husband Tom home alone.  He couldn’t be more supportive, but still, there’s guilt.  When I hike the northern half of the trail next year, it will be easy to come home a couple of times.  Direct Amtrak service between New York City and Burlington should start by the end of the year when the Ethan Allen Express is extended up from Rutland.  The station is conveniently at the bottom of the hill we live on.   Killington, Vermont and Hanover, New Hampshire are just 90-minute drives.  That doesn’t work on the southern half of the Appalachian Trail.  It’s possible to catch Amtrak from as far south as Blacksburg, VA, near Pearisburg, but it’s far from convenient, involving shuttles, transfers, and overnight stays.  Flights from Roanoke, Tricities, or Asheville are expensive and require shuttles to and from the Trail.  It just isn’t practicable, a word CPAs like a lot.  Tom and I have been together for what will 45 years when I leave in August, and this will be our longest separation.  All together now, “Awwww!”     
My gear is mostly ready to go.  When I assembled everything in advance of last week’s Camels Hump hike, I found that I had lost a couple of USB adapters and will have to replace them.  My wall charger uses USB-C but most of my charging cables are USB-A.  My external battery takes USB-C for charging itself but its output is USB-A.  The adapters are about the size of Chiclets and easily misplaced.  I’ll discipline myself to leave them attached to the cables or ports in the future.  
I had my annual physical exam in March and my dental checkup last month.  I have my haircuts scheduled, including one the morning I leave for my cousin Debbie’s house on August 16.  I’ll need to buy food for the first leg of the hike and a full gas canister, but that’s about it.  
I continue my workouts, walks, and an occasional hike, and I feel ready.  I could stand to lose a few pounds, but the trail will see to that so I’m not highly motivated.  Debbie is doing awesome in her preparation.  Yesterday, she hiked 12 miles in Moreau Lake State Park in New York, rewarding her with the view above.  
I am so fortunate to have Cousin Debbie in my life.  When I first saw Leave It to Beaver in 1957, I was sure that Ward and June were my real parents and that somewhere I had a brother like Wally.  There was nothing wrong with my parents and I had two brothers, but I never felt like I truly belonged.  So it’s been wonderful to finally have a relative i actually like!  She’s not a Beaver but a Raccoon.  Debbie joined me at the start of my 2018 thru-hike attempt, for the section from Harpers Ferry to Boiling Springs, Pennsylvania.  She earned her trail name Rocky Raccoon on the second day, with a face plant that left her with two black eyes.  They were bad enough to send a small boy screaming back to his mother in the Walmart in Rouzerville, PA where we resupplied.  From tentative hiker, she’s morphed into a hiking animal in three years.  I’m worried about keeping up with her.",,View Entry,"Jun 18, Fri",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639588,"If you were solo hiking in wilderness, there would be no need for the seventh Leave-No-Trace principle, Be Considerate of Other Visitors.  You would also not be on the Appalachian Trail.  As recently as a decade or so ago, hiking the AT “out of season” meant that you were practically alone except on the weekends and when you visited towns to resupply.  About 15 years ago, I enjoyed a splendid late Fall hike, from Rockfish Gap (the south end of Shenandoah National Park) to Damascus, in Southwest Virginia, about 4 miles from the Tennessee border.  There was dense fog most of the time, so the Blue Ridge Parkway was closed to traffic, creating an even greater illusion of wilderness.  I would go days without seeing anyone else and found myself not only talking to trees but listening to them.  I would have to hike this section in winter today to find similar solitude.  That’s okay.  There are other more remote trails where a hiker can be alone in the woods, but the Appalachian Trail is a social trail.  Hikers need to find ways to get along with each other.
In these times, the best way of showing consideration for other hikers and townspeople is to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19.  If you don’t believe in evidence-based medicine, modern science, or think that Covid must be a hoax because you can’t see it, please stay away from me.  I’m not worried about your infecting me with the coronavirus since I am fully vaccinated, but I find your beliefs toxic and possibly a danger to those on the trail or in trail communities with compromised immune systems or allergies who cannot be vaccinated.  Do it for them, if not for yourself and your family.   
Even though solitude is rare on the Appalachian Trail today, you can still nurture the illusion of wilderness.  Speak softly, use earbuds or headphones, step away from the shelter to use your cellphone as a phone, and avoid bright colors and patterns.  Please smoke or vape outside the shelter, or at least ask if anyone minds.  Know trail right-of-way rules:  Everyone yields to horses; cyclists yield to hikers; downhill hikers yield to uphill hikers.  Yes, the Appalachian Trail is a footpath only, but there are sections in the Smokies and Pennsylvania where horses are allowed, for historic reasons.  The Appalachian Trail follows the Chesapeake & Ohio Canal towpath for about four miles.  That’s open to cyclists as well as to hikers from Cumberland, Maryland to Georgetown in the District of Columbia.   Combined with the Great Allegheny Passage rails-to-trail from Pittsburgh to Cumberland, it’s a lovely 318 mile ride! 
Hikers are wonderfully community-minded and will go out of their way to help each other, but you can nurture your independence by being prepared (LNT Principle #1) and not having to ask to borrow a water filter, lighter, or headlamp.  Carry maps, GPS, or a cellphone with an appropriate app so you don’t have disturb others by asking where the next water source is or how far it is the next shelter.  Allow others their privacy.  There’s an old saying among AT hikers: Hike Your Own Hike.  My 2018 trail family (tramily) modified it slightly:  Hike Your Own Hike; Carry Your Own S%#t.  
This is not part of Leave-No-Trace, but showing consideration extends not only to trail visitors but also to local communities.  Just by virtue of being near the trail, a town owes you nothing.  Hikers are often unkempt, unclean, and smell bad.  There are even a few hikers each year who brag about how many hundreds of miles it’s been since they last showered.  The Appalachian Trail Conservancy has worked hard to build relationships between towns and the trail, helping the towns to realize the economic benefits of ecotourism.  In many cases the trail has been integrated into local school curriculum through programs like the Trail to Every Classroom Program developed by the National Park Service and ATC.  Over 50 towns have earned the designation of Appalachian Trail Community.  It has made a huge difference in the hiker experience.  I’ll offer two examples.
When I was preparing for my first solo AT hike in 1994, I phoned Jean Cashin at Appalachian Trail Conference headquarters.  Jean was the first ATC trail mom, preceding Laurie Potteiger who just retired.  Jean cautioned me about solo hiking near Roan Mountain, Tennessee, especially on either side of U.S. 19E.  There had been reports of fishing line strung across the trail with fish hooks hung at eye level.  Jean felt so strongly about it that she sent me copies of pages from the AT Data Book with dangerous areas highlighted in yellow.  Today Roan Mountain is an AT Community and holds a hiker festival in early May.  Several hostels, bed & breakfasts, restaurants and a brewery compete for hiker dollars!  Overnight parking at the U.S. 19E trailhead is still not recommended.
Front Royal, Virginia, the gateway to Shenandoah National Park, was unfriendly to pedestrians in 1997 on my first visit.  I actually had a car switch lanes just to scare me as I crossed the multilane highway in front of the motel.  Today Front Royal is an AT Community and treats hikers “royally.”  Sidewalks and crosswalks have been constructed. There is a wide range of lodging ranging from excellent bed & breakfasts to hostels and motels.  A full service outfitter has opened. A new local brewing company sponsors Basecamp, offering free showers, laundry, caged lockers, and a boot dryer to hikers!  The town offers trolley service from the trailhead into town from April 15 through July.  
Consider yourself a trail ambassador when you visit a trail community.  I put on my cleaner clothing and try to rinse off or at least run my fingers through my hair before hitching into town.  Instead of feeling entitled to service, try saying please and thank you for everything.  
They are magic words, and especially if combined with eye contact, the keys to building social bonds with complete strangers.  Compliment people on their town, even if you have to work hard to find something you sincerely like about it.  If I take a zero day in a town, I try to discover why the town exists by visiting the library or the historical society.  Showing an interest in the town will win you friends and possibly a dinner invitation!",,View Entry,"Jun 20, Sun",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639699,"It took me a month to plow through the seven Leave-No-Trace principles.  I wish there were more so I would have something to write about.  It’s like cooking.  The grocery shopping and the actual cooking part is easy.  It’s the deciding what to fix that’s the tough part.  So, dear readers, who are mostly unknown to me, I want to ask for your help.  What shall I write about?
A few of you have signed my guest book, and I’m thankful for that, especially for Kimono of Fort Wayne, Indiana.  It’s one thing when your friends say nice things about your writing — they have to — but quite another when a stranger not only praises you but goes back and reads your previous journals!  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  The pre-hike entries in particular are not easy to write, and I’m sure, not easy to read.  I promise that when I finally start hiking, the entries will be shorter and more to the point.  I won’t be giving you typical entries, telling you what I ate for breakfast, what the trail was like (it always goes up, you know), and how many times I mistook tree trunks for bears and sticks for snakes.  What I will do is to try and share something unusual about the day and especially something that left me feeling grateful.  I’m borrowing the latter from a 2018 thru-hiker, Hungry Cat, who ended each of his TrailJournal entries with an expression of gratitude.   We were actually following each other’s journal and met on the trail outside of Unionville, NY, when he blew past me.   
I’ll have Rocky Raccoon to keep me company for the first couple of weeks of my hike, but then I expect to be alone a lot.  Southbound thru-hikers and flip-floppers, who started northbound in April and then returned to their starting point and hike southbound, will run past me.  Trying to hike at someone else’s pace is to court injury, not to mention exhaustion.  So I’m not expecting to have a trail family this year.  The people I see at the shelters and campsites at night will mostly be strangers to me.  In some ways, it’s harder to be alone surrounded by people than to be solitary.  Sometimes I’ve met people at a shelter who I’ve really enjoyed, but we were hiking in opposite directions.  
In the mid-2000’s, I met a young man at Velvet Rocks Shelter just a mile-and-a-half north of Hanover, New Hampshire.  He was majoring in business in college and was contemplating changing to music.  He found that what he missed the most on the trail was his piano.  I suggested that he might gain access to a practice room at Dartmouth the next day.  I had a little Walkman, and a Claudio Monteverdi Marian Vespers was playing on the classical station.  He was transfixed.  The concept of polyphony was new to him.  It helped that he was carrying an excellent boutique bourbon and I was only too willing to help him reduce his pack weight.  I’ll never know what he decided, because he was hiking south and I was hiking north.  I spent the next week inventing a backstory for him. I don’t listen to music, audio books or podcasts as I hike, so my mind is free to take strange directions.
In 2018, I invited suggestions for ebooks to download for my hike.  I took many of your suggestions, and because I had quoted the first sentence of Leo Tolstoy’s Anna Karenina in my journal, I felt obligated to read it.  It is a personal failing, but I really don’t enjoy reading Tolstoy.  I struggled through War and Peace and admittedly skipped many of the battle scenes. That tome, however, has a valued spot on my bookshelf since it is the perfect weight for pressing salted eggplant slices between paper towels.  For this hike, I’ve downloaded Fyodor Dostoevsky’s Brothers Karamazov, (Pevear and Voloknohnsky translation).  Brothers is an old friend.  I read it my first year at college for a seminar called Belief and Unbelief, taught by a Death-of-God theologian.  I return to it periodically.  Are you surprised that Alyosha is my favorite character?  At 4,649 e-pages in length, it will keep me occupied for many trail miles.  I really look forward to reading a chapter and then having time to chew on it as I hike.  Hermann Hesse’s Narcissus and Goldmund seems like an appropriate hiking book as well, since Goldmund is always going off on long walks of self-discovery. With each reading, I alternate which protagonist I identify with, but that’s okay, since they are the Apollonian and Dionysian archetypes of a single personality, perhaps.  Odd how those words keep cropping up when I recall my time at college. 
So, dear readers, please use my guest book to suggest topics or questions that I can write about over the next two months.  Otherwise, I’ll periodically blather about whatever comes to mind until it’s time to leave for the trail!",,View Entry,"Jun 22, Tue",0

I mentioned Bill Bryson and his 1998 semi-autobiographical novel, A Walk in the Woods, in my “Poop and Such” entry.  In Chapter Six, Bill discusses Rainbow Springs Campground on the Old Murphy Road outside of Franklin, North Carolina and its owners Buddy and Jensine Crossman in less than flattering light.  The bunkhouse where Bill and his “boon companion” Katz took refuge from a snowstorm is described as “basic and awesomely unlovely,” and the available food, particularly the Philly cheese steak sandwich, as likely to result in food poisoning.  Those were some of his nicer comments.  
In 1994, I ended my first solo AT hike at Rainbow Springs Campground.  I was welcomed by a young man who had hiked in and never hiked out, who did odd jobs, cleaning, and maintenance for the Crossmans in exchange for room and board and, I suppose, a little pin money.  He took a liking to me (there’s no accounting for taste), and introduced me to Jensine.  I rented a small cabin for the night, and Jensine made sure it had towels and even toilet paper.  There was a crockpot filled with chili in the office that tempted me, but Jensine warned me off of it and instead sold me a loaf of bread, eggs, and bacon.  She even offered me a fishing rod if I wanted to try my luck for a trout and offered to do my laundry.  Jensine let me use her phone to call a friend who lived in nearby Cullowhee, who picked me up the next morning.  The young man took me on a wildflower walk, and I’m grateful to him for teaching me the name of Silene virginica (Fire pink) that I had been admiring since Springer Mountain.  Thank goodness, I stayed there before Bill’s book was published, or I might have missed a wonderful experience.  Buddy and Jensine sold the campground in 2002, and it has since closed.
In fairness to Bill Bryson, he could be kind at times.  On their fourth night, Bill and Katz meet Mary Ellen, “a plumpish, bespectacled young woman in a red jacket,” who “talked nonstop, except when she was clearing out her eustachian tubes … with a series of violent and alarming snorts …”  She criticized every gear decision they had made and proved to be a worse trail companion than even Katz.  It took several days before Bill and Katz awoke early and hiked a prodigious distance to ditch her.  
I met the real Mary Ellen at Hexacuba Shelter in New Hampshire in 2000.  I spent a night alone with her, mostly pretending to be asleep cowering against the side of this weirdly hexagonal shelter, trying not to listen to her nonstop patter and snorts.  Aside from having opinions, often self-contradictory, about nearly everything, Mary Ellen also spoke in malapropisms. She even snorted in her sleep.  I slunk out by dawn’s early light and made good my escape after just the one night, and never felt a twinge of guilt, something Bill confessed to.  On the other hand, perhaps you would enjoy hiking with Mary Ellen.  More power to you.  
I’ve mentioned Front Royal, Virginia a couple of times.  I’m in a real quandary trying to decide where to stay this time.  The Quality Inn, rebranded as Baymont Hotel, has always been pleasant and very convenient.  The attached Thai restaurant had an excellent crispy duck with crispy basil, and I’m curious to find out if the old man is still offering shuttles back to the trail in his red pickup truck.  Can he possibly still be driving, let alone be alive?  Woodward House on Manor Grade is a delightful bed & breakfast, the breakfast being the best of my life, making it very hard to hike uphill into Shenandoah National Park.  Innkeepers Joan and Bob were caring without being doting, and Bob kept his pub stocked with fresh local draft beer, complimentary for guests!  I enjoyed a fine dinner at nearby Element, starting with a Hendricks martini and an exceptional Caesar salad with polenta croutons and olive tapenade before moving onto a nice local wine and a pan-roasted chicken.  I digested it sitting in a rocking chair on the B&B porch, with a hen roosting on my lap.  Then there’s the new kid on the block, Mountain Home B&B adjacent to the trailhead.  The owners Scott and Lisa have restored the antebellum house as their residence and a B&B.   They have converted the slave quarters into an excellent hostel (no cats, if If I recall).  Lisa comes down from the Big House to prepare breakfast at the hostel.  
Continuing down the trail, I have always enjoyed staying at the Skyland Resort in Shenandoah National Park.  I particularly recommend taking a room in Pinnacles, which is nearest to the dining room and taproom.  I’ve enjoyed their pan-seared rainbow trout and how can you pass up mountain blackberry ice cream pie?  I also recommend staying at Lewis Mountain Campground, either tenting or in a cabin.  Back in the days of Jim Crow, Lewis Mountain was the park’s “Negro” campground and was reputed to have the best dining room and weekend dances!  Alas, there is only a small camp store now and microwaved foods, but the staff is very friendly.  Showers and a coin laundry are available.
My favorite lodging on the southern half of the trail is Wood’s Hole Hostel and B&B, with host Neville, just south of Pearisburg, Virginia.  Guests are expected to assist in the preparation of the meals and to do a chore or two, which some find offensive (why should paying guests be expected to work?), but I find magical.  To keep the place going, Neville has many rules and expects them to be followed.  It’s a place where I instantly feel at peace, and I plan a zero day there this year.  It brings back my best memories of the 1960’s and 70’s, of communal living, without any drugs.
One of my favorite spots on the Appalachian Trail is Max Patch, a 4,629 foot grassy knoll surrounded by 6,000 footers, including Mt. Mitchell to the east, the highest peak in the eastern U.S., and Mt. LeConte to the southwest. It’s about midway between Great Smoky Mountains National Park and Hot Springs, North Carolina.  I’ve always had perfect weather there, blue skies with puffy clouds, gentle breeze, and mild temperatures, once a playful Labrador retriever, and there have always been picnickers anxious to feed me.  
The average cost of hiking the Appalachian Trail is $1,000 per month.  You would be correct in assuming that my cost is higher, but that’s my choice.  I enjoy All-You-Can-Eat (AYCE) restaurants (Ming Garden in Waynesboro, Virginia is not to be missed!) as much as any hiker, but I also enjoy fine dining and exploring local cuisine.  Many of my favorite trail memories involve food and drink.  That’s just me and why I’m hesitant to recommend one place over another.  I’ve hiked with people for whom any horizontal surface suffices for a bed, one in particular who can fall asleep instantly anywhere and not be awakened by trains passing just outside the window of the hostel blowing their horns.  I’ve hiked with people for whom food is sustenance and nothing more.  Their food recommendations are based on price and quantity, because that’s what’s important to them. 
So, I guess Kimono, my suggestion would be to read the user comments in Guthook, keeping in mind that there are disgruntled consumers everywhere.  There are new hostels and restaurants opening all the time along the trail, and hiker word-of-mouth might be your best guide.  Chat up a hiker going the opposite direction.  Ask about their town experience.  If cats are a big deal for you, text or email the hostel and ask.  If you phone, try to avoid calling before 10 or after 4, when the hosts are apt to be most busy with current guests!   
I’ll try not to salivate in my next entry and provide some real tips that might be useful for someone.  This has been a wonderful week for me, with two day hikes, and I’ve managed to increase weights at the Y, even on legs.  My knees are loose and limber and raring to go!  I wrote a thank you note to my orthopedic surgeon yesterday because my knees so far exceed my expectations!  I realize that could all change in a flash or in a fall, but it’s an awfully nice way to start a hike, and I am grateful.",,View Entry,"Jun 26, Sat",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640128,"The Appalachian Trail is measured in miles, kilometers, leagues but mostly in feet.  It’s 2,193.1 miles long, 3,529.4 kilometers long, and about 731 leagues, depending on who is defining the length of a league.  In feet, the Appalachian Trail is measured in blisters, calluses, blackened and lost toenails, ingrown toenails, numb big toes, myriad types of socks, lotions, cremes and anti-friction gels, arch supports, and several pairs of shoes.  
There are few things that will make a hiker more miserable than foot pain caused by the litany of ailments above.  Sure, the pain of chaffing between the legs — creatively called jock itch, crotch rot or monkey butt — may have you walking bowlegged like a cowboy, but it is relatively easy to deal with.   So let’s start with it.
CROTCHES
What causes chafing between the thighs or buttocks, especially in the early stages of a hike, before you’ve lost weight?  It is a combination of moisture and friction.  Eliminate one or the other, and you will have a happy butt.  Eliminating moisture isn’t easy because even in cold weather, hiking means sweating, but you can stop moisture from being held against your skin.  Hiker Tip: Don’t wear cotton underwear!  
Cotton is slow to dry, tending to dry from the outside in, assuring clammy skin for a long time.  A better choice is underwear and clothing made from synthetic wicking fiber or wool.  Wool, ideally super soft Marino wool, is naturally odor resistant and dries from the inside out. Many synthetic wicking fibers designed for hiking incorporate silver ions or other technologies and are also odor resistant.  Clothing woven from the original polypropylene was notorious for trapping odor that could not be removed by even prolonged exposure to sunshine or boiling, or anything short of staking them in a crossroad, The new fibers really do work, never seeming to smell, and wash out easily.  They are expensive, but can you really put a price on a happy crotch?  
Alternatively you can simply wear loose-fitting clothes and forego underwear altogether.  Sarongs and sundresses are perfectly acceptable attire for all genders.  I wore a Mountain Hardwear hiking kilt for a couple of years.  There was always a breeze down there and everything stayed dry.  Gentlemen, if you are going to wear a kilt, invest some time in learning how to sit with your knees together or press down the fabric between your legs when you sit. It’s not view that many will appreciate.  The Mountain Hardwear kilt included a snap between the legs for modest sitting, but it never held for long.  A hike on the Cohutta River Trail in Georgia through the gorge where Deliverance was filmed convinced me to retire the kilt.  Banjos and pig squeals were not involved.  
A third way to stay dry and fresh is to use one of various talcum powders, some medicated.  Long-term exposure to talcum powder has been associated with asthma, pneumonia, lung cancer, and at least in the courts, ovarian cancer.  This is not my preferred method.
There are at least two ways to minimize friction.  Stick balms like Body Glide and Goldbond Friction Defense work great.  Synthetic wicking boxer briefs that come down far enough on the legs also work well.  My current favorite hiking shorts are made by Patagonia and have a built-in Spandex boxer brief.  I rinse them out at the end of the hiking day and switch to a lightweight pair of liner-less running shorts in camp so things can air.  Spandex bicycle shorts, without or without a butt pad, also work.  
Whatever precautions you take, you probably will occasionally experience chafing, presenting itself as redness, blister-like lesions, a flat rash, and itching and burning.  The broken skin combined with moisture and heat sets up ideal conditions for an opportunistic fungal infection like Tinea cruris, the familiar jock itch, crotch rot and monkey butt.  In 1998, I started my hike in Harpers Ferry and headed north.  Several days later, I walked bowlegged into a small family pharmacy in Blue Ridge Summit, Pennsylvania, just across the Mason Dixon Line.  The pharmacist asked, “Have you been hiking?” and without waiting for me to answer directed me to a generic 1% Clotrimazole cream, the same as Lotrimin.  It cured me overnight, and I’ve carried a small tube of it in my first aid kit ever since.  
FEET
Feet are a lot like crotches, at least in detesting moisture and friction, except that the result with feet is blisters instead of chaffing.  I’ll start with shoe selection and save the gross parts for later. 
Polonius in Hamlet did not say, “To thine own feet be true,” but had his son Leartes been a prospective thru-hiker, it would have been very good advice, far better than anything I can offer.  How many times have I been asked,”What are the best shoes for backpacking?”  It all depends on your feet, which Lord willing, are different from mine.  My feet are narrow, especially the heels, low-volume (a polite way of saying flat), and my second toe is longer than my big toe. Do you really want to wear shoes that would make my feet happy?  Find a local outfitter with a reputation for fitting shoes.  Take comfort in knowing that after hours of trying on shoes and fearing being crushed by the teetering stacks of rejected shoe boxes you will find the perfect fit.  By the way, whichever shoe you select will soon be discontinued, and you will have to do it all over again.  
I detest shoes.  Until I started hiking, my feet were A width with a double-A heel.  This was back before online shopping.  Buying shoes meant visiting a local shoe store.  Most people would look at the displayed shoes and ask the salesperson to show them their selection in their size, with good confidence that it would be in stock.  I would go in and ask, “Do you have anything in a 9A?”  Chances are they didn’t, but would offer to order them for me in the one model offered in narrow widths, usually a particularly hideous wingtip.  Or they would suggest that I wear thick socks and offer to show me special lacing techniques.  Hiking and the advent of online shoe vendors like Zappos have banished most of my shoe-buying nightmares.  Like most hikers, my feet have grown both in the length and width.  In a dress shoe I now take a 10 Medium, but I haven’t worn a dress shoe since retirement.  In sports shoes, I wear 10-1/2 Medium. I still can’t keep Crocs on my feet, but that suits my aesthetic sensibility anyway.  
What are some of the considerations in deciding on a shoe for backpacking and how do you recognize a good fit?  Start by not visiting the outfitter until the afternoon, preferably after walking a couple of miles, so your feet are somewhat swollen.  Wear the socks you intend to hike in.  In general, the less weight you carry, the less constructed of a shoe you will need.  The most popular shoes among thru-hikers now seem to be running shoes or light weight hiking shoes.  The legendary Grandma Gatewood, the first woman to thru-hike the Appalachian Trail, wore Keds.  Two sisters, Isis and Jackrabbit, thru-hiked twice as the Barefoot Sisters.  Watching them on steep rock was amazing, as their toes ferreted out the seams.  I prefer a low-cut hiking shoe with some torsional rigidity and a sole that grips wet rock.  My current favorite is the Scarpa Zen Pro, which is described as an approach shoe with a rugged sole that looks identical to Vibram XS Trek.  For three-season use, I prefer shoes that do not have waterproof-breathable membranes.  The membranes work well in terms of keeping water out, but they are slow to dry.  Wet feet are more prone to blisters, so I want a shoe that gets wet quickly and dries quickly.   
When I carried in excess of 40 or 45 pounds, I felt like I needed more rugged boots, but now that I only rarely exceed 25 pounds, I am happier with a lighter, lower shoe.  My ankles are very flexible so I don’t mind if they twist occasionally.  I take it as a signal that I ought to take a break.  Hiking shoes should feel good right out of the box, and any break-in should be minimal.  Unlaced, they should still pocket the heel without significant slippage, and there should be room for the toes to wriggle.  Most outfitters have a ramp.  Walking downhill, your feet should not slide forward in the shoe.  When no one is looking, kick the wall and make sure your toes are not impacted.  The tongues of my shoes tend to migrate toward the outside, so I look for a tongue loop in the middle to limit its slide.  
Insoles are controversial and highly personal.  If your feet don’t get tired walking, you probably don’t need to change out the insoles that come with the shoes.  I personally replace them with Green Superfeet, which are touted for high arches but work perfectly for my low arches.  My feet simply do not get tired when I wear them.  Trim the insoles to match the originals.  I find that a pair of Green Superfeet outlasts several pairs of shoes.  
The most popular socks on the Trail are Darn Tough, made here in Vermont, and come with a lifetime guarantee that is honored by some outfitters.  My preference is FITS Light Hikers, crew length, made from 65% Merino Wool, 27% Nylon, 6% Polyester, and 2% Lycra, and made in Tennessee.  Worn for several days, even when wet, they hold their shape and never bunch around the toes.  There is no seam above the toes to cause blisters.   They were recommended to me by a U.S. Army Ranger who should know something about carrying a heavy pack over long distances. It may be the lanolin in the Merino Wool, but these socks are always slightly slippery, especially since I rub an anti-friction product like Body Glide or Gold Bond Friction Defense on my feet each morning.  Minimizing friction prevents blisters.  Also on wet days, these products seem to protect my feet from pruning too badly.   I bring three pair, saving the last for the hike into town.  Sometimes if they get particularly gross, I’ll wash them out with a little camp soap in a ZipLock, and dry them on the front of my pack, hanging from stainless steel diaper pins.
Some hikers wear lightweight liner socks under their socks, especially the Injinji brand that has separate compartments for each toe, like a foot glove.  If you are prone to blisters, it may be worth a try!  
Regardless of the fit of your shoe and your choice or insole and socks, you may occasionally develop a foot blister.  The standard medical advice is not to puncture a blister unless it is large, painful, or likely to be further irritated — like by continuing with the activity that caused it in the first place, hiking.  So in most cases, if the blister doesn’t spontaneously burst, wash your hands, clean the blister with soap and water, if available, cleanse it with an alcohol pad, and then puncture it and express the liquid.  I carry a couple of sewing needles in my first aid kit along with a mini-lighter for this purpose.  I use a short length of a cocktail straw to hold the needles, closed with freezer tape, and also use the straw as a bobbin for a little thread.  I apply some antibiotic ointment and cover the blister with either a Compeed blister pad or with a waterproof bandage.  Since neither of these stick particularly well to sweaty feet, I often cover the bandage with a piece of duct tape, which sticks to anything.  Many hikers prefer Leukotape, but Leukotape contains latex, one of my allergies.  I met a hiker several years ago whose trail name was Silver Toes, because each of her toes had blistered and was wrapped in duct tape!  I haven’t had a blister since switching to FITS socks (knock on wood), but especially when I wore leather boots, I would occasionally have a blister on my heel or the ball of my foot bad enough to compel me to take a day or two off for healing.  
Trail detritus getting into your shoe, like a small piece of gravel or a piece of a twig, can be enough to cause a blister.  If you feel something, or just a hot spot on your feet, don’t ignore it.  Sit down, take your shoes off and maybe your socks, and deal with the issue before it blossoms into a blister.  I wear light gaiters that hook onto my front laces and Vecro to the back of my shoe to keep trail crud out of my shoes.  Dirty Girl Gaiters, aside from having a wonderful name, work very well and can be found at some the better outfitters along the Appalachian Trail or online.  
Another common foot ailment is numb toes, particularly the big toe, caused by compression of a nerve.  I was usually unaware of this on the trail, but as the nerve recovers after the hike, I have a tingling sensation.  This happened to me with boots and less flexible shoes.  Needless to say, blisters and peripheral neuropathy may be symptoms of a disease other than hiking, such as diabetes.  Also a blister that shows signs of infection should be treated by a medical professional.  Most trail towns have medical clinics.  Stress fractures are another possibility!  I am forever having toenails blacken and eventually fall off.  It doesn’t hurt and so far there has always been a nice new nail underneath.  It usually happens to my long second toe, after I have stupidly kicked something.  
Even though lightweight hiking shoes don’t need to be broken in, your feet need to get used to them and you need to discover how tightly to lace them.  I personally wear trail shoes whenever I go outside, except in winter, and moccasins indoors.  When I go on the trail, my toes are already calloused and ready for greater abuse.  
Some long-distance hikers will buy several pairs of shoes in advance, planning to have them sent to them as needed.  With light shoes, this is usually about 400 to 600 trail miles.  If you are not accustomed to hiking long distances, you may find that your feet grow and you are left with several pairs of shoes that are now too small.  Fortunately for me, my feet stopped growing after my first few long hikes.  Otherwise I would need clown shoes.  I order one extra pair to hold in reserve.  If Zappos is out of my size, they can be mailed to me.  
A final foot topic is camp shoes.  I have gone without them at times, to reduce my pack weight, but I always regret it.  I like being able to slip them on if I need them at night or in camp or around town.  I have an old pair of Vivo Barefoot runners that I stripped of the insoles and tongues.  The pair weighs 7.2 ounces.  I can transfer my Superfeet insoles into them for zero days in town or if the campsite is graveled.  Caution:  Almost universally the weight of shoes listed on websites is that of a single shoe!  
I’ve shared with you what I’ve learned about keeping my feet happy.  It has taken me decades to find an optimal solution for my misshapen feet.  If you are new to hiking and considering a thru-hike, you don’t have decades to prepare.  I’ll close with something for you.  
First, keep your pack weight as low as you can, without endangering yourself, considering the balance between comfort on the trail and comfort in camp.  It’s normal to start with more than you need.  If you start at Springer Mountain, you’ll have a great opportunity to reevaluate at Neels Gap, and the good folks at Mountain Crossings Outfitter will be glad to make suggestions and mail home your excess stuff.  If you start at Katahdin, God bless you.  At least, don’t carry your pack up Katahdin. Take advantage of the day packs available at the ranger station at Katahdin Stream Campground.  If you flip-flop, there are plenty of outfitters in the first few weeks.  Budget to replace things that don’t work for you rather than suffering with gear or shoes that you curse with each step. 
Second, don’t buy hiking shoes that are not comfortable out of the box.  Buy them well in advance of your hike and wear them everywhere.  If they don’t make your feet happy around town during your regular walks and day hikes,  they won’t make you happy on the trail. Experiment with lacing pressure. If the first pair doesn’t work for you, try again. Plan on wearing out a pair before you even step foot on the trail!  
Third, stop and treat any hot spots or to empty trail detritus out of your shoes.  It’s a good idea to shake out your shoes each morning anyway, especially down south.  A scorpion could have taken up residence, or a mouse could have decided that your shoe makes the perfect nesting site.  Your objective should be to prevent blisters instead of treating them.  
Finally, don’t hesitate to take a day or two off, to rest your feet and your entire body.  You will find a rhythm that works for you.  I find that I need a zero day about every two weeks to prevent a downward spiral in my strength.  And I need a town visit, even a quick in and out every five or six days, to eat real food, including plenty of fruit and vegetables in addition to pizza.  The trail isn’t going anywhere and will patiently wait for you.  Good luck!",,View Entry,"Jul 01, Thu",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640366,"The Fourth of July, Independence Day, always leaves me with mixed feelings.  Sure, I enjoy the fireworks, traditionally on July 3rd in Burlington, so our celebration doesn’t detract from the July 4th festivities of smaller surrounding towns.  Our condo on the side of the hill is at eye level with the bursts, so we watch them from the comfort of our balcony or living room, gin and tonic in hand, missing only the ooh’s and aah’s of the crowd.  I think of past 4th’s and 3rd’s with pleasure, like in 2018 hosting Willow on a break from her AT thru-hike.  One of my AT hikes found me in Manchester Center, Vermont on the 4th at the Dana L. Thompson Memorial Park, stuffing myself with fried foods from the vendors ringing the park, and lying back on the grass in awe of the fireworks echoing off Equinox and Bromley Mountains.  I hadn’t planned to go into town, but I had taken a bad fall and feared a possible concussion. In case I didn’t wake up the next morning, I wanted to be in town.  When I hiked the Long Trail, I watched Bennington’s fireworks from above, definitely a different perspective.   As a lifelong pacifist, however, I’m always bothered remembering what the fireworks represent, bombs bursting in air and all of that.  I’m not a Quaker, but their peace testimony resonates deeply with me.  I remember being ostracized at an Episcopal Peace Fellowship meeting in Philadelphia in 1973 because I wasn’t against the War in Vietnam.  I was against war, period, and they wanted no part of that.  
While at the Y on Friday morning, I heard the annual reading of the Declaration of Independence by the staff of National Public Radio.  “All men are created equal,” it says, but there should have been a footnote excluding women, enslaved people and native Americans, the latter of whom are singled out for especial approbation as “merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions,” not unlike the massacre of nearly 300 Lakota people by the U.S. Army at the Battle of Wounded Knee in 1890, including over 100 women and children.  I think of Frederick Douglass’ 1852 Fourth of July Oration.  I reflect on these things and ask myself if this really is my country.  Do I have a true and native land somewhere, where there are others like me?
I think about this type of thing as I hike.  I seldom wear earbuds to distract me from myself.  There are parts of the Appalachian Trail, like much of New Hampshire, Maine, and Dragon’s Tooth in Virginia, that demand concentration, but for the most part, my feet are on autopilot and my head is only loosely tethered to the rest of me.  This is why I hike parts of the AT repeatedly, because I don’t have to think about the hiking and can let my mind drift off to lands unknown. Now that my knees are no longer hurting (Thank you, Dr. Nick!), I’m hoping I can return to hiking in my personal cloud of unknowing.    
I enjoy the endless vistas that come from being above treeline, but it makes me feel exposed and vulnerable.  I much prefer being surrounded by trees, Longfellow’s forest primeval.  Hemlocks are my favorite tree, my totem tree perhaps, and it greatly saddens me to see them dying from the Woolly Adelgid.  My totem bird is the screech owl.  Both Hemlock and Owl were rewarded for staying awake through the days of Creation.  Hemlock got to keep leaves year round, and Owl got to see and hunt at night.  I am decidedly not a creature of the night.  I rise and set with the sun, but nothing pleases me more than to be surrounded by hemlocks at night and to sense the pressure waves of an owl’s silent flight.  The Appalachian Trail provides ample opportunity to indulge my fantasy.  
Being alone in the woods, especially at night, terrifies a lot of people, but ever since I was a little kid in Baltimore County, Maryland, that’s where I felt safe.  I was invisible there, and THEY couldn’t get to me.  I knew where the first jack-in-the-pulpit bloomed each spring and where there was a perfect boy-sized tree hollow.  I was a loner, happiest when I had one best friend, and was easily overwhelmed by noise and crowds.  Am I describing myself back then or today?   I wasn’t bullied much, and in thinking back on it, I don’t know why I wasn’t.  Perhaps I was too pathetic to bother with.  I didn’t think of myself as lesser, just different.  This was the 1950’s and conformity was prized above all.  For those of us who were different in any way, it was a suffocating, crushing time.  This was the age of Dwight D. Eisenhower and Joseph McCarthy.  Communists were hiding behind every light pole.  I remember the “duck and cover” drills in junior high school and practicing to see how fast we could run home, to be incinerated with our families.  That was during the Cuban Missile Crisis in Tampa, Florida, home to a major Strategic Air Command base within range of the deployed Russian missiles.  
My first crush was a TV cowboy named Sugarfoot.  I was six years old.  I had no concept of gay or straight.  There can be no conception without language, and I had none for the attraction I felt.  I had heard about Queers and Homos, who were said to lurk in bus station bathrooms, but I had no idea what they did, only that they were BAD.  I wasn’t bad, so that couldn’t be me.  I knew better than to talk about it and figured that one day I would wake up and be like everyone else.  The Stonewall Uprising didn’t happen until June 1969, after my first year of college, and the notion of gay rights and gay marriage was still distant.  To be gay meant ether to be deeply closeted or to accept life on the fringes of society.  I took refuge in the laboratory and was headed toward a career in academia.  I had some early successes, but rather than inspiring me, they opened me to asking questions that were not scientific in nature.  Soon I was reading more theology than science.  It came to a head my last year of college when I was nominated for a major fellowship and declined to apply for it.  It didn’t know what I wanted to be when I grew up, but I knew that science was not where I would find out.  When I finally came out at the end of that year, things started to make sense to me.  Needless to say, my friends were all, “Oh, are you just now figuring it out?” like I was the last one to know.  It was an ecstatic time until I realized that not everyone shared my enthusiasm.  A wise old priest advised me that if I wanted to go to seminary, I should lie to my bishop.  I had worked too hard to figure out who I was to do that and was told that my kind was not welcome.  My, how things have changed in the Episcopal Church!  Eventually, I went back to school and earned a Masters in Accountancy and passed the CPA examination.  Even then, I was denied two positions because my spouse is a man.  Of course, that was never said out loud in a way that could be proven, not that it would have mattered since there was not, and in many places still is not, protection against discrimination on the basis of sexual preference or gender identity.  
All of that vanishes when I enter the woods at the start of a hike.  As soon as I get far enough from the trailhead that the sound of traffic vanishes, I feel a sense of calm come over me.  I give a deep sigh and am back to being the little boy in the woods again, safe and secure.  That is until I’m reminded that I’m not.  The week before I start this hike, Tom and i will celebrate our 45th anniversary and our seventh year of legal marriage.  I wear a simple wedding band.  I don’t mean for it to be a provocation.  In 2017, when I was testing my physical therapy-improved knees before attempting to thru-hike in 2018, I hiked Northern Virginia.  I got to the shelter in the late afternoon.  One middle-aged  hiker was already in for the night, and I set up on the opposite side of the shelter.  He seemed pleasant enough and at one point asked me, “How does your wife feel about you being out here?”  I answered, “My husband doesn’t hike, but he is very supportive.”  Oops, I had farted in the elevator.  He exclaimed, “I’m not about to spend the night with a f——g f——t!” and proceeded to gather his things and hike off into the sunset.  I had the shelter to myself that night.  A lot of people hike to figure out who they are.  I hike to be who I am.

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640628,"Wednesday had the makings for a fabulous day!  We’ve had a lot of rainy days this past week, but Wednesday morning dawned overcast but dry with cool temperatures and moderate humidity.  Instead of doing treadmill at the Y, I went walking on the bicycle path along the lakefront.  It’s about a mile downhill to the lake, and then another 2-1/2 miles out to Rockpoint, 130 wooded acres owned by the Episcopal Diocese of Vermont.  It’s home to the diocesan offices, a conference center, a school, and most importantly for this journal entry, over two miles of beautifully constructed trail, leading to Lone Rock Point, which juts out over Lake Champlain.  It’s a good turning point, and I have yet to meet anyone else there.  
I came home in a good mood and made a grocery list.  We alternate weeks cooking and my week started Thursday, but I thought I would shop on Wednesday afternoon and avoid the steady rain forecast for Thursday.  After lunch, I was ready to go when the building’s fire alarm sounded.  Sounded is like saying the sun is bright or a hurricane is a bit breezy, both dreadful understatements.  It’s a klaxon that could raise the dead and make the living wish for a merciful death, and for those with impaired hearing, a blinding strobe light.  I assumed it was a false alarm, which has happened occasionally, and grabbed my grocery list and bags and walked down the staircase.  The firetrucks were already there, blocking the driveway, so I was trapped.  It turns out that a 6” water pipe that feeds a zone of our fire sprinkler system burst in one of the mechanical rooms, setting off the alarm and notifying the fire department.  The water in the mechanical room was waist deep when the firefighters opened the door, and a wall of water swept through the room with residents’ storage lockers, through the lobby that we just had repainted, and down a staircase to the underground garage, with enough left over to flood the first floor hallway, and I’m sure, dampen the first floor condo units.  It also knocked out our elevator.
The elevator was back in service Wednesday evening, and ServiceMasters has already started the drying out process.  Residents were asked to empty their storage lockers, which are 6’ x 6’ plywood cubicles, so that ServiceMasters can assure complete drying and apply a mold preventative.
When we moved to Vermont, we downsized but didn’t get rid of all that much.  Most of the excess, still in moving boxes, ended up in our storage locker, along with a few essential items rarely used.  Except for the Christmas tree, we haven’t needed the stuff in five years, so it was tempting to have it just all hauled away, but that would be too easy.  So we sorted it into three groups.  The dry boxes are now upstairs in our unit.  My intention is to go through them separating Goodwill-worthy items from the junk, and also to go through the boxes that still lurk in the upstairs closets, along with the equivalent of a kitchen junk drawer except it is two large plastic bins of backpacking gear that I no longer use.  The start of my hike is six weeks away, so this may provide the deadline pressure I need to actually do something.  CPAs’ lives are structured around due dates.  The second group was waterlogged boxes, mostly books, and we trashed them.  If I haven’t read them in five years, I won’t miss them.  Finally there was an array of empty boxes, like from Apple computers, that are so well designed that it seemed like a shame to throw them away.  They are now behind our garage parking space waiting for me to cut them down for recycling.  
We’ve been through this once before.  Our house burned down in 2008, and we lost just about everything.  We even lost our Christmas closet.  Everyone has one.  It is filled with things that you hate given to you by people you love.  Losing that was a blessing.  It took well over a year and the combined efforts of adjusters, inventory specialists, a structural engineer, a contractor, and of course an attorney to reach settlement with our insurance carrier so we could start rebuilding.  This little flood is comparatively minor, really just a nuisance, but it’s enough for all the bad memories to come “flooding” back into consciousness.  
We’ve never been the sort to collect things or to hoard.  We have a collection of works by Master Potter Ki Woon Huh who lives in Sarasota.  They are all high temperature ceramics so survived the fire just fine.  After losing my library, I now mostly download ebooks.  I was working on an historic novel and had completed most of my research and had started to write.  I backed up religiously on a thumb drive.  It melted along with the computer.  It was set in the Abolitionist period and actually stemmed from a dream I had while staying in the Ironmasters Mansion Hostel in Pine Grove Furnace State Park in Pennsylvania.  In the dream, it was an opera!  I’ve tried, but I can’t bring myself to redo the research, but I am still haunted by Maria, enslaved in a brothel in New Orleans, owned by her master and father, and Anthony, son of the Ironmaster.   CPAs preach “off site storage of backup,” but did I listen to myself?  Today, everything is in the Cloud and that makes me feel much more secure.  
Losing stuff is a good reminder about the impermanence of things and how little they matter, compared to things like love.  I’ll try not to weigh down my pack with useless junk, and certainly not with waterlogged books.",,View Entry,"Jul 09, Fri",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640821,"Until Parkinson’s Dementia robbed my mother of most of her memories, she would often ask me, “Kenny, do you know what day this is?”  I would tell her the date and day of the week, but that wasn’t what she wanted.  “No,” she would say, “Don’t you remember what day this is?”  She would then remind me that whatever day it was was the anniversary of someone-I-had-never-heard-of’s death.  I would reply, “So?”  “So, you should feel sad.”  And so it was for my mother.  Every day was the anniversary of someone’s death, and she took her responsibility to feel miserable quite seriously.  On my last visit with my Mom, she had a rare moment of semi-lucidity and actually recognized me and knew my name.  “Kenny,” she said, “I’m worried.”  “What are you worried about, Mom?”  “I don’t know.  That’s why I’m worried.”  
I am grateful to my mother for teaching me how not to live!  I try not to worry about things I can’t control.  I try not to feel sad about things that are past.  I try not to look at profile maps of the next day’s hike.  I know it will go uphill, occasionally steeply.  It always does.  And I know that I will get to the top.  Worrying about it in advance costs me sleep, making the climb even more difficult.  To the extent that I think about the dead, it is within the context of The Communion of Saints, so great a cloud of witnesses cheering us on.  
Nonetheless, I find myself surrounded by swirls of memory triggered by the silliest of things.  Some are sensory, like la petite madeleine, Proustian moments.  Other times, it can be seeing a date, like tomorrow, July 14th, Bastille Day.  I am transported back to 1970, doing research at the University of Georgia, on lake mud, which at the time seemed much more interesting than it does now.  I spent hour-after-hour in a laboratory cold room set to 3.98* C (39.16* F), when water is densest.  Under my lab coat,  I wore a moth-eaten Pendleton Wool belted sweater that had been left by a former student but mostly I froze.  It was on this date 51 years ago that I started to grow my beard.  I’ve shaved it off periodically, especially when I started graying and my beard went multi-color, like I had the mange.  Now that it is uniformly gray and trending toward silver, it will remain.  I can’t think of any other specific date that triggers memories.  Events like birthdays, anniversaries, and Christmas seem well-rooted in my mind without the need for date clues.  
There are memories that trigger odors instead of the other way around.  For example, thinking about hiking in Southwest Virginia causes me to smell the light bubblegum fragrance of pink flame azaleas and the slightly skunky odor of a dark green low perennial leaf.  I can’t recall its name, only its odor.  I’ll take a photo this year and post it so you can tell me what it is.  I’ve seen it used in modern floral arrangements, which has always mystified me, given its odor.  Writing that brings florists to mind, and a boyfriend of long ago who had to wear a pink bunny costume and hop around in front of the florist shop to drum up Easter sales.  I’ll stop here.  Cascades of memories, one triggering the next, some visual, some aural, some gustatory, all varieties, all linked ineffably.  It’s like the Kevin Bacon parlor game, the Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon, which rests on the assumption that everyone in Hollywood is connected somehow, no matter how tenuously, to Kevin Bacon.  So-and-so was a bit actor in X Film.  The key grip in that film was AB, who was the best boy grip in some other film that starred CD, who co-starred with Kevin Bacon in Y film.  You get the idea.
Places trigger memories too, which is one of the reasons I enjoy hiking the same section of trail repeatedly, hiking in the present but also in the disjointed past.  I don’t take many photos and only rarely look at them because for me at least, photos have a way of setting memories in concrete.  I like for my memories to be malleable, unconfused by reality.  I took the above photo on Stony Man Mountain in Shenandoah National Park in 2015 and use it as the wallpaper on my iPhone.    It makes me smile remembering that hike with my friend Blitz who quickly became Blitzed.  He’s an avid cyclist, but his bike fitness did not translate well to hiking.  I had plenty of time to contemplate views waiting for him.  Also, we were hiking southbound, meaning that Skyland Resort is only about 1/2 mile further along, always a cause for joy.  Blitz had his revenge when following the hike, we biked the Great Allegheny Passage and C&O Canal Towpath, and I was saddlesore for days.  
I think everyone experiences these sorts of chains of memory.  One of the luxuries of a long solo hike is giving fantasy free rein.  Stream of consciousness hiking?  There have even been times on the trail when I’ve thought that I understood the meaning of the universe and my place in it.  Invariably, I am stung by a bee at that moment and brought down to earth.  It’s made me grateful for bee stings.   
I just saw that July 14th is also International Nonbinary People’s Day. Think of the new associations this might engender!",,View Entry,"Jul 13, Tue",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641071,"Thanks to retired Trail Mom Laurie, I can now put a name to the skunky plant in Southwest Virginia.  It’s the evergreen perennial Galax.
After suffering through the last couple of entries, you deserve a practical one.   In one month, I will be at ATC Headquarters in Harpers Ferry receiving my thru-hiker hang tag and having my photo taken, to mark the official start of my thru-hike.  I am so excited!  It doesn’t seem to matter how many hikes I’ve been on, starting one always thrills me.
Last Thursday, I met a friend for coffee at Black Cap Coffee on Church Street.  Their French Roast is my current favorite.  Then I went across the street to Outdoor Gear Exchange, and  surprisingly, I found everything I was looking for.  
I needed down wash for when I get home from my hike.  How often does a sleeping bag need washing?  When opening the stuff sack causes me to gasp and the bag starts to wrap itself around me at night, it’s time.  I try to bathe before dinner, meaning that I run a damp bandana over myself, and I sleep in long underwear as PJs, but even so, the sleeping bag gradually loses loft and starts to smell like well-aged roadkill.   I can go as long as 45 - 60 days between sleeping bag washings.  I’ll start this hike with a Western Mountaineering 35* sleeping bag and plan to switch to my 20* bag in Damascus, Virginia.  I’ll ask Tom to air the smelly bag in the sun for a couple of days and I’ll wash it when I get home.  GEAR MAINTENANCE TIP:  If you treat a down sleeping bag properly, it will last for decades, more than justifying the high initial cost.  Either hand wash a down sleeping bag or use a front-loading washing machine on the hand wash or delicate cycle, using a soap specifically made for down.  The bag should be zippered and turned inside out.   Select an extra rinse cycle.   Before drying it, turn the sleeping bag right side out and spray it with a water-repellent treatment like Revivex and turn it inside out again.  Then dry it at low temperature for a couple of hours or longer, until it is completely dry and free of clumps.  Adding tennis balls to the dryer is unnecessary, unless you are really fond of noise. When the sleeping bag is not merely dry but really most sincerely dry, set it out on a rug or a sofa for a couple of days before stowing it away in a large cotton sack. The loft should be fully restored and the sleeping bag should be free of hiker stench.  
I also needed a new bottle of Sawyer’s Picaridin insect repellent.  The lotion feels like skin moisturizer and is far more pleasant to use than DEET, equally effective against mosquitos and ticks and possibly even more effective against flies like no-see-ums.  Picaridin has the added advantage of not melting plastic.  One application lasts me all day.  I use it primarily on my legs since I hike in shorts.  Ideally, I would hike in long pants tucked into my socks, but unless it is really cold, I can’t stand to do that.  My clothing is treated with permethrin by InsectShield (good for 70 washes).   Permethrin is classified as an insecticide, not a repellent, but I find that a treated hat or sweatband seems to hold clouds of gnats and even black flies at bay.    It may just be my imagination, which by now we have established is overactive, but if it keeps the bugs away, that’s fine with me.
I also needed a 4-ounce gas canister, which including the canister itself weighs about 8 ounces, easily enough to get to Front Royal,Virginia and probably into Shenandoah National Park.  
Finally, I bought a tube of Nuun’s electrolyte tablets and three freeze-dried dinners.  I don’t often buy them, instead doing the usual Knoor’s Noodles and a pouch of tuna, but I’ll have plenty of time for that later.  Outdoor Gear Exchange had two brands that were new to me, Trailtopia and Heather’s Choice.  I’m a sucker for new foods, especially frozen hors d’oevre.   They sound so good:  Curry Ramen Noodles supplemented with a pouch of freeze-dried chicken, Beef Stroganoff with a pouch of freeze-dried sausage, and finally Grass-Fed Bison Chili claiming 42 grams of protein!  These are single portion dinners, and that’s enough for me during the first week of a hike.  Then I will want more, much more. 
After lunch, I brought up my gear spreadsheet and using it as a checklist, gathered everything together, keeping a list of things to be added at the last minute, like my iPhone, EarPods, and reading glasses, and a list of things to be purchased, like Aleve, cash and grocery store items.  I’ve made a few changes since completing the Gear section of this journal.  On my Camels Hump hike, I tried the bungee water bottle holders that attach to the shoulder strap of my ULA Circuit Pack.   It worked, but especially on the steep scrambles, it was in the way.  I’ve tried using SmartWater bottles in the pack’s side pockets.  While I can retrieve them, I can’t reinsert them without taking the pack off.  So I’m returning to my tried and true method, carrying a one-liter Platypus bladder with drinking tube in a side pocket.  I use a small S-carabiner to attach it to the pack so it doesn’t flop around.  Many packs, including this one, have an optional interior hydration sleeve, but carrying water inside the pack seems to me a setup for disaster.   In place of the water bottle bungees, I attached a small waterproof pocket to the shoulder strap, so now I have one on each side.  What follows is a description of what I’ll be carrying and where it goes in my pack.
The ULA Circuit backpack is made from X-Pac fabric and is said to be waterproof.   Wouldn’t that be lovely?  The zippers on the hip belt pockets and shoulder pouches are water resistant.  My assumption is that the pack will leak, but keep stuff dryer than a standard pack with a pack cover.  Everything in my pack will be in roll-top water resistant stuff sacks.  The ultralight dry bags manufactured by ZPacks are my favorites, lasting several seasons. .  
I use the hip belt pockets primarily for snacks, a tube of Nuun electrolyte tablets, and a face mask.  I’ll need the mask on Amtrak.  The smaller shoulder-strap pocket is for things that I like to have handy during a hike, without having to open up my pack:  Chapstick, sunscreen, insect repellent, knife, tick key, a washer used to lock and unlock my bear canister, compass & thermometer, and a small but loud whistle.   In twenty-five years, I have never needed to use a survival whistle, but I would want it handy should I need it.  If you don’t know, the universal distress signal is three long blasts.  By the way, loud high-pitched noises, even air horns, are said to be attractive to bears, proving that there’s no accounting for taste.   I use the second shoulder pouch for my iPhone in a waterproof LifeProof case, reading glasses, and Apple AirPods.  I have only rarely listened to music as I hike, so perhaps it is a mistake to have the AirPods so accessible.  I’ve started using them at the Y, especially on treadmill days, and I am totally impressed by the noise cancellation technology.  I wonder if they would be a defense against a deadly snorer like the one I encountered at the Ironmaster’s Mansion hostel in Pennsylvania in 2018? Rattling the shingles in one thing, but this guy who I call Ferret, could crack slate roofing slabs.  
In one side pocket, I keep a three-liter HydraPak Seeker with a Katadyn BeFree Filter.  It is stabilized by one of the side compression straps of my pack and a quick release buckle at the top.  The only time I would actually carry three liters of water would be if I were hiking into a dry campsite for the night, but I like the capacity to only visit a spring once after making camp.  A 7” length of PVC pipe that I use as a stick massager is also stored in that pocket, secured with a small carabiner.  I assume that things left unsecured will escape at some point.
I use the other side pocket for the one-liter Platypus bladder mentioned above, a 16-ounce Nalgene bottle (for instant breakfast and electrolyte drinks) that fits perfectly inside an 8-ounce titanium mug that doubles as my water scoop, a cathole trowel (secured with a carabiner), toilet paper in a Ziplock bag, and a small container of hand sanitizer clipped to the pack.  
The front pouch of the backpack, which I persist in calling the back of the pack, contains a small section of a Z-Rest pad that I use as a campseat, my rain jacket and pants, and a small section of groundcloth good under my sleeping bag in shelters and as an exercise mat.  I clip a pair of Vivobarefoot campshoes under the elastic shock cord, along with two stainless steel diaper pins (for drying socks or whatever) and a small baby raccoon knit by my cousin Rocky Raccoon.  All of these items could be called luxuries and in total weigh 21 ounces.
The ULA Circuit Pack itself is a single roll-top sack.  First in is my sleeping bag stuffed into a roll-top dry bag, measuring 5” x 12”.  If happiness is a warm puppy, then misery is a cold, wet down sleeping bag.  My NeoAir Uberlite sleeping pad rolls to a 3” x 7” cylinder and fits alongside the sleeping bag.  Above them is my tent rolled up to about 6” x 12”.  On top of and mushed in beside my tent is my roll-top clothing dry bag.  The bear canister, a 12” high 9” diameter cylinder, sits atop it, coming up to the top of the pack’s frame.  I keep it centered in the pack by wedging in my down puffy and pillow case in another dry bag on one side and my Sea-to-Summit Ultra-Sil Dry Day Pack on the other.  I like having the puffy easily accessible for breaks on chilly days.  The Sea-to-Summit day pack contains everything else: first aid kit, repair kit, headlamp, notebook & pen, wallet, head net, an extra stuff sack, and my distance glasses, in case I really want to see something clearly.   Aside from food, the bear canister holds my cookset and toilet kit.  The contents of my various kits are included in the gear sidebar.  I’ve learned to keep my anti-friction foot treatment in my first aid kit instead of with my toiletries, so I can rub it over my feet before I put my socks and shoes on in the morning to retrieve my canister.  
It seems like each hiker finds their own method of packing their pack.  Most will agree that the heaviest item, usually food, should be in the middle of the pack, near the spine.  I like having the stuff I use during the day easily accessible.  What I carry and how I carry it has evolved over the years.  There have been times when I’ve been more spartan and foregone luxuries like camp shoes.  My bear canister weighs two pounds and is bulky, but I’ve concluded that it is not a luxury.  It didn’t carry well in the ZPacks Arc Blast pack I was using, hitting my spine when I brought my arms forward.  The ULA pack weighs a pound more but carries so much better for me.  I’ve tried going stoveless, but I wasn’t happy and lost weight even faster.  My base weight now, including everything except consumables, is 15 pounds.  I’ve been as low as 10 pounds.  It’s a compromise between comfort on the trail and comfort in camp.  My leaving town weight with three days of food and a liter of water is about 23 pounds.  The ULA pack is comfortable for me up to 30 pounds.  Maybe I’ll start the Hundred Mile Wilderness in Maine at that weight, but it will lighten with each day.   My present kit is my sweet spot, and I hope you find yours.  But please, let’s not debate it on the trail!  One Mary Ellen was quite sufficient.",,View Entry,"Jul 18, Sun",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641183,"In the time between awakening and arising from bed, I try to recall my dreams.  Sometimes there is but a single phrase and that was the case this morning: In Wildness is the preservation of the World.  You will recognize it as belonging to Henry David Thoreau, from his essay, Walking, published in The Atlantic in June 1862, a month after his death from tuberculosis.  The topic evolved over  a ten-year period, starting as a lecture delivered in his hometown of Concord, Massachusetts, and repeated in one form or another at least nine times.  
The line that invaded my dawn is very popular, embraced by conservationists and fans of wilderness, as extolling wilderness for the sake of wilderness.  That wasn’t what Thoreau said at all.  His Wildness or Wilderness is the fount of humankind, the wolf that suckled Romulus and Remus, the source of “tonics and barks that brace mankind.”  It is a place to saunter on a pleasant summer afternoon where one can be “absolutely free from all worldly engagements.” It is a place to “go in search of the springs of life,” contrasted to “a man’s swinging dumbbells for his health.”  (Oh my, I do both.)  It is Wildness that serves humankind, by keeping alive that part of us most connected to our origins.  “Life consists with wildness.  The most alive is the wildest.  Not yet subdued to man, its presence refreshes him.”  Henry David Thoreau not only tells us why we should walk but also instructs us in the art of walking:  You must walk like a camel, which is said to the the only beast which ruminates when walking.  Well, actually all ruminants including cattle, goats, sheep, giraffes and reindeer and even modified ruminants like llamas and alpacas do the same.  But his point is well taken.
When we visited Walden Pond fifteen years ago, I was so disappointed.  The site of Thoreau’s original cabin is indicated with stone markers and there is a reconstruction of his 10’ x 15’ cabin.  It is adjacent to a public beach and flooded with noise from a nearby highway.  It wasn’t much more remote in 1845, then and now only 2 miles from the town center of Concord. During the course of his two-year experiment in living, Thoreau walked into Concord two or three times a week, both for provisions and for gossip.  Aside from Ralph Waldo Emerson, he appears to have had few real friendships, although he never seemed to tire of his own company.  
So what did Mr. Thoreau cogitate on during his daily walks and in the Maine Woods?  He was a keen observer of natural history, even developing an early theory of forest succession. Thoreau was an inveterate journalizer, filling 47 manuscript volumes between 1837 and 1861 mostly with his nature observations and details of his home economics, with occasional snide remarks, but very little of what might be called rhapsodies to nature as a divine force, at least not in my haphazard sampling.    He recognizes his own limited point of view and incomplete knowledge that prevent him from seeing the harmonious interdependence that he suspects underlies all things.  It made him reluctant to tinker with nature lest he trigger untoward side-effects, and to that extent, he did advocate letting nature be. To label Thoreau a transcendentalist seems based more on his friendships than on his philosophy.  
I wish that I had Thoreau’s powers of observation and concentration and could recall at the end of the day what I have seen.  These are things I think about in the weeks before a hike.  During the hike itself, I’m too preoccupied with the daily lather, rinse, repeat cycle of eating, hiking, and sleeping to think much about philosophy.  I concentrate on not tripping over roots, rocks, and my own feet.  I try to be aware of the topography i’m hiking over, how the trail relates to the underlying features, and in general the types of trees and soils.  Very little of the Appalachian Trail is virgin forest.  Most is second or third growth, and I try to see evidence of previous cuts and previous efforts to exploit the forest for farmland, grazing, or mining.  I try to listen to the stories of the forest, so softly spoken that even my footfalls can drown them out.  I try to relax my vision and to sense movement peripherally.  The Wild is not my home; I’m only a guest, so I try to move invisibly through it with minimal disturbance to the permanent residents.  
When the trail is easy and my feet are walking independent of my brain, then I do ruminate on thoughts as diverse as the interrelationship of all things and the green salad awaiting me in town, before I scarf down a pizza, and I wonder what it would be like to experience the Blessed Virgin Mary sitting on the limb of a tree above the trail.  What message would she impart?  
I was in the fourth entering class of New College in 1968, right after their first graduation and receiving their accreditation.  Our class was the largest to date at just under 100 students, and we were all gathered in the music room of the Charles Ringling mansion that served as our College Hall.  As part of our orientation, a chain-smoking professor of philosophy stood on a folding chair, a feat in itself, and lectured us on “Signs and Semiosis.”  I don’t know why, unless it was to impress upon us how little we knew and how much he did.  The only line I remember is, “One cannot achieve an orgasm while trying to analyze one.”   I think that applies to thru-hiking as well.",,View Entry,"Jul 20, Tue",0

 Secretion of milk.  N/A

I pass!  It’s the second feature of mammals that concerns me today.  I’ve already embarrassed myself and you by discussing pooping and peeing.  Today’s topic is body hair.  I’ll ease into the topic.
Three weeks from today, we will drive over to my cousin Rocky Raccoon’s home outside of Schenectady, New York. Actually, Tom will drive as he usually does.  He enjoys driving and I don’t.  Depending on the traffic around the confusion of factory outlets in Queensbury, New York, the drive takes a bit over three hours, That’s about my limit of my tolerance for auto travel.  Our Subaru Outback, the unofficial state vehicle of Vermont, is five years old and just passed 13,000 miles on the odometer.  We don’t drive much, because almost everything is within walking distance of our condo.  On the morning before we leave Burlington on August 16, I will deal with two hairy matters. 
First, I will trim my beard, a weekly chore.  I have a much older model of the Wahl Manscaper pictured here, but it does the job.  I admit that I chose this particular trimmer because of the name.  Manscaper!  It has a woodsy lumberjack ring to it that makes me want to beat my chest and growl.  
Second, I will visit Nathan for a haircut.  I found him when we first moved to Burlington when he was working at another salon, because his photo on the salon’s website was cute and his blurb mentioned texturizing, a technique for taming thick unruly hair like mine.  I’m not complaining.  I didn’t like my hair growing up, but now that I’m older and still have hair and especially thick hair that needs texturizing, I am fond of it.  I’ll get a haircut and beard trim once during this hike, probably in Damascus, Virginia, where I’ll take a zero day (zero miles hiked).  I just noticed that according to Google, there is no longer a listing for Frank’s Barber Shop there. That is a pity.  I went there the last time I hiked into Damascus and when I emerged with a regulation Damascus haircut, I was accepted in town.  It was very much like Floyd’s Barber Shop in Mayberry on the Andy Griffith Show, complete with ancient Field & Stream magazines and gossiping men.  There was a poster showing the three styles offered:  flat tops, short on the top and sides, and longer on the top and short on the sides.  It was the kind of place a man could hike up his britches, scratch himself, spit, and take pride in belonging.  I will miss it.  When I know when I’ll be flying home from Atlanta, I will immediately text Nathan for an appointment so he can start undoing the damage.  
But first, there is today’s dreaded chore, the shearing of the sheep, the trimming of my body hair.  Why do I do it?  It’s easier to keep somewhat clean with less hair and easier to spot ticks.  I don’t shave my body, but I aim for the same uniform 3/8” (a number 3 guard) that I use on my beard.  That’s short enough to make a noticeable difference and long enough not to be unduly prickly.  I do it about three weeks in advance of a hike, so the inevitable itching is over with before the hike.  I last body-groomed a year ago, before hiking in the Adirondacks with Rocky Raccoon and Willow, and it has grown back to about 3” in length.  I am not grossly hirsute, not like a silverback gorilla, but hairy enough that trimming makes a difference.   I don’t trim my arms and my legs, but pretty much everywhere else.   
There are several stages in preparing for a hike that make it seem real.  The first is purchasing train or plane tickets and making a reservation for the first night.  The second, a relatively recent innovation, is registering the hike at ATCamp on ATC’s website.  Third is gathering my gear together and replacing things that have worn out or that I’ve tired of.  Then comes the shearing of the hiker, akin to fueling a rocket with liquid oxygen and kerosine.  There can be no turning back now.  The last stage in the final week before the hike is purchasing food for the first week.  Then it’s blast off!",,View Entry,"Jul 26, Mon",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641590,"Vieva and I enjoyed a leisurely 5.4 mile hike on Snake Mountain this morning.   The trail follows an old, sometimes muddy, carriage road.  It is rated moderate, but I think that is only because it gains about 1,000 feet.  The trail itself is easy, and the grade gentle enough not to hinder conversation.  There is a ridge loop trail on the summit, but it is closed until August 1 for peregrine falcon nesting season.   
The carriage road was opened in 1874 to service the Grand View Hotel located near the summit.  The owner tried to rename the mountain Grand View, thinking the name Snake Mountain might deter some guests.  The hotel closed in 1925 and eventually burned down.  Today most of the mountain is part of the 1,215 acre Snake Mountain Wildlife Management Area administered by the state, adjacent to the 81 acre Wilmarth Woods protected by the Nature Conservancy.  It’s only 1,287 feet at the summit, but because the mountain stands alone, it offers excellent views of Lake Champlain and the Adirondack Mountains.  It’s about an hour’s drive south of Burlington. 
The only wildlife I saw was a couple of squirrels and a sparrow.  I was hoping for a snake, even a garter snake.  A part of me was wishing for a sighting of Titanoboa, recently featured on the Smithsonian Channel.  This extinct (so they say) prehistoric snake was about 43 feet long, weighing about 1-1/4 tons.  There’s a lot of wilderness in Vermont, so maybe just maybe, it’s there, lurking, waiting for a lone hiker to wander by.  Who knows, it might even consort with Champ, the Lake Champlain monster that predates Nessie.  It’s so nice to be able to fantasize about mythical creatures rather than feeling knee pain with each step!   I am most grateful!",,View Entry,"Jul 29, Thu",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641735,"I scared myself last Friday.  I had done my stretching and physical therapy protocols at home, walked down to the Y for chest, back and arms, come home and done abs and had breakfast.  Nothing unusual about that.  I decided to do a little touchup trimming of some patches of body hair I had missed on Monday.  Sometimes the silver hair is nearly invisible.  I had to do a lot of twisting to get to it, and I felt my lower back go out.  Ouch!  What a stupid thing to do.  I have a wonderful colloidal clay ice pack that can also be microwaved and used as a heating pad.  I did that and then froze it and used it as an icepack several times that day.  My chiropractor, who was taking a long weekend, taught me to use heat upon wakening and then ice during the day.  I don’t know if this is standard practice, but it feels good and seems to help.  Saturday became a zero day for me, except for the heat and icepack.  Sunday I was able to do the housecleaning I had deferred from Saturday, and today I’m back to the Y and everything seems fine again.  Whew!  How horrible I would feel if I had to cancel or to postpone my hike because my back went out.  
It’s a good reminder that I need to be flexible in my hiking schedule.  I plan on zero days in Virginia in Waynesboro, Daleville, Woods Hole Hostel (just south of Pearisburg), and Damascus; and in North Carolina in Hot Springs and with a friend outside of Franklin.  But if I need to take a couple or three days in town with an ice pack, that’s okay too!  One of the nice things about a flip-flop thru-hike is that there is very little time pressure.  So long as I summit Katahdin before next August 18, I will have achieved my goal.  Hiking without a strict schedule will be a new experience for me, and I need to keep reminding myself that I’m allowed to be flexible.  
This episode was a reminder of something else I do in the two weeks before a hike.  I reduce the weights I use at the Y by 10%, and don’t increase on the second or third set.  I focus more on form and range of motion.  It puts me strictly into a maintenance mode, and I feel like it lets my body “consolidate” its strength, such as it is, and reduces the risk of injury.  I worked legs and shoulders this morning.  Walking up the hill back home afterwards felt like I was floating.  May all my ups in the coming months suffer from this illusion!

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641909,"I suppose every couple falls into routines that through years of repetition become much more than habits.  Dare I call them matrimonial liturgy?  Things like which side of the bed you sleep on.  Who gets to use the towel bar in the master bathroom and whose towel is consigned to dry in the guest bath.  Having soup and Goldfish crackers for lunch every Sunday.  Having gin & tonics on Friday evening. How the housekeeping chores are divided.  In and of themselves, the rituals are meaningless, but taken together, they present a tapestry of a relationship, a pantomime of love.  So many little things.  I can’t stand the sound of vacuum cleaners, so Tom does that while I’m out.  I clean the bathrooms.  In the five years since we retired to Burlington, we’ve fallen into alternating weeks cooking, with the cooking week starting on Thursday.  Cooking includes menu planning, grocery shopping, cooking and cleaning up, taking out the trash, recycling and composting, and even exercising the car every two or three days to keep the battery charged.  In effect, the non-cook gets a week of leisure.   
My cooking week starts today, and I’m keenly aware that it’s my last cooking week before my hike, and that I’ll be the one breaking with tradition for 2-1/2 or 3 months, and then after wintering at home, I’ll be off again to complete the trail. It’s not the same as going apostate, but it has a little of that feeling.  For 20-some years, I would go to a tax conference in Atlanta for a week each fall.  That didn’t count as going away, since I wasn’t having fun.  Tom visiting family in Georgia most years didn’t count either, for the same reason.  My paddling and then hiking adventures over the past 30 years definitely counted and cast me in the role of villain, but they were always of finite duration.  This time it feels like running away from home, except that I really like my home and our life together.  
Over the years, I’ve learned that scout and summer camp groups are excellent opportunities to be fed.  I just sit on the sidelines, which would be my instinct anyway, and sooner or later, a kid who is shyer than the rest or for whatever reason just doesn’t fit in, the kid who would have been me, will start talking.  Just listening often earns me a dinner invitation.  Twenty years ago in Maine, it was a summer camp group, and a little boy whose parents owned the camp.  It was his first “away” trip without his parents and he was feeling very alone.  He said to me, “I know it’s called being homesick, but I never knew it really hurt.”  I can still tear up remembering him.   It was a good burrito, too.
I guess I’m feeling a little like that, a little homesick and I haven’t even left home yet.  So my last cooking week will feature ultimate comfort foods:  corned beef and cabbage, air fryer fried chicken. smothered pork chops, and chicken and rice casserole. I’ll get over it and quickly come to enjoy my away trip, but old habits are hard to break.  If I find myself in town on a Sunday, there will be soup for lunch.  And Friday nights are reserved for gin & tonics.   Cheers!",,View Entry,"Aug 05, Thu",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642276,"What a silly time to be leaving Vermont!  I noticed when I went out walking last Sunday that some of the sumacs are already brilliant orangey-red.  One of the maples across the street is starting to turn and will soon be bright orange.  By the time I return in early November, it will be stick season, meaning that all of the leaves will have fallen and snow will not have accumulated yet.  It will be time to change over to snow tires.    I will miss our annual fall drive on uber-scenic Vermont Route 100 that hugs the eastern side of the Green Mountains.  It is hard to be too nostalgic, however, when the National Weather Service has issued a heat advisory for today, with a forecast heat index over 100 degrees, and the City has opened three cooling centers.  
With the surge of the Delta Variant, indoor masking is once again recommended even in highly vaccinated Vermont.  The visitor centers of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy now require masking.  So it will be good to be spending time outdoors.  Rocky Raccoon and I have decided to tent whenever possible and to avoid hostels.  Sigh!  I was really looking forward to staying at Bears Den Hostel the second night and taking advantage of their $35 hiker special!   It includes bunk, shower, laundry, pizza, a pint of Ben & Jerry’s Ice Cream, and a soda.    On past stays, there have been make-it-yourself pancakes and coffee in the morning as well.  I suppose that we could mask indoors, bring our food outside, and either camp on the lawn or hike another 1/2 mile to a campsite on a creek.  These are the type of decisions that consume hours of a hike and quickly become much more important than anything happening in the “real world.”  Shelters are iffy for Covid, but in a bad rain storm, they are awfully attractive.  Restaurants in towns are irresistible.  I will try to be comply with Covid best practices, but temporarily sating my hiker hunger will win out every time.  
I have purchased food for the Harpers Ferry to Front Royal leg of the hike.  Tomorrow, I’ll strip off excess packaging and fill the bear canister.  I’ll load my backpack on Sunday to minimize the time my sleeping bag is compressed.  My last pre-hike chores will be clipping my nails and a haircut Monday morning before we drive over to Rocky Raccoon’s house near Schenectady, New York.  I’ll write my next journal entry from the train on our way to Harpers Ferry!",,View Entry,"Aug 12, Thu",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642514,"It was a delightful 52 degrees yesterday morning. After trimming my beard, I walked down to Nathan’s for my trail haircut.  I gave him a free hand. The sides are short enough to see my scalp. The top is longer and severely textured. Running my hand through it reminds of a summer crewcut in grade school. I love it.  
Tom and I drove over to Rocky Raccoon and her partner Rick’s house on Mariaville Lake just west of Schenectady, New York arriving about 3:00, in time for cocktails to commemorate Bennington Battle Day, an official Vermont state holiday.  It was a rare strategic victory for the Continental Army costing the British 1,000 troops and much needed supplies, making a critical difference to the outcome of Saratoga. It was actually fought in New York, but the monument is in Bennington, Vermont, so Vermont takes credit. Rocky had picked up carryout dinners from Canali’s Italian Restaurant on Sunday since they are closed on Mondays.  Canali’s opened in 1947 and the menu hasn’t changed since.  It is traditional Italian food, heavy enough to weight down a syndicate boss without the need for concrete overshoes.  The portions are immense.  Tom and I shared a baked lasagna entree and side salad. We ate about a quarter of it.  The single portion is easily enough to feed a family of six.  We brought a couple of bottles of Vino Rosso recommended by my local wine shop, Dedalus.  Rocky had her favorite pork chops, with a side of spaghetti.  Fortunately we are not hiking today. The condemned hikers ate hearty meals. 
We woke up at our usual time, about 4:30, and I enjoyed a shower and shaved my cheeks and neck for the last time until who knows when, Damascus, maybe.  Tom drove us to the Amtrak station in Albany about a 45 minutes drive away and continued home to Burlington.  Rocky and I took the 7AM Empire Service to the new Moynihan Train Hall, arriving about 40 minutes late because of a stalled train just outside the station. The tracks follow the east bank of the Hudson River and is quite beautiful, even with today’s overcast skies. The Moynihan Train Hall is a vast improvement over Penn Station across the street, but we didn’t have time to explore it before the Northeast Regional to Union Station in Washington, D.C. was called.   Thank goodness the café car on this train is open and we were finally able and to have our morning coffee. Feeling much better now. 
Now coming into Wilmington, Delaware, reminding me to feel gratitude to President Biden for the attention he has focused on Amtrak. I love train travel, especially business class with leather seats and enough leg room for a giraffe. 
When I served on the ATC board and was working, I flew often enough to keep Medallion Status with Delta and was often bumped to first class.  It was nice, but I still prefer business class or a roomette on Amtrak. I miss train travel from the pre-Amtrak days, especially the Southern Crescent.  It had a club car for first class passengers on the end of the train, where the caboose belongs, decked out in dark wood paneling and plush red carpeting.  In 1974, I traveled overnight from Atlanta to New York to test out a religious vocation in an Episcopal monastery.  I didn’t find God on the Crescent, but I did drink a gin martini for the first time.  I thought it tasted like furniture polish.  The second was somewhat better, and I’ve never looked back.  It is a vocation of sorts.  Amtrak is bringing back dining cars, but the graciousness of old Southern Railroad is, dare I say it, gone with the wind. No more setting your shoes outside your roomette to be shined overnight. -
We arrived in Union Station about five minutes early. We were fortunate to find chairs. Most have been removed for Covid, I presume.  The Capital Limited departed on time at 4:05, arriving in Harpers Ferry at 5:16, also on the time. This train uses the two-story Superliner cars, and Harpers Ferry passengers are assigned to upstairs seating, assuring great views. Rocky and I are staying at the Town’s Inn tonight, just around the corner from the Amtrak station in Lower Town, Harpers Ferry.  Our room is on the third floor. Our shared bathroom is on the second. It’s a funky little place and suits our needs. 
We had dinner directly across the street at Rabbit Hole. I had a very good crabcake and a green salad with a delicious house-made lemon mint vinaigrette. We’ve gotten our packs sorted out so that the outside stuff like camp shoes are outside now. I’ve prepared a snack baggie for one of the hip belt pockets and plan to start with 1-1/2 liters of water. Tomorrow looks like rain and thunderstorms, but the rest of the 10 day forecast looks much better. Tomorrow will be a good test for my supposedly waterproof backpack. Why am I so skeptical?

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642651,"Today proved to be a very odd day indeed, especially for our first day on the trail. 
I have spent a lot of time in Harpers Ferry. I estimate that I’ve been here 50 times, some as a hiker, but mostly through my years of volunteering with the Appalachian Trail Conservancy. I served 14 years on their board, eight years on the board of managers when the organization was called the Appalachian Trail Conference and then another six on board of directors of the current organizational incarnation, the Appalachian Trail Conservancy. I was the first at-large manager from a non-trail state, Florida, and then served twelve years as treasurer. Financial types get very little glory, and that’s the way it should be.  It’s hard to point to a single accomplishment, but I am proud that ATC moved from rather chaotic bookkeeping to state-of-the-art financial management, helping ATC to earn a four-star rating from Charity Navigator. I made many friends both on the boards and among staff. I should have known that I wouldn’t be able to get away with being anonymous or the unknown hiker. 
Our day started when Laurie Potteiger picked us up at the Town’s Inn and brought us home for breakfast.  Her husband Dick, like me an inactive CPA, joined us.  Laurie recently retired as ATC director of information, more informally known as Trail Mom. After breakfast, she brought us to ATC Headquarters to receive our thru-hiker hang tags and the traditional thru-hiker photo. Then Dave Startzell and his wife Judy Jenner surprised us with a sendoff appearance. Dave was the first employee of ATC in 1968 and served as executive director/CEO  during my time on the board. Judy edited Trailways News, that preceded the current magazine. Dave presented me with a Snickers Bar for good luck. 
We didn’t get away until nearly 10 and walked the blue-blazed side trail to the AT, then south across the Shenandoah River bridge and started our 900’ climb up Loudon Heights. Hot and humid would be an understatement. The remnants of Tropical Storm Fred were expected soon. I felt like I could take a handful of air, squeeze it, and it would drip. From my years living in Florida and Georgia and running in equivalent heat and humidity, I am somewhat acclimated. I sweat just enough for evaporative cooling but leak very few electrolytes. Poor Rocky Raccoon!  She suffered greatly on the climb. In fairness, the conditions were as bad as I’ve ever hiked in. The torrential rain showers waited until we had gained the ridgeline and felt so good!   It was 2:00 when we reached Keys Gap, and it was obvious that we were not going another 6.8 miles to Blackburn Trail Center. Sandi Marra, currently CEO of ATC, and her husband Chris “Trail Boss” Bruton were going to meet us there. I’ve known them since 1997, and adoration is a fair expression of my feeling for them. Sandi was going to cook us dinner. Trust me, Sandi is an amazing chef!  So between Laurie this morning and Sandi this evening, I was going to gain weight on the first day of my thru-hike. I emailed Sandi with our change of plans.  I copied Laurie since I didn’t have Sandi’s phone number and asked her to try reaching Sandi. I felt terrible about upsetting her plans. Laurie phoned me back that a tornado warning was issued for the area including the David Lesser Shelter, three miles away and our alternate plan for the night. Laurie came for us at Key Gap and now we are clean and our laundry done at the Quality Inn in Harpers Ferry. I emailed Sandi asking if she had dinner plans. In a few minutes we’ll walk up to Sandi and Chris’ house, convenient to ATC Headquarters. Tomorrow morning, Laurie will shuttle us back to Keys Gap. 
Dinner was superb. Ribeye steak, baked ratatouille with goat cheese, excellent wine and sour dough bread gifted to me by Rita Hennessy, recently retired from the National Park Service Appalachian Trail Office. Rita originated the Trail to Every Classroom program that provided teachers in districts near the trail with the skills needed to incorporate the trail into their curricula and lesson plans while receiving graduate credit. It’s been marvelously successful not only motivating the students but also in gaining community support for the trail project. I had planned to use a photo of the thru-hiker hangtag for this entry but instead I’ll share a.closeup of Rita’s delicious bread!
So today didn’t go as planned, but worked out to be much better!  Isn’t that the way things happen?  I am grateful for my good friends and go to bed with a full happy tummy.","ATC Headquarters, Harpers Ferry

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642695,"I slept well last night with sweet dreams. Laurie picked us up at 8:00 and we were hiking about 8:30. It’s another hot and humid day. Rocky Raccoon is raring to go and I’m the one dragging today. Nothing specific, more like feeling puny. At one break about 2 miles south of the gap, I was sitting on a log and out of the corner of my eye, I noticed a black shadow moving. It was about 150’ west of the trail. When I focused on it, the shadow materialized into a 60-70 pound yearling black bear. I saw its face once before it vanished over the ridge. Rocky missed it, but did spot one deer this morning and three yesterday. We took a break at David Lesser Shelter, one of the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club’s showplace shelters. It’s immaculate and flooded with light from two high windows. There’s a large front deck and a separate eating pavilion. 
We arrived at PATC’s Blackburn Trail Center about 12:30. The side trail is llllong and steep but worth it!  We filled our water containers and I immediately mixed up an electrolyte solution (Nuun’s tablets) and felt a lot better. We met the caretaker Brendan and the ridge runner Witt. Witt and I spoke for a long time. He’s a triple crowner, meaning that he had hiked all three of the major hiking trails, the Appalachian Trail, Pacific Crest Trail, and Continental Divide Trail. He went to Hampshire College which is a lot like where I went, New College, and like me tremendously values the critical thinking skills he gained and a depth of understanding of liberal arts and how our society functions and dysfunctions. His thesis dealt with entrepreneurial nonprofit management. He started an arts nonprofit in Atlanta. Since then he has earned a masters in the topic from Goddard College, another experimental college. He loves being outdoors and working on things that he values. He also finds time to run ultramarathons especially on trails. Witt is a brilliant example of the type of person attracted to employment with ATC. 
We met three volunteer trail maintainers with PATC with gas-powered weed whackers cutting back encroaching plants. Unfortunately, we met them after we had come through a blackberry thicket disguising itself as the trail. Both RR and I are merrily sliced. 
RR wanted to go on another four miles to Sand Spring, but I’ve had it. We are staying in the hiker cabin, even though Witt offered us bunks in the Big House. There’s a solar shower and it’s delightful.  It should rain tonight and bring cooler weather tomorrow. I hope so!","

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642731,"I slept well last night and got up early, about 5:30, and quietly packed up my sleeping bag and gear and moved to the cooking pavilion. I had my planned breakfast of Carnation Essential (formerly Instant Breakfast), a tortilla with precooked bacon and coffee. It worked well, giving me energy, assuring full hydration, and after my stretching routine, preparing me for the privy. The house was unfortunately locked so I had to face the big black spiders that Rocky says infest the privy. I didn’t put my headlamp on so I didn’t see them and wasn’t bothered.
The climb out of Blackburn Center is steep, but I was feeling frisky. Rocky, not so much today. I slept well, but she did not. We met some nice hikers today, including a day hiking father and son from Northern Virginia and Mr Blue, 72-year old thru- hiker from Seattle. When Mr Blue reaches Harpers Ferry tomorrow, he will have completed the AT from Springer in Georgia to Hanover, NH. He’s obviously still enjoying himself!
A bit more than three miles in today, we entered the Roller Coaster, a 14 mile section of steep ups and downs ending just before Rod Hollow Shelter. The AT is restricted to a very narrow right-of-way, limiting the options for switchbacks and rerouting, so the trail is eroded down to rock. It is quite steep in places and slow going. The first section of the roller coaster is maintained by Trail Boss, Chris Bruton, and it is as good as it could be. The blazes, however, are works of art!  Thanks, Sandi!   I’m delighted with the way my new knees dealt with it, with no pain, swelling or stiffness!  Of course, the rest of me is pooped, but my knees could have continued on. 
It was another humid day, overcast and not as hot as the last two days. I was careful to drink enough water and to use an electrolyte tablet.  It worked, so I’m much happier than yesterday. It was a tough day for the Raccoon and I’m sure she will sleep better tonight. 
We arrived at Bears Den Hostel about 2:30 and are happily showered. It is in even better shape than my last visit and we are comfortable staying inside. I’m looking forward to trying to eat a large frozen pizza and a pint of Ben & Jerry’s. I do have some Tums in my first aid kit. 
We’ll also do laundry, splitting a load, and I at least plan to enjoy the do-it-yourself pancake breakfast. My Trail appetite is still subpar, but at least my eyes have grown large. By Front Royal, I expect to be perpetually ravenous.","Blackburn Center

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642838,"I did myself fairly proud last night, managing 2/3 of a large frozen pizza and most of a pint of Talenti vanilla sorbet. There was one other guest, Stephen, retired from Boeing. He wanted to talk so I listened. A hiker was also tenting on the yard, Curious George, from the Shenandoah Valley and Mennonite. We got along well even though he acknowledges that I would not be welcome in his church. If I shaved off my mustache (associated with the military) leaving the beard, I might pass, but only if I gave up my husband, of course. What is this?  To gain salvation at the cost of my soul?  No thank you.  At his request, I did help him adjust his pack for a much better fit. 
Today’s hike saw us finish the Roller Coaster and we were truly exhausted when we arrived at the shelter, between the steep ups and downs and high temperature and humidity. It just seems to suck the energy from each of us.  At one point we saw a section of woods blocked off with red tape. I looked a little closer and spotted the white-faced hornets’ nest, about a foot In height.  That would hurt and I’m grateful to the maintainer. 
We came upon a sign reading “Springer 1000 miles.”  At this point I my hike, that is unfathomable.  My only concern was completing the day’s hike and getting out of the roller coaster. 
My only physical complaint at this point is a blister on my left big toe, that started under the callous but has popped. I’m putting antibiotic gel on it at night and keeping it covered. The rocky tread way doesn’t help. It will take a few days to harden up and possibly a zero day in Front Royal. Rocky is soldiering on but has had her share of pain as well. We expect such things at the beginning of a hike, but they are never welcome. In my prehike entries, I mentioned St Francis and his regret for not having been kinder to Brother Ass, his body.

He’ll hike out about 4 miles to Route 50 and phone his wife to rescue him. The hike today would have been a delight had the weather been cooler, If there had been a breeze, and if we weren’t still exhausted from the roller coaster. It was fairly gentle terrain without any major ups and downs. The trail passes through Sky Meadows State Park. Close to the southern border of the park is a bench that we were very grateful for, as there were few rocks or logs. While we were eating our lunches, the ridge runner Witt and a few of his friends came running by. I enjoyed seeing him again. The remaining 2.7 miles to Whiskey Hollow Shelter were predominantly downhill and easy.

I’ve decided to switch to titling my entries to something that struck me during the day. Today was very pleasant trail for the most part. Isn’t this how you picture the AT?  Now make it 89* feeling like 92 and see what fun it is. Add in a toe blister and it’s better than a misery but still still short of a good time. Walking along, this verse from Psalms came into my head. Don’t ask why. That’s the nature of walking in the woods. It can be a show tune, a Christmas carol, a memory or a fantasy. It is seldom profound, being of necessity pedestrian. 
What struck me about this verse today was the notion that I don’t get to define what the day is and say that it’s only a day that the Lord made when things are all to my liking. My only role is to acknowledge it and to rejoice and be glad, even when I’m miserable. So I’ll do my little happy dance now and move on. 
Red made it into the shelter about 6:30. She sleeps late and hikes late. We are curious to see if she makes it here today. She studied geology in college and worked for Americorps in Silver Springs, Fl. She’s perky. 
Rocky and I alternated leading this morning.  The trail was empty so leading meant breaking spiderwebs. Lots of them. How many calories are burned in breaking 100 webs?  When we finally saw someone coming from the opposite direction, we all rejoiced. “I’m so glad to see you,” we all said, meaning it will be so nice to hike without breaking spiderwebs. Actually they were a lovely couple, developing a line of trail food based on Low Country Cuisine. Shrimp and Grits sounds mighty good to me!
From VA Route 50, the trail gains about 600’ and crosses a meadow in full sun. I applied sunscreen first, but it was just melting down my face. I am so thankful that the shelter tonight has a solar shower piped from a nearby spring. Heaven!  We also had a brief sun shower that did nothing but add steam to the heat and humidity.

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643012,"Rocky Raccoon and I were cooking our dinners last night, meaning heating water to rehydrate stuff, when two 20-something women came into the shelter area. They let us know that Red is staying at the previous shelter. Regina is a few months from completing her RN, after earning her bachelors degree in psychology. Christina has just received her CPA certificate and has been working in international taxation. It just goes to prove the riff-raff you find on the AT.  Christina’s specialty may serve her well. She met an English guy on the internet who is an international intellectual property attorney. Christina visited him in England and the relationship deepened. Christina is now awaiting her English visa and they will be married a few months after that. Christina and her best friend Regina are on a bachelorette party hike, and Rocky and I were invited guests last night, complete with splits of red wine. The wine went great with our ersatz stroganoff and we talked into the night. What a grand adventure for Christina!  Regina impresses us as having the makings of the kind of nurse that patients will remember with kindness for a lifetime. We were so impressed with the two of them. 
I never attended a bachelor party. Let’s face it, straight men don’t want a gay guy hanging around who might not appreciate the evening’s entertainment. So being invited to a sylvan bachelorette party felt very special. I was greatly honored. 
The 5.2 mile hike to the US 522 trailhead by the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute went quickly, and we had an easy time hitching into Front Royal. Rocky has never hitched before and this was a good introduction — a middle aged lady driving an old Honda Accord that doubled as a rubbish container and an ash tray. We were able to get into a room at the Belmont Inn, formerly known as the Quality Inn, without delay. It is not luxurious, but the shower ran even though the tub didn’t drain. Actually the shower stopped between my shower and Rocky going in, but everything has been fixed now. Their guest laundry featured two washers and two dryers, one of each worked. Unfortunately the adjoining Thai restaurant is closed for emergency ventilation hood repairs. I had my heart set on crispy duck. We walked down to Main St Mill and sat outside in the shade. I had a Cobb salad and Rocky the taco salad.  The IPA I had from Williamsburg was wimpy by Vermont standards, but was cold and wet. The plates were returned clean. 
The restaurant and all businesses have mandatory mask mandates, but with the exception of the outfitter, masks were uncommon. Covid is not taken seriously here; the local vaccination rate is under 50% we were told. We are mystified. 
It was 92* feeling like 95 in Front Royal this afternoon as we accomplished our chores. Rocky didn’t need much, but I needed some food for Shenandoah National Park. I won’t be carrying everything I need because there are lots of opportunities to buy stuff inside the park. I bought additional blister care compresses. My toes are much better today, but I’ve decided to take a zero tomorrow with no chores but rest. Brother Ass deserves it. My plan is to continue taking it relatively easy through Shenandoah and Rocky’s departure. Then we’ll see!  Maybe the weather will finally break. 
The heat has really suppressed my appetite, but back in the air conditioned motel room, it is awakening. There’s a microbrewery across the street that tempts me. Rocky may forego it.","Jim & Molly Denton Shelter

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643123,"I allowed myself to be tempted by Pavemint Taphouse and Grill across the street last night. I’m easy. An IPA and a big fat juicy burger topped with bacon relish and bleu cheese and, of course a side of fries, made up for my lunch salad. Raccoons are not profligate in their appetites, so Rocky went without. One meal a day satisfies her. Arrrrgh!  
Do you ever wonder how a hiker spends a zero day, especially when the necessary chores like laundry and grocery shopping are done the day before?  There isn’t much to say. I slept late for me and then read in bed until Rocky awoke at 7:30 or so. I made coffee in the room and enjoyed blueberries and strawberries from the grocery. It was enough. Rocky went out to the pool. I showered and we walked up to the CVS.  I wanted to refresh my supply of Compeed blister treatments. And finally in the nearby Dollar General, I found instant coffee sticks similar to the Starbucks. I found I don’t want a cup of hot coffee on these beastly hot days, but the coffee is delightful mixed in with Carnation Essentials.
I was hungry after the short walk. Rocky joined me back at Pavemint and had a pint of wheat beer; no food.  I had a chopped salad with 4 oz of their slow smoked brisket and a local red ale. Yummy!  Rocky is back at the pool, but I’m luxuriating in the air conditioning. Tonight will be delivered Chinese. I’ve arranged for a taxi back to the trail in the morning and made a reservation at the Pinnacles in Skyland Resort for Saturday.  Brother Ass will appreciate this stable.
So mostly a zero day is about doing nothing, eating and resting being the priorities. I’ve started Brothers Karamazov and am savoring the narrator who combines omniscience with interior monologue of the featured character to the point of mimicking their speech. How can I feel sympathy for such a loathsome character as Fyodor Pavlovich?  That is the genius of Dostoevsky. As a reader, I am as manipulated as his characters. 
Oh, I did one more thing today. The motel has suspended their breakfast buffet because of Covid. So I found a place that opens at 6:00 about a block away. I’ll go alone.","Front Royal, VA

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643289,"I fell asleep early last night while Rocky watched the Paralympics. So she was sleeping when I woke up, showered, and walked to breakfast. I sat at the counter and enjoyed a mushroom and cheese omelette, but mostly I enjoyed the older guy next to me with a long yellowish white beard. He works as a stone mason when he isn’t wrangling snakes. He hold federal permits for the collection and transportation of venomous snakes and has a 1959 Plymouth hearse outfitted with a climate controlled container in the back. His pet George is an eight foot timber rattlesnake. He assures me that cobra venom is a better high than peyote. Is Snakeman real? My reporting is true. Beyond that?
Our taxi was waiting for us at 8:15 for the short drive to the trail head. Lifting my pack out of the back of the cab, it seemed a little light to me. As the taxi sped back toward Front Royal, I figured it out. My water bladder and bottle were sitting in the refrigerator back at the motel. I phoned the dispatcher and pretty soon our driver, nicknamed Soda Pop by the dispatcher, was back. Rocky waited with the packs while I fetched my water, for an additional two fares. 
It’s a long slow climb to Possum Ridge,  the boundary of Shenandoah National Park. The first part again follows the fence of the Smithsonian Compound. We could see a herd of something on a far hillside, but we couldn’t tell what they were.  There used to be a sign on the fence warning that trespassers would be eaten. I’ve seen eland and oryx on previous hikes. 
Just inside the park boundary is a self-registration kiosk.  I find it so awkward trying to write with a tiny golf pencil with my big hands, but we got it done.  The contrast between the wide open forest and groomed trail of the park with the standard trail from US 522 to the Park is striking. I kept looking for Munchkins but we saw only turkeys. On past hikes, the climbs of Compton and Marshall have been unremarkable, but with the heat and humidity, we suffered. We met a couple of day hikers from Long Island at the summit of Marshall. They were confused about which trail to take to get back to their vehicle. Fortunately, they chose the way we were going, and the AT led to a parking area with their car. They were kind enough to take our picture from one of the overlooks. There really wasn’t much of a view, just haze. 
We finally got to the Gravel Springs Hut about 5:30, just as it was threatening to storm. We set up our tents on the dirt platforms provided and brought our food and cooking stuff down to the hut. In Shenandoah National Park, the shelters are called huts and were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps nearly 90 years ago from local stone and timber. They look their age. The thunderstorm hit with tremendous fury, vivid lightening and horizontal rain. We were in the good company of five flip-floppers who have been hiking together since the 100-Mile Wilderness in Maine. They all started in Harpers Ferry in the Spring, hiking north to Katahdin and then returning to Harpers Ferry and hiking south to Georgia. Needless to say, they are much faster than us, so it was a one night stand. Too bad — we liked them. I was particularly taken with a young woman named Spirit. While Rocky and I cooked our dinners, they were occupied with dessert, making s’mores over a camp stove. 
I returned to my tent after dinner to find that three stakes had pulled loose in the storm, causing my tent to flood. I had to bail it out with my cup and dry it using my headband as a sponge. Fortunately my sleeping bag was floating on top of my sleeping pad and was only slightly damp. All in all it was a miserable night. I’m grateful that we survived the heat, the storm and my little flood. And we made some new friends.","Front Royal, VA

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643290,"My pack was heavy this morning with everything wet. We hiked the 5.6 miles to Elkwallow Wayside arriving just before their grill opened at 11:00. Waysides in the Park are combination grills and camp stores, good for short term resupply. I spread everything on the grassy lawn in full sunshine to dry. Meanwhile I enjoyed a grilled cheese sandwich and a mountain blackberry milkshake. This is only wayside that makes real milkshakes, with ice cream and milk, so I felt obligated. The five flip-flippers were there and have named their trail family (tramily), the Bedazzled Thongs. The thongs are a reference to flip-flop sandals. They took off while my kit dried in the sun. 
I can’t say for sure if it was the milk shake, the heat and humidity, or the combination of both, but I was exceptionally slow on the ups this afternoon. We finally got to Pass Mountain Hut and were the only ones here. There is a good flowing piped spring just behind the shelter and a new mouldering privy. There’s also a pair of “kissing” trees. After last night, we are staying in the shelter tonight. A flip-flopper Curmudgeon came in and is tenting beyond the privy. Later, the self-proclaimed last of the northbound thru-hikers, Easy Does It,  came and hammocked near the spring. 
There was a brief rain shower after we got to the shelter, but nothing like a repeat of last night. I’m grateful for that.","Gravel Springs Hut

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643291,"My apologies for delays in posting. Reception in Shenandoah National Park is iffy. Even here at Skyland Resort the WiFi is unreliable (read useless). 
This was another difficult day for us. It wasn’t quite as hot and humid, but still enough for us to need extra water and electrolyte solution. The total ascent was 3,000’ today. After a short downhill to Thornton Gap, the trail climbs to Mary’s Rock, about 1,100’. On the way up, I met a man Mentor 382 coming down. He and his friend suffered heat exhaustion yesterday and were curtailing their hike. I could have hugged him. I’ve been wondering if it were just me and maybe I had a heart problem, but seeing the way this weather is affecting others has been strangely reassuring. I offered to walk him back to Thornton Gap, but he refused. I had no trouble on this climb, just drifting up at a steady rate. Rocky was cursing Mary by the time she got up. I was afraid she was cursing the Blessed Virgin, but it turns out that many many years ago, a woman named Mary rescued two bear cubs whose mother had been killed and carried them down to the gap. 
We stopped at Byrd’s Nest #3 Hut for a break. I fetched water for us from a gushing spring, unfortunately 0.6 miles downhill on a fire road. Had I been thinking, I would have skipped it since we could have gotten water at Pinnacle Picnic Area. We did spot a very brave bunny at the hut, however, so the time spent was not wasted. Bunny allowed us to within 10 feet. We climbed the Pinnacle and stopped at the picnic area, sharing our lunches with some very persistent yellow jackets. Then came the climb of Stony Man Mountain, topping out just shy of 4,000’ elevation. The trail around Skyland has been temporary relocated for some construction, and the relo was difficult to follow. It seemed endless to get to the Skyland Office. We were in time for the 4:00 checkin. I wisely reserved a room in Pinnacles, the rooms closest to the Lodge and the dining room. Walking into our air conditioned room felt like heaven, exceeded only by a shower. There isn’t a guest laundry here, so I washed out my hiking clothes in the shower. It was truly disgusting, torrents of mud washing off the clothes and off me. I actually cleaned the tub before Rocky took her shower. 
The Park is near capacity. I hadn’t reserved a campsite at Big Meadow for tomorrow night. Tomorrow should be an easy day, with all elevations within a narrow 500’ band, and only 7.9 miles. I realized that if the campground were full, It would be another 7.8 miles to the next hut. Rocky would rebel against that and I would rebel against myself. So while Rocky showered, I reserved an air conditioned room in the lodge at Big Meadows for tomorrow. In 2015, I forgot to specify air conditioning and suffered greatly  
Dinner at Skyland was delightful. There was a 35 minute wait for the dining room, so we sat in the tap room. We had an elfin server Larry who allowed us to order from the dining room menu. I started with a side salad with a mountain blackberry vinaigrette. Delicious except that the blackberry seeds had not been strained out, creating a texture of ground glass. The rainbow trout with wild rice and perfectly sautéed fresh yellow squash and zucchini more than made up for it. A glass of local Sauvignon blanc has me feeling mellow. I had no room for the mountain blackberry ice cream pie. Maybe tomorrow night. Rocky equally enjoyed an Impossible burger and sweet potato fries. 
It looks like Hurricane Ida May affect us Tuesday night and Wednesday as a heavy rain event with enough wind to topple trees. I’ll try to arrange a shuttle pickup at Swift Run Gap on Tuesday afternoon and a motel stay in Elkton for Tuesday and Wednesday nights. It seems like the prudent thing to do. I’ve seen shelters crushed by falling trees, not to mention tents!I’m up early on Sunday morning. Still no useable internet, but I have two bars on Verizon and can post the last three days.","Pass Mountain Hut

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643305,"Today was the easiest hike yet. I wouldn’t leave until after breakfast which isn’t served until 7:30.  I’m grumpy from not sleeping well. I kept thinking about Hurricane Ida expected to drop several inches of rain on the Virginia mountains mid-week. It doesn’t take much wind to knock down a tree with waterlogged roots. I’ve seen what a falling tree can do to a trail shelter, not to mention a tent, so we are now planning to go into Elkton Tuesday afternoon and return to the trail Thursday morning, assuming I can arrange a shuttle and lodging. Yet another zero day!
Even with the late start, we got to Big Meadow Lodge about 12:30. The desk clerk assured me that our room would not be ready until 3:30 at the earliest and said we couldn’t leave our packs in the lobby. The little twerp!  He suggested we leave them in our car. So we wore our packs into the dining room, and they were cool with that. I’m not really hungry. BBQ pork sliders, an appetizer, and a local lager filled the bill. Rocky had a Blue Moon, saving her appetite for tonight. 
The trail today took us past the stables at Skyland, with the horses getting ready for a day of trail riding. They seemed quite content, especially the one in the pasture getting a day off. Do horses gloat?  He seemed to be. There were no views today, with cloud below us (see photo).  As the morning progressed, the cloud rose and we were hiking in fog. There was one area lush with ferns that felt very bearish to both of us, but we saw none. 
I don’t know why, but I’ve always preferred Skyland to Big Meadow. The staff at Skyland seems much more attuned to hikers. One advantage here is the proximity of Big Meadows Wayside (0.9 mile following the road) and the opportunity for the best resupply in the park. After we get checked in and inventory our food, we’ll probably walk down, making sure to get some no cook dinners in case we are stranded at the motel in Elkton by the storm.","Skyland Resort
",Big Meadow Lodge,"Aug 29, Sun",7.90
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643369,"We walked down to Big Meadows Wayside yesterday after we showered.  It’s a very nice walk on an asphalt path following the resort entrance road, about 0.9 miles mostly level. We arrived at the Wayside at 5:15, fifteen minutes past their closing.  Bummer!  We got confused on the way back, ending up at the amphitheater, but we were rewarded with many many deer, showing very little fear of people. One stood patiently under an apple tree while a park volunteer shook loose apples higher than it could reach. With his good directions, we found the lodge and went straight to the dining room. 
Rocky ordered the mushroom ravioli with spinach and garlic Texas toast and left an absolutely clean plate. I ordered the half roast chicken with a blackberry piquant glaze. It was done nicely, accompanied by mashed potatoes (instant?) and green beans cooked to uniform grayness but lacking any redeeming fatback or flavor. Is it so difficult to blanche green beans before service and then quickly sauté them in a little butter, with fresh thyme?  Apparently so.  The French generic Pinot noir was nicely acidic, but lacked any nuance or complexity of flavor. For hikers, the alcohol counts for something. 
I was an especially harsh critic last night because my feet were itching and burning and have been since the third day of the hike. This was a new experience for me. I couldn’t blame the shoes; they fit perfectly. I’ve used Superfeet insoles for decades. I lie awake last night considering my feet, not my accustomed nighttime meditation. About 10PM it struck me — athletes’ feet!  In my prehike entries, I wrote extensively about jock itch, monkey butt, and other manifestations of the fungus Tinea spp. and how I carry a small tube of 1% Clotrimazole creme. I smeared it on my feet and between my toes. Lo!  It’s a miracle!  I’m cured!  I’ll continue using it for a couple of days.
I went to breakfast at 7:30, having two eggs over easy, two sausage links, a fresh fruit cup, a pancake and coffee. Rocky had coffee in the room. We left Big Meadows about 9;00, took several breaks, and still arrived at Lewis Mountain Campground around 1:00. The only noteworthy sighting was some bear scat on the final up, fresh enough not to have been discovered by flies. I truly hope that Rocky gets to see an actual bear. 
It was sunny when we arrived at Lewis Mountain, but thunderstorms are forecast.  They happened to have a cabin available for a very good price. It is two bedrooms with a connecting bathroom, two front porches, a covered patio with a picnic table and fire ring/grill, and a private bear box and bear-proof trash can. After freshening up, we enjoyed a beverage and light snacks from the camp store. I really liked the 16 oz can of Sterling IPA, brewed in Charlottesville, Virginia, beautifully balanced but still gulpable after a hike and costing $1.69. Beer is less expensive than soft drinks in the park. We had an early dinner since the camp store closes at 6, a microwaved pepperoni calzone for Raccoon and a microwaved chicken sandwich for me. Honestly, it wasn’t bad.
It has started to rain and is bordering on being chilly. Tomorrow we have eight miles mostly downhill to Swift Run Gap for a 2PM pickup by the motel in Elkton, Virginia to sit out the flash flood warning.","Big Meadow Lodge

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643382,"It’s not the trail. Shenandoah National Park is some of the easiest hiking on the Appalachian Trail. It’s not my intrepid cousin Rocky Raccoon. She can hike!  No, it’s me, or rather it’s my knees. 
After I had to abort my 2018 thru-hike attempt because of knee pain, I tried physical therapy again, without success. Tom and I visited Bar Harbor, Maine later that year, and I could manage no more than a one-mile cliff top walk. So in 2019, I had my knees replaced. I worked hard in rehab and continued to strengthen my legs at the Y. The results exceeded my expectations, including being able to hike the Camels Hump Loop on the Long Trail. The only limitation I found was difficulty kneeling and getting up from the ground without turning turtle. So a thru-hike seemed possible. I wouldn’t know unless I tried. 
Even taking full advantage of the facilities of the National Park, keeping the daily mileage low, and taking an unplanned zero day in Front Royal, I found that I was having knee “discomfort” earlier each day. I overcame big toe blisters and athlete’s feet. I learned to cope with the heat and humidity.  But the day-to-day pounding of backpacking took its toll on my knees.  
The easy walk from Lewis Mountain Campground to Swift Run Gap this morning was the final straw. My knees were swelling and warm to the touch, meaning inflammation. Okay, I’ve found my limit. I couldn’t have found what I can’t do any other way than by trying it. 
I don’t feel sad or sorry for myself. I can do so much with the knee replacements that I couldn’t do before. And now I know my limits, which are still far beyond what most guys my age ever attempt. Life is good. 
The shuttle driver from the Country View Motel in Elkton, Virginia met us as scheduled at 2:00, to the minute. The motel is very nice and the people here are a joy, so eager to please. They’ve given us an emergency lantern for the room, in case the power fails in the coming storm.  There’s a country store just down the road  with some of the best fried chicken I’ve ever eaten. The Mac & Cheese side is addictive. The green beans are as gray as Big Meadows, but what a difference!  These were simmered with a ham hock, onion, and large diced red potatoes. Flavor trumps nutrition. So we’ll sit tight tomorrow and shuttle to Charlottesville on Thursday. Rocky will take Amtrak home. I’m using my Delta Skymiles to fly.","Lewis Mountain Campground 
",Swift Run Gap,"Aug 31, Tue",8.20
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643617,"Confession:  I had so many Delta Skymiles from using American Express that I booked first class.  That gave me room to stretch out and keep my legs comfortable.  And the beverage service was a plus.  It took three flights to get home, Charlottesville to Atlanta, Atlanta to Detroit, and Detroit to Burlington.  The first flight was an hour late taking off.  On the pilots’ walk-around, they noticed evidence of a bird strike and we had to wait for the mechanics to check for any engine damage.  They didn’t say what sort of bird it was, whether sparrow or snow goose, or half a roasted chicken or even a rubber chicken.  I was the first one off the plane in Atlanta (a big advantage of first class) and had 11 minutes to get from near the end of Concourse D to Concourse B, making it just in time.  Surprisingly, my pack did as well.  Then we sat another 30 minutes, waiting for two pilots who were being repositioned to Detroit.  I was starting to regret not taking Amtrak, except that Rocky Raccoon had a most miserable experience getting home.  She was booked on a  6:45 AM train to New York City and then the train to Albany, but thanks to Ida, trains were not running north of Washington.  So she spent a night in Charlottesville and then flew home on Friday.  
I washed my down sleeping bag and puffy on Friday, and they are nice and fluffy again and no longer smell of hiker funk.  Then yesterday, I cleaned all my other gear and stored it away.  So now I’m ready for my next backpacking adventure.  But wait, there won’t be any, barring a miracle with my knees.  I should feel sad, and friends have expressed condolences, but I am not feeling sorry for myself.  It definitely marks a change in my outlook and it means finding some other way to get my wilderness fix.  
Remember John Muir?  He wrote that “in Wilderness lies the hope of the world.”  Or Henry David Thoreau?  “We need the tonic of wildness…We can never have enough nature.”
I get a microdose of wilderness from my condominium, looking out over Lake Champlain to the high peaks of the Adirondacks, but it succeeds only in filling me with longing to be in the mountains, to feel the heartbeat of our frail little planet.  I’m home all of three days and the yearning has already begun.  
Backpacking is over for me.  If I say it often enough, I will believe it.  But day hiking, and even European-style hiking from inn to inn, with luggage being transferred, seems possible.  Perhaps I could basecamp in a hotel or rental, someplace with lots of trails.  Rocky Raccoon has suggested Saranac Lake, New York.  Tom might enjoy that, and the thought of combining day hiking with fine dining is not unattractive!  I can even fantasize about doing le tour du Mont Blanc!  
Backpacking won’t be the first thing I’ve had to give up with age.  In 2002, my primary care physician staged an intervention with a rheumatologist and an orthopedic surgeon to convince me to give up running, something I had done almost daily for decades.  That was difficult, and I still find myself running in my dreams.  The running often leads to flying, which is even more fun. So the concept of finding that age adds constraints to my life is not new to me.  But you know what?  Constraints don’t have to be a bad thing.
My favorite English choral music is Tudor anthems from the 16th century.  The Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cramner decreed that composers should write one note per syllable so that the words might be made intelligible to the people.  What a dreadful constraint in a time of florid melisma!  There would be no excess of Catholic ornamentation in Protestant England.  Yet composers like Thomas Tallis and William Byrd (both Catholics, by the way) thrived and wrote works of sheer genius and even managed to keep their heads.  Cramner, on the other hand, was burned at the stake.  Or consider the pipe organ, the king of instruments.  There are only so many ranks and stops available on a given organ, but a skilled musician can create wonders! 
The point I’m trying to make is that creativity thrives with constraint as much as with freedom.  The constraints placed upon me by age in general, and my knees in particular, do not limit my life.  They only enhance it.  And one day when I’m confined to a rocking chair or to a bed, my fantasies shall be free to take full flight, perhaps even carrying me to the Gates of Heaven.",,View Entry,"Sep 05, Sun",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643850,"My last entry is titled “Coda,” which means concluding remarks or a final section.  So technically, there can be no post-coda. This is really the coda and I should redesignate the previous entry as penultimate.   Live with it.
The sudden burst of maturity and acceptance I showed in my last entry may have been premature.  I was ready to give up backpacking and accept the apparent limitations of my knee replacements.  Or at least, I kept trying to convince myself to believe it, but the whole time, there’s been a little nagging voice in my head, the voice of denial.  I should have known that I couldn’t skip the first four stages of grief (denial, anger, bargaining and depression) and jump straightaway to acceptance.  It would be like an alcoholic jumping from admitting to being powerless over alcohol to a full-blown spiritual awakening and evangelical fervor without the intervening steps.
So I decided to seek out an objective opinion.  Not having a cat around to ask, who would be better than the physical therapist who guided me through my knee rehabilitations?  Jack earned his doctorate of physical therapy and is a board certified clinical specialist in orthopedics.  He’s also an ultra-runner, cyclist, mountain biker and wake surfer.  So he understands the importance of exercise to both physical, mental and spiritual well-being.  Who better to ask than a fellow zealot?
When I tried making an appointment with Jack, I was told that he was no longer at the practice where I had met him.  They were kind enough to tell me his new association, and I met with him yesterday morning.  The new practice has a resident Corgi named Tilley.  That is sufficient reason to change practices.  
I sketched out for Jack how I had continued my rehabilitation since I had last met with him, alternating walks with two different routines at the Y, so that I was taking a long walk every third day, and the graduated series of day hikes I had taken prior to the thru-hike attempt.  I told him about starting to have knee swelling, inflammation, and discomfort in the second week of this hike, in spite of reducing distances and taking a day off, and the problem coming earlier each day.  He asked me some good questions and then thought about it.  His conclusion?  He believes that if I work hard the next six months, I will be ready to start yet another thru-hike attempt in April and this time, succeed!  I made him promise that he wasn’t just humoring me, and he swears he isn’t, but that it will be arduous on my part.
The key will be convincing my knees that life is a bitch and it isn’t going to get any better so they had better adapt.  (I purposely omitted commas because it’s one continuous thought, even a threat.)  That’s my translation of building tissue tolerance.  My knees may find their home in a gay man, but they are not allowed to be mollycoddles.  Jack has instructed me to start walking on successive days, starting with two days a week, alternating an 8-10 mile day with a shorter 4-5 mile day, like interval training, gradually increasing the shorter distance and adding successive days.  Some of the days will be walking up and down the hills of Burlington, some of which like Depot Street and Cliff Street are quite steep.  My morning routine includes 2-1/2 miles of walking now, so I’ll go out for another 6 or 7 miles this afternoon.  Fall has started in Burlington, with today’s high forecast at 68*, so it should be pleasant.  
When I have worked up to 5-6 days of walking a week, then I’ll add a weighted vest, working up to my fully-loaded pack weight of 25 pounds.  I am to continue my stretching and foam rolling protocols as well as my strength building and at the Y at least four days a week. I need to continue the walking even in winter.  The City plows half of the bike path, leaving the other half for cross-country skiing.  It’s a good thing that I am retired, because this training program sounds like a full-time job.  
If all goes well, I’ll start a new journal under the 2022 tab as spring approaches.  I am an inveterate planner as well as an optimist, so I’m already thinking about where and when to start my hike.  Easter comes late in 2022, not until April 17, and I would like to fulfill my commitment to the choir at the Episcopal Cathedral (they tolerate me), so I’ll probably start in Harpers Ferry in late April, maybe attending the Flip-Flop Festival, if Covid permits it to be held.  My fourth attempt at a thru-hike is bound to succeed, right?  What could go wrong?  So please stay tuned, and thank you for your support!",,View Entry,"Sep 10, Fri",0
