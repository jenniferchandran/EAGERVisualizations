Legacy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636659,"Hi, I'm Legacy from Rochester, NY. In 2019, I began hiking the Appalachian Trail, and from March 6 until July 15, I hiked from Springer Mountain, GA to Kent, CT, a distance of 1,469 miles or 2/3 of the AT.Now, I would like to continue where I left off, and see if I can hike the remainder of the trail to Mount Katahdin in Maine. My 2019 hike humbled me, but I am ready and willing to try. I will be making occasional weekly entries to this journal. Let the journey begin!",,View Entry,"May 09, Sun",0
Legacy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637117,"In 2019, I hiked from Springer Mountain, GA to Kent, CT, a total of 1470.1 miles, or 2/3 of the AT. When I finished, I was physically depleted and exhausted. I had wanted to thru-hike the AT, and after giving it my best shot, I thought that was that. 
But life sometimes presents second chances. I thought of areas I could change that might present the opportunity to complete my hike, because that's what I'm looking for: opportunities, not guarantees, because on the AT the only guarantee is that you will be humbled. 
I did many things well in preparing for my 2019 hike. I modeled my gear list after a young Rochester woman who was both an ADK 46R and an AT thru-hiker. But toward the end, I also did some things wrong: I violated the AT's mantra - ""hike your own hike"" - by not taking zeros I badly needed because I chose to remain with a hiking partner who eschewed them.
Now at age 68, I knew I would have to make changes if I wanted to reach my objective. A pack for a 22 year old is too heavy for me. So, these are the changes I made: (1) Reduce my pack weight, by buying a lighter tent, quilt, backpack and other gear (2) Performed 4 months of physical therapy for my hip and core, supervised by my selfless P.T. daughter, (3) Improved my training regimen in anticipation of the AT, and (4) Reworked my AT diet to include more calories and protein, things I normally don't analyze in my everyday life.
Will these changes be sufficient? I finished the AT at about the same weight as when I started, which remains my weight to this day - an indication that I continue to have the svelte body that women drool over. Obviously, being a superbly trained athlete, such as my friend Rick would say, is not the only factor. The only way I can answer the question about whether I can finish the AT is to go back on the trail and try. So that is what I will do.
Of course, it could come down to ""mental toughness"", which could put me at a severe disadvantage. I score much higher in the ""mental fluffness"" category!",,View Entry,"May 15, Sat",0
Legacy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637126,"My wife and I drove down the day before my drop-off and stayed in a motel. The motel's wifi password was ""Adventure"", which I viewed as a good omen, well, it was much better than ""Disaster"" or ""CrashAndBurn"". After a delicious deli lunch in Kent, CT, we hugged after taking the requisite ""1st day going back to school"" pictures before I headed out on the trail. It wasn't until I got to St John's Ledges, with a short but steep descent, that I was reminded that I was no longer in Mendon Ponds Park where I do my training. Still, I arrived at the shelter where I met One Eyed Jack and newbie hiker Frank.
Tuesday began with a flat start along the Housatonic River. At Guinea Brook, the water was raging, and I wondered ""how the hell are people getting across? I don't see any bodies flowing downstream!"" Truth is, they weren't crossing, and my Guthook app noted a detour back to the road and around. Then there was a short lemon squeezer between rocks. Looking in the logbook at the shelter, I found an entry from my last hiking partner during my 2019 AT hike. The day after I left, he hooked up with another hiker. I felt jilted! ""Huh? After 5 weeks, I meant nothin' to him!"" That two-timer!
Wednesday was another in a series of days with wonderful weather, as I was awakened by the sound of woodpeckers and birds. Moving along the trail that morning, I met a wild turkey hunter. (Actually, in his camouflage outfit he appeared more civilized than wild.) We chatted awhile, me being very polite (as I always am when addressing someone with a firearm!) Technically, hunting is not allowed on the AT but I decided not to mention it because, as I said, he had a firearm! Later that day, I met my first NOBO thru-hiker, Crypta, who started Feb 17 and looked every bit the part of a fast hiker. Crypta is a professional juggler, but with Covid, he had no gigs to juggle and instead is juggling the demands of hiking.
Thursday was a day for milestones, as I passed Giant's Thumb, a unique glacial rock, as well as the 1500 mile marker. I was surprised there wasn't a 1500 mile marker when I arrived, but there was one when I left, made by a skilled artisan - moi! - who chooses to remain anonymous.  I had a surprise lunch with Joe, a hiker from CT who I met on the Northville Placid Trail in 2018 and who has been both a good friend and AT mentor to me. Joe drove over an hour to pick me up from the trail so we could share lunch, memories and stories. Thanks, Joe! I ended the day with a short stretch with Colin, a NY Times reporter. I asked if he had written any books, and he said not yet, but I have a hunch that if he ever writes about ""Mountain Men on the AT"", I will be in chapter 1. Later I met Temple U. student Teddy Bear at the shelter. 
On Friday, I crossed Bear Mountain, the highest peak in CT, before entering MA. It was bittersweet, because CT's terrain fit my hiking preference - not too high, not too low - and because CT does a great job of trail maintenance. The Sages Ravine in MA was flowing well and a treat to hike beside, but presented a tricky crossing at the end that I was thankful to successfully maneuver without taking a spill. The afternoon was arduous, with two peaks, and left me deflated. However, I met Tom, a 46R from Lake Placid, at the shelter and enjoyed his company. Still, it was a bit unnerving when, at 1015pm, I awoke to two hikers thrashing around in the dark trying to find the bear box to put their food. (I found out today it was Teddy Bear and Colin! - one of many good reasons to finish your hike in daylight!)
Today included a descent into Great Barrington for a mail drop and a motel room. The Fire Dept may have to hose me off and fumigate me to make me presentable to the townsfolk. It is a bustling, upscale tourist town on the weekend, and a stark contrast to the trail. Still, the town has its charm. The trail doesn't have a 4 piece jazz band playing in the evening.
Overall, I'm satisfied with my slow but steady progress. There are far fewer hikers than I expected, but that should change with time. The gear choices I agonized over are performing as designed. The weather has been great. CT and MA both provide bear boxes at shelters, which is a great convenience to someone like me. We will see what the next week brings.","
","Great Barrington, MA","May 15, Sat",53.70
Legacy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637549,"On Sunday, May 16, I left Great Barrington and hitched a ride back to the trail, in a style befitting my status. A former thru-hiker picked me up for my very first ride - in a BMW! (I know, you were thinking a burned out pick-up. ) I'm sure glad I got cleaned up in town, for his benefit as well as mine. It was an easy hike to a shelter with a beautiful setting. For the second time I would be solo that night, but a local couple passed through on a walk.  Although they said many bears were in the area, they reconfirmed that storing food in the bear box eliminated problems.
On Monday, my water bag for filtering water started to leak. I did not have cell service, so I decided to run 3 tests with my wife Cynthia, the Commander in Mission Control. They consisted of: (1) test whether I could send a hunt and peck satellite message to her (as foretold by the 1970's song ""Radar Love"": ""I  send a message coming in from above. We don't need a letter or phone! We got a thing called Radar Love.""), (2) test if she receives it and sends me replacements, and (3) most likely, test her patience. And, yes!, all three tests were met, especially testing her patience. After all that work, I had a snack while viewing Benedict Pond.
Shaker campsite was known to be the home of two sows (female bears), one with three cubs. I was cautious as well as surprised when I arrived and saw a bear sleeping halfway up a tree, and monitored it for movement. I met Gnarley and Pyro that evening but went in my tent before the bear came down. The next morning I looked and it was still there - the black bulbous growth was part of a bare tree, not a bear tree!
Mission Control had done a fine job the previous day, but on Tuesday a new message was received: ""Houston, we have a problem!"" Apparently the cruise director- moi! - had scheduled a hostel stay over Memorial Day weekend. Great, except the hostel didn't open until June! The Commander found a motel - at holiday rates - that would keep me on track. And it comes with such pride - I'm single handedly reinvigorating New England's economy. 
On Tuesday, I met a wonderful college couple, Scoots and Flowrider, and later Mr. Clean, a superbly fit 59 year old, all section hiking. It was a great day, with the scent of pine needles roasted by the sun. The trail is comprised of ""rocks and roots"" and sometimes dirt, and in sections all that is hidden beneath piles of leaves. I had fallen a few times so far, but saved the best for when I pitched forward after stubbing a rock and did a face plant. As it is, I am unusually cautious about where I step, so I don't think the fall knocked any sense into me, but also I don't think it knocked any sense out of me, which is fortunate because, as my friends can attest, I don't have any to spare. 
My campsite that night was Upper Goose Pond cabin, which was closed, but the view from the beach and dock were outstanding, with lots of 6 inch fish swimming. That night I met Decap and Pinky. Pinky and I have so much in common, we could be twins! His trailname is Pinky, some of my friends call me Brownie. His trail shoes are Hoka Speedgoats - so are mine! He runs in Brooks shoes - so do I! He is in his 20's in both age and daily mileage - so am...uh, I guess the similarities stop there. Not twins!
Flash back to last Saturday, when I walked past a field with sheep. I got a group photo after they saw I was a kindred spirit when I said the secret password ""Baa-Ram-Ewe"". Fast forward to Wednesday, when a doe ran across the trail as Terrapin and I were approaching each other. We started chatting when a hidden fawn (or, shall we say, an ""unspotted spotted fawn!"") raced after her. After leaving Terrapin, I was going up the hill when the fawn, having looped around, came charging down the trail at me, the doe in hot pursuit. I jumped into action, shouting ""Baa-Ram-Ewe"", and when that had no effect, shouted a different phrase which was more effective, and the pair veered into the woods. Unfortunately, that meant venison was not on the dinner menu that night. 
Later I had my lunch at Finerty Pond, where a six engine propeller plane flew low over me. Unfortunately, the day was warm and not liking the water sources, I didn't drink enough water and I got a headache that lasted a day. But at the shelter I met two chefs from Albany who were starting a ""six month hike"". They both had ""freshmen backpacks"", and after hiking 9 miles were already looking at sending gear home. They were funny!
Thursday was an easy hike to the Kay Wood shelter, with nice tentsites and water access. Friday was a short hike into Dalton, MA, to pick up a maildrop, eat some food, before going to a campsite. 
I have had some issues. A couple mornings I was reluctant to get up, which surprised me because it is going far better than I expected. With shorter mileage, I have been more content on the trail than ever before. On reflection I decided the emotions were a combination of homesickness, loneliness and a fear of being alone on the trail. Being a guy, I'm ill-suited to address such things as emotions - I am the poster child for Lynyrd Skynyrd's song ""Simple Man"". However, I find that once I start hiking, I am much better, so the answer is to hike. Another issue I didn't expect is some fatigue despite my low mileage. I hope to increase my daily calories to help compensate. That's all for now, Folks!","
","Dalton, MA","May 21, Fri",48.30
Legacy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637920,"While in Dalton, MA, on Friday, May 21, I had hoped to get a shower at their community center, but was not able to due to covid policy. The waitresses at Dalton Restaurant were much more welcoming, serving me breakfast and lunch while allowing me to recharge my devices and repack my maildrop from home. That evening at a campsite, I met Drew and Jay, weekend section hikers who were funny and welcoming. This was the first night it was buggy, and I was glad I had packed a headnet, which proved quite effective.
On Saturday I hiked off and on with Drew and Jay, stopping a little off-trail with them for lunch at Dunkin', where with a few astute choices I put together a 1500 calorie lunch. I had had a couple blister issues, but with minimal care and luck, they have been okay. There were 7 hikers at the shelter that night, a max so far. A Boston hiker showed me platform stakes and how they are used, saying that tent platforms are common in NH.
Drew and Jay were going home Sunday, so they left camp early, but on the trail they wrote ""Legacy"" as a farewell. No one else had done that for me in 1500 miles, so I appreciated the gesture. I climbed up to Mt. Greylock, the highest peak in MA, which is also adorned with a huge beacon as a war memorial - very nice indeed. It was a short day for me - fortunate because I had my tent up before a very hard rain fell, the first rain on my trip. I was solo at the shelter for the third time. 
Monday was a day for multiple milestones. I completed the MA section (yea!) and entered VT. The AT coincides with the first 105 miles of Vermont's Long Trail. Shortly after entering VT, I crossed the 1600 mile marker of the AT (yea again!) After hiking adjacent to a flowing brook north of N. Adams, I passed through a burned out section of forest that still retained its charred smell, and afterwards a rocky section. CT and MA were excellent at maintenance, both at the shelters and the trail itself. My first impression of VT, not so much. I hope to have dinner with Bernie Sanders tomorrow and suggest ways that VT can up its game. I met Serena and Alyssa, Long Trail newbies. At the shelter, I met Bugs, the first AT flip-flopper I've met on this trip.
There has been a full moon the last few nights, and I can trace the arc of its path through my tent at night, a nice sight. 
On Tuesday, I sat next to a rocky stream to eat lunch and refill my water bottles. VT so far has more ups and downs, and a rocky path to traverse, making it more difficult for me. There was a steep descent into Bennington where I am taking my first zero.
Concerns I sometimes struggle with: (1) loneliness, (2) the start of black fly season, which I think the Eagles had in mind in their song, Life in the Fast Lane, ""they have a nasty reputation as a few of us do"", and (3) spotty cell service separating me from Cynthia, leading to loneliness (see 1). I talk to people on the trail or at the shelter, but the connection is short-lived. 
So I look for and am receptive to positive messages. The Dalton UMC church sign said ""God understands my fears."" And on the Graffiti Bridge in N. Adam's, someone wrote ""you're going to be okay.""
There was another issue with my planned itinerary. (Who is my Cruise Director? I'd fire the guy, but he's off hiking the AT at the moment.) Cynthia helped me resolve the issue, keeping me on the trail and supplied with maildrops. I will continue to work to transform my mental fluffness to mental toughness to keep me moving forward. ","
","Bennington, VT","May 26, Wed",41.70
Legacy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638234,"I left Bennington with renewed spirits, buoyed by a zero, talking with family and an uplifting email from my neighbor Marcia. (She said some nice things about me, so contrary to legend, it's not always ""Marcia, Marcia, Marcia"".
Although they sometimes show up at shelters, I see few hikers during the day. I met Mojo and Scanner, 70 year old section hikers, who said they'll finish the trail when they're around 100. Again it was buggy, but I found that using my Buff as a partial head scarf helped. (Apparently it's hard for the buggers to fly while laughing about their target.) I was solo at night for the fourth time as the temperature dropped under 40.
In good spirits,  I found the trail fun in the morning, catching a 360 degree view from the fire tower at Mt Glastonbury. The day was cooler too, a welcome respite from the bugs, who must have stayed in their sleeping bags for warmth. The day offered a time for deep reflection, like which animal's scat I saw four times that day - 1 inch round balls that resembled Cocoa Puffs (milk chocolate ones!) And as I saw on previous days, there was an interesting fungus on particular trees, sometimes shaped like a half bell in relief. ""Oysters on the half-bell, anyone?""
I finished early on Friday when it started to sprinkle as I scouted where to pitch my tent, then made an early dinner while the rain continued. It rained until 1230am, then began again at 130am as the temperature dropped. At 3am, I noticed the ground was a different color - snow for Memorial Day? Rochester looks good by comparison - and knocked the snow off my tent. Being the cautious hiker I am, I had sent home my base layer bottoms and fleece a couple days earlier. Still, I stayed warm enough, but was acutely aware of the importance of keeping my clothes dry to avoid the  chance of hypothermia.
The next morning, I knocked out of habit on the privy door despite it being locked from the outside. Nonetheless, when I entered there was already an occupant - a mouse had fallen / dropped into the 5 gallon bucket used for composting materials. I pardoned the mouse if he promised never to return and dumped him outside. Snow continued throughout the morning, but there was even more at Stratton Mtn, and I didn't even attempt to climb the icy fire tower shrouded in mist. I was reminded that I was doing better than some when I saw a thru-hiking couple rush past, not looking particularly happy in their skimpy running shorts. There were many weekenders at the shelter, and was certainly warmer at lower altitudes. 
Today I hiked quickly to my motel, to pick up a maildrop and dry out. Motel days are busy with chores, but this was particularly irksome when I learned that my maildrop had not been delivered. Fortunately, Price Chopper helped me forage boring, same day meal plans for 5 days to get me back on the trail tomorrow. I won't have the shave I desire, but I will have showered, hand-washed some clothes and food. What more could a hiker want?","
",Manchester Center. VT,"May 30, Sun",40.20
Legacy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638735,"The motel's broken mailbox was why my maildrop had not been delivered. Although I replenished the food, I forgot to replenish other supplies, so ""Attention Hikers! Toothpaste is now optional on the AT!""
Monday started promising, meeting day hiker Noah, a mechanical engineering student from Florida interning in Vermont. Atop Bromley Mtn is a ski resort, and in the shrouded mist the ski lift looked like the Starship Enterprise. But descending the mountain, the mud was slippery, and when one foot would momentarily slip in the mud, the Beach Boys ""Surfin' USA"" would play in my head, followed by ""Look, I be hangin' ten!"" I found a Happy Face image in some fungus on a tree. There were a couple Rochester connections that day. Thru-hiker Sprink had lived at Rochester's Zen Center for 11 months, and a weekend couple mentioned the ""Grand Canyon of the East"", Letchworth Park. At the shelter that night, where I would have solo #5, I thought it had all the attributes for a ""condensation station"" - low temperatures with a lot of mist kicked up from a raging stream nearby. Fortunately it didn't turn out as bad as I feared.
Tuesday presented a rock climb atop Baker Peak, with good views. The return of warm temperatures had me rocking ""the bugs are back in town, the bugs are back in town"" in my head. Again, there were few hikers. With my head down studying foot placement on the trail, I was startled and gasped ""oh Jesus!"" when I heard a quiet hello. It turned out to be a hiker rather than Jesus. In the late afternoon after reaching the shelter at Little Rock Pond, I was a bit nervous when a local family stopped near my shelter because their large dog had barked and growled when I had passed them, so I was relieved when they left. The pond had a nice view.
The next day I felt tired from the start, and only saw two day hiking couples all day. The shelter that afternoon was rather dumpy, and for the first time over three states, it did not have a bear box. I put up a pretty good bear hang for my food.
Thursday was the longest day of my trip at 14 miles, but I started early and felt up to the challenge. Early on, I met Fresh Grounds, a well-known trail angel, who follows front-running thru-hikers and who was just getting ready to cook for some that he said were coming. I find his approach curious: after all, the front-runners already have advantages - young, strong, fast, long distances - and then you add a trail angel who follows them and feeds them? What happens to the huddled masses yearning to be free? With forecasts of morning and afternoon thunderstorms, I hiked on, hoping beyond hope that I could make my destination before the rain. It added to my stress, not taking adequate breaks while traversing two difficult water crossings. But I did take the time for Angry Bird. I'm not a video game player, but that day I played a real-life version of it when a large bird, somewhat like a turkey but smaller and different coloring, charged me three times until I finally ran past it on the trail. Fresh Grounds was wrong on two predictions - fortunately the thunderstorm didn't arrive until evening, allowing me enough time to hike, set up my tent and eat dinner, and that I ""wouldn't be lonely tonight"". I saw no hikers the entire day, only two arriving at dark who I never saw again. The Cooper Lodge shelter was memorable in two respects: the best name for a privy on the AT, the ""Cooper Pooper"", and maybe the worst condition, trashed by locals or ski patrons from Killington Mtn. The storms and gusty winds hit long and hard that night, but my tent held up and kept me dry. 
The next day was my hike to the Inn at Long Trail and a scheduled zero. But a transformation had occurred overnight, a confluence of emotions I didn't quite understand and found hard to shake. I was disappointed at the paucity of hikers and the lack of opportunities to share conversations and form connections. Although the hiking went better than expected, I felt disconnected and dissatisfied. 
I decided to leave the trail. I considered giving it more time, but doing so would mean I would miss my daughter from Boston who was currently visiting home. But I soon found that the logistics of leaving would not be so easy - and maybe nonexistent. I was quickly confronted with obstacles. Vermont's restrictive Covid response meant that Amtrak and bus routes were shut down. Uber, or Uber drivers, did not exist. The chances of getting a shuttle to Albany seemed slim. At long last, I discovered Cape Air, a small airline that flew to Boston, giving me a link to home. 
Usually my decisions are slow and considered. This decision was much faster, fueled by a sense of feeling trapped. Travel options - both out of Rutland or towns further north along the AT - were diminished. The lack of hikers surely was a factor. My days looked forward more to reaching the destination and having time at night to read in my tent rather than focusing on the journey. My trek forward was not as well-planned as my trip so far. Given the circumstances, I decided it best to leave the trail now. So that's what I did.","
