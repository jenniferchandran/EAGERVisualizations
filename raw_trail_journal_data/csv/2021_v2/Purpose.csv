Purpose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632415,"First off thank you to all of you for reading my journal.  A huge shout out to all of those who read my journal during my attempted 2020/21 thru-hike. The decision to leave the trail last year after 161 miles was not an easy decision to make but my body was telling me otherwise.  Upon returning from the trail and letting my body heal, which took about a month, I did manage to escape the happenings of Covid life to summit Mt. Mitchell. 
Upon my return from that amazing hike, I had a lot of time to think about what my next adventure may be.  One thing is for sure the AT is calling but in a different way. No longer do I seek the prize title of AT thru-hiker.  Section hiker it is and I'm ""OK"" with that. More to come...because you can leave the trail but the trail will never leave you.
If you follow my blog @ www.thepurposefulhiker.com you can read more about what's been happing in my life since my return from the trail in 2020.",,View Entry,"Jan 26, Tue",0
Purpose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632419,"In 2020 I was grateful to have my wife start on the AT with me before she had to head back to Indiana. My wife Jennifer, trail name ""Surely"", because she kept saying surely we'll get there as we made the SOBO climb out of Harper's Ferry. Back home, she's an experienced day hiker with some solid backpacking experience. However, the freedom, the simplicity, the magic of the AT was something that definitely captured her heart and soul.  
On day two, she had to start the long journey back home to manage our household affairs as I sought after my thru-hike attempt. We took a side trail to the AT Blackburn Center where she met ""Moxie"" an accomplished thru-hiker, and the center's caretaker.  We said our goodbyes and Moxie drove her back to Harpers Ferry, where they had lunch together and exchanged stories. To say the least my wife was touched by the people and the freedom that the AT provides.  Harpers Ferry is definitely a place that we'll come back to visit and Harper Ferry's Brewing is a must stop!
So, as my desire to get back on the trail grew to start section hiking, it was fitting that she immediately said that she'd join me. So, for now, it's back to training even though we never really stopped...",,View Entry,"Jan 27, Wed",0
Purpose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632427,"One thing that I learned last year was that making a detailed hike plan prior to getting on trail is really pointless. When my original March start date got pushed back because of you know what, I tossed that into the fire.  Just one example of why plan, shit happens. Sure you need the general logistics plan of getting to your starting point but after that, it's anything goes. For me, once I started on the AT I quickly found that the freedom that I had was so amazingly powerful, why wreck this adventure with a set schedule. However I'll have to say, to hold myself accountable to actually hike, I did put together a loose plan based on some daily, weekly mile estimates, including some zeros just to have a general forecast of where I might be along the way.  I simply did this so that if anyone, friends & family that is, wanted to join me they could have an idea as to where they could meet me. I also needed a little accountability to get to Springer before it snowed...lol. Unfortunately, section hiking takes a little, OK, a lot more planning than I'd like. More to eventually come on that...but one thing that is for sure, NOBO from Springer it is and ""YES"", it includes the approach trail. So that's the basic plan for now, like I said anything can happen.We'll this post should now meet the 3 post requirement by TJ for you to now be able to finally see my post. I'm not sure how much I'll post over the next few months until we actually start our journey to start our section hike. I mean really, I'm sure you don't what to hear about training hikes in flat Indiana, or how I crushed a stair-stepper workout...Or better yet how I pack and unpacked my backpack a thousand times...lol. If you want to see my gear list it's posted on my page and it will pretty much be the same gear as I had last year. No gear reviews, pack your own pack.  Adios for now...:)",,View Entry,"Jan 28, Thu",0

Shock Down - by Mark "" Purpose"" Waligora
It’s now approaching one full year since the emergence of Covid-19 entered the U.S., and the media relentlessly painted a dark picture of the end of the world right before our very eyes. Was that fear message rightfully so? That’s not for me to determine. Each of us is entitled to our own opinion. For me, I personally learned something new during this time. I became more aware of how I received, interpreted, and processed the media’s information. I took the time to research information from all points of view and then use my own rational thinking and common sense to find a well-thought-out conclusion. What I tried not to do was to let emotions, or ego, get in the way.  One piece of wisdom that many of us seemed to have forgotten.
As we approach one year since mandatory lockdowns, shutdowns, masks, social distancing, obsessive hand washings, and such, we find that the world is still spinning, but at what cost to overall humanity?  I’ve said it before, that your own perception creates your reality. And it may not be mine, as everyone has different circumstances. However, one thing is for certain, the lockdown had negative effects on our mental health across all walks of life.  Mental health has no boundaries, no rules, no limitations, it affects the young, the old and is not selective to gender, race, religion, or color. It’s one of the things that the media still fails to address in their reporting on the effects of “Lock Down”. In my opinion, in the midst of painting the dark picture of COVID-19, the media fell short of creating an outcry for those who suffer or fell victim to the increases in domestic abuse, divorces, suicides, drug abuse, alcohol abuse, and so forth.
In March of 2020, I did what I was asked to do, and I put my dream on hold to thru-hike the Appalachian Trail(AT). I still question myself today if that was the right choice? At that time maybe it was, refer back to my blog post “To Flip or Flop”. Based at that time and the lack of real information, I felt obligated to do my part and “Stay Home, Stay Safe”, until the unknowns of Covid-19 started to sort themselves out from fear, fiction, fact, and common sense. However, in June of 2020, my mental health was once again getting tested. I had to go, I had to get on the trail, even knowing that the experience of the trail would be different and that the Appalachian Trail Conservancy (ATC) advised against it. So, on August 16th, I got on the trail, I had to for my own sanity, even without knowing what challenges laid ahead of me. 
Hiking the AT will wreck your life…SAY WHAT? Just kidding!  Once you’ve hiked on the AT for an extended period of time it has the power to change your life forever.  I’m so glad that I went, even though I didn’t complete a personal goal, and Flip the section from Harpers Ferry to Springer. However, I made 161 miles of the most amazing memories, and I got to meet some of the most amazing people while on the trail, and in the sleepy trail towns along the way. The ATC had it all wrong, these small towns thoroughly still welcomed the hikers with open arms and they were all well equipped to handle the sanitary practices, social distancing, etc. And there was also plenty of toilet paper along the way. I felt safe and so did they!
I’m so blessed that I got to fully experience life, the freedom, and the simplicity of living with everything I need right in my backpack. I’m so glad that I went because my mental health was nurtured and uplifted by the kindness and humanity of people. The memories of this adventure will stay with me for a lifetime, but the calling to return is strong. Backpacking the AT has become a gateway to my soul for healing, growing, living, and expanding my Universe as I continue on the path to finding my “Purpose”. So, in a nutshell, what’s next? I must return to start a section hike in early May and to seek 100+ miles from Springer Mountain, GA to Franklin, NC. I’ve updated my “Trail Journals Page” with more details about this section hike, and once I’m on trail, will record the daily accounts as connectivity permits.
As for mental health, my campaign to collect $2,193 dollars (2020 AT mileage) on HIKE for Mental Health has reached $1,083. I don’t plan to stop fundraising for such a worthy cause until I’ve reached my goal. You can find a link to my personal page on my home page or click here for my personal “HIKE for Mental Health” link.  Just don’t dream about the life you want, make it happen because you, and only you, are in control of your destiny and you deserve the life that you dream of.  However, sometimes you may need a little help along the way. No shame, no judgment, and there are many amazing organizations that are out there and willing to support you to Be_again! 
HIKE for Mental Health is a recognized 501(c)(3) nonprofit founded on the vision of a world in which everyone, including those who suffer mental illness, can find the simple joy of living. Our mission is to alleviate the suffering of those afflicted by mental illness, eliminate the associated stigma, and foster responsible use of wilderness trails. As an all-volunteer organization, we distribute 100% of contributions raised by our hikes.",,View Entry,"Mar 03, Wed",0

Memories Bring Back Memories - by Mark ""Purpose"" Waligora
With less than two weeks until I start my second section hike on the Appalachian Trail, the memories of last year’s adventures are still so vivid to me. The journey to unlearn what I’ve learned started long before I touched that first white blaze. I can still recall the many hours of training, research, planning, organizing, packing, repacking, and questioning myself. Will I be alright? Am I doing the right thing? Am I ready? As my step-off day grew closer, there were many sleepless nights. I was scared, I was excited. A million thoughts all fought for their turn to dance in my head long before that 10-hour drive to Harpers Ferry.
As the days now grow closer to the start of my second section hike, NOBO from the southern terminus at Springer Mountain, a sense of calmness now fills my everything. Sure, some minor planning needs to take place. But for the most part, I’ve learned to trust in The Universe and have faith that the trail will provide. No more sleepless nights, no more worrying about gear, miles, food, etc., I’ve learned to shed the doubts and fears of walking once again into the unknown. I’ve learned to trust myself and to enjoy everything that the trail will throw at me. I’m ready for another little part of me to die inside, and I’m ready for another part of me to be reborn once again. 
This will be my last blog post until I return from this two-week section hike. I’m super excited to be starting from the official Southern Terminus at Springer Mountain, Georgia on May 2. My plan is to see and feel everything to experience my hike to its fullest as I make my way north, destination Franklin, NC.  Just like last year’s adventure, I’ll be posting daily, as cell signal permits, on my Trail Journals page.  While you wait, If you feel inclined to do so, you can read about my past years’ adventure on the My Other Journals tab 2020AT on that same site. Thanks to all of those who wrote to me and for all of your support. This is going to be an amazing adventure, Be_again.

Now I just got to get better at not cameling up on water.  I need to force myself to take more breaks at water sources(via Guidebook pages & Guthooks) to drink up and fill up moderately. 
So, here's my official pak stats for this section...

Today was mostly down hill and the trail was amazing even in the steady rain that fell. Blessed that we thunderstorms missed us. The Three Forks/Benton Mackay area was crazy beautiful with all of its flowing crystal clear streams.  So, made it to the shelter tonight and was going to stay in side but the report was that the shelter was infested with mice.

Bad service so my post keep getting rejected. So, will keep trying and updating. Hopefully they'll stick.
Said good bye to wife this morning after we had some great coffee in town. She'll be back to pick me up in week, up the trail, after she visits her friends in SC and the beach. 
Time to make some miles again but I've learned a lot from my wife about pacing myself better. So today's hike was steady and with lots of breaks to take it all in, just wish I had more snacks,  lol. Yes, I miss her but I also need this alone time to reach deeper in finding purpose. 
Hiking stuff: Tray Mountain was the biggest of todays climbs...all hype again. I was up and over before I even knew it. Maybe I'm just getting stronger?

Plan C push,  if time was on my side , legs where functional and mind was in sink, go for a big day. Go for a stretch goal. 
So, what would reaching this stretch goal get me. Closer to the biggest climb of my section hike, Standing Indian Mountain @ 5436 ft...and it puts me in a real good position to get to Franklin a day earlier. TOWN FOOD.

Go far, as far as I could.  My previous record on the AT was some 18 miles in one day, today my first over 20 (21.2 to be exact). Not an easy day either....Two summits, Standing Indian Mountain (5435ft) and Albert Mountain (5250ft). AM was an A#@ kicker with more rock climbing than hiking. It was literally hand over hand climbing using rocks and roots with an upward angle of 80 degrees or more. I had to stop twice for 20 minutes each time to eat and get calories in me. Sure it within the last 3 miles before camp but dam it was hard. Not to mention the cliff hiking leading up to it. Cliff as in, if you fall, you might just die.
So, why? Well I knew that if I did AM tomorrow it was going to be in the rain and that would have been just down right scary.
Ok, one other first. As I was coming down SIM, I hit the gap when I hear a rattle like something. Stupid me, calorie deprived, before lunchtime, I wasn't thinking when low and behold, 2 feet off the trail was a very large and thick, what I believe was a Timber Rattlesnake. When the rattling clicked in my brain, it was too late, I was almost on it. When I saw it, it wasn't very happy with me. Sorry no picture, because I was running so fast up the trail and I wasn't turning back. I'm just glad that it didn't strike and that I didn't pee or poop myself.

Sleep was then hard to come by so up at 6:00am to pack up wet and get to the gap to Franklin, NC and figure it out from there, as I had no cell signal. 
When I reached the gap I called a hostel for a ride when they told me that I couldn't get picked up because of the gas shortage. GAS SHORTAGE, WHAT IS THAT? They told me that I'd be better suited getting a hitch. We'll game on...Still baffled, gas shortage?  Before I could stick my thumb out, I saw 3 cars pull off in the gap parking lot...Yogi time! (View my instagram page thepurposefulhiker).
Well my ride was only willing to drop me just off the highway off-ramp...Thankful I was for the 11 mile ride, and oh well more walking in tow to get the the hostel...lol 
Cold, soaking wet, and hungry first things first, FOOD! Jumped into a Huddle House for a bite to eat and plan my next ride to the hostel. Sorry HH about the puddle that I left in the booth. Tried Lyft but I guess know one is picking up because of the... gas shortage? So, 3 mile walk in the rain it is but first I see that the local outfitter is across the street, perfect spot to hitch from. Met the owner of the outfitter and after striking up some conversation he offered me a ride...bingo, more trail magic!
So, here I am at Gooder Grove Hostel showered and clean ready to hit the Lazy Hiker Brewery tonight, that is if they are serving beer during the ""gas shortage""?

Next thing I know, I'm crushing out another big day to get closer to the NOC where the new pick up spot will be, gas shortage pending. 
Lot of new faces up the trail when you do big days. I've now entered another thru-hike bubble where I'm the new guy. Kinda a weird as I'm flying by them.

Well, some nice views today and no snakes..lol. Tomorrow's destination is the NOC. Maybe I'll go whitewater rafting?

Time to go and close this section hike out.
Clear skys today and the view from the Wesser Bald observation tower, the last big climb, had 360 deg. views. Then it was pretty much 4 miles of knee pounding down hill on tired legs, ankles, & feet into the Nantahala Outdoor Center, my tap out point.
My wife is on her way now to pick me up and before heading home we may stopover for a side adventure. NO HIKING, lol, I'm pretty beat up.
I'm going to miss the friendships that I've made on this journey and I'm jealous that they will continue on. As they say, never leave the trail on a bad day, and today even as hard as it was, was and absolutely amazing day.

Purpose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637271,"When I left the trail on my thru-attempt last year (now section 1) I was torn to leave, it hurt. My body was beaten up, I was still learning about trail life, I wasn't confident enough, and I sure didn't put full trust in that the trail would provide. Maybe I wasn't ready at that time to thru-hike but everything happens for a reason. What I did learn, was that I needed more of it and I longed to get back on the trail. I wasn't discouraged about my journey, in fact, it was a planting of a seed that needed more time to grow.
This time when I left the trail there was an amazing feeling of accomplishment, I've learned so much on this journey. Sure, I'm saddened to leave the AT and I will always wonder, how much further could I've had gone.  However this time...this time, I left with a huge smile on my face, knowing that the trail will always be there for me. I've grown so much now as a LASH(Long Ass Section Hiker) in the trail life, trail knowledge, and have learned to trust myself and my backpacking skills. I've learned to not pack my fears...
I've now completed 298.6 AT miles (Over 300 if you factor in the approach trail) and I'm looking forward to getting back on it. I'm a little sore mainly from my rush to complete the miles between Franklin & the NOC, as that was unplanned. However, since my wife couldn't pick me up when I was in Franklin, the thought of sitting in a hostel for 2 days wasn't what I wanted to do. Now home, it will still take about a week to recover before I continue with my normal exercising routine. I will also be running in June, my first trail marathon in years since my RA diagnosis in 2016, so I'm super excited about that.
So in closing, what's next and when? A lot is happing in my personal life including a move to the Asheville, NC area in a couple of months so that I can be closer to the mountains, and closer to the trail. I'm hoping to also get back on the trail for one more 100-mile section this year. I just don't know when or where yet. I'm ""ok"" with chasing cooler weather when on the trail and not sectioning in one continuous direction or chaining segments together. I'm also proud to say that I'm a section hiker! 
So stay tuned...and happy hiking.
Ps. I'm so grateful for all of the hikers, ridge runners, hostel owners, outfitters, and town peeps that I've met on/off the trail, you made this adventure amazing. Also a huge shout-out to my wife for being on the trail with me for a week (Amalicola to Helen) and for her continuous support.

Purpose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637987,"Ok, that's enough sitting around already! I have a window of opportunity to get back on the trail this year in August so I'm going back, baby. So much has happened since I got home, although much of it was unfolding pre-section hike and while I was on the trail.  In short, I'm moving to Asheville at the end of July, we sold our condo while on the trail, and I will go back to work, working for myself that is in September.  I'll follow up later on all that.  The key thing is, one more section hike this year and I'll be living closer to the southern sections of the AT, BAM...Hiking stick drop! LOL
I've now pretty much got the details laid out and have made contact with a shuttle driver to confirm my plan. Since I'll be living closer to where I got off at the NOC, it doesn't make sense to jump back on there and continue north, although, I'd really like to.  But, I'll be so close now that I can fill in these sections when my wife can join me again. She's already making plans to get on with her friends to catch up from Helen to where I got off or at least to finish up GA. Yep, she's got a case of AT fever.
It really makes more sense to go up north further and start to fill in this southern section from where I got off in Waynesboro. The basic plan, for now, is to go Nobo for this section from around Catawba, VA. However, I don't know why when Sobo seems to be more logical. I guess I'll need to sort that out over the next few months but I really like going Nobo now. Partly was because I was hoping to stay at Stananimals in Waynesboro again. It's such an awesome hostel! We'll see...I've got some time to think about it. 
Now to just figure out Trailjournals and how to set this up. Is it a new journal or do I continue my existing 2020 journal? I guess I'll need to test it out. Until we meet again!",,View Entry,"May 27, Thu",0
Purpose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641607,"Ok, so once again I find myself writing stories for my blog site @  www.thepurposefulhiker.com and not posting them and I don't know why. Well, ""OK"" maybe that's not completely true, I do know the why. However, the ""WHY"" is enough material to write a novel about. So, to summarize the last few months of happenings since my return from section hike #2, here it goes and hold on; We sold our home that we just moved into 6 months ago. * We sold it when we were on the AT.We're in the process of buying a business that is out of state. * October is the intended grand re-opening.I left my job, a part-time job that I took up when I got back home. * The AT ruined backpacking in Indiana for me.We bought a new home in the state that the business is in. * Can you say, ""Hello Mountains!"" We just moved out of our home in Indiana. *  We sold, tossed, or donated what was left, and packed up only the essentials in an 8'x5'x7' U-Box hopefully to be seen again.We can't move into our new home until Oct. * My wife and I, are now technically homeless and will be living out our vehicles and couch-surfing until we can move in.
Trust me there's a lot more to each of these stories and even a few more stories in-between but I think you now got a better snapshot of what's been happening. I almost titled this post ""Welcome to the Shit Show"", lol or to cry is the question?  However, with everything happening in our lives we couldn't honestly be any happier, as I sit writing this post in a public library that has free Wi-Fi. Can you say, ""Life is an Adventure""? 
Once again please save any comments about how other people have more serious issues, I get it, they may have. Just to remind those who judge, you are reading a hiking blog. It's meant to entertain, dream, and share trail/life events, not to solve the world's problems. My wife and I are 100% grateful for what we do have and it feels personally satisfying to know that we both worked really hard for it. I can assure you that at birth, there wasn't a silver spoon in our mouths.

So moving on, sorry about that, I'm getting back on the AT next month for section hike #3. The plan is to head for Waynesboro, VA next week where I got off on my SOBO section hike from Harpers Ferry, and get shuttled to Catawba, VA.  From there I'll hike the 154 ish miles Nobo, in roughly around two weeks' time before heading to my daughter's house in NC. More posts to come as the adventure is about to get on the way.

Purpose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641798,"Last year when I decided to end my thru-hike, it ended right where I'm standing at this moment @ Stanimals in Waynesboro. It was this guy Rumble who drove me to the airport that next morning. I have to say it gave me chills to see him when I pulled in after my 9 hour drive from Indy. A big bear hug later he actually told me that he remembers me and that day. I can't even, my heart is so full.So, keeping it short tonight as I'm wiped out from the drive. Tomorrow morning I will shuttle 154 miles down trail and hike North I will. Already met some cool hikers today here at the hostle.

I even turn down the one free beer on the house knowing that well, at Stanimals, 1 turns into ??? Beautiful day to hike but August in VA what was I thinking? Apparently I wasn't as I didn't Camel up in an effort to stay lighter with the 6 days of food I'm carrying. Todays hike had zero water and I'm lucky that there was a puddle in camp. Oh. how I miss GA! The VA terrain is a grinder, sure it saw McAfee Knob ant Tinker Cliffs but that also meant two summit's for my city legs to deal with right out of the car. Well tomorrow will be another grinder no summits but no water for the next 17ish miles. I guess my pee bottle will not be used for pee for the next two days, yes It's a new one. After that the water sources are actually flowing is what I've heard. Very light traffic on the trail so far but I'm in camp and not alone.

Hard day today but I know that I'm getting my trail legs back. The ridge walk this morning had amazing views but it was technically tiring an exposed. Now, I just need to get my noodle right and suck it up. The heat has been oppressive and the lack of water sources is mentally draining. The last 5ish miles today was just down right brutal in the heat. I actually got lucky in the afternoon and Yogied 2 Gatorades right on the trail, at separate times, from some sobo day hikers. So, thankful, greatful, and in awe of their kindness. 
Lunch today was amazing though, when I popped out of the woods in Daleville low and behold a Mexican restaurant. Can you say hiker sink bath, phone charged, basket of chips and taco's, 3 ice teas, and AC. Unfortunately, with in 5 minutes of leaving, I sweated it all out and was absolutely filthy and thirsty.
Anyways, I made it to camp and I'm here with two cool older guys who are out for the weekend. One of them thru-hiked in 2013. They are just shelter hoping but I couldn't convince to head to my destination tomorrow because it sure would be nice to see a familiar face on trail.
Well hoping for a quite night, no visitors! We'll see what tomorrow brings. The water report looks a wee bit better so finger's crossed for that. Still got a long ways to go to I get to my first resupply and bed in Glasgow. I have a new respect for ice...lol","Lambert's Meadow Campsite

Purpose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641956,"Breaking point today, YES. Will I continue on YES. The heat has been just unbelievable. In trying to get to Glasgow, on time, I pushed myself today beyond my planned mileage to inch a bit closer. I'm still 3 days out, fully excepting to stealth camp somewhere, I came across an unexpected opportunity to get to a hostel at the gap just off the Blueridge Parkway. Trail magic comes in mysterious ways?!?
Ok, so while Glasgow is only my halfway point for this section, it's not going to be an easy one as the temps will top 90 for the reminder of my hike. Well at least there's no rain. I wish it would rain the streams and springs are dry!  But tonight I will sleep at the hostle in Buchanan,VA...clean, fed, and thankful because tomorrow, hike on I will! Another big push tomorrow but at least I'll be rested.
Ok, trail nuts. I met the first 2 Flip floppers a day ago as they where heading into Daleville, sorry I didn't catch there names. Then I met the the 3rd one today, No Bad Days, just before I got off the trail. He'd told me that the those young men, I met where the first ones per the trail register. So cool! Ps. Just walked main street Buchanan.  The town has a lot of charm and it would make for a great little trail town...","Fullhardt Knob Shelter

Beep, beep goes the alarm clock this morning but I was already awake by 5:30am. I guess when you pass out tired in a comfy bed at 8pm with a fully belly from last night's burger and ice cream you get up early. As I peeled up the curtain and looked out I smiled, YES it's cloudy. I quick read of the weather showed that today was going to cloudy most of the day, perfect, as I have another big day in front of me and a really big climb.Today's hike was really boring not even a view. Even the water at the prized swimming hole was too shallow. Not sure why two guys where fishing in it you could literally see that there wasn't any fish in the pools, even if there was you could of just reached in and grabbed them. The trail was really quite but I did see two people heading south, weekenders who didn't seem to want to chat, hum. They did tell me that there wasn't really anybody on the trail behind them it's probably because it's too dry, too hot they said...YEAH, I KNOW! My body is feeling it a bit the worst is a hot spot in my right foot. In all transparency, I almost fell today and in the midst of recovery I kick a boulder hard, really hard. So hard that I  almost pass out from the pain, broke maybe, only hurts real bad on the downhill. So I'll just play it day to day and hopefully the Vitamin I, works. So in camp alone tonight just chilling, elevating, and iceing my foot, just kidding. It's moments like this that I really miss my hiking partner. I need to find friends to section with.

Purpose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642080,"Amazingly, I slept well last night, maybe it was the heavy duty pain killer that I took. I slept with my toe sock on my foot, one because I didn't want to see if my toes where broke, and two if I did take it off, I may not get it back on. I also slept with it elevated and I also put an ice pack on it, just kidding. I crawled out of my tent with full intention to hike on, ok there was no other choice as the next gap was miles away but my foot was feeling ok. Retrieved my poorly hung bear bag, no good spots and it wasn't reassuring where I hung it when there already was a snapped line on the tree. I did my chores, coffee'd up, and hike on before the heat of the day began to set in. I have to say the pain killer was still kicking in and this section of the trail was beautiful. Then the day started to get interesting, or you could say falling apart. I managed to make 10miles before lunch and less than 3 miles before my planned stop for the day. There was a journal entry in the shelter that said, Just here for the night, Glasgow tomorrow...Yeah right I thought. So, when I stopped for lunch...I thought, Ok, Glasgow it is! As, I was eating lunch at Petits Gap off of the BRP, a road jockey came by and asking me for directions to a trail head, I guess a dirty, smelly, homeless looking guy is a foremost expert in navigating the surrounding trail. Ok, getting to the point, I reached into my pack and got out my bag where I keep my AT Guide pages to see if I could help find it. Now skipping forward, as I was 7ish miles out from Glasgow I needed to call the hostel for my pick up at HWY501 as directed, no cell service at the gap. That's when I noticed my backpack was unzipped at the top...I could have just cried. I'd lost my bag that had my phone charger, power bank, and my AT passport all which was in that bag that I guide my guide pages out of. HOW?The decent into Glasgow is no joke, miles of steep downhill until you get to the James River, guess how my toes were feeling now. Hours latter and finally off the mountain, limping my way down the trail, when a hornet stung me, 3 times as counted punctures, in my left calf. Can you say my leg is on fire Ricky Bobby...! Jumping ahead, I'm at Stanimals in Glasgow, the care taker drove me to Petits Gap and no luck, so at least I know that I did put it back in my backpack.

Who am I kidding... I'm getting off the trail. Even if it, my toe, gets a wee bit better, I'm only one step from really messing it up until it fully heals. I've already hit it a few more times yesterday and it was not good. Heart broken but there is no need to put myself in extra danger knowing that all's not well going into it. Sad...but super excited about our future...

Geez. Yes. You have your whole like to continue where you left off. Not a big deal. 
As one person gets off the trail another one gets back on. Ironically, today after being off the trail for about a  year, ""Strings"" a hostel worker who got sucked in for a work for stay/job, is getting back on trail. He's nervous, he's anxious, he's questioning himself, of course I do my best to help him work through it, it's what I do. Light on food and money, I gave him both... Hikers careing for hikers, it's a bond that is strong even if we only know of each other in passing. 
If you give trail magic, you may receive trail magic. However, it's never expected. But I got word that a Nobo has found my lost items right where I figured that I'd lost them. Lucky that we will meet me at the trailhead to retrieve them. Thankful!
VA kicked my ass again...but this dog doesn't give up the fight so easily. I'll be back, sometime soon...
Thank you again to all of the trail volunteers, trail angels, and ridge runners. Your service is appreciated.",,View Entry,"Aug 09, Mon",0
