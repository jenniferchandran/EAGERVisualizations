Woody,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595964,"Just beginning to think ahead toward the possibility of getting back to the trail next year. Many things must be done differently next go around if I’m to meet with better success in 2019 than on previous attempts. Have to admit that my head hasn’t been in it. Therefore, it has been all too easy to look for reasons to stop. At times it has been real injuries, but at other times it’s been other concerns that have lured me off the trail. I’ll have to figure out a way to stay focused and not lose sight of the goal.","

Woody,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596228,Seems we’ve settled into a weather pattern that is normally seen in August. 2018 continues to be a wet year here in the Appalachians. We’ve had afternoon storms through much of June and it is continuing into July. Makes it harder to get out consistently for training mileage. Was able to get in 8.5 hot miles yesterday and a shorter one today. Feel that my hip is responding and healing. Should be ready to go in 2019.,,View Entry,"Jul 04, Wed",0
Woody,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596230,"Looking ahead to next year. So trying to get a 2019 journal up and running. It takes three entries, so this should do it. 
Still toying with the idea of starting in Damascus in 2019 to avoid the huge bubble further south. Living now in Western North Carolina, it would be easy for me to drop back and finish the skipped over section.

Woody,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596787,"July is marching on. The Summer is slipping by. And I’m still not back out there hiking. How sad!Truth is that the Mrs and I have just been too busy. Our weeks seem to be filling up with activities and guests. That’s okay. We enjoy it. So it is looking more and more as if my hiking plans are shelved until next year. I may be able to slip off for a few days in the Fall — my favorite time of the year. But I was able to get out and do another 8.5 Training miles this morning here in the Land of the White Squirrel.  Finished it up in two and a half hours. Felt good. Couple of tender spots on the balls of my feet. Took along plenty of water for as soon as the morning coolness dissipated it got HOT!  Anyway, if I can keep up my walking I should be ready in 2019. Have made contact with a couple of fellow Tar Heels who are also looking to do a flipflop next year. Hopefully we can figure a way to start out together. That would be fun. Maybe even we can plan a shakedown outting in the Fall — perhaps Davenport Gap to Hot Springs or Sams Gap to Erwin??? That would be a great way to get acquainted. Have to work on that!",,View Entry,"Jul 10, Tue",0
Woody,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596998,"Was able to get back out for some more training/ rehab miles today. After walking down off our mountain, I hit a road that works it’s way up a neighboring mountain. It’s road walking, which I don’t particularly enjoy, but convenient.
 It’s a long four miles up a winding road to the top. The local cyclists like it. About a mile from the top you pass by the roadside spring pictured here. Man o man, did it feel good to hold my head under that flow!  So cold!  Gave me the pep I needed to make it to the top. 
On top is a small rural Baptist Church. I took advantage of one of their outside benches, dropped the pack, took off my shoes, and sat down for a break before heading back down to the house. Ate one of the new Snicker bars with Expresso. Very good!All in all, another good eight miles today. Have noticed the balls of my feet are hurting with all this road walking I’ve been doing. Can’t imagine what the Mountain to Sea Trail would be like here in NC as a good majority of those miles are along roadways. Might have to start putting some duct tape on my feet.",,Another Hot Day,"Jul 12, Thu",0

Since several of us in the 2019 Class live right here in North Carolina we may be able to get together in the coming months for a shakedown hike. That would be fun. Was pleased to see the addition of this new line of useful hiker food. I’ve used these foil packets of tuna (various flavors) for years. Now we have these options in chicken.

Woody,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599514,"Man, if all the AT was as smooth and easy walking as over at this local park, I think even I could do it. Ha!  But where would be the challenge?Have been making use of this nice walking path (1.5 mile loop) lately as I’m working through some foot issues. Over the years, as my feet have toughened up (what with all the walking) I’ve developed hard thick calluses on the balls of my feet. Lately, however, pain has developed under these calluses so that after five or so miles they are beginning to hurt significantly. So I’ve begun the painful process of removing these calluses. This has left some tender skin, as one can imagine. So, I’m restricting my walking (for a while) to the softer surface of this park’s walking path. Someone asked me about why I hadn’t listed my hiking gear here on my 2019 journal. The reason is that it’s a real pain to do so, especially since TJ underwent recent site renovations. So, if anyone is interested in my gear, just look back at my 2018 journal. I’ve made very few changes since I was pleased with most of my stuff this past season.",,Journal Update,"Aug 06, Mon",0
Woody,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605871,Winter hasn’t hardly gotten going good yet and I’m already weary of it. Just got hit here in North Carolina with a massive snow storm. Figure we had close to 18-20 inches of the stuff here and are still digging out. Been trapped here on our mountain since last Saturday and it may be another day or two before the road down is passable. Pleased with my exercising and training. Joined Planet Fitness Center about a month ago and have been hitting the treadmill and stair climber hard. It’s helping. Figure that four more months should go a long way to getting me trail ready. Still looking at an end of April start from Harper’s Ferry — heading north from there.

Woody,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606207,"2019 — A brand new year, hadn’t ever been used before. Can’t wait to see what this one may bring. 
I’m still hopeful that I’ll be able to squeeze in a long hike this year. And if so, then I also hope 2019 turns out to be significantly dryer than 2018 was. 
With that possibility in mind, I’ve been working hard on conditioning, hitting the treadmill and stair climber at Planet Fitness four to five days a week. Yesterday I was even able to walk home after my workout, another 10.5 miles. The down side was that it was road walking, which I don’t particularly enjoy. But the up side was that I found 35 cents along the way. Profitable. 
Still considering beginning my walk this year in Harper’s Ferry, doing a flip-flop. I’m wondering if anyone who has attended the Flip-flop Festival there the end of April might share their thoughts. It appears that there is no tenting space available. So reserving space in a hostel or motel appears the only option. Any suggestions?

Been back and forth messaging with Cap and Clingman about our developing plans to begin our 2019 hike at the Flip Flop Festival in Harper’s Ferry, WV. After I sent Clingman a message asking if it might be wise for us to make some lodging plans for that weekend (April 26-28), he picked up the ball and ran with it, researching the situation and reserving space for all three of us for the weekend at the hostel just north of town. Fantastic!We still haven’t decided about whether to start from HF or back down the trail a ways, say Fromt Royal, and warm up a bit by hiking into HF for the festival. We’ve time to decide that in the coming months. Getting exciting!Looks as if we’ve got another snowfall headed our way this weekend here in the NC mountains. Nothing like the last one, I hope. Still working out at the local Planet Fitness about 4-5 times a week. Slowly upping my time and increasing my workout. Believe it’s really helping.

Woody,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607069,"Can hardly believe just how fast these days leading up to this year’s start are passing. If March speeds by similarly it will be time to head north before I know it. Will be celebrating another Birthday next week, and so I treated myself to a few gifts which will be useful on the upcoming hike. Have used Merrells for years, but decided to start out in Keens this go around. Love the extra room in the toebox.  Also, my old rain pants were falling apart and needed replacing. Looked at a number of brands, salivated over several really light weight versions, but went with these lesser expensive pants from REI. I’ll probably end up using my UL rain skirt most often anyway. Clingman, Cap, and I are still planning our trip up to Harpers Ferry on April 26 for the Flipflop Festival. Then our plan is to hike out northward on the 29th. I’ve registered with the ATC and gotten my number so I can pick up my pack tag when we arrive at the HQ.  Things are getting real. Lots to do before I depart. Hope to take up and put down new boards on my deck here before leaving. Depends on if the weather will cooperate. All the best to those who have started already from Springer and those who will set out in the coming weeks.

They were able to answer a lot of our questions and give some useful advice which should help us this year on the trail. Thanks FF and Curly!Went out today and ordered a new sleeping pad for the hike. For years now I’ve used my old 3/4 length Thermarest. It has served me well but feel that I now need cushioning under my feet and ankles too. Also, the side baffles may help keep me from rolling off the pad so often during the night. Got word from Clingman today that he has reserved the rental we will use to drive up to Harpers Ferry from Asheville.

The latest one was putting the finishing touches on my book and getting it ready for publishing. Mission Accomplished!Pressing Forward: Devotional Thoughts of a Home-Bound Pilgrim was started a long while back but I only really got serious about it after my retirement last January. Glad that I can tick off one more thing. There are several other items on the list, but nothing so immediate as it would delay my walking. I need to replace some wood out on my deck but if all this rain doesn’t ease up I may not get to it until the Fall, after my hike. Oh, my Klymit Sleeping Pad came today.

Ran across this humorous accounting of what it’s like here in North Carolina where I live. So glad that this time around I’ve decided to do a flip flop, allowing me the opportunity to wait till the end of April to begin. Hopefully I’ll miss the cold that I’ve always encountered whenever I’ve started mid-March in Georgia. Finally got done with the treating of my clothing with permethrin. They’re all hanging on the line drying. Each treatment is supposed to last about six weeks. Don’t have a plan yet for retreatment. Depends on where I am at the time.Also dropped by the local REI store this week and picked up a rat sack to protect my food bag. The general opinion is that 2019 is going to be another wet, buggy year with lots of mouse activity around the shelters. I may come up with a hiking plan that calls for stopping at the shelters for dinner, but then hike on a mile or so to pitch my tent away from the varments that frequent those locations due to the presence of ready food. Looking forward to the FlipFlop Festival in Harpers Ferry April 26-28.

Woody,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610343,"Just two more weeks before heading up to Harpers Ferry for the 2019 FlipFlop Festival. For a diversion, I decided to get up early yesterday morning and drive up to intercept a friend who is hiking a section of the trail. ‘Special Ed’ and I hiked a bit together back in 2015 and we’ve kept in touch. I thought I might drive up to a road crossing and bring him a cold coke to cheer him on his hike. Over the years, I’ve been on the receiving end of some wonderful ‘trail magic’ performed by the nicest of people. Now it was my chance to give back, as they say. It took me about two hours to reach Devil Fork Gap on NC 212 along the NC/TN State line. This would be the first road crossing hikers would reach after leaving Flint Mtn Shelter. Anyway, I got to the crossing at 7:30 am, and knowing that Ed wasn’t planning to leave the shelter till 8:00, I parked my car and began walking south on the trail toward the shelter. I had almost reached it (2.5 miles) when Ed came strolling toward me. What a great reunion!Anyway, we walked out together and I pulled out a cooler of cokes, bags of chips, boxes of donuts, and fresh fruit from my car to distribute to a great group of hikers sitting there by the road. It was a great way to pump up my own spirit for my hike ahead.",,View Entry,"Apr 13, Sat",0

Today started windy and cold, but by noon it had turned into a warm, beautiful day. I really enjoyed the Festival today. My visit to the ATC Headquarters was super. I was able to get my official photo taken and picked up my pack tag. I am FlipFlopper # 131 this year. 
Quite an interesting mix of hikers here at the hostel. Some are long section hikers. Most, like Clingman, Cap, and me, are FlipFlop hopefuls. Some will head out tomorrow while the three amigos are thinking we may wait till Monday morning to begin walking north. 
Had a great afternoon looking at the sights in historic Harpers Ferry. Quite a well-preserved Civil War era town!","

Woody,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611778,"Well, the FlipFlop Festival is over. Lots of very useful and informative workshops on such things as: taking care of your feet, bathing in the woods, how to pace oneself, proper food selection and eating, etc. I think all three of the amigos learned a great deal. 
Today we were treated to a pancake breakfast hosted by the Camp Hill United Methodist Church. They consider it a wonderful opportunity to minister to the hikers in this way. It was great. Check out my photos of the event. 
We head out in the morning. That will be Day 1 of our hike. Personally I’m a little apprehensive about it, and am glad to have Clingman and Cap with me. 
It’s suppose to turn cold here overnight and hover in the upper 30’s in the morning as we get going. We’ve a 1,000’ climb ahead of us first thing, so perhaps the cool temps will feel nice. I’m sure we will warm up. 
Okay, I’ve got laundry to do before I crash for the evening. Will hopefully have news from the trail tomorrow.","

Woke at about 6:00 this morning at the hostel. Cap already had the coffee going in the kitchen. B’fast of toast and oatmeal. Yum!After a short mile back to the trail, we began a long ascent up to Weverton Cliff.  Great view of the river.The rest of the day was a relatively easy ridge walk with slight ups and down.Got to Brownsville Gap and found many markers and ruins from the Civil War time. Big battles here in Lee’s push to capture Harpers Ferry.

From there it was a steep, but short climb up to Crampton Gap Shelter. 
Arrived @ 2:00 and quickly set up my tent for the night.  Filtered water and will be eating soon.
Good first day of hiking. Met two older gentlemen, Smail Mail(a retired Mail deliverer) and Tote-em. Both have great attitudes and are enjoying their hikes.","

We had a great campsite last evening and great company. Snail Mail and Tote-Em came in. Also Rambler, Tagalong, and Zack and Katlyn and many others. A thru-Hiker named Speedy came into camp. He’s averaging 30 miles a day. I think his pack weight was down to about ten lbs. WOW!


We only did 6.8 miles today but I’m of the opinion that the distance I covered was a great deal more than that as I was often zigzagging back and forth across the trail to find a somewhat safe place to take the next step. It was very rocky and they say it’s only going to get worse as we get into Pennsylvania. One local day Hiker we met thought that Maryland was salting the path with more rocks so as to compete with Pennsylvania. Sounds plausible. 
We are camped at Dahlgren Campgrounds for the night. It’s right beside the trail, is State run, and has showers!  Even more exciting is that there are trash cans. I love trash cans out here. Let’s me get rid of my wrappings.

We got a late start this morning out of Dahlgren Campgrounds. Clingman’s tent collapsed on him last night in the rain and much of his stuff got wet. So this morning he had to hang up some things to dry out. But we had a great day. The trail takes you right through George Washington State Park. Unfortunately, they are in the midst of repairing the Washington Monument located here. Scaffolding is up marring our photos, but it was good to see. 
Saw a deer along the trail this morning but wasn’t fast enough with the camera. 
At some point we crossed a pedestrian bridge over I-70 and stopped for lunch at Pine Knob Shelter. 
From there it was a short couple of miles to Annapolis Rocks where today’s pic was taken. Unfortunately rain clouds are moving in and there was very little view from the cliff. 
I’m having trouble with my shoes, so the Mrs has mailed my old shoes ahead to the PO in Waynesboro, PA.  In order for me to reach the PO by 11:30 on Saturday, I must part company with Cap and Clingman in the morning. I’ll try to do 11.5 miles tomorrow to Raven Rock Shelter leaving me with about five to do on Friday to reach Waynesboro. I can Resupply in town that afternoon, wash my clothes, and get to the PO the next morning to pick up my shoes. Then I’ll have to figure out how to intercept my hiking partners again. They want me to bring pizza!","

Got away from camp this morning at 6:00 am. Actually was all packed up inside my tent by 5:30, but then I got out and wiped down my tent to get some of the rain off. I hate packing up a wet tent. It feels twice as heavy in my pack. 
Anyway, spoke a quiet goodbye to Clingman and Cap and was on my way. Made good time most of the morning until I hit a ridgeline where the hiking turned into rock hopping. It was treacherous. I’m convinced there were whole sections hundreds of feet long where my foot never landed flat on any surface. Not good for the ankles, and we’re told that Pennsylvania is only worse. 
I took one bad fall on the wet, teeter-totter rocks but thankfully my pack took the brunt of the impact. 
Got down to Little Antietam Creek and sat down, took my shoes off, and soaked my feet in the cold water for about 30 minutes. It was heavenly!

Anyway, looks like it may rain again tonight, so I just set up my tent to dry for a while and then moved into the shelter. Hopefully I won’t have to fight the mice all night, but I won’t have to pack out a wet tent again tomorrow.","

We had been told that a bad storm was headed our way, so I set out and hurried up the trail. I left the shelter at 7:00 and reached Pen Mar Park just shy of 9:30. Not too bad for an old fat man. We also had been given the name of a man in the area who would be willing to pick up hikers and shuttle us into town. Great!  So Frank picked me up, drove me by the Post Office to pick up a box the Mrs had sent, then dropped me off at the Days Inn in Waynesboro. I’ve done my laundry, resupplied my food bag at the Dollar General, and am waiting for the storm to hit. Raven Rock Shelter is a newer one and I enjoyed my night — no mice!  The long treacherous descent this morning was rough but the Good Lord held back the rain and let me get down on dry rocks.

I left Tumbling Run Shelter at 7:45 and made it down to US 30 at 12:30. The trail today was muddy and the rocks were slippery. I rolled my ankle twice. In many places water was running down the trail several inches deep and collecting in bogs or ponds we had to circumvent or wade through. All in all, not a pleasant day.

Had to wait until Tuesday morning to post this entry as I had no signal last night down in the hollow. 
Today was a good day, but it really started last evening. After yesterday’s nine miles over very rocky trail, I made it down to US 30 and took shelter in a hostel nearby. It was glorious!  I’m almost embarrassed how long I stood under the hot water in the shower. It was just the thing I needed to get some warmth back into my bones and feeling into my muscles. 
After we were clean we made it down the road to a diner for a great burger and fries, then back to the hostel for a great night’s sleep.  
So, today — what can I say?  The sun came back out. We hiked ten miles today —IN THE SUN!  Fantastic!  
We did have a climb right away of about 1,000 feet but after that the trail was a lot of nearly flat walking. Even so, my right ankle and heel are hurting (having rolled my ankle twice yesterday).  And Cap’s right foot is hurting too. So we may have to back off the miles the next few days. We had planned to make it to the Pine Grove Furnace State Park to stay in the Ironmaster Mansion Hostel. But we’ve learned it is closed on Tuesday. So that eliminates the incentive to keep up the miles.
Anyway, this shelter is nice, has bunks and good water. Hoping for a good nights rest.","

Parts of the trail today was really muddy and for a stretch a stream was running down the trail itself. Left the shelter this morning at 7:30 and reached the store/restaurant by noon. Getting here I was able to treat myself to a huge cheeseburger and ice cream. While I was waiting for Clingman and Cap to get there I went across the street and found a nice grassy shady spot and took a nap.When they got there they were able to go in together and split a two-tent camp spot, but this left me out, and I was not going to pay $30 just for the privilege of setting up my tent. So, my only option was to hike on. I left the Park at 2:30 and made it to the next shelter at 5:30. Long day (17.1 miles) and I’m beat.

Woody,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613656,"Received a call today from an old friend. Icefire and I did some hiking together back in 2015, along with Special Ed, and we’ve kept in touch since then. The two of them are both closing in on finishing the trail. Icefire only has about 180 miles or so to finish. Anyway, the two of them are meeting up this June in Monson, Maine to hike south to the spot which, for Icefire, marks the finish line. I am invited to join them and help my friend celebrate. It’s tempting, but I doubt that I can get away for it. I do wish my friends a good and safe hike. It’s been nearly a week since I left the trail after hiking into Boiling Springs, PA. It’s been good to get back home and back to my church. It’s also given me time to reflect on my hike. Overall, I’m pleased with what was accomplished. I was pleased with my level of conditioning prior to hitting the trail. The months of working out in the gym paid off. I felt strong out there and my breathing was good almost from the start. I also was pleased with how my body responded to the demands while out there. Toward the end I was definitely getting my legs, doing twelve miles the last day and seventeen the day before. Arriving in Boiling Springs I felt good and was very tempted to hike on. I really enjoyed the section through which I hiked this go around. That section has so much history and it kept my mind occupied just remembering snatches of things studied long ago regarding earlier times in our Country. I was pleased with my pack and belongings. Having hiked in these shoulder months before, I pretty much knew what I would need, especially extra clothes for layering. I was looking forward, however, to sending some items back home after it warmed up a bit more. My food choices worked out well. I had thought about going stoveless, and probably would have shifted to that plan later on, but there were some evenings when a warm meal was nice. I am getting more familiar with the task of town food resupply, especially in establishments such as Dollar General Stores — learning to make do with what’s available. It’s a learning process. There were certainly some negatives. I’ll just keep those to myself. But even negatives are opportunities for learning and growth. Met some wonderful people. Overcame some challenges. Endured some hardships.   Enjoyed some blessings.     For what more could one ask?","

He has been nursing an Achilles Tendon injury and I’m fighting through plantar fasciitis in my right foot. By the way, if anyone has some practical wisdom to share which will help me I’d appreciate your input. I suffered through this several years ago and finally broke down and had the Doc give me a steroid injection. It worked but I’m hoping to avoid that this time. Anyway, Cap is wanting to get back on the trail and do the ‘flop’ part of the hike, Harpers Ferry south to Springer. I’d like to accompany him at least through Virginia. That would mean I’d have completed all of the trail from Springer to Boiling Springs, PA. Then, perhaps, I could work to complete the rest by sections in the future. The Virginia section alone will take us quite a few weeks as it stretches over 550 miles. But the Fall months, September through October, would be a wonderful time to traverse those miles. So, if I can get beyond this foot issue in time, I’ll look forward to partnering up with Cap for another stint in the woods. Look for further updates as September 1 draws closer.","

Plantar Fasciitis has flared up in my right foot, not as bad as back in 2015, but painful enough in the heel and ankle area. I’m icing it a lot and interspersing that with electro pulse therapy. It seems to be helping. Also purchased some new shoes (Brooks Cascadia 13) and added Inserts designed for PF. Was able to do seven miles today with a light pack with only moderate discomfort once I got back home. Also altering my workouts at the local fitness center to include more time on less impactful apparatuses such as the elliptical and stationary bike. All this to say that I’m taking all the necessary steps that will make it more probable for me to get back to the task of finishing the AT by completing Virginia this Fall.","

But man is this heat a trial!  I ran across this image of flipflops for the heat. I may have to give them a try. Haven’t worked out how I’ll get back up to Harpers Ferry the end of August. Looking into Amtrak. It would be relatively easy to slip down the hill to Greenville, SC to catch the train to Washington DC. From there I can catch the commuter train out to HF. It’s an all day trip — exhausting — but the price is reasonable. Anyway, looks like a September 1st start, heading south into Virginia, is the plan.

Looking forward to a walking tour of our Capital during the day before returning to Union Station to catch the train to Harpers Ferry at 4:05, arriving in HF at 5:16.  The plan is to grab a bunk in some hostel for the night and hike out of HF the next morning (September 4th) heading south. This gives me a month to relocate all my hiking gear which has gotten scattered around the house since getting off-trail back in May. Cap and I will be heading into Fall months, so my clothing selections will be slightly different from when I packed back in April. All is good. My foot continues to heal. I came close this week to making a visit to a local acupuncturist, but changed my mind at the last minute. The new insoles seem to be working.

So, thought I’d go ahead and figure in all the miles already covered on previous section hikes, which run from Springer Mountain 494.3 miles to VA 600 at Elk Garden, about 25 miles north of Damascus.

Woody,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622391,"First day back on the trail. For the most part it was a nice hike but very hot and humid. So, I was drenched most of the day. Only two hard climbs today. The first couple of miles as we hiked away from Harpers Ferry and the river and the second was down to the water source here at the shelter. Man, that was brutal. Steep!  I don’t ever want to do that again. Think I have enough water to get me through the night and for tomorrow morning. But even if I run out I’m not going to make that trek again. I’ll hike away from here thirsty and spitting dust before I go back down to that spring. 
Anyway, my heel held up today. It’s sore now and barking at me, but I’ll take some ibuprofen and it’ll be fine. 
Cap and I saw only one other Hiker today. Looks like we’ll have the shelter to ourselves. Supposed to rain some later. So glad we’re under a roof.","

Woody,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622443,"Second Day:  We had a good evening at the shelter. Cap and I had it all to ourselves so we were able to spread out our stuff all over the place. Nice. At first the heat of the day lingered and I wondered if I’d ever get to sleep. But somewhere around midnight it cooled off. 
We got away from camp at eight. The first part of the morning we bounced up and down along a ridgeline. Around ten we reached the turnoff to the Blackburn AT Center. It is a very nice place accommodating hikers. But the bad part is that it is down a very steep sidetrail of about 0.3 miles. It was a brutal climb down and then back up. But we needed water. So it was necessary. 
Four miles later we reached the northern end of the infamous Roller Coaster, a thirteen mile section of the trail that is one steep descent followed by an equally steep ascent. Four miles of that brutal up and down and we finally reached Bears Den Hostel. What a place!  For $30 we get a bunk, shower, a large pizza, a cold coke, a pint of Ben and Jerry ice cream, get our laundry done, and pancake breakfast in the morning. 
Worn out, so hoping for a good sleep tonight and we may do a short day tomorrow.","

Had a rough night at the hostel, upset stomach and lower intestinal track discomfort.  Couldn’t eat breakfast, or really anything all day until just now I was able to get down some bland ramen noodles. 
Cap and I left Bears Den Hostel at nine. I was walking real slowly. No energy at all. Cap asked me once if I still felt bad and I responded by saying I’d have to improve several levels before I just felt bad. But thankfully I began to feel better throughout the day. 
We didn’t push ourselves today. This Roller Coaster section is tough on you. Made it to Morgan Mill Stream around 4:00 and decided to call it a day. Our search of the area for a couple of flat tenting sites proved to be in vain. My tent is on such a slope that I’m lying more on the downhill wall than the floor. Oh well, I’m tired enough that I will hopefully sleep anyway. We’re right by the gurgling stream that should lull me into slumberland quite nicely. 

Anyway, tomorrow we hope to finish the remaining three miles of the Roller Coaster and I’m not sure how far we’re planning to go. Stay in tune.","

Woody,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622584,"Day Four: 
Pretty good night’s rest last evening except that my tent was on a slope and I kept sliding sideways into the tent wall. But I managed somehow.   Felt rested this morning and ready to go. 
Cap and I got away at nine, ready to knock off the last three miles of the Roller Coaster. I was thrilled when I finally saw the sign posting the south end. 
About a half mile further I got to Rod Hollow Shelter, sat and ate something while waiting for Cap. He had wanted to stop there for the day but it was still early. Plus it was an awful shelter and the water source was almost nonexistent. So I talked him into hiking on. 
My guide info said that there was a nice stream about two miles ahead with tent sites. When I got there I found no place to pitch a tent and the water was just a trickle. So, I hiked on. Before I knew it I had arrived at the US 50 road crossing at Ashby Gap and virtually out of water. When Cap caught up we made the decision to head on, also thinking there was a stream just ahead. But that stream was dry too. 
Well, now we were in trouble facing a long uphill climb and several more miles to the next advertised water source. But before long I particularly began to feel the effects of low water intake. Headache, extreme fatigue, dizziness, and so dry I could spit dust. 
So at some point we decided to take a sidetrail 1.7 miles down to Sky Meadows State Park. Somewhere along the way one of the Park Rangers stopped and gave us a lift to the office. We’re now sitting at a picnic table at our primitive camp site cooking dinner. I’m tanking up on fluids and taking ibuprofen to fight the headache. Hope to crawl into the sack soon.","

Well, if you’re keeping up and read about our crisis yesterday, then I should start out by saying that the Good Lord definitely was watching over us. Going down to the State Park for the night was a great decision. Neither Cap nor I enjoyed that 1.7 mile steep climb back up to the trail this morning, but the abundant water in the Park saved us. I can say enough about how nice and thoughtful the Park Rangers were.  They were wonderful. 
Today’s hike went well but we had trouble finding water again. I guess it’s the time of year when the springs and streams go dry. We stopped at Whiskey Hollow Shelter, thinking we might just have a short day to recover from yesterday, but found almost no water. So the next Shelter was four miles away and we decided to gamble on it having water. And lo and behold, it does!  A good flow out of a pipe. It’s wonderful!
Anyway we’ve eleven miles to get into Front Royal tomorrow and I’m looking forward to several showers and clean clothes.","

Woody,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622660,"Day Six:
Not a very good night at Manassas Gap Shelter. Again, my tent site was sloping, and it was the best around. The real problem was the heat and humidity which just didn’t go away all night. We were melting. But the water flow at the shelter was great. 
We got off to an earlier start. It helped that I heard raindrops start falling on my tent around 6:00. Nothing like that to get you moving. I hate packing up a wet tent. Anyway, it only lasted a few minutes but I went ahead and packed up. Went down to get my food bag from the bear pole and Cap was nearly packed as well. So we got away before 7:30. 
We looked at today in two sections of about five miles each. The first part took us down off one mountain where we crossed under I-66. Then we climbed up the opposite site reaching the Jim & Molly Denton Shelter by 11:00. Very nice shelter with a patio and lounging chairs and a shower. Both Cap and I decided that showers would feel just fine even if we were going to put back on our wet, stinky hiking clothes. And you know what?  It did!  Oh how refreshing!  I stood there for quite a while and let the cold water run on my sore knee. It was heavenly!
Around noon, after eating a bit, we hit the trail again for the last push into Front Royal. It was mostly a painfully long downhill march but we made it, reaching US 522 at 3:00. Within minutes a nice lady stopped to give us a lift into town. We’re now settled into the Quality Inn, have showered, and will soon try to go find some food. I think I could eat a horse!","

Woody,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622710,"Cap and I are enjoying a Zero Day here in Front Royal, no hiking, at least not officially. We have done some walking as things are a bit spread out. Woke up early this morning and went down to the laundry room to start my clothes washing. While that got going I hopped over to the hotel lounge for breakfast, waffle, bacon, toast with jam, cinnamon roll, juice and coffee. Great way to start the day. Later, after finishing my laundry, I went back again and sat with Cap while he ate. Of course I had to eat something too. Settled for a bacon sandwich with ketchup. Then we were off to do our resupply shopping. After hitting the Dollar General and the Martins Supermarket, I think I found enough to get me through the next few days of our journey. Everyone says not to carry much food when heading into the Shenandoah Park because of all the waysides along the way.  So, I’ve tried to keep that in mind.  My biggest concern is finding adequate water. Everything is so dry that many of the sources are not flowing. When they are the water is often filled with silt. I back flushed my Sawyer filter last evening and it looked like pure muddy sludge coming out for the longest time. Anyway, we’re resting up today. I’ve already enjoyed three showers and may take several more before we head out tomorrow morning, back into the heat, sweat, bugs, spider webs across the trail, and all the other goodies the trail offers. Oh, by the way, my count on wildlife is up to eleven deer so far, but Cap trumps that with five bear sightings.","

What an interesting day!  Got started with a great breakfast at the Quality Inn. They really put on a spread. Then Cap and I were ready to head out by 7:00. We took our packs across the street to hitch out of town, but no one would stop and pick us up. Go figure that, a couple of nice looking hikers who even smelled nice after about twenty showers in two days. 
So, we walked a few blocks to get closer to the edge of town. Finally after the longest time a nice girl stopped and dropped us off at the trailhead three miles out of town at 8:13. 

>span class=""s1"">Anyway, we climbed and climbed. Came across some trail magic along the way, a cooler beside the path filled with cold water, juice, fruit cups, and oranges. 
Stopped for a breather at the Tom Floyd Shelter. Nice. Moved on and soon came to some serious rock scrambling. Somewhere in there we both fell at least once and I injured my finger. Thought it was broken for a while, couldn’t move it. So just taped it up and kept walking. Eventually I began to get some sensation back and now feel I just jammed it badly. Hurts though. 
Got to the self-registration station for entering the Shenandoah Park, but the box was empty of permits. We will try to get one elsewhere. 
Around two we arrived at one of the few springs along this section. After that Cap and I began looking for tenting sites as we did not want to go all the way to the first Hut(Shelter) which would have been 13.4 miles. But the trail offered us nothing. We just had to keep walking. I soon got some distance ahead, listening to the rumble of thunder off to the NW, desperately searching both sides of the trail for a spot to set up two tents before the storm hit. Finally, after nearly three more miles, I spied an imperfect, but adequate spot, quickly dropped my pack, and scrambled to set up my tent. Cap arrived just as the storm was about to hit. We didn’t even have time to get his tent up, but the both of us just dove into my tent as the fury broke upon us. For nearly twenty minutes we hunkered down while thunder, lightning, fierce wind and torrential rain hit us. I don’t mind saying it was a bit frightening. 
Finally the storm move on enough for us to get Cap’s tent up, hand our food bags in a tree, and begin to get ready for the evening. 
Everything is fine now. We are to get more rain tonight and tomorrow. Hope it cools things off a bit. Today was the worst for heat and humidity.","

Oddly enough, I had one of my best night’ sleep last night. After the storm pushed through the temperature dropped to a comfortable coolness, plus we had a nice wind all night that made it even better. So I woke early this morning well rested. 
Cap and I got packed in the pre-dawn darkness and were hiking by shortly after 7:00. 
By a little after 8:00 we had topped our first significant climb of the day, Mount Marshall. From there we worked our way down, crossed over Skyland Drive again, and made our way to the Gravel Springs Hut where we rested a bit and ranked up with water.

I try to get everything in my pack, then stick my pack with its cover outside, then collapse my tent and put it in the outside pocket. Simple but an ordeal. Anyway, we were on the trail by 7:50. The trail was very treacherous today as all the rocks and roots were wet. Both Cap and I are getting tired, running out of steam. After I roll my ankle a couple of times on our descent I’m pretty much in agreement that it’s about time to get off trail and cut this section hike short. We walk in the rain (not fun) all morning, arriving at Pass Mountain Shelter around noon.

Cap had managed to get in touch with a relative who lives in Staunton and we arranged to be picked up at the Park parking lot just up from Thornton Gap. Since it was only a couple of miles away we were in no hurry and could take our time along the path. And that was a good thing as it was very foggy and the rocks were slick. Arriving at the parking lot we were able to get cleaned up a bit in the nice restrooms. Then I ambled over to a table nearby where a Park representative was giving a lecture on LNT hiking (Leave No Trace). I wasn’t all that interested but the table had all sorts of food on it. I walked away with a banana and a sweet roll. Cap went for a banana and a muffin. Anyway, our hike may not have lasted quite as long as first planned but we were able to cover some beautiful country and not get hurt along the way. Met some interesting people. We ran into one young lady who had just started hiking. She had an enormous pack. It must have weighed 80 lbs.

Here in the South, we’ve been warned of a very cold and snowy winter which has yet to materialize. I know that, officially, we’re only just on the very front end of winter, but with the temps still in the high 60’s it’s hard to imagine that things are going to be as bad as some have forecasted. In any event, I should be okay as my 2020 hiking plans don’t kick in until April. Been considering replacing my tent (Lighthearted Gear Solo), which I have loved and has served me well, but has developed several small holes in the floor which lets water deep in. I may be able to patch and paste. But it may be time to just replace it. Looking over my options, I’ve begun to investigate such replacements as: the Lighthearted Gear Duo, Gossamer Gear’ The One, and Tarptent’ Moment DW. I also like the Nemo Hornet 2p. Looking forward to what new stuff may be coming out in the coming months. Using these down months to workout and stay trail ready. Feet, legs, knees and back all seem good. Hitting the Fitness Center 3-4 times a week and supplementing that with hard work here on our mountain cutting and chopping wood, road work, and hiking up and down our slopes. Should be ready for the trail come April. Still considering an early April start from Damascus, VA. This allows me to miss the dreaded ‘Bubble’ one encounters in March down in Georgia. As I move northward from Damascus I’ll initally be looking to finish Virginia by reaching the Luray area where Cap and I got off back in September.

Of course, this one came filled with Crunchy Butter-Pecan Ice Cream that I was obligated to do away with.

The only concern I have is the light material used in the flooring. I’ve been doing this a number of years now and know how a tent floor takes a beating, even with a ground cloth (which I always use).  So I may try to get in touch with them to see if I can special order The One with a slightly more durable floor.

This would allow me to jump over roughly 200 miles of the trail I covered last year. Anyway, he says he can help me if that’s what I choose to do. Who knows, by the time I get to Thornton Gap I may be on such a roll that I’ll opt to just keep walking. Wouldn’t mind hiking over much of that beautiful section again anyway. A friend has agreed to drive me up to Damascus in early April to get started. I’m trying to talk Cap into coming along. He’s thinking about it. Okay then, roughly five to six more weeks to wait and train. It’ll go by fast, I’m sure. Lots to do here around the cabin before I leave.","

Looking forward to our hike. The plan right now is to start out from Damascus, Virginia headed NOBO. I’m sure we will be taking it slow and easy early on. No need to rush. Just being out there, enjoying the trail and fellow hikers, is just as important as logging in the miles.Been reading lots of TJ journals of hikers from the last couple of years as they traversed the section between Damascus and Daleville. Seems that there have been a number of issues with pesky bears at a number of the shelters through that stretch. In fact, at least one Shelter, possibly two, were closed to Hiker use for a time, and may even yet be closed. Glad to read of how the ATC and Park Service has installed more bear boxes at many of these shelters. That should help as the bears only want food. Looking forward to seeing the Grayson Highlands and the ponies. Have hiked some of this section before, up around Atkins and Bland, and am anxious to revisit a beautiful part of the trail. So much to do around the house in the coming weeks to prepare for my departure. Looking forward to the temperatures to get more agreeable. Pity those who are out there early slogging through the Georgia and Carolina section. It’s been cold, very wet, and extremely windy out there. Not fun!","
",2020 Launch in Sight,"Mar 07, Sat",0
Woody,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627162,"I’ve known, for years now, how easy it is for hikers to feel somewhat detached from the world while walking for days and weeks in the woods. Out there, many of the concerns and stirrings that occupy the lives of others, don’t seem to matter with quite the same intensity. But that has all changed with this latest global scourge, this COVID 19 Virus, which is impacting all our lives in dynamic ways. To try and stop the spread of the virus our government, both federal and state, has issued harsh mandates that have impacted even the lives of AT hikers. The ATC also has urged us to suspend or postpone our hiking plans for this season. With the closing of many hostels, the shutting down of restaurants and shuttle services, and the restrictions placed on train, bus, and plane travel, it is not surprising to see many members of the Class of 2020 changing their plans. In fact, I’m surprised that so many of those who started early are able to remain out on the trail.  From the photos they don’t seem to be minding the warnings from the ATC to avoid the shelters and privies. Anyway, all that is to say that my own plans for this season are on hold. I’m still sitting at home chomping at the bit to be out there, but am willing to wait a month or so to see if this pandemic will begin to pass and our lives can return to some measure of normalcy. Meanwhile, I’m giving myself to a number of home improvements and repairs while prepping my gear for the possibility of a hike. I remain hopeful, but witnessing all the distress in our communities and the lives of my neighbors, I’m willing to do what I can to help block the spread of this affliction by staying close to home, for now.","

Woody,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627200,"Waiting has never been an activity I have loved or excelled in. So while waiting out this Virus thing, I decided there were profitable ways to occupy myself.
I continue to get out and walk (with a light pack) as often as I can. Got in 8.5 miles today. Just trying to stay trail ready. But today I thought I’d begin to experiment with a few no-cook meal ideas. For lunch today I mixed up some Instant Potatoes in my Talenti jar and then added a pouch of Thai Curry Tuna. I have to say it was surprisingly good. Earlier this morning I mixed up some Instant Milk in the jar and added my granola cereal. I’ve been using a brand that includes almonds and cranberries and dried apples. Absolute YUM!  So, all in all, I think that I should be in better shape come late May or June to hit the trail and perhaps give this no-cook plan a go. 
In the meantime, there are many other things I’ve yet to do. Still have to treat all my clothes with permethrin. Still need to become a bit more familiar with setting up and taking down my new Tarptent. Still need to cut a new ground cloth for the tent. And beyond that I still need to get to Lowe’s for new decking lumber to replace some boards on our deck before I depart for places unknown. So the next month or so will be busy — while I wait!","

I keep hearing conflicting reports on this Virus. The worst reports make it seem as if the 2020 season is a complete loss. The best reports seem to hold out hope that by mid-May or early-June some of us should be able to head out safely. Perhaps by then the panic will be over and communities all up and down the trail will once again be open for business. One can only hope. 
I keep hearing of entertainers giving on-line concerts and performances to encourage people during this time of quarantine and it got me thinking about Damascus Trail Days which has been canceled for this year. How sad!  So how about if all of us were to celebrate Trail Days this year, virtually, by sharing thoughts and photos from past gatherings?  Hey, we could each set up our tents in our own backyards — gotta keep that social distancing thing going — fill the cooler with cold beverages, fill up our water pistols, and come together virtually for a 2020 Trail Days experience! Ha!
On a saner note, I do hope to be out there somewhere in the trail by then. To that end, I continue to prep, putting in somewhere around 30-40 miles a week. Feel good and raring to go!","

I sent a message to our President a week ago, asking him to use his influence to reopen the National Parks, and within days I learned he was taking steps to do just that. Fantastic!  So, perhaps within the next couple of weeks I can get back to walking. The photo posted is from a year ago when Cap and I were in Harpers Ferry to begin what turned out to be a section hike. This go around I’m still planning a Damascus, VA start, heading northward to finish the trail in Virginia. Last week I called the folk up at MRO in Damascus to ask some questions regarding hikers passing through town and attitudes at these times of town folk toward these hikers. I was much encouraged that most feel as do I, that there has been much hype surrounding this crisis, made worse by politicians and opinion-news folk all for selfish and political gain, and that it was time to reopen our Country, let people get back to work and doing what they love to do. So, I’ve some scrambling to do in the next couple of weeks to pull my gear together, treat my clothing, ready my food bag, before heading out.

I’ve a friend who has agreed to shuttle us from my home here south of Asheville up to Damascus, Virginia on May 19. From there the plan is to hike out northward. I have no idea how far we will go or how long it will take us to get there. At present I’m still nursing a sore knee which I hope improves greatly over the next couple of weeks. Lots to do before we depart. I’m in the midst of replacing the staircase up to the deck at my cabin. Huge project and I hope I’ve not bitten off more than I can chew. But I’ve got to get this finished before I can leave. Was browsing in our local supermarket today to pick up a few items for my food bag and get ideas for other items to secure later. Need to set aside a sunny day soon to treat my clothing and let them dry. Also need to cut out a sheet of plastic for a ground cloth.

Finally went to have it checked out. X-ray shows a chip or broken piece of cartilage just below my knee cap which the Doc wants to remove. It’s rubbing on the ACL, causing the discomfort and posing the risk of further damage. So, I’m considering my options. But looks as if my hiking plans are on hold for the Summer. Sad!","

Woody,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630906,"Had hoped I’d be able to get back to the trail this Fall and finish Virginia. After much discussion, CAP and I decided that there were just too many frustrating obstacles to make that plan possible. This continues to be one crazy year. 
In any event, I will be shifting my focus ahead to 2021 and hope it will prove you be a better year for hikers. I’ll be shifting my journal to the class of 2021 in the coming days. 
So now I have six months to decide what I want to do in the coming year. Part of me just wants to drop down to Springer and give a thru hike another try. Another option is to try to get back up to Boiling Springs, PA and continue northward with the aim to finish the trail. If I choose this option I could always drop back down to Boiling Springs and hike south to finish a thru hike. It’s something to ponder. 
In the meantime I hope to continue with my training. I feel real good about where I am right now. I’ve been able to lose about thirty pounds since June. Feel great and stronger. So I’ll just keep working to stay trail ready and continue in dialogue with CAP to nail down a 2021 plan.","

Woody,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631330,"What does a hiker do to keep ones mind focused and his enthusiasm up while waiting for a chance to get back to the trail?  It’s tough. I’m still trying to get out nearly every day, rain or shine, to log in some more training miles, trying to stay trail-ready. But it’s hard to stay motivated. That’s one of the reasons why I’m seriously considering linking up with two special friends, ForceFlex and Curly (2018) to hike the Foothills Trail the week after Christmas. From speaking with them, and conversing with Mule (2021), I’m led to believe the FH Trail may be a good tune up for hitting the AT in 2021. It runs about 80 miles along the South and North Carolina State line with some serious climbs and tons of beautiful waterfalls. So, I’ll work to clear my calendar to make it happen. Beyond that, there remain many decisions to make toward next year. Still wrestling with direction, starting location, and start date. In other words, nearly everything is still up in the air. But I’m confident things will fall into place. It will be interesting to see what the ATC will do in the coming year regarding Covid, for it certainly is not going to go away quickly, if ever. At least we can hope for a more sensible handling of the situation and a discarding of the ‘shutdown’ mentality of 2020.","

I don’t mind the cold so much, but it’s the wind that really gets to me. Hard to plug along for hours and miles with a cold wind hitting you in the face. Oh well, it’s a toughening thing, right?Am working out plans to accompany several good friends for a hike of the Foothills Trail the week after Christmas. The FT runs along the top of South Carolina, occasionally jumping up into North Carolina, for about 80 miles. I’ve never been on it, so I’m looking forward to the experience. Should be a nice excursion and a real test of some of my cold weather gear. Still mulling over my options for the coming year. With 2020 being such a disappointment, I’m hoping things work out to spend some quality time on the trail in 2021.

My own time during the season was a truly enjoyable one and Santa even brought me a couple of needful items for my pack. As I try to look ahead into the coming year, I’m finding it difficult to envision just what to expect. It would seem that this virus thing is going to continue to impact the trail and hiking communities this hiking season. The ATC already is issuing their dire warnings and prohibitions, all designed to discourage as many of us as possible from hitting the trail this year. So, with all the possible impediments involved, I’m trying to give some serious pondering of my aspirations. I’ll be 69 in February and would like to take advantage of these remaining years of opportunity to cover the trail while I physically am able. Had thought about heading out on or around my Birthday, February 19. Not a real fan of cold weather camping, however, and this winter may linger well into March. But it’s still a possibility. Condition wise I feel I’m ready. My gear is ready and I’ve only a few home-based items to clear up before I’d head out. So, all I have to do is work out my plan. I do believe, because this past year was so disruptive to so many, that the ‘Bubble’ moving northward from Springer in mid-March might possibly be huge!  I certainly want to avoid that.

While out on one of my training walks, I was sideswiped by a passing motorist. Several of my routine routes include some road walking, and most of the time there is no problem. Once in a while you may encounter a driver who refuses to slow down or move over when passing you by. Some will angrily honk at you. Haven’t had anyone throw anything at me yet. But yesterday was different. As I was making my way up the road, involving a 1,000 foot climb to the top of Pinnacle Mountain, I could see a vehicle approaching. At first it appeared to be moving over, but then, suddenly it redirected itself right for me. I, of course, quickly took evasive action but not before the side view mirror exploded on my right hip and the side of my backpack. The driver never even slowed down. No real damage done. The impact knocked me sideways a bit and seemed to tweak my lower back which is sore today. But God is Good and His Providence protected. A scary moment, none the less.

I’d like to say that I’ve fully recovered, but alas, that’s not the case. I’ve been to see my chiropractor for numerous adjustments, and can tell that it’s helping and progress is being made, but the pain in my lower back and right leg tells me that I’ve still a ways to go before I can strap on the old backpack and hit the trail. Hopefully February will be sufficient time to get me all aligned properly once again. Still in dialogue back and forth with CAP and Jack about an early March start from the Hot Springs area. This would allow us to skip over the snow and ice in the Smokies and put us well ahead of the Georgia’bubble’. Anyway, it’s a plan. We’ll see how things develop over the next few weeks. Can’t say I’m shocked or surprised by the ATC’ continued push to discourage hikers from using the trail. But for an older hiker with reasonable years of opportunity running thin, it may come down to a position of going ahead, cautiously, irregardless of their preference. Should be an interesting year.","

Woody,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632586,"As I sit here, rehabilitating from my injury, I’ve opportunity to ponder the whole business of long-distance hiking from a different perspective. I am reminded of others, from an earlier generation, who seemingly thought nothing of the travails and hardships associated with treading out long miles on foot. I reflect upon their amblings and am humbled by my own hesitant fears. John Clement Evans, one of my wife’s ancestors, was a member of the 15th Alabama Infantry in the Civil War. That regiment served as part of the Army of Northern Virginia under Gen. Robert E. Lee and was involved in a number of key battles, including the Battles of Gaines Mill Farm and Cold Harbor. John was severely wounded in Cold Harbor in June of 1862 and taken to a hospital in Richmond. He was later released, honorably discharged due to medical disabilities, including the loss of his left eye. Now, here’s the interesting part, he then walked home from Richmond to Troy, Alabama, still recovering from his wounds. Amazing!  I remember hearing my own father speak of when he was a much younger man, living in central North Carolina, and thought nothing of rising early to walk several counties away (20-30 miles) to go hunting and then to return home with his game. Kinda puts this AT endeavor in a new perspective. Hopefully I’ll continue to recover from being hit by that car in early January, and will be able to proceed with my plans to hike the trail this year. And perhaps, then, the meager ten, twelve, or even twenty miles a day won’t seem so daunting. One can hope!","

Snakebit and I left out around 7:00 to make our way up the trail. There were several things that concerned me today. One, I was hiking with a thru-hiker that had been on the trail for over a month and I was not sure if or how I was going to keep up. Two, the climb today had several significant climbs, one over 2,000 feet and I knew that my tired legs from yesterday were going to be pushed to their limit. Three, the weather forecast was calling for cold and rain. Not fun!As it turned out, I had no trouble keeping pace with Snakebit and the cold and rain didn’t hit us until the last three hours of the hike. Unfortunately, those last six miles from the shelter down to the road were grueling. The footing was extremely rocky the entire way, chewing up our feet and ankles, as the wind picked up and the cold set in. By the time we reached the road my hands felt like ice!  At some point after we left Chestnut Knob Shelter we decided to make for VA 623 and go down to the Mountain Garden Hostel for the night. The temps were to fall to the low forties with cold rain in the forecast. So we called ahead, made reservations for bunks, and the pickup was there at the road waiting for us when we stumbled in. Funny thing (or not so funny) is that several of us, the night before, were toying with the idea of doing a slack pack over the 17.8 miles from VA 623 back down to Bear Garden Hostel. That plan fell apart. I never would have believed that the next day, not only would I do those 17.8 miles, but with my full pack and northbound, the harder direction. Crazy!Anyway, we are warmly settled into the hostel and have eaten, showered, and our dirty clothes are in the wash. I’m hurting quite a bit. Overdid it today and something out here is really messing with my allergies. Also, I got so cold in those lastly few hours that even now my core doesn’t want to warm up.

Snakebit and I made it down to Jenkins Shelter and found Basco sitting there having a snack. So we dropped packs and joined her. She told me her mother would be waiting for her down at Laurel Creek and would give me a ride into Bland if I felt my feet needed it. We hiked on. The trail led up a long climb at first, but then began a very nice slow descent into Laurel Creek. We had just finished eating lunch there when Basco’ mom drove, and soon thereafter Basco walked in.
