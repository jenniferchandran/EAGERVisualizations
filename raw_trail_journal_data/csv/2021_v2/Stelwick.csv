Stelwick,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645787,"It's been quite a while since I have done a trip report here. While I planned and canceled a couple of trips - Pine Mountain Trail (because of heat) and the Bartram Trail (injury, weather) - I have done some backpacking. Last Thanksgiving Kelly and I did a great loop hike in the Smokies. Our first time backpacking there and we loved it. We also spent a few days at the beginning of June on the Mountains-to-Sea trail with Aunt Donna, before weather forced us off the trail. 
The week of Thanksgiving we are headed back to the Appalachian Trail for the first time in several years, and our first time back on the Georgia portion since in many years. We did the section between Amicalola Falls and Neels Gap many 4 or 5 years ago, but since then our time on the AT has been in North Carolina. We decided to finish off the miles we have left, hiking from Deep Gap, NC and heading southbound to Neels. 
There's been some gear and food changes since my last journal (Foothills Trail) and I will detail those in a subsequent post. This will also serve as a shakedown/training hike for me as I prepare to hike the section of the Benton Mackaye Trail through the Smokies.",,View Entry,"Nov 14, Sun",0
Stelwick,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645836,"Some changes, and some things stay the same regarding gear and food. Since my last journal I have transitioned to a tent, as I felt it will allow me to set up and break down faster when on high-mileage trips. I purchased a TarpTent ProTrail and ThermaRest NeoAir. That combo has been on a few trips and I've been very happy. I actually think I sleep better than in my hammock. I am also adding a pillow for this trip, the Sea-to-Summit Aeros Ultralight. For my top quilt I use the same one as for my hammock, one from Hammock Gear.Food remains mostly the same, with a change for dinners. I stayed with oatmeal for breakfast and Lara Bars/Kate's for snacks. I was dehydrating all my lunches and dinners but had some concerns about the amount of calories, especially at dinner. So I decided to do dehydrated meals for lunch and bring Peak Refuel meals for dinner. Delicious and lots of calories!Weather looks good, albeit a bit cold a couple of nights. Off to Georgia tomorrow!",,View Entry,"Nov 19, Fri",0
Stelwick,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645902,"We drove up to Blairsville, GA on Saturday, November 20th and spent the night. The morning of the 21st we dropped our car off at the Byron Reese Trailhead and were picked up by Ron Brown for our shuttle over to Deep Gap, NC. Ron had shuttled us before, and it was great to see him again. He's a character but truly cares about the people he shuttles. He made sure we were aware of any water issues and gave me some hand warmers (these turned out to be sorely needed!). 
It was a relatively easy day with only a few climbs. We got to camp around 4. We set up our tents and then ate dinner with a SOBO thru-hiker, Bear, who was planning to finish the trail on Thanksgiving Day. We had a great conversation with him about the trail, gear, life, etc. Around 9 the expected rain started and continued until about 2 or 3 a.m.
Some additional people had come to the shelter after we retired to our tents, so we ate breakfast in our tents before packing up and heading out. Because of the rain, we packed up wet tents, adding some weight to our packs. ","Deep Gap (NC)

Stelwick,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645903,"Today,s mileage was the longest of the trip - 15.5. It was probably the hardest day too, with a lot of steep climbs. I got gassed on the climb out of Dick's Creek Gap. And the climb up to Tray Mountain was rough as well. But we did have some wonderful views along the way.The story of this day was the end. Once we arrived at the very full Tray Mountain Shelter (Boy Scout groups) the temperature had already dropped to 35 degrees and the wind was blowing something fierce. We struggled to put up our tents in the wind, and both of us were on a bit of an incline. By the time we were set up the light was almost faded for the day. We cooked in our vestibule and ate sitting in our tents, with our quilts over us to stay warm (this would become a theme). I forced myself to eat as much of my dinner as I could, but didn't have much of an appetite. I ate most of it, though. We ventured outside one last time to hang the bear bags, then hurried back to our tents to stay warm. The temperature continued to drop and the wind continued to blow - hard. It was going to be a long night. ","Plumorchard Gap Shelter

Stelwick,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645904,"It was a long night. The wind blew hard until around 3 a.m. Once it stopped it was peaceful, but cold. Both of us were under our 20 degree quilts but had on base layers, fleece, puffy, hat, buff, and warm socks (in my case, two pair). We weren't cold but it wasn't comfortable, either. My thermometer on my bag said 21 degrees. Later, when packing up, a gentlemen nearby said he left his outside all night and it read 19 degrees. This was easily the coldest night we spent outside.
We again cooked and ate in our tent to keep warm, then began the slow process of packing up. A lot of things were semi-frozen and packing up took longer than usual. Once we started walking we felt better.
It was a slow morning, though. We only made it to Unicoi Gap (6 miles) by lunch. We had to decide whether to stop early or make a push to Low Gap Shelter (9 miles away). The elevation profile showed that once we made the climb out of Unicoi Gap the trail flattened out, so we decided to go for it. Fortunately, the guide was right and we were able to make great time, reaching camp around 4:30. We set up and then ate dinner with a couple from West Virginia who were hiking from Springer Mountain to the GA/NC border. Good conversation, nice people. That night wasn't nearly as cold and almost no wind. Temperature only got down to 28 degrees.
After a quick breakfast (in our tent!) we broke camp and headed out for our last day.","Tray Mountain Shelter

Stelwick,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645905,"We were hoping to have a quick, easy day, but the trail wasn't going to let us off that easy! We had an easy descent leaving the shelter, then two big climbs - out of Hogpen Gap up to Wildcat Mountain, and out of Testnatee Gap up to Cowrock Mountain. The last one felt especially difficult. After a quick lunch just past Cowrock we made the long climb down to Neels. The Georgia section of the AT was officially done!
I left my pack with Kelly and made the quarter-mile road walk to the car. Picked up Kelly and made our way to Unicoi State Park and Lodge, where we had reservations for two nights and for Thanksgiving dinner. ","Low Gap Shelter

Even wore them to bed a couple of nights. No complaints but I need to replace them with a new pair; mine are about 6 years old and have some tears.

First time using it and it's the best purchase I've made for backpacking in quite some time. While I like having the Kindle I only used it one night.Breakfast was my usual oatmeal. Instead of bringing a cup prior to the trip I cleaned out an old Peak Refuel bag and used that. Great tip from YouTube. Lunches were various foods we dehydrated at home - chili, taco meat and refried beans, dehydrated turkey and Stove-Top. Kelly brought additional dehydrated meals for dinner, but I brought pre-packaged dinners from Peak Refuel. Love their food. No changes here.Next up for me is a traverse of the Smokies along the Benton Mackeye Trail, from Big Creek Campground to Fontana. Stay tuned!",,View Entry,"Nov 27, Sat",0
