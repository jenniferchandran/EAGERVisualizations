Drink more than my normal water and have to get up at 4am to pee, or drink normal and deal with leg cramps at night.  Hmmm...think I’ll go with first option...","Wilson Creek Shelter

Pagne Senior,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634490,"It is with a great deal of remorse and sadness to say I’m off the AT. Change in priorities. I regret setting expectations for so many, but primarily regret not spending months on the trail with Brandon.

Pagne Senior,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634587,"Probably appropriate to add some words about my abrupt AT termination. No injuries involved. Just a lot of reflection on priorities while pushing up the trail carrying a 35'ish pound backpack, as well as tons of time to ponder ""what if's"" while laying in a tent for well over 10 hours/night. Ultimately decided I can support Brandon very well, knowing a lot more about what to expect on the trail, plus I can address other personal priorities versus putting everything on hold for 6 months. But I'm not putting the gear away for good. Brandon will see me on the trail a bit more before he summits Springer Mountain in the fall.","Stanimals Hostel in Glascow

Pagne Senior,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636312,"Back on the trail after a month. While I missed it, it was nice to golf several times and go to some of my granddaughters softball games. Sleeping in a bed every night wasn’t bad either.
Met Pagne in Boiling Springs, PA (I go by Pagne Senior now). Got on the trail before noon, and had 14+ miles to shelter. Since I definitely don’t have trail legs, and he does, he had me lead almost all day. After about a mile, I asked if I weren’t with, how fast would he be going? (I thought I was moving pretty fast). Pagne’s reply was “a little faster”.   ....I didn’t say anything about speed after that...
Whereas when we started in Daleville, it was several days of decent hills. Today was only one hill of substance, but temp was in low 80’s. Supposed to be cooler the rest of the week...after it rains tonight and tomorrow morning.
Nevertheless, was a good day. Plan it to hike about 100 miles.","Boiling Springs
",Darlington Shelter,"May 04, Tue",14.30
Pagne Senior,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636375,"Yesterday was hot, but I knew today was going to be a lot cooler and a shorter day so really looking forward to it.  And, while there was a chance of rain (as there is most days this week), it was only 60% chance.
It drizzled from 10:30-11:30 last night but then stopped, so I thought Good!!   ....until it started drizzling again before 6. And continued to drizzle/rain until 11.  With another shot of rain an hour later.  Needless to say, everything was soaked when we got to the hostel.
And with everything being wet, and the trail being mostly rocks, use of the hiking poles was absolutely necessary. And with soaked trail and lots of rocks, was too easy to poke into a hole and almost get it stuck as I continued on.  But I was successful at retrieving the pole before I pulled it and broke the pole.  ...until the last 1/4 mile. And the outdoor store here in Duncannon just sold their last hiking poles last week.  Bummer.
Still a good day","Darlington Shelter

Pagne Senior,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636465,"Today was a very good day.  Started the day with good breakfast with several other hikers (Cooper, Sound Scape, and Buttercup). And met several others along the trail. Always interesting.
Mostly sunny, and high in the 60’s. And while it’s the most I’ve done in a day on the AT, without the heat or the rain, it was excellent!
I was able to somewhat repair my busted hiking pole, with the help of Betsy Webb at Outdoorsy. It made it thru today and I suspect it’ll still be good in a few days.
Only downside today was a little tumble on some of the PA rocks.  But no stitches to the elbow necessary and the blood should mostly wash out.  ...I hope...
Hope to get to a shelter tomorrow before the rains start.  Hiking in hard rain really isn’t that much fun.","Kind of Outdoorsy hostel in Duncannon
",Campsite at 1165.6,"May 06, Thu",16.40
Pagne Senior,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636608,"Got going a little early today. Rain predicted by early afternoon and increasing in intensity thru late afternoon / evening, so we wanted to get to the shelter before it started.
Made it in plenty of time, and were eating a later lunch when drizzle started.
I got moving earlier than Pagne this morning and was finished & ready to go while he was finishing breakfast. So I headed out assuming he’s catch me by the first hill (about a mile down trail).  But after a short down hill and corresponding up hill, it was pretty flat. So I was feeling pretty good when Pagne finally caught up 5 miles later!  ...then he said he talked to another camper for a while and didn’t really leave for 25 minutes after I did.  So, I had a mile head start...and he caught me in 4!  So I go back to previous comment: not talking about speed anymore.
Finally saw first critter: a mouse.  And had to nudge him to ensure he was alive.  Not overly exciting.
Trail was a mix of small/medium rocks with a few stretches of bolders, but there were fortunately some flat almost only dirt parts.
Elbow stopped bleeding and butt not real sore from yesterday’s fall. But that fall did verify that PA rocks don’t give.
It’s early in the afternoon, but can’t really do anything.  Time for a nap","Campsite at 1165.6
",Rausch Gap Shelter,"May 07, Fri",13
Pagne Senior,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636614,"Well, it did indeed rain most of the afternoon and evening yesterday. Fortunately done by morning, but certainly everything was very wet.
I note aromas because they seemed to be more prevalent today. Perhaps because of the rain, but the smell of flowers was everywhere on the trail, especially in the morning. Very nice.
As with yesterday, I left a little before Pagne. The good news is I didn’t go off trail once!   However, I did go off trail twice...  (neither Pagne nor daughter Bonnie have ever accused me of being observant).  First mid-direct I chose to not reverse direction and correct: it appeared in Guthook hiking app that I’d intersect with the AT again.  Well, I did.  ...and continued straight on the wrong path.  But this time I reversed in just a few minutes.
Meanwhile Pagne was trying to figure out where the heck I was! Cell coverage magically occurred and with some texts and mileage points, we finally rejoined.
Had another first. Came across a stream with only (apparent) crossing was on a huge downed tree trunk.  About 8-10’ across the quickly running stream. Of course, it was wet and slimy and slippery. She’s The One was already about half was cross, so I watched silently till she finished. Then I followed. Successfully. But 20’ later was another crossing: no log. And with no other options visible, it was shoes/socks off, put on camp shoes (flip-flops), and cross. No disasters for either of us and we came out with (cold) clean feet!
Later when caught up to Pagne, found out that he’d gone the opposite direction from the trail and did NOT have to wade across.  Oh well.
Had some great stretches on ridges which was flat and smooth! Also some with very large PA rocks. Variety.
Got briefly rained on late today, and then again briefly when eating at the shelter.  More tonight likely.  And a frickin’ freeze warning!! Low in upper 30’s!
May not be an early start tomorrow...","Rausch Gap Shelter
",William Penn Shelter,"May 08, Sat",13.60
Pagne Senior,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636677,"Today, like Friday, was hurried in order to get to a campsite before the rain. And, as Friday, it’s going to result in sitting in the tent for hours listening to the rain.
But decent start today. A little late because everything was wet and it was so chilly, leaving the warm sleeping bag wasn’t easy.
With only 10’ish miles for the day, there wasn’t a huge rush. ..until we looked at the forecast again and the chances of rain were going up earlier than they were yesterday.
But even with that, we were in good shape...until we were close to the campsite. And hurrying before we got wet. The trails these past several days are almost always rocky: sometimes maybe 20% rocks and other times there’s almost no soil to be seen.  Even on flat trail, that takes it’s toll on the concentration.  But in this case, it also can result in head down looking at trail and missing a turn.
NO, I wasn’t in the lead this time! Pagne was!  (although looking for blazes isn’t any one’s specific task....I missed the turn too)
Once we realized the site was getting further away, logic took over.  We missed it. And the rain was approaching.
So we reversed and Pagne took off. I followed as best I could but these ankles aren’t as limber so slower over the rocks. At one point there was a blaze before a downhill, with a short side trail to a scenic overlook. And there was a blaze right there.  I mushed forward (with Pagne long out of sight) but after several minutes I realized “no blazes to be seen!”  So I turned around and went to scenic overlook looking for more blazes.  Nothing.  And it started to drizzle.  So I covered my pack, put on raincoat, and got out phone to text “Where are you?”
Back and forth a bit and turns out that blaze’less trail was correct. I took off down that trail (again) while Pagne (who had found the campsite) left his pack and doubled back to find me. A few yells and whistles later, I found him and then the tent site.  Oh....did I mention it was still drizzling?
Got to camp. Both of us set up in drizzle. Now enjoying the sound of rain hitting the tent 5 inches from my head. And it’s only 2:30.
I guess time for a nap, then dinner, and then to bed.
Boy, what fun...!","William Penn Shelter

Pagne Senior,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636764,"Today was a good day, even if it was longer than planned. Starting the day with no rain in the forecast was a pleasant change. 
Really nothing exciting as long as you don’t include Pennsylvania rocks. There’s a lot of them.
And the other good part of the day is I only fell twice. No blood so no foul.
When we got to our intended stopping point, the tent area really didn’t have a good place for the tents so we decided to push on a few more miles into town. There was a half mile of steep rocky downhill just before town to make things a little more exciting. Which it did.
Pagne found a town park/pavilion that was hiker friendly, so even though it added another quarter-mile, we’re tenting here. River on one side and busy highway the other side. But I doubt that will cause us to lose sleep.

Great way to finish!
Whether I return for more fun or not is TBD. Thanks for listening.","Hertline Tent site
