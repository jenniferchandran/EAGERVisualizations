Zombie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646233,After a long break from hiking AT started out SOBO from Hanover.  I had just done a 60 mile SOBO hike on Long Trail from Cananda to Jeffersonville VT.  Weather was nice.  A bit chilly in the morning.  Made it to shelter about an hour before sunset and set tent up and got some water.  There was another couple hikers set up in shelter. We sat with them around the fire and had dinner.  Long day but a bit easier than the long trail was.,"Hanover New Hampshire

Zombie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646234,Hit the trail around 8.  Cold but clear skies.  Got to shelter around 3.  Decided enough for the day.  We were going to set up behind shelter but saw a lot of fresh moose poo so moved about 50 yards away.  Had 2 individual hikers come in who stayed in shelter. One was finishing a little section of a part he skipped on his thru hike in 2003 I believe.  We all talked for a few hours and drank some whiskey.  Fun night.  Never saw the moose but people wrote in Journal he was seen a couple times the week before.,"Thistle Hill SH
