Bro,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606600,"Since making the decision to thru hike the AT I have spent quiet a bit of time making equipment selections and trying to explain why to my wife.  Although she is not thrilled about the time on the trail she has somewhat reluctantly gone along with the plan.  It is exciting to know that each day on the trail will be different (sights, sounds, obstacles and opportunities) with an ultimate goal of completing the thru hike Georgia to Maine.","

After check-in (#301) I hiked to the top of the falls and checked in to the lodge for the night. No issue getting to the top of the falls, pretty view. Just the first mile of the Approach trail. Met a couple from New Hampshire at base of the falls and later in the lodge restaurant. Enjoyed talking about the trail and Tracy gave me a couple of pictures taken while I was hiking.
Have spent time just doing last minute checks and charging electronics.
Looking forward to tomorrow.","Visitors Center

Bro,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607413,"Hiked a total of 13.5 miles today. 6.2 miles on the AT.  The approach trail was tough in some sections. I met a hiker (trail named Three Days) who has a start date of March 20. He was from Atlanta and hikes the approach as part of his training. He has done it a number of times. This was my first and last. 
The weather has been nice, partly cloudy and in the 50’s. Got some directions from Bruce who works for the ATC and decided to hike to the Baptist pavilion since it was so nice.  I was ready to take a break once I got there since the last couple of miles had a pretty steady incline and it was a long day.
I decided to sleep in the tent instead of the pavilion since it isn’t raining and I think the tent would be warmer.
Ate, hung the bear bag and in my bag at 7:00 pm.","Amicalola Falls Lodge

Once the rain stopped it was a pretty good day. 
Toughest part was a climb over Sassafras Mountain.  Leaped frogged with a couple of others to Gooch Mountain Shelter. I did take a water break and soaked my feet in the river. The water was too cold to stay in long, however the next couple of miles felt great.
It has been nice talking to other hikers. Some who have completed a thru hike and a couple back to try again. Talked to 
“Stripes” (nice sounding French accent) who is from Montreal about a town where they still fly the Acadian flag.
There are several renters tonight and a number or in the shelter.

The plan was to hike till noon then decide where to stop. Eating lunch in the rain at Jarred Gap, made the choice to go over Blood Mountain.
Not much of a view today with all the rain. Was nice to take a break at the top. The backside was tough on the body, a lot of boulders and slick when wet. Had to work to prevent slips, trips and falls!
I was at the counter at Neel’s Gap and I mention I had a friend from high school who lived near here who I was going to contact. I turned around and he was standing right behind me. 
Had dinner with him and his wife. Great evening talking about old times, friends and hiking. It was definitely a highlight of the week.

Started the day hiking in the rain and it continued off and on most of the day. The hike seemed long today. The rain and mud makes it more difficult and not much to see. The shelter is full at Low Gap and there are a number of tenters tonight.  Tough little walk from my tent to the shelter and stream since it is down hill and muddy. Went ahead and got water for tomorrow.  Real windy tonight sounds loud rushing thru the trees.  Will try to get started earlier in the morning. Feels good to be lying down at 7:00 PM.","Neel’s Gap

Signed up to stay tomorrow night but will decide in the morning if I want to take a zero day.

There were some section hikers headed south. Only two had been on the trail last night and there only comments were about how cold it was.
Got to Carter Gap Shelter at 3:45 PM. Once I finished setting up and heating up dinner I am in bed just like everyone else.

About 2 miles down the trail was a simply beautiful view of the mountains and valleys. The best view of hike to date an a beautiful time of day. Today I passed the 100 mile mark and climbed to the top of Albert Mountain fire tower. 
While we were waiting for the city shuttle, the owner of the Baltimore Jack hostel gave us a free ride into Franklin.  Great guy with plenty of information and stories. Really enjoyed the ride.
I had a reservation at the Budget Inn. I couldn’t get my trekking pole fixed. Will try again tomorrow.  Long hot shower! Made a dinner and resupplied run.

There were a couple of long up hill sections today and several sections were very muddy from all the rain. In fact it is raining now. I camped on the ridge just past Cold Spring shelter.
On the way I met a couple from Florida section hiking. She said this was her first cold weather hike. Just before I got to the shelter I also briefly met City who is thru hiking.. they were all planning on staying in the shelter.

Much of the trail had puddles and mud. It is tough to avoid either while hiking.

I got to Nantahala Outdoor Center about 3:30.  Got some supplies and my Smoky Mountain Park permit.  Everyone was very helpful.

I decided not to go onto the next shelter which was another 2.4 miles and had a short tough elevation change. I called the Wolfcreek Hostel. Great place to stay.

Only problem was the climb out of Stecoah Gap was tough. 
The weather was great with plenty of sunshine.  Did see some “wildlife” - box turtle, toad, robin and a squirrel.
The down hill coming into Fontana Dam was long with a bunch of switchbacks. Tough on the toes. 
When I got to the shelter, Quarters was cooking hamburgers and hotdogs. Talk about great trail magic!!! He went to law school in Tulsa and was friends with a lawyer I know in Oklahoma. It was nice visiting around the fire. Several thru hikers are here including Joker, Alaska, Magnolia and Chillin.

Great 360 view of the mountains from the Shuckstack Fire Tower. 
I had planned to stop at Mollies Ridge Shelter, there were several people all ready there, so I went on to the next one. 
Sparky, a thru hiker from Switzerland, and l hiked together to the shelter. Joker, Young Gun and Cayenne showed up. 
All day you could tell when you switched sides on the ridges. On one side you got hit by a strong cold wind, on the other side was it was comfortable you warm. Tonight the wind is blowing big time at the shelter, and it is cold outside. Looking forward to getting in bed.","Fontana Dam Shelter

It was a brutal climb over Rocky Top and Thunder Mountain.  The wind gusts were bad enough, but add in the light rain and the fog it was not pretty. 
I met Halo and Joker at the Derrick Knob Shelter. I have followed Halo’s trail journal. I decided to go on to the Siler Bald Shelter. It seemed like a good idea at the time. I was pretty tired when I got there. Chillin, Que and a young section hiker are also here.

It was a good climb all the way to Clingman’s Dome.  This is the highest point in the Smoky Mountains and the highest point on the AT (6643 ft). Could not see much at the top because of the fog. About a half mile down finally saw sunshine. A lot of the trail had quite a bit of water and mud. 
While waiting for a ride at Newfound Gap a family from South Carolina stopped to talk. He was an enthusiastic hiker who was planning on hiking the AT. They had fruit in case they ran into thru hikers.  I ate all of it before I left the parking lot. Trail magic at its finest. Got a chance to ride with a nice guy, Rick. I enjoyed talking about hiking.  He has done a lot of hiking in the area. 
I got a room at the SureStay Hotel, made a resupply run, all you can eat at Cici’s, set up return to trail shuttle, and am enjoying watching some basketball. Going for a midday start tomorrow.

At one point I came out of the trees onto a small area of sunshine no more than about 100 ft in diameter. The  grass look almost like gold.  Just stood there for several minutes. You could just barely see the mountains thru the trees.

I am staying at the hostel tonight. Although I had lunch, I couldn’t resist a hamburger and a hotdog. Waiting on supper now, probably shortly after a shower. Couldn’t wait for pork chops, had a jalapeño dog and a bar b que pork sandwich. Had pork chop, bread and corn for dessert. Full now.

I really liked Max Patch.  It was a open field summit with no trees.  I stopped to talk to a couple headed up. It was their 42 anniversary and were taking a day hike to the summit.
I talked to Dusty . She started on the same day as me. We saw each other on Springer. I remembered when she told me she was with her husband and had a Husky.  I want to thank her sister Tara for following the trail journal.

I got a room above the tavern across the street.  Really nice room. Would have been nice to have a tv. There was a tv and food in the bar.  Great hamburger with a fried egg and hot wings. A local lady also had a clothes washing service. She had it done and delivered before I had finished eating.

Climbed to the top of RoanMountain to the site of the old Cloudland Hotel. This hotel was built in the late 1800’s. It was very nice. Interestingly it straddled the Tennessee and North Carolina border. There was a line in the hotel. On one side (Tennessee) you could drink liquor and the other was dry. 
There was a lot of ice on the trail. It was pretty heading down. The old road was lined with evergreen s that looked like Christmas trees.
From Yellow Mountain Gap to the top of Little Hump Mountain was was pretty tough. Then when you reached the top you saw Hump Mountain. There was a clear view of the trail as it went up. Tough hike with almost no switchbacks on either mountain.
I met Avatar on Hump Mountain. He is a south bounder(SOBO). He started the AT in Pennsylvania in December and will flip flop.

It was a short day today. The trail near Hampton ran to the base of Laurel Falls and along the river. It was so nice I stopped and had lunch while sitting on the bank. It was kind of strange sitting there watching all the people pass on their way to the falls. Almost no one had a pack of any kind. I felt kind of out of place hiking on the same trail when everyone seemed so casual. However it was nice walking next to the river. Walking into town had a different feeling.

It is the last peak before crossing into Maine.  There is a nice .2 mile summit ridge with several good views.  It started to cloud up and rain so I headed for Carlo Col Shelter.

It was a long day just getting to the shelter.  Even though physically it was a tough day the weather was prefect with a cool brisk breeze and the views were great. The peaks were exposed with an alpine ridge. I spent a lot of time lounging on the peaks.  Set up tonight and did not set an alarm. The plan is to take a zero in camp.,"Carlo Col Shelter

The plan is to go through Mahoosuc Notch and Arm.  The Mahoosuc Notch is described as the most difficult and most fun mile on the AT.  It is a maze of  boulders between two mountains. It is definitely unique. There are still patches of ice and areas were it is colder than air conditioning. There was also a stream with the best and coldest water.  In a couple of places I had to take off my pack to crawl through. After the notch is the Mahoosuc  Arm. A 1500 elevation climb in under a mile.  Would have been a nice view at the top but it has been raining all day. The trail has a lot of rock slabs making it more difficult in the rain. By the time I got to the shelter the wind was whipping and the temperature must have dropped 20 degrees. Set up in the rain and called it a night.,"Full Goose Shelter

The decent was fairly steep and long making it tough on feet and knees.  The climb up Moody Mountain was tough. Steep with a lot of rock steps and a few ladders. There was a good view across Sawyer Notch near the summit. Once I got to the top there was a really nice place to sit. The only problem, the black flies were out in force.  The trail down was steep also with plenty of rocks and steps.

It was a clear day and they say you can see as far as Mt Washington and Katahdin.  Not sure which they were but the 360 degree view was outstanding.   The Bigelow Avery Peak was named after Myron Avery the architect of the AT.  I stopped fairly early today. Coming down was long and hard on the knees. Also the next camping spot was a little farther than I wanted to hike to late in the day.  Spent a little time calling home before heading to bed.
