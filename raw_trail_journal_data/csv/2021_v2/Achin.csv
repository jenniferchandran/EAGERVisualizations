Achin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639004,"On the eve of my next adventure.  I’m sitting in a motel room in Killington, Vermont. That after traveling nearly 1,000 miles the last 2 days to get here.  


Started out about 4:30am Wednesday morning driving from home(Aiken,SC). Catching flights from Columbia,SC to Washington,DC and on to Boston.  Then a local bus to the South Station to catch a train to Worster,MA.  Got there about 2:20pm and picked up by my old hiking buddy Jeff.  Spent a nice evening at Jeff and Deb’s home including meeting their new Lab puppy named “Cat” (apparently Jeff’s attempt at canine humor).  Today we all drove about 4 hours to Killington.


Picture should be obviously Jeff, Deb and Cat.  One of them just had surgery to assure no offspring.  I’ll let you guess which one.


About 7:30 tomorrow morning Jeff and I will start hiking north on the AT.  We have not hiked together since 2014.  We met on the top of Springer Mountain the southern end of the Appalachian Trail on March 14, 2014.  For both of us it was the beginning of section hiking the AT going ever further north.  We pretty much hiked together until Erwin, TN (341 miles) when I went home the first time.  At that point Jeff continued on for awhile and got ahead of me.  Since then we have both returned to the trail where we last got off and did sections going north.  


We both feel that NH and Maine are more demanding and choose not to do them alone.  So we are teaming up for those states.  That leaves me Gap of about 200 miles between where we start tomorrow and where I last got off in 2019 at Salisbury, CT.  I plan to go back there alone at the conclusion of this hike and complete that section.  Then we both will have completed the entire AT except for Maine and a short section of NH totaling just under 300 miles.  A goal for next summer.

Had a pretty good first day of hiking.  Started at 7:30 at Gifford Woods SP and got 7.5 miles in by about 1:30pm.  There was one big climb of a little over 1,000 ft of elevation gain up Quimby Mtn.  The trail was nice in sections; but, overall lots of tree roots and rocks. That definitely slows down hiking speeds.  We both thought it wise to not push too much on the first day out.  Saw about 6 other hikers on trail today.  


We stopped in at a shelter about a half mile back for lunch.  It was nice enough and had a bear box. But we wanted to get a little further to even out today’s and tomorrow’s mileage.  Found a little camping area wedged in between two brooks that converge into one near our tent area.  Love the sound of gurgling water.  A drawback here is no bearbox.  So have to hang out food bags tonight.


All in all a good start.


Picture today is an unusual, but it is not the only, situation where there is assistance.  Believe it or not a few places there is no way around a rock wall.","Motel near Killington, VT

Another pretty good day in spite of an overnight rain shower.  Woke up about 3am and discovered raindrops splashing in through my open tent doors.  Took a few minutes to figure out how to stop that. My brand new tent is very similar to my old one but slightly different in that regard.


We started out about 6:40 this morning and made camp about 3:30pm.  Morning was wet from the rain but became dry and sunny later.  At lunch we made an extended stop off a side trail to a place called “The Lookout”.  It is a cabin atop a mountain with a steep wooden ladder to a platform on the roof.  A little scary on the ladder.  But the view was exceptional, tree covered mountains as as you could see in about a 270 degree panorama.


Met a few more long distance hikers today and about a dozen or more at or on their way to The Lookout.  Jeff and I missed a turn this afternoon and had to backtrack.  When we saw the sign for the turn, I could not believe we missed it earlier. Added over a half mile to our day.


Had a few significant climbs today.  Good training for what is coming up in NH.


Jeff had a little accident this evening.  While trying to hang his bear bag by throwing a little bag with a rock in it over a tree branch it came down and hit him on the top of his head.  Bled for awhile but does not appear serious.  Gave him some antibiotic to apply on it.

A long day today.  Did 12.3 miles from 8:30 until 5:00.  No big climbs, but several little ones.  


We box have a 3rd member of our group for awhile.  His hiker name is “Creature Feature” and he is from Maryland.  A few years younger than I and we hike at a similar pace.  We met at the last shelter and hiked a good part of today together.  Nice fellow.  He started hiking from his home in MD on March 29th.

A shorter day (8.8 miles) today to the next shelter.  We had slept in the last shelter instead of tenting due to the forecast of lots of rain overnight.  When we woke up it had not rained at all.  But before we were ready to leave it started.  So, on with the pack covers and rain gear.


It did rain softly for the first hour and then just overcast the rest of the day.  We did have several significant uphills today; but mostly downward paths as we ease out of the mountains down towards the city of Hanover, NH.  


Had my first fall today.  Slipped on a wet rock or root, not sure which.  Anyway no harm, not even any scrapes.


My food bag is the lightest it’s ever been.  Just some Cracklin Oat Bran cereal for breakfast and a little peanut butter left in my jar.  No problem, we should be in town for resupply by 10am.


Today’s picture is me in my bug net taken at home.  Heard so much about mosquitoes and black flies on VT and NH that I was very concerned. So far have been quite pleasantly surprised with very few bugs.  Have used neither the bug net; nor, any bug lotion.

An easy hiking day today in nice weather.  Mostly downhill going into town.  First town we hit was Norwich, VT.  A charming little town that the AT goes through.  Our first stop was a local food truck (see pic) where I had banana nut bread and a drink.  While Jeff went to a P.O. to send some items home, I got a frozen Snickers bar as well.


Only 1.5 miles later we were in Hanover, NH having crossed the bridge over the Connecticut River that divides the state.  It is the home of Dartmouth University.  We hit a CVS for some quick supplies, then a Starbucks(my first ever) while we waited for a shuttle driver from the hostel we’re going to for tonight(and get power into my phone battery). The hostel is back across the border in VT.   Before we got out of town we met an extremely nice Korean lady who wanted to know about our hike, trail journals, etc.  She insisted we take her name and number in case we needed anything.


Got a ride back into Hanover for a great dinner. Jeff and I were joined by hikers Birdman and Creature Feature.

Taking a “Zero” day today.  For anyone new that means no miles hiked.  A “Nero” is a very low mileage day (i.e.  near zero) usually into or out of town.


A new activity for me. We rented E-bikes.  Jeff owns one , my first time ever.  We rode into Hanover for lunch and again for dinner.  Pretty easy to get the hang of it.  And in this case eliminates the having to wait on shuttles.


span class=""Apple-converted-space""> We’ve tentatively planned “slack packing” hike today tomorrow.  That is where you are driven to a point further up the trail and hike back to the hostel.  The big advantage is only having to carry essentials for the day.  Many pounds out of the old pack pack allows much easier/faster hiking.


A pretty restful day….adding back some calories to the old body.

A new first time event today….slack packing.  Taking only items needed for a “day hike” my pack weighed about 16 pounds verses the normal 34-38 pounds.


Picture today is Jeff and I about ready to start out.  At about 3 miles into the hike at the top of a 1,000 foot elevation gain Jeff caught up to where I was waiting for him.  It was at this point he informed me he was calling an end to his hike.  Mostly foot issues; but also other factors came into play for the decision.  He called the shuttle driver and arranged for pick up back down the hill.


Feeling comfortable he would be alright, I decided to go on and hike back into Hanover.  There was soon another climb of somewhere around 1,400 feet.  I handled it fine and was encouraged about having a good day.  And I did.  In total I hiked 18.8 trail miles(and about half mile on a side trail accidentally).  Like the day before last, after the few early climbs the rest of the day was mostly on a glide path down out of the mountains into Hanover. Still, 18.8 miles is 18.8 miles.


For only the 2nd time in all my AT days, I saw a black bear on the trail. It was right on the trail about 40 yards in front of me.  I saw it before he saw me.  Then I made a little mistake in calling out “Hey” before I had my phone out to take a picture.  As soon as he heard and saw me, he took off.  Couldn’t get my camera on before he was lost in the woods.


My feet are just a little bit tender (no blisters or anything) after all I put them through today.  Leg muscles are somewhat fatigued but could have handled more.  All that walking and training at home proved worthwhile today.


All of today’s miles were in New Hampshire.  Even though the hostel we’re at both nights is in nearby VT.


So tomorrow Jeff and I head for his home in Massachusetts.  Stay tuned for what is to follow.","

A zero day today.  Although many miles were covered by Jeff and I. First a bus from Hanover, NH to Boston.  Then a commuter rail to his home in Worcester, MA.


Jeff prepared a fabulous meal that we all enjoyed very much.  Both Jeff and Deb have been so nice to this way faring guy.  Tomorrow Jeff is driving me most of the way and then I’ll have a shuttle driver take me the rest of the way to Salisbury, CT.  It is where I last got off the AT before this trip.  Starting about 10am, I should be back in the woods again.  Will be going north through the remaining few miles of CT, all of MA and the section of VT not yet done.  Very roughly about 200 miles.It is sad to know that Jeff and I will no longer be hiking partners.  But, we had a good run and enjoyed our times and experiences together.  I’m sure we will remain friends and see each other again.

Achin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639531,"Hike Conclusion 


Quite a change over night.  Thinking I’m continuing my hike when going to bed last night, to 2nd thoughts in the middle of the night and finally to early hours decision to go home and searching for travel options even before sunrise.


It is now 11am and I’m in Boston’s Logan airport waiting for my 12:37 pm flight to Atlanta.  Then later on today a flight to Augusta arriving at 5pm where Wendy will be picking me up.  Home by 6pm. 


I surprised Jeff and Deb with my decision.  Jeff drove me to the Worcester train station for a 7:10 departure that got me into Boston about 8:45.  A free transfer bus got me to the airport.  Jeff was surprised, as I said.  But also, as we talked we had mostly all the same reasons for stopping that I’ll detail below.  


One thing I will say is that physically I was quite ready.  I am going out on a positive note having easily completed the 18.8 mile hike on my last day.  For a 71 year old guy I was fully satisfied with my pre-training efforts and fortitude in the woods.  Absolutely no doubt that I could have gone on.It was fun to think that Jeff and I could be in position to finish off the entire 2,194 mile AT next year.  In the back of our minds however was the doubt that it may not be feasible.  Seemed inevitable that once again the reality of hiking day after day,  seeing virtually the same scenery you’ve seen before, enduring the less than desirable weather and knowing the hardest hiking was yet to come….would make oneself say “why are we doing this”?  Why endure more of the same if the ultimate goal of doing the whole AT is not the carrot dangling on the stick that it once was(to be an AT Thru-hiker).  So it ends.  The dream is over.


I am surely somewhat disappointed.  Will I change my mind again?  Wendy and I will respond with a loud “NO WAY”.  It is over.


As I’ve said many times since beginning the AT in 2014, I owe so much to Wendy for supporting my trips and enduring the lonely wife role back at home.


And to Jeff(aka Paul Bunion), we had a lot of fun times and is has been my pleasure to be your hiking buddy in 2014 and again this year.  Many thanks to you for all the memories and the hospitality you and Deb bestowed on me in your home.  We will remain friends.


So, with that I sign off Trailjournals for the final time.",,View Entry,"Jun 19, Sat",0

First of all I have to absorb a huge portion of “eating crow”.  If you read my previous post from 6/19/21, you may have thought I was done with the AT forever.  Well, what can I say. I was too premature in my announcement, once again!  Multi-year followers know I’ve said that several times before.  And I guess many of them did not believe me this based upon prior years. That certainly is understandable.


Shortly after my getting home I got a message from a hiking friend (Rockdawg) who I’ve hiked with previously a couple of times.  We have completed just about the same portions of the AT separately over the years.  And thus, have the same amount of AT left to complete.  His comment was “don’t tell me I have to complete this thing on my own”.


Well, here we are in a motel in Winchester, VA after meeting in Columbia, SC this morning and driving all day.  Tomorrow afternoon (Monday) we will arrive in Salisbury, CT where I will immediately begin hiking northward.   Rockdawg last got off the AT about 22 miles further up than I. On Wednesday midday I should get up to that point and we will hike together, ever northward from there.


Our plan is to hike to Hanover,NH.  That is a total of about 258 miles.  Should take a little over 3 weeks.


We’re keeping an eye on hurricane Ida which is hitting New Orleans very hard this afternoon.  We will probably get some rain in a few days.  Hope that’s all we’ll see.

Rockdawg and I left the motel in Winchester, VA at 7am and arrived in Salisbury, CT about 2:30pm.  Forgot to mention yesterday that we saw numerous convoys of cherry picker trucks heading south for hurricane Ida assistance.  There were some today but not as many.


Rockdawg is staying in a hostel in Salisbury since he has completed this section of the AT previously. We’ll meet up again Wednesday mid-day near Great Barrington, MA where he last got off the trail.  We’ll then be hiking together from there on.


After a visit to the market in Salisbury for a deli sandwich to bring with me, I started hiking in beautiful (although a little too warm) sunny skies at 3pm.  Seemed like I had lucked out on the weather.  However about 5pm it started drizzling, so I stopped and put my rain cover on my backpack. Did not bother with my rain jacket since I was soaked from sweat already anyway.  The last 45 minutes it rained buckets.  The trail turned into a river in many places.  Just minutes before arriving at tonights shelter the rain stopped.


There are about 13 other people at this shelter.  One other gentleman from Long Island, NY doing a section hike.  The rest are college freshmen out on orientation from Trinity College.


I was able to eat, set up my tent, get water and get settled in before it started raining again.  In my favor is that there is a Bear Box here so I did not have to hang a bear bag.  As I’m writing this it is raining again.  No cares as I am safely snuggled in my tent.

Unlike yesterday, no rain today,  However yesterday’s clothes were still soaked this morning. So, wearing back-ups, I attached all the wet clothes to the outside of my pack. When I stopped for lunch they had hardly dried at all.  Found a rock outcropping bathed in sunshine and laid out the clothes.  In about an hour they were mostly dry.


It was a quite hard hiking day today.  Lots of rock walking including long periods of stepping up and down and having to scale slanted rock slabs. It totally wore me out. Taking Aleve in anticipation of my over worked muscles letting me know they do not appreciate it.  I barely averaged a little over 1 mile per hour.  That is really slow.


Meeting up with Rockdawg about 10:30 tomorrow and hope to make it to a shelter before the bad weather from hurricane Ida arrives.


A sad time for me today.  I lost my orange ball cap that has been with me for all my AT miles. Noticed a few minutes after starting out after lunch.  Went back to the rock outcrop where I had lunch and then about a quarter mile beyond that before giving up on it. Felt like I lost a true friend.

So as of last night the plan was for me to hike early to meet Rockdawg at highway US 7 just south of Great Barrington, MA at 10:30am.   The 10:30 target was an aggressive one; but, needed if we were to have a chance of making the next shelter before remnants of hurricane Ida hit.


I started hiking right as it was light enough to do so safely.  That meant doing all the morning chores in the dark or scant morning light.  That includes: getting dressed, taking down/stowing the tent, getting food bag from the bear box, eating, privy visit, deflating/stowing air mattress, packing up backpack, etc.


From talking to the 5 other hikers at the shelter last night I knew about the first 3 miles today were a rocky trail.  Then became a nicer path without much inclined to worry about.  After the first 3 rocky miles I was thinking I’d never make the 10:30 rendezvous.  But I pushed on hard once the nicer pathway appeared.  I came walking (soaking wet from hours of light rain) across the field from seeing a parked car at US 7.  It was 10:40, just missed the target.


In the shuttle drivers car was Rockdawg who exited the vehicle and told me “I’m saving you”.  Went on the find out after watching the local weather forecast(and not able to contact me), he made the executive decision to spend tonight in a motel.  That was due to the expectation of 3-5 inches of heavy rain expected from hurricane Ida.  That was very welcome news to me.  And I told him I wholeheartedly agreed.


So, unplanned NERO for me.  Clean clothes, good food, nice bed, etc.

A beautiful day in SW Massachusetts for hiking.  Our shuttle driver was right on time at 9am.  We were on trail by 9:20 under sunny deep blue skies with white fluffy clouds.  The trail was wet in places from the Ida related rains from yesterday and overnight.  Overall we managed to avoid the frequent puddles and streams on the uphill and downhill sections of paths.


We had two climbs today of about 600 feet each.  Not too bad; but, we were a little slow as it was Rockdawg’s first day out.  Made to the shelter about 2:30 and settled in early.  


There is another group of college freshman here on orientation, this time from Williams College.  Hopefully they’re not party animals, they seem not to be.


Saw about 6-8 people on the trail today.  One was an older couple from upstate South Carolina.  They are doing the AT one state at a time.  They did not have backpacks since they have 2 vehicles and hopscotch from one to another each day.

Another beautiful day in SW Massachusetts for hiking. Sunny with a high temp in the upper 60’s and occasional cooling breezes.  Had a couple of smaller climbs (500-600 foot range) and still experiencing occasional muddy/puddled conditions from Ida remnants.  We had numerous stretches of wooden planks over marshy areas.  Sure appreciate the work done by AT Trail maintainers.


Rockdawg and I hiked from 7:30 until 4:15.  Not really any scenic opportunities today.  Just nice trails in the woods without getting to the edges of mountains with vistas.


We had lunch at one of the two shelters we passed today.  We’re joined by Russ from Long Island, NY who we met last night.  


During the day we ran into a group of college freshman on orientation from Williams College.  It was the 2nd group from there we encountered.  And then this evening another group from Williams arrived to spend the night here. From talking with them found out there are about 40 groups of them spread out in various locals in several states this week.


Last night after I wrote my journal, we had an unexpected visitor.  I was sitting at the picnic table in front of the shelter when Rockdawg said look to your left.  There was a small porcupine sitting about 10 feet from me.  We just looked at each other, then he turned and left into to woods.  I only got a picture of his rear end.

Another nice day in MA.  Woke up this morning to Rockdawg saying he didn’t feel well.  Shortness of breath and irregular heartbeats.  I have him aspirin that I carry.  We changed plans and called a shuttle driver to meet us at the next road crossing.  Then hiked the 2 miles(slowly) to the road crossing.  By afternoon we had got to his truck, had lunch and made it to an emergency medical facility in North Adams, MA.  We were there about 2 hours while they diagnosed A-fib caused by dehydration.  After IV fluids and tests his heart rhythm was normal and released.
We found a motel room in Pittsfield,MA and intend to start hiking south tomorrow  back to where we got off in the morning.
As a general note, have to say I’m feeling really good on this hike.  Glad I put so much effort into training in Aiken.  The rocky areas are killers; but, other than those I feel like I could hike all day long without too much effort.  Just need to somehow avoid rocky areas.  Don’t think anyone has found an answer to that dilemma yet.
