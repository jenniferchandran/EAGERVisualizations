Subman & Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631948,last night Subman and I night hiked 2 miles on the Amadahy trail out to the primitive campsites on Carters Lake. We were eager to make sure we had all our gear in working order and it was supposed to be in the 20s overnight. It was so nice to have my backpack on my back for the first time since my knee surgery in Sept. I was able to hike well with my pack weight of 17lbs. It was a little hard to kneel but managed with my Poles. We enjoyed a beautiful sunrise on the Lakeshore and loved the peacefulness of the morning. It was wonderful to be out with Subman and sharing the natural beauty around us doing something we both love.,,View Entry,"Dec 03, Thu",0
Subman & Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631960,"After work this morning I drove to Dyer Gap and extracted Subman Who finished the Pinhoti Trail today. Since the Pinhoti ends in the middle of the woods, He hiked another 2 miles on the Benton MacKaye trail  to meet me at Dyer Gap. Subman planned to thru hike the Pinhoti trail, then the 72 miles of the Benton Mackaye that connects to Springer Mountain which is where we will Start our thru hike on Jan 1st. The Pinhoti Trail is 348  miles long with its' southern terminus starting at Flagg Mountain in Alabama. Some people entertain the idea that someday The Southern Terminus of the Appalachain Trail will be moved to Flagg mountain and recognize it as the beginning of the Appalachain Trail. So far that has only been an idea that has yet to come to fruitation. The Pinhoti stretches through the mountains of Talledaga National Park, and crosses over into Georgia near the little community of Cave Springs. Cave Springs is a friendly town with antique shops, a beautiful park centered around the natural spring after which the town is named. The trail continues on through Dalton Ga with almost 30 miles of road walking to bring him near our home at the Dennis Mill trailhead. Near home he enjoyed the comforts of hot meals, showers, clean clothes, and he was a lot pickier about what weather to hike in, skipping a couple of days as zeros while there was a cold rain. After Dennis Mill there is quite a bit of climbing towards the Cohutta wilderness and up  to the Summit of Fort Mountain.  The trail then  flows down into the valley of Mulberry Gap, that has a thriving Mountain Bike community. Pushing on to the end of the trail, It takes you along the banks and many fords of Mountaintown Creek. Subman said the water fording was freezing and there were quite a few blowdowns that seemed to have been there a while. Finishing the trail Brought a smile to his face, and mine also, I'm proud of his accomplishment and determination to hike, and with that comes his good health and happiness.",,View Entry,"Dec 06, Sun",0
Subman & Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632117,"Today I dropped Subman off at Three Forks and he finished the last six miles to Springer Mountain. There was still snow and ice on the trail from Georgias white Christmas. It was especially slippery and icey coming down to the Springer parking lot. Subman ran into a hiker who was testing out a one wheel cart, called a honeybadger. Pretty interesting but I don't think that it would be a good fit for the AT. There are no wheels allowed in the wilderness areas which is what the AT passes through. See the photo gallery for a picture. Now Sub has made all of his connections from the start of the Pinhoti to Springer Mountain to start our thru hike. The plan is for Subman to hike the approach trail and I will meet him at Springer. I just had knee surgery this past Sept. So I will not tempt fate on the stairs. Jan 1st is fast approaching, I have one more day to work then I'm retiring. We are waiting for Two Peas to show up and we can get the final wrinkles ironed out for our start. Im getting excited for our adventure to begin.",,View Entry,"Dec 27, Sun",0
Subman & Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632128,"this morning Two Peas arrived. Moonbeam and Big Cyprus are tramily from 2016. Big Cypress completed his thru hike and Moonbeam made it just North of Cogdon Shelter where she broke her femur, and had to be Helicoptered out. While visiting Moonbeam asked if I was interested in a Girls thru hike of the AT. I about fell off my chair with excitement, I was all in since surgery on my knee and nueromas I had gained back the 55 lbs I had lost in 2016. In fact in Feb 2020 Sub and I started a Thru and made it to Sam's Gap mile 320 before Covid hit and we left the trail. I am excited to get the chance to try again, and to do it in the company of friends is even better!What is a girls hike you may ask. We will get up at a decent hour like 7am, unlike the 4-5am wakeup calls in 2016. Fewer miles, around 10miles to start. Subman and I averaged 13-16 miles in 2016, Two Peas 20 mile days avg. Hiking at a slower pace, Moonbeam and I both hustled to keep up with the wider stride of the men folk. Sub would hike ahead and wait but when I caught up to him he was ready to take off so there wasn't much of a break for me. As patient as the guys were in 2016 this hike will be the times that try mens souls. Both our husband's are glad to just be out hiking and promise to let us stop and smell the roses. I am excited about spending time with Subman and our friends and getting into shape and good health. 2 more days to go!",,View Entry,"Dec 29, Tue",0
Subman & Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632141,this morning I retired from my job and went home to sleep off my last night shift as a Healthcare worker. Two Peas and Subman placed a car at Neel Gap while I slept. Our resupply bags were overlooked. We had planned to resupply from our car at Neel Gap but oh well. After dinner we all went to Amicalola Lodge to meet AL and his wife Jaymee. Subman had met AL on the AT class of 2021 Facebook page and AL decided to join us on the 1st. They both are super nice and easy going I'm glad they are joining us.. We had a toast and made plans to meet at the Amicalola Visitors center to sign in and take pictures at the Arch. It was so foggy out you couldn't see the road to the lodge.,,View Entry,"Dec 31, Thu",0
Subman & Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632143,"its Raining! We are all excited and in high spirits. Finally off we go. We meet Al and Jaymee at the Visitors Center and signed the NoBo registration book Subman and I are number 9 & 10. After pictures the guys along with Fern, Bigs service dog, began the Approach trail (8.8 miles)in the rain. Moonbeam, Jaymee, and I went to the lodge to update our journals and pass the 5 hours it will take for the guys to hike the approach trail. Moonbeam and I will join them at Springer summit. Jaymee will spend the night at the Lodge and return home to NC in morning. We are off.  what a great start to the New Year.
11.6 miles for the guys

A great start to 2021

Edit: Moonbeam and I climbed the .9 to the Springer summit. I'd was a river. The trail was cascades of fresh springs and water everywhere. almost to the Top Big Cypress was coming down he was freezing from the cold rain all day and had to hike to keep warm. Shortly after AL followed soaked and freezing from their rainy approach trail hike. When Moonbeam and I got to the Springer Summit Subman was there walking in circles trying to stay warm we took summit pictures and scurried as fast as we could the 2.8 miles to Stover Creek Shelter","Springer Mountain
",Stover Creek Shelter,"Jan 01, Fri",2.80
Subman & Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632155,"today we packed up and headed out separately. Al is getting used to his routine and where everything is. We hiked 1.5 miles to three forks,  one of my favorite places on the AT. Moonbeam and I walked together and Big Cypress and Subman went ahead for all of us to meet at Long Creek Falls. It was nice to slow the pace and enjoy the sunrise. All of us but Al were at the falls, after a while I walked back to find Al coming up the trail with a Tupperware and a big bag of handwarmers. Someone had left these items at Stover Creek and AL being the nice guy that he is thought one of us had left them. Meanwhile he was unable to use his hiking Poles so he fell at three forks on the slippery wood Bridge. He is fine but it brings to a boil a pet peeve of mine. Trail Angels think they are helping, at Stover Creek shelter there was a plastic bag of food items and several cans of sardines along with the opened cans thrown back in. It just leaves garbage for someone else to pack out or people throw metal in the fire pit. It brings rodents. A responsible hiker has food and gear to keep warm. I gave the Firestarter and huge bag of handwarmers to some day hikers and asked them to donate it to a homeless shelter or pantry. At Hawk Shelter Al took the trail name Tribe. His sense of Loyalty and  his strong  Military background make me glad he is part of our tramily. This is a hard section and Tribe and I walked at a slow pace, Tribe has a bigger pack and is looking forward to a Shakedown at Neel Gap. I am protecting my knee so I was glad to have some one to walk with. We slowly climbed the rollers into Horse gap and took a break at the Bottom of Sassafras Mountain. The sun had gone down just as we got to camp. Subman walked down to join us . We are in for the night and safe and sound. Glad to have that climb behind us.","Stover Creek Shelter

Subman & Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632162,we walked out of camp at 730am . We soon met Kathy and Mike who had camped on the actual summit of Sassafras. It was cold this morning around 35° and it stayed cold all day. We all had an outer layer on to break the chilling wind. Subman and I use Frogg Toggs as our rain/wind gear.  We walked the three miles to justice creek. We were lucky the rocks were not covered from the recent rains. We all rocked hop across and no toes got wet. We climbed the mile and a half to Gooch Shelter where we had a good break and a hot meal. Subman headed out early he was cold and needed to hike the rest of us followed shortly after. Moonbeam and I hiked at an easy pace of 1 mph and Tribe stayed just ahead of us. Subman and Big Cypress hiked ahead to woody gap and put up tents. It is going to be a cold night it is 30° already and a cold wind is blowing. Kathy joined us just before Woody gap so now we have 6.Recon and Zombie are also camping tonight at Woody Gap. We first meet them on day two at Hawk Mountain shelter,"Sassafras Mountain

We had camped to the right after crossing route 60 at Woody Gap. The wind howled all night. We had planned to do a 730am walk out. Tribe wasn't feeling well and MoonBeam's Knees had swollen and hurt coming down the little path to return to the trail. We made the hard decision to get the cars and come home. We waited in the Bathroom at woody gap out of the wind for Donald Ballard of Further Shuttles to arrive. He  gave us a Complimentary shuttle over to Neel Gap to get the outback. We then came back to Woody Gap and got Two Peas and took them to their Jeep at the Springer Parking Lot. Two Peas headed back to our house and Subman And I returned to Woody Gap for Kathy and Tribe. We plan to zero at our home for recovery and return to the trail Wed. Jan 6th.,"Woody Gap

Tribe met up with his wonderful Wife Jaymee and Kathy took the trail name Merry. I have been calling Kathy Mary for 2 days now, because that's how I roll.🙄 I'm old. So to make it easier on this old woman Kathy took the trail name Merry, it suits her. She has such a positive vibe and is so wonderful to be around. We enjoyed a grilled steak tonight and a fire winding down for a good nights rest to return to Woody Gap in the morning to Hike on. Prayers for strong Knees are appreciated.","Home

Subman & Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632192,"Today was absolutely beautiful! It was 36° at 950am when we left Woody Gap. No wind and the sun was shining. Moonbeam, Merry and I started hiking North towards Blood Mountain. Subman and Big Cypress drove to Neel Gap to leave a car and returned to Woody Gap to hike north. They soon caught up to us shortly after We passed Preachers Rock.  We were taking a snack break at a campsite and lolly gaging along. The trail was perfect, it was clear of BlowDowns ( Thank you trail maintainers) it had hard ups then a nice straightaway that you could recover on as we slowly made our way toward Blood Mountain. The views were breathtaking as you looked to either side of the ridge we were on. Towards the end of our day we got  our water for camp and got to the campsites Big Cypress and Subman had set up for us. After quickly setting up my gear Subman had dinner ready. We enjoyed watching the Sunset while sitting by our tent. What a perfect night!","Woody Gap

Subman & Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632199,"it was a bit chilly leaving Slaughter campground. There were maybe 3 good tent sites there. We were packed up at 730 and Merry sent us on our way, she was taking her time and enjoying the morning. It seemed like in no time at all we were at Blood Mountain Shelter. The Shelter was the cleanest I have ever seen it with just a little trash which  we packed out. The wind had picked up above tree line that made the 25° quite a bit colder. We were kinda waiting for Merry until our fingers and toes were freezing so we hiked on. After a short time Subman went back to make sure Merry was ok. (This is why I love him) I continued on and soon had a text he had found Merry. There is a precarious turn coming down Blood Mountain. You need to go left and more often then not hikers go straight and then have to climb back up the steep mountain. This year Someone had placed some helpful cairns there. After Sub was sure Merry could find her way he headed off to meet us at Neel Gap. We went into the outfitter and Just Bill was there. He fixed me up with a water bottle bungee on my pack. After visiting with Just Bill awhile, Subman went to get the Subaru and Two Peas, Subman, and I headed home to avoid the winter storm watch for Friday. On the way home we enjoyed a Mexican Dinner at Mucho Kaliente in Ellijay. Once home we soaked our weary bones in the hot tub. Living close to Springer gives us so many advantages until we get to the Smokies. We are all enjoying ourselves.","Slaughter Campsite

Subman & Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632234,"today was absolutely beautiful! We walked in a winter wonderland.  It was 26° at Neel Gap this morning and clear blue skies!  Lots of climbing today the hardest one was the last climb to Hogpen Gap. Subman stayed close as Moonbeam and I took our time watching out for ice. I took my first fall just out of Mountain crossings right on my bad knee. We stopped for a break at Cowrock. There were a lot of people walking up from tenastee Gap to get the view on Cowrock. It was awesome. When we got to hogpen Gap Big Cypress was there, he had walked south and drove around to meet us. We resupplied from the truck and walked a little further north and set up camp. It is our first time setting up in snow. We snug in our tent for the night.","Neel Gap

Subman & Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632241,"Last night was interesting. Last night we put the reflectix on the floor of the tent. Subman said he could still feel the cold. So I put an emergency blanket on top of his mattress. That seemed to help more. If you are going to do winter hiking I love my neo xtherm, it seems to do much better then the neo xlite Sub is using.we left hogpen gap at 8am. Moonbeam joined us and Big Cyprus took the truck up to Unicoi gap and will hike south to meet us in the middle to camp overnight. As soon as we took off it started spitting snow and was a balmy 27° out. We counted our blessings that it was snow rather than soaking rain. Moonbeam and I are getting faster and our 1mph speed has increased to about 1.5 mph! We pass Low Gap shelter and the flakes are getting larger and its a little colder. I switched my gloves for my ski mittens. Soon the only footprints we see are our own. Around noon we see Big Cypress and Fern at the water source right before our camp spot. Big Cypress was excited because he saw a mama bear and two cubs closer to Unicoi Gap. We all walk the half mile to our camp spot. this time Sub had pushed all the Snow aside before placing our tent. I then spread the emergency blanket on the floor of the tent and then the refectix.  After a while Sub said he still felt cold so we put the reflectix between his bag and mattress, he believes this is working better. After we get settled in  Subman makes us some noodle soup, boy did that taste good! We are snug in our sleeping  bags and counting our blessings that we are warm and dry as the snow turns to sleet and rain.

Subman & Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632249,"We were up and ready to go at 8am. We had just spent 18 hours laying in a duplex so I was cranky, I get a little Clastrophobic. My attitude soon changed as we started our walk. The trail was slushy from the previous nights rain and there was no avoiding it. Soon our shoes were soaked. We wear Salomon trail runners and Darn Tuff socks. Thankfully the wool socks keep our feet realitively warm even though they were wet. The slush was slippery to walk in and I had a death grip on my Poles. Moonbeam and I picked and chose our steps carefully as Subman watched from a short distance ahead. It seemed to take forever going over the two rock scrabble fields before heading to Blue Mountain Shelter. Moonbeam and I spied raccoon tracks in the snow. We kept watching for Bear cubs in the trees since Big Cypress saw them in this area the day before. After the shelter we continued to climb to the top of Blue Mountain which lead to our mile descent into Unicoi Gap. We met two older gentlemen hiking up and enjoyed a happy banter about our hike. Halfway down the mountain all the slush and snow disappeared and our footing was more sure. Subman had gone ahead and Met Big Cypress at the Gap parking lot. We are going home and do laundry and revamp some gear. The house looked like a gear explosion. We had a special Trail Angel show up, Grambo came and brought Shane's Ribs with all the Fixin's what awesome trail magic! It was so nice to see her and introduce her to Big Cypress and Moonbeam. They had first heard of Grambo in 2016 when we were in freezing weather at Standing Indian and I exclaimed to Subman that ""I was calling Grambo and she would pick me up at the next road"" LOL it didn't happen but trail chef was at Rock Gap with a warm car and Hot Chocolate. We are blessed to have made such good friends through the trail. Tonight it was showers, clean gear, Laundry, and a soak in the hot tub.

We started our 1000ft climb to the top of Rocky Mountain right out the door. We were rewarded for our efforts with an amazing view and we paused to take it in. The weather had turned magnificent, no wind and possibly 40° with the bluest skies.Then we descended almost as high as we climbed into Indian Grave Gap. Just past the Gap we ran into a Good friend of ours, Butter. Butter is from AL and took a break from hiking the Pinhoti Trail to hike with us. We always enjoy his company. As the Guys moved ahead we could hear them talking about their hiking adventures. Moonbeam and I put on our traction devices. There was quite a bit of packed snow and Ice on our climb up Tray Mountain. I dont think we would had made it without them! At the top of Tray it was Rocky and covered with Ice. Tray Mountain also had a spectacular view. We all sat at the Summit and took a lunch break. Coming down Tray was downright treacherous on the rocks. We went past the shelter and continued on stopping to take off or put on our traction devices as needed. I was so thankful Moonbeam and I had them. We enjoyed the ridge walk as we went through the Swag of the Blue Ridge and pushed through that Last climb that then descended into Sassafras Gap where we camped for the night. It was nice to be able to stand outside the tent and talk without freezing and have time to set up before dark. This was our Longest day so far, we broke Ten Miles!

Before reaching the gap there is a beautiful tunnel of Laurel that looked like a fairyland with the fog that encased us. Soon we saw blue skies and began walking along rhododendrons and a cascading creek. It was very relaxing and of course coming into a gap made happy thoughts.

After Big Cypress arrived we put chains on the RV and did the older and wiser version of coming down from the Burningtown Gap trailhead safely. Two Peas had gone all the way to Sylva to find chains for our RV and their rig. While waiting for Big Cypress to rescue us a few hikers came through th gap. Most recognizable was Chica and Sunset getting a hike in before their Franklin Hostel opens in February. It was great to meet them and talk trail.

Big Cypress went on to complete his thru. Supported by Moonbeam. Finally this year Moonbeam asked if I was interested in thru hiking so she could summit Katahdin. I was beyond excited and our husbands are being very supportive and patient. After visiting with Al and Susie, Subman and I headed to Gooder Grove Hostel to do Laundry and shower. Zen, the owner of Gooder Grove showed us how far his hostel has come since he opened in 2015. Two Peas had stayed there in 2016.

Soon the dogs humans came up behind them and they were all dressed in hunter brown and orange. It was a older gentleman with 3 late teen sons on an outing. They were using the AT to connect to another road to go hunting. Seeing the Hunters always brings back happy memories of hunting with my Dad and all the delicious game we ate growing up.

I was impressed she looked like she never broke a sweat and there was some big climbs. There was another big Climb after Snowbird Mtn. We meet a couple from Chattanooga who were section hiking the AT. Poppa and Fizz with their dog, Blaze we hiking from Lemon Gap and her father was picking them up and shuttling them to trail heads. We continued on and had 2 miles to go when we spied a log and sun shining directly on it. We had a phone signal, which has been sparse lately so we took about a half an hour and rested and caught up on our phones. We finished the last 2 miles and got to the RVs at 3pm. We had plenty of time to eat and rest for tomorrow. The plan is for Big Cypress and Fern to take the Jeep to Garenflo Gap and hike South, as Subman, Moonbeam, and I Hike  to Garenflo Gap from.

We only had 6.4 miles so we hit the trail after a great breakfast at the Smokey Mountain Diner. Just as we hit the trail, Butter is hiking up! What timing. Subman and Butter hiked ahead and Moonbeam and I brought up the rear. Moonbeam and I came upon Sub and Butter resting just before Deer Park Mountain Shelter. It was a beautiful day and the Sun warmed us as we talked and had a snack. I enjoyed my fried bologna biscuit from the diner this morning. We soon were on our way and we walked to the trailhead leisurely enjoying the day. Today I used my day pack to rest my knee. The light pack helped immensely and I ice my knee after every day of hiking when possible. So far so good.
We ate dinner at the Smokey Mountain diner and now are back at the trailhead. I am heading to bed and Sub will visit with the hikers that have arrived at Laughing Heart.

Subman soon took off as us ladies lolligaged. Using the time to use Laughing Heart wifi to download our journals and pictures. At 1030am Moonbeam and I began to walk from the trailhead through Town, as we hiked down the sidewalk a train rolled through town. We crossed the tracks and walk the bridge over the French Broad River. Turning right we follow the North Bank of the river and begin the climb up Lovers Leap. After 2 hours we are finally up on the ridge and enjoying the easy walk to a dammed pond. The pond had inviting benches where Moonbeam and I sat and rested. Watching the ripples created by the fish in the pond.. After a snack we move on passing a bunch of daffodils trying to bloom. The area reminds me of an old homestead, making me wonder who dammed up the pond? Was it a farmer creating a drinking hole for his livestock? We follow an old dirt road that soon sends us up into the woods until we come out near an overpass bridge that has since been closed. As Moonbeam and I cross over the highway we entice a Semi driver to blow his horn. We giggle like kids and finish the hike with huge smiles. Subman is waiting on the other side of the bridge to head back to the Hot Springs Trailhead for one more night. Someone had left a pirate rubber ducky on the Jeep. I quess its a jeep thing. it had the hashtag #duckduckjeep on it. What fun!

We climbed over 1500ft, crossing cascading waterfalls several times all the way to the top. It was beautiful. We finally climb to altitude and walk great trail on a ridgeline that opens into meadows with wisps of clouds moving through. You could see the mountain ridges rising above the clouds on the horizon.  We go down to Rice Gap and climb our way up to Hogback Ridge shelter. Continuing Rollers until we wind down To Sam's Gap. While going down to Sam's Gap we encounter two ladies walking their dogs. One had a cute little cockapoo type dog and the other had the ugliest dog ever,  a chihuahua with thin white hair on a pink rat like body.

The Smokey air activated my asthma making it even harder to climb. We were rewarded for our work with amazing views from on top the bald. While taking pictures on top, Moonbeam and I see a young man with a wide open stride. I jokingly encouraged him to step it out and go faster, he began to sprint uphill as an answer to my jostling. The young Man was Ninja Feet the oldest child of the Trout Family. This is a family of seven, 5 children,the youngest being seven, and the oldest 17yrs old.

Happy Anniversary! Subman and I are celebrating our 4th wedding Anniversary today. I am so thankful for my forever friend. I love that whenever I hike with him, he is ahead of me and leaves hearts in the dirt.Today was very rainy and Moonbeam and I felt a little off. But no rain no Maine, so we left Iron Mountain Gap with our rain gear on. It was socked in but good trail with just 4 significant ups. At 3 or 4 miles we see Big Cypress and Fern hiking South to the RVs. It was a short visit since the sleepy rain was cold when you stopped. We saw no one and the next landmark was 6 miles in we see the turn off to Clyde Smith Shelter, it is a little off trail and neither Moonbeam or I needed water, so we pressed on. Both of us were being extremely careful in the Mud that was on the trail. There were no falls today! Our last climb to Little Rock Knob was beautiful. The trail took you up so nicely, with rock steps well placed, and very nice trail between the rocks. When I got back to the RV, Subman told me, that Bob Peoples said, that an all Ladies maintenance crew build that trail. Since most ladies have smaller strides, they built the steps to accommodate their strides. It really turned out great and since my knee was bothering me, I appreciated the nice trail. Even our downhill into Hughes Gap was gentle and beautiful. We were glad to get to the Jeep Big Cypress had left for us and Subman was already there with the heat going. We returned to the RVs at Iron Mountain Gap and pulled out shortly thereafter for Carvers Gap. There is snow on the ground here and it's supposed be in the 20s tonight. Very thankful for dry clothes and a warm bed tonight. Tomorrow we go over Roan Mountain, I hope it is as beautiful as it was on our  2016 thru hike.","Iron Mountain Gap

You can see where the old trail went straight up the mountain. In 2003 Subman said that is how he got to the summit, straight up on your tiptoes. Knowing this made me grateful that there were nice switchbacks for us today. The trail was beautiful and after 2 miles we began to see the alpine trees and Rocky boulders. Towards the top there was plenty of ice, but we were able to pick our steps around it. There were many day hikers today, all smiling and happy to be out in the fresh air. We also saw Caruso  who was Thru Hiking. We had met him on a shakedown hike in GA at Sassafras Mountain. Caruso also said Night Train, who he had been hiking with since he started, had gotten off the trail and went home. That definately will impact Caruso's mental game. We talked a bit and then went on up the trail. There was snow on the pine trees and most had turned to ice at the top. We saw a Fireplace alone in the middle of the woods. Your imagination goes wild thinking of who could of lived here. We pass the entrance to the shelter, opting not to to the shelter because you had to hike up to it.  As we start the descent of the mountainWe put on our yak tracks to try and avoid the ice, they worked well and we could go a little faster. We saw several day hikers and a couple who stopped to talk about our hike. We were done shortly after noon. Resting up in the RVs for the 14.8 mile hike from Carvers Gap to 19E.

We start going down on the back side of Jane bald there is lots of ice mixed in with the frozen mud. We passed Stan Murray shelter. There is one hiker packing up while listening to music. We press on and soon come to Yellow Mountain Gap. This is the Blue Blaze that leads to OverMountain Shelter. The old Barn was decommissioned in 2019. Over Mountain shelter was one of my favorite memories of our 2016 hike. At the turnoff point to the Shelter their was an older man waiting for us to go by before joining us to go North. There was also 2 other hikers back some. We all begin our ascent to Little Hump. We look back and can see the big Red Barn in the valley. Big Cypress with Fern soon arrive hiking South. Big Cypress told us to wear everything you have because it was windy and cold. I had just put on my poncho which helped break the wind some more, there was a heavy mist in the air. I wasn't sure if it was raining or we were just standing in a cloud. When we came to little Hump there was a small stand of trees with ice covering them, we pass through and immediately the wind is gale force. There is tall brown grass with the occasional tree that had withstood these harsh conditions. At the top of the Bald is a Rock cluster.  Subman stops to talk to a handsome young Man and Introduces him to Moonbeam and I as, Tall Son. We say hello and move to the descent of Little Hump. After reaching Bradley Gap we stop for a snack and get ready to climb Big Hump, boy does it look intimidating. We slosh through the muddy path with me falling twice. We continue on criss crossing the mud that is the trail to walk on the grassy sides. We climb 600 ft and the wind rips at us, blowing so hard at times it steals your breath. At the top we run into Not Yet, a Canadian who also got caught last year in the pandemic conundrum. By this time the clouds had lifted and we could take in an amazing 360° view of the farms, towns, and mountain ridges,, it was gorgeous We! We continue on the long descent of Big Bald until we come to a small forested area with short scrubby trees. The trail is muddy and Rocky with rock fields to maneuver through. The trees get taller and we can see farms in the valley. We walk into Doll Flats where we leave North Carolina for the Last time.

In doing so, we overlooked the switchback to take us further along the trail. We ended up bushwacking along slippery rocks to get back on the trail. We came to a rock ledge that led us around an outcropping of rocks. We continue on the valley floor, you could hear the birds chirping echoing up the river. Soon we began our 1600ft ascent over 3.5 miles! I remember Subman saying your not on the top until you hit the water source. There were many false summits. On our way to the top we meet a group of 6 20somethings doing a section hike. They were donning their rain Gear. Moonbeam and I had put on our Ponchos since it had started to rain.

It is a Forest Service road so we had our fingers crossed  that no washout or blowdowns from the Storms would block our way. We arrived safely at 730 we hit the trail. Today we hike into Damascus! After climbing out of McQueen Gap we pass Abingdon Gap Shelter. We see Plantly and Mr. Myoghi in the shelter beginning to pack up. They had weathered yesterday's storms by zeroing at the shelter after making it the day before in the thunderstorms. We also saw a section hiker Gino who was ending his section in Damascus. There was a young couple his name wasWizard and Her name was Killer, they were from Maryland. We talked for a while then headed North for the 6.5 miles to the VA/TN state line. I was very excited about leaving the land of no privies. TN offers you a shovel and a toilet area for personal business, you are on your own. Another reason RVs are nice. We arrive at the state line and take pictures and make a Face book post announcing our arrival in VA. Soon 2 brothers in their 40s arrive and are sectioning the trail. Then Wizard and Killer, walk up, they are thruhiking, also thruhiking Plantly and Mr Myoghi join us then a couple of day hikers also arrive. Before we knew it there was a party at the state line! Moonbeam and I talked with Killer which lifted all our spirits. Before leaving we took many pictures of hikers standing by the sign and Killer gifted Moonbeam and I with 2021 AT tags for our Backpacks! What a thoughtful gift. We have 3.5miles to reach Damascus  from the state line. We listen to Ramdino give his hiker updates on the way in. Today was a good morale lift for all of us.

Big Cypress and Fern took the Jeep to Luther Hassinger Memorial Bridge and hiked South to the RVs which we parked behind the the Bike Station. The Owner of the Shop, Steve, was very kind and generous and we were able to park for 3 nights while hiking around Damascus. Moonbeam and I walk out of town and Subman was a ways ahead of us.  We climbed 1000ft in 3.5 miles and finally reached the top of Iron Mountain. We descend down towards VA 58 and meet Big Cypress and Fern. Big informs us there is a Ford ahead. Neither Moonbeam or myself had our camp shoes. Moonbeam crossed barefoot and I took off my socks and crossed in my trailrunners.  We met a man named Sir James, who was being supported by a friend. We walked across the bridge at Route 58 and there was a cooler of ice cold cherry cokes! Awesome trail magic since it was getting warm outside and we had a hugemoungus climb up to Saunders Shelter. It took us 2 miles to climb the thousand feet to the top. The switchbacks were very long and much appreciated. Sir James came by again as we stopped for a snack. We leaped frogged each other for the next two climbs.after that we cruised down to the creeper trail that connects to the AT and come to the Luther Hassinger Memorial Bridge. We bushwacked down to the creeper trail parking area  where Big Cypress had left the Jeep. The mountains had water overflowing everywhere from the recent storms.

Subman and I started up to Lost Mountain shelter in the rain. When we got to the shelter there was a nice young man set up in the shelter. We talked about the weather and how cold it was supposed to get. He had no idea and thanked us for the info as he was packing up to head into town. Soon we crossed HWY 58 and started across a pasture. We came upon Two Peas who only had 4 miles to go in their hike. We talked and snacked. Subman and I started our 3 mile climb up to Buzzard Rock. There had been a prescribed burn on the Bald, that only added to the spooky atmosphere of the fog and rain. The wind was colder and more fierce as we crossed over the Bald and went into the dwarfed forest. There were rock fields and scrambles and the mountains were bursting at the seams from all the recent rains. The full springs had turned the trail into a river and our feet were soaked. We heard owls hooting back and forth and saw maple syrup lines running from tree to tree before coming into the Elk Garden Trailhead.

We both had Bronchial pneumonia. We returned a week later and finished. This year sounds familiar. It can be done. Subman and I love hiking together. I have lost 20 pounds and have 35 more to go. I still have some work to do. We will miss Two Peas though. We have made some great memories together. Tomorrow Subman and I will leave in the morning for Atkins to meet our friend Outlaw and her dog Rebel. After an overdue visit Outlaw will take us back to the Elk Garden Trailhead to resume our hike. This is going to be a more traditional hike rather then the RV supported hike. We love the camping aspect of backpacking and missed it. This has been a crazy hike with a lot of stops and starts. It is almost like a tearing away from the social constraints and it keeps grabbing and pulling you back. Being able to handle each setback and keep moving North will get us there.

Subman & Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634474,"Our friend Outlaw took us to the Elk Garden Trailhead, we were on trail by noon and off to see the ponies. Our packs were heavy with 4 days food as we climb up the thousand ft to Thomas knob Shelter. The open grasslands soon turn into beautiful pines and the trail turns Rocky. We meet a young couple, Fish Pants and Olivia. Olivia didn't have a trail name, so I suggested Next Step from the Movie SouthBounders. The young Lady in the Movie was named Olivia and had taken that trail name. She liked it and thought she would consider it. When we reached the shelter there were 2 Lashers (Long A** Section hikers) both older Like us, one named Klang-On, who was finishing his 2020 hike and the other named Gentleman. Both men were from Ohio which is where I grew up. We chatted a bit. It felt good to start meeting more hikers, that is half of the AT experience. Many people with small children were out with their Families. One little guy in a backpack probably 4- yrs old. Told me all about the ponies he saw. When he told me, I replied I had not seen any. He told me "" oh you will see them!"". I smiled and told him that him saying that made me happy. Sure enough further North we began to see the ponies. They were scattered in the Highlands with just 2 close to the trail. After we hit Wilbur ridge there were more grazing while people watched from rocks and benches taking in the warm sun, it was almost 70° today! We continued on toward Massie Gap and found our way through the Fat man Squeeze. I actually fit, the AT must be doing its magic. It is very encouraging to have lost that 20lbs. Outlaw had parked at Massie Gap and walked into Wise Shelter with her dog Rebel. We met Her there and since their is no camping in the Grayson Highlands, we crossed the Big Wilson Creek to National Forest lands to camp.Sub was tired tonight. Getting up at 4am to drive to Atkins took its toll. We made dinner and visited with Outlaw. It was very nice of her to pick us up in Atkins and bring us back to Elk Garden trailhead.  She will head back to Massie Gap in the morning.

Climbing up to stone mountain the top turns into a Bald. You can tell it gets windy because the trees were all growing to the East. Soon I run into a few ponies eating grass. That is the last we saw of the ponies before leaving Grayson Highlands. We continue to the scales and there are a couple of camps set up. We talked to  a family of five and I unsuccessfully tried to yogi some of the pancakes they were making by exclaiming "" Whats for Breakfast?"" I need to work on my Yogi skills. We said goodbye to the family and continued to climb up Pine mountain. We crossed a fence stile and met a flip flopper named Second Step, he had started at Harpers Ferry in March.  The rocks began to diminish as we came down to Old Orchard Shelter. We stopped to get water and have  lunch. We continue down to Fox Creek, before climbing up to Hurricane shelter, we passed by the shelter after getting Water.  At the water source, we met Trash Man. Trash Man got his name because he picks up Trash on the trail. He and Subman talked a little Navy since both had served on Submarines.  We moved on and come to a alternate route to cross Comers Creek. We took the original route since Trash Man told us it was crossable with the stepping stones There is also a nice waterfall. We had filled all our water bottles so we were hiking in heavy to Dickey Gap. We found a nice spot just before the Gap and set up for the night.","Big Wilson Creek

At the top of the climb we checked for a phone signal and I was able to upload my journal entries. After 5 miles we went into Trimpi Shelter. The grounds around the shelter were beautiful, there were daffodils and Fosythia blooming, the piped spring was flowing and perfectly positioned. Subman and I had a snack and continued on we crossed a hilly pasture and a gravel road. Right before VA 670 we ran into Moody 9 and his Son on their way to the Grayson Highlands. It was a delight to talk to them and Moody9 had thru hiked in 2015 if I remember right. He also mentioned he had read our journals. We continue on and right at the road crossing and South Fork Holsten River, there is an old house foundation with flowering Daffodils everywhere. We cross the river on a bridge and begin the climb up to the ridge that will take us into Partnership Shelter. At the top of the ridge the path is Rocky, we meet an older hiker named Nimble who was taking his time and picking his steps. From Then on  trail is beautiful and easy to hike, on my way I met a couple who were on a Lash to Springer, and a young man named Blue Ray. This young man was a ray of sunshine, very positive, and Energetic. He was flip flopping from Harpers Ferry. I finally walk into the shelter, Subman is already there, we are the only ones here. I got our water from the spigot at the Visitors Center. Sub cooked us a dinner. Another couple arrived, her name was Yipp and his was Lorax. I had carried a bottle holder from Old Orchard Shelter that had a note saying it belong to Lorax. Yipp couldn't believe that it was found and returned to her. She had lost it 25 miles back on the trail. We ordered from the pizza place that left a menu in the shelter. I had a gyro and chicken tenders, and Sub ordered a cheeseburger with fries. Our tummies were full and Lorax and Yipp were hiking on. Nimble came in and made arrangements to go into Town.. We settled into our tent just as it started to rain.

We packed up our wet tent and headed out. We saw Fish Pants who came into the Shelter last night. He told us another couple came in Late around midnight. I heard them talking and walking around with full headlights on but didn't see them because they went into the top of the shelter. There is also a lot of road noise even though we camp south of the Shelter. We had a long climb out of partnership shelter. It was a beautiful day. The trail turned into rocks and rock scrambles. We finally made it to the top of Glade Mountain and made our descent down to chatterfield Shelter. Right before the Shelter there was a beautiful new stone staircase put in. Thank you trail maintainers! I'm sure it was a ton of work.  We past the shelter and continue down, the rocks begin to dissipate and a few streams pop up along with the tunnels of Rhododendrons that love the water. We pop out onto meadows that lead to the Lindamood Schoolhouse and Settlers Museum. There was no trail magic in the schoolhouse. It looks like they have been experiencing some vandalism. There was a sign tied around the old stove saying please do not make a fire in it. All the desks were rolled back up against the walls. The rules picture was gone and someone had used chalk to write on the smokestack of the stove. There was also writing about pooping in the woods on the chalkboard. It really made me sad, it had always been one of my favorite stops and people from my community were disrespecting it. Subman and I cross the road and walk through intermitten pastures and little wooded areas. The wildflowers were blooming and I loved seeing them. We are almost to Atkins when we start to cross train tracks and we hear a train whistle. We stand on the bridge and enjoy watching the train go by. We descend into Atkins and see our car parked at the Suncoast Station we go inside the station and get some items for resupply and eat hot dogs. We drive our car to Lickskillet hostel, 60 miles north on the Trail. After arriving at the hostel, we met the owner, Mango and took showers, changed clothes and resupplied our food bags. Mongo took us back to Atkin to get back on the trail. While leaving we hear someone yelling and waving from the Exon. Plantly and Mr. Miyagi were there with their son and 2 grandchildren, who had joined them for a section through the Grayson Highlands. They were staying in Atkins at the alpaca farm. Sub and I walked 2 miles in and filled our water bottles we pressed on for one more mile uphill to the Path Davis campsite. It has a privy and a picnic table. There is noone else here so we eat the burgers we packed from town and settle in our tent. The coyotes are very active tonight.","Partnership Shelter

Subman & Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634633,"Today was hard neither Sub nor I slept real well. We had a lot of climbing today.  The first being a 500ft Little Bushy Mtn. Then down to only go up 1000ft. To Walker Mtn. This was a long 2 mile up. I spied a little Fairy camped in the nook of a tree,it made me smile. I caught Sub at the top of Walker Mtn, he had just spied two deer. On the way down the Mtn a I had flushed out a turkey who flew over my head, flying for dear life to keep his large body airborne. After we cross a few fence stiles we walk along a boggy area to a bridge that crosses the Holsten River. There is a huge old Barn across the bank that is slowly decaying. We climb up from the riverbank and cross another fence stile and walk a little ways in a wooded area there were ramps growing everywhere I picked a few leaves to put in my soup at lunch. After crossing a rolling pasture we arrive at the O'Lystery Pavillion, here we got water and sat down for a hot lunch, we had two more climbs yet before getting to Lick Creek. There was a warning in AWOL and Guthook about the bridge being out over the Creek since 2020 and that you had to Ford it. The warning also said that after  rains it could become waist high and  dangerous to Ford. And if that should that be the case, turn around or wait for conditions to change. As luck would have it, we were expecting afternoon showers and later thunderstorms. It had already showered off and on since lunch. Lick Creek was at our 15th mile for the day. Subman had gone ahead to setup drops for aqua mira, we were going to get our water and setup camp after crossing the river. Subman was on the other side of the river when I arrived. I took off my socks and shoes and put on my crocs that I carry for camp shoes. After 15 miles and walking on blisters, I was tired and ready for camp. After preparing to cross, I took one step and my feet flew out from under me. I slide 6 feet down the slippery, muddy river bank. I was so mad I cried. I got up with my heavy pack, covered with mud. Forded the,  mid calf high, stream and made it to Subman. He had a wet pack towel and tried to help get the mud off my pack and me. I was so mad, I took my shorts off and rinsed them in the river and put them back on wet. God bless Subman for having so much patience while I was being grouchy. Subman went ahead of me looking for a good Tenting spot that would keep us dry since we knew more rain was coming. I was tired, wet, and hurting and pressed on at least another mile before we left the valley and found a spot nestled in some Rhododendrons without any widow makers (dead trees) around. We got our tent set up and unpacked while in the tent. Soon the heavy rains came but there was no thunder and lightening. I was glad to be in our tent eating a hot meal and decompressing from the day. This was a hard day for me, physically and mentally. It gave a whole new meaning to the saying,, ""the Lord willing and the Creek don't rise"". I'm sure it will be better tomorrow after some rest and the sun comes out.","Davis Path Campsite

I said a little Thank You Jesus that it wasn't near us. We packed up and headed out. We had a 4.5 mile hike up 2000ft to Chestnut Knob Shelter. It was a beautiful area of pastures and intermittent woods and halfway up. We stopped by a pond with a spring and got water for lunch. When we made it to the Shelter Subman made a hot lunch for us and we put out a few things to dry. We gathered our things and headed down to Walker Gap. We got water and climbed up to a ridge. The whole ridge was rocks, scrambles, and fallen trees. I had 8 blisters on my feet and they were not happy.  We finally came to the long downhill to Jenkins Shelter.

From the shelter we climbed up 500ft to another 2 mile ridge walk. I was holding my breath, hoping it wasn't all rocks and blow downs. I was pleasantly surprised that it seemed to be old roadbed and nice trail. Lord, I needed this today. Coming down from the ridge, you cross a beautiful footbridge and VA 615. I was enjoying the cascading waters of Laurel creek when 2 Ladies were coming to the trail with signs. The signs said one word ""Food"". That brought a tremendous smile to my face, our first Trail Magic. We visited with Valerie and Amy from ATOM (Appalachian Trail Outreach Ministry) while having a hot Breakfast, Mongo from Lickskillet Hostel shows up( this is where our car is parked), we visit then take off to try and make the 8 miles to the Brushy Mountain Outpost for Burgers, it closes at 2pm. We climb back up on a ridge and again the trail is Kind. I give Subman my burger order and tell him to go ahead. It will be close to closing time by the time I can get there. As I'm walking, Beat, from Jenkins Shelter, passes me with only a beer in his pocket, he was hurrying to make it to the Outpost. Then Reset, another who was thru hiking, passed with no pack. Waterboy was next, he had his pack but was scurrying for that burger. I made it before closing time and Sub had a huge fried Bologna sandwich waiting on me, my favorite! There were other hikers at the outpost, Double Decker, Morning Dove, Bumble Bee, and Yipp were the Ladies and Landfill, Beat, Lormax, Waterboy, Reset, and Mike were the guys, along with Sub and I. It was great to finally be among other hikers. We were all enjoying our lunches and Mongo walks in, he had the packs of those who were slack packing, about six  backpacks. The hikers wanted to do eight more miles slacking, and some of the others joined in. Sub and I were going to the hostel to soak my feet in Epsom salts. So we leave the outpost with a truckload of packs and go to the hostel with full bellies. Lickskillet Hostel has everything,  it was a church built in 1911 and Mongo just put up a new bathhouse. We took showers and did our laundry. Mongo brings in 3 packs, Beat, Morning Dove, and Landfill plan to spend the night also. Subman wants a steak, and Mongo suggested The Log House. Since we have our car, we go and it was amazing! The food was great and there were gardens with bunnies, doves and beautiful flowers blooming.

The downhills hurt a lot but in all. I was doing good. About 7 miles in we crossed the 600 mile mark. It was a good moral boost! Shortly after the 600 mark I was passed by 2 hikers who were Slack packing from the Weary Feet Hostel, Smalls and Cornpop. They were thruhiking together. I reached Jenny Knob Shelter around 2 pm.

There was a hunter coming up the trail. He said he was hunting turkey, I wished him good luck and continue down. We cross pastures with small stands of trees and wildflowers. It looks like Spring and very beautiful. At the bottom of our descent there is a suspension bridge over Kimberling Creek, the bridge swings as you walk across it. The swinging was a little unnerving to me. There were chairs and cars parked in the trailhead. We thought that there may be trail magic, but it was a family going on an outing. We follow the trail to VA 606. This is the road Trent's Grocery is on. We walked the 0.5 miles to the store and enjoy a burger, onion rings and soda. I also packed out a grilled cheese sandwich. We walk the 0.5 miles back to the trailhead and climb up to Dismal Falls Blue Blaze trail. We met a nice couple. His name was Roam (retiree on a mission). She was trail supporting him as he section hiked the trail. We continue down the trail, through Rhododendrons and creek crossings. In some places the trail was a mud pit that you scrambled  to get across any way you could. We run into another hiker named Waddles, he was attempting a thru hike. He was from Michigan. A local guy named James also stopped to talk, as the four of us are talking another local came up with her dog. She stays long enough to say hi and continues down the trail. We say goodbye and move North. Waddles soon passes us and Subman and I are alone to hike north. We cross a creek and take a rest.

This seems to be the norm. Hardly anyone stops to talk. The  people are one of the best things about the trail and this scenario has happened more days than not, and it is not just the young people. It seems like the trail has no personality this year. Perhaps because we have seen such few people. The trail is nice until the rocks began near Sugar Run Gap. The ice storm had ravaged the trees and there was lots of debris and rocks which made the trail difficult. We continued on to Doc Knob Shelter and we rest here for lunch.

Her RV would not start.  We Spent Monday getting things arranged to have her RV towed to Roanoke, VA. After the tow truck came we took Grambo back to Stanimals in Waynesboro. From Waynesboro she will get back on trail to do more miles for her Section hike of the AT. Subman and I decided to go home from there, with hopes that the Peter Mountain closure would be open and we could celebrate My Son's graduation from Law School. We got home after midnight on Monday and rested from the drive. Tuesday was Submans birthday so we celebrated and unpacked the car. Today we are getting oil changes and new tires on the cars, and bought our resupply. We are organizing our return to the trail April 25th. Hopefully Peter's Mtn will be open and we can hike through. This is the last planned trip back home before finishing our hike. I have lost 25lbs so 30 lbs more to go!","Home

Subman & Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635599,It was fun to see my Sons and Celebrate Keith's graduation from Belmont University Law School. Subman and I left from our last outing Sat. Eve and drove North back to Narrows at VA 100 to get back on trail. We were off a total of 6 days so it was a bit of a struggle to get our groove back. We decided to do short miles and get adjusted to trail life again. We met 4 hikers coming out of Pearisburg at the trailhead they were off after saying hi. Some kind soul had left trail magic of 2 bags of IV Electrolytes powder It was very generous! Thank You. Sub and I grabbed one and followed the group heading North. We walked a bridge over the river and RR tracks then followed steps to walk under the highway. Finally we start climbing up a wooded slope. To our left is the Landfill. Today the wind was strong and the aroma wafted through the air from the dump site. We climbed for 7 miles the last 3 miles was part of the Peter Mountain closure that was now open. The trail looked. Great and the many trees that had fallen were cleared. We arrive at a Bald and Subman starts looking for a tent  spot. We finally get setup up and there are about 10 young hikers standing around the campfire at the shelter It so nice to see smiling faces and other Hikers now.

Subman & Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635732,"This mornings sunrise was surreal. We were on top of the world.  watching the clouds fall into the valleys below as they moved like waves in an ocean. We walked off the Bald of Peter Mountain and soon crossed the powerlines that had been the reason for the 2 month closure of this15 miles of trail, that opened only recently, on April 22nd. There was evidence of the construction of the massive tower and a wide graded area below it. We walked through this area that had been sown with hydro seed and was muddy. We were on a ridge after reaching the shelter last night. The first seven miles had been cleared of blowdowns, but the seven miles we started today was not cleared and required us to walk around and through many fallen trees. As we were walking the young group from the shelter started to pass us one by one. First was Seeker a very nice young man, and we enjoyed talking about Colorado with him. Others that passed by, Shady, Gunga Din, andDisco, all stopped to say good morning. They are young and do bigger miles than Subman and Me. After seven miles we begin to go down from the ridge. We see 2 older gentleman coming up. First is T- Man he is from South Carolina and hiking a section with the second gentleman named Airman. Airman took his pack off and sat down, so we stayed a while to chat. Soon a young lady comes up, she is slack packing South back to Angels Rest Hostel. When she came up I asked her what her Trail name was she said Smiles. It was a great name for her because she had a beautiful Smile and a bright energetic spirit. I keep asking her questions because something was oddly familiar about her, I told her our trail names, and we put 2 and 2 together. We had run into Smiles around Troutdale. She didn't have a trail name yet, so Subman called her Smiles. She had taken his trail name he gave her. She had asked Where Moonbeam was. I told her she got off trail April 1st. She said I remember when I asked what advice do you have for the trail and Moonbeam told me ""never quit on a bad day"" it kind of made me melancholy.  Well we still had over 7 more miles so we ended our break. T-Man said we only had one more blow down then the trail was clear. I was sorry I couldn't say the same for him and Airman.As we pressed on we saw another Slackpack from Angels Rest  her name was Unique and she was trying to catch up to Smiles. We came up the 300ft climb over a few easy rock scrambles then down to Stoney Creek Valley. The trail followed a stream most of the way down and it was a nice walk listening to the cascading waters. Before reaching the Gap we stop at the Pine Swamp Branch Shelter. We ate a snack and Subman got us each a bottle of water. It tasted so cool and fresh especially as the day started heating up. There had been a nice cool breeze that disappeared as we went to lower altitude. At the shelter was a young man named Firewalker. We talked about some of his adventures and he said he had zeroed in the shelter today. Just resting up. We said goodbye and continued down until we reached the river banks. We passed the Captains house and reminisced of him being a character at the Trail Days Parade, yup, he was the one who brought a fire extinguisher to the squirt gun fight.🤣 Sadly he has recently passed away and there is no longer a cable and a seat that you could take across the river for a cold coke and a campfire. He also used to allow Tenting in his yard. We continue past the Captains and walked along Rhododendrons  and all of a sudden there is a steep climb.As Subman said Leave it to the AT to chew you up and spit you out at the end of the day. We finally make it to VA 635 where our outback is parked. We took  the outback back to the Narrows and got our Ascent. Yes now we have 2 cars on trail! We have decided we are going to see how many different ways we can hike the trail this year. We drove both cars up the trail to 4 Pines Hostel. After we resupplied our food bags, we left the outback at the Hostel and drove the Ascent back to VA 635. Tonight we are boondocking at the trailhead in the Ascent. Today was great, the trail is coming alive, we are seeing more hikers and they are all friendly and happy. I can't wait for tomorrow.","Rice Field Shelter

Subman & Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635793,"We started with a 1000ft climb first thing this morning. Almost to the Top is Baily Gap shelter. There was noone in the shelter so we passed on by. We made it to the ridge and was greeted by 3 miles of rocks and boulders.  The rocks really slow you down and wear you out. We came to Mountain lake Road and sat at the trailhead to eat a snack and take a break. Continuing on we passed Wind rock and stopped to say hi to Spydy, who was packing up to move North on the trail. We moved on and the trail was very nice. I met a section hiker named Tom from South Carolina. I talked for quite some time and caused Subman to be concerned about for my wherabouts. He was coming back up the trail to find me. After he knew I was OK,  We continued up the trail. We met 2 Ladies Hey Jude and her friend were section hiking. Spydy passed us up and so did the Ladies. We began our descent  down to War Spur Shelter. It was getting hot out and there was plenty of people taking a break there. Subman went for water and took time to soak his feet in the water. Besides Spydy and Hey Jude and her friend, Fire Walker came in shortly after us. There was also a older couple there. Her name was Mother Nature and his was Father Time. They had thru hiked in 1998. When I asked what there ages were, he was 92 yrs old and she was 79 yrs old. The looked fantastic and were a delight to talk to. While we were talking a SoBo named,  Snowman came in for the night. He had started early in the morning to beat the heat. We left war Spur Shelter and began a 2000ft climb up Jones Creek Mountain. It was over 2.5 miles of very steep climbing, and it was the hottest time of the day. We were very slow and took many breaks. At a road in the middle of our climb we saw Mountain Mike. He was there to pick up Hey Jude and her friend. A young man named Hopper was headed to the next shelter and we told him We would see him there. We had been drinking a lot and adding Electrolytes to our water, even so, Sub was starting to get muscle cramps. He struggled  with them the rest of the hike until we reached Laurel Creek Shelter. We ate dinner and got in our tent to try to alleviate  the cramps and aches and pains.","VA 635

Subman & Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635864,"I tried to get up a little earlier so we could walk in the cooler temps. We managed to get on trail just a half hour earlier than usual. I will keep trying.  Leaving we said goodbye to Hopper and headed North, we stopped at the water source and got 2 liters of water. Water was scarce today. We walk down through some pines and green pastures started to show through the trees. A LASH hiker, named Stir Crazy came up he was training for the CDT, he had hiked the AT in 04. Stir Crazy quickly past us as the trail turned to pastures we continued down until VA 630 where there was a flowing river. We stopped to take a break, and get water. Stir Crazy was also there. He was using a stick to eat his peanut butter. As we were sitting there we watched a large Black Pickup go by and pull into the trailhead right above us. Subman says ""there was an awful lot of AT stickers on that truck"". That spiked everyone's curiosity and we hung out a bit. Stir Crazy walked up and came back, He said ""there's a large cooler."" By this time Fire Walker had come up. He had just made that awful climb up Jones Creek Mountain, he had left War Spur Shelter at 4am. We all meandered up to the Trailhead and sure enough Nimbus and Buffy from ALDHA was setting up trail magic. All four of us chipped in and helped them set up. We were rewarded with soda, chips, coney dogs, and ICE CREAM! Hopper had also joined us. It was such a treat and great fuel to get over our 1300ft climb up to Bruiser Knob.  As we start our ascent there is a old log building that is showing the wear and tear of many years. We past the Kefer Oak,, the oldest oak tree on the Southern part of the trail.We passed two day hikers and stopped to talk, Subman and I stopped at the top and took a break, we were soon joined By Fire Walker. Then we  began our ridge walk we passed Sarver Hollow Shelter. It was a half mile down the mountain! We continue on and the trail is nice it has several piles of rocks, I think they are stones cleared from the land for farming. Then the trail turns Rocky, there are magnificent views of a valley and ribbons of mountains behind it. We saw a flip flopper named Cairn Kicker. We told her about the trail magic at the bottom of the hill. She scurried off for a chilidog. The rocks soon turned to boulders and large slabs. It was very technical and A little scary. I said a prayer and went for it. It was hot and we were tired but we eventually made it through the long scramble.  We began to go down and Subman saw on guthook that there was an unmarked spring 2 miles before the Shelter. We passed the Eastern Continental Divide and made it to the spring. While we were getting water we hear gunshots. I believe someone was target practicing, but I always get nervous when I'm hiking and hear gunshots. We had 2 miles down to Niday Shelter. I told Subman to go ahead I was working out some blister issues again. I think I'm going to try some Altras when we get to an outfitter. Subman has the tent up when I get in to the shelter, I finish setting up and he goes for water. We plan to rinse out our clothes. They are full of salt from sweating in this heat. We ate dinner and head to the tent. We are the only ones here tonight. We did lower miles to help with the terrain and heat. So far no major cramps for Subman. We are pushing the water. Tomorrow we see the Audie Murphy monument.","Laurel Creek Shelter

Subman & Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635991,"This morning I did better getting up early, we were on the trail by 545am with headlamps. It was easy trail as we headed 2 miles  down to VA621 Craig Creek road. We saw 2 eyes staring at us. It froze as our headlamps hit it. It was a beautiful Doe deer not 25 feet from us. Further On, Right before the trailhead there was a 5 gallon bucket that said thru hikers on it. We opened it and there were fruit cups, dried cranberries, then a bunch of individual bags that had Sunflower seeds, crackers and hummus, cranberries, applesauce, spoon, all in a bag for each hiker. It was like a Continental breakfast. It was perfect. There was even a huge sitting log nearby. By this time daylight had arrived so we put away our headlamps and continued across the road where we crossed over footbridges that crossed several streams. At the last stream we got water and started our 2.5 mile climb to ascend 1500ft to the Audie Murphy Monument. It was slow but a nice breeze would blow and give you a refreshing kiss. Towards the top Subman was waiting for me on a bench. We sat and had a snack and I took off my socks and put Bag Balm on my feet. There was a signal so I checked for messages and uploaded my journal. By this time Sub had left to go up to the monument we still had 0.7miles to go. He was waiting for me and we go up together. It is a very solemn place with many momentos place around the monument. Audie Murphy was the most decorated World War II veteran and had crashed an airplane near the monument. Sadly this generation of Americans are dying and with them the honorable virtues of a lost era. We followed a wood road to leave the monument and began our descent,  it seemed to be in steps as we went down and leveled off several times. On one of these levels we met Capsian and her friend no name. They warned us that someone saw a rattlesnake 2 miles north of the shelter. We had been seeing lizards out also, the warm blooded reptiles were out taking in the sun. We assured them we would keep our eyes open. There was also 2 older gentlemen there, ones name was Turqoise ( Turq for short), I can't remember the other gentleman's name. We continued down until we finally meet up at Trout Creek VA620. My face must of said a thousand words because Subman said your hurting baby. There was no signal to call a shuttle so I put on my big girl panties and we climbed the ridge towards Dragon Tooth. We stopped at a unmarked spring and filled up all our water bottles and began looking for a campsite. We passed 3 section hikers and told them about the spring. Water is very scarce on the ridgline and they had just come down Dragon Tooth. Soon we see a stand of hardwood trees. Right in the middle was a fire ring. It was flat and grassy, a perfect spot. We were setup and had cooked a hot lunch. Hikers passed by on their way to Dragon Tooth. We will tackle it refreshed in the morning. We have 7 miles to go to make it to 4 pines hostel. I took a nap and woke up about 4pm. About 5pm it began to rain and we are tucked into our tent listening to the rain While I write my journal","Niday Shelter

I had to put on my polar fleece. We got water from the stream and began our climb up to Dragons Tooth. We had a 1200ft climb to get to the Top of Cove Mtn where the monolith, Dragon Tooth was. There were long switchbacks to the ridge. Once on the ridgeline there were many rock scrambles all doable but time consuming. There is a great view that looks down on the valley. We can see Four Pines Hostel. That is where we plan to end our day. We keep going up until we see the blue blaze to visit Dragon Tooth. We are early so We have it to ourselves. We start down and the rock descent is very technical and challenges my fear of heights. We finally make it past the rock walls and the path turns to large steps that are easier to manage. As we go further North we encounter a meetup group of ten people from DC. Several other day hikers were making There way up to the Dragons Tooth. We climb down further and the trail is nice. Soon we are at Newport Road. We turn right and walk the 0.3 miles to the 4 pines hostel. The guinea hens are fluttering about, along with chickens.

We got our water at 4 pines so no need to take a chance on getting contaminated water that has cow run off in it. Everyone we have passed is doing the triple crown loop. The VA triple crown is dragons tooth, Macafee Knob and Tinker Cliffs.  The Azealas are blooming at elevation now and the trees are filling out. Yay shade from the sun. I saw some beautiful Lady Slippers, Lilly of the valley, and Columbine along the ridgeline. There are nice stepping stones and my new shoes are doing good so far. We get to the shelter and there are 2 other people there. Eunice who is doing a LASH to condition for a hike on the John Muir trail. Another gentleman was set up and warmly greeted us. We found a nice spot but with a little slope it was slim pickings. There is a nice piped spring and it is flowing light but steady. There were 2 young guys who we had leaped frogged to the shelter, they are doing the loop trail.

We had our coffee and breakfast, Usually a bar of some sort. We were on the trail by 530am with headlamps on. We were hoping to make the Sunrise on McAfee Knob. There was 3.7 miles to get there. Sunrise was at 620am so we were a little late to catch all of it. The Boisterous group from our Shelter was there, making a fire right on trail to the overlook. We got some pictures and helped a few get their pictures. After a break it was close to 9am when we pressed on. We came down from the Knob and hiked a ridgeline until we got to the climb up to Tinker Cliffs. It was a steep 800 ft climb straight up. It was getting warm out and I had drank my last water with 2 miles to go. Luckily we had reached the top and walked the half mile cliff walk. After a 1 mile downhill we came to Lambertmeadows Shelter. It was 1230pm. We had beat the heat and set up camp in a breezy, Shady spot.

Soon a Father with his teenage Son and Daughter passed us. The trail was nice and easy with a slow incline as we worked our way through Troutdale. It was mowed and like walking through a yard, after crossing under I- 81 we began our big climb of 1300ft to Fullhardt Knob Shelter where we get water from a cistern with a spigot.  We see the Dad with his kids again, they are from Dekalb Illinois. Spydy is also there slowly packing up. He had gotten in just in time to get in his tent before the thunderstorms yesterday. Grizzie Bear was there, he had fallen and hurt his back and was trying to recover so he was staying at the shelter today. We asked Grizzie Bear if he had enough food to hold up  extra days, and gave him some Electrolytes to help with his back spasms.  We eat a snack and continue on. The trail is nice mostly void of roots and rocks. We met a couple from Montana, Transporter and T Squared from Montana. they were doing a LASH NoBo from Daleville to Port Clinton to finish the trail from last year. As we were talking to the couple, a young man named Mr. Darcy stopped to say hi,  he was from Missouri.We had a few steep rollers but we had put in 11 miles and it was noon. Time for that sandwich I had been thinking about all day. 1 mile  before Wilson Creek Shelter is Wilson Creek. I filled a water bottle and tried to cross on the slippery rocks I fell in up to my knees, getting my new shoes all wet. After getting my bearings I just forded the fast moving Creek and made my way up to the shelter. Nothing was hurt but my pride. Mr. Darcy and Subman were at the shelter having lunch and I joined them. We had taken a break long enough that it was just Subman and I at the shelter. Subman points out a visitor right next to the shelter, about 20ft from us is a deer grazing on leaves and not minding us being near her. We watched her a while then headed out toward Tyler Mountain Overlook on the Blue Ridge Parkway. Our Outback was there which meant we were able to carry 1 day of food today, it was nice to have a light food bag for the mountains out of Daleville. Close to the overlook we See Aspen with her Dog and 2 friends. We had met Aspens Mom at the hotel, She was supporting them while visiting them. Today Aspen was going for a 30 mile day slackpacking. Oh to be young again. Reaching the overlook we go to Daleville to get the Ascent and grab Wendy's burgers on our way to Jennings Creek to drop the Outback for tomorrow. It is a nice trailhead so we decide to Boondock here before going back to the overlook in the morning. There is no sleeping at the overlooks on the Blue Ridge Parkway.

We ran into a NoBo woman Thru hiker named Tex, she was from Texas. We talk a bit then Subman and I headed out and Tex followed. Tex held back a bit and Subman and I went ahead. Soon we see a white duplex, sure enough it was Spydy. He said he had a beautiful sunrise but he got cold so he had to get back in his tent. We all chuckled acknowledging his late start times. I enjoy talking with him. Sub and I  ducked into Bobblets Gap Shelter. There was a nice piped water source that I filled up on. There was one unreliable source at Bearswallow Gap for our whole day of 14miles. After leaving the shelter we run into Irish going SoBo. He was Slacking a 20mile day back to Daleville.  Subman and I go on and enjoy the day. I admired all the Mountain Laurel, Rhododendrons and azeala blooms, along with all the other wildflowers.

We went into Bryant Ridge shelter. It was a 2 story shelter with open porches and an enclosed room with windows. I remember in 2016,  AK exclaimed Man this shelter is nicer than my house back home! Today it was just Subman and I getting water and eating a snack. We were trying to fuel up for the 2000ft climb up Floyd Mountain. The only saving grace for all this climbing is that it is cool in the high 40s and the forecast changed to rain 50% at 10am to 12pm instead of all day. All of these things are better than an 80° day. It began to rain right on time just sprinkling at first thrn pretty steady. We stopped at a tent site to eat our lunch and I put on my poncho, it is like being in a tent and it makes me happy when it's rainy. After eating and taking a break we hiked 600ft more to summit Floyd Mountain.  We passed up Cornelius Creek Shelter and continue on another 2.5 miles of rollers. When we got to the Apple Orchard Falls trail intersection we met a Day Hiker named Cappy. She was excited to hear about the AT and was on her own adventure of driving a Sprinter van up the Blue Ridge Parkway. After talking to Cappy we had one more climb 900ft to summit Apple Orchard Mountain. At the Summit there is a huge FAA tower. We start to descend and there are many steps made from rocks. The area is Rocky and we are lead through the guillotine. A large Boulder that is trapped by 2 stones. Seeing the guillotine meant we were on our final descent into Thunder Ridge Overlook. We passed Thunder Hill Shelter and met A SoBo section hiker, who really wasn't interested in a conversation. Within a mile we reached the overlook glad to have such a hard day behind us. There was Trail magic! Mr Buck was sharing chips, drinks and fruit. All of which was very welcome! Jack Rabbit was there a SoBO named Brad and Sub and I.

As we start down on our way to HighCock Knob we take in the whole forest floor being covered by trillum blossoms, it is breathtaking! High-octane Knob is our steepest climb today. After reaching the top we treat ourselves to the Sub sandwiches we packed out.

It made me feel so blessed to be able to attempt another thru hike and not have to juggle a job and the time needed to thru. Most of our trail was downhill today, which wasn't good for me. My big toes have developed blisters under the toenails. The blisters are getting a little fustrating. Near the Sulpher Spring trail we ran into our first Ridge Runner, Mia or trail name Spider.

We had laundry to do and we Had also heard from Beach Girl and Stumpknocker that they were coming into Glasgow to hike North. This was the perfect reason to recouperate and soak my feet some more. Subman took Slow Poke, Smiles and Slo Mo back to the trailhead. When Subman returned we took a 15min. Drive to a Diner called Pink Cadillac for an awesome breakfast. Then we stopped at a nearby Wal Mart to get Salami and naproxen that we couldn't find in Glasgow. I had Laundry to do when we got back to the shelter so Subman dropped me off and took Lorax and Yip to the trailhead. That left Jack Rabbit and legs and his friend who were zeroing at the shelter with Sub and I. Soon a pickup pulls up  and a guy jumps out with a cooler. It is Terradyctal who hiked in 2016. He was passing through town and had brought drinks and munchies for the hikers. We spent a quiet afternoon soaking my feet and keeping them up. We are in our tent but hear a loud group come in. Both Subman and I are tucked in  for hiker Midnight. Does this mean we are old🤔","US 501 Glasgow

So I planned to continue  soaking them. We talked to Beach Girl and Stumpknocker and made plans to meet at the John Hollow Shelter. It is the first Shelter in at 1.7 miles. They will be traveling most of the day so it will be a good meeting place for us. Before leaving Glasgow we stopped at the dollar store and I purchased sandals with an open toe in case my toes did not do well with my shoes. We finally head out of town and walk the 1.7 miles to the Shelter we are set up and waiting to meet our friends and enjoy catching up.,"Us 501 Glasgow

We had a big climb right out of the shelter. We climbed 2000ft to summit Big Rocky Row. Then hiked the saddle over to Bluff Mountain. There was a lot of climbing, but we were rewarded with fantastic views. At the top of Bluff Mountain there is a monument to Ottie Cline Powell, a 4yr old who had wondered from his school and died. At the Summit there are concrete slabs that once held a now gone fire tower. We arrived at The Punch Bowl over look and took the Ascent back to US 501 to get our cars and go to the Glasgow Shelter to tent and get showers and eat a great meal at Scotto's.","John Hollow Shelter

Today was a beautiful walk along a river valley by a cascading river. It is the historical site of the Brown Mountain community. A Black community that lived here and you can see the stone walls and an old fireplace. Before we got to the shelter there was a massive blow down that took some climbing to get over.

We took the outback over to punchbowl overlook and then went to the Tye River Trailhead where we met Stumpknocker and BeachGirl to return to Long Mountain Wayside. We continued hiking North with a 2000ft climb of Bald Knob. After several false Summits we finally reach the top. Once up on the ridge the views were Awesome. We saddle over to Cole Mountain and it is a grassy Bald with 360° views that were fantastic.  After coming down Cole Mountain we crossed a road to a Meadow where we will camp for the night.,"Brown Mountain Creek Shelter

The terrain was gentle rollers and Beachgirl and I enjoyed a smooth steady walk. It has been a blessing to have Beach Girl and Stumpknocker here with us. Beachgirl has not hiked in 3 years and she has gotten right into the swing of things. I'm keeping her in front of me to try to make me walk at a gentler and slower pace, So far it is working and all but one of my big toes are healed. The pain is manageable but I'm a little concerned about infection.  Beach Girl, Stumpknocker and I, met up with Subman at Rock Spring. We all felt good say we voted to go on another 1.6 miles to Spy Rock. The catch was, there is no water at Spy Rock so we had to water up at Rock Spring and carry it the 1.6 miles....uphill.Beachgirl and I took turns picking trees to climb to on the trail. Once there we could take a few breaths before going for the next tree we chose. We evenly made it up to Spy Rock by 5pm and we all set up and had dinner.

Subman & Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637091,"Subman and I got up a bit early and were on the trail by 630. We were trying to get to Tye River and go to pick up the car we left at Long Mountain Wayside. Stumpknocker and Beach Girl had a car at Tye River also. Subman and I made good time to the trailhead and arrived at 11am. It was a 3 mile down and I have to admit a little hard on the toes. We passed 3 day hikers so I was astonished at the amounts of cars at the trailhead. It was Saturday but still cars waiting on spots as you leave. We went 1 hour back to Long Mountain Wayside to pick up the Ascent and went to Reeds Gap. It was packed but we were fortunate enough to get a spot for the outback. We went into Waynesboro and got a free shower at the YMCA and Then Subman dropped me off at the Urgent Care Clinic to get my toes checked for infection. The Dr. Gave me a prescription to use if they got any worse. I went to the CVS pharmacy to pick it up and they told me they were 14 days behind and didn't take tricare so I will get the Rx transferred if needed. Waynesboro is a reminder of why I need to hike. Beach Girl and StumpKnocker had a hard Descent. Beach Girl has a knee that is Bone on Bone and it took its toll today. I thought of her all day and said a prayer hoping to help the descent off the Priest. Subman had got us a room at Budget Inn and when we went to the rooms they were unsatisfactory. We all decided to go towards the Highway and see what was better for the money. Subman and I got a great deal at Motel 6 and Stumpknocker and Beach Girl went to the Quality Inn. Since we had cars we had options. I did our laundry we inventoried our food and after talking to Beach Girl and Stumpknocker we will meet in the morning and Stumpknocker, Subman and I will do the Tye River to Reed Gap hike tomorrow while Beach Girl recovers and roots us on. Subman and I also made contact with Nightengale who lives in the area. Nightingale saved Subs and my Butt at Reeds Gap in 2016. She picked us up in a freezing rain and we were able to get off trail. The lodging in Waynesboro was slim pickings, due to college Graduations, but she got us to a hotel and out of the weather. I will be forever Grateful and hope to meet up with her if at all possible.","Spy Rock

Subman & Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637255,"Subman, Stumpknocker, and I left for the Tye River Trailhead and Beachgirl decided to sit this one out. Stumpknocker said he remembered 3 ridges being difficult. It was an overcast day with intermittent rain showers. Stumpknocker said he was going to be slow so Subman and I headed up the first 1000ft at a pretty good clip. We passed Slo-Mo at the bottom of the climb. Slo-poke was at the trailhead before the suspension bridge. A Nobo, Sling , who had a laughing Sling Monkey in his pack passed us. We finally get to the Harpers creek Shelter and I stopped to use the Privy. Right behind us Was Stumpknocker. He continued on while Subman waited for me. That was the last Subman and I saw of Stumpknocker all day. I quess he found his trail legs. The next 2000ft of trail is Rocky and Boulder scrambles. It is raining and a cold wind. I put on my poncho to block the wind. Subman and I both thought about the freezing rain in 2016 that Nightengale saved us from. The whole day is climbing three ridges and then a 3 mile downhill to Maupin Field Shelter, the Rocks made it hard. Subman and I make it into Reed Gap 1 hour after Stumpknocker. We said goodbye to both Stumpknocker and Beachgirl since they will be returning home Monday. We took the outback to Tye River to get the Ascent and then drove over to Rockfish Gap to leave the outback for Monday. Since we are starting at Reeds Gap Monday, we stayed at the Devil's Backbone Brewery at the AT camp. There is a nice bath house and showers free for those AT thru hiking. We also made plans to meet with our Trail Angel, Nightengale, to catch up. It was so good to see her again and she is a wealth of information for the Shenandoah Park. We enjoyed a wonderful dinner at the Brewery. We then said goodnight and set up our  camp.","Tye River

Subman & Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637319,Subman and I stopped at a local gas Station and got a few bars and breakfast sandwiches to pack out. We had been anxiously waiting to get to the Shenandoah Nat'l Park and going to Rockfish Gap would put us at the doorstep of the Shennies. We left Reed Gap and it was rocky right off the bat. The five miles to Dripping Rock was nothing but rock hopping. We crossed the Blue Ridge Parkway and sat next to a spring and ate our breakfast sandwiches. That fueled us up to climb the 1000ft Humpback Mtn. In true AT fashion what comes up must go done and the next 4 miles was switchbacks down to Humpback Gap. At least it was good trail now and not as rocky. There was a little leveling off before we went even further down into a river bed and John Wolf  Shelter. We rested and snacked at the Shelter before going the last 5 miles into Rockfish Gap. It was a long day but we were happy to be going into the park tomorrow. We boondocked back at the Brewery and got free camping and showers. Slo Mo was also there with his Brother who was joining him for a few days.,"Reed Gap

Subman & Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637435,"i was tired when we got up this morning. It was reminiscent of working 3rd shift. We stopped by our little gas station and got coffee and breakfast sandwiches, that helped a bit. Today we were entering the Shenandoah Nat'l Park. At the entrance we ran into Phoenix, who was testing her knee after a 4 week break to heal a stress fracture. It was mostly uphill to get on the ridge of the park. After 5 miles We finally reached the top of Bears Den Mountain where there were communication towers and seats made from old metal tractor seats. Coming down from Bears Den Mtn I hit a toe rock and fell, almost taking Subman out with me. Yup it was that kinda day. We go down into Beagle Gap there were 2 clean  porta-potties which are always welcome.  Then up we went up again to summit little Calf Mountain and Calf Mountain. After summitting we walk in a ways to Calf Mountain Shelter which had a piped spring. Water is getting scarce and far apart.. As we were getting our water there was a Doe deer standing and watching us about 20 feet away. She did not mind us one bit. We continued down into Jarman Gap.  The 3 remaining miles was climbing Turk Mountain. We finally reached our car. There was a note on the windshield saying Hi, from Merlin who we had hiked with in 2016 with his dog monkey. He must have seen our car decals with our trail names. It was great to hear from him and wow what were the odds of him being there at the same time since he is from MA. We went into Waynesboro to get KT tape at walmart and picked up the Ascent at the SNP gate to place a car near Loft Mtn. Campgrounds. On the way I fell asleep at the wheel and crossed the road and hit a 2 foot stone wall. Praise God for that wall or I would have went off the mountain. The next 3 hours entailed calling a tow truck and insurance claims to get my car fixed. It could have been so much worse. We camped in the park and will Tye up lose ends tomorrow.","Rockfish Gap

We were at the Doyle overlook by 1230pm and went to the campstore and ate a pkg of hot dogs and coke. We got a campsite at Loft Mtn. Campgrounds. We had met up with Sharon, Argentina, and Spotter and they were all at the campground with us. While they got showers we walked the extra 3 miles to the Campground Store from the Doyle River overlook.

By 3 miles I had drank over a liter of water so we stopped to get water at the Ivy creek that crossed the AT . We had a 400ft climb then a descent to The Ivy Creek lookout. We found a shady spot on the wall at the overlook to have second breakfast. Several people stopped to say hi, mountain Goat who was from Dayton Ohio, Alaska who was from Ohio, a Ridge Runner Named Easy Going, to name a few. We finally felt rested enough to press on. The heat was beginning to elevate and we still had some high mountains to climb. After  passing Pinefield Hut we began our 500ft climb of Weaver Mountain. The heat was sweltering as the sun rose on our side of the mountain. I think the temps were to be 88° today, and it felt like it. We went down into Simmons Gap. There was a Ranger Station 0.2miles down the hill with a water pump. Subman walked down the hill to get us water. We then had a 700ft climb at high noon and then went down into Powell Gap. Subman and I both were exhausted and overheated. We finished the last 1.5 miles on a upward incline into Smith Roach Gap. We had parked our car there to end our day.  Schlepps Brother and Sister in Law were set up for Trail magic! They were making fire roasted pizzas and cold drinks. What great magic. After placing our cars for the next day, we received an invitation from Blissful and Papa Bliss to come to their home for a Lasagna Dinner, showers and a bed for the night. I have to admit Sub and I were discussing going home after such a hot day. After the morale boost with Blissful and Papa Bliss they had convinced us to go back out. So wemade plans to do a short day and start even earlier to climb High Top Mountain. So thankful for the wonderful Hospitality we were given.","Loft mountain Camp Store

I can't eat and I'm nauseous. Sub does not ""do well in the heat"" is an understatement. The heat and humidity even got to me going to Smith Roach Gap. My toes are still blistered but healing. It frustrates me that I have been dealing with blisters since Atkins (400 miles) after new shoes and soaking and Dr. Appts. I will lose 4 toenails in the near future. I have lost 30 pounds and thats a good running start for the 55 lbs I wanted to lose. We are healthier now and plan on continuing to check off our bucket list.
