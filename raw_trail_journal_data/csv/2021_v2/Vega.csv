Vega,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651690,"Day 1!  I'm finally doing this!  I checked my gear and packed my pack.  Then paced (as best I could in a small motel room) anxiously.  Then upacked my pack, rechecked all my gear, and packed it all up again.  This process repeated until check out time, when I finally put on my pack, checked the room to make sure I hadn't forgotten anything, and headed outside.A very brief walk, and I reach the point where the trail leaves Harpers Ferry and joins US 340.  So it begins.  The first steps of a 2000 mile journey take me across the Shenandoah on a pedestrian bridge next to the highway.  It's a beautiful place to start, the river splashing beneath, the picturesque town of Harpers Ferry to the left, the first climb, Loudoun Heights, looming ahead.Now climbing said heights.  It's easier than I thought it would be.  I'm breathing heavily, but not out of breath.  I can feel the weight of the pack on my joints, but it's not painful.  I finish the climb and have a fairly easy time of it along a ridgeline.Lunch is at a road crossing.  A quarter mile east is a gas station.  I grab lunch, a couple sodas, and a little more food for the journey ahead.  I eat lunch at the road crossing.  A few miles west is Charles Town.  A part of me whispers that I could head that way, I could reach the town by dinner, sleep in a motel, give up this ridiculous endeavor.  I resist the voice and head back into the woods, heading south.The rest of the day is uneventful and make a respectable 12 miles to Blackburn, which has tentsites, clean water, and even a spot to charge electronics.  I make dinner, eat dinner, set up my tent.  I still haven't adjusted to trail life, so I'm having difficulty figuring out what to do during downtime.  I make a fire to keep myself occupied until dark, then head to bed.Happiness is a cozy campfire.","Harpers Ferry, WV

Here's the problem with trail towns:  they're almost always at the bottom of a climb.  So when you leave a town (with a pack laden with days  of food) there's almost always a big climb.  This was the biggest yet, some 1500 feet of elevation gain.
Lunch was a treat.  In town I bought fresh rolls, a block of cheese, precooked bacon, and several tomatoes.  That makes for some tasty sandwiches.I entered Shenandoah National Park a little after lunch, saw some bear scat, and filled out a backpacking permit.Made it to Gravel Springs Hut shortly before the heavens opened up.  Luckily I was able to set up camp before the rain started.Happiness is a dry tent interior during a torrential downpour.","

It had a concession stand, so I had a cheeseburger, fries, and a soda. And more fries. And another drink.Later that afternoon, scary storms swept the area. Sought shelter in an underpass beneath the Taconic Parkway. After about 45 minutes, the storms passed and I was able to keep hiking. There was a deli ahead, not far off trail, so I hurried to get to it before it closed at 8. Got there at 6:55.There was a sign on the door saying they were closing at 6 today. Rats. Luckily, there was a pizzeria next door open until 7. Was able to snag half a pizza and a soda before they closed. Hurray!Hurried back to the trail, as there were more scary storms coming. Made it back to the trail and found a spot to pitch my tent just as it started raining. Quickly got the tent up and threw everything inside as the heavens opened up.

The top of the mountain had a fire tower with 360 views of western North Carolina. I got to the first paved road crossing in nearly 40 miles, and immediately a guy in an RV pulls over and offers me a cold beer. I politely declined and continued on (the cold part was really tempting). This sort of thing happens a lot, people offer me food, or beer, or rides.

I got up and walked the nine miles to the road that would lead to Erwin, Tennessee. Erwin is several thousand feet lower than the trail, so it was quite hot on the 4 mile road walk into town. Got a motel room, showered (so nice), did laundry, then went to a grocery store to pick the sacrifices for the Sarlacc Pit that is my stomach.

I was a little apprehensive about getting Mexican in rural Tennessee, but this place was pretty good. Back to the trail. Climbing with a heavy food bag. Getting used to new shoes. 2 hours in, it started raining. I get soaked. My new shoes get soaked. Sigh. I look up info on the next shelter, I like to know when the next privy is, especially after eating spicy Mexican food. Turns out the next shelter doesn’t have a privy. None of them do. For the next hundred miles. Oh well; I have a shovel. Climbed up Beauty Spot, another bald, with the sound of thunder behind me. Race up and over the exposed summit to the safety of the trees on the other side. It starts to rain again, so I set up camp in a gap between two mountains. Just as it’s getting dark, a couple shows up and starts setting up camp thirty feet from me. They’re fairly loud. Sigh. I fall asleep but keep waking up to the sound of them talking in their tent. Finally, around 11, I get out of my tent (wet shoes), go to their tent, and ask if they’re planning on going to sleep tonight. They’re real quiet after that. Tomorrow will be a better day.

This is where I would have camped last night if they’re hadn’t been a threat of thunderstorms. It drizzles on and off. Much of my time is spent watching the ground in front of me, so I don’t step on the salamanders on the trail. Some days I must see several hundred of them. Their defense mechanism seems to be to freeze when they sense a predator coming. Not a great strategy when you’re bright red on a brown background. Check off another thing on the must-do thruhiker list, I finally had Spam on this trip. It wasn’t bad; a nice change from tuna fish. Started climbing Cloudland Mountain, the first peak in the Roan Mountain Highlands. A more than 2000 foot climb, up to a summit of 6200 feet. It starts raining again as I climb. Hard. And the wind picks up. It gets chilly as I get higher. Finally the rain let’s up as I enter an area of conifers, ferns, and moss. At the summit is the remains of a hotel that once stood here. No views, just thick fog in every direction. Also, a state park. Which has bathrooms. With functional plumbing! I set up camp near the bathrooms, which I make use of.

When walking 2000 miles over the course of several months, there are going to be days that are just miserable. Endless uphills, knee-destroying downhills, hot and humid days, cold blustery days, bugs, aches and pains, tiredness, hunger. The day started out well enough. It was chilly being so high up, but pleasantly so. It drizzled a little bit, then stopped, then a fog persisted. Hiked down off the summit, across a gap, then up Round Bald. Then it started to rain. A lot. And the wind kicked up. No protection from the elements on a bald. Visibility fifty feet. Off Round Bald, then over Jane Bald and Grassy Ridge Bald. Raining the whole time. The trail became a stream. Clothes soaked. Rain eased up as I got back in the forest. Then the climb up Hump Mountain, the largest bald yet. And the rain came again. The rain halted right before I left the bald, and the fog rose, giving me a peak of the view these mountains are known for. All this time, my feet are soaked. All my socks are wet. I started looking for a place to set up camp. I had been warned that drunken ATVers would sometimes harass hikers in this next section. Sure enough, every campsite I came to had signs of four-wheelers having driven through. It took several hours before I found an isolated campsite that looked quiet. I managed to get my tent set up and inside just as it started raining again. I don’t think I have ever had such an unpleasant day hiking. And tomorrow is forecast to rain all day. Sigh.

Bad enough to set out in wet socks and shoes, striking camp in the rain is extra miserable. It took about 4 hours before the rain stopped. Put on wet socks (eww) and wet shoes (eww) and headed north. The trail was mostly through lowlands, sometimes paralleling a river, so there many stream crossings. Fine under normal conditions, but tricky crossings with all the rainfall. The weather today went like this: 30 to 45 minutes of cloudiness, maybe with the sun peeking out for 5 minutes; then a downpour for 10-15 minutes, so heavy you could usually hear it a good 30 seconds before it hit you; then 15 minutes of drizzle. This repeated at least half a dozen times over the course of the day. I don’t think I’d ever experienced weather like this before. The wetness took a toll on my body. I got tired earlier. Several toes got bandaged due to chafing. The back of my left heel got rubbed raw, I was still limping with it taped up. Set up camp early, after what was forecast to be the end of the rain. Of course, half way through dinner, another storm came through and I had to finish dinner in the tent. Everything I had left outside to dry got soaked. On the bright side, no rain in the forecast for the next week. Happiness is knowing that things will finally start drying out.","Elk River

The trail followed the river for several miles, passing the Laurel Fork Falls, the best waterfall I’ve seen so far. Got off trail and walked two miles into Hampton, Tn. Had lunch at McDonald’s, charged my phone, and bought some snacks from a gas station. The trail climbed 2000 feet up a mountain, no view at the top, then went back down 2000 feet. Stupid trail. Went around the west end of Lake Watauga, which was very crowded with people swimming, sunbathing, and riding watercraft. Weirdly, there were no services near the lake; no restaurant or store, not even a vendor selling drinks or snacks. Climbed up the mountain on the north side of the lake and set up camp. Saw a bear!

Vega,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651416,"I was dozing off last night, heard the sound of thunder. Originally it was just going to be partly cloudy. I checked the weather forecast, now severe thunderstorms in the area. Great. It quickly started raining. Thunder kept getting louder and louder. At its closest, lightning was about a mile and a half away. At that distance, the thunder was loud enough to make my air mattress thrum. Overall, not an experience I would recommend. I had planned on doing big mileage today, so that tomorrow would be a short day into Damascus, but I read an update that said that a 13 mile stretch of the trail was closed to camping due to “aggressive bear activity”. So I could either hike up to 18 miles, or at least 31. I chose to do 18, which meant doing 18 tomorrow to get into Damascus. I took it easy today, knowing it was a shorter day. I took more breaks, and longer. At a watering hole I ran into Humble Pie. Humble Pie is a section hiker I had met before getting off at Erwin. When not hiking, he teaches physics, astronomy, and backpacking, so we got along pretty well. We chatted for a bit, and then I continued on, planning to meet up later at the last shelter before the no camping zone, where we both planned on camping. I passed a monument that someone had erected in honor of their uncle. The uncle had lived a hermit life in a cabin at that spot. The epithet: “Lived alone, suffered alone, died alone”. Oof. That’s dark. Humble Pie and I got to the shelter around 5:30. No one there. Weird. Had dinner, set up our tents, prepared for bed, still no one else showed up. Usually there are plenty of people at shelters. Given that the next 13 miles were closed to camping, I had expected the shelter to be extra crowded. Maybe the bears ate everyone at the shelter before we got there. And then hid their gear. Bears are crafty that way.

The trail goes right through town, down Main Street, past a pretty park and past most of the restaurants and shops. Damascus is probably the most hiker-friendly town I’ve been to so far. Had lunch at the Damascus Diner. Black Angus burger and fries. So tasty. Picked up my bounce box at the post office and met Humble Pie as he was coming into town. We went to Crazy Larry’s Hostel, where we had booked a shared room. Crazy Larry. Imagine Seth Rogen in his sixties, with the same laugh and marijuana enthusiasm. That’s Larry. He was a nonstop talker and the very definition of a “character”. The room was nice, the bathroom was very clean, and Larry was a gracious host. I took a shower, first time in a week. There was a scale in the bathroom, so I weighed myself for the first time since before started the trail. 178! I think I was at least 215 when I started. Larry bought us pizza for dinner.

Get there to find the owner telling people that he won’t open till 11, as a plumber is coming to clear out a drain. All of the other restaurants in town either didn’t open until lunch, or were closed on Wednesdays (my theory is that many of the original Damascus settlers were Norse, and preferred to keep Orin’s day sacred). So weird. That meant the only place in town to get breakfast was the gas station. Hope I don’t get brain worms. Turns out the mini-restaurant in the gas station was pretty good. I got a bacon, egg, and cheese biscuit, a couple of orders of hash browns, and biscuits with sausage gravy (best part of eating in the South is the sausage gravy). Then on to the outfitters to buy gear. I got a couple of new stuff sacks, a butter knife (my Swiss Army knife wasn’t great with peanut butter), and a sleeping bag liner (partially to have something light to sleep in, partially to have something I could easily clean and keep my sleeping bag from getting nasty (er). Now it’s past 11, so it’s time to get lunch from the diner (come on, I hadn’t eaten in over 2 hours). I had another burger and fries. This was the end of Humble Pie’s section hike, so we said goodbye. I headed back on the trail, while he waited for his daughter to pick him up. Back on the trail. A couple hours in, I got off at a bike trail, as I had heard there was a cafe that sold ice cream and soda. Got to the cafe, and you guessed it, closed on Wednesdays. Fudge.

I went to take out my earbuds so I could listen to some podcasts. I had the wire, but the buds were missing. The wires just ended, like they had been cut. I usually keep my earbuds in a mesh pocket on the side of my tent. I figured out later that some critter had chewed a hole in the mesh side of my tent, bitten off the buds, and left the rest. Oh well, no podcasts today. I’m walking along a ridge when a bear cub jumps out of the undergrowth maybe 20 feet to my right and heads downhill. If the bear was a dog, I’d say it was 40-50 pounds, to give you an idea of how small it was. I got video of what I think is the same bear. It was hard to tell with the distance and the angle. Either the video has the same cub in it (which means mama is nearby glaring at me), or the video has mama bear, and the cub is hiding. Either way, really cool. Got to the road that led to town. Stopped at a roadside restaurant and had a pulled pork sandwich. Yummy! Then three miles down a highway in the hot sun. The town itself was pretty sad, one motel, two gas stations, and a Dollar General half a mile away. Good enough for this tired, hungry hiker. Got a shower and then went to the Dollar General to resupply, but new earbuds, and get food for the night. Back at Erwin, I had decided to try and eat as many different flavors of Ben & Jerry’s as I could on the Trail, as calorie counting was something I did not have to worry about. Since then, though, in Hampton, Damascus, and now Atkins, no Ben & Jerry’s! Boo. Carried my food back to the motel, ate myself into a stupor while watching reruns of The Office, and fell asleep.

The Cubs had climbed a tree next to the trail and the mama bear had snorted at him when he started to approach the becubbed tree. He then backed away from the bears, going back up the trail until they were out of sight. We decided to go down the trail together, to see if the bears had moved away. We quickly spotted mama, to whom I gave a loud greeting (don’t want to accidentally sneak up on and startle a mama bear). No sign of the cubs, so we slowly walked past mama, until she turned and ran.

It was so humid out that I was covered in sweat by 8 a.m., going downhill. Yuck. After about two hours, reached the Tye River, crossed it on a suspension bridge, and started going uphill. This time was a 3000 foot climb, during the most humid day yet. About three hours and half a mile of elevation gain later, ran into a guy near the top. He warned me about a guy at the next shelter who was mooching off of people, and then, seemingly without noting the irony, tried to bum a cigarette off of me. Just as I reached the top and started walking along a ridge, I started hearing thunder. The sky didn’t look particularly ominous, and the thunder was fairly distant and infrequent, so I wasn’t worried. It drizzled for the next hour or so as I walked along the ridge, which felt quite nice. It started raining more steadily as I got to the Maupin Field Shelter. Nicely timed. I could eat lunch in the shelter while I waited for the rain to stop. In the shelter was Rocky, who was section hiking from central Virginia to Massachusetts. She was from Juneau, Alaska, and had lived in Barrow, above the Arctic Circle, before that. It was neat to hear about life that far north. We sat in the shelter, watching the rain turn into a heavy downpour. A stream formed in front of the shelter, and the thunder came back with a vengeance. Lightning was striking so close that the accompanying thunder was virtually simultaneous. The thunder was so loud it made the floor of the shelter vibrate. This was one of the worst storms I’ve ever experienced while outdoors. Out of the rain came Matador and Postcard, fellow northbound thru-hikers. Matador I’ve seen off and on for the past two weeks. They were totally soaked. Then another guy came walking to the shelter. Unlike the others, he didn’t have rain gear or a pack, and didn’t seem to be in a hurry to get out of the storm. When he got into the shelter, he started asking if anyone had a lighter. Most of us said no (of course I had a lighter, but I’d noticed him fiddling with a box of smokes, and I didn’t want to be stuck in a shelter with that awful smell), but someone gave him a lighter, which was wet from the storm and wouldn’t light. The guy sat in the back of the shelter for nearly an hour flicking the lighter before it finally started working. I guess when you want a smoke, you want a smoke. Then two section hikers showed up and squeezed into the shelter. One of them told us that this storm was the edge of tropical storm Elsa. Now there were seven of us in a shelter that sleeps six, watching the rain, and occasionally seeing lightning so close we could see which tree it struck. Finally, around five, the thunder stopped, the rain dissipated, and the sun started to peek out. Everyone else was planning to spend the night at the shelter, but I had 22 miles until Waynesboro, and wanted to have a short day tomorrow, so I left the shelter and headed north. About three hours later, after stopping at a picnic ground with a bathroom (flush toilets!), I got to a view with an open area with room for several tents. There already were two thru hikers, a young man who’s name I didn’t get, and Mosey, an older female hiker. She was named Mosey because of her relaxed pace. By this point I was to tired to cook dinner, so I ate some snacks, put up my tent, and went to bed. Dried apricots are terrible. Not so terrible that I won’t eat them (I need all the calories I can get), but terrible enough that I’ll make sure their not in any trail mix I get for now on.

Looking around, I realized that the sky was clear and there were no clouds to be seen. I hobbled up to the summit of South Twin Mtn. The views were amazing! I could see in every direction, most of the Whites visible. Franconia Ridge, covered in clouds. Mt. Garfield. To the east, Mt. Guyot and beyond it, the Presidental Range. Amazingly, Mount Washington was cloudless. Also amazing, it’s 6 in the morning 5000 feet up in the Whites, and it’s not even chilly.Packed up and headed north. The trail continued to be rough, with lots of boulder hopping and rock scrambling. Every so often the trail would climb another mountain and peek above tree line. Eventually the trail descended steeply and came to Zealand Falls Hut. I refillled my water bag and made use of the facilities.And then something remarkable happened. The trail got easy. Flat, straight, and rock free. This section followed an old railroad bed, and I was able to make good time.Had lunch at Thoreau Falls, an 80 foot high series of cascades. I expected it to be crowded (I had been passing a steady stream of hikers), but there was no one else there. The trail continued to be flat, although it did get a little rockier. The flat terrain was good because it was very hot, and was still sweating profusely.Mid afternoon I descended to Crawford Notch. Took a mile detour up the road there to the Wiley House, where I had pizza, soda, and ice cream. Yum!Then starting climbing the far side of Crawford Notch. This is another 3000 foot climb which ends at the beginning of the Presidential Range. Got about half way up and decided that 12 hours of hiking was enough for today. My feet hurt, my knees hurt, my thighs burned. Ate a giant cookie I had gotten from the Wiley House for dinner and went to bed.

Vega,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651998,"Today was one of the most difficult, stressful, painful, amazing, spectacular, fulfilling days of my life.Got up super early this morning and was on trail 45 minutes before sunrise. This section is mostly above tree line and completely exposed to the elements; I wanted to get past Mount Washington before any afternoon thunderstorms hit.The first half mile was a steep rock scramble up Webster Cliffs. It was so early I had to use my headlamp to see. There were frequent views on the left, two thousand feet down to the bottom of the Notch, where I ate yesterday. Thankfully the wind was blowing from the left, so I didn’t have to worry about a gust pushing me over the edge. As I neared the top, I entered a thick fog. Reached the top in about 45 minutes ( for half a mile!).The trail then mostly leveled out for the next few miles, passing over Mt. Jackson and reaching Mizpah Hut. I stopped here to refill my water and make use of the facilities. Then the trail climbed steeply up to tree line. By this time the fog had burned off, and I could see Washington ahead, cloudless. Washington is infamous for its bad weather, and is rarely not covered in clouds. I was excited by the thought of having views from the summit of Washington, so pushed myself faster.Now above tree line, the trail was a jumble of rocks, where every foot step had to be planned carefully, lest I twist an ankle or fall on my face. The trail continued steadily upward, passing over some mountains, around others.Then past Lakes of the Clouds hut, and up the final ascent to Washington. There was no specific trail, just a jumble of rocks marked by the occasional cairn. This is the kind of climb where you half expect to encounter Gollum near the top.It was eleven now, and I was already running out of gas. The trail was hard, and it was hot on the exposed mountainside, without a cloud in sight. Hot and sunny, also windless, at the peak of Mount Washington? Weird.Finally reached the top, where I was met with several buildings, a parking lot, and way too many tourists (there is a road that leads to the top of the mountain, as well as a cog railroad).Mount Washington’s summit has an observatory, a museum, gift shop, and cafeteria. It’s the cafeteria I was most interested in. I had planned on getting some hot chocolate there, assuming I would have been cold from the climb, but I was hot and sweaty from the unexpectedly warm day. I did get some ice cream, pizza, soda, and lots of snacks. I spent awhile looking out at the landscape, marveling at the complete lack of clouds. Someone had told me that Mount Washington only gets 40 sunny days a year. Lucky me.This weekend is also when the ‘Race to the Clouds’ is held, which is auto racing up the road to the summit. I had heard the cars engines all morning as I had climbed toward the summit, and now I watched as the cars raced to the top and then went back down.Now it’s time to head down from the summit. I’m already sore from this morning’s hike, and every step downhill is painful. I pass by the cog railroad as several trains pass by, where several hikers continue the (really stupid) tradition of mooning the trains as they go by.Now as I pass Mounts Clay and Jefferson, I’m starting to get worried about the sun. I have a hat to protect my head and neck, but my arms are exposed. It’s too warm to wear anything long sleeved and I don’t have any sunscreen. I tried to find some at the summit, but they are sold out. I start to take breaks in the shade, trying to avoid getting sunburned.The day passes on as I hike around the Adams’ mountains, and down to Madison Spring Hut. From there, it’s a very steep climb up Mount Madison. The “trail” is very steep, requiring hands to scramble up the rocks. It’s very exposed this high up, and falling would be very bad.Finally at the summit of Mount Madison. I have amazing views of everything I crossed today, and I can see the Wildcat and Carter ranges, which I will cross over the next two days.Then down off Madison. I really want to stop hiking now, my legs really hurt, but I have to get below tree line. This descent is one that thru hikers talk about. Super steep, totally exposed, lots of rock hopping. It’s slow going, but I eventually make it down to tree line. Shortly after that, I find a campsite, set up my tent, eat some snacks, and fall right asleep. I don’t bother with getting under the quilt, as I’m sure the heat from my sunburned arms will keep me warm.

Then crossed several streams on fairly easy trail.The race cars were at it again today. I could hear their engines revving for several hours, until the trail crossed the Mt. Washington Auto Road. There were tow trucks and ambulances there, I guess in case one of the racers had an accident. Someone waved me across the road. Thirty or so seconds after I crossed the road, all the racers started coming down the mountain and whizzing past. Scary.At the base of the mountains, I reached the Pinkham Notch Visitor Center. Stopped for lunch (and Ben & Jerry’s!).Then the climb up the Wildcats. Another agonizing climb. Several sections required outright climbing. At one point I had to chimney up between two vertical rock faces. I don’t know how people with heavy backpacks are expected to do this.Slow going through the Wildcats. Then a super steep descent into Carter Notch, followed by a steep ascent up the other side. Halfway up I decided to stop hiking early and make camp.The weather had changed drastically.

As I put on my backpack, I managed to rip a seam in the shoulder of my hiking shirt. It wasn’t that bad, but I’m sure the rip will get worse as I hike.Hiked four miles along a busy highway to get back to the trail. A couple of the toes on my left foot were really hurting, I thought maybe they were still sore from crossing the Whites. I bandaged them up and continued on.After two hours and four miles on the trail, my toes were still hurting. I realized the problem was probably the shoes and not my feet. I was about to enter deep wilderness and I don’t think there are any places to buy shoes between here and Katahdin. I reluctantly decided that I needed to go back to Gorham and look for new shoes.

The mosquitos were really biting this morning. I would them on me, slap them, and get a smear of blood for my troubles. Yuck.Reached the AT about 2 hours later. This section of the trail was rough, lots of rocks and roots. No giant climbs, just short ups and downs. Also several ponds and bogs.Stopped at a campsite for lunch, figured I’d make use of the privy and refill my water bag from the spring. Touch my pack off, grabbed my dirty water bag, touch a couple steps on a rock slab, when both of my feet slipped and went into the air. I landed painfully on my back on the rock slab, the breath knocked out of me. Ouch.Nothing seemed to be broken, and I was able to stand back up. I guess I was lucky that the force of the fall was distributed across my entire back, and not in just one spot. Also, that I didn’t hit my head.After lunch, it started to drizzle.

Muddy sections, one where I slipped into knee deep mud. Steep rock faces that required holding on to trees when going uphill, or scooting on my butt when going downhill.And then I got to Mahoosic Notch. This is widely considered to be the most difficult mile of the trail. The notch itself is very steep, and you can see where some of the notch walls have collapsed, covering the bottom of the notch with boulders, some as big as houses. And the trail goes through this. Sometimes over, sometimes under.It took more than 2 hours to traverse the notch. Sometimes I had to take my pack off to wriggle through some hole or to climb down off some boulder. Some times I was completely reliant on my arms to get past some obstacle. I banged up my shins, my knees, my elbows. At one point, my foot got stuck in a crevasse as I slipped off a rock.

I should explain, the Appalachian Trail crosses the Kennebec River in Northern Maine. There are no bridge crossings for many miles north or south. The river is several hundred feet wide, and knee to waist deep in sections. There is a dam upstream that releases water periodically through the day and the water level can rise suddenly. Hikers have drowned trying to ford this river. For this reason, there is a ferry service (a guy in a canoe) provided by the ATC. The canoe is considered the “official” trail route, and there is even a white blaze painted on the bottom of the canoe.So now I’m hurrying down the trail to get to the river well before 2, when the ferry service ends.

Most of the morning involved crossing the Chairbacks. Ugh. For details on what this section was like, read Bill Bryson’s book on the trail. This was the section where he and Katz bailed.After the Chairbacks, I reached the Pleasant River. This river was deep enough and wide enough that I would need to ford it. Finally, this was what I had carried flip flops for. The ford wasn’t bad, especially since I wasn’t walking across the riverbed barefoot, and never got more than shin deep.After the river, the trail was easy, and I made good time.

This mountain is important because it is the first point on the trail where Katahdin is very clearly visible. I started to pick up my pace.Whitecap is difficult not just because there is 2500 feet of elevation gain between the river and the summit, but also because the mountain ridge has 4 peaks, each one higher than the the last. After each peak there is a descent, so it’s about 4000 feet of gain total. I had hiked this section five years ago and remember this climb being particularly arduous, with lots of stops to rest and catch my breath.What a difference five years make!

The caffeinated drinks and motivational music didn’t hurt either.I got to the saddle before the final peak and decided to stop.

I got into my tent, changed into what little dry clothes I had left, dove under my quilt, and went to sleep.Happiness is knowing that this was probably the last rain I will have to walk through this trip.","Antlers Campsite

Vega,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652076,"15.1 miles to Katahdin ( holy mother forking shirt balls!)Woke up at dawn. My sweater was still damp beneath me (I had slept on it in the hopes of drying it out). Had to get up to pee; didn’t want to because it was chilly and my shoes were very wet. Finally got out of the tent. Glad I did, as the sun rising over the lake was unbelievable. Ever see something so beautiful it makes you cry? This did. The sunrise, mists coming off the lake, loons crying in the distance. I took pictures, but none of them could do justice to the view.Changed out of my bed clothes into my hiking clothes. Still soaking wet after laying out all night. Ick. Then packed up and headed north.Most of the morning was along Rainbow Lake. Every so often I could hear (and sometimes see) a sea plane taking off or landing on the lake. Then a couple more hours and I was at the end of the hundred mile wilderness. I reached Golden Road, the first paved road in 100 miles. The trail follows this road for half a mile, in the middle of which it crosses the Penobscot River. The bridge crossing the river has amazing views of Katahdin to the north.Got a campsite at the Abol Bridge Campground, just the other side of the river. The campground has a store and was able to binge on soda, chips, and candy bars. Did laundry (dry socks) and got a shower. I can see Katahdin from my campsite, and I can’t stop staring at it.I called a shuttle service in the town of Millinocket, to schedule a ride into town tomorrow after I come down from summiting Katahdin. They might not be shuttling hikers tomorrow or for a while to come, due to recent COVID outbreaks in this part of the state. Both of the hostels in Monson, the previous town on the trail, have had outbreaks, and the virus has been spreading amongst thru-hikers. I haven’t stayed in a hostel since Virginia, I avoid shelters, so I’m probably not infected. If no one is shuttling hikers, I have no idea how I’m getting back home. Sounds like a problem for tomorrow.I only hiked 13 miles today on easy trail, I’ve had too much caffeine and sugar, and I’m excited about the idea of completing this adventure tomorrow so I don’t know if I’ll get any sleep at all tonight. I’m lying in my tent, staring at the ceiling wide eyed. I don’t want to sleep, I don’t want to rest, all I want to do is keep walking.Happiness is being one step away from completing the dream of a lifetime.","Rainbow Lake Dam

Vega,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652078,"0 miles to KatahdinWoke up around 2:15, well before my alarm was set. Why am I getting up so early? Katahdin is in Baxter State Park, which has restrictive rules about camping within its boundaries. I could either book a campsite within the park (which are usually booked weeks or months in advance), sign up for a spot at the one shelter the Park has set aside for thru-hikers (which only has room for 12, fills quickly, and would require me to be in close proximity to 11 other hikers who were almost certainly exposed to COVID last week), or camp outside the park, requiring 10 miles of hiking before I even start climbing Katahdin. I chose the third option. To reach the base of Katahdin around seven would require me leaving camp around 3 am.I packed up my things in the tent then climbed out. First thing I see is a bright star in the west; Vega, of course. The sky is so clear and it is so dark here that the stars are reflected in the river in front of my tent. Katahdin is visible only has a starless hole in the sky to the north. I finish packing up and head out to the road.It’s earlier than I had planned on setting out, so I spend a few minutes on the bridge over the river. The entire night sky is visible, the Milky Way clearly arcing across the sky. Orion is rising in the east, it’s Nebula a fuzzy spot. Several meteors shoot overhead. Absolutely perfect time for stargazing.3 a.m. Time to head north, for the last time. A quarter mile on the road, then the trail goes into the woods, where I shortly enter Baxter State Park. It is absolutely quiet and my headlamp, on low, illuminates just a few feet in front of me. The trail is flat and free of obstacles and I make good time.After an hour and a half, I pass Big and Little Niagara Falls, which I can hear but not see. The trail is a little rougher now, with more rocks and a slight incline, but I still make good time.By 6 I am at Daicey Pond, more than 8 miles from where I started. I stop at a picnic table on the shore and eat breakfast. Directly across the pond is Katahdin, backlit by the dawn, it’s crown wreathed in clouds. It is completely quiet except for the lapping of water on the pond’s edge and the distant cry of a loon.An easy mile and a half to Katahdin Stream Campground which is bustling with campers waking up, preparing to spend the day in the park, some of them climbing Katahdin. I meet a ranger who signs me in and gives me a hiking permit. They have day packs at the ranger station (who wants to climb Katahdin with a full pack?) but I opt to use the day pack to store the things I don’t need for the hike and take my backpack up with me.7:20 a.m., 5.2 miles, with 4200 feet of elevation gain, to go!The first mile is easy going, with a gradual climb. My pack is super light and I almost bounce as I walk. There is a bridge over Katahdin Stream and then the trail gets steeper.2 miles in, the trail is rougher. The rocks become boulders. More and more often hands are needed to pull myself up. Still not much different than almost any mountain in northern New England.Then the trail reaches tree line, and everything changes. It’s suddenly windy up here and I have to put on my wind breaker. The trail climbs Hunt spur, jutting out from the mountain like the prow of an inverted ship. This three quarter mile section takes almost as long to traverse as the rest of the 5 mile climb. I believe this is as difficult a trail can be without requiring technical climbing skills.Just after climbing above the trees, I clamber up the trail to a shelf, where the trail seems to end at a cliff wall. About seven feet up, there is an iron bar at the top of the cliff. I had to hoist myself up using that bar, with my feet finding holds in a crack in the wall below the bar, then awkwardly flop on to the top of the cliff.There were a number of these jungle gym obstacles as I climbed up the spur. Sometimes there were iron hand holds in rocks, sometimes I had to hold on to a crack in a rock with one hand while repositioning my feet. Many times all I could see of the mountain was the series of rocks right in front of me, with nothing but sky on the left and the right. This is not a good place for someone with a fear of heights. I kept thinking of Harold Ramis’s lin in Ghostbusters, “I’m sorry Venkman; I'm terrified beyond the capacity for rational thought.”Luckily there were other people climbing, helping each other out. Sometimes just encouraging words, sometimes a hand to hoist someone up, sometimes pushing someone’s backside to help them over a difficult climb.I hit my shins and knees several times, and there where several blood spots on my pants once I reached the top of this difficult section. At the top of the spur, the trail reaches the Tablelands, a fairly flat area on the shoulder of the mountain. The summit is covered in clouds, and the views from up here are amazing. I can hundreds of lakes and ponds amongst the trees to the south, like many many mirrors on green velvet. I can even see last night’s campground from up here, and where my tent was.Now a mile on this plateau, the trail slowly climbing. It gets steadily windier and eventually I climb into the clouds, my jacket flapping in the wind. I stop for a quick snack and push on.Now half a mile from the end and the trail starts climbing steeply up Baxter Peak. The wind picks up to gale force, burning my bare hands (I really wish I had had gloves) and is so loud I have to shout to be heard by descending hikers.Than I see the sign materialize through the clouds in front of me. The sign that marks the end of the 2193.1 mile trail, the end of 5 months of walking and 28 years of dreaming. For a couple minutes I am actually alone on the summit, just a patch of rocky land with a sign and a 13 foot cairn in an endless sea of clouds. Then a couple of hikers show up; we take each others’ pictures and I start back down.The climb back down is incredibly hard on my knees, which have taken quite the beating through New Hampshire and Maine. The rough spots on the trail are easier going down than going up though. Areas where I had to pull myself up with my hands I can now scoot down on my butt. I take it very slow on the way down, I don’t want to spend the evening celebrating in a hospital with broken bones. It takes three and a half hours, the same time it took to climb, to reach the base of the mountain.My original plan had been to get a shuttle to the nearby town of Millinocket, spend the night, take another shuttle to the town of Medway, take a bus from there to Bangor, and from there take Greyhound and Amtrak home. A fellow thru-hiker, Wanderer, was kind enough to offer a ride on his shuttle directly to Bangor. We split the cost of the ride and a couple of hours later found ourselves at a motel outside of Bangor Airport.Dinner was at a Ground Round next door. All you can eat ribs and a dessert sampler left me happily beyond full. By 8 o’clock we were falling asleep in our room at the motel. I found it crazy to think that just 24 hours ago I was at a campsite in northern Maine, with that final climb still in front of me.
Happiness is, well right now, everything is happiness.","Abol Bridge Campground
