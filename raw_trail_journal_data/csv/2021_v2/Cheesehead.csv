Cheesehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633468,"I worked diligently at cutting base weight.  I bought a new Hyperlight Mountain Gear backpack which cut at least 2 pounds. I shed all the ""nice to haves"" and kept the ""have to have"" items.  Since I will be hammock camping and it will rain, probably a lot, I got a new DCF tarp with storm doors from Hammock Gear.  This tarp is lighter weight than my usual tarp and has some added weather protection.  I practiced setting up the tarp and hammock kit. I dehydrated a lot of my own food. I bought commercial backpacking food. I added vitamins to supplement my food supply. I added a wool base layer to my clothing.  I studied my maps, Appalachian Trail guide, Awol's guide, and internet sources.  Much to my son's (Bird Whisperer) consternation I met some random person on the internet and we agreed to hike Georgia together.  I registered my hike with the Appalachian Trail coalition. The coalition was discouraging hikers for yet another year (covid). I unregistered my hike. I bought a used Jeep. I packed my backpack and filled up the Jeep. I left for Georgia.",,View Entry,"Mar 02, Tue",0
Cheesehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633486,"I got a late start because of packing my 5 week dehydrated food supply.  This time I headed east on I-10 out of Houston.  Usually I head west towards Van Horn, Texas and the Guadalupe Mountains, or Lordsburg, New Mexico, and the Continental Divide Trail. The refinery views of Baytown in the rearview mirror, I made good time through Beaumont and then I got to Orange, sometimes pronounced urnj.  Google routed me around Orange randomly a few times, trying to avoid a slowdown on the highway.  I drove through a couple of fish camps. Thanks Google. Eventually I gave up and sat for an hour in the traffic jam.  I thought about stopping in Lafayette, Louisiana for dinner but I was afraid I would run into people I knew in a bar and then I would be there for hours and wake up somewhere far from Georgia with a hangover.  I disciplined myself to keep driving.  As I came through New Orleans I called my son Bird Whisperer to make me a reservation in Biloxi, Gulfport, or Pascagoula, Mississippi. The only hotels still available were either really high end or really low end.  I kept going to Mobile, Alabama. I pulled into the Holiday Inn around midnight.  I got a room on the weed smoking floor, which I didn't ask for.  Waffle House never looked so good as it did the next morning.  I made it to Hiawassee, Georgia the next day.  Late in the afternoon I attempted to access the Forest Service road to the parking lot by Springer Mountain.  I took the wrong turn, which I should have known from the last time I took the same wrong turn,  and ended up at Nimblewill Gap.  On the way down I made 50 new friends in a Jeep Club convoy out night running that were coming up the road.  Back in Hiawassee, I stayed at the cleanest Holiday Inn I have ever seen.  I intended meeting my internet hiking partner the following morning.  I loaded up on carbs and fat at Taco Bell.",,View Entry,"Mar 12, Fri",0
Cheesehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633490,"My internet hiking partner and her friend picked me up in Hiawassee.  The Holiday Inn graciously allowed me to leave my car in their back parking lot. We made a stop at Mountain Crossings at Neel Gap for me to leave a 4 day food supply box.  We drove to the Forest service parking lot on FR 42.  The Forest Service parking lot was full and cars lined the road in both directions. The weather was pleasant, warm, and sunny.  The three of us had a nice 2 mile out and back to the Appalachian Trail plaque on Springer Mountain.  I felt so free; I was carrying only my phone for the photo op at the official start of the Appalachian Trail.  Back at the parking lot my new hiking partner and I put on backpacks and headed for Hawk Mountain shelter campground. Later I heard from an Appalachian Trail Coalition ridge runner that there were 40 people stuffed into Hawk Mountain shelter that night. We arrived at dusk. I set up my  hammock a little uphill from my hiking partner's tent.  As I cooked dinner, I discovered I forgot a spoon, so I borrowed one.  Borrowing spoons would be my plan until I reached Neel Gap and the store at Mountain Crossings.  Or else I would have to carve myself a pair of chopsticks or try my hand at whittling a spoon.  I had homemade chicken and rice pilaf for dinner.  It was surprisingly good, even if a little bland.","Springer Mountain

Cheesehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633507,"We started hiking northbound (NOBO) from Hawk Mountain shelter campground.  We met a man and his two sons from north Mississippi. We leap frogged them for a while.  The man was having trouble keeping up with his sons, and I was having trouble keeping up with my hiking partner.  So I hiked with the man for a while,  and the sons and my internet hiking partner hiked ahead faster. I slipped coming down Horse Gap and got a giant bruise on my arm. We met a ridge runner from the Appalachian Trail coalition who was putting out fires left still burning by campers, giving leave no trace education sessions at shelters, and answering trail questions.  I filtered water at Justus Creek where the man and his sons made camp.  I hiked alone for the rest of the day and got to Gooch Mountain shelter by dark. I hung my hammock near the shelter. Again, I borrowed a spoon. There was a little rain on my tarp that night.  The shelter, both the main floor and the loft were packed.","Hawk Mountain Shelter

Cheesehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633508,"I had breakfast on the picnic table at Gooch Mountain shelter with Baby Trotter and Sam.  I borrowed Baby Trotter's spoon.  Baby Trotter is more or less thru hiking while waiting on orders from the Air Force. Sam is a vegan and was cooking up a breakfast swill of lentils, herbs, chia seeds, and coconut oil.  It looked like something the dog coughed up on the back porch. I hiked alone most of the day.  I leap frogged with a man and his daughter, Pooch and Echo, from Dallas.  It was nice to meet some friendly Texas people and hear Texas accents.  Especially after my internet hiking partner, not unkindly, corrected my pronunciation of the trail.  ""Appal-ah-chian"" not ""Appal-ay-chian"" (Hermione Granger: Wingardium leviOsa, not leviosAH). I hung my hammock with Pooch and Echo at a primitive camp just before Lance Creek. I made a critical error in my tarp's ridge line. I did not add drip loops. Therefore, my ridgeline acted like a wick.  It rained all night.  The ridgeline wick dripped on me all night.  Everything got wet; hammock, sleeping bag, woobie hoodie, under quilt, and quilt protector.  I borrowed Pooch's spoon.  Pooch invited me to the Texas Hang.","Gooch Mountain Shelter

Cheesehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633511,"Wet stuff is heavier.  I headed out of Dan Gap ahead of Pooch and Echo but they passed me pretty quickly.   I was headed for Neel Gap but a really bad weather front was moving in. It rained all day.  I was not looking forward to the climb up Blood Mountain late in the day in the rain.   On the advice of two day hikers, I headed to Woods Hole shelter.  They said it was about half a mile off the trail and in this weather everyone who could was getting off the mountain.  I would probably have the shelter to myself.  I got a text from my internet hiking partner, whom I hadn't seen for two days, that she was wet and cold and going home.  I met Grace on the trail and repeated the information from the day hikers about Woods Hole shelter.  On the way to the shelter I filtered water from a small stream. It took forever. I imagine this stream is either a seep or dry in hotter weather.  I got to Woods Hole shelter in light rain. Grace is a political scientist from Michigan.  She had passed me earlier and was already  at the shelter. We thought we would have the shelter all to ourselves.  I hung wet clothes and wet hammock gear up around the shelter, hoping for it to dry.   It rained harder.  We waited for a lull in the rain to make a run to the bear box or the privy.  Then Logan, a chef from Florida, arrived.   He was cold and wet and had some nasty looking blisters.  His sleeping bag was wet.  I gave him the SOL bivy I had cannibalized for my quilt protector to put inside his sleeping bag.  Tyler, an Army medic from North Dakota, arrived just as full dark was setting in, in the pouring rain. Tyler's trail name is Flame Thrower, and after he set up his stove I could see why.  We discovered we were all hammock campers.   Flame Thrower and Grace hung three of our hammock tarps around the open sides of the shelter. The tarps kept the worst of the wind and rain out of the shelter. My cousin, trail name Gonzo, called to warn me about the major bad weather storm system blowing through.  I know, I'm looking at it.  I borrowed a spoon from Logan.  My internet hiking partner texted me about the weather and to get a shuttle out.  Not so easy four miles from the road.  The four of us talked about trail plans, food, gear, how wet our stuff was, blister treatment and knee injuries.  Then I learned way more about manscaping than I ever wanted to know. I laughed. It was a frog drowner outside.  I slept in a SOL bivy in a wet sleeping bag on top of a wet under quilt on top of a wet quilt protector, hoping my body heat would cook off some of the wetness in my sleeping bag.  I woke up momentarily to hail on the metal roof of the shelter.   I went back to sleep to rain.  It was cold.","Dan Gap
",Woods Hole Shelter,"Mar 17, Wed",5.50
Cheesehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633515,"In the morning everything was still wet and cold. I ate Greenbelly bars instead of cooking a hot breakfast. We scolded ourselves for not having the forethought to set up drip lines and water collection pots last night. Grace made a run to the stream for water to filter.  I made a run to the bear box for our food.   We debated the merits of taking a zero day at Woods Hole shelter or pushing on up and over Blood Mountain to Neel Gap and sharing a cabin.  We waited out more rain.  Around 1 p.m. we headed up Blood Mountain, a supposedly difficult climb and descent.   The climb was long and continuous, but not difficult. The  descent was steep, rocky, and in some places it was hard to read the trail markers.  There was mud to slog through and wet, slippery rocks. I walked through streams flowing down the mountain from the recent rains. The view from top of Blood Mountain was worth the climb.  There was a rock shelter at the top. I was glad I hadn't spent the night there. It looked cold and wet and uninviting.  Later I heard 20 cold, wet hikers were crammed in that shelter last night.  Flame Thrower had a car near Neel Gap, so the four of us rode to Misty Mountain Inn and Cottages to warm up, clean up, and dry out.  We stopped on the way for real food (pork bbq).","Woods Hole Shelter

Cheesehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633540,"The day started with such promise.   A stop at a gas station for a chicken fried steak, egg, and cheese biscuit had me loving north Georgia even more.  Then on to the Mountain Crossings store at Neel Gap.  I bought a spoon, two new tent stakes, 50 feet of paracord, and three AAA batteries. Sticker shock made me not buy rain pants for $110.  For that much I will just get wet.  I collected my resupply box of 4 days supply of food.  The trail goes right through the building at Mountain Crossings.  I walked through the breezeway in the building with my pack now eight pounds heavier, and began the climb up Levelland Mountain.  I saw a few people I had met earlier on the trail.  The weather was glorious! Cold and blue skies.  There were a few primitive campsites on the way up.  I stopped at one where I learned, from one of the other occupants, not personal experience, how many times in one day you can have diarrhea if you failed to filter or treat your drinking water.  The answer is 30 to 35ish depending on how you count the diarrhea equivalent of dry heaves.  After that enlightening discussion I was happy to hike alone.  Then I met a man who lurked in my periphery for the rest of the day.   From him I learned how to scam the workers comp system.  He seemed overly interested in where I was going to camp that night.  From the top of Levelland Mountain you can see Atlanta on a clear day.  I met a person with the Georgia Appalachian Trail Club who was answering questions about the trail.  The Georgia Appalachian Trail Club is doing a lot of work on the trail as well as the Appalachian Trail Conservancy.  Picking up trash, putting out fires, answering questions about the trail, doing educational work, and generally checking trail conditions. Late in the day, I saw the first flowers of spring.  Tiny little purple flowers were visible along the trail on Green Cliff Top.  As I continued to pass my lurker, he continued to reassess his camp location for the night, and continued to follow me.  This situation seemed to be getting more sketchy by the mile.  I knew I wouldn't make it to the next shelter before dark.  Hoping to put some distance and at least a day between me and my hanger-on, I called Craig at Misty Mountain Inn & Cabins for a place to stay and a ride from Tesnatee Gap.  Craig couldn't pick me up until much later, so I asked some day hikers from Florida for a ride into town.  The Floridians had an RV and gave me a ride back to the Misty Mountain Inn on the RV's soft sofa.","Neel Gap

Cheesehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633687,"I started where the RV picked me up last night at Tesnatee gap.  There was no sign of yesterday's pest.  It was a long uphill climb up Wildcat Mountain.  Two thirds of the way up I could still see the road.  The tranquility of the forest is shared with the sounds of road rally car clubs and motorcycles, long after the road disappears from view.  I descended into Hog Pen Gap, crossed the road and climbed again to Wolfpen Stamp, and followed the ridge to Poor Mountain.  I stopped for lunch on a rock with a view and ate a dehydrated orange.  It was the best tasting thing!  It was nice to hike alone all day. I met nice people all day. Three boys came flying by me, literally running down the trail.  Soon after, their mother and another brother came along.  When asked if they were on spring break, they said, ""No, we're homeschooled and we're  going to Maine.""  They will remember this adventure for the rest of their lives.  Volunteers from Georgia Appalachian Trail Club are doing a great job of answering questions and giving information about trail conditions.  I reached Low Gap shelter and hung my hammock some ways away from the shelter.  My impression:  the shelter was full of college kids,  Vietnam War veterans, and some guy with dreadlocks. I had homemade pepper steak for dinner.  Barn owls serenaded me to sleep.","Tesnatee Gap

Cheesehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633695,"I think I saw Army Ranger underwear this morning. It was black, flimsy, very short, and had Ranger printed in gold on the left leg.  The Army's answer to Victoria's Secret; Ranger panties.  Sigh. I saw some things I did not ask to see.  My pace on the Appalachian Trail ranges from slowly gasping my way up every mountain, to slowly and carefully picking my way down every mountain, to my usual 2 mph on the 10 yards of flat trail I see everyday. The majesty of the north Georgia mountains is breathtaking.  I find my attitude changing from each climb being a chore to wondering what amazing view or interesting sight is around the next corner.  It might be a spring flower, or the bright, green, waxy leaves of holly, or a small waterfall.  Today I saw lots of downy woodpeckers. I met two volunteers from the Georgia Appalachian Trail Club who had helpful advice and a hilarious bear story to share.  The last two miles uphill before the Blue Mountain shelter were very rocky.  I saw quite a few of the same people as the night before at Low Gap shelter.  I haven't seen any bears yet. Fortunately every shelter has either a bear box or bear cables or both.  I'm keeping my food in a bearikade.","Low Gap Shelter

Cheesehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633697,"There was much discussion around the table at the Blue Mountain shelter about impending bad weather, the challenging climb up Tray Mountain, and enticements in the town of Hiawassee.  I mulled the idea of pushing on to Tray Mountain shelter and then to Dick's Creek Gap the next day.  These would be two difficult days in terms of mileage,  terrain,  and weather.  After picking my way down the stone staircase from Blue Mountain shelter to Unicoi Gap, a 2-1/2 mile descent of about 1000 feet, my knees were aching.  The looming 2500 foot ascent to Tray Mountain shelter lost its appeal.  Planning 6 or 7 miles per day depending on elevation change is working well for me.  More miles than that does not need additional weather challenges.  I opted for a shuttle into Hiawassee, a shower, real food, clean laundry, and a shopping trip to see if I can upgrade my underquilt to something warmer, get a new boot lace,  a few tiny carabiners to raise my mosquito net, and a replacement stove.  The MSR pocket rocket still works, but the auto ignition does not.  I might switch from the bearikade bear canister to an ursak bear bag to lighten the load a little.","Blue Mountain Shelter 
",Unicoi Gap,"Mar 23, Tue",2.40
Cheesehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633980,"At the hotel, packed with hikers sitting out bad weather, I saw a man wearing a plaid skirt.  It was a dreary brown hunting tartan.  I mentioned to the hiker with whom I was sharing a breakfast table, that I had seen many men from Scotland wearing proper kilts, but this looked more like a Goodwill variety of women's skirt.  My breakfast partner glanced over his shoulder and remarked that yesterday the same man was wearing a different plaid skirt, more like a Catholic schoolgirl plaid skirt.  At any rate, the plaid skirt was paired nicely with a pair of well worn hiking boots.  I took a shuttle to Unicoi Gap, where I left off a couple of days ago due to the weather. On the way, I stopped at Trailful, Hiawassee's outfitter for backpackers. I had a plan to purchase a rain jacket.  Being the only game in town Trailful is a little pricey.  I decided to check the free hiker box outside the store. I was in luck! There was a damp windbreaker, smelling slightly of the previous occupant's body odor and cologne.  Ureka! It fit and it was free. Thanks to whoever left a large, white Champion windbreaker.  After a couple more stops dropping off hikers, I finally started up the mountain at Unicoi Gap.  Almost 6 miles up I would find Tray Mountain shelter.  I had been warned about the climb up Tray Mountain.  Just when you think you are at the top, you aren't.  There are several false summits.  The weather was beautiful, sunny, and warm.  Groves of laurel trees were abundant.  I stopped for a late lunch at Indian Grave Gap, where I heard an owl hoot close by,  followed by an answering call. I headed up again, out of the gap.  I saw my first dandelion of spring.  I met a ridge runner from the Appalachian Trail Conservancy who advised that Tray Mountain shelter would be full because of impending rain.  I thought about stopping at a popular tent site called Cheese Factory, after an ancient dairy farm on the site, but passed it up in favor of pushing on to Tray Mountain shelter and its spring of fresh water.  I arrived at sunset and the shelter was not full. I hung my bear bag on the shelter's bear cables, set up my hammock at one of the tent sites, and fell asleep.","Unicoi Gap

Cheesehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633983,"The morning was foggy.  I expected rain and dressed accordingly.  It was so foggy on the trail, visibility was only about 50 feet.  It was going to be a long day to Deep Gap shelter.  Mid morning the sun burned off all the fog, it warmed up and I ditched the rain gear.  The weather was perfect for hiking.  No rain like the forecast. I sweated my way up mountains, and cooled off on the downhill treks to the gaps.  Streams were overflowing the trail from the recent rains. In a few places the trail was still wet, slick, and muddy. I met a sawyer crew from the Georgia Appalachian Trail Club doing trail maintenance.  They were three retired men, complaining about their many aches, pains and ailments, as they lugged a giant two person hand saw to clear the trail of a huge downed tree that was blocking the trail.  In designated wilderness areas, in this case the Tray Mountain Wilderness, volunteer trail maintenance crews can only use hand tools.  Power tools are prohibited.  We talked about the sawyer training the Forest Service provides to volunteers.   I left them to their hand sawing.  It seemed like many uphill climbs that day.  I arrived at the Deep Gap shelter with plenty of daylight left to hang my hammock and cook dinner.  The two level shelter was not full.  Rain and wind started around midnight.","Tray Mountain Shelter 
",Deep Gap Shelter ,"Mar 27, Sat",7.40
Cheesehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633985,"I stayed warm and dry all night.  My newly installed drip lines worked.  My new rain jacket did not stay dry because I hung it on the tarp ridgeline and it blew off in the wind during the night.  I packed up during a lull in the rain.  I skipped traditional breakfast of enhanced oatmeal and coffee, opting for some quick snack foods instead because I was trying to get off the mountain ahead of the rain.  As I was packing up, I saw some of the Appalachian Trail's most famous wildlife: shelter mice.  A woman who spent the night in the shelter was evicting mice from her backpack.  Two other shelter dwellers had abandoned the shelter and pitched a tent in the middle of the night because of mice running over them as they tried to sleep.  I was grateful for my mouse-free hammock.  I planned to take a shuttle from Dick's Creek Gap into Hiawassee.  Just after leaving the shelter, I saw a man hiking with an umbrella attached to his backpack.  I think this is a Zpacks or a Six Moons product, popular with CDT hikers as a sun shade.  About a half mile out from the Deep Gap shelter, the wind started blowing in from the southwest. Dark clouds threatened.  It looked like early evening it was so dark. The rain began in earnest.  Two hikers helped me pull my poncho over my pack.  Then the torrential rain started, followed by thunder and lightning.  I worried slightly about lightning as I crested a peak on my way to Dick's Creek Gap.  I met an Appalachian Trail Conservancy ridge runner, hiking with an umbrella, but not the high end Zpacks or Six Moons design, just an ordinary umbrella, checking on hikers and trail conditions.  I got to Dick's Creek Gap and no cell service. I hitchhiked into Hiawasssee.   A family gave me a ride in the bed of their pickup.  They asked me to lie down so they wouldn't get a ticket, which I did happily.  I had forgotten how much fun it is riding in the back of a pickup.

Cheesehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634191,"It was a glorious warm, sunny day for hiking.  Yesterday I bought a new rain jacket that fits and left my borrowed one in a hiker box.  Rain gear was safely stowed in my pack for tomorrow.  Along with my new rain jacket, I bought new boot laces because the attractive and color matching laces on my Vasque waterproof boots are failing.  Sadly, the replacement ones I bough don't fit through eyelets.  So my boot laces are repaired with various knots and duct tape.  I'm starting to look like a real hiker.  I left my Jeep at Dick's Creek Gap and started the climb northbound, intending to stay at Plum Orchard shelter for the night.  The trail glittered like someone had thrown handfuls of fairy dust along the path. It looked magical,  especially where new spring flowers were emerging next to bright green moss.  In reality the fairy dust was mica flakes weathered from the plentiful mica schist that forms the rock foundation of the trail.  Then I made a new trail friend.  I heard a slight rustle in the dry, dead leaves, and looking in the direction of the noise, I saw a snake. She was a harmless Queen snake, and posed regally for pictures. I met the last volunteer from the Georgia Appalachian Trail Club, checking on the trail conditions, shelters, and hikers.  I made it to Plum Orchard shelter by late afternoon, hiking about 1 mile per hour.  I set up my hammock at one of the campsites near the shelter.  Plum Orchard shelter has the reputation for being the nicest shelter in Georgia and that reputation is well deserved.  It has three levels, the main level, a loft over the main level, and a loft over the picnic table, and lots of sturdy pegs for hanging packs. It was not particularly crowded, as lots of people were getting off the trail because of impending rain and cold.   The shelter denizens were the usual mix of college kids, Air Force veterans, and a guy with a man bun.  Also sharing the shelter was a miniature doberman pinscher.  A Jack Russell terrier shared a tent nearby at one of the shelter's tent sites.  The Jack Russell barked at the miniature doberman late into the night, well past hiker midnight (9 p.m.), annoying exhausted hikers in tents, hammocks, and the shelter alike.","Dick's Creek Gap

Cheesehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634194,"The rain started at 3 a.m. or at least that's when I awakened to rain drops on my tarp.  The recently installed drip lines, fabricated from a piece of old paracord I found hanging in a tree, are working as intended.  I stayed warm and dry all night, even in heavy rain.  I packed up under the tarp so all my gear stayed dry, and put on all my rain gear, rain pants, rain jacket, poncho,  and rain gloves over my warm gloves. I ate a cold breakfast since I was worried about running out of fuel.  I headed out in the rain for the northern border of Georgia, leaving a few people behind in the Plum Orchard shelter who were planning to wait out the rain.  There were some steep climbs ahead and I was glad I hadn't tried to push to Bly Gap campground the night before.  When I got to Bly Gap, the Forest Service had posted no camping signs because of overuse of the area and relocated campsites to the top of the ridge, right in the wind and rain. It rained hard and steadily all day.  By midday my hands and wrists were starting to get wet.  I passed a sign on a tree designating the actual, legal North Carolina border. The trail in North Carolina was noticeably steeper and and less well maintained than Georgia, but every bit as rocky. In a couple places I had to crawl up boulders on my hands and knees, as the rocks were too steep for stepping up with hiking poles and boots.  I was just glad there wasn't any mud where I was crawling on hands and knees.  That would have been a sight!  At this point I was mostly dry.  The Zpacks rain mitts did not work, and my gloves underneath became steadily wetter.  I hoped they would dry overnight.  I came to the traditional border with North Carolina, a giant, gnarled oak tree.  A few more steep climbs and I came to Muskrat Creek shelter.  It looked wet and miserable and sad, especially after the luxury of Plum Orchard shelter.  There was trash in the privy and miscellaneous abandoned hiker gear lying around the shelter and privy.  The occupants of the shelter were already huddled in their sleeping bags at 6 p.m. and were rather unwelcoming.  I ate a quick dinner of cold rice and tuna fish.  The shelter had no bear box or bear cables.  I set my bear canister away from the shelter and hung my bear bag containing toiletries and a small amount of trash up in a tree.  It continued to rain sporadically.  I hung my wet gloves under my tarp, hoping they would be dry by morning.  I wore several layers to sleep in, knowing it was going to be near freezing tonight.","Plum Orchard Shelter

The valve on my air mattress was frozen shut.  It was impossible to deflate.  I rescued a piece of paracord from the hiker refuse in the shelter and a bungee cord from the trash pile in the privy and cobbled together a system for suspending the inflated air mattress to the outside of my pack.  I wore a pair of dirty, but dry, socks on my hands as mittens because the gloves were hopeless.  Another hiker, trail name Scream, from Florida, and I took off for Deep Gap as fast as we could, hoping not to miss the shuttle.  I was not sad to leave Muskrat Creek shelter and its sense of desolation and deprivation behind.  There was a pretty significant climb followed by a rocky descent out of Muskrat Creek.  Hoar frost lined the trail.  Yesterday's mud had turned to crunchy ice.  Wild flowers that bloomed the week before now sagged pitifully.  The rhododendrons looked wilted.  At one point I came to a small rocky cliff and stopped, wondering how do I get down that? I hoped I didn't have to take off my pack and lower it on a piece of paracord, followed by myself sliding feet first down on my stomach, clinging to rock ledges by my fingers.  I detected some switchbacks down the cliff, no wider than a hiking boot, and gingerly made my way down.  Scream followed and we celebrated a safe descent.  The trail remained frozen all the way to Deep Gap.  And no shuttle.  I called the shuttle that I had previously called for a ride, ""We're here at Deep Gap, where are you?"" He hadn't wanted to wait with the other hiker so he left.  He promised to come get us in an hour.  Scream and I paced for an hour trying to keep warm.  Then Zen showed up driving a white van, with the heat on, playing a Bob Dylan CD, with two friendly dogs for company.  We agreed to ride around with him to a few other trailheads while he pimped his shuttle and hiker hostel to more frozen hikers.  The van filled up with hikers and gear.  It was perfect!  A ride in a van with a guy named Zen and Bob Dylan on the stereo.","Muskrat Creek Shelter

The hike was an easy one mile through the forest with about 400 feet of elevation gain.  Something smelled spectacular.  I took a deep, cleansing breath and imagined what I smelled was sassafras.  I knew it was native to the area and what I smelled had the slightest whiff of root beer to it.  It was sweet, pleasant and pervasive.  I was surprised to see so much green foliage.  I had expected a lot of leaves to be turning yellow and brown in the middle of fall.  At least the understory, with its abundance of ferns, stayed vividly green.
We arrived at Standing Indian shelter and found it to be almost empty.  After seeing all those cars at Deep Gap parking and meeting no one on the trail, I was surprised the shelter wasn't full.  Maybe it was empty because acorns falling on the shelter roof were loud.  At the shelter, we met Sidewinder and his gorgeous labrador retriever, Shady.  They were sharing a tent right next to the shelter.  Because the shelter had no bear box or bear cables, Sidewinder hung his food high in a tree.  But Shady's dog food hung at clothesline level, more to keep Shady out of it than bears.  Another guy camped in a tent a little further away from the shelter.  We hung our hammocks behind the shelter, ate dinner, hung bear bags, and reviewed the day.","Deep Gap

Cheesehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645298,"Early in the morning I met the other person camping at Standing Indian shelter.  Wubba was a southbound thru hiker with only four or five days left in his hike. I was impressed.  He gave me an idea of what to expect northbound.  He said he hadn't seen any bears.
After breakfast we headed up to the top of Standing Indian Mountain, a strenuous 700 foot climb.  For much of the morning, the trail was shrouded in fog, with visibility only about 50 feet.  By the time we got to the top of Standing Indian Mountain, the sun had burned off some of the fog, and we got some lovely views across the valley.  Maple trees were just starting to turn a vivid red and a few beech trees were turning yellow amongst the otherwise green forest.
We cross numerous streams on the 1,000 foot descent from Standing Indian to Beech Gap.  The weather was warm and pleasant.  The upward climbs on the trail had me hot, sweaty, and breathing hard.  I fantasized about taking a dip in a pool of cold water in one of the streams.  Much to the benefit of other hikers, I did not remove my clothes and roll around naked in any stream next to the trail.  Instead I got my shemagh wet and wrapped it around my neck for a cooling effect, and later washing effect.
Just before Beech Gap, we met a southbound day hiker who warned us of problem bear activity between Carter Gap shelter and Betty Creek Gap.  Isn't that where we're camping tonight?  At Beech Gap I noticed the Forest Service had posted signs about bears in the area having learned to defeat the Pacific Crest Trail food hanging method, and advising hikers to use a bear canister.  This would have been good to know at the trailhead.  
Just after Beech Gap, I saw my first North Carolina Bear Sanctuary sign.  I suspected this is where Great Smoky Mountain National Park relocates its problem bears.  Staying vigilant, we hiked on towards Carter Gap, crossing more streams, and encountering lots of interesting mushrooms, but no bears.  A white Toothed Jelly (Pseudohydnum gelatinosum) fungus was the most interesting. It had a cold, wet, slimy, but firm texture.  Pink and orange Wolf's Milk slime molds (Lycogala epidendrum) were also fascinating, as well as Hoof fungus (Fomes fomentaius) and a few others I couldn't identify*.  Hoof fungus is famous for being the method the Alps Iceman used to carry around his embers.  Good to know if I ever need to carry fire from one place to the next.
We made it to Carter Gap shelter along a typical Appalachian Trail of ups and downs, tree roots and rocks.  Lots of people were camping near the shelter but to my surprise, no one was occupying the shelter itself.  My new hiking partner, who by now had earned the trail name Powder, for her liberal use of baby powder that left white streaks on her clothes, asked where we should hang our hammocks.
Me:  ""Oh, I'll just sleep in the shelter.  There's no one else here.""
Powder:  ""Are you crazy?  What about bears?""
Me:  ""Bears can rip apart a hammock or a tent just as easily as they can cruise through the shelter.  Besides, all my food, smellables, and trash will be hanging.""
After dinner, we had miraculous help from Hybrid Hiker in throwing our bear line over a very high tree branch.  I asked if he played major league baseball.  Our food was safe.  Powder opted to hang her hammock near Hybrid Hiker and his family, as it was easier for her to fall asleep listening to people talk.
Other than an acorn falling on the metal roof of the shelter, I slept soundly.  That acorn was so loud it almost sounded like a gunshot.  I heard some snuffling and grunting noises during the night, but I couldn't tell if it was a bear or the guy in the next tent snoring.*Thanks to my cousin, trail name Mushroom Phil, for the fungi identification.","Standing Indian Shelter

Cheesehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645305,"Today was a tough day, both in terms of distance, altitude, and trail conditions.  Today was Albert Mountain day.  As we hiked from Carter Gap up to Little Ridgepole Mountain we were rewarded with views of the Smoky Mountains poking through the clouds.  It was a long, but not difficult climb.  The trail in North Carolina is not as well maintained as the trail in Georgia.  We climbed over and under numerous deadfalls.
In some places the narrow trail perched along the side of a cliff, with a gravel Forest Service road far below.  Fortunately, trees and shrubs protruded from the cliff, arresting the fall of any unwary hiker.  We descended to Betty Creek Gap, still within the Standing Indian bear sanctuary, and still no sign of bears.  The trail continued on, up Bearpen Mountain, down to Bearpen Gap and across a Forest Service road.
After crossing the road, the trail started a steep ascent up Albert Mountain.  Then the fun began.  Towering above us were two enormous boulders with the white Appalachian Trail blaze painted on them.  I thought that didn't look too hard.  Powder and I stopped for some boulder pics for her.  At the top of the second boulder, the trail turned sneakily behind it and continued up a very steep scramble, up more rocks.  At times I was climbing with hands, feet, and knees, hiking poles dangling uselessly from my left wrist.  I looked back and down.  A backwards fall with a full pack would probably be fatal.  Just when I thought I had made it to the top, another turn in the trail, and there were more rocks to climb.  Some of them were wet and slippery with water and mud.  I was glad I hadn't had to make that climb in the rain, or worse, ice or snow.  Finally at the top, the Albert Mountain fire tower was right in front of us.
I groaned at the thought of climbing four flights of stairs to reach the observation deck of the fire tower.  I dumped my pack at the foot of the stairs.  Powder took my picture at the 100 mile marker painted on the tower stairs.  I mentally congratulated myself for having finished roughly 5% of the trail.  We climbed to the observation deck for 360 degree views of the surrounding mountains.  It seemed like the mountains stretched forever, undulating ribbons of green and blue in the distance with splotches of red, orange, yellow, brown, and gold in the foreground where deciduous trees were beginning to change color.  I flew down the steep, metal grating stairs of the fire tower, reminiscent of my days working on offshore platforms in the Gulf of Mexico.  Powder descended a little more slowly and carefully.
When we got to the bottom of the fire tower, two women were setting up camp in a flat tent spot and gathering wood for a campfire.  As we headed north towards Long Branch shelter, we met a family with young children, and a couple, coming up a short, easy, half mile trail to watch the sunset from the fire tower.  The trail towards Long Branch shelter was a mild descent over two miles.  We hurried to get there before dark.
We strolled into Long Branch shelter just at dusk.  Four women from Birmingham, Alabama, whom we had met earlier in the day, were staying on the main floor of the shelter.  We quickly hung the line for the bear bags and made dinner.  I admit Powder did most of the work getting the line for the bear bags set up.  She has a pretty good underhand throw with a rock to get the line over a tree branch.  My contribution was reflective paracord and a locking carrabiner to hold the bear bags.  
I opted to sleep in the loft of the shelter, since I had never done that before.  Powder didn't want to hang in her hammock alone, so she decided to try the loft too.  Being in a place on the trail, camping with only women was something unexpected and quite enjoyable.  It was interesting to hear the hiking stories and perspectives of the Birmingham ladies.","Carter Gap Shelter

Cheesehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645343,"Almost dawn.  Some slight stirring from the four ladies from Birmingham on the shelter floor below us.
Powder (whispering):  ""Do you hear a mouse chewing on something?""
Me (whispering):  ""No.""
Powder:  ""Are you sure?  I think I hear a mouse chewing on something.""
Me:  ""Maybe an acorn.  Somewhere.  It's not right next to my head so I think I'm ok.""
In the daylight, Long Branch shelter was the nicest I had seen in North Carolina.  There was a plaque on the inside saying the shelter had been built in 2012 with contributions from the Appalachian Trail Conservancy and labor from the Nantahala Hiking Club.
We lingered over a relaxing breakfast.  As we were getting ready to leave Long Branch shelter, a man and his dog arrived at the shelter.  The man was open carrying a 45 pistol on his hip.  I admired it and he said it was for personal bear protection in case his dog got off the leash and had an unfortunate bear encounter.  We talked about the current bear hunting season and how we had heard lots of gunshots yesterday and lots of dogs barking and howling.  Apparently dogs are used to hunt bears and the furious barking we heard was indicative of hunting dogs finding a bear or its scent.
We filtered water from a stream right after leaving the shelter.  We began a gradual descent to Glassmine Gap and Rocky Gap.  We had planned to eat lunch at Rock Gap shelter.  When we got there, we unloaded our packs at the picnic table and had a look at the shelter.  There was a noticeable roof leak that previous hikers had attempted to repair with duct tape.  Across one wall of the shelter was a third grade infomercial that described all the ways you could be killed while hiking the Appalachian Trail, complete with artistic renderings of hikers falling off cliffs, being bitten by snakes, and being crushed by falling tree limbs.  Missing from the dire display was giardia and hantavirus, but Lyme disease was featured along with a crayon drawing of a giant blood filled tick.
The trail had continuous ups and downs all day, but the general direction was down.  We followed a ridge from Rock Gap to Wallace Gap and finally down into Winding Stair Gap.  I was glad to see my jeep in the parking area where I had left it.  I was not glad when I tried to start it and found the battery to be dead.  A call to AAA got us a battery jump, KFC, and hotel rooms in Franklin for the night.","Long Branch Shelter

Cheesehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645377,"Today was a nero*, after chores at the laundromat and food resupply for Powder.  Our plan was to park at Winding Stair Gap and hike four miles to Siler Bald shelter.  With weather warnings of a cold front and rain coming in, I wanted to hike to any shelter and get situated in the warmest, driest spot before dark.
Shortly after the start of our hike, we crossed a stream and waterfall on a charming little footbridge.  We hiked upwards to a camping spot, also with a stream, and stopped for a snack and to fill up on water, just to be safe on our water supply.  As we sat on logs, eating our snack, two white tailed deer wandered along the nearby trail, seemingly unconcerned with nearby humans.
Siler Bald shelter is about half a mile off the Appalachian Trail and a 400 foot descent from the main trail.  It was only the two of us at the shelter, and with dusk approaching, it was unlikely anyone else would arrived.  Powder was not impressed.  She said it looked dark and creepy.  Ok, so it's a small, old shelter, definitely off the beaten path, kind of in a shady hollow, with marginal water sources, and a hard to find privy.  The privy is easier to find from the tent camping area than from the shelter.  On the positive side, there was a newish, Leave No Trace information poster on one wall.
Worried about bears, we hung our bear line from a tree branch.  I hung my solar lantern in the shelter.  Powder worked diligently to start a campfire in the fire ring near the shelter.  Once she got it going, it was pretty impressive.  Meanwhile, I set up my hammock as a bivy in the shelter.  Powder didn't want to hang her hammock by herself out at the campsite, so she hung it from the rafters inside the shelter.  I think she was silently appalled that I was going to sleep on the shelter floor.
Powder:  ""You're sleeping on the floor?""
Me:  ""Sure, why not?  That's what the shelter is for.""
Powder:  ""It's creepy.  It looks like serial killers use it for weekends away.  Do you think we'll see Brian Laundrie?""
Me:  No, Brian Laundrie is probably dead in some swamp in Florida.  Did you bring any bear spray?""
Powder:  ""I have some M80s and a lighter.""
I was secretly impressed with the inventiveness and enthusiasm of this approach.  We ate dinner near the campfire, with which I continued to be inspired.  Powder remained steadfast in renaming the Siler Bald shelter with the trail name of Serial Killer shelter.  I made hot chocolate and poured a shot of chocolate vodka in it from my Hyperlite Mountain Gear titanium flask, the vodka easing any sore feet complaints or worries about anything that might lurk near the shelter in the night.
After we hung our packs up on the hooks protected with beer can mouse deterrents, we grabbed the shelter log.  I looked through March and April of last spring to see if I recognized any names I hiked with in the spring.  We signed into the shelter log and howled with laughter at previous shelter dwellers comments about annoying bear encounters, and a certain Patient Zero's complaint and description in graphic detail of his week-long experience with diarrhea.
I smelled smoke from the campfire as I fell asleep.  Late at night, the wind picked up steadily and I knew the cold front and rain were coming.  A hard, prolonged rain fell on the metal roof of the shelter.  I slept soundly.

Cheesehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645379,"Powder:  ""Did you hear that giant tree branch fall on the roof last night?""
Me:  ""No. I must have slept through it.""
Powder: ""I don't know how you can sleep through all that rain, and wind, and acorns falling on the roof.  You were snoring.""
As we were contemplating our departure from the ""serial killer shelter"", two people appeared out of the remnants of the rain and the fog, looking lost.  They had taken a wrong turn looking for the Siler Bald trail, which leads to the Siler Bald overlook and view.  We said if they waited a minute for us to pack up, we would head back up the way they came and make sure they got to the right trail to Siler Bald.  They were young and fit day hikers.  They fairly ran back up the trail.  I struggled to keep up, the altitude forcing me into frequent rest stops.
Finally we reached the trail junction and pointed them in the right direction for Siler Bald and the view.  As we made our way northbound, we saw pairs and groups of day hikers headed eagerly and determinedly to Siler Bald.  Why, I wondered.  Siler Bald was completely fogged in.  After a couple of miles further down the trail, the sun came out and burned off the lingering fog.
At the Siler Bald trail junction I spotted another sign for the North Carolina bear sanctuary.  Still!?!  How big is this bear sanctuary?  Later I found out that we had transitioned from Standing Indian bear sanctuary to Wayah bear sanctuary.  About the only part of this area that is not a bear sanctuary is the narrow ribbon of asphalt and concrete that makes up US Highway 64.  
We hiked uphill most of the day, toward the Wayah Bald Tower, built in 1937 by the CCC, as a fire tower lookout.  The iconic stone tower is now on the National Historic Lookout Register.  As we neared the tower on the Appalachian Trail, we saw picnic tables, a paved parking lot, and families up at the tower enjoying the view. The morning fog and rain were completely gone, but a stiff wind was blowing in and temperatures were dropping.
As the trail descended toward Wayah shelter, we heard more gunshots and dogs barking, indicating more bear hunting.  A few people were camped around the shelter and Dave, a man from Mississippi, was sleeping in the shelter.  We hung our hammocks near the shelter, and set up our bear hang even further away.  Dave built a lovely campfire in the fire ring and Powder and I chatted with him while we cooked dinner.  He agreed with Powder that the previous shelter, Siler Bald shelter, was creepy.  He had taken one look at it and kept walking,  He was doing an impressive hike from Springer through Great Smoky Mountains National Park in three weeks.  I asked if he saw anything of the views as he was flying by.  He laughed and said eighteen to twenty miles per day wasn't that bad.
Thinking that it might get below freezing, I slept with my electronics and water filter.  Except for an occasional cold spot, I slept well.","Siler Bald Shelter

Me:  ""Why didn't you wake me up?  I would have given you my SOL bivy and a Nalgene filled with hot water.""
Powder:  ""You were snoring.  I didn't even think of the Nalgene.""
It was 36 degrees.  We contemplated where the best pick up point would be.  Powder wanted to backtrack to Wayah Tower.  I was not in favor of this plan since it would add two unnecessary bonus miles to my thru hike, be a mile uphill, and then we would have to wait on top of the bald for three hours in near freezing temperatures.  I wanted to continue northward eight miles to Tellico Gap, reasoning that it would take us about the same amount of time to hike to Tellico Gap as it would take for Powder's husband to drive there.  And we would stay reasonably warm while hiking.
We made haste toward Tellico Gap.  I hiked in my hoodie all day since it was a little chilly.  We descended to Licklog Gap, then back up to the top of the ridge, then back down to Burningtown Gap.  The trail was thickly carpeted with yellow beech leaves, red maple leaves, and brown oak leaves.  The leaves hid exposed tree roots, loose rocks, and little rolling sticks and acorns.
After a good climb, we stopped for lunch at Cold Spring shelter.  Built in 1933, Cold Spring shelter is historic.  It is three sided with exposed logs and has a log cabin feel to it.  There is an ice cold piped spring a few feet in front of the shelter.  I perused the shelter log book looking for old friends from this spring.  One entry described Cold Spring Shelter as a mouse hotel.  Powder saw a mouse run from the shelter floor to a safe space under the shelter.
After lunch we had a slight ascent to Copper Ridge Bald and its lovely views of the Great Smoky Mountains ahead.  Then there was a prolonged and significant descent to Tellico gap.  We beat Powder's husband by about ten minutes.  It was still cold.
Back at my jeep at Winding Stair Gap, I headed to Charlotte to visit my daughter, trail name Hello Kitty, and her fiance, Why Him.","Wayah Shelter

Cheesehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648651,"Last night I met my hiking partner from last October, trail name Powder, at Nantahala Outdoor Center.  This morning we planned to slack pack almost 8 miles from Tellico Gap to Nantahala Outdoor Center.  We started the trail in the snow.  I was trying out a couple of new pieces of equipment; a down skirt and a day pack from CrateClub.
As I parked my truck at Tellico Gap, a couple came back from their early morning day hike with their very happy dog.  He was a medium sized lab mix whose bottom half was covered with black mud.  He wiggled with doggie glee and excitement as they tried to towel off as much of the mud as possible before letting him back in their car.  It was a harbinger of the hike to come.
We hiked uphill 1.4 miles to the Wesser Fire Tower.  We thought it was a difficult and strenuous climb.  But it was only just over a mile.  There was a couple with two chocolate labs resting by the fire tower.  We dropped our packs and climbed the tower and were awed by the amazing views of Clingman's Dome about 50 miles to the north. 
The trail was mostly downhill for the next 6.5 miles from the fire tower.   We met more people with dogs.  There were some friendly spaniel type dogs that passed us.  We met local day hikers and a few thru hikers, including a man from Switzerland.  The downhill was starting to take its toll on our knees.
The snow melted and the trail became muddy in places. The down skirt was beginning to get a little warm but I didn't want to take it off and hike in just fleece tights, a little too revealing.  Good thing I left it on as up the trail rampaged two yellow labs who jumped on me and covered me with muddy pawprints.  Their owner eventually showed up and called them, but they preferred to stay and play exuberantly with me and Powder.  The older lab even grabbed my arm with her teeth, ""Pay attention to me!""  We eventually disentangle ourselves from the yellow labs and continued downhill, muddy and covered with pawprints and dog slobber.
On the downhill trek we came to a tricky rock section that required careful placement of hiking boots and poles.  A glance over the side of the rocks showed a sheer dropoff.  The view was spectacular, if a tiny bit scary.  Our knees were starting to ache with each step downhill, from rock to mud to tree root.
The first flowers of spring were starting to bloom.  Violets emerged along the sides of the trail.  We crossed Wesser Creek on some treacherous rocks.  The creek was flowing nicely in case we needed water, but we had enough.
We decided to have a late lunch and snacks at Wesser shelter.  I had brought some tuna packs for lunch, but discovered I fogot my spoon so I ate everything else I brought (trail mix, freeze dried okra, and a dehydrated half pineapple with chocolate).  If I got desperate I supposed I could squeeze the tuna up to the edge and lick it off the packet.  At Wesser shelter we met Half Shell, a man from Virginia's eastern shore who worked on an oyster farm, and his lovely dog Indie, a husky pitbull mix.  Wesser shelter had an unappealing privy with its door removed (by the Forest Service as covid mitigation???) in full view of everyone at the shelter.  There is absolutely no logical or scientific explanation for removing privy doors to stop the spread of covid.  It comes off as some kind of weird and pointless covid cult ritual.
After that tasty pineapple and okra lunch we kept going endlessly downhill.  We crossed a stream that some enterprising hiker had strategically placed a leaf to enhance water collection.  My feet were starting to hurt.  I was starting to dislike my day pack.  I decided it was designed for a man and more suitable for carrying large quantities of ammunition than day hiker gear.  My son, trail name Bird Whisperer, will love it.
We passed the Rufus Morgan shelter without stopping.  It looked about half full and one tent was set up outside.  It was an attractive looking shelter and camping area.  By now one of my feet felt like three toes were on fire.
We made our way down the rest of the trail to Nantahala Outdoor Center to Powder's jeep.  We went to retrieve my truck at Tellico Gap. By the time we got back to Nantahala Outdoor Center the restaurant was closed and we settled for making soup at our hotel room at The Lodge.  It had been a long day, a long hike, and we ended it with aching feet and knees.","Tellico Gap

Cheesehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648751,"Powder and I got a late start.  We shuttled her jeep to a parking area near Fontana dam.  The visitor center at the dam was closed.  We wandered around for about half an hour unsuccessfully asking about parking before we finally settled on parking at the marina.  There is a restroom and place to print back country permits at the marina.  There were a few rather unfriendly and full of themselves hikers hanging around, waiting for a shuttle to the Fontana resort.  We decided to let them hike their own hike, parked, and left.
We drove my truck back to the Nantahala Outdoor Center and lingered over a French toast breakfast.  We started the climb out of NOC late, with seven miles uphill to go before we would come to a shelter.  I had switched to Vasque hiking boots and my feet hurt less than yesterday.
The trail was steep, rocky, and it was exhausting to make the relentless uphill climb.  A stone bench beckoned the weary hiker along the trail.  In some places the trail was a stone staircase.  We passed an area used as a campsite and looked longingly at it.  Trees for a hammock - check.  A spring nearby for water - check.  Fire ring - check.  Logs to sit on - check.  Suitable trees for hanging bear bags - check.  Interesting rock formation with small caves good for a bear's ground den, oh no!  Keep walking!
Still going uphill, we found another use camp (unofficial campsite) at mile 140.  We hung our hammocks with plenty of daylight left.  Powder started a nice campfire which I used to boil water for dinner after my fuel cannister ran out.  There was a slight rain during the night, necessitating tarps over the hammocks.  Bear bags were hung and bear canisters were put a safe distance away.  I slept comfortably.","Nantahala Outdoor Center

It was another difficult day all uphill to Sassafras Gap shelter.  I gasped and sweated uphill.  Powder was patient. 
We arrived early at Sassafras Gap shelter and had option to continue another 1.5 miles uphill to Cheoah Bald and camp up there or stay at shelter and socialize.  We opted for staying at the shelter and enjoying the hiker community.  We saw Half Shell and the beautiful Indie, but they soon departed to camp at either Cheoah Bald or Locust Cove further north on the trail.
I decided to sleep in the shelter and Powder hung her hammock in the bear hang graveyard, an area where the tree limbs are festooned with lines of paracord and carabiners that are stuck from unsuccessful bear bag hangs.  
A man set up his tent next to Powder's hammock and hung his bear bag right over her hammock.  She was not happy.  After we finished hanging our food in bear bags away from everyone's tents and the shelter, we put our bear canisters in a slight depression uphill from Powder's neighbor's tent.  We reasoned that when the bears started playing with the bear canisters, they would roll like bowling balls downhill into her neighbor's tent.
I slept in the shelter loft with a woman from Georgia, trail name AT Positive, who was sobo and picking up her last few section hike miles to complete the trail.  A young man from Canada also shared the loft with us.  We gave him the trail name Maple Leaf.

The rest of the trail was a steep downhill descent.  We climbed over lots of fallen trees.  Our knees and feet were starting to really hurt, so we decided to bail out at Stecoah Gap and spend the night at The Lodge near NOC.
We heard from other hikers that supposedly Tellico Gap to Fontana is most difficult section of the Appalachian Trail except for the White Mountains of New Hampshire.  Our knees and feet felt like that might be true.

Oh happy day!  There was trail magic at the picnic tables at the Stecoah Gap trailhead parking.  A man was giving away apples and oranges and  some other people were giving away sodas.  Fresh food and a cold soda is like heaven to hot, sweaty hikers who have been living off of dehydrated food and filtered water for days.  I took an apple.  As we were leaving I picked a second apple up off the ground in the parking lot.
The trail today was a surprise.  There were the usual tree roots, rocks, and fallen trees to climb over, but the ups and downs didn't seem as severe as previous days.  Maybe the condition known as trail legs was coming on.  Trail legs are the strengthening of one's legs from walking all day and then doing it again the next day, and the next, and the next.
As we hiked we saw the woman from England and Grandmaster* from Amsterdam again.  There were many foreign visitors thru hiking the trail.  I pondered the difference between those that choose to see America from a 2,000 mile hiking trail and those that choose to just visit New York or Los Angeles.  
We finally, after 8 some miles, got to Cable Gap shelter at sunset.  We quickly hung the bear bag and hammocks.  Cable Gap shelter is small and old.  It was built in 1939 by the CCC and appears to have the original roof.  Moss grew on some of the roof shingles.  It holds six hikers, probably ten in bad weather.  It's charm is the log cabin style and huge fire ring in front of the shelter.  
There were many tents and hammocks pitched around the shelter, on tent pads, and up the hillsides.  I counted 23.  There are no picnic tables, benches or shelves for cooking.  I went to the fire ring to cook dinner but it seemed like the people in the shelter were already asleep so I quietly ate a pack of tuna and left.  As I was eating the tuna, I heard a couple in one of the tents across the stream and uphill from the shelter having sex, including a rather loud orgasm.  I snickered.  Hiker porn.  I didn't ask to hear that.
I moved back near my hammock for the rest of my dinner.  I told Powder about the lack of a picnic table anywhere so we just sat down in the middle of the trail and ate a cold dinner by full moonlight.  I had the apple that had been shoved in the back of my pack and some more tuna.  I wondered where the other apple was or if I had dropped it along the way. As we ate, a couple more hikers arrived by headlamp.  The night was cool but not uncomfortably cold.

Cheesehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648977,"I woke up in the Irish section of the Cable Gap shelter campground.  The man to the left of my hammock was from Dublin, the man to my right also from Dublin, and the woman across from me was from Belfast.  The woman from Belfast, trail name Giggles, gave me an orange from her trail magic stash that she didn't want to carry.  Another neighbor, trail name Stork, who looked exactly like a stork, joined in the morning conversation about Ireland.
Powder and I packed up for the journey north.  I found the missing apple in the fanny pack with my wallet and car keys that I slept with.  So much for keeping food away from bears.  I ate the apple.
As we hiked downhill all day, we had many views of Fontana Dam, a World War 2 era Tennessee Valley Authority project.  We crossed multiple streams, flowing nicely from the recent snowmelt.  Red and white trillium were starting to show, as well as violets,  rue-anemone, thymeleaf bluet, dwarf cinquefoil, and sweet betsy.  Various mosses turned hillsides bright green.
We arrived at Fontana marina, picked up Powder's car and drove to Stecoah Gap to retrieve mine.  We said goodbye at The Lodge near NOC.  Powder went back to her family in North Carolina and I waited to pick up two of my adult children near Gatlinburg.  I did various camp chores and organized equipment.  I went to do my laundry and saw a hiker wearing a big, black, trash bag in the laundromat.  All of his clothes were in the washer.","Cable Gap Shelter

Cheesehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649508,"Yesterday I picked up my oldest daughter, trail name Hello Kitty, and my son, trail name Bird Whisperer, at Newfound Gap.  Hello Kitty left her jeep at Newfound Gap and we drove to The Lodge near NOC to get organized and spend the night.
We were first in line for brunch at NOC and ate as much as we thought was wise to sustain us for the climb from Fontana Dam up to Birch Spring camp.  Five miles of the hike would be uphill.
We arrived at Fontana Dam to find the road across the dam closed.  We parked at a popular picnic spot and hiked across the dam, which added a bonus mile to the hike.
After the dam and a little bit of paved road, the trail entered the forest.  I dropped my thru hiker permit in the box at the beginning of the trail at the southernmost point of Great Smoky Mountains National Park.  The weather was cool and sunny.
It was a tough day uphill for me and Hello Kitty.  Bird Whisperer, now shortened to Birdie, seemed unaffected.  He griped about the slow progression uphill.
We met a Ridge Runner from the Appalachian Trail Conservancy who advised us that shelters and campsites were mostly full.  Birdie and Hello Kitty had paid reservations at campsites and shelters and were thus entitled to ask thru hikers without reservations to move.  We explained that we were hammock camping and didn't need to ask anyone to leave a tent site.  The Ridge Runner also explained that the National Park Service had relaxed the camping near the shelter rules to allow for social distancing. 
We got to Birch Spring camp around dusk and set up hammocks and tarps.  Hello Kitty was so exhausted she got in her hammock and zero degree sleeping bag and promptly fell asleep.
Birch Spring camp is spread out with tent sites on the hillsides surrounding the area where the old shelter was.  Now there is just a fire ring there.  A spring runs through the middle of the site. Birdie and I ate a quick dinner at the fire ring and hung bear bags on bear cables.  It started to sprinkle.","Fontana Dam 
",Birch Spring Camp,"Apr 17, Sun",6.20
Cheesehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649509,"We awoke to light rain on the tarps and fog so thick visibility was about 50 feet.  Wet stuff is heavy stuff to carry.  We packed up with the wet stuff in the outside pack pockets, hoping for the forecasted warm and sunny weather.  Birdie and Hello Kitty immediately commenced bickering as we headed out on the trail. 
I put on rain pants, rain gloves, and my rain jacket.  I knew there would be mud if not puddles from last night's rain.  It rained all day, consistently,  but not hard.  If it wasn't raining on us we were hiking inside a cloud and it dripped on us constantly.  Birdie complained about the weather.
The trail was muddy with numerous blowdowns.  Birdie bitched about trail conditions. We came to one blowdown that was ominous.  A tree or several had fallen over and blocked the trail with a huge pile of logs.  It looked like something from an Army obstacle course.  I saw where some previous hikers had attempted going uphill and around the root ball.  When I tried that, I merely slid slowly backwards, the Vibram soles of my hiking boots leaving equally spaced grooves in the mud.  Meanwhile Birdie had climbed up and over the log pile.  He urged me to take off my pack and pass it over the top of the log pile.  After one step up on the logs I thought that was a good idea and removed my pack and passed it over.  I climbed the log pile and went down the other side uneventfully.   Meanwhile, Birdie was giving his sister a helping hand over the logs. 
Then Hello Kitty took a slow slide into the mud.  Birdie tried to help her up but that just prompted another slip and roll in the mud.  Birdie and I laughed uproariously. I held my sides and wiped away tears. I thought I might pee.  Birdie howled with laughter.  Amidst this unsympathetic display of family disloyalty, another hiker (T-hug) emerged out of the fog and stared at two of us laughing and one of us sitting in the mud.  T-hug nimbly and elegantly climbed and descended the log pile without any adjustments to pack, poles, or footing.  He continued to look askance at us.
Hello Kitty:  ""That's it!  I need a new trail name. I'm not going to sound like a stripper anymore.""
Me (unhelpfully):  ""How about Miss Piggy?""
Birdie:  ""Mudslide?  Mud Cat? Mud Kitty? Mud puddle? Muddy?  Mud Dog? M-dawg?""
Hello Kitty (to Birdie):  ""How about I change your trail name to Shut Up Bitch?""
And this is how Hello Kitty changed her trail name to Forest Cat.  T-hug introduced himself as a local Tennessee man on his second attempt to thru hike.  He had gone to college in Chattanooga and was very familiar with the trails in the Smokies.  He graciously acknowledged Forest Cat's new trail name and gave us information about the trail ahead.  Then he disappeared northbound into the fog.
The weather continued to be horrible.  The temperature was dropping.  I worried about Forest Cat.  Her down jacket (puffy) was getting wet, and soon it would be wet and cold.  She put on a poncho.  She slipped in the mud two more times before changing out of athletic shoes and into hiking boots.  Birdie complained about the weather, his sister's shoe choices, the slowness of the pace, the mud, the trail conditions, how cold it was getting.  The wind picked up.  I heard bickering and ""Shut Up Bitch"" behind me as I hiked a little ahead.  Every uphill stretch was a physical challenge for me, but fortunately there weren't any terribly steep inclines on this stretch of trail.
We arrived at Mollies Ridge shelter and were delighted to see a fire burning in the fireplace.  An assortment of shoes, boots, and socks were propped around the fire to dry or were hanging from the rocks that made up the chimney.  Ubiquitous government warnings about covid and social distancing were posted by the National Park Service.
Birdie started to set up his hammock in the wind and rain. But I convinced him the weather was going to get worse and to grab a spot in the shelter.  We picked three spots on the lower level and crammed our sleeping bags together.  We huddled by the fire trying to stay warm.
I saw Stork and his girlfriend from Cable Gap shelter.  I opened two boxes of fudge I had in my food bag and asked him if he had a knife would he please cut it and distribute it around.  
I saw Kapow, a hammock mentor from the hike between Tellico Gap and NOC.  He was lamenting that the weather was so bad he would have to sleep in the shelter. The winds howled, the rain came in sheets, and the temperature dropped.  I distributed water filters and electronics among the three of us to sleep with so as not to freeze.
Around hiker midnight (9 p.m.) two people came into the shelter and quietly asked if anyone could make room for them.  People shifted over and they squeezed in.  Much later, around 10:30 or 11, a man came into the shelter swearing and crying.  He could not believe the shelter was full.  I couldn't believe a full shelter was a surprise considering the weather.  He was wet and cold and in the beginning stages of hypothermia.  Someone moved over for him.  Someone gave him an emergency bivy.  Someone else got up and built the fire up for him and sat him in front of it until he warmed up and his clothes started to dry.  Someone else fired up their stove and made him a hot drink.
We were packed like sardines in that shelter. It's official capacity is 12, but there were probably 22 people crammed in it.  Social distance this.","Birch Spring Camp
",Mollie's Ridge Shelter,"Apr 18, Mon",5.40
Cheesehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649533,"We woke up to frozen water bottles.  28F was the low overnight.  Tent campers waited for the sun to melt the ice on their tents.  The Garmin had an error message that it was too cold to use.  Birdie built up the fire in the fireplace and people checked to see if their shoes and socks were dry yet.The crying man from last night said he had enough of this trail and was going to quit.  T-hug directed him to the Cades Cove trail and ranger station where he could get help.
We set out for Spence Field shelter. There were some horrific climbs and descents today. The Appalachian Trail winds along the border of North Carolina and Tennessee.   By now we had probably passed back and forth between the two states five or six times.  The weather was sunny, dry, and cold.  Hoarfrost lined the trail and icicles hung silently near springs and streams.  
When we got to Spence Field shelter, the National Park Service had posted signs about the dangers of covid and the importance of social distancing.  Birdie grumbled that these notices were about as welcome and as useful as the spam calls one gets informing you your car's warranty is about to expire, even if it isn't.  You just can't get away from the constant drumbeat of unsubstantiated propaganda.  No one was paying the slightest bit of attention to the signs.  I wondered how long it would be before some enterprising hiker decided to make the signs as useful as they were ever going to be by using them as fire starters or toilet paper.
There was a really nice, new privy at Spence Field.  With a door!  In the areas of the trail that go through the National Forest, the privies have no doors.  This is because the Forest Service removed them because of covid, in an effort to discourage people from using them.  This plan did not work at all, and merely turned taking a $h!+ into a spectator sport. 
We saw T-hug again.  He was nursing a sore knee.  We hammock camped and slept comfortably, even though it was cold.","Mollie's Ridge Shelter

Cheesehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649537,"It was a tough day uphill.  Forest Cat took the lead, stopping often for me to catch my breath.  The transition from living at sea level to backpacking at 6,000 feet of altitude has not been easy.  Birdie whinged about the slow pace.
The views at Rocky Top were spectacular.  Mountain after mountain after mountain rolled in the distance, the color changing from blue to deep blue to purple.  My mind went back 500 million years in geologic time and imagined the plate tectonics collision of the North American plate with Gondwanaland (now the African plate).  I imagined the slow smashing together of the plates' coastal margins, uplifting, pushing, and folding the rocks, resulting in today's Appalachian mountains.
As I was contemplating the massive collision of continents and my children were contemplating tuna rolled in tortillas, along came a man in a homemade plaid skirt.  I will not call this a kilt.  It was knee length in front and ankle length in back.  It looked to be made from a plaid flannel remnant from Joann Fabrics.  It did not pair particularly well with hiking shorts, hiking boots or a puffy.  It looked rather bizarre. My immediate thought was ""if Stevie Nicks wore plaid. . .""
Another man came along, a local day hiker hiking up the Cades Cove trail for the exercise and the views.  He offered to take everyone's trash back with him.  He said it was no bother and his car was parked near a trash receptacle.  I almost cried at the thought of ditching almost a pound of trash.  We gave him a trail name:  Hero John.
We departed for Thunderhead Mountain.  Spring flowers were abundant even though the trees had not started to leaf out yet. Hillsides were carpeted with Carolina Spring Beauties.  
We leap-frogged the rest of the day with Tank who was former Army.  He was doing much higher mileage days than we were and it was taking its toll on him.  Age and altitude were taking their toll on me.  We got to an almost vertical section of rock in the trail.  Tank was at the top and warned us that this section was steep and a little technical.  Forest Cat went up with help from Tank. I took off my pack and passed it up to Forest Cat.   Tank gave me a hiking pole to grab on to and a hand up.  Birdie followed nimbly up with no trouble.  Tank was definitely my hero after that steep section.
We got to Derrick Knob shelter.  It was almost dark by the time we finished setting up hammocks.  I was so tired I went right to sleep.  The night was windy and cold.","Spence Field Shelter 
",Derrick Knob Shelter,"Apr 20, Wed",6.10
Cheesehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649539,"This was the day everyone cried.  
There was no privy at Derrick Knob shelter.  The National Park Service helpfully left a shovel next to a well used trail downhill from the shelter.  It was disgusting.  Both sides of the downhill trail were littered with toilet paper blooms.  Behind every tree and log were three or four piles of excrement and discarded toilet paper.  And worse.  It was like a human catbox.  Birdie came back from his morning ablutions cursing.
Birdie:  ""Why can't these people bury their $#!+?  There's even a shovel!  I stepped in someone else's diarrhea that they only covered with a handful of leaves!""
Forest Cat and I started laughing and inventing new excretory trail names for Birdie.
We left the shelter late and the trail was uphill all day.  The weather was warm and sunny.  Upon reaching a false summit Forest Cat started to cry.
Forest Cat (sobbing):  ""I hate this trail.  You just can't get a break.  It's all uphill all the time.  Then it's downhill and rocky and hard.  And then more uphill.  There's no flat.  There's no place to just walk and enjoy it.""
I kissed her cheek and told her it was hard for everyone and this was a particularly tough section.
Birdie was on the phone to his wife again, who was crying because she missed him.  I think he cried because he missed her.
I wanted to cry after listening to Birdie's criticism about how slow I was hiking.  I hiked ahead a little bit to calm some unwelcome thoughts and emotions. 
We decided not to push on to Double Spring Gap shelter, our original destination, because of the late start and the difficulty of the trail.  At some point we decided we would bail out at Clingman's Dome tomorrow, and either get a shuttle or hitchhike to our car at Newfound Gap.  Birdie, ever cautious, derided my suggestion to hitchhike, claiming it was dangerous.  
We finally reached Siler Bald shelter with plenty of daylight left to cook dinner and socialize with other hikers.  I was happy to see Giggles and Squeek again.  Giggles said she had an absolute meltdown and cried over a candy bar today.  Soon other hikers in the shelter were admitting that today was the toughest day yet and left many of them crying at some point.  
Birdie, Forest Cat and I slept in the shelter in order to get an earlier start to Clingman's Dome in the morning.","Derrick Knob Shelter

Cheesehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649564,"Siler Bald shelter was a repeat of Derrick Knob shelter in terms of toilet paper and $#!+ everywhere.  Really, the National Park Service should worry less about covid and more about the obvious public health and sanitation problems at the Derrick Knob and Siler Bald shelters.  The problem could be easily solved by the construction of a moldering privy like the one at Spence Field shelter.
As we cooked breakfast we met a thru hiker from South Africa who had been tent camping near the shelter.  Birdie said my Wild Zora grain free instant breakfast cereal looked and smelled like parrot $#!+.  He was not wrong.  We said goodbye to Giggles and Squeek and hoped we would see them further up the trail.
We were hiking at a pretty good pace, considering it was still uphill.   We stopped for lunch at Double Spring Gap shelter and congratulated ourselves for having the wisdom to stop earlier yesterday and treat blistered feet and strained ankles instead of pushing two miles more uphill and finishing in the dark.  There were people already stopping for the day at Double Sping Gap shelter who planned to get up at 3 a.m. and night hike to Clingman's Dome for sunrise.  Yeah, no, that hike is not on my bucket list.
We met a Ridge Runner from the Appalachian Trail Conservancy shortly after departing from Double Spring Gap shelter.  She advised of a terrain change coming up.  After hearing our complaints about the vast quantity of human waste at two of the previous shelters she said one of the two states making up Great Smoky Mountains National Park was not on board with building privies.
The terrain changed from beech, oak and pine to spruce forest.  Everything, logs, trees, and rocks, were covered with bright green moss.  It looked like a location from the movie The Chronicles of  Narnia.  
About a mile from Clingman's Dome, Birdie hiked ahead to get the jeep.  I wasn't hopeful as I had just heard another hiker complain that there were no shuttles to be had and the going rate was $150 per person one way to Gatlinburg. 
Forest Cat and I met a hiker, trail name Madness, from Phoenix, at the Clingman's Dome bypass trail junction.  We lagged behind him all the way to the observation tower.  We sat on a low stone wall at the base of the observation tower and took off our packs.  Forest Cat walked into the woods a short distance away to call her fiance who she missed terribly.  When she came back I asked her to watch my pack while I walked up the ramp to the Observation tower.  I felt like I was flying without the backpack.  I saw Madness up there and asked him to take my picture at the top of the observation tower.  The 360 degree views from the top of the tower were stunning.
I came back down to where Forest Cat was minding the packs.  I urged her to run up to the top, it would be easy without the pack, and the views would be worth it.  She went up the ramp to the tower.  Birdie called.
Birdie: ""Where are you guys? I'm waiting in the car park with the jeep.""
Me:  ""At the tower.  Wow, that was fast!  Did you catch a shuttle?""
Birdie:  ""No, I hitchhiked.""
Me (astonished):  ""You WHAT?""
Birdie: ""I hitchhiked with a Christian school.  They were on a 7th grade field trip.  I told them I was an Eagle Scout (true).  One of their chaperones gave me a ride in his truck down to the gap.""
Forest Cat and I walked down the half mile paved trail to the parking lot where Birdie was waiting.  Forest Cat commented, rather unkindly, about all the fat kids complaining to their parents about having to walk a half mile on a paved trail to and from the tower.  They acted like they had never been outside before.

I huffed and puffed my way up the bonus half mile from the parking lot to the trailhead.  I stopped often to rest and answer tourist questions about hiking the Appalachian Trail.
I stepped onto the relative silence of the trail.  A few tourists had ventured onto the trail, mostly out of curiosity and the chance for a photo op.  I answered more questions.  The crowds thinned out completely in about a tenth of a mile.  I was hiking fairly fast as I wanted to finish 8 miles before dark.  
The trail was densely wooded and fragrant from the spruce trees.  Moss covered everything.  Colors ranged from deep forest green to bright moss green.  Browns and grays peek through on tree trunks and boulders.  There were some interesting quartzite boulders next to the trail.  I hiked downhill, oh what a lovely change!  There was a giant stone staircase of dark gray boulders that wound down and around.  I expected to see characters from Narnia or Lord of the Rings.  I did see a squirrel.
I went up and over Mt. Collins in peace and quiet.  I bypassed the turnoff to the Mt. Collins Shelter.  I crossed several springs and streams.  I encountered one true southbounder, many day hikers in both directions, and a few nobos headed for Mt. Collins Shelter.
There was an interesting part of this hike where I crossed into an environmentally sensitive area of native beech forest.  The beech forest was protected by a wire fence to keep out invasive feral hogs.  There was an interesting configuration of steel grating and wire fence that functioned to keep hogs out yet allow ease of human access, almost like walking over a pig-proof style.
I quickly descended the rest of the trail, crossing more springs and streams until I emerged across the road from the car park.  I was so glad to see my car, sit down, and change hiking boots for soft shoes.  I spent the night quietly in Gatlinburg.","Clingman's Dome

It was a simple 500 foot climb up and over a ridge and then the trail snaked along the edge of the lake.  Flowers bloomed, bees buzzed, and I could smell the lake.  It was warm and sunny.  Laurels bloomed pink and white. Log fern and dagger fern lined the trail.  False Solomon's seal reminded me of my grandmother's garden. Rue-anemone and dwarf crested iris added splotches of white and purple color.  A pileated woodpecker scolded me for entering his territory.  His warning call sounded like a chihuahua barking, it was so loud in the otherwise still forest. 
I met a day hiker coming toward me who stopped on top of the ridge to catch his breath.  A man hiking behind me caught up to me.  They appeared to know each other so I left them to their reunion.  The man behind me was very drunk.  Later, as I negotiated the narrow path above the lake, I hoped he didn't fall in.
As I got closer to the Fontana shelter, known as the Fontana Hilton for its nearby showers and flush toilets, I saw a man hiking towards me.  He was wearing a straw boater, red framed sunglasses, a red onesie, and hiking boots.  Who hikes in just their underwear?  He appeared to have lost 20 or 30 pounds since he bought the onesie.  It was of the tank top and shorts style, but still a single garment.  It was bright red, silky, flimsy, and left absolutely nothing to the imagination.  It was the kind of encounter where you only want to look at their face. 
Where are those special forces guys I keep hearing about?  I might actually like to see them.
I passed the Fontana Hilton and restroom with real plumbing.  Hiker gear hung on the nearby fence, presumably drying after being washed in the shower.  From there the trail followed a paved road and sidewalk down to the parking lot near the dam.  The TVA had some interesting information plaques about the operation and construction of the dam and the Appalachian Trail. 
I got to the parking lot at the picnic area and no shuttle. I retraced my steps to the parking lot by the Fontana Hilton and called the shuttle. He was there in a few minutes.  The shuttle was full of sweaty, smelly, swearing hikers going to the Fontana resort for some zero days.  It reminded me of flying in helicopters to work offshore in Australia, except the Australians generally smell better.

The trail up seemed easier than the trail up to Clingman's Dome.  The grade seemed less steep and there were only a few boulders to climb up. The day was cold and sunny which seemed to make hiking easier.  I answered quite a few questions from day hikers about the trail and long distance hiking.

On the way I met a day hiker from Minnesota and we hiked companionably together to Charlie's Bunion.   Warning signs at the Charlie's Bunion trail junction told parents to keep a grip on their small children.  Soon I could see why.  The trail wound along the base of a huge rock outcrop and along the edge of a very steep dropoff with very little vegetation to arrest a fall.  A little simple bouldering was involved.  Easy with a day pack, harder for me with a full backpack.  Charlie's Bunion is named after the resemblance to the swollen foot of an early Smoky Mountains mountain guide, Charlie Conner who had hiked painfully up to Charlie's Bunion to inspect fire and erosional damage. Early 20th century travel writer Horace Kephart described Charlie's Bunion and its environs as ""so rough that you could not make seven miles a day in it to save your life...""  I enjoyed the views at Charlie's Bunion and departed northbound, leaving my new Minnesota friend to day hike back to Newfound Gap.

I found a pair of socks and put them in my trash bag as part of my daily effort to pick up trash along the trail.  Then I met a man hiking with lute. His trail name was Smoky Mountain Bard.  The trail had lots of blowdowns blocking the path.
The day was warm cloudy.  I passed a couple of flat places with mud on the trail.  They reminded me of the Lone Star Trail, my home trail.  I saw a very old man with long white hair and a white beard, wearing a purple kilt.  In his case it looked like a proper kilt from Scotland.  He was southbound on the trail.

Cammerer fire tower with Lawn Chair and SideQuest and a few others, but common sense and mileage prevailed and I stopped at Cosby Knob shelter.  Magnolia and I discussed the merits of a side trip to the fire tower, but it was cloudy and I didn't want to add 1.2 bonus miles for a view of rain, clouds, and fog.
A cold wind blew and the day became more cloudy.  I caught up to Matt, an artist and English teacher, whom I had met a couple of nights before, and had seen at the same shelters I had stayed at.  We appeared to be doing about the same mileage per day.  Matt was a tent camper, liked his privacy, and wanted to arrive early at the shelters to pick out the best, flat tent spot, of which there were few.  Matt was picking up some missing miles for his second thru hike, the first being 16 years previous.
As we hiked together, I listened to Matt talk about art and teaching English internationally, primarily in Asia.  I felt like I was living vicariously in an alternate universe, completely alien to my world of engineering and construction.  It was refreshing.  The rain came around noon, not 6 pm.  I threw on my Ukrainian military poncho to stay dry and Matt hiked happily in the rain, getting wet.
The rain stopped, the sun came out and everything surrounding us was vividly green.  We arrived at Davenport Gap shelter and it was grim.  It was on the side of a steep, heavily wooded hill,  so any sunlight was well filtered.  No bear cables, bear box, or privy, but there was an unwelcome sign from the National Park Service saying not to leave human waste or toilet paper lying around unburied or they would close the shelter.  There was a chain link fence across the front of the shelter to keep bears out.  Dead leaves and dirt accumulated along the bottom edge of the fence inside the shelter, giving it an abandoned and unclean vibe.  Notes in the shelter log were mostly from hikers just passing through or stopping for lunch.  Matt made some comments about serial killers.  I had planned to spend the night here, but it was too creepy.  Besides, I didn't want to be a zoo exhibit for bears.
Matt said he was going to look for a tent site, so I hiked on to Davenport Gap. I put the remaining half of my thru hiker permit into the permit box and exited Great Smoky Mountains National Park.   At Davenport Gap I called a shuttle and Ron, a highly recommended shuttle driver, picked me up and drove me back to Newfound Gap to retrieve my car.  While I was waiting for the shuttle, several more hikers, including Matt, came to the gap.  Most were planning to hike on a couple miles to Standing Bear Farm and Hostel, or look for a stealth campsite now that we were out of Great Smoky Mountains National Park and not restricted to only staying in shelters.","Cosby Knob Shelter

Cheesehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650155,"I may have discovered the loveliest two miles of the trail so far.  I intended to park my car at Standing Bear Farm and Hostel, take a shuttle to Davenport Gap and continue my northbound hike back to my car.  It was not to be.  I couldn't get a quick shuttle.
I decided to do a mini flip-flop.  I would hike southbound from Standing Bear to Davenport Gap and get a shuttle back to my car.   I ran into Wink and SideQuest at Standing Bear and got some phone numbers to call if I needed a shuttle.  Standing Bear staff graciously said I could call them if I got stuck.
I walked down the gravel road from Standing Bear to the trail sign.  I crossed a small stream and entered the forest.  The trail wound up and over a small hill.  I could hear road noise from I-40.  Soon I could see the interstate well below me from my perch on top of the hill.  I descended a stone staircase toward the gravel road.
There was a woman parked in a white minivan who asked if I was thru hiking.  I said yes, but admitted to slack packing for the day.  She handed me a cold drink of flavored coconut water with hydration salts.  The perfect trail magic on a hot day!  I was so grateful.  She said I was the first hiker she had seen that day.
I walked under I-40, down the feeder a bit and crossed the Pigeon River Bridge on Tobes Creek Road.  I met two northbound hikers on the bridge.  A short distance after the bridge the trail turned into the forest.  An 800 foot climb ensued.  
The trail skimmed the edge of a stream, crossing it several times and giving magnificent views of rushing, tumbling water, cascades, and small waterfalls.  It was so lovely.   The deep green of the forest, emerging spring flowers lining the trail, the sound of the stream on its descent over rocks, and the many cascades made me think this was the most beautiful day so far.
I met a couple of day hikers from Michigan and a few northbound thru hikers.  I called Ron, the shuttle driver from yesterday and he picked me up at Davenport Gap.  He gave me the scenic tour back to Standing Bear.  As well as seeing some beautiful foliage and a large waterfall, it was a view into Appalachian life I might otherwise not have had.
Back at Standing Bear, I said goodbye to SideQuest and headed for home for a while.","Davenport Gap

Cheesehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655029,"I'm hiking with Forest Cat again, for some mother-daughter bonding time before her wedding.  Forest Cat's soon to be in-law uncle and aunt, who live near Waynesville, North Carolina, dropped us off at the trailhead near Standing Bear Farm.  They looked at us and our backpacks like we were a little crazy and the next four days of hiking and camping were not their idea of fun.
The trail was mostly uphill. The first five miles were a relentless upward climb of about 2500 feet to Snowbird Peak. It was a tough upward trek for both of us. Forest Cat's fiance helped her with hiking uphill by phone encouragement.
Information about Snowbird Peak promised excellent views and a weird looking communications tower.  When we arrived at the bald on top of Snowbird Peak, it was cloudy and the bald was overgrown, on its way back to being forested.  I looked for the promised views but it was overcast.  We were hiking inside a cloud.  The wind gusted and sheets of rain blew by in front of us.  We never saw the communications tower with visibility about 100 feet.  It started to rain.  At first a light sprinkle, it grew into a downpour. We hurried across the bald and under the shelter of the forest canopy. Back in the forest, we barely felt the rain.  
From Snowbird Peak it was downhill to Groundhog Creek shelter, with plenty of daylight left. We boiled water for dinner inside the shelter as it was raining hard on the uncovered picnic table.  We were the only ones there. We hung bear bags and a trash bag on the provided bear cables.
We saw no other hikers all day.  Wildlife seen was a frog, toad, squirrel, and snail.","Standing Bear Farm & Hostel

Cheesehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655037,"We woke up early and got a reasonable start.  The uphill climbs today were less awful than yesterday.  We met a 70-something local man named Bill who was day hiking, climbing the mountains with ease, and without poles.  I was impressed and slightly jealous.  He told us the uphill climb would get better in about half a mile.
I took lots of pictures of interesting mushrooms in the forest along the way. With the daily rains, mushrooms are prolific and in every stage of emergence and maturity. My cousin, Mushroom Phil, does the identification for me.  
I was looking forward to Max Patch.  It's one of the big, scenic, check-the-box, waypoints on the Appalachian Trail. “A man called Mack or Max settled on the property in pre-Civil War days and folks started to call it Mack’s Patch or Max Patch. Sheep, cattle and horses have grazed here.”* 
Max Patch totally lived up to the wow factor.  Most of the pictures I've seen of Max Patch show it covered with tents.  A Forest Service protective order, in effect for about a year, has closed it to camping, fires, horseback riding, fireworks, picnicking, dogs without leashes, or stove use. It is for hiking only and signs warn you not to go off trail because of rattlesnakes and ticks.  Other information signs tell of the Forest Service efforts at repopulating Max Patch with native grasses and plants.  My favorite flower on Max Patch was the Yellow toadflax (Linaria vulgaris), a type of wild snapdragon.
Near the beginning of Max Patch trailhead, I fixed some of Forest Cat's blisters with moleskin.  A family of day hikers came by and wished us luck on our hike.  They passed quickly, probably they could smell us.  We saw quite a few families and day hikers enjoying the loop and summit trails around and over Max Patch.  Several people encouraged us on our hike.
We re-entered the forest after the bald of Max Patch.  From Max Patch it was downhill all the way to Roaring Fork shelter.  Scarlet beebalm (Monarda didyma) and Turk's-Cap lilies (Lilium superbum) added lovely splashes of red and orange color along the deeply forested and vividly green trail.  We reached Roaring Fork shelter with plenty of daylight left to cook and do camp chores.  Almost immediately upon putting our packs down, a hopeful mouse appeared, expecting dinner crumbs.  We used our hammocks as bug (and mouse) nets inside the shelter to keep the wildlife off our faces while we slept.  We were the only ones at the shelter.  I signed the shelter log and looked for names of people I met hiking earlier this spring.  I was encouraged to see Stork, Giggles, and Squeak's signatures and trail notes.
After dinner as I sat at the picnic table making trail notes and playing Sudoku, a fearless mouse ran across my knee.  Still hoping for crumbs from dinner, I guess.  No luck since we hung the food and trash on the bear cables. After another run across my leg, she gave up and returned to her mouse home under the shelter floor.
Wildlife seen toads, birds, snail, mice.

Cheesehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655119,"We slept till 8 a.m.  How did that happen?  I'm usually up with the sun.  Maybe we were tired from yesterday's biggest mileage day yet.  Little did we know.  We hurried to get breakfast made, packed up, and on our way.  We were low on water and I worried.
At the first opportunity to replenish water, about 0.1 miles from the shelter, Forest Cat filtered water and I washed out a pair of underwear.  Not to worry, I used biodegradable soap and washed the panties 200 feet from the water source, using Leave No Trace principles.  Like the previous two days, it was going to be hot and humid.  I attached the underwear to the outside of my pack to dry.  I was hopeful that by the end of the day they might be dry enough to wear.  Water bottles full, we assisted each other with putting on our now heavier packs.  Forest Cat shrieked about my drying panties while lifting my backpack for me, ""Eeeww, away from the face, away from the face!""  I laughed so hard my stomach started to hurt.
I planned to camp about 8 miles from Roaring Fork shelter, at a campsite listed in Awol's guide, but not shown on the FarOut/Guthook app.  As we hiked, I talked about my parents and grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins, so Forest Cat could get some family history.  I went into some detail about some of the struggles of growing up in a single parent household in the 1960's, when divorce was considered shameful, and divorced women (and their children) were shunned.
As we hiked, a woman passed us.  She said she was going as close to Hot Springs as she could get in the daylight.  Later, a young man passed us, saying he was looking for a campsite at Catpen Gap or Bluff Mountain, and he thought he had two or three miles to go.  I told him he had already passed Catpen Gap.  He said his girlfriend was hiking slower, behind him.  Later we saw him at a campsite at Phil's Gap, waiting for his girlfriend.  The Phil's Gap campsite had been my planned campsite, but I suspected the young man and his girlfriend would occupy it and anyway, it was still too far from Hot Springs.  We kept walking and soon came to an interesting pile of boulders on top of Bluff Mountain.  The total climb up Bluff Mountain had not been easy.
We stopped at Lemon Gap for lunch and Forest Cat saw a deer.  I had Spam which was a nice change from tuna.  There was a big climb out of Lemon Gap to Walnut Mountain shelter.  Walnut Mountain shelter looked as if it needed some repairs or refurbishing.  I thought I would only stay in it in a hail storm.  I'm not a fan of shelters or campsites on top of mountains.  Forest Cat and I continued on, looking for campsites and water.  There were many streams to replenish water. Most had poor flow that made water collection difficult.  On a bald area I foraged some ripe blackberries.  There were so many I was surprised all the bears in Pisgah National Forest weren't up there foraging with me.  Forest Cat worried I might be eating something poisonous.
Forest Cat:  ""How do you know they're not poisonous""
Me:  ""They're blackberries.
Forest Cat:  ""How do you know they're blackberries.""
Me:  ""They look just like the ones in the store.  Besides, we grew them on the back fence in Wisconsin.  I know a blackberry when I see it.""
We passed an unappealing campsite that looked like it was in the middle of a Forest Service Road.  Not wanting to be run over by an ATV or a jeep club in the middle of the night, we kept going.  We finally got a good supply of water to filter at Big Rock Spring.  It was a piped spring that made collection easy and the flow of water out of the pipe was good.  It was getting late in the day and we kept looking for a campsite.  There was another campsite near a stream that had no trees for hammocks.  I mentioned to Forest Cat that one of my goals for hiking the Appalachian Trail, other than eventually reaching Katahdin and never having to call Search and Rescue, was to boost my mileage to ten miles per day or more.  I'm basically a lazy hiker and shelter to shelter is usually fine for me, which limits me to the average 8-ish miles between shelters.
By now it was dusk and Garenflo Gap was only a mile away.  I decided to call a shuttle and take my chances on a hotel room in Hot Springs.  Shuttle driver Jason recommended Laughing Heart Lodge and Hostel, and I was able to reserve us a room, food and beer at Laughing Heart Lodge. Not one minute after I called Laughing Heart Lodge we passed a perfect campsite.  But it was occupied by a single tent.  I suspected that the woman who had passed us much earlier was camped there.  We finished the last 0.7 miles to Garenflo Gap in the dark with headlamps.  We were exhausted, our feet hurt, and we were delighted to see Jason drive up about five minutes after we got to the gap.  Forest Cat congratulated me on achieving one of my AT goals of hiking more than ten miles in one day.  We had a beautiful and comfortable room at the Laughing Heart Lodge.  Microwaved food and cider from the hiker honor fridge at Laughing Heart Hostel was just perfect.  Laughing Heart owners and hosts, Gabe and Maria, were most gracious and welcoming.

Cheesehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655348,"I had a leisurely start leaving my daughter's place in Charlotte.  The drive up to Hot Springs was a few hours.  I checked in to the Laughing Heart Lodge, called a shuttle, and packed a day pack.
Platinum blazing describes a hiker practice of staying in lovely accommodations,  eating good food, and indulging in nice wine when off trail.  The Laughing Heart Lodge is definitely on the platinum scale for hikers.  The lodge is old, charmingly renovated but retains its past century allure, and nicely decorated with period antiques.  The outside spaces include plenty of comfortable chairs to lounge in and a meditation maze in the front lawn.  I spied a croquet set on the porch. The property also includes a chapel and hiker hostel.
The shuttle driver told me to look for a white Mercedes.  I wondered how she would get a Mercedes up the rain-rutted Forest Service road.  She dropped me off near the intersection of the paved road and the gravel Forest Service road.  I got a bonus 0.1 mile walk to the trailhead.
It was a leisurely 500 foot ascent for the first mile.  I crossed a dry stream at Taylor Hollow Gap.  During early spring it was probably flowing nicely, but by mid'July it was barely a seep.
The next two miles were downhill to Deer Park Mountain Shelter.  I detoured 0.1 miles to the shelter. It was log cabin style, CCC 1930s vintage, and in need of some minor repairs.  Although I didn't check with a compass, the open side of the shelter appeared to face north. In the late afternoon it was dark, very dark inside.  I grabbed the log book and signed, noting that Forest Cat bailed out in favor of an air conditioned gym in Charlotte. In the interior gloom of the shelter, I could see an abandoned day pack, but it had a lot of dust on it so I assumed it had been there for a while.  The shelter would have been very appealing in a hailstorm, torrential rain, lightning strikes, or hurricane force winds.  I had a snack and water at the picnic table and retraced my steps back to the main trail. 
After a slight 200 foot ascent, the next three miles were downhill all the way to Hot Springs.  This was where I got the money shot of the day; a photo above the clouds and across a valley.  The rest of the descent onto Hot Springs was quick and uneventful.  The trail ended for me at the confluence of the Carolina Mountain Club brass plaque inset into a gray, granite, obelisk-ish, boulder, the U.S. Forest Service (Pisgah National Forest) trailhead parking lot, and the Laughing Heart Hostel.  I grabbed a cold beer out of the hiker honor fridge and headed for the shower.","Garenflo Gap
