We began at Springer Mountain and with our fall hike, we should be at the Shenandoah National Park. We have been blest by meeting many thru hikers that have given us their friendship and knowledge.

Trail names are usually given to a hiker by others, and many times will help you remember that person easily years later. A hiker might earn the trail name because of a habit, character trait, or something entertaining that happened. The first hiker I followed on trail journals was nick named “Flash”. He revealed the funny story of how he earned it and it will stick me for many seasons. My trail name of beavER was given to me by my hiking friends. This group of “friends” are guys that I owe more to than they can ever know. Through our adventures as backpackers, I have experienced a glimpse of the Lord’s Creation. My buddies call me beavER because of my affection for the skill of the beavers I saw on a hike up to Kings Peak in Utah. The capital letters “ER” highlight my trip to the Emergency Room for stitches on one of my hikes through the Smokies.",,View Entry,"Aug 16, Fri",0

When Steve said the name with his positive style and mischievous smile, I knew it was meant to be. As others hikers hear her name after we introduce ourself, it almost always is greeted with a smile. Don’t get me wrong, she earned it. On our first 3 day, 2 night back back in the Smokies, she got together her luxury items. Luxury items are what you put on your back and carry that are not must have items. She is a Hair Dresser, and had to have products to keep her hair style looking good. There was a whole bag of extras. But the icing on the cake was a table cloth. (guess who gets to carry the extras?) BWB will go into detail why the table cloth in a later entry. She was able to convince me to carry it, so what does that say about me?",,View Entry,"Aug 18, Sun",0

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621521,"I know that explaining “why” will not be easy. How do you make sense of a six month journey? On foot, through 14 states, almost 2200 miles, sleeping mostly in the forest, with the bears, to your 6 year old grandson? All he sees is a void that is coming in his young life. Hikers I have followed over the years have journaled the statement, “the hike is 90% mental.” I scoffed at the statement a few years ago. But even before I take the first step, I already know that it will be so. Over the last 7 years I have had the pleasure of backpacking with a wonderful group of friends. We have hiked in Utah, N. Carolina, Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee. We call our little group “Mad Dogs in the Sun.” I owe much of my fondness of backpacking to our fearless leader “Yo-Yo”. He invited me to the trail 8 years ago, and I have not looked back. What great memories of my first steps on the trail with a 70+ lb. external frame pack bulging at the seams. He was a great teacher as he let me learn the hard way. I probably didn’t need the spare pair of blue jeans, or the 9 lbs. of hatchet, hunting knife, leather holding case that also had a sharpening stone. I had so much stuff when I started the hike that I tied my 80’s 5 lb. sleeping bag on the top of the pack. It was because of this bag that I learned my greatest lesson from my Master Sensei Yo-Yo. On a steep downhill trail portion, my dry rotted strings that held the sleeping bag gave up the ghost. Imagine my surprise to see the rolling bag pass me and begin to overtake my leader a few steps in front. To my dismay, he did not reach for the bag, instead he pulled his Nikon from his chest strap and clicked away at the event unfolding before his eyes. That lesson is burnt into my pea brain as if branded with a red hot poker. “Document first, ask questions later!”Terry, you are my Brother.",,View Entry,"Aug 21, Wed",0

He let us know about the one good thing about COVID-19: Star Wars episode IX was released early... yeah!!! He was the only one in the family that had already seen it. He set up the projector with surround sound speakers. Backwoods made popcorn, it was better that the theater. This afternoon, I played army with the boys and a quick game of horse (basketball). I was trying to lose on purpose, but the oldest, 6 year old Thomas, said “Papaw, you have to shoot your best shot”. My daughter and son-in-law came to pick them up.

Looks like the rain should stop by morning and we will have one day to hike before it returns. Backwoods and I hiked down the 600 steps past the waterfall to get to the famous arch at the beginning of the approach trail. I was confused by the movie “A Walk in the Woods”. In the movie it seems as if Bryson and Katz come straight from the back of the lodge to start the trail. It is a long way down in reality. After seeing the arch and getting pic, we hiked back up the 600 steps to get back to the lodge. I was all ready soaked with sweat. Tomorrow we go. beavER.",,View Entry,"Mar 20, Fri",0

Great way to start out. When we climbed the 8 miles up to Springer, we found it cover in day hikers. Hiking seems to be the thing to do with the kids since it was the weekend. There is a couple of large rocks with plaques noting that Springer is the Southern terminus. We noticed just a few thru- hikers as we traveled north. Many have postponed their hikes because of all the concerns. We found a great campsite by a rolling creek. A hiker with the trail name Buddy stopped by to eat his dinner then he continued on to find a site with 2 close trees for his hammock.

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627262,"We broke camp after a good night sleep. The creek beside us made for a soothing surrounding. The day was overcast mostly but not bad temperature for hiking. We traveled over familiar sites that reminded me of our hike here about 6 years ago. Best spot of the day was a short side trail to Long Creek Falls. We decided to head to Gooch Mtn. Shelter to stay out of the rain over night. That was a good call as a very heavy rain hit us over night. Shelter is great as it has an upstairs loft. There was about 12 thru hikers at the shelter as it is a main stopping spot. Met some interesting hikers. Odyssey from Vegas, a 31 year old hiking with support from her friend for the first 30 days. He is driving the backroads and meeting up with her ever chance he can. Another person is Burrito, a ex military medic that did 2 tours in Middle East. He was currently working as a fisherman in Maine. Backwoods ask him if was as dangerous as they show on TV. He told her about some of the near death experiences. As we hiked, we stopped at a shelter to take a short break and I turned my phone on to call my daughter. After I hung up, my phone rang and it was Jen, one of the owners of the Hike Inn. I had sent a resupply box to them as I planned to stay with them before heading into the smokies. Jen let me know they are being forced to shut down, she is mailing my resupply back to my house. I will have to have to come up with another plan to resupply. Backwoods was able to build a fire at the shelter we spent the night at. It helped to break the mood and loosen up everyone to warm themselves up. Only cost me one half of my box of waterproof matches. It was a good day.- beavER","Stover Creek Foot Bridge past Springer Mtn.

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627265,"Backwoods plan for the last year has been to hike about once per month with me as I try to thru hike. She committed to do the first 40 miles from the falls to Neel gap... if “the weather was good.” Yesterday was not that “good” hiking day. We had stayed in the shelter so I did not have to break down a wet tent and carry the extra 2 lbs of water. It had poured all night and was going to rain all day. Most of the hikers were headed 8 miles, through streams that are supposed to be trails, to Lance Creek campsites. Some were planning to stop at Woody Gap after only 4 miles to call a shuttle to come take them to town and sit this one out. There were 3 other hikers who were planning like us to shoot for 12 miles to make it to the next shelter. This would be much more difficult task. Today was the trail that breaks most hikers. Before I hiked this section 6 years ago, I always wondered why would a large percent of the people who had planned for over a year, quit their jobs, spent hundreds of dollars on equipment, give up their dreams when they arrive at Neel Gap? When you come out here and do it, you know. The first 5 miles from the start of Springer is what you dream of. Next 5 are not too bad with PUDS (pointless ups and downs) at Horse Gap by mile 10.5, it all changes, it becomes the AT. The AT is a challenge like none other. From House Gap, it is straight up for 800 feet. As we were trudging through the mud and rain, trying to not slip and fall on the wet rocks and roots, Backwoods says let’s push for it. She wanted to try to make it to the gap... Hotel! I can’t blame her, she is much smarter than me. So off we went, breaks were kept to “stop just long enough to get your heart rate down.” No lunch stop, and no water refill stops, I just shared hers once I ran out with 3 miles to go. The only thing in our way was Blood Mountain. 800 feet straight up and 1500 feet straight down. Needless to say, we slept in the Best Western last night. - beavER","Gooch Mtn. Shelter

Backwoods Barbie and I had hiked together for 840 of the last 900 miles that I hiked on the AT. The other 60 miles my nephew Chad had hiked with me.The last time I hiked by myself was the first long section of AT I did back nine years ago. Backwoods dropped me off at Neel Gap and I begin my hike as she headed home. ? There was a mist that covered the mountain but you could tell it was going to clear up. About 9:30 the sun started coming out and it became a beautiful day to hike. The climbs and the miles seem to slip away as I was deep in thought.

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627369,"Today at Unicoi Gap I got my first “trail magic.” Trail magic is when someone does something really nice for you just because they can. One example is coming to a road and finding a group of people cooking hamburgers for you. “Touch up” was the trail name of the guy from Kentucky (Metcalfe Co.) that did the trail magic. He thru hiked last year. He had his trunk full of goodies. The items were free for us to take if we wanted them. I took a Kit Kat and a Gatorade. I was able to hike with “Fine Line” for about an hour as we came out of the mountains to Unicoi Gap. She has already hiked many trail miles as she did the Florida Trail last year. It starts in Key West and ends up in the pan handle. I think she said it was about 1700 miles. Today my goal was to make it to Tray Mountain shelter. The last time Backwoods Barbie and I hiked this section we had to sprint to get to the shelter before a bad storm hit with a lot of lightning. The shelter was a God send as it might have saved our lives. Lighting was striking all around us as we huddled in the small wooden “shack.” But this afternoon was beautiful weather for hiking, mostly sunny. Tray Mountain is the highest climb so far as it is about 1500 feet straight up. At the Tray Mtn. Shelter tonight I would normally expect to see about 30 people at least. Tonight there is me and a young lady named Picasso. She likes to paint and she is carrying a few supplies so she can do water colors when she can. Yesterday I went from 10:00am to today at 11:00 am without seeing anyone on the trail. That’s when I ran into Fine Line. I think there is a large group behind me.","Poplar Stamp Gap campsite

I kept thinking my tent stakes might be pulled out of the rain softened dirt, but they held up just fine.  Just before dark two additional through hikers rolled into the shelter, “Mando” and “Penguin.” It was a beautiful sunny morning. Where I had my tent, I was able to get a wonderful view of the sunrise. The whole day was sunny, so much so, that I realized I was going to be sunburnt if I were not careful. I packed up and hit the trail early as I wanted to get off the top of the mountain to have breakfast out of the wind. I stopped 1 mile down the trail on a large rock to cook my oatmeal and hot chocolate. I topped it off with a honey bun and now I will set to shoot for Dick’s Creek Gap and Hiawassee,Ga. 11 miles away. I was able to hike and talk with Picasso from Akron Ohio this morning. The trail had many ups and downs today and I pushed hard to finish, I was thinking like Backwoods Barbie, as I knew a hot shower was waiting at the end. I met up with “Turtle” at the Vista of Powell Mountain. She was very nice and we took each other’s pics with the view in the background. From the Vista area I called to line up my shuttle to pick me up at the Gap one and a half hours later. There is zero cell service once you get there. On the way down I caught up with “Donatello” and finished the last mile hiking hiking and visiting. Once we got to the Budget Inn, Picasso and I decided to head over to DQ to get a burger and a blizzard...Oreo of course. We walked through the drive-through together. Picasso’s Dad is coming down on Saturday to get her off the trail because of the Covid-19. Today’s hike was special no doubt about it.

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627384,"After much prayer and running every scenario through my brain multiple times I have decided to suspend my hike. I am headed home to ride out the wave and see what transpires over the next month. Backwoods Barbie had only been home for a few days before I called and asked for a long distance shuttle. She left at 5:30 am to come and pick me up. I am planning to also postpone my retirement and see if things will get better with the virus. I am looking at 4 different options. 1- The Smokies open back up  after Easter and I start back up at Dick’ Creek Gap. 2- If it takes until May/ June to open trails back up, then I can start up at Waynesboro, Va. and head North and plan to do a flip flop from there. I have sectioned hike over the last 8 years to Rockfish Gap, so that would be a great place to start. 3- If it takes even longer, until mid June- July, then I would consider a SOBO (Southbound) starting in Maine and hiking back to Georgia. 4- Later than July and I would need to consider next year or never. As I left the Budget Inn, I said good bye to Picasso, she was headed back to Ohio. Bye to Paul from Quebec, he was leaving for Atlanta to fly back home. He did not want to be trapped in the woods with no way to get to Canada. I also said bye to Don, he was spending a zero day trying to decide what to do. 2 other hikers that I did not meet headed home also.

I thought a few of you might enjoy laughing with me, so I decided to share one of these hits from my good friend “Turtle” after I mentioned that I was a failure and I needed some advice:
BeavER,Heartless....... cruel........vindictive.
 The AT is a fickle seductress.  She summons a man onto the trail with whispered suggestions of great achievements......then crushes his spirit on a forlorn, muddy trail.  She caresses the nape of his neck with warm spring breezes......and then breaks wind in his face with cold, mighty gales.  
 No man is permitted her embrace for long.  Some she will tolerate a season.......others-  mere hours.
 Advice?  Maybe next time (there will be a next time), don't pull off the trail for a Comfort Inn after 3 days.  The trail mistress views this as infidelity.
 Failure?  Absolutely not.  You just ""came up short"" by a couple thousand miles.  A failure is one who hasn’t the courage to dream.  A failure is one who cannot muster passion for anything more challenging than the safety of his daily routine.
 Proud of you.  Now quit your whining and start planning.  Tackle the AT from August to April-  in the winter!","Paris

Now for the backstory... last year when I postponed my hike because of the plague, I headed home from Dick’s Creek gap (which is about 80 miles of hiking including the approach trail). I had learned a couple of things I had done wrong, and decided to change my actions to not make the same mistakes. One of them, not do near as many miles early on, ease into the hike to make sure I don’t overdo it. Did I stick to my new hike resolution? Of course not! Backwoods and I knew bad weather was coming, so we ended up doing more miles on both the first and second day. We did this to make sure we could get out today. This made for 2 tired puppies.

They also broke camp early, which is not easy on a cold morning. I warmed up about 11:00 and had to peel off all the extra layers. The weather turned perfect as the day went on. I was able to visit briefly with Sunny and Spice on the trail as we passed each other. Shortly after that, I passed a trail runner going the opposite direction (someone who takes care of sections of the trails, as well as shelters). She was wearing a mask, but I recognized her upper face... I said,” I think I know you, aren’t you the person my wife, Backwoods Barbie, and I met back at Amicalola Falls?” She was and was excited to see me again as she remembered what we were doing. That was really cool. What a great blessing it was to be hiking this section today, I was very emotional as it was the last section I hiked in 2020 before the trail was closed and I had to stop. On Powell mountain, there is a short side trail to a great Vista. You can see the lakes below as well as all the surrounding mountains. I stopped there, as I had the year before, to take a break in the warm sunshine, and eat lunch. I admit, I wanted to stretch this day out.... As I was enjoying the spot, a college student named Ali, came up and visited. She had her nice dog, Kelp, with her. I shared some of my beef jerky (Mingus Brothers brand from Paris, Ky) with him, now we’re buddies for life. She is trying to decide which college to attend for her MBA. She was extremely nice, and had a wonderful personality. I am sure she will be successful in whatever she attempts in life. After lunch, I started down the home stretch, and was thanking God for how perfect the day was. As I stopped for water, I heard my trail name of beavER. It was Steak and Wizard, 2 of the guys I had camped with the last 2 nights. We ended up at the end of the trail together. As we were there, the young ladies Sunny and Spice were there also waiting for their shuttle. We were all joking and laughing and remembering the fun and camaraderie. Just then, I looked up and saw their shuttle driver, it was Brett. The same guy that has shuttled Backwoods and I for the last 2 years. We gave each other the Covid high five and laughed that we were seeing each other 80 miles up the trail from where I stared a week ago.   From my hotel, I said goodby to Wizard as he was finishing up his section hike. About 30 minutes later, I bid Steak a “hope to see you up the trail” goodbye as he was off to do a few miles this evening. I have been blessed today, and I know it... sorry for all the words, I just want to record most of the highlights from today. -beavER","Steel Trap Gap

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633610,"My morning started with a slight panic, as I thought my glasses were lost at the last campsite. I finally found them close to the wall were I had knocked them off the bed the night before, whew! Today was to be a zero day (no hiking, only rest and preparation). After looking at the weather forecast for later in the week, I decided to get back to the trail. Forecast is to be nicer weather until Wednesday, then Thunderstorms Thursday. So, I begin hiking about 9:30. It was sprinkling, weather actually got better around 1:00. After the first quarter mile of hiking, I met a fellow who had laid his huge pack on the ground. I ask him how he was doing, and he began to admit having too much weight for his first backpacking trip. I encouraged him, and gave him some tips to help him. He then explained some of his unwanted weight was exotic beer cans that his coworkers in the brewing business had given him to take exciting trail pictures with the cans. You can guess what I suggested... but he said they were too good to just pour out. Later, I passed hiker “gourmet”, he had dehydrated all his food, he’s eating like a king (it took him a year to prepare all his meals) Another hiker was “Rerun”, he is from Michigan. He let out a big loud yell when we made the North Carolina border. One state down, 13 more to go! I past Muskrat shelter, were back in 2013, I lost a battle with the mice. The mice took the  draw strings for my backpack in the middle of the night. They like them for their nest. Another young man from New Jersey he has stopped about halfway up Sharp mountain, a really hard and steep climb. He was taking a smoke break. First time I had seen that in the trail. He has been having trouble with his knees he had taken a couple days off because of knee pain. Now he’s trying to do less miles, 8 to 12 miles per day.
Close to the end of the day, I was commenting to someone about the nice campsite spot they had. When I looked closer, it was Mitchell (Fireman), he offered to let me camp there, but I needed water, and had to go up the trail to get it. Just then, Steak and Patchwork came rolling in. It was like a reunion. Steak and I continued up the the trail about 3 more miles, and we found a good “Stealth” site to put up our tents right before a light rain started. (Stealth- site that is not a official camp location, but is ok to use if you follow guide lines). We had great conversation during dinner and after about a wide array of topics. We stopped as it starting getting cold and dark. I noticed the great view of stars and focused on Orion. -beavER","Dick’s Creek Gap

Short sleeves and shorts. I  broke out the sunscreen to keep from getting too much sun. I was able to get on the trail by 8:15 and hiked early part of the day with my friends Steak, from Washington, DC. and Fireman, from Greenville, S.C. The trail was dryer today, and not as many steep ups and downs. We stopped at a Shelter to take a lunch break, and Patchwork came in plus 3 other hikers we had been leapfrogging on the trail also stopped to break. I left right after finishing lunch because I wanted to call Backwoods Barbie since there was 2 bars for ATT. As I hiked, through a very nice trail area, Fireman caught up with me. We hiked the rest of the day together and did not see any of our other friends. They must have stopped short of us. Milestone of the day was going up Albert Mountain. It is 1000 feet straight up, with some hand over hand climbing. I remembered it from when Backwoods and I did it back in 2013. As you get to the top, there is a fire tower with the 100 mile mark written on the steps. Firemen and I were able to see the moon bow really well after dark. I called my grandsons, Thomas and John Luke to let them know I could see it on the trail.
I enjoyed great conversation with Fireman for many miles today... from the theater and Shakespeare to how Backwoods and I met. Good times on the trail. -beavER","Stealth Campsite before Standing Indian Shelter

As I was going up the first hill, I met Houdini. I saw Gandalf again, first saw her yesterday at the top of Albert Mountain. She has a hiking staff that looks like Gandalf’s. She is from Wisconsin. My friend Fireman caught me, and passed me heading to Winding Stair gap, to get off the trail to go to the city of Franklin to re-supply, so I might not see him again. I hope that I see him and Steak as they are great to spend time with. I passed through a Controlled burn area above winding stair gap. The forest service guys do this burn to prevent forest forest fires from spreading rapidly. It is sad looking, and lasted for at least 5 miles. Very heavy charcoal and smoke aroma.  I will post a pic of it. I also met Mr. clean from New York City. He’s in the theater. They have not been able to perform at all for the last year. He was letting me know how bad it has been for the residents of the city last year. One of the cool things that happen today- I went to the summit of Wayah Bald, which is marked by a large, stone observation tower. As I was coming down the steps, I noticed a colorful cloth object. It was a buff a hiker had lost. I decided to carry it ahead to see if I could return it to the owner. The next shelter was about 2 miles downhill from there. As I went in, I ask the first person that was camping there if he had lost a buff? He was the owner!  Easy Rider from Baltimore got reunited with his buff!

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633769,"A day like today is hard to know where to start. Last night, shortly after I had got in the tent, the rain started. It was steady, but not heavy. I wanted to get a early start, so at a few minutes before 6:00, I began to pack up. I have always wondered how I would handle the 2 most challenging tenting activities. Number 1, setting up a tent in the pouring down rain, and number 2, breaking down a tent in the pouring rain. My hiking buddies from home,   Yo-Yo and Turtle, and I, have set up tents in a bad storm before, so I know a little about that. After this morning, I am starting to get a little more comfortable with the sequence of getting all your stuff done in the rain. It is all about your timing of what happens first, and last. After I got on the trail, the rain stopped about 9:30 am. Not too cool, and it was misty and overcast. I met a hiker named Crocs. He has that trail name because he started out with his friends recommendation to use Nike trail running shoes that were a half a size too small (and they were on sale!). After three days, he couldn’t get his feet in them anymore, so he is wearing his multi color camp crocks until he can get to an outfitter. After the overcast cleared, it was a nice temperature day to hike. I decided to stop about 3 1/2 miles from the NOC on the way down, there I found a nice camp spot. It was a good place to set up my tent and let it dry out before I get into town, and also have my lunch. I was excited about getting to the NOC, but I started thinking, relax and smell the roses. That was something my new hiking friend Fireman reminded me of a few times. Another hiker came through, his trail name is Legs. He has a friend that’s a ridge runner. She said there’s gonna be really bad storms come in tomorrow with maybe possible tornadoes. Sounds like a good day to zero at the NOC.The last 3 miles down into the NOC was very enjoyable, the weather turned sunny with just a few scattered clouds. The views were spectacular, and I found myself taking photo after photo. After the last shelter there’s a slight uphill grade in the trail, the kind you enjoy as a hiker, because it’s not super steep, and you can just usually keep your same pace. It was really difficult for me, as I’m out of gas, tank is on E! After the last four days of 70 miles, I need a zero day to rest up. I know all the experienced hikers that are reading are saying the same thing I would say, that’s way too many miles this early...it’s hard too teach me anything, just ask Backwoods. I made it to the NOC with small flowers lining the trail. I was wanting to share with my friend Bryan B. from back home that I had made it because he loves this place. The kayaking adventures would be awesome here. The river and mountain setting makes this place special. I hit the Outfitters for my Resupply box, and the part that Jetboil had sent me to repair my stove (at no charge). I went to  River’s End restaurant for a cheeseburger and life is good. -beavER","Licklog Gap

The table settings are cool because your window is literally on the water. And the river is turbulent today. This is a zero day at the NOC, it’s 3 o’clock, and it is absolutely pouring down the rain with lightning hitting right outside the hostel where I’m staying. I’m glad I’m not trying to hike in this, you can’t even see the mountains around. Many hikers are coming in drenched and wanting a good shelter. One of my friends sent a selfie, while sunning himself at the beach close to his new Florida home. How bless we are to be able to pursue the desires in our hearts. I am so thankful to be able to be in this adventure. The first place I might go after my thru hike attempt could be to see my buddy in Fla. Of course, only if that is ok with Backwoods... I’ll need a hall pass! One thing about a zero day (if you have chores finished, like laundry, and grocery), is that there is plenty of time to “reflect”. That was part of Linda R.s “ghost hiker” journal daily quotation. Backwoods and I had the privilege of meeting ghost on her first AT thru hike attempt in May, 2015. Her story is so inspirational, but I will only hit some of the high points for the sake of space: She wanted to hike the Smokies after retiring from the Houston police force and moving to Tenn. When she finished the Smokies, she realized the love she had for this crazy backpacking thing. After getting a hall pass from her husband, she began her attempt to thru hike the whole trail... with zero planning! As she was hiking close to Monson, Maine, she slipped on wet rocks and got a hairline fracture on her tailbone. After 10 needed weeks to recover, she went back to the trail in October, and hiked from Fontana to Springer Mtn. That gave her half of the AT even with getting injured. She came back to the AT in 2017 and completed a SOBO (Southbound) thru hike from Maine to Georgia. 2018, she did the Pacific Crest Trail. 2019, the Continental Divide Trail, to complete the Triple Crown of backpacking. Now that’s getting back up when you have been knocked down! Ghost Hiker was one of the great people I have been blessed to meet on the trail. I hope to have a lasting impact on those I come across.

When it went off, I hit the snooze, rolled out in about five minutes and started packing. I met my goal of being out the door by six. Night hiking with headlamp. Funny things go through your thoughts while hiking in pitch dark, like- which side is my bear whistle on? After the first hour and 15 minutes, I had made 1100 feet up, and was able to turn off my headlamp, it’s was a beautiful morning. Temperature was nice. I was actually sweating coming up the hill. Getting higher, the temperature cooled slightly with the elevation change, and it felt really good. Shortly before 8 am, the sun burst forth on the trail, warming and brightening the path. I had made about half the elevation gain needed to accomplish the 3325 feet climb. I had beautiful views on each side of the ridge of the mountains with bright sunshine and low lying clouds below in the valley of Nantahala. I stopped to about halfway up at a beautiful waterfall to replenish my water supply. The constant rain for the last 16 hours had eliminated all trace foot prints on the trail. So far, my day had been the most challenging morning, but also, the most rewarding. A little over 2100 feet up, I came to the first great overlook of the NOC and the river. Then, the trail went straight up for about 200 feet. Right before getting to the shelter, I saw Chestnut burrs on the ground, and I realize there’s an old chestnut tree right there, what a blessing (almost all of the giant Chesnut trees died in a blight in the early 1900’s). As the trail near’s the summit of Cheoah Bald, the grade becomes steep. My adrenaline was kicking in as I was excited about reaching the summit. One last dig, every muscle in your body was demanding you quit and take a break, but I continued step-by-step. As I reached the plateau, I let out a yell like Rerun did a few days before as he crossed the Georgia/ North Carolina border. A quote came to mind as a put my foot on level ground on the top- Han Solo tells Luke, “great kid, don’t get cocky!” 
Later in the day as I reached Stecoah Gap, Smoky mountain Dave was doing trail magic. He had everything you could want for lunch, it was great. As we were talking, we discovered we both worked for the same company in Kentucky years before. Later, I found a great campsite and had a small fire.

With a new outlook, I hit the trail knowing my goal was to make as many dry miles as possible. Elevation inclines today were moderate, with largest climb of only about 750 feet. The downhills were the main thing on the menu. Ask any thru-hiker from 20-80, and they will tell you the downhills kill your knees. As I pressed on, the forecast continued to be revised, delaying the onset of the rain. I stayed dry all the way to the Fontana Hilton (double size shelter with many extra amenities, like a picnic area on the lake). As I approached the shelter, I heard someone whistling at me.... it was Backwoods. She had hiked up from the Fontana Dam parking lot to try to meet me... perfect timing. We hiked together back to the Dam. I wanted to hike all the way from the Visitors center parking to the trail head on the other side of the dam, another 1.5 miles. As I crossed the dam, the rain hit with a vengeance. Perfect ending to this portion of my hike. Backwoods being much smarter, drove the last portion. She did beep and wave.

The coolest task this week off was going to my work site for the last 32 years and dropping the mic. After I retired, I drove home a free man, wondering if I should just keep working until I die (don’t worry, if you are ever blessed to retire, you will understand after you do it, your mind will fight you every step of the way). When I arrived at my house, which was deathly silent because I was the only one there, I googled an old favorite, and played Free Bird by Lynyrd Skynyrd.- multiple times😎.
During our drive to New Found Gap, we had beautiful weather. At the Gap, we met Tom, from The Hike Inn. Last week when I got off the trail, we prearranged a ride with Nancy, who owns the Inn that only does business with Hikers. On the trip down the mountain, we were able to see a heard of elk up close. Backwoods and I love the Hike Inn. They have the Motel and grounds in mint condition. 
As we chatted with the very friendly Tom during our ride, he told us his story of how he went from a successful career in the Columbus, Ohio area, to a thru-hiker.He was able to benefit from all his years of dedication and hard work. And now is very content to assist Nancy and add his Midas touch to make things shine. We met hiker Thunder Chicken from Richmond, Va, and 2 other hikers with no trail names yet from Utah and Philly.

When we got to the Dam, the road was closed to traffic and you would not be able to get to the trail head by vehicle. That would mean that the 1.5 miles I did in the downpour last week would be for nothing as we would have to hike it again. I got out and ask the workers if we could get a hall pass.

One of the knocks on the Smokey’s is all the regulations about camping. Campers are forced to stay at only designated sites and no where else. I understand the concept and I don’t have any issues with it. The problem is they don’t have enough sites. This forces large groups of hikers together in very tight quarters. That was the case last night, with some that want to party being mixed in with ones that want to sleep. Let me just say that my lightest piece of equipment did a great job... ear plugs! Backwoods and I were able to get moving early and were hiking by 7:00. The trail today had many ups and downs. The main goal was to get up and over Rocky Top and Thunder Head Mountain. My good friend Scott W. (Watky) and I had done a section hike from New Found Gap to Fontana back in 2012. The trip was full of memorable experiences, like me going to the emergency room because I stabbed my hand. That’s where the “ER” of beavER was born. But the most memorable event was the climb up Thunderhead as we traveled south. It was brutal. Today, as we headed northward, it was strenuous, but no where close to the pain you feel going the opposite direction. We hiked with Thurber Chicken again today, and Utah and Philly. Many of the hikers we spent the night with last night are at this same shelter. Early in the day we came across a hiker that said his trail name was Rerun. About 5 minutes up the trail I looked at Backwoods Barbie and said, “I know that guy, he and I crossed the Georgia/ N.C. Border together!” I did not recognize him because of the beard and different jacket. Later, we were about a half mile past the summit of Rocky Top. The summit is a great place to rest after the long climb up. We had rested with a large group who were happy to have put the climb behind them and then moved on. As we were hiking, we heard a hiker yell out from the summit behind us in a joyous celebration.... I knew it was Rerun making it up. He eventually made it to our shelter to spend the night.

We were hiking early and were prepared for the rain. I was really thrilled that it stayed clear last night. The wind was blowing hard this morning, and you had a sense that bad weather was coming. As we hiked, the rising sun had a bright red glow as it peeked through the clouds. We arrived at the next shelter up the trail, and Thunder Chicken was just putting on her pack to leave camp. The hike up Clingmans seamed too easy as we ascended the 1200 feet. We were at the highest point on the whole AT, but that was not where my thoughts had drifted. I was retracing my steps of first backpacking journey with my hero Yo-yo. Yo-yo and I had started from Clingmans Dome, and headed to Silers Bald Shelter, for my first steps of Backpacking. My 70 plus pounds in my pack were so heavy I had to place my pack on Yo-yo’s tailgate to get my arms through the straps.... my first steps brought chills to my brain as a fear of failure suddenly gripped me.

I was up early and excited to hike the same stretch I did back in 2012. Back then, it was my first long backpacking trip at 34 miles. Right before I headed to the Smokey’s in July, 2012, I received a call from the National Parks to let me know that the Cosby Knob Shelter was closed. There had been aggressive bear activity. I got a text about 3 days ago saying the same thing. The impact to all of the hikers is huge. Normally, when you can stop at Cosby Knob, you can do a 8 mile hike from the closest shelter to Cosby. Then, the next day, about an 11 mile hike to get out. With the shelter closed, everyone that is hiking through, will need to do over 18 miles. Same this time for me as last time. The winds were brisk all morning as I hiked in bright sunshine. It was a morning where you needed a hat, jacket, and gloves. And that is where my adventure started.... Around 11:00, I stopped on a summit of a ridge to see if I had cell service to call Backwoods. The trail section was flat, but close to the edge of a steep drop off. I held the phone in my hand as I pulled off my glove, oops, I watched as the phone fell to the ground. It fell sideways, edge first. The corner hit squarely by my foot, then the phone shot, as if out of a cannon, straight off the edge. It was rolling as if it was a round wheel. Within seconds, it was over. I only saw the general direction it was headed. By the time I leaned over the cliff to look, there was nothing to see but a very steep downhill with scattered trees down the incline. I was in shock and my emotions hit me hard. I have all my trip plans on that phone, all my pictures from the weekend with the grandsons. They had not had time to load to the cloud, how do I contact Backwoods and my hiking friends? I broke. I needed help from above! I know it was a small thing, I could recover. I decided to do the crazy thing like I always do... I am going over this cliff to look for it. I put my poles in the ground to mark the spot the phone went off. They were too close to the edge, but I knew I would need to be able to see them from below to know if I were looking in the correct spot. My backpack was placed beside them. As I went over the edge, I held onto small trees, this helped me to keep from sliding down the hill. I found the area I hoped my phone had stopped. It was about 30 feet down... nothing. The mountain side was so steep that I knew the phone would have only stopped if by some chance of a miracle. It would have to hit a spot perfect... so I kept looking... God please help me! Me being stubborn, I would not give up looking. Down the hill I went, holding on, looking at every spot I hoped it could be... nothing. After about 1/4 mile of downhill, I gave up on the hope there was a ledge where it could have stopped. I could not even see where the downward slope ended, it seemed to continue for a mile. My heart sank, it was hopeless. I turned and started the accent. Please don’t ever try this yourself, especially by yourself. This is how people die. I made it back to the trail. As I approached my pack and poles, something inside told me to go back and look again at the first section 30 feet down. When I got back down... we’re my eyes playing tricks on me? There it was.. resting on a flat spot no larger than the phone. There was a straight down drop off directly below the nest my phone was in. My first thoughts, after praising Jesus, were I wish I could take a picture of this! As I started to reach for it, I realized there were a couple of small branches the size of wheat holding it from going over. I steadied myself before I reached for it, I knew if I made a sudden mistake, it would tumble to the forest floor. I slowly and gently cradled it in my hand. Needless to say, I had a praise service there on the trail. I sat there for a while. Later as I hiked, I really enjoyed, more than usual, the pictures I took. And I did call Backwoods! -beavER","Icewater Spring Shelter

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634792,"I awoke early, it was 5:00 am and I was starting the morning routine. After you are on the trail for a few weeks, you develop a sequence of what should be done first to last. As you sit up, let the air out of your blow up pillow, then put in your contact lens, and eventually you get to the last step of stuffing your shaken down tent into tour backpack. This morning the goal was to be hiking before sunrise by headlamp. At 6:20, I was leaving the shelter area in the darkness. The light on my forehead illuminated the path in the direction my head pointed. I saw a couple of hikers starting their morning sequence as I passed. The temperature was pleasant, and the forecast of gusty winds was wrong, as it was calm. I made good progress on my 18.1 mile goal to get out of the Smokey’s. One of the interesting things I passed today was a jet crash site close to Snake Den Ridge trail, and right by the AT. You would blow right by it if you did not know it was there. A RF-4C Phantom II crashed just meters from the AT in 1984. Many of the pieces of the jet are still there to be seen spread down the mountain side. Not far from the crash site, I met up with hiker Grandpa. He is about 32, and can really fly. He is almost finished with his 550 mile section hike which includes a large section of the Benton Mackaye Trail and the AT. We hiked together all the way to the Northern end of the Smokey’s. His speed helped me to step lively and we had great conversation for many miles. In the past, as I have reached the border of the GSMNP, there has been trail magic... today, nothing.. Of course, as I usually only think about myself, I felt saddened. My attitude began to brighten, about 2 miles later,  as I came to a opening that is close to I-40. Trail Magic, yes! A couple was doing trail magic because the had dropped their son off at Springer Mtn. one week before. They had a cooler full of sandwiches, drinks, snacks, fruit, all of which I enjoyed as I sat in a chair they provided under their tent canopy. A light sprinkling of rain drops was falling, it was perfect. From there, I had just over a mile to end at Standing Bear Farm. Standing Bear is a rustic, down home, laid back Hostel, with all the items you need as a hiker. Many of the 40+ hikers that were at Tri-Corner Knob Shelter the night before continued to show up as the day went on. I enjoyed getting to know each person better as I was able to socialize during the evening. 2 couples I had the best conversations with were Pinch & Pistol, and Speed Bump & Trail Light. Pinch & Pistol’s story of their previous attempt to thru-hike was riveting for me. They eventually had to end their 2018 hike around the1400 mile mark, because of a lack of funds and a setback because of a sickness. I will pray that they are successful this go around. But my favorite couple that I have been blessed to hike with so far is Speed Bump and Trail Light. They are a joy to be around and brighten your day when you have time to talk. Backwoods and I first met Speed Bump climbing up Rocky Top on our 2nd day in the Smokey’s. I was sad to hear that this is their jumping off point. They are going to switch from a thru- hike attempt, to a section hike approach in the future. And to think that I used to view the trail as a pathway... it is a journey to discover the personalities of my neighbors! I will miss them, but I hope to stay in touch. The trail has a way of bonding our souls together. -beavER","Tri-Corner Knob Shelter

Many of the hikers I came in with yesterday moved on this morning and headed North. I wanted to stay here because I am a day ahead of schedule from the long hiking day yesterday. I have plans to meet up with my hiking friends on Friday afternoon. I was able to relax and talk with hikers, but most of all... rest my body. I don’t feel as if I need to, but one of the young guys I talked to, has been here for 5 days, recovering from a messed up ankle. The big event for the day was saying goodbye to Speed Bump and Trail Light. Mid morning, they were loading into a shuttle, to head to the airport to get a rental car. They would drive back to their home from there. Trail Light and I discussed how much the trail helps you appreciate the small things you take for granted in life. One example: you can go to a kitchen faucet and turn a knob, and clean water comes out... and you don’t need to filter it. We shared a short hug before they were chauffeured away. I had another great conversation with Pinch. He told me about the mistake he made on the trail yesterday. Because of the big miles he and Pistol had to hike yesterday, they had decided to bypass one of the coolest Fire-towers I have ever seen. Mount Cammerer’s tower is a 30 foot stone and wooden structure, built in 1937. Hikers can enter the firetower and walk around the octagonal railing for incredible panoramic views of the Smokey Mountains.  The side trail to see it would add 1.6 miles to there total for the day. He mistakenly took the side trail to the tower without knowing it until they arrived. While he and Pistol were enjoying the views, 4 Air Force jets roared by the tower at his eye level, about 50 meters away. They dove down into the valley of the mountains and then pulled up in pairs, straight up as if rockets. Once they were at a high altitude, they formed a V pattern and flew overhead and out of site. At the time he saw the jets, I was a few miles ahead. I heard them, but could not see them, because of the tree line. As he shared his story, I could not help thinking about the Pilot and Navigator that died in the 1984 crash. -beavER","Standing Bear Farm

It was beautiful morning as I was comfortable just wearing short sleeve shirt and shorts. I was able to talk with hiker Pinch this morning. We had a good conversation about life in general. Also, we discussed mentors and people to help give you advice along life’s way. Pinch lost his dad too soon in life. Came across the trail runner going downhill with a good pace, but I noticed he had on long hiking pants. That seemed strange because of the nice weather. When he was close enough to talk, I asked him how he doing? He said, not too good! He left his water bottles in the truck that shuttled him. Now,  he will go back down the trail to retrieve his water bottles, because the one thing you need for sure out here his water. My original plan for the day was to stop at Brown Gap. It was about the 10 mile mark. After I checked it out, I decided to move on. It was too close to the road and I just did not have a good feeling about the surroundings. I did cross over Max Patch mountain, it is famous for its panoramic views. Many hikers had set up tents on the summit to catch sunset an sunrise. The wind was too strong and cold for me. The forecast calls for it to drop to 36. The shelter I stopped at has some good tent spots, and is protected better from the breeze. So far, I only see 2 people from Standing Bear here. They are The Last Boy Scout & RAM Chops. RAM Chops had an interesting story as she was a boxer. She pursued making the last Olympics, USA team. She finished #7 overall in her weight class.

The trail this morning was gently rolling, and very easy to hike. Almost all dirt and soft terrain versus the rocks of most the Smokies. I made to Lemon Gap (way early) and decided to hike on up to check out Walnut Mountain Shelter’s tent spots. Also, I took lunch there and talked with some thru-hikers and then came back down the lemon gap to wait on my friends. My nephew Chad is driving in from Lake Norman area of N. Carolina. My good friend Watky is driving up from Jacksonville, Fla. A young friend, Mingo, that I have worked and hiked with is coming from Huntsville, Ala. A salesman friend, Flower Child, is coming from  Northern Ky. The rest of the crew is coming from Georgetown, Ky. Scout Daddy, Phillip, Mike G, and the infamous Turtle. I am so excited that these guys are teaming up with me to enjoy this section to Hot Springs. I couldn’t wait to see everyone... so you know what that means... I needed patience because they had some difficulties and were a few hours late. All was good as everyone was at the Shelter tent site by dark. We saw a beautiful sunset on the way up. Everyone had a good time laughing and the guys that were here earlier had a fire going. Once everyone was set up and had hung there food bad, we went to get water by headlamp. Nobody was ready to cut the fireside stories short, but we had to do so if we want to hike the ten miles tomorrow to get to our next shelter. We headed to our tents around 11:00.

(Like hiking in Arizona’s dessert in August with almost no water).   The trail was awesome for views and comfortable walking. We found a campsite area opposite the shelter, with enough room for all 9 of our tents.    As we hiked today, the big event was walking up on trail magic at Garenflo Gap. It was as good as it gets, with a Trail Magic family cooking cheeseburgers and waffles on 2 different grills. They had bacon, chips, brownies, drinks, and almost everything a hiker could wish for.    The family was there because of the son. He had thru-hiked the trail in 2015. He shared with his parents about how cool trail magic was for him during his hike. The family did this once before, and decided to do it again, since they have their Covid vaccine’s.    The shelter across from our campsite is full.

This is a result from his trouble sleeping.    We began our short and easy hike into town, and everyone seemed very satisfied with our hiking experience. Many pictures were taken by the crew of views with sun drenched mountains and valleys.    One young lady thru-hiker had called our group “the Train” yesterday. It was because the 9 of us cover a long section as we walk. We entered town around 10 am, and realized we could have taken more time to sleep in this morning. No restaurants were open until eleven.    Hot Springs is the first Trail Town the AT actually enters. As you walk the Main St. sidewalk, you see “AT” symbols embedded in the concrete to mark the trail.    We were able to get a table to seat all of us, and we enjoyed a great lunch.

The climb up was enjoyable as the trail has switchbacks in the steep sections.  I enjoying the views and the beautiful morning. As I hiked, I was thinking about Last night at the Hostel. I had chance to talk to “One Day Lost”. I’ve been hiking with her a couple days. She’s been having a lot of trouble with her backpack. She finally figured out what was going on with the support system that’s causing it to tilt sideways on her when she would be walking along. Her trail name is “one day lost” because early in her hike she got lost on the trail. She made a wrong turn and couldn’t find her way back so she began to go down the mountain until she found a stream. And then she followed the stream for miles and eventually disaster struck. She fell into the water he got soaked around 5 o’clock in the evening. She found a little flat rock by the water’s edge she could climb up onto. She laid her clothes out and dried them on the limbs that were around the rock. Then she got her sleeping bag out and got in it and slept there all night until the next morning. After the sleep, she continued hiking down stream in till she found an old abandoned campground. There was an older gentleman there with two German Shepherd’s. He told her he was looking for honey. He led her back to the trail, it was miles away. What a close call! That is the way most people die out here. I ran into other hikers today that I know and I met new ones at the shelters as I stopped for lunch and finally to camp. Everyone at tonight’s shelter are very friendly.

Not far from this section, you arrive at “Big Butt Mountain”. I did take a picture of one of the funniest signs of the AT. I will try to post when I get better cell signal.

It woke me up at 2:30 and 4:30 am. The terrain of the trail was much more Rocky today, similar to the Smokey’s.

I did not realize just how similar it would become. I used the memories of the last trip up to fuel my steps. It worked great most of the way up as I thought about the frigid heavy rain and hail that pelted us last time. When we arrived at the Roan Mountain Shelter in 2015, it was a safe Harbour that helped Backwoods recover from near hyperthermia. About two thirds the way up, the memories started turning into a nightmare. It was if I had gotten into a time machine and travelled back 6 years. The only thing that was different was this time no lightening was striking the trees around me. I was thankful for that missing piece. But I was just as cold, the rain and high wind gusts took my body core temperature below safe levels.

The surprise from him was a gift he gave to us (trail magic), it was a wooden plaque  with the AT blaze and symbol on it, and the phrase “Wild, Brave, and Free”. He wanted to give us a gift because he said he had lost his dad 10 years ago, and seeing me and Britt made him think about the good times he spent with his father. Needless to say, I had something in my eye, and so did Britt. Must be dust floating around! 
Britt took me to the trail head and I gave her a big hug. She ask the Lord’s blessing on my hike, and she was gone. I was following the blazes. I was somewhat in a fog, caused by shock, how could this have been so wonderful? I could never have planned it to be so. As I hiked away, I pondered the conversations I had with Britt the day before. Early in the hike this morning, I came to a spot in front of a local Baptist Church, on a rural road. It was a place, where 2015, Backwoods and I said goodbye to a couple that decided to end their Thru-hike. Soon after that, I made another milestone, as I passed the 400 mile mark. I stopped for lunch at a beautiful waterfall name Jones Falls. As I continued hiking I met a section hiker doing a slack pack. His name is Dan. Dan is retired Army. We quickly became short term hiking buddies. He noticed my accent and ask where I was from. And then he ask if I could guess his home, I said New Jersey! Right, how could you tell, was his question? I told him the my son-in-law is from Jersey, and you sound just the same. We hiked together for about 8 miles and had great conversation. I think we solved all the world’s problems. I was blessed to meet his young daughter at the trail head where he was stopping for the day. Dan and I settled on “Turnpike” for his trail name, and I gave his daughter the trail name “Stealth”. The trail is about the people. -beavER","US 19E

Most of the hikers I talked to today were going to hostels. There is rain predicted for tonight. I am tenting as the forecast says rain will start around 9:00 and end by 4:00 am.... we will see, you know how my last experience turned out with the rain. A hiker I crossed paths with today was Ramble On. He is about 28 and has a pleasant personality. We were able to cross paths a couple of times today and yesterday. 
The 2 most memorable events today was me stopping at Laurel Fork Falls, and climbing up and over Pond Mountain. I stopped at the falls to have lunch. That was really special to me because when Backwoods and I hiked this section in 2015, we did not stop there for more than 2 minutes. There is a whole back story that I think is worth telling, but let me only say that I got a chewing out big time at that spot. So today, I really enjoyed taking my sweet time to relax and eat. As you hike downstream from the falls, you walk on a ledge that is just inches from the water. If you were to fall in, you would go downstream quickly... cool right? I will try to load a video of the short walk by the waters edge. The hike up and over Pond Mountain is notable because it is 1800 feet straight up and down. I decided to camp close to the bottom of the mountain to try to avoid any extra wind from the storm tonight. -beavER","Stealth Campsite mile 411.3

The rain had stopped around 4:30 am, and the sun helped dry my tent of the remaining moisture as I took a little extra time before I packed it up. The last few days have been beautiful areas to hike through. This morning’s hiking was par for the course. Shook Branch Recreation Area is the first area I walked through. It is a nice beach and picnic spot on Watauga Lake. The trail skirts around the lake for miles with many places you can access the water. Eventually, you cross the dam and hike away from the shores. But as you climb, you have great views of the lake and marina. Today was another day where I only saw a few thru-hikers. When I arrived at the Iron Mountain Shelter, there was only one other hiker staying here. His name is “Longevity”. We had great conversation through out dinner. He has been similar to me in the way he has gotten off the trail multiple times. This causes you to be way behind hikers you have become friends with. Then you start all over making new ones. We both wanted to get in our tents early and complete our journal entries before the cold air hits tonight. Forecast is for 36 for the low.

Ramble On had joined Longivity and I at the shelter last night. It was just us 3 hikers there. Ramble On had got word that there was Trail Magic 4.7 miles down trail from the shelter. Longivity and I headed out quickly as it sounded too good to be true. We hiked at a quick pace and soon arrived at the spot. It was the trail head on Tennessee route 91. It was true! A couple was there doing the magic. Indoorsy and Mosey from Indiana. Mosey was going to section hike from US 19E to Damascus, starting Monday. That is the 75 mile stretch I am on now. So they decided to do a great trail magic for the hikers before she starts. The had a grill, and Indoorsy was cooking pancakes, eggs, and sausage links. They had donuts and fruit, plus drinks. It was awesome. Other hikers that ate breakfast while I was there were Kiki and Puff, and their dog Hutch. Also, Ramble On, and Longivity. Not more than 20 minutes north from the trail magic breakfast from the Indiana gang, some  ladies from Tennessee gave me a banana.  Then for my 3rd trail magic of the day, about 3:00, I was given a ice cold water and an orange from a couple from Michigan. The couple had been day hiking and saw me looking to refill my water from a roadside source. They were very nice and we talked about Michigan, Kentucky, the Derby (which was run today) and the Appalachian Trail. I enjoyed the time we were able to share. I ended the day by having dinner with Longivity, and then I hiked another 5 miles past the shelter where he and Kiki and Puff stopped.

About 2 miles into my hike, I crossed the Virginia /Tennessee state line. I have now completed three states Yeehaw. As the trail enters Damascus from the woods, you actually walk straight onto a city subdivision road. As you follow the blazes, you soon arrive at the city park. There is a wooden archway to walk through that welcomes you. The park is pleasant and it leads to a small workhorse train engine and caboose that are on display. From there the trail turns toward the downtime area and past Churches, shops, and outfitters. Some of the bicycle rental shops were busy this morning transporting customers to ride the Virginia Creeper trail. I made my way to the Methodist Church Hostel. It is the longest operating hostel on the entire AT. The first hikers stayed here in 1974. I was there early as I wanted to get a shower so I would not be stinky for the Church Service. I could not check in until 2, so no shower. I also received word that the Methodist minister was out due to back problems. A young couple and I decided to head the Baptist church next door on recommendations from a local source. We were not disappointed when we arrived at their outdoor service. Great singing and the sermon was nice. It was on Moses and how God called him. Backwoods sent me a text and called me a “chicken”. She said you will use the Methodist shower, but you won’t go to their service! After church, I hurried over to the Damascus Diner to eat as I heard they would close at 2:00. I ran into Longevity there and we headed over to the outfitters after eating as he needed to buy new hiking shoes.

I did not need to rush to pack up, I could ease into the morning and waste time relaxing since the only milestone for the day would be a huge hug for my beautiful wife. I visited with Bayou, the caretaker of “the Place” the Methodist Church hostel. I watched most of the hikers pack up and head out as they had nice weather. I did not care that I was missing a chance to get miles under my feet before the round of rain hits tomorrow and for the next few days. She rolled in about 10:00 and she received the greeting I had planned for her. We visited there for awhile relaxing and taking pictures before heading to meet Longevity at the Broken Fiddle hostel. I wanted her to meet the gentleman I had enjoyed hiking with for the last week. Backwoods ask him if he’s would like a haircut since she had her hair supplies with her. She is a hairdresser and had brought the tools of her trade to do my hair. Longevity took her up on the offer and he said his mother would be happy to see him with his hair trimmed up. Another young hiker there took a “trail magic” hair cut from backwoods Barbie. After the trims, we headed to our Bed and Breakfast to check in. Backwoods had reserved the Millsap-Baker Estate Bed and Breakfast for us to stay the next 2 nights. The place is great, with Victorian furnishings all throughout the house. We fell in love with the house as soon as we walked in. We had a nice stroll along the steam that runs through town, and enjoyed each other company as we visited shops in town.

We started to run out of time as we had an appointment at the Blue Blaze bicycle rental shop. They took us up the mountain to let us ride back down to town on the Creeper Trail. The trail is a Rails to Trails path that was created by using an old railroad track bed. The trail is very well known and is a great way to relax and enjoy the mountain and forest views as you coast down the pathway. Half of the over 15 miles of riding does not require any pedaling. We stopped and enjoyed breaks on the way. We were glad that we packed our rain jackets as the last 30 minutes of the ride included a downpour. We went back to the Bed and Breakfast Estate were we are staying and cleaned up. Backwoods was able to do some shopping as I worked on chores and later my resupply tasks. The Damascus Diner was the hot spot for dinner, and we enjoyed visiting other hikers. As we were headed back to settle on for the evening, I told backwoods to pull over because I recognized a 2 hikers coming out of the Family Dollar. I jumped out of the passenger side and shouted “hey Squeeze, hey Solar, it’s beavER!” I was able to introduce Backwoods to the friends I had made back at the Nature’s Inn Hostel at Sam’s Gap.

From there it goes up a set of stairways and it takes you into the woods. Anytime you’re in town, the trail out is always going to be up and up. Soon you sense that sounds of the city, the delivery trucks with their Diesel engines, slowly start to fade and then the sounds of songbirds begin to fill your ears. I had 2 fresh baked chocolate chip cookies in my pocket from the Millsap-Baker Estate. It did not take long before they were calling my name. I did my best to not dwell on the fact that I was missing Backwoods already as she was driving back to Kentucky as I hiked away from Damascus. She had let me out at the Methodist Church, and we hugged and parted without me getting anything in my eye. (Sometimes that’s hard for me to do). 
It did not take me long to forget about sad moments as the mornings cold rain began to take control of my thoughts. Today’s rain was worse than the forecast, and it continued until about 3:30. I stopped at Saunders Shelter after about 9 miles to get in out of the rain and have lunch. I ran into Longevity there with  Pinto. They were stopping there for the evening. They will be cutting back on there miles to pace there self’s for when Longevity will be stopping to get off the trail for a week.

They brightened my day in just the few minutes we were able to visit. I hope to see them again tomorrow. Once I made it to Lost Mountain Shelter, I ran into Pegasus.

 The morning started out with rain in the middle of the night. Snow was forecast, but I did not stick my head out to check. It was very cold. I’ve got a short window of no rain at about 7 o’clock, so I broke camp and headed out. The first couple hours was a cold rain with mist and wind. Around 11 o’clock the weather began to break with some blue skies with sunshine and clouds. Temperature became comfortable around noon. There’s a very confusing section of the trail where there’s a bypass of Comers Creek Falls because of a bridge thats out. If the water is high, you can’t cross the stream. I wanted to stay on trail and not take a bypass, so I decided to chance it. I was guessing about a 50/50 chance since it had rained this morning. I hoped the stream would be low enough to go across on the boulders. My mind started running through all the scenarios of what could go wrong, like what will happen to your cell phone when you fall in... I was correct and did not have to ford the high water, and it was very easy to cross over. As I tried to understand this section’s trail markings, I was worried about the confusion caused by the terrible markings. Yesterday, when I came out of Grayson Highlands, the trail markings were also confusing. I went the wrong way for about a half a mile. After I didn’t see any white blazers for half a mile, I got suspicious and turned around and  backtracked. I had gone a mile out of my way for nothing.

As I reached the top of the climb, the trail turned into a nice section of open meadows with great views. Around midday, the trail switched gears into a technical rocky section as it followed the ridges. My shoes and feet are still trying to recover from the rocks of Mt. Rogers and Grayson Highlands.

And then half mile down the hill from there was Trail Magic. The father of a young hiker was doing the magic. He said his son was 2 days behind us. I was too stuffed to eat any homemade pancakes. After I left, I told myself that I should have just sit down and waited awhile so I could eat at least one. The mile stone for the day was passing the 600 mile mark. Seems like I just went past the 500 mile mark. As I passed Virginia Route 611, at Trail mile 600.6, there is a memorial to the ex-soldier, Ronald S. Sanchez Jr., that was killed there on May 11, 2019. It was a somber day for me as I replayed the details of his last day from the details I have learned. I have a hiking friend that was in the middle of the tragic events as they unfolded those dark days on the trail. I sent her a text to let her know I was thinking about her. She was brave enough to get back on the trail and finish in 2019. That is when Backwoods and I had the privilege of meeting her as we were hiking north of here. I will keep her story to myself for now. 
 The trail itself had been really nice today, mostly dirt, but no not many rocks or roots. The last 4 miles did get more rocky and technical.

Once you’re on top you can put your feet in the ice cold water as it rushes by. There are rock formations that resemble seats that make great places to sit and let the water revive your your feet.

They came rolling down the hill, at a fast clip, at least 2 were the size of a basketball. They passed over the spot on the trail I would’ve been if I had not stopped to get my camera out. There was a good chance they could had hit me. Thank you Lord that did not happen. When I first heard the sound of the small avalanche, I was thinking, why are the deer running back down this way? Then I thought, it sounds like their stumbling! But it was actually the rocks rolling and bouncing. It reminded me of the Star Wars scene where the Ewoks are attacking the Storm Troopers with rolling rocks. The deer are fighting back. The first 8 miles of the trail was very enjoyable, mostly was flat and not too many roots, and almost no rocks. Very nice hiking condition. Met “lallygag” at Wapiti Shelter. She was very nice and was doing section from Bland to Pearisburg. Her name fit her (so she says) because she was just packing up. Around noon, I saw a couple slack packing south, and I’ve seen the same couple two days before. So I asked if they were the same people? Reply was, “yeah, we are leapfrogging cars.” So, what that means is they are hiking north but every step they take is south. They always go back to the 2nd car from north to south. And then they will get in the car they hike to, and drive it about 10 to 15 miles past the car they left that morning. Then the next day, they’ll hike south, back to the car they they drove the day before. It is tons of work, but you don’t sleep on the trail, and you always have transportation. Also, you always o my have a day pack. I met 5 more backpackers today, 1 gentleman, and 4 additional ladies. The ladies won today. I stopped at a great stealth spot by Pearis Ledges. It had a great sunset and I hope to have an awesome sunrise as I am close to the Ledge. In the morning, I head downhill to Pearisburg. -beavER","Trent’s Grocery

I didn’t have to rush this morning, as I only had less than 4 miles to get out, so I took my time and enjoyed breakfast. When I got down to Route 100, the Angels rest shuttle driver named Pan came to pick me up. Once I got to the Hostel, I saw Colonel, Double Take, and Clean Plate. Today’s goal was to resupply, wash clothes, make equipment repairs, shower, make short term hike plans for this coming week, and eat at local restaurants to get more protein. Clean Plate let me use her needle and thread to repair some tears. Later in the afternoon, Woodie showed up as he is staying here also. Two nice ladies that go by the team name “Wandering Dames” are also staying here. I was able to meet them yesterday on the trail. We three went to the local Mexican restaurant for lunch and had fun talking about cabins and our lives outside of hiking. Woodie and I went to the Dairy Queen for dinner... I wanted a blizzard. We also enjoyed a great conversation. Today’s Nero has been good for me. I feel recharged and look forward to making it to the triple crown next week. Dragon’s Tooth, McAfee Knob, and Tinker Cliffs.

I would not rush to get on the trail and put thousands of steps between beavER and Pearisburg on the way to my next resupply… Instead, I would relax and head to a local church since it is Sunday. I would worry about hiking miles after I have my spirit replenished. I chose a local Baptist Church that was a 15 minute walk from the hostel. A drizzle was coming down as I borrowed an umbrella and used google maps to navigate through the unfamiliar downtown neighborhoods and businesses. As I approached the church building, I realized from the sign that the Church is now LifePoint Giles Community Church. The preacher was outside and welcomed me in to listen to the worship band rehearsing for the service. I met his wife and found out they are both from Kentucky. Louisville and the Pikeville area respectively. Bob Stockburger was the pastor. I enjoyed the music and the service. The message was good for me to here and apply. After service I went back to the Hostel to catch my shuttle back to the trail head, Virginia Rt. 100. When I got to the Hostel I saw Tejas and Zey. I hadn’t seen them since Damascus. It was really good to see the father-son tandem, and talk with them. Tejas seems like an old friend of mind. When I started hiking at 1:00, I had to cross to the big long bridge that goes across the New River. As I was finishing up the last bridge section that crosses a railroad track, I heard a train. My instinct was telling me to go back to the center in the case it was coming toward me. I was able to time it just right to video the train going under me. I love trains, so I was excited. As I started the long climb up and out of Pearisburg, I saw Colonel and Double Take slack packing South. They were doing 20 miles today. I passed Hanzel and Gretel again today. They are the ones going north, but hiking south by using 2 cars. I got to see the Wandering Dames again today, this makes 3 days straight. Their trail names are Scallion and Little Junco. They stopped at the campsite 5 miles back from where I stopped. The campsite where I made it to is small, and I am the only one here. Weather was a slight drizzle for most of the day, and forecast calls for rain all day tomorrow. -beavER","Pearisburg- Angel’s Rest Hostel

Before the rain hit, the morning started with a little warmer temperatures and about 8:30, the sun came out and it’s was a very enjoyable hiking morning. Between 9 & 10 o’clock I passed around 30 people there were slack packing South. I think many were from Angel’s Rest Hostel. I did get to see Tejas and Zey. They were in the first group of 10. The hostels love for you to slack pack back to their place. It guarantees that you stay another night. I got messed up when the trail came to a really nice fishing stream. The markings weren’t very good and I went about a half mile the wrong way. Once the rain started, it started feeling cooler. The rain intensified and the trail became rocky. The rocks and rain lasted until about 4. I was happy when it stopped raining because I was sensing that my body’s core temp was dropping. I started to shiver, and I knew I would need to stop and add more layers. Right about that time, the rain subsided. About an hour before the rain stopped, I passed the Colonel and Double Take as they were slack packing also. I decided to push on to a campsite that was at the top of a steep climb, with elevation increase of 1700 feet. My hope was that it would have good cell service for ATT. It did not have any bars….

I will try to do tomorrow. It rained overnight, and the rain stopped about 4 am. Condensation built up inside the tent, but everything stayed dry. The campsite was very close to where an old fire tower had been. You could see the concrete foundation from the fire tower. The AT actually goes right through the middle of the foundation. A Forest Service person had to be up on the mountain to man a visual inspection for fires. Think how much things have changed, a few years before, you had to have a man stationed up here all day long in case there was a fire. Now, I’m hiking, if I can find a signal, I will call my wife back in Kentucky. She can text me the the bills that are due, and I can go online and pay the bills and balance my checkbook from up on top the mountain, while I’m hiking the Appalachian Trail. Today, I found the first four leaf clover on the trail. Finding 4 leaf clovers reminds me of my grandma Parker. She could find them easily, and I think the gift was passed to me. I Met Papa Crystal and Crystal. Crystals is a Siberian husky. I also met a young lady named Pluto. She is 18 and graduated early so she could do the hike. Her classmates had their ceremony yesterday.  She celebrated by doing a 20 mile day. I decided to camp at a stealth spot by the Audie Murphy Memorial spur trail. Audie was the most decorate WWII veteran. He was also an actor and died in a plane crash close to the memorial on Brush Mountain. Many family members have left tributes to their fallen loved ones around Audie’s memorial. It is almost overwhelming to take it all in. The trail climb up to the Audie Murphy memorial was a steady climb and not real aggressive so I made the 1500 foot elevation increase go easier. Before I started up the climb, I saw Crystal and Papa Crystal, they had really good campsite down to bottom of the mountain. It would’ve been nice to stay down there and put the climb off till tomorrow. But I wanted to get to the top to see if I had cell service. I did, which made me happy as I could call Backwards and let her know I’m alive. Had a great campfire and was blessed to talk to good friends and BWB on the phone.  -beavER","John’s Creek Mtn.

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637489,"Since I was close to the Audie Murphy Memorial, when I got up and going this morning,I went up to the benches by the memorial, and had some reflection time. I also read some scripture. It really makes me appreciate what people have done to give me freedom in this country and be able to hike on the Appalachian Trail without concerns. The morning hike was very nice and I saw hikers that I had been running into for the last couple days. There were a couple big milestones today, number one was crossing the 700 mile mark as I was going up the climb to Dragon’s tooth. The climb is very technical, very steep, and very long, and it was as bad as I remembered. But I was pacing myself to try to stay up with some guys that were faster than me so that I would have some other people at Dragon’s tooth at the same time I was there. My goal for several several weeks has been to try to climb Dragon’s tooth if it was safe enough for me to do it. I do not have a fear of heights, so as long as it’s safe enough for me to scale it, I wanted to try. But I need someone there to take the pictures. When I arrived, I looked up and saw my hiking friend Woody climbing up on the monolith. I yelled hey Wiody, do you want me to take your picture. He was surprised that someone on the ground knew his name. I was able to climb it and make sure to keep a steady foothold because it is very high and you are on a very small surface. I did the dab dance move for my grandson John Luke because he loves it. Coming down off of Dragon’s tooth is just as bad as going up it’s very technical and you must be very careful of your foot placements because it is treacherous. It’s just as bad coming down as it is going up. I eventually made my way to 4 Pines Hostel, which is where Backwoods Barbie and I had stayed back in 2019. It is a laid-back Hostel which is donation only. A gentleman named Joe Mitchell owns it. He’s had some medical problems over the last year and he needs some prayer.

I probably won’t get to see him for a couple weeks because he’s doing bigger miles and I’m not. I have a friend of mine Duane M. He is meeting me at a campground in a few days, so I can’t get ahead. I have to pace myself to not do too many miles. Today, Pluto and I have been hiking about the same speed. We got up to McAfee Knob about the same time, we got pictures of each other on the cliff.

I awoke before alarm went off to get ready for the climb back up to back up to McAfee Knob to watch the sunrise. The climb takes about 20 minutes to hike up there from the camping area. What a gorgeous sunrise. In the overlook area where I took my position, there was a family with some young kids, between probably 9 and 14, wanting to watch the sunrise. We weren’t disappointed, it was beautiful. I hiked back down after the sunrise, had breakfast, and packed and headed out. I still was on the trail by 8:00 am. Beside the sunrise chasing, this morning the milestone was to hike Tinker Cliffs. It’s a section of hiking along a 1/2 mile stretch right by the edge of rock formations and cliffs. It’s a beautiful area. When Backwoods and I hiked it in 2018, she said “why would they put the trail so close to the edge of the cliff?” I said, “because they can! It’s awesome.!” Today, many local hikers are coming up, since it is the beginning of the weekend. This is one of the most popular areas on the whole Appalachian Trail. I took a short break and called Backwoods from one of our favorite campsites from 2018. I kept an eye out for any signs of a bear. There has been reports of an aggressive bear in this area. I did not see any signs of it. I filled up on water as I had to hike the next 8.5 miles without any water refill points. And today was hot, and I needed plenty of water. I ran into Papa Crystal & Crystal headed south, they were slack packing. I also passed “Scorched Earth Gap”, it’s one of the most interesting names of a gap that you see on the whole trail.

I started the day by meeting Double Take and the Colonel for breakfast at the barbecue restaurant. Yes, breakfast at a BBQ place. I spent most of the day resting. My original plan was to hike out this morning, but Double Take talked me into zeroing. I am glad I did now. I realize my body needed more rest after slowing down today. When you are hiking, you can get trapped into thinking that cranking out miles is the most important thing… but it is most certainly not. This adventure is the “ultra extreme marathon.” Anyone in this marathon must be flexible and understand it is 180 days of intense physical demand being absorbed by our bodies. We went to the nearby Mexican restaurant for dinner and I learned about a new app that helps show a 3D recap of the day’s hike. I will start using it tomorrow and try to share it as soon as I figure out how. A funny thing happened after dinner: As we walked back to the hotel, we saw a group of 5 young hikers standing in a circle by the doorway. We recognized a few of them and exchanged greetings with smiles and laughs. They all seemed to be enjoying the cooler evening air and friendly conversations. One of the guys has the trail name “DQ”, short for Drama Queen. The Colonel no sooner said the words, “margaritas are 1/2 off at the restaurant!” The 5 young hiker in sync, perked up, spun around, smiled from ear to ear, and all bolted away from us toward the Mexican restaurant at a fast clip. I wish I had a video. But I did take a pic as they marched in unison down the drive. The big concern for us over the next week is the heat. Forecasts are showing temps around 90.

It is about a mile walk so we met at 7 o’clock to head to breakfast. After breakfast, I got all my gear together and was ready to check out. I ask the front desk to watch my backpack while I was walking to a local church. The church is about 8/10 of a mile up the road. So today I’m getting about 3.6 miles of walking before even hitting the trail but it’s worth it for a good breakfast and a good worship service. Ghost Hiker would be proud, this makes five weeks in a row I’ve been blessed where I could make it to a Sunday service. I attended the Daleville Baptist Church. The sermon was good, and his last point was “do you trust that the Lord will supply for you needs?” I though as he expounded on that point, “I really need a ride back to the hotel, 8 tenths of a mile from here!” As soon as his final prayer was over, a woman came up and introduced herself. As soon as she realized I was a thru-hiker, she said, “I am going to give you a ride where ever you need!” Today’s my aunt’s and my son’s birthdays, so I made calls to wish happy birthday. As I was leaving the hotel to start the hike, I heard someone yell out “beavER!”, and I turned around saw it was Clean Plate. She was sitting under a shade tree waiting for friends. We talked and caught up on what the last weeks events. Later in the day, I caught up with Highlander and My Lady at the water refill stream. They have been off the trail for a while as they went to a wedding. This was the first time I’ve seen them since Hot Springs. The trail conditions were good today. Very few roots and almost no large rocks. The elevation grades when you’re going uphill were not extremely steep, so it’s been a good day for hiking up. There were multiple uphill climbs today. I got to the shelter and weather conditions were nice. A breeze cooled you down, and the partial sunshine felt comfortable, so I decide to push on to make more miles.

Duane was able to hike with us the first 4 miles of the trail this morning. Once we started hiking, we stopped to take a break at Bryant Ridge Shelter. It is a great shelter. It reminds you of a cabin instead of a shelter. While we were there, Double Take made up his mind to get off the trail at the same spot that Duane was going to take the blue blaze trail back to the Campgrounds. Nothing prepares you to see someone you are enjoying hiking with leave the trail. Colonel and him have hiked every step of the trail, about 760 miles together.

We were hiking by 7:10 and all seemed well. Forecast had pushed the rain chances back to after 7:00 pm, and everyone was hoping we would not get any. Early in the day, we had some sprinkles that lasted long enough for us to cover our packs. Today was another day of huge climbs. We had to go up 2,700 feet as soon as we started hiking to get to the top of Bald Knob. There were many more climbs today. Once we got to the top of the climb we ran into Chewy and Slingshot, they were slack packing, and they had some trail magic. They offered us some bananas and cosmic brownies and they were very tasty. The area we were hiking normally has gorgeous views, but not today… we were socked in by the clouds, no views in most areas. As the day went on, the dreaded rains came. We were able to get a small break from the showers around lunch time, and we enjoyed eating and visiting with other young thru-hikers. Right after lunch, we crossed a road and there was trail magic. The couple doing the trail magic had section hiked the whole trail. We sat and talked with them and enjoyed some treats and fruit. They are from the Waynesboro, Va. area. Soon after we left the trail magic, the heavier rains started. We thought they would be short lived, but they never stopped. Around 3:30, the temperature started dropping. This became  problem for me. I had to decide do I put on my rain jacket and get it soaked, or keep it dry by hiking in my shirt only? If I could keep my jacket dry, I would have more warm layers to recover and stay warm in my tent. So, that is what I decided to do. Of course, that meant hiking in cold conditions for the last 3 hours. It paid off, as I was more comfortable after I got my tent set up and got in. One of the problems for the hikers, as we face a 2 day severe cold front, is not having any cold weather gear. Almost everyone sent their cold gear home when the temps reached 90 degrees for a week.  Once you have sent your gear home, the worst condition would be an unexpected cold rainy day… and that is what we had today. The Colonel and I pushed through the bad conditions and decided to head up to Spy Rock camping area. It was a good move, as the area has a large grassing field to set up tents. We had plenty of room to put up our tents on the grass instead of muddy areas that were available at the previous sites. Once I climbed in my tent, I was not coming out into the cold rain.

I awoke after some sleep last night, I was happy for the periods of sleep I did get. I stayed comfortable as far as my body temperature inside in my quilt. After I woke, I soaked up the spots of water that had blown into my tent overnight with my small camp towel, and then I wrung it out to try to get all the water out of the tent. The morning was cold, in the mid 30s, you could see your breath really easily. I begin to fix my breakfast and then make my plan for how it’s going to hike out this morning. I’m in the same shape today as far as keeping my dry clothes dry, so that would mean having to put my wet clothes back on this morning. My wet shoes and socks would cause me problems later.Soon after we started hiking in the cold rain, things took a turn for the worst. I was waiting for the Colonel to catch back up with me after he took a bathroom break. He was not coming around the trees as he would normally do. A few more minutes passed as I waited. Then as he finally appeared, he looked up and said, “beavER, I am going to have get off the trail.” My heart sank. He proceeded to inform me that he was having some issues that need to be checked out. We put our heads together to decide how we would get him home from the area we were located. The plan was to hike up past the Priest Mountain to a road at the base on the other side. Once at the summit of Priest Mountain, we hoped to get a signal to call his daughter and son to let them know. Our plan worked, and we went slower than our usual pace. We continued to take pictures of rock formations and views when we had one. As we did, I realized that this could be the last time we are blessed to hike together. Somewhere as we enjoyed our conversation passing the miles, we realized that we had been hiking together since Georgia, and we started on the same day, March 14th. Colonel’s daughter pulled up to give him a ride home at the parking area we were waiting in. We took a last picture together, and he was waving goodbye from the passenger seat before I could blink. I finished my lunch there and then started the 3,300 foot climb solo… with only my thoughts and the dust that was getting in my eyes. The weather started turned nice as I hiked up the “Beast” really named Three Ridges Mountain. My thoughts during the climb were all over the place. I thought about how blessed I had been to hike with the Colonel and Double Take, and now they are both home. There is still a chance one, or both of them, could get back on the trail. I hope and pray that will be the case. I noticed that my right foot was hurting around my little toe as we were coming down off the Priest. The downhill was about 3,200 foot straight down. The wet shoes and socks were a bad combination for those abusive steps. I knew I would need to get out of the socks, so I began to dry my wet pair from yesterday. When I finally pulled off my right sock, I saw blood all over both my small toes. I had a blood blister that had popped. Oh well, why not… it was fitting for the day. I doctored it up a bed time. The shelter area where I pulled up to end the day is nice. I hope to stay warm tonight as this should be the last night of the unusual cold. -beavER","Spy Rock Junction Campsites

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638308,"The morning started early because I had over 20 miles to hike today to get to Wayne’s world to get out. I could tell it was going to be a good morning, but it was cold. I could see my breath, but I could see the sun rising, and there did not appear to be any clouds in the sky. I broke camp, and got on the trail before seven. I had 2 flags flying on the rear side of my backpack. One was mine, the other was from the Colonel. As I was hiking up the first mountain, I called Backwoods because I had cell signal. The first mountain disappeared beneath my feet as I was in a good conversation with my beautiful wife. Before I knew it, I was at the top. Going down the other side, as what typically happens, I started losing signal and I had to cut my phone call off. The sun was up, and the temperature was starting to get better, and it started out as an enjoyable day. My first goal was to get to an Overlook at the Blue Ridge Parkway. The overlook is called Three Ridges Overlook. The reason why I wanted to go to the Overlook was not for the view, but for the trash can. After four days on the trail, I’ve got about a pound and a half to 2 pounds of trash from all the food containers and items I have been consuming. One of the simple things on the trail it’s just a place to dispose of your unneeded trash. Most of my morning was consumed with rocks and boulders and a very painful section of trail for miles and miles. Many the rocks were slick and you could slide and sprain your ankle, or hurt yourself easily, not a very enjoyable session to hike. The weather turned nice and beautiful, but the trails remained treacherous for most of today. With it being Memorial Day, there were many day hikers. I kept running into Pull Up today. She had camped at the shelter I was at last night, and we kept crossing paths today as we hiked Waynesboro. About 2 o’clock, it started to sink in that I was on the last few miles of trail that I have previously hiked. Once I roled into Waynesboro, it was the end of all of my section hikes previously hiked trail. The next step I take north from here, I’ll be starting to hike in unknown territory. Later in the hike, I ran into Cuzzy and Dog Bowl at the Paul Wolf shelter. They were stopping there for the night. I got to talk to them for a little while and found out that Cuzzy‘s gonna be hiking with his sister-in-law through the Shenandoah’s. I am excited for him as I know how cool it is to have someone hike with you. I missed the Colonel and Double Take and the laughs we had as we hiked. Colonel is hoping to get checked out tomorrow. I finished up this section with Pull Up and me hiking the last 3 miles into Rockfish Gap, the edge of Waynesboro. We stopped at the Gourmet Popcorn vendor and they sold us 2 bags of kettle corn even though they were closed. We got our free shuttle to Stanimals and started doing our chores. My toes with blood blister held up ok, but I do need a day to let it heal some. -beavER","Maupin Field Shelter

Update Note: The Colonel received good news from his Doctor today. He might be able to return to the trail soon. I also am posting the video of our last day hiking up the Priest from 2 days ago.
Today was a day to recover and rest. My main goal was to resupply by going to the local outfitter and Walmart to get the items I needed. I got the fuel for my stove and dehydrated meals at the outfitter. Medical supplies for my blisters, toiletries, food, and snacks, at Wally World. I did the normal town things that eat up your time, like balancing the checkbook and paying bills online. After FaceTiming with Backwoods while she was at the grandsons T-Ball game, I was feeling great. I was able to watch both my daughter’s sons play the infield. My son-in-law was helping coach the youngest on how to play 2nd base. Then I watched them bat and run all the bases. The youngest crossed home with a slide. I also was able to visit with other thru-hikers, some I know like Slingshot, Papa Crystal, Pull Up, and Chewy…. and many others I just met.
One very interesting hiker I met today was “Water Queen”. She was able to complete her thru-hike starting last year and finishing it up this spring. We sat and talked about our experiences and blessing on the trail that make it so special. One awesome story she has is about the 2020 AT thru-hiker tag. She did not get one when she started because the ATC had stopped issuing them. She talked with a hiker that had gotten one, but he had gotten off the trail and did not complete his hike attempt. He decided later to give her his tag. He felt she deserved it since she finished and he didn’t. When Water Queen looked at the tag closely, she realized the number on the tag that indicates your position was 13. That is her favorite number. She is currently doing trail magic as her daughter is hiking now. I hope to run into her again up the trail. I plan to hit the trail early. I am really excited as it is all new trail for me… Backwoods and I have sectioned hike to the very spot I stopped yesterday, but I have not taking one step beyond here.

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638412,"Hikers that were ready to hit the trail piled into the shuttle at 7:15. The Aqua Blazers were leaving a little later. Aqua Blazing is where you take a kayak or canoe on the river. This puts you down the trail about 45 miles for 3 days instead of hiking. It does not count as hiking, but a fun option. I don’t want to miss any of the Shenandoahs, so I headed to the same popcorn stand that Pull Up and I had stopped at on Memorial Day.
As I started my hike, I hesitated a moment to reflex on the fact that this is “new territory” for my hiking shoes. Up to this very point, I had been retracing my section hikes over the last 10 years. But this “line in the sand” is the northern end of my section hikes. When I caught up with my adrenaline, I moved on…. Just another step in the journey. After hiking a couple hours, I summited Bear Den Mountain, and there’s a weather radar station on top, it is cool to see. About lunchtime, I came up on section of trail that is about 12 miles with no water. I almost missed the note that said I needed to “camel up” (load up on water) before I hiked that stretch. This would be really bad. As I went back to get water, another hiker was going by, I stopped him and ask him if he  knew about this super long stretch with no water? He had no idea, so he went back with me to get more water also. I stopped for lunch at an overlook and found a place on a Rock-wall that was shaded to take my break. Chewy was already there, she had stopped to eat her lunch. As I came up to a road crossing, I met Don and Ellen. They were day hiking. Don had a UK t-shirt on, so I had to get a picture with them. Their families are from Inez, Kentucky. They  currently live in Durham, NC.
Even with all the excitement today, their was pain. I had focused on the blood blister that had developed on my small toe. The bandages were in place when I started, but as I hiked, I noticed a irritation around my other toes on my right foot. My though was that the bandage was coming loose. When I got to my campsite, I removed my sock to find an enormous blood blister on my big toe. I doctored it up and placed a bandage on it. We will see how it holds up in the rain that is coming tomorrow. No Rain, no Pain, no Maine! I was happy to see Pull Up roll into the Hut (that is what they call shelters here). -beavER","Waynesboro Stanimals

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638441,"The overnight rain stopped about 6 am, so I was able to get out of my tent and start breaking camp. Then I had breakfast. The temperature was not bad this morning. It was overcast. After I started hiking, I came to a pile of rocks called Black Rock Summit. We climbed up to the top and got some good views and great pictures. Because of my blisters, I started hiking much slower, and I reduced my miles goal for the day. It wasn’t too long after I started hiking that my right foot had an irritation around my 2nd toe. I thought I had a blister that I missed. So, I needed to stop and take my shoes off and inspect and see what was going on. I had only made it a little over 2 miles before I had to stop to check my feet. I was really starting to worry since I had so much trouble yesterday. But I got my sock off to check where the pain was coming from. The toe had a callus on it that had  cracked, and had a small cut on the pad of my toe. I made the repair with the bandages and some medicine that was good for cold sores and blisters. I felt much better. The irony of the situation is quite entertaining to me. For the first 850 miles of backpacking, my first aid kit was in the very bottom of my backpack because I never needed it. We all stopped at Loft Mountain Camp store to eat and relax for lunch. It is a great place to break.
In other news: I got some good news yesterday from the Colonel, he is going to get back on the trail, hiking from Waynesboro. Maybe Saturday, he’s needs to line up his ride. I’m really excited that he’s gonna be able to get back out and start hiking. Today was just the opposite of yesterday, every time I turned around, there’s a view of the Shenandoah Valley, it has been beautiful. This afternoon i hiked with the views of the Shenandoah mountains and valleys to my right side. I couldn’t help but realize how great of a section this is today. I had a gentle breeze keeping me cool with the mostly cloudy skies. I just was enjoying every step, so I started to dread the fact that I was going to be finishing up at my shelter within an hour. So, I slowed down a little bit. The struggles from this morning with my feet had long disappeared. I was really thankful for that. I made it to the shelter just as the rain hit, so I ducked inside to stay dry. I visited with Slingshot and Chalupa as the clouds opened up. After about 30 minutes, the rain stopped, and I set up my tent. It ended up being a great day. -beavER","Blackrock Hut

Including some lightning, but the strikes weren’t very close, and thankfully, not many. We were blessed that it stopped raining before 6 am, so I was able to get up and pack up without getting wet. The tent is little muddy and wet. My goal for the day was Lewis Mountain Campground, about 20 miles, if my feet would hold up. The young people I’ve been hiking with were talking about maybe going 8 miles and then stopping to take a long nap and then maybe night hike to the shelter at 21 miles. They decided not to do it. One big mile stone for the day was the 900 mile mark! When I got there, I started taking pictures and Slingshot came up. She helped me get my picture down by the rocks, and then I got her picture… awesome accomplishment. When we got to a gap Road crossing, there was a couple doing trail magic! It was around 12 o’clock. They had drinks, chips, and some spam. I decided against the spam, but the chips and the drinks were good. All my bandages came off today as I hiked, the tall wet grass got my shoes and socks soaked. Most of the trails are really overgrown as trail maintenance was stopped last year. I have seen a few crews working, so I am hopeful they will be given the green light soon. Today’s trail was more like normal Virginia, straight up, then straight down. There were very few views, unlike yesterday. I pushed in a little harder today, as I heard the Camp Store closed at 5:00. I made good time, and arrived before 4:00, and then found out store was open until 6:00. I was able to get a nice tent-site, took shower, washed clothes, bought dinner and breakfast items. The staff here is very hiker friendly. They went out of their way to help me. My air mattress has developed a small leak, and I have to blow it back up 4-5 times per night. They loaned me a spray bottle with soapy water, and I found the leak quickly with the spray. I made a temporary repair with my patch kit. Let’s see if it holds up a few days. I took time this evening to put on Me Skin Blister pads and used some surgical tape to hold it in place. We will see if both my repairs hold up a few days…-beavER","Pinefield Hut Campsite

Late last night, a family was looking for a place to sleep at the campsite but all the spots were full. I met them over at the check-in ranger station and told them they were welcome to stay at my site if they needed a place. Steve, Sophie, and Elly Wang are from Tolerance California and are visiting the area because the Sophie’s parents are going to be moving to this area. They want to just check out Virginia. They slept in their van, and we got to visit for a while before I packed up to leave. They were really nice, and I was happy to share my campsite so they had a place to sleep. After a couple miles of hiking, I came to a beautiful Overlook named Bear Fence. It was gorgeous views this morning. I met “Superman” on trail today. Kent Clark is his real name, so I told him his trail name should be Man Super. He agreed. I stopped at Big Meadows Wayside for lunch, it’s a long ways off the trail, .4 mile walk, but it was really good. It’s really nice when you can have a sandwich, lemonade ,and an ice cream, and also get a banana nut muffin to take with you.
In other news: my temporary repair to my air mattress held up all night so that was good news. Also, my blister bandages held up with my crazy hiking today. The trail became rocky and difficult soon after lunch and remained that way the rest of the day. I arrived at the shelter around 6:00, and nobody was there. A little later,  a hiker named Lost and Found showed up. He’s from Washington, DC. I hiked extra miles today to position myself to be able to get to Luray, Va. in the morning.

That was were Alison from Open Arms Hostel was planning to pick me up at 8:30 am. I had plenty of time to make it, but I decided to wait to cook breakfast until I reached the gap. That would insure I Would be way early. I texted Alison from 2 miles out at a beautiful overlook called Mary’s Rock. From there, it’s straight down and no cell service until you are near the highway. I got there at 7:30 and wasn’t there more than 30 seconds, and I see Alison pull up to let 2 hikers out. They had moved up there leave time, so we could not have been more in sync if we had tried. I was able to check in at the Hostel and get a shower. Then, Lyra who is helping out there, shuttled me to Main Street Baptist Church for the Sunday service. The Rev. Timothy Scott gave a great sermon, and I enjoyed worshipping there. I had wanted to get back on track of making it to a local Church to worship on Sunday. It had worked out great with Alison’s and Lyra’s help. After the service, Lyra returned from the church she attended to pick me up and drop me off at a local restaurant. I spent the afternoon resting, doing chores, visiting with other hikers, and playing fetch with Alison’s dog, Blaze. Alison and her handy man (sorry, can’t remember his name) ask me if I wanted to go to local diner for dinner…. Didn’t take me long to say yes to home cooked food.

So I put on my sunglasses to keep the bugs out of my eyes. The trail in the morning was gently rolling with ups and downs. Sky was overcast, with high humidity, but other than that, it was enjoyable. As I was hiking, around 10 o’clock, I came up on Bambi and his mother right on the trail. I got some good pictures, pretty cool. The Shenandoah’s seem like they were mine this morning, I had only seen two hikers all morning. The two I saw; one lady that had injured her leg over a month ago and she had taken four weeks off to recover. She was slack packing to try to get back in the groove, and she had a friend with her. I stopped for lunch at Elkwallow Wayside. It is the last Rest area/ Camp Store in the Northern Section of the Park. I had Cheeseburger, fries, and an ice cream sandwich. Good times!

The forecast had called for around 50% chance of thunderstorms during the night. As I lay there half asleep, I starting thinking about safety issues… had I remembered to check above when I picked my tent site for dead limbs (hikers call them widow makers). Then I realized the Thunder was not coming with the bursts of light. It was far away for now. I closed my eyes thinking about the amount of time I had before the storm would hit. The next thing I knew, hours had passed and no storm. Thank you Lord. I got up early as my excitement stirred me to being wide awake at 5:00. So much that I had to get on the trail a little before seven. I couldn’t stand it. Already early in the mornings I hiked, my thoughts were focusing on the fact that today was the last day in Shenandoah‘s. The place I had been dreaming of hiking for many years. Around 10 o’clock in the morning the Dude  and I came up on a 5 foot rattlesnake sunning himself in a switchback. It was on the rocks right beside us. We stopped and we couldn’t go around him on the trail so we had to get him off the trail. Hiking poles were to short and just made him mad. So we used a long stick to coax him into moving on. Way too close for comfort. Around 11:30, we came to the northern boundary of the Shenandoah Park… sad times. Today’s hike was very different for me as I was Hiking in a group. I had met up again with with Shire, The Dude and Peacefoot last night at the Hut. I offered to get them a ride into Front Royal if they needed one. They did, so we stuck together the whole day until we arrived at the trail head for Front Royal. As we were hiking the last quarter mile, I looked up and saw Backwoods walking up the path toward us. I wanted to give her a big hug, but I knew I smelled bad, so a light kiss would have to do for the moment. I was so happy to see her beautiful smile.

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638901,"The term “trail magic” was coined by long-distance hikers to describe an unexpected occurrence that lifts a hiker's spirits and inspires awe or gratitude. “Trail magic” may be as simple as being offered a candy bar by a passing hiker. There’s a tradition of charity unto others called Trail Magic on the Appalachian Trail and other long distance trails in the US. It takes many forms. Sometimes, people will leave cold drinks and snacks at trail crossings for thru-hikers, or they’ll pick hikers up on the road and take them home for a few days of rest and food. It’s a great tradition and one of those magical things we hikers are able to experience. Many hikers return to the trail, as Trail Angels after their hikes, in the the following years to bless the new hikers. I just was blessed beyond anything I could have ever dreamed up, here is my story:
On May 20th I was just starting my climb up McAfee Knob. I wanted to confirm how to pronounce the name since I have heard it said 2 different ways. I saw a couple coming down the trail, and I was thinking they might be locals. I asked them if they were from around here? Roger and Carol responded well yes and no. They were from Virginia, but further north, from Front Royal. I quickly forgot about how to pronounce McAffe as I was excited to find out information about the town of Front Royal. That is where Backwoods and I would be meeting up in 2 weeks to start our hike together to finish up Virginia and get into Harpers Ferry. After Roger, Carol, and I had talked about 30 minutes about Front Royal and my Thru-Hike, including Backwoods joining me, Carol changed the subject. She said to me, “we want you and your wife to stay with us when you come into Front Royal”. She also said she wanted to shuttle us to town, or where ever we needed to go. Over the next few minutes, I wanted to make sure that Carol and Roger knew what they were volunteering for because it sounded to good to be true. They understood, they knew and wanted to do it. I also found out that Carol worked in the administration area for the American Discovery Trail. I could not believe it… somebody pinch me! The next day, as I tried to explain the unexplainable to Backwoods, she thought I had gone crazy… Someone is going to open their home to us and help us with all of our needs… your kidding right? Over the last 20 days, I had communicated at least a dozen times with Carol about the details of our plan, so when we rolled into Front Royal yesterday it all came together like a wonderful ending to a children’s novel. After we dropped off Shire, Peacefoot, and the Dude at their hotel, I called Carol and let her know we were on the way. We drove to their beautiful home on 5 acres that overlooks the Shenandoah mountains. They were such gracious hosts that I can’t tell you how thankful Backwoods and I are for them some giving and kind. Not only did Roger and Carol cook for us as if we were their best friends, they ask a good friend of theirs who had hiked the AT to join us for dinner. We spent hours in great conversation, and then Backwoods and I retired in the wonderfully furnished basement suite of their home. This morning when we awoke, Roger was cooking breakfast as we packed up our supplies for the trail. Our new best friends shuttled us to Harpers Ferry, seventy minutes away, we left our vehicle at the hotel we will be staying at when we hike there. They let us pile into their Subaru so they could take us back to Front Royal, stop at Walmart to pick up last minute supplies, and then delivered us to the trail head to start our hike north. All I can say is that I am still overflowing with thankfulness for being being blessed by this gracious and giving couple. May the Lord bless them. I hope to continue our new found friendship in the future.
Back to today’s hike… it was muggy from the 100% humidity. Backwoods did great hiking, and it did not take her long to get her hike on. Our plan was to do a short day as we did not start hiking until around noon. When we rolled into the shelter, there was Slow and Old. I have seen him at the last 3 shelters I have stayed. The shelter is one of the nicer ones on the trail. It has a horseshoes pit, which Backwoods promptly beat me. It has a solar shower, which BWB and I both took a semi cold shower (refreshing)! Not at the same time… they have a gazebo with picnic table, and a large deck for hikers to relax and visit on. Little did I know how much visiting we would do there. As Backwoods and I were relaxing I looked up to see Shire walking up with her backpack. Shortly behind her was The Dude and Peacefoot. They all were staying at this awesome shelter. As we ate dinner together and embellished stories about rattle snakes and incredibly hiking days, Backwoods sees Dady Long Legs walking in, and it is like a family reunion. I had not seen him and Honey Bun since they hiked away from Mountain Harbour in Tennessee. I had often wondered how far ahead of me they were. Now as Honey Bun came in to the shelter it really was a reunion. Backwoods and I had first met them back in the Smokey’s. We set and caught up on events until it was dark. Now you would think in any other place beside the AT, this chance to reunite me and Backwoods and other hikers she knew would be hard to dream up…. But wait! There’s more! As we’re are talking, I hear Chewy say “Hey beavER!” Here came Her, then Koozie, then Dog Bowl, then Slingshot, all coming hiking in and telling us about their Aqua Blaze adventure. The amazing thing about this group of 5 is that Backwoods and I spent the night with them in the amazing Victorian bed and breakfast in Damascus. And it was just us 7 there. How could almost everyone that Backwoods knows on the trail all show up at the shelter on her first night back? And she beat me in horseshoes… -beavER","Front Royal

Backwoods and I would leave right after breakfast, around 7:00. As we started hiking, I immediately remembered the shin pain I had ignored yesterday. Same pain, except worse since yesterday. I didn’t pay much attention to it yesterday because of all the excitement and I knew we only had to do 5 miles. The pain was intense today, like someone had kicked me in the right shin with a steel toe boot. I had to break out some “vitamin I” (ibuprofen). There was no comfort the whole day. Many breaks and trying to change my stride to ease the pain. I have no idea why it started hurting yesterday, but I will keep you posted.Right after we started hiking, we parted ways with Dady Longlegs and Honey Bun as they were getting off trail today to spend some time with family then do some slack packing. Later, when we got into different parts of the forest, the cicadas noise sounds just like a police car pulling up behind you with their sirens on wanting you to pull over. I have a video to post once I have better cell coverage of WiFi. We received Trail Magic at a gap. It was given by the father of a young hiker named “Trip”. They had drinks, and snacks, apples and tangerines, and peanut butter crackers. It was the perfect place for us to receive it as we were hot and tired in the late humid afternoon. And if was also right before the last big climb of the day. The forecasted rain held off until we made camp and had our tent set up. It only lasted a short time, then stopped. We are planning to have rain starting around 9:00 pm and lasting all night and most of tomorrow. At the shelter tonight is Koozie, Dog Bowl, Chewy, Slingshot, and How Old. We all enjoyed dinner together sharing stories and laughing. -beavER","Jim & Molly Denton Shelter

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639061,"The rain storm hit at 8:00 last night, and got heavier as the night went on. Backwoods and I are already cramped in my ultralight 2 person tent, but we also had the backpacks in with us to try to keep them dry. We made it work, and had about an hour window from 6:00-7:15 to get everything packed up. Once we started hiking I knew I was in trouble. Not only did the heavy rain return, so did my shin pain.
“No Pain, No Rain, No Maine!” The pain in my shin was now twice as bad as yesterday. I doubled my ibuprofen and Tylenol intake. My mph hiking speed was dailed back from my normal of 2.7 average to a little over 1 mph by the end of the day. It was raining so hard at times that Backwoods and I were navigating a stream running where the hiking trails should be. I was forced to take breaks just to keep moving forward. If I would have had access to a car nearby, I would have pulled the plug on the day’s hike. But I didn’t. So onward at a slow pace we travelled. Our goal was to make it to Bear’s Den Hostel, about 10 miles. We made it, but I am not sure at what price. 
Not all was bad today, here are the highlights: Backwoods did wonderful even in the bad conditions. We crossed the 1000 mile mark. I was not able to celebrate as much as I had hoped, since I was concerned about my shin. But, I am really happy to be past the milestone. We started the Rollercoaster today about 1/2 mile after we started hiking. The Roller Coaster is a 14-mile stretch of steep climbs and descents with few views. Of course, it is the worst case scenario, for my condition. We hope to finish the last 5 miles of it tomorrow morning. We had many swollen streams to cross and made it safely. The ATC Bear’s Den Hostel was a great refuge to get out of the storms and rain. Many of our hiking friends were here and made room for us to squeeze in. They only had a small area to hang out until the official opening time of 5:00 pm. At 5:00 they open a large bunk area and common area that is really comfortable. The main host, Glenn, got me some ice packs to use on my shin. I will attempt a slow and easy hike over the next 2 days. Backwoods and I have 20 miles to go to make Harpers Ferry. I could use as many prayers are I can get. Thank you ahead of time because I know many of you will help me by asking the Lord to strengthen me. -beavER","Rod Hollow Shelter

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639122,"Around 3:00 am, I awoke and quietly slipped into the common area as not to wake the others sleeping in the bunk room. I pulled the ice packs out of the freezer, that Glenn, the caretaker of Bears Den Hostel, had been nice enough to find for me. I placed them on my shin to help ease the pain. After about 45 minutes, I returned to my bunk to try to get another hour of shuteye. Everyone around seemed to help me last night with my bad shin. Glenn with the ice packs, the Dude gave me topical cream for pain, Peacefoot gave me some KT tape, my nephew Chris texted me examples of how to tape up my shin, and my daughter sent info as well as my friend Scout Daddy. I hit the trail taped up and with a plan to take as many breaks as needed to do the 11 miles to the shelter. Backwoods and I eased into the hike around 8:00 and saw many day hikers early as it is Saturday. Before long, we made it to the most anticipated milestone for me since I started hiking… the Virginia/ West Virginia border. I am finally out of Virginia, a new state! Yeah! Then, 1.5 miles later, we came to the end of the Roller Coaster section. We were leap frogging as we hiked today with “Spidey” and his 3 friends. We had given him the trail name because he looks like Peter Parker of Spider-Man fame. They all ended up at our shelter this evening, and we visited with them as we broke bread. Our friends, Shire, the Dude, and Peacefoot also made it to the shelter. My pain level today was slightly better than yesterday, and I am hopeful that I will be able to make it the 7 miles tomorrow to Harpers Ferry. I have plans for zero days to try to heal up my bad wheel. -beavER","Bear’s Den Hostel

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639198,"The morning started with anticipation of making it to Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. The city of Harpers Ferry is more than a place to resupply, wash clothes, and take a shower. It is the psychological halfway point of the AT. With the trail being 2,193.1 miles long, I still need to hike another 71.5 miles to actually be halfway. (1096.6) But with the arrival to this historical city, you can bet all the Thru-hikers feel as if they have made the mid point of the hike. I have been looking forward to crossing the Shenandoah River and stepping into the city limits every since Backwoods and I visited here back in 2015. The city is oozing history at every corner. From the first skirmish of the civil war to the Battlefields that surround the city. You also can visit the college the houses the beginnings of the NAACP, and see the overwhelming beauty of the convergence of the Shenandoah and Potomac Rivers. When Thomas Jefferson spoke about the site of the rivers merging, he summed up his comments by saying, “This scene is worth a voyage across the Atlantic.”I started the hiking knowing there was no reason to hurry, we only needed about 8 miles to make it. I am still wrestling with the shin pain, 2 days ago, it was about an 8.5 on scale of 10 being I had to stop walking. Yesterday was a 7, and today seemed to be a 6. The difference is mainly the amount of downhills. Over the last 3 days, the severity of the steep downhills have lessened each day. I plan to go to a local Urgent Treatment Center tomorrow to get my shin checked out. The great highlight of the morning was when we came to a Trail Magic at a parking lot around 10:00 am. A local young lady and her friend was treating the hikers to home made waffles with blueberries and chocolate chips. They had fresh fruit and drinks. I was not only happy for good ole beavER, but I was also happy to see Backwoods get a great blessing on the last day of her hike. My hiking friends were all stopped there enjoying the delights. The trail itself today was mostly level with a major steep downhill as you approach the city. As we were about to start the decent, I heard a loud thump right behind me, I turned around quickly as I threw my hiking pole to the ground. I knew the noise meant that Backwoods had went down hard. It is the sound you don’t want to hear. I helped her up as she shook off the crash that was caused by a stubby rock. One that only sticks up about 2 inches and grasp your toe to trip up anyone that hikes. It is a constant hazard. Her knee, fingers, and lower lip all took a blow. But as only some one that is as tough as nails would do, she acted as if everything was good… and I believed her again. As the day went on, she did admit to being sore, especially her finger, but I think she is ok. As we made it down the drop in trail, we eventually got to an overlook of the Shenandoah. I got a good pic and video as Backwoods pointed out the black clouds that were rolling in. As we still had a half mile to go, we knew we needed to pick it up. Hikers have to cross the auto bridge in the pedestrian walkway to traverse the river. We saw the storm engulfing us as we hurried and increased our pace. Backwoods left me on her dust, I laughed as I hobbled, and eventually caught up because I had the map. We climbed the driveway of the hotel as the rain drops started to pelt us. Under the awning, we started to relax and celebrate beating the storm. We shared the moment with Easy Rider. As I reflected on the awesome time I have experienced with my beautiful wife this week, I have been praising the Lord for my shin injury over the last few days. I realized after Backwood’s fall, that if I had not been slowed, there could have been many trips and falls because the speed I would have hiked the path. She would have used her toughness to keep up with the pace I would set as the lead. I have witnessed this occurrence many times as other thru-hikers have love ones tag along. We thru-hikers can’t dial it back as much as we should. It has its roots in the competitive nature that we all have. I could feel it eating at my pride as someone would pass me, my thoughts would go straight to, “you better be glad that I am injured, if I was healthy, you would only see beavER tail…” but that pride would have pushed me, like all other hikers, to push my love one too hard. Thank you Lord for slowing me down. One fall was too many.- beavER","David Lesser Memorial Shelter

We were united as one at 6:30 am, outdoors at our Church park. It was a beautiful sunrise wedding with birds singing in the branches of the trees that surrounded the guests. Brother Wendell Romans performed the service for us. Backwoods Barbie and I have been blessed every step of our journey together. Sometimes we did not see the blessing until time had past. I am really happy that she is here as I have been struggling with my current steps on the trail. This morning after breakfast, we headed to the Urgent Treatment Center the hotel front desk employee had recommended. 
The Doc at the urgent treatment thinks it is an infection. “Cellulitis”. They gave me a prescription for antibiotics. I also had a x-ray done to confirm there is not a hair line fracture. My wonderful niece, FA, that is an army doctor stationed in Alaska, confirmed the diagnosis. She says it is a common infection with soldiers in the field. The main cause of the bacterial infection is a combination of open cuts, sores, and bad hygiene. All of which I have experienced as I trudge through the forest. I am hoping the antibiotics and zero days will reverse the effects of the bacteria. Backwoods and I took it easy during the afternoon. She used her skill to trim up my hair, and then we watched old WW II movies, Monument Men, and The Battle of Midway. We decided to head to a Old Town Harpers Ferry restaurant, Hamilton’s Tavern 1840, for dinner. The food was excellent, but the peanut butter cheesecake was a 10! We walked the old town streets to settle our dinner and enjoy the 1800’s architecture. I will do at least one more zero day tomorrow to continue the healing, but more importantly, enjoying Backwoods company. -beavER","Quality Inn- Harpers Ferry

Backwoods and I had come up with a list of questions to ask. I wanted to do it face to face instead of over the phone. Our biggest concern was what if the antibiotics does not work. What should I be looking for as signs of the infection is getting worse? Also, I am concerned about being in the forest and miles from a town if that happens. We also read you come get a steroid to accelerate the healing process.


Other trail news about my hiking friends: The Colonel who was 20 miles away from Harpers Ferry this morning, made it to the hotel by this evening. The Dude was checking out this morning to hike with his wife. They are being shuttled ahead to Boonsboro, Md. they will spend the next 3 days coming back south to here. Then, he will be shuttle back to Boonsboro to continue going north from there. Backwoods and I cancelled our plans to go tour Washington, DC. I knew that the walking would be counterproductive to my healing process. Instead, we decided to head to Gettysburg, Pa. It was a one hour drive. We booked a guided bus tour on a double decker, so I could stay off my feet. We loved the tour and the impact of battle’s history will remain with me for a long time. I am so glad we decided to spend our afternoon in Gettysburg. I spent the rest of the evening getting my gear and supplies packed to head north in the morning.

Today meant parting with Backwoods as she would be driving south, and I would be hiking north. I finished getting my gear prepared, and headed down for breakfast. I ran into Tejas, from Austin, Texas. I have not seen him, or his son Zey, since around Damascus. He looked much better, back then he was suffering from dehydration. A friend of his from Austin had coordinated a surprise to visit him here on the trail. His friend flew up and wore a mask and sunglasses to hide his identity. Zey, videoed the whole event. Backwoods and I hiked up to the ATC so I could sign in and get my picture and sequential number of thru-hiker position, going north on the AT. I was the 435th north bound hiker to sign in. From there, we hiked through the downtown area of Harpers Ferry, then past John Brown’s historical markers, where he attacked the armory. From there we had to cross the C&O railroad bridge to follow the AT into Maryland. West Virginia is complete, 5 states down, 9 remain. Backwoods hiked a few minutes with me in Maryland. When it was time for her to backtrack to her vehicle, we both had trail dust in our eyes. That is unusual for her, but not yours truly. The trail parallels the Shenandoah river for about 3 1/2 miles, so it’s flat and level hiking, with a wide hiking and bike path. There is a beautiful view of the river the whole way. Eventually the trail turns left to go up into the forest. I’d only been hiking a few hundred meters in the forest in Maryland when I had an overlook of a stream. In swooped a crane and it spread its wings as it landed on a boulder perch. What a blessing to remind me one of the reasons I am here. I met a section hiker named  “whistle britches” back in 1982 he hiked the whole trail. He’s preparing to hike a section of the John Muir trail into Yosemite later this year. I stopped to eat a late lunch at the the Ed Garvey Shelter. It’s a very interesting architectural design, log style, with a loft, that you get to the loft from the backside of the shelter very cool looking. I put some pictures of it in my photos section. The trail was almost enjoyable once I made the climb up to the ridge line. Some rocks, but there was enough dirt to give me a break. My shin was still sore, but I did not take any pain medication. I would rate the pain label 3, on scale of 10. I also enjoyed the perfect 74 degree temp with a slight breeze. I made it to the tent sites close to the shelter. After dinner, I got into the tent so I could elevate my leg to help reduce the slight swelling from the hiking. It is cooler tonight, so I will need my quilt to stay warm.

But, I talked myself into going back to sleep for a while so I didn’t wake up the people tenting around me. Once I got on the trail at 7:30 am, the trail was very nice condition starting out mostly dirt just rolling hills and a wide trail, so there’s no weeds all over you. The temperature was a little on the cool side, but I just put on my buff to keep my body temperature up. The sun was rising with a perfect clear sky. Around 10:30, past a cemetery and monument for the first Union Commander the died in the Civil War. He was shot by a Texan. Seeing the actual memorials really makes you think, when you pass these hallowed grounds, about what our country has been through in the past. So that we can have the present that we live in. I stopped at the Dahlgren Hiking Campground for lunch. It’s a awesome place, they have restrooms with running water, showers, electrical outlet to charge up my devices, and a really nice camping area. I ate my lunch there, and took some pain relievers to help with my shin soreness. It helped, and I made it through the rest of the day with no problems. About 1 o’clock, I came upon Trail Magic at the Washington Memorial Park entrance. It was being given by parents who are supporting their daughter on the trail. They are from Connecticut. About 1:30, I made it up to the original Washington monument that the villagers from Boonsboro built July 4, 1827. It is a rocks structure, about 50 foot tall. The structure was used during the Civil War by the Union Army is a signal station. I crossed over interstate 70 about 3 o’clock in the afternoon. The ped-way went right over top of the interstate, and it’s just for the Appalachian Trail, very interesting. I made it to my campsite early. It is supported by the Potomac Trail Club.

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639469,"On the trail by a little before 7 am this morning. The trail was mostly rocky, with some dirt. I’ve seen a few hikers that are  slack packing. They are doing a 40+ mile, 4 state challenge. What that means is you start in Pennsylvania, and work your way through Maryland, then through Harpers Ferry and West Virginia to get to the Virginia border.  That way you’ve had your feet in four states in a 24 hour period. My pain level for shin was ok in the morning, but got worse around lunch. Around 10:30, I was hiking out in the open meadows and I passed through a farm that had just fresh mowed hay. Walking down the path through the hayfield reminds me of my upbringing as a young man on a small farm in Kentucky. Hiking was rather pleasant this morning as the temperature was nice with a cool breeze, and off in the distance you can still hear the sound of the cicadas. I’m seeing many dead cicada on the forest in the trail path. They’re starting to die out rather rapidly. Around noon it started warming up just in time as I was going up a large climb to get to the shelter where I was going to stop for my lunch break. I can always tell when it’s hot out here when I’m climbing because sweat starts dripping off my elbows.At lunch, I got in touch with the Urgent treatment center that I went to in Harpers Ferry to ask him questions about my anabiotic’s. There’s not been a whole lot of improvement with my pain level so they advised me to go ahead and start taking the second dose of anabiotic’s I have. I’ve got a stronger dose of anabiotic’s just in case the first one didn’t work since I would be in the forest and wouldn’t have a way to get to Urgent treatment. They was nice enough to give me another prescription which I have. So the doctor advised me to just go ahead and start taking it now. After lunch, I stopped to see the view at High Rock Ledges. The whole area is covered with graffiti everywhere, from all the rocks, to the trees, to the steps up to the view. Sad. I took a break at Pen Mar Park. A great little park and you could order delivery from the local pizza place, New York style pizza. I could only eat half of it. I had a great conversation with the caretaker,  Dennis. We visited for about an hour, just talking about old times, about the way things used to be years ago there at the park. Very shortly after leaving the park I came to the Mason Dixon line, the original boundary between the north and south years ago. Backwoods’ relatives (Archibald MacClean) are actually the ones that laid the Boundary stones and Markers for the Mason Dixon line. They also did all the survey work. Mason and Dixon just came in and confirmed everything was done right and actually didn’t do anything but get the credit. You can google it, I thought it was very interesting.

So, right off the bat this morning I start experiencing some boulders on the trail. A gentleman I met yesterday said if it wasn’t for the rocks and the roots, there wouldn’t be a trail in Pennsylvania. It’s a place to be very careful. Main thing is to try to keep your balance and don’t step wrong and twist your ankle, or even worse, go down hard. This morning marks the 11th day of my shin pain. I’m not sure how many days before I felt the pain, that my infection actually started. Yesterday, I started my second dose of anabiotic‘s, the stronger dose and I’m praying that it works. This morning as I was eating breakfast I was reflecting on the fact that so many people have prayed for me while I’m out here and I was really appreciating that fact. I happened to get a little Trail dust in my eyes this morning again as I though about my friends thinking of me. The forecast was for rain around noon and continue through the evening, so I wanted to get as many miles as possible before lunch. Today I had to do a better job staying hydrated. When you take an anabiotic‘s you can get dehydrated easily. Last night after I got to my camp, I drank almost a liter of water because I was so thirsty. At 9 :00, the Colonel started communicating with me. He’s been behind me every since I left Harpers Ferry. He took a zero day there in the day I left. He’s been slowly gaining the last few days. As of this morning, he was 4 1/2 miles behind me. So we made arrangements to meet. I changed my plans from hustling miles, to “hurry up and wait” so the Colonel could catch up. I could have my lunch and just take a long lunch break and give my leg a rest while he closes the gap, then we could start hiking together again. I stopped to take a break at Deer Lick Shelters. At the shelter, I met a section hiker, his name is  Bald Eagle. He has section hiked all the way to this location and is headed back to his home state of Connecticut. The section he’s doing currently is for 432 miles long. After that, he’ll have one more big section to get through New Hampshire to finish up. The rocks on the trail when I first started Pennsylvania soon disappeared and the trail was actually nice for hiking the first half of the day. I stopped at Old Forge Park to take another long extended break and eat my lunch and wait on the Colonel to catch up with me. When he showed up, it was if an old friend walked up. We were teamed up again. As we hiked the trail became rocky, then the rain started. The Colonel was pushing himself today. He was doing about 24 miles, and doing it with his foot hurting. We powered through the boulders, rocks, and rain as we filled the air with conversation. It was good to have great company. We made it to US 30, the road crossing where Reverend Beal from the Church run Hostel was to pick us up. Once we arrived at the Church, we knew that we were going to be blessed. We ended up being the only hikers here for the night. The place is awesome. The kitchen and pantry are full of food that we can help ourselves to. The shower, laundry area is nice, and the bunk room is relaxing. Colonel and I looked at each other as our host explained all the amenities for us and quietly gave each other a fist bump.

He needed to recover from the hard hike yesterday because his foot has been hurting. After breakfast we got word that Tejas and Zey we’re going to come to this hostile after about 10 miles of hiking today. I was excited because we have everybody together and this is a great place to take the day off. One of the reasons why I wanted to come to this hostile in the first place was because it is a church run ministry and it is part of the church. So I was able to go to the worship service. I started out the morning with Sunday School. Reverend Beall taught the sunny school class and it was really good it was on a subject that hit home with me. The title of his lesson was “You are A Miracle waiting to happen.” The meat of the lesson was on relationships. The thing that impressed me the most about the teaching style of the Reverend was his command of the room. He reminded me of a great preacher that I remember from my home church, Brother Lloyd Mahanes. He was a preacher from my youth that I still can feel the emotion from his voice as he held you in awe and wonder as he spoke. My hiking brother, the Colonel, went with me to the church service and it was great, I enjoyed every minute of it. Shortly after the church service was over Tejas and Zey were able to make it to the hostile. We spent the afternoon relaxing and made a trip to Walmart for a few supplies.

We were planning to do a big breakfast before we hit the trail as we had access to a full kitchen. I got the eggs cracked to make scrambled eggs, then made the pancake mix. Darryl, the Ridge-runner that was also staying at the hostel, started the bacon. All of us worked together to complete our large breakfast. Afterwards, everyone pitched in to clean the kitchen spotless. A Ridge-runner is someone who takes care of the trail. They usually have between 30-50 mile to care for. Darryl takes care of 40 miles, and the hostel is in the middle of his section, so he always stops here to spend a night. Once we were ready to go, Rev. Beall shuttled us back to the trail head. The trail condition was a mix of nice dirt section an then rocky sections. The shelters we passed today were awesome. Pennsylvania is knocking the ball out the park when it comes to them. When we arrived at the 3rd shelter of the morning, we saw someone familiar swinging a hammock. It was Daryl the Ridge-runner. He was taking a break from his duties, as he was traveling along the trail southbound, the opposite direction from us. We got to visit with him as we took a break. After thanking him for all he does to keep the shelters and trail in great shape, we took some pictures and headed north. At the 12 mile mark, we came to nice Trail Magic being given to hikers by the Appalachian Long Distance Hikers Association. They were grilling hotdogs, and had chili and cheese to cover them. They also had all the things hikers like, drinks, snacks, fruit, and candy.
Around 1:30, we came upon the 1/2  completion of the trail. There was not a good marking, so the Colonel and I placed rocks to indicate the “1/2” point for hikers to celebrate and tank pictures. About 30 minutes later, we came to the 1,100 mile mark. Picture time again! Tejas and Zey were about a mile ahead of the Colonel and me. My shin seemed to do better today, but I am still cautious. We rolled into Pine Grove State Park just as the thunder storms were starting. Tejas yelled for me to come up to the porch of the general store. He and Zey had already started the “half gallon ice cream challenge”. This is a long standing tradition with Thru-hikers. You will try to eat a half gallon of ice cream by yourself once you have passed the half way mark. For those that don’t know how much is a half gallon… it is one of the big containers of ice cream everyone buys for the family… plus another pint (2 cups). I went into the store to purchase my first one and a half quart container of Butter Pecan. Zey was in the lead when I set down, and Tejas a was a close second. They had about a 15 minute head start. They were about a quarter way through the big family sized ice cream container. Tejas “tapped out” (gave up) at the middle mark. He was done. Zey kept going. Every so slowly. I started to make up ground, I have 60 years of experience loving this frozen treat. Then, I realized why Zey was stalled. You get to a point where there is no place for it to go once you swallow. Once Zey knocked his out, I had about 3 spoonfuls remaining. As we both completed the first half of the challenge, we knew the rules where you had to take your empty container back inside, and the staff would let you pick the ice cream for the pint you have to eat to be finished. At this point, Zey and I both said “I am done, it is impossible to eat the additional pint. Just then, Savage, a female Thru-hiker that was also doing the challenge, called me out! She showed me that she was eating her way into the pint before her. As she looked up, her face revealed the effects of the struggle she was going through. But she was not giving up… I could not let this young lady struggle alone. The sugar high and lack of space from her throat down was obvious. She justified her plight by saying, “I am named Savage!” Into the store I went with my empty vessel. I chose chocolate chip cookie dough to finish the deed. Both Savage and I made it to the last spoonful. We fist bumped, and tried to not move to quickly. The crowd that had been pulling for us to finish, were happy to take our picture together. The porch was full of spectators as everyone was seeking shelter from the rain. I redeemed my final empty container to receive a small wooden spoon. We all decide to check into the Iron Masters Mansion Hostel here at the park. Storms will continue all night and into the morning. Needless to say, I did not eat any dinner. It was a once in a lifetime adventure challenge, and I prevailed. But never again… what a day! -beavER","Trail of Hope Hostel- US 30

Because of heavy rains lasting until 1:00 this afternoon, we decided to hold up at the Ironmasters Mansion Hostel. This area has an  enormous amount of history. The Pine Grove State Park area was used as a secret German interrogation Camp during in WW II. Over 7,000 Germans, and 150 Japanese prisoners passed through this camp. Once prisoners were interviewed, they were sent to other camps based on the importance of the information they knew. 
Two of our hiking friends, Slim & Slowpoke, made us a fried rice and vegetable brunch. We all pitched in to clean up. But Tejas went the extra mile by polishing the stainless steel… impressive. The Colonel heard that the caretaker, Dana, was taking a hiker named Boston to the Urgent Treatment in Carlisle, Pa. He had broke his toe. I needed to get to that very location, and was planning to get shuttled there tomorrow. Dana gladly said she would be happy to take me also… wow, what a blessing. The Urgent Treatment resident Doctor in Harpers Ferry instructed me to have a follow up visit at Carlisle. It is the last city before going into a long stretch of wilderness. My hiking “tramily” (trail family) hiked out of the hostel at noon as the rains stopped. I was on the way to Carlisle. I would be hours behind my friends when I returned and started hiking. The good news is the resident at the UTC gave me the ok to continue. Finish my medication, 3 more days. Elevate whenever possible. Take ibuprofen and Tylenol for pain. Continue aggressive hydration. Seek urgent care if I develop a fever, worsening pain, redness or swelling. I am extremely relieved that all is on track to completely heal. Boston got his results back from his x-ray while I was having my shin looked over. He got bad news. First, he was hoping his toe wasn’t broken, even though he knew it was…And the break was substantial, as they saw in his x-ray. The bone was in the wrong position. The resident there recommended that he go see a orthopedic surgeon. So Boston has decided to go back home to Boston. He’s gonna take the train back tomorrow. It always hurts to see someone have to leave the trail. He hopes to return after his foot heals. I felt good hiking as I left the Pine Grove State Park. It was 3:30 when I hit the trail. Tejas and Colonel kept me informed of their location as we travelled north about 5 miles apart. I almost caught them as they stopped for a long dinner break at Green Mountain General Store. I rolled in just minute after they left. I stopped for an extended break also. cheeseburger and fries… and believe it or not, ice cream for desert! Yes, I did eat a half gallon not more than 24 hour ago… this was just an I.C. sandwich, if that makes it anymore believable. The owner and staff were very friendly, and I enjoyed my visit. Once I rolled out, I thought I only had about a mile to make it to where my buddies stopped to camp…wrong! They had changed to a better campsite, another 2.0 miles beyond the one I thought was home for the night. The longer distance was not bad, but it did force me to hike close to dark. I made camp and had just enough time to set up my tent, hang bear bag, and visit for about 10 minutes. Perfect! At our campsite tonight: Tejas, Zey, Colonel, Slowpoke, Slim, Andrew me. We had many laughs in only 10 minutes. -beavER","Ironmasters Manson Hostel

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639792,"The weather was cool overnight, temperature was in the high 40s. I could see my breath as I was hanging my bear bag last night, so I knew it was going to be cool. We woke up and broke camp quickly, then hit the trail as a beautiful day unfolded. Not a cloud in the sky, and in the low to mid 70s for the day. We went through some ups and downs, and on the ups, we climbed through some really cool rock formations. We had to do some hand over hand climbing in some places. When we got to the first shelter, I needed to take a potty break. As I did the detour, Tejas decided to continue to catch his son, Zey. The only problem was Zey was at the shelter using the Privy. That got us separated from Tejas until we arrived at the next town. About 4 miles before we got to the town, we into an open pasture area where they are growing crops of corn and wheat. The area was a beautiful setting as we hiked toward Boiling Springs. The Colonel found ripe Mulberries. I ate a couple of hand fills as we hiked through the field. Once we arrived into Boiling Springs, we hooked back up with Tejas & Zey. We had lunch at an Italian restaurant. After lunch we found one of the local boiling springs. The water bubbles up from the ground as it’s coming out. We got in to soak our feet, and I submerged my shin in the cold water to do cold water therapy. There were many hikers in the town, and some came to join us in the liquid massage. Colonel and I left town before Tejas and Zey. We headed to the town of Carlisle, and they were heading past the town about 2 miles to camp. -beavER","Stream and Tenting Campsite

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639839,"The Colonel and I wanted to go back to Denny’s for breakfast, so we got up early to head that way. Once we arrived, we saw that they did not open until 7:00. Hurry up and wait. Breakfast was good, then we checked out and waited for the shuttle. The area of Carlisle were we stayed is full of semi truck warehouses. I have never seen so many semis in the same area. Our shuttle took us back to the ABF terminal to drop us off by the trail. ABF is a large freight handler. As we walked back up the road to the trail, we ran into Kiki & Puff. I have not seen them since around Erwin, Tn. I have always enjoyed talking with Puff, as she is so friendly. I have not seen them for about 500 miles. She had to slow down yesterday, and only do 8 miles because she started getting leg cramps. That allowed the Colonel and me to catch up with them. About 10:00, I had to pull the hiking poles back out of my pack. We started climbing hills. For most the day yesterday they were in my pack during the traverse of the level stretch of about 14+ miles. Yesterday we ate mulberries as we hiked, right along the trail, by the hand full. Today was cherries, many cherry trees are producing very sweet cherries. And blackberries also. When we stopped for lunch, we met a couple from the Boston area . They were slack packing and doing big sections of the trail. They gave us a Trail Magic, nice cold ice water as we had our lunch and relaxed. The rocky trail was wearing us down, and we couldn’t catch Tejas and Zey as they made town before us. As we started the decent down to Duncannon, their was a beautiful view called Hawk Rock. This was the first spectacular view for the week. The Colonel and I were excited to start the steep hill downward. We had Trail Magic waiting for us at the Parking area below. A generous person was wanting to do a special blessing for us. “Preowned” had started his thru-hike this year on February 8. Because of knee pain from his torn meniscus, he had to stop his attempt at Neel Gap. He has since hiked many miles as a section hiker. Preowned let me know about 10 days ago that he wanted to help us out since he had been following my posts. Colonel and I enjoyed being shuttled to a supermarket to resupply, then we headed to a BBQ restaurant for dinner. After stuffing ourselves, Preowned opened his home to us for laundry, showers, great trail conversation, and relaxing sleep. I am starting to really grasp the goodness of our countries individuals. I need to be pinched again. Backwoods could not believe it when I told her this evening….”your kidding me?” In other great news, for everyone that has been concerned and/ or praying about my infection in my shin: I took my last dose of antibiotics tonight, and had zero shin pain as I hiked today!!! I am excited, first day Since June 9th. Today makes 15 days if you are keeping score. Thank you Lord Jesus. And thank you Preowned for your gracious hospitality. -beavER","Carlisle, Pa.

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639877,"The alarm was set early this morning (4:30 am), but we woke up before it went off. We had to be ready to head back to the trail at five, Preowned was working with his son. He needed to get to his work site early. So we we headed back to the trail head, we thanked Preowned again for being so gracious. As he drove away, Colonel and I began our walk through Duncannon, as the trail goes right through the middle of town. We headed to a restaurant that serves breakfast by the infamous Doyle hotel. The restaurant didn’t open till seven it was a little after six, so we didn’t feel like waiting and getting behind schedule. We went up the road  to an intersection before we cross the Susquehanna River. A Hiker told us there was a Pilot Truck Stop off the trail about 2/10 of a mile. So we went up there to buy some cereal and milk, and had our breakfast at a picnic table outside the Pilot station. We had a long climb after we crossed the rivers on the highway bridges. As soon as we came out of town we crossed the Juniata and the Susquehanna Rivers. The bridge walks were fun, and the sites were amazing. The Susquehanna is one of the widest rivers I have seen. One cool thing we saw was a plaque that showed the history of the river. It told of the original ferry, and then the covered bridge that spanned the river. It was built around the 1820’s. The covered bridge lasted until the 1920’s. That would have been amazing to see. It would not see a car until it was about 75 years old. After we reached the end of the bridges, we went straight up. Once we were on the ridge, we were hoping for smooth trails. No such luck as Rocksylvania trails were what we had. We rested our feet as we took lunch, socks and shoes off. Then we continued making our way to our campsite. After lunch we started hiking and found 2 gallons of water cashe at the trail head, Colonel and I needed water to make it to the campsite. As we hiked along the ridge, we ran into a mother and father and two sons. One of the sons had thru-hiked last year, his trail name is Grizz. The family was giving out Trail Magic. We took some oranges, brownies, and and Rice Crispy treats. We also found out that Grizz was the one that left the water cashe back at the trail head. The trail had less rocks for a short while as we kept going north. Then later is had more difficult rocks. We had some awesome views. We have been missing them over the last couple of weeks. We came up to a nice overlook, and the name of it is Kinter View. As I climbed out to the rocks to find a place to sit, I looked down and I was surprised to see two northern copperheads curled up together right where I was going to put my feet. I then found a rattlesnake underneath some low hanging leaves. it was in the shade. We did not feel comfortable as we finished our break. We hiked on and felt better to get away from Copper Head Den. The trail stayed tough the rest of the way. We made it to a large camping area for the night by a nice stream. A gentleman named Al was given out Trail Magic at the parking lot as we arrived. It was a long day, and a good day. -beavER","Duncannon, Pa.-Inn Road AT Parking

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639918,"We started out the morning with a long gradual climb up from the campgrounds. We ran into Kiki and Puff shortly after we hit the trail. Puff is doing better with no leg cramps yesterday or today. As we crested the mountain, the Colonel and I found a great campsite with rock chairs around the fire pit. They were comfortable and we were tempted to take a nap in them. Kiki and Puff came around the corner, and we ask Kiki to get a picture of us reclining. Later in the afternoon, we hiked past a bog caused by a huge beaver dam. The trail has been rerouted to allow hikers to keep their shoes dry and clean. The adventurist ones can ford the bog and try to keep the mud and muck off your shoes by walking and balancing on logs. Of course, you know that I would love to go past the beaver dam. So a mucking we will go! Neither of us had our shoes get submerged, others that tried the route were not so lucky today. As we made the climb up and away from the dam, I was leading. The Colonel was curious why I stopped abruptly as we were in full stride. “What are you stopping for?” was his question. “Rattle Snake”, was my answer. One was coiled up and rattling about 7 feet in front of me, and it seemed angry. I got a 8 foot long branch to coax it into moving off the trail. We have seen many snakes over the last few days. Our main concern today was trying to get reservations for when we get to Port Clinton/ Hamburg, Pa. area in a few days. It is a major stop for us. When we get there, we must prepare to leave out and tackle some of the most difficult miles of the whole AT. Rocksylvania will become ROCKSYLVANIA!!! It is impossible for me to share the difficulty, pain, physical stress, danger, agony, anger, fear, and total exhaustion you must battle through to complete your passage of the last 80 miles of treacherous rocks in Pennsylvania. I have been dreading it, but if you know me, you know I am excited about an all out challenge! With the importance of being ready, we of course we’re having trouble finding a hotel. Everything was booked. It is also hard to investigate hotels as you are hiking on dangerous rocks while you are getting an unexpected rain shower. We ask Double Take, Colonels friend, to help us find something. Since he is back in Michigan recovering from his shoulder injury, he was able to find a B & B that had openings. Right after we had made reservations, I heard the unwanted, but familiar sound, from behind me. It is similar to 4 large watermelons hitting the ground at the same time. The crashing vibrations caused me to immediately turn around and witness Colonel rolling as he had lost his footing on the damp rocks. All was good he reported after he had a few moments to compose himself. Thank you Lord. Our target to camp was Mile’s up a steep climb toward the end of the day. We were forced to carry extra water up with us as there are no springs or streams on the ridge. So not only did we have to climb, we also had 5 extra pounds of water in our packs for dinner and breakfast. The stealth campsite at the summit was available when we reached the top…. We both let out a shout of excitement as we saw the site was larger to hold both our tents, and no one was there. Happy times. Colonel taught me a new saying today he learned from an instructor: “Everyday is a Holiday, and every meal is a Feast!” -beavER","

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639964,"Milestone of the day… crossed the 1,200 mile mark. Now Mile’s remaining are only 3 digit numbers, 999, 998, 997, … Nothing we had hung up overnight was dry. Everything was actually wetter. The humidity was about 100%. We were in a cloud of moister. We started our hike this morning already at the top of the climb so we only have a few ups and downs but no major climbs until later in the day. Right off the bat we got in some heavy duty Pennsylvania rocks. We stopped at an Overlook, we saw the fog that engulfed us last night was finally start to break, the humidity was so high everything was covered in moisture. So we have to be really careful about the rocks being slick and wet. When we get to the William Penn Shelter, we had to go way down to the spring to refill. But we ran into Kiki and Puff, they were filling up with water. It was nice to see them this morning. Kiki is a forest ranger from Montana, Glacier National Park. As we were talking we found out that Puff won’t let Kiki Slack Back. She’s a (Purist), a believer in only caring your pack every step of the way on the trail. So I gave her a fist bump! She thought she and Kiki were the only ones they have not Slack Packed. I told her I have not Slack Packed, so there is at least 3 people. For lunch, we stopped at the 501 shelter. Named that because it is right by US 501. It has a solar shower (just hooked up to the garden hose coming from the caretakers house), so it’s a little cool, but it was very nice to take a shower.  Both Colonel and I took a shower. 30 minutes after we started hiking, the humidity and sweat caused us to fell as if we had not showered. My clothes were so saturated, that I did not have a dry spot anywhere. I had difficulty trying to use my phone, screen was wet, and my hands were wet. I could not get it to work. Today the Pennsylvania Rocks were difficult. My feet were sore by the end of the day. I had to do some blister tape after I had a chance to clean up in the tent. We stopped at a tent site and were the only 2 there. Nemis & Starbucks camped about a half mile before us. They are a friendly young couple we have been leap frogged for the last couple of days. Warm and sticky night. -beavER","Stealth Camp- Mile 1187.1

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640012,"The alarm was set again this morning, this time for 5:00 am. We beat our goal to be on the trail by 6. We wanted to make the post office in Port Clinton before they closed. We both had resupplies there… we hoped. Today continued the extremely high humidity, it was not going anywhere, but temperature was rising to a high of 93. The one problem I had to try to countermeasure with the humidity was my phone. The issue the humidity causes is I am covered in sweat, my clothes are saturated, not a dry spot anywhere. Normally my shirt tail is dry enough to get moisture off my phone and hands. Not the last 2 days. With my phone in my shorts pocket, the screen is always soaked. With sweat covered hands, I can’t make the screen work. Today, I tried putting my phone in a ziplock bag, and having a camp towel hanging on my backpack. It helped, but it is not a simple process to access my Guthooks app quickly. Guthooks is what has all my maps, and information about the AT. Example: where is the next spring for water. I need to do access the app a hundred times in a normal day. Plus, I take 15-25 pictures per day on average. Today was also a tough day on our feet because of all the rocks. I was hurting because of blisters starting under my calluses. Both my heels, on the outsides. The jagged rocks are always pushing against the outside of your shoe. It is impossible to describe the force the rocks put on your aching feet. Almost never does you foot feel comfortable when you place it down.Today became a memorable and bitter sweet day at 10:00. The Colonel and I stopped at Eagles Nest Shelter to take a break. We took the .3 mile side trail so we could use the privy and relax our feet for a few minutes as well as fill up on water. As we sat at the picnic table eating our energy snacks, Colonel reveled to me that he was going to have to end this thru-hike. I have been concerned this was coming, as he has dropped a few hints that it might. It boils down to a simple truth for many that partake in this adventure. The cost can be high. Not only physically, mentally, emotionally, but also financially. I have seen it take a toll on many. Colonel has a budget, and because of the high cost he has encountered to resupply, he has exceeded his budget. He is on a gluten free diet because of health reasons. Gluten free food cost more, and is difficult to find in small areas. We sat and discussed the direct impact details, like how he would get home, then he joked, to break the mood, that Backwoods would be mad because he would not be around to keep an eye on me to keep me out of trouble. I joked back that my daughter Britt, would be the one that would be mad because he promised her to keep an eye on me when he met her. He has done that, and much more. I have made a lifelong friend. Later I shared pictures of my grandsons in their military outfits and told him I wanted him to come visit them in Kentucky because they will want to meet the infamous “Colonel” some day. I wanted to cherish the friendship, and linger, but I knew we had to start our hike again, a hike to the end of our pathway together, side by side. As we left the shelter, we came to the spring where we needed to refill our water. Nemos was there getting water for himself and Starbucks. He got excited as soon as he saw Colonel, and he asked if he had lost his flag. Colonel has been carrying a US flag ever since Memorial Day weekend. And for good reason, as the Colonel was a marine. Once a marine, always a marine. He has it flying from the back of his back. It had been pulled from his pack as he ducked to stoop under a low hanging tree in an area that needs trail maintenance. Nemos was a half hour behind us, and saw it lying on the ground. In hopes that it was Colonel’s, he picked it up and carried it until he could return it. The thing that made this event priceless was that Colonel had picked up a water bottle yesterday that was laying along side of the trail. He carried it (actually stuck it in my pack as a great friend would do!), and later we found out it was Nemos’ bottle he had dropped. Water bottles are very precious out here in 93 degree heat! The trail slowly beat us down as we finished the Miles to Port Clinton. I continued to remind myself, “this is the easy part of Pennsylvania!” We were able to distract ourself’s by talking and joking much of the way. With one mile to go we started the steep 1,000 foot decent to Port Clinton. It was the worst, and steepest trial I have seen since we started in Georgia. The footing was also loose gravel type material in some places, I was just thankful it was a dry day, but also thinking about those poor souls that would be trying this on the next rainy day. At the bottle of the hill, we came upon a railroad and saw the Port Clinton Railway Station. There was many people walking around with cameras. They all seemed to be waiting for something. One of the gentlemen informed us that a train would be coming in just a few minutes if we wanted to stay and watch it pass. I did as I love trains. I took a video, and found out later that this was a brand new engine’s maiden voyage. Our timing was perfect. We headed over to the post office to check on our resupplies. Mine was there, but not Colonel’s. This too worked out for the best, I needed mine, but Colonel did not. He asked the attendant to make a note to “return to sender” his package. That works out best for him since there is no reason for him to carry a weeks worth of food back home if it can be mailed at no extra cost. We are staying at the Bismark B & B in Hamburg, Pa. The owner, Charlotte, came to pick us up at the post office. We walked to a nice restaurant and then the grocery before heading back to relax for the evening. Charlotte already is planning to make us gluten free waffles for breakfast. -beavER","Tent-site mile 1205.1

Charlotte, the owner, has been so wonderful taking good care of the Colonel and me, I can’t thank her enough. Colonel texted me early to inform me he was enjoying the morning on the front porch of this grand Victorian bed and breakfast home in Hamburg, Pa. The original owners had the home built in 1910. The owned the local broom textile factory. Backwoods would love all the stain glass windows and doors, and the beautiful staircase. The breakfast was wonderful as we ate in the large dining room. The order of the morning was to get the Colonel to the Redding Airport to pick up a rental car. He was making the drive home early from recommendations from Avis. This insured him of getting a car for one way travel. Charlotte took our picture together for the last time in the parking lot, and I shook hands and gave him a hug as we said our good byes at the counter. I had to leave quickly as the dust was getting thick in the area. I will miss him laughing at my stupid jokes. Charlotte dropped me off at the town grocery so I could buy the last resupply items I need, then I walked the mile back in the 93 degree sunshine. The day flew by as I finished preparing to hike out tomorrow morning. Calls to my wife, daughter, son, son-in-law, grandsons, and friends filled much of my time. I also was able to get the checkbook balanced. It is amazing how quickly a zero day flies by.

Charlotte delivered me to the post office at Port Clinton. I began the solo walk toward the trail. The walk went down Broad Street for just a block, and I turned left at the Port Clinton Fire Company, back onto the AT trail. The trail was just in town for a short amount of time and then back into the woods. As it started up the climb, I had a Star-Spangled Banner flying on the back of my pack that I got from the Colonel. He ask for me to carry it until I find a memorial to plant the flag. The humidity was through the roof again, it did not take long before I was covered in sticky sweat. I made it up to pulpit rock which has good views. I decided to take a break at the Lehigh Valley Astrological site. They have the domes for telescopes. I called Backwards to check in with her and see how she’s doing? Another 2 miles from the Pulpit, are the Pinnacles which has rock outcroppings, and where you can see into the valley below. It was a good place to stop, so I took my lunch there in the shade. The trail was rocky between the Pulpit and the Pinnacles. The rest of the day was a mix of not too bad to rocky. I had trouble with my new blisters under my calluses on both heels. I pulled up after 15 miles to give my feet a break. The Eckville Shelter has a nice tent area with a solar shower. I used it to clean off the sweat, and felt better. I had little to no motivation today. Maybe we will have rains this evening as a cold front moves through.

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640162,"Last night before the rain started, we did get trail magic at the shelter from 2 different sources. A couple that section hikes in this area brought drinks in a cooler, I took 2 Gatorade. About 30 minutes later, a lady brought a fresh watermelon. It was ripe and juicy. Everyone loved it. Around 8:15 pm last night, the rains started. It rained hard. The large water droplets pounded the tent. My tent did fine during the deluge. For most of the night it rained, but we had a small window of opportunity to break camp with no rain this morning. We took advantage to get on the trail. The rains came back at 9:00. It rained for most of the day. Some periods of rain were heavy. This constant rain made the rocks slick and dangerous. After I made it to the shelter I was stopping at for the night, I realized this was one of the more difficult hiking days I have experienced this year. My right heel did much better today, but my left one did not. It hurt all day from the blister under a callous. Almost every step is painful. Some of the rocks today were to the point of “are you kidding me?” There were 2 different places where I know Backwoods could not have hiked through. One called Knifes Edge, and the other was Bake Oven Knob. I was close to not being able to safely traverse the sections. I made it out will only a tweaked left ankle and bumps and bruises. I left a few comments behind also. With all the slick rocks, I nearly slipped off many times. It was hard to keep traction. Today I only saw Dark Web and Bald Eagle. We ended up at the same shelter. No other hikers showed up. Dark Web is sleeping in his tent. Bald Eagle and I are staying in the shelter since it is forecast to rain all night.

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640234,"Last night Bald Eagle and I were sound asleep in the shelter. At 10:30 pm Bodacious and Mouse came rolling in, soaking wet and tired. They both are in their mid twenties. I asked them how they handled the crazy rock traverse in the dark and wet conditions. They said they fell a copy of times each. We had set up our sleeping pads on the outsides of the shelter floor, so they were able to set up easily in the middle. That is one problem with being it a shelter, people can show up at all hours. I did not have any trouble sleeping, and was up by 5:30. Bald Eagle and I hiked out together at 7:00 and stuck together all day. It was not long before he said to me, “I see how the day is going to go!” He was referring to all the rocks we were encountering. We worked our way down to Lehigh River, and then crossed on a long highway bridge. It was a great view of the river and old stone buildings. Then we started up the climb of the open rocks of Blue Mountain. As you ascended, you could look down on the river valley views. The climb was very technical with many hand over hand movements as you passed over thousands of boulders. Eventually we reached the summit and found a surprise crop of blueberries. We stopped and harvested a few handfuls. They were delicious. Bald Eagle and I had our sights set on Blue Mountain Ski Resort to stop for lunch at about 11 miles. We had learned it was about a half mile off the trail, and they had a grill. We could also fill up our water bottles there, and that is a big deal in this section. We would be in the middle of a stretch of no water for 14 miles unless you take a side trip of about 1.2 miles down and up a steep slope to get to a spring. We made it to the resort and the maintenance guys saw us and invited us into their shop area. They let us use their bathroom, and they allowed us to hand wash shirts and socks in their utility sink and use their industrial dryers. We could recharge phone in outlets and refill water from their cooler. The guys were extremely hiker friendly. After we cleaned up, we headed to the grill and had cheeseburgers. The resort has plenty of things going on in the summer. We saw a large group of young kids doing a rope challenge course and a wedding party was preparing for the holy union that was scheduled for the afternoon. Since we had “camel-ed” up on water, we were able to stop where ever we wished for the night. The next shelter was too far up, so we wanted to hike about another 5 miles then stop. As we were hiking, we heard thunder, and it was getting closer. I pulled up radar and saw that a severe weather front was rapidly approaching. I warned Bald Eagle, we needed to find a tent site quickly. Each spot we saw for the next 10 minutes had a dead tree looming. We knew that would be a bad idea as we could feel the winds picking up. As the dark clouds closed in on us, we raced up the trail and found a stealth spot we kcould put our tents that were not covered with rocks. Just as we secured our last tent poles, the storm hit. I pushed my backpack inside, and then hastily climbed through the tent door. The flash of lighting hitting close was echoed with thunder. After 2 hours, the rain let up and I was able to get out to put up my bear bag on a tree branch. My feet hurt today until lunch time. I was able to set my shoes in the sun as I ate my cheeseburger. The dry shoes and socks made a big difference. I was much more comfortable hiking after lunch. -beavER","

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640293,"We had a very strong rain all night, I was able to stay dry in the tent. The rain stopped as the sun was starting to rise. The problem was the trees had so much water in them the moisture  continued to fall because it was so wet. I decided to skip breakfast and just eat some energy bars and go ahead and get on the trail. The Leroy Smith shelter was about 6 1/2 miles up the trail. Once I arrived, I pulled my wet tent out, and let it dry out. As I was there, Bald Eagle made it and he got his tent out to dry it also. We had some good conversation about motivation and how you keep your attitude positive when you continue to go through rocky sections like this. He told me he had good prayer this morning while hiking to the shelter. He’s asking God to remind him exactly why he was doing this, and he said he got nothing as far as an answer. I said there’s your answer, it’s for the peace and quiet! We talked about our goals for the day and tomorrow making Delaware gap. As the afternoon unfolded, I ran into Walkman, the 20 year old from Austin. I have not seen him since Daleville. The rains came back around 1:00 and continued all day. As I was coming down the homestretch of the last 3 miles, rain was getting a little more steady and I heard thunder cracking over my right shoulder and it was loud. The rocks have been relentless today, there are taking a toll on my body, I don’t have much left in my legs. My feet are still hurting, but I pushed through. The Kirkridge Shelter was a welcomed site. I was able to get in out of the cool rain and cook dinner in the dry. Both Bald Eagle and I decided to stay in the shelter instead of setting up tents in the rain. There is a young couple here also, they are from Southern California. Bald Eagle and I plan to see if we can make it to Delaware Water Gap early so we can attend worship service. -beavER","Stealth Campsite as Storm Hits

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640336,"Have you ever had something you knew was going to be extremely difficult to complete? Every since I had learned about the AT, I had a healthy “fear” of Pennsylvania. One description I heard from a Thru-Hiker was, “rocks so pointed that they appeared to be sharped by files on purpose.” Another Thru-hiker (2019) that became a mentor for me, Shock Top, said this, “Pennsylvania rocks are worse than they say. I have no solutions for that.” She was right, I can’t put into words how difficult, challenging, stressful, and painful the last 75 Mile’s have been. As Backwoods likes to say, “Things aren’t as bad as they seem, there’re worse!” That was so true, especially as you add the cold rain for icing on the slick rocks. But on the trail as in life, when things are out of your control, and so tough you can’t see the light at the end of the tunnel… concentrate of the next step. Set small obtainable goals (make it to the next big tree, then take a short break), but keep moving forward. Sometimes you have to go sideways to move forward. A man I hold in high regards from my church, Paul Rainey, has the saying, “sometimes it’s easier to plow around the stump.” In other words, go around the roadblocks, but keep moving. I have lost 2 hiking buddies in Pa. If you have been following me, you know I lost my now close friend, the Colonel, just last week. This morning, my friend Tejas, let me know that foot pain was getting him off the trail for awhile. His son Zey is still going strong. The fear of injury is real, especially as you see people have to put their dream on hold. Believe me, there were literally hundreds of slips, stumbles, near falls, and busted toes, over this stretch. Thank you Lord that I should pass into New Jersey tomorrow. I think I will kiss the sign and send a pic to my son-in-law, since he is from the Garden State. Just Pinch Me! We have the light of tunnel’s end in our sight. Last night, as the rains fell at the shelter, Bald Eagle told me that he would like to get rolling early with me to make the church service. We made plans to jump up at 5:00 am and be hiking at 6 to reach the Presbyterian Church in time to shower before the 10:00 service. They have a hike hostel at the church. The hostel is a much better option than the inflated hotel prices of the holiday. We made it with ease as we knocked out the 6.5 miles. The light of the sun’s rays were so stunning as we hiked down the mountain I could not believe it. I captured some of my best pics of the whole journey. I kept thinking of my sweetheart Backwoods, as she loves sun beams. The service was great as they had a special presentation by the caretaker of the hostel we are staying. David’s lesson was on his adventure of when he summited Denali. The highest peak in North America, at 20,000 feet. After the service, we washed our clothes by hand, hung them out, then headed to a local establishment for BBQ. The community also had a band that played old rock and roll music for everyone at the park. Fireworks will keep us awake this evening way past our normal bedtime. The anxiety over the challenge of Rocksylvania had come with a tenacious vengeance, but its now in the rearview mirror. Tomorrow will reveal more difficulties, but for now I celebrate. -beavER","Kirkridge Shelter

On the way to the bakery, I stopped to plant the American flag I have been carrying at the base of the town’s Military Memorial. The flag was Colonel’s, and he ask me to carry it until I found a war memorial. As we hiked out of town, I got a really good laugh. As I was going up the street with my backpack, I heard somebody yell, “hey beavER!” from behind me. I looked back and it was two gentlemen on bicycles doing their early morning workout. They were wearing Tour de France outfits, and coming up the hill hard. My good friend Hal would have appreciated them since he is a huge cyclist. It was two gentlemen from the church service yesterday, they recognized me. We had also talked during the concert. As they rode by, we had a quick conversation about things we had seen and done the day before. I could not help but laugh about how trail life is so interesting. I am guessing I will run into people years from now all over the country. It is a small world after all.Less than a half mile from leaving town, we headed across the Delaware River. I had gotten a hundred meters ahead of Bald Eagle, but all of the sudden, I realized I needed to wait on him. I had come to the Pennsylvania/ New Jersey state line marking. I needed someone to take a photo and video of me acting stupid. I know, it’s not an act… I had fun kissing the ground to show how excited I was to be in Jersey. Our hike was short today, but we had great views. We went past Sun Fish Pond, and made it to the AMC’s Mohican Outdoor Center. It is a old style camp with cabins and campgrounds with a lake. Bald Eagle had wanted to stay here as he made his hike plan. We decided to stop here to give our feet and bodies another day to recover. Milestone of the day beside making it to my 8th state was passing the 1,300 mile mark, yeah! One other cool thing we came across today was a large Christian Camp group that was hiking. I am guessing it was about 35 kids. -beavER","Delaware Water Gap

We wanted to get miles in before the mid ninety heat hit. I wanted to take a early shower because it would be days before I have another chance. The morning started nice and trail was a mix of dirt and rocky. The hike today was marked by really good views as we were surrounded by lakes, and many places we had an overlook to see them. The highlight for me was coming to a large beaver pond. We had a great view of the beaver lodge. I had fun taking pictures of their handy work. Bald Eagle and I were able to climb a fire tower and have a great 360 degree view of the New Jersey landscape. We took an early lunch break at an outcropping that looked Dow on a lake that had sailboats cruising around. Bald Eagle and I had time today to share in great conversation about life changing events we have experienced. Then it started getting hot and humid. I think I Sweat it more than I have any other day of hiking. I took my shirt off and wrung it out two different times, and it’s a shirt that should be wicking, and not have moisture buildup. The trail became rocky for most of the afternoon. We made it to the shelter as a thunderstorm was bearing down on us. I had just enough time to get my tent up and throw my backpack inside. Then I took one last look up to make sure I did not see any dead limbs before I jumped in. The tent gives you a false sense of security from the thin layer of material that makes up the shell. The storm raged for about an hour. After the worst was over, I headed to the shelter to collect water for dinner. It was a blessing that we started early this morning, if we hadn’t, the storm would had pounded us up on the open ridge. -beavER","Mohican Outdoor Center

The mosquitos were terrible. He said he will have to wait to see how many welts he has from the bites. To sum up today’s hike for me, hot and muggy. We made it to Marcia Lake picnic area, which is part of High Point State Park. We ordered food there, and were allowed to take a free shower. It lasted about an hour before I was covered in sweat again. The heat index today was 101. We did receive trail magic from Jill and Lisa, two nice young women who had decided to help hikers. Ice cold water, Gatorade, fruit, and other snacks. We made it to Unionville, NY. They allow free camping in the city park, so we set up and are now waiting for the rains to come. Forecast changed, so maybe not until the morning.
Today was a special day for Bald Eagle. He had two cool things happen. As he was hiking ahead of me, he saw 5 young bear cubs with their mama. Some of them went up trees, and the mama bear came and got them out. I did not get to see any of them just 2 minutes behind him. The second thing that happened can only be explained by “it’s a small world!” Bald Eagle lost his wife in 2019. She was originally from Jamaica, and I migrated to the US when she was young. Part of Bald Eagle’s hike is to promote the healing process. We past a group of inner city young ladies that were out hiking. As Bald Eagle was having a pleasant conversation with a camp counselor at the rear of the group, he caught something in her voice. He ask her if she was from Jamaica? He was right as she replied yes mon. He ask her if she knew the small village his wife was from, Maypan? As she was answering him, she was talking with someone on her phone at the same time. Yes mon, I know exactly where Maypan is, she told him she was actually speaking to someone in  Maypan right that instant. She gave Bald Eagle the phone and let him talk to Naz. During their conversation, Bald Eagle ask Naz if he knew his wife’s sisters and brothers by name, to Bald Eagles surprise, he new all the family members he ask about. He had even gone to school with 2 of his wife’s sisters. When Bald Eagle told me about what just happened, you could see the shear joy and happiness in his expression.

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640561,"Since we camped In the city park, it was easy to head over to Horler’s General Store for breakfast. The workers had given us a warning when we ask them last night what time did they open? They told us, “we open at 6, but we suggest that you don’t get here until 7… the manger will be by himself.” We like to live on the edge, so we showed up at 6:15. He did ok, and we enjoyed all the great hospitality we received there. We had to walk out of New York, back into Jersey to get back on the trail. The morning started with level hiking on good terrain for miles. We then went around a wildlife preserve for more flat hiking. The rains started about 10:00, and continued for most of the afternoon. I was happy when they finally started because the humidity was so high. I had been sweating so much over the last few days, I had started to cramp up. The most trouble I have with the humidity is getting my iPhone to work. Once the screen becomes wet and my fingers are the same, it is difficult to do anything. Another issue is I am soaked from head to toe, not a dry spot anywhere to wipe my hands or phone on. I finally came up with a solution today that seems to work. I wrap my phone in my small camp towel, then put the wrapped phone in a ziplock. When I want to use it, I can wipe my fingers on the towel. Once the rains hit harder, we started climbs on rocky sections. Then we had a 2 mile hike in a marsh that was in boardwalks. My feet was happy! We had a  steep climb up Pinwheel Vista, a little over 1000 feet. The nickname of the mountain is Stairway to Heaven. That was tough, and Bald Eagle and I decided to take a short break at the top. As I was sitting there, I heard a familiar deep voice say, “hey beavER!” from behind me… it was Dady Long Legs with Parker his dog. I looked farther back and saw Honey Bun coming up close behind. They both had smiles that made my day! And they were both sweating like I have been, so that made me feel better to know I am not the only one dying in the heat. We visited and caught up on some of the things the trail is doing for us, then they needed to get moving as they wanted to hike another 14 miles to meet Honey Bun’s friend that was going to take them to her house. They want to get off the trail for the high winds that will be coming tonight from tropical storm Elsa. I really enjoy spending time with them as they are so nice. It was a high blessing to spend just a few moments with them as our paths crossed again. One other highlight of the day was seeing a four foot black snake taking his time to cross in front of me. I put the breaks on hard when I came up to it. We made it to a small shelter before the evening storms hit. The shelter has room for six, but so far there is just 4 of us in it as darkness is settling in ahead of the storm. We don’t want to be in out tents with wind speeds forecast at over 50 mph. -beavER","Unionville, NY.

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640669,"It rained all night hard, and continued to rain in the morning, so Bald Eagle and I stayed in the shelter for longer than normal. As we waited for the rain to let up, I repaired my water filter bag that had a small leak. At 9 o’clock, I couldn’t stand it anymore, so I started hiking even though it was still raining. After I was about 50 feet from the shelter, the rain began to intensify. 100 feet later, it was an all out downpour. Eventually I had to stop and retrieve my raincoat out of my pack, I was started to get chilled. The trail had many puddles this morning for me to navigate. It finally stopped raining about 11:00. Our original hike plan for the day was only 12 miles to Wildcat Shelter. With a late start, and more rain forecast to hit around 4:00. As I was approaching the New Jersey/ New York State line, I began  traversing a rocky section with very slippery lichen (moss). Suddenly I came up to a young lady backpacker that was sitting. Her trail name was Burn. She had fallen because of the light green moss that was on the rocks, and she hit her side. She said it’s gonna leave a bruise, but she’s gonna be Ok, she thinks. From that point on, I knew I needed to take care. I got to the New Jersey/ New York state line about 15 minutes later. Eight states complete, I’m starting in my ninth state- New York, yeah. Burn and I shared taking each other’s photo at the border. Shortly after entering New York, we came to a flag on a high point. It signified the highest point of the AT in New York. At that point, we could see the City Skyline. It was surreal. I was able to get a video. Bald Eagle caught up with me there and we celebrated since he is originally from New York. Soon we were walking on the large rocks on NY trails. That’s when it got ugly. I knew the rocks were extra slick, but I almost went down. My feet slipped and I recovered somehow. The problem was that they looked dry, but looks can be deceiving. Next was Bald Eagle’s turn. As he walked in front of me, all I could do was watch his feet go out from under him, down he went. His pack took some of the force, but his right elbow took a hard hit. After about 3 large bandages and lots of tape, he was ready to try again. The second time he went down, was not as bad on his body, but his hiking pole snapped in half. We were able to rig it by using rocks to beat the pole into shape to put it back together. A little shorter, but usable. It had gotten to the point that we were afraid to come down any of the rock faces. Then, our new friend Jeopardy, a 22 year old hiker, showed up. We have been hiking with him the last couple of days. After we talked about the celebration of being in NY, and the slick rocks, he took a few steps, then went down hard. He took one on the left hip. Bald Eagle was behind him watching, and then he proceeded to fall on the same downward slope rock. As was ahead looking back, Bald Eagle said it was a Roller Derby pile up. Once I knew they were ok, I wanted to take a picture because it reminded me of a slap stick silent movie scene. A few minutes later, Jeopardy, went down again, this time it was his right hip. The score at this point was: Burn 1, beavER near miss, Bald Eagle 3, Jeopardy 2. It was crazy. From that point on, it was like walking on egg shells. The excitement for the day was heading to an Ice Cream Shop that was very new and clean. It was a 10 minute walk off the trail. The popular place was also very hiker friendly, so all the Thru-hikers we have seen in the last 2 days were all there. Good times, I had cookies and cream, 2 scoops! We also ate lunch there. About 30 minutes after we arrived, Jeopardy showed up and let us know he went down one more time to tie Bald Eagle with 3 falls. All the other young hikers said they fell as well. I am thinking the problem came from all the rain and extremely high humidity. After the sun came out, we did not have the same issues. We changed our hike plans as we ate ice cream. The rain forecast was pushed back until late, so we added miles. We found a great stealth spot on top of a mountain.

As I am typing this, I am looking out at the skyline of NY city from the shelter we climbed up to stay at tonight. My hiking friend, Double Take, had told me about this shelter and the views. He did the same thing on his Thru-hike in 2019. As the dusk settles over New York City, the lights appear as a jewel necklace on the horizon. It is an amazing mix between the white lights from the building windows, and the flashing red images from the skyscrapers. The shelter is about 40 miles away from Manhattan. We started the day as normal, the rains last night ended before sunrise, so we were able to hit the trail by 7:00. The terrain today was marked by aggressive climbs with hand over hand climbing and steep downhills. We had great views today, and our lunch break was at a beautiful lake that the trail took us beside. There were ripe blueberries to eat as we hiked. We crossed over Interstate 87, and later in the day crossed the Palisades Parkway. We had to walk directly through the traffic for both lanes, and cars are doing about 90 mile an hour. Bald Eagle joked that the trail, as we were in the highway median, was foot traffic only. We had made it our goal to get to West Mountain Shelter because of the views of the city. The climbs took a toll on our legs, but as we made it to the summit of Black Mountain, the next to last climb, we got a boost to help us keep going. Two helicopters flew directly over us and then off into the gorgeous surroundings. As we climbed down Black Mountain, I felt the excitement of being able to see the city at night. The views did not disappoint us once darkness fell. We also enjoyed fireworks being shot off down below us. The climb up to the shelter was harder than normal because we had to pack extra water. The shelter has none. Right before we made the turn off the trail to walk over a half of a mile to the shelter, we passed the 1,400 mile mark. I will be pondering about this milestone for sometime. It almost seemed out of reach when I was discussing 1400 miles with Pinch, as we visited back at the Standing Bear Hostel, close to the Smokey’s. It was the point where he and Pistol had to end their 2016 thru-hike attempt. My friend Tejas let me know tonight that he is ending his attempt in New Jersey. His foot pain is too much, and he is worried it could lead to permanent damage. He will continue to support his son, Zey, as he hikes on. We hope to have an easy 7 Miles to town tomorrow morning before the rains hit.

We were still excited as we hiked the .6 mile side trail back to the AT from the shelter. We had a long downhill, then a big climb up Bear Mountain. On the way up, we saw Old Yeller and Linger. They are 2 young hikers we have been leap frogging for days. They are nice, and we always enjoy talking with them. They are hiking friends and are supported by both sets of parents as they hike. Their parents are always doing trail magic and slack packing them. Once we made our last climb on this short day, we saw many tourist/ day hikers on Bear Mountain. It has a road up to the summit with a Observation Tower and parking lot. It’s trails were huge and well maintained. It felt as if we had transitioned to another planet from the forest we had just been climbing and sweating in. On the way down the decent, there were about 850 stone steps, and ripe raspberries to pick and enjoy as we hiked. Most of the day hikers just walked past the delicious fruit without knowing it was there. The wide open trail gave us views of the half mile long Bear Mountain Bridge we will cross tomorrow over the Hudson River. At the bottom of the climb, we walked into a huge family atmosphere at the Bear Mountain Recreation area. Since it was Sunday Morning, families were filling the picnic areas with food and games. As we passed Hessian Lake, we came to Bear Mountain Zoo. It is a free zoo to the public and the AT trail goes right through the middle. I was able to video 2 large bears, since I have not seen any on the trail in awhile. Once we made it pass the zoo, we had to cross traffic again before the bridge. The AT officially has you cross at a spot that does not even have pedestrian markings… much more dangerous than the bears. The caretaker from the Bear Mtn. Bridge Motel came to pick us up at the huge traffic circle that is almost finished with its construction. Grandpa is an interesting character that does not hold any of his opinions back. He also enjoys good conversation. The Motel was built in the 1920s, but is well maintained. We headed to local deli that Grandpa recommended. As we arrived, the staff was just putting his key in the lock to close up the store that was already dark. He graciously opened back up and spent 15 minutes making us subs to go. Whew, we just barely made it to have a great lunch. After doing our chores, we headed to the BBQ restaurant to enjoy dinner. We capped off the night by watching a NBA playoff game. This was weird, as TV is not a part of our world. Tomorrow morning I need to hit the Post Office at 8:00 am to procure my resupply package as they open.

But the forecast of rain and high humidity made us wonder how we would do. After a great night’s sleep in the Motel, We headed to Perry’s Deli for breakfast. Pancakes, French toast, eggs, and small drink for $7.00… I love New York so far. We took some pics with Perry, me was very funny and he loves hikers. Went to the post office at 8:00 to pick up my resupply. It was there, and no problems. That is always a big concern. Many hikers have trouble with the mail service, but Backwoods has been mailing my packages plenty early, so no trouble for me so far. After I had everything stowed in my pack, we told Grandpa we were ready to shuttle back to the bridge to cross the Hudson River. Crossing over the Bear Mountain Bridge was a blast. I am not sure who enjoyed it more, me or Bald Eagle. He told me that West Point was to our left up the Hudson. The views we had as we crossed were great. Once we were on the other side , we eventually left the road walking, and started climbing, and sweating. About 8.5 miles into our hike, we came to the Appalachian Deli & Grill. It is right beside the trail, so we stopped to have lunch. We ate items from our food bags, but added a couple things from the store. We met a nice couple there that wanted to know about our hiking. The first thing they ask was, “aren’t you afraid of the things that are in there?” We took a picture with the couple and gave them trail names which they loved, Sandwich & Fuzzy Wazzy. Later as we hiked, we came to a historical farm site. The trail went directly through a massive old farm with large stone fences everywhere. There was a foundation remaining there from the barn where General George Washington gave the order for all the  Continental Army troops be Inoculated because of the small pox epidemic in the winter of 1776. It was cool to think that George Washington had been at this very spot at such a critical time in our nation’s history. The remainder of the day’s hiking was difficult ups and downs, with mostly rocky terrain. We made good time as Bald Eagle pushed through the hard trail. We made it to the Canopus Lake Beach Camping area that is free for Thru-hikers. We were allowed to take a free “cold” shower, which felt great once we were done. We set up our tents in a large grassy area, and that is when my fun started! I needed to find a place for my food bag to be safe from any bears, there was a large metal control panel in the field, not far from our tents. I thought if I could get the door open on this frig size cabinet, I might be able to put my bag inside for safe keeping. I did get the door opened, but decided to not use it, as there was too much equipment still remaining inside the cabinet. As I closed the doors, at least 2 hornets zeroed in on my legs, they made at least 6 direct hits, 3 on each leg. Wow do they hurt!!! I was swatting and backing up and rubbing and cursing all at the same time. I was extremely happy that I had just put on my rain coat, so they did not torpedo my upper body. The stings did not swell up as much as I envisioned them doing, and I am thankful for that. As nighttime falls, so is the rain. -beavER","Bear Mtn. Bridge Motel

I will jump to an event that happened late in the day. About an hour before we made the shelter, Bald Eagle and I met a young man with the trail name “Dough Boy”. He is wearing his grandfather’s WWII army uniform as he hikes to honor him. I had heard about him back in Virginia, but had never seen him. After we talked and got a picture, I could feel a new wave of excitement as I hiked, mainly because of he dedication to his commitment. What a way to make a strong statement of eternal love for your grandparent. 
I did not have any ill effects from the hornet stings to my legs last evening. Our hike out of the campsite went as planned. We leaped frogged with First Gear from Sarasota, Florida. I had never met him, but Bald Eagle had met him as he started his large section hike at Harper’s Ferry. One cool thing we saw this morning was a US flag painted on the top of a rock outcropping that memorialized 9/11, 2001. I had met a young lady hiker, name “Spirit”, this morning at the camp area. About an hour before lunch I saw her hiking south. I ask her if she forgot something as she went by me, and she had a puzzling look on her face. She was convinced she was going north. As I tried to explain, she ask me how did I get ahead to her to be going south? I told her that if she did not believe me, wait right there and Bald Eagle would be coming up soon and she could ask him. It took awhile, but she finally realized  she was headed the wrong way! She had stopped to do something with her phone, and after 5 minutes of trying to get something working, she lost all memory of what was the correct direction of the trail. I think she would have gone a long way if I had not stopped her. She thanked me later. There was a Deli & Pizza shop about a half mile off the trail, so all the hikers, including us, headed there for lunch. Bald Eagle and I split a pizza. I could only eat 2 of the 3 slices, so I carried one out to have with my dinner. The main goal of the day was to Telephone Pioneer Shelter. Bald Eagle’s friend, Dayton, was planning to meet us there. He was hiking in 10 miles, to spend the night, then hike to 10 miles out with us tomorrow. He is Bald Eagle’s ride back to civilization. As he makes the Connecticut line, Bald Eagle will be finished with his long section hike, starting at Harpers Ferry. His section hike has been about 430 miles. The trail terrain today was more dirt than rocks, and the overcast day was humid, but the temperature was in low 70s. The last 2 hours we hiked in a cloud cover that had rolled in with a light rain mist. Once we arrived at the shelter, I was able to meet Dayton and have good conversation with him. The tent site at the shelter were poor, so I had to be creative to get a small flat-ish spot. I squeezed my tent between 2 trees. We will see if it can keep the light rain away from the inside of my tent. I will reveal more about the cool plans for the next few days tomorrow.

How can a sliver of landscape, that was conceived to get individuals to relax, and become one with nature, bond so many together? I have been overwhelmed, so often, with the generosity of goodness from others. Today, I experienced it again.
Bald Eagle’s friend, Dayton, hiked in to the shelter yesterday to meet us there. The plan was to spend the night, then all hike out together today. Dayton is giving us a ride back to Bald Eagle’s home. The section hike that Bald Eagle is doing ends at the Connecticut Line. As we hiked out we came to the largest tree on the trail, the Dover Oak, with more than a 6 foot diameter and over 300 years old. We hiked through mud, weeds, slick rocks and wooden boards. We saw cool signs and had trail magic. We finished the hike by crossing into my ninth state. It was a fitting way to cross the finish line strong with Bald Eagle. We have been hiking together since June 30th. I will be sad to hike the next step on the trail solo, but I am thankful for the friendship we have forged through rocks, hills, rain, bugs, storms, sweat, blood, and some tears. But before we part ways, we will tour New York City together tomorrow. Bald Eagle is sharing his time to help me visit the 9/11 Memorial and other sites in the big city.

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641008,"As the alarm was echoing, my mind was racing. Today is a new adventure from the adventure I am living. Bald Eagle and I left his home at 6:20 am to head to Union Station to catch the Metro North passenger train to Grand Central Station, New York City. The weather was clear, and we had great views out the windows as the steel wheels floated along the rails. The sensation you feel as the movement gentle rocks you body back and forth was familiar to me. I was blessed over my work career to spend many hours traveling the countryside and cities of Japan. As we stopped at the platforms in each city, the sights and sounds of travelers boarding felt comforting. Out the large window to my right was landscapes and structures all new to me. Bridges and roads, schools and factories, people clutching coffees, phones, and bags. One advertisement sign read, “freedom to feel.” I was feeling a sense of freedom! My adventure to New York was actually happening. As we transitioned from countryside views and smaller towns, to concrete and buildings, my adrenaline began to flow. The day was only beginning. I had almost given up on taking a blue blaze (side trail) to the Big Apple. Now I was living it! Bald Eagle skillfully negotiated the trains and subways to take us to the rendezvous point with our tour group. I had reserved a spot to be guided through the 9/11 Memorial, the Museum, and go to the observation deck of the New Tower, One World Trade. Everything exceeded my expectations, as the guide was top notch, and had his own 9/11 recollections to add to the tour. He was a photojournalist, and was in the thick of the horrific day. I would not have wanted to spend the morning of reflection  with any one else, as Bald Eagle and I have previous bonds together that we did not know. As you see, he actually worked in the South Tower for years, and was working there when 6 people died from the the first bombing on February 26, 1993. His company moved out in the following years when their lease expired. Mainly tied to the uncertainty to safety if there ever was another attack. Bald Eagle saw many of his friends pictures in the memorial that had died from the second attack, September 11th. The whole country needs to take time to visit and reflect, and remember, as the 20 year anniversary is this fall. I am tied to the events in a smaller way, but still linked in. You see, I was the only one for my company that was in the air as the life altering events unfolded. Those events effected me forever. I was on a transcontinental flight to LA, fully loaded with fuel, just as the other planes that were high jacked. I won’t go into the details of my experiences here, except to for this one point: The one place I could not force myself to photograph was the enormous wall montage of sheet of colored paper, thousands of them… and they were all a different shade of blue. They creators of the memorials and museum were top on top of their game. For this wall, they wished to somehow capture what everyone that lived through that dark day testified to as they explain events from their memory. It always starts with how uncommonly beautiful the day was with the clearest sky with a stunning blue color. As I gazed out my window of the jet while being served breakfast, I was thinking the color and view was perfect. I could see farther into the Horizon than any other time. I can still see the color in the recesses of my mind. I tried as hard as I could to find the hue of blue from my mind in the thousands of panels. But every time I focused on one, I felt it was close, but the actual color was a hair more vivid. So there was no way I could snap the pic. Oh how I miss the blessings we as a country received during one of the most traumatic days since 1776. Unity, oh how we so desperately need someone to guide us to unity on this path we are traveling on side by side. We are all different, but we are linked together as we, one step at a time, climb this mountain of freedom. Our Forefathers blazed the trail, but if we don’t somehow link our harnesses together, we all will perish. My state of Kentucky’s motto reads, “United We Stand, Divide We Fall.” This came full circle at the end of the day, as Bald Eagle and I wanted to see the lights of Times Square. As we watched a local NY dance team perform, they needed volunteers from the audience, to jump over. I was pulled in, and did my best to be part of the entertainment. Break Dancers, and a Kentucky Country Boy… working as a team to bring joy to people watching from all over the world. None of us are perfect, but we made it together. One of the dance troupe summed up our challenge at the performance end, “we are all of the same race, the human race!” My reflection of the day events contains the 9/11 memories, the spectacular views from the 102 floor observation deck, FaceTime from the tower with my 2 oldest grandsons, my celebration of my 3 year old grandson’s birthday, in my own way since I could not see see him. Us walking on the Brooklyn Bridge, walking on the High Line, going to the New York Stock Exchange at Wall Street, Seeing St. Paul’s church, the survival Church, the Chelsea Market, where we ate a wonderful NY style lunch, walking to Union Square to see Chess players, went to Rockefeller Center, and saw Radio City Music Hall. The unforgettable Times Square dance team, touring 5th Ave, and the high end shops, walking to photo the Empire State Building for grandsons, then heading back to Grand Central Station, with the Chrysler Building in view. What an unforgettable day. I owe so much gratitude to Bald Eagle for taking me under his wing and sharing Trail Dust in the NY streets.

I hoped to heal my heel blisters with the 2 zeroes. I have made some progress over the last 2 days, but the 20 mile day walking New York City Streets and concrete did not help. But, I would not change anything. Today was all about relaxing, taking care of my feet, doing resupply, balancing checkbook, enjoying every second of a day off. Bald Eagle helped me do all the little things I hoped to work on, for example, I wanted to wash my backpack and shoes. It is amazing how bad they can smell after sweating for weeks at a stretch. We took a tour of this cool Connecticut town, and procured the hard to find items like Body Glide for blisters. Bald Eagle grilled us Hebrew National Hotdogs and turkey burgers. I ate like all I could, as we watched TV and I finished up packing to prepare for hitting the trail in the morning. All systems are “Go” for departure after breakfast. The next phase of heading north in my tenth state begins with the ride back to the trail. I have been blessed from the hospitality from Bald Eagle, and I am truly grateful.

We drove to the trail, which was about an hour and a half away. I was hiking before 9 o’clock. Weather was sunny and nice to begin the trail. My solo hike begins again. I hiked along side 10 mile river for awhile, then crossed over on the foot bridge at a beautiful area. About 12:30, I came to the New York/ Connecticut official border marking, so I guess I’m completely out of New York now. The trail was mostly rocks the first part of the day, with many ups and downs. Whenever you have time off, your legs seem to become tired easily. Today was no exception. The expected rain hit around 3:00, with the first wave being not too bad. The second wave was a different story. Lighting and thunder was all around as the rain came down in buckets. The beautiful Housatonic River I had been hiking beside for miles seemed to be the trail, as streams were flowing where I needed to place my already soaked shoes and socks. The extremely hard deluge finally let up after an hour. I made the climb down St. John’s Ledges without the rain, I was thankful for that, as it is extremely steep and technical. Once I made it to the shelter, I quickly set up my tent and made dinner. I had just finished brushing my teeth when round 3 of the storms hit. The rains pounded the tenth again, and lighting flashed through the darkness. There was so much rain that my tent’s “bath tub” bottom was floating. There was plenty of thunder to keep my attention. My daughter had sent a picture of my two oldest grandson looking out their living room window yesterday. It was raining, and they were watching the storm and saying Papaw might be hiking in the rain. They were worried about me. It was a touching pic. Today, I am thinking they had a good reason to worry, as round 4 is hitting me now at 9:00 pm. I still need a break in the rain to go put my food bag in the Bear Box. -beavER","Glastonbury, Connecticut

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641090,"The rain did break long enough for me to hang my food bag last night, around midnight. I was half asleep, and did not want to use my headlamp as I climbed back into the tent. If you do, the bugs will follow you in the tent because of the light. I zipped up the door, and went back to sleep. I did notice some water on the tent floor around 4:00 am. Not too much, but I was not sure where it was coming from. When the sun came up, I saw that I forgot to attach the vestibule flap, and it was hanging straight down. The rain was able to penetrate the sidewall screen because of my mistake. The hiking during the morning were difficult ups and downs, and the puddles and muddy bogs were everywhere. My legs felt the stress and it took a toll. The trail traveled beside the Housatonic River for about 3 miles. With all the rain, it was high and rolling. I came to a stream crossing, for Guinea Brook. The trail guide warned that under normal circumstances, you will get wet. But, if you have rain, it is dangerous. I went to check it before I took the bypass, I was on one side, and a south bounder (SOBO) was on the other side trying to decide where to make an attempt. I summed it up quickly, I did not want to die today. So I left to take the 1 mile long bypass. I passed the SOBO about 3/4 mile around. He had put 1 leg in the stream, and realized it was way too forceful. The only problem with doing the bypass is you don’t get credit for the miles. It was worth it to live to hike another day. I stopped at a shelter for lunch, and spread my tent out to let it dry. Shoes and socks also came off. When I got back to hiking, it only was about 20 minutes, then my shoes were back in the unavoidable muck. Oh well, they did fell better for a short time. Later, I came to a Beaver dam, the water was overflowing the dam. The second stream was about 2 foot above the foot rocks, and moving fast. There were a few logs and sticks that had jammed together, I decided to go for it. I used my balance to cross them, and I made it. I did get my left shoe into the water, as a log rolled on me. I was happy to make it across. One thing I have learned on the trail, people can bless you in many different ways. Today was a difficult hiking day, bugs were the worst so far, hiking was tough, hot with 99% humidity. Muck and flooded trails everywhere. But, when I made the place I planed to stop, the hydroelectric plant, I had an unexpected surprise waiting. A guy, with the trail name “Rev”, was doing trail magic. He is from Roanoke, Va., and currently doing a section hike in this area. He had a cooler with iced drinks and some snacks. He also had chairs to set in, and a bag for trash. I visited with him and exchanged good stories as my spirits were lifted. Thank you Rev for taking time to bless hikers today. It is just what I needed. -beavER","Stewart Hollow Brook Shelter

As I was sitting there enjoying my hot chocolate, Slowpoke comes walking up and was surprised to see me. Trail magic comes in many forms, sometimes it’s just a welcoming smile. Slowpoke and Slim are from Houston, Texas. Slowpoke let me know that she had to get off the trail. She’s supporting Slim by driving a car and meeting him and helping him slack pack. Slim has a upper ankle sprain, so he’s trying to recover, he’s doing lower miles. I always enjoy seeing both of them, they are super nice. Slowpoke wins my vote for the kindest person on the trail. The trail took me to Great Falls as soon as I started hiking. The water level was extremely high because of all the rain. I was able to get a good video of the “angry” water. I was super excited as I made it to the 1,500 mile mark today about 10 o’clock.. woo hoo!! I took a detour and went to Salisbury, CT. for lunch . I went to a market and resupplied for next few days. As soon as I got back to hiking, I came upon Trail Magic by Neon from New Hampshire. I met a hiker named Slim Shady at the market, and we leap frogged hiking the rest of the day. Slim Shady and I had to do a stream crossing and it was too high, so we had take our shoes and socks off to cross. The water was cold, but felt good on your feet once you got them out of the stream. Shortly after that, we came to the official welcome to Massachusetts sign, yeah! For those keeping score, this makes 10 states in rear view mirror, and I am in my 11th state now. There are 14 total states. The last climb I made it over was Race Mountain. It kicked my behind. The weather was pleasant today, with some sunshine in the afternoon. The problem today was mucky trails again with tons of water everywhere. Some my socks and shoes stayed wet all day again. That is a bad combination, hard miles + wet feet = trouble!

I put on dry socks, but with the soaking wet shoes from the day before, it didn’t take them long to become wet. The trail was muddy and has dried up a little, but still had a long ways to go to keep my feet dry. I was hiking before 7:30, and was excited about getting to Great Barrington, Ma. I wanted to try to dry all my gear out. Right out of the gate, I had a 800 foot climb  up mount Everett to the summit. It was a complete contrast to yesterday. Going up Race Mountain was technical and had wet bogs on the way to cause wet feet. Everett was straight up, so you knew what you had when you started. Within a short amount of time, I was submitting. There were no views on Everett, but yesterday, Race mountain had some of the best views I have seen since I was in North Carolina. I needed some water coming down off the mountain, and I was about to run out. I found a small runoff, so I got a leaf to make a funnel. I was able to get all the water I need. About a mile and a half from being finished for the day, I was doing a pasture walk through the fields and there’s were spots where the water is about 6 inches deep, with no way around. I had to put my whole foot in, so dripping wet again. With a half mile left, I came up on a great trail Magic being done by a Church group. The lead person took my order for a hamburger and cook it to order. Homemade brownies helped me forget all about my saturated feet.

As soon as I started hiking, there was a bypass of the first section because of all the flooding. It rained again last night at 11 o’clock. I was surprised when I got up this morning and saw that it was wet everywhere. After I finished the bypass, the path went straight uphill. I got it on the trail at 7:10, and by 7:40, I was covered in sweat and mosquitoes. But, I’ve was able to dodge most of water puddles, so I was happy about that. I met a nice couple from this area that were out day hiking. We shared a great conversation. They had many questions for me, and they were friendly. We talked for about 20 minutes. I Stopped for lunch at the ledges, a rock outcropping that had a view out to the south. I could see mountain ranges with partly sunny. conditions. Such a beautiful spot, nice cool breeze, very pleasant temperature today. This blessing helped raise my spirits. I Leapfrogged a hiker from outside of Philadelphia a couple times today. His trail name is Singing Hawk, and he is a section hiker doing a big section. From New Jersey, to Mt. Katadyn. I went by a beautiful beaver dam. I noticed multiple trees laying on the side of the lake that the beavers cut down that were 12 inches to 18 inches in diameter. They were just dropped down where they could use the branches of the trees for the dam building. It is amazing that a small creature can drop a large tree. When I reviewed the possible campsites for today, I was excited when I saw the Shaker Campsite. There is a historic Shaker Village outside of Lexington, Ky. Close to the city of Harrodsburg. Backwoods and I always enjoyed visiting the village, and learning about the history. If you have not read about the practices, I would recommend you take a few minutes to goggle them. The site in Kentucky has been completely restored. Years ago, we actually spent the night there, as they have hotel rooms above some of the shops. The buildings here are long gone, which is sad, but we are camping beside a stone foundation and walls of a barn. The settlement here was started in 1792, and the last Shakers moved out in 1876. In 1850, they had the largest population at 93 adults. Not sure how many children. I rolled into the camp about 4:00, and was the first one here.

The morning started out cool, I debated whether to start out wearing my jacket or not… on July 22! I was surprised, I even checked to see if I could see my breath as I was fixing breakfast. Captain crunch for breakfast, my favorite cereal from when I was a kid. Me and my brother Charlie could knock out a box at one sitting. I had brought what I had left from town in a zip lock bag. The sun was out for the start of a beautiful morning. The trail still has many muddy spots, so I had to take it slow try to keep my shoes dry. I was mostly successful, today I only had damp shoes, and never had them get saturated. When I got to Jerusalem Road, there was signage saying there’s a bridge outage. This spanned a large stream, and it’s not safe to cross, specially with the high water condition. So I had to do a road walk into a small community to bypass the bridge outage. It was about a mile of extra walking. But, i was happy to keep my shoes dry! I think I’m gonna call it today! Yes, great news! Today is the second day that I have not had blister pain in my heels. Hallelujah! Praise the Lord. I have been walking since Front Royal, Virginia, with some type of leg/ foot issue. For those who are keeping score: The first day of pain was when Backwoods Barbie starting hiking with me on June 9th. That is when I had cellulitis. My heels started hurting with the blisters in Pennsylvania about the same time the shin pain subsided from the second round of antibiotics. So from 6/9 until yesterday is 43 days. I had almost zero foot pain for the last 2 days… yeah. At 11:00, I checked to see where I was, and I was about 5 miles south from a parking area where Bald Eagle was going to pick up a hiker named McFly. He was giving him a ride to the airport so he can fly home. I texted Bald Eagle to let him know that I was not able to get to that spot in time to see them. I had joked with him the other day that the only thing I needed was some chocolate milk, when he asked what I needed. After I had left his house to start hiking, he had text me and said he was drinking the chocolate milk I left it in the fridge. I passed Upper Goose Pond Cabin without taking the extra mile hike to go see it. There was Trail Magic waiting for me at Route 20…chocolate milk and chocolate chip cookies. Since I could not meet up with him, before he left, he stashed the milk and cookies behind a tree in a ziplock bag. I was like a kid in a candy store when I located them. I carried the goodies to the top of the next mountain and had a great lunch. The sugar high helped me make it to the “Cookie Lady’s” place. The original Cookie Lady was historic with hikers. She would always have homemade cookies and lemon aid for hikers on her porch if she was home. Everyone who knew would stop at her house for a conversation and warm cookies. Sadly, she had to move away to her children’s home. But the good news is a family purchased the place and are trying to make it even better. They are Ruth Sangree, the Mom. Carl Sangree, the son. And Liz & Ellie Sangree, the daughters. I am tenting in the yard, and charging my electronics. I had lemon aid, and at least 4 cookies. I might have a couple more for breakfast.

We talked about ideas for her property and things that hikers would like. Some simple things she could implement quickly and low cost, like a clothesline, and a trash system to take hikers trash. We also talked about things she could do long-term, like building a bunkhouse and a shower house. I enjoyed my stay at the Cookie Lady farm, I was the only guest there last night. I loved the blueberry and raspberry bushes as they covered the hillside. The “short bus” that the young daughter converted to a bunk house was very nicely done. I hiked away very refreshed and energized. I ran into Mike, a.k.a. Werther‘s, named for the candy he likes to give that out to through hikers. He’s was doing trail magic at the first road that I crossed, in the parking area. He had iced Gatorade, soft drinks, coffee, and breads, and cookies, and apples. I was really feeling full of energy as the fat was young. By mid morning, I started thinking about the lack of thru-hikers I’m seeing on the trail. I didn’t see any thru-hikers all day yesterday, and I spent the night at the Cookie Lady’s place alone. I know there’s hikers ahead of me and behind me, but I’m in a solo bubble. And example of what I’m talking about: yesterday I stopped for a long lunch break, took my shoes off at a summit. I sat there and enjoyed the rest. Normally, there would be two or three people pass you when you take a long break. Nobody passed me by. As I hiked on this morning, I came up on three wild turkeys. The first ones I’ve seen this hike. Two hens and one little baby chick. About a quarter of a mile before I got to the city of Dalton, I slipped in the mud and went most the way down, didn’t fall all the way, but got mud all over me. One misstep and twist on a mud cover root, and it’s all over but the crashing and fussing. I arrived a Dalton around 1:00, so I took advantage of the community center, where I could take a free shower it was very nice to get cleaned up. I had to do some clothes washing also in the shower. It ended up being an extra 1.5 miles of walking, (which don’t show up in my totals) but the hot water did the trick. Then I went to a little sub sandwich shop and got me a late lunch. Once I got back on the trail, I knocked out the last miles quickly to the campsite. As I was turning on the side trail, there was another hiker also turning the same direction.  We both recognized each other. It was Biscuit, a nice younger hiker that I have not seen for 2 months. We caught up on what we have done over that time, for example he just got back on the trail after a side trip to Boston. I met another Thru-hiker at dinner who is from Louisville, Ky. He teaches music at the Kentucky School for the blind. There is one other lady who is section hiking here with us, total of 4 hikers.

I am starting to set myself up to meet with Duane M. He is my friend who met me with his RV back in Virginia. He enjoyed the trip and the day hiking so much that he wanted to do it again. Since we planned to meet and hang out for a few days again. I knew it would be a great place for my son to meet up with me also. I will hook up with Duane on the other side of Greylock Mountain, then we will pick up my son at the Albany Airport.
    Before I left camp, I said hi to Duckling. I first saw her at the Iron Master’s Mansion back in Pennsylvania. She had come into camp after dark with other hikers. The hike down off the mountain went quickly as I was excited to make it to Cheshire. The distance was slightly over 4 miles to the  Post Office where had a resupply. I wanted to get there before the lock the doors since it was Saturday, and they have much shorter hours.
    Once arrived in town, I walked straight to the US Post Office. They had my resupply box, but I did not take it. Today was to be a day of changed plans. After Backwoods had planted the thought of getting my resupply after I met Duane, I realized it was the best choice. I did not need any of the 15 pounds of supplies yet. I could hike over the biggest climb we have seen since Virginia, without the heavy load. I told them I would be back on Monday. But now, I knew it was there. It is always a worry that your package gets lost.
    I found Father Tom’s Campsite, a town sponsored campsite just for Thur-hikers. It was created in memory of a local priest that helped hikers. I set up my tent in the awesome site. They have a first class electronic device charging area, port-a-potty, Bear box, water facet, picnic tables, chairs. and benches. They also had 3 loaner bikes you could take to ride around town. The caretaker brought a box of donuts, and after I ate 2, I was thinking my plan of doing a nero was a great decision. There was a restaurant close to eat 3 meals, and an ice cream shop even closer. 
    Once the last couple of backpackers hiked away to conquer Mt. Greylock, I found myself talking to a very intelligent hiker. We were there by ourself’s enjoying the beautiful morning. I soon found that my interesting conversation were with “Zen”, he is the owner of Gooder Groove hiker hostel & retreat in Franklin, NC. He is taking a vacation from managing his hostel to recharge his batteries. He were able to talk about hiking, life, and spiritual experiences. He has many talents and interests.I enjoyed talking with him.
    Zen gave me advice that I should think about hiking over My. Greylock as soon as I could instead of waiting. There was rain in the forecast for tonight and tomorrow. The mountain is difficult on a good day with the 2,580 foot climb. Once you have rain, the terrain is very muddy and slick, especially on the down slope. At 2:00, I changed my plans, no more hanging out in easy street… I was putting in on high gear and heading up and over Greylock. I usually like to have well thought out and considered plans. This was a gut decision. I was not sure were I would stay, but I had to trust the advice from someone who had been there before.
    So, off I hiked, thinking to myself, this is kind of crazy starting this hard of a hike at 2:00. I was rolling, I did not take a break all the way to the top. 8.2 miles, 2580 elevation gain, yes, my trail legs are back. When I got to the summit, I see Zen’s van, and I yelled “Hey Zen!” He was slack packing 4 young hikers. He had driven their backpacks to the top, so they could hike without the weight. He could not believe that I had made it so quickly, that made 2 of us. Thank you Lord. I trIed to make hotel reservations for a room at the 2 cities at the base of Greylock, 6.5 miles down, I had no luck. I also wasted about 30 minutes being on hold during the process.
    I busted it heading down the other side of the highest peak in Massachusetts. I decided to make it to Wilbur Clearing Shelter. It is about a third of the way down the steep slope. I knew I could make it before dark. I had time to make the shelter and was surprised to find space inside the 3 sided wooden structure. They are always full of bad weather is coming, and with it being Saturday night, there were many section hikers out. They all seemed to be in tents.

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641449,"Last night, when I arrived at the shelter. I had two things on my mind. One, stay dry to be ready to hike in the morning. Two, when I did start hiking the next morning, be safe going down the steep decent in the rain slick and muddy conditions. Those concerns were suppressed once I knew I had room to share the shelter with the ladies. Once I had my air mattress and quilt set up, I started to breath a sigh of relief.
    A difficult point to explain to a non thru-hiker is how little time you have to actually relax during your day. At the end of your day, as your dinner is cooking, you finally start to breath easier. About that time last night, 4 more SOBO (south bound) hikers showed up at the shelter, they hoped that someway, we could let they squeeze in with us. For the score keepers out there, that would be 8 people in a shelter built for 6. I did not comment my thoughts, but gladly listened as Queen Bee, Paparazzi Penny, and Little Legs welcomed them in. I could not help it as I was thinking, this is my adventure off the hook! The 4 hikers were young ladies, so here is the totals for the math people: 7 ladies, 2 female pups, and me…. Funny.
    The promised rains and high winds hit as scheduled, and lasted throughout the night. The 4 SOBOs were ready to get rolling super early, as they hoped to do 25 miles. They started packing at 5:00 am. As soon as they pushed off, the rest of us started packing. I had a special reason why I wished to be hiking in the rain this morning. I wanted to get to town to go to a Sunday Morning worship service.
    One of the reasons I wanted to not hike over Mt. Greylock was I had a Church lined up to attend in Cheshire. I had been texting the Paster, and knew the start times, and it was close. When I changed my plans yesterday, I was stepping out in faith that I could find a House of God to walk to in the rain. And I could Make it in time, including changing from soaking wet and muddy clothes, to my “Sunday go to Meeting” outfit. (Southern phrase for your best attire).
    I saw 2 churches that caught my interest in google maps, so I set my sails toward the closest one in North Adams. After the careful footsteps down the rain soaked mountain, I found myself on the streets of the city. The trail follows along the rain puddle filled sidewalks for over a mile, before heading north into the woods. I needed to make a right turn toward the heart of town to find the closest church. I began to chuckle to myself about all the puddles I had to dodge to stay out of deep water. Many times I was walking in the wet grass to avoid the mini “cannon ball splash” my feet would create if they landed in those puddles. The pouring rain became more intense as I made the turn. I struggled with getting my phone to work again with wet fingers and all the rain.
    After about 1.5 miles of walking from the trail, I saw a church bus drive by me, it had “Mt. Greylock Baptist Church” painted on the side. I immediately thought, wave them down, yell, or do something to get the attention of the driver… but in a flash, it was too far ahead. Then I started to relax as I pounded the flooded streets. That was the church I was walking toward. I knew if the bus is running, they are having services. I had worried about the church being a good pick because I could not confirm anything about it the night before because of the lack of cell service.
    As I walked up to the parking lot, I was praying to catch a member that could direct me to a place I could change. Charlie came up to me and shook my wet hand, he escorted me to a large bathroom, perfect to swap clothes and clean the mud of my shoes. The soles were already cleaned by the puddles. The members were extremely friendly and interested in my hiking. The paster, Ethan Malachuk, came up and helped me find a decaf tea to warm up.
    After a wonderful message about King David, and God’s covenant with him for an Eternal Kingdom,  the members wanted to help me in some way. I convinced them that I would be ok, I did not need anyone to take me to lunch. But I would be happy to except a ride back to my hotel I had reserved for tonight. They ask Charlie, and he gladly loaded me in with his family.  About a 5 minute ride, saved me 2 hours of walking. I thanked them as they headed off to celebrate their 23rd anniversary. Charlie said, “I guess I better take her out to eat or something!” As he was driving away.
    I spent the afternoon, talking with Duane as he is driving most of the 13 hour trip today. His plan is to get about 3 hours away, then stop for the night. I talked with my son, JD, as he will be flying up  tomorrow, and Diane and I will pick him up at the Albany airport. I talked with my daughter, as she has plenty on her plate. I also got to FaceTime my oldest 2 grandsons at the pool, and talk to my beautiful wife, Backwoods about several different things. The Chinese restaurant down the street is not half bad either. What a great day… can you tell I am getting excited about tomorrow? -beavER","Wilbur Clearing Shelter

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641494,"Zero day today. I slept in this morning, thinking I would have plenty of time to get ready to meet my buddy Duane. I checked my phone to see the time. I noticed that I had a text from Duane. It said, “Hey Ron
Just letting you know I’m here!” He had driven all the way to the hotel. I quickly packed my stuff and checked out.
    I was happy to see that he made it safely. We headed to a tire dealer to have his front wheel checked for leaks. The pressure sensor was not tight, and had allowed the air pressure to drop from 100 lbs. to 87 lbs. Once that issue was corrected, we headed off to the Cheshire Post Office to retrieve my resupply package.
    From there, we stopped for lunch, and burnt time so we would not be early to the campground. Duane had ask them numerous times if he could check in early. They insisted that 2:00 was the soonest we could check in. We got there a few minutes after 2, and unhooked his Jeep, set up the RV. Set up includes leveling, hooking up electric, water, and extending the slide outs (makes interior size wider)and awning.
    Once the camper was set, we were off in the Jeep to Albany, NY. My son’s plane arrived on time, and I gave JD a hug in front of the terminal as we picked him up. It was great to see him. We soon we’re back at the campgrounds to enjoy dinner and a campfire that JD built.
    I sent pictures of Duane, me, and the hamburgers Duane cooked, to The Colonel, Double Take, and Clean Plate. It brought back wonderful memories of when we were all together back in Virginia. I am so blessed to have family and friends with me. -beavER","Williamstown, MA.

    We headed up to the Mount Greylock Summit to visit the war Memorial Tower. It is over 90 foot tall and resembles a light house construction. It is really cool inside,  as it has a spiral staircase to get up to the top to the observation floor. There are 90 steps in the staircase. We had beautiful views and decided to hike to a pond that has a small cabin. JD was able to capture some great pictures with his camera.
    We wanted to about 5 miles of hiking on the AT, so we headed up a gravel road for miles to a trail head parking area. The spot was 10 miles north from the location I stopped on Sunday. I picked that location because I wanted to know about potential campsites if Duane hikes with me 2 days from now. The hike up was good, but we had to dodge many mud holes. We made it to a view point and stopped to take a break.
    That’s when we noticed Storm clouds moving toward us. Not good, we had no rain gear since the forecast was for nice weather. We started heading back as sprinkles started to fall. Within minutes, the small drops transformed into a all out downpour. We were being pelted as the trail was masked as a stream. One slight misstep by Duane, and he landed in a soft spot on the side of the trail. We were thankful he bounced back to his feet. The Jeep was a welcomed sight, and I told Duane that it would not hurt my feelings if he turned the heat on high.
    All 3 of us had wrung our shirts out before we climbed in the cab. I was happy to be out of the chilly rain. Duane put the Jeep in 4 wheel drive, and we headed back to civilization. It seemed as if we were in a hurricane as we travelled. When we arrived back at campgrounds, we found the lot flooded. Duane grilled steaks for dinner, so we quickly forgot about our water adventure.

It was not part of my original plan, but I think it has been a blessing to help me heal up and recover. JD picked a place for us to visit today, so after breakfast and laundry, we loaded into the Jeep and headed off.
    We went to Natural Bridge State Park, outside N. Adams, MA. The park's chief feature, for which it is named, is the only natural white marble arch/bridge in North America. We also viewed the remains of an abandoned marble quarry. It made for a relaxing and educational morning. We headed back to the campgrounds for lunch.
    The afternoon quickly flew by, and at 4:00, it was time to load up and take my son to the Albany airport. As rapidly as this wonderful pause in my hike appeared, now I had to come to terms with the end. As we pulled up to the American reception area, I jumped out and asked an innocent bystander to snap a picture for me of the 3 of us. I gave my son a hug to wish him a safe journey, with dry eyes. But, I had to give him a second one a few seconds later. I got some of that darn trail dust in my eyes again, having to walk away as he watched. I am sure he was expecting the dust as he knows I am prone to let that happen.
    I did not dwell to much on the sadness that comes once a love one heads back home. I think I will reserve that mind set until tomorrow. Once I was back at the RV, I began preparing to hike out in the morning. Rain is in the forecast for all day tomorrow. Duane will shuttle me to N.

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641604,"The Jeep was my shuttle this morning back to North Adams to start hiking. Duane and I headed out after our early breakfast. It felt weird hiking, but I settled in to a fast pace as I started the climb. I knew that rain was coming this afternoon, and I wanted to knock out as many of the miles as I could before the trail was soaked and slick. The uphill went by fast, as I was deep in thought most of the way. The scenery was better than I expected with a beautiful stream flowing beside to the trail for the first 2 miles.
    Four miles into the hike, I crossed a high milestone… Welcome to Vermont! The border is the southern terminus of the Long Trail. The Long Trail and the AT share the next hundred miles until Maine Junction, where the Long Trail turns north toward Canada. While the AT is much more popular and widely known, the Long Trail is actually older and was the original inspiration for the Appalachian Trail. So from the border, I am walking on both for the next hundred miles. I have completed 11 states, and have began my 12th.
    Less than a half mile later, another milestone… 1,600 mile mark! Woohoo! Less than 600 miles to Katadyn. 600 seems like a big number, but it will become smaller one step at a time.
    The trail was “Ver-muck”, that is what hikers call Vermont, because of all the slushy mud you must walk through. I tried to keep my shoes as dry as I could. The highlight for me today was a couple of beaver ponds. The first one was really nice, and I was able to get a good video showing the beaver’s lodge.
    The expect rain started at 2:00 and was  light. I was happy the heavy rain didn’t hit until I was finished. The last mile of the hike today was straight down on large boulder steps. The rain made them extremely slick, and I was cautious with each foot placement.
    The Jeep was waiting at the parking area, and Duane had a Gatorade and Payday waiting for me. He was wondering if I needed the heat on? I surprised him by saying no. I was sweating from all the work from the downhill. We headed beach to the campgrounds and the RV. I am being spoiled.

I knew the deluge would not help the standing water and muck on the trail. As we were heading to my drop off point, I was surprised when rain started falling. The forecast for today was for partly sunny skies and a small chance of rain at 1:00. Oh well, I put on my rain coat and ball cap. Duane said I could wait out the rain in the Jeep, but I headed out the door. 
    I had many miles to do to get to a pick up point, so off I trudged. I climbed for the first 10 miles all the way up to the refurbished fire tower. It was windy at the top, and I could see the next round on rain coming. It hit about noon. Back on with the rain jacket. With all the rain, the hike was difficult. I have never seen so much mud and muck.
    I realized that the goal I set for today was too much. This hike ranked # 3 on the difficult hike list for this year. # 1- Hiking over Roan Mountain and getting Hyperthermia. # 2- The Colonel and me hiking up Spy Rock Mountain in the Frigate cold rain storm.
    I was surprised and happy to hear my name from a hiker that was going south. He was covered with a large poncho as the rain was pounding us. As I looked closer, I made out the face of Slim. He was slack packing back to were I had started. He said his sprained ankle has healed and he is doing well. I told him to tell Slow Poke I said hello. The highlight of the day, beside seeing Slim, was the nice beaver dams and lodges I saw close up.
    I stepped in the mud so many times today I lost count. Many times as I did, the mud would make a vacuum on my shoe. As I pulled up, I was glad that I had my shoe strings double knotted. I could feel my heel lifting out of its cradle, then the mud would make the suction sound you hear when you try to unstop a drain with a plunger.
    As I closed in on the finish line, I came to a large brook. I stepped down in the swiftly moving current to wash my shoes, gators, and legs. I was relieved to see Duane with the Jeep for the last time. It has been such a blessing from him, I can never thank him enough. -beavER","Rte 9 Woodford Hollow- Bennington, VT.

It is beautiful, and a couple of the hikers jumped in to swim.

When I arrived at camp, my socks were still dry, yeah! Later in the day, as the partial sunshine dried the muck some, I actually was enjoying some of the hiking. The trail had more nice streams and waterfalls today. There were a few stretches that almost seemed normal. They usually only lasted about 1-2 minutes. But, I will take any break I can get.

    The first big milestone for the day was passing the 500 mile mark to Mt. Katahdin. So, I’m now less than 500 miles to go. The 500 mile has always been a big hurdle in my thoughts. I always wondered how I would feel once I had less than 500 to finish. I am still pondering the reality.

Tejas and I both tried to warn him, but as he leaned ever so close to death, he was oblivious to the danger. I was glad to get my camera back with only worm blood.
    Passing Dartmouth College, I couldn’t help but think about the opportunities available. I am having an adventure of a lifetime.  For the freshmen that are coming to campus, they are in the middle of an adventure. Many were walking by as we we travel our own path. The last thing you pass before you walk back into the woods is the Dartmouth baseball stadium.
    I saw McFly, sitting in the center of the outfield, behind the home run fence on a camera pedestal.He was just enjoying the day, he’s in the middle of an adventure also. I passed two thru-hikers,they were at the hostel last night and this morning, Pretzel and Grizz. Grizz made biscuits and gravy this morning, and Pretzel was really impressed with him. He was really good at playing the guitar last night and leading singing for the gang.
    I knocked out the shorter hike today and felt good. I went back to resupply, wash cloths, shower, and prepare to be back on the trail after Church in the morning. -beavER","H.A.T. Hostel

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642066,"We started the morning by checking out of the H.A.T. Hostel, after eating 2 waffles with real maple syrup for breakfast. We took Zey and Upchuck to the trail for them to start hiking this morning. Tejas and I went to the Co-Op, a small grocery store. We had coffee and hot chocolate (me) as we sat outside while enjoying the morning.
    The Co-Op store is located adjacent to the Dartmouth Baseball stadium. There was a flurry of activities from hikers at this location. Many getting dropped off by the hostels, as they will start their daily journey from the parking area. Some going North, but more headed South. I could not help but wonder how many of the SOBOs would be still hiking after they traverse through the Pennsylvania rocks? That is where we lost many NOBOs.
    Tejas had graciously devoted his time this morning to help me make it to Church. I had called the Olivet Baptist Church, in West Lebanon, NH. Pastor Joe, had returned my call to let me know about service times, and to let me know he that he was looking forward to seeing me.
    We got to visit with Reset at the Co-Op. I had met him at the Hostel the night before. We had shared a load of laundry, and started becoming friends. We had great conversation this morning. He is retired Army.
    We also got to see Wheels and Eagle at the Co-Op. We had gave them a ride this morning. They were hitch hiking back to the trail. Tejas let them ride in the back of the truck because there was no room in the cab. We had let them out at the bridge over the Connecticut River.
    I got to meet Pastor Joe and his wife before the service, at the Church. They were very nice. They have a new building for worship.
    As we were talking about my opportunities to visit different churches along the trail, it sparked a funny memory for Pastor Joe. He told me of a contractor from Georgia that was remodeling their old church a few years back. His job took 6 months to complete, and he stayed in NewHampshire the duration. Every Sunday, he would get a Church Bulletin, and ask Pastor Joe to sign it. He would then mail it back to his home preacher to prove that he was attending a Church.
    I went past jet pack early in the hike. She had stopped to take a lunch break on the side of the trail. She’s the hiker with a swollen foot. She is a nurse, but I was surprised to see her hiking with her foot condition.
    On top of a mountain, a south bound hiker, told about trail magic down at the road, about 2 miles. That got me excited. I went fast to get down the mountain. As I came around the corner at the parking area, I saw Zey sitting in a chair, enjoying the magic. Then I heard someone saying, “hey, it’s beavER!” It was Dady Long Legs & Honey Bun. I was so happy to see them. They are one of my favorite couples that are still hiking. I gave them both hugs. Dady Long legs is about one foot taller than me. We had a great visit before we had to start up the last hill of the day. The last time I saw them was when Backwoods was hiking with me back in Virginia.
    Zey and I finished up together. Tejas picked us up at the trail head, and we went to the town of Lyme, NH. There, we stopped at a small ice cream shop. Both Zey and I bought a root beer float made with maple and walnut ice cream. We camped at a place that Tejas found that had everything we needed. It was another great day spent with awesome friends.
    Tomorrow will be the day I separate and become a Lone Wolf hiker again. I will fill you in tomorrow on the circumstances. I have been blessed beyond my wildest dreams by Tejas & Zey. I will miss them immensely -beavER","Three Mile Road- Hanover, NH.

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642120,"We all packed up early this morning. Then we had breakfast, and headed to the trail. My number one goal was to not get trail dust in my eye, as we parted ways this morning. Tejas and Zey have to adjust their hiking goals, something wonderful is about to happen for them. Zey’s sister will be joining them for a couple days of hiking. So, their focus is on being in position to make her hike align with Zey’s. That means I need to give them space so they can accomplish there plan. As of this morning, I will be solo, at least for a couple of weeks. We will keep in touch and see if we can merge after the Whites. I have loved the time I was able to hike with them, they are great people.
    The morning started out beautiful as I was hiking up toward Lambert Ridge. A nice breeze with great views. I ran into Zey, as I took a break and was talking to Backwoods Barbie. I was on the phone with her and my two oldest grandsons, as they were on the way to the zoo. They also want to  tell me they had a surprise! They had just got a new dog, named Boone. I wondered if it had anything to do with the fact that I love studying the history of Daniel Boone?
    The fire tower for Smarts Mountain was great. It was in good shape, and you could get in the upper platform area through a trap door. I got to talk to “Green”, at the fire tower. She started hiking in Georgia about the same time as me. I have not seen her the whole hike, until last week. Now I have seen her about 6 times. It is funny how things work out that way on the trail.
    On the way down smart Mountain, there was a dead tree just barely hanging. I was worried it could fall at any second on a hiker. I forced the dead tree to fall. As it was breaking loose, I had to jump out of its way to keep it from crashing on me.
    As I was getting closer to the summit of Mount Cube, I shed my first blood of the hike. The rains that were forecast for the day had missed us, but had hit the top of Mount Cube. So, as I was going up, the marble rock had moisture from the rain on it. My feet just went straight out from under me, as I came crashed my right elbow. I though at first that it was injured, but quickly realized it was good. But, as I looked down to check my left hand, somehow I cut a pretty good chunk out of my ring finger’s tip. The bright red blood streamed down my finger until I could stop and do medical repair. Since I hadn’t had any trouble so far, all my medical supplies were in the very bottom of my backpack.
    As I continue to hike I saw more evidence of the rain, as the ground was muddy and all the rocks were super slick. I took it easy the rest of the day as I was gun shy. 
    I did see Tejas as he was pulling up to the parking area where he planned to pull out Zey just as I was hiking past it. We talked for a few minutes as he gave me a water and an apple. I still needed to hike 2 more miles from the parking area to make it to the campsite. It was really full tonight with NOBOs & SOBOs. I had a full day. Tomorrow will be the beginning of the Whites!

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642175,"The excitement of the day was heavy in the air this morning. I knew it would take about seven miles of hiking to get to Glencliff, NH. There, I have resupply food and cold gear waiting to be picked up. From there starts the first climb of the White Mountains. It’s about 4000 feet up to get to the top, so I was very anxious, and looking forward to the challenge.
    Backwoods started worrying about my resupply, she called the Hikers Welcome Hostel to see if my box had arrived. Once she found out the status, she called to let me know it was there. As I was hiking my way in the morning, I saw some Thru-hikers I knew like McFly. Not long after, a South Bounder passed word to us that there was trail magic at the road intersection that the Hostel is on.
    It was awesome Trail Magic at the road. They had about everything you would want, and were taking orders to grill hamburgers and hotdogs. I told them I would be back for the burger. First, I wanted to hit the hostel, about a 10 minute walk up the road. The Hikers Welcome Hostel had my resupply with the cold weather gear. I took a shower, washed clothes, charged devices, and tried to get everything in my backpack.
    I hit the Trail Magic on the way back, but I did not sit long, as I knew the task of getting up and down Moosilauke was a
tall order. All I can say is that it is the real deal. I knew that I had done something when I made the summit. Being above the tree line was great. The views were everything I thought they would be. The 360 degree sights were spectacular.
    When I arrive at the top of Moosilauke, Green and McFly were on the summit. Green took my picture at the sign because it also states that we made the 1,800 mile mark at that spot… yeah baby!!! We celebrated for a short while, then back to the task at hand. We still had to get off the mountain.
    It was the most dangerous hike I have done. The 4,000 foot decent is not for the faint of heart. Wet rocks and boulders make it much worse. I was thankful to get to level ground in one piece. There is a beautiful cascading waterfall about the last 2 miles right beside the trail. I took about 25 pictures. Most of the young hikers had pulled up at the bottom of the hill at stealth spots. I found one also a little ways farther back past their tents. It is a good spot for me to rest up from the crazy, but awesome day… welcome to the Whites! -beavER","Ore Hill Campsite

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642218,"The overnight rain continued into the morning. It was evident that I would need to pack up camp in the rain. I was not excited about the challenge, so I took my time. It did lighten up to a steady drizzle by 9:00 as I hit the trail. The slow start guaranteed I could not do big Mile’s today.
    One of the big challenges out here on the trail is something you don’t normally think about. It is staying up with your banking, balancing checkbooks, keeping bills paid. This morning I had a voice message about a payment that was missing (late), that becomes an adventure. Just trying to get on the Internet to track stuff down, and trying to get enough signal to make calls on the summits. Backwoods also did a great job helping me out. We got it all fixed.
    The first part of the morning was spent climbing up Mount Wolf, it is a hard climb. At the shelter, I stopped for lunch. There, I met Big Bird. He’s from Lexington, Kentucky, so we talked for a while, and I shared beef jerky with him. He’s wanting to get a group of Kentucky hikers together after the hike just to celebrate. I am all for that. That makes two guys I have met from Lexington in 2 days. I met Manners yesterday at the Trail Magic. They are really good friends, and decided to hike the trail together. They are a few miles apart as of today.
    After lunch, it was straight up South Kinsman Mountain, about 2,000 foot up. The closer you get to the top, the more challenging it gets. Hugh boulders, or rock steps, with mostly hand over hand climbing. Once you make it, then it’s on to North Kinsman Mountain. There is a 400 foot down and up between the two peaks. This area that drops down is called a saddle.
    From the North Peak, I only need to hike around a mile downhill to the shelter and camp area. In the Whites, you have to pay to stay at the campsites. I put my tent up on a wooded platform. It worked out really nice. A young lady just gave me four special tent hold downs. They are made for the platforms. They are designed like small anchors, and go between the boards. You can then hook your support ropes to them. She was at the Hikers Welcome Hostel yesterday, and said she was finished with the Whites and did not need them anymore.
    All the younger hikers I have been around the last couple of days are staying here also, in the shelter. I really was pushed to the limit again today, so the shorter day was a blessing.

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642293,"An unexpected Rain storm hit last night at midnight. The new tent stake hold downs worked perfect. It’s amazing how the Lord took care of me, even when I didn’t know I needed them. The young bunch in the shelter didn’t know that it rained, until they looked around and saw the puddles.
    Day started with bright sunshine, and it lasted all day with hot temperatures. I almost got too hot as the day went on. But, even the young guys were effected by the heat and humidity. But the sunshine made for awesome views.
    The first big climb was up to Franconia Ridge. Then from there, Little Haystack Mountain was next. Once we were above the tree line, the trail went to Mount Lincoln, and then the best spot of the day was Mt. Lafayette. The views were gorgeous. When I started down from there, that is when I knew the exposure to the heat and sun was too much. The problem was there is no where to hide. It was going to be about 2 more hours befor I would be in the shade from tree cover.
    The trail becomes a steep downhill, for about 2,000 feet. The problem was a straight up climb was next for the last mountain of the day. After the near 1,000 foot to get to the top, even the young guys were beat up by the heat. Everyone was happy to get to the top of Mt. Garfield. I am squarely in the middle of the Presidential Mountain Ranges now.
    The campsite was about a half mile down from the summit. I was really pleased to get there and refill on cool water. What an amazing day of sights, climbs, struggles, and adventure. The Whites are living up to everything I have heard about them. The main thing I kept thinking as I faced the challenges was, I am really glad to have all the Mile’s under my feet, to guide my steps now.

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642349,"I had already made up my mind yesterday as to what today would hold. I knew that if I pushed hard for both days, I could make it to the campground where my resupply was mailed. The worst problem I could face, if I did not make it, would be no power to recharge my phone. My backup battery was almost dead.
    I checked the maps, I needed to do over 17 miles today. I had to get a early start, so my alarm went off at 4:30. There was a group of 4 section hikers that were getting up at the same time, so I did not have to worry about being noisy. I was hiking by 5:45 am. The humidity was very high, and I had many spider webs to walk through.
    I stopped at the Galehead Hut at 7:30. The Huts in the White Mountains are full service lodges. They are about $160 per person, but you must reserve way in advance. For Thru-hikers, you can stop by after breakfast or dinner is over, and the staff will feed you leftovers. I was about 30 mins too early, so I rolled on.
    I was surprised how warm it was early, and I needed to make my only large climb after the Hut. It was 1,400 feet up the South Twin Mountain. I had zero power in my reserve tank, it was work to reach the summit. But the views were great, and I was surprised to be up there by myself for about 10 minutes.
    The humidity dropped as the temperature rose. I think it pushed 90 degrees. It also was another day of long stretches without streams or springs. I would drink at least 1 liter of h2o when I finally got to a good water hole.
    I came to a beautiful area where Zealand Falls Hut is located. The waterfall is really cool, and I decided to go in to check with the staff about using the toilet. The nice young lady served me leftovers, and also gave me a fresh baked pastry. The oatmeal and sausage gave me the calories I needed. Plus the bathroom was good.
    As the heat was mounting, and my energy dipping, my thoughts turned to “I don’t know if all this stress if worth it…” I am supposed to be having fun! For a brief instant, I thought there was no point in continuing! But, as my feet kept moving, I noticed the trail became smooth. I had a stretch of perfect terrain for about 3 miles of pure bliss. It was just the right thing at the right time. God will provide.
    I was also preoccupied as I hiked with another worry. I had started trying to find out the condition of my resupply yesterday. I had to ask Backwoods to help me. It is really difficult to make calls and be on hold as you hike the mountains.With little to no service, it can be impossible. After trying all day yesterday, and most the early morning today, I still had no idea where my resupply box was located. The problem was lurking at my stop point. A parking area, after 17+ miles hiking in the Whites. I needed to go 2 different directions. The Willey House, the location where my resupply was supposed to be, I hoped! It is West 1 mile. My Campground I was staying at, was East 3 miles. I am walking and running out of time in sweltering heat!
    My anxiety was stressful. How could I make it before it’s too late? Both the Willey House, and the Camp store close at 5:00. I could maybe push it and make the 1 mile walk, but I still didn’t know if my box was there. To make matters worse, I had absolutely zero cell service after 10:00 this morning.
    Faith, I needed it, but how do I grasp it?  I just realized I had to let go, I am “not” in control! I got to point where I understood it was going to be ok, no matter the outcome. When I arrived at the trail head parking, the end of my AT for the day, there was a lady doing trail magic. I though, hey maybe this is my answer to prayer. I could offer to pay for a shuttle. She could not take me in her car, but she did give me some advice about hitch hiking. She also shared wise advice about taking to people honestly about my predicament. She said, “don’t be afraid!”
    I was a little bummed out that she could not take me as I headed West to find out if my resupply was there. The sun was blazing down as I headed up the highway. I stuck my thumb out to try hitch hiking for the first time in my life. As the cars zoomed by, I admit, I felt dejected. I knew I needed to keep walking, because there was the chance I could get there in 25 minutes. It was 4:10.
    I decided to give up on walking backwards as cars raced by. Then, I just put my thumb out without lookin back. When I sensed no one was going to stop, I switched to the left side of the road. There were small patches of shade from afternoon shadows. The next car that went by stopped. I had a hard time realizing what happened, should I run or just casually stroll. Oh yea of little faith.      It was a young lady that had hiked the AT in 2018, trail name Kamikaze. She took me to The Willey House, and my package was there! I started to breath slightly easier. Before, as we were driving, she revealed she was late. She had to be at a place to pick up her wedding dress.
    As I was telling her goodbye, she surprised me. Kamikaze was kind enough to take me back the other direction the 3 miles to the Campground and Camp store. As for her appointment, she said, “ah, they will wait!” What an angel.
    When I walked into the Camp store to check in, they looked at me as if I had a third eye… “we are totally booked!” I found out that I was at the wrong location. The campground I needed was 1 mile back up the road. So again, I used the trail magic lady’s advice of talking to people honestly about my problem. The first guy I talked to said he would be glad to give me a ride, as long as I did not mind his messy car! Looks like the advice I received was a God Send also! The right people, in the right place, at the right time.
    The caretaker at the campgrounds treated me like a long lost friend. I was able to pick up my supply, get to the camp store to buy Gatorade and ice cream, make it to my camp, all with time to spare. I did laundry, showered, and charged my devices. Everything I wanted to do!
    But, just to put the icing on the cake for the “yea of little faith”… I walked into the laundry area to find no dispenser for soap purchase. I did not know what to do, I decided to tell the lady who was starting her washer load about my problem. She told me not to worry, as she was planning to leave a quart container of detergent on the shelf. She only needed enough to do 1 load, and was not wanting to carry it home.
    I ended my night by taking my contacts out and putting on my glasses. I just procured a full bottle of lens conditioner in my resupply, so I put my 2/3 full bottle in the trash. About 1 minute later, a young man started removing his contacts. Just then, he ran out of solution. I told him about the container in the trash. After retrieving the bottle, he looked at me and said, “you are a God Send! I really needed this!”
What a day of provision!

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642374,"I slept good last night, and woke up ready to get everything packed up. Then an unexpected rain shower came up, so I had to cook in my tent. After about a half hour, the bright sunlight came out. I didn’t see Colin the caretaker at a camp office, so I started a 2 mile walk back to the trail. Colin had told me he would help me back to the trail, but with no cell service, I could not contact him.
    I was hoping maybe I’ll get picked up since I was sticking my thumb out as I walked… it worked yesterday. A car pulled over after about five minutes of walking and two ladies, a mother and daughter, gave me a ride up to the trail head it was awesome.
    After I climbed about 1,500 feet, I finally had service. It had been about 24 hours of flying blind. I called Backwoods to let her know I was still alive, then I ask her to help me again. I wanted to see if she could get me a reservation at the Lakes of the Clouds Hut. It is only 1.5 miles from the summit of Mt. Washington. She had to be on hold for 25 minutes, but got it done. I was so excited, I could feel my pace increase as I climbed. I need the boost, as I would ascend about 3,800 feet today. 
    At the overlook where I called Backwoods, I met Thru-hiker Big Tuna and Danny, his wife who is section hiking with him. They’re staying at the same Hut also. They’re really nice. We ended up sharing a table together for dinner at the Hut. 
    The hiking today was interesting. It was so warm when I started that I was soaked by 7:30. By 10:00, the unexpected rain returned. Then it became a cold rain. The trail was now slick and dangerous. I slowed my pace, but still had a few near misses.
    I Stopped at Mizpah Spring Hut to take a break from the unexpected rain. Got leftover breakfast, pancakes and oatmeal. Later, in the worst of the wind, cold, and rain, I realized that my feet felt like they had frostbite. I kept thinking it’s not cold enough, but the 50 mile per hour wind on my soaked feet was the culprit.
    About 3 miles from the hut, I had trouble walking because of the wind’s speed. At one point, a gust blew me 4 feet to the right. I was glad not to be near a cliff edge. About 1.5 miles from the hut, all the clouds began to lift and blow away. The sun appeared with glorious rays. I got spectacular views, gorgeous every direction you could look. I have to admit, the blessings were so tangible, I had a worship service as I hiked. I could not believe that I was experiencing this adventure.
    The Hut was a wonderful side adventure, and I am glad that Backwoods helped me to book the night.

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642413,"The night’s sleep was good in the hut. You get an eerie sense from the echoes of the intense wind outside the building . It actually makes you feel lucky to be inside the shelter. I woke and started my chores before most of the 35 guests started stirring around. I admit that I was excited to except the challenge to summit Mount Washington.
    From the windows of the dining room built in 1915, I could see the weather towers on the peak. It did not look too high, but it was still another 1,250 feet up. The only thing I struggled with was how much gear to wear. I knew I would get hot once I started the accent, but what would the wind chill be like?
    Let’s flashback in time for a moment…“That is about the stupidest thing I have ever heard!”. That was the first reaction from my great friend Turtle when I told him my plans back in 2013. He was letting me have it in a joking fashion. I had revealed to him and Yo-yo that I wanted to hike Mt. Washington next. I had finished the Smokey’s, and thought the next step for my Thru-hike preparation should be the hardest area of the whole AT. My logic was if I had already hiked all the difficult sections before hand, the complete hike would be much easier. Once I retired, and began the journey, I would know what to expect.
    Turtle went on to say, “You will hike up the 5,000 foot climb, be covered in sweat, tears, and blood, and be so worn out you won’t be able to stand!” Then he delivered the punch to the gut as only Turtle can, “then, as you look around, there will be little kids walking around eating Corn Dogs!” I had to laugh, he was right. The public can ride the Cog-train all the way to the summit. Needless to say, I abandoned that plan. From that point on, my beautiful wife, Backwoods, and I started section hiking from Springer Mountain in Georgia. We would over the next 9 years, just starting at the spot where we finished the previous trek.
    Now I was actually doing the Hardest Mountain on the whole trail. It is famous for having the highest recorded wind speeds in the world. The speed was recorded at 231 mph. This morning’s forecast was for 50, with windchill down to 28 degrees. Crazy for the middle of August. I only had one regret, Turtle and Yo-yo weren’t with me!
    The crew of the hut served us breakfast, family style. That is where you pass the servings of food down the table to the person next to you. It makes it easy to get to know others around you. I was beside Rita, April, Shinri, and Judd. We had great conversation, and I enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere. After the empty dishes were collected, it was time to have another adventure.
    As I made my way up the boulders and the rocks to get to the top of Washington, my adrenaline level was through the roof. I have had the same rush of energy before, like when I was getting ready to start a marathon. There was about 15 hikers that left the hut ahead of me. With my excitement, it didn’t take me long before I passed all of them. They were all day hikers, and no match for thru-hikers legs. Especially when I was all jacked up on adrenaline.
    I was hiking with my sleeveless shirt, a raincoat as a base layer, and my puffy jacket. I was sweating, even though it was very cold with the wind chill. So when I put my arms down, sweat poured out of the sleeves of my jacket. I knew I was rocking and rolling. As I topped the mountain, I realized it was meeting all my expectations. The views, the buildings, the weather equipment, and the history, filled my senses.
    I knew I could not stay on the summit for long, so I started my decent. Since I got up and over the mountain quickly, I beat the rush of the public tourist. As I was starting down, I crossed over the Cog train tracks. Shortly after, there were 3 trains headed down to the base station to load up. Then I saw them coming back up as I continued on my path.
    Then the real excitement started. Today was a Rally Sports car race up the road to the summit. Once a year they let these cars race one at a time from the bottom, to the top. Whoever’s time is best, wins. As the cars were racing around the hairpin turns, a helicopter was filming them, as he following them from above. I had it all, helicopters, trains, and automobiles.
    The pathway north was much more difficult than I expected. I had to do many miles of rock hopping. You actually can’t “hike”, but have to step or jump from one boulder to the next. Once I summited Mt. Madison, I had a 3,000 foot decent was also rock hopping. By the time I made it to the finish line, my feet and legs were toast. I did have a great sense of accomplishment for completing the most difficult part of the whole AT. -beavER","Lakes of the Clouds Hut

    Once I could finish the call, I ran outside to give hugs to the whole family. We spend about 2 hours visiting before Yesenia have to travel closer to the airport. Zey and I toured the old train depot built in 1907, and enjoyed the cool memorabilia around the station. There is also an old steam locomotive to explore.
    We went to a local pizza restaurant and then, the local ice cream stand to top it off. The plan is to hike out of Pinkham Notch in the morning as we tackle the Wildcat Mountains. I was able to complete all my needed tasks today. My much needed break was what Slow Poke would be proud to see!
    I also went to the extreme today by spending the night in the B & B. The main house was built in 1880, and it is the kind of home that Backwoods loves. I sent her pictures, and promised her we could stay here on the return trip home, if (when) I make it to Katahdin.

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642516,"This was another morning filled with excitement about what the day would hold. Bright sunshine greeted me as I emerged from the B & B. I said hello and goodbye to Slingshot and Chaloupa as they sat in the shuttle. They are about 21 miles ahead of me on the trail, but are here at the hostel because of how the path loops back this way as you travel.
    I had a great conversation with Vancoach from UK/ Australia. He is an Ultrarunner that is on visa that will expire after 30 days. He is here because he actually started trying to set a record running the whole trail. He had to average about 50 miles per day. His hip got inflamed, and forced him to abandoned attempt once he arrived at Hot Springs, NC. He decided to backpack as much as he could since he is already in the US.
    We were shuttled back to Pinkham Notch visitor center to start straight up for 2,000 feet right out of the gate. Zey and I are doing the White Mountains called the Wildcats. The terrain is very challenging with steep ups and downs. The weather today was on the warm side, but with low humidity, it was quite nice.
    The views today were top notch as we enjoyed seeing Mt. Washington and Madison to our left side from oat of the day. One cool thing about Wildcat Mountain is that it has a ski resort on it. We we arrived at the first summit, we were welcomed by the ski lift that is closed until snow fall. It looks like a space ship, and I went over to sit in one of the bench seats.
    As we climbed, Zey and I passed Jet Pack. She was hiking the same plan as we were today, just a little slower. She said the swelling of her left foot has improved, but is not 100% yet. 
    We stopped for lunch at the Carter Notch Hut, and refilled with water there. They have a deal for Thru-Hikers, and sometimes give us food if it is left over. Zey and I got some free lentil soup and brownies. Not that helped give us energy for the big climbs.
    We made it to our shelter and decided to sleep inside verses in our tents because of the chance of rain. I am getting good use of my most important and lightest piece of equipment tonight. My ear plugs! The fellow sleeping beside me is snoring like a freight train. The shelter is mostly full, so there is no place for me to hide. Such is trail life, you take the good with the bad. -beavER","Pinkham Notch Visitor Cnt.- Gorham, NH.

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642652,"My ear plugs worked great last night. So great, that the chainsaw snoring machine woke up and packed all his things without waking me. I was shocked when I woke to see that people on both sides of me were gone from the shelter. The bird’s singing, normally wakes me at 5:30, so I had a strange feeling as I came to my senses at 6:20. I immediately began packing as quickly as possible.
    Zey had already ate and left the building (Elvis) as he thought I was already gone. As I looked around the shelter, I saw someone still in their sleeping bag, I thought it was Zey, so I started taking my time. Once I realized it was not Zey, I got my act together and hit the trail.
    We stayed in the shelter because it was going to rain, so the rocks were slick this morning. I had to be careful as I made my way down the mountain. I was happy to stay on my feet the whole trip to the flat lands. Zey told me later he slipped down 4 times. The decent was dangerous, but not as bad as some we have done lately. And the last 3 miles were not bad at all, so I was able to rest my feet and legs.
    Our plan was to do a short day today to be ready to hike out in the morning. As I came to the Rattle River Hostel, I saw Tejas’ truck in the parking lot. Tejas jokingly ask me if I had seen Zey, and I got nervous for a second until I knew he was joking. I felt much better once I saw Zey.
    Tejas introduced me to his brother Arnold and his nephew AJ. They had flown in to surprise him and Zey. When someone you love, takes time out of their busy schedules, and comes to meet you on the trail, it gives you an emotional boost. I felt wonderful for Zey, as this will help him be energized for the home stretch. I enjoyed being able to visit with Arnold and AJ, and breaking bread with them.
    We all went to Walmart together to shop for dinner supplies. Zey and I had been talking about how great nachos would be as we hiked for the last 2 days. We decided to make nachos for dinner, so we worked together to create them. We made chicken instead of beef. They really satisfied the craving I had talked myself into.
     The big milestone for today was we passed the 300 miles left to hike mark right before we finished today. Now that is hard for me to wrap my head around. There is 2 big ones coming up tomorrow if we can make our target.
    When I arrived at the Rattle River Hostel, I ran into 2 hikers I have not seen in a long time. The first one was Savage. She is the young lady that completed the half gallon ice cream challenge with me. It was great to see her and recount how difficult that was. The next hiker I saw again was Chimes. Last time I saw him was in April, back at the Nature’s Inn Hostel in Sam’s gap Tenn. He is helping here at this hostel. His hike ended shortly after I met him.
    We found out there is rain and bad weather headed our way soon because of the tropical storm. We will need to change plans to deal with problems it creates. I will be certain to set my alarm tonight to not oversleep in the morning. -beavER","Imp Shelter and Campsite

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642705,"After waking up early and having pancakes for breakfast, I checked out of the Hostel. I visited with Tejas and his brother Albert for a few minutes, and then hiked out. I had a road walk for the first mile as the trail went across the dam for the river before heading in the woods. Most of the Hikers were not hiking out today because of the rain.
    The rain did come as forecast. It made the rocks very slick. The terrain was some of the worst we have hiked over. Steep ups and downs with rock faces that are on angles, not good to be slick. Both Zey and I had many slips, but praise the Lord, no major falls. The mud was also bad from the rain. We had everything you need for a challenging hike, pain, rain, mud, and hugh climbs/ decent.
    The big milestones for the day were crossing the 1,900 mile mark! Finishing up the Whites! And the biggest milestone was crossing into Maine! In state number 14, with 13 complete and in the rear view mirror. I let out a loud yell when we made it to the marker. One of the last Mountains we summited was Mt. Success. It was very difficult to find your way in the pouring rain, as it was poorly marked. Everyone got lost as they tried to cross it.
    Today was difficult, no question about it. But, I am very excited about being in the final state. The shelter we are staying at is full with 12 hikers squeezed in. Some of the people I know that are here, Jet Pack, Quadzilla- from France, Tangles, and Spirit. It was a red letter day, welcome to Maine!

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642769,"The shelter was full, so when I started getting ready, I tried not to wake anyone. The morning went smooth as all the hikers worked together to make things flow smoothly. Jet Pack was the first one to start hiking and everyone wished her well. The excitement level was high for everyone. We were all facing the toughest challenges of the whole AT this morning and afternoon.
    The day held two enormously demanding sections of trail for us to negotiate. The first would be Mahoosuc Notch. For one mile, it is one of the hardest and most fun sections of the entire Appalachian Trail. Within minutes of finishing the Notch, we had Mahoosuc Arm to tackle. It is one of the steepest climbs on the Appalachian Trail, with the trail rising 1500 feet in just one mile.
    The morning started great with the weather clearing up and sunshine eventually breaking through with blue skies. We had plenty of mud from the rain yesterday, but we were happy with the dry day. It was about 6 miles of rough hiking before we make it to Mahoosuc Notch. There were hard ups and down, so we were already beat down before we even started the Notch.
    The trail was so difficult before we attempted the Notch that 2 hikers had meltdowns before they stepped foot in the notch. Everyone tried to encourage them.
    I have to say that Mahoosuc Notch was unbelievably difficult. I fell and slipped more than I have for the first 1,900 miles. I shed blood in the Notch from those falls. The worst one I had happened as I tried to negotiate a ledge. The tree I was holding onto broke, I knew I was in trouble when I heard the loud crack.
    My body weight caused me to start falling backwards as my hand hold disappeared in an instant. I was also going slightly sideways over the ledge. It was a 7 foot drop to the rocks below. My left foot was wedged between the ground and a small tree as I started to tumble. I was able to use my free right hand to grab a small rock outcropping as I was going off the edge. My new hand hold arrested my downward movement.
    I found myself suspended on the edge of the ledge, with my left ankle bent all the way back since it was wedged in the small tree. Once I pulled myself back up, I could free up my trapped foot. Beside the large scratches and blood on my outer ankle, I could not tell how close I was to spraining my ankle. I was able to continue hiking on it the rest of the day.
    Zey and I both were beat up badly by the time we finished our hikes today. As we closed in on the finish line of Mahoosuc Notch, Quadzilla joined us and we all celebrated by giving high fives and taking a selfie together.
    Then we headed straight up some of the steepest climb on the whole trail called Mahoosuc Arm. From there we headed in up to Summit Old Speck Mountain. Then came the downhill, 3.5 miles and 3,700 feet drop. Our legs were spent. We finished right before dark and we’re glad to get off the trail. Wow what a tough day. I was really happy I could share it with Zey and Quadzilla from France.

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642795,"Our original goal for the day was 10-12 miles tops! After you complete the stressful sections we have done over the last week, the smart money is on a zero day. Zey was texting Slow Poke, and she wanted to know why we were hiking instead of taking a zero day. She said, “you know everyone takes a zero after doing Mahoosuc Notch.”
    I was concerned as I hit the trail for the 10 or so miles. I had taken a beating over the last few days, especially yesterday. It was the most physical beat down so far. I spent extra time stretching and praying. We we started our 2,300 foot climb out of the box, I thought this might be too much! Zey, on the other hand felt energized. He admitted later that he felt better than he has in a long time… at least early in the day. I had to let him disappear out of sight as we climbed, I had to pace myself, it is a marathon, and not a sprint.
    As we got to the first lookout point, the beautiful morning lifted our spirits. A few days ago, the forecast for late yesterday and today was rain because of the tropical storms. It all changed in the last 24 hours, giving us an opportunity to get miles today while the sun-shined. That’s why we were hiking instead of zeroing.
    When Zey cleared the lookout, he was rolling. He text me to ask if I though we could up the mileage. If we did slightly over 20 miles, we would make it to Andover. I was behind him, but feeling better than expected, so I text back that I thought it was obtainable. So, we were locked in for a full day’s challenge. Someone needs to donate my brain to science when I am gone!
    The views with the great morning weather were stunning. Welcome to Maine! It seems to be all wilderness as far as the eye can see. I really enjoyed some of the climbs, but they were difficult all day. We did have a few miles of trail that were  comfortable to hike. I started gaining on Zey as his adrenaline started to wear off, and we ended up staying close the rest of the day. He would pull me up the hills, and I would carry him on the downhills.
    Right before lunch, we came to a small waterfall, Dunn Cascades. There is a nice swimming hole at the base of the falls, and it did not take long for both of us to be under water. The cold water was exhilarating as the day was becoming hot. We both worked our way across the chest deep pool to put our heads under the falls. 
    At lunch, one of the hikers, named Anvil, told us he was getting off the trail. I had met him 3 days ago, and was surprised to find out he had lost his motivation to continue. The second thing that happened at lunch was surreal. An older lady started backing her van into a parking space 2 spots away from us. When she came to a stop, I noticed that she looked exactly like me dear Mom from my vantage point. So much so, that I had to try to comprehend what was going on.
    It was a actually difficult for me to understand. Was I going crazy, or getting dehydrated, and starting to get delusional? Just then, a hiker walked up and started talking to her. I could see major facial differences from my mom once she began to talk. I also saw that she was taking hikers to her hostel.
    The rest of the afternoon, the miles went by quickly, and Zey and I had good conversations to pass the time. The heat caused me to sweat like there was no tomorrow, so I forced myself to drink as much water as I could. We had some really great views on Maine as we hiked.
    Tejas had made arraignments for us to stay at the Cabin Hostel in Andover. When he met us at the trail head, he told us that they had a big spread of food for diner, and had saved us a couple of servings. When we arrived, they sat us at the dining room table and fed us like kings. Salad, lemon aid, Spaghetti with meat balls, garlic bread toast, corn on the cob, and homemade brownies with ice cream for dessert.
    And guess who was serving and visiting with us as we ate? The owner of this hostel, the lady I had seen driving the van at lunch time that reminded me of my mother. Her trail name is “Honey”. She has tons of history with the AT, and shared some of it with us as we enjoyed dinner. She was a great friend of Earl Shaffer, the first person to ever thru-hike the AT back in 1948. I told her that she reminded me of my mom.
    I called Backwoods to let her know that I made it through another crazy hiking day. Of course the first thing she said was, “what happened to the 12 mile day?” After Earl Shaffer completed his hike, motivated by wanting to free his mind of the WW II events he experienced, people called him “That crazy guy!” I guess I am in good company.

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642858,"Zero day was the plan. One thing for sure, to successfully complete a Thru-hike, you must be flexible. The plan went in the trash can! All three of us separately came to the same conclusion once we checked the revised forecast this morning. Hike miles today to take advantage of the reduced rain from the tropical storms. Once we started talking together, we knew it was right thing to do. My body needs rest, but if we lower the miles, it will help.
    The breakfast at the Cabin Hostel was awesome, with blueberry pancakes. The owners are extremely kind and friendly. It has been one of my favorite places on the trail to stay. I just love talking to Honey about trail history of early hikers.
    When Zey and I hit the trail, it was obvious we were going to get wet and have zero views today. A cloud was socking us in as it enveloped the mountain. There was the mist that comes from being in the 100% humidity.
    We ran into Maple and Syrup soon after we started, and then shortly after, met up with Tangles. The rest of the morning, Zey, Tangles, and I hiked together until lunch. We had great conversations, and Tangles shared her video of her falling 7 feet in the Notch. She was truly blessed not to be hurt beyond a sore back and some scratches on her legs and knees.
    The video was by pure chance, as a fellow hiker named Wanderer, just happened to be filming. He captured the fall, then shared it with her afterward. The same hiker who filmed her fall, later fell himself in that infamous stretch of dangerous traversing, called the Mahoosuc Notch. He is in the hospital as I write this entry. He has major internal damage to his intestines. Please say a prayer for him.
    We stopped at a shelter to have lunch and get out of the rain for a little while. After we talked about the slick conditions, and how many times we had slipped, it was time for Zey and me to get moving. Tangles wanted to wait for Spirit to catch up with her, so she hung out there. We finished the short hike day and headed toward the hostel.
    We made it and had extra time to do our chores of washing clothes and showering before dinner. I contacted Backwoods by phone to let her know our condition, and also tried to explain why we hiked instead of taking a zero. We also started picking a target date when we possible could summit Katahdin. Is it really getting this close?
    It looks as if we will be hiking in the rain again tomorrow. One step at a time.

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642905,"We checked out of the hostel after another great breakfast. Zey and I were looking forward to hiking again in the rain. We knew it should not be too bad, and the steady drizzle actually was not bad. As we were making our plans for a easier hiking day, we knew other hikers were staying put and taking a zero day.
    The trail greeted us with some mud and muck, but we are veterans of how to negotiate the slop. The funniest thing that happened today was that Zey was tricked by the “puncheon”.  A puncheon is a board they use to span a section of mud. They are usually 6 feet long and 6 inches wide. Sometimes they are used in pairs to make it easier to walk.
    Many times these puncheons should have been replaced 3 years ago. This was the case on the one that tricked Zey. The board appeared ok, just slightly below the mud surface on the end away from Zey as he began to traverse it. We were deep in a great conversation about his potential work career after he finishes the trail. As he stepped on the far end of the board, he quickly realized that something was not right. The end section was completely broken off, just floating. His foot quickly disappeared up to mid calf into the thick, black, sticky, and wet mud.
    Zey took it in stride after a quick “oh no!” It took him a few moments to shake the mud off. One of the cool sayings that Zey has after he makes a misstep, like a slide and fall is, “I will marinate in it for a while before I move on!”
    We did not see any other north bound hikers today. This was the first day that we did not have any giant climbs or descents. My legs appreciated the break.
    When we came to a power line clearing close to lunch, we found blackberries,  raspberries, and blueberries all in one spot. It was hard to walk away after we ate about 4 handfuls. We also hiked beside numerous large ponds today that all had beautiful views.
    Zey decided to continue hiking a few more miles once we got to our pull out point. He wants to make it to the summit of Saddleback Mountain by sunrise tomorrow morning to enjoy the view. That will put him about 4 miles ahead of me that I will need to make up tomorrow.

I was able to get into deep meditation thoughts and prayer this morning. And thanking the Lord for the beauty of the hike and adventure I am partaking in. I was doing a solo hike this morning because Zey was about 4 miles ahead of me.
    He had camped at a pond with Slim Shady and Syrup. They took the boat out on the pond last night and this morning. The boat is stored there for campers to use if they wish. Zey said he was able to watch the sun rise from the boat.

The temperature was perfect for hiking with low humidity. That changed as the day went on, and it was hotter than the comfortable range. But until lunch, it was nice.
    Early, I passed the rock with a plaque, for when the CCC completed the trail and joined the last sections together in August. 1937. It was the sections I was hiking.
    The next big milestone for the day was that I made it to the “only 200 miles” to go point shortly after going by the plaque. Yeah! Less than 2 hundred, I have thought about this accomplishment for months. The thing I kept telling myself was, “if I make it that far, I could crawl the rest of the way!”
    The terrain was tough today with tons of roots and small boulders. You had to keep an eye on every foot placement. The hotter temps after lunch did help dry up some of the muddy areas. Views were more scarce today, so most of the time I just kept my head down and walked.
    The largest milestone today was hitting the 2,000 mile mark! All I can say is for some reason I let out a hugh war whoop. I felt much better. It will take a few days to let it sink in. I am now a official “AT Thru-Hiker. By definition, as long as you hike at least 2,000 miles in a calendar year, you qualify as such.
    I saw most of the hikers that were at the shelter last night, and we leap frogged back and forth. I tried to keep a steady pace and enjoy as much of the hike as I could. Tejas had found a great Campground not far from the trail.
    We grilled out pork cutlets, and had broccoli with carrots, plus mashed potatoes and corn. We were full after dinner. Tejas drove me up to the local laundromat to do clothes. While I was getting things clean, he surprised me with a pint of ice cream. Man was I happy.
    I am putting a burden on Backwoods to try to coordinate all the plans for the Baxter State Park and Katahdin. It is stressful trying to understand all the rules and regulations that one has to deal with to enter Baxter State Park. With us passing the 2,000 mile mark, it will not be long now. We are trying to finalize plans now.

There were 5 different climbs up to separate peaks. Both Zey and I were feeling all the big climbs over the last couple of weeks.
    The Bigelow’s became one of my favorite sections today. The views were stunning. One after another. All the beautiful scenery made up for the strenuous elevation changes. These were also the last summits over 4,000 feet until we reach Katahdin. The large lakes below made the views even better.
    The heat made the day tougher, and there were long stretches with no water. I was glad to get to a water source, and would drink a liter of water each time.

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643242,"The morning started out really nice because of cooler temperatures. I slept very comfortable last night and was excited about today. This morning, we sat off with three days of food to make it to Monson, ME. But, the coolest thing about today, was the target to get to the Kennebec River. The big deal about it is the river crossing.
    The way you cross is by a ferry boat. I will have to do it tomorrow morning. The Ferry operates from 9-2 daily. By the time I arrived, the Ferry operator was long gone. I have been intrigued by the concept of crossing the river in a boat every since I heard about it years ago. And now I am on the eve of doing it.
    The trail was completely different today. We are now out of Southern Maine, with the the high Mountains, that consist of steep climbs and descents. Today had only moderate elevation changes. By the terrain was still difficult at times with small boulders and more roots than you can image. But, there was also nice hiking sections.
    I hiked beside multiple lakes for quite a while. By the shore, you can hear the water lapping the shoreline. You get a tranquil feeling as you relax while hiking. I noticed a young lady passing me going south. I realized I knew her face, so I stopped her and asked her trail name. It was “Thunder Chicken”! I have not seen her since Backwoods and I left her at Newfound Gap. She caught a shuttle there in the cold rain. She is hiking 150 miles south, a big section hike. It was great to see her, we talked for awhile to catch up on things in our hiking worlds. She wanted me to tell Backwoods hi!
    I also ran into Slingshot, Chalupa, and Slim Shady at the East Carry Pond Beach. We went swimming at the pond. After I swam, I hiked to the north end of the pond. There I found Zey and Quadzilla waiting for me at a great lunch spot. We enjoyed the perfect temperature day, it was great. But, I had to keep moving shortly after my meal since I had plans to make it to the river.
    I finally got cell service around 2:30, and called Backwoods, it had been over 24 hours with no AT&T bars. One of the reasons I pushed all the way to the river was I heard there was good signal, and they were right.
    The final miles of the day went by quickly as I was flanked by streams and waterfalls. When I rolled down by the river crossing, I felt like I was imbedded in a story that was unfolding around me. The river is wide and wild looking. I could see people on the northern shore swimming on the opposite banks. But, they seemed far away because of the width.
    I could see the channel that is used for the Ferry Boat to dock. The area is lined with logs and boards for people to set on as they wait for their turn to cross. But, there was no crowds or people to be seen anywhere on my side of the river, just me. I had taken a gamble there would be a place for me to tent. None of the information I had mentioned campsites in the south side of the river, only many sites on the northern banks, the other side. That is why almost everyone, including Zey & Quadzilla, stopped at the over crowed shelter 3.5 miles back.
    I was happy to see many spots to chose from. I picked one close to the last downhill before the river. I decided to walk up the path to a high spot to see if it was better there. When I topped the hill, I saw a tent that looked familiar. It is a pink (salmon) color. It is this years version of my Zpacs Duplex tent. It is Biscuits, a guy I have seen multiple times and camped with along the trail. So, Biscuit will be #1 and I will be #2 to cross in the morning. I can’t wait. I hope I remember to make a video in my excitement.
    My and Zey’s goal is to make Monson, ME. by Sunday evening. And then after leaving Monson, we will be hiking the 100 mile wilderness. The wilderness is just that, with not much else. It is a famous stretch that takes the hiker to the welcome mat of Katahdin. That welcome mat is the ABOL bridge. From there you go into Baxter State Park.
    Am I really this close? Will I actually be in a boat in the morning, traversing the Kennebec? Somebody pinch me please!

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643294,"Wow! My excitement level was through the roof this morning. I got packed up, then headed down to the river’s edge to cook my breakfast. There, as I enjoyed the peaceful solitude, I begin the wait for the ferry. The schedule start time is 9 o’clock. 
    Shortly after I finished breakfast, Biscuit came down from his tent site to the river. He was full of excitement also, but he was still anxious that he hadn’t got to cross the river last night by walking/swimming through it with his buddies. They had made it. So he was bound and determined to cross the river, as the river was lower than it had been. So he decided he’s going to walk across, even though it’s only an hour before the ferry started shuttling people.
    So, off he went trudging through the water. He went about a quarter of a mile upstream, and then started across and reached a small rock island you could see about halfway across. He made it to the rocks without getting too wet. The water was close to his knees. But then after the rock island, that’s were it gets deep.
    He began to wade across and stopped and came back, as he needed to adjusted his pack. He put more things in a trash bag to keep them dry. From there he went ahead and crossed. He got into the deep water, probably a little deeper than had hoped for, but the current was really strong.
    He commented that it was sketchy, but he did make it. Afterward, he came back down river on the other side, and we had a conversation across the water. I wished him well, and congratulated him on making it. But for me, I was just gonna sit there for the next hour and stay dry. He was soaked from about chess level down. I’m not sure how wet his backpack became.
    An hour later, I was the first one in the canoe, and I was joined by Slim Shady. We began the crossing with the operator. We were in a canoe and it was actually fun, and I enjoyed sitting up front and paddling. Slim Shady sit in the middle and just enjoyed the ride. He also got to video me. Before I got in the canoe to go across, a large line formed, about 12 to 15 people. I looked over the crowd, I could not see Zey yet. So, I knew it would take him well over an hour to be able to get across the river. Later in the day, I had cell service, and we found out that I was 5 miles ahead of him.
    As I hiked, I was able to FaceTime with my daughter and one of my grandsons. I also got to talk to Backwoods, and let her know I didn’t drown, or flip the canoe. The trail for the first part was not so bad, kind of enjoyable, and I was still hopped up on adrenaline. It would get much more difficult as the day proceeded. Roots and rocks were the theme for a big part of the day.
    Most of the first part of the morning, until lunchtime, was climbing up to Pleasant Pond Mountain is about 2,000 foot elevation gain. Bald Mountain Brook Privy had a surprise for me. When I stepped out of the door after I finished, it’s wire mesh wrap got me.
    The mesh protects it from porcupines, but there’s little sharp wire pieces sticking out right by the door’s edge. So, when I came out,  the sharp wire got my leg. It reopened a wound. So I had blood running down my leg.
    It started sprinkling at 7:00, and so I had to stop and break out the rain gear. The rocks being wet and slick was my fear. I found water, right before dark, on a logging road. I also found a nice rock to use, as it was getting dark, to do my dinner on. As I was cooking dinner the rain started. And then, here came Biscuit, hiking with his headlamp on. He was going about a quarter mile up to camp.
    I was able to get my dinner finished before the rain got heavier.  Then, I packed up, and started night hiking in the dark. About five minutes before midnight I spooked something really large. I am guessing a moose. It made sounds like a truck running over tree limbs, but I couldn’t see it. It was dark thirty.
    I pushed hard all day, and even with the late start, I made my goal. I had 2 motivations for the big miles. Number 1, If I could get into Monson early on Sunday, I could make it to a church. This Sunday is my last chance to attend a worship service in Maine while hiking. Number 2, this was my last day of hiking I could go “all in”, after today, all of the next days will be on a schedule. I know, I am crazy.
    I finished the day by crossing the East Branch of the Piscataquis River. Of course, since I am crazy, it was over the beaver dam, by headlamp, in the dark, after midnight. What an amazing day!

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643325,"The morning arrived quickly. I stopped hiking last night around 1:00 am. I found a stealth site on a old logging road as I was climbing a steep hill. The flat tent site was great. Between the bed time chores and writing my journals, I closed my eyes at 3:03 am. I noticed that a light rain started about 2:00. My alarm went off at 4:30 am. It was still raining as I hit the snooze a couple of times.
    Once I was awake enough to think things through, I knew I needed to get up. All the extra hiking I did last night would be wasted if I did not finish the last 6 miles. The rain stopped as soon as I sat up. I skipped breakfast and started hiking fast to make up for the snooze minutes lost.
    I made it to the trailhead by 8:00, and Tejas gave me a ride to the hostel. I took a shower and changed to clean clothes. Before I knew it, I was in the Monson Community Church as a guest. My last chance to make it to a worship service, and the craziest path. I was grateful to be there.
    The Church Chairman, Daryl Witmer, made me feel at home with his friendly personality. I enjoyed the service and the music. The Pastor and Daryl are doing a interesting series by answering questions people have about God or the Bible. Today’s question they addressed was, “why does bad things happen?”
    Later in the afternoon, Tejas and I ate at the Restaurant that is part of the Lakeshore House, we got cheeseburgers. Biscuit came in as we ate. I shared the videos I took of him Crossing the Kennebec River yesterday. I spent the next few hours cleaning my backpack, drying my tent, and going through my resupply to preparing for the 100 mile wilderness.
    Zey and Quadzilla made it to the town around 6:00. We are all ecstatic that we have a zero day tomorrow.

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643363,"My body felt as if I played in a NFL playoff game for a losing team. I have been tackled by the trail All Pro Linebacker. The zero day could not have come at a better time. For those of you who are keeping score: my Last Zero was August 16, exactly 2 weeks ago. A total of 204.9 miles back. This is my last zero that is planned.
    Let me make sure everyone that is following me knows… cell service for the rest of the hike will be almost nonexistent. I have one spot that I have a chance to post once I step across the threshold of the 100 Mile Wilderness tomorrow morning. That will be the late evening of Sept. 3. I should be past the halfway point of the Wilderness by then.
    Today was a restful day. I was able to prepare my food and backpack for the journey. But, the main attraction for the day was finalizing the plans. Make no mistake about it, the center piece of our teams plans revolves around Tejas.
    Tejas had to stop his Thru-hike around mile 1,300 because of plantar fasciitis. After traveling home, and being restless, for 2 weeks, he decided to come back and support his son Zey’s Thru-hike attempt. The hope of everyone for the last month has been that Tejas could heal enough to hike this Wilderness and summit Katahdin with Zey. Please ask the Lord to bless his attempt. He will be literally stepping out in faith in the morning.
    The plans we have laid out involve less miles and more breaks. We also have to coordinate all the plans with Backwoods as she will meet up with us to summit Katahdin. (If weather is good).
    Everyone is full of nervous energy, and excitement. I have anticipated this plunge into the wild for more than a decade. I can’t wait to share the moment with all of you as soon as technology allows. This  trail adventure is consumed with contrast.
    One other note, we are at the Lakeshore House Hostel, and have enjoyed the piece of a small group of guests, mainly us. The “famous” hostel up the street, Shaw’s Hostel, is overflowing. They found out today that one of their staff tested positive for Covid. Please keep the hikers and staff in your prayers also who have been exposed.
    Since I did not do any hiking today, I am loading video from the Mahoosuc Notch.

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643403,"The owner of the Lakeshore House Hostel shuttled us to the trail head this morning. I was in the moment, I not only was taking my first steps in the 100 mile wilderness, but Tejas was committing to the challenge of getting back on the trail.
    I had one job, try to keep Tejas from taking off, like a thoroughbred from the starting gate. I knew he would be excited and all jacked up on adrenaline. I talked him into letting me lead for the first couple of miles. 
    We started off with several lakes with beautiful views, and someone had left some trail magic at one of the intersection sign post. It was 2 whole watermelons in a cardboard box. We did not eat any, but Slim Shady told us he cut it up and ate some when he crossed paths with us later.
    Tejas did well until after lunch. We had stopped at a waterfall area to eat. All was good, and I got to talk with Chewy, the last time I saw her was in Virginia. She ask if I had seen Slingshot, which I had, yesterday at Shaws Hostel.
    After lunch, the strenuous trail conditions started to wear Tejas down. He has been off the trail since New Jersey, so it is like starting from square one. I began to pray for him and tried to give him space as I hiked behind him. By 3:00, we were about 5 miles from the campsite, but his body was toast.
    Zey had waited for us at a nice rock outcropping where we could take a break. Both Zey and I ask if we could carry some of his items. Before he could answer, Zey got up to open his pack. I jokingly said for Zey to give me the light stuff, and he could take the heavy. Of course, that’s what Zey did without blinking. We were able to reduce his pack weight by about 12 pounds.
    We continued on slowly and took additional short breaks. Zey and Quadzilla hiked ahead to secure us tent spots at the camp area. At one of the stream crossings, we got to see Gooey, the young man that Backwoods cut his hair. We got to the camp area not a minute too soon.
    We had just enough daylight to setup our tents and cook dinner before the evening darkness moved in. I finished hanging my bear bag by headlamp illumination.
    While I was cooking my mountain house meal, I stared to chuckle as I looked at Tejas struggling to sit up in his tent directly in front of me. He ask if I was laughing at him? I tried to explain that I was not, but I was snickering to myself because I wanted to video him in his exhausted condition, but I couldn’t bring myself to do it. The truth is, I admire him for putting every ounce of energy he has into trying to make memories with his son. Believe me, Zey and I both know what pain this trail can unleash on the human body. Bravo Tejas! Now take some Vitamin I (ibuprofen).
    I heard from one of the hikers that we might have cell service on top of the mountain we climb early tomorrow. I hope to post this entry if we do. Day one of the Wilderness in the books!

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643498,"We only had to go .2 miles before we reached a major milestone! It was the marking of the 100 miles to go. That is a wake up call to me of how fast this adventure is moving to the final summit. I did start to get sentimental, but the day’s concerns kept me from thinking about the impact for long.
    As we made steep climbs, we arrived at Barren Ledges, the views were great. We found ourselves to be in good moods and we took many pictures. It was a beautiful area to see the lakes below.
    The 100 mile wilderness, day 2, turned into one of those days that you dream about when your backpack, as far as the weather was concerned. The temperature was in the 60s most the morning, and became mostly sunny with a slight breeze. Plus very low humidity, perfect for hiking, and just one that you love to be out in the woods.
    As we continued hiking up Barren Mountain, we came up to the fire tower. The wood enclosure is no longer there, but the steel frame structure is still remains. We all climbed up its little rickety ladder, but the higher we got, the more wind we felt.
    There at the site of old fire tower, I had a little bit of cell signal. I was able to post my journal from there, which was a good surprise. And shortly after that, I ran into a guy going the other way. I thought I recognized him, as I looked, I realized I did. It was Mr. Clean, from New York City. He had been in the theater. He’s flip-flopping and hiking back to New York. It was good to see him again.
    Everyone hiked out as I worked to post my journal and make my Facebook Group entry. When I did start hiking, I found a bracelet on the trail. I thought it might be Tejas’ and it fell off. I stuck if in my pocket and hiked on. I caught them at the next view point. We were going to take lunch there.
    I ask Tejas if something was missing from his wrist. He looked down and I could tell his heart sank. He grabbed his wrist and said, “oh no!” I told him he could just wear mine, since his was gone. I reached in my pocket and pulled out the bracelet he thought he would never see again. After I gave it to him, he realized it was his. He took 3 steps toward the view of the gorgeous mountains and turned his back to us. From my vantage point, I could tell he had trail dust in his eyes. He told us that his wife, Sandra, had put it on his wrist right before he left, and he had not taken it off.
    Our second amazing milestone of the day was at this viewpoint. It was the 2,100 mile marker. This is another flashing indication lamp that this adventure is quickly escaping me! This was the last 100 mile indicator that I will cross… no more left since the trail ends at 2,193.1.
    After lunch, the roots and rocks, plus the climbs started wearing Tejas down. Our speed continued to slow as the day and Mile’s went by. I volunteered to carry another bag to help him reduce more weight. We knew that the daylight was disappearing and we would need to night-hike to make the final 2 miles. Right before we made our campsites, we had to forge the Pleasant River. Tejas switched to his camp crocks to walk across by headlamp. I did it barefoot, and the river bottom rocks were very slick. I made it without falling.
    Zey and Quadzilla had hiked ahead of us at lunch to secure us the campsite. They were worried about our whereabouts, and thought we had decided to pull up somewhere and camp. They were happy to see we were ok.
    Since Tejas was having difficulty making the miles, we will share more of his backpack weight tomorrow. The plan is to make his pack as light as we can. We think if we can get him through tomorrow, The trail becomes more friendly the day after. He really did a great job pushing through the weariness to make it.

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643549,"suprise cell phone service again, yeah!    Because of the difficult day yesterday, I did not get to sleep until after midnight. I slept great, until I heard raindrops hitting my tent at 5:00 am. I really did not cherish the thought of breaking down my tent in a cold rain. I have been there before, so I got it done. I cooked breakfast inside my tent to stay dry as long as I could. Tejas did the same thing. Because no one was excited about hiking it the rain, we got a late start. We hit the trail around 9:00.
    We had all worked out a plan to help Tejas make it through today. I was worried about his reserve energy levels after yesterday. We had a set of 4 mountain peaks to get over, ending with White Cap Mountain. Somehow we needed to save Tejas’ legs from getting worn out early in the day. Quadzilla carried his tent, Zey his stove and food bag, and me, his clothes, and his bag of accessories. We had his backpack down to almost slack packing weight. It paid off, late in the day, his had energy to hike fast enough to make it to the shelter before dark.
    The first peak was a climb of over 2,000 feet. The next 3 were 750, 500, and 700 feet. We ended up at 3,644 feet in elevation on White Cap Mountain. As we reached it, I let out a big war whoop. Tejas and I celebrated because he had made it.
    After the celebration, Tejas started the descent. It was about 2,500 foot drop, over 5 miles to the Lean-To shelter. I hung out on top long enough to post my journal and Facebook Group entries. I had cell service, so I took advantage of it. When I started down, I followed the path to the windy side of the mountain. It got cold quick, with wind gusts around 35 mph. Man was I glad to get below tree line to have a wind break from the pine trees.
    Tejas was able to kick it into high gear once we were past the extremely steep downhill section. We were also happy to finish the hike today because this section is the last set of big climbs until we reach Katahdin.
    Quadzilla and Zey had a nice campfire burning at the shelter. Tejas and I set up our tents and cooked our dinners in the shelter. It was dark by the time we started eating, but we did not feel rushed today once we arrived at the the camp. It will be nice to get a good nights sleep tonight.

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643565,"Before 5:00, I was awake early. There was an animal making noise outside that sounded strange, but I was not sure what it was. I could not tell if it was in the area of my bear bag. I hang my food in a special bag from a tree branch every night. Some shelters have steel boxes to store your food items in to keep bears from getting to it. None of the campsites in New Hampshire or Maine have bear boxes.
    So, as soon as I get my tent set up, I go about the chore of finding a tree limb that is at least 10 feet of the ground to throw my rope over. I have a small bag that has a zipper pouch, which is used to hold a small rock. You attach the rope to bag, then aim at the branch. The goal is to have the rope at least 6 feet from the trunk of the tree. That way if the bear climbs the tree to get at the bag, he can’t reach it.
    Since the animal making the noise had my attention, I gave up on sleeping. I was pleased to see my bear bag safely hanging in the tree when I crawled out of my tent before sunrise.
    Before we started hiking, I brought up my idea for a change for today’s itinerary. I wanted to pull ahead the food drop to 2 o’clock instead of 4 o’clock. We had arranged to have a hostel, Shaws, to bring us food we had supplied to them back in Monson. For a fee, they will meet you about halfway through the 100 miles with your supplies. That way, you don’t need to carry 7 day’s worth of food staring out. Everyone agree with pulling the pick up time ahead. That allowed us to make our campsite by 4:30 instead of 6:30.
    The negative to that was we would need to hike faster and not take a lunch break until we got to the pickup point around 1:30. Everything worked out perfect… there is always an “except!”
    The guy from Shaws was great, he was early, and was patient with us. It felt so nice to come up to the road crossing and see him there with our 3.5 days of food and supplies. Quadzilla was able to arrive at the road with not one piece of food left. That is always a great feeling to not have carried any extra weight. The “except” had to do with the rain.
    The original forecast of of a nice day today was modified to an 80% chance of midday showers. They held off until we were in the middle of the food drop. I had to unpack all my gear to get to everything that needed replacing from the resupply. For an example, I had a new canister of fuel in the supply, so I needed to pull my stove out, and replace to can of fuel that was 2/3 empty. I don’t want to carry both cans since a full can will make it the remaining 52 miles.
    I had all my stuff spread out on the ground, a was so involved in my actions, I did not see the black cloud overshadow us. But I did see the huge drops falling suddenly in my exposed prize possessions.
    I had to scramble to keep the thing you fear most on the trail from happening, everything becoming soaked! I jammed all the goods back into my pack
As quickly as humanly possible. Then I cover my pack with a trash bag. All was good again, except for having to wait for the rain cloud to pass. Once it did, I finished up the squirreling away of all my new treasures.
    The trail today was the kindest we have hiked sine the Shenandoah’s. We had one small climb early of 1,000 feet, and that was it. There were long stretches of dirt only. When we were at the summit of our small mountain, I had just enough cell service to post my journal. While we were up there, Slim Shady told us that his air mattress had a large hole, and he was not able to use it. I had a repair patch, and gave it to him. He was very grateful to not have to sleep on the ground again.
    After doing our resupply, we had 4.3 miles to hike to our campsite. The trail was more rocky and root covered, but we were in good spirits. As the rain continued to pop up suddenly, we happened on a beaver pond. Tejas called out, “hey beavER, beaver!” There were 2 large beavers swimming right in from of us. We were able to capture them in video. Tejas said he got pics of my cousins!
    The Antlers Campsite was a welcome sight, especially as we got to it in plenty of time to enjoy the evening. We are camped beside a large scenic lake, We have not been able to do that in a long time. We all sat together and broke bread, and shared great conversation. Myself, Tejas, Zey, Quadzilla, and Slim Shady. The cell service is also good here.
    It was a wonderful day, even with the unexpected rain showers. Tejas did well and is now about 2/3 the way through the wilderness. The hardest part is in our rearview. We have talked many times about how cool it is that he is blessed during this journey to be hiking with his son.
    He told me today that many people complement him on the fact that he wanted to do this adventure with his son. He said that to him, the real story is the fact that his son was willing to sacrifice time from his busy life, and want to do this Appalachia exploration with his dad!

Total Miles 2154.9  Today’s Miles 13.5



    “Hey beaver! Do you want to watch the sunrise? Good, you have 2 miniutes!” That is what I heard this morning. Tejas was waking me up, he knew I would be disappointed if I missed the glorious reveal of the new day. I sat up and quickly put on my glasses, then my shoes, within the allowed 2 minutes, I was at the lake shore. Our tents were only feet away from the water’s edge.
    What he should have said was you have 22 minutes. I was able to go back and grab my food bag, water, and stove. We had time to prepare and eat breakfast. The sun did not let us down, it was awesome. I was so glad Zey had told his dad last night that he wanted to see the sunrise from the shoreline. All 4 of us were watching the event. What a great way to start the day.
    We did not need to rush since our plan for the day was 13.5 miles. We took our time to enjoy every minute (all 22). After everything was illuminated with the fresh sunshine, we broke camp and hit the trail.
    As we were leaving the camp area, Slim Shady told us he might want to summit with us because he wished to do it with someone he knows. We told him we would love it if he decides to do it. He will let us know later.
    Because of our conversation, I started getting sentimental. I got some trail dust in my eyes as we were hiking as I was thinking about relationships I have been blessed to have on the trail. I had to drop back a little bit so that Tejas couldn’t see me wiping the dust out of my eyes and sniffling.  I was thinking about the realization I was doing the 100 mile wilderness with Tejas. And how that back when I first met him and Zey, I realized that his character and morals were top notch. Now, I’m finishing the trail with him and Zey.
    One of the most amazing things that’s happened to me on the trail, happened this morning. “Do you want to take a break on the rocks by this great pond?” That is what Tejas ask as we came up to a  spur trail to the gigantic body of water. So, we went out to take some pictures by posing on the rocks for a couple different shots. Tejas noticed over the shoulder the huge mountain in the distance. Then he brought it to my attention, we realized the mountain he had noticed was Katahdin!
    Just as bold and beautiful as you could ever imagine in the crystal clear weather. It stood out in all of it’s brilliance over the shiny blue water as the small waves rippled the lake. We enjoyed the sunshine reflecting off the gorgeous lake and sat there taking in the views of Katahdin. I knew that’s our our final destination that we’re hiking toward, the adventure’s end. It felt as if every one of my senses were more keen because of the moment.
    The remainder of the hiking for the day revealed views of lakes and streams as we hiked at lower elevations. We were constantly looking for a moose, but I guess they saw us before we could see them. Maybe we will have better luck tomorrow. 
    We made it to our shelter, and were glad to rest our legs and feet, as most of the terrain today today was root covered to the extreme. What was not roots, was rocks. I was able to find a great location north of the shelter with space for all 4 of our tents. Mine, Tejas’, Zey’s, and Quadzilla’s.
    Tomorrow will be our last full hiking day, now that is hard for me to imagine. I was able to get everything done today and finish writing my journal before 9:00 pm… that has never happened on the trail. I am usually just finishing up between 11:00 and midnight. Hey, I will get to sleep a little longer. Hope to have cell service in the morning as I summit the next mountain. Good night everyone.

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643688,"Sometimes you make a mistake and don’t suffer any consequences, and sometimes you do! That was my headlines for the last 24 hours.
    I was in a deep sleep around 2:00 am. I had an urge to go to the bathroom, and tried to ignore it… it might go away, right? When nature’s call became a yell, I knew I needed to get out of the tent and head to the privy.
    This particular outhouse was a long way from the tenting area. Once I had finished, I started the long hike back to the safety of my tent. I had only taken 2 steps from the privy when I noticed my rechargeable headlamp was fading.
    Then it hit me. I had accidentally fallen asleep a few nights ago with my headlamp on. When I noticed the light in my tent hours later, I knew that it had drained most of my recharged power. I had not done anything to correct it. The second thought I had was I don’t have any backup light with me!
    I almost always have my phone, with its flashlight function. Also, most of the time, my spare headlamp is in my backpack. But as my ability to navigate was becoming more difficult, it was all riding on this one dimming instrument. As I finished walking the .2 miles to my tent, I wanted to switch to the mode that uses less power, a red LED function.
    As soon as I switched, the headlamp when dark, it would not work in either mode. I was only 2 steps from my tent, but I could not see it, it was pitch black. The cloud covered sky did not allow any light from the stars, and it is a new moon. I knew instantly that I had dodged a bullet. If it had gone out on me any time as I travelled to, or from the shelter, I would have been in a mess. I did not suffer any consequences from my mistake, and I knew it.
    Tejas and I were up early and excited to put miles behind us. We had a 1,000 foot climb up Nesuntabunt Mountain. When you reach the top of the climb, there’s a great view point to see the ponds and lakes below with Katahdin in the background.
    Spirit and Tangles showed up as Tejas and I were basking in the moment. We all hung out and enjoyed the spectacular views. If you remember from my journal entry months ago, the first day I met Spirit, she was traveling the wrong way on the trail, and I could not convince her that she was going the wrong direction.
    Tangles was kind enough to share her video of her fall in Mahoosuc Notch with me that I journaled about. I will share it so you can see how close she came to major injury. She is doing great now and should summit one day before us.
    Once we were ready to hike on, Tejas left first, he wanted to get a head start down the long descent, as I am faster going downhill, and he knew I should catch back up after a few minutes. I left the view area with tangles, and Spirit wanted to stay to be lost in her phone because of the cell signal.
    I started slowing down so as not to crowd Tangles and give her some space. That’s when I felt the same pain in my left hamstring that I felt at the end of the hike yesterday. It concerned me since I had not have any trouble with that body part at any other time on the trail. I had injured my right hamstring 6 years ago and knew how painful the recover was.
    I dropped my pack to grab some ibuprofen. After quickly downing the meds, I saddled up and looked for the white blaze. It was directly in front of me, and I pushed on with the concerns of this new pain. The pain persisted as I kept a steady pace down the mountain. I had plans to let Tejas know I would be cutting back on my speed for the rest of the day.
    As I reached the bottom, I knew that I should be catching Tejas and second.
     That is when I saw a familiar cowboy hat. It was Jet Pack. She was coming up the trail directly toward me. My first thought was why is she hiking south? Is she slack packing? How could she even do that in the 100 mile wilderness? It was a great thing that I saw her, that’s because I was going south, not her! I had passed 3 other hikers as I travelled in the wrong direction, but since I did not know them, I had no reason to ask them which direction were they hiking? If I had not seen her, I would have gone all the way back to the shelter I started from.
    My heart sank. How could I have made such a blunder? The timing could not have been worse, with this new pain that was killing me. And to make matters even more complicated, my nerves being shot full of holes made my stomach even more upset and I had to make a restroom break in the woods. I had to suck it up, turn around, and start heading back up the thousand foot climb again,m. And at this point Tejas was way ahead of me and I had no way to communicate to him.
    The hamstring continued to worsen. It began to spread farther down my leg to the rear of my knee and my calf. I had made it up the climb and was now on the way down the correct side. I saw exactly where I made my mistake, and now I was living the consequences. That is when I broke. I not only was concerned that today was now an extremely difficult day, but now I feared this relentless pain was a potential show stopper. Fear gripped me… could this stop my hike? This close, 3 and a half days from the summit? Why is this pain hitting me now? I have been doing less miles the last few days and going slower.
    I had only one place to turn as I wiped the trail dust storm from my eyes, The Lord Jesus. I need help, bad! I had to turn all my fears over to him. At the time, the pain seemed bad enough that I would have to stop walking any second. Could this really be happening again? I have been haunted by defeats in my past that had broken me into pieces. Please give me the strength to take another step.
    He did, he gave me peace. The pain was still there, but not the anxiety. The strength to get up and down the hills did not fade. The roots and the rocks passed by as the miles did also.
    The irony of the situation was that 3 days before, I had planned to come along side of Tejas to pray for him to have strength if his struggles got him too far down. I was praying for him as he hiked as I know that some of you did the same. Today, he was rolling. He thought somehow that I had gotten ahead of him since I never caught up. So, he was hiking even faster to catch me.
    He had stopped at the spot I hoped he would, the place where it would be best to shorten the day. It was 3 miles shorter that our original plan, but it would be the best place for me to heal. I did not want to push any father. The problem was he did not find me there, so he was convinced I had continued to the spot 3 mile ahead. So he decided to wait there for 45 minutes, if Zey, his son, did not show up, he would move on up the trail.
    Since I had a invisible strength to keep taking steps, I decided to skip my lunch break when a SOBO (south bounder) told me that Tejas was about 45 minutes ahead of me. I made it to the campsite where Tejas was waiting just 10 minutes before he was going to leave. Thank you Lord.
    Quadzilla arrived about 30 minutes later, he did not see us and was going to push on, but he let out his signature bird call just to check. We both returned the call the best we could copy it. He happily bounced up the trail to greet us. We were suprise do he did not see the sign we have laid out by the trail to alert their attention. It was made out of roots and sticks.
    Quad put his hiking poles next to the sign to make sure that Zey saw it, but Tejas made sure to hang by the trail to catch him 15 minutes later. It all came together as Quad made a huge fire in the rock fire pit.
    Quadzilla is also a licensed physical therapist in France. He worked with me to help me with my hamstring after we finished our dinners. I am very optimistic that I will have a better day tomorrow. But for tonight, I have been resting it. Quad also help Tejas with his foot.
    The 6th day of the 100 mile wilderness was a red letter day for me. I am finishing up this journal as rain drops are hitting my tent.

    We all were excited, so everyone was up early. At 5:30 am, the moose calling out in the distance was as clear as a rooster’s wake up call. It had rained most of the night, but I was thankful when it stopped at 5.
    Tejas and I hiked out a few minutes before 7:00. The trail was much like we had seen throughout Maine, roots and rocks, or boulders to step over or around. We also had beautiful ponds and a good view of Katahdin. We had a few ups and downs, but no large climbs.
    Everyone we talked to was tired and ready to be at the end of the 100 Mile Wilderness. At the top of our largest hill for the morning, Zey and Quadzilla caught up with us. We visited for a couple of minutes, then they pushed ahead. They knew a camp store was waiting at the Abol Bridge.
    The bridge is nothing special, just a one lane passage over a small river. They have a pedestrian bridge that runs beside it for the hikers. It may not be special, but it is a huge milestone for all NOBOs. (Northbound Thru-Hikers). Everyone breaths a sigh of relief once you cross out of the Wilderness.
    We checked in to the campground here for the night. We will tent camp, shower, do laundry, and buy enough food to hold us for a day and a half. Tomorrow morning is the big question mark for us. The question is where will we spend the night before our summit attempt on the 8th?
   The whole Thru-hiker entry into Baxter State park is crazy. I won’t spend much time complaining, but I will say it makes everyone nervous about where you will stay and how do you understand what you need to do to be ready to hike up Katahdin. I will fill you in on more details of what we had to do in tomorrow’s post.
    The small country store got plenty of our business. We heard that rain was coming around 3:30, and did it. It was a drenching thunder storm. Quadzilla’s tent got flooded, and he had to move it. I was stuck in the shower building for about a hour. Then all 4 of us moved to laundry shed for a couple of hours and hung out while it continued to pour. The forecast was to stop raining about 7:00 pm.
    I was back in my tent around 7:15, and started cleaning up the water that had invaded my floor during the storm. It was better than I thought it would be. I was asleep by 8:30. Big day tomorrow.

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643795,"We had done the math. Only 12 Thru-Hikers are allowed to stay at the Birches Campsite. You get permission to stay there by signing up at 7:00 am the morning you will be hiking the almost 10 miles to the campsite. You can’t reserve a spot. The clipboard to sign up on is hand delivered by a park ranger or ridge runner.
    The math was at least 20 hikers were ready to sign up, but only 12 spots. The ones who don’t make the cut will not know where they will stay. So, you guessed it, everyone wants to get to the clipboard first to insure they have a place to sleep next to the beginning of the Katahdin Mountain Climb. It is unorganized chaos. We had a plan to make certain to be in the 12. My alarm was set for 2:40 am.
    Yonder, a hiker I didn’t know, was number 1, Tejas and I were 2 & 3 at 3:30 am. Quadzilla and Zey were 7 & 8. Number 12 showed up at 5:25 am. Teach was number 13 at 5:45. So, he did not make the cut. The Dude made it to the waiting game at 6:30, but he was number 20. Piece Foot was no where to be seen when the Ridge Runner showed up to let us sign in on the clipboard from the 1980’s.
    The whole process puts stress onto everyone’s plate. The Dude was demoralized, you could see it in his face. All the hikers from 13-20 did not know what to do. We tried to reassure them that the Rangers would try to help them find a place to camp tonight. They did, and eventually after 30 minutes of agony, the hikers without a home, found out they could stay at a campsite that was available at another area. They would all have to squeeze their tents onto the one site. All was good again, and everyone could breath a sigh of relief.
    We went back to the Abol Bridge Camp store for breakfast after we were signed in. We had a good breakfast with biscuits and gravy. I tried to use the store’s pay by the minute Wi-Fi to load my journal and Facebook. It was so slow and wouldn’t load up any videos or pictures. It was a waste of money and my time.
    Because I had wasted time trying to update my journals, Tejas was about an hour ahead of me. I hiked along beautiful streams and waterfalls. We were told the trail terrain would be easy, but after the the first 2 miles, it was mostly roots and rocky. I knew we were getting close to a park because I started to see day hikers. I had not seen any day hikers sine before we started the 100 mile wilderness.
    The most interesting experience today happened to Tejas as he hiked alone. We had all been wishing to see Moose. His wish came true in a big way. As he worked his way north, he came upon a young moose, his cow mom, and the large bull moose father. Tejas walked behind the bull moose for awhile videoing him. Eventually, the bull had enough, and turned to stare down his pursuer.
    Then, the bull moose desired to become the pursue. Tejas knew he was in trouble when the moose let loose his pee on the ground, then pawed his hoof. After a few seconds, he began to charge Tejas. Our friend was in the deep woods by himself. A seven foot tall bull moose barreling downs on him. Tejas took cover behind 2 trees and a rock, and the moose turned and walked away satisfied. But he had gotten as close as 8 feet from Tejas. Most of this event was captured on video by my friend. Believe me when I tell you, it was close. I will try to share a part of the video when I get some service.
    As I finished my hike up to the Birches, I had no idea what had happened to Tejas, but he would fill me in later. I headed to the Ranger station to get checked in, and get permission to summit Katahdin tomorrow morning. As I was talking to the Ranger, I saw my wife’s SUV drive past to the parking area… Backwoods was here!
    I cut my conversation short as I excused myself to go see my beautiful wife. As I was hurriedly walking to the vehicle, I could see she had a passenger. I was concussed, who would have come to Baxter with her? As I drew near, I realized it was Quadzilla! He had come off the trail at a place where you must road walk for a short distance. He saw her driving and recognized her from the pictures I had shown him. He stopped her and got in.
    I had been working with Backwoods for days to see if we could get her into the park this afternoon to meet up with us. It worked to perfection! Right after she parked with Quad, Zey came off the trail. After we greeted, and I had gotten a. Pulls of kisses, she opened the tailgate to show us the feast of trail magic she had for us. Two large pizzas, fresh baked brownies, chocolate chip cookies, and no bake cookies (my favorite), plus drinks.
    I had not seen Tejas yet, so I told everyone to get started, and I would go to the campsite and find him. When I got here, I yelled for him, but no answer. I asked 2 hikers, that were setting up their tents, if they had seen him. They ask me if Tejas was a person? That answered my question. I was about ready to give up, then I saw what I thought was his tent. I walked to it, and saw him sound asleep. It took me a couple of tries to wake him, but he was excited to here about pizza. As we walked beck to the Ranger Station area, he showed me the video about the Moose.
    We all were stuffed from Backwoods trail magic and were able to share with many other hikers. The cool thing was Piece Foot and the Dude came up and got to hug Backwoods and eat also. What a wonderful blessing. We coordinated our plans to meet in the morning as Backwoods will be back at 6:30 am to meet us to attempt to summit with us. We are all excited. Quadzilla did a great job helping to reassure Backwoods that she could do it and we all will help her.
    Backwoods headed back to Millinocket, ME. She will spend the night there tonight. But not before she got here scissors out and gave us a touch up trim. She drove up from Kentucky over the last 3 days to be here. Man was I happy to see her after 3 months.
    We all had a wonderful time around the campfire, sharing stories, and roasting hotdogs. Tejas’s video was a big hit! It was a huge blessing that he was not hit big! I am recording this journal as my last one from the confines of my tent in the forest. I am well aware of the journey’s final exhale that dissipates in the assent tomorrow.

beavER & Backwoods Barbie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643829,"All four of us were up early. Everyone’s adrenaline level had to be at max. Our plans were to be back at the Ranger station area to meet Backwoods at 6:15. We all were there ahead of time. We picked a pavilion that was close to the parking lot where she would park. We all set at the picnic table and enjoyed our last trail breakfast together.
    I was so happy to see my beautiful wife pull up in the SUV. I knew she would be nervous. The hike up Katahdin is the toughest climb of the whole AT. She had told Quadzilla the day before she was worried is she could handle the challenge. We would be a ascending  4,180 ft. to reach the summit. I knew we could work together and I would help her through the hard parts. Quad had done his best to reassure her that she could handle it.
    We all marveled in the fact that our plans had worked out so well. The day we picked to summit was the best we could have chosen. Yesterday was not a clear day on the mountain, and was so windy and cold at the top, the hikers got off the summit as quick as possible. Today was clear and sunny at lower elevations. All of us were giddy as we hiked.
    The trail was easy at the beginning, and I was so thankful that Backwoods was writing this final chapter of my adventure with me. As we went up in elevation, so did the difficulty. I was so proud of Backwoods, as she dug in an kept taking steps. It was not long before were were climbing up over boulders using our arms and hands to pull our way higher. The views were Maine at her best.
    Eventually we trekked above the tree line. From here to the top of the Gateway (a rocky walk on the Tablelands), the trail climbs steeply on an exposed ridge with technical climbing and gorgeous views. We felt like we were on top of the world. But definitely not a place for someone with a fear of heights. As you look ahead you see the trail going straight up, and dotted with small figurines, that are the hikers ahead of you. This is where you reach down into your inner strength, you find the hidden fuel to propel you onward.
    Once you are above the gauntlet of exposed boulders, you reach the Gateway. This flat-ish rock walk gave us a sense of euphoria. I let out a few war whoops. At this point of the climb, it felt as if a huge burden was lifted off my shoulders. From this point, your eyes communicate to your brain that your on the last lap. Then your heart begins to take control. We began to celebrate the victory that awaits, now it is clear that it is within your grasp.
    I went from enthusiastic joy, to getting trail dust in my eyes as I realized the goal was materializing. I quickly composed myself, as I knew one slip up on the rocky pathway, would cause much pain. From this less steep Tablelands, we still had a demanding 1.6 miles and 750 foot elevation rise to reach the AT’s northern terminus. This last section was a demanding rock/ boulder hop all the way to the peak.
    My mind wanted to be at the end as soon as I had reached the Gateway, but we had to earn it! The last mile was both grueling and rewarding. I had two major thoughts as I traversed this no man’s land of high and cold winds. One, the closer I get to the prize, the harder it seems to get! Two, I am actually going to make it, and I am enjoying the craziness!
    As it became more misty and cold, I looked up made out a figure in the grayish haze that engulfed the mountain. That figure was Zey posing on the wooden frame that holds the infamous Katahdin Summit sign. I forgot all about dropping to my knees, and thanking the Lord, as I had pictured myself doing. As Backwoods and I moved closer to the picture spot, I was overwhelmed with emotions. I let out a few more yells, and the celebration was now full throttle.
    We all took turns getting just the correct picture, and of course, I had to do one crazy one. Somewhere in the quiet moments that followed, I found myself in the middle of a trail dust storm. It only lasted a few seconds, then I composed myself and began to prepare for the return to the valley below.
    We loaded up our lifetime of memories, and departed from the “winners circle”. The pathway down from the summit took us on the Abol Slide trail. It was steep and treacherous. Many places we had to slide on our rear ends, as it was too large of a drop to stay on your feet. Backwoods excepted the difficult and scary terrain, and kept her mind focused on the task of making every step not your last. The trail finally did level out after hours of pounding our legs and feet. At the end of the descent, all we felt was total exhaustion and pain in every muscle.
    I had accomplished the goal. Fate had not played a heartless trick on me, and snatched the prize from my hands. Yes, the desire of my heart for the last 10 years, has been granted to me. Thank you Lord Jesus Christ.

Reflection of my Thru-Hike


    My heart’s desire for the hike was to be an adventure of fulfillment. I sought friendships that would endure for years to come. For experiences to capture and hold captive my memories, overflowing with incredible views and landscapes.
    I wished to push myself beyond physical  boundaries that could only be conquered with sweat and perseverance. And to embrace the weather’s unleashed fury.
    I wanted to strengthen my walk with the Lord as I enjoyed the miles of quiet solitude as I traversed the forest. I also wanted to share my Faith in love with those who wanted to hear about my experiences.
    The nearly 2,200 miles covering the Appalachian Mountains in 14 states met all my hopes head on. Looking back on the journey, it exceeded all dreams of what awaited beyond the pavement.
    My journal entries were meant to enlighten the readers to the paths of the trail as well as the people who trekked along with me. I wished to be myself as much as my limited writing abilities would allow.
    I realize now that I should have kept my journal entries going for at least a week after finishing Katahdyn. Many things happened after the hike that I could not control. Here are a few that stick out in my memory….
    As soon as we finished the hike, our plans were impacted by Covid. At the Ranger station at the base of the final decent, everyone was being tested for the virus. It was due to the outbreak at Shaws Hostel back in Monson, ME. Backwoods and I tested negative, but other hikers were positive. We had to change or plans of where to stay.
    That night, I awoke with a bathroom urge. As I began my motion to the hotel bathroom, I felt a sharp pain in my left ankle. I had to grab furniture and use the wall for support to make it. Once the light was on, I saw my problem. My ankle was twice the normal size. I could not walk on it. I literally physically collapsed at the finish line of the trail. My ankle had not given me any trouble at all since I twisted it in my scary fall in Mahoosuc Notch. But it was toast.
    The day after our summit, I was at Urgent Treatment getting an air brace, crutches, an anti-inflammatory shot. I was not able to walk on it for three days. We did run into Manners, the Ky. thru-hiker from Lexington in the hotel hallway. I had met August 10. One of Backwoods customers, had ask if I had seen him on the trail, as she knew him. Now, BWB was meeting him face to face. He is such a nice young man, I see how he was given his trail name. 
    Backwoods and I drove my beloved Tramily (trail family) back to Monson. That is where Tejas’ truck was parked. We parted ways there. Backwoods took a great picture of us all wearing Kentucky shirts that she brought as gifts. One of my best friends that pulls for another team said Quadzilla did not know any better since he is from France. But, Zey and Tejas have no excuses being Texas guys… I love that pic!
    After Backwoods and I left my buds at Monson, we spent the next week touring Maine and enjoying the trip back home. We spent a few days in Bar Harbor. 
    My hiking mentor, Shock Top, told me about how hard the post hike pain would be. I did not believe her fully when she said for the first 6 weeks, she could not get off the couch because of the aches. Wow was she right!
    Backwoods and I both had 2 more Covid tests over the next 20 days to make sure we were good.
    We met 2 fellow Kentucky AT hikers, Birdie & Starburst, last week at Red River Gorge. They finished a few weeks before me. As we talked, we realized they had hiked with Steak. Steak was one of the first hikers I had befriended on the trail. I sent him a selfie of us 3 together.
    Not too far in the future, I hope to travel to Virginia to visit Colonel, and to Texas to visit Tejas and Zey. I miss them.
    What a glorious gift was handed to me by God Almighty. I did not deserve this life changing adventure, but I will be every grateful. Thank you from the depths of my soul for following and walking with me.
