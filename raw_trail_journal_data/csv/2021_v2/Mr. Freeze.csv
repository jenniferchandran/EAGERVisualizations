Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632145,"Good luck to all the early starters.  A common item in many videos listing the top mistakes on the AT is starting too early.  I selected Feb 1 to get ahead of the bubble and to hopefully complete my journey prior to a mid-July family reunion in New Hampshire near the White Mountains.  Starting early creates many additional challenges to overcome: cold, snow, ice, increased potential for injury from slips and falls, heavier pack, and hitting the northern states during the height of the black fly season.  COVID-19 complications include closure of multiple Shelters, less support businesses and services along the trail, and limited services from the AT Conservancy. Personally, I also have the unfortunate situation of Raynauds condition.  I’m going for it anyway.  I’m retiring at the end of January and don’t want to wait anymore.
I’ve got nearly all my gear, made most of my travel arrangements, read multiple books, followed early starters on Trail Journals for the last five years, watched hundreds of YouTube videos, read Appalachian Trials 3 times, and most importantly - I have support from my wife to leave her home alone for 5 to 6 months while I take on this challenge.  There’s no way I could attempt this adventure, let alone complete it, without her having my back.  I’m truly blessed.",,View Entry,"Jan 01, Fri",0
Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632178,"It's impossible to simulate the AT conditions up here in Northwest Ohio.  It's about as flat as can be - and I refuse to train on our treadmill set at a high incline.  It's not the same and it bores me to tears even with the tv on.  There are a couple of places within 90 minutes that I have been periodically going to over the last couple of months that give me a break from the short 3 miles (or less) loop trails near my home.  Oak Openings Metro Park has a 15+ mile Scout Trail loop that I've completed several times while wearing a weighted day-pack.  The other trail is a bit farther and that's the point-to-point Waterloo-Pinckney trail northwest of Ann Arbor.  I like that trail because it's around 36 miles long with many parking areas along the route which allows me to vary the route on a given day.  To get hill training in, I have to rely on the Maumee Bay State Park sledding hill. It's only a 100 foot climb or so, but at least it has 3 different ways to ascend it so I don't have to just go up and down the same trek over and over.  It is very tedious however.  I'm lucky to have it so close to my house at least.  The hardest trail I've ever done so far is the Shawnee State Park backpacking trail near the Ohio river - but it's a 4.5 hour drive to get there.  There are some brutal climbs, and it consists of 3 connected loops for a total of over 43 to 44 miles when I did the perimeter over 3 days back in early December.  The weather has been good - but I'm forcing myself to hike in the cold rain and snow - but that has been few and far between.  I know what the weather is going to be in February and March in GA, NC, and TN and I need to be mentally ready and have my gear dialed in.
I thought I was set with all my gear since my new Oboz boots were ordered and supposed to arrive today.  Then - while finishing up yesterday's hike, a trekking pole snapped just as I was finishing.  They're an older model of aluminum Black Diamond Alpine FLZ with cork grips and I love them.  Now I have to drop another bunch of $$$ to get new ones and hope they arrive soon before I leave.  I have read too many horror stories about carbon poles so I'm willing to sacrifice the weight for strength.  I rely heavily on them to assist with climbs and descents.",,View Entry,"Jan 05, Tue",0
Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632206,"I have most of my travel arrangements set to start hiking on Monday February 1.  I've reserved a 1-way rental through Enterprise to Jasper, GA.  However, I still need to find a ride to Amiacalola Falls State Park from there.  I have a room reserved in the lodge for Sunday night and I'm really looking forward to that.  I'll start looking into the shuttle options listed in Guthook and the AWOL guidebook.  Plan is to do the Approach Trail first thing Monday morning after the Visitor Center opens.
Another task is to get a Smokey Mountain Backcountry permit.  I'm not sure where I can get access to a printer or what is needed to do that - so my tentative plan is to do that on Friday January 30.  Hopefully I'll get through the Smokey's before it expires after 38 days.  I'm struggling to find out if any of the services at Fontana Dam Village are still open - if not, I'll have to resupply for the Smokey's before that - which means a heavier load for an extra day.",,View Entry,"Jan 08, Fri",0
Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632471,"2 miles hiked.  0 AT miles. 1 mile of the Approach Trail.  38 degrees, light misty rain.


Checked in at the Amicalola Falls State Park Visitor Center and was surprised to find out that I’m thru-hiker number 40 for 2021.  Seems low - I’m guessing a lot of people ahead of me didn’t check in this year due to the AT Conservancy restrictions.  The plan today was to leisurely hike the first mile of the Approach Trail up the falls and then back to my rental car via the East Ridge Trail.  I held up the start time until around 11 am when the misty rain finally subsided since I had all day to hike 2 miles.  It was a slow and enjoyable hike up the falls - except the fog made it impossible to get good photos.  


After returning the rental car in Jasper, Richard Anderson (listed in AWOL) picked me up for the ride back to the lodge where I’ll do the rest of the Approach Trail up to Springer tomorrow and then on to the AT. It’s supposed to snow tonight and tomorrow with a high of 31 with 20 - 30 mile winds. Sounds like fun!",,View Entry,"Jan 31, Sun",0
Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632498,"For the day, 12.2 total miles, 4.4 AT miles.
I had to wait until 8 am for the Maple Restaurant at the lodge to open, but the Pecan Pancakes were calling.  
 I consider a day as a success if I learn something - and today was a bonus because I learned 2 things.  First, I can train for the cold, I can train for the snow, I can train for the wind, and I can (sort of) train for the climbs and descents.  However, there was no way to train for what I experienced today.  I learned there’s just no way to train for it if all four occur at the same time.  The winds on the Approach trail were gusting to 40 mph at times and there was (and still as I’m sitting in my tent) a steady 25 - 30 mph all day long.  I feel good about that however, because I felt like I got through it ok.  I’d love to build a fire at my campsite since I got to Three Forks around 3:30 and ate dinner by 5 (too cold and windy to stop for lunch). Not much else to do. The wind and damp forest make that too difficult. The other thing I learned is that I’d trade the extra weight in my pack for cold weather gear any day.


I wanted to hike fast to stay warm but made myself hold a steady and fairly even pace throughout the day.  I have to keep reminding myself that speed causes injury - especially for a 60 year-old.


Lastly, I already knew this from videos, journals, and books, but hikers and backpackers are an extremely friendly group of people.  It didn’t matter today if they were day hikers, section hikers, or thru-hikers.  Everyone was extremely kind and interesting to talk to - even if it was for a short time.  Specifically, I hiked about an hour on the Approach Trail with 2008 thru-hiker Blue Sky.  He lives nearby in Dawsonville and had a lot of stories and good advice.  I didn’t have a lot of time with Evergreen (started today heading for Maine), but he was a nice guy who I probably won’t see again (unless he zeroes).  He is younger and a fast hiker.  The other interesting guy I met was Ferrel (not sure of spelling).  He is solo hiking south on the trail but is a NOBO.  He’s from D.C. but has 2 cars and drives north with one car and hikes south to his other - alternating cars.  Hike your own hike.
I also had the pleasure of running into Shutterbug and Cuppa Tea on the Approach Trail.  They had to leave the trail last year due to the virus.


I don’t know when this entry will be posted, because there’s no cell service here at Forest Service Road 58.


I promise I’ll try not to make such long entries in the future, but like I said above, I’m sitting in my tent trying to stay warm and I’m bored.","Amicalola Falls Lodge

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632525,"Between the howling wind and flowing creek, I don’t think I slept more than a few hours last night (Monday).  It got down to 21 with a steady roaring wind.  It was slow getting out of the tent this morning, but I was finally packed up and on the trail shortly before 9.  It was still cold and windy and the trail had a dusting of snow-covered frozen ground with no footprints. The trail then went up Sassafras Mountain for the first difficult climb of the trip and it was no joke.  There was no reprieve on the way down because the wind was whipping off the mountain at gusts of 30 to 40 mph and caused a wind chill probably in the single digits.  I was forced to use a set of hand warmers due to no feeling in my fingertips.  It wasn’t 10  minutes when the trail turned to another side of the mountain and the sun was shining with very little wind. The final 2 miles to Gooch Gap shelter were fantastic.  If I wasn’t so lazy and so close to the shelter, I would have stripped off a layer to avoid sweating. 
I met up with Rookie from Dawsonville and L0ngterm (with a zero) from Nashville at the shelter.  They started on Feb 1 as well, but didn’t do the Approach Trail.  They stayed in the shelter, but I opted to tent.  I’m trying to plan the next couple of days so I can get a cabin at Neels Gap on Thursday night since it’s supposed to rain.  It means 1 short day and 1 long, or 2 medium days.  I think it will depend on the weather and how my knee is holding out.


 I need to resist the temptation every day to hike fast and accept that an 8 to 12 mile day in the north Georgia mountains in the snow and freezing wind is ok. It’s difficult to get it through my head that I can’t compare my progress to any hikes I’ve done before.","Three Forks
",Gooch Mountain Shelter,"Feb 02, Tue",11.30
Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632526,"Upper20s. Sun. No snow.  The kind of day I pictured when planning to hike the AT.  
Today was to be a shorter day with only a couple of short climbs (compared to yesterday) so I took my time getting ready.  I slept better, but still not great.  A warm bed at Blood Mountain Cabins on Thursday night was on my mind.  Come to think of it, I don’t know when hiker hunger kicks in, but I certainly don’t feel it yet.


 It was still only around 30 for most of the day, but it felt phenomenal.  There were some great views from Ramrock Mountain and Big Cedar Mountain - finally.


I was feeling good, moving steady and fairly slowly since I had all day to do 8.3 miles.  I even took a 45 minute lunch break at Woody Gap.


I hiked with Rookie on and off and was passed by Evergreen during the day while taking pictures.  The plan is for the 3 of us and L0ngterm (who stopped after 5 miles at Woody Gap for a shuttle) to split a cabin tomorrow night to stay out of the rain.


Hopefully it’s nothing, but I started to feel some pain in my good knee when setting up camp at Lance Creek.  Ugh - I felt great all day.  Well, I have no options because the first thing I’m facing tomorrow is the 4442 ft Blood Mountain.Otherwise, feeling good.","Gooch Mountain Shelter
",Lance Creek Campsite,"Feb 03, Wed",8.30
Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632529,"Today’s hike was basically a climb up to Blood Mountain (highest AT point in Georgia), and back down again into Neel Gap.  That meant another fairly short day (7.4 miles), pizza and a warm bed.  The day started with an immediate climb right as i left the Lanse Creek campsites.  Shortly thereafter, I met two more of the Feb 1 starting thru-hikers Charlie and Lydia (Athens Ohio).  We leap-frogged each other a few times on our way to Blood Mountain.  I owe them because the last time I passed them (right before the final steep push up the mountain), I wasn’t paying attention and Lydia saved me from going down a side trail instead of following the AT.  The main trail actually makes a sharp right and starts the final steep climb up Blood Mountain. 


When I finally reached the summit, I was blessed with a clear view on all sides.  The only other hiker up there happened to be Evergreen.


Going up was difficult and mostly snow-covered, but not too bad.  Going down the mountain was downright dangerous.  I admit being terrified in a couple places because it was nothing but ice-covered rocks and boulders.  I can’t believe the general public was allowed up there today with conditions like that.  It was very slow going but finally safely reached the Georgia AT hikers’ oasis (Neel Gap and Mountain Crossing).  After buying a few necessary hiking items at Mountain Crossing, I contacted Blood Mountain Cabins to check availability.   For a total of $72, me, Rookie, and Evergreen split a cabin. That includes laundry and a satellite tv that didn’t work due to the windy weather.  It’s supposed to rain tonight so we’ll find out if it was the right decision. I’m actually writing this lying in bed - and for the first time this trip, without freezing fingers.","Lanse Creek Campsites
",Neel Gap,"Feb 04, Thu",7.40
Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632543,"I was worried this morning.  The short walk from Stone Mountain cabins to Mountain Crossings Outfitters felt a little sluggish.  An 850 foot climb was the first thing we faced this morning after walking under the Mountain Crossing walkway - and it did a nice job waking me up.  The sun was shining with a few clouds and it was supposed to reach the upper 30s and possibly 40 today.  The goal was to hike 11.5 miles to Low Gap Shelter.  Then a 9.7 mile day on Saturday to Unicoi Gap and hitch a ride to Hiawassee.  Then, possibly a zero on Sunday and watch the Super Bowl (and have a local craft beer or two hopefully).


There were numerous views today.  So many that I’m embarrassed to admit I didn’t even stop to take photos at some.  After the initial climb up Levelland Mountain, I was treated to multiple picturesque views for the next 4 or 5 miles.  Hiking the AT in January and February has downsides - however, we’re treated with unobstructed scenery that the spring hikers don’t experience.


I felt really good and was moving pretty steadily over the rocky trails- both ups and downs, and making pretty good time without pushing it too much. And then - Wildcat Mountain.  It’s more than a 500 foot climb in a half mile.  That was really tough.  As I reached the top, Charlie and Lydia were sitting on a large sunny rock eating lunch with a beautiful landscape overlook.  I didn’t want to bother them, so I pushed on even though I could have used a break myself.  The trail wasn’t too hard from there to Hogpen Gap.  It was very muddy today as well - but I’ll take that over ice any day.


Since I was feeling good, I decided to push on past Low Gap Shelter and stay at Poplar Stamp Gap campsite another 1.4 miles away.  My logic was: I’m feeling good, it’s a beautiful day, the trail wasn’t too difficult in this stretch, and I’ll have more time in town tomorrow.  Just before arriving to the campsite, the wind picked up and the temperature dropped what seemed like 10 degrees.  It really whips in the gaps.  Evergreen was with me at this point and neither of us wanted to face that all night - so we threw the dice and moved on.  According to Guthooks App and AWOL, there isn’t another dedicated camping spot for the next 6 miles - and that shelter is on the top of Blue Mountain.  We were willing to risk it and kept going.  As thru-hikers say, “the trail provides”.  We found a decent spot on a ridge ( still windy, but not as bad) a half mile later.  That means tomorrow should be a reasonably short 7.8 miles.","Neel Gap
",Stealth Camping Location,"Feb 05, Fri",13.40
Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632547,"I’m fully aware of the AT thru-hiker slogan: “No Rain, No Paine, No Maine”.  So far I’ve been extremely lucky.  It rained Thursday night during my stay at the cabins at Neel Gap, but not while hiking.  Except for a little knee pain from time to time, I’ve felt pretty good.  Well, the forecast for today was freezing rain this afternoon and tomorrow (Sunday).  That clinched the decision to get to Hiawasee today and take a zero tomorrow and watch the Super Bowl.  Even though I felt good today after the 13+ yesterday, my body can use a rest. I know my luck will run out soon enough with both the rain and pain.


I got up this morning shortly after 6 to get an early start.  The only problem is I’m slower than crap getting on the trail in the morning - especially if I want to have coffee and/or oatmeal and if I had to hang my food bag.  Evergreen was up, packed up and off at 7:15 and I think he was taking his time.  I didn’t get out for another 15 minutes after that.  


Today’s weather was good again and the trail was not too tough compared to some of the other days.   There were a few difficult patches of rock hopping going up and going down the mountainside however.  I made good time and arrived at Unicoi Gap just before 11.  Evergreen had waited for me so we could hitchhike to Hiawasee.   After about 30 minutes and several rejections, a hiker (Atticus) who was at the gap filming the intro for his YouTube video (starting AT on March 15) offered to take us to town - even though he and his wife lived the other way.  As I got in the car, I was greeted by two friendly dachshunds, Linus and Lucy, and his wife Barbara.  They were extremely nice people and we had an interesting conversation on the way to town.  Thanks Atticus and Barbara - it was awesome meeting you!  Good luck on your March thru-hike.


I received a text this afternoon from Rookie, his Section Hike to Unicoi Gap finished today and he was able to beat the freezing rain.  Since I’m taking tomorrow off, I’m not sure if I’m going to make an entry or not. Maybe I’ll discuss one of the multiple random thoughts that I have while hiking during the day.


PS: The tv in my Budget Inn room doesn’t work.  That’s 0 for 2.  It must be me.","Stealth Campsite Location
",Unicoi Gap,"Feb 06, Sat",7.80
Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632577,"Wow - forecast for today was supposed to be freezing rain.  I woke up to 30 degrees (in Hiawasee) and a sunny sky.  It was instant guilt for taking a zero today.  My mileage is not what I wanted so far so I feel the need to up the numbers coming out of Unicoi Gap - but I really should take a zero first.  The Super Bowl was another good excuse to offset the guilt.  As I always say when trying to start a diet: “I’ll start on Monday”.  Hopefully this time I’ll actually come through with my commitment.


THE MOST IMPORTANT THING OF THE DAY. Our move to the Holiday Inn Express yielded a room WITH A WORKING TV!!!  I’m now 1 for 3.  Honestly though, It’s probably because Evergreen was the one to book the room.


I booked a shuttle back to the gap tomorrow morning for 8 am through Michelle.  She offered a fair price and told me no pickup time is too early even though it’s a 35 minute drive to get here.  Customer First - gotta appreciate that.


Almost time for the Super Bowl - this 6 hour pregame is ridiculous.  I’m now almost too tired to watch the game.
PS. Rather than figure out where I messed up the mileage to Unicoi Gap by 1/10th, I just entered a negative 0.1 for today - and it worked!  The total miles to Unicoi Gap should be 52.5.","Hiawasee Hotel A

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632603,"Shuttle driver Michelle dropped us off at Unicoi Gap around 8:30 am.  It was a sunny cool morning with a possible high of 40.  Well - that didn’t happen, but it did get into the mid 30s and the sun was shining all day today.  Amazing weather so far (after the first two days). Lots of walking on ridges and there was beautiful scenery both to my right and left several times today.  We had three fairly major climbs today and multiple smaller and medium ones.  Almost the entire hike today was in 3 to 6 inches of snow.  The trail up the first mountain (Rocky) was crunchy snow and ice - and fairly steep.  The second climb up Tray Mountain was in deeper slushy snow.  It was a long climb, but I believe offered the best views of the trip so far.  The third major climb of the day (Kelly Knob) was half snow covered and half dirt and pine needles due to getting a lot sun in some areas.  It was the most difficult for me, partly due to being 1 mile straight up with no switchbacks and no short flat areas to provide a short break.  Also because it was the third climb of the day.  I felt the impact of last nights pizza on that one.


Evergreen and I leap frogged a few times today, but like usual, we ended up together at days end.  We hike in two totally different methods, but end up with a similar total for the day.  He’s the hare and I’m the tortoise.  Small world note.  He lives in Fort Gratiot, Michigan.  I have two different relatives (different sides of my family) that live there.


I planned on camping near a water stream on the way down to Dick’s Creek Gap, but I didn’t see anywhere suitable.  My decision was based on comments in The Guthooks App but it didn’t work out.  We ended up camping just south of Route 76 at Dick’s Creek Gap and fairly close to the road.  Lots of noise tonight I’m afraid.  It will be an earplugs night.


Saw no other thru or section hikers today.
Rain is coming!","Unicoi Gap
",Dick’s Creek Gap,"Feb 08, Mon",16.70
Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632604,"I set a new record and was on the trail by 7:15am.  Evergreen was gone by 7.  Of course, it’s an immediate climb out of Dick’s Creek Gap.  It was fairly steep at first, but then got a little more gradual the rest of the way up the first ascent.  It rained for 2 to 3 hours in the morning and the trail was complete slush and wet snow for most of the day.  My waterproof Oboz appeared to do enough to keep my feet fairly dry, but more importantly, they stayed warm.


With just a mile left in Georgia, I was thinking it was going to be easy.  Not.  Georgia kicks you in the nuts and spits on you as you leave with a couple of decent climbs and an uphill exit.  So, NC can’t be as difficult, right?  Well, shortly after entering the state, there are two “Welcome to North Carolina” really steep inclines just to help you get acquainted.


Thoughts on Georgia: it’s the ultimate weed-out state for would-be AT thru-hikers.  It’s not the most difficult state - but it is difficult.  In my opinion, it sets you up (by the time you reach Neel Gap) to decide if this is what you really want to put yourself through.


We did another long day in slush-covered trail and made it to Standing Indian Shelter.  By the way, there were two firsts for me today.  1) I’m staying in a shelter, and 2) I fell today.  My feet slid sideways to the left and I fell on my right side.  Luckily the slope was grass covered and not rocky.  There were LOTS of large snow and ice-covered sharp rocks today.


Due to rain and fog, no scenery at all today until near the end.  Saw some huge mountains in the distance.  Not sure if that’s the Smokeys or not - but I’m getting closer.","Dick’s Creek Gap
",Standing Indian Shelter,"Feb 09, Tue",16.70
Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632620,"The grades up and down Standing Indian Mountain were very kind and we were able to keep a good pace all morning.  After 3 hours of fairly easy hiking, we took a short break at Carter Gap Shelter. Another Feb 1 thru-hiker (Oscar from Arizona) that we hadn’t met before was there.  He was fairly quiet and after he passed us later on, we never saw him again.


We must have crossed a dozen mountainside creeks today.  All but one were easy to cross and I stumbled into the water when my trekking pole got stuck between a couple rocks.  My Oboz waterproof boots came through and kept my foot dry.


I arrived at my goal campsite at 1:15, which is just short of the climb up Albert Mountain.  So, even though I knew 11.5 miles was a good day after two 16.7 mile days, it was much too early to stop.  That meant tackling Albert Mountain.  Part of the way up to the summit was a stretch of ledge walking that was a sheer drop off.  The trail is rocky as well and one slip could mean catastrophe.  No texting and hiking in this section.  If the small trees and shrubs were not there, it would have been a lot more hairy.  Then we went around the corner towards the last climb up to the tower and oh my!!!  The last quarter mile is unlike anything I’ve ever had to do before.  It was nearly straight up and required frequent tossing my trekking poles up to the next level and using both hands to maneuver my way up the large boulders and rocks.  I got a little worried since my center of gravity is not where it normally is.  It was physically exhausting, a bit scary, and fun all at the same time, but led to some great photos up the stairs of the fire tower. We were lucky to have a clear sunny day.  I can’t imagine climbing that rock and having no view due to fog or clouds.


We pushed it to Rock Gap Shelter so tomorrow is a near zero (Nero) day of 3.8 miles where Evergreen and I will find a way to Franklin.  Not sure where we’ll stay, but I’m going to enjoy the short day.  I’m laying in my sleeping bag and am exhausted.","Standing Indian Shelter
",Long Gap Shelter,"Feb 10, Wed",19.70
Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632622,"They didn’t bother us very much, but we could hear the mice scurrying around last night in the shelter.  I don’t think it impacted my inability to sleep.  No matter how tired I am, I can’t seem to fall asleep until very late in the night.  Then it’s constant tossing and turning until dawn.  Hopefully that’ll improve.  


I was on the trail by 8 for the short hike to Winding Stair Gap 3.8 miles away.  It started to rain almost to the second after stepping out from the shelter.  It rained pretty much the entire time - including while trying to hitch a ride (without success) to Franklin.  Luckily we crossed paths with Oscar this morning who had a 10 am shuttle coming from Zen.  Zen agreed to take us to town for a small fee - and also to bring us back tomorrow morning.


After 3 long days, I’m going to enjoy my day out of the rain.","Long Gap Shelter
",Winding Stair Gap,"Feb 11, Thu",3.80
Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632636,"Thanks to Sherpa Al for a ride from Franklin to Winding Stair Gap.  Today was a bad day for me.  Kind of surprising since I had plenty of rest yesterday afternoon and got a decent night sleep.  It rained pretty much all day and there were no views at Siler or Wayah Balds - or anyplace else for that matter.  The fog made it an easy decision to skip the .2 mile each way side trail to the Siler Bald overlook.  I felt terrible all day and had no energy.  I think my pace going up the initial 4 miles to Siler Bald was as slow as I’ve ever walked before.  Then somehow, I got slower going up Wayah Bald.  To top it off, the final 1.2 mile uphill to the Cold Spring Shelter was even slower.  


I was never so glad to see a shelter.  I immediately got out of my damp hiking clothes and into my sleeping clothes.  The problem with Cold Spring Shelter is that it was wet inside.  I don’t think the roof leaked, but at 4920 feet, we’re kind of in a rain cloud.  Evergreen was already there when I got here and Oscar showed up about an hour later.


I crossed paths with Feral for the third time this trip as he hiked south and drives one of his 2 cars north.  The highlight of the day was running into two 2020 SOBOs Mayo and Natgeo.  They should be finishing their hikes in the next week to ten days.  Plan is for a shorter day tomorrow and spend a night at the Nantahala Outdoor Center bunk houses.","Winding Stair Gap
",Cold Spring Shelter,"Feb 12, Fri",15.80
Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632643,"It rained all night and for the first 3 hours of the hike today.  For the first half of the day, the trail was a stream from 1 to 3 inches deep.  At first I tried walking along the outside of the trail to avoid getting my boots wet, but soon just said forget it and walked through it.


I tried to eat and drink more this morning and during the day to up my energy to avoid a repeat of yesterday.  I still didn’t feel great, but better than yesterday.  It helps that there was only one major climb today versus three yesterday.


I learned yesterday and today that as much as l like my Zpacks Arc Haul pack, it isn’t waterproof as advertised.  Also, I need to ditch the cheap Frogg Toggs jacket.  It just wasn’t cutting it.  


The trail today would have provided stunning scenery if not for the fog bank.  The trail past Wesser Bald is along a thin rocky ridge line with great views on either side.  It then goes out to a peninsula where the trail looks like it ends at a cliff.  It actually takes a dramatic u-turn down a rocky face that requires using your hands to navigate your way down.  I think this would be a great day trip on a clear sunny day.


The day ended with a long steep downhill (with several short ups to mess with you) for four miles that ends at the busy Nantahala Outdoor Center.  I immediately  went to their restaurant for a bacon cheeseburger and local craft beer.  Funny, I suddenly felt much better.


Craig and Eileen from Cabins in the Woods picked me and Evergreen up from the N.O.C. And I’ll be staying there for two nights.  They’ll take me back to the N.O.C. in the morning where I’ll hike to Stecoah Gap which is near the cabins. They’ll pick me up there for a second night.  I might even slack pack (leave my heavy stuff in the cabin) tomorrow.  Do I feel guilty for slack packing or spending another night out of the rain?  Absolutely not!","Cold Spring Shelter

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632651,"I started out the day with a huge and delicious homemade breakfast burrito made by Craig at the Cabins In the Woods.  I ate it during the twenty minute ride back to the N.O.C.    I was on the trail by 8 am.  The AT crosses a bridge over the river (1727 feet) and immediately begins the 8.3 mile uphill hike to 5052 feet.  I was feeling good, due to having a full stomach and only a 10 pound pack.  Yep - I’m no longer a purist.  I didn’t pay extra or seek out the option to slack pack.  However, if the opportunity presents itself, I’ll consider it.  


It was a gloomy day (again) and it started to rain about an hour into the hike.  Fortunately, it only lasted 15 minutes.  Of course, rain droplets from the trees fell on me for a long time thereafter.  It’s a pain to stop, take off the pack, get out my jacket and pack cover, put them on, and then the backpack back on.  Therefore, I tend to get a bit damp waiting to see if the rain will end quickly.  Of course, 5 minutes after stopping to cover up, the rain quit.  That means sweating with the jacket on, or stopping again and undoing everything.  Oh - the burden of being a thru-hiker (making fun of myself).


Ok, enough whining.  I had a couple highlights worth mentioning.  One being the burrito, and the other was crossing paths with High Loon (fellow Trailjournals author).  He was actually hiking south in this section.  More small world.  He is originally from Rochester, Michigan.  It’s right next to where my mother lives.  I also ran across Feral for the fourth time on his reverse NOBO 2-car hike.


When I got to Stecoah Gap, Craig wanted to run to Robbinsville to get some items from Ingles grocery store before heading back to the cabin. That was fine with us (Evergreen came along too), so I was able to top off my food supplies for the Smokies coming up.  We hit McDonalds as well.  I haven’t had a Big Mac in a long time - but for once, l’m not worried about the fat, Na, and calories.  It was very good by the way.  Guilt-free.


Plan for tomorrow is to hike to Fontana Dam (13.8 I think) and stay 2 nights at the lodge.  I really need to take a zero before tackling the Smokies.  My body is telling me to stop this nonsense.","N.O.C.

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632658,"Craig dropped me off at Stecoah Gap around 8:15 and off I went.    Cabins in the Woods is a great little cabin and was perfect for what I needed.  Thanks Craig and Eileen for being great hosts.  


Going solo today.  Actually, even though I’ve been covering the same distances and splitting shuttles and hotel/cabin fees with other hikers, I rarely hike with anyone during the day.  Today’s trek was supposed to be lenient compared to the last few days.   There was an early steep climb called Jacob’s ladder, but other than that, nothing too difficult until the final 5 miles where there were multiple mediocre climbs.  It rained on and off all day today and it makes 5 days since the sun was visible.  I just kept my rain gear on.  Therefore, even though there were multiple places on the trail with fantastic vistas, I wasn’t rewarded any due to gray skies and clouds.


I hiked with Section Hiker Phil for about 20 minutes.  He’s doing a long section hike and going north until he decides to get off the trail.  The interesting thing about Phil is that he’s working during his hike.  He has a laptop with him and does work in the evenings.  I crossed paths with Feral again (5th time).  The highlight of the day was seeing “Not Today” (Andrewlivelife on YouTube) in the parking lot at Fontana Dam while waiting for the shuttle to the Village.  He started a couple days before me but has taken 3 zeros.  It was really cool coming around the corner and seeing the huge dam from high above through the trees.  I thought I’d be down there in approximately 10 minutes.  It took over 30 minutes before I finally wound my way down there.  Steep rocky trail meant slow going.  I fell twice in 5 minutes in this stretch due to muddy slick downhills covered in wet leaves. Luckily I didn’t land on any protruding rocks.


Fontana Village is really cool - but empty.  I was the only one in the restaurant for dinner.   I’m surprised it’s still open, but thank God it is.  I’m planning to take a zero tomorrow and then (depending on the weather) try to get through the Smokeys in 5 days starting Wednesday.  The weather across the country is crazy right now, so we’ll see what happens.  I’ll go to Gatlinburg if that’s the right thing to do - and if the road is open.","Stecoah Gap

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632671,"My challenge for today was to not fall on the icy downhill sidewalk and paths down to the village laundry facility (an inexcusably long distance from the lodge btw).  Other than that, see the photo above for all the things I accomplished today.
I’m watching the crazy weather everywhere around the country and we’ve got it pretty good here in the southern Smokey Mountains compared to many other places.  No complaints.
My wife said NW Ohio had a foot of snow overnight and our Snowblower broke while she was clearing the driveway today.  She’s a saint for putting up with me being gone and having to deal with stuff like that.  She tells me it’s no big deal and she can handle it, but I can’t help but feel guilty for not being there.  I know that I’m a lucky man - and that I definitely married up. Today confirms it.","Fontana Dam

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632686,"Today was a beautiful day to enter the Smokeys.  The sun was shining the entire day and the views were spectacular.  It’s hard to believe how awful the weather is pretty much everywhere else in the country.  Also - how terrible it’s been in the Smokeys during the last couple weeks.  I enjoyed it while it lasted because tonight calls for freezing rain and sleet - with an all day rain forecasted for tomorrow.


I got a late start since the shuttle from the Fontana Lodge doesn’t start until 9 am and was dropped off near the marina to pick up where I left off on Monday.  The day off was exactly what I needed and my legs and mental state both felt refreshed.  Today’s route went from 1685 feet at the dam up to 5025 feet over approximately 16 miles.


I crossed paths with SOBOs Cobra and Mountain Cat who started last August.  It was a pleasure to meet them and they seemed very determined to finish - but were planning on staying at Fontana Lodge tonight.  I also met Big Hunk who is a NOBO but was hiking southbound through the Smokeys .


Even through today was pretty much one long climb, it was only steep in a few places.  Therefore, I was able to keep up a decent pace.  I was planning on stopping at Russel Field Shelter, which would have been a very productive 16.5 mile day.  I was feeling good and told myself that if I got there by 4pm, I’d push it to the next shelter 2.9 miles down trail.  I got there at 3:58 pm so I had to honor the deal I made with myself.  When I got to the side trail to Spence Field Shelter, it said it was 0.2 miles to get there.  Oh well, no other options.  It really wasn’t too bad so here I am writing today’s journal.  There isn’t a tarp on this shelter and the wind is coming in so it’s going to be cold tonight.  19.4 trail miles today.  We’ll find out tomorrow if this was a bad idea.","Fontana Dam Marina
",Spence Field Shelter,"Feb 17, Wed",19.40
Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632718,"After yesterday’s nice weather and relatively kind trail, today the Smokeys got even.  Freezing rain on and off all day with a high in the mid thirties.  The trail this morning required walking in a flowing stream.  Water was flowing down the trail as I hiked  up and down Rocky Top and Thunderhead Mountain.  The climbs, unlike yesterday, were steep.  The long descent off Thunderhead was extremely slow-going and a bit scary with water flowing down the trail and ice-covered rocks everywhere.  Luckily I didn’t fall because it would have been catastrophic. Sharp jagged rocks protrude from the trail.  As a result, the 6.1 miles to the first shelter took almost 4 hours.  I was soaked from the rain and sweat under my rain jacket, and would immediately freeze up whenever I stopped.  So - the obvious thing was to keep going.  I put on a dry shirt at Derrick Knob Shelter to stave off the chill - for at least a little while until that one gets soaked.


I finally pulled into Double Spring Gap Shelter around 4:30 pm.  Gutting out today’s 13.5 miles means it’s “only” a 10.5 mile day tomorrow up and over Clingman’s Dome to Newfound Gap.  Since tomorrow is supposed to be similar weather, I’ve decided to hitch a ride to Gatlinburg to dry out my gear - and myself.  The plan is not to take a zero, but if the freezing rain is still forecasted, I’ll have to consider it.  Remember, I’m Mr. Freeze for a reason.  Cold and wet will do me in -  and it’s been a real challenge dealing with my Raynauds in this weather.  I had no feeling in my fingers for much of the day.


Highlights of the day:  met Just-a-Farmer (YouTube) and passed Feral again.  Also, the 2000 mile point for SOBOs was marked with sticks, but I couldn’t get a picture since my hands were numb and I didn’t want to take them out of my gloves. The biggest highlight was seeing Double Spring Gap Shelter.  No views and no photos today.  Sorry for the downer post today.  This is what I signed up for.","Spence Field Shelter
",Double Spring Gap Shelter,"Feb 18, Thu",13.50
Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632719,"It was dark when I awoke and I decided to try and get an early start.  I made a rookie mistake by not not checking where the Privy was the night before while it was still light.  Numerous paths come towards the shelter.  Two for the AT, one to the water source, one to the privy, one to the bear cables, and one to tenting sites.  The headlamp only helps so much.  I knew the AT, water, and bear cables paths, so that meant a 50-50 chance.  Good news, I guessed correctly.  Bad news, the trail to the privy was like a ditch full of water from yesterday’s rain.  Since it was dark, I didn’t notice until I stepped in the cold water with my Crocs.  


That was the last of the bad news for today though.  When it finally started to get light, out popped a hazy sun.  The temperature got down to the low 20s last night, but I stayed warm in my 0 degree Marmot bag.  Getting changed for the day  in the cold temps is not fun, but at least I had my last set of dry clothes to put on.


I’ll take cold any day over hiking in the rain.  I got my wish.  The previous 24 hours of constant rain froze overnight and the trail was completely iced over.  Slow going again - but I didn’t care.  The sun was shining (even though I rarely was out of the deep forest today), I felt much stronger than yesterday, and I knew I was going to be sleeping in a bed tonight.


Even though I knew there would be no views from Clingman’s Dome, I took the side trail up there anyhow.  The winding path up the tower was not snow-covered, but was a sheet of ice.  Thank God for the handrail.  The 360 degree view at the top was as expected.  Nothing but clouds.


I finally reached Newfound Gap and there was a great view from the parking lot.  It happened to be a Friday and the area was fairly busy.  After striking out asking a dozen or so potential caring souls if they would help out a poor hiker get to Gatlinburg ( I even offered to pay them), I spotted Amy with her trekking poles and day pack.  She was super nice and immediately said she would help us after consulting her husband (who wasn’t with her at the gap).  I could hear her describe us (I was with another hiker) as thru- hikers and he agreed.  She was very kind and didn’t mention the thru-hiker smell - LOL.  As it turns out our Trail Angel Amy is from Grand Rapids, Michigan.  My son lives there.  During the ride to town, we had the pleasure of hearing just how much of a fearless outdoors person she is.  She’s hiked in Patagonia, the Andes Mountains, several trails in the last few weeks in NC, and has also been kayaking some of the rivers and frigid waters in the area in the last few weeks.  Get this, she doesn’t wear a wet suit.  She declined our money after dropping  us off.  Thank you Amy, it was a pleasure and honor to meet you.  She’s a lot tougher than me.","Double Spring Gap Shelter
",Newfound Gap,"Feb 19, Fri",10.50
Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632735,"Shuttle driver Julie (Trail Name “Stripper”) dropped me off at Newfound Gap just about 9 am.  The goal was to hike 15.7 miles to Tri-Corner Knob Shelter.  It was very windy and the temperature was in the low 20s.  However, I was good with that because the sun was shining.  As soon as I started down the trail, I realized my trekking poles were too short.  The Black Diamond FLZ poles have this over-engineered locking device that I haven’t had any problems with before on the trip.  For whatever reason, I couldn’t get either one to work.  The poles were in the back of the truck on the ride from Gatlinburg so I thought maybe they froze up.  I tried using them as they were, but the segments kept separating and left the looser part of the pole dangling until I would stick them together again .  To top it off, as icy as other segments of the trail have been, there usually was a way to pick my way around it and didn’t use my micro spikes.  In the first couple of miles, there was no way around it. I had to put them on - especially since my poles weren’t working.  I battled the disconnecting poles and ice for a few miles until I decided it’s time to get out the gorilla tape.  I found a sunny spot on the north side of the mountain and out of the wind.  The tape was in my tent bag - which of course is at the bottom of my pack.  I tried getting the locking device to work one more time before taping and was successful.  I’m not sure what the problem was, but it was really dangerous when I would go to plant a pole and it was dangling like an accordion.


The rest of the day was great. I can’t believe how many photos I took, but it seemed that each view was better than the last one.  It was a phenomenal day for Smokey Mountain scenery.  I have to say today’s scenery was the best of the trip so far.


I finally pulled into the shelter around 4:30 pm and two weekend hikers Bo and Josh were there.   They tried for over an hour to get a fire going but it just wasn’t happening.  It’s supposed to get in the teens tonight, so a warm fire in the shelter sounds great.  Just about at dusk, a lone hiker named Chopper came in to the shelter.  She’s hiking a loop around the Smokeys and did the Pacific Crest Trail in 2017.","Newfound Gap

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632745,"It was a cold night in the shelter.  Bo and Josh stuck with it and eventually (after 2 hours) got a fire started in the shelter fireplace.  There was no tarp on the shelter so I don’t think it helped much unless you stood next to it.


I got on the trail around 7:30 am because I wanted to try to get out of the Smokeys today.  It was barely 20 degrees and breezy on the mountain so I hiked with my Patagonia puffy on for the first time.  Of course, there’s a good climb right when you leave Tri-Corner Knob Shelter so I soon reverted to my rain jacket to cut the wind and avoid sweating.  The sun was shining all day again and there was a cool breeze on the north sides of the mountains and a warm sun on the south sides.  I can’t believe with all the recent crappy weather around the country that I’ve had sun for 4 out of 5 days across the park.  Just a week or two earlier several thru-hikers got stranded in the park or couldn’t even start due to snow storms.  Granted, the one freezing rain day was really really tough, but if you would have asked me before the trip if I’d take 1 bad day and 4 good ones through the Smokeys, I would have in a heart beat.


Blue skies and clear vistas all day again.  Man, the north half of the AT in the park is so much better than the south half.  


I made great time and still got rewarded with beautiful scenery.  One location offered a view as far as Pigeon Forge (and farther, but I don’t know how far).  I arrived at the third oasis (although I’m not sure Standing Bear Farm qualifies) of the northbound AT before 4 pm.  I’m staying in the bunkhouse with only one other hiker so it should be just fine.  I won’t go into detail here because it’s difficult to describe this hostel with only a few words.  Let’s leave it at “Unique.”  I heard about it before but wanted it to be part of my experience, even though it would likely be rated as less than a 1 star facility.  Hey, it beats sleeping in an open shelter on a cold wooden floor in sub 20 degree weather.


Highlights of the day: the morning sun over the Smokeys, exiting the Smokey Mountain National Park, and running into Feral again.  I lost count how many times we’ve crossed paths hiking in the opposite direction.  Shoutout to Feral (check out his YouTube channel).  He helped a fellow thru-hiker a couple of days ago who was experiencing serious vertigo to get out of the southern end of the Smokeys.  With a steep rocky and icy trail, the man could have been seriously hurt.  It took all day to walk with him at a half mile per hour pace to get to Fontana.  There aren’t many of us out here right now, so it’s good to know you can count on each other if needed.","Tri-Corner Knob Shelter

I know my journal entries can be lengthy, but today’s will be even longer.  After all, the purpose of the journal is for me to look back on the trip and remember as much as possible.  Also, it’s my journal so I can do what I want - LOL.  


Standing Bear Farm - I met Gator (AT thru- hiker in 2012 AND 2013) as Entered the compound.  It was his first day working there and he tried really hard to help us with what we need.  The place works on the honor system and you keep tab of your charges on a piece of paper.  Then you settle up with Maria as you leave.  They have a great selection of food and drinks for your stay (cook yourself pizza!) in their resupply hut.  There’s only one shower, one clothes drier, and one washboard ( no machine) so I can’t imagine how it goes when the place is full (bunkhouse sleeps 14, plus a couple of private cabins) when the bubble rolls through.  The drier is free, but takes a long time to dry your clothes.  We made a warm fire in the iron stove in the bunkhouse since there’s no heat.  They have a kitchen hut with a sink, small refrigerator, toaster/pizza oven, and fairly large table to eat. I would definitely stay there again if hiking the AT.  Very unique and rustic place.  PS: they have a community portajohn (very clean) and a Privy for everyone who stays there and works there.  That’s right 2 for everyone.


Morning - it was supposed to rain all morning and most of the afternoon, so I wasn’t sure what to do.  I wanted to get to Hot Springs tomorrow night and possibly take Wednesday off.  The thought of the big climbs up Snowbird Peak and Max Patch in the windy rain was not appealing, but thru-hikers are supposed to embrace the suck so I decided to try for the first shelter 7.5 miles away and make a decision what to do after that.  So - I grew up in Michigan hearing all the time that if you don’t like the weather, then wait 10 minutes and it will change.  When I moved to Ohio after college, I heard that phrase from Ohioans a lot.  I’ve also heard it from people who live in many other states - so I think the reality is that other than a few places, (e.g. Hawaii) weather changes frequently and when it wants.  But today - I finally experienced exactly that while going up and down Snowbird Peak.  I started out from Standing Bear at 9 am in the windy drizzle, as I got to the trail (.3 miles away), it started to hail.  Then it rained really hard for about an hour.  As I was getting closer to the top, it changed to large wet snowflakes.  At the summit, it was now sleeting.  It sleeted for the next mile down the mountain then back to a slow drizzle.   It stopped raining as I approached the first shelter.  I immediately put on some dry clothes and made some hot coffee to warm up and have lunch.  Just then, the sun came out and the temperature rose by 10 degrees.  Ok!  I’m going to eat and go the next 8.4 miles to Roaring Creek Shelter - which was the original plan.


Afternoon - the sun was out and I had all afternoon to do 8.4 miles.  I was excited to hopefully have a clear 360 degree view at the top of Max Patch.  I’ve heard a lot about it.  Since I was alone and likely not going to see anyone else today after the crappy weather morning, I played music for the first time while hiking.  It felt great and it really helped pass the time and for the multiple climbs on the way to Max Patch.  I finally got to the top and the wind was whipping so hard that my waterproof Eddie Bauer cap blew off.  Luckily it got stuck in a tall patch of grass or it would have been long gone.  If you’ve never been there, I highly recommend it.  Great views of the mountains - including the Smokeys - in all directions.  I feel fortunate for the day to turn out like it did.


I did feel good about sucking it up in the cold, wet, storming, and windy morning, but there weren’t too many highlights today - other than Max Patch and the tunes.  I did meet Eric and Missy who were starting a northbound hike this morning at I-40.  Man - what a day and place to start.  It is an immediate 5 mile climb for them - and in the crappy weather.  I must say they didn’t look thrilled.  I hope they make it.  I’m writing this in my tent because the shelter had 4 guys from Illinois who are Section hiking staying there.  They seem nice enough, but they had a lot of beer, food, hatchets, saws, music playing, and a great fire going.  I didn’t want them to change their evening plans for me, so I found a decent tent site about 50 yards away.  They offered to make room, but I’ll sleep better in my tent anyway.

It took me an hour and a half to shove off once I exited the bag this morning.  I’m not improving any.  It was a really windy day today and mostly sunny.  It was chilly early on with the wind so I kept my jacket on for awhile.  There were 3 medium climbs today and I can tell I need a day off.  That’s 110 miles in the last week.  Mother Nature decided that tomorrow will be in the mid 60s.  How can I take a day off with that???


I rolled into Hot Springs at 3:40 pm and had 20 minutes to get to the Post Office before closing.  My wife sent me a medicine refill, a new ATM card, and the next section of AWOLs AT guide.  I made it - but that’s extra walking that I didn’t need.


I walked into the hostel and who do I see?  Phil.  He’s the guy who is doing his regular job from the trail.  I hadn’t seen him since Fontana Village.  We went to the Iron Horse Inn for dinner and a beer.  It was good to see him.  I’m still not sure what to do for the next few days.  Take a zero on the nicest day of the year?  Or push my body towards Erwin, TN 70 miles up trail.  It’s a big decision because I have to know how much food to buy.  I’m way too tired right now though, so I’ll push the decision off until the morning.","Roaring Fork Shelter

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632779,"I wasn’t sure what to do and thought about it all night.  I read an email from one of my daughters this morning that said: “Take a zero Stanley!”


Stanley is my father who passed away a few years ago.  I know many stubborn and competitive people in my life, but nobody more so than my Dad.  There’s no doubt what he would do in my situation.  He would pop a 20 just to prove he could.  Of course, he would be off the trail in a week due to some injury.  Now, I am proud to say that I take after him in those qualities, but I like to think I use better judgement sometimes.  So - thank you Steph.  After reading her email, I knew what to do.  I would take a half day off, start around 1 and take my time to go the 8.7 miles and camp up near the Rich Mountain Fire Tower.


I’m proud to say I worked the plan to a tee.  Breakfast at 8 at the Rocky Mountain Diner (where I set up the 5 day plan to get to Erwin TN), head over to Bluff Mountain Oufitters, then to Dollar General, then back to the hostel.  I leisurely packed up and laid around until a little after 12.  I settled up with GT and Turner at the hostel and headed out to the diner for lunch.  I failed to mention there wasn’t a cloud in the sky and it was in the upper 60s.  Hiking in shorts and a t-shirt today.


The trail out of town follows the bank of beautiful French Broad River.  It then goes up up up the cliffs high above the rapids and the town of Hot Springs NC.  Great photos.  I took my time and enjoyed the numerous vistas in the first 3 miles.  I could feel my body was tired, but the hiking wasn’t too difficult since I was going really slowly.


For the first time on this trip, other than in Hot Springs, the trail was on a dirt road for a quarter mile or so.  It later crosses over a highway and to the start of a 2.4 mile climb up to the fire tower.  


I set up camp a couple tenths of a mile from the tower in a designated area and headed to the tower (up hill all the way of course).  I was too early for sunset but got great photos and a video while up there.  I’m taking it easy again tomorrow, so I hope the plan will work.


Only saw day hikers today.
I failed to mention I met Feral again yesterday who’s hiking southbound - sort of.  I also had a great conversation with the Stone Sisters (Veggie Tunes and Vogue).  They’re close to finishing their SOBO thru-hike they started on Aug 9.  Very friendly and gave me some good advice in hostels and shuttlers for the upcoming week.","Laughing Heart Hostel

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632810,"I was supposed to do a slow and easy 11.2 miles today and then 17.1 on Friday to a hostel.  ATweather.org, however says its supposed to rain on Friday.  Simple enough, I’ll do a long day today and a shorter one on Friday.  That means 18.5 to Jerry’s Cabin Shelter today.


The day started out with mostly downhill followed by some medium ups and downs.  I was making good time but not rushing it.  I knew there was a long uphill coming.  I was in the woods all morning and early afternoon and really couldn’t get any pictures through the trees.  I did see a big white Tom Turkey strut across the trail but he was too fast to get a photo.   It was a pretty boring trail section and I didn’t see anyone for most of the day - and no thru-hikers at all. The mid-day climb of 2500 feet in 4.5 miles did wear me out - but no good views at the top of Camp Creek Bald.  Then I came to a split in the trail.  To the left was the bad weather bypass of Big Firescald Knob.  I stayed on the AT and immediately was faced with snow and ice covered rock climbs.  If it wasn’t at the end of a long day and long strenuous uphill, it would have been fun.  After a few minutes, more rock climbs and then up to a ridge with spectacular views on both sides.  I enjoyed them, but the trail was up and down boulder scrambling for the next half mile or so.  I thought it was going to be an easy cruise to the shelter after the long climb up Camp Creek Bald.   Boy was I wrong.  It was interesting though, and very different from what the AT has shown me previously.


I ran into two Trail Maintainers returning from cutting some downed trees.  I thanked them - especially because it was a long and difficult hike to get there while carrying chain saws and lots of other gear.  I really do appreciate everyone who works to keep the trail in good shape for us.","Rich Mountain Camp

The Alan Jackson song Work in Progress came to mind today because I got on the trail at 6:59 am - “a gold star for me”.  My earliest yet - and not because I sleep late.  I’m just slow packing up.  I really needed to hoof it because it’s a 90% chance of rain by 11am.  I wasn’t sure if it was going to be open, but Laurel Hostel is 9.8 miles away.  That would keep me out of the rain and get some needed rest while I’m at it.  It would also set me up for a two day push to Erwin, TN by Sunday afternoon.


This trail section contains two morbid landmarks in a short span.  First, there’s a gravestone of one of the early thru-hikers, Howard E. Bassett, that says his ashes were spread there.  A short while later, is a side trail to the Shelton Graves.  I did some internet searching and those go back to the Civil War days.  The local family was terrorized by Confederates for being Union sympathizers in a southern state.


Another interesting (at least to me) time fact for today.  It was supposed to rain after 11 am.  It started sprinkling exactly at 10:58 am.  I was almost to the road crossing where the Laurel Hostel is 0.2 miles to the east.  Shortly after getting there, the skies opened up - and it’s still raining as I write this sitting in my bunk at 2:45 pm.  Good decision today!!!


Laurel Hostel won’t win any awards.  It’s a glorified shed with 3 sets of bunk beds, a chair, a shower room with a sink.  It’s heated by electric space heaters (which are struggling to keep up).  Those of you who are observant will notice I didn’t mention a bathroom.  You have to go outside to an outhouse.  I haven’t been there yet, but I have no problem with it.  Beats a cold and damp shelter any day.  PS: Tim the owner has frozen pizza, hot pockets, honey buns, skittles, and beer.  He’s not fully stocked up yet because I’m only the 2nd or 3rd person here this year.","Jerry’s Cabin Shelter

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632830,"I was on the trail by 7:40 am this morning with a plan to do 15.8 miles to Bald Mountain Shelter, or a couple more to a stealth camp site if the weather was good.  The AT follows the Tennessee - North Carolina border since back in the Smokeys.  I walked along an ancient and unkept barbed wire border fence for several miles today.  The trail crosses the state line multiple times and there were survey markers periodically right on the trail.    


I had a rough going today because it seemed like I was always going up.  I started the day with a big climb out of Rector Laurel Road and ended with a more than 6 mile climb up to Big Bald (5504 feet).  The overall gain today was more than 2500 feet.


I crossed paths with Feral again.  He was just starting the day at Sam’s Gap.  I saw no other thru- hikers today.


By the time I got to Bald Mountain Shelter, I was spent.  The skies were gray and it was still supposed to rain.  I decided to call it a day, even though it was only 3:15 pm.  As I was unpacking for the evening, in walks Jesse and Jen scoping out if they want to stay here.  Turns out they’re out Section Hiking for the weekend.  We all had an early dinner at the picnic table and it was really nice to have the company.  I’ve been alone (including at the hostel) since Hot Springs.


Tomorrow calls for a 17 mile day into Erwin where I’m taking a zero on Monday - no matter what the weather is like","Laurel Hostel

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632838,"The trail today into Erwin, TN from Bald Mountain Shelter was the opposite of yesterday.  There were some heart thumping uphills, but the majority of the day was downhill.  I’ll take downhill any day - BUT, downhill on the AT is tough on my 60 year old knees and ankles.  I know it seems like I’m whining again, but in reality, today wasn’t too bad.  There really weren’t many places to get good views either, so it was head down, don’t trip, don’t slip, don’t turn your ankle and carefully place my foot down in every step.  The theme today was mountain side trail on a slight side angle and walking on roots.  By the end of today, my feet had enough and town couldn’t come soon enough.


Last night from the shelter, I called Doug from AT Hiker Shuttles in Erwin to arrange for a 4 pm pickup on the east side of the Nolichucky River at the trailhead.  I was a little ahead of schedule so I sat on a rock and waited for him.  My feet and legs were so sore they were throbbing.  No doubt, after 180 miles in 12 days (including the Ice covered Smokeys), my body is telling me to take a break.  I need a mental break as well.  So - Monday will be a zero.


It was a beautiful day today though and I hiked in shorts.  I can’t wait until the spring temperatures are here for good.  I’ll be able to ship home some cold weather items.


As is the case since Standing Bear 103 miles ago, I’ve seen no other thru-hikers other than a couple southbounders and periodically crossing paths with Feral.  I did have a great conversation this morning with Section Hiker Lanse from Illinois.  Also - I ran across Mike from the North Carolina hiking club who was doing trail maintenance.  I can’t say enough about those guys.  


I’m having a good time out here, but admit this is really really hard - both physically and mentally.  Harder than I thought it would be.  Hiking the steep and long uphills is not like hiking at home.  There’s very very little “flat” out here.  I’ve been listening to music (afternoons only) more and more to pass the time - but only in remote area where there isn’t likely to be day hikers.


Well - it’s a month now and I’ve honestly made more progress (344.4 miles) than I figured I would at this point.  That total includes two zero days. I know it’s not easy, but I’m looking forward to Virginia.  It’s supposed to be a little more forgiving.  I’ll find out soon enough.","Bald Mountain Shelter

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632866,"No miles today, but I accomplished quite a bit.  I was able to take care of some personal items from home.  I also contacted Zpacks about my Vertice Rain Pants.  After only 2 weeks, the inside seam tape is unraveling.  Jamie (“Field Trip” class of 2018) at Zpacks was great and is going to send me a replacement pair.  He said there are reports of a bad lot and they’re changing the tape out with an improved type.  He’s going to let me know when the new ones are  available (5 to 6 weeks).  I also contacted REI because the toe bump flaps on both of my Oboz Sawtooth II MidBdry boots came loose after only 350 miles.  I had no problems with my previous pair.  I did some boot repair in the hotel, but the REI rep gave me info on how to return them if the repair didn’t work.


I took a calculated risk.  I know I need to start eating more, so to make room in my pack, I sent home my micro spikes (only used them once - even though I should have used them more), titanium bowl (I eat out of my cook pot), down booties, and down sleeping pants.  


I wanted to give a shout out to Doug at AT Shuttles in Erwin.  He’s a first class guy.  He provides Great service, he puts customers first and it’s obvious he enjoys helping out hikers.  His rates are very hiker-friendly as well.  He picked me up at the Nolichucky River trail head yesterday and is taking me back tomorrow morning.


I had four very big meals in Erwin during my stay, and also bought some extra food for the next 3 days.  I’ll see if that boosts my energy for Unaka and Roan Mountains in the upcoming days.","Erwin, TN

I’ve been mentioning how I’ve not seen any other NOBO thru-hikers for a really long time.  Well, about 4 miles into today’s hike, I came to a shelter and I heard my name being called - but couldn’t tell who it was.  It was Feral who was sitting talking with Not-So-Much taking a break.  I knew of Not-So-Much (NSM) but never met him.  He’s a Feb 1 starter as well.  Who would have thought that three Feb 1 starters would randomly meet at a shelter 348 miles later.  Of course Feral is hiking in the south direction moving NOBO, but I ended up hiking with NSM for about half the day today.  He is from Canton, Ohio and was sporting a Browns hat.  Since my two daughters live in Cleveland, we had a lot to talk about.  His wife his a teacher too. He’s also the same age as me.  Small world.


There were a couple good uphills today, but I was fresh from a zero and the day went by pretty quickly and wasn’t too tough overall.  Roan Mountain is the big challenge tomorrow, so I didn’t push too hard today.


After 17 miles of hiking, we came to tonight’s destination - Cherry Gap Shelter.  What a surprise, more thru-hikers.   Ice Bear and Biscuit (and Biscuits dog Roo) were set up in the shelter.  Ice Bear is from Key West and Biscuit is semi-local from Chapel Hill.  Funny how right after mentioning how long it’s been since I’ve seen a thu-hiker and today I run into three.  I really enjoyed the conversation with NSM while hiking, as well as meeting and talking with Ice Bear and Biscuit.  Really cool people.","Erwin, TN

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632911,"Not-So-Much (NSM) and I left around 7:15 am.  I planned to get up to the top of Roan Mountain by days end.  It’s the last really long and high altitude mountain for awhile.  That means another 17+ day with the 5 mile climb at the very end of the day.  Lots of up today.  NSM is the same age as me, but he’s a faster hiker.  We walked together for a little while, but he was ahead of me for most of the day.


A few miles after starting, we ran into Reset.  He’s a veteran and retired police officer who started his hike in January 2.  He said his pack is 55 to 60 pounds.  That’s about double what mine weighs.  He’s taking it slow and easy.  I hope he makes it.


The climb up Roan Mountain (6270 feet) was very difficult.  It took me almost 3 hours to get to the summit.  Also, the last half mile was ice covered - so very slow going.  The shelter at the top, Roan High Knob Shelter, is the highest shelter on the entire AT.  It is deep in the forest and there was ice everywhere.  When I got there, I was pleasantly surprised to see Quicksand.  Quicksand is a YouTube icon and I’ve watched his videos for a long time and learned a lot from him.  Also, his style is a straight shooter.  He tells it like it is.  I felt odd asking for a photo, but he was really cool about it - Alright!!!


He said it was supposed to be 19 degrees up there tonight.  Since it was only 4 pm and there are stealth camp spots 1.4 miles down at Carver’s Gap, NSM and I decided to push forward where it will be warmer tonight.

Just before highway 19E, Quicksand caught us.  He is friends with the folks at Mountain Harbour hostel and was going to stay there.  Unfortunately, there aren’t enough hikers yet for them to make their famous breakfast and their dinner food truck is seasonal.  Since the Station at 19E hostel has a restaurant and bar, that’s where Not-So-Much and I decided to go.  We got picked up at the trailhead so we didn’t have to hike the extra uphill half mile.  I was able to do laundry and got a free beer from someone who did trail magic.  First trail magic of the hike for me.  Thank you DowntownAlanBrown!  Of course I paid it forward for some future hiker.  It’s a great idea to offer that perk.  I met some wonderful people in the bar at the hostel.  Crazy Wolf was the bartender,  Karhop was finishing some sections he missed last year due COVID. I met Drifter, Brandon (section hiker), Dave (hostel owner), Bash (ex-thru-hiker working there), Scott (local) and Burning Moose.  Not-So-Much was with us as well.  It was a fun time and I had a delicious French Dip sandwich with fries.  I was given some free beers as well and “reluctantly” accepted and drank (way) too much.  I hope I’m able to recover by tomorrow.","Carver’s Gap

I paid the price last night and this morning for all the fun I had with my new friends at the bar.  I like beer, but I don’t drink that often.  I have to say that I succumbed to the peer pressure and had a couple too many beers.  They were craft beers too.  Anyway, sometimes you have to relearn life lessons.  In this case one I learned a very long time ago.


Dave dropped us (Not-So-Much and me) off at the trailhead at 8 am to start today’s long hike.  The plan was to get to Boots Off Hostel by Saturday afternoon.  NSM is thinking about taking a zero there since he’s been hiking for at least 2 weeks straight now.  I’m not sure what I’m going to do yet.


Today started and finished with some tough climbs.  The middle part of the trail was pretty much minor rolling hills and was pretty easy compared to what we’ve been doing.  The hike took longer than normal because we took a 0.2 mile side trail to Jones Falls and we also took a wrong turn by the Elk River and went about a quarter mile before realizing our error.  That made a long day even longer.


About 3 miles before getting to Moreland Gap Shelter, my right leg began to hurt above the knee in my inner quad muscle area.  I hope it’s just some soreness.  I may have to rethink what to do at Boots Off hostel.  We’ll see.","Station at 19E Hostel

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632987,"I got out of my tent and packed up shortly after 7 am.  It was around 25 degrees, but the sun was shining and I “only” had to do 14.8 miles today.  The plan was to stay at Boots Off Hostel, do some laundry, and resupply for the next three days into Damascus, VA.


The first 9 miles looked like it was going to be a fairly easy section.  I had all day, so I took it pretty easily.  I even talked on the phone with my wife for 30 minutes early in the day.  It’s always great to talk with her - especially if the terrain isn’t too hard or dangerous because the time passes quickly.
As soon as I crossed Dennis Cove Road, the trail widens and follows Laurel Fork River on a wide and very gradual uphill.  There were rapids and large boulders in the river diverting the water.  The trail turned left through two high walls of rock.  I was told it was cut for an old railroad track.  It looked to me like the perfect place to film a movie scene in which there is an ambush.


The trail then goes down hundreds of rock steps to the Laurel Fslls.   This place was amazing but was starting to get crowded (Saturday).


After I stopped for a short lunch break on a log, Feral walked by just as I was packing up.  A hundred yards or so later, the sign to go up Laurel Flats was not busy.  It was hard, but nothing too tough.  100s of switchbacks it seems.  
The sky was blue and without any clouds.  Once I made it to the top of Pines Flats, it was pretty much downhill for 3 miles to the hostel.  Until today, it seems I was in the middle of the scenery or was looking at it from far away .  Today, I was close up and next to the scenery and it was very enjoyable.   


I checked into the hostel around 2:30 pm and went to the bunkhouse for a shower.  This is the nicest hostel I’ve stayed at.

Me, NSM, Wildcard, and Ace left Boots Off hostel at 7:50 am after a continental breakfast.   The first couple of hours were winding our way up and around the fingers of Watauga Lake.  All day was pretty much walking up and down a ridge line.  Lots of short ups and downs and nothing too tough.  NSM took the lead and was gone, but I hiked with Wildcard and Ace for about 2 hours before they slowed down.  They’re from West Virginia and started at Davenport Gap just outside the Smokeys because dogs aren’t allowed on the trail there.


Today seemed fairly easy and I felt like Forrest Gump running back and forth across the continent.  Each time that i got to my destination, I decided to just keep going.  How plans change.  The intent was to hike the 42 miles to Damascus in 3 days and have just 10 miles on the third day.  That leaves it open to not take a zero if the weather is still good.  After today’s long hike, I’m now thinking I’m going to go for Damascus tomorrow, and then take the morning off like I did in Hot Springs.  That gives me the mental break I need, but still make some progress.  We’ll see how tomorrow goes.  My legs could feel like lead.


I did spend 10 minutes or so this afternoon with a family doing a day hike.  It so happens that two of them have done a thru-hike.  The group was really friendly and said they were the original owners of Dancing Bear hostel in Damascus.  I really enjoyed meeting them.  They were 1/3 (hiked 2003), Eduardo, Omar, Waterboy (hiked 1999), and Diane (2/3 400 miles of AT).","Boots Off Hostel

I put Tennessee in my rear view mirror around 3.5 miles south of Damascus.  3 down, 11 to go.  By the way, I’ll be in VA for awhile (500 + miles), so this won’t be a topic any time soon.


I was on the trail at 6:40 am - yep - no typo there.  A new record for me.  I wanted to get to Damascus as early as possible to maximize my rest time before heading out Tuesday around lunch time.  The trail was similar to yesterday, except there was a long downhill from the ridge line at the end instead of an early uphill to the ridge line.  It was fairly easy hiking though.  No serious ups, rocks and roots weren’t bad, but not much scenery due to the trees.


Damascus is supposed to be trail town USA.  However, I tried calling several hostels and they’re either not open yet, closed down, or nobody answers (and of course no message option).  The two main restaurants I wanted to go to for dinner are BOTH closed on Mondays what???  I was just about to call one of the expensive hotels or B&Bs when I got a call back from Treehouse (2017 thru-hiker) at The Broken Fiddle.  They just opened for the season and have room in their bunkhouse.  He was great when I got there and got a free beer from Lion Heart (2017 thru-hiker) who was working there.  Very clean place and I recommend hikers to stay here.


I also met Austin today.  He was 2 miles south of Damascus where he just started a flip-flop (going SOBO first).  He had a BIG pack, but is a young guy, so he looked strong enough to handle it.  Best of luck to him.

Ok - I’m whining again.  Sorry.  The plan was for the three of us to head out to the trail around noon and stop for lunch at Subway (also not open for breakfast btw).  Wildcard decided that he and Ace are going to stay another day.  So I headed out myself.  Subway tasted great and I’m enjoying drinking regular soda whenever it’s available rather than diet.  Another AT thru-hiker perk - you can eat or drink anything without worry.


The initial 5 miles or so are up and down but not too tough - and offer some great views of the rushing waters of Whitetop Laurel Creek below.  The VA Creeper (nice flat wide crushed stone) trail is on the other side below.  I saw several bikers on it while I was hiking above them.  In this stretch, I met Mission D.  She was day hiking some sections she couldn’t do last year in her thru-hike due to injury.  She’s recovering, but said she can’t wait any longer and is out testing her foot.  She made it to Damascus last year prior to getting hurt.  An hour later, I meet up with Mango and Smiley.  They are trying to section hike all of Virginia this year.  They have been hiking on the AT before with their friend Flop (falls a lot) but she couldn’t make it this time.  It was a pleasure meeting Mission D, Mango, and Smiley.  They were very cool to talk to and very experienced as well.


As usual, I took my time - and today is supposed to be a rest day anyway.


Saunders Shelter is a quarter mile off trail, but worth it.  It is clean, fairly new, a stream for water is nearby, has a great sunrise view, has a working Bear box, and a privy.  None of the shelters in northern TN had privies so this is a good thing.  The ground around the shelter is covered with pine needles and pinecones.  I’m the only one here so it should be a great (quiet) night.","Broken Fiddle Hostel

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633102,"I started pretty early today but by the time I got back to the AT from the shelter trail, it was 6:40 am, so I tied my previous earliest start time.  I had a great view of the sunrise as I hiked up and down the ridge.  The early morning daylight is my favorite time of the day to hike.  The trail eventually wound its way down the mountain in the rhododendrons, and came out on the Virginia Creeper Trail.  Since it’s primarily a bike trail, it was a treat walking a mile or so on the crushed stone path and I didn’t have to worry about roots or rocks.


All good things come to an end though and it was back into the rhododendrons for a few miles - with plenty of ups.  Around mid-day, the trail started to climb for 4 miles up Whitetop Mountain.  It was a very rocky section and you can only go fast at a big risk.  It took its toll on me, but I was rewarded at Buzzard Rock with a clear 360 degree view.  The sun was shining with a slight cool breeze, so I took an extra long 40 minute lunch break there.  It was hard to get moving again.  The trail went up for a while longer before starting to decline (but still rocky) to Elk Garden Trailhead.   I got rid of some trash in their bin, but the restrooms were locked.


The final part of the day required a four mile climb up to Mt. Rogers.  The first half was fairly gentle incline, but the final 2 miles was rugged rock hopping.  Very slow.  I finally got to the Thomas Knob Shelter near the summit of Mt. Rogers, only to find it was filthy.  No broom to sweep it out either.  Someone left a half-eaten Mountain House meal bag inside too.  I got rid of that and made the best of it.  I’m too tired to go another mile to some tent sites.  


As I was eating, Bryson and Rachel from NC stopped by.  They’re tenting in the woods nearby and I never even saw them.  They started a flip flop thru-hike a few days ago in Damascus.  They were very nice to talk to and I hope I see them in the next few days since we’re both going north.


Highlight of the day (and also the lowlight).  When I got to the shelter, there were six wild ponies hanging out picking at the ground for hiker trash and food droppings.  I didn’t expect to see them until tomorrow at Grayson Highlands.  They’re also the lowlight of the day because they continue to hang around looking for a handout - and horses do what horses do.  Sometimes fairly close to the shelter.  It’s going to be an interesting night.","Saunders Shelter
",Thomas Knob Shelter,"Mar 10, Wed",19.40
Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633164,"So many things happened today that I want to remember, so here we go.  In chronological order - sort of.


Two nights ago I slept in my favorite shelter yet.  Last night was awful. It was dirty (no broom to sweep it out like the others do), there was trash, it smelled, and it was harder to get into due to they put large boulders in front to hop up on so the wild ponies don’t get in the shelter.  I got over it and went to sleep.  However, I kept waking up because two ponies had their heads by the opening waiting for a handout for much of the night.  They made a lot of horse noises as well.  I’d wake up and roll over and there were their eyes just staring at me.  Unfortunately, some people feed them and now they expect it.


Since the Bear box for food storage was a hundred yards down the trail from the shelter, I just packed up without eating and put my food bag in my pack as I went by.  I stopped at a nice sunny spot at a campsite along the trail for breakfast about an hour and a half after starting.  There was a great view as well, so it was pretty nice.


With a few exceptions, the AT is the  3 “Rs”.  Rocks, Ruts, or Roots.  If you want to add Rain, then you can go with 4 I guess.  The early part of today was through the Grayson Highlands and several wild ponies were out in the open.  They are so used to people that they don’t even look up as you pass.  The trail here was ruts and rocks, and sometimes just large rocks to crawl up and over.  As I came down from the highlands and entered the forest, it was extremely footy and rocky.  It was very slow going for most of the day.  Due to the fourth R supposed to be coming tomorrow afternoon, I thought I would extend today’s distance a bit to make tomorrow shorter.  My feet were aching from the higher mileage and walking in the 3 Rs and I was getting low on energy as I approached the gap at State Route 603.  I knew there was an uphill coming too.  As I came out to the trailhead, there was a van with two people standing there and talking with another YouTube AT Hiker named Happy.  I’ve watched his videos for a few years now and he’s a pretty cool guy with a different take on things.  I knew he was ahead of me, but not sure if I’d ever catch him.  The best part of this meeting was Carrie and Jim (their van) were at the trailhead giving out trail magic.  WOW!!! I couldn’t believe it.  It was after 2 pm and I was run down and here they were with a van full of goodies.  They gave me a Dr. Pepper and a hot dog with coleslaw on it.  I’ve never had one like that, but it was great.  Then they gave me a banana and a vanilla Gatorade protein shake (not bad) as well.  I even received a wrapped pastry that I’m saving for breakfast tomorrow.  Carrie and Jim are true Trail Angels and wouldn’t take any money either.  They’ve done this for 7 years now out of the kindness of their hearts.  They even have printed business cards with their phone numbers for free shuttles in the area.  They’re truly good people.  I got a picture with Happy and took one of Carrie and Jim as well.  Other than the free beer at The Station at 19E, this is the only trail magic I’ve received on this trip.  And the food and drinks on the trail are extra special - and great timing too.  The hike up the mountain from the trailhead went fairly easy with all the recent energy input and it was going to be a lot easier doing the extra 3.5 miles past my original plan.


But, the story doesn’t stop there.  With only about 1.5 miles to go, I came to a sign that said to take a detour due to a bridge out.  The 1.5 turned into a 2.2 to go.  The detour included 1.3 mile uphill forest road walk at the end.  My actual daily mileage was 20.2 but I’ll keep it at 19.5 to consistent with the AT mileage charts.  I’m stealth camping next to a brook on the closed part of the AT at Dickey Gap, but it’s also close to State Route 16, so it’s going to be noisy periodically through the night if a truck goes by.  Ok - I think that’s everything for today.  Another long post, but like I said, I want to remember the details later on.","Thomas Knob Shelter

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633181,"It rained for most of the day so the photo today is of my meeting up with Happy yesterday.  I had a great camping spot last night because I was tucked down in a mini hollow.  I could hear the wind roaring last night but couldn’t feel it.  When I woke, the sky was gray.  I got going just before seven with the hope of only getting rained on for the last hour or so.  That plan didn’t work because it started drizzling around 8:30 and was on and off (mostly on) until I rolled into the Mt. Rogers Recreation Area Visitor Center.  They have a shuttle that will come pick you up at 2:15 pm and take you to Marion for 50 cents.  However, it was raining and I didn’t want to wait an hour so I decided to take Carrie’s offer from yesterday and call her and Jim to pick me up.  He showed up around 15 minutes after I called - and wouldn’t take any money.  I’ll leave something on the seat tomorrow when he drops me back off at the trail.  Again - they’re really good people.


I’m not taking a day off tomorrow, but I’m sitting on the motel bed writing this and I’ve got a painful blister on my left little toe that makes me limp and my right leg is throbbing.  My body’s telling me to just do the 11.4 miles to I-81 tomorrow and stay in a bed again.  We’ll see after that what the plan will be.  I walked pretty fast today (for me) and I’m seeing the consequence now.  I should know by now.  No pain, no rain, no Maine.


I did forget one thing from yesterday’s long post.  Around 15 minutes after leaving the shelter, I crossed the 500 mile mark.  There was no sign or posting so I wasn’t thinking about it.  That’s it for now.  Time to walk to Walmart for a resupply of food and some toiletries.","Dickey Gap tent site

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633223,"I leaned on Carrie and Jim for a third time for help.  Carrie gave me a ride from Marion to the trail head this morning where she was picking up Happy.  I enjoyed our conversation on the way and Carrie gave me a packet of her homemade “Carries Herbal Salve”.  She just keeps getting more and more amazing each meeting.  Thanks Carrie, it will surely come in handy.


Of course, the beginning of the trail today was up.  As a matter of fact, there was a lot of up in the first half of the day.  More than I recall seeing on Guthooks.  Oh well, today was a shorter day and I had to keep reminding myself to go very slowly.  Another thing I didn’t expect was how rocky it was.  I had no basis for thinking that other than trying to stay positive and hoping for an easy trail on an easy day.  I admit the rocks got to me after a while.  I’m worried how I’ll do in Pennsylvania (called Rocksylvania by hikers) if I’m struggling in southern VA.


Not many views today other than a cool picture of the valley below and of Walker Mountain.


I did run across two day hikers “Backwards Hat” and “Birddog”.  Backwards Hat completed a 2018 thru-hike and Birddog had done some long Section hikes of the AT in 2017.  Birddog said she wanted to complete the southern VA sections this year.  They gave me some great advice on what type of shoes they recommend and also a hostel in Front Royal to stop at.  It was short, but a really great conversation.  I enjoyed meeting them. I love to tap the brains of experienced hikers.


The final third of the trail today was opposite of the first part.  It was a gentle rolling path through meadows and forest  with few rocks, ruts, or roots.  I was able to cruise easily to I-81 where I had a large Mexican lunch at El Burrito Loco prior to heading over to the Relax Inn (right off the trail).  Do I feel guilty for spending a second straight night in a motel?  Not at all.  I needed to make some miles and get some rest - it all worked out great as far as I’m concerned.  Hopefully I’ll feel refreshed tomorrow and start my run towards Pearisburg.","Mt. Rogers National Recreation Area HQ
",I-81,"Mar 13, Sat",11.40
Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633279,"I started out today without much of a plan.  The next shelter was 14.7 miles, but that seemed like not enough after a shorter day yesterday.  The day started out like the end of yesterday with a smooth trail winding through some fields and small woods.  Then it went through a cow pasture (up by the way).  After that it was back in the forest and mostly up, but nothing too difficult.  The sun was out, but it was cold this morning.  The clouds rolled in the rest of the day and I was wondering if it was going to rain.  Thankfully it never did.  I wasn’t feeling it today for some reason and my mind was kind of blah.  All of a sudden I looked up (I walk with my head down a lot) and almost missed the sign that said I was one quarter done with the AT.  How about that?  I don’t know if that gave me a kick, but suddenly I felt a lot better.  I also had just eaten a Cliff bar and drank some Gatorade, but who knows.  Instead of stopping at the first shelter, maybe I could keep going for awhile and get to Bland, VA a little earlier in 2 days and take a short day again.  


Even the climbs didn’t feel so bad.  By the way, the trail was boring today - but that’s a good thing. Not many rocks, ruts, or roots.  I did come out to a road and then into another cow pasture where I sat on an old building foundation and took a lunch break.  Of course, the trail wound up some steep hills in the pasture.  This is the fourth or fifth cow pasture on the AT so far and I believe they’ve all been uphill for northbounders.  Why is that?


I got to the shelter and decided with daylight savings time, I have an extra hour to get some more miles in.  Guthooks App shows a campsite another 5.9 miles so I decided to go for it.  When I got to Lick Creek, the bridge was a mangled mess down river about 30 feet from where it used to be.  That means fording the creek.  I took off my boots and socks and put on my Crocs for the crossing.  The water was cold, but only up to my mid-calf at the deepest.  After that, it was 2 more miles to the campsite so I was anxious to be done for the day.  It’s mostly uphill for the final mile and as I crested the last part of the hill, I see a tent and a guy with a light blue jacket.  There’s only one person out here I’ve seen with that jacket and that’s Feral.  As I got closer, I could hear him laughing.  He was laughing , because out of the woods the other way comes NotSoMuch (NSM) who went to get water.  It was his tent that was set up.  He yelled out that it looks like the gang is back together.  I didn’t think I’d see either of them again.  The only reason I caught up to NSM was that he had taken a zero yesterday.  I’ve been ahead of Feral, but he drove his northern car a little farther yesterday then he had been, so our paths crossed again.  Who would have thought it?  I didn’t see a hiker all day long and I show up to an unofficial camp spot on the side of the trail and those two were there.  We caught up while eating dinner and we’ve all got different plans for tomorrow.  NSM will be ahead of me in no time and Feral is hiking south.  Who knows when our paths will cross again.","I-81

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633281,"I’ll start with the positives.  Even though the first 3.8 miles was uphill, the trail was decent and soon opened up into a bald going up Chestnut Knob.  Unlike other balds, this one didn’t have deep muddy rocky ruts to walk in.  It started to sprinkle just as I was leaving my campsite, but quickly stopped.  It was overcast, but chilly - which is not bad weather for hiking.  Ok - that’s about it.  If you want me to stay positive all the time and don’t want to read my whining, then stop here.


Negatives:  Oh where to begin.  After the initial climb up to Chestnut Knob Shelter (yes, atop Chestnut Knob), it started to rain, the wind picked up, and the temperature dropped around 5 degrees it seemed.  Ok, I can deal with that.  The trail then stays on a ridge for about the next eight miles.  Oh good, I thought to myself.  I was able to cruise to a really long day a week ago on a ridge walk.  The difference I soon found out was that this ridge was rocky and the trail was routed pretty much straight up every Knob (peak), and then back down the other side.  Hikers refer to these as “PUDS”, Pointless Up and Downs.  It gets worse.  The ups and downs were steep most of the time.  Wah, Wah, this is the AT.  If it wasn’t difficult, everyone could do it.  That’s right, I get that.  But - yes- it gets worse.  Ok , I’m not exactly a veteran or experienced hiker even though I’m 60.  I do, however, have over 580 miles of AT under my belt.  Of all the trails I’ve hiked (including the AT in GA, NC, TN, and VA), I’ve never (not even close) hiked on a trail in worse shape in my life.  I’m pretty sure if I added all the bushwhacking and walking around blow downs and broken branches today, I could add at least a half mile to my total.  I’m told this section has been this way for awhile.  At first I was annoyed, then I got angry.  I have to admit I don’t know how this section maintenance is funded or who does it, but I do know that it’s going to be a big problem in a couple weeks when the bubble starts to get here.  Someone is going to get hurt.  I have to remind anyone reading this that I’ve thanked the Trail Maintainers up and down when I meet any.  I even sent an email to the Georgia hiking club thanking them for taking such good care of their part of the trail.  Georgia was fantastic.  NC was pretty good and TN was decent.  I passed 4 VA maintainers the other day who were going the other way towards the Grayson Highlands.  They asked if I ran into any blow downs.  I told them no and the trail was in good shape.  I wish they would come over to this section.  Maybe the sections are assigned to different people or clubs - I don’t know.  Please don’t blame it on Covid either.  I didn’t see one other person out here today.  Maybe they depend on volunteers for this section, I don’t know that either.  I am pretty sure the AT gets some money from grants, donations, and membership.  I just hope this section gets some attention soon.  One more negative.  It’s my fault that I misread the Guthooks App and missed getting water before the 8 mile ridge bushwhack.  There was no water until almost to the campground 11 miles ahead.  Too bad for me.  According to the App, there’s a “gushing stream” about a half mile before the shelter.  That’s important, because according to the App, there’s no water at the shelter.  When I get to the gushing creek, it’s dry.  I can see some small pools about 30 yards down the steep bank in the Rhododendrons.  So down I go bushwhacking to have water to cook dinner and breakfast.  About 0.1 miles from the shelter I cross a small creek that’s not shown on the App.  When I get to the shelter, there’s a sign on the wall pointing to a side trail that says “Water”.  Not the best day.  On a positive note, I didn’t go to work today - I spent the day in the forest.","Stealth Campsite

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633324,"Today was one of the best days on the trail.  I’m going to list things in chronological order.
My decision to stop at the shelter paid off because it rained most of the evening.  It started while I was making dinner and was on and off for a couple of hours.It was supposed to be an 11 mile sprint to Bland in the freezing rain this morning.  I woke up to clear skies and I could see stars through the trees. It was cold, but apparently the storms blew out ahead of schedule.The day started with a one mile uphill, but it was a reasonable slope.  As a matter of fact, there were no steep climbs today at all.  Very gradual inclines and switchbacks.  There was a 2 mile stretch of really wide even trail on a gradual decline that was heaven.  I found myself actually smiling while hiking.There were a few blow downs, but not very many.  No rocks, ruts, or roots (or rain).  As a matter of fact, this was the easiest section of trail so far.  I kept thinking maybe keep going in the nice weather and easy trail, but then I had already arranged with Bubba (shuttle driver) to pick me up.  I’m glad I did because he was a nice guy who said last years low trail traffic hit him hard in the wallet.I made great time without even trying and got to US 52 over an hour early.  Better yet, Brushy Mountain Outpost was open!  I ordered a bacon cheeseburger and fries with two regular Cokes.   The helpings were very generous!Bubba was supposed to pick me up at 2, but I called him and asked if he could  get me at 1:30 another mile down trail.  I might as well do another easy mile of road walk today so it’s one less tomorrow if I decide to try to get to Pearisburg in 2 days.  That will be up to the weather and how my feet are holding up.  They really really need to get out of these boots.  I feel it in every step.  I just have to deal with it until Pearisburg where my trail runners are waiting.I checked into the Big Walker Motel.   Unfortunately, they don’t have laundry, so I had to improvise.  
Overall, it was a great day to be hiking on the AT.  Thank you to the VA trail-maintainers for the great trail conditions today.","Jenkins Shelter
","Bland, VA","Mar 16, Tue",12.10
Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633453,"Bubba dropped me off at the trailhead and I started off with a goal of reaching Pearisburg by the next night.  It didn’t rain last night but everything was damp.  The sun had only been up for a short while and it was a bit hazy.  I would guess it was in the low 50s so it was a very comfortable morning.  After about 5 minutes of hiking I noticed something was different.  I could hear song birds.  I don’t remember hearing any birds before - other than an occasional crow or woodpecker.  I have also been startled by grouse a couple times.  I don’t know, but maybe it’s a sign that spring is near.  As the sun rose higher in the sky and was able to penetrate through the trees, the song activity picked up.  The first mile was uphill but not steep, so I was enjoying the atmosphere and it was actually very peaceful.  The first several miles were fairly easy and the trail was in great shape.  A few miles later however, the trail rose high enough that I could now hear the traffic from I-77.  It was nice while it lasted.


The only difficult part of the trail today was a 2 mile rocky ridge walk, but it wasn’t too bad.  Overall today, there were several minor inclines and descents, but very reasonable.  Actually, I dreaded the descents because it accentuated the  pain in my feet.  Man, only one more day until I’m out of these boots.  They served me well in the cold, snow, slush, and on boulders, but I know my feet are getting shredded right now.  The outsides of the boots look like they’ve got more life, but I think the inside support is shot.


After crossing a forest road, there was a sign on the trail indicating the next section is maintained by Roanoke ATC.  It was in great condition with very few obstacles.  Thank you to the Roanoke ATC.


Today’s photo is of the suspension bridge over Kimberling Creek.  It’s an impressive structure and it moves as you walk over it.  It reminded me of the Mini Mac bridge on the Manistee River Trail in northern Michigan.


The last 8 miles seemed to take forever, but I was determined to get to Wapiti Shelter.  That leaves 18 or 19 miles tomorrow, depending on where I get off the trail in Pearisburg.

",Wapiti Shelter,"Mar 17, Wed",25.60
Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633455,"I didn’t mention it in yesterday’s post, but I slept solo in the haunted Wapiti Shelter.  Supposedly, a couple people were murdered there several years ago.  Many posts on the Guthooks App talk about the weird things that happened to people who stayed there alone.  I knew about that ahead of time, but it was supposed to rain all night and I wasn’t about to let the stories stop me from staying dry last night.  When I arrived at the shelter it was a little before 7 pm and dusk was approaching.  I was the only one there.  I didn’t see anything different about it from any other and set up my sleep pad and bag.  My routine is to eat dinner, write my journal on my phone in Notes, submit it if I have a signal (none last night), and then read my book in my sleeping bag until I’m ready to fall asleep.  Everything went normally and no ghosts.  Sometime around 10:30 pm when I was about to fall asleep, I heard something land on the wood floor next to my bag.  After a few minutes, I heard it again.  I was too tired and my feet were too sore to get stressed about it, but I put on my headlamp to see what it was.  They were acorns.  Well - I figured either they fell from a squirrel’s stash in the rafters due to the wind and rain (or mice moving around), or the ghosts were messing with me (no - I didn’t really think that).  I rolled over and tried to go back to sleep.  I heard one more later on, but didn’t bother to check what it was.


It rained all night and pretty much all day today.  I had around 18 miles to Pearisburg, so I got going a little before 8.  There was a 2.5 mile uphill right out of the gate, but I would just as soon get it over with.  It was surprisingly rocky today too, but not terrible.  The frequency of blow downs was higher than yesterday, and it’s tough to get around them when they’re in the rhododendron tunnel.  Still, not terrible.  A few miles before stopping for lunch at Doc’s Knob Shelter, this section looks like a tornado went through.  Some parts were obviously cleared by trail maintainers, and other parts they didn’t get to it yet.  I gained a much greater appreciation for what they do after this section.  Very slow going.  I learned recently that there was a really bad ice storm in mid-February that caused all this (and the 8 mile ridge walk section a couple days ago) damage.  I stopped into the shelter (very nice by the way) and it had a deck with built-in benches and a wood loveseat bench someone put inside the shelter.  I put on dry clothes and ate lunch sitting in comfort.  It poured while I ate btw.  The next section was also in really bad shape, but you could tell the maintainers were able to get started in a few areas - but they have a LOT of work to do.  I’m really impressed with what they do and it seems like they have an endless and thankless job.  The biggest difference between this section and the 8 mile ridge is that today’s section wasn’t dangerous to go around the blow downs.  It just made for slower going on a rainy day.


The last 2 miles into Pearisburg were very steep downhills.  The good thing was the maintainers had cleared this section.  The bad thing was my feet felt every step.  Staying two nights at Angel’s Rest Hiker Haven.  Zero tomorrow.","Wapiti Shelter

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633480,"I was the only one in the bunk house at Angel’s Rest Hiker Haven in Pearisburg last night, but couldn’t sleep well for some reason.  Once it was light, I got up and organized my stuff to see what I can ship home or discard.  The post office didn’t open until 9, so I planned to go get breakfast at Sylvia’s Diner first before picking up my shoes.  When I got to the restaurant, it was dark and closed.  The sign on the door said open, as well as on google maps.  There weren’t many other options, so I hung out for 15 minutes at the post office before heading the other way to the DQ or Hardee’s.  I called both stores and they both said drive-thru only.  Ughh!  So I walked through the DQ (it was closer) drive-thru and sat on the concrete sidewalk near their entry door (out of the wind) and ate my breakfast sandwiches.  I felt like a homeless guy.  I then hit up the Food Lion for resupply.  When I got back to the hostel I was surprised to see Karhop walking into the bathroom/shower house.  I hadn’t seen him since March 4 at the Hostel at 19E.  That wasn’t a good night for me. We watched some NCAA basketball in the common trailer so that was fun.


Doc who runs the hostel is shuttling me tomorrow around the section of AT that’s closed due to downed power lines.  Technically, if part of the AT is closed, you don’t have to come back and do it.  I plan on coming back in the fall and do the closed 15 mile section - in addition to the 5 miles of trail that go around Pearisburg that I didn’t do yet.  I’d have to pay for an extra shuttle to do that 5 miles, so I might as well save it for later.  Therefore, to keep my journal miles aligned with the official AT miles, I’m putting down a fake 20.9 miles for today.  I’ll pick up the trail tomorrow at the 657 mile mark.  if I make it to Mt. Katahdin, there’s no doubt I’ll be back in Pearisburg later this year.","Pearisburg, VA

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633600,"Doc dropped me off at the trail head where we’re allowed to get back on the trail.  It got down to the mid 20s last night so I’m thinking “great - I just shipped one of my down puffy jackets home “.  I should be fine though with the one I still have and my 0 degree bag.  There were two big climbs today.  The first was a 1200 foot gain in a two mile stretch.  The second was a 1800 foot gain over a 3 mile stretch - and was at the end of the day.  The most difficult part of today for me though was a 3 mile stretch of rock trail that ran along the side of the mountain.  I kept thinking it would go up to the ridge, but never did.  It was a good test for my new trail runners though.  I know they won’t last long on rocks, but the Altra Lone Peak 4.5 shoes with the wide toe box and a quarter of the weight of my boots saved me.  I could still feel some of the pain from the damage my boots did, but at the end of the day my feet weren’t throbbing and I had feeling in all my toes.  Man, what a difference they make when going uphill.


I was rewarded after the first climb with a magnificent view of central Virginia from Wind Rock.  I would have liked to eat lunch there in the sun but it was too early in the day.


Later on in the afternoon, I crossed paths with section hiker Wood Fox.  He told me his wife “let him” come out for the weekend for his birthday.  He was planning on doing a 30 mile day today.


I was planning on staying at the Laurel Creek Shelter if nobody else was there.  Otherwise, I’d stay at a campsite 0.6 miles farther.  Nobody was there, so I set up my stuff and made dinner.  Just as I finished changing into my sleeping clothes, a hiker walked up to the shelter.  It was Turtlehawk.  I’ve heard of him and read some of his log entries in the shelter logs.  He started on January 1 and is taking his time.  We had some good conversation and he’s an interesting guy.

",Laurel Creek Shelter,"Mar 20, Sat",18.20
Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633601,"Today had a little bit of everything.  
It got down to the mid to high 20s last night but I stayed warm in my zero degree bag.  The beginning of today’s hike was through a rhododendron tunnel with several creek crossings.  It was mostly downhill for the first 2 miles and changed to hardwood forest after leaving the rhododendrons.  The trail then crossed through four cow pastures - and one of them was even downhill.  I really enjoy walking through the pastures for some reason.  There were cows in the distance but none close by the trail.  As I was in the second pasture, I met Michigan Millie (from Oscoda) going the other way.  She thru hiked most of the trail last year and is making up the sections she missed due to COVID.  I’ve run across several hikers on my trip who are doing that.  After leaving the pastures was a three mile uphill to the ridge line.  The elevation gain was around 2300 feet.  Some parts were fairly steep, but overall it wasn’t bad.  There were some rocky areas during the climb, but also the path had some smooth areas - which was a change from yesterday.


The ridge line lasted about 4.5 miles and required lots of climbing on the sides of boulders.  This impacted my feet after a while because the boulders always slanted downward from left to right.  The views were spectacular here however and I took lots of photos.  I ate lunch sitting in the sun on an outcropping of boulders enjoying the scenery.  Near the end of the ridge walk was a sign that I was crossing the Eastern Continental Divide.  I’ll be honest and admit I never heard of that before.  It meant that the water flow on the left side of the ridge flows to the Mississippi River and Gulf of Mexico, and the water flow on the right side goes to the James River and Atlantic Ocean.


The trail then descends back into a rocky forest.  Then it went through a hardwood forest again.  After a mile or so, it changed to a pine forest.  Finally, after crossing a forest road, I faced a 2.25 mile climb up 1600 feet.  This was mostly in pine forest with lots of switchbacks due to the popularity of this section.  At the top of Brush Mountain is a memorial to Audie Murphy.  He’s the most decorated World War II veteran and died in a plane crash near the site of the monument.  The side trail hike to see it was worth it.


I didn’t see any other thru-hikers today.  I don’t know how far Turtlehawk got.  He was still packing up when I left the shelter this morning.  Beautiful day.  Sunny and in the low 50s.  I pray the weather continues to be good.","Laurel Creek Shelter
",Stealth Campsite,"Mar 21, Sun",19.40
Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633638,"I got a fairly early start because I wanted to get 20 miles in so I’d have a shorter day tomorrow into Daleville and more time to do chores and relax.
I checked and had 2 bars about a mile from the campsite.  Since I didn’t have any for two days, I stopped for 15 minutes to submit my last two journal entries and replied to some texts.  It was another sunny morning, but not as chilly as yesterday.  I was making good time down the mountain even though I was now behind schedule.  I had to ensure I collected water from a good source because many of the creeks are runoff from cow pastures and it’s advised not to use it if you don’t have to.  That means filling the water bottles up to the brim and lugging them up the steep climbs.  In most previous sections of the AT, there was an abundance of water, so I didn’t usually have that added weight up the climbs. Virginia has some long dry stretches without good water sources.


I soon started the long and large boulder navigating trek up to Dragon’s Tooth.  It was very slow going, but the views were great.  After several rocky climbs up knob after knob - each higher than the previous, I finally reached the side trail to Dragon’s Tooth.  I spotted two large backpacks and a red child’s pack leaning against some rocks.  I was pretty sure they belong to the Sutton Family.  They’re an extremely popular YouTubing family and I’ve been slowly catching them for about a week.  I knew they were leaving the trail soon to head back to finish the Smokey Mountains (the high snow drifts made it impassable for their 4 year old son Harvey ‘Little Man’) so I thought I might not catch them in time.  Yes, that’s correct.  He is 4 years old and is hiking the AT.  I’ve wanted to meet them because I think it’s fantastic that they’re able to do this journey together.  I took the side trail and sure enough, it was them.  We had a great conversation and I got a picture of us all from Section Hikers Hobo and 550 from KY.  In return, the Sutton’s did a short interview with me for their YouTube channel.  They asked what was the best part of the trip for me.  Of course the scenery, experiences, and the people - but I gave a quick answer without hesitation that I can eat whatever I want and no diet pop.  I guess I revealed my true inspirations - LOL.  Harvey loves being out on the trail and is a really good hiker.  As a matter of fact, at one point later in the day when they caught up to me while I was eating lunch, the four of us headed out together and I went ahead a bit to not interfere with them, and a mile later I hear my name being called.  It was Harvey.  He ran to catch up with me. I was hiking fairly quickly too because I was behind schedule.  I have no doubt, the Sutton’s will complete the AT.


The trail down from Dragon’s Tooth was kind of fun, but very difficult.  At one point, there were ladder rungs embedded into the rock for hikers to climb down.


I also met another AT maintainer from the Roanoke ATC.  I thanked him multiple times because the trail was in great condition.


As I was parting ways with the Sutton’s, they told me they were being picked up and taken in for the night by a  couple who hiked the AT in 2017 with their 9 month old daughter.  The mom ‘Kanga’ carried their daughter ‘Roo’ for the first half, and the Dad ‘Sherpa’ carried her the rest of the way.  Sherpa and now 4 year old Roo met us on the trail and it was really great to meet all of them.  I can’t imagine hiking with a baby, or even a 4 year old.  They’re better than me for sure because it’s hard enough just taking care of myself.  And then having the time to edit and post YouTube videos.


Anyways - lots of delays and it became apparent I wasn’t going to get 20 miles in.  I decided to stop at the Catawba Shelter for the night.  Section hiker Samual from Missouri was the only one there, but the gnats were unbearable so I set up my tent.  I’m getting up really early to hike up to McAfee Knob - the most photographed spot on the AT.  Unfortunately, it means likely nobody else up there to get my picture sitting on the edge of the outcropped rock.  There wouldn’t likely have been anyone up there at 7:15 pm tonight if I kept going so oh well - maybe next time.","Stealth Campsite

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633689,"I thought about it all night.  It bothered me that my first response to the Sutton’s question about what I enjoyed the most was about eating.  Now don’t get me wrong, eating is one of my favorite things to do.  However, after yesterday and today, I officially change my answer to “The People I’ve met on the AT”.


Yesterday was such a great day, even though I didn’t reach my intended destination.  I couldn’t help stopping and talking to all the wonderful and interesting people I met along the way.  I’ve said multiple times that the purpose of this journal is to document my trip so I can enjoy the memories down the road.  This journey has turned out to be so much more than the scenic views, overcoming the hardships and sacrifices, or even the bragging rights to say I’ve completed the AT ( yes - I know I haven’t completed anything yet).  As much as I wanted to get to McAfee Knob last night before dark, when I was talking with the people I met, missing my target for the night didn’t seem to matter.


Ok - enough of that.  So on to today.
I got up really early (for me) and started hiking in the dark with my headlamp so I could hopefully see the sunrise on McAfee Knob.  I did get there in time, but I wasn’t able to see the sunrise due to the overcast morning.  That’s ok.  I was alone as expected, so I sat on a rock and made coffee and ate a couple of breakfast bars while enjoying the spectacular view.  I was just finishing when X (that’s his trail name) from Worthington, Ohio and his sons Ethan and Aidan arrived.  I jokingly said that I’d make a deal with them and move out of the way for them to get the classic photo on the overhanging rock if they’d take a picture of me.  They were out for a few days doing the loop of trails that is so popular here and the boys are on spring break from school.  We had a fun conversation, but I needed to get going NOBO.


The trail was surprisingly easy for the next few miles.  I ran across Honeydew and War Eagle.  He (War Eagle) is a retired marine and she’s a breast cancer survivor (yes - she kicked cancer’s ass).  They’ve been section hiking since 2012 and were up at Mt. Katahdin a few years ago when the Crawford Family (hiked the AT with 6 kids, including carrying a 2 year old) was finishing.  They were an impressive couple and I’m glad I met them.  


The trail continued to be fairly easy, but then turned into a lot of short rocky ups and downs over knobs.  I was hoping I could cruise into Daleville ahead of schedule, but the AT somehow knows what you’re thinking and sticks it to you.  It was slow going, but I had great views of the Carvin Cove Reservoir and valleys down below.  With 2 miles to go, I was behind a women going fairly slowly and deliberately down the trail.  That’s not a problem and she moved aside for me to pass.  I hiked with her for a short distance and learned that she’s the famous “Grambo” I’ve heard about.  She’s been section hiking the AT for a few years and hoping to complete the entire trail.  She’s said she has 6 months reserved to hike this year.  Ok - what’s so special about that?  SHE’s going to be 77 on March 25!!!  That’s what’s so special.  That’s incredible.  Yesterday I meet the girl who was carried as a baby on a thru hike and current 4 year old stud hiker Harvey Sutton (Little Man), and today I meet a 77 year old.  More impressive is that she’s hiking solo.  My God, this is the hardest thing I’ve ever done, and here’s a 4 year old and 77 year old doing it.  It’s seriously one of the most impressive things I’ve personally witnessed.  What that means to me is added strength when times are tough and I’m out here feeling sorry for myself because I’m lonely, dirty, smelly, or some (or more than one) part of my body hurts.  Thank you to the Sutton’s and Grambo.  You’ve given me some extra incentive to finish this thing.


I don’t want to forget to mention I met flip flop thru-hiker Second Step moving southbound from Harper’s Ferry.  He had a great attitude and I’m betting he completes his journey.


I know my journal entries are always long - but I’m not sorry.  I need to capture this stuff.  I did see more wildlife today than any other day.  I saw multiple gray squirrels, a flock (gaggle???) of wild turkeys, and a herd (at least 7) deer run across the power line.  It was a great day!","Catawba Mountain Shelter Campsites

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633773,"I was in no hurry this morning and was going to walk the half mile to the area that had an Outfitter, Kroger, Wendy’s, and Bojangles.  I was hoping one of the food places had dine-in, but so far Virginia fast food isn’t there yet.  I did get a small, but decent, bagged Continental breakfast from the Super 8, but it wasn’t going to fill me up.  Just in case there would be no more breakfast, I stopped in to the gas station convenience store and got a chocolate protein milk and a honey bun.  I read that honey buns are loaded with calories, so there you go.   As I guessed, no dine-in at the restaurants.  It was lightly drizzling, so I just went into Kroger to start getting my resupply items.  After that, I got some fuel, repair tape, and a couple freeze dried dinners at the outfitter.  They had a decent supply of hiking stuff, but I’m not ready to get anything new - yet.


On the way to the trail was a barbecue sign in the Gas Station window (and the outfitter dude said it as good), I bought a pulled pork barbecue sandwich, chips, and a powerade for lunch.  I wanted to knock out the 11 point something miles to the shelter without stopping to eat anything.  Luckily it stopped raining, so I sat outside on a bench and ate.


It was almost exactly noon when I hit the trail.  It passed under I-81 (for the second time going NOBO).  There was a 3 mile uphill fairly soon in the hike, but it wasn’t steep in most places and had switchbacks.  It was humid though and I was sweating.  After about 7 miles, during a downhill switchback, I could see someone below sitting in the middle of the trail resting.  Like in many places, there’s no place to go around someone due to the trail is cut into the side of the mountain or hill.  I immediately thought it might be JustAFarmer who I met in the Smokeys several weeks ago.  I yelled out “is that JustAFarmer?” and he turned his head and it was.  He started in January sometime, but had to skip past the Smokeys due to snowstorms.  He came back and was hiking through them SOBO when I originally met him.  After he finished the Smokeys, he shuttled back north to resume his trip.  He also took a few days off to go home to a funeral.  I wasn’t sure where he was, but knew he was ahead of me someplace.  We hiked the next 4 miles or so to the Shelter that we were both going to stay at.  It was fun hiking with someone and talking about various topics and the status of other hikers.  By the way, JustAFarmer is another Youtube celebrity.  It’s funny, because I realized soon on this trip, just when you think something, the opposite happens.  For example, if you’re thinking, “yes - this trail section isn’t rocky”, then you just doomed yourself and sure enough - around the bend the trail turns to walking on jagged uneven rocks.  I mention this because JustAFarmer asked me if I fell much.  I said I did in the Smokeys, but not so often now - but I do have close calls and trip over roots and rocks sticking out of the trail a lot.  Not one minute later, we were crossing a stream and my shoe slid sideways on a wet mossy boulder and down I went.  I didn’t land in the water, but both of my shoes and socks got soaked.  I wasn’t about to change them and just kept walking and hoped they would dry out in the late afternoon sun.


We arrived at the shelter just before 5.  I felt it’s too early yet after my late start so I was going to go for awhile longer.  Before I left, we met two local ladies “57” and “WT Sparrow” who were tenting next to the shelter.  They’re section hiking part of the AT in VA.  57 said she’s also a local trail maintainer - so of course we thanked her for all her work.


I kept going and felt good and soon crossed the closed Blue Ridge Parkway.  The trail crossed it a few more times and ran parallel to the road for awhile.  It was starting to get late so I found a good stealth camp site for the night.  The extra miles today should help me get to Glasgow, VA Friday night instead of Saturday morning.  We’ll see how I feel tomorrow.","Daleville, VA

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633870,"I had a great campsite last night because when I woke up I could see the sun starting to come up over the mountains over the Blue Ridge Parkway.  It was hazy, so there wasn’t a great sunrise, but it still looked pretty good while drinking coffee and eating my oatmeal inside my tent.  I should have planned better, because I failed to check the ATWeather website the night before.  There was an 80% chance of rain after 2 pm.  If I wanted to get a big day in, it won’t be as nice in the evening to find a campsite along the trail.  I should have gotten up earlier.


The trail was fairly easy in the morning and crossed a few times and followed along the closed Blue Ridge Parkway.  I don’t know for sure why it’s closed, but I didn’t have to hear all the traffic noise.  The weather was good as well, but a little humid.


I stopped for lunch around 12:30 at the parking lot on Jennings Creek Road after crossing the bridge over Jennings Creek.  I sat on a boulder and ate kind of quickly knowing rain was coming.  There’s a decent uphill (1000 foot gain) right out of the parking lot of course and then right back down.  Just as I was reaching the summit at 1:50 pm, the rain started and the wind picked up.  It rained steadily for the next 4 hours.  Of course it started just before a North Carolina-like 4-1/3 mile long 2400 foot climb.  It was pretty miserable and was steep and slow going.  I finally reached the top of Floyd Mountain and knew the shelter was another two-thirds of a mile.  I really wanted to go a little farther to make tomorrow’s trek to Glasgow a little shorter.  I was already drenched and it wasn’t even 6 pm yet, so I decided to push on another mile or so and find a campsite.  It’s not fun setting up a tent in the rain, but fortunately it was just misting by the time I stopped.  However, the wind was still strong and was blowing rain off the trees on me.  That leaves 18.9 miles tomorrow to the James River bridge where I’ll get a shuttle to town.


I met some people today that I want to mention.  The first guy I came across was Cheesehead (yep - originally from Wisconsin).  He was doing some day hiking after 313 miles of the AT in 2017.  He now lives in Wyoming, but the coincidental thing for me is that he lived in Wooster, Ohio (a couple hours from where I live) for awhile and worked for B&W.  That’s the same company that designed and manufactured part of the power plant I worked at for 37 years.  


I then met Blueray heading south.  He’s flip flopping from Harper’s Ferry and started in March 11.  Here comes another coincidence!  He grew up just south of Romeo, Michigan.  His home mailing address was actually, Washington, Michigan.  By the way, my Mom lives in Washington, Mi.


I also met Action and Adventure (NC) who are heading north towards Maine after they did part of NC and Georgia going southbound in January.  They were joined by their friend Calmate who was just out for a few days.  They stopped at the shelter for the night just before the 4 mile climb.  Bear Bait (central NH) was at the shelter already when we arrived.  I had heard of him, but never met him.   He started on March 15 in Pearisburg and is doing a flip flop.


Last thing to note for today.  I’ve had it with my over-engineered Black Diamond FLZ trekking poles.  I tripped a couple of days ago on the trail and somehow jammed the locking mechanism.  My right pole keeps coming apart.  The locking mechanism secures the 3 parts of the pole, so I had to put gorilla tape around the joints to keep them together.  That isn’t working too well.  I wrote about the trouble with the locking mechanism when it was in the teens while in the Smokeys.  Hopefully there’s an Outfitter in Glasgow.  Disappointed with the poles.","Stealth Campsite near the Blue Ridge Parkway

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633887,"I don’t think I even got four hours of sleep last night in my tent.  It rained pretty hard for most of the night and the wind was roaring.  I was below the wind for the most part though so I actually was hoping it might push the rain system out of the area.  Luckily, the rain stopped around 5 am, but my tent was still getting pelted by droplets from the trees due to the wind.  It was actually fairly warm last night with high humidity.  Everything in my tent was damp except the clothes I was hiking in today which I kept in a waterproof bag.  Since I was going into Glasgow tonight, I just stuffed the wet tent and ground cover into the outside compartment of my backpack.  I’ll dry it out later.  I packed up quickly and didn’t even eat breakfast or make coffee.  I was going to stop at the shelter 4 miles away after the sun came up.


There were a couple of decent uphills today, with the first up to The Guillotine.  Of course I had to get that photo.  When I arrived at the first shelter, Smooth Chain was there and had tented in the rain last night as well.  I found out he started his NOBO on Feb 1 too, but we hadn’t heard of each other.  Weekend hikers Lou and Scott were in the shelter.  Lou is from Arlington, VA and Scott was from Baltimore.  I didn’t stay long due to having lots of miles to go.  The second climb wasn’t that high up, but it was steep and there were lots of blow downs.  I admit I struggled getting up this one.  After that, it was mostly downhill to the James River where you cross on a pedestrian bridge.  Charlie (Pilgrim - 2019  NOBO) was waiting to pick me up.  He got his name because he’s from the Boston area and because he was hiker number 1620.  I’m looking forward to a relaxing night and morning.  I’m probably going to take an easy day and not start hiking until noon.","Stealth Campsite

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633915,"Stanimals Hostel in Glasgow, VA is the nicest hostel I’ve stayed at in this trip.  It’s actually a house.  No shed, no garage (which I’ve been in), a house.  I enjoyed talking to Charlie who runs the place and we had a lot in common.  He was a reactor operator on a nuclear submarine back in the day.  Since I worked at a nuclear power station and had the pleasure of knowing a lot of ex navy nukes, I knew something about what they were required to do.  Also, nuclear power plants are pretty much operated based on the nuclear navy model.


Before I left for the trail, northbound flip flopper Defib came in to the hostel.  He was a really interesting guy and I hope I see him again on the trail.


Charlie dropped me back off at the James River to resume my hike.  Like usual, I planned on a shorter day but was open to going farther if everything was good.  It was only about 10.5 miles to the shelter, but it was supposed to rain at 3 and then overnight.  The last thing I wanted to do was start out the 4 to 5 day section with a wet tent and clothes.  
It’s also a three-part uphill from the James River over the first 9 miles.  It started to drizzle at 2 pm then stopped for a short while.  Just around 3 pm, it started to pour.  It rained hard for an hour with thunder every now and then.  Even with rain gear, I got soaked.  Decision made - the shelter it is.


When I arrived Tall Pine was there and was waiting for his daughter Sunrise who is hiking south from Harper’s Ferry and is doing a flip flop.  She made it to Fontana Dam last year before having to leave the trail due to COVID restrictions.


It’s supposed to rain tomorrow too, so my plan to get to Waynesboro early by hiking a little extra each day may not work out.  I need to not worry about the average miles and just hike what I can.","James River trailhead
",Punch Bowl Shelter,"Mar 27, Sat",10.50
Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633963,"It was a good call to stay in the shelter last night.  Around 3 am, there was a thunderstorm with lightning and some pretty good rain.  ATWeather.org called for rain all day and clearing up in the evening.  The shelter I would stay at if the weather turned bad was 15 miles away, but another 0.6 downhill on a side trail to get there.  I don’t want to have to do an extra 1.2 (uphill tomorrow too) miles if I don’t have to, so I was thinking I’d keep going past it if it’s supposed to clear up.  I can always find someplace to tent if needed.


It drizzled most of the morning, and the trail was mostly downhill.  At one point, the trail followed a creek and there were benches with information boards about people who used to live in this area back in the day.  Man, what a tough life they had.  The stream was swollen from all the rain and there were lots of mini waterfalls and cascades.  I stopped for lunch at a shelter next to the creek and to get out of the rain.  Reluctantly, I packed up and started the 4.6 mile climb (2700 feet) up to Bald Knob.  Of course it rained during the uphill.  I have to admit it was very tiring - especially with 4.5 days of food.


After I finally get to the summit, it drops down almost 600 feet. What does it do next?  Of course it climbs right back up again over 500 feet.  I couldn’t see 100 feet in front of me near the top of Bald Knob due to the fog, mist, and rain.  It was also starting to get windy.  My hope was still that the rain and wind would die down as I got lower in elevation.  I felt ok and knew I could go another 6.5 miles to a creek and pitch my tent so I bypassed the shelter that was 0.6 miles on a side trail (another mistake as you’ll see).  By the way, I was just about out of water too.  Not the best planning on my part, but I didn’t want to lug a second full bottle of water up a 4.6 mile hill if I didn’t have to.


Things were lookin ok - until I got to Cole Mountain Bald.  The wind and rain really started to increase.  Just as I was finally getting back into the trees, the flood gates opened.  It poured as hard as I’ve ever been poured on before.  The temperature instantly dropped and I panicked a bit.  I had my rain jacket on, but didn’t have my rain pants on or my pack rain cover on.  I have everything in waterproof bags in my pack, but I was worried.  As quickly as I could, I put the cover on and zipped my jacket up all the way and kept going.  No use in putting on the rain pants because my shorts, legs, and socks were totally soaked.  No choice but to keep moving and generate heat.  Instead of getting lighter, the rain actually picked up.  The trail was either a river or a small pond, depending on the slope.  Water was gushing down the trail (thankfully this was a downhill section) and I just sloshed through it.  By the time I got down to Hog Camp Gap, I knew I had to find someplace to set up my tent and get out of my wet clothes.  Luckily, there are lots of places to tent there.  Before I set up my tent, I went to the parking area where two guys were standing outside their truck.  The rain had died down by then too.  I asked them if I could buy a bottle of water if they had a spare.  They were pretty cool and gave me one.  At least I could have a hot dinner now.  Turns out, they (Angus and Paul) are from Australia and were out for a couple nights camping.  I was too cold to find out anything more about them, but they saved my butt.  I’m very lucky.


I just looked at ATWeather.org again and the forecast is for a high wind advisory for tonight until 4am with gust as high as 50 mph.  I hope my tent holds out.  I’ll regroup in the morning and formulate a new plan.  There’s water 4 miles ahead, so I’ll be fine.  The low tonight is in the upper 20s.  I’m not sure how much sleep I’ll get.  Lots of mistakes today.","Punch Bowl Shelter

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634067,"The wind was ripping through my tent last night and was so loud it sounded like jet planes on a runway.  I couldn’t sleep partly because of the noise, but mostly because I kept having to sit up quickly whenever my tent poles would get contorted.  They got twisted so much by the hard wind gusts that I feared they would snap.  I was in my tent by 6 pm and the high wind advisory (gusts to 50 mph)  was supposed to last until 4 am.  I accepted that I’d be in for a long night.  I had to go outside in the middle of the night once to batten down my stakes and one even had uprooted and the tent side was flapping out of control.  Finally, around 2 am, I just decided if the poles cracked, they cracked.  I’d still be in the tent and in my bag.  That being said, I probably only slept a total of 2 hours after that.  By the way, at 4 am, it was the same condition as during the night.  The high wind finally settled down around 5:30 am.  My Big Agnes Copper Spur 1 held up through a bad rain storm and severe winds in the last week.


The temperature was in the mid 20s when I started hiking. My trail runners were frozen solid from being drenched yesterday and I had trouble getting them on.  I also had no water, so no breakfast or coffee until I get to the next shelter in 7.6 miles.  I packed up everything as quickly as I could and didn’t even brush my teeth or go the privy (which there wasn’t one by the way).  I just wanted to start moving and warm up.


There were some nice views early on, but they were right into the sun - so no photos.  About 2 miles from the shelter by a creek (finally I can get some water) I came across The Praise Team.  They’re a husband and wife from West Virginia doing a flip flop thru hike.  They started March 11. They were very fun to talk to.  They had heard of me from Ramdino’s Sunday weekly AT hiker status Youtube channel.  I felt funny about that, but I went ahead and we got a picture of the three of us.  I told them I’d see them in an hour or so at the next shelter where I was stopping for brunch.  When I got there, I made some coffee, some chocolate Carnation instant breakfast (first time buying these and they taste great), and a granola bar (and other morning routines). The Praise Team arrived about 20 minutes later.  We continued our conversation and I enjoyed their company.  I stayed almost an hour, but I had a good time meeting them.


Lucky, Lucky, Lucky.  I’ve heard so much about climbing The Priest mountain.  It’s supposed to be brutal - and it is.  But not for NOBOs.  Northbounders have already climbed to elevation and our uphill was nothing like what SOBOs have to do.  Thank you thank you!!!  The downhill for me (uphill for SOBOs) is steep and rocky.  I would have been cursing that climb for sure.  However, when you get to the bottom, a very similar climb up to Three Ridges awaits NOBOs.  One difference though is that the climb up Three Ridges has a few level sections to give your legs a break.  There are no breaks going up The Priest.


I started the climb up Three Ridges around 5:30 pm knowing there’s a shelter about a third of the way up.  If I was whipped, I’d stop for the night.  Otherwise, climb another couple miles to not have to do those tomorrow.  I felt good and kept going.   I did start to worry because the trail was along side of the mountain and required navigating several boulder fields.  No place to camp there.  It was now almost 7:30 pm and getting dark.  If I didn’t find someplace to tent, I’d have to get out my headlamp.  I really didn’t want to find my way over rocks and boulders on the edge of cliffs in the dark.  Luckily, the trail hit a small plateau with a couple small semi-flat  areas where I could set up a tent.  Home for the night - but no cell service again.","Hog Camp Gap

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634072,"Last night was a great contrast to the previous one.  It was completely silent up on the ridge in my tent.  I was treated to a great sunrise this morning too.  Since I was trying to do a long day, I had to get up early.  It was light enough to hike without a headlamp around 6:50 am and I got going just about 7 am.  Good thing I didn’t try night hiking because the two miles up the rest of Three Ridges required proper foot placement on the rocks and boulders.  As a matter of fact, almost all of the first 14 miles of trail today required walking on and over rocks and boulders.  That meant slow going on a day I wanted to hike fast.  It was more frustrating than difficult.


Finally, after coming down Humpback Mountain, the trail started to be less rocky.  I was able to pick up the pace for the rest of the day.  The afternoon also was in an area with lots and lots of day hikers.  Generally (not always), areas with a lot of day hikers are more groomed and easier than other parts of the AT.


I met a lot of people.  First, as I was coming up to the parking lot on the Blue Ridge Parkway, the two Australians (Paul and Angus) were coming the other way.  They were the guys who gave me water two nights ago after the downpour so I could have a hot dinner.  


I met Granny who was doing a gear shakedown hike getting ready for her April thru-hike start.  She’s 67 and has 45 grandchildren.  An amazing women.


For the first time on this trip, I’m staying at a hostel with more than one other person.  I’m at Stanimals in Waynesboro, VA.  Dirty Dan started in October of last year and was off trail for awhile during the winter.  He started back up on March 21 where he left off.

I did get to the outfitters in town (Waynesboro) and bought new trekking poles.  I’d had enough of the Black Diamond FLZs.  I just couldn’t rely on the locking mechanism to work.


I’m heading out tomorrow for Shenandoah National Park.  The trail follows and crosses over Skyline Drive multiple times.  However, most of the perks in this section (Waysides, camp stores, and campgrounds) aren’t open yet, so I have to leave tomorrow with several days of food and a heavy pack.  I’ve never been there before so I’m looking forward to it.  I’m praying for better weather.  It did rain all day today during my day off so I did catch a break.","None

I’m in the shelter myself, but there are 7 other hikers here who are all tenting.  Dirty Dan who I met at Stanimals two nights ago, Jammin (Seattle) and PolySat (Blacksburg) who are southbound flip floppers who started March 15, and three  friends from Virginia (Winger, SBOP, and Billygoat) out for a four day section hike.  They were really fun to talk to and they brought a small amount of wine for a wine tasting (not for us, just themselves) party.  There’s another guy here named David, but I didn’t get a chance to talk with him before he went into his tent for the night.

Not only was it cold, it was really windy.  For only the second time on this trip, I hiked in my down puffy jacket.  It usually makes me sweat so I pretty much only wear it around camp or at night for extra warmth.  Today I kept it on for the entire morning.  There were some really great scenic views early on, but I just took quick photos and put my gloves back on as soon as possible.


Today was a little harder than yesterday.  There were three pretty good climbs that made me work.  None like what I had a week ago, or in NC, but it definitely is not flat in the Shenandoahs.  I only saw a few day hikers today.  Being Good Friday, if it was nice, I bet the trail would have been busy.  Like yesterday, I crossed Skyline Drive several times and usually had a nice view in those spots.  I’d like to come here in the fall, but I bet it’s really crowded.


David from the shelter last night and I leap frogged each other most of the day and I found out he’s Section hiking the Shenandoahs.  He’s from nearby Richmond, VA.


There was only one 2 to 3 mile stretch where there were a lot of blowdown.  I could tell Trail maintainers have been out recently, but must not have gotten to that location.  I also crossed through a quarter mile stretch where there was a fire some time ago.  I couldn’t tell if it was a controlled burn or not or how long ago it happened.  There was some green ground cover sprouting in a few spots so it must have been last year some time.


Of course, one of the hardest climbs was at the end of the day.  When I got to the shelter, a hiker named Grinchy (named by his grandkids) from Massachusetts was there.  He started in Harper’s Ferry on March 23.  Soon after I arrived, Dirty Dan and David showed up.  All four of us are staying in the shelter because it’s supposed to be cold again.  We even got a fire tonight, so hopefully that will help.


By the way, I have been using some terms that some of my friends and family don’t know.
NOBO - Northbound (GA to Maine)
SOBO - Southbound (Maine to GA)
Flip Flop - Start somewhere in between.  When you get to the end, you go back to where you started and go the other way.  Or, you go to the other terminus and hike to where you originally started. There’s no set way to flip flop.","Blackrock Hut

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634263,"I knew I needed to get going early if there was any possibility of resupplying at the Big Meadows Wayside or Big Meadows Campground Store.  Both close at 5 pm - I think.  That’s if they’re even open.  They’re both just under 20 miles away and I couldn’t confirm on the Guthooks App if they’re open - and if they were, do they have what I need to stay on the trail another day or two?  I packed 4 days of food with the plan to stay at Open Arms Hostel near Luray, VA on Sunday night.  There’s another hostel a day and a half (or one really long day) farther.  What to do.


It was cold this morning and I didn’t want to leave my bag.  Finally Grinchy made the move, and I followed.  Dirty Dan came out shortly thereafter, but David said he’s staying for awhile.  My fingers were so cold again that I didn’t eat or even brush my teeth.  Gross right?  I needed to use the privy, but my fingers were numb and couldn’t get the plastic baggy open on my toiletries and needed Grinchy to open it for me.  After that, I needed to get moving and warm up.  Yes - I brushed my teeth a little while later after warming up and finding a sunny spot to set my pack down.


Today was a lot rockier and had more uphills and downhills than the first two days of the park, but again, nothing too serious.  I did get a sweat going though, so the inclines made me work.


Just after lunch, I came over a hill and saw a campground to my left with lots of car campers.  I decided to head over to ask the closest group if they came into the park from the north, and if so, did they notice if the Big Meadows Wayside was open.  Of course the first 4 groups all came into the park from the south and didn’t know.  One guy in the last group said he hiked the AT in 1981 and 1982 and was called Hungry Ted.  He offered me a Knorr meal and a small pack of chocolate gram crackers.  I wasn’t asking for food, but he insisted.  He said he knew how hungry thru-hikers get.  I accepted graciously and headed back to the trail.  Trail Magic for the second time on my trip - yes!


The AT doesn’t go by the Big Meadow Wayside and is 0.4 miles off trail to get there.  That means adding 0.8 miles to my day for nothing if it’s not open.  As I was trudging forward, I asked myself why I would want to change my original plan and add a day or two before stopping at a hostel.  I also felt a minor pain in my right knee every now and then.  So as soon as I had a cell signal, I called Open Arms Hostel and reserved a bunk for tomorrow (Sunday) night and stick to my plan.  That means I don’t need to resupply at the Wayside or the camp store (another mile up a steep hill) after the side trail to the Wayside.  However, the possibility of a soda and junk food was too much to overcome.  When I got to the side trail, I took it up to Skyline Drive.  When I turned left and started walking the road, I could see a bunch of cars parked at the Wayside.  Yes!!!  The restaurant wasn’t open (I knew that part),  but their store was.  They had pretty much anything a convenience store had.  I picked out two 20 oz Cokes, a can of Pringles, a double size Snickers, and a double size Three Musketeers.  I downed one coke in the parking lot and packed the rest in my pack for the campground or shelter (if I decided to go a few more miles).  


After getting back to the trail (like I said before, it’s a mile uphill to the campground), I was a bit worried if there would be room at the campground since Skyline Drive was busy.  The Wayside and every parking lot I passed by today was also busy.  When I got to the top and saw the numerous number of people and tents set up near each other, I decided not to stay there - even though there probably were some open sites.  Being by all those people didn’t appeal to me at all.  It was another 3.7 to the shelter and it was only 5 pm.  The sun was shining and it was in the low 50s.  I’d just take my time and get there when I get there.  The plan was to share the snacks with Dirty Dan at the shelter (I mean hut).


I was almost there when coming the other way was Ollie (2019 thru-hiker from Massachusetts) and Pipas (2019 most of the AT) from Texas.  They were hiking the 300 plus miles that Pipas didn’t finish in 2019.  They were fun to talk to and glad I met them.  By the way, the hike to the shelter was along the side of the mountain with great views almost the entire way.


When I got to Rock Spring Hut, there was a group of six weekend hikers from the DC area there.  Most were tenting, but I wanted to tent tonight anyway and take my time getting going tomorrow since it’s going to be a shorter day.  They’re part of a Backpacking Meetup group called DCUL (DC Umtralight).  The hikers were BA, Dave, Alex, Wolverine, Smoke Magnet, and Heavy D.  We had an interesting conversation as I ate a late dinner at the picnic table while they stood around the fire.  They’re out for a long weekend and heading to their homes tomorrow.  They’re starting really early tomorrow and I’m not.  Dirty Dan never showed up, so I drank the entire second Coke, ate the Knorr meal that Hungry Ted gave me, ate the entire can of Pringles, and both pieces of the Three Musketeers.  I’ll save the Snickers for tomorrow lunch as my Easter candy.  I think my hiker hunger has kicked in.","Hightop Hut
",Rock Spring Hut,"Apr 03, Sat",23.90
Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634310,"When I woke this morning in my tent, I packed up everything I could before heading to the Hut to make breakfast.  It was a tropical 36 degrees, but the wind kicked up a bit and made it just a little too uncomfortable to linger.  I only needed to do 14.1 miles so I didn’t have to get up really early and bust out of camp.  As I rounded the corner (my tent was behind the back of the shelter on a hill) to set up my cook pot, who do I see but Dirty Dan.  He got in to camp around 8:30 last night after I went into my tent.  I told him I had some Coke and snacks to share with him, but since he didn’t show, I ate them all.  Then I remembered I had the super large Snickers bar in my food bag, so I gave it to him for Easter.  I was going to a hostel that night and he was staying on the trail.  So - I gave away my Easter candy.  That’s ok and the look in his eyes when I handed it to him was priceless.


Not long after I got going, I hit a section of trail that ran along the north side of a mountain for several miles.  It was pretty rocky and slow going.  The worst part was the sun wasn’t reaching me and there were icicles on the side of the trail and the wind chill was probably in the 20s.  I ran into several day hikers early on as well - including Muffin and Doughnut (wife and husband) from Frederick, MD.  They used to live in Cleveland so we had a lot to talk about.  Plus their son lives in the Detroit area not that far from where I grew up.  I talked with them for too long (even though they were very interesting to get to know) and had to get moving to catch my 3 pm shuttle.  The trail continued being rocky and windy cold - but not bitter cold.  Just cold enough to leave my windbreaker on.  The best part, was there was great scenery all morning - and most of the day actually.  The worst part was it was a rocky trail and slow going.  Plus I had to walk with my head down and couldn’t risk looking at the views or I’d turn an ankle or trip for sure.  I trip constantly over rocks even when I’m paying attention.  I think I said previously that the trail crosses over Skyline Drive many times throughout SNP.  I came out to the road and crossed it only to see a big orange sign across the trail that said Detour - and pointed to follow Skyline Drive to the left.  The detour then cut left down another road where the rental cabins (more like condos) were.  It was hard to follow the detour because many of the brown plastic markers were blown over.  The detour finally reconnected with the AT and it was a lot of up.  I crossed paths with Rocket from PA who was doing a section hike and has been knocking off sections since 2007.


I was also slowed by the multitude of day hikers out on the trail.  Most of the trail was only wide enough for one person to pass so I kept having to move to the side for them.  They have a right to be there, but it wasn’t that long ago where I wouldn’t see another human all day.  I finally got to VA 211 and was waiting for my ride to the hostel.  My shuttle was running late and I was just standing there (nowhere to sit) watching the busy traffic go by on VA 211, when I see Secret Agent come out of the trail on the other side of the road.  When she started to go, I thought she looked like the Frogger game.  She crossed safely and I went over to greet her.  Turns out she is staying at Open Arms too.  She’s from Vermont and has completed approximately 1500 miles of the trail since 2018.


Since my shuttle was 30 minutes late, she offered to give me a ride back to the hostel. Her car was parked just down the road at a trail head.


Once I was there, I met Dino and Salmon who are moving south doing a flip flop hike.  They’re from VA and started on March 11.


I’m hoping to get out of VA soon and went to resupply accordingly.  Of course I bought too much food, but better to much than too little.","Rock Spring Hut

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634360,"Alison from Open Arms Hostel dropped me off at the trail head where I got off yesterday.  It was an immediate, but fairly mild, uphill for a mile or so.  Then, the trail was fairly level and through a pine forest.  It was almost relaxing because all I had to do was walk.  I didn’t have to focus on the ground to avoid any rocks or boulders.  Of course that didn’t last, but it was a really nice break.  Before too long, the trail comes out to Skyline Drive ( for the hundredth time).  But this time was different.  Only 0.1 miles down the road was Elkwood Wayside - and it was open.  It was a little early for lunch, and I had enough food.  But, I decided to go check it out anyway.  I’m glad I did.  They had picnic tables in the grass out in the sun.  I went into the store and bought a cold Pepsi (not diet!) and bag of Cheese Pretzel Combos to have with my tortillas and peanut butter.   I was in the middle of eating when out of the forest towards the store comes Dirty Dan.  He didn’t go to the hostel last night and stayed on the trail.  He sat down and we caught up on trail news while we ate.


Since I was there awhile before he was, I took off - knowing I had a long way to go yet today.  The trail was typical of the Shenandoah’s.  There were some decent uphills of 500 to 800 feet, but not to steep.  There were some rocky sections today though.  


Along the way I met a few hikers worth noting.  Ounce and Bluegrass from Lynchburg were hiking the park from end to end.  Ounce did the AT in 2003 and Bluegrass in 2013.  Bluegrass hikes with his dog Bella, who also did the AT with him in 2017.


Erin from VA was hiking south from Harper’s Ferry, then plans to flip back to Harper’s Ferry and go north.


Dr. J was doing a flip flop as well, but recently started at the north end of the park.  He did the trail in 2017 and is out doing it again.  He’s from Endicotte, NY.


The final few miles of the Shenandoahs were the easiest.  The AT is on a fire service road for awhile.  It then veers off the road to the left for a few tenths before coming to the permit kiosk (see photo).  I finally got out of the park.  It took five days of about 20 miles per day to go through.  Not too bad considering the weather wasn’t the greatest early on.  


Almost immediately after leaving the park, the terrain changed to large boulders and rocks.  So much for easy hiking on a forest road.  I made it to the Tom Floyd Wayside around 7 pm.  Yep - this shelter is called a Wayside.  I have no idea why.  It does have a deck and we (Dirty Dan is here too) can see the lights down below of Front Royal, VA. it’s also fairly mild out tonight.  I forgot to mention today’s weather was fantastic.  Mid 60s and sunny!","VA 211 and Open Arms Hostel
",Tom Floyd Wayside,"Apr 05, Mon",24.80
Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634413,"Dirty Dan and I woke up in the shelter around the same time (7 am), but neither of us was in much of a hurry.  We had all day to do a little more than 18 miles to get to Whiskey Hollow Shelter.  Since it was supposed to be sunny all day, that meant we could even hike until 8 pm if needed.  I decided that I would make breakfast and coffee and sit on the shelter deck before packing up this time.  The sun was already up and the birds were awake.  It was actually pretty enjoyable.  But I did need to get moving so that I’d get to the next spot at a decent time without rushing.


It was downhill and rocky to start off the day.  Fortunately the rocks ended soon and the trail was smooth and easy for the next several miles.  A large group of 16 day hikers were charging up the mountain and were strung out pretty far apart.  Uphill has the right of way, so I’d just move over and let them pass.  After reaching the trail head at the bottom, I had to cross a busy road and then follow a long grassy uphill.  In the next section, there were two couples hiking fairly close together, but were not together.  All four were hiking south starting from Harper’s Ferry, then were going to return to HF and go north.  By the way, just to be clear, flip floppers don’t typically turn around and hike back to where they started.  They drive, fly, or however back and restart their hike in the other direction.  I was asked about that.  Kat and her friend (didn’t get a name) from Charlottesville (started Apr 1), VA and Sam and Emma from Buffalo (Apr 2) were their names.


Shortly thereafter, Dirty Dan caught up to me and passed.  I told him if he found a good shady spot with a log or boulder to sit on, I would stop for lunch.  Five minutes later, I came around a bend and he had found a good lunch spot next to a country road.  We ate and talked about what each of us might do in the next day or so, and also how great an ice cold beer in a frosty mug sounded.  It was almost 70 degrees and sunny - so it sounded great!  I was done first and took off - knowing he’d catch me before too long.  As I was hiking, I heard the traffic on I-66 below.  After checking the Guthooks App, it said that the small town of Linden, VA was 1.2 miles to the west on a parallel road to the freeway and had a grocery store.  I had an idea.  We’ve still got a lot of time, so maybe try to hitch a ride from the trail and get a cold beer?  As I started to slow down to let Dan catch me quicker, up the trail came Jim from Marysville, PA.  He was hiking up to meet his wife, Mosiac Mama who is Section hiking.  She started doing sections in 2017.  When Dan caught up, I asked him what he thought of my idea and he gave an emphatic “yes”.  Of course the road was slightly uphill to town, and of course nobody stopped to pick us up.  I’m zero for three on attempted hitchhiking.  The store was open and we bought one tall one each and ask the clerk if it was alright if we sat in the shade on the side and drank them.  She said they have tables and chairs and a fire pit out back for hikers - and we could sign their wall.  It wasn’t anything fancy, but it felt great to sit down - and the beer was really cold.  We signed the wall and sat back down to finish the last of our beer when a guy pulled into the driveway by us and his dog jumped out and came over to check us out.  She hung out for awhile, so I yelled to the guy and asked what her name was.  He came over too and sat down with us and started to chat.  His name was Brian and the dog was Etta.  Turns out Brian is a bass player who’s played with several famous people and has done a lot of touring.  He’s also worked on Porsches for a living.  He was a pretty interesting guy and we enjoyed hearing his stories.  He offered to drive us up the mountain to the campground we were going to stay at (a mile past the shelter) and asked us if we wanted to “cheat”.  We said no thanks, but a ride back to the trailhead would be awesome.  His girlfriend Joy worked in the store and joined us for the ride back.  They were cool people and down to earth.


After not eating much and hiking 10 miles in the sun, the beer hit both of us pretty good.  We weren’t drunk by any means, but definitely had something going on.  The first mile was a fairly steep uphill, and I sweated profusely.  After drinking a lot of water, I gradually returned to normal and chugged on to finish for the day.  We decided to hike an extra mile (which was up) past the shelter to a campsite to make tomorrow a little easier.  Dan and I actually hiked together for a few miles today and I enjoyed the conversation.  It’s funny, because in any other situation, we most likely wouldn’t have much in common.  He’s less than half my age, he’s from Knoxville, and is an auto mechanic.  He hiked for a couple months last fall from Georgia until the weather got too bad, and then resumed in Daleville, VA a week or so ago where he left off.  He’s faster than me, but like with Evergreen, we seem to end up in the same spot at the end of the day.","Tom Floyd Wayside

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634464,"It was a great night at the campsite and my decision to not put on my tent rainfly paid off.  It wasn’t a clear view through my mesh tent, but I could see the stars above.  It probably got down only to the low 40s and was pretty comfortable last night.  As a matter of fact, it was warm enough that the gnats and flies were out in the morning and were slightly irritating while packing up.  It was only 17 miles or so to the Bears Den Hostel, but I wanted to get there as early as possible so I got on the trail by 7:15 am.  The first 4 or 5 miles were walking through the Sky Meadows State Park and was in a meadow for quite a ways.  Very easy hiking.  I eventually got to the southern end (start) of the “Roller Coaster” section.   It’s approximately 15 miles of up and down hiking over successive peaks.  Most are between 400 and 700 feet, but are pretty steep.  The first peak wasn’t bad, but the second one was a little tougher.  I decided to stop for a lunch break on the second peak.  There wasn’t much of a view through the scrubby trees, but it was good to take a break.  Shortly thereafter, I passed the 1000 mile mark.  No signs or sticks on the trail spelling out 1000, but it felt good to reach that milestone.  The next several peaks were pretty tough, mostly because they’re a steep grade and it was in the upper 70s. I’m not used to that yet.  I sweated profusely this afternoon and drank a ton of water.  Luckily, there was a spring at the bottom of every hill, so water was readily available.  It’s got to be a lot harder in the heat of the summer.


While hiking the roller coaster, I passed several section hikers who were staying at the same hostel tonight.  Garrett, Kevin, and Aquaman are all from VA and were with Tony from St. Louis.  They’re friends who are knocking out sections of the AT.  We had fun talking with them at the Bear Chase brewery and then again back at the hostel.  Lots of humorous stories.  By the way, Dirty Dan and I walked the half mile or so from the hostel to the brewery.  It was fairly new and was set on the side of a mountain with acres of grassy area with numerous lawn chairs, fire pits, tables - all with a phenomenal view of the mountains on the horizon and the valley below.  The craft beer was average, but the setting was a 10 out of 10.  We’ve got a 20.5 mile day tomorrow to get to Harper’s Ferry, but I’m not sure how early we’ll get on the trail.  Still 5 miles of the roller coaster to finish, but it’s supposed to be easy hiking from there to town.  We’ll see.  Hopefully, we’ll be out of Virginia tomorrow and then into West Virginia.","Campsite

I had to complete the last three climbs of the roller coaster early today and then there were some easy walking sections  for sure, but it seemed like most of the trail, especially before Harper’s Ferry were really rocky.  I still made good time and got into town before 5 pm.


We’re staying at the Quality Inn in HP. The good news is that it’s right next to the trail.  The bad news is that there’s nothing around it.  It’s over a mile to down town Harper’s Ferry, but there are not any hostels or hotels down there either.  I have tentative plans that a trail angel will be picking Dirty Dan and myself up tomorrow to get breakfast and resupply.  I’ll write about that tomorrow.


Several day hikers today due to the nice weather.  I did run across Phoenix who was taking a break in a sunny spot.  She just started yesterday from Harper’s Ferry and is planning on going to Springer Mountain.  She’s previously hiked part of the trail in the north and is trying to fill the gaps.  She is from Annapolis, MD.


A couple milestones today.  I finished the roller coaster and finally completed Virginia.  I entered on March 8, and left on April 8.  31 days.  It worked out to approximately 17.9 miles per day.  Tomorrow when I cross the Potomac River, I’ll have completed West Virginia too.","Bears Den Hostel

I also spent a few minutes on the trail talking to section hikers Erik and Casey who were out for the weekend from Boonsboro.


It’s supposed to rain tonight, tomorrow, and tomorrow night.  I’m hoping for the best.Thank you again The Real Deal.  It was great to meet you and appreciate all that you did for us and for the hundred others you said you help each year.","Harper’s Ferry

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634605,"I’m having a difficult time figuring out Maryland.  So many people have said it’s the easiest state.  In my opinion, the easiest parts of MD have been the easiest of anywhere on the trail.  But, the rocky sections in the north end of the state seemed as difficult to me as any other section thus far.  I’m not saying it’s harder than going up Albert Mountain, but to me, it’s worthy of mentioning in the same sentence.  I was caught between shelters today.  It was either 20 miles or 30 if I wanted to stay in a shelter tonight.  It’s a 90% chance of rain and thunderstorms, so I’d rather not tent if I didn’t have to.  The carrot on the end of the stick is a burger and ice cream store near the trail tomorrow (43 miles from my starting point today) - and the hostel I’m going to stay at tomorrow is just a little farther down the road.  It’s also supposed to rain all day tomorrow.  So - what were my options?  
Hike 20 miles today to the shelter and another 23 tomorrow in the rain.Hike 30 miles today - that’s stupid.  Stop typing now!  That’s not an option.Hike 22 to 25 and tent at a stealth site leaving an 18 to 21 mile day in the rain tomorrow.This 4th option didn’t materialize until I stopped for a short lunch.  If I hike to the MD-PA line and call a shuttle and stay at Soolah’s Sunflower Cottage, that would be 25.6 miles today and less than 18 tomorrow.  I did have time since I left early today.  There’s also a dine-in pizza place down the street from the cottage - and Soolah said she would pick me up instead of paying a shuttle.  Decision made!!!!  I’ll choose Door No. 4.


It’s still a long day tomorrow in the rain, but at least I don’t have to pack up my wet tent (while it’s raining) and lug the extra water weight and deal with drying it at the hostel.  


It was overcast pretty much all day, so I didn’t even bother checking out any of the overlooks.  I did take the extra couple minute walk to see the Washington Monument at the State Park.  It’s a pretty nice park and fine tribute to George Washington.  I took a few photos and read some of the info, but everything was fogged in so no views.  I would really like to come back to this area of MD some time and check out all the historical markers, landmarks, and battlefields.  There’s a ton of Civil War things to see around here that seem fascinating.


Today also marked the second time I walked on part of the AT I was on before.  The first time was 50 yards of the AT going north out of Newfound Gap when I was on vacation in 1988.  Today I walked over I-70 on a foot bridge.  I walked over this bridge about 25 years ago on my way home from DC.  I had gotten off I-70 to check it out but had no thoughts of hiking the AT back then.  The walk over the expressway today was uneventful by the way.


Lots and lots of day hikers today (Saturday) and I had an observation.  Not EVERYONE - ok - but the majority of Maryland people I crossed paths with today were the least friendly people of all the states I’ve been in so far.  Many times two hikers would walk side-by-side and make no attempt to let me stay on the trail. I don’t try and have a conversation with everyone, but if they make eye contact, I’ll say Good Morning.  More than half of the people today didn’t even look up.  Many others didn’t reply good morning back after I would greet them.  By the afternoon, I pretty much just kept my head down and hiked when passing day hikers.  They’re not wrong or bad people, it’s just different from what I’m used to prior to this.


There were a lot  of hikers out this weekend doing the MD section of the AT.  I talked with Weezy-pee from PA who has hiked 80% of the trail once, and the other 20% twice.  She had her dog Boots with her and he was carrying a dog pack and was out for his first overnighter.  I also met friendly Marylanders Step and Captain who are section hiking from the PA-MD border to Harper’s Ferry.  I enjoyed talking to all three of them and that’s why they’re being mentioned here.  Pizza tonight and ice cream and a cheeseburger tomorrow.  Funny how food influence my hiking decisions.  It is what it is!","Old Rocky Run Shelter

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634666,"I slept pretty well last night in the Sunflower Cottage.  I was the only one there and the bunk had a very cushy mattress.  The heat (space heater) wasn’t on, but I slept in my puffy jacket and was very comfortable.  It rained very heavily most of the night so I was happy with my decision.  It was still raining in the morning when I made myself get up.  I grudgingly put on my hiking clothes and packed most of my pack before eating my two leftover slices of pizza from last night.  I started eating the first one and it just wasn’t tasting all that great - but I knew I had to eat.  Just as I started to eat the second slice, Soolah knocked on the door and said she brought my breakfast.  Wow!  I didn’t know breakfast was included.  Soolah made eggs fresh from her hen house (next to the cottage), homemade cinnamon bread using her Grandmothers recipe, 4 pieces of smoked sausage, and a cup of coffee with a few drops of maple syrup in it.  It was all delicious.  A bed, two shuttles, and breakfast - all for only $25.  And I didn’t have a wet tent!!!


Soolah dropped me off a little after 8 am to start my hike for the day.  The rain stopped, but it looked like it could dump on me at any time.  It never did though.  After about 4 hours, the sun started to come out in the mostly cloudy sky.  It never got too warm today and was actually a pretty enjoyable day.  There were some rocky areas and one near-1000 foot uphill, but most of the elevation gain was over a couple miles.  I ate so much for breakfast that I didn’t stop for lunch.  I just had a couple Cliff bars throughout the day.  I finally got to US Rt 30 around 3:30 pm and hit the road for the 0.3 mile walk to Bonfire Burgers and Ice Cream.  They had picnic tables outside so I didn’t need to worry about in-store dining.  I ordered a cheeseburger with fries, strawberry milkshake, and a coke.  I’m sure I ate it all too fast, but it tasted great.  The Guthooks App shows Trail of Hope Hostel 0.8 miles farther down the road.  After approximately 0.2 miles from the restaurant, I passed a ministry building and it had a sign that said “Welcome Hikers”.  This hostel (sign had some other name) wasn’t on the Guthooks App or in the AT guidebook.  I kept going (slightly uphill of course) for the next 0.6 miles until the App said I was there.  The only problem was that there was a used car lot at that location.  I called the hostel and was told they have a new name now and the one I passed awhile ago is the right place.  I ended up walking 1.2 miles extra today because I didn’t call earlier.


After getting settled, I was invited to attend the 6:15 pm Bible Study Class at the ministry center (actually it was the room next to the bunk room and I would have to walk through the class to use the bathroom or to get outside).  I decided to attend.  It was pretty interesting and I’m glad I stayed.  It lasted until 7:30 pm which left plenty of time to walk back to get a hot dog and another shake for my late dinner (the other one was a late lunch).  The restaurant closes at 9 pm.  Before leaving, I took a few minutes to talk to a couple hikers in the bunk room.   I arrived at the burger and ice cream store at 8:05 pm and the workers were still inside, but the door was locked.  I knocked on the door (which has a sign that says Open Tues through Sunday 11 am to 9 pm) to let them know the door was locked.  One of the guys opened a slide window and said he’s sorry but they’re closed.  I pointed at the sign on their door and he said “those were the hours before COVID”.  What?  Does the spread of the disease increase after 8 pm?  I don’t know why these kinds of problems keep happening.  That’s more than 1.5 extra miles of walking today.


On a good note, after one day, hikers on the PA section of the AT are pretty friendly.  Very early on, I met Chris and Allana from Chambersburg, PA practicing for a 2023 thru-hike.  At the hostel, I also met Traverse and Bean Buster from Wisconsin who are doing their third long section hike (approx 500 miles each) in their 5 year plan to do the entire trail.  They’re heading north tomorrow as well, so I might see them again.","Pen-Mar Road and Sunflower Cottage

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634730,"Like several times on this trip, I had the bunk room at the hostel to myself.  I was in no hurry to leave since I only needed to hike 16 or 17 miles to Toms Run Shelter.  However, it was supposed to start raining at 2 pm, so the sooner I hit the trail, the less hiking in the rain I had to do.  I was up a little after 6 am out of habit (and due to nature calls) so I just started leisurely packing up.  Then I went to see what I could find in the kitchen for breakfast.  I wasn’t about to make a full breakfast because that means I would have to clean a bunch of dishes - so simple is better.  I was just finishing up when Sister Tina came in for the day.  We talked for awhile and then Traverse and Bean Buster came down from their private room. The next thing you know, it was 9:30 am.  I hurried up and got ready and headed down the road 0.8 miles to get back to the trail.    It was a dreary day and the trail was as easy as any day so far.  The uphills were pretty tame and the rocks weren’t too bad anywhere.  There were, however, a few flooded areas that required a lot walking on the slanted edge of the trail to avoid soaking my feet.  I made good time and arrived at the shelter at 4:20 pm.  Probably because I went to Bible Study last night, it never did rain on me - until I made the decision to keep going.  I knew I was going to be ahead of schedule and planned to hike a few more hours and find a stealth site.  However, a hiker at Toms Run Shelter asked me if I was going to “the hostel”.  I asked which hostel he was referring to and he replied the Ironmasters Mansion.  According to Guthooks and the hostel website, they’re not opening until late spring.  He said it’s open because he stayed there last night and it’s only 3.6 more miles.  I decided to stay there if it’s open and it’s right on the trail - and it’s supposed to rain again tonight.  Not 5 minutes after leaving the shelter, it started to rain.  Also, the trail was flooded for the next two miles or so.  After a mile of trying to not step in the ankle deep water, I just said forget it and started charging through.  Just before the hostel, the trail goes onto a park road in Pine Grove Furnace State Park.  As I was approaching the building, Dirty Dan walks out onto the deck above and yells my name.  We meet again it seems.  I later found out that the famous ice cream challenge is held at this state park at their general store, but it’s only open on the weekends this time of year.  That’s disappointing because I really wanted to try this famous AT experience.  


There were only a few hikers at the hostel - including Dave from San Diego (originally from the Detroit area).  He was a 2012 NOBO but broke his ankle after 1000 miles.  He came back this year and restarted on April 5 where he left off.


I do pass three different markers claiming to be the halfway point.  The one in the photo above I believe is the correct one for 2021.  The others were for earlier years when the trail was shorter. The length gets a little longer each time they add switchbacks rather than hiking straight up steep climbs.  Personally, I’ll take some extra distance over steepness.","Trail of Hope Hostel

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634810,"I decided yesterday that I need to take a day off tomorrow and stay at a hotel.  But to do that, I’d have to do my longest day yet.  I targeted Carlisle, PA due to it has multiple hotel and food options.  The Guthooks App says there are some bad rocky sections and some boulder scrambling - so I needed to get on the trail by 7 am to finish the day at a decent time.  Actually, I walked out the hostel door at 6:59 am.  The first thing you come to as you’re leaving the hostel is the Pine Grove Furnace State Park General store.  This is the location of the great ice cream challenge. Unfortunately, this time of year they’re only open on weekends.  The photo above is of me not participating in the famous tradition.


I don’t know if it rained or not last night, but like the last few days, everything was saturated.  It was basically another gloomy day.  The initial 2 miles today was a gradual uphill walking in a creek. Then just before noon was the beginning of what looked like what I would call the mini-Roller Coaster.  There were some steep ups and downs, and lots of boulder scrambling on the first two peaks.  After a short lunch break osirting on a large boulder in the shade, the trail and peaks got easier.   Then, gradually over the next few miles, the trail got less and less rocky and was mostly downhill off the ridge.  I wound around a bend and the trail came out of the very brown forest.  I looked up and then from left to right and saw an expansive bright green grassy field. Just like that, the trail left the woods and took me through approximately 2 miles through a fresh green field that smelled like spring.  It was early afternoon and the sun was shining.  It’s difficult to describe, but it was sort of uplifting.  After walking day after day looking at the ground to not break an ankle on a sharp rocky trail, I was able to look around and simply put one foot in front of the other without thinking about it.  Hiking the AT isn’t just walking 2,195 miles.  It requires constant focus that can wear on you mentally after awhile.  There’s very little mindless walking during a given day. I enjoyed it while it lasted, because in about 2 or 3 days, the rockiest sections on the entire trail are coming up.  Northern PA is known as “Rocksylvania” by AT hikers.  It’s days on end of nothing but working your way over rocks.


After the field walking ended, the trail runs through the small town of Boiling Springs, PA.  Then - it’s a pretty flat and easy 8 mile walk through more fields and some woods and is a farming area - which means no mountains and very few rocks.  I finally came to the road crossing where the hotel is that I’m staying at tonight and probably tomorrow for a needed day off.  Not much scenery again today, but with the distance covered, I’ll take the easier trail today  for sure.","Ironmasters Mansion Hostel

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635069,"I haven’t posted in a few days due to I was too tired the first night and then no cell service the last two nights.  I got out of my warm and comfortable hotel bed around 6 am.  The plan was to get dressed and go next door to the Middlesex Diner for breakfast.  It’s a great restaurant and it will be the third time I’ve eaten there since Wednesday night.  Chocolate chip pancakes sounded good so I ordered a large stack.  Since it’s only 17.5 to Duncannon, I’d just eat a couple snacks on the trail and then a late lunch in town (or large early dinner).  After a 0.3 mile road walk back to the trail, it resumed the long and mostly flat dirt easy going that it was yesterday afternoon.  After a mile or so, the trail passes through grassy fields.  It was a matter of seconds until my socks and shoes were soaked from the dew.  Not much I could do about it so I just kept moving.  Eventually, the next mountain came and up I went.  At least there were switchbacks.  I didn’t talk with any of them, but there was a mom, dad, teenage son, and dog running up the mountain, and then back down.  I don’t know how they don’t break an ankle or foot bone on the rocks, but they seemed to be moving fairly quickly.


I met Mountain Drew from PA up on the ridge moving southbound.  He started at Delaware Water Gap (NJ/PA border) on March 23 and is trying to do a flip flop thru-hike.  He started his trip at about the most difficult section of PA.  He was moving pretty slowly, but he was doing it.


I was almost to the end of the ridge where the trail descends steeply down to Duncannon when I saw a women in a full green rain poncho ahead maneuvering slowly over the rocky trail.  It was Sue from NC who is a retired doctor and she lives three miles from the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC).  She started her NOBO flip flop hike on Easter Sunday in Harper’s Ferry.  I didn’t talk with her long because she’s staying at the same hostel tonight that I was.  She had the poncho on because it looked to her like it was going to rain.  It didn’t.  The trail down to town was really steep and rocky and my knees were feeling it.  I finally got onto the road and followed the AT markers through the outskirts of Duncannon and then right down Main Street.  Duncannon is a great trail town with a lot of AT history.


When I walked into the hostel, Betsy the owner asked me if I was Mr. Freeze.  I said yes, and asked how she knew.  She said Dirty Dan thought I’d be arriving shortly and another hiker who passed through earlier donated his free hostel stay to  me.  She asked me if I knew NotSoMuch because it was him who gave it to me.  Apparently, the Kentucky Krew (family of three who hiked last year) donated a hostel stay to the first two 2021 NOBO Thru-hikers who started in GA.  NotSoMuch was the second one but it was too early in the day so he gave it to me.  That’s hiker on hiker trail magic!  Actually, it’s double trail magic since it was originally from the Kentucky Krew.  I immediately sent a thank you to NotSoMuch since I still had his cell number from when we hiked together back in NC.  I would have liked it more if he was at the hostel and we could catch up on things, but he’s a pretty serious hiker and probably put in a lot of miles after leaving the hostel.  I also got an email address for the Kentucky Krew so I can send them a thank you.  After feeling like I was in a funk today, getting the free room was a needed pick-me-up.


Soon, Sue showed up and it was just me, her, and Dirty Dan at the hostel.  We all went to The Doyle Hotel down the street for dinner and a beer.  It’s a landmark on the AT but nobody really wants to stay there due to it’s pretty run down.  Stopping in for a burger and beer however, is something all AT hikers need to experience. 


After eating, Sue went back, but Dan wanted to grab a beer at the Pub down the street.  It was just like any other small town bar inside.  We were wrapping it up when an older women walked up to us and smiled and said “hiker trash” to us - then started laughing.  She introduced herself to us as Trail Angels Mary.  I knew of her from the Guthooks App and the AWOL book.  She told us some old AT stories and also how she started shuttling hikers back in 2003.  She had some bad luck and became homeless and would park her car and slept in a tent at the Duncannon hiker campground.  She would meet hikers and found out that they needed rides for resupply or to be picked up at road crossings to get to town.  Soon she earned enough money to get an apartment.  She still does shuttling, but she’s also the cook at the Pub we were at.  A priceless AT story if I ever heard one.


It was past my bed time, so we headed back to the hostel for another night in a bed.  It’s been a while since I slept in my tent or in a shelter.  I’m starting to get soft.","Carlisle, PA

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635071,"I was feeling kind of down this morning because it’s my wedding anniversary and I haven’t seen my wife since January 30.  I’m hoping once her school year is done that she’ll be able to meet me somewhere on the trail.  I’m not sure where I’ll be in early June, but I’m going to start looking at projections today.  We’ve been married for 33 years and I’m still amazed that she puts up with me.  I tell her on the phone sometimes that I might have made a mistake by going on this trip because she’s going to get used to not having me around - and like it.


It was cold again today and I honestly can’t remember the last warm day out here.  I mean warm from morning to evening.  There have been some nice afternoons after cold or rainy mornings, but no all day spring niceness.  I had to wear my windbreaker today - even while doing the steep uphill and rocky climb out of Duncannon.  There was a cold wind all day.  I finally got to the summit and the trail immediately took you through multiple boulder climbs.  Up, down, over, up again, back and forth and on and on.  I was moving extremely slowly and didn’t even average 2 miles per hour after the first three hours of the day - and that included the 2 mile or so road walk to start the day.  I thought I’d try to get 20 miles in, but at this rate, I’d never get there before dark.  The boulder scrambling finally stopped, but the trail was pretty much walking on rocks for the next 5 or 6 miles.  Finally, I started to have some sections where I could at least put my foot on some dirt between rocks, but that is also slow going because no steps are the same length and requires moving your feet right and left a lot to not step on a sharp edged rock.


I met section hiker Coach from NJ who is a HS Physics teacher and who has coached HS football, baseball, and Cross Country.  We had something in common and talked briefly about working with HS kids and then I needed to get moving.  I would have liked to spend more time with him, but I was way behind schedule already.


Shortly after that, SOBO flip flop hikers SOBO Squirrel (NJ) and Jimmy (PA) passed by.  They started March 29 from Delaware Water Gap.


Luckily, the trail wasn’t too rocky for most of the afternoon and I was able to make decent time.  I targeted a stealth site near a creek at the 1171.3 mile mark for the end of the day.  It would be a reasonable 22.1 mile day on a tough stretch.  I’m laying in my tent typing the journal and my feet are really sore from the rocks.  I need to deal with it because it’s only supposed to be worse as I move north (actually this section of AT in PA moves east) through PA.  No use dwelling on it.  I need to “Embrace the Suck” as they say on the trail.","Duncannon, PA

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635092,"I never got the Virginia Blues during the month it took to get through, but I think I’ve got the Pennsylvania Blues.  This state is pounding my feet from stubbing my toes 50 times (each) a day, turning my ankle when stepping awkwardly on the sharp edge of a jagged boulder, and tearing up my shoes.  I’m so looking forward to getting through - and I do know that NJ is rocky in some places too.About an hour into the hike this morning, I came upon Dirty Dan and Perseverance at their campsite.  He’s doing a flip flop thru-hike and started on April 1.  He’s from Key Largo and definitely is not used to the chilly weather we’ve been having
Other than having to get up 3 times during the night for 60 year old reasons, I had the best night sleep in quite awhile.  Better than when sleeping in all those beds recently.  I felt pretty rested and got an early start to give myself a chance at getting to Port Clinton and Hamburg by tomorrow night.  It is 48 miles away, but I was expecting a slow and rocky trail and planned on hiking for 11 to 12 hours both days.  The trail for the first 5 hours was actually relatively easy.  There were some rocks of course, but not enough to slow me down too much.  I made great time until I came to the fork in the trail where a beaver dam has flooded the AT.  It’s a 1.6 mile trail to get around the normal 1 mile section.   There aren’t any recent comments in the Guthooks App saying how deep the water is and how far you have to walk through it.  Every hiker I talked to coming the other way said they went around it.  Dirty Dan was ahead of me and he had talked with day hiker John who just went through it.  He said you can walk over sticks and brush if you have good balance.  I rationalized that the time it took to take my shoes and socks off, put on my crocs, then shoes and socks back on afterwards would take 3 to 4 minutes on each side.  I would have to walk really slowly to avoid falling off the sticks and stepping in the deeper water.  The time savings wasn’t worth it, so I decided on the alternate dry route.  Also - I don’t have good balance with close to 30 pounds on my back.


I was making very good time until I hiked under I-81 (again) and was facing a semi-rocky 800 foot climb.  It got pretty steep in a few spots, but I must be getting used to them because it didn’t seem so bad.  However, just like the climb out of Duncannon yesterday, the difficult part was after you get to the top.  It was more rock scrambling and walking on sharp boulders.  Finally, after about two miles, the trail got a little more forgiving.  Then for the next 6 or 7 miles it got pretty easy.


I was targeting an unofficial campsite 0.4 miles after the 501 Shelter (closed due to Covid), but I got there a little after 6 and decided to go a little farther to make tomorrow shorter.  Shortly thereafter, Bear Taco from eastern PA was coming the other way on a really rocky section.  I asked if she had noticed any good stealth campsites in the last mile.  She said there was one a half mile back, but it was taken.  We had the usual hiker small talk and started going our separate directions.  She asked me something else and the conversation continued and she said there’s a good campsite 1.4 miles back if I wanted to go that far.   Since she was just about as far as she was going to go on her overnight out and back trip, she asked if she could hike with me back the other way.  I enjoyed the company while we hiked northbound and were keeping an eye out for a stealth spot.  None were to be had, so we did the 1.4 and set up our tents.  Soon it was time for bed.  I don’t know if she’ll want to get up early to hike with me tomorrow, but it was great to have someone new to talk to while hiking and cooking and eating out dinner.  By the way, her trail name was given to her because she was told she looked like a taco while sleeping in her ENO light brown hammock (I have the same one). Her goal is to retire early and hike the AT.


I don’t know if I should thank Bear Taco or blame her, but I did 27.1 miles today (thank her - no doubt).  And - By the way - I have less than 1000 miles to go.  I’m getting to think I have a chance at finishing this thing.  The worst of PA is yet to come though.","Stealth Tent Site

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635094,"Finally, I awoke to fairly clear skies.  The sun came in and out all morning through the clouds - so I was uplifted a bit.  I was up before Bear Taco, but of course, like everyone else (except Dirty Dan) she was on the trail before me.  I never did see Dirty Dan yesterday after lunch so I’m not sure where he stayed.
The trail was rocky this morning but not as bad as I’d expected.  There were several stretches during the day where I came to a crawl due to the rocks.  I did have one pretty good uphill too, but nothing unusual.  There were several really steep parts of that climb that increased the difficulty.
During a short stop for lunch, I called the Hamburg Microtel (only hotel near Port Clinton) and was told they’re booked for tonight.  I looked at AT AWOL guidebook and the Guthooks App to figure out where to stay tonight.  I have multiple packages to pick up at the Port Clinton Post Office, and they’re only open after 12:30 pm.  There are no hostels near there, the hotel in Port Clinton (PC) is closed due to COVID, and the B&B in PC doesn’t answer their phone - and neither did the church that allows hikers to camp in their picnic shelter.  I left my name and number on the Microtel waiting list in hope that someone will cancel.  I admit fretting about it, but decided to pick up the pace (as safely as possible with the shoe shedding trail) to get to town as early as possible to give myself options.  Luckily for me, the hotel called and said I’m getting a room.  I need to do laundry, pick up a couple items of resupply, and then hang out   until 12:30 to get my package.
The drop in elevation to Port Clinton is severe and I slipped three times and fell due to no tread left on my shoes.  I can’t imagine hiking Southbound and having to climb up that.  The trail goes left on a rails to trails path into town, but I had to go right for 2 miles to get to the hotel.  On the way, my toes were hurting so badly that I’m considering taking another zero tomorrow before doing the last 80 miles of Rocksylvania.  That is to be determined.  During the never ending walk on the path, I caught up to Keith and Becky from Kutztown, PA who were out for a walk.  We talked about a variety of things and they were very friendly and interesting to talk to.  I finally got to the parking lot with a road that leads to the hotel and said my goodbyes.  Much to my surprise, Keith pulled over and gave me a lift for the final quarter mile.  Trail Magic again!!!  I know it’s only a quarter mile, but after over 87 trail (over 90 total) miles in 4 days, I’ll take  it.  Despite the beating my feet and toes took, the hotel cancellation and ride made it a fairly lucky day for me.  I’m strongly leaning towards taking a one day vacation from the AT to get my toes, feet, and mind rejuvenated.  I didn’t write about it, but my zero in Carlisle was a catastrophe day and anything but restful.  I was on my feet for most of that day.  I may talk about it in the future but have opted to keep it private at this time out of frustration.  As great as the Altra trail runners have been for my feet, there’s not enough padding to deal with the rocks.  Decisions decisions.","Stealth Tent Site

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635149,"I really didn’t want to zero today because the weather was good for hiking.  I had little choice, however, because I failed to read the fine print in the guidebook that the Port Clinton post office doesn’t open until 12:30 pm.  I thought about doing a half day, but my feet are really beat up and I needed to rest them.  I also didn’t get much rest last week in Carlisle on my previous zero.  Lastly, I hiked farther than planned over the previous 4 days and my body is feeling it.  The smart thing was to take my time and pick up a couple items at the Cabela’s and Walmart in the morning, and then call the local shuttler Steve to drive me the 2 miles to the Post Office and back. Luckily, he was available.  The only down side of today was that I had to walk a lot more this morning than I would have liked. Cabela’s was only a quarter mile away as the crow flies, but you could only get there by walking the opposite direction to get to a place where you could cross the divided highway - and then wind your way uphill to their store.  The distance was more like .75 miles to get there.  Walmart was a good half mile away from Cabela’s.  I just made myself walk slowly.
I sent a couple items home so hopefully I lightened up my pack a little.
I’m just hoping my toes feel better tomorrow.  I picked up a new pair of shoes and hopefully the fresh padding will help on the rocks.  They’re still trail runners because I don’t want to spend a lot of money on hard sole hiking shoes or boots that I’m only going to need for a couple weeks.  I have 4 or 5 days left in PA, followed by equally rocky sections in southern NJ.  If I want to hike the AT, I need to get through it.  No other choice.  Quitting is not an option.","Hamburg PA Microtel

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635285,"Shuttler Steve was 10 minutes early and I could see him out the hotel window. I figured as much and was ready to go.  Steve is an 80 year old widower who shuttles hikers around the Port Clinton area for dirt cheap fairs.  He told me he was about to give it up last year because some hikers are rude and unappreciative.  He changed his mind because so many hikers have pleaded with him to keep at it.  When he retires from shuttling, there really isn’t anyone else out there right now who’s doing the short but necessary shuttle between Port Clinton and Hamburg.  It’s a LONG walk from the Port Clinton trailheads to the Hamburg Microtel, stores, and restaurants.  There’s currently no place to stay in Port Clinton either.  I had some good conversations with Steve yesterday and today and hope he keeps doing it for awhile.  I hope I’m as sharp as he is at 80.


The immediate climb from the trailhead was long, but not too steep - and nothing like the southbounders face when they leave town.  Much to my surprise, the first 12 to 15 miles of the trail weren’t all that bad.  Maybe I’m getting used to it.  There were some short sections that were rockier than others, but overall - I was pleased.  Then, I crested the long uphill around mile 1237 and ouch!   The next four miles were never-ending sharp boulders and rocks stacked on each other.  It was by far, the slowest four miles of my AT hike - and that included the 4 mile hike up the icy Roan Mountain.  I averaged around 1.5 miles per hour over this rocky stretch.  It was hard because hardly any of the rocks had horizontal surfaces to place my foot on.  They were all on an angle or like stepping an upside down V.  My poor new shoes were taking a beating.  Until this point, I was feeling pretty good and felt refreshed from my day off.  By the time I finally got through this stretch (just before the Allentown Hiking Club Shelter), I was spent.  I wanted to g o at least another mile or two to ensure I get through the Knife’s Edge tomorrow before the rain storm hits.  I slowly and gingerly hiked another 2 miles or so and set up camp at an unofficial campsite.


There were lots of day hikers, but I didn’t talk to any of them.  I did have the pleasure of running into father (Doug) and son (Levi) who started a flip flop through hike yesterday at PA Route 309.  They’re from McKinney, TX which is near Dallas.  My brother Joe and his wife Celeste and their family live in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, so we had something to talk about other than hiking.


I’m going to try to get going tomorrow at first light to get through the most dangerous part of the AT in PA called the Knife’s Edge before the rain.  If anyone wants to see what it’s like, there are some YouTube videos out there on it.  It shouldn’t be mistaken for the more dangerous Knife’s Edge up on Mt.

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635288,"I wasn’t quite on the trail at first light, but did make it by 6:40 am.  It was a beautiful morning even though it was mostly cloudy.  The temperature was in the upper 40s and quickly warming up.  The first section was just mildly rocky and I was able to move at a decent pace without pushing it.  As I approached the Knife’s Edge, the rockiness dramatically increased.  Then, I saw the double white blaze on a tree that means a right turn.  I looked up and to the right and could see a steep wall of rock that’s part of the ridge line.  The wall had a white blaze to indicate that I need to go up.  The Knife’s Edge was dangerous, but as long as I went slowly, it couldn’t be as bad as I was fretting about.  It was hairy at times and I had to use my hands a lot to maneuver up and down in some areas.  This section took me awhile but it doesn’t pay to rush it here.


I finally was getting near Palmerton and the skies got dark, the temperature plummeted, and the wind picked up.  I was lucky and the rain didn’t start until around 2 miles from town.  It was a long 1.5 miles from the trail to Palmerton, but I’m glad I decided to stop at the Bert’s Steakhouse Hostel and get dry.  The steakhouse is actually an old fashion diner with a 2-room hostel in the back that sleeps 5.  The only others here tonight are D20 and Happy.  This is the original “Happy” and not the YouTuber I met back in VA.  She and her husband D20 are section hiking the northern part of PA.  They’ve done all of the AT on a previous thru-hike except northern PA, NJ, NY, CT, and MA.  They’re from the Dallas, TX area.  We talked over dinner and they shared lots of helpful hints about Maine, NH, and VT.  I also found out that there’s a list of active shuttlers posted on Whiteblaze.net.  That will be a tremendous help to me in the next couple months.  It’s snowing as I type this and is supposed to drop to 27 tonight.  I’m thinking I might take my time and not push it to get out of PA.  The smart thing is to get to Delaware Water Gap in 3 days instead of 2.  Why punish myself on the rocks and in bad weather.  That also means taking my time in the morning and not leaving until late morning or lunchtime.","Stealth Camp

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635386,"Last night’s snow and the next few day’s forecast sealed the decision.  I’m going to get to Delaware Water Gap (end of PA) in three days rather than try and push it in two.  The total miles (36) is very doable in two days, but everything I’ve heard from other hikers is that this next stretch is very slow going.  Therefore, I decided to not leave Palmerton until after lunch today.  I’d see how far I could get, do what it takes to get to the Kirkridge Shelter at mile 1289.6 on Friday, and then have a short day on Saturday of only 6.4 miles into Delaware Water Gap. That would be only my second true Nero day (first was back in Hiawasee, GA).  The weather was the other factor.  It’s supposed to be cold today and tonight with gusting winds.  Then, it’s supposed to rain on Saturday night.  With this plan, I’d get to town and get a room in the Deer Head Inn right on the trail for the rainy night.  I’d cross the Delaware on Sunday morning into NJ.


D20 and I went to Bert’s for breakfast (Happy wasn’t interested) and then the three of us lounged around the Hostel all morning.  It was cold and windy in town, so I know it’s colder up the mountain.  I asked them more questions about NH, the Whites, Vermont, and Maine.  Specifically, the 100 mile Wilderness and Baxter State Park.  They gave me some first hand experience that I didn’t hear before from books and YouTube videos.


I went back to Bert’s for lunch and then said my farewell to D20 and Happy and started my 1.5 mile trek back to the trail.  I wasn’t looking forward to it because it’s a nasty steep climb up out of town.  I had a heavy pack with three days of food (it could have been much worse) and two full water bottles due to there’s no easily available drinking water up on the ridge for almost 16 miles.


It took me awhile to get up the mountain and it was very steep for much of the way.  I made no effort to go fast and took very short steps.  Finally, when I reached the top, the cold wind was blowing pretty hard.  I went from sweating during the climb to having a bad chill.  The rocks weren’t too bad at the summit so I pushed the pace a little to warm myself up.  It didn’t take long, however, and the trail made me slow down to less than 2 miles per hour to avoid breaking an ankle or foot.  It was slow going all afternoon and my hopes of reaching the Leroy Smith Shelter and a 16 mile afternoon were shattered.  I decided to stop at a stealth campsite after 12.5 miles.  It was about 5:30 pm and the temperature was already dropping fast and the wind was still gusting.  That means a 17 or 18 mile day tomorrow, but I can just go slow and get there when I get there.


Only two more days and then I get to enjoy the rocks of southern New Jersey.  I’m told they’re tough there too, but eventually end.


I didn’t see any hikers of any kind today - not even at the road crossings where day hikers park.  Personally, I don’t know who in their right mind would find today’s section fun.  There really weren’t any scenic views either.  Just marching with my head down staring at the ground.  I think that’s why the overwhelming majority of hikers say they hate PA the most of any state.  You walk for 230 miles with your head down so you don’t get injured or trip.","Palmerton, PA
",Stealth Campsite,"Apr 22, Thu",12.50
Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635453,"I slept pretty well in my tent last night despite getting down into the upper 20s.  There was frost on the ground and I was in no hurry to leave my warm cocoon.  I had a lot of time today to do 17 miles or so, but knew I had to get water mid day from either a really long downhill side trail, or walk the 0.8 miles to Wind Gap, PA to a convenience store or restaurant.  I had a couple ounces of Gatorade left this morning and that was it.  The last 30 miles or so of PA are very dry as far as springs and creeks go.  


I got going around 8 am and of course, the trail was slow going again.  What made today different than yesterday is there was absolutely no stretch of trail without rock walking until the last mile of my day.  As bad as yesterday and the previous few days were, there would always be a break - even if it was only a half mile long.  Not today.


I passed up the long 0.4 and 0.6 mile downhill side trails and decided to just walk to the town.  At least it would be flat walking and I’d be able to sit down for a short break.


When I got to the road I thought I’d try hitching.  I’ve had no success so far on this trip but you never know.  About half way to town Renae pulled over and offered me a lift.  She offered to take me to a diner on the south end of town but I told her that would be too far for me to walk back.  No worries she said, she was just going to her brothers house and told me to send her a text and she’ll come pick me up.  She was a real Trail Angel - even though she wasn’t familiar with the term.  She said she likes to help hikers and wants them to know there’s still good people out there.  I ate an unexpected large lunch and filled my water bottles and was ready to head back.  Renae was true to her word and saved me the long walk back.  Without a doubt, Renae is “good people.”


It was 9.1 miles from there to the shelter and for 7 miles I moved slowly over the rocky trail.  I think I mentioned before that I stub my foot approximately 50 times a day.  I’m always able to catch myself from falling with a few quick jogging steps.  Well, not today.  I stubbed my right foot and fell forward, then stubbed my left foot while trying to not fall.  I went down really hard on my left side directly onto the pointed rocky trail.  I scraped my left shin, bruised my left thigh, bruised my left butt cheek, scraped my left wrist, and bruised the palm of my left hand right under the thumb.  As I’m writing this, my left palm is swollen and purple and blue.  I stayed on the ground for about 30 seconds before starting to make sure everything was working.  I was hurting, but sore. I got up and started moving again very slowly and decided I might take the bypass trail for the tough Wolf Rocks climb and scramble since I was hurting.  When I got to the fork in the trail, I decided to go for it because there are supposed to be rattlesnake dens you can see up on Wolf Rocks.  Fortunately, the rock scramble wasn’t too bad.  According to Guthooks, hikers frequently see the snakes below the rocks, but not today.  When the bypass met back up with the AT, I couldn’t believe what I saw.  The AT suddenly was a brown flat carpet of pine needles and dirt - and no rocks!  It lasted for about a mile and I think I was smiling while I hiked.  It eventually ended as I came to the road, but there was just another half mile or so to the shelter.


I thought about just finishing the last 6.3 miles and get to town, but my injuries were hurting and I have some pretty good swelling going.  I’ll take a couple vitamin I pills and hope it’s better in the morning.


I was passed this afternoon by Sonar (20 something) ex-Navy thru-hiker from Indiana.  He was flying over the rocks with ease compared to me.  He said he’s sick of them and is going fast to get it over with.  He started 2 weeks after me so he goes fast all the time.  Just before the shelter, I met Squiggles (daughter) and Bear Watcher (mom) who are trying to get the northern section of PA completed.  They’re from NJ and gave me some great tips about the AT there.  When I arrived at the shelter, Creature Feature was setting up for the night.  He’s doing a NOBO Flip Flip - which is starting at Smithsburg, VA., Hiking to Maine, flying to Springer Mtn GA, then hiking home NOBO.  By the way, I decided to stop at this shelter rather than tent because I have yet to sleep in a PA shelter.  They’ve been the nicest ones - often with finished or painted floors, sometimes flowers planted outside, and several of them have caretakers.  Sometimes there are two shelters - 1 for snorers and 1 for non-snorers.  Not today. This shelter was old and dirty - and no broom to sweep the dirt out.  Oh well.


Chris from VA (via Oklahoma) hiked into the shelter after dark, but I didn’t get any other info from him.


Tomorrow I finish this state!!!!  Yes.  It had gotten the better of me mentally, and now physically.","Stealth Campsite

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635527,"Today’s photo is of the final tenth of a mile of trail before entering the town of Delaware Water Gap.  It was a beautiful sunny and warm Saturday and the trail head parking lot was full.  There were cars lined up down the street too, as well as one house nearby charging $10 to park.  It was a perfect day for a day hike up to Mt. Minsi.  I was going to post the photo from up there, but knew immediately when the trail turned flat with crushed stone right before the parking lot.  I’m physically and mentally beaten up, but I now only have a couple tenths of a mile out of town and crossing the Delaware River tomorrow and I’m officially done with PA (on a bridge with no rocks).  I have nothing personal against PA - so I hope anyone from PA doesn’t take my whining personally.  If you do, I don’t apologize.  The AT in PA is awful - period.
Creature Feature and I hiked the 6.4 miles down the mountain slowly and decided to split a hotel room.  It’s a 90% chance of rain tonight and tomorrow until 1 pm.  I’ll make a decision tomorrow what time to leave.  
On a sad note, I found out today that Dirty Dan took a bad fall on the rocks a few days ago and is off the trail for awhile.  He may have a stress fracture in his leg.  I feel terribly for him, but he’s a tough and driven guy - so I know he’ll be back.  As bad as I’m feeling today with my multiple bruises and swelling, I feel lucky that’s all the damage I suffered on my fall.  It could have been a lot worse.  I’m really going to miss DD because he’s a strong hiker and has a great sense of humor.  He didn’t push me, but I enjoyed his company and would sometimes try to go as far as he did (a lot slower though) to have someone to talk with at the end of the day.  Also, as a younger guy, he often helped me see things from a younger person’s viewpoint.  I needed that.
Other than the obvious, a highlight of my day was a brief meeting with Wolfey who hiked the trail SOBO in the late 60s.  These guys impress the hell out of me.  There was no Guthooks App with GPS telling you where you were or if you are off trail.  Nothing telling you where the water is, little to no support in towns, no cell phones to call someone (no shuttlers) for a ride.  As hard as this is for me, it doesn’t compare with what the early hikers had to deal with.  They had to carry several pounds of water all the time and up steep climbs because they didn’t know there’s a stream going down the other side.

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635677,"It rained for much of the night, but had stopped by the time Creature Feature and I went next door to walk through the Dunkin Doughnuts drive-through for breakfast.  It looked like it would rain again, but never did.  Creature Feature was zeroing today at the Rodeway Inn, so I said my farewells and headed out and back through Delaware Water Gap to go to the outfitter and then back to the trail.  I wanted to pick up a spare can of fuel since I was running a bit low.  The website says they open at 9 on Sundays, but to stay consistent with so many other times on my trip, they weren’t open when I got there.  Off to the trail.  I’ll have to walk the 0.3 side trail each way later today to go to the Mohican Outdoor Center to get it.  I should have bought the fuel yesterday but I procrastinated and now have to pay the price.


The first couple miles was a road walk that included walking on I-80 over the Delaware River.  I took a photo of the state boundary painted on the walkway.  Eventually, the trail left the road for a 3 mile 1000 foot climb.  Actually, it was pretty easy and had lots of flat sections to give hikers a break.  It was a little rocky in some places, but nothing like the north end of PA .  When I approached the top, I could see the 41 acre Sunfish Pond which was formed by glaciers.  It’s very acidic and only hardy species of fish can survive in the pond.  The AT follows the north shore for 0.6 miles and includes some boulder hopping and lots of rocky trail.  I knew about this section and it really wasn’t that bad.


The trail walked on a ridge all day and had multiple views of the New Jersey countryside below.  After finishing the Sunfish Pond section, I crossed paths with three hikers from Cherry Hill, NJ who were out for the weekend.  They were “Impaled by Tree”, Jim, and Jeff.  I asked about the Mohican Outdoor Center because I needed to go there.  Immediately, they offered to give me their spare fuel cans.  I offered to pay them, but they wouldn’t accept anything.  I ended up taking  half full large canister from Empaled by Tree since his had the most left.  They had done several sections of the AT in the past, including the Northeastern mountain states and the 100 mile Wilderness section in Maine.  They were really cool guys and I think I would have enjoyed hiking with them if they were going the other way.  By the way, Jim is one of those guys that makes his own equipment.  He had a homemade version of my ZPacks backpack and he made his own sleeping bag.  Impressive.


I would like to clarify that all my complaining about PA isn’t just because it’s difficult.  This whole trip has been difficult for me and I know the hardest parts are yet to come.  I complained about the miles upon miles of walking with my head down trying not to trip or turn an ankle.  I actually enjoyed the rock climbs like Knifes Edge and Albert Mountain - and the one today near Crater Lake.  I elected to not bypass Wolf Rocks even though I didn’t really have the use of my left hand because it’s a cool part of the AT.  The trail was fairly rocky in some parts today, but just in a few sections.  I didn’t hate hiking today so it was a good day - LOL.


There were lots of campsites along the trail today, but not a lot of options towards the late afternoon.  The dark clouds cleared out around 6:15 pm, so I kept moving.  I did find a really nice spot down below a rock outcropping and out of the wind.  There was a creek nearby so water wasn’t a problem.The highlight of today was seeing a really large beaver pond.  It was really impressive what they could do.","Delaware Water Gap, PA

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635697,"I was able to get on the trail by 6:30 am and it was cold and windy.  As a matter of fact, despite the sun being out all day, I never took my jacket off.  There was a cold north wind blowing all day long and I was either chilled on the north side of the ridge, or sweating on the south side.  The trail takes turns running along both sides.    I was hoping for an easier trail today, but it was tough from beginning to end.  However, I was rewarded by some great views on both the north and south sides of the ridge throughout the day.  Other than another rocky trail day, the route went up and down little peaks continuously all day long.


Early in the morning I met Raven and Overtime from GA doing a section hike and they’re GA trail-maintainers. They’ve completed most of the AT and are trying to complete this section south to Delaware Water Gap.  I also came across Three Men and a Food Truck from Texas.  They’re a father and 2 sons who carry a ton of food.  The Dad did most of the AT in 1981 and hiked part of it last year and hoping to finish the rest this year with his boys.


When I got near the park headquarters, I sent a text to Mosey to pick me up at High Point State Park to take me back to her hostel.  She couldn’t get me at that time, but another hiker named Trout who’s staying at the hostel came and got me. He has his car because he’s starting a combination section hike and fishing trip in PA tomorrow.  He did the entire trail southbound in 2019.  He drove up from NC and wouldn’t take money for picking me up.  He did let me buy him a Coke and some candy at the store though.  The next several days are going to be flying by the seat of my pants.  I like to have it all planned out how far I’m going, where I’m going to stop or spend the night, and how much food to have.  After studying the AT App and guidebook, I honestly don’t know where I’m going to be tomorrow at this time - let alone the coming weekend or next week.  I want to meet up with my friend Vince from home in CT someplace and my sister Linda who lives in CT might meet me - but for the life of me, I can’t figure it out.  I’ll keep looking and maybe I’ll come up with a plan.  I’m looking forward to the next couple of days because I’ll be coming up on the third small segment of the AT that I’ve been on before.","Stealth Tent Site
",High Point State Park HQ,"Apr 26, Mon",20.70
Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635754,"I was feeling good today, because my injuries have finally healed and I could hike without pain in my left thigh or in my left hand.  I could grip the trekking pole like I used to and was able to go uphill and downhill faster than during the last three days.


Mosey made a delicious breakfast for Trout and I before she took me back to the Highpoint State Park Headquarters.  She runs a very neat and easy going hostel.  I would recommend it to any section or thru-hiker when in the area.  The first couple miles offered some up and down mildly rocky trail, and finally up to a 220 foot obelisk.  That’s what the Guthooks App calls it, but it looks to me like a smaller Washington Monument (the one in DC).  After a few more ups and downs, the trail smooths out and was easy walking for the rest of the morning.  I walked through a few meadows and through some woods.  I could see some country homes through the trees and some farm houses when going through the meadows.  It was a beautiful sunny day with warm temperatures.  It never got hot though, so it was a perfect day for hiking.  I had heard that hikers can stop for lunch in several places in NJ along the trail.  It was too early yesterday when I went by the first opportunity, but I would be going right by Unionville, NY around lunchtime today.  I was making good time so I decided to make the 0.4 mile trip over the state line and into town.  I opted for Annabel’s Pizza (I called first to confirm they’re open) and ate two corner slices of deep dish pizza and a peach ice tea while sitting on a table on their porch.  I just wish I could have relaxed a little more because it was a perfect day to eat lunch outside and watch the small town in action.  On the way out of town, I stopped into Horler’s General Store and bought a bottled water and a large Payday bar for the walk back to the trail.


It was more easy walking on a rails-to-trails type of trail for a short while before ending up on a three quarter mile road walk.  The trail leaves the road and enters a flat and grassy trail that goes around the Wallkill National Wildlife Refuge.  Most of the water had been purposely drained and it smelled like rotting fish.  Then - my flatness ended.  Out of nowhere was a steep and rocky 700 foot climb.  It didn’t bother me though because I knew how lucky I was to have the easy trek prior to that.  The trail did a lot of up and downs for most of the afternoon before coming to a 2 mile boardwalk through a marsh.  At the end of the marsh was a winding path through the woods, followed by a quarter mile boardwalk through a cow pasture.  The cows were all around the boardwalk and were obviously used to people.  They never moved when I walked by - except for a calf who was standing right on the trail.  The woods and cow pasture (and Stairway to Heaven tomorrow am) are the third segment of the AT that I’d been on before.  I came over here a few years back when I was in the area for my nephew Chris’s wedding.


I did hustle a little at the end of the day to get to Mitch’s Hot Dog stand and Heaven Hill Farm for dinner before finding a campsite on the trail prior to Stairway to Heaven.  I checked online and they’re open until 6.  The plan was to get a hotdog and a water, then head over to Heaven Hill for some ice cream.  Much not to my surprise, Mitch’s stand was closed.  Also, after opening the door and entering Heaven Hill at 5:15 pm, it looked like they were closing.  A worker said they close at 5, but she agreed to sell me a couple bottles of water so I could make my dinner.  That was nice of her at least.  It was my fault because I didn’t read the website close enough.  Some days they are open until 6, but not on Tuesdays.  I saw a water spigot behind their building, so I could have gotten some there if I had to.


I thought about heading up the 1000 foot rocky Stairway to Heaven and camping up there, but I didn’t see any benefit to it.  I’ve got 46.8 miles to Fort Montgomery, NY where I’ll pick up a package at the post office - and I don’t want to push it in 2 days.  There are some steep and rocky climbs and I’ve already put in three straight 20 plus mile days.  Rain is coming too, so I’m just not seeing a reason to push things.  Call it the new me (smarter?).


I didn’t see any section or through hikers all day until running across Caretaker moving southbound.  He’s from NC and has been section hiking the AT for 11 years.  He was doing CT to High Point State Park on this occasion.  He then just needs to complete everything north of CT.There were two highlights of the day today. First - back to full strength hiking.  Second - eating lunch on a restaurant porch in a small town on a warm and sunny day.","High Point State Park HQ

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635836,"I liked my stealth campsite tucked in the scrubby pines 100 feet off the trail, and about a half mile before the start of the climb up Stairway to Heaven.  I heard some early hikers go by around 6:30 and started to get myself going. I took my time and started hiking at 7:45 am.  I took the climb very slowly and was up at the top before I knew it.  I was sweating pretty good so I know it was going to be hot today.  


The rest of NJ was pretty easy.  It reminded me of leaving Georgia and it hands it to you one last time as you approach the border  Once again, I didn’t plan very well and didn’t drink enough water.  The last part of NJ and several miles in NY are on a ridge with not a lot of water.  Once I crossed the state line, NY was a long string of boulder scrambling and rock climbing.  It was kind of fun actually - except that it got up to the mid 80s and my body wasn’t ready for it.  Good thing for a couple streams in this stretch or I would have been in real trouble.  By the time I came down from the ridge, I was beat.  The good news was that the Bellvale Farm ice cream store was just a few miles farther down trail.  I had a waffle cone, a milkshake, and a bottle of Bellvale Farm orange soda - delicious. 


The final 2 miles to the shelter were easy trail, but I was worn out from climbing boulders in the heat.  I was spent.  Once I got there, I had a hard time keeping my eyes open.  I had the shelter to myself until Amanda and Heidi strolled in.  I passed them earlier in the day in NJ.  They’re from NJ and are section hiking NY.


It’s supposed to rain tonight, so that’s why I decided to stop in the shelter.  That means a longer day tomorrow, but I don’t think I could have gone much farther anyhow.

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635985,"Last night after posting my journal, One-eyed Jack came to the shelter after dark.  We squeezed together to make room for him.  That made five of us in a six person shelter.  We weren’t shoulder-to-shoulder, but it’s by far the most people in a shelter at night on my trip. It’s the worst nights sleep I’ve had in awhile.  That’s one of the reasons I started early.  One-eyed Jack is from CT and started his flip flop NOBO hike at Harper’s Ferry in late March.  We were all in the shelter for the same reason.  It was supposed to storm.  It did rain for awhile early in the night, and then again in the early morning while we were all packing up.  The rain did a great job knocking down the temperature, but it was really humid - and the gnats were out all day again.  They’re so annoying, but I guess I could use the mental practice for the black flies in the NE.  That will be much much worse and will test my sanity for sure.


It rained on and off all day, but since it was in the mid 60s, it didn’t seem to bother me too much.  The trail was not as tough as yesterday afternoon, but it did have some steep rock ledges that required putting the poles away or tossing them up and then using my hands.  The most interesting part was the Lemon Squeezer in Harriman State Park.  The trail goes up between two rock walls and the width gets smaller and smaller to the point where you have to walk sideways.  That means taking off my pack and shuffling it in front of me until I could lift it onto one of the ledges.  The overcast skies didn’t allow for any views today but NY does reward you for your climbs.


It was slow going for most of the day, but I could make a little better time in the last 4 or 5 miles.  I wanted to stay in a shelter again because more storms were on the horizon.  When I got to there, section hikers Jay (CT) and Kevin (Mass) had their tents set up, so I had the shelter to myself.  I talked with them for a short time and Jay is trying to section hike the entire AT and has done a lot of the northern states.  They’re both fathers of young children, so neither felt they’d be able to do a thru-hike in the near future.  They really helped me out because the water is 0.4 miles downhill from the shelter and they had gone down and filled up a couple gallon water bag.  They offered for me to fill my bottles if I needed because they knew they didn’t need that much. 


I was pretty happy with today’s mileage total because it leaves 10 miles or so tomorrow before going into Fort Montgomery, NY.  It’s supposed to rain again tomorrow too.","Wildcat Shelter

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635990,"I don’t know if it rained last night but the wind was gusting when I woke up and the sky was dark.  I had a feeling I’d be hiking in the rain and gusting winds today.  Luckily, it never did rain, but the wind was so strong that it blew me around on most of the ledges, mountain peaks, and at the top of the rock outcroppings.  There were some bonuses though.  I stayed cool, there were no gnats, and the skies cleared up earlier than predicted and I had fantastic views all day long.  New York has some really challenging trail sections, but there’s beautiful view after beautiful view.  So far, in my opinion, NY is the most scenic state since the east (north) section of the Smokeys.


I had a breathtaking view of the Hudson River from the top of Bear Mountain.  It was steep going up northbound but was made easier by the trail designers who made it into a steep and narrow set of winding stairs.  After cresting the peak, the trail suddenly turned into a wide gravel path like at a metro park. It was extremely nice to do some mindless walking.  The path wound around the top of the mountain and then by a parking lot with a tower.  The nice path continued, with hundreds of steps, all the way down the mountain.  By then, the sun was shining and it was an unexpectedly nice day.  At the bottom, the trail goes through a park and next to a small lake.  The wind was still whipping and the lake had whitecaps.  The trail then turns east and goes through a small Zoo.  I saw a bobcat, fox, and two bears.  It was really cool and I took my time getting through.  Finally, I got to the traffic circle before the bridge over the Hudson River and called the motel for my shuttle.  The Bear Mountain Bridge Motel is a small five-unit old fashioned motel owned by Laura and Grandpa.  It’s old, but extremely clean and they’ve done a lot of updating.  The other options had $200 plus per night rates so I’m more than happy with my room.


The overwhelming highlight Of today was when my sister Linda from southeast CT and my niece Sabina and nephew Steven drove up to see me and go for dinner.  I  started to get emotional when I saw them because it’s the first time I’ve seen a family member or friend since January 29.  It was a great day.  A lesser highlight was going past 1400 miles this morning. Still nearly 800 miles to go.  Little by little.

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636064,"I ate breakfast at the deli down the street and Grandpa took me back to Bear Mountain Bridge a little after 8.  It was probably around 40 degrees, but the wind was gusting again and I wore my rain pants and jacket to cross the Hudson River.  Since it was Saturday, I figured there’d be a lot of day hikers.  It was a bright sunny morning, but the windchill probably kept many away.  There were a few out on the climb up to Anthony’s Nose overlook (view of the Hudson River) but I didn’t see any go beyond its side trail.  After the climb up from the bridge, the trail was relatively easy.  I made great time (too good) and came to NY Route 9 and The Appalachian Market by 10:45 am.  I wasn’t hungry at all but I couldn’t pass up getting an early lunch from their grill.  It was part of my plan and I didn’t have enough lunch food packed for the week if I ate out of my food bag later on.  I also loaded up on food resupply at the market since I didn’t want to have 5 or 6 days of food in my pack when going up the mountain after the Hudson River.  I forced myself to eat a cheeseburger and fries and drink an orange juice and half a Powerade.  I poured the rest into my water bottle to sip from this afternoon.  I was stuffed, but it shouldn’t be a problem because, after all, the trail was pretty easy this morning.  Of course that didn’t last long and the afternoon was loaded with countless ups and downs.  The cold wind stuck around all day, but only when I was on one side of the ridges and mountains.  Therefore, I hiked in shorts and a t-shirt and was only a little chilly half the time.  I ran into several day hikers today, but didn’t really talk to any of them other than a quick greeting.


Other than the start of the day, there weren’t really any good views.  It was pretty much head down charging forward today.  I don’t know if it was because my pack was heavier than normal due to all the food or what, but I was having some pains that I haven’t had before.  My left Achilles tendon wasn’t happy at the end of the day and my right knee had a periodic sharp pain in it.  I decided to just slow down at the end of the day and stick to the original plan and head to the Clarence Fahnestock State Park campground after approximately 20 miles.  I was thinking about finding a stealth campsite a mile or two farther down trail, but the terrain didn’t allow for any stealth spots for the previous couple miles.  So I went for the sure thing and headed for the park.


The side trail to the park was one of the tougher ones I’ve had to do on this trip.  It was about 0.3 miles to the beach, and then a little more to the designated AT backpacker campsites.  When I got to the beach, section hiker NEB had his tent pitched in a small sandy and grassy area right where the side trail comes out of the woods.  There were picnic tables too, so I asked if he minded if I set up my tent about 25 yards from him.  I really didn’t want to walk another 0.2 miles to the designated area and nobody else is around this time of year to care anyhow.  It’ll be quicker back to the trail in the morning.  NEB is from NH and is hiking for a few days in NY.  I didn’t see any other thru-hikers or section hikers today.  I figured some of the mid to late February starters would have caught me by now, but so far i haven’t really seen them other than Sonar last week in PA.","Bear Mountain Bridge

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636233,"Since I went to bed early last night, getting out of my bag at 5am was pretty easy.  It still takes me an hour to 1:15 to get hiking if I make coffee, eat breakfast and take care of business.  It was cool but not windy, so it was a matter of time before the gnats came out.  I made pretty good time for the first two hours and stopped into the RPH Shelter.  Wow - it was nice.  It had a door, siding, and a porch in the back.  There were bunks with sponge mattresses on them.  It even had a bookshelf full of books and magazines.  I didn’t notice if it had electricity or not, but it was very clean.  The best part was that there were dozens of jugs of potable water for hikers to fill their bottles.  An hour or so down trail I crossed NY Route 52.  There’s a deli and pizza shop a half mile down the road.  I had enough food so, as much as I wanted to, I didn’t take the detour.  Good thing too because I struggled in the afternoon again.  It wasn’t hot, but it did get into the 70s and I’m just not acclimated to that yet.  I drank plenty of water and topped off one of my bottles at every creek or stream.  Even with that, the last few miles seemed to take forever.  It’s been like that for several days now.  The few views I had today were spectacular, but not enough of them for the amount of work it takes going up and down all day.  One interesting thing of note was that the trail goes along Nuclear Lake.  The Guthooks App says it got its name due to there used to be a plutonium research facility nearby.  It closed back in 1972 due to a chemical explosion at the plant.  The water has been tested and is fine.  I saw people fishing so it must be ok.
I toyed with the idea of going a couple extra miles due to I got an early start, however, I was out of gas and there’s a possibility of rain tonight.  When I got there, Erik (Dragon) was there with his dog Pete.  Eric got his trail name because of his dog.  He’s from PA and is in the middle of an 11 year plan to section hike the entire AT.  An hour or so later, section hiker Bob came into the shelter.  He’s from CT now, but lived in FL before that.  After some small talk, it turns out he knows and worked with my brother-in-law at Pratt-Whitney.  Small world - again.","Clarence Fahnestock State Park

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636235,"I had mentioned in previous posts how the AT leaving GA and NJ gives it to you one more time.  NY is the opposite.  After the first two days, I was really worried that I’d have to add a day or two to my plan to get through.  It got easier in the middle, and then today it was a piece of cake.  There was a boardwalk section through a swamp and a few miles of cow pasture (mostly uphill though).  After the boardwalk, it crosses railroad tracks and there’s a station for AT hikers.  You can take it to NY city if you wanted to.


The beginning of CT wasn’t too tough either - until it got to Ten Mile Hill, and even that wasn’t bad.  Since I was making good time, I decided to head over to the Bull Bridge Country Store for some snacks.  Without me asking, the store owner told me where the water faucet outside was to fill my bottles, where the electrical outlet was to charge my phone, where the porta-john is, and that I can sit at the picnic table in front of the store if I wanted too.  She was extremely hiker friendly.


After returning to the trail, a big (for the mid-Atlantic states) climb awaited me.  The rest of the afternoon was kind of miserable because it rained the entire time and there were a lot of places where I had to walk on the sides of slanted boulders.  I slipped and fell a few times and had to really slow it down after that and put a lot more weight on my trekking poles to stop myself from sliding down.


I got to the shelter around 5 pm and nobody was there.  An hour or so later, two sisters who I’d seen earlier in the day from the NY City area rolled in.  They’ve been out for a week so far and are hiking north from Bear Mountain through NY, CT, and will see how far they go.  They’re names are Kermit and Zehava.  They’re the only two hikers I saw today.","Telephone Pioneer Shelter

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636385,"I was tired last night and decided not to do my journal until today.  There were so many things I wanted to remember that I might change up my typical format.  First, I crossed paths with Adastra (from PA) who was doing a long southbound section hike from CT to NJ.  She started on May 1.  Shortly before getting to the shelter I was targeting for the night, I passed a group of six and a dog.  Three of them did a thru-hike of the AT before.  Granite (Maine) and Blue (NH) did it in 2019.  Duckfart (yep, you read that correctly) did his in 2017.  Foghat has completed GA to Mt. Washington in 2017 and 2019.  Quita and Madeline and Shadow the dog joined them.  Which leads to my next item.  They were going to the same 6-person shelter I was.  That meant 7 of us, plus other hikers that might be there.  It’s supposed to rain all night, so everyone was likely trying to get to shelter.  My plan was to stay there as well and then do the 15 miles or so the next day to the hostel in Salisbury.  The problem was that the owner wasn’t going to be available in the afternoon tomorrow to let me in.  My solution was to go another 5 or 6 miles today to a trail head and have her pick me up.  Then bring me back in the morning for the hike to the hostel.  It cost me more for two nights and two shuttles, but I’d be guaranteed to be out of the rainstorm tonight, and less hiking tomorrow in the all day rain expected.  Connecticut and Massachusetts have rules that really mess me up.  You cannot stealth camp and must stay at a shelter or designated campsite.  That means you don’t get to pick your distance for the days. There are very few tent camping sites too,  Also, no campfires allowed.  Of course the distances between shelters and camping areas didn’t match my mileage.  That really messes with a hiker’s flexibility to go a little farther than planned on a given day.
Something I didn’t see a lot of today, but forgot to mention yesterday.  Yesterday afternoon in the rain, I had to really watch where I walked because there were hundreds of small orange salamanders on the trail - and they don’t move.  I could have crushed many of them if I wasn’t careful.  
I have to note that I almost lost it a couple of times coming down from the St.John’s Cliffs.  It was really steep and the rocks were wet.  After doing those kinds of descents, I wonder if anyone has gotten seriously injured or died doing this.  I have to say, Connecticut is very beautiful.  After the all night rain, the numerous creeks were swollen and several had whitewater rapids.  In one spot, there was a sign that said to take the 1.1 mile road walk instead of the .5 mile AT during high water.  I wasn’t about to walk that extra amount so I went forward.  I could hear the raging creek (now a river) before I got there.  Also, there were three large trees that blew down across the trail before the creek that hadn’t been cleaned - probably on purpose to stop hikers from going on.  When I got to the creek, it was about 40 feet wide of raging water.  Most of the boulders after half way across were submerged so I had to either get wet, or go back.  It looked about knee deep, but fast water.  I’ve never forded a creek or river with water moving that fast.  I wasn’t going back a quarter mile to do the detour, and decided I’m just going to go through with my shoes and socks on.  It was slow, deliberate, and scary but I didn’t fall. My trekking poles were a savior.  I just kept walking the rest of the afternoon with wet shoes and socks, but the Darn Tough socks held up and I didn’t get any blisters.
 I got to the trailhead just before 7 pm after 11 hours straight of hiking.  I never sat down all day and ate 3 Cliff bars for lunch while moving.  I was lucky, because after Vanessa picked me up, it was the first night that NEO restaurant next to the hostel was open late.  Otherwise, I’d have to order a pizza and wait for it.  The almost highlight of the day was that I was 0.2 miles shy of 700 miles to go.  Tomorrow morning I’ll cross the 700 miles to go mark and then the 1500 mile mark.  I’m making progress, but 700 miles is still a loooong way to go.","Mt. Algo Shelter

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636387,"Even though my hostel bed was comfortable, I slept like crap.  I don’t know why, but I had to get up at 6:30 am to get something to eat at the bakery at 7:30 - followed by Vanessa taking me back to Rt 7 trailhead at 8.  There was one mountain to climb, but only ten miles of pretty easy trail today - with a light pack.  I only slack packed one other time (coming out of the N.O.C), and I could really use the light day.  The sky looked like it was going to dump on me all morning, but I only got rained on for the last two miles.  Later on in the day after I was done, it poured for most of the afternoon, so I was happy with my decisions.


I got back to town just before noon and picked up my 30 degree bag from the post office and shipped my zero degree home.  The 30 degree is about 2/3 of the weight and I realized in NY that I’m going to struggle with a heavy and bulky pack in the north so I have to lighten it up.  I still have my down puffy to sleep in if it gets too cold.


I’m trying to plan the next week of hiking to resupply and there are lots of unknowns that are making it difficult.  Specifically, I’m struggling to find where I can get a new stove fuel canister in the next week.  The main reason for my difficulty however, is what I mentioned yesterday - Massachusetts requires you to stay at a shelter or a designated campsite.  Whomever made that rule didn’t seem too concerned that there are very very few designated campsites.  That means there will be days that I’ll have to push my limits to do extra miles, or have a much shorter day than desired to stop for the night in a permitted spot.  Oh well, at least Massachusetts isn’t that long.","Rt 7 Trailhead
","Salisbury, CT","May 05, Wed",9.70
Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636496,"I looked out of the hostel bunk room window this morning and the sun was shining.  I think it’s been three days of dreariness so I was excited to get moving.  71 year old section hiker Spencer from Arlington, TX came in to the hostel yesterday after I posted.  He was also going north so Vanessa the hostel owner offered to drive us the mile out of town to the hostel.   If I have a chance to eliminate an extra mile of road walk, I’ll take it.  Spencer has been hiking the AT for about 11 years, but he wasn’t in enough hurry to want to hike the 21 miles with me to Massachusetts Rt. 7 by 5 pm for the shuttle into Great Barrington, so I’ll likely not see him again.  I really didn’t want to spend more money in a town, but the distance to a shelter or campsite from Salisbury was either too short or too far. Plus there were two really steep mountains today so it worked out to wait on my resupply until Great Barrington.


The day started with three consecutive uphills with a slight break between them.  After three days of rain however, the trail was really swampy.  I tried to keep my feet dry, but soon realized that was a major waste of energy.  The third climb was up Bear Mountain ( yes - another Bear Mtn) and it went up and up and up.  I was still feeling pretty good though and was on pace to make my 5 pm shuttle.  Joe the shuttler only shuttles up until 5 pm, and I respect that - but it made me work a lot harder than I wanted to today.  The peak of Bear Mountain is just before the state line but the descent was brutal - especially with wet rocks and shoes.  I was sliding all over the place and had to inch my way down while grabbing onto trees in some places just to stop myself from falling.  It took a long time, and numerous foot slides, but I finally made it down.  I’m just glad I wasn’t climbing up that side. The trail then follows the state border along Sawmill Brook for a little less than a mile.  After all the rain, it was more like a raging river.  Then suddenly the white blazes on the trees stopped and the trail turned left into the brook.  There was no bridge and any boulders placed for rock hopping across were totally submerged and there were mini rapids.  I had no choice but to go wading again.  The positive side of it was that my shoes and sock were already wet.  When I got to the other side, there was a sign saying I was now in Massachusetts.  That means 4 states to go.


I soon learned that the AT in the early part of Massachusetts is pretty much the drainage pathway down from Mt Everett.  It reminded me of Rocky Top and Wildcat Mtns in the Smokeys.  The first half of the climb up to the summit was walking in a flowing creek.  There was no way to hike other than in it.  The second half of the uphill was not as wet, but involved climbing up steep rocks.  In most places, I had to rely on the roughness of the rock surface to get any grip to push myself upward.  There even were periodic 8 x 8 inch wood steps that had hilti bolts attaching them to the slanted rock for steps.  It was a pretty severe climb.  Fortunately, downhill on the other side wasn’t quite as bad, but was still slow going and I was in jeopardy of missing my shuttle.  The next several miles were wet and swampy, but at least I was able to pick up my pace and get some time back.  Then, all of a sudden, the trail became dry and covered with pine needles and meandered through a dark and thick pine forest.  I was now back on track.  It even went for a short while through a wet pasture.


I did stop briefly to talk with Krafty who was hiking with her very small dog Marco.  She was dropped off that morning by Joe the shuttler.  The great thing was that she told me he has fuel canisters he sells to hikers because you can’t get them anywhere in Great Barrington.  That was significant because I was running low and it was going to take several hours to get off the trail in Dalton, Mass in a few days and somehow get to Dick’s Sporting Goods several miles from there.


Long story short, the decision to make the extra stop in Great Barrington worked out to my benefit.  The great ending to today’s post was that there’s a brewery two doors down from the Travelodge tonight!","Salisbury, CT

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636609,"Joe was picking me up at 8:30 am this morning and the diner across the street from the motel opened at 7:30.  Perfect.  That was until I got there at 7:30 am and nobody was there.  The sign on their door said open daily at 7:30 am.  This seems to happen to me a lot on this trip.  After 10 minutes, I was going to give up.  Just when I was about to walk down the street to McDonalds and hope they let me walk through the Drive-thru, a car pulled into the lot.  The women said she would open the diner, but she’s just the waitress.  She agreed to start making coffee and I could only buy a muffin or danish because the cook wasn’t there yet.  She brought coffee over and told me that depending on what I ordered, she might be able to make it for me.  I ordered an omelet and she said she could do that. She brought me my breakfast a little after 8 am just when the cook came in.  I gave the waitress a generous tip for helping me out.  
Joe dropped me off a little before 9 am and it was a sunny day without a cloud in the sky.  The temperature was in the low 50s but it felt warmer and seemed perfect for hiking.  Joe is a great guy that just likes to help hikers and doesn’t have a set fee.  He just asks for a donation.  I had a good time talking to him, but needed to get going since I was starting later than normal.  After a mile of walking through a wet grassy field to start the day, the trail went back up to the ridge line where I stayed for most of the day.
 I only crossed paths with a few other hikers today, including Bob and Maureen who Shuttler Joe told me about.  They are from New Hampshire and have section hiked all the northern states.  They are hiking Vermont to New York on this trip.  They’ve been hiking the AT for 8 years now.  They gave me some great advice on hostels in the north so I really appreciated that.  The more information I can get, the better.
 The day started off easy, and seemed to get a little harder as the day went on.  It consisted of a series of Virginia climbs (what I call 400 to 600 foot climbs in less than a mile) and I can feel it from yesterday’s 21 mile sprint.  It wasn’t as wet as yesterday, but I still had to prance my way around several flooded sections of the trail.  The best view of the day was early on from The Ledges where I could see to the west and a great view of Bear Mountain and Mt. Everett.  It’s hard to imagine that I was way up there walking along the top just yesterday morning.  I also saw 3 or 4 large beaver ponds.
 I  rolled into the Shaker Campsite a little after 5 pm.  Mark from Massachusetts was already there and was set up.  He’s hiking southbound and started a couple days ago in central Massachusetts.  He was an interesting guy, but around 8 pm we both headed for our tents.  He said it’s supposed to rain tomorrow.  I hope not because the trail is so saturated already this spring.  I can’t imagine the AT in Massachusetts being any wetter.  I’ll be sleeping in my 30 degree bag for the first time on this trip.  My wife sent it to me in Salisbury.  I’m so lucky that she’s supporting me on this trip.  She’s still working so there hasn’t been an opportunity for her to meet up with me on the trail.   She’s sent me gear 3 times already - and usually on short notice, so my IOU list is really growing.  I joke around (but I’ll seriously think about it) that I’m up to owing her two weeks of a Caribbean vacation.  Seriously though, there’s no way I could do this trip without her help and support.  I just hope she doesn’t get too used to not having me around.","Great Barrington, MA

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636610,"I’ve said before that the purpose of my journal is so I can remember things later on.  Unfortunately, sometimes people who read it, take the negative stuff personally - or they feel like I’m not allowed to dislike something.  So - that brings me to the topic of the AT in Massachusetts.  First of all, I love the scenery, varied terrain, deep forests, and the plethora of creeks and ponds.  But I have to say that I’m really disliking that so much of the AT in Massachusetts is walking in a flowing muddy pool stream, huge puddle, flooded area, or a bog.  I know it’s been rainy, but the trail in Massachusetts rarely has a drainage pathway for water to exit the walking path.  Every other state so far has had that - or you could see where trail maintainers used a shovel or hoe to direct the water off the trail.  It’s been impossible to keep my feet dry and free of mud and leaf slop since I entered the state.  Ok - this is where some of those who read this will send me a comment that says something like: “so you think Mass is bad, wait until you get to Vermont.”  Please don’t bother - I know Vermont is muddy and is known as Vermud.  I don’t know if that’s for the same reason as Massachusetts or not though.  I’ll end my Massachusetts critique with how I started.  I love a lot about Massachusetts, and it’s one of my favorite states so far.  I want to remember the good and bad.


There was one cool view of the hazy morning sky over the ridge (see above), but not many others.  The trail did walk next to Upper Goose Pond and Finerty Pond.  I didn’t see any buildings or development on either one - so they looked very peaceful and natural.


Even though I got 18.8 miles in, I wanted to go a little more since I arrived at the shelter at 3 pm.  The next shelter is 8.8 miles away and there are no designated campsites between the two.  I don’t want to do any more 27 mile days unless there’s a good reason.  Since I don’t have one, I’m just hanging out at the shelter writing this.  Nobody else is here so far.  It’s not so bad because it gives me a chance to hang up my tent rainfly (it briefly rained last night) and socks with the hope that they’ll dry up some.  My wet and muddy socks are probably a lost cause, but I have to tent tomorrow night so I would rather start with a dry rainfly if possible.

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636708,"As much as I wanted to do a few more miles yesterday, it’s good that I stayed put.  It drizzled for a couple hours in the late afternoon while I was in the shelter setting up my gear for the night and hanging up my wet tent fly across the front.  Then, shortly after 7 pm, it started raining hard.  That lasted a few hours.  It stopped late in the evening and then the temperature plummeted into the mid 30s.  I woke up to a cold howling wind, but at least the rain stopped.  I wore most of my clean clothes to ensure I stayed warm in my 30 degree bag.


I set a record this morning of 56 minutes from getting out of my bag to feet on the trail.  Admittedly, I didn’t make coffee and then ate my breakfast bars while hiking.  It was a challenge though because I was constantly dodging standing water covering the trail.  It’s hard to do while eating and without the help of trekking poles. The morning section was more of the same as yesterday.  The AT winds through a thick forest and crosses numerous creeks.  I was making good time and decided to stop for lunch in Dalton, Mass.  The trail goes through the outer streets of town and only a couple blocks from Angelina’s Sun Shop.  However, like so often on this trip, they were closed today for Mother’s Day.  So I had to go across the street and get a gas station sub.  It actually wasn’t that bad, but far from what I was hoping for.


It’s approximately a mile road walk through town before starting a one thousand foot climb.  It wasn’t bad though because it’s over a four mile stretch.  I don’t know how, but the section from Dalton to Cheshire was very dry.  There was occasional mud and flooded areas near creeks, but overall, it was a great stretch and I was able to move fairly quickly.


I originally had no plan to stop in Cheshire, but I was wearing my last pair of socks and they were soaked and muddy from this morning.  My other two pairs were as well from the first two days of Massachusetts.  I arranged for a shuttle to pick me up in Cheshire and take me to a motel in a nearby town to do laundry.  Plus, it’s supposed to storm again tonight (imagine that) and would have to sleep in my tent.  My plan was to get picked up at the ice cream store in Cheshire right near where the trail enters town.  I sent a text to shuttle driver Debbie that I’d buy her a milkshake for Mother’s Day and to let me know what flavor she preferred.  Well, guess what, the ice cream store was closed.  I actually laughed when I saw the sign in the window.  When this trip is over, I’m going to go through my journal and list all these types of incidents - just for fun.


Staying in a motel tonight won’t change my plans too much.  I’ll bypass a planned stay in North Adams, Mass tomorrow night.  Then hopefully make it to Bennington, VT Tuesday night where I can pick up my new shoes at the Post Office.


I only met a couple day hikers today.  Tomorrow morning I get to climb Mt. Greylock.  It’s the highest point in Massachusetts at near 3500 feet.  It’s been a while since I’ve had a climb that high so I hope I’m ready for it.","October Mountain Shelter

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636857,"Shuttler Debbie couldn’t pick me up until 9 am, so I had plenty of time to go to the diner across the street.  I ordered a large stack of buttermilk pancakes.  I couldn’t quite finish the pancakes, but I set myself up for the big climb up Mt. Greylock as soon as I hit the trail.  It worked, because I felt really good and the 1900 foot climb didn’t seem that tough.  It was interesting though, because a lot of it was in a dark thick wet spruce forest and reminded me of the time (very briefly) I walked on a trail in the Olympic Mountains in Washington.  Lots of standing water again too.  Eventually I got to the summit and there’s a large tower that’s a Massachusetts War Memorial.  Bascom Lodge is also up there but of course it’s closed due to Covid.  The part I don’t understand is why they turn off the water to the hose out back.  They used to let hikers get fresh water, but not anymore.


The trail slowly dropped downward while walking a ridge line for a few miles.  Eventually it drops down into North Adams, Mass, crossed the Hoosic River, and then climbs right back up 1700 feet to another ridge.  I was shooting for a camping area, which would leave me with nearly 17 miles the next day into Bennington, VT.  For the first time in several days, there was a warm evening sun and I arrived at the campsite a little after 5.  I really really wanted to at least get to the state border 4 miles or so further, and maybe get to the Seth Warner Shelter approximately 6 miles away for a shorter day tomorrow.  That means getting to the shelter between 7:30 and 8 pm.  Worst case is I’d stealth camp somewhere in VT (where it’s legal).  The trail was difficult for the first couple miles after the campsite and involved a steep rocky climb.  After that, though, it was fairly tame (other than the mud and standing water in numerous places).  I arrived at the state border where I’m done with Massachusetts and starting Vermont.  I didn’t see a state border sign, but there was a sign welcoming you to the Vermont Long Trail.  It goes north from the state line to Canada and is supposedly the first developed long distance hiking trail in the US.  The two trails are the same for the first 105 miles of the state until the AT moves east.  I was an hour away and on track to get there at 7:20 pm.  All of a sudden, the sky turned dark and it started to rain.  There’s nothing I could do but put on my rain gear and pack cover and keep moving.  I finally arrived at the shelter around 7:30 pm.  Professor from Vermont was the only one there, plus someone in their tent who I never met.  Professor was doing the Long Trail for the second time (2016) and started today.  He’s a grad student at Loyola-Chicago in Philosophy and has nearly completed his Doctorate degree.  He was an interesting guy and I hope I run into him again.  It’s supposed to be in the 30s again tonight.  I’d rather have slept in my tent to stay warmer, but didn’t feel like setting it up in the dusk while raining.","Cheshire, Mass

It was really cold last night and I wasn’t warm like I was in my zero degree bag, but I wasn’t cold either.  I could see my breath in the shelter this morning and didn’t want to get up.  I could afford to take my time because I did extra miles last night and could get away with being lazy.  Professor started to get packed, so I did the same and was hiking by 8:30 am.


The trail was wet and muddy again, but I didn’t expend too much energy dodging it since I was getting new shoes today in Bennington.  The AT took me near two large beaver ponds.  The photo above is of the second one and the wall of sticks and debris was really cool.  There were some really great views today, but I don’t want to show a Mountain View on my journal every day and enjoy mixing it up.  I have hundreds of photos that aren’t captured on this site.


After I got to the motel, I headed to the post office to get my new shoes.  My sister Carol who lives in eastern NH near the coast ordered a pair of Altra trail runners with a thicker sole than the ones I’ve been using.  I look forward to the extra padding.  I’m incredibly lucky to have her help because she gets them at a discount and had to pay a lot for express delivery to get them to me before the old ones fell apart.


I met a couple Section Hikers early today and two more at the end.  Pokey Stogey and Sugar Bear from Georgia are doing a southbound long section hike from Bennington, VT to the NY-CT border.  Sugar Bear is vlogging, but his YouTube channel isn’t up yet.  When I got to the Rt 9 parking lot, Old Women from MD was there waiting for her hiking partner (who she never met yet) Patches (from NH).  I don’t recall how they got together, but they’re section hiking south on this trip from Manchester Center to Rt 9.  I met Patches later that night when the two of them were at the same restaurant I went to for dinner.  Old Women (she’s not old btw) has hiked the entire AT up to Rt 9 and Patches has done Georgia and the northeastern states.  Since they’re hiking south, I’ll run into them in the next couple days.","Seth Warner Shelter

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636929,"The weather this morning reminded me of the Talking Heads song with the lyrics “Same as it ever was”.
I looked outside my motel window this morning and it was raining - again.  What I’d give for a nice warm sunny day.  Pete the motel owner gave me a ride back to the trail at 8:30 am and at least it wasn’t raining any longer for the 2400 foot hike up Glastonbury Mountain.  Climbs like this are tough, but I would    always prefer to have them right out of the gate rather than the end of the day.  Right before reaching the Goddard Shelter near the summit, I caught up to Mark from CT.  I met him briefly yesterday in the parking lot while waiting on my shuttle and he was a resuming his section hike that he started on May 1.  He’s going north from Massachusetts to Maine.  When I arrived at the shelter for lunch, Professor was already there.  It was good to talk to him again.  They were both stopping at the next shelter, but I was planning on pushing on to the following one so I did a quick lunch and was off.


The weather was sporadic all morning and afternoon.  The sun would come out for 5 minutes, then a rain cloud would be overhead and it would rain for awhile.  At one point, it was even sleeting.  I stopped multiple times to put on and off my rain jacket and pants.  Finally, in mid afternoon, the sun stayed out.  It felt great to hike in the afternoon sun without the worry of getting to the shelter with the option of tenting.  The weather called for a low of 32 tonight, so I wanted to sleep in my tent to get the extra warmth.


The trail was slow going today with lots of turns and winding around.  Also lots of short (and one really high one) ups and downs.  There were more rocky areas than yesterday, but less stream crossings.  Right before the Story Spring Shelter where I was going to stop, there were three more large beaver ponds.  I also started seeing moose droppings on the trail today.  I’m hoping to catch a glimpse of one on this trip. 


I rolled into the shelter at 5:30 pm and Tad (Mass) and Emily (VT) were set up in the shelter and were collecting wood for a fire.  There were lots of tent sites to choose from, but none were very level or free of roots or rocks.  I found a decent spot and set up, then went to the shelter for dinner.  Tad and Emily are friends who are section hiking north from North Adams to Bromley.  They started May 8.  We had a tough time with the fire since it has rained so much, but eventually got it going.  It felt great to sit by the fire and talk with people.


My new shoes worked great.  The extra padding was well noted.  Thanks Carol!!!","VT Route 9

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636984,"Finally!  The sun was shining from sun up to sun down.  And what a great day for it to.  Early in the day was a climb up through the spruce forest of Stratton Mountain at just under 4000 feet.  I climbed the fire tower and got a clear and beautiful 360 view of the Vermont Green Mountains.  I could see Mt. Greylock in Massachusetts too, as well as some ski slopes.  I couldn’t tell what most of the peaks were, but the Guthooks App says you can see all the way to New Hampshire.  Even though the sun was out and it was in the high 50s at the time, I had to walk through several sections of snow on the way down of the north side of the mountain.  After descending Stratton Mountain, I came to a huge pond (more like a lake to me) in the mountains called Stratton Pond.  There was a tent last pad next to the shore that said it was designated for the shelter caretaker.  There was a canoe there as well and I think I’ve read about hikers taking it out for a spin.  I wasn’t about to wrestle it all the way from the tent pad to the pond, and back again, so I just kept moving.  I’ll bet this is a great place to cool off for those hiking through here in the summer.  I did run into southbound section hikers Old Women and Patches who I met a couple days ago in Bennington.  It was just before the Stratton Mountain summit.  I didn’t see anyone else today.The rest of today wasn’t too different than yesterday.  A couple wet spots, but overall, the AT in Vermont has been in good shape.  There were however, a few sections with a lot of blow downs, but nothing significant.
Vermont is one of the two states on the AT that I’ve never been in and I have to say it’s the most scenic since the Smokey Mountains.  I’m really looking forward to the rest of the trip since I’ve not seen terrain like the White Mountains and the forests of Maine before.  If everything goes well in the next week, I’ll be in a position to relax a bit and cut my mileage down and still finish before my pre-trip goal date of July 1.  I don’t take anything for granted though, so I’m not going to relax just yet.  Since it was warm and sunny, I decided to keep going past the enclosed Spruce Peak Shelter that has a wood stove in it and bunks.  It’s supposed to rain again the next couple of days, so I decided to add some miles to make the next two days shorter.One other thing of note.  I passed the three quarters done point this afternoon.  Only 537 miles to go. LOL - that’s still a long way to go.","Story Spring Shelter
",Bromley Shelter,"May 13, Thu",23.20
Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637141,"It only got down to around 40, so I didn’t have to sleep with an extra layer and I got a pretty good night’s sleep.  Nobody came into the shelter last night near or after dusk so I didn’t have to worry about being quiet in the morning and got on the trail just before 7 am.  The first thing was to finish the climb up Bromley Mountain.  It was about another mile uphill, but the view from the summit was worth it.  Two ski lifts are at the top of the mountain as well as a warming hut.  I heard they keep it unlocked so hikers can sleep inside - and sure enough it was.  There’s no running water or bathroom, but plenty of room for multiple people.  I didn’t think to see if there was electricity, but even if there was, I’d be surprised if it was on.  


As soon as you get back down from Bromley Mountain, the AT goes back up about 1000 feet to Styles Peak.  This must be a home for several moose because their droppings were everywhere - I mean everywhere!   I kept my eyes and ears open to try to spot one, but never did spot one.  I’m a bit surprised they’d be at this elevation because I’m used to seeing them on tv hanging around in ponds and in lakes - but what do I know.  A few miles later, the AT climbs up some slanted rocks to get to Baker Peak.  The Guthooks App talked about fantastic views from up there, but I must have not looked in the right direction because it seemed like you had to look over the tops of trees.  It was one of those climbs in which you frequently have to put away the trekking poles.  By the way, when I was about one third of the way up, I couldn’t believe it.  There was a pile of moose droppings in the rocks.  Either moose are much more agile and good climbers then I thought, or the droppings I’ve been seeing aren’t from moose.


Like I’ve seen in other sections of Vermont, the trail went by Griffith Lake and Little Rock Pond.  I’m at the shelter for the night that’s next to Little Rock Pond.  I just love these ponds and lakes that are up in the mountains.  They usually have really rocky shorelines and ledges around the water.  Sometimes, they’re only there because of beavers.


Since I got to the shelter around 3:30 pm, I toyed with the idea of going a couple more miles and setting up my tent.  Just then it started to rain - so that solidified my decision to just end early today.  I have 12.5 miles tomorrow where I’ll get picked up by Flipakey where she’ll take me to her hostel in Rutland.  I’m figuring 4 more days to get to Hanover, NH - which is just over the state line.  I was planning on taking a day off there, but I’m not sure if the hostel is open and the two hotels in town are seriously expensive due to that’s where Ivy League school Dartmouth College is.  By the way, there’s NOTHING that I see between Killington (just after Rutland) and Hanover - so once I leave the Rutland/Killington area, there’s no zero option unless I take a day off in a shelter (Not).","Bromley Shelter

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637143,"I had the shelter to myself again last night so it makes for an easy morning to get ready.  It’s difficult trying to be quiet.  The first thing I saw when I got on the trail was the sun coming up over the mountain and shining onto Little Rock Pond.  It was another sunny morning and probably in the mid 40s - which was very comfortable to hike in.  Like so often happens, the day started with a heart pumping climb up to a ridge.  When I got up there, I came across a couple of “rock gardens”.  They looked like play areas with thousands of rocks that people used to make cairns or other “works of art”.  The trail then went down 1200 feet only to climb right back up 1000 feet.  The trail from the shelter to VT Route 140 had a lot of blow downs where the trees had snapped.  There must have been a nasty storm to have done that level of damage.  After crossing VT 140, however, the trail was clear for the rest of the day.  Right before getting to the parking lot at VT 103 for my shuttle, the trail goes on a swinging suspension bridge high above a river gorge with rapids.  It was beautiful to watch the water gushing through, but also a bit scary while crossing on the narrow walking bridge since it moved so much when you’re on it.  Flipakey was on time so I was planning on enjoying a little extra time in the afternoon instead of trying to get all the town chores done with a tight window (like normally happens).  I might be slack packing tomorrow but not sure yet.  Flipakey made the suggestion and I might just take her up on it.","Little Rock Pond Shelter

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637365,"I got a late start this morning because Flipakey couldn’t take me back to the trail until 8:45 am.  That’s ok though because I was carrying a light pack today for the climb up Killington Peak - which is the second highest peak in VT.  Before that, the trail started out with consecutive steep uphills of 600 feet each and only over a half mile long.  Then, the climb up to Killington Peak lasts for 7 miles and reaches an altitude of 4000 feet.  It reminded me of some of the long climbs in North Carolina.  I finally got to the top - well almost.  There’s a 0.2 mile steep side trail to the actual summit, but I decided not to do the extra 0.4 mile round trip due to it started to rain when I got up there.  I had to eat a very quick lunch and I was off.  Shortly after lunch and still near the summit of Killington Peak, I finally had my first bear sighting.  I saw movement up the mountain to my side in the forest.  It was a black bear (looked just like the Vermont Teddy Bear) lumbering up the mountain about 30 yards from me.  Then she stopped and looked at me.  It was then that I saw two black furry behinds scampering up a tree.  The mom looked up at them, then at me, then took off into the woods up the mountain side.  I couldn’t see the cubs through the foliage, but decided it would be best if I just kept moving and leave them be.  The sky then got really dark and it started to spit a little - with thunder as well.  The best way to stop the rain is to stop hiking, take off my backpack, and put on my raincoat and pack cover.  Sure enough, it worked.  The sun came out in minutes.
 There were 2 Day Hikers today, but that was it and I didn’t even talk to them.  The climb up to Killington Peak was long and difficult, but offered no really good views unless you went on a side trail up to the peak.  Like I said, it was drizzling and overcast, so I didn’t bother.  After coming down from the mountain, it’s right back up again for about 600 feet.  After crossing VT Route 4, the Long Trail went off to the left and goes to Canada.  Eventually, the AT goes through Gifford Woods State Park where there were a decent number of campers out for a Sunday night in May.  The walk along Kent Pond after that was nice as well and there were several people fishing from the shore.  The day ended with about a quarter mile board walk (hey - part of the AT in VT IS flat).  Flipakey shuttled me back to her hostel from there.  It was a long and difficult day and I would have really had a hard time if I had a full pack.  The highlights of today in order that they occurred were 1) Reaching the 500 miles to go mark (btw - the sign wasn’t in the correct place for the 2021 mileage but hey, it was close enough), 2) Reaching the 1700 mile mark, and 3) Finally seeing a bear and her two Cubs (well - I saw their butts).  Overall, it was a good day.","VT Route 103 Rutland

I got a shuttle into Hanover for food supply and lunch, then spent all afternoon doing pretty much nothing - except fretting.


I’m getting a 7 am shuttle to the trail tomorrow, so hopefully I’ll get some miles in before the bugs and heat.  It’s supposed to be 82 tomorrow.  Well - maybe this warm spell will melt some of the snow still in the mountains.  Word is that hikers last week had to buy micro spikes to get through the ice.  I shipped mine home after the Smokeys and I’m not about to have them shipped back again.  I’ll just take it slowly  and try to enjoy the mountains rather than worrying about painful climbs, miles, bugs, pace, or keeping a schedule.  I’m not sure when I’ll post next due to cell service, but I’ll post if I can.

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637585,"McKenzie from the hostel dropped me off at the trail at 7:20 am.  My plan was to buy a Gatorade and chocolate protein milk at the gas station where the trail leaves the city streets of Hanover.  Their website says they’re open at 6 am.  When I pulled on the door, it was locked - but there were workers inside.  Apparently, the gas pumps are open at 6 am but their convenience store doesn’t open until 8 am (eye roll).  The trail is pretty steep uphill for a little over a mile out of town before it levels out a little.  Then back up again towards something called Velvet Rocks.  I elected not to take the side trail because it was just a matter of time before the bugs came out.  I had put on some repellent at the hostel, but not on my face - so I was hoping I could get away with not using my head net.  When they came active, they were bad for a short while, then after that I just had to periodically brush them from my face and ears.  The next five miles were surprisingly easy, but I resisted the urge to hike fast.  I knew there were two good climbs today and I planned a 17 mile day.  The first big ascent was up South Moose Mountain, and that seemed fairly tame and with a forgiving slope.  After the summit was a good place to stop for lunch because Moose Mountain Shelter was not far off the main trail.  It was getting pretty warm at that point and sitting in the shade and eating sounded like a good idea.  The shelter didn’t have a picnic table like most do, but did have a bench with a great view of the mountains and valley to the south.  Right after lunch is a small climb up North Moose Mountain.   There was a long 1300 foot drop followed by a steep 1200 foot uphill.  I was sweating pretty heavily (it’s been in the 80s for a couple days now) going up but this climb gave some great views of the mountains coming tomorrow from Holts Ledge. At this point, I only had about a mile to the shelter and it wasn’t even 3 pm yet.   I stopped at the shelter (0.3 mile side trail) and pulled out my phone to see if I had any options.  There was a campsite 4 or 5 miles further, but it’s at the top of Smarts Mountain.  Apparently there’s no water up there - and not for 4 more miles or so after that.  The climb would be 2200 feet at the end of the day and more than 20 miles - plus I’d be carrying two full bottles of water up there.  I saw a better option.  Go three more relatively easy miles and stealth camp off of a side trail.  There’s a creek right there too.  I got to the stealth site just before 5 pm and set up my tent.  This will work well because now I can take on the 2000 foot climb first thing in the morning.  If I get an early start, if I feel good, and it’s not too hot, I could tackle Smarts Mountain, Mt. Cube and Mt. Mist and camp at Wachipauka Pond.  That would set me up to possibly climb Mt. Moosilauke and get to the hostel in three days rather than four.  Mt. Moosilauke is more than 4000 feet high and one of the highest peaks in NH.  If I can’t make it to the pond tomorrow, I can always fall back to my original plan of 4 days.  I saw one day hiker today and two trail runners (both near Hanover).  I don’t have cell service at my tent site so I can’t post my journal - or find out how far Rumbles and No Filter got today.","Hanover Adventure Tours Hostel

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637707,"I know my trail name is Mr. Freeze because I’m always cold.  However, I’m finding out how much of a wuss (sp?) I am in the heat and humidity.  It goes back to my first day in NY when I crashed and burned when it was in the mid 80s, then a couple tough last days in VT, and now the first two days in NH.  It was probably in the low 80s today and I had an outside range goal of doing 21.9 miles.  I totally underestimated the first two smaller mountains (Smarts and Cube), and by mid afternoon, no matter how much I drank, I was sweating faster than I could drink.  The climb up Smarts Mountain was steep and rocky, but it was first thing in the morning and I was fresh.  The ascent of Mt. Cube was much more difficult because it got really hot and the climb didn’t seem to want to end.  I finally reached the summit and sat in the sun for lunch on the large rocky top with a great view.  
From 1 pm to 3 pm, I felt like a zombie and it was clear there’s no way I was going to make the 21.9 miles up and over Mt. Mist to Wachipauka Pond.  I also was doubting I could make my backup destination of the summit of Mt. Mist (20.8) where there’s a stealth campsite.  I did have enough to push to my second backup (18.9) to a stealth site by a creek just after NH Rt 25C.  The downside was that the mosquitoes were crazy today and I knew it would be miserable by the creek, but I had no more gas in the tank.  As I was approaching the road around 4:45 pm, I checked the Guthooks App again to see the comments to get an idea of where the tent site was.  I scrolled farther down and saw there’s a bar (The Greenhouse) and restaurant in the middle of nowhere just 0.2 miles north of where the AT crosses the road.  It says they’re open Th - Sun.  Ok - I didn’t get my hopes up because I’ve played this game way too many times on this trip already.  As I got closer, I could smell the unquestionable aroma of a country bar in the woods.  I grew up snowmobiling in northern Michigan and have been to a number of these places - and they all smell the same.  YES!!! It was open.   Some people reading this know exactly what I’m talking about.  I walked in and Gary the owner welcomed me and asked me to put my pack in their side fenced yard where there are several picnic tables.  He said I’m welcome to camp there too.  Wow - even if the bar wasn’t open, camping in a grass field beats setting up and tearing down my tent in the mosquito-clouded woods.  I changed out of my soaked hiking shorts and shirt and put on dry clothes.  I cleaned up the best I could with Clorox wipes and in their bathroom and took a seat at the bar for dinner.  I enjoyed talking with several of the locals at the bar and wolfed down a burger and onion rings.  The two guys next to me were talking about classic rock groups when I found out they were going to play live music from 7 to 10 pm.  As it got near 7 pm, every table and seat at the bar was taken.  The band turned out to be very good and I stayed until 9:30 pm.  I had a really good time after a pretty tough day.  The best part of the night was when I asked Gary for my bill.  He said it was paid for.  A local couple (Ted and Jane) I met at the bar and talked to throughout the night paid my dinner and beer tab.  The sad part is that I didn’t even know it and didn’t thank them when they left.  That was great trail magic for sure.  I’m not sure what I’m going to do tomorrow.  I want to go for the 14 miles to get to, up, and over Mt. Moosilauke but that will be tough.  Moosilauke is the first of the really high and steep NH mountains.  The other mountains this high on the AT before this were not as steep - and the climb down is supposed to be worse.  The App warns you to not try it when it’s raining or wet.  My option is to do a near zero of 6 miles and spend the day at the Jeffers Brook Shelter located at the base of the mountain.  I would start up Moosilauke first thing in the morning as originally planned.


I finally ran across a few more section hikers today.  Buzz from NH was coming down Smarts Mountain shortly before I got to the top.  I didn’t get much info from him, but he was finishing in Hanover.  I also met Little by Little (Nashville) and FDGB (falls down goes boom) (Syracuse) on Mt.

Cube, I zonked (my term for no energy zombie hiking).  I never felt in danger of dehydration or anything, but hiking in the afternoon - even the smaller uphills - was a chore.  Ok - so I got lucky and had a fun night at Green House.  I need more of those nights on my trip to offset the hard work this takes every day.  I only had service while inside the restaurant and using their WIFI, so I was able to send texts to my wife.  Then when I went outside to my tent, it wouldn’t pick up the WIFI - and I couldn’t post the day’s journal, I couldn’t call or text my wife, and couldn’t check the weather for the next day.  I didn’t try to connect until I was in my tent and changed into my sleeping clothes - and by then the bar was closing.  Too many unknowns while lying in my tent and I couldn’t sleep.  Oh - and the grass field I was renting in was loaded with ticks.  That all made for a restless night.I awoke this morning at 5 am to grey skies, wet grass, 4 ticks in my tent, and a very wet rainfly.  Great!  The comments on the Guthooks App strongly advise against coming down from Mt. Moosilauke if it’s wet.  So - the option of trying to do 14 miles today up and over Moosilauke was getting less desirable.  If I decide to pull up short today at the shelter, it’s only a 6 mile day and what will I do all day at a shelter?  I decided to pack up and see how I felt.  If the skies cleared and I felt good, I will probably go for it.  I got back on the trail at 7:10 am and figured I’d get to the shelter a little before 10 am.  I could re-evaluate at that time.  I had heavy legs on the uphills, but felt ok (not great) on any level stretches.  Ok - we’ll see.  By the way, I had to walk with my head net on because the mosquitoes were relentless.  It wasn’t hot, but the humidity was sky high and I was sweating like crazy.  The going for it option wasn’t looking good. 
I kept trying for cell service, but had none anywhere in the six miles to the shelter - and none at the shelter.  About a mile from the shelter, I briefly talked with a guy hiking the other direction with fishing poles on his way to the large pond I passed (that I was hoping to camp at last night).  He said it’s supposed to rain around 2 o’clock with a chance of lightning.  Ouch - that’s just about the time I would be at the summit of Mt. Moosilauke.  Crap!  Now what should I do?  I arrived at the shelter before 10 and was really wrestling with what to do.  While debating with myself sitting in the shelter, I was being swarmed by mosquitoes.  If I decide to stay, it would be a very long day with not much to do other than fight off the vampires.  I decided to eat an early lunch and likely leave.  I ate and was packing up when I saw the grey clouds rolling in.  At that moment, I decided to not be an idiot and will stay put for the day.  I need the rest, my legs are heavy, it’s as humid as Hell, it’s in the mid 70s, it’s likely going to rain, and possibly lightning while I’m up on a 4800 foot peak.  Staying also puts me on my original schedule - so I’m not losing a day.  It also allows me to dry my tent, sleeping bag, shoes, and clothes (from sweat). Since I’m the only one here, I’ll put up my tent (minus the rain fly) up in the shelter and hang out in there for most of the afternoons and research the next few sections of the trail on Guthooks and in the AWOL guide book.  No cell service or internet so I’m pretty limited on how to pass the time.  I’ll probably collect some wood and make a campfire in the pit tonight.  The problem I can’t solve is I have no way to know what the weather will be like tomorrow.  We’ll see.","NH Rt 25C The Greenhouse
",Jeffers Brook Shelter,"May 22, Sat",6
Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637718,"I slept really well last night in the shelter.  Nobody else showed up so I could stick to my early start plan without worrying about being loud this morning.  I slept in my tent in the shelter without the rainfly and it was great.  I stayed cool, but never had to worry about mosquitoes.  Setting up a tent in shelters is bad etiquette, but I was alone so it was not a problem.  Even if another person or two showed up, there was plenty of room for them to do the same - and I’m pretty sure they would have.I didn’t realize until just now that I surpassed the “less than 400 miles to go” mark yesterday - and went over 1800 today (barely).  The sky was dark and grey and it was really humid again this morning.  I tried really hard to drink water all day yesterday at the shelter to get as hydrated as possible for today.  And it was easy to do since there was a creek 50 yards in front of the shelter.  The only problem with that was - well, I’m 60 so enough said.  I got up at 4:45 am with a plan to take my time getting ready and eating a little more breakfast than normal - and of course drinking extra too.  I got back on trail at 6:08 am (didn’t make my 6 am target - no surprise there) and felt pretty good.  It was immediately uphill, and would stay that way for the next 5 miles to the summit of Mt. Moosilauke.  I remember whining about roots back in North Carolina.  Well, I owe roots an apology.  As of today, I love roots.  I used them all morning as small steps going up the mountain.  I found out back in Georgia I save energy on uphills by using my feet and small lower leg muscles with smaller low steps instead of my quads and thighs on higher steps.  Lots of small steps are easier for me than less big steps.It never rained while going up the mountain but I got rained on from the wind blowing the water droplets from the trees.  That’s ok though, because I was sweating a lot and it actually felt good.  In addition, as I got above 4000 feet, there were no more mosquitoes.  Then I started to see bits of left over snow and ice here and there.  It was just like the old days at the start of my trip.  Cold, snow, wet, no bugs.  Finally, the steep climb tapered off and the sign said 0.9 miles to the summit.  I got passed by trail runners Jules, Becky and her dog Oscar.  We talked for probably ten minutes and I enjoyed the break.  Jules is a science teacher in Lyme, NH, and Becky is a neuro science Professor at UMass.  They run and hike the local mountain trails all year and said they’re frequently the ones breaking the trails in late winter and early spring.  They are very tough women - and 2 year old Oscar (some kind of a hound) was really cool - and loves being out there.  The trail started to go up again as I approached the summit.  Soon there were no more scrubby pine trees or mossy grass - just rocks.  The trail was marked by cairns and the wind was really whipping now.  I had to put on my rain jacket because I was now in a rain cloud and the misty rain was blowing sideways.  I finally started to go down the mountain and it was fairly easy going.  Then the trail was a stream and really muddy - clay kind of mud.  Then, it started to go downward.  When I say downward, I mean steep downward.  It was slow going to ensure I stepped in the right places.  For about a half mile, the trail is adjacent to a steep fast flowing rocky mountain brook with several waterfalls.  It was extremely beautiful and would love to do this as a day hike on a nice sunny day.Mt. Moosilauke assessment:  I think it was good to not try it yesterday afternoon.  I could definitely have made it ok, but it would have been a struggle and would have finished late in the day.  That would have made for a non-enjoyable and rushed town visit last night.  I don’t know if there was lightning on the mountain yesterday afternoon, but I do know it did rain a lot.  Therefore, I have to say it was good to wait until today.  Lastly - as tough of a climb as it was in the morning, I actually enjoyed the hike today.  I wasn’t rushed and I got to look around a little more than I usually do - and I kind of liked it.  The rest of NH is going to be intentionally shorter days so I can “enjoy my hike” and “stay safe”.  The reason I say that is because pretty much everyone I’ve met on the trail tells me to either “stay safe” or “enjoy your hike”.","Jeffers Brook Shelter
",NH Rt 112 Kinsman Notch,"May 23, Sun",8.40
Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637854,"I enjoyed my 20 hours in North Woodstock, but I was a bit disappointed in the resupply options.  I made due with what they have, but I just don’t feel good about the food I bought for the next 3 days.  Marlene the shuttle driver took me back to the trail head about 8:15 am and I was feeling good that I only have an 11.5 mile day planned.  I started climbing immediately out of Kinsman Notch for 700 steep feet.  I went very slowly to conserve energy for the even bigger ascent up South Kinsman Mountain - and with the climb up Mt. Wolf up next.  The air was cool, the sun was shining, and the bugs weren’t out yet.  With all the early uphills, I was averaging only about 1.5 miles per hour.  The trail wound around the forest and constantly up and down through the spruce forest and over boulders as large as a house.


After going up and over Mt. Wolf, I needed a break and was really hungry.  I stopped at Eliza Brook Shelter and took a long 40 minute break.  Gary (local section hiker and trail maintainer) stopped into the shelter as I was eating my lunch.  He seemed to know everything about the White Mountains hiking trails.  He was just hiking a loop today of several trails.
As soon as I was done eating, the dreaded climb up South Kinsman Mountain was waiting for me on the other side of the Brook.  It’s 2000 feet up over 2-1/2 miles and the Guthooks App comments talk about how difficult it is and that you can’t use your trekking poles for much of it.  The Guthooks comments were right!  It was the hardest uphill I’ve done so far.  In several places I had to stop and figure out how to get to the next level of rocks.  I grabbed roots, trees, and rocks to pull myself up in numerous places.  It went on forever.  Finally, when you reach the top, you get a 360 degree view of the White Mountains - spectacular.  But the Whites weren’t done with me today yet.  Before I get to the shelter for the night, I had to drop down 400 feet and then back up another 300 feet to the summit on North Kinsman Mountain.  The distances aren’t bad on paper, but (like the rest of today) it required numerous climbing down and climbing up large rocks using my hands.  The trail was extremely slow going today and was a total body workout.  I saw Gary again on the summit of South Kinsman Mountain and he had hiked up ahead of me (with his little day pack) for his first time and felt it’s one of the five most difficult climbs in the Whites.  He clarified that most of the others in that group aren’t on the AT.  I know it doesn’t really mean anything, but I’ll get my hopes up and pray that I won’t see anything too much harder than that.  I’m sure I’ll hear from those who will tell me otherwise, but right now I’m feeling better that I was able to do it without that much of a struggle.  I rolled into Kinsman Pond Shelter a little after 4:30 pm.  I hiked 11.5 miles today in 8 hours and 15 minutes. I did take a long lunch break and another 10 minutes up on South Kinsman Mountain BSing, but it was a very difficult and slow day.  I’m looking forward to tomorrow because I’m supposed to be in one of the most scenic stretches of the Whites (Little Haystack, Lincoln, Lafayette, and Garfield) and the weather is suppose to cooperate.  As of 7:30 pm when I’m writing this, I’m the only one at the shelter - so that makes it 4 in a row (I think) that I’m solo.  The shelter I’m at is located 50 yards from beautiful Kinsman Pond.  I really hope it’s a sunny morning tomorrow so I can get a good photo for the journal.","NH Rt 112 Kinsman Notch

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637856,"Wow!  Nothing personal to the beautiful scenery in the Smokey Mountains, but the White Mountains stretch of Little Haystack,  Lincoln, and Lafayette are now the leaders on the Mr. Freeze list of best views on the AT (so far).  Getting up there was really hard, but once I was above the tree line and saw what I saw, I actually felt re-energized.  I was very lucky because it was a mostly sunny day with clear views in all directions.  I could see where I was yesterday and this morning, as well as Mt. Washington in the distance. I knew it was going to be a tough day with two big climbs and three smaller ones.  However, it was extremely slow going right out of the shelter this morning coming down North Kinsman Mountain.  In several places, I had to grab onto trees or the jagged boulders themselves just to get down to the next step or level.  Finally the downhill ended and I came across the Lonesome Lake Hut.  I know they’re not open yet, but I could hear voices inside so I went in.  There were 5 or 6 young 20 something “Croo” members cleaning and preparing the shelter for business on June 2 (I think).  There are multiple huts in the White Mountains where people pay upwards of $200 to sleep in a bunk and get fed by the Croo.  The huts allow 2 AT thru-hikers to stay and sleep on the floor for free if they do a work-for-stay job.  The hikers also get any left over dinner and breakfast food. Because I’m an early starter, and the huts are opening late this year, I missed out on that.  I asked a bunch of questions about the lodge, Lake of the Cloud hut dungeon, Mt. Washington Visitor Center, and several others to get information on what’s coming down the trail for me.  For example, if the lodge or visitor center cafeterias are open, I can pack less food.  The kids felt bad that they weren’t helpful, but they didn’t know.  They did have a plate of homemade fudge brownies for $2 each sitting out for hikers that came through.  I bought two and scarfed them down in seconds flat.  Then, the main girl in charge (who also baked the brownies), handed me a bag of store bakery chocolate chip cookies for free.  It was my lucky day!  Trail Magic before 7:30 am.  Back to the trail today.  I hiked under I-93 this morning and believe it’s the final interstate I’ll cross on the trip.  It’s nothing significant, other than it seems like a milestone each time I crossed one.  After coming down from Mt. Lafayette, I only had a couple miles to the shelter.  But, the steepest uphill of the day still had to be tackled.  The climb up Mt. Garfield is only 600 feet or so, but it’s all in about 0.4 miles.  It doesn’t help that I’ve already done 14 miles and several uphills already.  It was difficult, but nothing I haven’t seen already - and nothing like going up South Kinsman Mountain yesterday.  I’m going to try to get up really early and get 17.5 miles in tomorrow and get a shuttle into North Conway.  I first have to finish the steep descent down Mt. Garfield, and then do a very steep and high South Twin Mountain.  A comment on Guthooks says after the climb, it’s a fairly tame trail all the way to NH Rt 302.  If that’s the case, I should be able to do that kind of mileage without too much problem.  However, Guthooks comments aren’t always accurate, a day hiker told me today there’s still a lot of snow and ice on the downward side, and it’s supposed to rain (possibly heavy) in the afternoon.  We’ll see.","Kinsman Pond Shelter

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637957,"I set a personal record and was on the “trail” at 5:34 am.  I read that much of today’s trek was tame compared to the rest of the White’s.  Almost immediately after leaving the spur trail from the shelter, the trail is a sheer drop and it’s in a flowing rocky boulder creek bed.  I had to grab onto trees and roots to lower myself down and inched my way down this section.  After a mile or so of slow and careful maneuvering, it got a little better - but still not easy.  I knew I had to climb the steep and brutal South Twin Mountain, so making good time didn’t seem like it was going to happen.  Since there’s no cell service for the final 8 or 9 miles of the trail today, (and including at the trail head), I had to contact the shuttle driver early on and guess what time I’ll be at the parking lot.  Since I had no idea what the trail conditions were later on, I had to give a conservative guess so he’s not waiting on me to show up.  So - I said 4 pm - with the hope I’d get there between 3 and 3:30.  After slugging my way up the rocky shelf to the summit of South Twin Mountain, I took in a couple quick views and photos and had to march on.  I had to walk on snow and ice for much of the next 3 miles between peaks and it was more slow going.  Fortunately, the drop down between peaks wasn’t bad and the climbs weren’t too high.  After Zealand Mountain, the trail got a little more forgiving and I was able to make up time.  Then, after the Zealand Falls Hut, the trail was relatively flat and actually smooth - and dare I say - easy.  I was able to get to the trail head in plenty of time for my shuttle into North Conway.  The chore now is to figure out how to get through the Presidents in the next 4 to 5 days.  I have to factor in the bad weather coming - along with it being Memorial Day weekend.  That means competing for camping spots.  The plan is to hike for a few days with No Filter and Rumbles, so at least I’ll have others to help me figure things out. That will be a nice change for me.","Garfield Ridge Campsite

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638121,"Part of stopping in a town is to do laundry, plan the next leg of the trip, and get to a store for a resupply of food and toiletries (and eat a lot).  The first step is figuring out where the next resupply option is.  Then reviewing the distances and topography to determine target locations for the nights.  That takes time, and by the time I got to the hotel (25 miles from the trail head), showered, and went to eat, that left little time to do everything described above.  The best part of last night was going to dinner with Rumbles and No Filter.  They were kind enough to let me join them on the next section through the Presidential range.  The security of having them around has lifted some of the anxiety I had about climbing Mt. Washington tomorrow and doing the Presidential Traverse (Pierce, Washington, Eisenhower, Monroe, Washington, Clay, Jefferson, Adam’s, Madison).  The weather is supposed to be bad at the 6k foot (plus) mountain, so doing it with someone else provides some reassurance. We got a ride back to the trail with shuttler Bill - who’s an encyclopedia of knowledge when it comes to the White Mountains.  The initial part of today’s climb up to the Webster Cliffs and Mt. Webster wasn’t overly steep, but all uphill and I was sweating profusely.  Then as we neared the elevation of the cliffs, it turned into a scary high wind gust situation.  The backpacks were like a sail and we were being blown against the rocks.  I had to walk in a crouch to not lose my balance and hold onto my hat when a big gust would come. The wind on my sweating upper body was chilling so I had to put on my rain jacket.  Meanwhile the trail was one sheer cliff to climb up after another.  In some places, we’d go around a turn and run into a really high wall of rock.  Since the AT is not always blazed very well in the Whites, we’d think we missed a turn.  In most cases, there was nowhere else to go, so up we’d climb.  Funny (well not so funny really), after we’d climb up this 20 foot rock face, there would be a white blaze on a rock or tree.  Really?  What good is that if you can’t see it before you put your life on a limb climbing up there.  It was probably the scariest situation I’ve had so far on the trip.  The trail dipped into the forest for a mile and then climbed some more up to Mt. Jackson where the wind was whipping ferociously.  We took some quick pictures and started back down into the trees to get some relief.  At this point it was just under 2 miles to the Nauman Campsite.  It was only 6.4 miles today (pretty much all uphill) but the campsite is strategically located for hikers to get a fresh start to get up and over Mt. Washington the next day.  I needed a shorter day today anyway to get some rest.  I’m in my tent as I’m writing this and my tent is being blown around - but nothing like back in Virginia when I thought my tent poles were going to snap.  At least the Nauman Campsite is located on the more wind protected side of the mountain.  I met Black Bear on the trail as he passed us, and then again at the campsite.  He’s from Maine and is finishing his 2016 thru-hike where he had to get off the trail due to an injury.  It took several years for everything to heal to the point he was allowed to hike again.  Tomorrow is the big day.  It’s supposed to be a high in the low 30s on Mt. Washington with wind chills in the single digits.  Then a combination of snow and sleet (probably sideways) with high wind in the early afternoon.  Our plan is to summit in late morning, then hightail it over the next 7 miles on the backside to get below tree line before the snow starts.  Mt. Washington is known for its unpredictable and severe weather so we’re not sure what we’ll get.  After that, it’s only two more days to get out of the Whites.  Hiking with Rumbles and No Filter was a great change of pace.  They have a great sense of humor and had me laughing several times while we marched on.","Crawford Notch and North Conway

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638142,"It was a really cold and windy night at the 3800 foot elevation Nauman campsite.  I tossed and turned due to being cold and also nervous about having the right gear for potentially really bad weather on Mt. Washington.  We were going to leave at 7, but the three of us were ready to go at 6:45, so off we went.  It was uphill right out of the gate up Mt. Pierce and then above the tree line.  Fortunately for us, the AT doesn’t go to the summit of the first couple mountains, but we were still climbing up and up.  We then got up above the tree line and the wind was already blowing and the temperature was dropping.  I was getting a bit worried if I had the right gear for Mt. Washington.  Finally, we caught a glimpse of Lakes of the Clouds Hut.  We were hoping it was open so we could at least get out of the cold wind and put on more layers.  Unfortunately, it was locked up - but there was an area in the back that was shielded.  I put on my down puffy jacket and rain jacket over that, and my rain pants over my hiking pants.  My only real concern was if my three layers of gloves/mittens were enough.  Just then, Rumbles offered me to use his heavy weight mittens that looked kind of like snowmobile mittens.  I think I was going to be ok, but I accepted them knowing they’d be better than what I had.  We headed off and soon came to the sign at the base of Mt. Washington that gives warning to turn back now if you’re not prepared.   It claims Mt. Washington has the worst weather in America.  As we started to climb, I notice how overheated I was getting.  Apparently, the wind was dying down and the sky was clearing.  I had to stop multiple times and unlayer.  We couldn’t believe how lucky we were.  The climb was steep, rocky, and high, but overall not nearly as bad as I had feared.  Our luck continued at the summit because the Visitor Center and cafeteria were open.  Since it wasn’t Memorial Day weekend yet, there was no requirement to reserve a time to get in.  We enjoyed lunch and the beautiful clear views from the summit from inside the warm cafeteria.  We didn’t want to leave, but knew that rain was supposed to come in later and we had 9 miles to get to the campsite.  What we didn’t know was that from the moment you leave the summit of Mt. Washington we would be rock scrambling all the way to the tree line for 7 miles.  That included going up and down three mountains.  The last one was Mt. Madison - which was a 500 foot rock climb in less than half mile.  That was bad, but the next mile was sheer misery and took us an hour and a half to get through this section.  Every step of the mile was an accident waiting to happen for us three 60+ year olds.  As we were inching along, Two Tents and Uphill came flying by us.  It was amazing how fast and carefree they were able to navigate compared to us.  We finally got to the tree line and the next 1.4 miles was a serious downhill all the way to the campsite.  I was hurting, but pushed a little harder than I should have to get done.  At the end of day, it was only 14.8 miles and took us almost 12 hours of hiking.  We did spend an hour in the Mt. Washington Visitor Center, so it was really only 11 miles.  It still was the most difficult 15 mile stretch I’ve had to do on this trip.  The good news is I’m done with the Presidents.  I know there are more tough mountains in NH to come, but the end is in sight.","Nauman Tent Site

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638287,"After yesterday’s long day, I slept pretty well.  I don’t think I mentioned that I had to set up my tent on a wooden platform the last two nights.  I had to do it once before in Massachusetts.  I wasn’t prepared that first time because there’s no easy way to attach the tent rain fly.  Usually, they’re just attached to stakes in the ground.  I was lucky because Mark was there tenting as well and he had a ton of stuff he didn’t need (he had 3 lighters and two other ways to start fire and a hatchet too).  He had a spool of string I used to extend my rain fly lines to reach the edge of the platform.  Anyway, after that, I bought some thin cord and cut it in lengths to do the job since I knew Vermont and New Hampshire (maybe Maine too) want you to tent on platforms where available.


It was a short 4.8 miles on a fairly decent trail down to Pinkham Notch and to be picked up by Paul to spend the night at the Barn Hostel.  It was an uncomfortable hike though, due to being cold and damp.  Paul was great and very hospitable.  He hiked the AT in 1974 and told us some really cool stories about his trip.  I honestly don’t think there’s any way I could have done the trail back then.  The hardships and logistics, let alone the type of gear used back then, seem too overwhelming.


On the way to the Notch this morning, the trail crosses the Mt. Washington Auto Road.  When we got there, we came out of the forest and saw this guy with a top hat, bow tie, and apron.  He claims to have walked up from the main highway on stilts (which were there) in celebration of the first day of the season the road was open.  What he was doing was promoting his pizza store.  He interviewed us on his camera and gave us a short history lesson on the road (168 years old).  We thanked him for the info and we got moving again.  


When we got to the hostel, Black Bear was there (he was at the last two campsites with us), as well as Two Tents and Uphill.  The six of us went to dinner and had a great time telling stories and sharing hiker talk.  We’re all starting at the same place tomorrow morning, but the three young guys are lightening their packs and hiking 21.1 tough miles all the way to NH Rt 2 where Paul will pick them up and bring them back to the hostel.  The three of us looked at the terrain and planned on splitting the hike into two days, but would reassess at the shelter after 13 miles.   We will lighten up our packs a little but not too much just in case we had to camp.  The forecast is for heavy rain in the afternoon and low 40s so I’m dreading it already.","Osgood Campsite

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638299,"Paul the hostel owner and his cousin drove the six of us to Pinkham Notch to start our hikes.  From left to right in the photo are Two Tents (WI), Black Bear (ME), Rumbles (GA), No Filter (GA), Mr. Freeze (OH), and Uphill (IA).  The first uphill is another really high, long, and technical 2000 foot climb up to Wildcat D Mountain.  It was cold and damp and to be honest, fairly miserable.  I would sweat with my jacket and pants on, and be cold if I took them off - no win situation.  I tried to stay positive and remind myself that this was the last really really difficult climb of the White Mountains (I used two “really’s” because there are still a few sort-of difficult climbs left).  The three young guns were long gone in no time, but I noticed that Rumbles was getting ahead of No Filter and I and then stopping and waiting for us.  Finally, at one point he asked us if we’d have a problem if he just went ahead and did the entire 21.1 miles today and went back to the hostel.  We agreed he should go for it if he was feeling good and we’d assess our situation later on at the shelter.  No Filter and I traded off going up and down the five peaks (Wildcat Mtn, Carter Dome, Mount Hight, S. Carter Mtn, and N. Carter Mtn) before the shelter.  We were moving at a decent pace, and I was thinking we should just try to do the 21.1 miles in one day to not spend a rainy cold night outside if we didn’t have to.  It started to rain shortly after 2 pm, the temps were dropping, and the sky was starting to look ugly.  We started to push the pace to limit how long we were going to  be drenched.  The last mountain (N. Carter Mtn) to climb was not very steep, but went on what seemed like forever.  By this time it was raining and blowing and we weren’t having very much fun at all. We both slipped and fell multiple times on the wet rock surfaces.  My rain jacket and pants did a decent job, but my rain mits seemed to bleed through.  My biggest fear on the trail is being cold and wet - but I had no choice but to keep moving.


We got to the side trail for the shelter, but No Filter and I agreed to keep hiking and try to make the 21.1.  Finally, the two of us decided we had something left, so we picked up the pace as much as we could to get the last eight miles done before dark.  It was lucky for us that we only had one more mountain to climb before a long (and very steep at the beginning) downhill to Rt. 2.  We were making good time - but mostly because I was so cold and wet that I never stopped to eat, drink, or rest for the entire time.  Finally, after 12 and a quarter hours of hiking (the last 4.5 in a steady cold rain), we got to the trailhead and called Paul for pickup.  No Filter and I were cold, wet, and shivering when Paul arrived, but he’s been doing this a long time and had the car heater on full blast and it felt great.  When we entered the hostel the four others started clapping (in humor) that we finally made it.  It was a long and difficult day - but we have officially completed the White Mountains.  Now - we get to look forward to a day off.  And yes - I’m aware of what I get to tackle on the AT a couple of hiking days from now.","Pinkham Notch

I spent the day doing the usual town stuff - but did take a couple hours to watch a movie with the group.  During the movie, a guy walked into the hostel and said hello to us and asked if one of us is Mr. Freeze.  I was surprised because I wasn’t expecting that.  He introduced himself as Pterodactyl and has been reading my journal.  He hiked the AT in 2016 and is opening a hostel in Lincoln, NH.  It turns out that Black Bear hiked with him for a short time in 2016 - small world again.  Pterodactyl had some funny stories and it was great to meet him.

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638359,"The day off yesterday was great timing.  I needed the rest after the White Mountains and it happened to rain pretty much all day.  The same six hikers who did the 21 mile section yesterday all took a day off at the hostel.  A seventh hiker named Drug Runner came in yesterday too.  He’s a pharmacist from Connecticut and he drove us around town for resupply and breakfast.  I was lucky enough to get some trail magic today because Uphill bought everyone breakfast.  Drug Runner was doing the section we did the day before, but the same six of us all headed out back to the Rt 2 Trail Head for the last part of NH and finally heading into Maine.


It didn’t take long after we started for Uphill, Two Tents, and Black Bear to get way ahead of us.  We likely won’t see Uphill or Two Tents any more because they put in big days and hike really fast.  Black Bear hikes fast too, but does similar miles as us, so we knew we’d see him at the shelter tonight.


We were feeling good after the day off and no Filter led the way at a good pace.  We stopped for lunch in the sun at the summit of an un-named peak and were feeling optimistic that we had 8.4 miles to go and it was only 12:45 pm.  I should have known better.  Similar to some other states, New Hampshire didn’t go quietly.  It required a brutally steep climb up Mt. Success, followed by a steep descent.  Then, as you’re nearing the state line, the AT drops way down to some serious boulder scramble that required us to hand our poles to each other to get down.  Finally, we saw the state line sign.  The three of us stopped for photos and Rumbles and No Filter did some filming for their YouTube channel (Appalachian Trail 2021 Hiking with David and Joe).  The shelter we’re staying at is a half mile into Maine - and boy did Maine welcome us.  We had to do some serious Boulder scrambles and I had to remove my pack and carefully drop down to the next boulder without it so I could keep my balance.  No Filter handed it down to me after I reached the bottom safely.  There was a little more of that before the shelter and I guess that’s a taste of what we’re going to get for 1.1 miles tomorrow at Mahoosuc Notch.  We finally got to the shelter around 6 pm and Black Bear was there, so we had fun telling stories of our final rough day in Maine.  It’s kind of cool, because since he’s from Bangor, Maine, he sort of hiking home.  Tomorrow is the hardest mile or most fun mile on the AT - so we’re pretty excited to see it.  I don’t know if we’ll be cursing through it or laughing, but I’m going to try and just enjoy the experience.","NH Rt 2

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638467,"Black Bear went out ahead this morning and was going to push on past where the three of us old guys were planning on stopping today.  Our plan was simple - today we had to go through the 1.1 mile Mahoosuc Notch and then up the 1800 foot Mahoosuc Arm.  Before that is four other mountains.  I’ve read that it takes 3 to 4 hours to get through the Notch and it’s considered either the hardest or most fun mile on the AT - depending on how you look at it.  Our plan was to stop at a shelter 9.5 miles away.  That’s not many miles, but it will take us most of the day to get there.  Also, there’s no other good place to stop for several miles after the shelter so we’re kind of locked in to 9.5.


It was a great day for hiking.  It was mostly sunny and got into the high 60s.  There was a cool breeze as well - so each time we got to a summit, the breeze felt great.  The climbs and descents were steep and rocky - just like in NH.  Therefore, our pace was slow.  We decided to stop for an early lunch after 4.5 miles at the Full Goose Shelter so we’d be ready for the Notch.   We stayed for about 40 minutes - which is longer than I normally stop, but I enjoy hiking with Rumbles and No Filter so I go with the flow.   When we started hiking after lunch, I felt like I was going to be in trouble.  My legs felt like lead.  I got up and over the mountain but it was tough.  It was steep going down with lots of hanging on to trees and lowering ourselves.  The good part was that it was very slow going and my legs didn’t have to work very hard.  Finally, we saw the start of the Mahoosuc Notch.  There was still snow on the ground in several places.  No Filter and Rumbles asked if I wanted to lead, so away we went.  By the way, I wasn’t dreading this mile - nor was I looking forward to it.  It’s just part of the AT lore and we allotted a lot of time today to get through it.  At first, it was just navigating up and around really large rock slabs and boulders.  It took some climbing in places, and lots of strategic foot placement.  There was snow and ice in several places, but it didn’t impact our traverse.  We got through the first half mile in an hour, but I knew from Youtube that the hard part is still coming.  The second half requires multiple places in which you have to squeeze through small openings way down below boulders the size of a house.  We had to put away our poles and remove our packs and hand them through to each other like a bucket brigade.  It was actually kind of fun and not really hard at all - just challenging.  As a matter of fact, when we got through (in two hours) and were facing the huge climb up Mahoosuc Arm, I was feeling refreshed.  I kept the lead going up, but it was kind of slow.  We were all worn out though, so even though No Filter and Rumbles are better climbers than me, they were happy for me to go first and set a slow pace to end the day.  The view of Maine at the top of the arm was spectacular.  As a matter of fact, we had great views all day today.  We all agreed that the Mahoosuc Notch is a bit over rated.  It’s hard for sure, but climbing the Arm, or any of the other two dozen steep high rocky cliffs we’ve done in the last two weeks, are much harder.  The Notch is physically and mentally demanding, but it was a nice change of pace.","Carlo Col Shelter

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638469,"We all agreed to try to be hiking by 5 am to ensure we had enough time to hike 20.9 miles.  We knew the trail was tough early on, but didn’t know what the second half was like.  Every time we assume something about the trail, it turns out to be something else.  We tried, but three 60 + year olds just couldn’t get it done by 5 am.  We did get on the trail at 5:20 am, so that’s not too bad.  The first uphill was tough - just as we expected.  Steep up and steep down.  No surprise there.  Then we hit a highlight for the day.  We are now on the last map on the Guthooks App.  Another highlight for us was finding a trash can at the Grafton Notch trail head.  It’s really nice to not have to carry around my garbage for the next day and a half.  The little things out here are big to us.
We decided to eat lunch at a shelter 10 miles down trail.  But first we had to get up and over the Baldpate East and West peaks.  I decided that I’m going to hike my own hike today and go at my normal pace.  I am a slow and steady climber, and No Filter and Rumbles are fast going uphill.  They also take more and longer breaks than I normally do.  I’m pretty good on the downhills and is where I can make up time.  Since they’re letting me hike with them, I need to adjust to their pace and do not want them slowing down or waiting for me on the uphills.  The Baldpate west peak was a new experience for me.  It required climbing up angles rough rocky ledges and following cairns to find your way.  It made me think of Mars (obviously no scrubby trees on Mars), but I have no idea why.
Since we had 10.5 miles to go and it was 12:30 pm, I went on ahead while they finished lunch.  It was a tough climb right after lunch, but then, for the first time since the very beginning of NH, the AT was actually a trail.  I was able to make really good time and was done for the day by 5:20 pm.  The final six miles was uphill, but gradual - and only a few small steep rock climbs.  The shelter was one of the less desirable ones I’ve stayed at (old, no water, no Bear box, privy far away, buggy, and it’s the kind with a gap in the floor you have to crawl over.  It did the trick, however, as it rained while we were making dinner and for much of the night.  Tomorrow is a short day into Andover, ME for resupply and we’re staying in a hostel.
I have about 250 miles to go and less than 3 weeks (hopefully) and I’ll be able to go home.  I’m looking forward to seeing my wife and family - and for the first time - starting to count down the miles.  I think I just might finish this thing (with the help from my new friends).  We’re hoping Not-So-Much catches us so all four of us 60+ year olds can summit together.  He had to get off trail a few weeks ago for funeral services, but he’s a fast hiker and we expect to have him surprise us one day in the woods.","Speck Pond Shelter

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638486,"It rained a lot last night, so the push to the shelter turned out to be a good decision.  The downside (which does not even come close to staying dry and not having a wet tent), was that we were being attacked by mosquitoes and flies all evening.  Even in the early hours of the night, I kept hearing that annoying high pitched mosquito buzz by my ears.  Finally, either I killed it or the temperature dropped enough (or it got its fill of my blood) to where I didn’t hear it anymore.  We packed up this morning with an intermittent rain, high humidity, and a drenched forest.  So even though it was a nice 60 degrees when we started hiking, we all had our rain pants and backpack covers on.  We doused up on Deet so we could go with short sleeves to slightly offset the sweating we were about to do on the big climb this morning.  Because we did 20.9 miles yesterday, today was just 4.1 to South Arm Road where we would be picked up by Pine Ellis shuttle driver David.  He is a funny guy with a subtle sense of humor and made the 15 minute drive fun.  The one climb today was tough but fair, and overall, the trail was actually a trail again today.  Actually, It was nice yesterday afternoon and this morning and felt good to actually be “hiking” the AT instead of rock climbing and controlled falls down a cliff.  I know we have (including tomorrow) some tough mountains coming in Maine, but hopefully the NH and southern Maine stuff is mostly behind us.The highlight of the day (and I’m being serious) was a privy we saw just off the trail at the end of the day 0.1 miles from South Arm Road.  It looked and smelled (the wood) brand new, was painted, and it was huge.  Don’t ask me why, but it had a long ramp leading up to the deck - yes a deck.  LOL - I guess I’ve been on the trail too long.","Hall Mountain Lean-to

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638736,"There are a couple of things I didn’t mention in yesterday’s post.  One of them is because I forgot, and the other was because I didn’t know what to write - or if I should mention it at all in my journal.  The first was that Black Bear was at the hostel yesterday when we got there.  He joined us for dinner last night and for breakfast this morning.  I decided to mention the other item briefly today because it is definitely part of my journey and has impacted my hike.  I found out yesterday morning that my mother-in-law passed away on Wednesday.  Since I didn’t have cell service since then, I didn’t get the message from my wife until two days later.  I wasn’t there for my wife and I feel terrible.  I started to try to find a quick way home, but was unsuccessful.  Her passing wasn’t surprising, but the speed and timing that it happened was.  My wife is fine and a very strong person.  She insists I stay and finish the trail since there won’t be any kind of service for my mother-in-law before I finish.  She and her siblings, and all three of my kids, flew out to AZ to be with my father-in-law.  All I’m going to say about today’s hike was that I opted to hike alone for the day and reflect.  I thought about my mother-in-law and what a loving and caring women she was.  She always treated me like one of her own sons.  Also, I thought about how committed my father-in-law was to her as a care-giver for three years or so.  The sacrifices he made were tremendous.  I also thought about my Dad a lot and how much I miss him.  He passed about 5 years ago.  I also thought about my sister who lost a battle with cancer.  It was a difficult day, but i was able to put things in perspective.  My mother-in-law would send me texts of encouragement and would follow along in my trip via my journal.  I will be thinking of her going forward for sure - and it will make the summit of Mt.

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638751,"Black Bear made the difficult decision last night to get off the trail.  His knee was hurting so bad that he could barely walk to get water.  No Filter, Rumbles, and I divided up some of his stuff to lighten up his pack.  We had to hike 9 miles to the road where his parents will pick him up to take some time off.  He was beating himself up the entire morning for carrying too much weight and trying to do too many miles.  We got him to the trail head and ate lunch while he waited.  Because of the circumstances, the three of us decided to keep the day short and stop at the next shelter for an 11 mile day.  To continue meant climbing a 4000 foot peak in the heat of the afternoon and doing another 6 miles to get to a campsite.  We arrived at the Piazza Rock Lean-to around 1 pm and just hung out for the afternoon.  Around dinner time, a couple came to the shelter for the night.  We moved our stuff to fit them in.  As it turns out the women is writing a fictional novel inspired by Gerry Largay who got lost on the AT in Maine a few years ago and died.  She was doing research for her book and also interviewed us for insight on the AT and thru-hikers.  She’s published four novels already, and I’m really looking forward to reading her books when I get done.


I also forgot to mention that I ran into section hiker Neb again yesterday.  I camped next to him at a state park back in NY where he was doing a 70 mile section.  He’s flipped up to Maine where he plans to hike to Mt. Katahdin to complete his hike of the entire AT.  I was coming around the bend on the trail and saw him resting and I know I had met him before, but couldn’t place him.  He remembered  me and reminded me of his name and where we met.  It was cool to see him, but he’s just getting back on the trail and can’t do the miles we’re doing so unfortunately he can’t join our over 60 tramily (he’s 61).  It’s  going to be miserable in the shelter tonight with 5 people, warm temperatures, and millions of biting and stinging insects hovering around.  That means sleeping with hats and bug nets and roasting inside our sleeping bags.  Hiking the AT is fun, hiking the AT is fun, hiking the AT is fun.","Sabbath Day Pond Lean-to

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638753,"Author Amity Gaige (buy her books) reluctantly gave me permission to use her name in my journal because I wanted to write about meeting her.  She is very humble about what she does and didn’t want to make a big deal about it (buy her books).  I told her I don’t include personal information in my journal, but I’d really like to list her here since she’s writing a novel based on a women hiking the AT.  She and her husband Tim are trying to get first hand experience for her novel so they slept in the shelter with us.  I’m sure she didn’t have a restful night with three thru-hikers doing what thru-hikers do at night.  Also, we were getting up at 4:30 am to start hiking by 6 and she wanted to go with us for a short while.  To her credit, she was up and ready to go when we were (buy her books).  Tim was a really cool guy and we both coached HS sports so we had something we could relate to.  It was a big climb out of the gate and she asked me questions about hiking for about a half mile.  It was really tough going, but she hung in there pretty well.  Finally it was time for her to turn around and head back to her husband Tim back at the shelter (buy her books).  Our first climb up Saddleback Mountain didn’t seem too bad - and there was a great view in every direction since the summit is above the tree line.  The Horn and Saddleback Junior came right away in succession and those also gave us great vistas.  Then - we had a throw-back moment to NH.  The way down Saddleback Junior was steep and we were back to controlled falling.  We all still felt ok and stopped for an early lunch at the Poplar Ridge Lean-to.  The plan was to do 16.9 miles, but we thought we might try to go another 6 miles to a campsite if we felt good.  After lunch, the next 3 miles were favorable terrain and Rumbles led us with a respectable (for us) 2.4 mph pace.  Towards the end of that stretch, we were all drenched with sweat as the afternoon temperature had risen into the mid 80s.  The Lean-to was still a few miles away and I was having my doubts that I could do another 6 in the heat.  Especially since the next 3 miles were uphill and the last mile was very steep.  Rumbles and No Filter stopped at a stream to wash off a bit and get water.  I decided that since I’m the slowest one going uphill, that I’d just get water and go on ahead.  I went very slowly to conserve energy and drank at least 3 liters of water in the 3 miles up Lone Mountain.  Luckily there were 3 or 4 streams on the way up.  Even then, I couldn’t drink enough to keep up with my sweating.  Surprisingly, they never did catch me, so I just sat down on a rock at the summit and waited for them.  About 10 minutes later, they arrived looking and feeling just like me.  We were gassed and decided to just hike the last 2.2 miles to the lean-to as originally planned.  We checked the weather and it isn’t supposed to rain tonight so we’re all setting up tents so we can escape the little biting gnats (Black Bear calls them little ninjas because you can’t hear or feel them land on you until they bite) and mosquitoes.  Last night was horrible in the shelter.  We were all roasting in our sleeping bags and slept with a hat and bug net on.  Tonight I plan to set up my tent without the rain fly and will sleep in shorts and t-shirt since it’s only supposed to get down to 66.  We have a tough 13 miles tomorrow and we’re going to try to start hiking by 5 am to catch the 1 pm shuttle to the hostel.  Otherwise, we have to wait until the 4 pm shuttle and that leaves little time to do the town necessities.  Tomorrow I’ll reach the 2000 mile mark and the under 200 miles to go point.  I’m exhausted every day and am ready to be done and go home.  I think I can do this for 2 more weeks with the help of my new friends, but it’s getting really difficult to get motivated each morning.  
Just before dark, two young hikers came towards the shelter.   it was Link (Wash State) and Smiles (Mich) who are NOBO thru-hikers who started on February 25.  They really fly down the trail compared to us.

The highlights of the day were getting to the 1993.1 (200 miles to go) point - followed shortly afterwards arriving at the 2000 mile mark.  There weren’t any signs or markers, but we gave out a couple of big deal yelps, and that’s about it.  Slowly but surely.","Spaulding Mountain Lean-to

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639126,"We stayed at the Hostel of Maine last night just outside of Carrabassett Valley.   It’s the nicest hostel I’ve stayed at.  It was like staying at a lodge.   Everything was new and first class.  Actually, it was so new and clean that they made us sit on the porch while waiting our turn to shower.  The problem, in my opinion, was that they were too restrictive.  Rumbles, No Filter and I all agreed.  It was the nicest hostel on the AT, but certainly not our favorite.  We met Captain Jack at the hostel.  He’s from New Orleans and has pitch black long hair and a dark complexion and facial hair just like Captain Jack Sparrow.  He plays the part too and has bead earrings.  He’s trying to finish the AT from a previous attempt (I think last year) when he got injured.
The AT section for today didn’t look overly difficult on the Guthooks App, but we did have several climbs to do.  The Bigelows were our last 4000 foot peaks before Mt. Katahdin.  There are multiple peaks over 3000 feet however, and one is 3600 feet.  While slowly making my way up to the Bigelow West Peak, I made a sharp upward right turn on a switchback.  My head was down, ball cap on, and I was leaning into the mountain to make my center of gravity as low as possible.  Suddenly, I banged the top of my head into a downed pine tree that was across the trail.  I didn’t see it because the bill of my cap shielded it from my view.  I’ve run my head into numerous downed trees on this trip already, but this time a broken limb was jetting out and I nearly impaled my skull on it.  Luckily it just caused light bleeding and I continued to climb after some choice words.
It was a clear day again and we were blessed with outstanding views in all directions.  The afternoon required another mediocre climb and a long section that just annoyingly went up and down for about a mile before dropping back down to the shelter.  We were whipped and so glad to get there to set up our tents and have dinner.  It seems like I say the same thing every day, but today was a very tough 15 miles.  Hopefully, Maine will start to get a little easier.  Tomorrow looks fairly flat on paper, but you can’t tell if it’s boulder hopping or through a muddy bog.  We’ll find out!","Maine Rt 27

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639139,"No Filter, Rumbles, and I have been camping outside shelters the last three nights, and the setting just keeps getting better.  The first night was in a pine forest setting just 30 yards from a stream with waterfalls and pools called The Tubs.    The second night we were next to a pond with a great sunset and sunrise view (after going around a few trees).  Our tents last night were just a few yards from the edge of the pond.  We could hear the small waves lapping against the rocks while we went to sleep.  We got up at 3:30 am to get an early start (5 am) on the 17.9 miles to get to Maine Rt 15 where we would get a ride to Shaw’s hostel in Monson.  The terrain was forgiving again with two relatively easy uphills (compared to what we’ve been experiencing).  We did have to ford two small rivers though.  Other than several blow downs, there was nothing to slow us down.  Many hikers (us included) get what we call town legs on the last day of a section.  I led first - most likely because I’m the slowest hiker and usually conserve my energy for the second half of the day.  We didn’t go slow by any means though and were around 2.5 mph for the first 6 or 7 miles.  No Filter took over after that and kept up a similar speed.  We decided to stop at a lean-to around 9:30 am and eat an early lunch.  It was a quick lunch for us, and we hit it again after 25 to 30 minutes.  No Filter continued the good pace for a couple of miles and we were making great time.  After a quick snack and water fill-up, we moved aside and let Rumbles (our speedster) take over for the final 7 miles or so.  Man did he ever take off.  I was second for this leg and it was everything I could do to keep up with him.  He’s 6’-3” and has a long and effortless stride and I just focused on his feet and latched on.  I had to jog a few times to close the gap to not let him get away.  No Filter was right on my heels too - so the three of us flew (for us) at better than 3 mph over the final 10 km.  That included a 1.5 uphill (not steep though).  We did stop briefly a few times to talk to a couple of small groups of SOBOs.  I asked the first 3 or 4 what their trail names were, start dates, and where they’re from for my journal.  They happily gave their information but I noticed that none of them were interested in knowing who we were.  So I decided to not ask anymore unless a SOBO wanted to meet us.  I’m not saying there’s anything wrong with that, but it’s so different from when I started back in GA.  Everyone back then was interested in everyone else’s story.  Of course, most of the hikers in February were older and very few of us were out there.  In the north, most hikers are going south and the vast majority are in their 20s.  Maybe it’s due to generational differences.
We got picked up at the road by Poet who owns Shaw’s.  He’s a great guy who’s done the trail with his wife Hippie Chick.  They bought Shaw’s a few years ago and are doing everything they can to make their hostel the most hiker-oriented hostel on the trail.  From everything I’ve seen since getting here, this is far and away the best hostel I’ve stayed at on the AT.  I’m looking forward to resting tomorrow and taking my time to resupply.  The hostel has an amazing resupply store and also an outfitter shop.  I’ve broken the tips on both of my trekking poles and will be getting those replaced tomorrow.  I’ve been having several minor gear issues lately and am hoping to limp to the finish with what I have.  115 miles to go!!!","Bald Mountain Pond Lean-to

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639161,"Since we zeroed today and I didn’t take any photos, I thought I’d include the one Rumbles sent me of Captain Jack, me, and Canoe shuttler Matt crossing the Kennebec River a few days ago. You can see for yourself how Captain Jack got his trail name.


Today was a relaxing day off prior to our final leg to Mt.Katahdin.  I was able to get new tips installed on my trekking poles and get 6 days worth of food for the 100 mile wilderness.  Shaw’s offers a resupply service in which they can meet you half way through the wilderness on a logging road so you don’t have to carry all that weight with you in the first half - which is the more difficult section.  We stopped at the AT visitor center yesterday afternoon in Monson and received some excellent information from the guide. We also got our official thru-hiker badges that the ATC decided (finally) to give out.  They still won’t recognize us in the 2000 mile club since we started our trips prior to May 1.  
There are at least a dozen hikers (almost all SOBOs) here and they’re mostly really young.  It was interesting to hear the discussions they had about the trail and what they think the White Mountains will be like.
Rumbles and No Filter were able to make plans to get back to Atlanta where they’ll take a few weeks off (Rumbles’ son is getting married) before resuming their flip flop hike southbound starting near Marion, VA.  I, on the other hand, haven’t decided what I’m going to do, if I’m going directly back to Pearisburg, VA to get the 15 mile section done that was closed, or how I’m going to get there.  One-way flights from Bangor to Roanoke are more than $500 - so that’s an unlikely option.  I’m also looking at bus routes, trains, and rental cars, and even flying out of Boston, but none are easy or inexpensive.  To be determined.We had a nice surprise from Uphill.  He summited today and came back to Shaw’s before going home.  He’s a beast.","Shaw’s Hostel

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639356,"Poet dropped off the three of us (Rumbles, No Filter, me) and Doppler (FL SOBO) off at Maine Rt 15 for entrance into the 100 Mile Wilderness.  Doppler is a teacher in Florida who used to work refueling outages at some nuclear power plants (Arkansas Nuclear One and Oconee) as a Health Physics decon tech.  I enjoyed talking shop with her at breakfast earlier in the morning.  We went north and she went south.
The trail was fairly easy on paper for 15 miles and we weren’t sure if we’d stop at the shelter there or not.  If we felt good, we would go another four miles up and over Barren Mountain.  That required a 2000 foot climb at the end of the day.  Since it was the first day after a zero, we decided to just do it.  The first part of the mountain was really steep and reminiscent of southern Maine.  The problem with pushing to the next shelter was that it’s 0.4 miles off the AT.  When we got to the shelter, a hammock and two tents were already set up and two other hikers were in the shelter.  Since it’s supposed to rain tonight, we quickly claimed three of the shelter spots.  Within an hour, 6 more hikers showed up.  We ended up with 7 people in the shelter.  The others were scrambling to find stealth spots around the shelter but I’m not sure where they ended up.  I never thought I’d run into an overcrowding problem, but some of the faster NOBOs have been catching me and we met numerous SOBOs too.  I think  I’m going to have to deal with the SOBO bubble for the rest of the trip.  I have a feeling I’m not going to sleep well tonight. I forgot to mention yesterday that we had a surprise visit from Uphill at Shaw’s Hostel.  He zipped through the 100 Mile Wilderness in 3 days and summited Mt. Katahdin already.  He came back to Monson to relax for a day before flying back to Iowa.  By the way, when he heard me and Doppler talking, he mentioned at breakfast this morning that he lives close to the Duane Arnold nuclear plant.  He’s 48 years old and flies down the trail and goes up steep mountains like nothing.  We took him to dinner and asked him a bunch of questions.  He’s a great guy and I’m glad I got to meet him.","Shaw’s Hostel

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639357,"I didn’t sleep well last night due to 7 people in the shelter and rain dropping on the tin roof.  We did luck out though because it stopped raining shortly before we started hiking.  On the other hand, everything was dripping wet so we had to wear our rain gear.  It didn’t take long before we hit an uphill and were sweating like crazy.  It was overcast and stayed wet all day.
The first half of the day was over the Chairback Mountains - and it was really slow going with lots of rocky ups and downs and hundreds of wet slippery roots.  I found out that my Altra 5.0 shoes are horrible on wet surfaces.  I stopped counting my falls today after 10.  I fell more today than the rest of the AT put together.  On one of the falls, I fell forward and ripped the left knee of my rain pants.  On another, my feet slid from under me and I landed hard on my right butt cheek and felt a pain in my hip.  I’m pretty sure I bruised my tail bone.  I also pulled my right calf muscle on another.  The abundance of rocks and roots on the AT today were extremely slippery and I couldn’t place my feet down with any confidence all day long.  Rumbles and No Filter didn’t fair as badly as I did, but they were slowed as well.  The last fall of the day came shortly before the shelter.  I ended up ripping the left cuff of my rain pants. Between the knee and cuff, they’re in bad shape on the left side.  I just hope there’s not a lot of rain between now and Sunday.  I was so glad to see the shelter at the end of the day and to get out of my wet clothes and shoes.  The AT is not going to let me go out quietly.
The highlight of the day was going over the 2100 mile mark.  While getting set up in the shelter, Ace (VT) and Happy Feet (PA) showed up.  Happy Feet did a SOBO last year and is hiking southbound with Ace for a while (not all the way though) to help her out.  They both were nice and had a great sense of humor.  She’s a ski instructor and told us how she’s one of those crazy people who hike up Mt. Washington carrying skis and ski down on the back side.  She’s small in stature, but as tough of a kid as I’ve met on the trail.  After a while in the trail, you ca usually (but not always) tell who’s going to make it.  I think she’s a good bet.","Cloud Pond Lean-to

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639358,"Funny thing.  I get 1 bar up the hill from the shelter tonight next to the privy, but no bars anywhere else.  Not enough to download photos for the last three days however.


It rained pretty hard last night so everything we hung up in the shelter to dry out was damp from the humid air.  My shoes and insoles were still drenched so I decided to put my damp Darn Tough socks back on instead of getting a second pair of socks wet.  It paid off because we walked through some wet grass in the first few miles and my feet were soaked anyways.  A positive thing about last night was that the wind really picked up around 3 or 4 am and the boulders on the trail weren’t as wet as yesterday.
We had 4 mountains to climb right away, and then a 500 footer late in the day.  An option we entertained was to put in a 27 mile day to get to the Antlers campground.  Everyone raves about how beautiful it is.  The problem was that it’s 27 miles away.  Anyway, the first 4 mountains weren’t that bad and there were steps made out of boulders in several places.  The fourth peak was Whitecap Mountain and that’s where we were to call Hippie Chick back at Shaw’s to let her know what time we’ll be at the logging road for our three days of food.  It’s the only place (so far) in the 100 Mile Wilderness (other than on one of the peaks yesterday for a brief moment) that I had cell service.  We conservatively told them 2:30 pm.  There were more stone steps in the steepest downhill and the rest of the descent was pretty tame - so we made decent time.  Then the trail was flat for awhile - yes flat.  We couldn’t believe how effortless it felt to hike.  The only thing slowing us down was the conga line of southbounders we passed.  I didn’t count, but there were at least 15 to 20 SOBOs today.  Mike from Shaw’s was right in time and he brought us our food plus a couple PBRs as trail magic from Shaw’s.  That’s all it took for us to decide to just stop at the Cooper Brook Falls Lean-to as we originally planned.  It was 3.9 miles of flatness - and I loved every step of it.  I slowed down (more than I normally am) and Rumbles and No Filter were soon out of eyesight and earshot.  I put on my ITunes and cruised into the shelter.  Less than 60 miles to go!  Im looking forward to seeing Mt. Katahdin for the first time tomorrow.  They say you can see it from Whitecap Mountain, but we only saw gray soup.   The shelters in Maine are all pretty old and nothing special.  However, the placement of the shelters (“Lean-to” in Maine) is better than any other state in my opinion.  They’re usually near a pond, lake, or stream and have a great view.  Tonight’s Lean-to scenery was fantastic.  We were right on the stream with Cooper Falls just to our right.  We went to sleep with the sound of the cascading falls.","Cal Newhall Lean-to

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639623,"Our plan was to hike 21.5 miles today, but Rumbles dropped a few hints yesterday about possibly going for 29 if the terrain was easy, if we felt good, and if the weather was favorable.  I decided I was going to prepare to hike 29 if Rumbles and No Filter were.  For me, that means pacing myself to be able to finish comfortably later in the day.  That also means I don’t try and keep up with them in the morning.  They hike a lot faster than me, but we offset each other because I take very few breaks and eat quick lunches so my legs don’t tie up.  They took off early and I watched them pull away.  That’s fine because the trail was very flat and easy and I was able to keep a decent pace of 3 mph but remain comfortable.  At one point, I was going up a little hill and noticed some movement far off in the forest to the right.  At first I thought it was a logging truck - but there was no sound.  As I kept walking, I could make out the heads and backs of two moose high stepping out of a pond and into the trees.  It wasn’t a good view, but finally I saw a moose!  A little bit later, I caught up to Rumbles and No Filter taking a break and they saw them too.
 All good things come to an end, and that goes for a flat section of AT.  Soon, the trail started to be more up and down, rooty, rocky, and in bogs.  I was still able to average 2.5 mph though, so I was in good shape for the slower part of trail that comes in the afternoon.  I read in the Guthooks App that there’s a short side trail to a pond at the 12 mile mark for today and you get your first view of Mt. Katahdin.  It was spectacular!  It’s nearly 6000 feet tall and there aren’t many other mountains around it - so it really stand out.
Right before reaching the shelter i was going to stop at for lunch, the trail ran along side a beautiful river in a pine forest.  I was hoping the lunch shelter was on the river, but it wasn’t.  Rumbles and No Filter were already there when I arrived, so I joined them for lunch.  We were all going to try to do the 29 miles to the Rainbow Stream Lean-to so we would have a shorter day tomorrow to get out of the 100 mile wilderness and to the Abol Bridge store in the early afternoon.  I ate lunch in 20 minutes and wanted to get moving.  If I take too much time, my legs tie up and it’s really difficult to get going again.  Surprisingly, I felt pretty good and was able to keep a decent pace.  The afternoon did have one really good view of Mt. Katahdin after climbing Nesuntabunt Mountain.  I spent around 10 minutes up there resting for the final push to the lean-to for the night.  The trail ran along multiple lakes, ponds, and fast flowing streams with waterfalls.  The Maine scenery has not disappointed us.  However, since the terrain was pretty difficult in the afternoon, I couldn’t afford to look around while hiking.   I arrived at the lean-to and met several SOBOs while eating dinner.  It was fun answering their questions about the AT.  I set up my tent for the night and now don’t have to worry about bugs while sleeping.  Hopefully I’ll get some rest.
Today was the most miles completed in a day (two previous 27 mile days) on my journey, but not the most time hiking.  Due to 15 easy miles (first part), I was done in less than 12 hours.  We’re eager to get a good weather forecast for the weekend so we can decide the best day to summit.  It’s looking like early Sunday right now, but you never know.","Cooper Brook Falls Lean-to

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639628,"The name “100 Mile Wilderness” sounds much more intriguing than it actually is.  We didn’t cross any kind of road in southern Maine until the third day (if my memory serves me), and yet there are multiple dirt roads in the 100 mile wilderness.  Maybe it’s called that because there might not be any homes, cottages, or cabins.  Anyways, us over-60 guys got through it in 4.5 days - and that includes getting through the Chairback Mountains after an all night rain. The trail today wasn’t as easy as part of yesterday, but there was only one minor climb.  We were somewhat slowed by roots and boulders though.  Our plan for today was to finish the wilderness, get to the Abol Bridge Campground and get an updated weather report for Mt. Katahdin.  If the weather tomorrow was going to be good, and not on Sunday, we were considering hiking another ten miles this afternoon to Baxter State Park and summiting tomorrow.  Also - we really wanted to get some food (and ice cream) at the camp store.  We finally left the woods for a short 0.3 mile road walk to the campground.  On the way, we crossed over the Penebscot River on Abol Bridge and off to our left there she stood.  It was our first close up look of Mt. Katahdin.  It was magnificent and towers above everything else in the area.  We took photos and Rumbles and No Filter did a YouTube video piece before moving on.  There was no cell service at the store, but the owner pulled up the forecast.  It called for rain on Saturday, then a no rain window on Sunday morning.  That settled it, we’re going to stay here for the night.  Staying here meant getting a shower and washing our clothes.  More importantly, we could get deli sandwiches, beer, soda, and junk food (and ice cream).  We decided to get a cabin because that meant sleeping in a bunk and getting a buffet breakfast in the morning - a no-brainer.  Then the Mr. Freeze bad luck started to kick in.  The campground had a washing machine, but no soap.  We improvised and just rinsed the things we needed in the sink and hung them up on a clothesline we made from my bear bag cord.  Since it was early afternoon and a sunny light breezy day, everything dried nicely before dinner.  We were lounging around the cabin when Rumbles noticed Big Spoon and Duke of the Trail walk by.  They’re two young guys we met back at Shaw’s and had seen a couple times in the wilderness.  They did big miles for most of the AT but decided in NH to slow down and have fun at the end.  We all hung out at our picnic table and had lots of trail talk.  Nobody cares what they eat or how much at this point in the hike and we made multiple trips to the camp store for junk food, soda, beer, and ice cream.  This was mid afternoon mind you and had ordered sub sandwiches for dinner from the store to be ready at 5:45 pm before they close.   So at 5:45 sharp, we headed back to the store to pick up our subs and more junk food.  The campground was fairly empty, so we sat at a campsite picnic table on the river with a great view of Mt. Katahdin.  Before we knew it, it was time for bed and we headed back to our cabins.  Tomorrow is an easy 10 miles to Baxter State Park where we’ll stay at the Birches campsite reserved for NOBOs only.  It is supposed to rain though, so that could put a damper on our last day in the forest.","Rainbow Stream Lean-to

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639683,"We spent a little extra money at Abol Bridge Campground on a cabin for two reasons.  First, it was supposed to rain last night, and second, we’re three retired 60 + year olds on the last day before summiting Mt. Katahdin.  In other words - we could afford it.  Actually, it wasn’t that expensive for three bunks, plus it included an all you can eat breakfast.  It rained during the early morning hours and then really poured at 7:30 am when we were heading to breakfast.  It was only 9.7 miles to The Birches Campsite today which is only available to NOBO thru-hikers or those who hiked through the 100 Mile Wilderness.  The last thing we wanted to do was hike in the rain this morning and then sit around in a shelter all day (since we would get there early).  We did luck out however because it stopped raining around 9 am when we started to head onto the trail.
Shortly after leaving the campground, we entered Baxter State Park and completed two registration forms.  The trail was flat and easy for a mile or so before coming to the Penobscot River.  It went along the river for awhile - which was fairly buggy.  The humidity was sky high and soon I had to strip down to a shirt and shorts.  No matter what I tried, I couldn’t stop sweating.  The sun started to pop out and the rain clouds seemed to be moving off.  The trail wound around ponds and was a little rocky and rooty, so we just hiked at a comfortable pace to rest our legs for the big elevation gain and descent tomorrow.  We finally arrived at the Ranger Station at the Baxter State Park Katahdin Stream CG around 1 pm.  The sign said they’re open an hour in the morning and for one our in late afternoon.  We were going to go set up our stuff at The Birches (quarter mile away) and then come back at 4 to register our hike when we noticed a Ranger behind the office building by a garage.  He said a different ranger is supposed to do the registration but he would take care of us.  I filled out all the forms and I was surprised to find that I was just the 9th GA-starter NOBO thru-hiker on the 2021 summiting list to summit this year.  Not bad for a 60 year old.  It’s not totally accurate however, because I know of at least three hikers who summited already but didn’t register.  It still felt good to crack the top ten (on paper) though.


We hiked down to the campsite and all three of us set up our sleeping pads and bags in one of the mini (4-person) Lean-tos with the notion it was going to rain.  Big Spoon and Duke of the Trail took a non-AT shorter trail to the campsite and already were set up in the other lean-to.  The five of us ate a late lunch and just sat around the picnic table for awhile talking about multiple subjects and having a good time.  Around 4:30 pm, we were thinking about eating an early dinner when a guy showed up.  He wasn’t a thru-hiker, he was someone better.  He (Dana)  was a Trail Angel.   He brought a huge cooler of cold drinks, two large NY style pizzas, and a wide variety of chips and cookies.  What a treat - trail magic on our last night.  Dana lives 200 miles away and has been helping hikers for several years now.  
At 5:30, a young man just out of HS showed up to camp and said there were three more coming behind him.  We were going to have a full house tonight at the Birches.
We all ate and drank too much and soon it was time for an early bedtime.  We helped clean up and take the cooler and leftover treats back to Dana’s truck - and he even took our trash.  Getting rid of trash on the AT is a huge deal to thru-hikers.  We thanked him profusely and headed off to make room in the lean-tos for everyone.  One of the young guys, ID, decided to tent, but the rest of us 8 were shoulder to shoulder in the two lean-tos.  After about 30 minutes of trying to sleep with my bug net on and in my sleeping bag to fend off the mosquitoes, I couldn’t take it anymore.  If I was going to get any sleep the night before summiting, I had to get out of there.  I was so hot that I was sweating in my bag.  So I set up my tent.  It was instantly better.  No bugs and I could sleep without the bag to stay cool.  It never rained and I got a decent nights sleep.  I decided to treat climbing Mt. Katahdin like traversing through Mahoosuc Notch.  I was going to take my time and enjoy it.  That mindset should help me sleep without fretting about it all night.  Tomorrow my journey will be coming to an end after 4 months and 20 days.","Abol Bridge Camground

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639717,"Last night, Big Spoon and Duke of the Trail tried to talk us old guys into leaving with them at 2:30 am to see the sun rise at the summit.  We kindly declined for multiple reasons.  The most critical one was that the rock climbing to get to The Gateway is technical and dangerous enough in daylight.  Our plan was to hike out of The Birches Campsite at 4:30 am.   The guys in the other lean-to (including Big Spoon and Duke) were up talking past 10 pm, so we didn’t think they would follow through with their 2:30 am plan - and none of us heard them this morning.
I admit to being a bit nervous about the steep and long climb today, but I wasn’t dwelling on it.  The entire 5 point something miles to the summit is uphill and Rumbles set a fairly quick first mile.  I stayed close, but didn’t try to keep up with his long effortless stride.  After the first mile, the grade started to get steeper and rockier.  In some places, a stream flowed down the trail.  Up we went and it kept getting steeper and steeper.  We were then in a stretch of thick shorter spruce trees as we approached the tree line.  Every now and then we would get a view of the valley and lakes below.  The morning sun was shining in a partly cloudy sky but I didn’t stop too often to take photos.  The view from the summit would be even better.  Rumbles continued to lead with NoFilter on his tail.  Soon we were above tree line and were having to make our way around and over monstrous boulders.  In several places we had to grab on to hand holds and/or use embedded rebar to pull ourselves up to the next rock.  At this point, the wind started to really pick up.  I’d have to guess it was 25 to 30 mph at this point.  As we kept climbing, the maneuvering was getting more difficult and dangerous.   When pulling myself up to one ledge, the water bottle in my daypack pouch got squeezed out and fell down into a deep crevice.  I couldn’t even see where it fell let alone try to get down there to retrieve it.  The clouds were now rolling in and the temperature was dropping.  We worked our way to a small plateau.  We all looked up to see what was next and we saw a massive steep rocky wall with periodic white blazes going all the way to a pointy top.  We just looked at each other and kind of felt like what choice do we have but to just go do it.  We also thought that once we get to the top of this climb, we’d be at the Gateway which would be (we thought) an easy walk to the summit on the Table Land.  The wind kept getting stronger and temperature dropping as we climbed.  I am not ashamed to say I had some serious nervousness (fear) going on.
I thought how smart it was to use the Ranger Station day packs rather than our full large packs with a big surface area.  We were being blown around as it was and I can’t imagine trying to climb and hold on to the rocks while being blown sideways.  Rumbles is tall and sometimes chooses a climbing path that’s easy for him, but was out of reach for NoFilter and myself.  Many times I would drop back a bit because I would climb up a different way than Rumbles.  We finally got to the top and the grade became a lot easier and we had to walk in a path of rocks similar to the worst parts of Pennsylvania.  There were thin ropes on each side of the path to ensure hikers didn’t walk on the delicate plant-life that grows on the Table Land.  At this point, my two friends pulled ahead of me by 50 yards or so and I could barely see them.  The wind was whipping and we were walking in a cloud.  To make matters worse, I was having trouble walking because the left cuff of my rain pants that had torn back in the Chairback Mountains was ripping even more up my leg as the wind wailed.  My left pant leg looked like a wind-torn flag.  The wind was blowing left to right and soon I kept stepping on my left pant leg with my right foot and nearly tripped myself several times.  Each time I stepped on the ripped pant leg, it tore more.  By the time I got to the summit, it was torn all the way up to my knee and my calf was freezing from exposure.  My rain jacket was wet too from the blowing mist we were walking in.
Right before the summit, the trail is a short steep rocky climb.  I looked up and could barely make out four people at the sign that was probably around 50 feet away.  As I got closer, I could see that it was Big Spoon and Duke of the Trail.  They had stuck to their plan and had waited up in the cold wet windy summit for us.  I thought I would get emotional when I would get close to the famous sign, but I never did.  I was cold and wet and could barely stand in one place due to the wind.  There was no view whatsoever, so all I wanted to do was get our pictures taken at the sign and get back down to below tree line and get out of the bad weather.  Despite the bad conditions, the young guys were sticking with their plan to take the Knife’s Edge trail down the mountain.  We were sticking to our plan and going down the Hunt Trail (AT) the way we came.  I tried to text Black Bear from the summit to let him know when we’d be down, but my texts wouldn’t go through.  He lives in Bangor and offered to pick us up and bring us back to a hotel near the airport.  Now I had that to worry about while trying to work my way down the mountain boulders.
We had no idea how we were going to get out of Baxter and get to Millenocket or Bangor.  The trip down the mountain took about the same time as going up, but it was a lot easier in the steep boulder climb section because we could use our hands and arms to hold on to rocks as we lowered ourselves to the next landing.  As we got lower in elevation, the wind died down, it got warmer, and the sky was clearer.  It’s a good thing we left really early this morning because we must have passed two dozen hikers going up - including the four young guys who were at The Birches Campsite last night.  We finally got down to the Katahdin Stream Campground and traded our daypacks back in for our packs.  As I walked through the campground, I thought we might be able to get a ride from a weekend hiker leaving (it was early Sunday afternoon) the park.  Nearly everyone was already gone however - except for a guy sitting in a chair waiting for his campfire to burn out.  I noticed his car had an AT 2016 thru-hiker sticker on his bumper.  I yelled out to him that I noticed his sticker and gave him a thumbs up.  The three of us were trying to figure out how to get out of the park because there’s no cell service anywhere and call Black Bear or a shuttle.  We didn’t want to hike 6 miles back to the Abol Bridge CG store (they have WiFi for $2/hr), so I suggested hitchhiking from a day hiker or asking the 2016 AT camper for a ride.  NoFilter said he’s on it and headed over to find the guy I mentioned.  Long story short, the camper agreed to take us to Millenocket where we’d call Black Bear - or stay at the AT Lodge if we had to.  While driving to town, we found out the campers trail name in his 2016 hike was Sweeper (he was the first hiker in the morning and would take one for the team by breaking all the spider webs).  When telling Sweeper about Black Bear, he looked at us and said he knew him because they started their 2016 thru-hike on the same day.  Sweeper even knew Black Bears real name because they’re friends on Facebook.  Small world - again.  We offered to buy Sweeper lunch and he accepted.  Shortly after getting to the restaurant, Black Bear showed up and we all - including the 4 young guys and their parents who picked them up from the trail today- were there.  I believe it’s the only restaurant other than McDonalds and Subway that were open.
We ended the day with Black Bear taking us to our hotel in Bangor - and we all ate at a Mexican restaurant for dinner.  It was so hectic today, it never sunk in that I was done.  Maybe because I had to make flight plans, get a rental car, find lodging in Pearisburg, VA, then find a way home.  I technically don’t have to go back to do the Peter’s Mountain VA section since it was officially closed in mid March when I was there, but it’s something I feel I need to do.  I’m sure it will all sink in eventually.  I’ll continue to update the journal after doing the Pearisburg 20 miles, followed by a couple reflection and thank you posts.  I also want to document some gear notes on what worked and what didn’t.  Thank you to everyone who has followed along and supported me.  Happy Fathers Day to all the Dads out there.","The Birches Campsite

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639845,"Monday 6/21/21Since our Bangor Airport hotel suspended their shuttle to the airport due to COVID, I took an Uber.  Flew to Charlotte, NC, rented a car, and stopped for the night in Dublin, VA.


Tuesday 6/22/21It rained last night and all morning.  Since I had nothing to do, I decided to hike a small 1.3 mile section near Pearisburg that I missed from Cross Ave (where Broccoli from Angels Rest Hostel picked me up in March) to the New River Bridge at VA 460. It will make tomorrow a little shorter.  It rained pretty hard and I took it really easy.  Most of this stretch is minor ups and downs but it was nice to walk on a fairly smooth path.  When I got to the bridge, I scoped out a place across the street to be picked up or dropped off tomorrow - depending which direction I hike.  After hiking back to my rental car, I drove to the hostel.  It felt kind of weird coming back here, but when I crested the hill in the driveway, I couldn’t believe what I saw.  There were hikers and tents everywhere.  I was figuring on the bubble being long gone from here by now.  Sure enough, they had no bunks or private rooms available.  Most of the hikers decided to stay another night rather than hike in the rain.  I was offered to tent, but I declined.  There’s no way I was going to sleep in my tent at this point in my trip.  They did have an open spot to take me tomorrow to Peters Mountain trailhead on their 7 am shuttle.  It was easier for them (and me) to hike SOBO back to Pearisburg rather than them driving all the way to Peters Mtn later on just to pick up me.  It will be the only section of my entire trip I hiked southbound.  I then went to see if one of the two local motels had a room and randomly selected the Holiday Lodge Motel.  It was bigger and more likely to have a room for me.  They had a couple still available so I took one.  The motel was clean (most important), but it was pretty run down and several things in the room didn’t work.  I cleaned up and went across the street for an early dinner and to watch a Euro 2021 soccer game at the Mexican restaurant.


Wednesday 6/24/21Mountain Mike (1982 AT thru-hiker) drove me and another hiker to the Peters Mtn trailhead.  It was a cool sunny morning with low humidity.  I started hiking at 7:30 am and immediately faced a 1500 foot 3.5 mile uphill.  The trail had some rocks here and there but was fairly smooth.  There were several switchbacks too - which were really nice considering Maine, NH, and Vermont didn’t seem to like that concept.  When I reached the top, I felt like “that was it?”.  It seemed so easy compared to what I’ve been doing for the last month.  I checked my watch and I climbed the mountain at more than 2.5 mph without really pushing.  The next 6 or 7 miles were more rocky and through the forest with long weeds and grass on each side of the trail.  I recalled how nice it was earlier in the year where there was very little vegetation rubbing against your legs when you walked.  There were no views at all except for two young bucks standing next to the trail as I passed by 10 yards from me.  They looked at me but never left. They must be used to the hiker bubble.  The AT got me one more time today.  While going up one of the hills in the woods, I was looking down to make sure I didn’t turn my ankle on a random rock hidden by the weeds.  All of a sudden - Wham!  I conked my head on a blowdown that I didn’t see due to the brim of my hat.  Man did that hurt.  I’m writing this the day after and have a big knot on my head.  Since this 15 mile stretch was closed in March due to downed power lines, I kept thinking I was going to be walking along them for awhile.  I was now over 12 miles into the hike and no power lines.  Finally, the trail came out of the woods and came out into the open.  I’m guessing I walked less than a quarter mile along the towers and that was it.  I finally reached the final leg of today’s section and knew it was a long and mostly gradual downhill to the river.  There were several NOBOs going up while I was descending but most of them weren’t interested in a discussion so I just said hello and kept going.  I’m guessing hiking in the bubble is kind of like day hiking in a busy area or park.  There are so many people that it’s not practical to stop or talk much.  Another plus for starting early.  I was about 5 minutes from the end of today’s section and could hear traffic on VA 460 when I saw what I thought was a large dog run across the trail 20 yards ahead.  I looked up and it was a bear.  He or she lumbered across the path and into to woods without even looking at me.  He started walking after 5 yards into the brush, but was too far in for me to get a picture.  Wow - what a great parting gift from the AT.  Doc picked me up at 2:30 pm at the Giles Farm Bureau where I turned around yesterday to complete all 2193.1 miles of the AT - even the closed section.  It was an expensive 21 miles, but now it’s over and I’m going home.  Get busy living, or get busy dying.",,View Entry,"Jun 23, Wed",0

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642770,"I’ve decided to add a couple post-hike entries to document continuation of my 2021 experience.  Two fellow hikers, and now friends, that I met during my journey are nearing completion of their flip flop thru-hike down in Georgia.  I wanted to surprise them near the end of their trip so I left Toledo shortly after 10 pm on Friday night with the plan to drive as far as I could before stopping to sleep as needed in a rest area.  I made it all the way to Tennessee just north of Knoxville but had to pull into a gas station since there weren’t any rest areas on I-75 in TN other than the one near the Kentucky border.  I slept uncomfortably in the driver seat for approximately 90 minutes and then resumed my southbound trip.
I originally met Rumbles and NoFilter at the Hanover Adventure Tours Hostel in Norwich, VT.  After taking a zero there (they did not), I finally caught up with them 97 miles later in North Conway, NH.  I hiked the majority of the trip up to that point by myself.  They generously allowed me to join them to hike through the White Mountains.  I was very anxious about going it alone through the Whites due to potentially bad weather, extreme trail, and the difficult planning required due to the huts being closed.  I ended up staying with them all the way to Mt. Katahdin.  Their friendship, humor, and camaraderie was instrumental in completing my trip.  They’re neighbors from Woodstock, Georgia and started in late February near Marion, VA.  After we summited Mt. Katahdin in June, they returned to Marion (after a few weeks off for Rumble’s son’s wedding) to finish their thru-hike.  That meant hiking SOBO for the finish to Springer Mountain.  I’ve kept up on their progress by watching their YouTube channel, Hiking with David and Joe) and through texts with Rumbles wife Christy.  I wanted to hike the last few days with them as they completed their journey with a plan to park my car just south of where they were and hiking northbound to intercept them and surprise them.  However, after being off trail for 8 weeks and being out of shape - combined with the big mile days they were putting in, I decided it would be better to hike a short amount with them during the day and support them with food, drinks, transportation, and the ability to slackpack to the finish if they wished.  The last thing I wanted was to put them in a position of slowing down for me.  They were moving quickly and looked like they were going to be at Unicoi Gap sometime on Saturday afternoon.  I got to the trailhead around 11 am and started hiking northbound with my daypack with a couple of cold Gatorades.  I figured I would hike an hour up Rocky Mountain, meet them, and then back down to the car.  I took my time climbing since I haven’t been on anything close to a hill since Mt. Katahdin. I got to the summit and started to descend when I wondered if I missed them somehow.  A quick text to Christy confirmed where they were earlier that morning so I just needed to wait.  I went down the mountain a little and decided to turn back and wait somewhere near the top.  I had to duck under a fallen tree across the trail and recalled that whichever of the two was leading would yell out “low branch” to avoid conking their head on the limb.  The wooded trail took a turn right after the branch and went uphill afterwards.  I found a nice boulder to sit on and wait for them.  I would hear them yell low branch to get my camera ready for when they came around the bend.  My plan worked like a charm.  About 15 minutes later, I heard them coming and placed my phone over my face and started filming.  Rumbles was leading and gave me a “How ya doin’” as he started to pass me.  I lowered the camera and told them it’s about time they got here because I’ve been waiting for an hour.  They both erupted with surprise to see me sitting in the middle of the woods on a mountain in northern Georgia.  After a short reunion they downed the two Gatorades and we started down to my car.  They told me their plan to get to Springer by Tuesday morning to try to beat the rain from Tropical storm Fred.  I offered to slackpack them the rest of the day or even drive them to Hiawasee for the night to stay out of the rain that night.  They had already put in a long day and it was hot.  Also, calling it a day today did not alter their plan to get to Neel Gap tomorrow since they’d be carrying lighter packs.   After a celebratory beer,  we headed for Hiawasee.  The Holiday Inn Express was full so we opted for the Budget Inn - which is where me and Evergreen stayed back in February.  The motel was clean and cheap - with a bonus that my TV worked this time.  We had a late lunch at the Hiawasee Brew and dinner at Daniel’s Steakhouse.  The Codger Gang was back together.  For the record, I hiked  4 miles today up and back down Rocky Mountain.  One slight view, but the rest was in the forest.  The trail is definitely different between the winter and summer.  Despite the cold, snow and ice, I think I prefer winter on the AT (at least in this section).",,View Entry,"Aug 14, Sat",0
Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643115,"Day 2 of my post-hike support of Rumbles and NoFilter.
I dropped them off at 6:30 am at Unicoi Gap to resume the southbound completion of their thru-hike.  It was still dark when they started up Blue Mountain and I could see their headlamps from my car for the first few minutes until they finally faded behind the foliage.  I wanted to do some hiking on this trip as well but don’t want to slow them down.  I waited for 15 minutes when it was light enough to not require my headlamp and started the climb.  It wasn’t as steep and rocky as I recalled and wasn’t too difficult.  The vegetation growing over the trail was wet and thick in a few spots and was pretty uncomfortable.  I reached Blue Mountain Shelter (2.4 miles) and was surprised to see how crowded it was.  There were two tents and hammock as well as a fairly full shelter.  There were only a couple of teenage girls awake but I was only there long enough to compare the same view from the shelter between summer and winter.  The February view was outstanding but there was no view at all today through the trees.  I didn’t want to wake anyone by talking with the girls so I just headed back down to the gap.
The plan was for the guys to lighten their packs so they can do more miles to beat the Tuesday storms - and that meant not carrying food.  I was going to meet them for lunch at Hogpen Gap.  I used the Guthooks App to navigate the mountain roads to get there since there wasn’t a cell signal to use Google Maps.  I got there a bit early and started hiking northbound to meet them on the trail.  After 30 minutes or so, nature was calling so I took a side trail 20 yards into to woods to take care of business.  I was close enough to the AT that I could hear Rumbles and NoFilter in the small chance they would pass by at that moment.  After a few short minutes, I resumed hiking north.  15 minutes later and still not seeing them, I sent a text asking where they were.  As I was typing, I received a text from them that they were at my car.  Damn, what’s the odds of them passing by at the exact moment I was contributing nutrients to the forest (yes - I dug a cat hole like we’re supposed to).  I gave them the code to unlock my door so they could start their lunch and I started to jog back down to the gap.  When I got there, two of NoFilter’s (Mike and Dave) friends from home had shown up to surprise him.  We talked for awhile and soon the guys were back on the trail towards Neel Gap.  I followed Mike and Dave in their car down the country roads to Neel Gap.  We got there pretty quickly and I went over to the Blood Mountain Cabins to reserve one for the night.  Unfortunately, they’re closed on Sundays - which meant we had to make alternate plans.  Mike and Dave wanted to do some hiking to meet the guys, but I knew it’s a decent climb up Lovelland Mountain behind Mountain Crossings.  They’re both in their 70s and not in hiking shape, so we didn’t want to leave too soon.  I bought a couple of AT souvenir shirts and then we started our very slow trek up the mountain.  We only made about a mile and a half before meeting up with Rumbles and NoFilter.  Rumbles and I kept a decent pace downward leaving NoFilter to hike with his buddies.  With a mile to go, the rain started and on went our rain jackets.  It was just then when the skies really opened up. It rained so hard that the trail was a flowing creek.  There was no way around it other than to walk right through the several inch deep flowing water.  We finally got under the stone walkway at Mountain Crossings to get out of the rain.  NoFilter showed up a couple minutes later and then Mike and Dave 10 minutes after that.  Even with our rain jackets, we were drenched.  We just threw our wet clothes and shoes into a garbage bag to dry at the hotel later on.  We drank a couple beers and had some snacks while waiting for Rumble’s son and daughter-in-law to arrive.  Mike and Dave headed home and the rest of us headed for Blairsville for a barbecue dinner.  After eating at Rib Country barbecue and ice cream next door, we said our goodbyes to the kids and headed for the Comfort Inn.  We used their drier for our wet clothes and could only hope our shoes would be dry enough to at least be not too uncomfortable.  I figured I hiked and jogged around 10 miles today and was pretty happy with that.  That leaves a little more than 30 miles to go for Rumbles and NoFilter to complete their 2021 thru-hike.",,View Entry,"Aug 15, Sun",0
Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643196,"It rained fairly hard last night, so getting NoFilter and Rumbles to a hotel where they could dry their clothes proved to be a good move.  The rain from Tropical Storm Fred was supposed to arrive in the afternoon so the boys wanted to get an early start.  Their target was 23.1 miles to Hawk Mountain Shelter.  My plan was to hike up to Blood Mountain Shelter and back to my car - and then drive to Woody Gap to hike NOBO to meet them for lunch.  There are signs at Mountain Crossings at Neel Gap warning you not to park there for day hikes up to Blood Mountain so I dropped the guys off and drove north a quarter mile to the Byron Reese Trailhead.  Since it was an early weekday morning with misty rain, there was only one other car there.  There seemed to be be more overflow parking spots than designated spots so I imagine the trail from here to the AT and up to Blood Mountain is packed on a clear weekend day.  It was all uphill for the 2 miles up Blood Mountain shelter.  When I was here on my NOBO thru-hike in early February, the climb down the mountain was iced-over rocks and extremely treacherous.  Today the path was wet rocks, puddles, and a misty rain.  It was fairly easy hiking and I took my time.  Hiking short sections on the AT the last two days has been enjoyable and stress-free compared to earlier this year when I was mostly alone and uncertain of what was ahead and where I was going to sleep each night.  In addition, completion of the thru-hike injected self-confidence in place of the “uncertain” feeling I had for much of the trip.  There were no views on Blood Mountain due to the clouds and fog, but I enjoyed being up there anyhow while reminiscing.  I don’t mean to beat the point to death, but the difference between the winter and summer seasons on the AT is enormous.  I went down the other side of the mountain slightly so I could retrace my NOBO steps to film a nearly identical summer video of NOBO summiting that I made in the winter.  There was nobody else here this time (Evergreen was here in February) and I headed back down to my car.
Before driving around the mountain, I stopped into Mountain Crossings to grab a few sub sandwiches and drinks for NoFilter and Rumbles.  Since my plan was to park my car at Hightower Gap and hike a half mile to stay at Hawk Mountain Shelter with the guys tonight, I wanted to get some beer and ice for the evening to celebrate their last night on the AT.  I brought a small cooler with me for this exact opportunity.  Mountain Crossings had neither so I headed towards Woody Gap and would figure out where to get the stuff later on.   Not far from Neel Gap, I came across Turner’s Corner General store and bought ice, but they didn’t have the type of beer that my friends preferred.  I arrived at Woody Gap and started hiking NOBO with the hope of reaching Big Cedar Ledges where I recall there being a nice view from a rock outcropping.  It wasn’t raining any longer but was gray and mostly cloudy.  I arrived at the ledges and the guys had just arrived themselves.  After a quick look at the no views, we headed back down to my car.  We ate lunch at the same stone picnic table I ate at in February.  Woody Gap is a great spot with tables, trash cans and a privy with toilet paper - what luxuries.  We ate rather quickly and they headed south to hopefully beat the rain coming in.  I mapped out the best way to get to Hightower Gap and it required a long drive on a winding narrow and rough stone mountain road.  Shortly after leaving Woody Gap, I came into the town of Suches.  It got a bad wrap based on comments on the Guthooks App, but it seemed like a pretty neat little mountain “town” to me.  I stopped into Wolf Pen Gap Country store and got some beer for tonight at the shelter.  The drive to Hightower Gap on the Forest Road seemed to take forever and I couldn’t go more than 15 mph without risking damage to my suspension system.  I started hiking NOBO up Sassafras Mountain to meet the guys.  Again, it didn’t seem as difficult this time.  I wanted to hike a little farther so I walked quicker this time and met them 3.7 miles later at Cooper Gap.  They arrived at the gap almost exactly at the same time I did.  I could see they were moving fast - and without stopping, they informed me of their plan to “go for it” and try to summit Springer Mountain tonight.  Their thought was that I could get them to a hotel or home tonight after walking a short time today in the rain vice hiking 10 miserable miles tomorrow in the middle of the storm.  I didn’t know if I could keep up with them  - especially having to immediately climb Mt. Sassafras again but would certainly try.  We were flying and running on adrenaline and it reminded me of our morning sprint to Monson, ME to get to Shaw’s hostel not too long ago.  I actually felt good and was keeping up with them when we arrived at Horse Gap.  They needed to take a bathroom break and I didn’t, so I took the opportunity to keep going and hopefully get to my car ahead of them to set up drinks and snacks for their final push to Springer.  I ended up getting there only about 3 minutes before them, but it was enough to get everything ready.  They stopped for less than 10 minutes and soon hurried off into the woods.  I admit being disappointed at not camping out with them one last time at the shelter and enjoying a few beers before sleeping (which we never could do previously while out on the trail), but it was exciting to help them work their plan.  They have had terrible weather the last couple of weeks and had enough of the rain and wet and were ready to be done.  I recall feeling the same way in Maine.  After 4.5 months, I was exhausted and ready to go home.  The drive to the Springer Mountain parking lot was short, but very slow.  The sun was still shining in the late afternoon, but the clouds were starting to roll in.  I stopped at a trailhead parking lot for the Benton McKaye trail to look at a map.  I love to study maps and was curious where this trail went since it crosses and coincides with the AT multiple times in the south.  I soon arrived at the Springer Mountain lot and dinked around a bit prior to heading north since I had already hiked 11.5 miles today up and down three fairly significant mountains and am no longer in hiking shape.  I want to be able to keep up with them heading up Springer.  I figured I’d go for a couple miles, meet them, turn around and head back to my car.  That would be over 17 miles for the day and pretty much all I could comfortably handle.  Just as I got out of my car, the rain started.  Ok - I admit it.  I’m soft.  I’ll wait another 30 minutes or so and shorten the time hiking in the rain.  I recalled this section of trail was fairly easy, well travelled, and wide enough for an umbrella, so I hiked the mile to meet them and back with it to keep as dry as possible prior to summiting.  When we met, I was amazed at how fast they were moving and how drenched they were.  They had a look of determination in their eyes and I just drafted in the back all the way to my car.  I dumped the umbrella for the climb up Springer to allow use of two trekking poles and Rumbles and NoFilter shed their packs for the final mile.  Rumbles led the final charge up the mountain and they must have been running on adrenaline.  This was it!  The final mile of their journey.  It was getting dark and we were moving uphill on lots of wet rocks in a steady rain, but I’m guessing we were still doing 3 mph.  We passed the Benton McKaye trail crossing, then the blue blaze trail to the Springer Mountain Shelter, and that left only the final 0.1 mile of their 2193.1 mile trek to go.  Finally, Rumbles and NoFilter crested the mountain and arrived at the plaque in the stone marking the southern terminus of the AT.  I stopped short of the summit to give them a minute or so to themselves and let them take in what they just did.
They started NOBO on February 28 at the Partnership Shelter in southern Virginia and  summited Mt. Katahdin on June 20.  They returned to Georgia and took 4 weeks or so off the trail for a wedding.  The then completed the 20 miles near Pearisburg, VA that were closed earlier on, and headed southbound from Marion.  They finished up the trip with a 31.3 (plus a mile back down to the car) day.  The last few miles were in a drenching rain.  It’s amazing what these two over-60 year-olds did today.  Unfortunately, just like at Katahdin, there was no view at the summit.  I had no view here in February 1 on my first day either due to snow flurries - which made me 0 for 3 on AT terminus summit views in 2021.  That’s ok because it gives me a reason to come back to each end for a future day hike to see what I missed.  The guys then did some filming for their “Hiking with David and Joe” YouTube channel followed by some pictures at the plaque.  We then headed back down the mountain at a much more leisurely pace - partly due to being dusk and on slick rocks, and partly due to we were already soaked and were no longer trying to beat the storm and darkness.  I’m addition, they could enjoy the final victory lap of sorts of their thru-hike.
We changed out of our wet clothes and even though it would be late, we decided to head back to Woodstock, GA to get them home.  I just changed in the car, but NoFilter and Rumbles took their dry clothes 30 yards away into the woods to a kiosk that had an overhang to stay out of the rain.  While we were summiting Springer, a school bus (we couldn’t tell who was in it) came in and parked right near my car.  The drivers side of my car was on the other side from the bus and I was wet enough and it was dark enough that I didn’t care and changed very quickly and discreetly.  Soon we were headed down the forest road very slowly due to the extreme fog, rain, pitch black out and on a very curvy and wooded route.  We finally arrived at NoFilter’s home and both of their wives were there to meet them.  It was an honor to finally meet the women behind these two codgers.  Just like my wife, they provided the much needed and great support while on our trip.  We couldn’t have done it without them.  I’m heading home to Ohio tomorrow to complete the FINAL final leg of my journey.  Thanks to Rumbles (David) and NoFilter (Joe) for helping me complete my adventure - as well as allowing me to be a part of theirs.  I’m fairly certain I’ll be hiking again with them sometime in the future.  As stated previously, I still would like to post one last time to recognize a few of the people who helped me along the way and maybe list some gear info and plus/minus on some shelters and hostels.",,View Entry,"Aug 16, Mon",0

Most Proud of - 9th official finisher in 2021.
Favorite thing - Meeting so many great people.
Least Favorite thing - So many businesses not open due to being an early starter or to COVID-19 (runner -up least favorite is ATC playing politics and not recognizing 2021 thru-hikers in the 2000 mile club who started prior to May 1 - even though they did registrations, passed out bag tags (but not until May), and had their hostels open to earn income from us hikers who they don’t recognize - seems hypocritical to me).


Hostel Ratings (26 total) - based on Cleanliness, bed, bathroom, shower, amenities, friendliness, price, resupply, food/drink availability, shuttles.


Top 5 Hostels (that I stayed at):1. Shaw’s - Monson, ME2. The Barn - Gorham, NH3. Stanimal’s - Waynesboro, VA4. Hanover Adventure Tours - Norwich, VT 5. Station at 19E - Roan Mountain, TN


Lowest 5 (that I stayed at): Note: Despite the lower ratings, I would likely stay at all of the them again.
26. Standing Bear - Hartford, NC25  Laurel Hostel - Flag Pond, TN24. Sunflower Cottage - Cascade, MD23:  Open Arms - Luray, VA22:  Bear’s Den - Bluemont, VA


YouTubers I Met (in order I met them): *Feral, *Andrew (Not Today), *Quicksand, Happy, *The Sutton’s (with 4 year old Harvey), JustAFarmer, Ultra Girl, *Rumbles and NoFilter (Hiking with David and Joe).  * indicates a cameo appearance (visual or by reference) in their video.


Special thanks to the following Trail Angels (in order that I met them): Atticus and Barbara (ride from Unicoi Gap to Hiawasee); Amy (Ride from Newfound gap to Gatlinburg); Carrie and Jim Sparks (2 free shuttles to and from Marion, VA, salve ointment, food and drinks); DowntownAlanBrown (free beer at Station at 19E); Hungry Ted (free food in Shenandoah campground); Secret Agent (ride to Open Arms hostel); Brian (ride from Linden grocery store back to the trail); The Real Deal (free rides for resupply and back to the trail, bought Dirty Dan and I breakfast, and gave us each a large package of goodies for the trail - THE BEST Trail Angel EVER); Kentucky Krew (free hostel stay In Duncannon); Renae (ride to Wind Gap, PA for lunch and back to the trail); Empaled by Tree (fuel canister in southern NJ); Trout (ride to Mosey’s Hostel in NJ); Flipakey (rides to resupply and dinner in Rutland, VT and a free haircut); Ted and Jane (NH Campground Owners who paid my dinner and drink tab at The Greenhouse in Warren, NH);  Dana (free pizza, beer, soda, snacks at the Birches Campsite in Baxter State Park - he was AWESOME); Sweeper (free ride from Baxter State Park to Millenocket, ME); Black Bear (free ride from Millenocket to Monson, ME).


Top Trail Angels:
The Real Deal - thank you for all you did for Dirty Dan and I in Harper’s Ferry and she tried to help me in NY as well, but it didn’t work out (due to my fault).Dana - thank you for the great surprise feast on the final night of my thru-hike prior to summiting.


Top Trail Towns (that I visited), not in any order: Hot Springs NC, Waynesboro VA, Gorham NH, Monson ME.


Disappointing Trail Towns:  Damascus VA - very limited places to stay when I went through in early March, the best two restaurants were both closed on Monday, and the diner wasn’t open for breakfast despite their sign and the manager telling us the night before they would be open.Port Clinton PA - no place to stay, limited resupply, one restaurant option that seemed less than welcoming to hikers. Delaware Water Gap - limited resupply for a town the trail passes through, hostel was closed.
Favorite state: Vermont was a balance of beautiful views and not overly difficult trail.


Least Favorite State: Pennsylvania. I likely missed any good views due to walking with my head down to avoid killing myself on the rock trail.  Runner-up least was Massachusetts due to less than ideal trail design.  I was walking in water for what seemed like most of the trail there - despite some beautiful scenery.


Hiking aids I couldn’t have done without:  Guthooks App, “The AT Guide” by David Miller (AWOL), ATweather.org.


Hiking buddies along the way:
Evergreen - I met him on the first day and hiked on and off with him until Standing Bear Hostel.  Thank you for helping a newbie like me to figure out how to do this hiking thing and he helped me gain confidence.
NotSoMuch - I hiked with him from Erwin to Damascus.  We had a lot in common - including hiking with my buddies NoFilter and Rumbles for awhile.  We started the same day and he would have finished before me had he not had to leave the trail temporarily for his in-laws funerals.
Dirty Dan - we met at Stanimals in Waynesboro and made it through the Shenandoahs and into mid-PA before he had to get off the trail due to injury (he came back and finished in July btw).
Rumbles and NoFilter - I met my two new friends just about the time I really needed them.  I was worn out physically and mentally and worried about tacking NH and Maine alone. Despite the odds, the trail provided two 60-ish aged guys to help me finish this adventure.  Hiking with them was a blast!


Most interesting person I met: We (Rumbles, NoFter, and I) met author Amity Gaige in a Maine shelter and hiked with her for a spell the next day.  She and her husband were researching and experiencing part of the AT for her upcoming novel based on lost hiker Gerry Largay from a few years back.  They had hired a guide to take them to the remote spot in the Main forest where her remains were found.


Terminus Unluckiness:  I’m not looking for sympathy, but it’s a bit discouraging that I had no views whatsoever twice at Springer and once at Katahdin.  That’s ok because now I can plan separate trips to summit each again on nicer days.  PS - I won’t forget how lucky I was for clear skies on Albert Mt, Mt. Washington, and on Franconia Ridge.


Was an Early Start the right decision?  It was absolutely the right time - for me.  I didn’t realize it initially and there were some tough wintery days and nights, but it became clear later on in the hike as it warmed up.  If you’re prepared for it and don’t mind being alone a lot, and can deal with limited resources (closed hostels and shuttles), then starting early has tremendous advantages.  Specifically - empty shelters, numerous tent sites, NO BUGS, plenty of water, abundant water, unobstructed scenic views, and no wet overgrown trail (especially in the mornings).


Notable Gear (I would use again): Thermarest Xtherm mattress (highest R value at lowest weight), Marmot Lithium Zero Degree down bag, Big Agnes Copper Spur UL1 tent, KUIU Peleton 97 Fleece Zip-T Hoodie, Zpacks Food Bag, Sawyer Squeeze Filter, Darn Tough socks, Zpacks Vertice Rain Jacket (I had a tough time with the pants), Outdoor Vitals Loftek Jacket (order 1 size larger), Black Diamond Spot 325 Headlamp, Tentlab Deuce #3 trowel, Exofficio Give-N-Go briefs, plus a few more items I can’t think of at the moment.  


Notable Gear (I likely would not use again):  two items come to mind. First, I might consider using the Zpacks ArcHaul Pack again, but it started to fall apart in Virginia and the upper horizontal support bar finally came out and lost in the PA woods so I hiked the rest of the trip without the support needed to make the arc.  Very light and easy to use pack but I’m going to explore other cheaper lightweight options.  I will never recommend the Black Diamond Alpine FLZ trekking poles.  They’re expensive, the locking mechanism failed twice in really cold temperatures, and one of them finally quit working altogether in Virginia.
Thank you to everyone who left a message in my journal.  Knowing there were several people following along really helped to push me to keep going during the difficult times.  A final thanks goes to my wife Debbie for holding down the fort at home while I was out playing in the woods.  She was still working too so I owe her a two-week vacation in the Caribbean (whenever it’s ok to go there again).

Mr. Freeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660459,"Our permits are for a Monday start, so we were planning on spending the day at the CLEEF camping area.  But, if the PCT representative was at the terminus and would give us our bag tags today, we were just going to start today.  After we ate a great continental breakfast supplied by Dee, Paul, and Skywalker, the three of us walked the half mile southbound towards the border wall along with Hazel and Mr. No Regrets (he’s a former Marine and a YouTuber).  The PCT rep was there, checked our permits, gave us our tags, and didn’t seem to have a problem if we started a day early.  But first, we had to get our pictures taken at the southern terminus monument.  We walked back to the campground, packed up our stuff and said our thanks and goodbyes and were off on our journey.   Hazel started off with us, but Mr. No Regrets wasn’t leaving for another hour or so.   The trail was surprisingly easy and was a packed sandy base for much of the first 3 miles or so.  Unlike the AT, there were very few rocks in this first section.  We moved along at a decent pace.  The trail did have more inclines throughout the rest of the day - including a fairly long climb from about the 4.5 mile mark to around the 9 mile mark.  Nothing too steep though, but it did slow us down though.  We were very lucky today because of the recent rainy weather, every creek (and there are only a few) shown on the FarOut App trail map was flowing strongly - and there were streams, springs, or creeks flowing near the trail all day long.  I ended up carrying very little water in a trail section that usually is very dry and requires loading up. 


Hazel stayed behind us for most of the day but we would run into her a couple times when we’d stop for photos, water, and frequent other over-60 year old required breaks.  She was planning on going to Lake Morena (20 mile day), but ended up camping near us at the 15 mile mark at Hauser Creek.  There were probably 9 or 10 tents in all near the creek, but pretty spread out where you couldn’t really see others .


span class=""Apple-converted-space""> No leafy trees at all.  We did run across Martin from Prague, so this has been a much more international trail than I experienced on the AT.  


Tomorrow we start off with a serious climb, but then are walking a mile off trail into Lake Morena to go to the famous Malt Shop.  The three of us are excited because they’re open this early in the season AND on Mondays.  We experienced numerous letdowns on the AT because so many places (including the Ice Cream Challenge) wasn’t started yet, was closed on Monday or Tuesday, or was still closed due to Covid.","Campo
