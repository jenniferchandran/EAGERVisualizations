Running Bear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634128,"I decided last night (technically, yesterday morning around 3am) to thru-hike the Appalachian Trail, aka, the most inconvenient scenic route from Georgia to Maine. 
I am leaving my job at a Suicide/Mental Health Crisis Shelter in late April. Working in crisis has been challenging, rewarding, and a very immersive learning experience. I actually love my job and making the decision to leave was difficult. But two years in crisis work takes it's toll, and after taking a backpacking break last October, I discovered the subtle signs of exhaustion were there to stay- and I want to leave before I hit burnout. I knew I wanted to backpack between leaving this job and pursuing whatever is next, but originally my plan was just to hike the section of the A.T. in the Smoky Mountain National Park, about 72 miles. This eventually turned into a plan to hike a couple hundred miles of the A.T. in VA... and then turned into a plan to hike the entire southern half of the A.T.
And now, it has folded into what I have wanted to do since encountering my first thru-hiker at 10yrs old: hike the entire damn thing. 
3am decision making is questionable and I shall start to make all important life decisions at this hour from now on. 
Technically, this will be a LASH (long-ass-section-hike), since I will be skipping the 3 sections I have already completed in previous years, leaving me with a total of 1,801.6mi to tackle. I'm keeping my start date of April 27th, since I have already notified HR of my date of resignation. I also want to have enough in my budget to finish the hike. And have enough time to condition a little (VT winters make hiking a bit more difficult, especially when skiing is calling my name), check the gear list, and move out of my apartment (I won't be homeless, just... locationally independent. Perspective, perspective). I know the later start date might backfire when (if?) I reach Mt. Katahdin, but I believe I have time to reach Baxter State Park before it closes for the season- especially since I will be skipping several hundred miles of trail. 
Guess we'll see. All I know is, after tossing and turning for a good few hours trying to decide if I want to try tackling the whole trail, once I said yes, I went right to sleep. It was a good sleep, too. Well, mostly. I did dream a bear ate me, which on the whole sounds rather unpleasant, both for myself and the bear. Thus to prevent this sort of vexatious (an SAT word to be obnoxious) experience, I will be adding a full suit of medieval knight armor to my gear list. Hopefully bears aren't particularly fond of the crunch wrap version of Hannah..

Running Bear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634186,"I work the night shift at the crisis shelter and since tonight was relatively quiet, the last 6 hours of shift have consisted of trying to figure out a reasonable budget for the thru-hike. Should I have probably done this back in February when I first had the idea of thru-hiking a long-distance trail in 2021? Yeah, but it's a lot more fun when you are getting dangerously close to leaving and still not quite sure you have the money to swing it. I put the ""fun"" in fund, ha. After quite some time crunching the numbers, I think I can safely say that I do have enough without having to tap into my savings, but it'll be cutting it a little close. Unless... a rich, distant relative I currently don't know about keels over and dies in the next month and I am sole inheritor of their estate*... which, I could say a girl can dream, but that seems vaguely horrifying, so I'll stick with making a tight budget. Which means no more frequenting coffeeshops or making other extraneous purchases from now until I leave. I'll have to make my own damn cold brew at home. 
How I suffer.
Budget aside, I also spent some time tonight listening to 'Mighty Blue on the Appalachian Trail' podcast. 5 episodes, to be exact. There's something compelling about hearing how diverse the hikers' stories and perspectives are even though they're all hiking the same trail. *If you happen to be a rich, distant relative of mine that I am currently unaware of, out of general curiosity, have you updated your will recently?

Running Bear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634459,"I am now a proud owner of a dehydrator. Honestly, I thought I’d own an air-fryer before a dehydrator (air-fryer owners are part of the elite group of adults, along with those who separate their laundry and have ""guest rooms""). But I crunched the numbers (translation: I stared miserably at the shelf of dehydrated backpacking meals at REI and decided I’d have to resort to eating Ramen and tree bark the entire trail), I decided it would be more budget conscious to purchase a dehydrator and make my own backpacking food. I had actually been thinking about getting one since my last trip in October- calorie deficient I was not, since I was armed with an ample supply of snickers and gummy worms, but I ended up craving vegetables the entire hike. My poor body was definitely lacking in the nutrition department. I figure this is a worthwhile purchase, since it will not only save me money this trip but also in the very long run (ahem, walk), since I’m decently sure I have plenty of backpacking trips in my future. 
Wal-Mart had run out of stock when I checked two weeks ago, so I ordered one online and it just came in today. I’m delighted I can now get down to the business of dehydrating plenty of vegetables and fruit. I believe this is the food group I will mostly focus on, and send several resupply boxes to myself during the trail. I can get the other food staples during stops in towns, since I’m assuming my food preferences will probably change over the length of the trail. However, even if my preferences for vegetables change, I’ll channel my inner mother and sternly voice, “You WILL eat your greens before dessert.” 
I knew I had crossed over the adulthood threshold a couple years ago when I started caring about nutrition and started preferring greens over the sweet stuff. There’s not a large margin between the two, but it’s there.

Running Bear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634621,"The good news: I think I am almost done with getting everything on my gear list!
The bad news: Somehow, my gear list expanded without my knowledge and/or permission, and my base pack weight is above what I want to carry. Rude. Of course, isn't everyone's pack above what they'd truly want? “I'll take the pack with the -minus base weight, please and thank you.”(A girl can dream, right??)
Anyway, now I'm forced with the gut wrenching decision of what to take and what to leave behind. I could wait until Mountain Crossings to make this decision, because I'm sure after 30ish miles it won't feel gut wrenching anymore. It's not like I've never backpacked before (I have a handful of experiences), but I definitely have never tackled anything of this magnitude. 2,190 miles. Holy dehydrated guacamole. That's a lot of miles! That's a lot of time! THAT'S A LOT OF TOILET PAPER! (Now that we've all had good practice hoarding that under our belts, pardon the vague joke). Someone once told me, ""You pack for what you fear."" Apparently, I fear death. Also hypothermia. And chafing. And sunburn. 
Anyway. I don't have a ridiculous amount of stuff, I've backpacked enough that I have a decent grasp on what might be important vs. what's not, but I would like to cut some base weight. And to do that, some stuff has gotta go.

Running Bear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634893,"Apparently, my apartment was unfortunately struck by a tornado. Yes I live in Vermont, and yes this act of God is highly unlikely due to the fact that there hasn't been a tornado in the Green Mountain State since 2003 and, oddly, it appears the path of destruction began and ended with my apartment, but! This is the only reasonable answer to the pressing questions of how and why there is the biggest, most catastrophic mess I have ever witnessed strewn about my living space?! I am impressed with the scale of the mess, in both the complexity and its far reaching effects. Did I do this? Surely not. 
Obviously, packing is going well. 
I guess this is what happens when you pack for a thru-hike, start moving out of your apartment, and decide to embrace minimalism by going through all of your stuff to make a hefty donation to Goodwill. Okay, okay, maybe not minimalism. But I would like to just generally own less, because the storage cube I’m renting for the next six months is rather on the small side. 
I’m stressed and surrounded by mess, so I’m going to pull the ole' college coping skill of procrastination. (Quit judging me, I was a straight A student. With a couple of B's and C's thrown in for lessons on hubris and humility.) I’ll be back to organizing this after a quick hike and a bowl (or 2) of Ben & Jerry’s ice-cream. Speaking of ice cream, Ben & Jerry's donated an entire truckload to the organization I work for, and I somehow ended up with SIXTEEN PINTS on my hands a week ago.  I'm very happy to oblige and pre-calorie, I'm counting this as part of training for the hike. Since it's the only part of my training regime I've been adhering to consistently, I am beginning to look a little like a poster child for this particular flavor (Chubby Hubby, but not the hubby part), but, I'm not complaining, there are worse problems to have. 
Worse problems being: I have several mountains of laundry to scale before I even start thinking about Springer. ",,View Entry,"Apr 15, Thu",0
Running Bear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635413,"Growing up, my parents firmly believed in the power of “character building moments,” and many of these moments were owed to our rattletrap family vehicles. Ranging from an ugly tan station wagon (with a backwards facing backseat I claimed so I could experiment gracing tailgating drivers with an assortment of facial expressions) to fifteen passenger vans, these vehicles had character. A lot of character. Unidentified mysterious sounds, check engine lights perpetually on, and at least one-door-per-vehicle that always stuck... these vehicles were held together with duct tape and prayer. 
Seriously. We once had to pray the minivan up a hill. 
This led to a strange resolve in adulthood to not care about a vehicle’s aesthetics or other issues, because, well, as long as it runs, right? I never spend a lot of money on a car. (At least... initially.)  
In between packing and having small emotional meltdowns over nothing in particular, I brought my vehicle in for an oil change today. As a last second thought, I asked them to run a diagnostic check, since my check engine light has been on for awhile (and since I drive “cars with character,” my check engine light is usually on.) 
Two hours later, I get the call: 
“Uh, Hannah… I have some very bad news.”
(Quick side note to observe that if you are on a first name basis with your mechanic, you also drive a car with character.)
“Oh no. All I need to know, Terry, is will it explode if I drive to Virginia this Friday?”
“Quite possibly, yes.”
So, now I am currently vehicle-less, but I am alive. I’m no PollyAnna, I realize it’s a sucky situation, but at the same time, I am glad I felt the small nudge to get my car checked over before landing myself in a potentially horrible situation. Humbled and grateful I get to see another day. Adding to the laundry list of issues I already knew existed in my car, my head gasket is dreadfully close to blowing and my engine is pretty shot. Somehow the oil cap blew off and there are metal shards in the tank.

Running Bear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635424,"Part One: 
I’m not sure if the incentive was to have healthy kids or if it was another “character building moment,” but on some Saturday mornings, dad would pull out the griddle and make his speciality: Broccoli Pancakes. Not pancakes with broccoli on the side, which is a weird, but a forgivable breakfast choice, not healthy vegan pancakes made with a special pre-blended vegetable flour, not even regular, happy, fluffy pancakes with a dash of protein powder made from broccoli. No, no, we’re talking full on giant chunks of FROZEN BROCCOLI IN THE PANCAKE BATTER. Not cut up in small pieces to subtly blend in, sometimes not even thawed. 
We were sheltered children. We believed this to be good! I loathed broccoli,  but it seemed a small price to pay to eat Real VT Maple Syrup, which was synonymous with liquid gold in our household. We smothered these abominations in syrup (yay, sugar!), gobbled them up, licked our sticky fingers, and asked for seconds. We didn’t know, we didn’t know. We didn’t know of the golden world beyond us, where children ate sugary cereal and watched cartoons and ran around like wild cavemen. It wasn’t until I was six years old and our church had a pancake breakfast fundraiser to send some reluctant teenagers on a mission trip to Guatemala that I discovered the truth. I saw the Promised Land- a long table piled high with fluffy buttermilk pancakes filled with delightful fruits. There were blueberry pancakes, and apple cinnamon pancakes, strawberry pancakes, and even some mixed berry pancakes!
“Dad! Can you believe it!?” We screamed with delight, “You can put things other than broccoli and spinach in pancakes!”
“Oh no” was all he whispered*
Part Two:
I have quite enjoyed my new dehydrator, and very quickly exhausted the vegetable and fruit stockpile in my fridge. So when my coworker offered to let me use her Costco membership card a couple weeks ago, I jumped at the chance. Bulk food paradise. 
I had a vague list and a not-so-vague budget, so I found myself in the frozen foods aisle. I have since come to enjoy broccoli and I was delighted to find a bag amidst the other assorted frozen veggies. I had just grabbed it and a bag of butternut squash, when I spied it. The Excalibur, the crown jewels, the holy grail of frozen broccoli: the 10lbs bag. For the uninitiated, this bag is the equivalent size of a young child and contains enough to feed a small army. Or, I thought, enough to dehydrate for plenty of backcountry meals. 
It went into my shopping cart. 
I prepared the first batch for the dehydrator when I got home, set the timer, and went to bed. 
A few hours later, I awoke, gagging on noxious fumes. A rare combination of dirty socks, sulfur, and putrefying roadkill carcass mingled together to create a bouquet of horrifying smells. (okay, okay, it wasn’t that bad, but it was bad.) I groggily stumbled out to the kitchen where the godforsaken smell emitted from my dehydrator. I opened windows, lit candles and firmly decided broccoli would not be my main staple vegetable for the trail. 
Part Three: 
Not one to waste food, I have been trying to work my way through my fridge and cupboards and use all that can’t be donated to the local food shelf. There are only so many variations of broccoli recipes I know and I was growing tired of mac n’ cheese with broccoli. So, yesterday, when I spied the half full box of buttermilk pancake flour… 
Yes. Yes, I did, and it was even worse than I remembered. Then I poured some extra Real Vermont Maple Syrup on and honestly? Not that bad, not that bad. 

*Please do not call CPS, my parents have since reformed.

Running Bear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635771,"Well. 
Most thru hikers have a story or two about poop, but I might be in a smaller category with ones who have a story before they even get to the trailhead. 
Now, what had happened was, I was flirting dangerously close with being late for my flight because of who I am as a person. Thankfully, my bf had put in some extensive work helping me move and clean the day before (thanks, Jord'n!), but somehow I still found many Important Things To Do until I absolutely needed to leave to catch my flight. Nothing says Vickery quite like not being ready to leave up until the last second. This did not leave me quite enough time to eat anything except a piece of toast and bite of egg, and two cups of coffee. My stomach was setting the stage for the events of the day. 
After my friend dropped me off (thanks Annette!), I hurried as quickly as I could to the ticket counter, clutching my carry-on stuffed with everything I would need for the girls camp I'm helping with later this summer and 3 upcoming weddings (people. please start eloping.) The zipper on my duffel bag had broken, and I was desperately trying to keep all the contents inside, while wearing my backpack and struggling to manuever a large green suitcase overstuffed with dehydrated food. 
I plopped it on the scale. I need to check this I announced. 
The flight attendant stared at me. Ma'am. The bag weight limit is 50lbs. You're gonna have to drop at least 15lbs. 
I probably will after hiking awhile. 
No ma'am, I meant from your suitcase. 
Oh.
I hurriedly and (somewhat frantically) explained to her why I needed to take a whopping 69lbs suitcase with me. She took a long look at my close-to-tears face and nodded. Ok, I can bump you up to first class, then you can check your bags for free, and there's no weight limit. Plus, she added, they don't tell you this, but you can get a complimentary drink. You look like you could use a vodka.
I asked for a coffee on the plane.  
I was getting powerfully hungry on the plane and it only increased when we landed. Just wait I told myself you can get food when you get to Virginia. My resolve lasted until I hit the main terminal, where the intoxicating smell of food overpowered me and I became victim to it's siren song. I still had an hour before boarding, and I dropped in line for Panda Express. I squinted at the board, unable to make it out without glasses. I was next up. What's it gonna be? The bored teenager sighed.   
uuuhhh ... The line behind me grew and was shifting impatiently.
I panicked. I ordered the first two things on the menu, which happened to be beef broccoli and chicken mushroom with some rice. Or, at least, that's what it was supposed to be. I'm not exactly sure what I ate. I wasn't quite sure which was the beef and which was the chicken, because both ""meats"" closely resembled each other and nothing else I've ever seen. They were oddly shaped, and had the air of chicken nuggets with a dream. They were swimming in a greasy, grey, unidentifiable liquid that had black specks.
I ate it.
I have no excuse, other than I was hungry, I vaguely shuddered when I looked at the receipt, and I determined I'd have to probably have courage on the trail to eat questionable food, so why not start now? (Did I mention I was hungry?) The broccoli was surprisingly good, but that is where I'll end the praises for this.. meal. I ate about half, before my stomach began to protest. I started walking back to my gate, when it began to protest with more urgency. I started looking for restroom signs. Airport food is special, because where else can you pay $5.99 for 7 grains of rice and get a free colon cleanse on the side? I had just located one, when I heard over the loudspeaker:Last call for flight 6821 to Lynchburg, would the following persons come to the gate: Burke and Vickery.
Oh no, oh no, oh no. 
I tend to avoid using the lavatory on airplanes, because I have a persistent fear that if the plane should ever go down, it'll be while I'm in the bathroom and I prefer not to meet my Maker in such a manner. However, desperate times call for desperate measures, and my body decided now was such a desperate time. The mystery meat was on a mission to be freed of this earthly body, do not stop Go, do not collect $200. As soon as the seatbelt sign turned off, I scurried to the back of the plane as quickly as I could without adding strange winds to the air, and was very relieved (in more ways than one) when I reached my destination. 
I had only been in there for a minute, before my worst fear realized. The ""Please Return to Your Seat"" sign started blinking. The captain had just drawled, we're about to get some turbulence, folks, when the plane dropped. Not-out-of-the-sky-to-my-untimely-death, but it was a significant drop. And then it began shaking. Meanwhile, I threw back to my Pentecostal childhood and started praying in tongues. 
After the turbulence in my stomach and air subsided, I shakily emerged, a changed woman.

It's not bad he hesitated but it could be better
I took him up on it. He had thruhiked with my brothers in 2019. They had a limited time frame, so put in hefty miles. I figured he knew what he was talking about. 
We dumped all the contents of my pack on the floor. 
First up was a ziplock bag with an assortment of tubes of ointment (antibacterial cream, Bengay for muscle soreness, sunscreen, anti itch cream). It all was briefly examined and tossed to the side. 

But, but I protested what about the sunscreen??
You'll be in the woods, you'll be fine. 
I grabbed the tube of Bengay and clutched it. This stuff works, I swear. What if I get muscle aches?
Take a Motrin.
He shook his head at my two full bottles of ibuprofen and poured a handful into a ziplock bag. 
Next, he reached for my cookware set up. I was quite proud of it, I had spent considerable time weighing out my options, perusing the shelves at REI and Outdoor Gear Exchange and Burlington. I grinned. This was my moment to shine. He pulled out the bottle of biodegradable camp soap and laughed.
No, no, no, you won't need this.
Next, he examined my sponge and tossed it. 
Nope.
Well, this might not be going as I had expected. 
He pulled out my coffee cup. What is this for?!
Coffee? I offered hopefully.
Hannah. He was working hard at maintaining a straight face. Why don't you use your pot? You don't need a separate coffee mug.
It got tossed into the growing pile. My romantic fantasies of slow mornings sipping coffee near spectacular views while breakfast cooked vanished. 
He also eliminated 3 of my five caribiners and several other odds and ends. We argued over the value of my pack cover. I won that round (is it actually winning if it means extra weight for me though...?) My Sea to Summit pillow almost got cut, but I reasoned that for the low weight, it was worth the comfort it provided. My sleeping mat and sleeping bag were scrutinized and approved. He also nodded at my bamboo toothbrush, but suggested I cut the handle off. 
My clothes bag was dumped out. He stared at my extra hiking shirt. I moved it to the discard pile myself. 
How many pairs of socks do you have? 
Five I lied easily while trying to subtly hide the other four. 
He nodded. Hm, ok, it's a lot, but it's not too bad. 
Last up was my large, extra length Colombia rain jacket. This was my pride and glory. I had been scouring Facebook marketplace and the OGE and REI garage and thrift stores for a few weeks, looking for a solid rain jacket within my price range. This one had cost me $15. I was well pleased.
Get rid of it. 
Get rid of it? Get RID OF IT??! No. Not this. I shook my head. I need it I explained reasonably For the rain
He wasn't backing down. Frog toggs. A plastic rain poncho from dollar tree. A trashbag. Get rained on. These suggestions rained (pun intended) rapidly from him.
I shook my head. No, no, no. I'm keeping it. 
This went on for sometime. We're both stubborn. 
Finally, I caved and wearily tossed it aside. I threw my hands up Fine! I'll just get wet.
But when his back was turned, I slyly slid it back into my pack. 
In all, we eliminated a little over a pound.
The next day, my sister and I arrived the at visitor center at Amicalola Falls State Park and I weighed my pack. With food and water, it topped off at 29.8lbs. We took pictures at the arch and walked back to the car so she could drive me to the Lodge at the top of the Falls. (The stairs were closed, so I'd start the Approach trail from the Lodge).

I went into the Lodge to charge my phone. Even though it's the lodge right before the trail, and I know many AT thru-hiker hopefuls stay there, I felt conspicuously out of place. I was impatient to get into the woods. While waiting for my phone to charge, I grew increasingly nervous. All the old fears came creeping back in, particularly the fear that I would begin to hate hiking. Hiking has been my refuge from the world, a place to process and grieve and heal, a way to connect with myself and God. I also just really, really like being in the woods. But what if I began to hate it? What if after a few hundred miles or months I decided I'd never want to hike again? I was seriously worried.
I'd have to find new hobbies I thought with a shudder. The horror.
I determined I would get off trail if I realized I was starting to hate it. That fear somewhat resolved, I tried to address the others with reason and logic. One by one, I probed and tried to find the root fears. After a little while, I was satisfied. I was still nervous, but no longer shaking. I even felt a little excited. It's been hard the last few weeks to feel excited about anything. I maintain a good sense of humor, but deep down, there's been a cold numbness to everything. I was dangerously close to burnout and had been battling a-not-so-great bout of existential depression and anxiety that tends to be the undercurrent of my life. TMI? Maybe. But I don't think there is anything to be ashamed of when it comes to taking care of our mental health. For me, this means taking some time away from the rush of life and spending it in the woods.
Finally, at 12:50pm, I couldn't stand waiting any longer. I hefted my backpack on, breathed a prayer, and walked to the top of the Falls. I was going to pick up the approach trail here, since a section of the steps were closed. An ominous sign greeted at the trailhead: Strenuous. 7 miles to Springer. Approx. 6 hours. Six hours?! I grinned. My first challenge. I was going to aim for half of that. 
On the way up, I passed a good handful of weekend backpackers. With each passing mile, I became happier. The sense of home grew. It was a gorgeous day and I felt strong. The heat and humidity was more than I had accounted for, and I got a decent headache, but I combated this with plenty of water. 
I met my first fellow thru-hiker 4miles in. He was slumped against a tree and looked close to tears. Hey! You headed to Katahdin? I asked Yeah, if I don't die on the way to Springer he groanedIt was his first backpacking trip and I was impressed he'd chosen such a huge endeavor.Look, I said, the first time I went backpacking, on the very first hill, I swore I'd never do it again. It does get better. You've got this, man. One step at a time. He looked somewhat comforted. 
I reached Springer at 4:12pm, fairly close to my goal of three hours. Other than the splitting headache from the heat, I felt good. I snapped a picture of myself collapsed on the rock and texted my dad I walked the entire width of the AT... Can I go home now?? After a couple minutes, I trekked on, a deep sense of gratefulness and hope settling into my bones. 
I couldn't wipe the dorkiest grin off my face for the next 8.1miles to Hawk Mountain Shelter to spend my first of many nights on the trail. As I crawled into my sleeping bag, I checked in with myself. Did I hate hiking yet??? Not by a long shot.","Amicalola Falls Lodge

Running Bear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636123,"Day Two: Hawk Mtn Shelter to Mtn Crossings
Am I absolutely crazy?? Maybe a little. I'm not quite sure how I got the idea of hiking to Blood Mountain on my second day, but once it entered my brain, it got stuck there. Thus far, I'm finding GA to be fairly ""easy"" hiking. Easy is a very relative term. Compared with the Vermont mountains I've been hiking and backpacking for the last ~3 years, Georgia's rolling elevation changes, fairly graded trail, and SWITCHBACKS (I'm declaring my love for switchbacks right now. Bless you GA, bless you. The only switchback Vermont knows about is the beer.) My easy is someone else's hard. But yeah, other than the heat, I'm enjoying Georgia. 
I woke up at 4:45am and by 5:15am, decided to get up and hit the trail. I started hiking at 5:45am, my headlamp lighting the way before me. The second ridge I ascended was magnificent. On one side, the full moon was beginning to sink below the horizon, and on the other side, the faint pinks and oranges of the sunrise were peeking through the trees. I grinned. What a gorgeous day it was going to be. 
I reached the next shelter (about 8miles from where I began) at 9am and meet a bunch of hikers. My dad had advised me to take my boots off at every opportunity, so I quickly did so and set about making a second breakfast, like a fat little happy hobbit. I hung out at the shelter for a little over an hour, and that is when the idea of attempting to get to Blood Mountain struck. Another hiker informed me one had to have a bear canister between Jarred Gap and Mountain Crossings. This meant I would have to either cut my day short at Jarred, or push on all the way to Mtn Crossings. I decided to go for it. 
It WAS a gorgeous day. I had fun chatting quickly with other NOBOs as we passed, but I mostly had the hike to myself. I stopped at 1pm at a road crossing, delighted to discover trash bins and restrooms! Real restrooms, with toilet paper! What a novelty, what civilization. I also had cell reception and called my boyfriend. He remembered this section of trail, having hiked it before. Blood Mountain is beautiful he said when I told him my plan. As I was beginning to strap my boots on again, a rowdy group of middle and highschool boys burst from the trail and collapsed on the picnic table beside mine. Now guys their trip leader said I know we were going to go to Chick-fil-A, but the other guys are really struggling and they won't be here for awhile. All the boys groaned in unison. I felt their disappointment radiating. What do you think we should do?I think y'all should go I tossed over my shoulderOne of the more vocal middle school boys roused at this and cheered. Yeah! He yelled Thankyou Ma'am!The trip leader glared at meI shrugged. You could bring back some for the others I suggestedThe entire group perked up and chattered with excitement. Now, now, I don't know said the trip leader It would be cold by the time we got back. Perhaps sensing a ""teachable moment"" he paused and then added significantly What do you think Jesus would do?I think He would go get lunch I declared I mean, He fed the 5,000, made breakfast on the beach, and asked for fish when he saw the disciples after he resurrected. Seems to me like He's a big advocate of food I finished and escaped to the woods behind the disapproving face of the trip leader and the whoops of the boys. I felt a little guilty, but not much.
By the time I reached Mountain Crossings, it was mere minutes from dark and I was exhausted. I trudged through the iconic breezeway of the only building the AT goes through, and wearily climbed the hill towards a mess of tents. A few guys sat around smoking and whistled when I walked up. I immediately was on guard. I made a show of looking for a spot to pitch my tent, rapidly thinking through my options. I did not want to walk any further and I did not feel particularly safe, based on some of their comments and demeanor. A guy a little below the hill called out, Hey! There's some good spots down here! I quickly sized him up and he seemed like a more savory character, so I slid down the steep hill. They bothering you? He quietly asked. Nah, but I'm not sleeping up there tonight I replied
I pitched my tent, hung my bear bag and went to hunt down water. One of the... Gentlemen.. from the ridge had followed me. I stiffened. He attempted to make small talk and I attempted to give short replies. Finally he ventured You here alone? Are you hiking by yourself? Where's a pretty gal like you heading? At that, I moved from being nervous to mad. How dare he make me feel unsafe? I glanced over and sized him up. I could take him if I needed to. Look, I snapped, You might be completely harmless, but I'm gonna let you know that you're coming across as really creepy right now.oh wOw, he said dramatically I'm just asking. Don't want to be creepy.Cool I shrugged and turned back to filling up my water bottle then don't be. He left me alone and no one else bothered me for the rest of the night. I slept with my trekking poles and pepper spray within arm's reach.","Hawk Mountain Shelter

My ""I can take care of myself"" muscle wanted to flex and prove itself.Do you know how to hang a bear bag? Yes I replied archly. To be fair, yes I do know how to hang a bear bag, but I'm not particularly good at it. His was hanging from a branch that seemed excessively high off of the ground. I grabbed my rock soc, took aim, and fired. It was an excellent throw. The rock soc sailed up and right over the branch with precision and grace.Wow! First try, too! the guy exclaimed, clearly impressed. I smiled smugly and shrugged. Yeah, I can hang a bear bag. A few seconds later, and my smile faltered as I realized my flaw with deepening dread: I had let go of the other side of the string. I had just thrown a rock in a small bag over a tree branch for no apparent reason.I coughed, slightly embarrassed, and grabbed my roc soc for round two. The guy nodded encouragingly, which somehow made it worse. This time, I firmly clutched one side of the sting in one hand, and with the other, strongly threw the rock sock upwards. It flew up, smacked the branched, and promptly fell downward, missing my nose by a few inches. I gritted my teeth. Round three. You got this! Cheered the guy.I tried not to glare at him.I stepped back, string firmly gripped in hand. I swung my throwing arm around a few times, like a pitcher warming up. My eyes narrowed in the gathering darkness, locking into the chosen spot on the branch. This was the moment. Time slowed and ceased to have meaning. I could hear my heart pumping in slow rhythm, like war drums as soldiers march to battle. The birds stopped singing, leaning in, waiting with bated breath. (Okay, it wasn't that dramatic, but the pressure was on). I took a deep breath, took a step back, and threw the damn rock soc. Up, up, up, it sailed, the perfect arch. It was glorious. It gracefully dropped on the other side of the branch and began it's descent. The air released from my lungs, the birds burst into the hallelujah chorus and angels wept with joy. I took another step backwards, forgetting the small log behind me. I stumbled, trying to catch my balance. I was wildly off kilter, and there was no regaining my balance. I took a few more stumbling steps backwards, and fell, landing on my butt in the middle of the stone firepit. Oh my, are you ok?! The guy asked concerned.I stood up, brushed myself off and laughed. Nothing bruised but my pride and my behind I said.The next morning, we hitched down to Blairsville, GA to a tiny diner named appropriately, ""Hole in the Wall."" The food was amazing, the servings generous, and I found myself unable to clean my plate. Give it a hundred miles or so, and I bet I won't have this problem again I said. We found another hitch back to Mountain Crossings, where I waited for my phone to charge and lazed about. I didn't start hiking until 1pm. Once again, it was a gorgeous day. The climbs were fairly mellow, with loping descents and pretty views. My heat headache returned and I noticed my arms were getting quite reddened by the sun. I decided next town stop would include buying sunscreen. To compensate, I drank copious amounts of water.

Running Bear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636369,"Day 4: Popular Stamp Gap to Hostel around the Bend
I woke up early and in a surprisingly good mood. Surprising because the words ""good"" and ""morning"" never seem to quite go together. I looked ahead on Guthooks, and realized a hostel was not too far in the future. It was approximate 27 miles away, and I quickly calculated that I could be there the next day. I set out and found it hard not to grin at the blooming GA woods. There were clumps of trillium, budding oaks, and patches of a small, spiky flower I couldn't identify, but smelled amazing. Of course, 4 days in, most things smelled a lot better than the... hiker aroma... my body was producing. 
About 5miles in, and I realized I was making good time. I had started around 7am, and it was now a little past 9am. A vague plan started forming in my mind. What if.. what if I tried for a marathon day? I did my first marathon day (26miles) while backpacking last October in the Shenandoahs. While Georgia hasn't been extremely difficult, the terrain did feel harder than the Shenandoah's mostly ridgeline hiking. Still. The idea entrenched itself in my mind. The appeal of staying in a hostel, getting a salad and a burger, and TAKING A SHOWER was too difficult to resist. At 10am, I reached Blue Mtn Shelter and had a rare moment of cell service. I called the hostel.
Could you slackpack me from Unicoi Gap to the hostel? Uh.. yeah, yeah we can do that. Be there in 45min?
I was thrilled. I bounced down  the last mile to the gap, day dreaming of the bliss of a shower that night. From Unicoi to the road the hostel is on, is 17.7miles. I had already walked 9 miles to the Gap, so together it would be about .6 over a full marathon. A bad idea? Perhaps. But in the moment, I did not care.
When Bear arrived at the parking lot, I tossed my backpack into the trunk. 
I know technically we're not supposed to, but can I reserve a bunk? I grinned my widest grin and clasped my hands.Well.. okay. Yeah, I can do that for you.
It was my lucky, lucky day.
At 11am, I turned and began the climb of my first hill, sans pack. How light! How free! How delightfully quickly my feet could prance up the hill! What joy! It lasted the first mile, before the heat of the day set in, and the reality of still having close to 17miles to go. Guthooks indicated several decent elevation gains and losses. I sobered slightly. Still. The weather was beautiful and there were many interesting and pretty things to look at and soon I was close to Indian Gap. Half a mile before I reached it, two friendly day hikers chatted with me and informed me that there was trail magic at the Gap. 
I jogged there. Food, glorious food! There were chips, and cookies, and hotdogs, and Gatorade and water and homemade brownies. I was the first hiker to arrive since they set up, and they were very willing to supply my stomach with whatever it desired, and it's desires were many. 
I stayed quite awhile and made a good dent in their food supply. As I left, one of the guys handed me a small envelope. It's a note of encouragement for a hard day, he explained.I nodded and took it. Extra weight, but I'm not one to turn down encouraging words.
By mile 24, I was in a little pain. Nothing extreme, but each step was beginning to take concentrated effort. I stopped for water and took out the note of encouragement. It helped. With fresh determination, I checked the time. 5:57pm. I decided it could be fun (fun being a very relative term here) to try to make it a 12 hour day. Since I started hiking at 7am, this would mean I had an hour and three minutes to hike the remaining 2.7 miles. I started jogging the downhills. 
I reached the road at 7:04pm. My marathon day was done.
Well, except for the fact that the hostel was still another 0.6mi down the road. It was the longest damn half mile I've ever walked","Popular Stamp Gap

Running Bear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636373,"Day 5: Hostel Around the Bend to Muskrat Creek ShelterAnother hiker and I hitched down to town for a resupply. I was hellbent on getting a salad. The only time I crave greens to this extent is when I can't get them easily. Such is the way of life it seems. We want what we can't have, the forbidden fruit syndrome. Though at this point, I'd take any fruit, forbidden or not. I hold no grudge towards Adam and Eve. Maybe they were just hungry thru-hikers. We smiled our biggest smiles and got a hitch readily. I went into Ingles and walked straight to the salad bar. It was empty. I was aghast. What!? No salad?! Then I remembered I was in a grocery store, and quite capable of collecting ingredients to make my own. I grabbed a bag of Kale and Cabbage mix with nuts and raisins, spicy Honey Mustard dressing, a head of broccoli, and a bag of spinach. Can I steal one of the takeout bowls from the salad bar? I asked the cashier. Honestly, I don't get paid enough to care he replied. Cool, cool, cool. I eagerly combined my eclectic salad ingredients and in my haste, dropped some on the patio table I was eating at in front of Ingles. I ate it. Yes, I know that is horribly unsanitary, yes I know there is a pandemic going on, yes I know I had a whole bowl of salad before me and I wasn't going to miss a few leaves. I know all this and I still ate them. The trail changes people.I got back on trail at 2pm. I was very grateful. I had found some aloe vera in the hiker box to soothe the sunburns on my arms, a fellow hiker had gifted me the last of her sunscreen, and I was chock full of salad and soda. Once again, the day was a bluebird day, full of Spring with the promise of summer. I put a few hours of hiking in before I took a break. Before I left, my dad had given me several bits of advice.Take your shoes off at every opportunity. Thus far, I had been taking it to heart. I took my shoes off and soaked my feet in the nearby creek. Pure bliss.Later in the day, I stopped to watched the sunset, not far from the shelter. I made dinner as it sank below the horizon, leaving reminders of it's glory behind. My food was still too hot to eat, and it was getting chilly, so I walked to the shelter. A fun group of guys were there, chattering up a storm. Most of them had been on the trail for several weeks, taking their time to get their trail legs. It's a very hard jump from the couch to the trail, and I admire the courage and tenacity it takes to start with little to no experience. As we chatted, I glanced at the ridgeline and literally gasped. The sky was magnificent. The color was incredible, and I'm not one to miss a good sunset show. I'm gonna to go catch the last bit of the sunset I announcedYeah! What are we sitting around here for?! One of the guys yelled and dashed after me. I glanced back and had a hard time not laughing. Five guys followed my quick steps to the ridge all in varying states of undress (two shirtless, one shoeless) half of us clutching our pots and trying to eat as we hurried through the gathering twilight.When we returned to the shelter, one guy mentioned that he had seen in the logbook that a bear had been frequenting lately and had stolen other people's food bags. I pitched my tent close to the shelter. I like bears, but I like them in the daytime and at a respectable distance. I'm usually not particularly scared, but for some reason, the idea of a bear coming around wriggled it's way into my mind. The anxiety set in and horrible visages of my bloody carcass after being mauled took over any hope of sleep. I wonder what people will say at my funeral.A twig snapped. I cowered in my sleeping bag, terrified. Was this how it was going to end? Suddenly, a loud, vicious snort emanated close to my tent. I sat bolt upright, clutching my trekking pole, my hair standing on end. I was NOT going to go down without a fight. Another snort. I was ready, I was prepared. Goodbye, cruel world. Another snort, and then, with a shock of profound relief, I discovered it was one of the gentleman in the shelter, putting on one of the oddest snoring performances I had ever heard. Two other snorers soon joined the chorus and the sound was tremendous. No bear would dare to come close to fight the clear alphas. The next morning I was alive and and my bear bag was untouched. I could have shook the snorers hands.","Hostel Around the Bend

It took awhile to get started the next morning. All the guys from the shelter were friendly and fun, and it had been a little bit since I'd engaged in more than some passing remarks with hikers. I set out on the AT hoping for huge swaths of solitude and quiet, since I'm an internal processor and have a lot to process. I suppose I probably should have picked a different trail I'd I wanted to be completely alone. But so far, it has been a good mix of meeting other hikers and hearing pieces of their stories and finding myself alone in the woods, surrounded by the deep stillness and business of a lively forest. 
At the shelter, I posed the question I had been pondering the last few miles, do we create meaning for our lives, or is meaning already out there and we discover it, or is the search for meaning what brings significance? (Or something entirely else?) An intriguing discussion ensued, and I was left with a good variety of perspectives and thoughts to further think about down the trail. I mentioned I have been tracking my mileage in an app called, Walk To Mordor, because the mileage is roughly the same as Sam and Frodo's journey across middle earth. One of the guys enthusiastically suggested I buy a ring pop to carry with me to Katahdin. It's a bit like Frodo, because after awhile the hiker hunger is going to get real and you'll have to resist the temptation to eat the ring. Frodo wasn't tempted to eat the ring of power, exactly, but I got his point and promised I'd buy a ring pop to add to my backpack. 
It was an excellent hiking day, and for the most part, not terribly difficult. About halfway through the day, I decided I wanted to hit the 100mile mark on top of Albert Mountain. For an extra challenge, I decided to aim to get there at 7:30pm. At 6:15pm, I began my ascent. It got progressively harder- the Appalachian Trail was going to make me work to reach the 100mile mark. The last 0.2 was brutal. The minutes ticked rapidly by as I struggled up. 
I miss breathing.
Finally, at 7:28pm, I caught a glimpse of the fire tower. I broke into a clumsy jog, desperation in my eyes, hair flying wildly in the wind, my pack bouncing rhythmically. I run like the winded. I swung around the fire tower and slammed an aggressive fist bump into the ""100 Miles"" etched into the side. Throwing my head back, I broke into the loudest, wild woman howl I could muster. 
When I finished my caterwauling, I looked around. Five very startled faces peered at me from the woods. A group of weekend campers were trying to enjoy the peaceful view.

I shared Long Branch Shelter with a handful of enthusiastic section hikers. One of their group, ""Bob,"" was particularly interested by the idea that I was attempting to hike the Appalachian Trail in it's entirety. He kept asking a litany of questions of which I had no answer, the most frequent being, But.. why?? My why not? wasn't satisfactory. It was his first backpacking trip. The group was two days in, and he wasn't entirely sure he wanted to keep going. It's cool, cool, so awesome he kept repeating while mopping his brow and looking like he thought the experience was a litany of other words, cool not being one of them. He kept offering me various packages of food, of which I happily received. Eventually though, my pack began to take on weight I didn't want to carry, extra calories or not. I grew suspicious You wouldn't be trying to pawn off all your food so you don't have to carry it, are you? I asked laughingBob mopped his brow. Guilty as charged he laughedAnother guy from the group called out, Bob's a lawyer for a reason!It took awhile to leave the shelter.I didn't have far to go, Franklin being my first destination of the day. I decided I had enough nights of miserably shifting from hip to hip, and wanted a sleeping mat that would offer better support. I also really, really, wanted a salad. And a burger. And fries. And a beer. Typical. As I hiked towards Franklin, my stomach began to make obscene suggestions and I wondered if I had consumed bad water. It was possible- I had accidentally messed up my dirty and clean smart water bottles the day before. With each passing mile, my concern and discomfort grew. I left several... forest fertilization deposits.. along the 7mile trek to Winding Stair Gap. When my brain wasn't being consumed with horrifying images of parasites and everything I'd ever heard of the dangers of drinking contaminated water, I also thought back to Bob's question. But.. why? Why was I hiking the AT? What am I doing out here? Granted, I'm not completely sure I'm going to Katahdin, but I don't have any other plans as of right now. But what's my why? I couldn't come up with anything better than my original why not? I like walking. I'm not sure if I'm going to like 2,000miles of it but so far, so good. Why do people do the things they do? Why get married? Why move there? Why spend your time doing that? I listened to a podcast recently with the hosts talking about living a good story. What does it mean to live a good story? Not for other people- you can't live your life for an audience. But what does it mean to live a good story for yourself? How do you infuse your life, your one precious, fragile, and rare life with meaning? I can only answer that for myself, and I'm not sure if I'm able to put it into words for other people to understand. Language, as useful as it is, sometimes fails to encapsulate what someone might know in their body, their soul. I met another hiker near Winding Stair Gap. Hey, what's your why? Why are you hiking the AT? I askedHe paused, and considered. Well, he said slowly, I've always wanted to see Maine.I think that is a good of an answer as any...

Between the impeding storm and steady onslaught of rain (and how cozy I was in my sleeping bag) I decided this was going to be my first zero day. This lasted until 11:30am. A few more groups pulled into the shelter and it began to feel smaller and smaller. The rain and wind and mist were too damn tempting. I wanted to walk. I was vaguely scared of being struck by lightning. Just don't put your poles above your head another hiker suggested helpfullyAs I tend to use my poles for walking, rather than lightening rods, this didn't ease my fears. Still, I waited until there was a slight lull in the rain and made a dash for it. Silar Bald sits a bit back from the trail, so there is a 0.5 trek to the actual AT before your day even really begins. Not terribly far from the shelter, a crack of lightening lit the sky and thunder rumbled. Rather than turn back to the shelter, I quickened my steps. In the moment, my reasoning being the lightening couldn't hit me if I moved fast enough. I understand this is not how the physics of electric storms work, but my sleep deprived brain latched onto the explanation and I hurried along through the woods. Half an hour later, I couldn't find the trail. I had definitely had hiked further than half a mile and by now I should have seen the turn off for the iconic white blazes. Rather, I was scurrying along a trail that was overgrown and barely marked with blue. I took my phone out to study Guthooks. I had missed my turn, but I wasn't too far off. The Blue trail I was on would eventually intersect with the AT again. I was faced with a moment of decision. Was I a purist? Should I turn around and hike back up the mountain to the turn off, or continue on and miss that 1.6mi of the AT?? Another crack of lightening made my decision easier. I hurried onward. Eventually, the rain ceased and a lovely overcast, misty day emerged. My initial goal of just hiking to the next shelter morphed into thinking about hiking to the next one after that... And eventually, the one after that. It was a relief to be out of the sun and in the soothing coolness of the day being overcast. The forest had an eerie, beautiful haunting quality to it. I stopped to admire the moss hanging off of a large tree. It had an Alice in Wonderland quality.About 3miles from my desired location, I stepped on a large, slippery rock. I lost my balance.

I had squeezed into the last sliver of space in the shelter. Most everyone had fallen asleep by the time I hobbled to the shelter, but luckily for me, Squirrel, a section hiker, offered to make room beside her and her husband, Sherpa. They were out for a long section and were planning to spend the next night at the NOC. If you can't find other hikers to split a bunkhouse with, you're welcome to join Sherpa and I Squirrel offered. The next morning dawned bright and clear... Just kidding, it barely dawned. The rain was coming down like it meant business. The Blue trail back to the AT had become a mini river. Most of the other hikers rolled out around 7am. Knowing I only had 6 miles ahead, I decided to wait until at least the thunder and lightening passed. I reached for my pack, where I had accidentally left a ziplock bag of homemade granola. The granola had been motivation over quite a few hills, and I hadn't tired of it yet. I pulled out the bag, and it pathetically crumpled. The mice also had a hankering for granola. They had chewed through a corner of the bag, and had taken all of the good nuts, leaving the unsalted peanuts untouched. Mice, apparently, are granola snobs. The bastards! I exclaimed, shaking my fist at the rafters and laughing. It mattered not. I was six miles from a shower, a bed, and a delicious hot meal that I didn't  have to cook. I mentally started my list of foods I wanted to consume at the restaurant. It was a long list.Squirrel announced there was not just one, but TWO severe weather warnings on the radar. It's supposed to slack off a bit around 10am, she said hopefully, peering at her phone. At 10am, it had not slackened off. If anything, the storm had renewed fervor. The wind whipped and howled, the rain pounded it's heart out, and the lightening flashed and thunder boomed very close by. We might be staying here for awhile, Squirrel said dolefully. Another hiker flew down the hill and into the shelter, water streaming off of him. Bit rainy out there, he drawled. Around 12:30pm, I could stand it no longer. I hadn't heard thunder for awhile, and I won't melt in rain. I bid everyone goodbye, hefted my pack, and headed out. I got up the Blue Trail (why is it always up out of the shelters??) and was about to head down the AT, when a loud crack of thunder sounded directly above.Shit shit shit I hollered and ran back to the relative safety of the shelter. Eventually, there was a bit of a lull in the storm and Sherpa, Squirrel and I set out. Think we'll be struck by lightning? I askedNo. At least, you won't be, said Sherpa. You're the shortest one here!The six miles down to the NOC felt extremely far. Before we even reached the AT, my ankle started protesting, and my other foot joined in. I delicately stepped around the puddles and mini streams, trying to keep my boots dry. Squirrel marched right through. My boots are supposedly waterproof, which really means they are waterproof until they aren't. After about half a mile, I gave up and followed her example and marched right through the puddles. We finally reached the NOC. We chattered excitedly about all the good things we were about to eat. What joy! What fun! Soon we would be dry and have full, happy bellies! Coming to a full stop, I read the sign on the restaurant door, the pain like a dagger to the heart (or stomach).

I did mutter a few under my breath. Despite the fact I had a 7mile somewhat grueling climb, I was ecstatic to be on trail again. One and a half days off had been enough for me to begin to miss it something fierce. My time at the NOC had been great (s/o to all the very cool fellow hikers I met while there!), but I was itching for the woods. A mile in and I began to feel my body relax. I was home. My stomach was uncomfortably, but happily full. Squirrel and I had hitched down to the Ingles in Bryson, where we stocked up on snacks, a lot of supplies for supper and breakfast. We spent a good amount of time in the produce section, drooling over the fresh fruit and vegetables. I want watermelon Squirrel announcedWe found a small container of pre-cut watermelon. I eyed it doubtfully.It doesn't look incredibly fresh Squirrel hesitatedI nodded and added, And it's a little on the small sideWe looked at the container again. Then at each other. Then the container. Just as Squirrel was placing it into the shopping cart, I spied a whole half watermelon tucked away on a corner of the shelf. It was huge. It was glorious! It was only slightly smaller than a regular whole watermelon. We both gasped. Yes! Breathed Squirrel.We would feast tonight.I bought a salad, and salmon, peppers, onions, an apple, two bananas, carrots, kombucha, cookies, chocolate milk, and to finish it off, half of a watermelon. This was all just for supper. When we got back the NOC, Sherpa stared, wide eyed. Perhaps, next time, he hesitated, I suggest you don't shop while hungry!This advice is going to become increasingly difficult the further down the trail I go. Not there yet, but I can imagine a time that my constant state will be one of hunger.I was paying the price of stuffing my face on the way up the mountain from the NOC.

Running Bear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637168,"I had one of the best nights of sleep at Brown Fork Shelter. Finding a place for my tent was difficult, as the ground seemed to impossibly slope in all directions at once. There's nothing quite like starting out on one side of your tent and waking up on the other. The night becomes one long game of ""try to position your body in a way it won't roll."" I lose every time. Even a gentle grade can feel terrifying at 1am when you dream of falling off of a cliff and wake up to realize you are rolling off of your mat and a horrifying vision of you continuing to roll all the way down the mountain flashes through your brain. Not speaking from experience. Obviously. It was one of the best nights of sleep* due to fact I had caved while at the NOC and had replaced my minimalist sleeping mat with the luxurious, air filled, over an inch thick, Big Agnes Sleeping Mat. I now know what sleeping on a cloud feels like. It was the last one they had left on the shelf. It came with a bag for inflation, a small repair kit, and minimal instructions. I eschewed the instructions and discarded than at the NOC before reading them, since I prefer to do things the hard way. Also, they weighed .001 oz, and frankly, I can't afford to carry that kind of weight. The inflator bag attaches on one end to a small valve on the mat. The other end is quite wide (like a grocery bag that has a small hole on the bottom that could be connected to something). I attached the inflator bag, tried to catch air, and rolled it into the sleeping mat, compressing the air and forcing it into the mat. Pathetic. My attempt had barely made a difference. I readjusted a bit, and tried again. Better. Just as I was about to attempt for the third time, one of the section hikers who was camping near the same area, came over and grabbed the inflator bag from my hands. I was too startled to say much of anything. I know, I know, ""Not all men,"" but... I'm just going to say that he fit the stereotype: White, cis gendered male with a cocky air of the world being handed to him on a silver platter. I already vaguely disliked him for making subtly sexist comments about how I needed a man while on the trail (because bears selectively eat females? Maybe?) when I had first arrived at camp.No, no, he said, waving his hand dismissively, not like that. Granted, I admit my first two attempts weren't particularly stunning. I was annoyed how he had just interrupted, but I tried to accept that he might actually have something valuable to teach me. Oh, do you have this type of sleeping mat? I askedNo, I hammock, he responded.He opened the inflator bag, shook it fiercely, and proceeded to roll it, just as I had twice before. The mat did not rise much, but my eyebrow sure did. He shook it again, trying to grab more air, then took a deep breath, blew into the wide open end of the inflator bag, and quickly tried to close and roll it. This attempt was worse than his first, but the image of him quickly sucking in air and puffing it into the wide end of the inflator bag was quite funny. Hm. I said, impishly, laughing, I still don't think I understand how to do that. Perhaps you could show me, I eyed the mat and cocked my head, calculating, another, I don't know, eight to ten more times?? He handed the mat back. It took a couple more tries, but I got the hang of it, and soon the mat was satisfyingly puffy. As I mentioned, it was one of the best nights of sleep.
The walk the next morning to Fontana Dam was pleasant. It was a bit chilly, but I kept a good pace, and stayed warm. I was excited to get to the Marina, because I had heard rumors of a food and beer selection. Also, the Fontana ""Hilton"" shelter had hot showers nearby. Oh, glory! My ankle was a bit stiff, but the pain was manageable, and most of the 12miles gently sloped downward. I flew by some other hikers, eager to sit in the sunshine by the lake and nurse a beer. Maybe they had burgers! What a delightful thought.  
About two miles from the lake, I came across another thru-hiker, slumped with her pack on the side of the trail. Aaagh, she groaned.I stopped, concerned, You okay?I can't believe we're CHOOSING to do this she said. No one's forcing us. Are we crazy?Probably I saidAttempting to inspire some motivation, I waved my phone's Guthooks map in front of her face. We have less than two miles! I said. We can do this. Also, I added, confidentially, the Marina has Gatorade! And Beer! And BURGERS!I wasn't sure about the last part, so I amended, Well, maybe burgers.Oh, she flopped dramatically across her pack, could you do me a favor and bring me a beer? I think I'm going to die here. Right here. This spot. I'm NOT moving. She laughed slightly and added, I checked with all the hostels in the area and they're all full. What I wouldn't give for a bed with clean sheets! Well, I said helpfully, if you do die here, you won't have to walk the last two miles, and I'm pretty sure the morgue has clean sheets!
I got to Fontana a little before 3pm. I promptly went to the Marina. Alas! Sadly, no burgers were forthcoming. I politely suggested to the gentleman behind the counter that might be an improvement to their fine establishment. I got my beer and Gatorade and bag of chips and a piece of cheese the gentleman behind the counter kindly offered and plopped into a deck chair, directly in the sunlight. I had wanted to jump into Fontana Dam lake, but the wind and chilly air dissuaded me of this idea. Still. I thought about it all afternoon. A few other hikers passed through, and each time, I pitched the idea of going for a quick dip. No way! Are you crazy??! Was the typical reply. Finally, just as I was about to leave to walk the final mile to the shelter, two hikers showed up and I once again suggested we jump in the murky lake. Okay! One of the guys responded. I'll do it if you do it!I wasn't prepared for this response.The vague warmth of the disappearing sun no longer seemed sufficient.Aaaah, hm. Well. I hedged, hoping desperately he would back out. He was pulling off his shirt. Damn it. I said. Let's do it. And so we did.
If you ever get the chance to jump into Lake Fontana on an early May day when it's windy and chilly out and you still have another mile to hike before reaching hot showers... Don't.

The Appalachian Trail is unpredictable, with one exception I have thus far identified: there’s a lot of going up. Naturally, you would assume each time you go over a mountain, then yes, you have to go up. Such is the nature of mountains. It makes sense. Up the mountain, then down. Maybe some flat, ah, that’s nice, then another mountain and so on and so forth until Katahdin. This, I naively assumed, was how the A.T. would run its course. 
WRONG. Fool of a Took. 
I am realizing I may have invertedly hiked the “easier” sections of the A.T. prior to starting this thru-hike. Or maybe I blocked the painful memories, idk. I have decided to include a handy guide for any other future hopeful hikers of the pain that awaits their innocent little hearts. 
Hannah’s Guide to Knowing When You’re About to Go Up: 
*disclaimer: what you’re about to read would fail even the sturdiest of hearts. Do not read if you are prone to fainting from gruesome descriptions. Do not read if you cry over those rescue dog shelter ads. Do not read if you are pregnant, as this may cause early induced labor. Do not read if you have a family history of heart failure, you might be next. Do not read if you would like to continue being blithely, blissfully ignorant. Turn back, turn back! Turn back before it’s too late! The ones who quit on the approach trail were our prophets, the harbingers of the doom that awaits.  
If anything has “Gap” in the name, fair warning, you’re about to climb. “Summit,” “Mountain,” “Top,” “View,” “Ridge,” “Blue Trail,” “Parking Lot,” “Road Crossing,” “Beware of Bear..” these are all code names for UP. Lots and lots of up. 
The trail turns left. Up. The trail veers to the right. Up. In a place that it would make sense for the trail to go “straight across the ridgeline?” HAHAHA, yeah no, not for this trail. Ridgelines are for the weak. Ridgelines are for the uninitiated. Ridgelines have no place on a trail determined to squash any hope of reprieve. Hiking the A.T. is how my grandfather used to describe going to school. Barefoot. In the snow. Uphill, both ways.
Want to put in the last couple miles to a shelter? Hope you like gaining elevation. Mountain ahead? Yep. No Mountain ahead? (trick question, there’s always a mountain ahead. Also, it doesn't matter. You’re going up.) You think you’ve reached the summit. FALSE! That’s not the summit, fool. More up. You blink twice. UP. Trail magic ahead? Yeah, as in “the trail magically goes up.” Steep descent? You know what’s coming. Slight descent, the barest drop in elevation? As Sir Isaac Newton grimly intoned, “What goes down, must come up ten, one hundred times full.”* 
I’m willing to bet Katahdin must be closer to the moon than Earth. You know what I miss? Breathing.

Running Bear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637275,"Day 13: Spence Field Shelter to Double Springs GapI was struggling. My legs were tired, but even harder, my mental willpower was tired. Thoughts of quitting the trail flittered through my brain. Overall, it wasn’t necessarily a hard day, but the combination of high mileage, dehydrated food, somewhat uncomfortable sleeping arrangements, and the loneliness of missing my deep friendships from back home, were giving me pause. Did I actually want to go all the way to Katahdin? I wasn’t even at the 200mile mark yet. The thought of the upcoming months and miles were exhausting. The honeymoon phase of the trail was wearing off, and although none of the thoughts of quitting were strong, they were there. I had prepared for this. I reminded myself of my promise. I would allow myself to leave the trail if I had at least a week or 50miles of consistent bad days. I know bad days happen (on and off trail), and a big fear of mine is that 5months of hiking would make me start hating hiking. I was determined not to let that happen. I would rather quit and preserve my love for trails than force myself to finish and never want to hike again. However, I had promised myself that before I made any decisions about quitting, I would take a zero day, eat a lot of food, hike a few more days with low mileage, and see if my outlook changed. I would not quit on a bad day. I was mentally prepared. I reminded myself of this plan, it helped bolster my spirits. I spent time trying to find ten beautiful things along my morning hike, and this helped too. I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to hike the A.T., and by lunch, I was able to retune to this gratefulness. I decided it would be a short day. I stopped for lunch at a shelter and debated if I wanted to call it and spend the night there. Another hiker I had seen several times, bopped up the trail. He even walked like he was happy.Hannah! He yelled, pumping the air with his trekking poles enthusiastically. Just the person! He came and plopped down beside me. Listen, he said, two of us are planning on going to Double Springs Gap Shelter and getting up early in the morning to hike Clingman’s dome to see the sunrise. You in?Isn’t it supposed to rain tomorrow? I asked, amusedYeah, yeah, but it’s always supposed to rain on the A.T. he said flippantlyHm I said. I was vaguely interested. It would mean a longer day, but it appealed to my sense of weird adventure. I’m not much of a morning person, though. Tell you what, he said, I’ll wake you up with a cup of coffee. I’m in I saidYes! I knew it! I knew you seemed crazy enough to agree!Somehow, I mustered the strength to hike the remaining miles, and I proposed the idea of a “sunrise” hike to each hiker I saw along the way. Most of them stared at me, wide eyed. Why would we do that? It’s supposed to rain! I convinced two hikers to join. Two miles before we reached the shelter, it began to rain","Spence Field Shelter
",Double Springs Gap Shelter,"May 09, Sun",13
Running Bear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637277,"A storm raged throughout the night. Misery was a constant companion. The shelter was leaky, and several puddles formed around me. I bundled up in my warmest clothes, but they were no match for the blustery, damp cold. I added my puffy to the mix, stuffing it down my sleeping bag to cover my hips and butt. This was a bit too much, and I alternated between sweating and shaking with cold as I took my puffy in and out of my sleeping bag. Between the thunder rumbling, wind howling, rain pounding, other hikers’ symphony of snores and the knowledge of having to get up at 4:30am to hike… I didn’t get much sleep. I decided I was crazy enough to go try to catch a sunrise, but I was not crazy enough to hike through a storm in the dark to do it. If it hadn’t settled down by the time we were planning on leaving, then I wasn’t going. 
Eventually, the storm passed, the wind died down, and the rain petered out to a fine mist. A thick grey fog rolled in. Just as I was drifting off to dreamland, “Joy Man” poked his head from the top bunk and shined his flashlight directly in my eyes. 
Gooood morning! He chirruped 
I glared at him

Ahrumagh! I mumbled

What’s that? He asked, in a voice cheerier than the situation called for.

It wasn’t English I replied it was grump. Loosely translated to “go away, go away quickly”

I’ll get the coffee he said

All five of us decided to continue to pursue our plan. 
I’ve gotten this far, one guy mumbled, wiping the sleep from his eyes, it seems a pity to waste it. 

We all knew we wouldn’t see much of a sunrise. The fog and misty rain showed no sign of dissipating. After some general grumbling and well directed glares, I was feeling a bit better. The coffee also helped rally me around. I dumped a packet of cocoa into it. Even better. I also knew I would reach Newfound Gap later in the day, where I had parked my car in anticipation of leaving the trail for a wedding. I planned on driving down to Gatlinburg for a resupply and burgers. Since I had walked faster than I had initially thought I would, I still had a few days until I had to get off trail for the wedding. I was going to drive to Standing Bear Hostel, where I would once again park my car and then a friend was coming to drive me back to Newfound Gap. The knowledge that this day held the promise of burgers was very motivational. We left the shelter a little before 5am, with about 3miles of climbing ahead of us. 
I checked Google. The sun, I announced, is supposed to rise at 6:37am. The sun. Yeeeeah. Hm. Maybe. 
Perfect! Joy Man crowed. 
We laughed. There would be no sunrise. 
The hike up was fun. The light crept in slowly, and one by one we extinguished our headlamps. The tall pines stood eerily against the misty sky, and the woods dripped and shivered and smelt amazing. It was beautiful. We arrived at Clingman’s Dome, right before 6:30am. Laughing and bundled against the wind, we turned our faces to the east, the entire vista shrouded in mist. 
Well, I’ll give it to you, Joy Man! I exclaimed This is the best damn sunrise I’ve seen all day!","Double Springs Gap Shelter
",Icewater Springs Shelter,"May 10, Mon",13
Running Bear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637278,"One of the shelters has been closed for some time due to “Aggressive Bear Activity.” Now there’s a combination of words to strike fear into a hiker’s heart! I love black bears, but I prefer to see them at a distance, and I like the non-aggressive types. Black bears are generally skittish animals, and the likelihood of encountering an aggressive one is low. However, they are extraordinarily curious, playful, and have a penchant for food. Really any food, they don’t seem to be particularly picky. They will go out of their way to access said food. Bears and hikers have a lot in common. Bears are often written off as something to be afraid of, but they are very cool animals. Granted, getting between a Mama bear and her cubs is highly unadvisable. If you are so unfortunate, the best thing to do in this situation is make yourself appear larger (this will become harder the closer you get to Katahdin, unless you are one of the few who gain weight on the trail), make a lot of noise, back away slowly (preferably downhill), and very quickly become religious and start praying. Whatever you do, do NOT run, and do NOT pick a fight.  The Mama will win. You will not. This is a fact. If you decide to run, the Mama’s chase instinct might kick in. There’s no need to pretend to be dead, either. This is only if you encounter a grizzly bear. And frankly if you encounter an aggressive grizzly (it’s a grizzly. It’ll be aggressive.) if you should encounter a grizzly and pretend to be dead… well, let’s just say you’ll only be pretending for a while. 
But I’m hiking the A.T. on the East Coast, and grizzlies are not high on my list of concerns. Because of the shelter closure, I was faced with the decision of hiking 12.5 miles or 27. I chose 27. Technically, I didn’t decide to go all 27 miles until I reached Tri-corner shelter, around 2:15pm, 12.5miles in. Or, at least, that’s what I told other hikers, oh, I don’t know, I might shoot for Davenport Gap Shelter… but I’m not deciding until I get to Tri-Corners. But, I knew early on I was going to take the challenge. It had been a few days of “lower” mileage and I was ready for a long day. I was up and ready to go at 8:30am. There was an amazing cloud inversion, and I stopped at Charlies Bunion. It was breathtaking. I spent longer than I had planned there. 
I had wanted to see a bear while in the Smokies, but thus far, had no luck. A good number of other hikers had reported bear sightings, and I was eager for my first along the trail. I was hopeful for today, since it was my last day in the Smokies, I was hiking solo, quickly and quietly. I even breathed a prayer, I want to see a bear today, God.  

I should have given Him specifics. Specifics such as “at a distance” and “during the daylight hours, please” and “make him skittish.” 
I reached Tri-corners at 2:15pm, made an enormous lunch, and announced between mouthfuls that I was going to push on to Davenport Gap. 
That’s another 15 miles, girl! Another hiker shook his head at me. 
It’s actually 14.8 I replied, because .2 obviously makes a difference

Actually, another hiker chimed in, checking Guthooks, it’s 14.6!

I left at 3pm. 
There had been a good amount of descent in the previous 12.4miles, and the upcoming 14.6mi had even more. I was fairly sure I would spend some time hiking in the dark, but figured it wouldn’t be more than a mile or so. I’ve night hiked by myself before, and while I prefer to hike by sunlight, not flashlight, I wasn’t too afraid. Still, I hustled and only took short breaks. By the time the sun completely disappeared, and I clicked on my headlamp, I only had 1.5miles left. The woods are different by night. In some ways, quieter, stiller. There is a peaceful mysteriousness to it. Most woodland creatures (and smart hikers) settle down to sleep, and the trees themselves seem to fold into themselves. The quiet thump of my feet and measured breaths filled the quiet, along with crickets and bullfrogs in the distance, and the slight rustle of leaves from the wind. 
I was trucking along, keeping a good pace, eager to stretch out into my sleeping bag and sleep. My early in the day whispered prayer of wanting to see a bear was largely forgotten, my brain preoccupied with thoughts of sleep and food and philosophy. But mostly sleep and food. About a mile from the shelter, I rounded a corner, my flashlight dimly lighting the loping descent before me. I was trying to keep the light focused a few feet before me, directly on the trail, since there was a good amount of rocks and roots strewn across the path. I had just started playing the game What I Want To Eat in the Next Town, when a tremendous crash startled me. It was roughly 10 feet ahead, and to my right, above me on the bank. My hair stood up on end and all my senses went into high alert. Carefully, I swung my flashlight towards the source of the sound and just as I did, the crashing started up in furious determination. A large, black shape on all fours was moving quickly up the bank. I had seen my black bear. All rational thought left my mind, and I went straight to panic mode. I jumped three feet in the air, my throat inadvertently letting out a loud, guttural yell. I slammed my trekking poles together several times, yelled again, and took off like a bat out of hell. I sprinted down the trail wildly, hollering and clapping the trekking poles together. In the dim light of my flashlight, I leapt over rock and root, desperately forcing my legs to churn faster and faster. What if it was following me!?? What if it was really hungry and wanted to eat me!?? Worse, what if it didn’t eat me, but wanted my food??! Filled with horrifying mental images and panic fueled adrenaline, I covered a half mile faster than I ever had in my life. 
Very slowly, my logical brain started to take over and I forced myself to slow to a quick walk. I slipped into my “crisis counselor mode,” and practiced some breathing techniques I had used with some clients at the shelter. The panic passed and I decided it was more likely I could hurt myself by running and tripping than a bear attacking me. Still, I glanced over my shoulder multiple times for the rest of the half mile to the shelter. I arrived at the shelter, shaking, sweating, eyes still wildly darting around. 
I just saw a bear I said

In the dark?! Omg, what did you do??

It was raining. Again. This is the Appalachian Trail's default mode. Rainy, with a few sunny days thrown in to keep hope alive. Also known as an effective torture technique in Gulag. I used to believe I loved rain, I have an entire five hour Spotify playlist dedicated to my love of rainy days. Rain makes me feel cozy, peaceful and contented. The dictionary of obscure words that don't exist defines ""Pluviophile"" as a deep lover of rainy days. I am a pluviophile. Or, that is, was. I used to even labor under the delusion I loved hiking in the rain. And I did! But then I added a backpack, and had to sleep in a damp sleeping bag and clothes, and things changed. It's like the young newlywed couple who declares their deep love of children... Then they have them. It was a mellow rain, steadily slanting down with no intention of stopping. I had no intention of leaving my cozy sleeping bag. One by one, other hikers left the shelter and trudged out into the weeping woods. I lay wrapped in my bag, debating about what to do with my car. I had parked it at Standing Bear Hostel, which was about three miles ahead. I had planned on driving it ahead to Hot Springs and catching a shuttle back to Standing Bear. However, I knew it had less than a quarter of a tank of gas left, and rumors of the East Coast Gas Shortage had been flying wildly. I wasn't completely sure if these were true, but I didn't have internet access to fact check. Eventually, I slowly rolled out of the warm safety of my sleeping nest, and ambled out into the rain. I decided I would figure out what to do once I reached Standing Bear. Maybe the trail would provide. I was pretty sure I didn't want to stay at Standing Bear- I had heard stories. It was the black hole of thru-hikers. Some went in, but never came out. I had made it fairly close to the road, when I caught up to several gentlemen: two middle aged and one grandpa, section hikers. We chatted for a bit. Suddenly, the middle aged one with glasses announced, we taking a shuttle to Hot Springs. There's room for one more, if you want a ride.Yes! Just my luckWe walked to the Underpass of I-40, and began our wait. Not too long the older gentleman said after an extensive chat on the phone with the shuttle driver. She said she was about to leave. We waited. I munched on snacks and looked at the pictures of the JMT one of the gentleman was showing us. We waited some more. I finished off the snacks. My sweat dried and the temperature seemed to drop. We waited. And waited. And.. waited. My teeth started chattering.I could have walked to Hot Springs by now, the gentleman with glasses grumped. The minutes ticked by. I could no longer feel my fingers. I had just started calculating my chances of dying from hypothermia when the bright blue jeep of our shuttle driver whipped around the corner. All five feet of her bounced from the truck. Hey! She breathlessly said, two decibels higher than necessary. How's it going? My gosh, you all look cold. Holy shit, let me tell you about the drive I just had. Two limbs down, I swear. Wish I had my chainsaw with me, yessiree. Yeah, just squeeze the bags in there, hon. Calf in the road. Had to drop off two Mexicans, didn't speak a lick of english between, my, my. They're putting in a thousand tomatar plants, guess you don't need to speak english for that. Almost hit a deer. Oh, no, honey, don't put your poles there. Man, isn't it just a daggum cold day, hoohee. Sorry about the trash, didn't have time to throw it. Been up since five, and still no time, good lord.This monologue was delivered rapidly and accompanied by many gestures as we piled our packs and selves into her jeep, and she showed no signs of stopping. I would never fault her with lack of things to say. The jeep reminded me of the vehicles of my childhood, held together with duct tape, super glue and fervent hope. Our shuttle driver stomped the gas pedal and we lurched onto the highway. Yeehaw! We're off! Our shuttle driver hollered. Not many people can say yeehaw un-ironically. Not many should. The jeep shuddered in indignation and I shivered with cold. Girl! You're shaking like bacon on a skillet, my lord. No worries, I'm a registered nurse and no one has died yet during my shuttle service, yessiree.I noted the subtle ""yet."" Based on her driving, I wasn't entirely sure if I t was true. We darted in and out of traffic, alternating speeds, veering very close to the shoulder and sometimes straddling both lanes at once. Occasionally, she would get enthusiastic about the subject matter of the... conversation, turn her body towards me, and use her hands to express exuberance. I prefer drivers use their hands for the steering wheel. My hand inched towards the door handle, just in case. Our shuttle driver cranked up the heat and kindly removed her fleece lined and cat hair covered jacket and wrapped it around my shaking shoulders. Oh! You must have animals I said, trying to brush the cat hair now clinging to me in vain .Oh yeah, honey, I got a buttload of 'em.Three goats, twenty chickens, a cow, two cats, a shit excuse for a dog, but I love him, some ducks and I used to have a cute lil'  pig, she rattled off.Aw, what happened to the pig?Freezer.Oh!We're entering Cock county, she announced a little while later, and it lives up to it's name, yessiree. I can bet you know what that means, she winked at me.Uuuh, a lot of people have roosters? I said, hopefully.Yep, that's part of it, but not the part I meant, hehe. But daggum, there's lotta choose from here, yep. This is a full shuttle service here, what's your preference? We got hookers, strippers, liquor, cock fights, weed, and pills. Any peek your interest??Um.. a shower sounds nice I saidWe stopped at a gas station. I turned to look at my riding companions crammed in the backseat.The two middle aged men were stark white. Both also had their door handles locked in death grips. Holy shit, the non glasses gentleman whispered. Think we'll make it there with all our limbs intact? The grandpa was in the middle, fast asleep. I suppose he had already lived a good long life, and was able to nap through anything, maybe even the apocalypse. She hurried back out, waving a candy bar and coffee cup at us furiously. I gotta pump gas, ain't anything in the pumps for miles around, good lord. What a crisis, geez. People will panic buy just about anything.   Glad I get to crap with toilet paper again. Y'all should hustle your butts in and get some food, yep. Never know when your gonna eat good again on the trail or in life. Heck, could be our last meal! It better not be, the gentleman in the glasses whispered. He went inside and got fried chicken, which he shared with us. If it was a last meal, it was a good one.The candy bar and coffee hyped our driver up to a new frenzy, if that was at all possible. I didn't know anyone but auctioneers could fit so many words between breaths. Quite efficient.We entered the skinny back roads of North Carolina, and I tried to not viscerally react each time we zipped around a corner, in the middle of the road, hitting each pothole. Now she only had one hand on the wheel, the other clutched the massive cup of Joe she did not need. I began to play a game of how many words I could get in edgewise, to take my mind off of the terrifying prospect of this being my final ride. My highest count was 9. There's that jackass farm she announced mid monologue about how men were mostly crooks.I choked on my chicken. Pardon?Hehe, lookee there, it's the daggum jackass farm she crowed, laughing. Sure enough, a bunch of donkeys meandered around a field.Finally, we pulled into Hot Springs and she slammed the brakes in front of the Laughing Heart hostel, my home for the night. Yeehaw we've arrived! Think that's a record time for me too, yep. Gotta go say hi, let me know if you ever need a shuttle. Tell your friends too, gotta pay the bills. But I might not be doing shuttles for the next few days, with the daggum gas crisis.I thought that was an excellent idea. Maybe the crisis could even continue beyond a few days. The Lord works in mysterious ways.We shakily piled out of the jeep. I resisted the urge to kiss the ground. Sweet, sweet earth. I was glad I would be walking for the next two days.Yessiree, I am daggum glad to be walking.  Yeehaw. ","Davenport Gap Shelter

Running Bear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637347,"After arriving at the Laughing Heart, taking a shower, and washing my suspiciously smelling clothes, I was ready for food. Not surprisingly, my stomach demanded a burger and salad, and I trekked down to Hot Springs to fulfill it’s wishes. I stopped at the Hillbilly general store for a resupply first. While there, I noticed a fridge full of fresh meat and another of vegetables. Rather than patronage a local establishment, I decided to make my own dinner. 
Back at the hostel, I dumped my goods on the small kitchen counter. I rounded the meat into a thick patty. I looked around for the stove and realized my first mistake. There was none. Rather than a stove, there was a small camping double burner, on which only one burner worked. I use “work” in the loose meaning of the word. Even turned on high, it only let out vague heat. My burger would be cooked by next Monday. Another hiker noted my frustration (and determination).
Hey! He said, I’m going to go cook ribs on the grill, there’s space if you want to drop your burger on it!
Glory. 
I have never used a grill, but figured it couldn’t be worse than staring dismally at my very, very, slow cooking burger. I dropped the ginormous burger on the grill. Immediately, flames jumped up to greet it. Excellent. I ran back into the hostel, and began chopping vegetables for a massive salad. Someone handed me a beer. I started chatting with other thru-hikers, and completely forgot about my forlorn burger on the grill. Completely forgot. 
Hannah, Hannah! The guy who had lit the grill for me rushed in breathlessly. You might want to go grab your burger… it’s definitely done. 
I ran outside. It was more than done. It was a blackened shell of its former glory. The shape and size and hardness was reminiscent of a hockey puck. I deeply hoped a massive amount of ketchup would remedy the situation. It didn’t. I wasn’t dismayed, I still had some meat left. I rounded out the leftover meat into a much smaller, but still decent, patty. Once again, I dropped it on the grill, and went back inside. My salad was getting bigger, and I had to transfer it into another bowl. I was halfway through the beer and engaged in entertaining a few tipsy and high thru-hikers, when I suddenly remembered. 
Oh no! My burger!!
I raced outside. The front porch was enveloped in a haze, and the few thru hikers sitting nearby were coughing and waving their hands in front of their face. Dark smoke billowed out from the grill. I yanked the cover up and jumped back from the flames dancing up. My burger, if it can be called that, had shriveled into a sad, dark lump. I grabbed the longest tongs I could find and plucked it from its fiery doom, before quickly shutting the lid. 
Hey girl, I think you killed that cow three times over, a thru hiker called.
If you’re trying to burn the hostel down, there’s better ways of doing it, another hiker laughed. 
I hurried shamefacedly from the scene of the crime. 
Later in the evening, several hikers decided to cook a community meal of spaghetti. 
I can help I offered
Oh, no. No, no, I think we have it well in hand, they quickly replied. 
We saw the burger, another confided. 
The next morning, I was determined to restore my reputation. I mixed up pancake batter, and babysat the slow cooking burner. They were quite good- light, fluffy, and full of flavor. Unlike my father, I had not included any mysterious ingredients, settling on a combination of apples and strawberries. I offered them to thru hikers milling through the hostel. They quickly declined. 
Oh, no, I’m gluten intolerant, one voiced, although I was fairly sure he had consumed two pieces of garlic bread the night before. 
I never.. eat before 10am, one supplied, avoiding my eyes. 
I’m.. allergic to pancakes? 
One more hiker walked in. 
I’ll eat some, he bravely said. 
He doused the stack with maple syrup. We leaned in, waiting. Slowly, he cut a tiny piece and raised it to his mouth. We held our breath. He chewed. Swallowed. 
Oh! Actually, these are quite good! He exclaimed with relief. He finished the stack. 
My reputation was restored.
My heart was set on seeing the sunset from Max Patch, approximately 19 miles south of Hot Springs. I briefly consulted Guthooks, and was delighted to discover the elevation profile was better for those heading southbound. I checked it again after a long climb out of Hot Springs that seemed rather… well, long and steep, and not full of the descent Guthooks had promised. I quickly realized my mistake. I had forgotten to switch the mode to SOBO. Sure enough, heading south towards Max Patch had an elevation GAIN of more than 5,000, not a loss.

Max Patch is more than beautiful. It provides the kind of beauty that hurts, brings unbidden tears, and heals the soul. From the top of the bald, the 360 vista captures the imagination and even the great poets would not be able to completely encapsulate it's subtle and enduring grandeur. But I only briefly glanced at all of this, because I really, really needed to pee. I'm not completely a prude, and I'm not above quickly changing clothes in public bathrooms, but peeing in a large mountain top field with other hikers milling around is not my idea of a good time. I don't want to provide a full moon on a starry night, if you know what I mean. I hustled down the slope, towards the side of the bald. It drops quite suddenly, and the side of the hill offers a bit more privacy. I could have gone another 0.1mi to the sparse woods, but the few liters of water sloshing in my stomach demanded otherwise. I glanced around and like an ostrich with it's head in the sand, figured since I couldn't see anyone from my vantage point, they couldn't see me. I'm accustomed to watering trees, and honestly don't think twice about it. But I discovered its different practicing the same activity on an open plain. If you've ever muttered hurry, hurry, hurry to yourself while trying to rapidly reduce the amount of fluids in your body, you might understand what I'm talking about. I was mid stream, when I looked up to the top of the bald and discovered, to my horror, the trail curved slightly around before continuing to the other side. I only discovered this, because a hiker was rounding the corner and looked directly at me. I was far enough away that there is a small window of hope he could have mistaken my tending to my business as just a hiker choosing an odd place to stretch. But if not, and if you, dear reader, were the hiker trying to enjoy the view of the left side of Max Patch on May 14th around 6:47pm... well, I sincerely apologize. I just really, really needed to pee.The sunset was glorious.   love sunsets. Each one has its own unique touch, and I swear each one is the prettiest I've seen (and each time it's 100% true.) I've been blessed to witness many sunsets this far on the trail, but the Max Patch one was particularly spectacular. The sun departed from the sky in a blaze of crimson and fiery yellow glory, giving the final gentle kiss of daylight. The sky blushed in return, with streaks of pinks and reds. The clouds were tinged golden and the sky swirled with multiple blues. The mountains joined with hues of blue and green and deepening purple. In the west, a few stars peeked out, breathlessly waiting their cue. Picasso and Van Gogh couldn't have dreamed a sweeter or more glorious scene. I alternated between delighted squealing and jumping, trying to snap pictures, and just staring in wide eyed wonder. I fell asleep later, brimming with bliss and gratefulness. Thankful for all I had witnessed so far, and hopes for the future. I am deeply humbled and grateful to be able to call the woods my home for now.The sweet bliss lasted well into the next day, capped with another bear sighting. A mama and her cub cautiously walked across the trail and up the ridge, the mama eyeing me curiously. I waited until they had meandered on, before heading the last mile into Standing Bear. I was determined not to live up to my trail name this time.","Max Patch

One of my sisters dropped me off near the river in Hot Springs Monday night, after we had eaten as much as our budgets allowed at the Iron Horse. Our stomachs said more, please, but our wallets said no, so we scraped our plates clean and left. We were both eager to be back on trail- she is also thru-hiking this year and had taken some time off to nurse an injury. The next morning, she would be picking up where she left off, several hundred miles ahead of me. We traded trail stories of miseries and mishaps, compared general body pains, aches and blisters, and in all, were very happy. I asked her what the trail was like ahead. 
Oh, you know, she laughed, there's trees and mountains, it rains a lot and goes more up than down. 
Sounds about right.
After I had merrily waved her off, I dug around in my pack for my headlamp. The sun had long set, and I would be hiking just about a quarter mile down the trail to where we had previously pitched my tent. I couldn't find it. I looked in the usual places I stash it, and chided myself for not being more organized yet. I still couldn't find it. I began to look in all of the various pockets and unusual places, but no headlamp availed itself to my search. After the last harrowing experience of hiking in the dark with a dim flashlight, I wasn't thrilled with the idea of walking with no light at all. I dumped out all of the contents of my pack.
No flashlight. Shit. 
My phone's battery was close to drained, but I walked as quickly as I could using it's flashlight. I reached camp just as it reached 0%. I had finished setting up the tent earlier, but had abandoned everything else in favor of food. I regretted my wild, heedless ways of three hours earlier. Ah, the naivete! I was now older and wiser and a fair amount grumpier. In the pale light of moon and stars, I found my sleeping bag and mat. I caught the air with my inflator bag and pumped it tiredly, counting under my breath each time. It generally takes between 8-10 times, depending on how firm I want it. I suddenly realized I had counted to 12, and the mat was suspiciously only half inflated. I began to pump it with more gusto. This time, I made it to 20. The mat sighed in defeat and remained at half mast. I sat back on my heels in disbelief. I had just purchased the mat not too long ago, and now clearly had a decent leak. I wasn't sure how to fix the problem in the deep darkness, so I resigned myself to sleeping on the hard ground for the first night back on trail. I fumbled around and located the release valve to deflate the mat. 
I started laughing. It was already open. I had discovered my ""leak.""

Running Bear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638259,"Day 22: Hot Springs to Spring Mtn Shelter
The mice on the A.T. are a general nuisance, but I now believe they are specifically targeting me. 
Mice and I go way back.
For some reason, during the winter of 1999, my childhood home had a serious mouse invasion. Perhaps it was particularly cold and they were just seeking shelter, perhaps it was too tempting a home since with so many young children there was often runaway crumbs under the cupboards. The series of petty burglaries and sightings and ""surprise chocolate sprinkles"" they left in their late night parties were frustrating for my father. He bought an armload of mouse traps and determinedly set them out, much to my tender heart's horror. The war between my father and the mice lasted well into the spring. He was winning, but a few of the mice were quite canny and continued to outwit him, stealing the peanut butter and cheese from the traps without setting them off and laughing behind his back. I secretly cheered each time a trap was empty in the morning. I was on the side of the mice. 
I was on their side, but preferred they keep their distance. A lot of distance. I was awed and terrified of them.
I was at the tender age of 4 years old. My parents were cruel and trying to ""instill character"" by forcing me to sweep the kitchen floor. Free child labor. I was procrastinating, in typical Hannah Vickery fashion, determined to make my sippy cup of milk last as long as possible. I was sitting on the stool, swinging my legs and alternating slow sips and staring longingly out the window at the inviting trees begging me to climb them. My siblings were in the living room, and their happy chatter floated through the kitchen. I sighed deeply. I alone had a chore. I was quite content in my misery. A soft scratching noise caught my attention. My ears perked. I pulled my legs up onto the stool and cautiously peeked down and scanned the kitchen. There was nothing. I chuckled nervously, and returned to my slow sipping. I convinced myself it was just my imagination. I eased off the stool, and lazily dragged the broom across the floor. My eye caught a glimpse of movement and a flash of a small gray fur behind the fridge. I froze. I was trapped in the middle of the kitchen, too far from the stool to seek it's safety. I clutched my sippy cup and broom, my only forms of self defense. My pulse raced. A mouse meandered out from behind the fridge, delighted with the unswept floor with it's feast of crumbs. Suddenly, it turned it's head and noticed me for the first time. We locked eyes. 
We both screamed. 
I threw the broom and sippy cup of milk in it's direction and ran shrieking out of the kitchen. My older sister was convinced my tear streaked face and incoherent babbling meant there was a fire, (we had just practiced family fire drills earlier in the week) and promptly escorted all of us onto the front porch, where we all stood, shivering and snivelling, in our sock clad feet, in the rain.
Flash forward 20 years or so, and I had been in Vermont for a year. I landed a sweet house sitting gig for the winter. Six months, and instead of paying rent, I got paid to live by myself and water a bunch of indoor plants. It was a lovely older farmhouse, surrounded by pines and willows, with a wide front porch and a lantern lit walkway. Mid winter, the sloping roof and pine boughs were laden with snow and the chimney cheerfully smoked. It was the quintessential Vermont postcard. 
It also came with a resident mouse. 
I loathed the idea of killing Freddie (yes, of course I named him), but wanted to be a good house sitter. We made a pact that as long as he didn't leave evidence of his presence, I'd pretend he didn't exist until Spring, when he would be evicted. Occasionally during the quiet evenings throughout the winter, I saw him, but for the most part, he stuck to his end of the bargain. 
The owners called, and before hanging up, asked if I had any mice problems. Uuuuuh... well I hedged it's an old farmhouse, I'm sure there's bound to be one or two.They informed me of the rat poison, located in the basement. I told them I had it well in hand. I didn't tell them I would never use the rat poison.
March came, and it was t-minus one month until the house owners arrived and expected to return to a mouse free home. Freddie wouldn't leave. I tried the catch and release traps, luring him in with peanut butter, cheese, and even leftover homemade chocolate chip cookies. He didn't take the bait. Rather, he got more bolder, daring now to run across the middle of the floor, leave chocolate-but-not-chocolate sprinkles on the counter, and once even dug into my food supplies, where I found him the next morning when I poured some cereal and got quite the shock. I moved the traps to different locations, put more food in and got more desperate. The days where rapidly ticking away. He was wicked smart, managing to snag most of the food but escaping the traps. I caved. I bought several kill traps, and set them out. Freddie was again in the winning. I became increasingly frustrated. 
Four days before April 1st, I was reading near the woodstove, when Freddie popped up out of the couch cushions near me and casually sauntered across the floor towards the kitchen. 
I set out the rat poison that night. 
Around 2am, I woke up, wracked with guilt. How could I?! I raced to the kitchen, intending to dispose of the poison. I determined I would just have to explain to the owners that Freddie was their newest roommate. Maybe he'd get a job and help with rent. I stopped short, horrified. All of the poison was gone, but the trap was empty. I bawled.
Rat poison prevents the blood from clotting, killing the rodent from internal bleeding over the course of 4-6 days. This is what Google informed me, while I was sitting on the kitchen floor, crying my eyes out. I was a mouse murderer. (I'm still sorry, Freddie)
Now I believe the mice of the A.T. have a vendetta against me. They are avenging their brother's blood. I didn't mind when they ran across my sleeping bag several times in the Silar Bald shelter. I was slightly annoyed when they slyly ate all the good parts of my granola in Wesser Bald shelter, but this is forgiveable. Even when a few (or one very ambitious one) pooped in my stuff sack and in my backpack and all around my sleeping bag at another shelter... I found it in my heart to extend grace. 
However. I had slowly hiked just over 10 miles out of Hot Springs, laden with a heavy pack and my stomach filled with three square meals. I was hot, tired, and grumpy. I arrived at the shelter after the sun had set, and was too lazy to pitch my tent. I rubbed Shea butter into my aching feet and sat on the edge of the picnic table, chatting with some fellow thru-hikers I hadn't seen in a couple weeks. Suddenly, several sharp teeth clamped down on my pinkie finger. Aaaaarrrgh!!! I yelled. I jumped up and flung a small, furry shape away from me. A mouse just, just... BIT ME! The rest of the table looked at me with wide eyes. I swung the light of my (new! brighter!) headlamp, and sure enough, a mouse sauntered from under the picnic table towards the shelter. I swear he was laughing. 
I pitched my tent in the dark.

I had spent considerable time in Hot Springs, mainly to try to squeeze in as many meals as my stomach could handle. I also charged my phone, bought a headlamp, and read in the library for a bit. I miss books. I have a Kindle, but it's not the same. I miss the feel of a hardcover book in hand, the quiet rustle of pages turning, the soothing smell of paper. I miss books, but not enough to carry one on the  A.T. with me! I met a lady early on, and she was lugging, not one, not two, but three books with her! I wonder if she was trying to read them all at the same time.When I was preparing for the trail, I firmly decided I wasn't going to be someone who quibbles over a few ounces. Granted, I wanted my pack weight to be relatively low, but I refused to cut the handle off of my toothbrush. I like the handle, it's very.. handy. I know the ultra lite community is right in many ways, and there are definite advantages to carrying less weight. It can be fun to par down on gear and figure the ratio of durability to lightness. What is the best tent? Backpack? Sleeping bag? It probably mostly comes down to preference. What do you want in a tent? What aspects are important to you? The clichè ""Hike your own hike"" rings true in this arena. There's a lot of gear, and thrice as many opinions. Perhaps a bit corny, but your hike, just like your life, is your own. You get to decide how you want to spend it or how much weight you want to carry. And all the opinions of others are ultimately just that. Opinions. And, it is my opinion, that books, no matter how dear they are to my heart, are simply not worth the weight. Food, on the other hand... While waiting for my stomach to settle from second breakfast, I strolled to the Dollar Store, my heart set on chocolate milk and maybe a small bag of M&Ms. A very small bag, I firmly told myself. I was already carrying a decent resupply. But oh! The candy aisle! The glorious, wonderous, candy aisle! It was fully stocked. Shelves from floor to ceiling lured me in with their attractive displays. There were chocolates and chocolate covered things, white chocolate and dark chocolate and milk chocolate and foreign chocolate! There was caramels and toffees, Twinkies and hard candies wrapped in bright cellophane. There were sweeties I didn't previously know existed. I was surprised not to see just packets of straight sugar to snort. I was Hansel and Gretel, I was an oompa loompa set loose in a cocoa bean haven, I was all the children who can't understand why not to take candy from strangers in mysterious white Vans (don't do it, kids.) I danced down the aisle, leaping and twirling, throwing candy into my cart with squeals of delight. At the end of the aisle, I came to my senses, and slowly backed the cart up and replaced each beguiling package. Well, almost all. I kept the gummy worms. I looked around and found the small packets of M&Ms. They looked awfully small. I searched for a medium bag. This too looked awfully small. Suddenly, I spied it! THE FAMILY SIZED BAG OF PEANUT BUTTER M&MS! The bag had a label that states, ""For sharing."" Ha! That's not likely, I hefted the close to 2lbs bag off the shelf and into my cart and hurried to the checkout line before I had the chance to make a logical decision. I proudly displayed my purchase to another hiker with whom I was getting pre-lunch. That's rather... he hesitated.. large. Looks pretty heavy. Set on the picnic table in the light of the sun, it had seemed to grow. I forced a chuckle. It'll be fine, I shrugged. I love peanut butter M&Ms, it won't last long. Still, I munched on several handfuls and encouraged the two other hikers with me to also dig in.After lunch, I tried to stuff the package into my food bag. It wouldn't fit. I felt a prickle of worry. I added it to my clothes bag. Getting rid of it while in town was not an option. I had gotten this far, it seemed a pity to waste it. The climb out of Hot Springs was ridiculously difficult. I ate peanut butter M&Ms with breakfast, lunch, dinner and several snacks. Two days later, and I still had 2/3 of the bag left. I had eaten my fill of peanut butter M&Ms. I started bringing it by shelters and pleading with other hikers to eat them. I started protylitizing and became a candy pusher. One handful? That's it?? Please take two! Take some for later, take some for your friends!Most thru-hikers obliged. It took 3 days to get through the entire bag. ","Spring Mtn Shelter

Punctuality and early morning starts are not my strong suit. A group of hikers were getting off trail to head towards Ashville for a zero day and backyard BBQ. They invited me along. Okay, okay, I mostly invited myself along, but they were down for it. So far, I haven't joined a trail family. I tend to prefer walking in silence and solitude, and my speed and miles vary greatly depending on the day. Also, I have to get off trail four times (three weddings and a middle school girls camp) and trying to coordinate with others seems like a bit of a headache. I know a lot of former thruhikers say the people were the best part of their hike. Part of me wants to experience that, but while I've meet many other awesome thruhikers, thus far I haven't wanted to alter my hike to join a group. Instead, I hang with different trail families for a day or two, and invite myself to their BBQs. It's a good time. The southern heat was beginning to set in, and it only took several miles before my back was drenched in sweat. I began to daydream about jumping into a lake, river, creek, or frankly, a puddle. As I got closer to Spivey Gap, the place we were getting off for Ashville, I began to debate other plans. Rather than getting off, I could put in several extra miles and get to Erwin the next day. My legs felt strong and I didn't want to take a zero if I didn't need to. By the time I got to the gap, my mind was made up. I'd continue on. I figured I'd only have to hike a mile or two in the dark to get to the unofficial campsite in a meadow.I was mostly happy about this decision, but part of me lamented missing out on BBQ. It was the stomach part of me. ","Jerry's Cabin Shelter

To quote my sister, ""Updating my trail journal is harder than thru hiking the Appalachian Trail.""Facts. I'm currently off trail again, for the third and final wedding. If any more friends decide to tie the knot, they better wait until after Oct. 15th if they so desire my presence. I am getting off again mid June to help run a middle school girls camp, and then I am planning to get on trail and stay on until Maine.
I woke up surprisingly early, and was able to watch the sunrise. It graced the meadow with warm light and my usual morning grumpiness was assuaged. A couple section hikers new to backpacking had camped nearby, and they regaled me with their tales of woe and mishaps. A general tip for backpackers everywhere: bring TP. And if you decide not to, because you have aspirations to be more ""natural"" or ""connect more with nature"" (figuratively and literally), know the plants before you go. Leaves of three, let them be. 
They were also headed to Erwin, but were planning on taking two days. The idea of a shower and food I didn't have to cook on my stove was alluring, and I decided to aim for Uncle Johnny's that night and take a nero the next day. There were several mountain balds and meadows to cross, and as the day wore on and temperature rose, the idea of jumping in the Nolichucky river became increasingly appealing. 
I stopped at Big Bald shelter for a quick snack, which turned into 2nd breakfast and pre lunch. I was quite determined to finish as much food as I could before reaching Erwin, and I made excellent progress towards that goal. Access to a privy is the main reason I often stop at shelters for meals. I have no qualms fertilizing the forest, but digging catholes can be time consuming and annoying. I want to be a good steward and practicer of LNT principles, but I didn't bring a trowel. Instead, I have to use sharp stones or sticks to scrabble out a six inch hole, and when the urge to go hits, this is highly inconvenient. Privies are very smelly and somewhat gross, but if it saves me from having to dig in the dirt... I'll take it. After consuming an astonishing amount of my food bag, I needed to go. And I needed to go NOW. I quickly made my way to the privy. I could smell it before I reached it. There will never be a privy scented candle at Bed Bath & Beyond, but this privy went above and beyond in spreading it's charming aroma wafting through the woods. I gagged slightly. Still. A privy is a privy. I clutched my TP and hand sanitizer firmly and bravely marched forward. Inside, the odor moved from unpleasant to noxious. I half expected to find a rotting corpse sitting on the throne. Nauseating fumes rose and more than a few flies buzzed about. I questioned my sanity, and opened the lid. 
Words are futile.
If you combine the smog of a paper factory, several day old roadkill carcases, and burning sulfer, you might get a vague idea of the atrocity. An entire brotherhood of flies swarmed about what I can only describe as a mini mountain of poo. There should have been the Dante's dire warning, ""Abandon hope, all ye who enter here"" inscribed over door. I'm convinced this was a portal to hell.

I got to Uncle Johnny's just as the sun was setting. The mostly young pine forest was bathed in golden light the last couple miles and the air cooled significantly. Between 4pm and 8pm is my absolutely favorite time to hike. The woods always feels more inviting and magical. It is in these hours my legs tend to feel the strongest, my body most at peace. Some of the best thinking and hiking happens in the golden, enchanted hours before the sun makes it's dramatic exit from the sky. 
However, this evening, I was massively grumpy.  A new blister had formed, and although it was small and relatively not causing too much discomfort, I was infuriated. The last couple or so miles nobo into Erwin are gravely and gradually sloped. My feet protested against the consistent down and small, sharp rocks. I caught my first glimpse of the river, and felt relief, until I checked Guthooks and realized I still had a good number of switchbacks left. Each time the trail turned I became slightly more irritated. I wasn't even trying to enjoy the beauty surrounding me. 
When I finally made it to Uncle Johnny's, I collapsed on the porch floor, not bothering to remove my pack first. A large trail family crammed onto the porch, and their happy chatter helped ease some of my irritation. One of the guys caught one look at my face and announced, I'm going to make you a smoothie. 
I wasn't sure how he was going to perform the miracle of making me a smoothie without a blender. I thought perhaps he might stomp strawberries with his thru-hiker toes, which is equally disgusting and intriguing, but at the moment, I didn't care. A smoothie sounded amazing, and I would ask not how the sausages were made. To my amazement, he pulled a blender from his pack and five minutes later, I had a banana strawberry blueberry smoothie in my hands. 
I was touched. I have no shame admitting a few tears also got mixed in.
The next day, I convinced a few fellow thru-hikers to jump into the river with me. It was comparatively warm, if it was compared with an ice bath in Antarctica during the winter. After the initial shock though, it was quite refreshing and invigorating. I immediately took a hot shower afterwards. I was planning on hiking the 4 something miles to the next shelter later in the afternoon, so I spent a good amount of time simply lounging around the hostel, reading, and eating copious amounts of food. Just as I was beginning to pack up to leave, several members of the smoothie making trail family invited me to come tubing with them. It sounded tempting. I don't know, I hedged, I really want to get those four miles in today. Aaah, what about smiles before miles? It'll be fun! Make memories, yada yada yadaI didn't need too much convincing. 
The tubes arrived later than anticipated, and 15 of us crowded into a 12 passenger van around 6pm. We were dropped off about two miles up river. Most of the group decided to tie their tubes together, and float down en masse. I declined. The Nolichucky river has some decent rapids, but nothing too terrifying. Still. If there are rapids involved, I prefer to not be tied to a bunch of other tubes. If one goes down, they all go down. The float was wicked fun, and I only almost fell off once. I was completely soaked by the time I made it back to the landing at the hostel. I ran up the bank, dried off as much as I could with a towel, threw on my pack, and hustled to the trail. My grumpiness from yesterday had completely vanished, washed away by the river and hot shower. I had enjoyed my time in Erwin, but as I hiked quickly into the trees and gathering darkness, my body relaxed into a rhythm.

Running Bear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639099,"Day 28: Old Apple Orchard to Jane Bald
The old Apple Orchard was a lovely place to camp. It was a gently sloping field, with tall soft grass, with a small grove of apple trees gnarled with age. There were several decent, fairly flat tent sites although I did discover fairly flat is not equal to flat. The night invited several readjustments to my sleeping bag and sundry. A small group of us gathered around the fire ring and we alternated between offering encouragement and advice to one of the hikers building his very first fire. We cheered when a flame bravely lit under his considerable care.
I'm not sure if I can pinpoint what exactly made the night magical, but the fire crackled merrily, the stars glittered, fireflies danced and the company was equally hilarious and delightful. Perhaps most magical though, was the enormous amount of food I happily consumed. I only had two more days on trail before getting off at 19E for another wedding, and my food bag contained enough for at least three days. Or, that is, it did. I ate until my stomach protested and I finally finished off my feast with flourish. (Please notice the attempt at alliteration and praise me.) My food bag was noticably lighter, and I felt considerably heavier. An excellent turn, in my opinion. I crawled into my sleeping bag and relished in the sweet, contented coziness of a full stomach and a fuller heart. 
The next morning, the fuller heart was still resting in contentment, but the full stomach did not want to remain that way. The sins of yesterday's gluttony wanted recompense and demanded full retribution. I needed to poop. Perhaps I talk too much about poop for polite society. I don't know. I like talking about it, I find it funny. I share the humor of a middle school boy. But I also like talking about it because it's a bit exposing. There's an element of shame to in the act of relieving oneself, especially amongst women. Yet in reality, it's quite a wonderous thing! How good of our bodies to not hold onto what we don't need. Pooping is very human. And I think talking about it helps expose part of my own humanity. People can laugh and relate and there's something incredibly profound in people connecting on something that is part of our mundane daily rhythms (or bi-daily. whatever. If it's been more than a week, go see a doctor). It's also the great equalizer. Vladimir Putin poops. Jesus pooped. Your next door neighbor poops. And on this morning, I desperately, desperately needed to poop.
Unfortunately, fields tend to offer little in way of privacy. And although I have no qualms detailing my odd encounters of disposing bodily waste, I do maintain a sense of propriety. The closest wooded areas were at the bottom and top of the slope. The bottom offered thicker coverage, but the proximity to the water source meant practicing LNT and chosing the woods on top of the field. Two slight issues concerned me, one being the sparse look of the woods and secondly the trail running the length of the top of the field. However, due to the increasingly dire situation, I decided I'd have to risk it. I was pleasantly surprised to find a conveniently large log a bit off trail that provided sufficient coverage. I dug a cathole and well fertilized the woods, so to speak. Just as I was finishing, two day hikers emerged from the forest and meandered towards my log. I wouldn't be able to stand up without being caught, so I remained squatting and hoped they'd hurry through the meadow. 
They didn't. They walked with the slow pace of not being worried about whether or not they could make it to Katahdin on time. They paused to enjoy nature, breath in the smells, and smile at the field. Honestly, how rude. I gritted my teeth and silently pleaded with them to hurry. My legs were beginning to shake. They stopped, close to where I crouched beyond them in the woods, and pulled out a camera. Oh, no. No, no, no. Now, before you judge me (and perhaps you already are), try dropping into a squat and holding it steady for a good five to six minutes. While they chattered and took pictures of the old Apple Orchard (which, was pretty, but honestly not pretty enough for the amount of pictures they were taking), I made an awful decision. 
I stood up. Quick as a wink, I yanked up my shorts, just in time as the couple turned around, startled by the sudden noise. We silently stared at each other. There was no use attempting to disguise what I had been doing, I was clutching a giant roll of Toilet paper. I grinned sheepishly. Lovely weather for a walk, I called. They nodded. I waited a beat. Well, uh, have a nice day. They nodded again, and the lady squeaked, yeah, you too, before they turned and hurried back up the trail from hence they came. I was a little salty. Apparently, they could hike fast when they wanted to. ","Old Apple Orchard

I haven't eaten pizza in over three years. Well, almost, anyway. I occasionally have a bite or two, and I had a small slice a couple weeks ago. But I would never intentionally order it or go out of my way to get some and I certainly don't have cravings for it.
I don't like pizza. 
It's fine, it's fine, I know many of you are recoiling in horror right now. Just like any other average American, I used to like it, love it, gaze at it with star struck eyes, but a few years of being a ""poor"" college student cured me of that. To help save money and satiate my stomach's growling, I attended every event on campus that promised free food. And what did these events offer in way of free food?? Exactly. Now if I was trapped on a deserted island with nothing to eat but slugs and pizza... I'm just saying, let me know if you have any of your grandmother's old recipes for slug stew, k? To be fair, I'm also fairly sure I'm lactose sensitive, since each time I consume dairy products, sends internal hazard warnings to my brain, and I have a particularly forceful tailwind. And since pizza has a LOT of cheese, I quake to think of the potential consequences.This is rather inconvenient as a thru hiker, since pizza is an excellent source of hot, quick, and relatively affordable calories. Almost every hostel has a freezer stocked, and other thruhikers' eyes gleam when they hear a pizza joint is in the next town. (Not I, as I am better than them and have more refined tastes. Just kidding.) 
Anyway. 
I was hiking close to the same mileage as six other thruhikers, and we started meeting for lunches and camping in the same spots together. We knew it wouldn't last long, one of the guys had a somewhat faster clip and wanted to move ahead, one couple was debating on hiking less miles due to some injuries, and I had to get off trail for another wedding. However, we vibed well as a group, and we enjoyed being a semi trail crew for a few days. I had decided to get off at a road crossing near the Station at 19E and Mountain Harbour hostel. We all started hiking fairly early in the morning, and for the first time since getting on trail, I decided to actually hike with other people. We put in the 13miles to the road crossing by 2pm, and four of the guys decided to wait with me at Mountain Harbour hostel for my brother who would pick me up at 4pm. My brother called and offered to take them and I to town so we could get something to eat before shuttling them back to the trail. 
A thru-hiker never (or hardly ever) turns down the offer of a free shuttle to town for something to eat. For two hours, we eagerly talked about the food we would consume and scoured Google for suggestions of local eaterys. Somehow, they all became obsessed with the idea of getting pizza and their eyes lit up with wonder as they each described in intense detail what toppings they wanted on it. One of the guys even shed a tear. At this precise moment, I realized the trail had changed me. Rather than recoiling in horror at the thought of a sauce and excessively cheese topped bread, my stomach made the tiniest, slightest, barely imperceptible growl. Could I... could I possibly be... craving pizza? Pizza? The food that on my graduation day I swore I'd never consume again? Granted, I preferred (and still do) other foods, such as burgers and salads (bit predictable craving thus far), but I wasn't completely opposed to the idea of pizza. What a wild, crazy world. 
My brother rolled in around 4pm, and we piled in, our own version of clowns in a car. I ordered the medium vegetarian option, with less cheese and more vegetables. And you know what? I ate every. single. damn. bite.  And I didn't even mind farts.","Jane Bald

Running Bear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640712,"Day 34: Lee Gap to Dragon Tooth parking lot
Originally I had planned on taking another day off from the trail after driving back from Vermont. This gave me a day to resupply and sleep, before leaving early the next morning to meet my bf at Lake Watauga, where we would hike 33miles over the course of three days together. I was slightly nervous about this, mainly because I firmly believe backpacking with someone is a good test of the relationship. Also, I'd be his plus one to his best friend's wedding, meaning I'd meet his parents and friends for the first time in one blow. I'd been living like a hermit in the woods for about a month. I hoped I hadn't completely forgotten how to socialize. I had vague uncomfortable visions of not remembering how to answer simple, normal questions, such as, How are you? and How are you currently living out of your intentions to live a life of deep meaning and not just fritter it away on meaningless pursuits because you're too afraid of making choices and commiting?? Oof. I had also just spent several days surrounded by a lot of immediate and extended family under one roof, and while I love, love, LOVE my family (I have to say that, they might be reading this), it was just... a LOT of family. I've been casually sipping in micro doses, and this was a fire hose. (Yes, yes, a lovely fire hose though, love you too, Mom)
All of this made me desperately want to escape to the woods. I convinced my brother to help slack pack me from Lee Gap to McAfee Knob, a mellow 21mi stretch not terribly far from my parents house. McAfee Knob to the James River Footbridge (56miles) was one of the sections I have backpacked previously and was planning on skipping. He agreed to pick me up later that evening at McAfee knob parking lot and give me a lift back to my car at Lee Gap. I threw my water filter and a few snacks in a daypack I scrounged from my parents outdoor gear closet. I paused, wondering if I should add a flashlight. Extra weight, and I was fairly sure I'd finish before dark. Still... isn't it always better to be prepared? But surely I'd be back before dark! And here, dear reader, is my full permission to judge me. Also, if you are debating about whether or not to take a flashlight, take this as a sign to damn well take it. I didn't. 
I planned on leaving around 8am, since it is slightly over an hour's drive to Lee Gap. But I was running late, based on who I am as a person. I got to the trailhead at 11:45am, and quickly started tackling the first hill. It wasn't long before the familiar sense of deep relief, being and belonging seeped into my soul, and eased out most of the tension.
I set a good pace, and the miles melted away in wonder and delight of the forest around me. I pranced lightly along a ridgeline of spaced trees and grass dancing gaily in the wind. Several deer glanced up from their grazing, deemed me not to be a threat, and continued their meal. Most of the trail was covered in small, sharp tan stones, crushed enough that it was not unpleasant walking on them. The sun was exerting extra strength, but there was no humidity, and since I didn't have my heavy pack, I didn't mind the heat. By late afternoon, despite my fairly fast clip, I knew I was going to have a difficult time making it to the parking lot before dark. I started jogging the downhills, and even this refused to put me in a bad mood. 
I got close to Dragon's Tooth, a mountain I used to climb a good amount while growing up. The sight of familiar trail was intoxicating and nostalgic. I passed a stream. I was running low on water, but I decided not to bother stopping, and plow on to the top of Dragon's instead. Guthooks indicated there was a spring closer to the summit anyway. By the time I was reaching the spring, I was terribly thirsty. I instantly regretted my earlier hasty decision. The spring was bone dry. I drained the last of my bottle, and staggered on up the rocks. A headache was beginning to form. I didn't spend long at the summit. The rock formations are peculiar and interesting, but I've climbed them before and don't care for the amount of fear accompanied. And I was really, really thirsty. A headache began to form, and I looked ahead on Guthooks, desperately hoping a stream would magic itself up on it in the near future. The closest one was three miles ahead. I still had about 7 miles until the parking lot, and the sun was beginning to make subtle signs of setting. I knew the blue trail down to Dragon's tooth had a few stream crossings near the parking lot. 
I quickly made a decision and shot my brother a text.
I reached the stream crossing on the blue trail slightly over an hour later. I greedily gulped water and made promises to myself that I'd never be so dumb again. I meandered to the parking lot, where I waited for about an hour. I had expected my brother to be there when I reached the trailhead, but figured he had maybe gotten a late start. I decided to call him. I held my phone above my head and waved it around, like Lion King. I marched around the whole parking lot, but there were no bars, other than the Circle of Life song I was humming. I pulled up the last message I had sent to my brother and squinted at it. 
""Hey! I need water, so going to go down the blue trail to the dragon tooth trail head parking lot. Should be there in ~hour. Want to hike McAfee & see sunset w/me ltr?"" 
It seemed fairly clear. He'd know to pick me up at Dragons Tooth, not McAfee Knob.. right? All he had replied was ""nah, too much of a chicken""
I shivered. My sweat had fully dried and the wind had started picking up. I started pacing the parking lot, rubbing my arms. Another hour passed. The last bits of sun slowly disappeared. Surely by now he would be at McAfee and realize his mistake. Any minute now, I told myself. The cold had started seeping into my bones. I was desperate. I started walking up the road to a gas station about half a mile away. They would let me use their phone, I reasoned.
My brother answered the third time I redialed.
Who is this? He asked suspiciously
Hey, it's Hannah, I was cold so I went to the gas station near Dragon Tooth's parking lot. When do you think you'll get here? 
There was a long pause and then a sharp intake of breath, and very quiet whisper, Oh no.
Wait, what do you mean, ""Oh no?""
Another long pause.
Hannah, I'll be there in an hour.
You forgot about me, didn't you??!
He couldn't deny it. 
But he brought me a soda to make up for it, so all's well that ends well.","Lee Gap

Since I am decidedly human, I am plagued with many flaws, some endearing and some not as much. One of these dithers between both categories, and I'm not sure I'd even call it a flaw, insomuch as it is an ingrained personality trait. Cue the argument for nature or nurture for how personality forms. I am extremely competitive. Extremely. Is this a genetic predisposition? Perhaps. Both of my parents are, and gosh good golly, most of my siblings are by extension. Our types of competitiveness varies, but one thing rings true. We like to win. We really, really, like to win. Playing boardgames with my family is an experiment and experience in survival and sanity, winner takes all, no bars hold. Tears are almost guaranteed. We had the standard footraces and ballgames, but we also created arbitrary games with intriguing rules.  My sister and I created a game while we were quite young and the rules are simple. Consume more glasses of water than your opponent before you leave a restaurant, but you have to drink the entire glass once you start, otherwise you forfeit. (The winner might be the person who drank less, but drained all of their glasses.) To this day I can't go to a restaurant without seeing how many glasses of water I can consume before the check arrives, even though no one else at the table knows I'm in a locked competition with them. I've wheedled my bf to playing with me each time we go out, and I'm not entirely sure if he plays because he finds it amusing, or if he's just trying to humor me. The spirit of competition runs deep, and often it's just me competing with myself to set a PR. I'm not a madwoman, I don't turn everything into a competition and I know my limits (when I was trail running, I was a solid middle of the packer, and had no aspirations of being an Olympian or even placing in my age group. I walk the uphills in races. I stop to eat snacks and admire cool trees. Once I stopped to dip my toes in a lake.) But in areas I know I have a chance of winning... Yes. It's a competition whether you know it or not. I had spent three lovely days 33 miles hiking from the road crossing 19E to Lake Watauga with my bf. I was pleasantly surprised to discover he is a good hiking partner, our paces mostly matched, and we alternated between conversation and being content to hike in silence. He was also equally enthusiastic about stopping often for snacks, a behavior I heartily endorse. I didn't feel the need to entertain him, so my previous plans of abandoning him for a few hours a day so I could introvert did not have to come to fruition. We hiked fewer miles than I usually aim for, but felt good to ease back into hiking after a long weekend off. The last day it rained on us, which helped bring the temperature down. We started eagerly making plans to get burgers once we got off trail. He checked google and confirmed that there was a promising burger joint not far from where we would get to his Jeep. All day, the tantalizing promise of a burger lured me down the trail, and we both hiked faster even though it was our longest mile day. We were 0.3mi away, so close I could almost taste the burger, when I needed to stop to tie my boot. I made the mistake of sitting down. He did too. We realized how tired we were, and just sat on the side of the trail for about 15min. Ok, we should get up and go he eventually said. I sighed. 0.3mi always feels like the longest mile.I'll get up when you get up, I grinnedNah, I'll get up when YOU get up, he laughed back.I paused.The primal, insane, I like to win part of me, that blasted devil on my shoulder twitched. The wise, mature, very hungry for a burger Hannah part of me gently advised me to let it go. Move on. Don't take the bait. Not everything has to be a competition, just ignore it, get up, go get that dang burger. I leaned slightly into that. I wanted a burger. I needed a burger. I could pick a different competition, one that involved eating the most fries or something. My bf grinned, waiting for my response. He laughed, oh, did this just become a competition??The devil on my shoulder shrieked. Dammit, why did you say that???! Now it is!You're kidding, right?  He rolled his eyes. Fine. Two can play this game. Our mutual stubbornness matched and dug in. I was fairly sure I could outlast him, but I was worried he could go on for quite awhile. Perhaps even until the burger joint closed! Oh, the horror. No fries. No burgers. What a miserable life. Our stomachs both rumbled. I tried several tactics. I shamelessly flirted, plead, smack talked, and just talked longingly about all the delightful food we were missing out on. He wouldn't budge. A flicker of worry tinged. Had my stubbornness met it's match?I wish I could tell you, dear reader, my affection for food and bf override this ridiculousness, but instead we sat there for two hours. TWO HOURS. We were 0.3mi from civilization, from hot, greasy, food we didn't have to cook ourselves, from sleep. It was so close, so agonizingly close. My stomach rumbled again, louder and longer. He suddenly stood up. I know how much you want a burger he said quietly, and I want you to be able to have that and started marching down the trail. The smug satisfaction of my victory was tempered, especially when he paid for our food. I wish I could say I experienced a little growth in that moment, but we all know, 10/10 would do again. ","19E road crossing

Yep.
I'm discovering my creativity and desire to tell good story wanes greatly in the heat and humidity. I started writing a trail journal without any intention of updating it often. It was a way to track mileage, keep friends and family updated, and better hone my storytelling craft. I also knew walking roughly 2,000 miles was going to be mentally tough. Physically tough, yes, but perhaps even more so mentally. Humor can be an excellent antidote and I figured knowing I was going to update an online journal would help me find the funny in situations otherwise frustrating. Bear encounters, embarrassing body functions, and rough days become avenues of good story, laughter and connection. How can I portray my humanity in a way other people might also opt to reveal theirs? I have no illusions of changing the world (okay, maybe small illusions), but can I offer something of myself to it, and hope it becomes a little bit lighter, a little bit bigger, and maybe a little bit of a more beautiful, welcoming, and punnier (a pun on a pun. Yes, I DID.) But since this is my self imposed mission, it suddenly became rather daunting when I'd reach camp at the end of the day, hot, tired and admittedly grumpy, and realize I HAD NOTHING TO SAY. Unless it's was a series of F bombs, and there's other corners of the internet for that. I'd also have to take to washing my own mouth out with soap, and honestly, just don't want the extra pack weight.
So. I'm taking the pressure off of myself to keep updating this journal, because there is a distinct difference between wanting to write and feeling obligated to, and I'm feeling a good bit of both. Don't worry, I know it's all in my head. 
I'm definitely not abandoning this lovely, weird hiker trash corner of the internet, but probably will only post occasionally. I have a few half finished posts in my notes app, and there's also still a lot of miles before Maine. Thanks for being groovy granola readers! Catch you down the trail!","

Running Bear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645165,"Oh hello, good people from the internet. 
I’m glad my hiking skills are better and more consistent than my skills of updating this journal. 
So. 
At 9:50am on Sept. 22, 2021, I reached the summit of Katahdin!!! (pause for a wild dance break and applause)* 
A lot has happened between the last trail journal update and when I high fived my trail crew (two of whom were beginning to head down because it was teeth chattering cold on the summit) and climbed up on the saw horse for a few pictures. Oh yeah, I have a trail crew now. Remember how I was fairly adamant I was going to hike the entirety of the trail without joining a tramily? (I still have a strong aversion to the word tramily. Ew. gross. Please no.) 
Here’s some of the hot takes: 
1. Entered PA after hiking 44 miles in 23 hours, completing the four state challenge! I felt like shit. Mad respect to any ultra trail runners out there. I had a breakdown at 3am and questioned all of my life choices.
2. I hit Pine Grove Furnace and participated in the ice-cream gallon challenge. I devoured 7 pints of Neopolitan and a pint of Moose Tracks in 26 minutes and 15 seconds (I grew up in a large family. I know how to eat at an alarmingly fast pace). This was after hiking 18 miles in the heat on a mostly empty stomach because I was running low on food. Here’s some advice if you are thinking of following in my footsteps: don’t. 
After draining the last drop of melted ice cream, I sat at the table in slight discomfort. While I’m not lactose intolerant, dairy and I… have a shaky relationship. I can get away with a few slices of cheese or milk in my cereal. But eating an entire gallon of ice-cream (perhaps even for the most wild dairy consuming aficionado) is tempting fate. My bloated stomach rumbled. Strange winds started emanating from the nether regions. I let out a belch (and rated it, because dammit, I’m a LADY). The time of reckoning was nigh.
I politely excused myself, and hurried across the parking lot to the AT museum and accompanying restrooms as quickly as I could with my serious hiker hobble. I didn’t make it. Halfway across the parking lot, my stomach demanded penance. The ice cream was leaving my body one way or the other, in apocalyptic modus operandi, do not pass Go, do not collect $200. With a sudden lurch, I abandoned my previous trajectory and pivoted my body to face the woods, my usual safe haven. I drunkenly stumbled the last few steps to the edge of the parking lot, reaching out to steady myself beside the sleek, black, polished and shiny chrome Tacoma truck. The floodgates opened and an impressive tsunami of stomach churned ice cream poured forth. I felt so much better until I glanced over at the truck and locked eyes with a rather good looking gentleman with a pained, disgusted grimace on his face. I was mortified. For a brief second, I desperately hoped a sinkhole would open up under me. With as much dignity as I could muster, I straightened, wiped the remaining evidence on my face, and continued my trek across the parking lot. 
3. Most of PA was rough, mainly due to the heat and humidity. I stubbed my toe more than 53x (I didn’t start counting until halfway through the state). I also almost stepped on a few rattlesnakes, which is an excellent method for quickly spiking your heart rate. I got caught in a severe thunderstorm and tornado warning on top of a ridgeline. Some hiker fatigue set in, and I had to reduce my mileage fairly drastically for about a week. But surprisingly, mostly I enjoyed PA. I met and hiked around some fun people, the change of scenery was intriguing, the rock scrambles were fun, and most of the ice-cream stops were insanely good (it only took 2 days after the Pine Grove fiasco for me to crave ice-cream again). But mostly I think I enjoyed PA out of sheer stubbornness. The state gets such a bad rap on trail, and it usually gets rated as the least favorite state to hike the AT through. I was determined to find the good in it and dammit, I did. But I was very glad when I finally reached the PA/NJ line!
4. I saw several bears in New Jersey-big, glossy, and apparently they were the not-intimidated-by-humans kind of bears. I didn’t panic and run like an idiot again, but I will confess that I once did pee my pants slightly when a bear dropped out of a tree right beside the trail. I also used enough enhanced vocabulary to make a sailor blush. 
5. I happily deli blazed my way through NJ and half of NY. The hiker hunger arrived with fierce commitment to take the reins of my budget. The amount of food was astonishing, but more concerning was the rate at which it was being consumed. Again, I grew up in a large family and am no stranger to eating fast. But my childhood was mere training grounds, bootcamp for becoming a Marine of scarfing down food. The racing we had growing up to see who could get the last piece of pie pales in comparison to the vaguely horrifying practices I began to engage in. Unabated hunger, part primal fear there won’t be enough, never be enough, a somewhat feral wildness. I would crouch low, protectively over my food and inhale like a suffocated man gulps air. If I descended from anything, it was not apes. It was lions. Touch my food and die. 
6. halfway through NY, the guy I was dating broke up with me. As far as breakups go, it was actually good. We had different visions for our lives and our differences had reached a point where we both knew we were not going to be together for the long haul. I don’t like my time wasted, I appreciated him deciding to call it. We had given it our best shot, and we ended on amicable terms. It had been a mostly good, healthy relationship, and I felt I learned a lot about myself and relationships in general and I walked away a better person for it. But damn. It sucked. So, two days later when my sister (who is also thru-hiking) called and told me she was hopping off trail for a couple weeks to take care of some business and go to the beach with my family, I decided to join. She then convinced me to skip ahead to New Hampshire and hike with her to Katahdin. So, when I say I reached the summit of Katahdin at 9:50am on Sept. 22, 2021, it’s with the knowledge I still have close to 200 miles left. (I’m taking a few days off before I head back to the trail crossing of NY 301 by Fahnstock State Park.)  
7. Two unfortunate incidents occurred: after hiking all the way from GA to NY without any serious injuries, I twisted my knee while attempting to catch a wave at the beach. From the point I got back on trail until Katahdin, it would be in pretty consistent pain. I purchased a knee brace, reduced my mileage drastically through the Whites, and took up cursing as a full time hobby. Additionally, some life factors prevented my sister from being able to hike more than a couple days in NH before getting off trail, without the knowledge of when she might be able to get back on. I decided to keep going. A couple days after entering NH, I caught up to the small group of guys I had hiked a little bit with in North Carolina. We had clicked well, and once I saw them, I realized I had missed them. A lot. I also realized I had gotten what I needed from hiking solo and was ready to join a group. I did, and the Boys in Motion became the Boys n’ Girl(s) in Motion. After hiking through New Hampshire and Maine with them, I discovered that when thru-hikers say the best part of the trail is the people… it’s true.   
So. 
That’s where we land for now. I’m in Maine, reading books, icing my knee, and trying lobster for the first time. I have some preemptive nostalgia and I am deeply glad I still have more trail to hike. I’m not quite ready to be done, not just yet. 
*Fun fact: There is a gain of 4,152ft of elevation in just 5.2mi on the AT. from the Birches campsite in Baxter to the summit of Katahdin. If you would like to recreate this experience at home, take a sledgehammer to your longest staircase, hose it down so it’s really slippery, and toss some random boulders in for good measure, and walk up and down this multiple times. Oh, also, turn your thermostat to its lowest setting and add several large fans for the wind effect.","

Running Bear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646023,"I need to spend another five months in the woods, ASAP. 
Do I miss the trail? Yeah, a little bit. Am I still struggling to “adjust” to post trail life? Hm, maybe a smidge. Am I longing for the sharp scent of campfires and pines, the sounds of gentle wind rustling leaves and springs bubbling, the quiet cadence of my footsteps in rhythm with the forest? Yes, yes, and yes, but all of this is not why I am currently feverishly searching the internet for another long distance hike (preferably in a warm climate). I don’t know how to segue into this particular post, so in the wise words of Sammy Davis, Jr., “When you lose a lover it's like getting a bad haircut. It grows back in time.” 
I don’t really care about the lover part. I JUST NEED MY HAIR TO GROW BACK. 
oh god. What have I done? 
My father had six daughters in rapid succession and also was poor. Yes, I know that’s an ill written sentence. We weren’t destitute- homelessness was not how I got my start in backpacking- but we didn’t have a lot of extra money just waiting to be spent. I was blissfully unaware of our situation and simply believed all families had people donating hand me down clothes and toys to them. Taking six girls to the salon for regular trims would have cost a small fortune, so my father took matters into his own hands. He knew one cut and one cut only: the bowl mullet cut. You will not find this cut in any hairdresser magazines, this was a one-of-a-kind. This was the Bill Vickery specialty (before my brothers arrived on scene and he expanded the repertoire to include the Burr cut, even though he has no prior military affiliations.) From 2-11 years old (the year of my 1st rebellion. Down with the patriarchy) I sported this runway-esque, sorry, runaway style. My self confidence is hard earned, folks. 
I tried to take good care of my hair while on trail. Did I carefully comb out the accumulated snarls each night even when I was so exhausted I didn’t brush my teeth? Yep. Did I wear hats and bandannas and protective styles? Yes yes yes. Did I actually bring a small bottle of leave-in hair conditioner? You bet. Did this prevent it from getting a bunch of dead ends and breakage and even an extreme amount of fall out? Nope. The rigors of the trail combined with poor nutrition and lack of care I can provide at home took it’s toll. I finished on Oct. 10th and tried to salvage my hair for the next two months to no avail. Finally, yesterday, I caved. I would have to cut a large portion of it off, and frankly, I was too lazy to do it myself (I’ve been doing my own hair on and off for the past ~8 years).I booked an appointment at a local salon. 
Had I gone there before? No. Did I look at reviews online or check in with friends before going? Uhhhh… that would have been a good idea, right?
My first clue to run was the 60 something year old hairdresser sporting an “interesting choice” perm. She ushered me to the seat and being polite to a fault, I placed my soul in her hands. My second clue was when she briskly ripped her comb through my hat and wind snarled hair as if efficiency was her prized goal. She cheerfully confided she had gotten her start as a hairdresser by cutting inmates hair at the local prison. 
They’d all be lined up, and I got it down to where I could bang out a haircut in five minutes!”
Oh… uh, wow? 
She slowed down when she got to the actual cutting part, and although I warily eyed her shears, the rising panic subsided. She firmly turned my head here and there and seemed to be quite confident in what she was snipping. The initial simple chop seemed fine. A bit shorter than I had wanted, but I had asked her to take out the most severe damage. I relaxed and forgot to stay vigilant. She asked if I was still thinking bangs, I had mentioned on the phone I was thinking of it. 
Sure I said amiably. Why the hell not? 
She combed out the bang section. It seemed a little too heavy. I hesitated. She did not. Her shears crisply flew across half of my forehead in a blunt line. 
The next half came off slightly lopsided and shorter. Back to the first half, where she took one clump of hair and snipped away. 
Oh no. no, no, no. I was mute with horror. 
Then she feathered the sides over my ears to “blend in” with the rest of my hair. It didn’t blend. She FEATHERED. She put in chunky layers. I don’t know what happened over the next five minutes. All I know is that I went from a fairly standard wash and go type of lob to the absolutely worst haircut I’ve had since I was 11 years old. She butchered it. I can do better cuts than this. I HAVE done better cuts than this. It looks like a 70’s throwback party where Stevie Nicks and Chrissie Hynde had some kind of love child. I know mullets are in, but geez.  
She was positively beaming. 
Oh wow, you look so much older, she gushed
Yeah, I look older. I look like a frumpy 40 year old woman who is going through a strange midlife crisis. 
But I didn’t say that. 
Oh… uh, wow. It’s.. huh. Um, thanks I gasped, paid, walked straight to my car, and burst into hysterical laughter. 
It’s okay, it’s fine, everything is fine. It’s just hair, as Sammie Jr. says, it’ll grow back eventually. But if you need me in the next 4-5 months, I’ll be in the woods, hat firmly on my head.",,View Entry,"Dec 09, Thu",0
