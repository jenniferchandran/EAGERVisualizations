Skeeter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632865,"Hello and welcome to my trailjournals page. This is my first post. I meant to post yesterday, but I didn’t have service and and what I had typed out sadly disappeared forever. I’m going to do my best to sum up the last couple of days now.2/28I was dropped off yesterday afternoon and started hiking around 4. I was immediately thrown into the reality of how difficult the trail might be when I had to climb the ~700 steps with my pack. The struggle didn’t last too long though and after that, the trail seemed easier. I made it to a shelter a few miles into the approach trail and set up there for the night. It was going to rain and I would be glad to have a roof over my head. 3/1I woke up feeling surprisingly well rested, filled up my water, ate a quick breakfast of poptarts and oatmeal and was on my way. After only a couple miles of hiking, I hit the official start of the Appalachian Trail (the hiking I did the day before was just the approach trail, but if you don’t do the whole thing I’m not so sure that it really counts). Once on the AT, the weather took a slight turn for the worse and it started to rain. Not too heavy though and I’m sure there will be plenty more rain to face, so I’m kind of glad I got do some rain hiking already. From there, I hiked about 15 miles, which was a little further than I wanted to start my miles at, but tomorrow is going to be a pretty tough hike and I wanted to make it as short as I could. The plan is to make it to Blood Mountain, the highest point on the Appalachian trail in Georgia. Tonight is my first night sleeping in my hammock on the trail, but I’m exhausted and am confident I’ll fall asleep as soon as I close my eyes. Excited for tomorrow and the days that follow! See you soon, Maine!","Approach Trail

Woke up at gooch gap today at about 7 and was on the trail by 8. I received my trail name today when I was coming up on an older hiker from behind.  I guess he didn’t hear me because when I said “good morning” from behind him I startled him a bit and he said in one of the thickest southern accents I’ve ever heard “whew! You snuck up on me like a summertime skeeter” or something close to that. I mentioned to him that my grandpa used to call me Skeeter, so he said it should be my trail name. 
 Made it a quick 5 miles to woody gap and was feeling good, but then I got a bit of bad news. I had really planned to make it to the summit of blood mountain today, but learned that I would not be able to camp at the summit without a bear canister, which I do not have. I would either have to hike about 2.5 miles beyond the summit or make camp a little early. I was feeling pretty sore from pushing my miles yesterday and opted for the latter I made it to Woods Hole Shelter by 2:30 and set up camp. I am happy with my decision to stop early. I got a little extra rest for my legs and I got to meet thru-hiker Pebbles and her husband, bam-bam who is hiking for 2 weeks with her. I also met Green Ranger, who I hiked about 4 miles with today. Jeff who works at the nearby outdoors store and his dog Rosco also camped with us. He thru hiked in 2018 and offered a lot a trail wisdom that I’m very thankful for. We are about a mile and a half from the summit of blood mountain. Excited to get there tomorrow!

Woke up at Woody Gap after a pretty good sleep. Was on the trail at about 8:15 and ready to conquer blood mountain. The climb up wasn’t too bad, but the descent was pretty tough. After making it down the mountain, we arrived at Mountain Crossings, the outfitter that’s practically on trail. I bought a pack liner to increase the warmth of my sleeping bag. I haven’t been too cold, but I wanted to get a liner to be sure I am ready for the cold of the smokies. I also bought a frozen pizza, which the people at mountain crossings cooked for me and I then happily devoured. I stayed at woody gap chatting with other hikers for about an hour. I met a few new people including a group of 4 students taking time off from Cornell to thru hike. I got back on the trail feeling full of energy from my large lunch, but my knees were a little sore from the way down Blood. I didn’t want to push too hard today, so I stopped after about 11 miles total of hiking. My goal is to average 14 miles/day thru the first 100 miles and then move up to 16 and eventually make my way to 18. Tonight will be my first stealth hike (a hike not at a recognized camp site) and I’m looking forward to it. I found a nice spot to set up my hammock. I can watch the sunset from nearby where I set up. It’s the first sunset I’ve really been able to see over the mountains and it definitely did not disappoint.","

Woke up this morning to a beautiful sunrise on Wildcat Mountain. Today I planned to hike about 10 miles to Chattahoochee Gap, where I was hoping to get a shuttle to town and pick up a knee brace. My knee has been a little irritated the last couple days and making the downhills more painful and slow than I’d like them to be. Hopefully this will help. The 10 miles to Chattahoochee was pretty easy with very little change in elevation. Once I made it there, I realized that I had made a mistake. I would not be able to get a ride from Chattahoochee because there was not a road there. An unfortunate and pretty stupid mistake on my part. My punishment was having to hike the 5 miles to Unicoi gap. There was a lot of downhill, so going was slow, but I made it there eventually and got a shuttle to Ingels in Hiawasee from Grace who used to be the sheriff deputy in Tampa. She was great! I picked up my brace, some bengay, and a few snacks and was ready for a shuttle back to the trail. It was then that I learned how difficult it is to find a shuttle late in the day. I was unable to find one, but as I was giving up hope My savior, Bear from Hostel around the Bend pulled up with thruhikers Evan, crash, and Same-Same. I was offered a ride to the hostel where I would get a free meal, a bed, a shower, and use of laundry. It was an offer I couldn’t refuse. The hostel was great. I couldn’t have asked for more. I’d recommend Hostel Around the Bend to anyone needing a place for a bit of rest in Georgia. Super accommodating and an incredibly relaxing evening. I also got to meet and hang out with tons of new hikers! Shout out to Papa Groot, JD, Old Goat, Mighty Mouse, Trip, and On Point. Super awesome guys. Very happy to have met them! 


3/5 The original plan for today was to slackpack, which means I would leave my pack at the hostel, get shuttled back to unicoi, and hike the 17 miles back to the hostel with only a day pack with a few things in it.That plan changed when I woke up feeling way more sore than I anticipated. I decided that instead of pushing miles today and potentially injuring myself, I would take my first zero at Hostel around the Bend.I had a fantastic day of recovery! I got to get to know some of the guys who had also elected to take a zero day better today too. Tomorrow I will actually he slack packing to Dicks Creek Gap with one of the hikers, same-same.He’s a very experienced hiker who thru hiked the Pacific Crest Trail in 2018 and I’m excited to tackle my longest hike year with him!   I ended the night by sitting around a fire built by trail angel, Terry (trail name pterodactyl) who thru hiked in 2016. It was awesome to get to talk with people from so many different backgrounds and get closer with my fellow thru hikers.

Woke up at Hostel around the Bend this morning feeling amazing! Definitely the best I’ve felt upon waking up so far. Today, I was planning on slack packing with same-same the 17 miles from Unicoi Gap to Dicks Creek gap. Bear from the Hostel shuttled same- same and I to Unicoi and we were out hiking by 8:15. The hike today was probably the toughest yet with a ton of elevation change. I kept up with same-same for the first steel ascent, but once we got to the downhill, I had to slow down to protect my knee and he quickly left me in the dust. Before he left, though, I picked up a couple tips from him. I learned to use my trekking poles much more effectively. Especially on the downhills, which was a massive help. I got into a rhythm and  before I knew it, it was 12:30 and I’d made it 10 miles. I was being extra cautious, but my knee was holding up well. Very happy with the effectiveness of the brace. The trail was pretty dead today. I only saw about 5 people on the trail, 2 of whom were day hikers. Near the end of the day, I ran into an older gentleman named Rocky Top. He is from Tennessee. I chatted with him for a bit and recommended the hostel around the bend. He said he has already been planning on staying there tonight. I walked the last couple miles with him and began the short walk from Dicks Creek to the hostel to pick up my pack. A very nice man pulled over and asked us if we wanted a lift to the hostel. It was only about half a mile, but I was very grateful for the offer. I picked up my stuff from the hostel and made my way back to Dicks Creek where I will be sleeping tonight. I’m super happy with how the hike went today and just hoping that I wake up without too much soreness tomorrow. Tomorrow is another big day! I plan to take mileage a little easier, but we will be leaving Tennessee and entering North Carolina! As the night wound down, I set up my hammock and started a fire, which I am enjoying the warmth of as I write this update. Absolutely loving my time on the trail! See you tomorrow NC!","

Today I woke up to the sun rising over the mountain just before 7. It was a sluggish and sore start today, so I wasn’t on the trail until about 8:30, but one I was walking I quickly found my groove. The plan today was to hike the 12 miles that would put me in North Carolina and finish at muskrat creek shelter where I would meet up with crash and Evan (now kid). It was a tough day of nearly all increases in elevation. Though it would be a hard day, I was happy there wouldn’t be too much downhill because that is much harder on my knee, which still is not quite 100%. 
I saw same-same (now 9-5) early on in the day as he passed me on a downhill. I didn’t see many thru hikers today, but lots of day hikers and section hikers were around. Some sad news came today when I saw On Point, a hiker I had met at the hostel and he told me he would have to put his thru hike on hold. His father was sick and he wanted to be around. Hoping that his father recovers quickly and he is able to get back on the trail shortly after. His departure was a reminder to me of how lucky I am to have an opportunity like this. 
I crossed into North Carolina around 1:00 and had about 3 miles to go until muskrat creek. Those last 3 miles were probably the hardest 3 miles I’ve had on the trail so far. I heard another hiker say North Carolina would not be getting an x-mas card from him this year and I have to say I agree. A very difficult introduction to the state. Luckily, I caught up to 9-5 on the way and he helped motivate me to keep going. I arrived at muskrat creek close to 3:00, but 9-5 kept on. He wanted to make it to the next shelter. He can’t hike tomorrow because he has to work remotely (hence the name). I met Luke at the shelter who is doing a 1 week section hike of the AT to help him prepare for the PCT, which he plans to start on April 14th. I also met a 74-year old thru hiker, Tinker and 3 members of the peace corps, Loon, Samwise, and Matt. We had wonderful conversation around the fire. Tinker hiked the AT in 2016 and the PCT in 2018 and he shared his wisdom with us. Things he had learned both on the trail and in his life prior to hiking. His first ever overnight hike was when he was 69, so he lived plenty of life before becoming a serious hiker. Proves that it’s never too late to chase your dreams. Pretty awesome guy. 


3/8
Good morning from North Carolina! I have to say North Carolina made a strong case today. It redeemed itself and I’m ready to give it another chance. 
I woke up at about 6:45 to temperatures below freezing, which was not very pleasant, but once I got moving it became much more bearable. I left just behind Crash and Kid who had spent the night at Muskrat Creek. We all planned to hike at least 12 miles today to a shelter. If we felt good, we would continue to a tent site 16 miles away.
When I first started, I wasn’t feeling great. It was freezing and the terrain was very rocky at first. After about the first mile, though, the sun started to warm me up and the terrain leveled out a bit. Today I would be climbing Standing Indian mountain. It stands at 5478 feet and will be the highest point yet on the trail. 

>span class=""s1"">After I made it to the top, I began the descent and not too far down I ran into Crash. We ended up hiking together for most of the rest of the day. The weather today was perfect. We have gotten so lucky with the lack of rain so far. I’m sure we are in for a downpour before too long. Crash and I made it the 12 miles to the shelter faster than expected. We were both feeling good and wanted to take advantage of our great weather. We decided we would hike on to the tent site. 
Unfortunately, once we arrived at the campsite, we could not locate Kid. It seems like he was really feeling awesome today and decided to push further than 16 today. We should see him tomorrow in Franklin, which is a town in NC that we all want to check out. 
Crash and I found and awesome water source at our tent site and were able to dip our feet into the creek and wash off some of the dirt that had accumulated over the last few days. My feet are also starting to get a couple blisters, so putting them in the cold water for a bit made them feel much better. We finished the day with another fire and went to bed at about 9. 
Today was probably my best day of hiking yet. My legs felt great and my knee barely hurt at all. It seems that my trail legs are finally starting to come in. Hopefully I am right and will be able to pick up my mileage shortly. Wishing for more days like this! 
3/9
Woke up in betty gap tent site this morning with Crash. We planned to hike to winding stair gap today. It was about a 12 mile hike. From there we would head into Franklin, NC where we would meet Kid and 9-5. It was a pretty level hike today and we passed the 100 mile mark. Only about 2100 miles to go now!
Thankfully it wasn’t too tough of a day and we made it the 12 miles by 2. We caught a shuttle to town and called trail legend, Ron Haven to stay at his place, Baltimore Jack’s. He set crash and I up well and gave us a quick tour of the town. He dropped us off at outdoor 76, a popular outfitter and bar, where we met 9-5 and Kid. We also reconnected with Papa Groot, JD, and Old Goat who we had met at the Hostel around the bend. I met a hiker named Ben who happened to go to North Dakota State, the school that my college, James Madison, often meets in the FCS national championship. We talked a little about football, but we talked more about what he planned to do after the trail. His dream is to be a nasa astronaut and it seems that he is well on his way to doing just that. He got his undergrad and masters from NDSU and is just starting to hear back from the schools he applied to to earn his PHD. His dream school is Southern California. Wishing him the best. From there, we moved on to a restaurant called the Lazy Hiker where I got one of the best burgers I’ve ever eaten. There I met hikers .JPG (jolly purple giant) and Gramps. They were awesome to talk to. It continues to amaze me the range of background that thru hikers are coming from. The only thing they seem to have in common is that they have all been unbelievably pleasant to talk to and connect with. Towards the end of the night, we learned that there would be a controlled burn that would close the trail right where we needed to hike until 4 the next day. It was a bummer and would force us to take a zero day in Franklin. Not the worst situation at all, but I definitely hadn’t planned to take 2 zeroes this early. At least I’d have the chance to rest my legs some more and hopefully get my knee back to full strength. We ended the night back at Baltimore jacks where I fell asleep maybe even before my head hit the pillow.","

Pretty chaotic wake up at Baltimore Jacks this morning. We found out that the trail wouldn’t be closing until 9, but it was already about 8:45 and we had just barely woken up. We would need to make a mad dash to the trail to make it in time. We arrived at the trail at 9:26 and begged an ATC employee to let us onto the trail. We promised we’d sprint the part that was to be closed and luckily he let us by. It was the fastest hiking I’d done and we were doing it on a fairly steep upwards grade. We made the 6 mile hike in just over 2 hours. Definitely the best time we had made on any miles to date. We decided to turn the day that we expected to be a zero into a nero (nearly a zero) and got a shuttle from Maggie to her and Wiggy’s place, Nantahala Mountain Lodge. I was able to get in a very relaxing day at the lodge. Maggie and Wiggy set us up very nicely in their place. They are both from England. Wiggy thru hiked in 2010 and they have been doing their best to help out hikers since then. We didn’t do too much at the lodge. I’ve had some pretty nasty blisters flare up the last couple days, so I     treated them with neosporin and wrapped them in medical tape. I was in need of a small resupply and was actually able to get everything I needed right out of the in house store that wiggy and Maggie run. We finished the night off by watching a movie called focus on Hulu. It was pretty decent. It was nice to just sit there and do nothing for a little bit.


3/11
This morning we woke up feeling well rested and after a delicious breakfast of eggs, bagels, and sausage cooked by Maggie we were driven to Wayah gap by Wiggy. I felt great and wanted to push 20 miles today. It would be my longest day and ended on a king downhill. I was feeling up for it and was making great time through about 10 miles. I stopped for a quick lunch with 9-5 and the Kid. I left lunch a little early with the kid because 9-5 planning on going 16 today and stopping at Wesser Bald shelter. We still wanted to make it a little further to Rufus Morgan shelter. We made it to a beautiful view at Wesser bald, where there was a tower that gave a 360 degree view of the surrounding mountains and valleys. We had about 6 miles until Rufus Morgan and was feeling confident. After about 2 miles of hiking, I realized that we were passing the same car we passed earlier, but headed in the opposite direction. We had hiked downhill on the wrong path and in the opposite direction. It was a tough pill to swallow, but there was nothing for us to to but turn around and start the hike back up. We decided we would join Krash and 9-5 at Wesser Bald Shelter. Pretty stupid mistake, but it was my longest day of hiking if you count the miles spent off trail. I guess that is kind of exciting. We arrived at the shelter and prepared dinner. I made my 3rd “ramen bomb” in 3 nights. It’s ramen with instant mashed potatoes mixed in and chips added on top. Pepperoni is optional. It may sound gross, but it is delicious and I will continue to devour them. After that we chatted around the fire for a bit. We are going to bed early because we want to get hiking extra early tomorrow. We hear there is an awesome sunrise view, so we are going to try to make it the 1.6 miles there early.I made this page to post my photos from the trail to. It’s a bit of a pain to get set up on mobile and it will make you create an account,  but I think it should take you right to it if you click it on desktop. Also, it’s free. Don’t pay the $20 for a premium account if you don’t want it. https://vs.co/69da27e5","

This was the hardest morning yet to get up. My hammock was so comfy and it was raining lightly outside. We’ve had incredible weather so far, but it seems there is a lot of rain coming our way. Just in time for the smokies! I wanted to make it to Fontana dam shelter today, which was the last shelter before the smokies and just over 18 miles away. I’d been pushing miles the last couple days, but I had at least one more day in me. I had to really test my legs before I got to the smokies. I started out slow, but once the calories from the breakfast of 2 blueberry pop tarts, a protein bar, and a peanut butter tortilla wrap kicked in I was feeling great! It wasn’t a day of excessively high elevation change and it’s one of the last days we will have in the next week that isn’t supposed to rain excessively. It was raining, but it was very light. I made it down to Stecoah gap, which was about 3 miles from where I started and was elated as I saw trail magic laid out on a picnic table. I got an Apple, a cereal bar, and Taco Bell sauce packets. It might not sound like much, but it made my day! This was the 2nd trail magic I had received. I forgot to mention the first in my journal, but I got an apple and a payday candy bar just before I reached Franklin from trail angel, Ms. Frizzle. The trail magic today was unattended and had no note with it, so I’m not sure who to thank, but it was much appreciated! From there, I hiked on into the fog. The weather was incredibly foggy from the early morning rain which made it impossible to seem more than 15 feet ahead. It was a bit of a pain, but I also appreciated it because it helped me focus on the trail I was walking on rather than the trail that lay ahead. Today’s hike didn’t have an incredible amount of elevation change and the weather wasn’t too bad, so miles came pretty easily. I was making good time and make it all the way to Fontana before 4. Only about a mile and half left! I used the restroom at the Fontana welcome center and when I exited I met Chase. He thru hiked southbound in 2020 and was planning on “yo-yoing” which meant he would start at sprinter mountain, the southernmost point of the AT and go right back to Maine. He was taking a couple weeks off to let his legs rest at the marina in Fontana, but would be starting back north in the next week. I asked him where the best spot to resupply was and instead of telling me, he took me to his boat, made me dinner, and helped fill my food bag. Just another example of the incredible generosity of those on the AT. I chatted with him for a few hours and he even offered to let me sleep on his boat, but I really wanted to make it to Fontana dam shelter tonight, so I left and hiked the last mile or so in the dark. I arrived at the shelter, which is incredibly nice and even has showers! I checked out the site super quick, but it was already dark and I was exhausted from a long day of hiking. I would check it out some more in the morning. I set up my sleep pad and quilt in the shelter and quickly fell asleep. Awesome day!
3/14
Woke up feeling confused at about 7:30 this morning. I didn’t realize that daylight savings was about to start, so it not being light outside really threw me off at first. Once I got over my confusion, I went to take a shower in the bathrooms at the shelter. I had to wash off using the hand soap, but it felt awesome to be able to wash some of the dirt and grime off of my body. When I got back, I chatted a bit with the others who had stayed in the shelter last night. I met Skully and Jackrabbit. Skully is a thru hiker. He attempted to hike last year, but was forced off trail when it closed due to Covid. Jackrabbit is a teacher in Texas who is currently on spring break. He is hiking a section at a take whenever he gets time off and will eventually complete the whole trail. During this break, he is hiking the smokies. Jackrabbit offered to drive me to the nearby general store to buy a couple of things. I was in need of more ibuprofen, pop tarts, and a couple other small items. Once we got our stuff, we headed back to the trail and I got started at about 11. My legs were tired today, so hiking was a little more difficult and came a little more slowly than I would I’ve liked it to. I was only planning on going 12 today though, so luckily I was able to make it to the shelter with plenty of time before dark. The highlights of today’s hike were the views from the Fontana Dam, Shawstuck tower, and I ran into Trip, who I had not seen since Georgia. Trip was hiking with Rhetoric, who I had not met before today. He is a professor at Colorado State and a super funny guy! Skully also showed up at the shelter I was staying at, Mollies Ridge Shelter. Repeat, Brian, Jackrabbit, and Ally stayed here too. It was nice to get to meet some new people today and talk to Jackrabbit, Trip, and Skully some more. Tomorrow I will either hike 12 miles to Derrick Knob shelter or just under 18 to Siler’s Bald Shelter. We will see how I’m feeling in the morning and through the hike tomorrow. 


3/15 


I totally forgot to journal last night, so I forget some of the details of the day, but I will give the necessary info. I was feeling good and wanted to hit Silers Bald Shelter, but when I got to Derrick knob I learned that the shelter had been fully reserved by section hikers. The smokies is kind of weird with shelters. Sections hikers can reserve spots to help the park be Covid conscious and once they are full you are kind of allowed to tent outside the shelter, but it’s a little murky. Also, I am not fully confident with the setup on my hammock yet. I feel pretty good about it, but I want to test it out in a lighter rain before I sleep in a rain like we had last night. It was pouring and very windy. I just stayed at Derrick knob. I would push a different day. 


3/16 



This morning I woke up to pouring rain and nearly white out fog conditions. Before I left to hike the sun came up and the dog lifted a bit, but it was still raining hard. We had had incredible weather so far, so this was my first day hiking in any substantial sort of rain. Hiking in the rain is much slower than hiking in dry weather. I had to be extra cautious because the rocks and mud were so much easier to slip on than normal. I wasn’t moving quickly, but I would still be able to get some decent miles in if I was persistent. I was thinking of going 21 today, but as soon as I saw the change in scenery we got heading into double spring gap shelter, I decided I wanted to take it even slower. We had been in woods full of fallen leaves and bare trees for nearly the entire hike. Those landscapes were pretty, but as I walked into the lush, green pine and moss forest leading to Clingmans dome my jaw dropped. I had not ever been in forest like this. It was beautiful. It reminded me of the planet that they go to in the sixth Star Wars movie that is inhabited by Ewoks. That definitely sounds dumb, but I loved it. It was filled with fog which made it look even more neat and the air smelled like pine. I took a ton of photos and I will post some of them on m VSCO as soon as I get decent internet connection. I was surrounded by that bright green and orange-brown landscape all the way to Clingmans Dome, which is the highest point on the AT at 6,612 feet. Unfortunately, the view that I hear is fantastic was covered by thick fog. Something exciting did happen when I arrived at the dome though. I realized I had made it 200 miles on the AT now! Pretty exciting. Less than 2000 miles to go whooooo! I walked off Clingmans dome and back into the Star Wars-esque forest. It remained that way until I arrived at Mt. Collins Shelter. I had made it 13 miles today, which wasn’t bad, but I would really need to push tomorrow if I wanted to make it out of the smokies by the end of Thursday. This was my favorite day of hiking yet, even with the rain. Just really awesome views in the forest. Hoping to make it just over 20 to Tri-Corner Shelter.3/17


Woke up extra early today to try to get a jumpstart on the day. Ate a big breakfast, packed up all my stuff, and sadly had to say goodbye to Trip and Rhetoric, who I had been hiking with for the last 3 days. Rhetoric had an ankle that had been bothering him for a few days, so they were going into Gatlinburg to take the day off. They asked me if I wanted to come with them, which was tempting, but I wanted to get out of the Smokies. I was having a great time and enjoying the scenery, but I couldn’t take too many town days if I wanted to meet my end date goal. I hiked about 5 miles to Newfound gap, the busiest road crossing in the smokies. There were tons of day hikers around. It was kind of weird to be around so many people again. A few day hikers were interested in thru hiking, so it was cool to get to answer their questions. One younger boy asked me if he could put my pack on. I let him and he told me that it really wasn’t that heavy. I thought that was pretty funny. I hiked with Ali (now Beetle) for most of the day. I had been hiking off and on with her for the last few days along with Trip and Rhetoric. Sadly, I had to say goodbye to her too near the end of the day. She had planned to go 16 today and I really wanted to hit my first 20. After we parted ways, I continued on, but kind of hit a wall with about 2.5 miles to go. The last portion of the day was slow, but I finally made it the 20 miles to tri corner shelter where I met tons of new hikers. There are journals at each shelter that a lot of hikers will write short notes in to let other hikers know where they are. It’s always cool to meet hikers that you have seen the messages of in journals. Today I met Dance Party, Curator, The Dream, Kitchen Sink, and Galdalf who I had all seen messages from and I reconnected with Campbell and Jett who I had met briefly back at Woody Gap in Georgia.  As we reached the end of the night, it began to rain. It was supposed to rain quite a bit and well into tomorrow, which would make it a challenging day. I was hoping to get out of the smokies tomorrow. Wish me luck! 


3/18


It rained all night last night which actually ended up being kind of nice. It drowned out the usual sound of snoring in the shelters. The shelters are a great cover from rain and wind and they do make it more convenient to pack up in the mornings, but one of the major inconveniences is the noise made by others. I slept well and was ready to get out of the smokies. I got a bit later of a start than usual today. I waited to see if the rain might slow down a bit. It did for a couple minutes, but then it just started raining even harder. I took that as a sign that I should get going. The Dream and I left together and began our trek out of the smokies. We tried to keep out shoes wet at first, but quickly gave up when we realized that was not realistic. It was pouring and we were hiking through parts of flooded trail that were up to the middle of our calves at times. It almost felt like we were walking down the middle of a river. The past couple days have been really tough on my feet. My shoes are falling apart much more quickly than I anticipated and more and more blisters keep popping up. I am also feeling a bit of soreness in my left Achilles. It’s nothing serious, but the shoes I am wearing (Altra lone peak 4.5) have a reputation of causing Achilles tendonitis. I am planning to switch to the Hoka speed goat 4, which has a higher heel-toe drop. Everyone I have talked to about them loves them. The Dream and I dealt with the rain for about 4 hours and then it finally let up. The trail was still very flooded, but at least it wasn’t raining on us anymore. We stopped for a quick lunch around then, but before long we were back on our feet. The wet conditions made the miles come slow. The Dream ended up stopping at Davenport Gap shelter and we said goodbye. He was great to hike with, so I hope I see him again before too long. After that, I called Laughing Heart Hostel and arranged a shuttle, a bed for the night, and a slack pack for the following day. I had about 2 miles left to get out of the smokies and then I would be picked up about 4 miles from there. I made it to the spot I was to be picked up from and just about collapsed. This had been my biggest day at just under 22 miles. The Motivation of knowing I would be able to sleep in a bed was probably the only reason I made it there. I was picked up by Iceman, a hiker who was currently doing a work for stay at the hostel. He was super friendly and before long, we had made it to the hostel. Upon arrival, I ate a huge dinner from the complimentary hiker pantry and met a few hikers who were staying at the hostel. I did my laundry and took a shower which was incredible. I felt super gross after the smokies and a shower made me feel so, so much better. After a large meal and a hot shower, I was ready to hit the hay. I would be slack packing tomorrow, so the miles shouldn’t be as difficult, but I needed to hit about 20 miles. It would be tough, but with the promise I made to myself to zero the following day, I knew I’d have the motivation to make it happen. Great, but challenging day today. Time to go to sleep!

I woke today feeling well rested and ready to put in some miles. I had my first hot cup of coffee in a couple weeks, a couple eggs, bacon, and 2 pop tarts. Now I was really ready to get going. I got a shuttle from 2018 thru hiker, Julie to where I was picked up yesterday and then I was off! I had about 23 miles to go to where Julie would pick me up at take me back to the hostel. The weather wasn’t too bad, just a drizzle and very gray. It was too bad because I climbed to the top of Max Patch, which is a high Bald that gives a 360 degree view of the surrounding landscape. The view was covered by fog, but at least I know there are plenty more views to come. From Max Patch, the rest of the day was nearly entirely downhill. I’m so relieved that my knees have gotten stronger because that downhill would have been killer just a couple of weeks ago, but now I was able to hit downhills at a decent speed with very little pain. Slack packing was also making any changes in elevation much lower impact. I was able to hike at a faster rate and with less difficulty. It’s pretty rare to get a chance to slack pack, but when they come around they are amazing. Comparing my last 2 big days to today was day and night. I reached the pickup location and was absolutely exhausted, but I am not sure if I would have been able to make it with my full pack. I was ready for a big ole zero tomorrow! I got back to the hostel and met a few new hikers who had shown up during the day including Santa, who is another 19 year old. He is taking a zero tomorrow as well and I’m thinking maybe we can hike together in the future. We are hiking similar distances and hiking to finish around the same time. He will also return to college in the fall.","

I woke up later than normal today, but early enough to make it to Smokey Mountain Diner with some hikers from the hostel. I got chicken and waffles with a side of hash browns and it was amazing! After that, I headed down to street to dollar general to resupply food for the next few days. Once I had gotten my food, I went to the outfitter to get some new shoes. I talked to the owner of the store and told him the problems I’d been having with my feet. He was super honest with me and told me he didn’t think I needed new shoes. He said he thought the blisters were from the wet weather we were having and the Achilles pain was just because I had been doing more miles. I really appreciated that he didn’t sell me a pair of shoes that he didn’t think I needed. I did buy a pair of socks because one of my pairs got a hole in it. I met some guys in town last night who I really liked talking to and they were planning on doing some light miles today.I was feeling good and had plenty of energy from breakfast, so I decided I would turn my zero into a Nero and do a few miles with them. I went back to the hostel and packed up my stuff. I made one last quick lunch of an alfredo knorr side and a peanut butter tortilla and was on my way. I met the guys in front of the outfitter and we were on our way! We were also hiking with Yak Trak and Heater, who I had met at the hostel. It was easy terrain and we were able to hit 11 miles, but because there was not much elevation change it didn’t put too much stress on our legs. We camped at spring mountain shelter, which wasn’t too bad, but some more hikers showed up after us which made the shelter pretty cramped. It was especially cramped because one of the hikers insisted that his dog sleep in the shelter, which was a little annoying because he slept longways and took up the space of at least a person and a half. We were planning to wake up early tomorrow and hike a little in the dark. This would allow one of the guys I was hiking with, sundried, to take a longer break in the middle of the day. His calf had been bothering him, so we were hoping the king break would be beneficial. 


3/21 


I woke up this morning at about 4:15 and woke up sundried, who had stayed next to me in the shelter. We got ready, but noticed that some of the others who were going to hike with us had not been stirring. I woke up yak trak and heater and they wanted to sleep in. Decap still came with us, but babs and pinkey also chose to stay behind and said they would catch up later. No problem. We were on the trail at about 5:30. I was glad to be up so we could get some miles done early. Today wasn’t too tough of a hike. We were making great time and arrived at little laurel shelter, where we were planning to take a break, around 9. We ate an early lunch and rested our legs for about an hour. We also met thru-hiker, Pots, who was eating breakfast and getting ready to head out. We were planning to go about 22 today, but sundried’s calf was bothering him still, so we didn’t want to push too hard. We would go 16 today instead and stay at Jerry’s Cabin Shelter. We only had about 7 miles to go after our break and it was only 10:30, so we were able to take it slow and enjoy some of the views. The weather was beautiful today and the views from Whiterock Cliff and Big Firescald Knob were really awesome. We made it to camp at about 2 and we’re actually able to all take a short nap upon arrival which was pretty nice. When I woke up, I made an early dinner of a ramen and instant potatoes and we waited for the rest of the group to arrive. They got to the shelter a little after 4 and shortly after we got a fire going. Pots hiked with them to the shelter, so I got to talk to him a little more. He’s a super friendly guy! We sat around the fire for a while and chatted and before we knew it it was time for bed. We are hoping to go 18 tomorrow. Hopefully Sundried is having a better time with his calf and that won’t be too difficult.

Another day of awesome weather today! We really have been blessed with this incredible weather so far. I was talking to a thru hiker from 2018 a week or so ago and he told me that that year, it rained basically every day for the first 2 weeks he was on trail. We have only had rain about 3 days so far! I mentioned that we were hoping to go 18 today, but I looked at my guide wrong. The shelter we wanted to make it to was only 16 miles away.  I also forgot to mention that we passed over the 300 mile mark yesterday. Pretty neat. We got a bit later of a start today. We were on trail at about 9, but that was okay. Since the time changed for daylight savings, we have been able to hike later into the day much more easily. I hiked with sun-dried and babushka today. Pinkey and Decap were with us, but they liked to hike a little faster, so they were a bit ahead. The hike was more difficult than expected today. It didn’t look like an incredible amount of elevation change, but the uphills were all pretty steep. We took a couple break when we needed it and made it to camp at about 4. Because we had been doing lighter miles the last few days, a few people from the hostel caught up to us. We met young chef, I.D., 2 tents, and pneumonia at the shelter. It was nice to see them again. We all chatted over dinner and then headed to our sleeping bags at about 8. Babushka, Sun-dried, Pinkey, Decap, and I were planning on getting up a little earlier tomorrow (about 6) because we were hoping to get 21 miles in to No Business Knob Shelter. From there we would only have 6 miles to go until Erwin, where we would resupply. There is also a Mexican restaurant in town. I have been craving Mexican food and the bottomless tortilla chips that come with it for the past 2 weeks and I cannot wait to indulge. 


3/23


Whew! Today was tough! It was almost perfect weather once again, but the terrain was tougher than I had expected and it was a long day of 21 miles. We got started at about 8:30. I was actually one of the last out of the camp. I always take a little while to pack everything up. Luckily, I caught heater relatively quickly and I hiked with her for a couple miles. We caught up to sun-dried and Babushka not to long after and I hiked with those 2 for the rest of the day. We hiked on and off with Donatello, pinkey, and Decap. The first 9 or so miles were mostly uphill, so our legs were tired early, but luckily the uphill led to a pretty sweet view on top of Big Bald. From there, it was largely downhill, which always seems to be more challenging than I prepare for. My knees felt strong today, but around mile 15 on the day my calf tightened up and bothered me a little for the rest of the day. I don’t think it’s anything to worry about, though. I stretched out well when we finally got to No Business Shelter around 5 and we are taking a pretty easy day tomorrow and only going about 10. The plan is to hike 6 miles to catch a shuttle into Erwin at 10, resupply, and then enjoy a meal at the Mexican restaurant there. Pinkey, Yak Trak, and Decap also have a bit of mail business to attend to. From there, we will hike just 4 more miles to the first shelter after Erwin, Curly Maple Gap Shelter. I will be dreaming of bottomless chips and enchiladas tonight.","

Pretty awesome day today! We woke up at 6:30 and started hiking at 7:30. It was a clear day and it was an easy 6 miles into Erwin. Once there, we got a shuttle to Food City for a resupply from Doug. He was friendly and super reasonably priced! We resupplied and I got some stuff that I’m super pumped to try out. I found some pesto paste that I’m going to put in some ramen and they had some cool tuna flavors that I haven’t tried before. We sat outside of food city for a bit and organized our food bags. My pack felt incredibly heavy with a full resupply in it. I definitely got more food than was necessary, but hopefully that will allow me to skip a resupply in Roan Mountain and I can make it to at least Hampton. We headed over to the post office after that. Yak got new shoes and so did Pinkey. Decap got a new pack. After that it was finally time for Mexican. I ordered the Enchiladas Supreme and had 2 baskets of tortilla chips to myself. It was the best. We walked out with full bellies and full hearts and made our way to Uncle Johnnies hostel where we sat for about an hour to let our food digest. It was only 4 more miles to the shelter we planned to stay at for the night, but it was largely uphill. It was challenging after such a big meal and with our packs fully loaded, but we made it in decent time. At the shelter were Ben (now Holiday), Santa, and Gramps. I had originally met Holiday and Gramps in Franklin and it was really nice to see them again. Tomorrow we are expecting rain, which is unfortunate, but we are due. Hoping to make it 22 miles to Clyde Smith Shelter. It would be a big day, but my legs have been feeling pretty good. No calf pain today and the Achilles is feeling strong. We are nearing the Roan highlands which I am super pumped for. Both because of the awesome views that they are said to bring and because the terrain is pretty flat. 


3/25 


Okay, so today did not go at all the way we had planned it. Sun-dried had been feeling under the weather the last couple of days, but woke up feeling really lousy. He wanted to get checked out at the doctors office in Erwin. About half of our group hiked on, but yak, heater, babushka, and I headed to Erwin with sun-dried. We hiked 4 miles to Indian grave gap, where we were picked up by Doug. He took us to the doctor and the rest of us walked to a coffee shop to wait while sun-dried was at the doctor. I just got a cup of coffee, but it was awesome! I don’t get to have hot coffee too often on trail. Sun-dried was out of the doctors in less than an hour and with great news! It was food poisoning, which doesn’t sound great, but it’s not contagious and he would likely be over it tomorrow. Much better than giardia or norovirus. After we got the news, we headed to super 8 where we were staying for the night. We were standing in the lobby and I honestly didn’t think we smelled THAT bad, but 2 ladies walked by holding their noses, so it was probably a good thing that we would be able to shower haha. The rest of the day was pretty uneventful. I got clean and did laundry and we made a quick stop at the nearby grocery store to grab some dinner. We were in bed early. Definitely had to take advantage of having a bed for the night. Tomorrow we are hoping Sun-dried will be feeling strong and we can make it to the shelter we had planned to stay at tonight, Clyde Mountain Shelter. 


3/26


Slept awesome last night! Sun-dried woke up still feeling a bit down, but much better than yesterday! We are still planning on hiking the 18 to Clyde Mountain Shelter today. We called on Doug one more time to give us a shuttle back to Indian Grave Gap and we were on trail by 9:30. It was another day of awesome weather. It stormed terribly yesterday afternoon and last night, so it actually ended up being the perfect day to sleep inside. Today’s hike wasn’t awful as far as elevation change went, but there were a few challenging hills. We didn’t hike fast today, but we made it to the shelter with time to spare and began to prepare dinner. Babushka made hot dogs for everyone which was super nice! We also got to enjoy a beautiful sunset from the shelter! The trees made it a little hard to see, but I think it was the best I’ve seen on the trail to date. We are expecting a good bit of rain tomorrow and hoping to make it to Stan Murray shelter. It’s only 13.7 miles away, but we need to stay in shelters right now because sun-drieds tent has a large hole and the new one won’t be with him until Damascus. Now worries though! We will push on Sunday.


3/27


Today was  much more difficult than we had anticipated. The hills didn’t look too bad on paper,  but our legs were feeling sluggish and worn down about half way through our hike. We tried to go quickly to beat the rain, but it caught up with us at probably the worst time. A giant hail and lightning storm came right to us while we were hiking on the balds of the Roan Highlands. Luckily, we only had a couple miles left to the shelter. We sprinted there as quickly as we could and made the shelter in a fairly short time. It was a good day to not push miles and I was relieved that we were only planning to go 14. Tomorrow we are planning to hike 20 miles to Mountaineer Falls Shelter. It was supposed to rain all day, but hopefully it wouldn’t be too hard of rain. The terrain doesn’t look bad and we will cross the 400 mile mark","

Today was probably the toughest day I’ve had yet on trail. It was pouring all day and we had finally reached the views that I’d been looking forward to in the Roan Highlands, but unfortunately they were not visible because of the storm. Winds on the bald were the most intense we’ve had yet without a doubt and made hiking very difficult. I also was just feeling a bit lousy today. I felt weak and my legs felt sore. It was a rough day and we didn’t make the 20 miles that we had hoped to. We only made it 11 to Station 19 E. I saw a bunch of my hiker friends there including Reset, Yipp, Lorax, Smiles, Peter Pan, Belle, and a few others. Some of them offered to split a room with me and I couldn’t resist. It had been an incredibly draining day and the room would only cost $15. The hostel was super nice. It was very clean and had a restaurant attached. I didn’t eat there because it was a bit pricy, but I heard the food was tasty! It was nice to see some faces that I wasn’t sure I’d see again and awesome to get a shower and bed. Really need to push some miles tomorrow. I’ll be heading out in the morning with heater. Hopefully we’d make it at least 20. 


3/29


Woke up feeling great this morning after sleeping in a bed. Felt even better after eating the massive breakfast they had prepared for us at 19 E. I had 2 fully plates and was full of energy and ready to hike! The hike started a bit slow because my stomach was so full, but soon heater and I found our pace and were cruising. We made it 14 by about 2 where we met yak who had been a bit ahead. From there, we went 4 more to Moreland Gap Shelter. We took a quick break for some food and stretching and continued on. The terrain today was super friendly and made for pretty quick miles. We decided we would just hike as far as we could and stealth camp when we were ready to drop. We made it about 23 before we were done, which I was pretty happy with. It was more than I expected to do today and made me feel a little better about how yesterday went. We also passed mile 400 today which served as a pretty near morale boost. We have a more difficult hike tomorrow, but another day of awesome weather. Hoping to make it to Vendeventer shelter about 20 miles away. If we are feeling awesome possible that we push to Iron Mountain shelter 26 miles away. That is not very likely though. 


3/30


Oh boy, today was more difficult than I had anticipated. The weather was nice, but it was the hottest day we have hiked in yet and there was not much shade. The sun really did a number on my energy levels. The terrain was also a bit more difficult than it appeared it was going to be on my guide app. I was super happy with the views today though! It was beautiful! We passed a couple waterfalls and there was a super cool section where we walked on a thin rock ridge line right next to the river. There was also a dam that looked over Watauga Lake and that was super cool. I was happy that the sights were nice today. It’s very rewarding to make it to a nice view after a tough climb. That’s another reason that hiking in the rain is more difficult. I will do all that I can to avoid hiking in the rain and it’s supposed to rain all day tomorrow. To stay out of the wet as much as I can, I am planning to wake up at 2 at start hiking as soon as possible to hopefully make it 7 miles to Iron Mountain Shelter before the rain really starts coming down. It’s supposed to start around 5, but it’s going to pick up around 6 and continue into the early morning. 


3/31 


Sleeping did not go super well last night. I couldn’t get to sleep, but it allowed me to start hiking even earlier than I had planned. I got out of my sleeping bag at about 1 and was on the trail by 1:30 in the morning. I was pretty sleepy but the hike went just as planned! I made it the 7 miles to the shelter by about 4 and it started to rain about 4:30. I was the only one at the shelter too, so I didn’t have to worry about waking others. I went to sleep and woke up at about 10. I woke up to yak arriving at the shelter. Heater arrived soon after him. They had planned to hike a total of 15 to the next shelter, but the rain was making them think twice. They elected to stay at the shelter and we began working on a fire to warm up and to dry out some of our wet items. It took a while to get the it started because all the wood was wet, but after about an hour we had a pretty good looking fire. We hung up our items as best we could near the fire and let them dry out as we continued to feed the fire and stretched out. We were all a little sore from the previous 2 days of hiking. It was a pretty uneventful day other than that. Around bed time 2 new hikers, great value and cheese curd showed up at the shelter. We were all just about to go to sleep, so we didn’t talk for too long. We are all planning to make it into Damascus tomorrow, so hopefully I’ll see them there! 


4/1


Super exciting day today! We had exactly 26.2 miles to get into Damascus which I really wanted to do because I was eager to get into town and also I thought it would be neat to hike a marathon. It would be my longest day yet! The terrain was also pretty favorable, so it was a perfect day to push. We woke up to below freezing temperatures and a surprising amount of snow. We knew it might snow a little, but there was enough to cover the trail which was a surprise. It was pretty chilly, but the snow covered trees and trail were beautiful! I was hiking with Yak and Heater again today. We got up around 6 and hit the trail at 7. We were hitting a good pace through the first shelter we ran across and took a quick break, but decided pretty quickly that that would be the last real break we took. The cold set in much more quickly when we were standing still. We had about 18 left to go and were feeling good! By the next shelter we only had 10 to go and only 6.5 of them were left in Tennessee. Tennessee had a lot to offer, but I was ready to be in my home state. With about 5 miles left we both started to feel pretty fatigued, but luckily the trail was mostly downhill from that point. Heater was a little behind. Yak and I used our secret weapon, caffeine mio, to power through the last few miles. We hit the VA border with 3.5 miles to go and from that point on the miles were easy! So pumped to be in Virginia!! When we arrived in Damascus we stopped by the post office to grab a resupply for Yak, dropped our stuff at the hostel, and then went straight to dinner where I ordered a large burger and an order of wings. That hit the spot. I went to bed feeling incredibly satisfied. I’m staying at the broken fiddle tonight and my parents are coming in tomorrow morning when I will be taking a zero. Excited to get to catch up with them!Also going to add some photos to my VSCO while I’m in town Link: https://vs.co/58298acb","

Started today a little late, but that was no problem! It was a zero day after all. I didn’t do much except hang around the hostel until around 11 when I met my parents at the place they are staying, the Dragonfly Inn. I was super happy to see them and to see my dog, Samson, who they had brought with them! From there. We headed to the Damascus Diner for lunch. It was awesome! I got the fish fry, which was very tasty. After that, I resupplied at dollar general. I also got some epsom salt there for a bath back at the Inn. It wasn’t a busy day, but as all zero days seem to, it went by quickly. Not much happened until dinner. We ate at Pizza Plus. It was quite the place. The food was fair, but I really liked the cooks haircut. It seemed to have been inspired by Billy Ray Cyrus. Very classy stuff. After dinner, we returned to the Dragonfly Inn where I had a large pullout couch waiting for me. I was planning on slack packing tomorrow and had to get up sort of early. I was going to slack pack the 22.5 miles from Whitetop Road and the shuttle was at 6:30.  I laid down and almost immediately fell asleep.


4/3


I woke up after getting an amazing night of sleep. I got up at about 5:45 and got ready for the day which didn’t take too long because all I was bringing on my slack pack was about 2 liters of water, my filter, a little bit of food, a few first aid items, my rain jacket, and the clothes I was wearing. I walked to the broken fiddle where I had stayed on Thursday night because the owner, Treehouse, was the one shuttling me. The shuttle ended up being a little bit late, but it wasn’t a huge deal. I was able to eat the pancakes that pizza cutter had made for everyone and I was able to talk to some other hikers a bit more which is always nice. The shuttle left just before 8, which would still give me the time I needed to get back before I had to get my Covid vaccination that was scheduled for 5:15 in Johnson city. The drive took just over half an hour and I was walking before 8:40. I would need to boogie to make it back to Damascus on time, but I was confident. Slack packing is just so much faster than hiking with a full pack. It was a nice hike back to Damascus. There weren’t a ton of views, but the ones that I did pass were spectacular. The view from the top of buzzard rock was particularly nice. The weather today was awesome and provided clear views all day. I also enjoyed the short time the Virginia Creeper Trail and the AT intersected. It was a gravel trail which was a little tough on my feet, but it traveled right next to a stream the whole time which I thought was pretty cool. I ended up making it back to Damascus more quickly than I expected to and was back at the Dragonfly Inn after grabbing a super quick lunch from a gas station restaurant by 3. I took a shower, got changed, and soon my dad and I were on our way to Johnson City for my vaccination. I was getting the Johnson and Johnson shot which I was excited for because I’d be done after only one shot, but I was a little worried about potential side effects. I will let everyone know if I experience any. The shot was super easy, though, and pretty soon we were on the way back to Damascus to get my mom and go to dinner. We were planning to get dinner and then go to the Easter vigil at a church in Abington. The vigil was a little earlier than we had realized, so we had to quickly change plans and ended up getting dinner at Burger King, but it wasn’t bad! I got a ton of food for super cheap, so I was happy. We made it to the vigil and it was a nice service! It was nice to be able to be back in a church after not being able to go yet on trail. When we got back to the Inn, we watched the end of the Gonzaga v UCLA basketball game, which was super exciting and called my brother, Ryan. I’m glad we got the chance to catch up with him as a family. After that, it was pretty late and time to get to sleep. Tomorrow we would get breakfast at the diner across the street and then drive to Whitetop road, where I had started my slack pack earlier and I would get dropped off.

I got another great night of sleep last night at the Inn and was feeling ready to get back out hiking. Breakfast came first, though. I got a large breakfast with fried chicken, eggs, biscuits, gravy, and hash brown casserole. It was delicious! My dad got the same thing and my mom got oatmeal with fruit. After we were done eating, we got on the road. I was sad to say goodbye to my parents and Samson, but I was excited to get out hiking again and I was super thankful for the chance I got to see them. Today I would enter the Grayson highlands, which I had been looking forward to since before I started and I would also hit mile 500 which I was super pumped to reach. The weather today was perfect. It was maybe the prettiest day of weather on trail and it came on the perfect eyes. The highlands exceeded expectations and the wild highland ponies were super neat! I saw way more than I expected to and most of them were super close to the trail. I probably saw 25 in all. I didn’t really have any side effects from the vaccine other than I felt pretty tired at times. It felt like I was getting drained a bit faster than usual, but that could have also just been me getting readjusted to my pack from my slack pack yesterday.  It took me a little while, but I finally made it to old orchard shelter at about 6. I met Sarge, a retired NYPD Sargent. He was really nice. We made a fire and chatted until yak trak and heater showed up at about 7. It was just us at the shelter tonight. It was a nice shelter with a bear box which was so convenient after having been forced to hang bear hangs in most of Tennessee.","

I slept well in the shelter last night. It was just me and sarge in the shelter and he was a very quiet sleeper. Today we were either going to stealth camp around 20 miles from the shelter or make it to partnership shelter about 24 miles away. There was promise of deliverable pizza at partnership, so that lit a fire within us. We felt a little sluggish through 8, but once we ate a little lunch we were feeling a lot better. The next 6 miles to Trimpi shelter felt pretty good. We stopped there for a quick second lunch and water break and once we started on the last 10, we didn’t stop. Pizza was on the mind and the only thing that could quench our thirst for pizza was hiking. We cruised almost through partnership shelter and straight to the landline at mt Rogers visitor center where yak and I ordered a large pizza with sausage, mushrooms, and green peppers and 20 wings. We headed back to camp and set up our sleeping gear and chatted with some hikers who were also staying at the shelter. Pizza cutter was there along with some hikers I’d met recently including scrambled, Josh, and professor. Heater, Great Value, and Cheese Curd showed up just a little after us too. I was happy to see them. Before long, Yak and I went back to the visitor center to pick up our food and returned to the campground to eat it. It was some of the best pizza I’ve ever eaten. We devoured the wings and the pizza and sat around talking to other hikers for a while. Many of them had also ordered pizza. We went to bed extremely satisfied with both the mileage we had accomplished and the food in our bellies.

Woke up feeling great this morning. It was so warm last night, I was able to sleep in shorts. Most of the night I slept with only my bag liner. I was still kind of full from last night, so I only had a pop tart and clif bar for breakfast today (no oatmeal). There wasn’t too much of a plan today, but both yak and I agreed we wouldn’t push. We were both sore after yesterday. The day started with a pretty tough climb, but after the first few miles it was pretty smooth sailing. We made it to the first shelter 7 miles away and take lunch. I had couscous with tuna. We hiked on after lunch and stopped at a pretty school one room schoolhouse museum. It was a one roomed school that was in use until 1939. They left it open all year and it was pretty neat to get to see inside. We stretched out there for a bit and then moved along. The weather was nice today, but I could feel the heat of the sun burning me. I need a do a better job applying sunscreen. We made close to Atkins and to an Exxon station with a Mexican restaurant attached. I ordered some steak nachos and guacamole for $4(!) and they had it out to me in under 5 minutes. It was incredible. I waited there while Yak went to a nearby hostel to retrieve a resupply package. We had also received word earlier in the day from trail angels Lynn,  Maureen, and Lynn that they wanted to take us out to dinner and put us up in the cabin they had rented for the next few days. How amazing! They would pick us up for dinner at 6. I read a little of Grandma Gatewood’s book, which was super interesting. If you aren’t familiar with Grandma Gatewood, it’s a amazing story that I highly recommend you give a quick Google.  While we were waiting, great value, Josh, and cheese curd showed up. We’ve been around them for a few days now and I’m really enjoying hiking with them! Super nice guys to talk to. Before too long, it was time for us to go to dinner. We went to a local restaurant in Marion. They used all local ingredients and it was fantastic! I got a chicken sandwich. We all talked about our hiking experiences. It was interesting to hear their experiences on the sections of the AT that they had completed. After dinner, Yak and I were driven to their cabin. It was awesome there! We got our own room and a shower. We quickly took showers. They were amazing and once we got clean, we went out to the main room to chat more with the Lynn’s and Maureen Before too long Yak and I went to bed. We were tired and eager for a night of sleep in a bed. 


4/7


I woke up feeling refreshed after an amazing night of sleep at the cabin. Yak and I woke up to an amazing breakfast of ham, eggs, toast, orange juice, and coffee from our gracious hosts. The eggs were from Maureen’s chickens and they were awesome! After breakfast, Lynn drove us back to where we had been picked up the day before. Today Yak and I were planning on hiking about 20 miles to a stealth camping site. The day had a few difficult looking climbs, but it didn’t look like it would be too tough of terrain. Early into the day, we arrived at the 1/4 way sign which was super exciting!! We have made it a fourth of the way to Katahdin! Soon after, we ran into cheese curd, who we were happy to see. He hikes super fast, so he was taking a break, but we’d told him we’d see him later because we knew he would catch up. He was also planning on hiking to the campsite Yak and I had decided on. We hiked on and the sun started to become a factor soon after. There wasn’t much shade today. It was a beautiful day with walks through open fields and pastures, but the sun sucked the energy right out of us. It made the climbs more challenging and I could feel myself getting burnt even though I kept reapplying sunblock. We took lunch in a shady spot with a view over a cow pasture. It was an amazing lunch view and provided us with a relaxing break from the sun. We sat down for a bit and chatted with Rocky too and Nemesis, the couple who is hiking from key west to Quebec. We have been running into them a lot the last few days. They are over 2000 miles into their 4500 mile trek. Super neat.  After lunch, the trail continued to surprise us with how draining it was. I just have to get used to the sun I think. We continued on and by the time we finally made it to the campsite we were exhausted. I quickly set up my hammock, made dinner, and went to bed. I was going to sleep well tonight. 


4/8 


Woke up after a very solid night of sleep in my hammock last night. I was wiped out after yesterday’s hike and slept very soundly. I was feeling well rested and was ready to take on the 4 mile uphill we had to start the day. It was another day of great weather, but I had gotten burned pretty bad on my legs yesterday. I decided I’d hike in tights for as long as I could stand it to prevent the burn from getting worse. The uphill looked pretty nasty on paper, but once we got started it wasn’t actually too bad. It was steep for a couple miles, but it leveled out and provided awesome views for the last 2. The hike after that was actually tougher than it looked on the elevation map. It looked like it was going to be pretty flat, but it was actually small, constant ups and downs that were covered in downed trees and rocks. Once we reached the end of that rocky 6 mile stretch we (yak, cheese curd, great value, and myself) took a pretty long lunch break. We were more tired than we thought we’d be and decided we would turn the 20 mile day we expected to do today into a 15 mile day. There was a shelter in 5 miles we could stop at. It was also supposed to rain and stopping there would allow us to avoid getting all our clothes wet. Those last 5 miles weren’t too bad, but once we got to the shelter we were pretty exhausted and ready to be done for the day. We sat and talked for a while. Both with one another and with the other hikers who started to show up. We saw pizza cutter, heater, my way, rock shox, scrambled, and we met Shagga and Rocket man who I hadn’t met yet. We slept in the shelter and were pleasantly surprised with the lack of mice there.

Today was a pretty exciting day. The plan was to hike 20 miles to VA route 601 where I would get picked up by my friend from high school, Josh, and we would go to Virginia tech for the night to see some friends. We got on trail at about 8 and the weather was amazing once again! It was a pretty flat hike today and the miles were coming pretty quickly. We made it almost 12 miles to our lunch break by noon and were feeling good. On our break we met a motorcyclist who was driving a stretch of dirt and gravel roads from Orlando to Maryland. I don’t know the first thing about motorcycles, but that sounded pretty cool to me! Just about 8 more miles until I was done for the day and we would be just past mile 600! To be honest, the 100 mile increments are getting a little less exciting though. The next one I’ll be super excited about is 1,000. I got to the pickup location a little earlier than I needed to, but I was glad to be able to sit down and stretch for a little before I was in the car for almost an hour. Josh came and picked me up. It was awesome to get to see him and then when we arrived at tech I got to see a lot more of my friends. A couple of my roommates were there along with some other friends from high school. I hadn’t seen them since I had left, so we had a good bit to catch up on. We talked all night. It was so nice to hear what everyone was up to and to share what I had been doing. Seems like everyone had been having a great time!","

About 11 miles into pearisburg today


4/12
24 miles to Bailey Gap shelter (kinda) there was an about 14 mile closure for downed power lines. We tried to hike through it, but were turned back. We had to shuttle around the closure which was unfortunate, but we heard something like this happens every year. Hopefully this is the only closure that impacts us. We hiked about 10 miles, but traveled 24 trail miles because of the closure.


4/13
21 miles to Sarver Hollow Shelter. Super nice shelter! It was down a steep hill .4 off trail, but it was large, dry, and mouse free!


4/14
About 17 miles to pickle branch shelter. We are starting to run into some flip-flop hikers. Flip-floppers are hikers that start out one direction, make it about half way, and then switch directions. They usually do this to avoid large crowds or in an attempt to hit more favorable weather. We met flip-floppers Jammin, Sunrise, and Anvil tonight.


4/15
Hiked 23 miles to Lamberts Meadow Shelter. Today was awesome! Our group hiked the “triple crown” which is a series of 3 of the most incredible views in Virginia. It consists of dragons tooth, McAfee Knob, and Tinker Cliffs. It was a tough day, but the views made it well worth it. Probably my favorite day of hiking so far. The weather was clear, but not too hot and provided amazing views all day. Also crossed over 700 miles today!","

Today we just did 11 miles into Daleville to meet Yak’s dad and dog. On the way, we passed by the 1/3 completion mark. Super exciting!! Yak and his father were going to allow us to stay in a hotel room with them for the night! We did our 11 miles pretty quickly and met Yaks father, who treated us all to lunch at 3 lil pigs, a bbq spot. It was delicious! I got a bbq sandwich with potato salad on the side. After that, we headed to the hotel room where we were all able to shower. The shower was much needed after a few very warm and very sweaty days of hiking. We all took full advantage of the hotel water pressure and hot water. Much better than that of some of some hostels. After our showers, we did laundry and went to Kroger to resupply for the next few days. We also stopped by an outfitter. Cheese curd got new shoes. I was hoping to try on a few pairs, but they didn’t have my size. No big deal though. After we finished shopping, we headed back to the hotel, grabbing some dinner from McDonald’s on the way back. Once we got back, we finished our laundry, watched a little bit of basketball, and were in bed before too long.


4/17
Great Value, Cheese Curd, and I got dropped off by Yak’s dad in the morning. The plan was to do a couple of short days so that Yak could catch up after the zero he would be taking today. Today we would go about 11 to Wilson Creek Shelter. It wasn’t a long or very hard day, so we had a very relaxed day of hiking. We took many breaks and most of them were pretty lengthy. Days like this are nice, but they also feel a little slow. When all there is to do is hike, it’s hard to take a bunch of long breaks and not feel like the day is being wasted. It was a nice day though and we found a really nice spot to take lunch right next to a spring. We made it to the shelter pretty early and were pleasantly surprised to see that Midnight was camping there too. He is a music teacher from Maine and a super nice dude. We set up our stuff and made dinner. We also met 2 flip floppers who just recently started nobo and don’t yet have trail names. Before too long, it started to get dark and we got into our sleeping bags and chatted a bit before falling asleep.


4/18
We planned on another pretty short day today. About 14 miles to Cove Mountain Shelter. Before too long, the plan changed slightly. We heard from other hikers that carpenter bees had overtaken the shelter, so we would go just a tenth of a mile further to a view that had a small campsite near it. We would meet Yak at the campsite.  It was another pretty relaxed day, but luckily there were a ton of views along the way. We were hiking right across the Blue Ridge Parkway which provided many spots to take a break and enjoy a view. It’s a little easier to take a slow day when there’s a ton of awesome views to stop at. I’ve been listening to the Lord of the Rings on audio book for about a week now and I’m enjoying it! I made a lot of progress on the book today. I can only really listen on downhills and flat though. If I try to listen when I’m walking uphill, I usually lose track of the story. I didn’t see Cheese curd and Great Value too much today. Some days we hike the whole day together, but other times we are all moving at different paces. I saw them when we took lunch, but other than that I was mostly alone today. I arrived at the campsite just before Cheese Curd and it was nicer than either of us had expected. Plenty of space to set up. We set up our sleeping areas and got changed and then headed over to the view to make dinner and wait for the sun to set. I made a knorr rice side and before too long, Great Value showed up. He joined up for dinner and we chatted for a while. Yak showed up just in time to catch the sunset. It was largely hidden by the clouds, but it was still super pretty. After dinner and the sunset, we returned to our campsite and made a fire. It wasn’t too cold, but it’s always nice to sit around a fire. We tended the fire for probably an hour, but it was getting late. We let the fire die and headed off to bed.","

Today we planned to hike 17 miles to Thunder Hill Shelter. We were going to stay in Glasgow in 2 days because I needed to register for my classes in the fall. There was a hostel there that would allow me to use their computer. Today’s hike is wasn’t too long, but it was tiring. There was a large 4-peaked climb that ended at Apple Orchard Mountain. The climbs were tough and the view at the top was a little disappointing, but there was a weather radar station on the top that was kind of interesting to look at. There was a cool rock formation today. It is called the guillotine. It’s a giant rock that fell into a large rock crevice and it’s now hanging on overhead. Soon after the guillotine, we reached Thunder Hill Shelter. Silver Tongue, Cool Enough, and Garrett were also camping there. We also met flip-flopper, Chippin’ Away. She was super friendly! I made a large dinner of a knorr side, ramen pack, and tuna, and went to bed shortly after. 


4/20


First kind of gross mouse encounter last night. I had been pleasantly surprised with the lack of mice I’d been seeing and hearing. They knew my guard was low and they struck when I was expecting it least. I was sound asleep, but woke up suddenly when I felt something on my head. It started moving around on my head and I freaked out and flung it across the shelter. I felt a little bad for sort of throwing the mouse, but I saw him run away and he seemed okay. I suppose I am in his house, but I wish he wouldn’t have climbed onto my head. I hope this does not happen again. Today we were hiking about 15 miles into Glasgow. I was staying at the Stanimals Hostel for the night. The hike was pretty easy today and largely downhill. I met another flip-flopper on the way into town. He had already completed the northern half and had just recently started sobo from Harpers Ferry in West Virginia. Soon after, I caught my first view of the James River. It was cool to see the river that runs through my hometown. Not much later, I crossed the river over via the longest footbridge on the AT. I was lucky to catch a hitch into town just as I was walking to the road. Saved me a 1.5 mile road walk! I walked to stanimals hostel where I saw cheese curd and met the hostel manager, Charlie. He showed me around the place, which was super nice! There was a full kitchen and he explained that he made breakfast in the morning and dessert at 8 every night. Sounded awesome to me! After the tour, I went to get dinner at the local restaurant, Scotto’s. It was great! After dinner, I did a resupply at dollar general and then headed back to the hostel to organize my schedule and find classes for the fall. I spent a couple hours figuring out my preferred schedule and then it was time for dessert! Charlie made cinnamon-blueberry cake that was super tasty! My plan for tomorrow was to lock in my classes when that became available to me at 12:35 and then get a shuttle to the James River Bridge where I was picked up earlier today. I made sure this was okay with Charlie and then headed off to bed. 


4/21


Today was a short hiking day. I woke up at about 8 and ate a delicious breakfast of pancakes and sausage that Charlie had prepared. After that, I showered and made sure that most of the classes I was planning to take were still available. I also shaved my beard off. It was getting to be pretty nasty and I was tired of dealing with it. I had to make some changes to my schedule, but ended up being able to get most of the classes I wanted to. Charlie was more busy than he expected to be today, so I was not able to get a shuttle back until a little after 3. Yak, Cheese curd, and Great Value were hiking 19. I was going to try to catch them, but it was not at all likely that I’d be able to make it that far this late in the day. I ended up making it about 10 miles to punch bowl shelter. There was still some daylight left, but not close to enough to make it another 9 miles. Tonight I camped with Distress, a hiker that o had met at the hostel. I’d push tomorrow and try to catch my group then.

Today was super tough! I needed to go 25 miles to Steeley-Woodworth Shelter. There was a lot of upward elevation on the day, but I left pretty early and was confident I’d be able to make it. The first 8 miles or so weren’t too bad and warmed up my legs well for the intimidating climb coming up. We also passed mile 800 about 2 miles in! The climb was almost 3000 feet up over about 4 miles. I’d heard from Cheese Curd that this was a tough climb and was absolutely right. I was exhausted when I reached the top. I had about 12 miles to go, but luckily the terrain ahead didn’t appear to be too difficult. I moved pretty slowly after the long climb, but I made it to the shelter around 6. It actually snowed on my a little bit in the last few miles which was very unexpected. Unfortunately, my group wasn’t there. We haven’t had good service, so it’s been tough to communicate with them. Hoping I’ll catch up soon. I ended up having the shelter all to myself, which is kind of nice, but also a little spooky. It was very windy and cold tonight. I ate dinner from my sleeping bag and only left to hang up my pack for the night. It would be tough to get out in the morning I’m sure. Hoping to make it 20 to Maupin Field Shelter tomorrow.","

Skeeter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636351,"Sorry for the lack of updates recently, I kind of lost motivation to journal for a little bit. I had a patch of rough days that took it out of me, but a lot has happened since my last update and I’m feeling much better now! I am currently at mile 1025 and have made it to the (unofficial) half way point, Harpers Ferry! Since my last update, I visited my friends in Harrisonburg for a couple days, made it through Shenandoah National Park, and reached mile 1000! It was awesome to get to see my roommates and other friends in Harrisonburg, but after spending a couple days at my apartment it was tough to get back onto the trail. My allergies also were giving me a lot of trouble once I got back out there. I was feeling a little burnt out and unmotivated and having a hard time continuing my hike. After a few allergy-ridden days, I took a much needed break in Luray at Open Arms Hostel. I got a bunch of allergy medication at Walmart and talked a lot with hikers Mosie, Killer, and the hostel owner, Alison. They were a huge help and helped me get re-motivated to hike. After that day and a great night of sleep, I was ready to get back on the trail and pump out some miles! I hiked through the Shenandoahs with Silver Tongue, Coup, and Cool Enough. I was a little behind Yak, Cheese Curd, and Great Value after my time at my apartment, but I was having a great time with these guys and I would catch up to my guys before too long. I definitely caught the “Virginia Blues” at the tail end of my time in the state. I didn’t think I would fall victim to them, but they hit me like a truck in the Shenandoahs. I was so pumped to get out of the state. It helped motivate me to push larger miles and I actually hiked my longest day yet (26.5) just a few days ago! I’m hoping to hit a 30 pretty soon. I am currently sitting in Harpers Ferry after an awesome lunch at Cannonball Deli and an incredible cup of coffee at the Coffee Mill. I am super excited to spend the night with a friend of my Moms, Marcy. She lives nearby and has graciously offered to host me for the night! I am so, so happy to be out of Virginia and the funk that I was in. Super excited to get hiking and make it through some more states!","

Started today off feeling very well rested after an awesome stay with the Walker family. I was driven back to the trail by their oldest son, Nathan after a breakfast sandwich they prepared for me. Marcy also sent me on my way with a sandwich for lunch which i greatly appreciated. The day started off with 3 miles of a supremely flat bike trail. That was very nice and got my legs warmed up well for the day. I was planning to hike about 23 miles to Pine Knob shelter. I entered Maryland early in the day and didn’t even notice until I saw a Ridge runner who told me I had crossed the border a few miles back. Cool! My first day in Maryland was great! All the shelters I passed were crazy nice with large windows and varnished wood floors. The terrain in Maryland was terrific! It was a tiny bit rocky in places, but for the most part, it was rockless and mostly flat. About half way through my day I ran into Ron, a section hiker that I had met back in the Shenandoahs. We ended up hiking together for a few miles until he reached Dahlgren Campground where he planned to spend the night. He was finished his section hike tomorrow, so we said our goodbyes and I continued on. The last 6 or so miles to Pine Knob went by quickly. When I arrived, there was only one other hiker in the shelter. His name was Cloud. He was hiking with his dog, Raindrop. They were very friendly and we chatted over a fire and dinner. It was just the three of us until about 7 when Cowboy, who I have been hiking around for a couple weeks now rolled in. He joined in on the fire chat, but before too long we were ready for bed and went to sleep.

Today I was planning to hike about 23 miles to Deer Lick Shelters. I would pass the Mason-Dixon Line and enter Pennsylvania on the way there which I was super excited to reach. Maryland had been great, but it was always a fantastic feeling to enter a new state. The day was another flat one which I was grateful for and the weather was clear with a pretty moderate temperature. It was easy hiking today and I was able to take a couple breaks along the way and enjoy a couple views. The views haven’t been as nice the last few days, but trees are super green now and the contrast of the leaves against the blue sky is beautiful! Towards the end of the day I met Trebek, a hiker who was completing the 4 state challenge today. This was a challenge where hikers hiked through the last mile of VA, all of WV, all of MD, and into PA. It was 44 miles total of hiking in under 24 hours and quite the accomplishment. I walked with him into PA and a little further to the campsite where he would be sleeping. Super cool! I was now in Pennsylvania and feeling great! I made it to the Deer Lick Shelters around 6 and there I met hikers Turtlehawk, Landslide, and Soma. I found out that Soma was actually from Harrisonburg, where I go to school which was pretty neat. Cowboy arrived a bit later and we all sat around the fire that Turtlehawk had made and ate dinner. Today was a super satisfying day of hiking and I fell asleep quickly. 


5/7


Today I woke up to a steady rain outside. Never a good start to the day, but we had been lucky with great weather recently, so it was about time we had some rain. The streams had also been a little drier recently, so this would make it a little easier to get water too. The rain wasn’t too heavy, but the rain combined with the fact that there was a burger spot less than a quarter mile off trail convinced me to take a short day. Cowboy and I planned to hike 16 miles total, stopping to resupply and get some burgers in Fayetteville along the way. The burgers were awesome!! I also got a little bit of ice cream that the burger place had gotten from a local creamery. Awesome stuff! After lunch, it was still raining and we were feeling a bit sluggish, but we slowly made our way to Quarry Gap Shelter. We arrived and were super impressed with the shelter! Definitely one of, if not the nicest shelter I have stayed in to date. It wasn’t huge, but it had a super nice covered picnic area and the water was very close to the shelter and bountiful. At the shelter I met flip-flop hiker, Bo and 4 section hikers that I didn’t catch the names of. They were all very kind! We sat under the covered areas waiting for the rain to stop and eating our dinners, but it never did. We went to bed early because it was getting cold and we really didn’t have much else to do. I would hopefully wake up feeling refreshed after a very full night of sleep.

Today was going to be a super exciting day. I was planning to hike about 24 miles to James Fry Shelter. On the way there, I would cross the official half way point on the AT! I was super excited. I would also pass over 1100 miles total and get to Pine Grove Furnace State Park, where I would attempt the “half gallon challenge”. This was a challenge that was tradition to attempt at the halfway point. I was going to try to eat a half gallon of ice cream which is one of those large “quart” size ice cream containers (actually 1.5 quarts) and a pint alongside that. The hike started out great! It was a little rainy, but I hit some trail magic of a Gatorade about 3 miles in which really boosted my mood and gave me a little kick of energy to get through the next few miles. I was elated when I found out that there was MORE Gatorade about 10 mile away. So awesome! The rain was on and off for the next few hours as I continued to hike. It was a little annoying, but it was never all that heavy. It could have been much worse. I reached the second Gatorade cache and was feeling great! Before too long, I made it to the halfway sign. It felt amazing! I can’t believe I’m halfway done! Looking back at how far I have come and how much stronger I have gotten over the last 2 months and change is surreal. I had a few more miles to go until I would have to attempt the half gallon challenge. I was excited to try it, but I was also dreading what it would do to my body. I had 7 miles left to hike after eating my ice cream and I was confident that would be a very difficult 7 miles. I arrived at the general store at the park and stared down my opponent: a quart and a half of mint chocolate chip ice cream and a pint of chocolate chip cookie dough. I knew it would tear up my insides, but I was determined to come out on top. I let my ice cream sit for about 20 minutes as I mentally prepared for the task ahead of me and then there was nothing left to do but get started. I felt pretty piggish as I sat by myself and took on this mass of ice cream while day hikers peered over in disgust. About half way through my ice cream, Pixie, a hiker that I’d been around for a little while now came to my table and started her own attempt at the challenge. It was tough and I slowed down quite a bit towards the end, but I was able to finish in 28 minutes. I was happy with the time, but I felt pretty gross once I finished. I sat around for a while thinking about what I had done and preparing for the hike ahead. I chatted with Pixie as she attempted to eat her ice cream. Unfortunately, she came up a bit short, but it was a valiant effort. After about an hour of letting my stomach settle, I decided it was time to get hiking. It wasn’t a pleasant hiking experience, but I made it to the shelter in one piece. Once there, I met 2 section hikers who were hiking 250 miles for a senior project. Very neat project! I also met flip floppers Rance and Klaus. Today was another pretty early night. We are on a bit of a cold night streak, so I got into my bag early to stay warm and get to sleep. Tomorrow I’d be staying with another college roommate of my mothers, Melicia in Boiling Springs which I am super excited for!","

Today was great! I woke up early and hiked 12 miles into boiling springs where I was met by Melicia’s parents. They drove me to Melicia’s house where I met her family and brother. I got a quick shower which was awesome and then I went downstairs where lunch was ready! They had made a large spread of Mac and cheese, grilled chicken, asparagus, and other tasty food. I chowed down and we all swapped stories for a while. After a few hours, Melicia’s parents and brother left. I called my parents and then watched some TV with Melicia’s family. Our large lunch kept us full for a while, but we ended up ordering from a nearby restaurant. I got a chicken sandwich that was incredible! I went to sleep soon after dinner. I’m so thankful for the relaxing day at Melicia’s and for all the kindness they showed me while I was visiting.

I felt great this morning leaving Melicia’s! I slept awesome and was getting lucky again. My Aunt Ann and her husband would be taking me out to breakfast! I hadn’t seen her in a long time, so it was nice to catch up after not seeing each other in so long. We went to Cafe 101, a restaurant in boiling springs. I got French toast that was pretty delicious. After eating and chatting for a while, Aunt Ann dropped me off back at the trail. I got a later start than usual, but I thought if I really booked it I would be able to make it the 25 miles to Duncannon. The terrain wasn’t bad and the weather was beautiful! I made it through the first 17 or so miles without a hitch, but Right around then I hit a wall. There was a big hill that really challenged me. I almost opted to stop early at a shelter with about 6 miles to go, but I pushed through it and finally made it into Duncannon! I ordered a sandwich at a nearby deli, ate, and quickly set up at a nearby campground and fell asleep. I was exhausted! 


5/11


Today I took an unplanned zero in Duncannon. I ate breakfast at goodies diner, which was so, so good and then decided I’d spend another night in Duncannon before the rocks started to get bad. Pennsylvania was famously rocky and it was supposed to get worse after this town. My feet had been pretty sore, so I thought an extra day off would do me well. I’d stay at the hostel in town, kind of outdoorsy. It was a super nice hostel. The bunks all had their own curtains, so there was a decent amount of privacy and there was a light and an outlet above my bed, so I was able to read. I was also able to soak my feet in an epsom salt bath. I did a lot of sitting today between reading a book I had picked up from a free mini library. It was a cheesy murder mystery, but I still enjoyed it. I also watched the new Mortal Kombat movie which was exactly what I expected. Not the best acting or writing, but the action scenes were entertaining. I met some more flip floppers at the hostel. Olive oil, Klaus, and Hot Sauce. We all got dinner together at the Duncannon pub which was pretty tasty and clearly a local hot spot. It was packed. We finished eating and walked back to the hostel. I went to bed pretty shortly after that. I was exhausted!


5/12-5/19


Very eventful week on the AT! I hiked about 21 miles out of Duncannon on the 12th and set up at a pretty neat small campground. I made a fire and sat around it, but I was the only one there so I went to bed pretty early that night. The next morning, I ran into Midnight early on and we hiked the rest of the day together and have been together since. That first day we were together, I hiked 24 miles to 501 shelter where midnight and I camped. 


The next morning, we resuppied in Pine Grove and got a hitch back to the trail by a nice man named Pete. We ended up hiking into Port Clinton that night and the next day I took an unexpected zero again when I twisted my ankle upon starting the climb out of Port Clinton. Midnight decided to also take a zero, which was nice. I iced my ankle and did very little other than that until dinner when midnight and I met Kikko and Peps at a nearby diner for dinner. We planned to hike out of Port Clinton together tomorrow.
The next day, we left town and hiked to Allentown Hiking Club Shelter. It was a nice hike with a couple pretty views, but the rocks of PA were starting to become much more cumbersome.The following day was very cool. We planned to hike about 18 miles to GW Outerbridge Shelter, but midnight informed us that there was a lady that lived just .8 further down the trail who would allow hikers to camp in her yard. Her name was Squeaks and she was super nice! She let us take showers and camp in her yard which we greatly appreciated. She lived at the base of Blue Mountain Ridge, which was a pretty intimidating climb. We were happy to get a little closer to the mountain before starting on our way up.We started today by going up Blue Mountian Ridge which was exactly as steep as it looked. It involved a decent amount of “scrambling” and I had to use my hands to help me up the rocks most of the way. It was a little scary at times, but it was a super fun climb! Much different from most of the rest of the trail. From there, we hiked about 18 more miles to a campsite just before Wind Gap. Tomorrow we would enter New Jersey! 
Today’s hike was great! We got up early to try to beat the heat some and ended up in the town of Delaware water gap at about 2! The hike had a few views over the Delaware River and tons and tons of rocks. The rocks had gotten progressively worse as we made our way through PA and today was no exception. They would continue into New Jersey at least for a little bit, but I was glad to be getting out of Pennsylvania. In Delaware Water Gap we took a little break at a bakery that had the “true love special” of a hot dog and a slice of apple pie for $3. It was amazing! We hung around the bakery for a bit and then said goodbye to Kikko. She was taking a few days off to see her family in New Jersey. Before too much longer. Peps, Midnight, and I left Delaware water gap, crossed into New Jersey, and made it about 4 miles into the state to a large campsite with a gorgeous sunset view!","

5/20

This week was great! I hiked most of the week with Peps and midnight. Kikko was at home seeing family and nursing a minor foot injury. On the 20th, the three of us hiked from the hiker campsite at mile 1300 to brink road shelter at mile 1320. It was an awesome first day of hiking in Jersey. The rocks of Pennsylvania were still around, but they weren’t as constant. The weather was great and the elevation change was minimal. An amazing day all around! Cowboy also hiked with us today. We got our first chance to go for a little swim at Crater Lake! It was super hot and jumping into the water for a little bit was so refreshing! After the lake, we hiked 5 more miles to the shelter. At the shelter, I met hikers Rat and Papa. Colgate was also there. I hadn’t seen him for a few days, so I was happy to run into him!5/21
Today was super hot! The temperature has been gradually rising as we get closer to summer and today was the hottest day we have had yet. I think the highest the temperature got was 87 degrees, but it felt so much hotter. I am not excited for the temperature to continue to rise as summer gets closer. The water sources in New Jersey have also been a bit spotty. I made sure to drink plenty, but I had to carry more than I would have wanted ideally. Water is super heavy and carrying a bunch of it is a bit annoying. It was hot today, but I was thankful for the flat terrain. The rocks are also starting to thin out. My feet and I are looking forward to tomorrow, when the rocks are supposed to show up even less. After a long day of hiking, we arrived at High Point Shelter. We hiked about 20 miles today and I met hiker Grumpy Cat at the shelter. Sundance was also there. I hadn’t seen him in a couple weeks and was happy to run into him again. One of my favorite things on trail is reconnecting with someone who I haven’t seen for an extended period of time. We caught up over dinner and went to sleep shortly afterwards. Almost everyone was tenting, so Peps and I had the shelter all to ourselves which was awesome! 


5/22
Today our group of 3 took a short day of 7 miles into Unionville. There was a nice place to camp in town for free there, an awesome deli, laundry, and even a shower! It had been 12 days since I had washed my clothes and they were more than overdue for a wash. It was so nice to just hang around the town and get a bit of rest today. We stayed in town with grumpy cat and Sundance and had an awesome day just chatting and being lazy. 


5/23
Today Peps and I hiked about 22 miles out of Unionville to a nice stealth camp spot at mile 1370. It was a hot day with a couple large climbs, but they were kind of fun! There were a ton of day hikers out today. I think it’s nice to see people out on the trails, but oftentimes these highly trafficked areas are covered with trash which is upsetting. Today was no exception. I try to pick up trash when I can, but I can’t get all of it. The sun has really been beating the energy out of all of us the last few days and by the end of the hike today I was exhausted. Peps and I made it to the campsite that was our original goal, but Midnight stopped a bit early. Hopefully he will catch up in a few days. We crossed into New York today which was awesome! 8 states crossed off the list! Super excited to be hiking in a new state tomorrow! Woooo!


5/24
Today Peps and I were planning to hike about 21 miles to fingerboard shelter. We ended up deciding we would instead stealth camp at a spot 18 miles from where we started the day. We were both just feeling super tired. We also walked a mile into town earlier in the day which may have factored in a bit. During my hike, I met a day hiker named Rich who had read my journal which was pretty neat. He was super friendly and we chatted about the trail for a bit. He is going to thru hike in the next few years. Rich, if you’re reading this, I hope you’re able to get on the trail and thru hike soon!! The spot Peps and I ended up camping at was nicer than expected and we both went to sleep shortly after we set up. Hoping we can get used to this sun soon. 


5/25
Peps and I had planned on hiking about 20 miles to Hemlock springs campsite, but had to stop short unexpectedly. He was having some pretty serious pain in his shin. We changed plans after arriving in Fort Montgomery and got a room at the bear mountain bridge motel. It was an unfortunate change of plans, but hopefully it would help Peps’ shin. We would take a zero tomorrow to try and let him rest and hopefully recover. The motel was nice and we got an awesome pizza dinner that night. Really hoping that peps leg feels better after our break tomorrow!


5/26 
We had a very relaxing day off today. We visited a nearby library and sat in the air conditioning and read for a little while and then headed over to a coffee shop for a drink and a sandwich. After lunch, we headed back to the motel where we met hikers Teacher and saw Captain America after not seeing him since Waynesboro. Super nice guys! Peps and I then watched chopped on the motel TV for like 3 hours. It was awesome. Once we were done with our chopped marathon, it was pretty much time for bed.","

Skeeter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638641,"Time for another past due update of what has been going on on the trail. Writing this, I am at mile 1503 in Salisbury, CT. 


Upon returning to trail on the 27th of May, Peps quickly realized that his shin had not healed the way he had hoped. He was still feeling a significant amount of pain and decided he would go into town for an X-ray and a few more days of rest. I ended up hiking on. It was unfortunate that we would be separated, but I was confident he would catch back up after healing his shin up a bit. That night I stayed at a campsite about 18 miles from where I had started the day. That night Midnight caught up and I met him in the morning of the next day! 


I had been feeling sick the night of the 27th, but it was nothing major. I woke up on the 28th feeling okay, but still kind of off. As I began my hike, I started to feel worse and worse. I had no energy and only made it about 12 miles. I stopped at the first shelter I came to and just collapsed onto the shelter bunk and fell asleep. For the rest of the night I stayed at the shelter feeling pretty lousy. Midnight showed up and decided he would stay with me at least for the night which I thought was very kind. 


Today I got a ride to the nearest doctor and quickly got a diagnosis. They think I have some kind of an intestinal infection and they gave me a couple prescriptions that will hopefully help me out. I am going to take a few day off trail until I am feeling better. I got super lucky and am going to be staying with a friend of Midnights in Great Barrington with him while I recover. 


It is now June 2nd and I am getting back on trail today with my brother, Ryan! I spent the last 4 days with Midnight and his friend, Emily and it was so great! I feel totally recovered and it was also really nice to actually feel well rested after taking an extended break from the trail. I am a little bummed that all the people I was hiking with are now a few days ahead, but the good news is Peps is right around where I’m getting back on! Midnight is going to stay in Great Barrington for a few more days, but hopefully we will soon all be together once more! 


6/4
Over the last 3 days, I have been hiking with by brother, Ryan. It has been great! I hadn’t seen him since before I left for the trail and it was so nice to catch up and get a bit of hiking in! We hiked a total of about 47 miles over the last 3 days. All of which were supposed to be very rainy, but it seems that Ryan brought a bit of luck with him because we ended up with almost zero rain.  We hiked into Connecticut which I have really been enjoying so far! The water sources have been plentiful, the trail has had some tough hills, but rocks and roots have been rare, and there have been some pretty sweet views! Ryan runs long distance track and cross country, so I knew he would be prepared for the trail, but I was impressed! he has been hiking much more quickly than I had anticipated and we have actually been moving faster than I normally do. I’m going to need a break haha! Tomorrow I will cross over mile 1500 which I am so excited for! It seems like I just hit 500 miles in Virginia and it’s wild to me that I am about to have walked 1500 miles! Less than 700 miles left to go now!","

Yesterday, I had a shorter day of hiking and camped in Salisbury, CT. Peps was taking a zero in town with his mom and would be starting nearby today. 


Today was great! It was hot, but luckily there was a decent amount of shade to take the worst of the heat away. It was one of my favorite days of hiking in a while. There were a couple tough climbs up Mt Everett and Mt Race, but the views were awesome! We were on a ridge that overlooked Connecticut and some mountains. It had been a little while since there had been a view that nice from a ridge walk. We also crossed into Massachusetts today! Only 4 states left including MA! I got back together with Peps about half way through the hike and he was with Hatback, who I hadn’t seen since just before Harpers Ferry. I was very happy to see them both! We hiked together for the rest of the day and finished in Great Barrington, where Hatback and I camped with another thru hiker, Fingies, who I had not met before. I also met Peps’ mom and sister. They made probably the best possible first impression by greeting Hatback and I with root beer floats! Amazing!! They had come down from Illinois to see him. He was spending his last night with them tonight. Very satisfying day today. Looking forward to tomorrow when I plan to hike about 18 miles to Shaker Campsite. 


6/7
Another hot day today! The bugs have been relentless in MA so far. I am enjoying the beauty of the state, but the mosquitos and black flies are something else. The terrain today wasn’t bad and there was a very nice pond that I took a long, 2 hour lunch at in the middle of the day. The bugs are known to be particularly ferocious in Massachusetts and they are absolutely living up to their reputation. It’s impossible to stop most places without being immediately swarmed by them. It makes it difficult to take a break anywhere without wind, but it does make the miles go by a little faster sometimes. Once I made it to the campsite, I set up my hammock and got inside as quickly as I could to get out of the bugs. Peps and Hatback showed up a little bit later and did the exact same. Tomorrow we will hike about 19 miles to October Mountain Shelter. 


6/8 


Rainy day today, but I was thankful for it. It made for much cooler weather with less bugs. The rain wasn’t too hard, but was supposed to turn into a thunderstorm around 4. I rushed to the shelter and made it there at about 3. A flip-flopper that I had not met before, Rainbow, had done the same and was there when I arrived. We chatted and made dinner while waiting for the storm. It rolled in around 4:30 and the rain really came down for about half an hour. Peps rolled in at about 6, but said he didn’t mind the rain because he had needed a shower so badly. Hatback got there a little after him. We all slept well to the sounds of rain tonight.


6/9
 
Today we hiked about 20 miles to Father Tom Campsite. It was a great day filled with some beautiful views and trail magic! Just 2 miles into our hike we came across the cookie lady! She is a well known trail angel that lives just off the trail and bakes fresh cookies for hikers every morning. The cookies were amazing and she was so pleasant to talk to. From there we hiked on. I took a late lunch at the Cheshire cobbles which I got to just before ending my day of hiking. What an incredible view! Massachusetts has been great so far! Once I got to the campsite, I was so happy to see a bunch of familiar faces. Feral and Emerald, both flip floppers that I hadn’t seen for about 2 weeks were there. Cool enuff and Silver Tongue were also there! I hadn’t seen them since the Shenandoahs and was pumped to be around them again. Really nice fellas! Peps and Hatback arrived not long after I did and we talked with the other hikers for a while before trail angel, polish hermit arrived. He rolled into the campsite on a bike carrying trail mix and donuts for all! He asked us if we wanted coffee in the morning and said he would be back before we left camp with some hot coffee! Amazing day!!


6/10


Today we got up early and were so happy to see the polish hermit in the morning! He brought us coffee and fresh banana bread that his neighbor had just made! How wonderful!! We would be climbing to the highest point on the AT in MA today at the peak of Mount Greylock. It had been a little while since we had done a long climb up to the top of a mountain and we were all excited! It was about 8 miles to the top, but it wasn’t too steep of a climb. The view at the top was amazing! We hadn’t been above 3000 feet since VA and I was so happy to be back. From the peak, we had a very steep downhill into the town of North Adams where we did a quick resupply at the nearby grocery store before hiking back up and over to Seth Warner Shelter. Just a couple miles before the shelter, we crossed into Vermont! So exciting! We also crossed mile 1600! I’m so happy to be in Vermont. Each state now feels so much more significant than it did earlier. I am getting pretty close to the finish line and actually feel like I’m in the real North now. Cant wait for my first full day of hiking in Vermont tomorrow!


6/11


We woke up this morning feeling pretty wiped out from our day yesterday. The plan was to hike about 17 miles to a little stealth spot by Little Pond Lookout. VT greeted us with great weather our first day in the state! It was a little overcast, but the temperature was about perfect. It was a slower day of hiking and it took a while to get into a groove. I finally hit my stride after lunch with Peps which was fortunate because we learned it would be raining a good bit after 6. I got to the campsite around 4 and quickly set up my hammock. Peps arrived not long after and we were able to get in a quick dinner at a nearby view before the rain hit. We were in bed by 6 and I probably fell asleep before 7. Very early night! 


6/12


Today was going to be a great day! We only had about 15 miles to hike to a dirt road where peps, Hatback, and I would be picked up by Hatback’s parents. They had rented an Airbnb for a couple nights and were allowing some hikers to stay there. So, so nice of them! Skippy, Fingies, Cool Enuff, And Silvertongue would also be there. The day started off with a climb to one of the best views yet on trail. We climbed Glastenbury Mountain and the fire tower on top of it to a point well above tree line. There were many mountains in every direction. It was incredible! I am going to post photos of the view on my VSCO which I will link at the bottom of this post. From there, it was pretty mellow hiking. I met nobo thru hikers Squid and Pippin about half way through the day. They started on February 23rd and had been a little ahead of me until very recently when they took about 10 days off trail. Peps, Hatback, and I got to the road around 4 and were picked up by Hatback’s parents Kris and Rob. They took us to their place and it was amazing! I got a shower which I needed BADLY after a few days in the 90 degree range. I was pretty gross. I am so thankful for the chance to stay with the Whites (Hatback’s family) and see some people that I haven’t for quite a while. It’s going to be a wonderfully relaxing evening!

Wow, this was a big week for me on the AT. I was slacking in a big way on my journal, but I am going to highlight the main events of the week. 



The week started off with an amazing zero day with the White family on the 13th! I got new shoes, resupplied, and got to just hang out with the others at the house. It was great!Peps and I hiked out from the lodge on the 14th and that day we made it to a sign telling us we were 3/4 of the way done with the trail!! So exciting!


I have really enjoyed hiking through Vermont. It is a super pretty state and has had some of the best views of any state yet! My only complaint is that the trail is as muddy as muddy gets. Many people call Vermont “Vermud” because the ground is so wet. It’s not a huge annoyance, but it does make it much easier to fall. I’ve had a few falls, but luckily none of them have been bad.


On the 16th Peps and I hiked past mile 1693. This meant that we had less than 500 miles to go!! It is really starting to feel like I am nearing the end. It hit me pretty hard and I got a little emotional thinking about being able to see my friends and family again. 



The next day, Peps and I climbed Mount Killington. This was the first time we would be over 4000 feet since Virginia. It felt good to just be up that high again and of course the view at the top was just amazing!On the 19th we walked out of Vermont and into New Hampshire! This was a huge moment for me. It was an incredible feeling knowing that there’s only 2 states left, but a big reason it was such a big moment was because I really wasn’t sure if I’d make it here. Back in New York when I got sick I was actually really close to getting off trail. I was feeling burnt out, unmotivated, tired, and was just feeling done with the trail. I thought seriously about getting off for a couple days and I am so, so glad I didn’t pull the trigger. The last couple hundred miles have been awesome and the feeling of accomplishment I got when I crossed into NH made all the struggle worth it. 



The night that we went into NH, peps and I stayed at Hanover Adventure Hostel. It was a super fun hostel located right on the Connecticut River. Squid and pippin were there who I had just met about a week prior and so were Tenacious and Halo who I had not met before, but we super friendly! We were able to swim in the river which was fantastic after a full day of hiking in the heat.Peps and I ended up staying at the hostel for 2 nights total. We slackpacked about 20 miles on our second day there. It was the first time I had slackpacked since Damascus and it felt great! I hiked with Peps, Squid, and Pippin for most of the day. Once we got back into Hanover and were done hiking, I picked up a couple things from the grocery store and then we headed back to the hostel where we swam around in the river some more. This was my first time getting a shower for 2 days in a row in quite some time. Loved it!","

This has easily been one of my favorite weeks on trail! The week started with a couple tough climbs up Mt Cube and Smarts Mountain. Both peaks had views overlooking the White Mountain Range, which was both beautiful and intimidating. That night, we had a pretty serious thunderstorm roll through and the rain continued into the next morning. Peps and I entered the Whites and Climbed Moosilauke on the 22nd. It was the first mountain in the whites, which is supposed to be one of the most difficult sections of trail on the AT. The climb was long, but not too bad. Unfortunately, we climbed into what was basically a cloud and had no views of the surroundings from the top. We were still pumped to have reached the summit though!The following day, Peps and I climbed the Kinsmen. This was a very challenging climb with lots of scrambling to get to the top. Thankfully, today was much clearer than the prior afternoon and when we reached the top, we had incredible views of New Hampshire and Vermont. Tonight, Peps and I would be staying at “Teri’s place” a hostel that was owned by Teri, who I had met all they way back in Georgia. He was giving out trail magic at the Hostel around the Bend and invited everyone staying there to a free night at his place once we reached New Hampshire. Such an awesome guy! We had a very relaxing night using Teri’s hot tub and sleeping on amazingly comfy, memory foam mattresses.On the 24th, we climbed the mountain that I had been most looking forward to summiting, (at least in the Whites, Mt Lafayette. The ridge that is made up of Little Haystack, Mt Liberty, Mt Lincoln, and Mt Lafayette is known as Franconia Ridge and the views from the top are just absolutely stunning. We were lucky enough to have another super clear day and had an excellent time climbing the mountain and taking in the wonderful views. We ended up hiking to Guyot Shelter that night. By the end of the day, we had climbed well over 7,000 feet total and we were absolutely gassed. 



The following day, Peps and I were feeling very worn down and opted to hike just 10 miles to Ethan Pond Shelter. There were no mountains to climb, but it was a great day nonetheless. We got to the shelter around 2, set up our stuff, and were asleep by 3. I woke up once at around 7:30 to eat dinner, but went right back to sleep when I was done eating. Peps didn’t wake up until the next morning!Today we were thinking of climbing Mt Washington, but some unsavory weather blew in and made us nervous that we may run into a dangerous situation if we went up there. Mt Washington claims to the the home of the most dangerous weather in America and it’s the last place you’d want to be in a storm. There’s a total of about 12 miles above tree line around Mt Washington and the conditions can be very dangerous in that area. We decided to play it safe and stop early today. We would summit Washington tomorrow, when there was a much better forecast. We only hiked 9 miles to Nauman campsite which was right next to Metzpah Hut, where they served tomato soup and brownies. As thru hikers, Peps and I had a coupon for a free bowl of soup and a free baked good which we happily cashed in at the hut. The food was amazing and made me happy to have taken another short day to enjoy it! 


Today, Peps and I would be climbing Mt Washington. My Washington is the 2nd highest point on trail after Clingmans Dome in the Smokies. It was a nice day out, but the conditions at the peak were very cloudy. Apparently there are only about 50 clear days a year on Washington, so we would have had to be incredibly lucky to have a view. The climb honestly is want that bad! I was expecting a very tough hike up, but we were at the summit before we knew it! There were a ton of tourists at the peak that had formed a long line by the sign. It was a little annoying and definitely not what Peps and I are used to, but it wasn’t too bad of a wait. The most difficult part of the day was actually the 2nd climb of the day up Mount Madison and then the descent from Madison. From Madison, we dropped just over 3000 feet in about 2.5 miles and most of the downhill was over a boulder field. By the time we made it to Osgood Tentsite, my knees were screaming. 





This was a special week for me. For the entire trail, people have been talking up the White Mountains. How difficult they are, how amazing the views are, the type of mileage you can expect to do, etc. it’s a crazy feeling to finally have made it to the place that I’ve been hearing about for so long. It absolutely lived up to my expectations! Both in difficulty and in beauty. Every milestone now feels so much bigger because I’m getting close to the end. I don’t feel like I’m quite on the homestretch yet, but I do feel as if I am on my way there. Just over 300 miles until Katahdin!I’ll be uploading some photos of the awesome views in the whites to VSCO pretty soon VSCO link: https://vs.co/a5c2c465","

Another eventful week on trail! Every week that goes by now seems to mark another milestone. This week, Peps and I hiked into Maine, the final state of the Appalachian trail. That didn’t happen until the first of July. 




The week started with a short day into Pinkham Notch, where I was picked up by Rattle River Hostel. Peps opted to hike on and take a short day into the hostel the next day. I got picked up by the hostel around noon and quickly resupplied at Walmart. The plan was to take it easy today and then slackpack the 21 miles from Pinkham notch to the hostel the following day. At the hostel, I met a bunch of southbounders. It was neat to talk to them and hear what they had to say about Maine.The next day, I slackpacked the wildcats. This was the final section of mountains in the Whites and boy were they tough! Super happy I got to slackpack them. They would have been incredibly challenging with a full pack. When I got back to the hostel after my hike, peps had arrived. That night, an amazing dinner was made for us by Klaus, one of the members of the staff at the hostel.On the 30th, Peps needed to get some new shoes, so we got a bit of a later start and planned a shorter day. It was pretty hot in the morning and stared to rain around 3. Luckily, the rain didn’t get very heavy until later in the evening when both Peps and I had already made it to the shelter at Gentian Pond. We only did about 12 miles today, but that was okay with us. We stayed fairly dry and tomorrow we would be hiking into Maine!


Today Peps and I hiked into Maine, which was absolutely incredible!! The weather was pretty lousy and it rained lightly most of the day, but that hardly mattered. We were in the final state and feeling great! We also hiked through the famously difficult and slow-going portion of trail “Mahoosuc Notch”. It is said to be the most difficult mile of trail on the whole thing. It was hard and it took a little while to get through, but I thought climbing up, over, and around the rocks of the notch was pretty fun! What was not fun was the steep climb up Mahoosuc Arm that followed. I ended up staying at Speck Pond Shelter, but Peps stopped a couple miles short of the shelter at the base of Mahoosuc Arm. 


Today, I hiked out of Speck Pond Shelter with a thru-hiker that I had just met at Rattle River, Sonar. He had just recently gotten back on trail after taking 5 weeks off to heal a broken toe. I was planning on hiking about 15 miles today, but he pushed me to hike a 21 to Hall Mountain Lean-to and I’m so glad we did! I was exhausted at the end of the day and sadly, Peps didn’t catch up today, but it put me a few miles closer to Katahdin which I’m excited about.


Sonar and I hiked another 21 miles today to Sabbath Day Pond Lean-to. Had an amazing surprise today when I finally caught back up to Yak! After about 1100 miles apart we are reunited! He was with Pneumonia and Whisper who I was also very excited to see. We all hiked for most of the day together and it was so great to be back together with people who I hadn’t seen in so long. 


On July 4th, Yak, Pneumonia, Whisper, and I decided to take a short day into Rangely. It had been raining for 2 days straight, so we were soaked and exhausted. Maine had really rolled out the red carpet for us. It has been very challenging so far. It is supposed to get easier as we get further into the state which I am excited for. Rangely was great, though! We got a room at the Town and Lake Hotel which provided comfy beds and a view out to a lake. The weather wasn’t very nice, but I was super happy to be out of the rain, in a comfy environment, with old friends!","

This week started with the best weather we have had yet in Maine! Absolutely my favorite day yet in the state. We hiked up Saddleback, the horn, and Saddleback junior. They were tough climbs, but I was so happy to finally be able to see the sky. We camped at sluice brook logging road, a stealth spot with space for many tents right near a brook. Very nice spot!The following day was difficult and rainy. The rain wasn’t very heavy, but it kept us plenty wet all day. It was a huge day for us though. We crossed over 2000 miles on the trail! At this point in my hike, I am pretty ready to be done hiking. I know I will miss the trail greatly, but I am constantly exhausted and I’m feeling very prepared to return home. Reaching 2000 miles is a bit bittersweet. Tonight, we camped at Cranberry Stream Campsite. It was a bit buggy, but I found a good place for my hammock. We prepared dinner and chatted a bit, but were all very tired from our long and wet day. We went to bed and I was asleep before 8.Today, we had great weather which I was so thankful for. We would be climbing the Bigelows. Probably the biggest day of climbing we had left until Katahdin. The climbs were taxing, but the views at the top made it worth it. We got our first view of Katahdin which was just incredible! It is super far away and difficult to make it, but it’s shadow could be seen in the far distance. It’s about 180 trail miles away now, but I think less than 100 miles away from us if we were to draw a straight line from us to the mountain. We ran into Rapture and Captain America later in the day and ended up camping with them at East Flagstaff Road. It was nice to talk with them at the end of a long and difficult day. 


Today was a bit annoying, but was still a solid day in the end. We meant to get out of camp early this morning because we had to cross over the Kennebec river. It was a river about 8 feet deep with no bridge over it. It’s crossable by a canoe, but the canoe must be rowed by an AMC (Appalachian mountain club) employed guide. He works until 2 every day. Unfortunately, we didn’t wake up in time and got a late start. We went as fast as we could, but we’re just a bit too slow and only made it to Pierce-Pond Lean to. It was just under 4 miles from the Kennebec. We were a bit bummed to not be able to cross the river today, but lucky for us this would give us the opportunity to eat breakfast at Harrison’s Pierce Pond Camp. I didn’t know about it before today, but it’s a famous stop on the AT. It’s a hunting and fishing cabin mostly, but the owner, Tim provides a large breakfast for hikers staying at the shelter! The cabin is just .3 miles away from the shelter and just barely off trail. Super excited for breakfast tomorrow morning!


Today started off awesome! The breakfast Tim made for us at his hunting camp was fantastic! He made us pancakes with blueberries, raspberries, and apples mixed in with eggs and sausage links. He was a super nice guy that we all enjoyed chatting with. After breakfast, we crossed over the Kennebec river and quickly resupplied in Caratunk. We headed back to the trail and began the long climb up Pleasant Pond Mountain. The climb wasn’t awful, but it began to rain on the ascent and for the rest of the day the rain only got heavier. With about 5 miles to the shelter, it started to come pouring down. We made our way to the shelter as quickly as possible, but were still soaked by the time we made it there. I got to the shelter just in time to grab the last spot in the shelter. There are a lot of southbounders around now, so space is a little more difficult to come by. It would be tight in the shelter, but at least I would stay dry. I reflected on the day before going to sleep and even though I had a pretty lousy day, I thought about how much I would miss being out on the trail. 


Today was awesome! We climbed Moxie Bald Mountain first thing in the morning and from there, the trail was incredibly flat. We made it the 22 miles into Monson, ME by 2:30 and headed over to the hostel in town, Shaws. We had great weather today and spent the day after hiking enjoying the sunshine, chatting with Southbounders that we were meeting for the first time, and getting cleaned up. We would be taking tomorrow off at Shaws. We were all excited to have a day off before the final push to Katahdin! 


Zero day today! We woke up to an amazing breakfast of eggs, bacon, potatoes, and pancakes that had been prepared for us by hostel owners Poet and Hippie Chick. After breakfast, I took another shower and resupplied. A little later in the day, Yak and I took a canoe out on the pond right next to the hostel. There was outdoor live music at the bar right next to the river that we got to listen to from the canoe. That was awesome! Once we brought the canoe in, I picked up my hang tag from the AT service center in town. It isn’t a huge deal, but it was cool to get something that recognizes me as a thru hiker. I picked up a sandwich for dinner at deli across the street from the service center and went to bed not long after. Wonderful zero day! Tomorrow we enter the 100 mile wilderness.","

This morning we were dropped off by hostel owner, Poet, at the start of the 100 mile wilderness. Unfortunately, we are without Whisper for the rest of the trail. He is waiting for his wife to meet him before he summits and will be finishing a few days after us. The 100 mile wilderness is a stretch of about 100 miles just before Katahdin that has virtually no access to towns or outside services. We had to carry a bit more food than we normally would, but that was really the only thing that changed for us while in the 100. On our first day in, we hiked just under 20 miles to Cloud Pond Lean-to. The weather today was quite overcast, but no rain! As long as I can stay somewhat dry, I will gladly accept a cloudy day.
The following day was difficult and rainy. The rain wasn’t very heavy, but it kept us plenty wet all day. It was a huge day for us though. We crossed over 2000 miles on the trail! At this point in my hike, I am pretty ready to be done hiking. I know I will miss the trail greatly, but I am constantly exhausted and I’m feeling very prepared to return home. Reaching 2000 miles is a bit bittersweet. Tonight, we camped at Cranberry Stream Campsite. It was a bit buggy, but I found a good place for my hammock. We prepared dinner and chatted a bit, but were all very tired from our long and wet day. We went to bed and I was asleep before 8.
Another rainy day in Maine today! It seems that this state is making up for all the dry weather we had early on in the trail. The plan today was to pick up on mileage a bit and head 25 miles to Antlers Campsite. The terrain was flattening out for the rest of the 100 MW, so we were hoping to push larger miles from this point on. We had a couple of smaller climbs up Hay Mountain and West Peak to start the morning off, but after that the trail was largely flat. Maine has been full of beautiful ponds and lakes, especially in the 100 MW. Today was no exception. We passed Mountain View pond, Crawford pond, cooper Pond, and camped next to Lower Jo Mary Lake. There weren’t super clear views of the water due to the rain, but the misty, foggy ponds were still pretty neat!


We had gorgeous weather today and hiked another 25 miles to Rainbow Spring Campsite. Today was by far the flattest day we have had yet in the 100 MW! Today was also my favorite day of the section I think. The weather was perfect and provided picturesque views of Lake Nahmakanta with the blue sky and clouds reflecting off of the surface. The water in the 100 has been the clearest I’ve ever seen. Even when the water reaches probably 6 feet deep, the floor can be easily seen through the water. That night, once we had reached the campsite, we sat by rainbow lake and watched the sun set. Sunsets over the water are my favorite and we were blessed with quite the sunset tonight. 


Today is a super exciting day! The last full day of hiking before Katahdin. The end of my thru hike is coming very soon. I had a difficult time sleeping last night and the night before thanks to the combination of emotions I’m feeling about the end of my hike. I am physically exhausted and mentally drained. This is the hardest I’ve ever worked at something and while I’m tired of being tired, I am not sure how prepared I am to face the end of the “road”. Today we were hiking to the final campsite on trail, the birches, at the base of Katahdin. We had about 21 miles to go of mostly flat terrain. First thing in the morning we hit the largest supply of wild blueberries that I had seen growing on trail. We all picked a few handfuls, chowed down, and continued on our way. About a third of the way through the day, the sky opened up and it started to pour on us. Seemed like a fitting way for Maine and the 100 MW to send us off. Once we made it to camp, we set up our tents/hammocks and ate dinner. It was an oddly quiet meal. It seemed everyone was consumed by the thought of our time on trail coming to a close. All of us had poured all we had into getting here and we had finally arrived. It was a crazy feeling. After dinner, we didn’t waste much time before heading to bed. We planned to wake up around 4 and get up the mountain before it got too crowded at the top. 


Today is THE day. I’m climbing Katahdin and completing my thru hike of the Appalachian Trail. I would like to go into detail describing the ascent of Katahdin, but it’s honestly mostly a blur until I reached the top. It was a very strenuous and complicated climb, but I was so amped to get up there I almost felt as if I was floating. I summitted around 7:50. I can’t put into words the emotions I felt at the top of the mountain. When I got to the top, Yak was already there. We hugged and just stood in silence, taking in the view and trying to get a hold of our emotions. We sat on the top as our buddies, Rapture, Pneumonia, Captain America, and Oopsy Daisy summitted. Each time one of them summitted, we all got emotional all over again. I am so proud of myself and all of my friends that I have met on this incredible journey. 


I am writing this journal entry on the plane back to Richmond, crying, and finding it unbelievably difficult to describe the way I felt summitting. One of the most powerful moments of my life easily. I am so thankful for the opportunity I had to hike this trail. I will remember this trip and the incredible people I met on it for the rest of my life. Thank you to all those who supported me throughout my hike. I couldn’t have done it without y’all.",,View Entry,"Jul 20, Tue",0
