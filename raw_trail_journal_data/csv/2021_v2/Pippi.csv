Pippi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632090,"I have a lot of gear ready. I'm planning a limited amount of resupply boxes primarily where I know resupply is difficult. These will be shipped almost exclusively to hostels or friends along the trail. I know myself. Being tied to the hours a post office may be open will drive me crazy.A note to others planning a hike. Keep your resupply options fluid and don't plan too many resupply boxes. If you doing all these boxes you will miss some wonderful otions and convenient local markets, not be giving to the communities along the trail that support us hikers and spend a heck of a lot more money. Postage is Not cheap and if you have to buy food why not but it where you need it rather than buy it and add 20+ dollars to the cost for postage??",,View Entry,"Dec 24, Thu",0
Pippi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632119,"Before doing a long distance hike it is important to set up and test each piece of your gear. Last night it I decided would be a good night to pre test my sleeping bag in if not trail conditions at least challenging conditions. Perhaps tougher than trail in some ways... I have an RV that is sitting in my driveway. Not a tent or trail by any means. However it has been cold soaking for months. It was low 20s last night outside here in Holden Maine. I put the bag in the rv and went to bed in what I would war on trail. That consisted of my trail tights, with fleece over pants, a short wicking shirt, long quilted nylon hiking short, a w quilted fleece jacket and my Montbell down jacket over top. I had medium weight LLB bean hiking socks on with heat holders fleece socks over, thinsulite glover and a winter cap.So test failure. The down 15 degree Big Agnes Downtex sleeping bag did not keep my feet warm nor was the hood part long enough to cover my head. I suspected before the test that this bag was not going to work. It actually belongs to my wife (Trail name Lady"") who was nice enough to let me try it to save space in my pack. Well thank You Lady. Next try will be my own 20 degree dry down bag. It may actually be warmer that the one I tried because it is much longer and my feet will not be jammed in the end. I also carry an emergency space blanket and have a liner sheet so I am prepared as you dear reader should be as well. No matter where you hike early spring can give you surprises in weather. The Appalachains are known for cold wet weather. It has snowed in July in both the White Mountains, Maine Mountains and some of the southern mountains especially in the Smokies. Please keep that in mind, have a plan in case you are hit with freezing weather, a whiteout or other unexpected weather event on your hike",,View Entry,"Dec 28, Mon",0
Pippi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632174,"Still working toward a final gear pack. Have new tent and everything figured out. I am going to carry some extra stuff to Florida when I go for a few weeks prior to hike will finalize clothing then.What I know as to clothing. Trail tights and fleece over pants (for those cold mornings) a short and long sleeve wicking top. A fleece sweat shirt and thinner fleece hoodie. Down jacket. 3 panties one bra, 3 socks plus one pair showers pass socks. (For those days in a row that never stop raining.) rain pants and jacket. Cap. Sleep silks. fleece socks to wear at night. (Hey a gals gotta have some comfies!) whats up for consideration is a pair of very warm ski pants. I don't really want the weight but it comes to a trade. I elected not to carry my 0 degree campmore sleeping bag opting for a 15 degree instead. So I save a lb and a half but get chilly sometimes.As you can see I am not huge on carrying extra clothes.Gear :Tent Lightheart Duo. Sleep pad Neo air Sleep bag down mountain research 15 degree. poles Leki macalu yeah oldies but they serve well. stove fuel, titanium pot. I do not carry a bear canister, a bear bell or any of that. I do have an URSAK which serves as my bear storage. I hang as well so have two hopes of keeping my food. Headlamp and batteries. Whistle. a few band aids duct tape, New Balance hiking shoes. Thats it.",,View Entry,"Jan 04, Mon",0
Pippi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632340,"Getting ready is always a stressor. What to bring, what do I do next what can I eliminate to make my poor pack lighter. I'm not immune to this malady. Not only am I trying to work out a very few early mail drops I am trying to figure out just what to put in them. OK I know food. Right. And a few mads. But what food? How much? Too much and I am a pack mule too little and I am a hungry hungry hiker. I'm going to use some Mountian House meals in the boxes. Not because I think they are better than other pre packaged hiker meals but because I have them left over from another hike I did and they are soon going out of date. I am bring some instant oatmeal GRRR hate the stuff BTW!  It's everywhere but we get sick of it pretty quickly. You will too. Instant coffee, instant hot cocoa. (Here is an idea for those who like coffee sweetened. Mix one or two packs of instant coffee in a packet of instant cocoa. Enjoy, wash out your cup good to go)       Food bars. Peanut butter. Soft taco shells. Energy beans, dry Gatorade in individual packets Honey stingers. some Espresso  beans from Ben and Bills in Bar Harbor. some left over Halloween candy. I try to carry only enough of these to get to the next townI mentioned what to do in the topic. I am being pushed this way and that as to hike schedule. So my start date is becoming more and more fluid. Is it early or late March?? What about this commitment what about? You know the drill if your getting ready to hike. We do what we have to do to hike and to keep the home fires burning and happiness in the home.  Nuff said Pippi _still home and anxious to go",,View Entry,"Jan 20, Wed",0
Pippi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632768,"I am packed barring a few last minute things such as tortilla shells I carry for lunch and the like. I'm watching the weather down south and wondering. Its been cold and very rainy. I know that trail its got to be all mud and mud in Georgia means red clay. That is is a slippery treacherous surface to hike on. I'm committed plane flights booked so I will cope with it as we all must. No rain no Maine and all that.For anyone planning a thru hike or spring hike north bound on the AT it is essential to plan for very cold weather, bountiful rain, slippery trail and possibly to probably a few instances of sleet and snow. For those planning to start in January or February you can add snow drifts especially in the Smokies, ice and probable days off trail when conditions become too difficult to hike. Those may be frequent. Many people end their dream of a thru hike because of a early departure. Carry clothing that will keep you dry and warm even in sub zero conditions. A zero degree sleeping bag is a minimum in my opinion for a early hike and minus 25 would not be unreasonable. I'm carrying a zero for a mid March hike. It will go home in Damascus Virginia as will in all probability, heavy gloves, fleece over pants and heavy fleece top. In exchange I will get a 45 degree bag, my crocs, short sleep shirt, an LL Bean Bug shirt long sleeve   I'm hoping to do Springer to Damascus in 32 to 35 days.",,View Entry,"Feb 24, Wed",0

As Pippi's child I consider it an honor to have this chance to share her journey with all of you and to play a role in the experience. To have this connection is to me a privilege, and not to be taken lightly. I await with anticipation, excitement and a little fear, the opportunity to share her experiences with everyone and to document for her this extraordinary experience.",,View Entry,"Mar 02, Tue",0
Pippi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632881,"Ok, I am 16 days away from hitting the trail. Going through marking gear, re-evaluating everything and putting last minute things like meds in my pack. I'm mailing resupply boxes tomorrow. It's hard waiting. I am getting excited, and I admit, a little nervous too. Though I have hiked the trail before, I am also older now and recognize that I am not as strong or well as I was in 2011.

Drizzle all the way to Springer Mountain and drizzle off and on today. Weather tomorrow looks wetter. Hooked up with Tom Thrumm, who looks like a likely hiking partner for a few days at least.

For Aspiring Hikers. Good rain gear is a must. Anything less will fail. Invest wisely or be wet.","

Notes: Try not to overpack no matter what good intentioned people may give you. I helped someone lighted her load last night. Scream (trailname) was carrying 48 lbs!!She asked for help, her gear was already coming apart.So she eliminated two deoderant, 2 compasses, a bath size bar of soap, one of two charging bricks, a 1lb bag of fire starter and a knife that Crocodile Dundee would have admired. Others gifted her a ""new to her"" ultra light sleeping bag and a new tent. Oh and maps. She eliminated about 2 lbs of extra food. Final weight this morning with 3 liters of water was 33 lbs. Why 3 liters? Trail insecurity I suppose.","

When choosing to hike with others, try to find people with similar hiking styles to your own. Don't commit yourself to doing anyone elses hike.","

I met up with Susan Hammock Hanger Turner. She had the resupply box I mailed her. She also brought some more nourishing food for Scream. While we were there Miss Janet (a Trail Angel) drove in and gave us sodas and happened to have usable boots for Scream. We parted company and Unicoi. Doubt I will see her again.

Today is a pretty day. We could have hiked but we would have walked into two or three days of bad weather. I'm back hiking with Scream. Jan thinks that perhaps fate has placed us together to learn from each other. Going slower I do see and process more. And she is good to talk to. Jan has arranged two more days off trail for us. So we will resume our hike Monday. In the meantime perhaps Scream's hips can heal. When I met her she had bleeding sores from her pack.Shadow, I like it when you add little thoughts and things. I'm proud of you.","

Pippi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634060,"Big Gap Tent area. Sleeping tent. Miles today 9.0. Total miles 78.6. Todays hike was hard. I am in considerable pain. My left knee is swollen and stiff. Going downhill is especially painful. I have left Georgia behind. Now to get through North Carolina. It felt good leaving the Georgia Mountains behind. I'm camping tonight at an elevation of 3840 feet. That is the lowest elevation I will be at for the next couple days. Couthouse Bald is reputed to be difficult. I get to climb up there first thing in the morning. Scream and I are no longer hiking together. She just isn't able to do the miles and pace I do. Going slower also gets me off stride and causes more pain. Tips for Hikers:It is ok to slow down and help another hiker, especially someone who really doesnt know what he or she is doing yet. However remember that this is YOUR hike. Don't completely lose yourself in someone else's hike. Especially if it is negatively affecting yours. I met a hiker today having to get off trail because all of her gear got soaked. A down sleeping bag is useless wet. To prevent fun things like that ALWAYS line your pack with a contractor debris disposal bag. Put anything you dont want to get wet inside and fold the top over and tuck it down. Water bladders lay on top. If they leak, your stuff stays dry.Also, NEVER EVER bring liquids inside your tent. EVER. Set a water bottle or bladder just outside the tent door. When you get thirsty unzip, get your drink and then zip back up. Bottle spills or bladder leaks, your stuff still stays dry.","

All health app on my phone shows 19383 steps, 7.7 miles, and 112 flights of stairs climbed. And it only counts the ones I climb, not the downhills. It's been a very tough day. The climb from Bly Gap up over Couthouse Bald was ugly and really a lot of today's hike has been steep ups and downs. I'm in a good bit of pain. Both knees hurt. Tip for Hikers: When in town waiting on a motel room ask if there is somewhere to put your gear.
