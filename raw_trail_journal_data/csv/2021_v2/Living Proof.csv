Living Proof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634195,"   After many months of physical and mental preparation, I’m once again heading out on the Appalachian Trail tomorrow.  I’m doing a non traditional flip flop thru hike starting just north of Mt Greylock near the mass./Vermont border heading south to Springer, then flipping back north to my starting point and heading north to Katadin.  I’ve almost had too much time to prep for this hike and have really been chomping at the bit to get going as I’ve waited for the weather to moderate a bit.  I should be able enjoy some relative solitude on the trail as the majority of thru hikers are still way down south.  Gonna take it relatively easy first few weeks as I drop some weight and get my trail legs.  Looking forward to this adventure, LP",,View Entry,"Apr 02, Fri",0

Total miles 14.2    First day back on trail in three years.   I decided a while back that I should kick off this thru hike with a bit of an epic start, Mount Greylock. My oldest son Andrew dropped me off at the end of Phelps Avenue in North Adams at 10:20 AM, I gave him a hug and said goodbye.  Those first few steps on trail felt like jumping out of an airplane for the first time parachuting.  Mount Greylock welcomed me with a 5.8 mile climb that was really more than I bargained for.  If I had not trained for the past two months my body would’ve quickly wilted on today’s hike.  I reaced the top and quickly realized that it was too cold to hang out but the views were limitless on a perfectly  cloudless day.  To my chagrin as I began the dissent I soon realized that the southside of the mountain was largely in the shade.  The result was 3 miles of steady ice and snow sometimes referred to as an ice luge.  I was lucky enough to only fall once and it was relatively controlled and did not result in injury although my Smartwater bottle slid down the trail about 50 feet.  I told myself during all my training hikes I will come to regret starting where I did trying to tackle MT Greylock in very early spring, but I did tackle it.  However the 14.8 miles that I did felt more like 20+.  I Wearily hiked into Cheshire and hoped the town campground would be available to camp at as I really couldn’t have gone any further.  Luckily it was and I quickly set up camp.My first dinner was a misadventure resulting in a tuna couscous soup which was very unpalatable.  I crawled into my tent and sleeping bag and attempted to do this trail journal, however both of my feet, my left hand,my calves, and my right hamstring we’re all attempting to cramp!  Well this hike was a bit more than I was prepared for. I was proud to have finished it and be so quickly reminded what a day on AT is like.","Phelps ave. North Adams MA

Greylock  in the distance.  The weather remain chilly and windy, but that’s my preferred weather when hiking hard.  After stopping at October mountain shelter for a quick break the terrain the next seven miles proved more taxing, but I was in no rush, so just pushed through it.  On the downside during one of my water breaks today I apparently left my camp shoes where I braked, as I keep them with my water filter on the outside of my pack.  A minor inconvenience as I can get another pair until this upcoming Sunday.  I’m camping on the front porch of upper Goosepond cabin tonight so that should be pretty cool.  A bunch of firsts today as I met a fellow hiker who is doing a bunch of section hikes on the AT from Connecticut, I met my first trail maintainer of the hike and saw my first garter snake.  Hoping with the bigger mileage day today I sleep a bit better tonight, it’s been pretty rough the first two nights.  All in all a great day minus the camp shoes disappearing.","Kay wood shelter

Wilcox south sheltersMile marker 1535.6Glen Brook sheltermile marker 1516.0Total miles 19.6    It has been said that long-distance hikers have a higher propensity for soiling themselves than the general population.  The extreme physical exertion coupled with visits into towns to eat fat and greasy foods can often lead to intestinal instability.  Despite not having eaten any town food on this trip so far I managed to deposit a half a can of wet dog food in my longjohns during my morning piss!  This is kind of a worst nightmare situation in the middle of the woods and if it weren’t for my one luxury item that I have been question on by other hikers I would’ve been in big trouble.  My little pack of make up remover wipes that I carry to clean up at the end of the day really saved me.  It was a lengthy cleanup process and my poor longjohns are now buried on the side of Mount Wilcox mountain hopefully to be never found again.   I did some hiking as well today I actually did 19.6 miles which was my longest day and ended with a 3.4 mile climb up towards Mount Everett that was super tough.  I was exhausted and dehydrated so my main focus was not falling as it was actually kind of a dangerous climb.  There was about a 5 mile Valley hike today that was nice and flat but totally exposed to the sun with no water sources, which left me suffering from symptoms of dehydration. I try to drink the best I can but I sweat so heavily that it’s just tough to keep up.  I may have a chance to go to Salisbury tomorrow for some real food but after today and the ongoing intestinal issues I had throughout the day I may just skip it.  Sleeping in another shelter all by myself again tonight and I will sleep well!","Mt.

I took a short break there to soak in the view and then continued on in to Falls Village and finally to RT7.  Saulsberry Rt7 was truly easy hiking and I covered 10 miles quickly, but then came the next 8.5 miles...  The next 8.5 miles is a good example of a part of the Appalachian Trail the people don’t really talk about.  Continual pointless up and downs the woods all look the same with no discerning features, at one point I felt like I was trapped in a hiking time space continuum.  I finally reached a shelter and took a short break and a dad showed up with his son and daughter who are probably nine and seven, so that did cheer my spirits to see some young children out backpacking, although they will surely see no wildlife as I could hear coming from about a quarter mile away.  The highlight of my campsite tonight is the privy!  It’s a small wooden box with the toilet seat on it and that’s it, no walls no doors just a toilet in the middle of the woods.  Of course I had to use it and it was great, but maybe not in a downpour though..","Cobble rd.

Two scrambled eggs crispy hashbrowns and wheat toast and a grilled cheese sandwich with bacon and a bag of chips and a half a pickle and three glasses of Dr Pepper.  The forecast today had originally been terrible but as I approached Windgap I only got hit with about 10 minutes of rain but the real story was the wind.  By the time I got down to town the wind was blowing 40 to 50 mph and the temperature has dropped into the 40s.  I finished my meal and bought two Powerade‘s at the Sunoco where I plan to set up and try to get a hitchhike back to the trail head.  As I went out by the roadside in my little sock on your running shorts and rain jacket my legs and ass quivered in the high intensity winds and wind chill.  Luckily a fellow named Adam picked me up after about 3 minutes.  Brought me up to the trail head and drop me off in my 4 1/2 mile hikes to the shelter was mostly on the one side of the mountain.  The on top of the mountain the wind had to be blowing 50 to 60 miles an hour and I had no choice but to hike as quickly as I could on the rocks just to stay warm enough.  Not ideal hiking conditions but definitely memorable ones!  Supposed to get down to 28 tonight just hoping the wind dies down...","Episcopalian church on the mountain

    I was up at 5:45 to pack up my tent and pack and was super thankful to find Teacher(Nobo hiker) have coffee ready and pancakes cooking.  We shared breakfast and I helped with the cleanup.  With that we parted our separate directions on the trail.  I’m definitely starting to feel the isolation of my SOBO hike leaving from where I did.  My left foot was again very sore today, which is becoming its own mental drain.  The first 10 miles of today was the remainder of the roller coaster, which is 13.5 section of steepish repeated up and downs.  The section wasn’t hard, just annoying and slow to get through.  The day didn’t have many views, mostly me counting down till next med time for my foot.  I take a good spill while cruising along a flat section and narrowly missed smashing my face on a rock.  My thoughts grew darker as day worn and my attitude just wasn’t where it needed to be.  Luckily I had some company at camp, an older fellow who claims he doesn’t snore...we’ll see.  Entering Shenandoah’s tomorrow for its 105 mile entirity.  If my foot is still hurting after the park, I’ll probably go get an x-ray, I have a slight worry it may have a stress fracture.  Hopefully get good bear pics, but rumor is they are being seen much by anyone I’ve talked to who has hiked the park already.","Bears den hostel

    I wasn’t in a rush to get out of my sleeping bag this morning as my foot pain is usually the worst when I wake up having no pain meds in my system.  Appalachian Al wasn’t lying he didn’t snore all night, thanks Al.  I packed up my belongings and started hike out, my morning lamp was more profound in the past two days it it took longer for the ibuprofen to take affect in for me to be able to walk with a normal gait. I knew I had 5 miles to the next shelter but I haven’t checked the next page my guide book and I soon found out that I had another 5 miles and change to US 522 to get into Front Royal.  I’m not sure when I made the decision but I had decided I needed to get into town to have my foot checked and pushing over 100 miles to the Shenandoah park without getting a checked was unwise.  I had a sinking feeling that my foot was going to need some serious time off before even getting it checked out.  I spent most of the morning hiking and thinking about all of the positives of my hike this far.  Seeing towns and hostels that I missed in 2016, meeting new and interesting people, experiencing the trail in the first three weeks without interference from other hikers.  It was kind of exactly what I was looking for in this hike.  When I reached US 522, I was lucky enough to catch a shuttle driver from Stanimals hostel dropping offs hiker and he gave me a ride into town.  It was too early to check into the hotel so I went to spelunkers and grab some lunch to kill the time.  Back to the hotel I want to check in and I call the taxi to go to the local urgent care to get my foot checked.  There was no fracture but I have apparently strained foot muscles and ligaments that need some significant rest.  I suppose my condition is somewhat self-imposed as I just enjoy hiking big miles and masking any discomfort with large doses of ibuprofen and Tylenol.  Being not able to truly feel the pain in your body is isn’t necessarily a good thing and can lead to real injury.  I’ve decided to go home for a bit and heal up.  Let’s just say for now this story is to be continued....,","Manassas gap shelter
