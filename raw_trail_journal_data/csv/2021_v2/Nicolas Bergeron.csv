Nicolas Bergeron,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631875,"Hi!
I’m Nic. I have yet to start my thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail better known as the AT. To more accurately put it, I have yet to start my ATTEMPT at thru-hiking the AT. There are those that have their doubts, though I’m not one of them. Don’t get me wrong, I fully expect it to be difficult, and may even contemplate giving up along the way, but I’m pretty stubborn, especially once someone tells me I can’t. I’ve been actively planning my hike since February 2020, though I have been interested in hiking the entire AT ever since I first learned of it as a young teenager. 
My goal is to get it done in less than 4 months, which I know is a lofty goal. It might become a reality if I get my trail legs early and can start crushing high mile days. Despite this, I know a more realistic expectation is closer to 5 months, and I know there are bound to be some unforeseen setbacks, so I am preparing and saving enough to last 6 months. That doesn’t change anything, I’m still aiming to be back home in 4 months, just in time for the big garden harvests come August.
Some may think I’m crazy for undertaking such a long trail, but I think now is the best time to do it. I have virtually no obligations: I’m not tied down with school, as I graduated in 2015 and never attended college, I work for a large box store, that cycles through more employees than I care to count, I don’t have an apartment I need to worry about, no pets, etc. As I get older, I will only gain more responsibilities that will prevent me from overcoming similar long term challenges.",,View Entry,"Nov 22, Sun",0
Nicolas Bergeron,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631974,"I’ve been reading a couple books documenting other people’s journey’s on the Appalachian Trail. To be honest, it’s the most reading I have done since high school. I should be hiking smaller trails and mountains to get in shape, but really the best way to prepare to hike 8+ hours a day, is to do just that. I have most of my gear for the hike, though there are some items that I may upgrade or still need to pick up. I also need to nail down exactly what gear I’m bringing. 


For now, I can list few items that I WON’T be bringing:
A gun (too heavy, doesn’t serve much purpose, and a lot of paperwork to fill out)Bear spray (again, too heavy, and bears are just as scared of you)Pillow (bulky, and I could just as easily use a balled up sweater)


Having said all that, I am currently planning to bring a hammock and tarp for my shelter (which I’m thinking of possibly switching out for a tent). I also have a down quilt and inflatable sleeping pad. I narrowed things down to fit into a 35 liter pack made by Granite Gear. In lieu of a pack cover, I’m using a pack liner with waterproof stuff sacks to keep the essentials dry. An inexpensive rain jacket from Frogg Toggs will keep me dry, and a jacket from Enlightened Equipment will keep me warm. I’m also contemplating whether or not to bring a stove or if I should cold soak.


Cold soaking, for those who are unfamiliar, is the act of rehydrating your food in a water tight container by just allowing it to absorb the water you pour over it. Some foods take longer, while others are almost instant (oatmeal, mashed potatoes). Cold soaking is usually a lighter weight option because you don’t need to carry a stove or fuel.


I’m planning to use a hybrid option. Using a titanium pot will allow me to cook (really, “cooking” on the trail is just boiling water) and having a water tight lid will allow me to cold soak if I want. It’s a heavier set up than a dedicated cold soaker may use, but I’d like to leave my options open.


Until next time,

Nicolas Bergeron,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632040,"Almost everything I’m reading about the Appalachian Trail says something about plans changing. Whether that means the number of miles you planned to hike each day, or how many days you take off to rest in town (aptly called a “zero” because zero miles were hiked), or even an injury that takes you off trail. For something as long as a thru hike of the AT, it’s hard to plan the entirety of it all at once. It’s easier to figure out one to two weeks at a time. You have a much better idea of where you will be in a shorter timeframe. Once on the trail, you may realize that you need more days off to recuperate than you had accounted for. You might only like going into town for the bare essentials, opting not to stay for the night and instead get in and out as quickly as possible.


I like to have a general plan going into something, but I don’t necessarily have to stick to that plan 100% if something comes up. For now, the only thing I have planned for sure is a bus ticket down to Gainesville, GA. That is the closest public transportation will get you to Springer Mountain. From there, a private shuttle is needed to go the roughly 40 miles between the two. I have to still figure that part out. I’m still not entirely sure what I want to do once I get there. 


I’ve already changed my mind of the type of shelter I am going to carry. Originally, I was going to hammock camp, but my set up weighed just over 2 pounds. So I decided I was going to ditch the hammock and only use the tarp, cutting my weight in half, now down to a little more than 17 ounces. After reading multiple accounts of hiking the AT, I decided that I want to have the protection of a sealed tent, so mosquitoes, ticks and other bugs can’t get to me as I sleep. So I purchased a Hexamid Solo for Zpacks, further reducing my weight to about 15 ounces.


I’ve also swapped out my original 700ml Toaks cook cup for the larger, but more versatile Vargo BOT. Having the option to either cold soak or cook is worth the extra little bit of weight to me. That reminds me of another popular phrase in the thru-hiking world: Hike your own Hike. That’s a topic for another entry, though. And with that, I’m signing off.

Nicolas Bergeron,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632355,"About 3 million people hike on the Appalachian Trail each year. While the vast majority are only out for a couple day hikes, some are section hiking, and fewer still are attempting a thru hike. Among those who are thru hiking, that is, hiking the entirety of a long distance trail, one may hear the phrase “Hike your own hike.” It means to do things your own way. Don’t push yourself too hard just to keep up with a group. Just the same, don’t slow down considerably to stay with a group either. If you want to stop in town for a zero, do it. Don’t let others determine how far you go in a day, how fast you hike, whether to skip a town/landmark, etc. Hike your own hike. 


Because many thruhikers are heading northbound (NOBO) and start in Spring, another phrase is “No rain, no Maine” Partially due to typical spring weather and partially due to the way air currents react with mountains, it tends to be very rainy. My sister made a comment the other day about just staying in a tent or shelter all day if it was raining. If I did that, it would take me much longer than the estimated 5-6 months to finish the trail. This hike will by no means be easy. Nor will it be enjoyable 100% of the time. There will be bugs, rain, cold nights, hot days, blisters, and sore legs to name some of the hardships that come with hiking long distances. But I’m looking forward to the challenge and “embracing the suck” in order to get to Mt. Katahdin.

Nicolas Bergeron,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632631,"The Appalachian Trail Conservancy has stated that they will not be recognizing those who thru-hike this year as 2000-milers. That, combined with the continual rising of Covid-19 cases and having to quarantine prior to traveling is making me think about possibly hiking the AT at another time. As of right now, my plan is still to head down to Georgia come March 23. If things don’t improve in the next 5-6 weeks, I may change things up to make it a South bound hike from Mt. Katahdin starting in June or July, provided things improve by then.I don’t like the idea of postponing my hike, but it may be necessary to keep all parties involved safe. People have said, “But you’re going to be alone in the woods.” To an extent, they’re right. But with so many hikes getting postponed last year, there will be more people itching to get out on trail this year. Being able to properly maintain the 6 feet social distancing will be more difficult with more people hiking. It’s not really feasible to carry more food than 5-6 days worth. Taking into account the low end 2 pounds of food per day, that’s 10-12 pounds, on top of your other gear, and any water you carry, which weighs more than 2 pounds per liter. Carrying  that much, you still have to head into town at minimum once a week to resupply. You’re passing through different communities, carrying whatever you may have picked up in the last town. Not to mention, any shuttles or hitches you take, or staying in a hostel.If I can’t hike the AT this year, North bound, South bound, or a Flip-Flop, I will start next year at the end of March, and hike some shorter trails this year to get some more experience backpacking under my belt.Until Next Time.",,View Entry,"Feb 12, Fri",0
Nicolas Bergeron,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632715,"Hey all!
The reality is that a North Bound (NoBo) thru-hike is simply unlikely for me this year. I don’t really want to have to deal with the quarantines and Covid closures that are in effect in 8 out of the 14 states. I also don’t think that things will magically open back up in the next month, but my hope is that by June some of the restrictions will be lifted.
My first thought was to do the opposite of my original plan, start at Mt. Katahdin and head South. Then I realized that I don’t want to start my hike with some of the most difficult terrain on the trail. There’s also the 100 Mile Wilderness in Maine to contend with. 100 miles between any kind of town or civilization. In the beginning of a hike, it’s a good idea to start slow, hiking only 8-12 miles each day, and slowly adding more until you’re able to hike longer days. Taking that into account, the 100 Mile Wilderness will take 8-10 days to complete, meaning you need to carry enough food to last that long. Not wanting to start with that, I remembered that I could do a Flip-Flop hike.
A Flip-Flop hike is a hike where you start somewhere in the middle of the trail and hike to one terminus, either North to Katahdin, or South to Springer Mountain. Upon reaching one end, you can travel back to your starting point and hike to the opposite terminus. Or you could go to other terminus and hike back to your original starting point. That’s the beauty of a Flip-Flop, you can hike it so many different ways. This is likely going to be the way I make my hike, if I start in June/July: Start at Harper’s Ferry, WV and hike North to Katahdin. Take a bus down to Georgia, resume my hike at Springer Mountain and make my way back up to Harper’s Ferry. It will be an all-Northbound hike, but I will hike the northern portion first.
Another option is to hike North bound as planned, but push it out to 2022, and do some other hikes in the interim. I’ve been thinking of doing the Long Trail (273 mi) in Vermont, or possibly the New England Scenic Trail (215 mi), that goes from Connecticut through Massachusetts to the New Hampshire border. I need to look more into each one to figure out logistics, I’m keeping that option open, just in case. 
Until next time!",,View Entry,"Feb 19, Fri",0
