Three Times,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632332,"Hello friends.  My name is Larry Miller.  This will be my third attempt at a thru hike of the AT, so my trail name is Three Times.  Why this is a third attempt is a long story.  Suffice to say that I really am hopeful that I am successful this time.  To let everyone know upfront, I am a Christian and I am always blown away at how awesome is the beauty of God's creation, including the Appalachian Trail.  This is just a brief introductory post.  I hope to run into many of you on the trail.  I will be leaving Springer Mtn. on March 9 heading north.  My friend back home hiked the trail in 2004 so he will be taking care of the things I need back there.  I will end this post as I end all my posts on Facebook.  Thanks for tuning in.  I love you all.  SOLI DEO GLORIA.",,View Entry,"Jan 19, Tue",0
Three Times,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632522,"Springer Mtn GA 29° Partly cloudy 33°/23°Milinocket ME 26° Heavy snow 35°/28°725 miles off trailHello friends. So today's post is for those who like numbers. Arthur-n-Me have 34 days to leaving. Yesterday and today we hiked 5.6 miles (9 km for my European friends). We have a sports tracking app on the phone. You can put it on auto pause but you have to make one of two choices; either less than 3mph (4.8 kph) or less than 1 mph (1.6 kph). Arthur-n-Me are not sprinters, so we chose less than 1 mph. That's pretty slow but you are still aware that you have to keep moving or the thing will pause on you. Let's go! No slacking! Finally this was done with a full pack weight of just over 19 lbs (8.6 kilos). Some of you may be wondering what is the weight of the vehicle conveying all this. That number is classified for now. Very top secret. At any rate, preparations are proceeding nicely. The airline ticket is purchased and transportation to Springer has been arranged. All that is left now is for the time to pass.Thanks for tuning in. I love you all.SOLI DEO GLORIA.",,View Entry,"Feb 04, Thu",0

Just a few bits of info today. Arthur-n-Me will post all of the hike here on Facebook. Our friend, John Braswell will copy and paste the postings to Trail Journals.com. This will be the official archive of the hike. For anyone interested in seeing those posts (they will just be these posts over there) or if you feel like following along from there, here is a link to there.trailjournals.com/docmed. Once you are there you can bookmark it so it's easy to get there again. There is a guest book you can sign and leave a message. There are all the old messages from 2017 so I have to find out how to delete all the old ones so there are just new ones. Also, once I post this one to trail journals, this will be entry number three, so there isn't a lot to see just yet.So Arthur-n-Me were out hiking today and we pushed a bit farther. Six miles/9.6 km today. As we push farther we see all the old landmarks from 2017 and they bring back memories of getting ready for that hike. The first one that didn't happen. I remember a friend of mine, Dan, who was taking the test for Professional Engineer. He failed the test the first time and for someone as driven as Dan is, that was hard blow for him. But he got up, dusted himself off and studied and took it again and passed it on the second try. That always inspired me. There have been a few setbacks on this road, but here we are on the verge of giving it another try. Lots of emotions as the day draws closer. I covet all your prayers for a safe and successful hike. For my Parkgate friends, John has put up a map of the trail in the library. If you feel so moved, Arthur-n-Me would like it if you would write some comments on the map. We are going to keep it and frame it after the hike. Would love to see your comments even if you just sign your name. That's it for today.",,View Entry,"Feb 08, Mon",0

Three Times,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638589,"Appalachian Trail. Gooch Gap. Mile 16.9Hello friends. I don't plan on posting this often but I have a couple of things. So Arthur-n-Me are staying at the same hostel we were at last year in Suches Georgia. This time it's legit. We came off the trail at Gooch Gap. The plan was to come off at Woody Gap which is three and a half miles further but Arthur was tired and no amount of arguing by me could get him to go more. So here we are. We even got the same bunk we had last time. The pictures are just random pics I took along the way.  (This post was copied and pasted from a Facebook entry which had multiple pictures.  You can see them in the group of pictures I added to the journal.  I am editing this post in June.) The army truck was parked along the trail as there is a Ranger school in the area where they train. The little sign about the cemetery comes first and the headstone was a little further. Arthur has been pretty cooperative up to now.It was interesting as we were hiking up Springer Mtn. Some words from one of my favorite Christian artists, Andrew Peterson came to mind. . ""And the mountains sing Your glory hallelujah. The canyons echo sweet amazing grace. My spirit sails, the mighty gales are bellowing your name. And I've got nothing to say. I've got nothing to say"". How can you say anything when coming face to face with the unimaginable beauty of God? Human words fail. We use the word awesome way too much. We rob it of it's meaning. But all we can do is stand and marvel at the awesome beauty of God. I look forward to what more God has in store going forward.",,View Entry,"Mar 11, Thu",0
Three Times,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638592,"So this is Crawl.  That's his trail name.  I never did know his given name.  If you have looked closely at the picture, you will notice he has a prosthesis from the knee down on one leg.  HIs goal was to do a thru hike.  I lost contact with him and as far as I know, he is still out there hiking.  A great inspiration.",,View Entry,"Mar 12, Fri",0
Three Times,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638590,"So while I was staying at Above The Clouds, it was decided that I would go to Jarrad Gap and slack pack back to Gooch Gap.  This would catch me up on the miles I lost between Gooch and Woody Gap and would put me that much closer to Blood Mountain when I started the day after the slack pack.  So coming back down to Woody Gap was a church group who had come out to feed the hikers.  It was definitely appreciated and right on time.  I was pretty hungry by the time I got there.  Thanks to those folks who came out.",,View Entry,"Mar 13, Sat",0
Three Times,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638591,"Hello friends.  So Blood Mountain Shelter is at the top of (you guessed it) Blood Mountain.  It is mile 28.9 from Springer Mtn.  The shelter was built in the 1930's and has a concrete floor.  Blood Mtn. has a fearsome reputation among the hikers.  The thing is, Lucky (owner of Above the Clouds Hostel) says that Georgia has 9 Blood Mountains so it really is all of a piece.  Georgia is a tough row to hoe, second only to New Hampshire and that's not by much.",,View Entry,"Mar 14, Sun",0

Three Times,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638595,"And so friends, we come to what was a difficult passage for me.  The rest of the post (copied and pasted from Facebook will explain what happened next.  This was after I stated at Home in the Woods.On the Appalachian Trail.Neel Gap. Mile 31.3.Hello friends. WARNING. Possibly long post.So Arthur-n-Me made it to Neel Gap to a place called Mountain Crossings. They are trail outfitters. Stayed overnight at a wonderful B&B in Blairsville GA. Set out yesterday morning, made it to mile 35.5 and decided to camp for the night. Arthur was complaining the whole way. Going uphill is not too bad, but downhill is agonizingly slow. Left knee won't bend properly. Have to always use the right knee to step down. Both knees are sore. Actually Arthur had a problem with downhill all the way. I thought trekking poles would handle the issue but they do not. At that pace, it will take years to complete the hike. Last night was gale force winds with lots of rain. This kind of forced the issue so Arthur decided he wasn't up to the rest of the trip. To be clear, I'm coming home. To put an exclamation point on it, as Arthur-n-Me were hiking back to the pick up point (4 1/2 miles in the rain), the tent somehow slipped off the pack and is lost forever. Probably an omen to heed. I have to pick up a package in Marion GA. Then another package in Franklin, NC. After that home. Not sure how long all that will take. We'll be there when we get there. It is disappointing, but please don't feel sorry for me. It was a grand idea and we gave it our best shot. I have no regrets. The best thing to come from all this is the love and support you all have given me leading up to this. You all mean so very, very much to me. I met some great people along the way and have memories enough for a lifetime. I mean it when I say I love you all. See you soon.",,View Entry,"Mar 16, Tue",0
Three Times,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638596,"This post is self explanatoryHalf on, half off the A. T.Franklin, NC. Hello friends. So Arthur-n-Me have retrieved the last package we needed to pick up. We will board a plane in Atlanta tomorrow, (Friday), and head home. I wanted to comment on one of the things going on as I hiked in the rain on the way back to the pick up point. Kenneth Spiller already knows where this is headed. As I was walking a song occurred to me. ""And I'll walk in the rain of His mercy. Let it soak me down to the bone. I'll splash in it's puddles and dance in it's streams as I go, by the grace of God, all the way home"". Andrew Peterson Friends, when you're tired, you have miles to go and stopping is not an option, you're all alone, and dirty and there is no sunshine anywhere; Jesus is there. Whatever way you have of calling on Him, if you are His, He will be there. He has been with me every step of this journey.",,View Entry,"Mar 18, Thu",0
Three Times,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638597,"The story isn't over yet.Blairsville GA. 57° Sunny. 59°/27° 725 miles off trail.Hello friends. There is an old saying, ""It ain't over 'til the fat lady sings"". When I left the trail, I had no (and still don't) regrets for deciding to turn around. It was the right thing to do. But the trail is never completely out of mind for Arthur-n-Me.When we got back, out good friend Cydni Shepherd Choate told us about Voltaren. It is a topical anti-inflammatory gel you use on the joints. After one week, results were very promising. After two weeks, results are so promising Arthur-n-Me have decided to return to the trail in July and finish the state of Georgia. We left the trail at mile 35.5. The GA/NC border is at mile 78.1. The plan is to go on to Winding Stair Gap at mile 109.4 which will put us at the hostel where we stayed last time. We will return from there. I won't speculate beyond that but this trip will definitely be a time of evaluation. The next phase is to be much more intentional about strengthening the legs; something that was sorely lacking last time. Lastly, I need to replace the tent that was lost. I am looking at one. I think the one that was lost was/is the superior tent. But this other one is comparable in size, almost the same weight (the lost one is slightly lighter) and it's half the cost of the lost one. It also might go on sale in May.So that is where things stand for now. Thanks for all your love and support. For those of you of the praying persuasion, prayers are definitely appreciated.",,View Entry,"Apr 03, Sat",0
Three Times,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638598,"From this point friends, is the saga of Arthur-n-Me getting ready to return to the trail.  We have chosen July 12 as the day to begin.  We sill start from Neel Gap.  You will see pictures that don't usually end up in a journal about hiking the A T.  But this is all of a piece about getting back there.Blairsville GA 69° Drizzle 53°/74° 725 miles off trail.Hello friends. The last time Arthur-n-Me posted, we said the next phase after the knees, is strengthening the legs. We are using the bicycle as a major part of the program. Today we rode 5 miles. 8 km for my European friends. That is not very far in the grand scheme of things. My Dutch friend Jan Blokker wouldn't even be getting started at that point. He and his friends will go for a 90 km ride just for fun. 56 miles for my American friends. Neither would my friend Kenneth Spiller . Even 14 yr old David Spiller wouldn't be breathing hard. It is a start however, as well as an improvement over where we started. This is just a signpost on the obsessive road Arthur-n-Me have chosen to travel. The Georgia mountains spanked our behind last time and sent us home. Challenge accepted. Thanks again for all your love and support.",,View Entry,"Apr 08, Thu",0
Three Times,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638599,"Hello friends. There is a principle in physics, ""Two objects cannot occupy the same space at the same time"". This applies to bicycles and motorcycles as well. I tried to investigate this principle today and I can report, from direct observation, that it is true. Not to worry. Motorcycle and rider are o k. The bicycle had only minimal damage and should be an easy fix. I got checked out at the hospital. Everything is o k with a few bumps and bruises. I'll be sore for a few days, but should be just fine.

Hello friends. So this is the first pitch of the new tent. Arthur-n-Me have had it almost a week but it has been very rainy. Yes, we know. The tent is supposed to shelter us from the rain. The problem has been that the ground is so soft it won't hold the stakes. So we braved the mosquitos and pitched the tent. It came out o k but will require another set up probably. It has a peak vent which we like and has even tried to copy what is called the pitch lock corners on the other tent. It does have the standard hook and loops on the fly and the inner net. The other tent used magnets which we liked a whole lot more. This will do for July and we will evaluate things when we get back. Only 47 days to go. It might not look like it at times, but Arthur-n-Me are VERY ready to go. That's all for now.",,View Entry,"Apr 26, Mon",0
