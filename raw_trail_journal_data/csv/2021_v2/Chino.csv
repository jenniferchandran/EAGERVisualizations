Chino,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625650,"I was seriously injured about two and a half months ago in a ""car being smashed by a big rig"" accident.  Unfortunately, I was in the car that was T-boned.  Although this recovery is slow, painful and has many months to go, I wanted to set my next hiking start date to motivate me and get excited about what I am passionate about -- long distance hiking.  The lung, ribs, back and spleen will eventually heal and I will someday be able to sleep in my own bed instead of an electric recliner.  My body may have been broken but my spirit is strong!  The one thing I can do is walk.  Almost every day I attempt to walk five miles.  I know it is not the 19 miles I averaged on my last hike, but it is a start and I'm happy with that.  For the outpouring of love and support I've received since my accident, I say thank you to all.  To the readers who haven't met me or don't know me, thank you for reading this and following my journal.  To my fellow hikers: I can't wait to see you, talk with you and suffer through the pain, rain and pointless ups and downs of the trail with you.  The hike is worth it and you will make lifelong friends and experience some of the finest nature views on this planet.",,View Entry,"Jan 08, Wed",0
Chino,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625654,"In life we tend to forget the bad times and remember the good times.  That principle applies to long distance hiking as well.  As I got pumped up at the thought of another AT hike, I skimmed my past journals and had many chuckles as I recalled memorable events.  Although we set the goal of reaching Big K at the start of our hike, the real joy comes in forming relationships and building esprit de corps.  Pride in your own accomplishments become pride in the family of hikers attempting the same goals.  A common loyalty builds and a true fellowship is formed.  Since hikers take zero days at differing times, or are off the trail for a day or two, crossing paths with them again is like seeing a long lost friend from decades ago.  You become overcome with excitement and are eager to share stories.  I know this hike will bring a new set of lifelong friends and the opportunity to run into past hikers who live near the trail.",,View Entry,"Jan 09, Thu",0
Chino,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625658,"I would be remiss if I didn't list some of Chino's rules of hiking, which may be helpful to both new and returning AT adventurers.  Rule #1: Don't get killed!  You may scoff at this rule but you'll have many opportunities to violate it.  The time I climbed to the top of a mountain in a thunderstorm and realized I was standing next to a huge, metal, relay tower comes to mind.  Rule #2: Never trust another hiker's opinion when it comes to distance (it's only a mile from here), degree of difficulty (you can easily do 25 miles from this shelter), or how long something will take (shouldn't take us an hour to climb).  This leads me into Rule #3: Nike -- Just do it!  You trained and prepped to hike almost 2,200 miles.  Don't let the naysayers and pessimists sway any of your decisions.  The mountain isn't going to move and will still be there tomorrow so hike it today.  Don't let a little snow, ice or rain stop you from hiking.  I've met many people who don't hike because of the weather forecast.  Rule #4: If you stay ALL day and night in a shelter because you didn't want to hike in the nasty elements, please make room or vacate the shelter for the next day's hikers who did hike.  Unless you are injured, you shouldn't be in a shelter for more than one night.  This brings me to Rule #5: Never, under any circumstance, set up your tent in a shelter because you are forcing others to set up their tents outside since you've hogged all the space.  Rule #6: Don't complain about snoring, bad gas, people talking in their sleep, hikers getting up to go to the privy and mice running around in a shelter.  That is the price you pay for admission.  If you don't want to experience those behaviors, put up your tent away from the shelter.  Rule #7: (This may be the second most important rule of all).  Never resupply while your hungry!  I remember coming across a hiker in a shelter eating a 5-pound canned ham.  Kosher, if you are reading this, you are my example.  When you are voraciously hungry, you'll make some bad decisions about food purchases.  I remember buying so much inappropriate food that I couldn't fit it into my food bag.  Rule #8: Hike your own hike.",,View Entry,"Jan 09, Thu",0
Chino,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625803,"Since I'm in my third month of recovery mode and can't drive, I took all of my hiking gear out of my garage and accomplished a thorough inventory.  I try to stick with the ""lighter the better"" model.  That's right, I'm the person that cuts his comb in half to save a minuscule amount of weight.  My wife insisted I carry a five ounce cell phone last hike.  In 2005, cell phones didn't exist and I survived by carrying a prepaid phone card.  You'd be hard pressed to find a pay phone today!  Most areas of gear I am set.  I have a nice quilt, frogg toggs, high R-value blow up sleeping pad, Ursak for the Southern portion of hike, OR low gaiters, newer hiking poles, etc.  Not having to heat up water or food saves me a significant amount of weight.  What I need is to replace my Mariposa pack from Gossamer Gear.  After more than 4,400 miles of use, it has been beaten up and needs to be trashed.  I highly recommend this lightweight but sturdy pack to those who may be new to hiking or those that are not satisfied with their current pack (approximately 2 lbs).  The last big ticket item are hiking shoes.  After experimenting with ""whatever I could find"" in trail towns to replace worn out shoes in 2005, I came across the Vasque Juxt.  I love this shoe and went through three pair in 2013.  They don't seem to make it 700 miles and when they fail, the heal deteriorates quickly.  I'm contemplating buying four pair just in case.  Except shoes, I've found you can get anything on the AT and don't need to send resupply boxes.  Finally, I researched the 2021 Spring Break schedule for colleges in the area and the limits are between March 6 to March 21, which should keep more hikers off the trail for the first part of my hike.  I have an important, out of town, visit to a thoracic surgeon in four days to determine why my lung and ribs are slow to heal.  I'm hoping for a good prognosis.",,View Entry,"Jan 16, Thu",0
Chino,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626332,"Medical update - Today marks the 4-month point since my life-changing accident.  Great news!  The scheduled major lung surgery has been canceled since the CT scan shows the right lung is still healing and the capacity is above 90%.  I'm now addressing my shoulder/neck issues.  I had an MRI on my right shoulder yesterday and await the outcome.  The doctor says I might have a bicep detachment and/or rotator cuff tear.  Physical therapy began yesterday for those areas and totally wiped me out.  The therapist seemed optimistic that I may recover without surgery.  I pray he is right.  Although it is still too painful to sleep in my bed, I am healthy enough to drive, which is a huge step in my recovery.  I know my wife is sick of taking me to these seemingly endless appointments.  Next up is to consult a back specialist since I still have huge areas of constant tingling/numbness from the point of my back fracture all the way down my left side to the knee and expanding over my thigh.
Hiking update - I received my new Gossamer Gear Mariposa pack with hipbelt in the mail.  The upgrades from my original pack, bought in 2004, are awesome and I can't wait to be healthy enough to try it out.  Since I was unimpressed with the Sawyer Mini on the Colorado Trail, I've decided to try out the Sawyer Squeeze.  My plan is to use the squeeze for immediate drinking needs and then fill up a liter bottle and use bleach and flavoring packets to carry with me.  This plan allows me to forgo the 20-minute wait for the bleach to work and I can stay more hydrated and still carry only 2 pounds of water at any given time. Another change in my hiking philosophy is the use of my tent.  On my first thru, I did NOT use my tent at all.  On my second thru, I used my tent maybe less than ten times.  My initial plan is to use my tent more this hike, especially in the beginning until I've passed most of the bubble.  My reasoning is to prevent illness (which I got the night before Springer from a fellow hiker that never stopped coughing in the hostel and infected all); increase flexibility (I won't be tied down to doing miles tied to shelter location).  This plan may easily change if the weather is nasty.  I will plan to use a shelter if it is pouring rain, snowing heavily or the winds are above 30 knots (of course I am required to use a shelter in Smoky Mountain National Park).  I've roughly planned out my trip from approach trail to Damascus and plan to accomplish this in 29 days or less (the time it took on previous hikes), depending on health and weather.  Damascus is a great place for a Zero Day.",,View Entry,"Feb 21, Fri",0
Chino,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627051,"Happy St. Patrick's Day!  I'm planning on starting my next thruhike one year from today from the top of Amicalola Falls.  No criticism please -- I hiked the entire approach trail on my first thru.  It seems like a lifetime ago when I got off the train in Gainesville, took an expensive cab ride to the park and started my hike.  Fifteen years and 2 hikes later, I'm hoping my health recovers enough to even attempt another hike.  Medical Update: My recovery seems to be moving at a snail's pace.  My last shoulder MRI shows a significant, high-grade, 70% tear which is 11 mm wide.  This is my third week of physical therapy (torture) 3 times per week.  The surgeon will determine if surgery is necessary on April 14th.  I am still unable to sleep in a bed because of the shoulder and intense rib area pain when attempting to lie down or get up from a supine position (of course necessary to use a tent or sleep in a shelter).  My doctor asked me what I primarily did to train for a long distance hike.  I told him stair climbing, so he recommended I begin training to assess my health.  For the last 2 and a half weeks I went to the tallest building in town (8 story building at the University of Kansas) and started to train.  I currently climb 40 flights of stairs (2 steps at a time on the way up), 3 times per week.  Every week I'll increase 8 flights until I progress to 80 flights.  In the past, I would work up to wearing a full pack, but I am unable to carry one because of my shoulder.  Although my lung capacity seems fine, I have discomfort at the top of a full inhalation during exercise.  Good news - I started driving!  It gives me great independence and frees up my wife from taxiing me everywhere.  After 5 months after my accident I thought I would be much healthier but I realize the importance of living in the moment and appreciating the ""little things.""",,View Entry,"Mar 17, Tue",0
Chino,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627624,"Wow! The world as we know it drastically changed since my last update due to the Corona virus.  After recovering in my home for 5 months after my accident, the government tells me I must self-isolate just when I'm able to drive again.  Oh, well.  This too shall pass.  I feel bad for all the hikers and trail angels (Fresh Ground) that were forced off the trail.  I know many of your lifelong dreams have been crushed.  If the trail is open next year and your schedule permits, I hope to see you out there.  I remembered one more important hiking rule -- Stop hiking before you enjoy the beautiful views.  This will prevent any run ins with trees, bushes or other dangers.  Medical Update: I met with my shoulder surgeon via Zoom this week and he is giving me 6 weeks to be able to sleep in my bed without pain.  If not, surgery is likely.  Because of this, I am counting on my 2 physical therapy doctors to get me back to ""normal.""  The virus closed down the university building I used to climb stairs, so I hike at least 40 flights, 3 times a week outside (proper social distancing, of course).  Since the surgeon has cleared me to stair climb with a full pack (not using my right arm to put it on), I am so excited to break out my new Gossamer Gear Mariposa and put it to the test.  To add injury to injury, I had to have an upper tooth extracted yesterday!  It seems the impact of my accident caused 50% of my tooth to shear off and the exposed part was near the nerve which caused much discomfort.  Stay safe and healthy.",,View Entry,"Apr 17, Fri",0
Chino,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627828,"Warning - Anticipation on the trail will bring you down mentally and emotionally.  Nothing worse than getting to your fourth false summit only to realize you are NOT at the top or hoping the next turn or clearing brings the much anticipated shelter, only to find you have another hour to go!  Although pain and rain are part of the AT and clearly expected, you have to do your best to overcome your wandering mind that attempts to set an unrealistic expectation.  It's bad enough when you crave a burger, fries and Coke (or pizza, beer, etc.) for three days and it consumes your every thought.  Do your best to avoid anticipating.  Many hikers I've encountered failed because they focused on how many miles to Big K and it depressed them.  My technique is to accomplish one day at a time -- a series of day hikes, so to speak.  I'd set a mileage goal for that day and try to get there.  Sometimes you can meet your goal (and maybe go another 6 miles because you're at the shelter at 1300) and sometimes you can't (it has rained, sleeted or snowed all day or your blisters are killing you).  New Pack: Although I'm planning on starting a little later (March 17) than last time, I still need to carry winter gear which increases my pack weight.  I'll plan on sending home my warm coat and waterproof claw glove covers around Damascus.  In 2013, I did NOT carry winter gear and it was a big mistake since so much snow fell in the Smoky Mountains and temps were in the teens.  My new Mariposa 60 pack is totally different to my old one.  It has many outside pockets and I am having difficulty reaching my liter water bottle, even after making many adjustments.  With all gear, a liter of water and NO food, my pack weighs in at 20 lbs.  For me, that is heavy.  At least my appetite doesn't kick in until day 11 or 12, so I can carry less food at the beginning.  Since I don't cook, my pack weight will be around 27 lbs on day one.  Medical Update: Neurologist confirms nerve damage causing a large area of numbness/tingling in my lower back, down my left leg and over my thigh.  Since he can't pinpoint what needs to be fixed surgically, I'll continue with PT to possibly alleviate the condition.  My right shoulder is still preventing me to sleep in bed throughout the night without pain.  Stay healthy and continue to train my friends.",,View Entry,"May 03, Sun",0
Chino,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628263,"I practiced setting up my Tarptent Notch the other day.  Since it has been many years since I've used it, I was amazed it only took me 7 minutes to put it up.  It wasn't perfect, but it would have gotten me through the night if I was on the trail.  I had to replace the stakes it came with because they were too flimsy and short and could not be used in all conditions.  I bought some generic metal stakes that are much hardier and easier to use.  I happened upon the rerun of North Woods Law that was looking for the missing hiker Inchworm in Maine back in 2013.  I had just finished my second thruhike about 2 to 3 weeks before she went missing and I was wondering when I passed her or if I had ever met her.  Very sad!  From what I researched, she became disoriented while leaving the trail to go to the bathroom.  To prevent ""Chinoblazing"" (getting lost by inadvertently leaving the marked trail), I would leave my pack on the trail, take my toiletry bag, and go into the woods at a distance where I could still see my pack.  Before I went into the woods, I would point both hiking poles in the direction I was heading so when I returned I knew which direction to hike.  I know it may sound silly, but it is very easy to get disoriented.  Just ask Mississippi Alan who took a wrong turn out of a shelter and ended up at the LAST shelter before realizing the error.  It happens to the best of us.  Medical update: After 7 months since my accident, I actually spent at least 6 hours in my own bed for 5 nights in a row!  I was very restless and did not sleep for more than an hour at a time, but it is progress.  My rib cage is very sore and prevents me from sleeping on my stomach (my preferred method for over 60 years).  Physical therapy for my shoulder is going well.  I am pleased to say I can now, with some difficulty, reach my water bottle on my pack.  As my therapy for my shoulder comes to an end, my therapy for my back pain that radiates down my leg begins.  I've increased my pack weight to 20-pounds and climb 40 flights of stairs 3 times per week after therapy.  Recovery is a slow process but I am so grateful for everything.  I look forward to seeing many of you on the trail.",,View Entry,"May 28, Thu",0
Chino,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628814,"The last of my gear is bought and paid for!  The AT ball cap will keep the rain out of my eyes while wearing my Frogg Toggs.  Although I'll still use bleach to purify my water most of the time, I bought an MSR Trailshot filter to try.  The reviews were mostly positive and it lets me drink immediately instead of 20 minute wait with bleach.  The last item is a replacement watch.  The vibration alarm and waterproof features are the main reasons I chose the Timex Expedition.  I had previously purchased three pairs of Vasque Juxt hiking shoes.  My wife will send me one pair to Daleville, VA and the other pair to Kent, CT (my only two mail drops).  Training is going well.  I'm still climbing approximately 40 flight of outside stairs at the University of Kansas three times a week while carrying a 20-pound pack (all gear minus food).  Medical Update: After seven months since my accident, my physical therapy treatments have finally ended.  I've been given a series of stretches and strengthening exercises to accomplish on a regular basis at home.  Unfortunately, I still am unable to sleep in my bed because my rib cage is very sore and I can only put pressure on my right side for a short time.  I sleep on a couch or recliner for a few hours at a time and need to nap during the day.   I'll probably have to live with back numbness/tingling and regular, sharp pain for the rest of my life.  I am so grateful to have dodged major lung and shoulder surgeries.  Keep training.",,View Entry,"Jun 27, Sat",0
Chino,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629339,"My wife Becky (Mrs. Chino) and I were honored to host the premier trail angel for the night as he transitions from the Appalachian Trail to the Pacific Coast Trail.  Freshground and his Leapfrog Cafe have provided much needed trail magic to AT hikers since 2013.  He is truly a great person, role model and friend.  The three of us talked well into the night after he gave us a tour of the new shower attachment on his van.  The AT's popularity has grown ten fold since my initial hike in 2005.  In 2013, I started on March 13th and was shocked and amazed by the number of hikers on the trail.  It took me at least three to four weeks to get ahead of the bubble.  Freshground came up with an interesting proposal of starting in mid-February when hiker numbers are down compared to the big crowds from the first of March through mid-April.  Of course, the major down side to this is very cold and possibly snowy weather, especially through the Smoky Mountains.  I realize the weather is so unpredictable.  My first hike, which began in early March, gave me 70 degree temps hiking through the Smoky Mountains and eight years later it gave me hip-deep snow drifts and single digit temps at night which forced me, and many others, to abandon the trail and go into Gatlinburg for a zero.  The upside of starting early is being further ahead of the bubble and no foliage so I can have better vistas.  Another plus is the bears may not be stirring at that point in Georgia, North Carolina and Tennessee.  I will have to contemplate my options before making a commitment one way or another.  I've curtailed my training to twice weekly since my start date is so far away.  Keep training.",,View Entry,"Jul 18, Sat",0

Chino,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631722,"A couple of weeks ago I went ahead and got my first tattoo on the first anniversary of my accident.  I designed it as a visual reminder of my gratitude and what a big part the AT plays in my life.  On the trail, I can look down at the front of my left leg and be reminded that, no matter how difficult or how painful, I am blessed to be able to even ATTEMPT a thruhike.  Last week I went to my neurologist and he said the back pain/tingling will probably always be with me and any surgery would potentially make it worse.  As I took off my shoes and socks for an evaluation, the doctor noticed I had a bunion issue on both feet.  He recommended hiking toe socks.  I never heard of them until he took off his shoes and showed me.  I am anxiously awaiting my sock order and the opportunity to try them out.  I also have ordered green Superfeet since the local outdoor store was out of my size.  If you're new to hiking, I highly recommend these inserts, especially in Pennsylvania, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine where you are in rock city.  Lastly, I cut some weight by transitioning from the regular Frogg Toggs rain suit to the Frogg Toggs Ultra lite 2 which totals a little over 10 ounces.  I've gained my Covid-19 pounds and am planning to keep the weight up until the hike.  Both previous hikes I ended up losing between 40 and 47 pounds.",,View Entry,"Nov 05, Thu",0

At the gap, hikers I passed yesterday were slack packing and noticed my distinctive orange winter hat so their husband gave Jim and me a ride to the hotel. Unfortunately, it took over 4 hours to get into our rooms. During that time I counseled Jim on what gear to send home dropping his pack weight approximately 12 pounds.

Beginning with predawn, cold rain he attempted to dampen tents and hiker spirits.  Many succumbed and would not hit the trail. Chino and his small band persevered. Donning rain gear and pack covers, nothing would stand in their way. The god Nohike was infuriated and sent torrential rains and cutting winds which deafened the hikers. He focused his powers on Chino who slipped on the saturated granite on Mount Albert and almost violated rule #1 (don't get killed). Next Nohike blew out the seams of Chino's new rain bottoms and caused much discomfort by blasting cold water onto exposed skin. Finally, the weary band succumbed and stopped at a shelter to prevent hypothermia. Nohike was victorious. Not so fast as the group, against all odds, continued with their quest.

Not so!  Steve and Debbie, a couple out doing trail magic for their very first time, came to my rescue. A PB & J sandwich, cold beer, 2 Atkins bars and a sucker guaranteed I'd finish the day.

The usual sounds of snoring, talking in your sleep, bodily gas expansion and loud groans when rearranging the body were heard.  And that was just from me!  Within minutes of getting in bed, a pretty female jumped in bed with me. At first I was startled but thought this is what happens in Tennessee. We snuggled most of the night until about 0530 when the Tabbie decided to get on my chest and purr. I got up and hit the trail at 0606. My back bothered me all day. Of course, a big two hour climb greeted me. It started raining but it was barely warm enough to keep going without rain gear. That didn’t last. Cold, driving rain with high winds forced me to don my rain top. On top of Max Patch it was so miserable. I swear it was sleeting.

The animals must of thought I was strange climbing a nearly thousand foot with one hiking pole and carrying a pole and a phone with flashlight in the other. Twenty minutes later it was just light enough to put the phone away and use both poles. Thunder kept getting closer and louder as the summit neared. I kept playing the safety protocol for lightning strikes in my head: throw down poles and crouch on tiptoes when hair on body stands up. Fortunately, not a drop of rain until later in the day. Since this was a longer NERO than normal, I put it in high gear and made town in record time (by 1045) without eating (poor decision). Solitude was spotted with about 6 miles to go. He is still nursing a sore knee so I went on by. Just before town I ran into Rebecca and Stephanie, Solitude’s sisters climbing up trail to surprise him. Shortly after talking to them the clouds spewed heavy rain which lasted for hours. The Hostel employees are super friendly and courteous. The place must be at full capacity, especially since most hikers are weather adverse. Walking into town in a downpour was not fun but necessary. The restaurant I looked forward to was closed (because of a funeral). Instead, I got a huge Greek salad and a Coke at a different place. Eleven dollars was spent sending almost 2 pounds of gear home. Batteries, rain pants and much needed body glide were purchased at the outfitters. One of the Hostel employees made me my best meal on the trail-a huge sandwich with 10 slices of meat, greens, raw onions and mustard. Delicious! Earlier in the day Solitude’s sisters provided the most delicious cookies. Thanks. After rearranging my pack, I need to stretch.

Since there is no Wi-Fi or cell service, Mike and I are hoping to get a ride back to the trail at 0830.","Thomas Knob Shelter

Chino,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647957,"I was greeted by a fresh layer of snow this morning. Mike, whose trail name is now Mega since he’s lived in Maine and Georgia, and I were fortunate to get a ride from Bruiser’s shuttle driver back to the trail. Although it was very cold, the 40 mph winds at the ridge lines were nearly unbearable. I still overdressed and was soaking from wearing too many layers. Unless it’s raining, I’m not wearing my FroggToggs rain gear since it doesn’t breathe. First trail magic today. A nice man from a local church gave me a doughnut and coffee. I wish I could have stayed longer to chat but you get cold fast when you’re not moving. Tonight is another dangerously cold night. Mega and I decided to hitch about 6 miles into Marion. The couple who picked us up gave us an auto tour of the town and said they’ll take us back to the trail at 1100 since cabs don’t work on Sunday. After a Mexican meal and Walmart resupply, it’s time to relax.","VA 650 Troutdale Church Hostel

Chino,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647975,"Big thanks to Fresh Ground for bringing MeGa and me hot fudge sundaes at the hotel. Dickey picked us up at 1100 and we were hiking 15 minutes later. Another cold day well below freezing with monstrous winds cutting to the bone. With 4 days of food my pack seemed heavy. Once over Glade Mountain the hiking was fairly easy. At least a quarter of a mile away you could hear the humming and crackling of the high tension electrical lines. I quick stepped it to get passed them. Hiking under I-81 and the cacophony of traffic noise reminded me how peaceful it is in nature. While setting up camp we talked with a nice couple interested in hiking. Since temperatures may dip into the teens, it’s time to bundle up and stay warm.","Marion, VA Econolodge

Chino,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648005,"Yesterday I twisted my right knee. I didn’t think much of it until I wrenched it again today which made the knee swell up considerably. I just walked through the pain until I could not walk downhill normally. The pain worsened. Any descent was excruciating and it became sore just having weight on it. The hobbling down Lynn Camp Mountain for 2.5 miles to the road took forever. I wasn’t going to sit and wait for a car to be on this road in nowhere so I went eastbound for a long time until I waved down an older man in a pickup. He wouldn’t give me a lift but told me someone a half mile down the road could. Eventually I came across “Geeves,” a very gracious lady that drove me quite a ways into Bland, Virginia to the only motel in town.  She wouldn’t take any money and even bought me a sandwich and dropped it off at my door since she knew I couldn’t walk. I am so grateful for the kindness she showed. The kindness of strangers continues to amaze. I’m icing my knee, taking anti-inflammatory meds and elevating the knee. I’m pretty sure it’s a LCL sprain. I’ll probably stay another night and reevaluate. If I can get back on trail I’ll skip the huge climbs and descents at first until I’m 100%. As long as I can enjoy any part of the trail, I’ll take it.","Campsite North of Atkins, Virginia

Chino,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648048,Fresh Ground started my injury recovery day by brewing me coffee in my motel room and bringing me enough food to get through the day. The most important gift was a knee brace that should help stop any further undue twisting. I implemented the RICE principle and plan to head to the trail at VA 52 in the morning. I’m very nervous but cautiously optimistic that I can continue my hike. Pearisburg is only 40-some miles away and I will reevaluate at that point. I appreciate all of you who are sending positive thoughts.,"VA 625

Chino,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648105,"Overall, the knee held up fairly well. Downhills, especially over twenty degrees, were especially painful. The weather turned for the better with temps in the 50s or 60s maybe. The cool breeze at ridge line was a welcome relief from the past few hiking days. The lack of water made it slightly challenging. I’m glad I fully hydrated before hitting the trail. Staying at Weary Feet Hostel with MeGa and Red Dawn. Paying extra for dinner and breakfast.","VA 612

Her dog Buddy was adorable and definitely enjoyed the leftovers. It poured overnight and was raining lightly when we hit the trail. The first 8 miles may be the easiest section on the AT. The following 1,300 foot climb wore me out. Instead of staying at Docs Knob Shelter, we decided to go 3 more miles to put us closer to town. With rain and snow in the overnight forecast, we may regret the decision. A little over 6 miles to Pearisburg.","VA 606 Hiker Weary Hostel

Few things are worse than packing up a wet, heavy tent. Unfortunately, I ran out of water last night and there were no water sources today. At 0815 it started sleeting and winds were high. Magnolia, a Southbound hiker, passed us. She is finishing from last year since she had to leave the trail with a broken ankle. We overshot the road to town and was picked up right away and were dropped off at the Holiday Motor Lodge at 1030. After laundry and a shower, MeGa and I headed for the Mexican restaurant where we ran into Yoda, a thruhiker out of San Diego. After a 4-day resupply at Food Lion, it was time to relax, recuperate and eat, eat, eat!","Unofficial Campsite

Chino,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648248,"Last night’s hotel was the nastiest place I’ve ever stayed. No ice machine, no coffee pot or trash can in the room and no cable box (until we insisted they bring us one).  I had to sign for the laundry room key which had one working dryer that didn’t dry my clothes. It looked like most tenants lived there permanently since there were many dogs in many rooms. The smell of dope permeated the grounds. Hit the trail at 0720 after retracing some of our steps since we entered town the incorrect way. A long bridge walk in town before we entered the woods to start the 3 hour and 20 minute climb.  Since it’s the weekend, I saw many day hikers and a trail maintainer. Coolest part of the day was a 2-ship fighter formation flying directly above me at low level. The never ending descent into the shelter tore up my knee. The pain level is at an 8 and I’m quite concerned. I took a prescription anti inflammatory pill at 1800, put on the compression knee sleeve and am in my tent with my right leg elevated. We’ll see what tomorrow brings, especially since there is 2 big descents. I don’t have cell service but I’m hoping KU is winning tonight. Rock chalk!","I-460 Pearisburg,Virginia

Chino,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648249,"Congratulations to KU for making it to the NCAA tournament championship!  Sadness for me since I need to leave the trail because my right knee is a complete, painful mess. For the first time my knee locked up for about 3 seconds. After I straightened it and put weight on it, I let out a yell that would curl your hair. Pain level 10. The final mile downhill was excruciating. I couldn’t bend my leg more than 10 degrees and the pain was awful. I definitely don’t want to permanently damage it but I’m pretty sure that already happened. In 11 and a half days I hiked over 200 miles and made a friend in MeGa. I observed deer, owl, all kinds of birds, butterflies and so much more. Since I’m in the middle of nowhere, I’ll have to potentially hike 29 miles to arrange my way home. Fortunately, Roanoke, Virginia is close by and I should be able to get a flight home. The next couple of days hiking may be dicey so send me good vibes. Thanks","Pine Swamp Branch Shelter (Tenting)

Chino,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648280,"My final night on the trail was cold. Condensation covered my sleeping bag this morning. MeGa graciously hiked behind me as I hobbled out of camp not knowing how I would escape from the trail and reenter society. The short 2.5 mile hike down to the road was arduous and with every step my knee pulsated with pain. Since AT&T’s coverage is known to be spotty on the trail, MeGa kept checking his service status. No service. From a clearing above where we could see the road, he checked again. No service. Just for kicks I checked my AT&T connection—2 bars!  What a relief. I talked with shuttle driver Sprockets and he said he wasn’t very busy today and he’d be at the road in about 45 minutes or so. Goofy came by where I was waiting. He was complaining that his food was running out so I reached into my pack and gave him 3,000 calories of “nutrition.”  Now I sit in the Quality Inn Roanoke pondering my next move. I’m a big believer that everything happens for a reason.  I’m proud of my 5,000 miles plus on the AT.  The trail has taught me much and I appreciate it.","Laurel Creek Shelter
