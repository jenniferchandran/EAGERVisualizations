Janet Martin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632680,"Today I'm working on putting my food together, getting some of my gear in order, made our hotel reservation and starting to really get in the mindset that in 3 weeks I'll be on the trail.  This year will be a year of uncertainties - will Covid affect my hike again?  Will the hoard of 17-year cicadas actually come out this year?  Will life in general be a factor?  Only time will tell.  All I know now is I'll start and see how it goes - and take it one step at a time.",,View Entry,"Feb 17, Wed",0
Janet Martin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632900,Had a nice walk with hill work at our local park today with my pack.  I only had about 16 lbs in it (about 1/2 of what I will have total) but it felt good and caused me no real issues.  We'll see how it feels next week when I head out with a full pack.,,View Entry,"Mar 03, Wed",0
Janet Martin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633088,"I had a root canal Monday morning before we headed to Georgia so we got a late start.  We were tired by the time we got to the hotel so wasn't in a hurry to get started.  The road to Springer was slow and bumpy but we finally made it.  David and I hiked the mile to get to the top of Springer, the start of my journey.  We hiked back to the car, said our goodbyes and off I went.  I hiked alone for over 2 miles and stopped at a shelter.  I had planned to spend the night there but circumstances had me leave with Barney to hike on.  Barney is an ex marine from Michigan.  I did run into Rita, Ted and Shirley who I met at Springer and Rita and I planned to stop at the campsite.  There are only 3 of us here at a 30 tent site.  It was a rough day but I was glad to finally get to camp.  I was in my sleeping bag resting at 7 when Rita came and said she couldn't get the bear box lid closed so I went and helped her and back to my tent I went.  It's chilly tonight but was a warm day hiking.That's it for day one.","Springer Mountain

Janet Martin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633148,"I didn't  sleep well last night.  My air mattress has a leak somewhere and it kept deflating during the night.  Every hour or so I was up blowing it back up.  It was a long night.  I got up, got packed up, talked to Rita for a bit and was on trail a little after 8.  I was hoping to get to Gooch Mountain shelter today but Sassafras Mountain had other plans for me.  It was an exhausting day and so I stopped at Justice creek campsite.  Two other hikers were there with me and we had the running creek as background noise all night.  I tied my bear bag to a tree and was in my sleeping bag around 6.  I'm pooped.","Hawk Mountain campsite

Janet Martin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633149,"Another night of fighting my mattress.  Larry, who was at the campground with me said he was going to a hostel and I decided to go also to hopefully get a good night's sleep and then take a zero day tomorrow.  I just think I need some time to recoup before I head to Blood Mountain.   So I'm relaxing here at the hostel, waiting to eat supper and then visiting and off to bed.  The weather was great again today so it was a good day to hike.","Justice creek campsite

Janet Martin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633175,"So today I had a rest day at the hostel.  Dinner, breakfast and laundry are included.  Last night Nimrod made cornbread, red beans and rice and brownies- it was awesome.  Breakfast was really good and spent the day visiting with Ted and Shirley, 3 Times, Wrong Way and then other hikers started trickling in.  Now just waiting on dinner.  Tomorrow it's back to the trail.

Janet Martin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633219,"Last night was another yummy dinner of chili and grilled cheese by Nimrod.  We enjoyed visiting with new hikers and then headed to bed.  This morning Lucky and Nimrod were busy shuttling everyone to different starting points.  Amanda and I were headed back to Woody Gap so we decided to hike together today.  We were both feeling a little discouraged but the hike today as a team was great.  We only had a few miles as Lance Creek is the last place to camp before Blood Mountain without a bear canister.  We got here early, set up our tents and saved a spot for Kate who was coming in later.  Kate and Forward came in together and the campsite is filling up.  I cooked food for the first time today as I had time and was not completely exhausted.  Around 4 it started raining so we all headed for our tents.  When there was a break shortly after we got our bear bags hung on the bear cables.  Tomorrow we climb Blood Mountain and end up at Neel Gap and Mountain Crossing for some purchases.  Time for a campfire then off to bed.

Janet Martin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633257,"Last night we did some visiting with other hikers at a campfire after the rain stopped.  Kate, Amanda and I decided to stay at a cabin at Neel Gap Sunday night so we got that set up.  Soon we were all in our jammies and in our tents for the night.  Got up and Amanda and I headed out around 8:30.  We're pretty close to the same speed so it's nice to have someone to hike with.  It was a very hard day as Blood Mountain is the tallest mountain on the trail in Georgia but we persevered and finally made it to the top around 2:30.  Knowing we could buy pizza at Neel before they closed we took a few pictures and headed down.  We made it to Neel by 4:30 and claimed our ""reward "". It was delicious.  We all showered, ate pizza and are now in our beds before 8:30.  Tomorrow I need to buy a new air mattress and maybe new shoes at Mountain Crossing before we head out.

Janet Martin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633294,"Early this morning I woke up with an awful pain in my hip.  I remembered that I took a fall going over some boulders coming down Blood Mountain and of course wondered, did I break my hip?  By the time I got up several hours later, the pain had subsided some and I ended up walking it out as we got going.  The first thing was a stop at Mountain Crossing to replace my sleep pad and then we were off hiking.  We had 2 or 3 mountains to climb depending on how far we wanted to go today.  It was windy and chilly at times but we started off well and were up and over Levelland Mountain in decent time for our pace.  We decided to stop at Baggs Creek Gap to filter water and take our lunch break.  On the way we passed 3 Times and he also came to the creek while we were there.  We finished our lunch, packed up and were on our way to Cowrock Mountain.  On the way down we were both getting pretty tired and wasn't sure we could make it over Wildcat Mountain to make it to our destination and with the threat of thunderstorms in the forecast for tonight, Amanda decided she needed a break and we called a B &B who is putting us up.  I hadn't planned on stopping quite so often this early but I think a part of the trail is also getting to know the local people who support hikers.  This place is wonderful and we will enjoy a zero here while the bad weather is outside.

Janet Martin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633325,"Today was a great day for a zero as we woke up to a thunderstorm and heavy rain.  We had breakfast, went to town later to pick up a few things and came back to meet some new hikers.  One hiker that stayed last night told us that he was in one of the towers on 9-11.  The things he saw was horrific.  He unfortunately made the decision to leave the trail but gave us his information and said he would help us when we get to New Hampshire where he lives.  Tonight the house is full.  3 Times is here along with Monk and Michael who also know our friend Reta.  We have a tentative plan for the next 5 days but tomorrow is rain so we'll see what happens.","Bed &BREAKFAST

Janet Martin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633364,"Today we only had 5 miles to get to a shelter as the weather today/tonight is supposed to be thunderstorms and heavy rain.  We decided to leave before breakfast, but our hosts said they never send a hiker out without breakfast so we ate before Bonnie took us back to the the trail.  The weather started out great and we immediately had Wildcat Mountain to tackle.  I thought we did pretty good as we were not taking as many breaks as we had been.  The weather stayed nice for the first few hours but then got cooler and foggy.  We were glad to finally get to the shelter before it started raining.  Soon after we got here other hikers started coming in and we have 7 squeezed in for the night.  Thunderstorms are predicted again for tomorrow/tomorrow night so were going to try to get to Blue Mountain shelter tomorrow.  Time will tell.

Janet Martin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633459,"it poured an poured all night long.  We got up and going around 9 and the rain wasn't too bad but the rain overnight made some beautiful waterfalls. The first several miles was fairly easy but then we hit Blue Mountain.   This mountain has a lot of rocks to climb over which really slows you down and wears you out.  It seemed to take forever to do that last couple of miles.   We stopped at the spring and filtered water before going the last tenth of a mile to the shelter.  Since the weather for the night was only calling for rain we decided to set up our tents.   We got set up, went to the shelter for some dinner (I had pulled pork with crushed Doritos and a piece of cheese on a tortilla - delicious) hung our food bags and got into our tents.  It was early but the wind was blowing pretty hard and it was cold.   Amanda has been having foot/leg issues and she has decided to go home.  I will go with her tomorrow and figure out what I'll do.  I found it's not very fun to hike alone and we just haven't seen many people.  Time to do some thinking.

Janet Martin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633482,"Wow was it cold last night.  I thought the wind was going to blow my tent over.  It rained so our tents were very wet this morning.   It's hard to get out of a warm sleeping bag to pack your things up.  We were one of the last ones out of camp.  We only had a few miles today to get back to the B&B so that Amanda could get home.  Bonnie picked us up at Unicoi Gap.  I was undecided what I wanted to do.  I'm not afraid to hike alone but it gets lonely if I don't have someone to be around.  I'm also having some issues with my hip area which is where my pack sits.  I finally decided that I will go back out on trail tomorrow and see what happens.  I'll try to make it to Dicks Creek Gap in a couple of days and make my decision from there.  Unfortunately I may end my hike there and go home but we'll see what happens.

Janet Martin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633528,"So today Amanda and I said our goodbyes and I headed back to the trail.  I got dropped off at 8 and started hiking.  I had 2 mountains today, Rocky mountain and Tray Mountain. Up Rocky started immediately and I think it took me an hour and a half to get to the top.  It was a struggle especially since I'm hiking alone and don't see hardly anyone.  There was a nice view and I took a couple of pictures and moved on. I had a bit of fairly easy trail and stopped for some lunch before tackling Tray. I had heard that it was a tough climb and it was true.  It was hard.  The shelter is just past the top of the mountain and I headed there.for the night.  It's another cold one so out will come the hand warmers.  I'm the only one staying in the shelter tonight.","B&B Unicoi Gap

Janet Martin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633609,"It was a cold night.  I was the only one in the shelter and a few campers.  Around 4 I heard it raining so i got up and took my food bag off the bear cable so it wouldnt be soaked when i packed it up.  Its hard to get out of a warm sleeping bad but i got up, packed up and was headed out in a drizzly fog around 9.  The fog and wind was around all morning with gusts a.couple of times almost blowing me off trail.  The trail wasn't too bad with ups and downs but later in the day I hit Kelly Knob and it was tough - it seemed like it never stopped going uphill.  Fortunately once at the top it was all downhill to the shelter.  I was the only one there at the time so I picked out my spot for the night and hung out.  A bit later 2 young men from northeast Ohio came in then 2 others.  Jake and Christian decided to play cards and asked me to join them for a game of Rummy.  It was a nice way to pass some time.  7:00 I was getting cold so into my sleeping bag I went.  In total there were 4 of us in the shelter - 2 upstairs and 2 down.  I talked to David and asked him to come pick me up.  My adventure here will come to a close on Monday and I'm ok with that.","Tray Mountain Shelter

Janet Martin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633611,"Several times during the night I thought I heard a mouse near me but I'm not sure.  Around 3 I woke up and noticed my air mattress had deflated.  I crawled out of my warm sleeping bag and blew it back up.  Unfortunately it deflated again later so I decided it was time to get up.  I hope a mouse didn't chew a hole in my brand new mattress.   I thanked the Ohio boys for helping me have a nice last evening,  packed up my things and was on my way by 8:00.  I wanted to get to Dicks Creek Gap as early as possible for my ride.  The trail today was wonderful, the weather was very nice and I got to the Gap at 10:45.  David will be here sometime today and we will head home.  I'm ok with my decision to leave.  I guess I'm not as strong as I thought I could be to do the whole trail but 70 miles is pretty darned good and I'm proud of that especially with all the time I spent alone.","Deep Gap Shelter
