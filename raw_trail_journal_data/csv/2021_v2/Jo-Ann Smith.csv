Jo-Ann Smith,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640299,"Well, after 18 months of dreaming and hoping, it looks as though I will be stepping onto the Appalachian Trail on August 5th, 2021.  My husband, Jim and I had other plans for this trip, but the Pandemic changed all that.  Originally, we were going to be your standard Flip-Flopper.  Start in Harpers Ferry then hike to Katahdin, flip down to Harpers Ferry and head south to Springer Mountain.  Its funny, neither one of us was excited to end in Georgia ..but we were fearful of not making it to the top of Katahdin prior to the Winter closure.  Our new plans are exciting! We will be starting on the trail at the Delaware Water Gap in PA ,  then heading southbound for 1400 miles.  Our plan is to finish in Georgia by first week of November.  We will then head back to the trail next Spring and hike North, summiting on Katahdin before August, thus completing our Thru hike in 12 consecutive months.",,View Entry,"Jul 04, Sun",0
Jo-Ann Smith,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641063,"19 days until we hit the trail.  Everyone keeps asking if I'm nervous or afraid of undertaking this adventure.  Honestly, that is the least of my fears.  My biggest fear is that I won't have this house buttoned up properly.  There is so much to think about with the closing down process.  Sure, we have wonderful neighbors and folks we have hired to mow and do Fall leaf pickup, but there is so much more.  Everything done this year was done with a purpose.  Our garden became a community garden with a few other families.  Now, when the main harvest comes in, there will be people to use the food and put the garden to bed.  No potted plants were bought so that no one would have to water outdoor flowers.  The extra rainy weather has been another issue.  I've put up a fence, painted it,  we had the house painted.  Then the rains started. I power washed the deck 2 weeks ago... but its not stained yet, because its always wet.  Every storm this season has knocked down trees in our town, taken out power and caused havoc.  How do you deal with that while you are away... its these little nagging questions.  Also, we live in Connecticut, so if we get back in November, its quite possible we will already have snow.  So, putting away patio furniture and summer items is also on this wet agenda. I know it will all come together, but these are my fears. 
Anyway, inside the house, my husband Jim has been diligently processing about a third of everything we will be eating.  Once the decision was made to hike, we got a dehydrator and he started practicing with different meals.  Jim loves to cook and play with recipes and create things.  He is also very detail oriented - he has been collecting recipes, testing meals, and recording everything.  Now, we are seeing the fruits of his labor as the drop boxes are being filled and getting ready for labeling.  But, until those boxes are sealed I won't believe he is done ~ just yesterday a large container of  M&M's appeared in the mail!",,View Entry,"Jul 17, Sat",0
Jo-Ann Smith,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641124,"I find it amazing. I was happily clicking off everything on my ‘to do’ list…we were less than 20 days from leaving when something I never expected - happened. We had to release our beloved 12-year-old dog, Scuppers to heaven on Sunday.  It seems during one of those relentless thunderstorms Wednesday, he rupture/tore a heart valve. Within three days he was in failure.  The pain in our hearts and the silence in our souls is staggering.  Time has stopped - yet the hours move on.",,View Entry,"Jul 19, Mon",0
Jo-Ann Smith,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641973,"Officially on trail 😊.  Headed out from Delaware Water Gap at noon yesterday.  Hiked 6 miles into Kirkridge Shelter by 4 pm.  Besides my baby toe reminding me it was fractured - my feet did amazingly well. We had the shelter to ourselves during clean up and tent setup and dinner. We met ‘Smatt’ the ridge runner for 41 miles of the trail in this area - very helpful. We had hiked Subway grinders in for the first day and it was a lovely treat. Very quiet out here, not  much hiker traffic at all. Since Jim and I are hiking together, we opted for the Nemo Dagger 3 person tent. We split the weight and it gives us a tad more room. We got up, made coffee and started our hot  soak breakfast- to eat later on the trail.  I had steel oats, dehydrated strawberries, blueberries, coconut and whey protein milk .  I pour the hot water into my freezer bag, put that bag into my 700 ml Vargo Bot cup.. screw the top on, place it in a insulated bag.. and start hiking.","Delaware Water Gap

Jo-Ann Smith,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642019,"Little things….Gosh, so many Med sized rocks. . . Everywhere…..Just big enough to catch your foot if you’re not careful, but not quite big enough to hold your whole foot.  I feel like the old G.I. Joe doll with the articulating feet. Speaking of that … as a young girl in the 60’s Barbie dolls had ‘high heeled’ feet.  G.I. Joe had movable feet. What was that about ?  Barbie had dresses and bathing suits .. and high heeled permanently shaped feet. (This is the kind of thing that floated through my head today.)Prior to this hike I was weaning myself off of caffeine.  I usually drink one large cup a day. That cup is more about the milk and sugar and the ritual - then the coffee. I cannot drink black coffee so I figured I’d have to stop - hence the ‘wean’.  Three days before we left my husband brought home individual packets of Trader Joe’s instant coffee w/cream and sugar included! Game changer !! I am enjoying my one coffee each morning on trail. Not much to see except at a few outlooks at clearings for gas lines or power lines. Lots of green ferns, lush underbrush and poison ivy. Stealth camped last night and staying near the Leroy A. Smith shelter tonight. Volunteers seem to be everywhere out here.

Jo-Ann Smith,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642110,"From Leroy Smith to Danielsville to George Outerbridge tent area.Another beautiful day, with our new legs and our low mileage days, the water shortage for two days was real. We left Leroy Smith with 6.5 liters of water for two of us. At 2.2 lbs/liter it’s heavy. It was another day of rocks and forest covered trail which keeps you out of direct sun but it’s still humid in the Forrest.  At about 4 pm we're sitting on the side of a road dripping with sweat after a grueling day, low on water, sweaty, because of all these sharp, pointy rocks it's still about 82 degrees , we're were looking at another half-mile climb straight up the side of another granite strewn mountain to a tent site. We had enough water to boil for dinner, but Mondays stretch in 90 degree weather and no water source till the end spooked us.I started to download DoorDash- figuring maybe I could order subs and a gal of water. We were at a low place . Then I found a little place on Guthooks (The Country Side Deluxe Suite) (semi B&B) and randomly called, and this wonderful, friendly lady came (she's a hoot!!! We love her!!! ) and picked us up at the trailhead, brought us to the grocery store and before you could imagine we were drinking beers and eating subs sitting at a table in her backyard surrounded by bird houses and garden plants galore. We're took showers, she did our laundry.  We got emotionally and electronically recharged.  She brought us back to the trailhead (we left a case of water for others)….and we started today’s trek.
Today was a lot of nice walking on bigger rocks or grass. We had many views of Lehigh Gap and the town of Palmerton where the zinc factories contaminated the area in the early 1900’s. The clean up has been difficult, revegetation has been ongoing for 3 decades. We had great views as we climbed up a giant Boulder pile just like in the Whites. Very nerve wracking for 15 mins… then a long drop down across the other side to a giant bridge and up the other side. To our tent spot at George Outerbridge all this in the high 80/90 degree temps.

Jo-Ann Smith,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642436,"All my plans and intentions about posting To this journal up every two days or so - hasn’t worked.  Funny.. you think that being out on the trail you would have sooo much time and you do, but the time is when you are walking. It’s time you spend ‘in your head’.  I think of many things I want to share, then we roll into our tenting area.. set up, eat, tidy up and sleep. So here’s a little summery: we are having a blast! Taking our time and staying blister and fall free -  so far.  Big stop this weekend- Sunday was laundry day in Hamburg, then Walmart.. quick ride over to Port Clinton where we stayed in this beautiful grove sustained by St John’s UCC Church.  It was on a river bank - but undrinkable water..water was available 2 blocks away. Was it perfect not really - highway noises all night and 3 long trains passed during the night, but one of the cleanest Port-O-Potty’s and civilization! We have met so many nice people on trail and off.  One guy and his wife were doing an 8.5 mile out and back over a very steep section. He lost one lung yo CA 5 yes ago! You lungs oxygenate your blood, so just imagine! They will be hiking in New Hampshire in a few weeks.  Another 50 ish guy from the UK, currently working in Redding, was training for a hike up Mt Rainier. The people we meet are making this trip so much richer.I am currently sitting in an eclectic barbershop. Civil War memorabilia is mixed in with hunting and trapping items and pelts, there’s Frank Zappa, Jimi Hendrix and Janice Joplin posters. There’s 9 rocking chairs inviting you to hang out - hikers are very welcome to stop in and have a coffee - sit and charge your electronics.  We are waiting for the Post Office to open.JoMaMa","Port Clinton

Jo-Ann Smith,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642717,"Thursday 8/19/21 Big doings this week- last night we hit our first milestone.. 100 miles of walking the AT!!   Doesn’t seem like a real big deal when you consider how much is left…. But I think the first hundred is the hardest. We were so excited that we pushed hard to get to a shelter near a road, near pizza delivery-seriously. Pizza is such good motivator. Lots of nights we stay out in the middle of the woods.. nothing but the dull hum of traffic in the distance, shooting from gun ranges (I kid you not) and cicadas. They start in about nightfall and continue until 4:00 am. Last night we pushed through to the 12 bunk “501 Shelter”.  It’s about a five minute walk to a parking lot and Rt 501 - civilization. We raced to the shelter as Tropical storm Fred chased after us, closed the door and realized we had the place to ourselves. This shelter was a pottery studio at one time and has ~ a 8ft hexagon skylight in the ceiling. We got out of our soaking wet rain gear etc and took turns in a solar shower.. think of that word - SOLAR.  What it really meant is water, that has been sitting two days waiting for sun to come out and warm it…spray onto you with the push of a lever.  You know the spray next to your faucet in the kitchen sink? That lever- that spray..stationary. Three walls, a shower curtain and no ceiling - just open sky. Sounds cool - unless it’s pouring rain on you. Jim went first and had a break in the rain and enjoyed his shower immensely.  Let’s back up a second- we do not have towels with us. Nope, what we have are little pieces of special water wicking cloth maybe 12” x 18”. Not big enough to even wrap around your head. Now back to me and my friend - Fred. I brought a plastic bag with my dry clothes inside. Took my wet clothes off, lathered up and pressed the lever and rinsed off with totally frigid water…but I was happy. Washed my hair, rinsed, froze and then conditioned my hair, rinsed,  froze and then the sky opened. Remember no ceiling, teeny-weeny towel- dry clothes (only dry clothes) in plastic bag! So, I stand in the shower waiting…but Fred isn’t going any where. I quickly wipe down throw on my dirty wet outer clothes slip into on my cloth ?dry? camp shoes and try to run up a muddy incline. Of course, my shoe comes off, I step in the mud and have to go back and rinse off my feet again…with the lever and the nozzle at the top of the shower - but I don’t care because I’m in wet clothes anyway. I finally get to the shelter and I’m like a drowned rat, I open the door and there is Jim perusing the pizza menu.. warm and dry. The rain stops, we order pizza, I change into my dry clothes and offer to pick it up at the road when it gets delivered. They call 5 minutes before they get there…as I’m putting on my precautionary raincoat, the lightening, thunder and rain come back with a vengeance. I wrap my rain coat around me and run out into the rain and realize the path we hiked in on 2 hours ago is now a muddy river. It doesn’t matter there is pizza coming! I get to the car and he gives me the boxed pizza, a styrofoam clam shell with salad, a 2 liter bottle of soda and he’s trying to give me plates and cups- but no bag!!! I decline- take the pizza, salad and soda and scurry up the hill thru the storm before the cardboard dissolves.  Get to the shelter and again.. I’m looking like a drowned rat… but….BEST PIZZA EVER.~ JoMaMa ~","

Jo-Ann Smith,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643161,"Since the last entry we have come off of the ridge line and out of the rocky woods.I am actually able to lift my eyes off my feet without tripping.  We have stopped in Duncannon to experience the Doyle Hotel and eat their famous burger… it was closed !  We stayed instead at a wonderful hostel called “Kind of Outdoorsy”.  Right next to a Trail Laundry..the hostel had nice bunks, loaner clothes and most importantly hot showers!  Jim’s Merrell hiking shoes started breaking down 5 days earlier - and each day his feet were splitting, bleeding and becoming very painful to walk on. Within one hour of arriving at the hostel, he had new shoes selected, bought from a store in Carlisle and store manager, Betsy, was going to bring them back to work the next morning - magical! We enjoyed dinner at The Pub - watching the LL World Series. After dinner I took a walk through town to get a giant ice cream cone - ahh. Next morning - with new shoes on we headed straight uphill to the famous Hawk’s Rock. Beautiful scenery over Duncannon. After that respite we climbed and clawed our way to the Darlington shelter, it was only about 9 miles away but we had a delayed start waiting for the shoes. This shelter is the last good source of water and the last place to camp for 14 miles! Temps were predicted to be in the 90’s. We carried extra water - started very early and made great time until we saw a mirage! We were crossing over the top of Interstate 81- looking down at all the car carriers headed to ‘Corvettes at Carlisle’, all the snazzy Vetts and cool cars buzzing by - when we looked ahead and spotted a tiny Amish Veggie stand!! Like baby turtles heading to the sea- the two of us crossed that road so quickly.  Sure there were beans, potatoes, squash and corn for sale - but they had fresh peaches, tomatoes and raw milk!!  Packs came off and we feasted at the picnic table. I even had homemade chocolate syrup (from a canning jar) ladled into my cold milk. After that break we just had 8 miles of pastures filled with soybeans and corn - in the sun… easy peasy ! The thing is - we did it! On top of that - Jim’s feet are actually healing!

Jo-Ann Smith,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643405,"Longest Day EverSince my last note, we have had some eventful things happen.   We continued through the heat and humidity of the Boiling Springs area with the lovely corn, soybean and hayfields. Walking sure is easier on flat land. Then we headed back up into the mountain ridge again, working at extending our days to increase our miles. We passed all 3 of the ‘AT halfway signs’.  The length of the AT changes for many reason over time, so the midpoint can move. It’s still a nice feeling - even though we are no where near that in our trip. We hiked our first real long day - trying to get to the Pine Grove Furnace State Park where the AT Museum is located prior to a big storm. Hit the first pavilion and the sky’s open - then we found out the complete park was full - not room for one more tent. So, instead we stayed at a hostel called the IronMasters Mansion. We booked two nights to have one complete day to enjoy the area. Choice was $35/ night each for a bunk bed in a room for 12, or $80/ night for a private suite - was there ever a question??  Great use of an old mansion, wonderful front porch. The next day was sunny- we enjoyed the museum and Fuller Lake. We were refreshed! Got a 6:30 am start and haven’t looked back. We passed our 200 mile mark now and due to our increased mileage - we have passed the Mason-Dixon Line and are currently in Maryland. Here’s what has changed - we now get up by 5:15 am.  We have quick coffee and protein something as we pack up. We are hiking before 7:00! We also have started staying in the shelters - if they are empty - no tent to take down in the morning and no heavy tent materials from overnight showers. This alone has easily added 4 extra miles to our days. So, the title today was “Longest Day Ever” and I’m sure you are expecting some  phenomenal mileage number - HA! Yesterday, we hiked a difficult trail, steep and long and ended with only 14.2 miles plus add another mile to gather water after the hike. We purposely pushed hard to climb to this shelter because it’s newer and it has a loft - two important features. TODAY - Is our longest day ! Today - we are getting hammered by tropical storm IDA. We are not going anywhere! There are flash flood warnings and falling tree warnings in this area. We have a covered porch, a bed space 5 feet off the ground and a stable well built log shelter over our heads. …but…. there is only so much you can do with all this down time. We are safe, warm with jackets, we have food and water. The wind is whipping around, the rain is bouncing off the metal roof and we are saturated with moisture.

Jo-Ann Smith,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643816,"Well this week was eventful again! Lots of little milestones were achieved, one being that we reached our 300th mile.  That statement alone is important - but the amazing part is almost every step of the 300 miles is a deliberately watched footstep on the ground.  I don’t think I have ever watched my footsteps as closely as I have on the trail.  As I have said previously, one misstep and the consequences can send you home.  We are still walking in ‘the green tunnel’ area which means there is little to see all day but the path of rocks below you, the ground cover and wild plants that grow up to your knees and then the trees that form the tunnel up and over you. We brought sunglasses and brimmed ball caps, but they are usually stored in our packs.  We are mostly walking in the shade in the forest - even though we are hugging ridge lines.  Some days we only pop into the sun at gas or electric lines crossing between peaks.  You walk out of the cool forest into an oven of sunshine, cross the shoulder high growth and dip back inside into darkness.  Tomorrow, we will enter the Shenandoah National Park and that will change.  I understand there will be some glorious views.Other events of the week included our stop at the Appalachian Trail Conservancy headquarters located at Harpers Ferry, WV.  This is where we got to register our thru hike, have our pictures taken for the hiker yearbook and receive our AT tags that attach to our packs. Our official hike title is ‘Mid-Trail start Thru hike w/Flip-Flop’.  That just means that we started the trail mid-way, we are moving in one direction and then we will move back to the starting point and head in the other direction - all in one 12 month period. Another milestone we achieved was saying good bye to our 3rd state. We have completed Pennsylvania, Maryland and West Virginia.  We are now in Virginia which has about 1/4 of all the miles on the AT approximately 550. 
Grit and I have different hiking styles, so many miles each day we are ‘hiking our own hike’ only to meet up later at pre-designated areas like road crossings, springs or shelters.  This means we are alone a lot during the day. When I was planning this hike, I thought I was going to be ‘present in the woods’ the whole time.  I toyed with the idea of not bringing earphones for my phone. Whew- I’m glad I rethought that!  The first few weeks I was frightened that I might not hear a bear or a rattlesnake or I would miss a babbling brook.  Honestly, that’s over.  I saw more bears and snakes in my yard in CT than I have seen out here. What I find happens to me is I start going deep into my thoughts. Sometimes that can be good and sometimes that can be not so good. Snippets of fond memories can turn into miles of smiles and reminiscing of happy times.  Just as easily, awkward encounters or sad times become heavy and burdensome. It’s hard to put some of that aside and hike on without questioning the “what if’s”.  I know I have read that the person you are when you start the hike, may not be who you are when you leave the hike - but sometime all the thinking is just too much, so that’s were my music comes in. The climbs are easier and the miles pass quicker when I’m listening to my favorite songs. I still haven’t seen a bear or a snake!","

Jo-Ann Smith,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644252,"Wow!  This has been an amazing week.  We both have looked forward to this section of the AT for a while. I visited here by car a few years ago and was stunned by the beauty.  Being able to walk over and around and through it - just a treat!The Shenandoahs start near Front Royal, VA and extend over 100 miles southward…In Front Royal we stayed at the Mountain Home B&B and Cabbin, our hosts were Scott and Lisa Jenkins.  Scott hiked the AT in 2012 and then he and Lisa wanted to find a place near the trail to be used as a hostile.They now have this historically renovated house which is a year round B&B and they restored a log cabin onsite to be used as the hiker Cabbin.  They serve a bountiful breakfast each morning with foods  from local farms. Scott also makes the fresh jams and jellies.  Their place is just 120 steps off the trail. It was a perfect place to resupply, relax before heading into the Shenandoahs. Also bordering the trail there is the Smithsonium Conservation Biological institute’s Center for Species Survival (CSS).  Staff are involved in groundbreaking research pertaining to the conservation of endangered species and ecosystems. Although we didn’t visit, it was great to read about this place and their efforts. It’s a very large protected area of hundreds of acres. The Shenandoah Mtns were challenging but we were afforded many spectacular views during our seven day trek.  Most our days were perfect weather, it rained our last night on the trail.  During that week, we met many hikers who had returned from Mt. Katahdin and were now racing southbound to finish off their hike. The varied types of hikers was interesting, all age groups and genders. Some out to do the long haul and others were doing 100 to 200 mile sections.  We stayed at a few ‘camp sites’ with showers and laundry and multiple shelters.  One shelter in particular, I will never forget. As Grit and I were quietly moving to the ‘loft’ area in the 8:00pm blackness, his headlight lit up a mouse nest. You have never seen two people so rapidly move their things down to the ground floor.  Originally, I had laid our socks out to dry on the upper floor and of course forgot them in the rush. The next morning are socks were everywhere! The mice had tried to hid them behind the rafter logs and along the inside of the roof line.  Upon inspection, we felt pretty happy that very little was done to our precious socks, we ate, packed up and as I hoisted my pack onto my shoulders I noticed that my chest strap had been gnawed almost into two sections. Urg.. my own fault- I should have hung my bag in the air. It’s not the end of the world and like everything else out here - it can be fixed with duct tape. 
Stay tuned … big changes are coming!","Shenandoah Mountains

After we came out of the Shenandoahs we did a FLIP of our travels.  We shuttled to Charlottesville,VA and took an overnight Amtrak ride down to Gainesville, GA.   Our plan was to start at Springer Mountain and hike northward back to the Shenandoahs.  If you are wondering why, it’s in preparation for the Fall months. If we continued south as we were, by the time we got down to the Smoky Mountains, the 5,000-6,000 ft mountains could be icy.That trip sounds simple —- hike out, shuttle, train ride, shuttle, hike North - well it took us a lot longer than expected.We hiked out of the Shenandoahs on Friday - we were picked up by our shuttle and driven to our hostile in Waynesboro, VA very quickly. We showered, did laundry and got rides to run errands all on Friday.  Saturday, we took a 45 minute shuttle to Charlottesville, GA so we could catch the 8:30 pm overnight train. Unfortunately, our shuttle was at 10:00 am, so we walked, sat and relaxed at an outdoor Mall - all day.  After dinner we walked to the train station and finally got on our delayed train at 9:30 pm. This train ride was for 11 hours with 10 stops. I was able to nap on and off all night, it wasn’t terrible, but after sitting most of the day and night - I was ready for the woods. When we departed from the train at 7:30 am Sunday morning we found an empty train station. When I say empty- I also mean unmanned!  The sign at the station as we entered told us that the doors would automatically lock at 9:00 am and not reopen until 6:00 pm. So our thoughts of waiting for our next shuttle at the train station were dashed.  We found a Duncan Donuts within a mile, so we relocated there.  By now we were anxious to get our ride to Amicolola Falls and start hiking. Our cheerful shuttle driver picked us up at DD’s at 3:00 pm and we started the long drive to the State Park where we were to pick up our resupply box and some other purchases, then continue up the hill to the start of the trail. As we entered the park the skies opened and the rain began. We were still excited to start!  She dropped us at the lobby of the lodge and we hustled inside to get our things - only to be told that our food supply box had not arrived! With our minds spinning - shuttle waiting outside- rain pouring down - we had to quickly rethink our plan.  We had to stay put! We unloaded the shuttle, bought a room for the night and tried to trace our package. Turns out it was not going to arrive until late Monday. Meanwhile, the Sunday rain continued thru Monday and into Tuesday.  It is now Tuesday - we have been here 2 days with continuous rain, but the good news is we are waiting for our shuttle driver again, she’ll be here in 2 hours and then we will be back on the trail. Our plan is to sleep at the Springer Mtn tent site after our summit today.  Can’t wait to be back in the woods!","Waynesboro, VA

Jo-Ann Smith,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644600,"I don’t even want to write these words .. but for those of you who follow my wandering thoughts, I must be honest.My current situation is that I am off the Appalachian Trail - hopefully just until this Sunday.  We came down at Horses gap after our newly northern directed hike from Springer Mountain.  My ‘tweaky’ pain in my left knee was becoming more painful and progressively worse.  For 3 days our mileage dropped to 5 miles or less!  Grit finally insisted we stop making believe I was going to ‘walk it off’.  We called a shuttle and started to face the truth- without some treatment, I was going no where.  The first issue was to find a town that was large enough to have good medical services - that would take me, then we would need lodging until we figured out the next step.  We were near this wonderful retreat town called Dahlonega, GA and the process began.  Current diagnosis after exams and X-rays is Overuse of Left knee. The treatment is steroids, Tylenol 3 and rest for 5-7 days.  We found a great hikers bunk room in a boutique type mountainside lodge.  The place is called Barefoot Hills Hotel.  There are beautiful individual cabins and lovely places to stay on this mountainside and then there is our perfectly priced bunk room!  Needless to say we booked a week here.  We did have to rent a car from a nearby town because there is only one Uber, a couple taxis and the regular hiker shuttles… and those costs add up quickly.This seems to be a destination wedding capital - 9 weddings this past Saturday and a 3,000 person 6-Gap bike event started Sunday at 7:30!What’s next?  Not sure yet - hopefully by the end of the week there will be enough improvement that we can continue inching northward.  Of course we will reduce our mileage to fit my leg.  Neither of us can imagine going home now.  We both have never experienced such an adventure.  We were really humming along when this just came out of nowhere. So, that’s it… full disclosure.  I’m just hoping and praying this won’t be more then a needed rest.  I’ll keep you posted.~ JoMaMa ~","

Jo-Ann Smith,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644838,"I am pleased to say that Grit and I restarted on the AT yesterday morning. X-rays, meds, 7 days of total rest, kinesiology taping, two slack pack hikes of 10+ miles each and my knee was ready. 6 am Sunday morning we left our mountain resort to drive an hour south to return our rental car.  First blip of the day was the shuttle driver was an hour late! We finally, got back up to Neels Gap in Cleveland, GA for an 11:00 am departure. This last week we have seen some magnificent weather here in Georgia. Blue skies, clear days and perfect temperatures.  Our forecast for the first four days is rain, rain and more rain. We don’t care! To test out my knee, Friday and Saturday, I put only essentials in my pack, about 10 lbs with lunch and water and walked two sections of the trail.The first day there were 3 times I crossed dirt roads after mountain tops, where I could pull out if needed. The second day was major because it included a hike up and over Blood Mountain Shelter at 4442 ft. Then straight downhill to Neels Gap.  It was a great workout for my knee. Currently, my fully loaded pack with about 6 days of food and water, weighs about 32 lbs.  We headed out in a cloud mist, in our rain gear and lasted about 3 hours.  The rain was off and on throughout the hike but nothing horrible.  We went up and over 3 peaks - saw nothing and finally choose a sweet spot to set up camp on Wolf Laurel Top.  Harder rains were expected by 4pm and we wanted to be inside our tent. Today we  packed up in the rain and were able to hike 8 miles to Low Gap Shelter. The next few days we are planning to go shelter to shelter about 8 miles each day to bring my knee back up to speed. The woods have changed so much in our time away.  The ferns are turning yellow and brown and leaves of all colors are at our feet.  Once the rain moves out, we should be treated to some spectacular views.","Neels Gap

Jo-Ann Smith,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645169,"It’s been 10 days since my restart from my knee injury and like always a lot has transpired.  The first 5 days were tough, only doing 8-9 miles, with a full pack in the pouring rain, was not easy.  The knee hurt less than previously, but it still was painful to hike. Each afternoon, as soon as we got to our shelter, I would ice it down with stream water in my water bladder and I was still taking Tylenol X-Strength around the clock.  We finally came into the town of Hiawassee, GA to dry everything out, do laundry and resupply.
On Saturday 10/9 we reentered the woods at Dicks Creek. The sun was shining and the forecast looked great for about a week. We had some special moments - like hitting our 500 mile mark and finishing off the miles in Georgia!  Each day we are adding more miles and slowly my knee is beginning to hurt less. 
We have been in the Nantahala National Forrest area and the views (when they aren’t covered with clouds) are just magnificent.  The trees are starting to turn colors and leaves are dropping around us as we walk. The scenery at times just takes your breath away.  We’ve been atop a few mountain ‘balds’ now and up quite a few fire towers.  You really have to pull yourself away from these breaks or you will never move forward on the map. 
We are definitely moving closer to the Smoky Mountains each day, there is only about 40 miles to go. Our mileage is near 15 miles/day now and I’m beginning to pick up my speed again. It’s too dark in the morning to leave much before 7:30, so our days have been later than usual, sometimes we have to stealth tent because we can’t make it to a shelter area early enough.  We have met up with some wonderful people that have been so much fun to stay with in the evenings (Piglet, Casey, Casin and their sweet dog Lucy). We were very sorry to loose them today - as they all headed back to the ‘real’ world.

Jo-Ann Smith,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645346,"Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC) is another famous hot spot on the AT. Located on the banks of the Nantahala River it is now a large tourist destination.  While there, you can zip line, group raft the rapids, play in tiny trick kayaks in the churning water…shop at the large outdoor center or just relax and eat at a variety of waterside venues.  Needless to say, after being alone in the woods for so long, it’s very hard to spend time among so many tourists. As soon as our phones were charged and our hunger satisfied we started the long afternoon climb back into the wilderness.  The NOC’s elevation was 1700 ft, our next shelter was at 4300 ft. It was a tough afternoon, especially because I had eaten a delicious pint of Mint Chocolate Chip ice cream!  As I stated last time, we had recently said goodbye to one little ‘tramily’, well, at the Sassafras shelter we met a new friend named Dodger. Dodger lives nearby and was doing the last in a series of long shakedown hikes for his AT thru hike in 2022.  He had been dropped off at the NOC and made the same long climb up to the shelter.  Upon our arrival, he was already tucked in for the night (6:30pm) and we ate and fell to sleep immediately also. At breakfast the next morning it was evident the three of us had a lot in common, he also was newly retired and just fun to be around.One thing on the trail that is not realized until you are living it, is the logistics of resupply.  We have our previously planned out boxes shipped to us by our amazing neighbor, Kathy.  To do that, we have to plan ahead about two weeks estimating where we might be and where we might stay.  When we come out of the woods to take time off, we like to p/u our box, do our laundry and usually dry everything out (tent, sleeping bags and boots).  Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t.  Due to my healing knee, we found ourselves a day ahead of schedule with rain bearing down on us, prior to entering the Smokies. Our quandary was push ahead - stay out in the overnight drenching and continue to our hostel which was holding our box - or find a new hostel, stay dry and figure out the box situation later.  We chose to stay dry and it was an amazing adventure! We stayed in a ‘tiny’ house called ‘The Cabins in the Woods’, for the amazing price of $50 which included pick up and delivery! We continued hiking the next day and to our shock and relief the hostel holding our box,  delivered it to us at a road crossing - no charge! Now, with our dry supplies, our food and our newly purchased permits - we were ready to enter.

Jo-Ann Smith,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645386,"﻿The excitement of finally entering the Smoky Mountains has been a driving force for us since leaving the Shenandoahs. The promise of a shelter with a solar charging station and hot showers nearby was another big pull. The shelter is called the Fontana Dam Hilton.  It’s outdoors, but large and immaculate. So, after we set up in the nicest shelter so far, we hitched a ride to the tiny local resupply store.  I was concerned I needed some leggings for the high altitude and the cold nights.  Hmmm… only men’s XXL were available, but if I wanted to buy any Christmas trinkets, I would have been all set. So, we grabbed a couple meals for the evening and some drinks and shuttled back to the shelter. Then the magic began!
Our first real Trail Magic- compliments of Fresh Ground Leapfrog Cafe!! Fresh Ground is a guy who travels up and down the AT feeding thru hikers- feeding them like Kings/Queens!  He works out of his white van and sets up big 8 foot tables which he fills with food. He has folding camp chairs and tables or heavy coolers to sit upon. He has a strict bleaching/washing system for your hands. He’s animated and entertaining as he ‘fixes’ up your meal. We had bratwursts on rolls, salad, pickles, marinated cucumbers and thick hand cut, oil fried French fries. He cooks as he entertains.  All the fixings were there and hot and cold drinks.  I think there was about 8 of us. Then he takes a group pic and posts it on Instagram. Another rule - you sign the inside wall of his van with your trail name. As it got dark and he was packing everything up, he told us to come back to the parking lot at 7:00 am for breakfast!  In the pitch dark at 7 am a scraggly group of 8 hikers walked back down to the parking lot - all with head lights on …trusting there would be a guy in a van making breakfast….and he was! Blueberry pancakes, bacon, scrambled eggs, OJ, hot French pressed coffee and cocoa.  He had bins of fruit, packaged cake snacks, cookies and bags of snacks! When we all finished eating, he used the leftovers to make us sandwiches to go! Just amazing!","

Jo-Ann Smith,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645527,"Hiking through the Smoky Mountains was everything we had thought it would be, the delightful days - the new friendships - the changing colors - perfect!  Ahhh, but were we really prepared?  Probably not... once the temps started hitting the 30’s at night, the sleeping outside became less enjoyable. Wearing just about everything you have in your pack to bed, just doesn’t seem right.  Also, wearing that same everything, to hike the next morning -  seemed doubly wrong.  We did it, but we realized we were one layer of clothing short for the colder temperatures in the Smokies.  The sights during the days were breathtaking, looking across from mountaintop to mountaintop will never get old.  The Smokies were heavily populated with Fall hikers and SOBO Flip Floppers.  We saw more people on trail the last 8 days than we saw the whole previous time.   Each had a story and each was super friendly.  The fire towers and mountaintops never disappointed us, from Shuckstack tower, to Rocky Top, to Clingman’s Dome, through to Mt. Cammerer, what a great hike! We finished off this segment at the famous Standing Bear Farm.  Our friends from Asheville picked us up and we are flying home very soon.  We aren’t done at all - we are just taking a break, we have learned so much these last 80 days!  We are a stronger team now and we know what we have to do to be successful in our goal. Our tentative plans now, are to complete Connecticut and Massachusetts AT sections while we are home during this Fall/Winter season.  We will then return in March 2022 to complete the miles  between Rockfish Gap and Standing Bear Farm (I-40).  Then we will jump back up to The Delaware Water Gap and push north to Mount Katahdin.  Our plan is to summit by August 4th. completing this dream journey in the require 12 consecutive months.  Stay tuned….~ JoMaMa ~","

Jo-Ann Smith,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645853,"In case you are wondering, I thought I would update you on our Winter plans. Our first night at home was interesting.  I found that mice decided our quiet house would be a good place to store their winter nuts and seeds.. not just anywhere - under our pillows!  We had flown home during the day of the massive 1400 delayed/canceled AA flights.  So, all I wanted that evening was to heat up our cold house and go to bed.  My discovery changed all that. 
Once home we had many things that needed immediate attention, so it took about 10 days for us to plan the continuation of our hiking. We now have made 4 trips out and have almost completed CT, we have only 6 miles of northern Connecticut left.  The first day we traveled with two cars for 1 1/2 hours to spot a car at each end of the hike. Then we got  smarter.  Now, I drop Grit at the north end of our 12-15 mile day hike, I drive to the southern terminus- and hike north.  We meet somewhere in the middle for lunch- then he continues to the car and drives back to pick me up. That saves us time and gas $$$.
I have been pleasantly surprised by the varied terrain in CT. There are easy flat walks, rock scrambles and days of ups and downs.  Walking for a mile along side  the Housatonic River was such a treat. Then there was a day of streams, waterfalls and  beaver dams. The weather has been nippy, but pleasantly so and of course we’re all decked out in our blaze orange!  
Today, we traveled only one hour from our house.  We started near Limerock and ended in Salisbury at Under Mountain Rd.Now, we have a short segment left - but we will be hiking over both Lions head and Bear mountain and coming out at the top of Mt. Riga State Park - that adds s add bother 3 miles to our walk.  Hopefully, we will complete this next week.  Mid December, I will have my left knee re-evaluated at UCONN, it still is painful after hiking. I really hope to sort this out in the next few weeks.  
Our plan to continue and get back to North Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia,is in about 90 days.  The clock is ticking!","
