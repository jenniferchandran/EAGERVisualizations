Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630370,"Went up to the Catoctin mountain park on Sunday and my brother-in-law Bill dropped me off at the very north end of the blue trail.  I had my full pack which included food for 4 days and water.  The pack weighed out at 34 pounds.  Ouch!  I hiked 12 miles back to the Manor area campground where I set up camp.  It was a beautiful day and the hike was enjoyable.  Set up my NEMO tent and used my Jet boil stove to prepare dinner.  I spent the next hour or so unpacking the remainder of my pack and preparing the tent for nighttime.

Rain was in the forecast for Monday and it was already sprinkling in the early morning while I was having my coffee with breakfast.  I was all packed up and on the trail by 9am.  11 miles today in steady rain.  It was actually kind of pleasant out and peaceful.  A Monday and first day back to school for the local area kept the trail mostly empty.

The rain was heavy when I returned to camp.  I looked at the minute-cast for the local weather so I waited for about 15 minutes until the rain let up a bit.  But not much.  The tent was set up in under 10 minutes without too much rain getting in before I had it all set up.  Not to bad.  The miserable part was the cloths being soaking wet and finding a place to set everything including the backpack and rain jacket without getting everything else wet.  Cold dinner tonight.  Did not like having to spend the remainder of the day and night in the tent but the rain was heavy and allowed for few options.  Maybe I will be a fair-weather hiker! 

Overall, it was a good first test to see what I am getting myself into.  I will look over my list and see want I can eliminate from the pack.  One item I will remove will be the sleeping bag liner.  I will initially place it in my bounce box in case I need it down the trail.  My current base weight (without food/water) is 26 lbs.  I plan to go out again in a couple weeks on the AT.",,View Entry,"Sep 03, Thu",0
Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630725,"My friend Gary dropped me off by Pen Mar Park by the Maryland/PA border Monday morning.  I wanted to do one last shakedown before I start my trip.  My pack weight is still about the same.  While I removed the sleeping bag liner from last time I added rain pants and a wool hat.  I needed the wool hat overnight.  The lows dropped to the mid 40’s both nights.  I was comfortable sleeping in just shorts and a t-shirt inside my NEMO Forte sleeping bag but the wool cap helped keep me warm.  I thought I could place my gloves in the bounce box that I will mail down the trail to myself but I may just take them with me from the start.  Hard to open the bear vault in the morning with cold fingers!

The weather was beautiful for hiking and similar to what I should experience in early October.  I hiked 16 miles the first day and camped at Annapolis Rocks.  Once I set up the tent and laid out everything for the evening I walked down to the overlook and ate dinner.  In the morning I made my breakfast and coffee.  My bear vault doubles as my camp stool.  There was a spring close by to re-supply my water using my Sawyer water filter.  After packing up I was on my way by 9am.

I hiked 14 miles on day 2.  This was a mistake.  Blisters started to form.  I could feel “hot spots” on my feet at the end of day 1 but no visible blisters.  I should have treated these areas before I started on day 2.  I did not until I was about 5 miles out on day 2.  By then it was to late.  Camped at Crampton Gap Shelter and Gary picked me up in the morning.  The 2-night shakedown went well overall.  Just need to work on the blisters.

Lessons learned……

I need to start off with just 10-13 miles per day

Carry mole skin and apply as soon as I feel a “hot spot” on my foot

Look ahead via maps or Gut Hook App to recognize the water sources and ask fellow hikers if the water is actually flowing.  When I arrived at Crampton Gap Shelter the evening of day 2 the water source was dry.  If I was aware of this sooner I would have filled up prior to the site.  I had to hike another half mile to the Gathland park area to fill up with water and then back again to the campsite.  Did not help the blisters!",,View Entry,"Sep 18, Fri",0

Harpers Ferry, WV to Blackburn Trail Center
Day 1 of my hike happens to coincide with day 1 of retirement!  I have been talking about hiking the Appalachian Trail (AT) to my wife and daughter for at least 20 years.  I spent my whole adult life on the government fiscal calendar (October 1-September 30), so I thought I would try to complete the AT this fiscal year.  I am starting at Harpers Ferry, WV and heading southbound until I decide to stop.  Once I return home I will try to complete the southern half of Pennsylvania if the weather permits then continue in the spring.  I will be considered a ""flip-flop"" hiker since I am not starting from the Southern or Northern terminus.

My friend Ben dropped me off today by the bridge over the Shenandoah river.  Other than the climb out of Harpers Ferry to the ridge the hike was pretty easy and uneventful.  I Saw plenty of deer and a fox today.  I'm staying here outside the Blackburn Trail Center this evening that is maintained by the Potomac Appalachian Trail club (PATC) which I am also a member.  The PATC maintains the trails from Shenandoah National Park all the way up through Boiling Springs PA on the Appalachian Trail and also many of the side trails. I met Steve, a trail maintainer, and Moxie, the caretaker.  Both were very friendly and helpful. Moxie provided with me with my first ""trail magic"" (a.k.a. an act of kindness) this evening when she gave me a warm blueberry pastry dessert.

While the center is not open Moxie is allowing me to Cowboy camp this evening on the front porch of one of the small cabins. The front porch looks to be covered so I should be okay with just my mattress pad and sleeping bag. Expecting rain tonight","Harper's Ferry, WV

Started off about 8am.  Hit the area of the trail called the roller coaster after 3 miles. It is about 14 miles long so still some to do tomorrow.  It was fairly difficult.  Up’s and downs like a roller coaster and very rocky.  Camping in tent tonight at a campsite along the trail. No shelter here. A father and five year old daughter camping in the same small area.  It reminds me of when my daughter and I use to camp.

No rain expected over the next 2 days.  Planning about 13 miles tomorrow …. Similar to today.","Blackburn Trail Center

Finished the roller coaster after about 4 miles so I guess it's just back to regular “hills” now. I like Knoebel’s Grove amusement park roller coasters better.

The big difference between the roller coaster area and the area I’m covering now is that the roller coaster area was covered with rocks.  Perhaps they should have called it the “Rock and Roller coaster”. I'll be with you for the next two thousand miles!

Also there was a heck of a lot more people out hiking today. It took me half the day today to realize that it's a Saturday.  Only three days into retirement and already forgot what day of the week. I guess that's a good thing.  I will stay at the whiskey Hollow shelter this evening.","Campsite near Buzzard Hill

Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631194,"I was tent surfing most of the evening last night. I kept sliding to the bottom of my tent on my mattress and sleeping bag. I could not find level ground so I was on a slant. I went without the rain cover because it was such a beautiful evening. I could hear the coyotes howling again last evening … pretty much still a full moon.

Fifteen miles for me today, but overall not too difficult of terrain.  My legs are tired …. probably a combination of the last 4 days. The biggest challenge today was collecting water.  I had to scoop from some of the streams into my filter container. The water seems a little shaky, but I'm still standing.

I’m still monitoring a few blisters and hot spots on my feet.  I placed Mole skin and/or blister Band-Aids on, but they're off halfway through the day because my feet are sweating so much.  I will continue to work in that area.

I’m staying at the mountain cabin hostile the next two nights … Giving myself a little reward with a 0 day tomorrow.  I will not hike and will spend time re supplying. 

They call it a cabin but it's actually a beautiful old historic home.  Portions of it date from the late 1700 s.   I am in the basement in one of those areas.  Lisa and Scott, who own the site, couldn't be nicer.  At least 7 other hikers are staying here tonight. Some started from either Springer Mountain Georgia or from Katahdin, Maine … others, like me, somewhere in between.
I am dining at the Front Royal Brewery this evening.  It’s the first beer I had in 4 days. That is the longest I've gone without a drink since I was 15! Seriously!

I'm glad I did.  My legs have been really sore.  I think it was the combination of the last four days.  But, I should be good to go tomorrow morning to head into Shenandoah National Park.  Scott and Lisa here at the hostel could not be nicer. I would encourage anyone who comes to this area to stay at the hostel. For $35 I have my own private room and 1/2 bath. My laundry was all cleaned, breakfast each morning.

The trail is well maintained and easy under foot.  Little bit tired, but overall I'm feeling pretty good. Beautiful view from the overlooks.  I spent about an hour relaxing at one of them before I descended down to the campsite area.

I set up my tent in the Gravel Spring Hut area tonight. There are four guys staying in the hut itself and about three or four campsites are set up.  I enjoyed the company of the other hikers.

We had burgers French-fries and milkshakes.  Nice treat to have while out on the trail.  Filled up with water from an outside spigot.  He moved on before I did, as I decided to stay to let my feet breathe and take a longer break.

I may have taken too long of a break because the next 6 to 7 miles until I got to the Hut was very challenging.  I was wearing down on the last hill.  It might just be accumulation of a couple days in a row.

It was windy, but warm today.  Got into the low 70s, but the wind was gusting over 30 miles per hour.  Set up tent at the campsite, rather than using the hut.  Wind seems to be dying down.

Once I was preparing to leave I saw a couple having a picnic and I had to walk close by there to throw my trash away.  But I walked “really” close by.  We engaged in conversation and they offered me food.  Now let the record reflect that normally one would say “no thank you”, you don't have to do that.  But as a hiker, who is starting to get very hungry, I said yes before he finished offering me the food.  Before I knew it, I was sitting at the picnic table with them and eating a salami sandwich, their special oatmeal cookies with apricot, vegetable, chips , soda, water and apple pie!  …. also 2 apples.  I am beginning to get hiker hungry early afternoon. I am burning 4500 calories a day, but could only carry about 2,000 daily due to weight reasons.

The couple was from Raleigh Durham, and I am very grateful for their “Trail magic”.  I must admit I did do what is called ""Yogi-ing"" in in the hiking world.  Think Yogi Bear. It is where a hiker may be extra friendly in a parking lot trying to get a ride from someone into town or food if possible.   Anyway the couple made my day and I sincerely appreciated it.","Pass Mountain Hut

Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631395,"Checked out of Skyland Lodge in the morning and had a big breakfast before I got on the trail. 15.8 miles today planned.  Off to a bad start. The first hour was filled with frustration because there was a detour on the trail and it was poorly marked. It wasn't just me, because other hikers experienced  the same frustration.   Walked an extra 2 miles and got nowhere.  Once I finally got on the trail it was a fairly easy day.  Stopped and had lunch and a beer at Big Meadows Lodge.
The rain was supposed to start from the remnants of the storm early in the morning so I decided to use the shelter rather than set up my tent.  First time I slept in the shelter. The whole area was very crowded, due to the holiday weekend.  There were at least seven in the shelter and about 15 camping on the surrounding grounds.

 Met up with some interesting folks.  Three of the guys were nurses from Florida and they hike for a week each year.  They have been doing it for at least the past 12 years …. trying to eventually complete the trail Another guy had a month off and he was hiking Northbound from Catawba Virginia, trying to make it to Pine Grove Pennsylvania.  He too, is slowly completing the trail over a number of years.  Another guy with the trail name “Lightshow” was only nine miles away from finishing the trail.  If I was to stereotype, he would be the type of person that I expect to see out there.  He had a guitar with him and played and sang … pretty good.  He was going to stay there another night. I think he did not want it to end!  Some of the guys built a fire.  This was the first night I was at camp with a fire.  A great day.
Hit the 100 mile mark during this hike.

There were three of us. Amy was going northbound as a section hiker, and Perfect Timing was going southbound with me.  Perfect Timing started up at Maine so he has well over a thousand miles on me.  Needless to say, there was no way I could keep up with him, nor did I try.  However, by the end of the day we both ended up at the same shelter together and had dinner.

I kept it shorter today, after the long hike yesterday.   I was still pretty tired today with the last 3 miles, more or less, uphill without switchbacks. The other problem that I am running into, is a water shortage again.  The water from storm a week or two ago must have run off as the springs are running a bit low.  I don't have a water source reliable for maybe the next 10 miles or so. There was a river at the bottom of the hill before I came up. I stocked up with between 3 and 4 liters of water, so I was carrying all that extra weight.  It was not recommended necessarily to get the water from that river because all the locals use it as a swim and party area.  I went upstream a little bit to get the water where I felt more confident.  I will also not just filter the water, but also boil it.

Not much chance of seeing a lot of wildlife throughout the day now with so many noisy leaves underfoot.

I wanted to get in a few extra miles since Thursday will probably be a zero day due to the tropical storm coming through. I will probably shelter in place at the Laurel Creek Shelter.  I had about a 3-mile long hill to go up today.  Sometimes you feel relief when you make it to the top and think going across the ridge line will be easy, but in this case it was not.   I had to walk on rocks on a slanted slope since I was right along the ridge line. That slowed me down a bit as well.
I arrived at the shelter around 4:30pm.  Dilligaf was already here.  We were already asleep when Ohio and Upward arrived after 8pm. They hiked 27 miles and were soaking wet, since the storm had started around 5pm.   I was fortunate to make it to shelter right before the rain really started in earnest.   I plan to shelter in place here tomorrow and let the storm pass.
 Thought for today: I passed the Audie Murphy monument today.  It marked the site of a plane crash in 1971 where he died.  Audie Murphy was the most decorated U.S. soldier of World War II, and later became an actor.   Editor’s note: Star’s father and five of his brothers also served our country in World War II.  All came home safely .. which was an unheard of event.  How fortunate we were to have such a generation before us.","Remote campsite in Brush Mountain Wilderness

There were lots of down trees across the trail, which I expected.   I counted at least nineteen on the 13 mile hike today.

 Answer from Wikipedia: A majority of the rocks in Pennsylvania exposed at the surface are sedimentary and were deposited during the Paleozoic Era. Almost all of the metamorphic and igneous rocks are confined to the southeast portion of the state. ... The Pennsylvania terrain has also been affected by continental rifting during the Mesozoic era.

Back on October 1st my friend Ben dropped me off at Harper's Ferry to start the hike Southbound (SOBO).  Today Ben joined me for the first hike of spring leaving Harper's Ferry Northbound (NOBO).  It was a beautiful day for hiking.  Beautiful views from Jefferson Rock overlooking the Potomac and Shenandoah rivers.   The trail leads right through the historic town of Harper's Ferry and then over the Potomac River, along the C & O Canal.  From there you climb via the switchback trail up to Weaverton Cliffs.  The remaining miles are fairly easy along the ridgeline coming out at Gathland State Park where a memorial is dedicated to war correspondents.

 My Plan going forward is the following:
 Over the next couple weeks I will complete the remaining 30 miles in Maryland and the 40 miles of Southern Pennsylvania up to Pine Grove Furnace.  This will allow me to get my hiking legs back under me and I will have completed the AT trail from Damascus, VA to the Delaware Water Gap. 
 In mid-April I will head down to Springer Mountain, GA to complete the trail NOBO to Damascus, VA. 
 I will then ""leapfrog"" up to the Delaware water gap and continue NOBO to Katadin, Maine.  If everything goes well I should complete the AT late August or early September.","Harper's Ferry, WV

 Mount Garfield seemed to be the most difficult going both up and down.  Part of it however just might be the cumulative effect of the last two days. Garfield also had the best views, but again clouds were rolling in and out all day and it happened to be most clear when I was on top of Garfield.  While yesterday had over 7000 feet elevation gain over 19 miles, the elevation gain today was over 5000 feet over the 13 miles. The White Mountains are very difficult. There seems to be no flat land around here. You are either going very steep up over rocks, or very steep down over rocks. Some are so large that I just decided to slide down on my butt. On the way up I often have to put the walking sticks away and use all “fours”. The overall key is to just take your time.
Trebek and I stopped by the Galehead hut this afternoon and I had all you could eat stuffed shells.  This provided me the energy to finish the hike.  I said goodbye to Trebek, because he was continuing on while I am stopping at Guyot shelter. Over the last hour today it did start to storm.  I was soaking wet when I arrived at camp. Of course, nothing ever really gets dry, so I get to put on all the wet clothes in the morning.  Oh joy!","Liberty Spring Campsite

Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640055,"It was a pretty easy hike today. It was mostly in a lower lying area between Franconia Ridge and the Presidential range of the White Mountains.  While yesterday I was annoyed with the .8 mile hike off the trail (in the rain) to get to the Guyot shelter, I must admit it was the nicest shelter where I have stayed.  It was perched high up like a tree house, so the view was amazing.  The caretaker said it was the most popular in the area. I got an early start and stopped by Zealand Falls Hut around 8:30am. They fed me leftover pancakes and bacon, along with coffee and a muffin.  Once I arrived at route 302 (Crawford Notch) and was waiting for the shuttle to pick me up I realized I was not in the correct area for pickup.  I am spending the night at the AMC Highland Center. Another guy helped me get to the correct place which was the Wiley House parking area. They had a general store, so I had two hot dogs and a drink (why not!). Then I had over a pint of ice cream for dessert (why not!).  When I arrived at the lodge they had a special for thru-hikers that are also members of the mountain club …. which I happen to be ….  bread, soup, and a beer for six bucks (why not!). Another worker gave me a roast beef sandwich once he realized I was a thru-hiker (why not!).  Everyone has been so friendly and supportive around here. There was a buffet in the evening that was included with the stay (why not!). Can you say “hiker hunger”?
 

Note: Following the weather closely is critical, especially in sections like the White Mountains and Mt. Washington.","Guyot Shelter

The weather looks better for summiting Mt Washington tomorrow.   There is plenty of room for those that wanted to pay to stay in the Mizpah Hut this evening.  Others are staying close by at the campsite. Only a total of nine are staying in the hut. The Mizpah hut is the newest of all the huts, but was still built back in the 1960s.  I arrived early to beat the storm and I am glad I did because the weather was really nasty in the afternoon.  Most of us sat around and played board games and cards throughout the afternoon.  Dinner was served at 6pm and was great.","Crawford Notch (Rte 302)

The morning started off rainy and overcast. I hiked with Tolken early on. He is from Minnesota.  We were above tree line and out in the Alpine zone after about the first mile … beyond  Mt. Pierce.  The wind was gusty, but not as bad as I thought it would be. After about five miles in, a group of us stopped at Lake of the Clouds Hut. This provided an opportunity to warm up a bit, use the restroom, and have some snacks. Once we left, we were only about 1.5 miles away from summiting Mt. Washington.  We got pretty lucky.  It actually cleared up a bit and there was very little wind.  The wind normally averages around 30mph without adding in the gusts. Today it almost seemed calm. At the weather station on site it was not above 17mph in a while. Mt Washington is considered to have some of the worst weather in the US. Winds have been recorded at over 200mph. So it was extremely unusual for us today. The top of the mountain has become a big tourist attraction.  They have a road going to the top and also a Cog railway.
The remainder of the six miles after Mt Washington was all on rocks and vert slow going (see video). It could have been much worse however if the weather wasn't so pleasant.","Mizpah Hut

I fell three times, which I didn't think was too bad based on the conditions.  I hooked up with a south-bounder that was slack packing also. A couple friends of his friends that hiked the trail in 2015 joined him for this hike. They were all from New Hampshire and familiar with the mountains. It was tough keeping up at times, but it helped me to climb and descend the hills by watching their foot placement.  Eventually I somehow moved ahead of them and finished about fifteen minutes sooner.  It was a long 10.5 hours of hiking.  There was very little reason to stop, since there were no views. Also, it was only about 50 degrees so I got cold if I stopped more than a few minutes.

There were very limited views today.  The first six miles were difficult enough then came Mahoosuc notch. This is notoriously known as the most difficult mile on the trail. I was hiking with Denim Dan through this area and I was glad for the company.  It took us one hour and forty minutes to hike the 1 mile. It is just a giant boulder field and you have to climb over or under the boulders to make it to the other side. A few places you needed to remove your pack because you could not get through the boulder cracks with it on your back. It was very cool in the notch and if you looked down under the boulders you could still see snow and ice.
The day wasn't over yet. The last climb of the day was up Mahoosuc Arm. This is the steepest climb on the trail. I was still hiking with Denim Dan and we just took it really slow. In the end it did not seem any worse than many of the steep climbs through the White Mountains.  I’m spending the night in the shelter again due to rain expected.

Soon we were above the tree line exposed to the elements.  The wind was blowing so hard that it practically knocked me down.  I stayed close to the ground on my hands and feet, until I felt it was safe to go on as humans are meant to walk. Denim and I agreed that they were the strongest winds we had experienced along the trail.  They were even worse than in the White Mountains! It was a foggy and misty morning so once again we did not have a view. It was a steep descent down to Grafton Notch from Old Speck, and very slippery since the rocks were wet. Climbing up the next mountain early in the hike was surprisingly easy. I was laughing to myself that whoever developed this section of the southern Maine trail was going to get fired because it was not difficult enough.  That quickly changed. Back to straight up and rocky!  Soon I was at the summit of Baldpate West peak. I looked for Baldpate East peak. I am always surprised to see how far away the next mountain looks when in this case it was only a mile. It was mostly an exposed mile with the wind howling as I was climbing over rocks to get to the top of Baldpate East.  I was rewarded with a magnificent 360 degree view. It was pretty cold with the wind, so I couldn't stay too long.  Going down the other side was also steep and rocky. I went past a couple small waterfalls along the way.  Overall it was a pretty exhausting day.

This morning I climbed up Saddleback Mountain within the first mile of the day. Walking towards me on the trail was a moose!  It was my first actual siting. We were above tree line so we both stopped and stared at each other.  While I was getting my camera out he turn and ran back to the top of the mountain.  He posed at the top for a photo.  After I made it to the top and started towards Horn Mountain I saw him again and the same scenario took place.
