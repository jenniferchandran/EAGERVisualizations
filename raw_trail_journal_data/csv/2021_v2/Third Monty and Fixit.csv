Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631840,"OK, here we go again!  We are 3rd Monty and Fixit, and aiming for our Triple Crown at Mt. Katahdin.  (And maybe we'll also be the oldest COUPLE to thruhike the AT???  Fixit will be 81 and I (3rd Monty) will be 73.)  We tried for an AT thruhike in 2020, but got waylaid by C-19.  We are not personally scared of C-19 at all, but with news of one trail closure after another, and with us coming all the way from California, we did not want to take a chance on having to quit halfway through because things were shut down.  So we stayed home.
We thruhiked the PCT in 2005 and said, ""Wow, that was fun!  Let's do it again!""  So we did, in 2010.  Then we decided to aim for the CDT, despite its trail motto of ""Embrace the Brutality.""  In 2016, we did just that.  The CDT is often not a trail--it's more like a route, and map + compass don't work well in say Colorado, when you are cruising at 12,000 feet, in ""mashed potato snow"", surrounded by mountain peaks that all look the same.  We finally got so frustrated with all the time we were wasting trying to figure out where we were that we finally sighed and went for technology--a Garmin.  After that, no more wondering!  We made it to Canada after being snowed on a couple of times.
Fixit likes to do the John Muir Trail (JMT) every summer, and he does not mess around.  He does the whole thing in 8 days.  Most people take 14-21 days.  He did it again just this last summer (2020) in spite of the extra hassles created by the C-19 rules.  Only it took him 9 days.  He said, ""I got slowed down because the other hikers were treating me like some kind of rock star, when they found out I'm 80.""  The JMT is not a walk in the park--lots of 12,000 + foot passes, river crossings, etc.  It is gorgeous but challenging.  I would be happy to join Fixit and do the JMT with him, but not at the pace he does.  For me, 12 days would be more like it--not 8!
Doing the AT was not originally on the ""to do"" list.  We were in Massachusetts several years ago, visiting our daughter, who lives there, and decided to dayhike the AT.  The nearest trail section was to climb Mt. Greylock.  I'm afraid our opinion of the AT did not exactly rise much as a result.  We looked at the trail and said, ""What is this?  You call this a TRAIL?  It's all roots and rocks and green tunnel with no views, and it goes up a cute little hill they call a mountain."" We actually lucked out and met  some AT NOBOs and asked them, ""Is the AT all like THIS?""  They kind of shuffled their feet and stared at the ground and muttered, ""Yeah, kind of"" and finally one of them piped up with, ""Well, in Georgia when we started, we had views because the trees didn't have leaves yet.""  Fixit and I were NOT impressed.  After the glorious open spaces of the West and the 10,000 - 14,000 foot mountains and all that, we decided to pass on the AT.  
Until we got Triple Crown fever.  So...now we are putting together resupplies, making plans and all that goes into a thruhike.  And figuring we can do this because ""age & guile beats youth & strength.""  And in addition, I'm singing that old gospel hymn to myself, ""I'm climbing on the upward way, New heights I'm gaining every day, Still praying as I'm onward bound, 'Lord, plant my feet on higher ground'""  And I changed the chorus to go, ""Lord, lift me up, and help me stand, Up top upon that tableland, Katahdin's peak, to which I'm bound, Lord, plant my feet up on that ground!""",,View Entry,"Nov 15, Sun",0
Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631860,"Fixit and I live in the North Bay area of San Francisco Bay, in Sonoma County, and that means for the last 3 years, EVERY year we have been hit by wildfires that not only burn down houses but also close many hiking trails. Part of our regular weekly routine is to take one whole day and hike all day (that means a 7-8 hour total of actual hiking), often on steep terrain, with the goal of doing at least 18 and often 20 + miles.  But now....trying to find a 20 mile route has become increasingly difficult, as one trail after another is shut down by fires and fire damage.So this week, we got out our maps of Point Reyes National Seashore (one of our favorite hiking places!) and puzzled over how to put a hike together.  The entire midsection of the park is now off limits, due to a wildfire that was started by lightning back in August, and mostly left to burn ""because it's a wilderness area, and we can't interfere with nature"". (How's that for ""intelligent"" forest management??!!) The end result was a lot of fire zone area, leaving only the south end and north end open.  In the end, we pieced together a route in the south part of the park.  It was close to 20 miles, and we had to be done by 4:30 at the latest because sunset was at 4:55.  So that meant we had to hustle, after an 8:45 start.Point Reyes National Seashore is an absolutely gorgeous place to hike, with everything from thick, almost rainforest/jungle stuff to Douglas fir forest on steep hillsides, to open, wildflowered bluffs, and of course, the sea views that extend all the way out to the Farallones Islands, many miles offshore.  The route we had put together covered pretty much all of those.  If we had not been in such a hurry, trying to finish before dark, we could easily have stopped to enjoy it more.  A ranger we met years ago commented about the California coastal mountains in the autumn, ""Well, we may not have the fall FOLIAGE, but we do have the fall FUNGI.""  He was right....except the fall fungi don't happen till we get some good fall RAINS, and that has not happened yet.  Normally this time of year, as we hike through the Point Reyes forest, we see all kinds of amazing mushrooms and other fungi.  Not this time.  There were a few, but very few.  We hiking along saying, ""Well, just wait till it rains, and THEN we'll see!""The ocean views were spectacular, as always.  There is nothing like seeing the vastness of the Pacific as the swells roll in and crash in white foam & spray on the cliffs.  No fishing boats out today, though.  Sometimes we see as many as a dozen of them.The route we chose had only a few parts where we would meet up with other hikers.  Almost everybody we met did not bother with face masks.  We had ours hanging around our necks, just in case we met some of the fearful people who actually get off the trail and climb up into the bushes to get as far away as they can from anyone else they meet.  What a way to NOT live!  We personally have done lots of research and found that though C-19 certainly is nasty, and quite contagious, it is nothing to fear, because it is very CUREable.  The county of Taiwan with 25 million people has had only 7 deaths from C=19 so far, because they actually TREAT it and CURE it.  A number of American doctors, including some right here in our own Sonoma county, are using their methods to cure EVERY C=19 patient who comes to them.  But if you dare put any info on this up on say, Facebook, it is immediately taken down.  Shame on those censors who just want people to live in fear!Towards the end of the day, as we were in the last half hour of our hike, and heading down the mountain toward the horse stables at a place called Five Points, we met two horse riders.  Now, trail etiquette is that ""Everybody YEILDS to horses"", so we got off the trail, on the DOWNhill side (horses like to see us looking smaller, not taller) and started TALKING to the riders so the horses would know we are people and not scary predators of some sort.  But one of the horses balked, and it turned out that what we were watching was a trail riding LESSON.  The young lady on the balky horse was learning to ride, and the guy on the horse behind her was coaching her on what to do.  As soon as we saw what was happening, we did the proper thing, which is to ASK, ""What would you like us to do?""  Riders will always tell you what actions they would prefer you to take, if their horse is acting up.  So the riding instructor said, ""OK, just walk on by; take it easy.""  So we did.  And as we headed off, we heard the instructor tell the young gal, ""OK, give him a little kick with your heels....""   Hopefully all went well after that!We were pretty tired when we finished, because of pushing it all day (only one brief stop to eat some lunch) and doing a lot of big hill climbs and descents.  But it was so good to be back at Point Reyes!  This is the first time we've been able to go there since early spring, when the park was totally closed due to C-19, and then just as it was about to maybe reopen the trails, came lightning and fire.  So what a delight to be back!  We have missed this place!  And we joke about how maybe it's good practice for the AT, because we did lots of 1,000 plus ascents and descents today!",,View Entry,"Nov 19, Thu",0
Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631873,"When Fixit and I were getting ready to hike the PCT back in 2005, Fixit was 65 and I was 57.  it was the first time we'd ever tried anything longer than a 5-day backpack trip.  And we figured, ""Wow, we will have to do at least 20 miles a day to be able to make it to Canada before the snow flies!""  Back then, we thought 15 miles was a killer long day, and our conclusion was, ""We'd better work at doing lots of miles in a day!""  So we did.  But what we didn't factor in was actually that there is something way more important than lots of miles, if you are doing a 2,700 mile thruhike.
That ""something"" is CARRY WEIGHT.  
So in 2005, we did make it to Canada, but it was tough sledding for the first few hundred miles.  Our feet hurt.  Our knees hurt, Our shoulders hurt.  Sometimes the hurt was so bad we considered giving up.  But being very stubborn and very determined, we kept on going, and one by one figured out solutions to the hurts.  By the time we reached Canada, we looked like Holocaust survivors (meaning, superskinny and a bit haggard) BUT we still made it, and doing at least 25 miles a day had become normal.  And wow, had we learned a few things!
So in 2010, when we did the PCT again, we totally revised our training.  Fixit was now 70 and I was 62. Sure, we still did some miles (we now consider 20 miles to be a ""nice hiking day"")  But even more important, we began to carry weight, beginning in December with maybe 6 pounds, and gradually increasing it each week, till by the end of March we were at 20 pounds.  We'd then carry 20 pounds every week until we left for the trail at the end of April.  Our typical training schedule was Mondays = a 20 mile hike.   Wednesdays = a 5 mile hike         Friday = a 5-8 mile hike    We didn't do more, because we have very busy lives and that's all we had time for.  In between, on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, we did strength and core work (like pushups, weighlifting, etc.)
The result?  NO blisters.  NO foot pain.  NO knee pain.  NO shoulder pain.  On the second day of the hike, leaving the ADZPCTKO (Annual Day Zero PCT Kick Off) event (which was AWESOME; we loved it!) we were steadily passing much younger hikers limping and groaning already about how much their feet and shoulders hurt (and they were MARATHON runners, who thought their marathoning would make them aces at the PCT!!)  By less than 200 miles into the trail, there were people whose feet were a disaster zone.  It hurt just to SEE their feet when they took their shoes off to rest by the trail, as we breezed on by.  By the time we reached Oregon, we could do 30 miles a day.
In 2016, we tackled the CDT, which is one TOUGH trail!  Well, actually it's not always a trail.  A fair amount of the time it's more like a route, which may or may not have any indication of which way to go.  We figure we lost several days just ""being lost"".  But we had trained as before, and had NO foot, knee or shoulder problems.  Fixit was now 76 and I was 68.  We said, ""Geezer power!!""
But besides the physical training for a long hike, there is the MENTAL side.  Let's put it this way--it often takes sheer dogged determination to keep on going through whatever happens.  When we are doing training hikes, we actually WELCOME bad weather (rain, cold etc) because we know we will have to deal with a lot of that on the trail, and it's good to practice handling those circumstances.  Fixit is very fearless, and he often just plows right on through tough stuff, while I trail behind trying to be more careful.  I'm kind of a ""trail klutz"", and have been saved from probably a zillion faceplants by my trek poles.  So when I see ruff 'n tuff trail ahead, I kind of take a deep breath and go for it the best I can, while Fixit bombs on through and waits for me on the other side.  On the High Sierra PCT in 2010, it was a big snow year, and we had to deal with roaring whitewater river crossings (no bridge) and steep snow-covered passes where a fall would mean serious injury or worse.  Again, Fixit is not bothered by such things, but I did my best, and always got through eventually.  How to do this if you are like me?  It was two things:  just plain ol' ""I am NOT quitting!"" plus a lot of ""praying my way through"".  Fixit and I are both Christians, so for me, talking to God about everything I'm doing is normal.  In a whitewater crossing, where you can only move one thing at a time (1 foot, 1 trek pole, 1 foot, 1 trek pole) against a roaring current that is trying to knock you over,  I'm talking to God the whole time, something along the lines of, ""OK, Lord, it's me again.  I know You love me.  I know You're with me.  I know You're helping me.  But right now I'm just holding Your hand and asking, 'Please help me with this next move.....""  
Right now, it's the end of November, and we've started training already for the AT.  It sounds like one TOUGH trail!  And the little bit we saw of it on Mt. Greylock has made me realize that I don't think we will be able to do 25-30 mile days like we did on the PCT in 2010.  That's OK.  We'll just keep at it as best we can.  The only bummer right now is that it sounds like it rains a lot on the AT, and here in California, we are (at least so far) in a drought year, with hardly any rain.  The weather report prospects for being able to practice rainy hiking are not very good--it's sun, sun, sun.  So we are praying for RAIN!  The garden needs it, and the TRAILS need it, and WE need it so we can ""train with rain""!
Conclusion: if you're reading this, and contemplating a long hike, I would say: TRAIN REGULARLY, AND TRAIN WITH WEIGHT!  (And practice hiking when the weather is bad!)",,View Entry,"Nov 22, Sun",0
Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631885,"Well, looks to us like the AT is mostly up on ridges, and today we did exactly that--the Bolinas Ridge Trail, with its glorious views of Tomales Bay far below, and the mountains all around, like Black Mountain, Mt. Barnabe,  Mt. Vision, Mt. Wittenberg and others.  The trail first goes through what I call ""The Sound of Music"" hills and then into a beautfui redwood forest.
Fixit had some stuff to do before we could leave, so we didn't get to start till 9:00, which is kinda late.  Oh well.  Fog lingered around us as we put on our packs (I'm at 10 lb right now), then squeezed through (me) and climbed over (Fixit) the ""cattle guard"" at the start of the trail.  The grass was still all brown BUT due to rain a few days ago, a little bit of green grass was just starting to show, if you got down close and looked at it.  I said to Fixit, ""I bet by the time we come back at 4:00, we'll be seeing a faint green haze on the ground instead of just brown.""
The Black Angus cows & calves were hanging out at the top of the first hill, waiting for the rancher to come and bring them something to eat, because the pastures are so poor right now.  Bummer--by now things are usually WAY better than this.  The trail is sometimes a farm road and sometimes a trail, as it winds and twists its way higher and higher, with ever more awesome views. There are a couple of cow gates to get through, which gives Fixit and I the chance to laugh and say, ""Well, good to have a GATE after all that crawling under barbed wire that we had to do on the CDT!""
 Eventually the trail levels out at the top of the ridge, and enters a ""deep dark redwood forest"" with sword ferns and huckleberry bushes and bracken on the forest floor.  The sun was so low that the moss on the trees was ""backlit"" and looked like it was glowing.  Because of the fog, the redwoods were still dripping onto the trail, and the light was mysterious and beautiful.  
Finding a sun patch to eat lunch was a bit of a challenge, but we found one, and after enjoying our trail lunch, it was turnaround time--back to the car.  Going back is where we really get VIEWS, for miles and miles, as we are heading downhill.  The only discomfort was a very cold and strong wind that forced us back into our jackets and mittens.  As we were heading along, I was especially looking at Black Mountain and thinking how much it looks like all the pictures I've seen of Katahdin...only on a much smaller scale.
And sure enough, the morning's brown grass now had a faint green haze of grass blades!
We are looking forward to April, and the AT!",,View Entry,"Nov 24, Tue",0
Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631893,"One of the things that Fixit and I do every week is VOLUNTEER at the local Salvation Army warehouse and church.  I help with the process of giving out food to needy families, and Fixit helps deliver food to the elderly, the disabled, and those who for one reason or another (covid-19 is one of those reasons) do not go out of their house.  And yesterday, on Thanksgiving Day, we weren't home cooking turkey--we were at the food warehouse helping people.  It was a great way to spend Thanksgiving!  And when we finally did get home, there was still time for turkey.
Thanks to the covid-19 rules, there are a LOT of people who are really hurting, and so many people who have lost their jobs.  They come to the Salvation Army for help, and they find it!
Starting now, you may be able to spot a Salvation Army Christmas bellringer standing by the iconic red kettle, collecting donations for the LOCAL Salvation Army to use.  Since I work with our local Salvation Army, I know how dedicated and honorable and caring the Army is, and I know that any $$ which go into that red kettle will be put to good use.  I was ringing a bell last December in front of a large local DIY/hardware store, and a guy came up, put a large donation in the kettle and then proceeded to tell me how ""I'm an atheist, but I looked into all the charities and I decided that the Salvation Army is the best one...I don't believe in God, but I do want to help.""  So I asked, ""Why is it that you don't believe in God?  What led you to think that?"" and we had a conversation for awhile where I discovered (as is so often the case) that he had been deeply hurt by someone who professed to have faith, plus he was asking the very reasonable question, ""If there really is a powerful and loving God, WHY is there so much hurt and suffering in the world?  Wouldn't such a God DO something about it?""  There are very good answers to that question; I was able to share some with him, but the hurt was still in charge of his heart, and not his reasoning ability, and he went away still hurting and sad.  I do still pray for him.
On long trails like the AT, the PCT and the CDT, we hikers are blessed to have TRAIL ANGELS (not the Salvation Army) who do so much to help us. One of those trail angels is Joe Anderson on the PCT.  In 2010, we were hanging out at his place with a bunch of other PCT hikers, and Joe, who is to put it mildly, a character, was telling us how he got involved in helping hikers.  At one point he said, ""Lissen up you guys!  I've been hearing hiker trail tales for LONG time, and I can tell you something--there is no such thing as trail MAGIC.  You can call it that if you want to, but come on!   Give credit where credit is due.  There really is a God and He really does care about you.  HE is the one providing the trail magic.  Stop playing the 'I'm an atheist' game, and give God the credit for helping you.""  Fixit and I cheered!  
So the way I see it, at the Salvation Army, we are able to provide ""trail magic"" from God to a LOT of people who right now are on a really tough and discouraging trail.
I encourage everyone to do the same! ",,View Entry,"Nov 27, Fri",0
Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631907,"OK, here's what Fixit and I have learned about feet after almost 12,000 miles of thruhiking:  KEEP YOUR FEET HAPPY!
How to do that?  Well, here's what we have figured out....
1) Wear TRAIL RUNNING SHOES, in a size at least 1 size larger than you would usually wear, and actually 1 1/2 sizes larger is even better.  Don't wear hiking boots.  They are way too heavy and just drag you down.  You have to take them off before you can ford a river or creek.  Don't wear street running shoes.  They quickly wear out on the rocks in the trail and they don't protect your feet.  With trail runners, when we come to a creek crossing (there are LOTS of these on the PCT in the High Sierra early season), you just plunge right in shoes and all.  The shoes (and socks) protect you from the icy water and the underwater rocks, and they dry just fine as you keep hiking along.  And if your shoes got all messed up and muddy on the trail, a creek ford cleans them off, no problem.   Our favorite thruhiking shoes are La Sportiva UltraRaptors, and I repeat-- the larger shoe size is ESSENTIAL.  Your feet WILL swell on a long hike, and you WILL get blisters, if your shoes are your regular size.  We've seen hikers with ghastly blisters.  Don't let that be you!
2) You might need orthotics to help support your feet properly.  If you have any foot problems, you definitely should be using orthotics.  Work with a SPORTS podiatrist who is used to working with athletes--not a regular podiatrist who just does little old ladies.  I (3rd Monty) had a tough time with my feet doing the PCT in 2005, and finished the trail by taking ""Vitamin I"" (ibuprofen) to keep me going.  Not good!  I found a good sports podiatrist who made custom orthotics for me and on the PCT 2010 and CDT 2016, I had no foot problems at all.
3) Everybody has their favorite socks.  We have found that DOUBLE-layering really helps with blister prevention and foot comfort.  Fixit and I never ever get blisters.  I like to use Wrightsocks as my ""inner"" sock (they are very thin AND are double-layered) and then I use Thorlo Walking socks, crew length, as my ""outer"" socks.  Thorlos are very, very comfortable and make my feet happy.  Fixit likes Wrightsocks combined with Point6 socks.  He doesn't go any higher than ankle length.  I like crew length because it helps my legs stay warmer.  For the AT, we are having  our outer socks treated with permethrin to help discourage ticks.
4) Gaiters--well, when you don't wear boots, you have to do SOMETHING to keep pebbles and grit out of your shoes.  So we wear lightweight gaiters.  Fixit and I both really like our old OutdoorResearch gaiters that have an awful lot of miles on them but keep going fine.  Sadly, you cannot get gaiters like them anymore.  We tried DirtyGirl, but were disappointed, and went back to our good ol' ""OR's"".  We have had them treated with permethrin for the AT.  
5) Train with WEIGHT.  I mentioned this on a previous post--one of the major reasons for training with gradually increasing weight is to toughen up your feet.  Our goal is that by the time we start a thruhike, the bottoms of our feet especially are really tough!
6) Strategic shoelacing.   HOW you lace up your shoes can really make a difference in how comfortable your feet are.  For example, in the deserts of the southern PCT and CDT, we did what's called ""desert lacing"".  You make your shoelaces as LOOSE as possible down by your toes, to give maxium ""play"" in the toe area.  Then tie a KNOT to isolate that part of the lacing, and lace up the rest more tightly.  You can do this type of lacing anytime you find your feet swelling because of heat, and it really does help.  
7) Take your shoes off when you take a longer break, and put them in the sun to dry out as much as possible.  Hang your socks up to dry, too.  Air your feet--this makes them happier!  We have a pair of ""sandals"" made from the cheap insoles of retired hiking shoes, plus a couple of pieces of elastic.  Fixit and I share them in case we need to walk a little bit during a break, or if one of us needs to get up in the night.
8) Wash your socks every day!  Fixit carries 2 sets of socks--one to wear and one to wash.  I like to have 3 sets--one to wear, one to wash, and one to dry, because I kinda like having a DRY pair to put on in the morning (even if it doesn't STAY dry long!).  We just rinse socks out once a day in a creek and then pin them to our packs to start drying.  When we are in town, THEN we give them a thorough wash with soap.  (We NEVER carry or use any soap on the trail).
9.  We DON'T DO ""camp shoes"".  I guess if we were slogging all day in boots, and then spent a couple of hours at the end of the day setting up a camp, making dinner, doing dishes and organizing water, then yeah, I see why people do camp shoes.  That's not how we operate.  We NEVER EVER eat where we camp, and at the end of our hiking day, we simply look for a usable flat place, set up our tarp or tent, and go to bed.  That's it. We take care of our water needs during the day (we use Aqua Mira if the water looks iffy) and we only cook at NOON.  We don't want bears visiting our camp.  Cooking dinner within a couple of MILES of where you camp is like inviting every bear in the territory to come join you. ",,View Entry,"Nov 29, Sun",0
Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631947,"Today I went to the AT ""Register Your Hike"" page and got all signed up to start on April 23 (that's the earliest we can possibly start, because we have a commitment that lasts till the evening of April 21!  I was amazed to see how many people had signed up to start in March.  On the PCT and the CDT, you'd be crazy to start so early, because you'd hit impossible trail conditions in the High Sierras (PCT) or the San Juan's (CDT).  The PCT in particular, is best started in the first week of May, so that when you reach the High Sierras, the snow has melted down enough that you can get through without risking your life.  :)Fixit and I are now in ""serious training mode"" every time we go for a walk, even if it is just around the neighborhood.  There is a small local airport not far from our house, so we often go out there and hike the paths around it.  People notice that we are carrying packs and using trek poles, and wonder ""What's up?"" so we tell them about how we are toughening up for the thruhike ahead.On Monday, we did one of our all-day hikes, the one we have named ""The Picnic Table Hike.""  We figured out this route when the covid situation was JUST AWFUL here in Sonoma County last April.  The county health people shut down every trailhead they knew about, but since we have been hiking the trails in those coastal mountains for a long time, we knew how to ""sneak in"" from traiheads that only locals know about.So covid or no covid, we were still able to access our favorite trails, only we had to start in a very obscure  location.  Fixit figured out a very strenuous and very beautiful route that takes us up over a high ridge, then waaaaay down, past a reservoir, across its dam, then up a fire road called the ""Shafter Trail"" and onto Bolinas Ridge.  We then turn right, and head for.....THE PICNIC TABLE!  It really is a table, set on top of a knoll, with a magnificent view of the whole Tomales Bay and the mountains all around.  We get there at noon, and have a great time hanging out and eating lunch. This time, Fixit even decided to climb the rock formation next to the table--photo op!!  He says he figures we will have to climb a bunch of rocks on the AT, so might as well get started.The return hike this Monday had beautiful late afternoon light on the fall foliage (OK, not equal to New England, but still really pretty) and the diamond sparkles on the water at the reservoir looked like someone tossed sequins all over the place. When we got home, whew, we were tired--the Picnic Table Hike is really tough--lots of BIG ups and downs, and steep, with some rooty/rocky stuff that we figure is good practice for the AT.  A good day!I'll finish with an item from my favorite ""laugh list"" I got from the Section Hikers backpacking blog.  It goes like this:You know you're a hiker when..... finding an old Slim Jim in a hiker box is AMAZING!",,View Entry,"Dec 05, Sat",0
Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631954,"When Fixit and I decided back in 2004 that we were going to hike the PCT, we started researching like crazy, and it didn't take long before we discovered Ray Jardine and the ""Ray Way"" of lightweight backpacking.  We were inspired!  We totally rethought our gear and our whole approach.I followed Ray J.'s instructions and SEWED our packs--one for me, one for Fixit.  And that's when we discovered something.  Ray J. must have had shoulders of iron.  His pack had NO waist belt and NO stays.  The entire weight hangs directly from your shoulders.  Owwwwwww, at least for me.  I wondered how Ray's wife Jenny could handle it.  Ray J. says that if you keep your pack weight low, like it should be, the weight will not be enough to bother you.  Well, it didn't work that way. at least for me.  Even though my ""base weight"" was only around 12-13 pounds, once you add in food and water, the weight climbs exponentially.  And so does the shoulder soreness.So I took my old backpack FRAME (it was a small frame, and not a bit fancy and not heavy) and I attached my Ray J. pack to that little frame.  I added the original waist belt from the pack as well.  Voila!  Now I was quite comfortable!  Fixit asked me to do the same for him, so we took another old backpack frame and attached his Ray J. pack to it.We used those packs (made of silnylon, by the way) for TWO entire PCT thruhikes.  They were pretty trashed by the time we reached Canada for the second time.  (Though I still use mine for training hikes!)But by now, there were a lot of very interesting lightweight packs available, and we looked long and hard at Gossamer Gear and at ZPacks.  We had decided for sure we wanted a waist belt, and for sure some sort of frame or at least stays.  Fixit tried Gossamer Gear, using his closed cell foam pad as ""stiffener"", but he was not entirely happy with it.In the end, we went with ZPacks, because they actually do have a VERY lightweight FRAME.  Back in 2015, when we got our packs from them, you could order some custom features, and that's what we did.  We asked for the packs to be ""thicker"" so they could accommodate a horizontally loaded bear can.  I asked for NO pockets of any kind on the outside of the pack, because I planned to retrofit the pack with Ray J. style net pockets, which I really liked. I also added a ""Y-strap"" on top.  Fixit's pack just had standard outside pockets.  Both packs were made of cuben fabric.We hiked the entire CDT quite happily with our ZPacks.  Fixit is kinda rough on his stuff, so his pack began showing some wear 'n tear before mine did.  Since we did that CDT thruhike, he has taken his ZPack on several JMT thruhikes, while mine has been used for more modest endeavors like the Tahoe Rim Trail and other outings.  This summer, the cuben fiber of Fixit's pack just plain SHREDDED.  It was done.  I could not patch or repair it anymore.  So he ordered a new ZPack.  No more customizing at ZPacks, oh well--that means any bear can will have to go vertically or be lashed on top.  And this time the fabric is not cuben--it's polyester.  Hopefully the poly will last longer than the cuben.  It should get a good workout on the AT!I'm doing the AT with my tried 'n true older ZPack, with my retrofitted net pockets.  It was a lot of tricky work to add those pockets AFTER the pack was made, but it was so worth it!   There is one BIG net pocket on the back side of the pack.  In there I put my mosquito headnet, mosquito ""gloves"", my clean socks, and the bag containing our cups & spoons. I pin newly washed socks to this large net pocket to dry as I hike along. I also use it to stash stuff in that I think I might need to get at quickly in case of weather.  Then one side of the pack has the TALL net pocket that is the same height as the pack frame.  There I carry the groundcloth, a water bottle, the map and some Snickers!  The other side of the pack has TWO net pockets.  In the top one goes the cathole trowel and my leave-no-trace cathole ""kit"" and a very small backpacker towel.  The lower pocket has two bags in it--the first aid bag and the ""emergency"" bag.   I like carrying all these things where I can get at them easily.  I've watched hikers struggling to find things that got buried in their packs.  I hate having that happen, so that's why all the net pockets.Fixit's outside pack pockets work like this: The main back net pocket is for wet stuff (like the tent if it has been raining or very dewy at night) and wet socks and other wet stuff.  He also puts the bear rope bag in the bottom so he can get at it first thing when we stop to camp. One side pocket gets a water bottle; the other side pocket has the fuel bottle.  The cell phone (in a waterproof container) is inside one of the side pockets also, which is tied to the pocket to avoid losing the phone if it should fall out.  He also has a little pocket on one shoulder strap for his camera.I'm not sure what Ray J. would think of our new setup???  But he was not 75-80 years old when he did his big thruhikes with his ""shoulders only"" backpack.  Maybe now he would like a bit of a frame!You know you're a hiker when....you get annoyed because REI doesn't have scales in the store so you can compare gear by weight",,View Entry,"Dec 06, Sun",0
Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631978,"A couple of days ago, we went on one of our favorite hikes for practicing ""rough trail with lots of rocks""--Annadel State Park, carrying our training packs (my training weight is now at 12 lb)  Since the amount of daylight available is quite a bit shortened up, we went there because we could still do an 8 hour hike, finish at sundown, and not have to worry about running into a deer in the dark on the way home (that has happened to us, and is an experience we do NOT want to repeat!).
We leave our car at Howarth Park in Santa Rosa, and then follow various trails after that.  Besides all the rocks (the entire area is rather volcanic, so many of the rocks are pumice-y) the other challenge is the BIKERS.  The whole time we are hiking in this area, we have to keep one ear cocked behind us for the sound of a bike tearing down the hill at us, and one eye cocked up ahead to watch for bikes coming toward us.  Some of the trails are fire roads with plenty of room, but some are regular trails, where somebody has to yeild.  TECHNICALLY, the bikers are supposed to yeild to hikers, but in actual practice, hey, it is a LOT easier for us hikers to sidestep off the trail and let a bike go hurtling by, than it is for a biker to stop while we squeeze by him on the narrow trail.  So we just do a quick hop off the trail and let the bikes go by.
Some bikers are very polite--they ring their bell or give a verbal ""Passing on your left"" call.  Others---argh.  Since there are so many rocks, we are often stepping this way and that way to avoid some of them, which means we don't always travel a straight line.  That's why we really try hard to be aware of bikes coming at us from behind.
There were a LOT of bikes on trail, because it was actually a beautifully warm, sunny day and everybody was out taking advantage of the weather.
But bikes aside, the hiking at Annadel Park is classic California oak woodlands combined with Douglas fir/redwood forest.  Part of the time we are walking over grassy hillsides sprinkled with impressive oak trees of all kinds.  Some keep their leaves all year, and others shed theirs--I really admire the amazing embroidery of oak tree branches covered with lichens and moss.  There are some beautiful big vistas of wide meadows, of the reservoir lake, and the city of Santa Rosa, far below.  On the horizon to the north, it's Mt. St. Helena, which once was an active volcano, and still looks pretty impressive, To the south it's Sonoma Mountain (Jack London, the author, used to live on the east side of that mountain) and in the VERY far distance, the San Francisco Bay.
Our goal is always the Ledson Marsh, which has a picnic table (yeah, we do like to eat at a table, if there is one!) with a great view of the Marsh and beyond that is Hood Mountain, another impressive local peak. Because of the drought, the Marsh is more mud now than water, and the interesting water birds we often get to see were not there.
The sun was setting as we got back to the car, and that gave us a good 8 hour hike, and good practice for ROCKY trail.  Hopefully on the AT, we will only have to deal with ROCKS, not the BIKERS!

Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631981,"When it comes to ""shelter"" on the trail, Fixit and I are used to 1) Our personal favorite--COWBOY camping  (no tarp, no tent, just roll out the sleeping bags and crawl in and watch stars!)  2) Second favorite:  TARP   3) Last choice: TENT.
On the PCT, we mostly ""cowboyed"" as often as possible, but if we had any concerns about possible weather incoming OR if it was a really cold night, we'd put up our tarp.  WE LOVE THE TARP!  For rain, snow, whatever, it's ideal.  On the PCT in Washington, where it rains a lot, at the end of the day, we'd get off the trail, look for a campsite (more on that in a minute), set up the tarp and get under it and voila!  We were out of the rain and could leisurely pick the ground clear of sticks, pine cones, etc, lay out the ground cloth, roll out the sleeping bags, etc, all without getting a bit wet.  And NO condensation buildup, either!  In the rain, a tarp is way drier than a tent.  The ONLY time a tarp does not work is when there are mosquitoes.  For that we had a separate net tent that would hang under the tarp OR could be set up all by itself (like High Sierra PCT in June/July--yikes, the mossies come out in clouds!!)
But for the CDT, we heard ""tick rumors"".  We have to deal with ticks a lot where we live (May to July, they can be pretty annoying, with May the worst).  The tarp does not work in tick country.  So we sighed and started looking at tents.  We ended up with the ZPacks Duplex, which worked OK (though in rain, the condensation INSIDE was kinda frustrating.  Fortunately, on the CDT, it didn't rain very much, and if we didn't cowboy, we used the tent.  The CDT elevations are often pretty high (like most of Colorado, you're at 12,000 feet) so the nights can be cold, and we would put up the tent, but as ""wide open"" as possible, to minimize condensation.  After awhile, we actually got a bit fond of the tent, though we still would have preferred the tarp.
Now the AT....wow, have we heard ""tick stories"".  And the Appalachians are ground zero for Lyme disease.  So we are going to bring our tent with us.  We hear it rains a lot on the AT, so we'd MUCH rather be able to use the tarp, but oh well.  We've had enough personal run-ins with ticks that we don't want to wake up in the morning and have to start the day by pulling off ticks.  No fun!  So the tent it will be.
As far as AT shelters are concerned, it's always been our policy to camp as FAR AWAY as we can from other people, because other people have the annoying habit of COOKING in the evening.  I've mentioned before that we never ever cook at or near our campsite.  We cook at noon, and eat a cold supper, then walk at least another hour before setting up camp.  So the likelihood of us camping at an AT shelter is pretty minimal.  (We might stop to EAT at a shelter to enjoy sitting at a table, though!)
We never plan ahead as to where we will camp, unless it looks like the terrain is going to be really rough.  Instead, at around a little before 7:00, as we are hiking along, we start looking for campsite possibilities.  What do we look for as a good place to set up our cowboy camp or tarp or tent?  Well, obviously we try to get well off the trail if we can (sometimes the terrain makes that impossible).  And we look for a flat place, preferably under trees.  (Under trees you are more protected from both heat and cold).  We ""preen"" the ground of little rocks, sticks and pine cones, then lay out the ground cloth.  If we are cowboying, we roll out the sleeping bags.  If it's the tarp or tent, we set them up, wash off our feet if they are dirty from the trail, put on our silk long johns we use for sleeping clothes, and go to bed.  At that point, Fixit wil read a bit from the Bible and then just plain ol' crash (Good night, Fixit!) while I write journal entries and study the maps and ""water situation"" for the next day.  I like to have a heads up on that stuff.  Fixit is more of an adventurer--he likes to just ""see what happens"", but I prefer to have at least SOME kind of plan!

Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632007,"Hearing lots of reports of HUGE waves coming in out at the coast, we decided that our Monday training hike would be to go out and SEE them!  It was a combo of what they call a ""King Tide"" plus high tide, and it sounded pretty impressive.So this Monday (Dec. 14) found us at the Five Brooks trailhead in Point Reyes National Seashore.  We walked by the old logging pond (not too many ducks there today) and then began the miles of climbing up to ""Fir Top"", which is one of the higher mountains at Point Reyes.  The trail (actually a fire road/access road) winds and switchbacks all over the place.  Many of the leaves have fallen now, and the bracken is all yellow and brown. Very pretty! It's not a tough climb, because it is so gradual.At the top, we found things still kinda wet from the rain a few days ago (still no sign of mushrooms sprouting, though) and we began the long descent to Wildcat Camp out at the coast.  My pack is still at 12 lb (going up to 13 next week) and I was doing a ""test run"" on some new shoes I will be wearing on the AT.  So far, I have not had a problem with La Sportivas, but I like to be careful.  They don't have to be ""broken in"", but I want to be sure they feel really good.  The new shoes didn't look new for long, with the muddy trail!Well before we reached Wildcat Camp, we could hear the roar of the surf.  Wow!  And when we finally rounded enough turns and could actually SEE the beach, it really truly was impressive!  Huge swells were lined up in perfectly parallel lines, way out into the ocean, and there were double rows of huge breakers.  The noise was pretty intense.  Nobody was camped at Wildcat Camp, and when we walked the trail down to the beach, we found we were blocked by a large ""pond"" created by the high tide a little while before.  There was ""flotsam & jetsam"" all the way up onto the trail, instead of just out on the beach.  On a normal surf day, we wouldn't have been blocked by the temporary pond, and we could have walked down to where Alamere Falls cascades onto the beach and into the sea.  We didn't even consider trying to do that!  Not with the size of those waves!  So we walked back and then climbed up onto the bluff for a look up and down the coast.  Beautiful!  It always is (unless it's so foggy we can't see anything!)  We ate lunch at one of the campsites before heading back onto the BIG up and down back to the trailhead.  The new shoes did great, and will definitely be used on the AT!  On the way back, we met a giant mowing machine that the rangers use to mow the sides of the trails out at Point Reyes.  If they didn't mow regularly, the trails would all end up totally overgrown with grass, stinging nettle, poison oak and blackberries.  The machine wasn't mowing, just traveling along, and it was quite a sight.  The mower part is huge.  It takes 2 guys to run this thing--one to just drive, and the other to control the mower (which is on an adjustable arm).  We are grateful to them--I have learned to bring RAIN PANTS out to Point Reyes, in case we do have to go through a bunch of overgrown trail.  Stinging nettles are everywhere, and it is NO fun hiking with your legs burning from running into nettles.  Rain gear protects just fine.You know you're a hiker when...drinking out of a stream seems normal!",,View Entry,"Dec 16, Wed",0
Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632046,"One of the best parts of every hiking day is when you finally get to be HORIZONTAL!  Hopefully you are cowboy camping, and you can just lie there and look at the stars (which up at 12,000 feet or so on the PCT or CDT, and on a clear night, are almost unbelievable!  What a universe we live in!)Fixit and I have tried lots of different ""sleep systems"" for backpacking.  On our very first try, back in dinosaur days, we just brought along our car camping sleeping bags, zipped together as usual.  Heeeeaaaaavy!   We began to realize we needed something lighter.  Then we discovered Ray Jardine and his ""quilt concept.""  So we tried that approach.  It was much lighter, but had actually the same problem as zipped-together sleeping bags--if one person is a tosser 'n turner (that would be Fixit), every time they flop around, it lets a lot of COLD air into the nice warm ""nest"".  So when we decided to do the PCT in 2005, we realized it would be better if we each had our own sleeping bag.  But what kind?  Synthetic?  Down?  Yikes!  The word was ""If you use a tarp, you want synthetic; if you use a tent, you can go with down""--the theory being that if synthetic gets wet, it still works OK, but down becomes useless.  Well, after comparing WEIGHT, we decided to be brave and go with down. We got our down bags from GoLite.  Wow, were we glad!  The bags were light and if it was a very cold night, there were ways to enhance their warmth.  Those down bags served us well for two entire thruhikes of the PCT.  For the CDT, we were trying to get even lighter, and ended up with new down bags from ZPacks.  They were noticeably lighter than the GoLite bags, and just as warm.  Fixit's sleeping bag has a zipper, because sometimes he gets too hot, and likes to unzip.  I am never too hot, so my sleeping bag has NO zipper!  On the trail, EVERY day (unless it is raining), at noon when we stop to cook, we take our sleeping bags out and lay them in the sun, inside out, to thoroughly dry and air.  Whoever is not cooking (that would be Fixit!) gets to periodically turn the sleeping bags so they get lots of sun on every side. Then when we pack up after lunch, we are stowing two very nice DRY, aired sleeping bags!When it's time to go to bed, we make sure we are ""slooshed off"" before putting on our sleeping clothes, which are lightweight silk longsjohns plus lightweight wool socks.  That's plenty of warmth for most nights on the trail.  But if it gets really cold, we have ""add-ons"".  These include our fleece hats and gloves, and our jackets.  If more is needed, we spread our raingear jacket OVER the sleeping bag, and actually stick the foot of the sleeping bag INTO our packs. Actually, Fixit rarely has to do that--it's me, 3rd Monty that is usually the one trying to stay warm.  In fact, sometimes I tell Fixit he is my hot water bottle, because I can snuggle up next to him and get warm! Our sleeping clothes are ONLY used for sleeping, and nothing else, unless it would be a truly dire emergency.  We have never needed to use our sleeping clothes for anything else but sleeping.  It feels so good to put them on after a long day!If it is a hot night (pretty rare on the PCT or CDT), we sleep ON TOP of our sleeping bags.  We are wondering a lot about hot nights on the AT, with humidity.  Sounds pretty uncomfortable.  Being from the West, we have NO experience with humidity other than occasional winter ""Pineapple Express"" storms off the Pacific that bring rather humid air.  But when we read AT hiker journals about dripping with sweat after hiking only 5 minutes, we can only look puzzled and say, ""Well, I guess we'll see what we see.""  And trying to sleep with that kind of heat and humidity sounds kinda tough.  Again, we'll just have to see.You know you're a hiker when.....your old pack is nearly waterproof from the amount of duct tape holding it together!",,View Entry,"Dec 20, Sun",0
Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632086,"Fixit and I have figured it out that you want to START a long trail with feet that are already pretty toughened up.  When we did the PCT in 2010 (our 2nd time), only 50 miles from the Mexican border,  we were passing a lot of people way younger than us because they were in PAIN with their feet.  We breezed on by and felt sorry for them, but there wasn't really anything we could do for them.So before a thruhike, we start checking on our feet to see how they are doing, and this Monday I was very pleased to see the toughness starting to happen on the soles of my feet.  It comes from carrying WEIGHT to train with.  Fixit just likes to jump right in and load up to full weight right away, while I like to ease into it.  So for the next 2 weeks, I will be carrying 13 lb. every time I go for a walk or a hike.  The weight goes up another pound every 2 weeks.  For our all-day training hike this week, we went back to Trione-Annadel State Park.  It has plenty of hills and most important, LOTS of rocky trail.  In fact, one of the trails is named, ""Rough Go"".  We always make a point of doing that one!  It was a very chilly and foggy morning when we started, so we were in multi-layers to stay warm.  But hiking in the fog is beautiful in its own way, especially when the sun is trying to get through, and creates a sort of glow.  When we were doing the CDT in 2016, we were walking past an area called ""El Malpais"", in the fog, just after sunrise, and I felt like we were walking through a watercolor painting because of the misty light and colors.  It was sort of that way Monday morning--the oak trees have mostly lost their leaves, and you can see all the lichens and moss and twisting, complex branch patterns of the oaks.  But it is frustrating!  It's so pretty, but I dare not look at it, or I probably would do a faceplant on the rough 'n rocky trail.  So I have to just come to a complete halt every little bit and soak in the beauty of a foggy morning. Finally the fog cleared, and there were some smoother stretches of trail with great views of meadows with forest beyond.  Sometimes we could see way down below to the city of Santa Rosa, and sometimes we got far horizon views of Mt. St. Helena in the distance.After an hour's hiking, we were starting to shed layers.  The forests are not all as dense as they were before the fires 3 years ago, and part of the park is closed from the fires this fall.  So we get more sun than we used to!  Some of the trees are totally dead and will never recover, but a number of them are resprouting from the roots.  It's sad to remember how beautiful it used to be.   Fixit and I will be long gone before things look anywhere near like they used to.  Doesn't look like the park manager types have learned anything, though.  The crummy forest management that was in place before the fires is still in place, so I guess the fires will be back.  Fixit and I volunteered on a PCT trail crew one summer, working on a stretch of the PCT up in Washington, near Mt. Adams.  It was technically a wilderness area, and there had been a fire which made a mess of things.  Our job was to fix the trail and remove any burned trees that could be a hazard.  The crew chief said that because it was a wilderness area, nobody could use power tools AND when there is a fire, they are very limited in what they can do to stop it, because it's WILDERNESS and you are not supposed to interfere with nature.  Crazy!  Anyway, because of the recent bit of rain we've had, the grass is finally really growing again, the newts were out (had to watch our step on the trail so as not to step on them!) and the mushrooms are beginning to sprout.  All of this is happening rather late because of the lack of rain.  Fixit and I are hoping for more rain so we can hike in it!  We do use hands-free umbrellas, both for rain and for shade when it's hot and we are in the sun.  Haven't had to deploy the umbrellas yet this year!  But our feet are starting to toughen up, and that's a plus!Thanks to all of you who are sending encouraging comments!  You know you're a hiker when.....you're always looking for new backpack food possibilities every time you're at the store!  ",,View Entry,"Dec 23, Wed",0
Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632118,"When Fixit and I are talking to non-hikers about our adventures, the question ALWAYS comes up:  ""When you're out on the trail for weeks on end, what do you miss the most?""  For me, there is only one answer:  ""Water faucets!""  I can happily do without beds, showers, stoves, chairs, refrigerators, etc. etc.  But oh man, I miss water faucets!  In a house, only a few steps and you are instantly at a source of clean, good water!  On the trail, it's a constant study of ""How far to the next water?  Do we have enough to get there? And once we get there, will we have to DO something to the water so we can drink it?""  Every night I'm studying maps and wrassling with the logistics of WATER!!!
Well, Fixit and I have been through a sort of many-years-long process in figuring out what works best for us when it comes to water in the backcountry.  We never even backpacked until about 1980.  Until then, it was car camping, with faucets in the campground.  Then we bravely headed out one summer into Lassen National Park (a very fine backpacking destination, by the way, with lots of lakes!). At that point in time, we thought that a 7-8 mile hike was a big deal.  So we spent several days sort of going from lake to lake and having a great time.  We drank the lake water with no treatment whatsoever and were fine.
Fast forward a few years, and we had a surprise new addition to our family--a 3rd kid (13 years between her and kid #2).  For 2 years, no backpacking.  Sigh.  Groan.  But when she was 3, we said, ""OK, kid, let's go!"" and off we went.  People would catch up to us miles out on the trail and say, ""Whoah, we've been following these tiny ""elf footprints"" and wondering where they came from!""  But we also were worried now about ""What if she drinks some bad water and gets really sick way out here?""  So we did treat the water, using a system of little tablets where first you ""super-chlorinate"" a jug of water, let it sit awhile, then add ""anti-chlor"" to neutralize the chlorine.  The water tasted fine, none of us got sick, and it worked.
Eventually little gal grew up and was not very keen on our backpack trips, so we were back to going it alone.  Being somewhat concerned about health problems with chlorine, we decided to go with a ceramic filter setup.  Lots of dangly tubes, the pump itself, and tedious half hours or more of sitting and pumping water.  Not fun.  Hassle, hassle.  And it was bulky and heavy-ish to carry.  Then along (with great fanfare) came the Sawyer Squeeze system.  Yay, lighter weight!  No dangling spaghetti mess of tubes!   But after taking it on a Tahoe Rim Trail run, we decided, ""This is not much better than pumping.  It is no fun to be sitting around squeezing, either.""  And besides that, you have to carry a whole ""dirty water bag"" that is only used for water treatment.  We tried an ""inline"" Sawyer filter and felt like it was hard to suck water out of.
So in the end, we have settled on our favorite approach, which is, ""Whenever possible, don't worry--just drink the water.  But if there is some real reason for concern, use Aqua Mira.""  Aqua Mira is totally safe--in fact, it is actually GOOD for your health, and there are people who use it to treat all sorts of illnesses.  It involves 2 little tiny bottles.  One is chlorine dioxide, and the other is a phosphoric acid solution.  Sounds nasty, right?  (Especially after I said we avoid chlorine!)  But when you combine the two, you get a great germ-killing concoction that your body actually likes!  And no pumping, no squeezing, no wasted time.  
What we do is when we arrive at a water source, we evaluate it.  ""Can we just drink this, no worries?""  If there is cause for concern (as there often was on the CDT because of all the cows and beavers along the trail route), then here's what we do.  Fixit collects all our water containers (we each carry a 2+ liter platypus and a 1+liter bottle) and fills them with the ""dirty"" water.  Meanwhile, I set up the ""kitchen"", which is 4 small bottle caps, one cap for each water container.  I set them in a row, and put in drops of chlorine dioxide (16 for the 2-liter bottles, 8 for the 1 liter bottles).  Then I put in an equal amount of phosphoric acid solution.  It turns yellow and sort of ""steams"".  I let it sit for 5 minutes.  Usually by this time, Fixit is about done collecting water.  When the 5 minutes are up, I dump the contents of the bottle caps into the appropriate sized water container, shake it up, put the platy tubes back on the platys and caps back on the 1-liters, we put them all back in our packs, and off we go, with a quick check of our watches, because we need to wait at least 15-30 minutes before actually drinking the water we just treated. ( We generally play it safe and wait 30 minutes.)  But during that 30 minutes, we are continuing to hike!  No sitting around!  And the water tastes just fine, plus now it is not only safe, it is actually extra-healthy!
The only ""dark side"" to Aqua Mira is that the phosphoric acid solution will wreak havoc in your pack if it leaks.  So each little bottle has its own snack bag size ziplok, and the two of them are in a regular ziplok.  We've never had them leak, but we like to be careful--we have heard a few horror stories!
On the CDT, we met a number of hikers who got really sick from bad water.  We never did, thanks to Aqua Mira.  On the PCT, both times, we never brought any water treatment at all.  On our first PCT run, Fixit got sick for awhile, but just kept going.  In 2010, both of us got very sick with something or other (giardia?? we don't know) from having to drink bad water on a DETOUR (the PCT was closed due to fire damage).  We actually had to go home for a week to recuperate, before getting back on the trail.  But we still did not carry any water treatment, on the theory that in general, PCT water is safe.  If I did the PCT again (which I would very much like to do!), I think I would carry Aqua Mira for the southern California desert, and then skip it for the rest of the hike, and just drink the water we find along the trail.  Washington state water especially is just awesome!  Wow, it tastes good!
Based on what I've read about the AT, we will bring our Aqua Mira, but only use it if it really looks necessary.  And from what I can tell, most (though not all) of the AT usually has water available.  I guess it sort of depends on how much rain there has been.  And it sort of sounds like there is PLENTY of that!

Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632139,"This week for our AT all-day training hike, we went back to the hike I am now calling ""The Roller Coaster Hike"" because it's all up 'n down except for one brief stretch walking across the dam of a reservoir.  And most of the ups are BIG ones, with rather steep stretches included.  I figure this is a good thing for working on being ready for the AT.  The scenery on this hike varies from awesome vistas (all the way out to the Pacific if there is no fog) and all the way to San Francisco Bay, plus a beautiful reservoir and lots of forest.  The fall colors are pretty much done now, but the compensation is that you can see the intricate patterns of the bare tree branches.  We've been getting very encouraging and helpful advice from folks who stop by our Guest Book, and some have mentioned that the AT is pretty much roller coaster up 'n down constantly--so I think we will return to this particular hike on a regular basis.  It's a killer, though--we are TIRED when we get done with it.  Oh, and did I mention that part of it includes a section where you have to negotiate a very root-tangled, narrow path on a steep hillside?  I reckon that's sort of ""AT-ish"", too.  On our return hike, we were at the top of the last descent, which is quite a long one, and we met a whole crowd of people who were just coming up.  Seeing us, they scrambled to put on their covid masks--we laughed at them and said, ""Hey, if you can get up that hill you just came up, you do NOT have covid!""  Good laughs were had all around!I was so glad to see them laugh!  It is so sad to see how horribly uptight and mean some people are becoming over the covid situation.  I just finished reading a piece about Bill Boehm, who is an ecologist, explorer, author and incredible nature photographer.  To say he's had an adventurous life would be an understatement!  He has two graduate level degrees--one in Forest Science and one in Wildlife Science.  One of the things he said in the article was this:  ""I am concerned that the university climate today does not emphasize a respectful debate as it did in my time 50 years ago.  Today, it is stifled by bullying, identity politics, and personal attacks.  Such tactics only demonstrate that the facts, and the beauty of truth, are not sought any more.  Rather, it is all about dogma, and alignment on 'sides'.""  Yeah.  And that's true not just of the covid debate, but of the forest management debate and many others.  Fixit and I have our opinions, and we enjoy discussing them with other people.  We spent 5 years living in southern Africa, back in the late 1970's, and one of the most enjoyable parts of life in Africa was that people ENJOYED a good debate!  We had a friend we used to get together with every Friday night--he was a South African cancer researcher, and we'd sit at his kitchen table with our cups of rooibos tea, and he'd plant his elbows on the table and challenge Fixit to a debate on some controversial topic.  Usually these were of a theological nature, but not always!  It was a blast.  We had VERY different views from our scientist friend, but we all loved a good intellectual challenge and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  Sad, sad, sad, that you don't find this happening now in the USA.You know you're a hiker when....vagabonds don't look scary to you anymore--they just look like fellow ""hiker trash""",,View Entry,"Dec 31, Thu",0
Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632165,"Fixit and I are starting to collect FOOD for hiking the AT.  Compared to what we had to collect for the PCT or CDT, it's not much.  On those trails, our resupply boxes often had to bring us everything we would need for another week of hiking, because the resupply points were often little backcountry places that basically  just stock beer and snacks for fishermen.  Beer's a bit heavy to carry (unless you are doing the 8-bottle challenge out of Casa de Luna on the PCT--we didn't try that and didn't want to, but we sure caught up with people who were doing it--trying to chug 8 whole bottles of beer while hiking 10 miles doesn't exactly make for speedy hiking!)  And fisherman snacks are fun but I would not want to eat them for a week, much less have to deal with all the packaging.
Here's our basic standard ""trail food"".....
Breakfast: Granola plus a lot of nuts & seeds and dried fruit; powdered milk; Emergen-C to drink.  (We eat breakfast once we've been on the trail for an hour or so and we find a good ""sun patch"" to sit in.  Eating breakfast in the dark and cold at 5:30/6:00 am is NOT a fun way to start the day.)
Dinner (which we eat at NOON--we NEVER cook or eat where we camp) is either something we brought from our last resupply (like pizza or a sandwich) OR it is a freezedried dinner with added dried veges from our garden back home (every summer unless we are thruhiking, I grow and dry tomatoes, zucchini, shallots, leeks, green beans, carrots and bell peppers). Beside the dried veges we also add a packet of tuna or Spam or bacon bits or jerky.  We also eat a ""dessert"" of some cookies (or maybe a little something nicer if we just came from a resupply).  And sometimes I will also make a ""redneck mocha""  (mix hot chocolate powder with instant coffee!).
Supper (we eat this usually at 5:30 or so-- about 1-1 1/2 hours before we stop to camp) could be crackers or tortilla or a bread roll with peanut butter or cheese or cream cheese, or crushed potato chips and freezedried refried beans. We also eat some dried fruit (fresh fruit or a raw vege if we've just left a resupply).  We also drink up whatever is left of our electrolyte solution (see Electrolyte, below)
Snacks (we stop for a snack midmorning and midafternoon) are typically Snickers or gorp or something similar. 
Electrolyte--we mix up some electrolyte powder (the kind from the Emergen-C company) and a bit of Crystal Lite powder and drink from this off and on all day long, making up another batch when we are at a water supply point.  If it's been really hot (like in the deserts of the southern PCT or CDT, we often mix up a whole liter of this and just blow it down on the spot.  I remember in the Great Divide Desert on the CDT, where water is scarce, late one day we reached a spring with ice cold water.  Two other CDT hikers were there ahead of us, and we all took turns filling our bottles, adding some electrolyte and then just chugging it!  Wow, that was good!  And ice cold after a hot day!  Who could ask for better?
On the PCT and CDT, when we collected our resupply box, we always tried to also buy stuff from whatever the local town/resort/whatever had available, so we wouldn't give thruhiking a bad name by just blowing in, collecting a box and leaving.
But the AT...sound like it's going to be kinda different.  For one, mailing boxes from CA to ""back East"" is pretty expensive.  And it sounds like finding towns with grocery stores is not very hard on the AT.  So our plan at this point is ONLY MAIL what we figure would be harder to find.  So we are mailing ourselves some freezedried dinners (nowhere near as many as we did on the PCT or CDT), and also the Emergen-C, and electrolyte stuff, and some powdered milk (I find powdered milk in small quantities is not easy to locate in a grocery store).  We also take some vitamins with our meals, and we will definitely mail those.  So our AT resupply boxes are really small compared to the ones we used to mail to ourselves, which basically had EVERYTHING we would need.
The downside of this is--when I get to a resupply, instead of just opening a box and tossing the contents into our food bags, then spending most of my time resting, I now will have to (BIG sigh) go grocery shopping.  I am not exactly thrilled at the prospect.  However, going grocery shopping at the town of Chama on the CDT actually ended up doing us a BIG favor.  Coming in to Chama, we were running into the first of the ""fun"" postholey powder snow of Colorado (very, very different from the High Sierra snow we were used to, which you can actually WALK on a fair amount of the time).  We quickly began to realize that hiking through the south San Juans of Colorado was not going to be like PCT High Sierra.  We were a bit worried about running out of food.  So in Chama, I went grocery shopping.  I got a couple of bags of stuff (some of which was for us to eat while in Chama) and when I started the 2 mile or so walk back to the old hotel where we were staying, I thought, ""Argh.  I'll see if I can yogi a ride back.""  I spotted a cowboy type guy throwing some groceries in the back of his pickup and went over and asked if he could give me a lift. Sure, he could!  And we had a nice chat--I told him what Fixit and I were doing, and he wished us luck.
Fast forward about 4 days....Fixit and I were up in the snow on a high ridge.  We had spent HUGE amounts of time over the last few days being sorta lost to kinda lost to being really lost. At one point, we even lost each other by doing the TOTALLY STUPID thing of splitting up-- ""The trail must be right around here somewhere--I'll look over this way, and you look over that way......""  A little while later, we both realized we not only didn't know where the trail was, but even yelling and shouting, we could not find each other.  Man, that was scary.  When we finally reconnected (and yes, there was a lot of praying on both sides!), we vowed we would never ever split up again to hunt for trail.  
Now we were sitting on that high ridge and studying the topography and the maps, and I finally figured out exactly where we were.  I also looked at our food situation.  Not good.  At the rate we were going, we would take at least 3 days to reach the next road, and we only had half that left in food.  But the map showed a possibility.  We could ditch the CDT and bushwhack down the South Fork of the Navajo River, reach a road, and walk into the next resupply THAT way.  OK, it turned out that just getting down to the road involved some scary adventures in getting through ""impossible"" terrain (we made it by following elk trails) and when we finally reached a ranch, guess what?  The same guy who had given me a lift 4 days before was the manager of that ranch!  Whew!  The other people on the ranch were NOT very kind or friendly to us, but he was, because he'd met me in town.  So OK, having to go grocery shopping can have unexpectedly good consequences!
Personally, I chalk that one up as a ""Thank You, Lord!""  I do not think it was a blind coincidence.  I am grateful to know that God is real and He is right there with us.  Fixit and I do NOT EVER go with the ""God is in control"" awfulness that some people try to selfishly comfort themselves with.  Our motto is, ""We know God is WITH us and He loves us, and whatever happens, He will help us to know what to do.""  And we really do listen to what He has to say!
So I wonder, I wonder--if grocery shopping in Chama leads to adventures, what will grocery shopping on the AT do?  It will be interesting to find out!

Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632196,"November-March in northern California is supposed to be ""rainy season"", and there have been years when just about every week when we do our all-day hike, we do it in the rain.  Not this season. Sunny and dry has been the norm.  But this last Monday, we finally got a ""rainy hike""!  Every time we do this, I look out the window at the cold (typically low 50's, which for us Californios is COLD) and the rain, and think, ""Are we crazy to go out in this?""  But as soon as we head out on the trail, with the rain pouring down and the wind gusting,  the adventure takes over, and yes!  It is fun!On Monday we did one of our favorite hikes, which is the Willow Creek Valley Trail to the Pomo Trail, all here in Sonoma County.  We park up at the top of a ridge above the Valley, and in this case, we were immediately immersed in the classic pouring rain and wind really pushing us around.  The trail (formerly a county road) switchbacks leisurely down, down and down, through redwood groves, Douglas Fir forests, and a few grassy hillsides, with the moss and lichens getting longer and thicker the farther down in the valley you get.  Both Fixit and I continue to slowly raise our packweight, and we were having no problems with it.  I was very happy to start seeing what I jokingly call the ""Scattered Starlight"" mushrooms.  I don't know what their real name is, but they are tiny, intensely white mushrooms that grow in the DARKEST places on the forest floor.  They actually almost seem to shine, because they are so intensely white in such dark ""holes"".  That's why I call them ""Scattered Starlight.""Once you are down at the bottom of the hill, you're walking along Willow Creek, which has been restored tremendously since standard-type logging and cattle grazing were ended.  I am a fan of cattle, because they do help protect the forests from fire, by keeping undergrowth ""chewed down"", but in this case what had happened is that the ranchers actually CLEARED the forest to make hayfields.  That's a whole 'nuther story.  Now the forest is making a comeback, the creek is looking great, and there still are a few 4-legged critters.  We headed up the Pomo Trail, and started running into obstacles--fallen trees.  Apparently nobody has been doing much work to keep the trail open.  The first big downed tree, we scrambled AROUND (a hassle in very wet blackberry tangles!).  Other downed trees weren't much of an obstacle.  On the way back, instead of going around the large downed tree, we instead went THROUGH it, which has its own kind of challenges.  But we remembered places on both PCT and CDT (especially the CDT) where the fallen trees were quite a challenge.  On the PCT, it was fallen GIANTS up in Washington State, where you practically needed climbing equipment to make it through, and then on the CDT there were stretches where everything was just covered with masses of fallen trees--not giant ones like on the PCT, but so MANY that by the time we got through the mess, we'd be covered with bruises and scratches.We are wondering about the AT??  How often will we have to be dealing with fallen trees?  The worst of course is BEING THERE when a tree (or a big hunk of it) goes down.  We've ""been there, done that"" too.  I would much rather climb over a tree that is already down than hear one coming down close by!We concluded the day all rosy-cheeked from cold and wet, but otherwise fine.  It was a good rainy day!You know you're a hiker when...you look for little tiny containers (like for cosmetics, etc) at the grocery store, bring them home, dump out the contents, and refill them with your own hiking supplies.",,View Entry,"Jan 06, Wed",0
Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632238,"Anybody who is a fan of the A & E version of Pride & Prejudice knows the scene where Mr. Darcy is trying to quickly put on some better clothes to replace the ones he just went for a swim in--this leads to the famous line, ""No, no! The green one!"" referring to a green coat.  You know the scene, right?
Well, when it comes to HIKING clothes, Fixit and I are kinda ""No, no!  Not THAT one!"" when we look at what many other hikers wear.  Having done three thru-hikes, we pretty much have settled on what works for us. So ""taking it from the top"" (literally!) here's what we do.....
HAT:  Of course we wear a hat, with a brim.  NOT a cute bandana (awwwww, bandanas are cute--but useless.  I do carry a bandanna, hanging in a loop off my pants waistband, and i do use it for many things, but NOT for a hat substitute!) and definitely not NO hat.  Wearing a brimmed hat protects your EYES from the sun (sunglasses don't protect from sunlight falling straight down, or from the side.)  We value our eyes, so we protect them!  Hats also mean no need for sunblock (we do NOT do sunblock--nasty unhealthy chemicals soaking into our skin--no way!)  Since the PCT and CDT take you up to seriously high elevations (like 12, 13, 14,000 feet) if you don't wear a hat, you are going to be cooked!  Hats mean no rain getting on my glasses (I wear glasses).  Hats mean that when the mosquitoes (we like the Brit term, ""mossies"") are bad, you drop a headnet over your hat and the brim keeps the net well away from your face and neck.
SHIRT:  We wear LONG-sleeved loose shirts.  Fixit buys his; I make my own.  They are made of a very lightweight sunblock fabric (again, no need for chemical sunblock).  Not only are we protected from sun, but also from ticks.  And as long as we keep moving, they do pretty well to fend off mossies.  If we stop and the mossies attack, then we put on raingear.  (Oh, did I mention we DON'T do mosquito repellent, either--more nasty chemicals soaking into your skin!).  The shirts are loose and very comfortable to wear in any kind of weather, hot or cold.  The fabric is very quick to dry if it gets wet.  Hmmmm, I hear that on the AT, the ""wet"" might often not be rain--it might be SWEAT. . We have a little bit of experience with that, hiking the PCT in Southern CA, when it is really hot.  But with the humidity on the AT, I hear it's WAY worse.  We have next to no experience with humidity.  It sounds like a real drag.  We will see!
PANTS:  Again, LONG pants, loose fit.  Sunblock fabric (a heavier fabric than the shirt).  I make the pants for both Fixit and myself.  You'll be able to spot us on the trail, 'cause our pants match--look for two old people with blue pants!  The loose fit makes them very comfortable.  I made the pockets a bit bigger than normal so we can carry stuff in them if needed.  Again, we are protected from sun, mossies, and ticks AND from scratchy, sharp vegetation & grasses along the trail.  We've hiked in areas where if we did not have long pants on, our legs would have been a scratched up mess.  And if we have to ford a creek, the pants dry very fast afterwards. Also, since generally in hiking, your legs do take a beating from sharp branches, thorny stuff, rough rocks, etc., I find that our loose, fabric pants are very easy to mend.  I've seen more and more gals hiking in leggings, and I just shake my head.  How do you fix a hole in a legging, where you just snagged it on a branch?  I used to be Wardrobe Mistress for a professional ballet school, so I know a lot about working with anything ""lycra"".  Once you have a hole....you have a PROBLEM.  So for me, forget the leggings.
FEET:  I already wrote a post about feet, but a quick review:  We wear 2 layers of socks, La Sportiva UltraRaptor trail runners, and Outdoor Research gaiters.
For the AT, we are doing something we have never done before--we had our shirts, pants, outer layer socks, and gaiters treated professionally with permethrin, to hopefully avoid picking up ticks and Lyme disease.  This was a bit of a tough decision, since we avoid nasty chemicals, but in the end we decided that getting Lyme disease was a lot worse than being exposed to permethrin.
So basically, we say, ""No, no! Not THAT one!"" to hiking in shorts/leggings, T-shirt and bandana.  Our motto is ""Long 'n Loose!""

Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632259,"On Monday (Jan. 11) Fixit and I returned to a trail we haven't done for some time, following the ridgeline above San Geronimo Creek, Lagunitas Creek, and Kent Lake.  Much of the trail (it's a fire road, actually) travelled through a type of terrain that's found on several of the North Bay ridgetops--I call it ""Cypress & Serpentine"".  It is a very unique experience.  Serpentine is a very pretty greenish-colored rock that is also quite smooth.  But when there is a LOT of it, as up on certain ridgetops, very few plants will grow--except for cypress, manzanita and a few wildflowers.  And those cypress do not grow into the towering giants we see in the nearby valleys--they grow into what I guess you could call ""large bonsai's"".  The biggest of them are only a few feet taller than Fixit and I, even though they are very old.  And like all bonsais, they look like they have been trained to grow in decorative patterns.  The ""trainer"" in this case is the wind.  We've hiked this particular ridge during rainstorms where the wind was blowing the rain sideways at right angles to us!But as we hiked, of course we were thinking and talking about the AT.  The serpentine rocks up on the ridge are mixed sometimes with a reddish colored volcanic rock as well as some black obsidian-like rocks.  We recalled talking to a lady we met on the PCT up in Oregon, who had recently moved there from New England (close to the AT), and she was complaining about how ""boring"" the rocks were in Oregon.  She said, ""Where I come from, we had LOTS of different KINDS of rocks!  All I see here is lava, lava and more lava.""  Well, we sure have heard plenty about ROCKS on the AT!  Whew. ""Rocksylvania"" sounds like quite a challenge! But one thing I will be looking at as we hike is ""Let's see how many different KINDS of rocks there are!""  I have to admit to being fascinated by rocks and also by DIRT (which is basically ""rotted rocks"" plus organic material).  When I was a kid, I actually collected DIRT.  I had baby food jars, and whenever I found a new and interesting dirt, I'd collect some and put it in a jar labeled with where I found it.  I liked rocks, too, and collected some of thoseHowever, given the ""rock horror stories"" I've been hearing about the AT, I wonder if by the end I will still love rocks???But I do intend to take a pebble from the top of Springer Mtn. and carry it to Mt. Katahdin.  I think that is a really cool idea.  You know you're a hiker when.....you go to visit family out of state and instead of going to the local tourist attractions, you check out the maps and get them to go hiking with you!",,View Entry,"Jan 14, Thu",0
Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632327,"I hear that the motto of the AT is something like “No rain, no pain, no Maine.”  Well, since we’ve done the whole PCT twice and the CDT once, and Fixit does the whole JMT every year and we do other  backpack trips, Fixit and I have had our share of nasty weather on the trail. Cold and wet do not stop us from hiking.  The only thing that will make us “bail offtrail” is a full-on SNOWstorm, and we’ve only had that happen twice (once on the PCT, once on the CDT).

But we do not underestimate the danger of hypothermia.  Even here in California, every winter we hear sad tales of unprepared people who die of hypothermia, sometimes in just a very cold rain. On the PCT in southern California in 2010, we met a trail angel who just a few days before had helped save the life of a PCT hiker.  This trail angel had set up an awesome little “way station” (Which even included tubs of water for washing your socks!  He knew what hikers need!) He told us, “Just a couple of days ago I was hanging out here in my big tent with some hikers.  It was dark and raining and really cold.  All of a sudden, in stumbles a hiker in shorts and a T-shirt, soaking wet and just babbling crazy talk.  We all said, ‘Hypothermia!’ and we all went to work on him—hot drinks, dry, warm clothes, hot soup-- the works, and even then it took  awhile before he like woke up and was OK.”  If the trail angel had not been there, that hiker would probably have died.

So hypothermia is not something to mess with.  We are careful.  But what we do when the weather goes nasty is, we start to LAYER UP!

COLD

Normally we just hike along in our long pants and long sleeve shirts.  But if it starts to get a bit chilly, we start adding things, a little at a time.  The first add-on is gloves.  We find that if our hands are warm, often the rest of us stays pretty warm, too.

If that’s not enough, the next layer is what we jokingly call our “polypheeeews”—long sleeve knit “long underwear” tops.  These are very light weight, but being synthetic, if you sweat in them, they can get really stinky, ie, “pheeeew!”   It’s best if these tops are just a bit loose—you stay warmer than if they are tight.   
If more is needed, I will put on a fleece headband and Fixit puts on a lightweight knit balaclava, worn like a watch cap.

But if all of the above still leaves us shivery, then on goes the Mountain Hardware Ghost Whisperer jacket.   And I will add a fleece cap, while Fixit pulls his balaclava over his face. The combination of all of these will usually get us through most cold.  But if the WIND comes up, we go to the “ultimate defense”—RAIN GEAR!   We are careful with this, though, because we don’t want to get sweaty underneath the rain gear.  Usually the only time I put rain gear on in order to stay warm is 1) It’s freezing, bitter cold, with a stiff wind  or  2) It's snowing or 3) We have stopped for a break or a meal, so we are not moving.  Brrrrrr!  Then you can get cold, fast.

 HAIL—the CROSSOVER  BETWEEN COLD and RAIN!
If you get caught in a hailstorm (we have been several times) and there are no trees to duck under, grab your closed cell foam sleeping pad (which we carry on the outside of our packs) and hunker down UNDER it!  You will be well-protected!

If you use an air mattress, too bad, so sad.  You don’t want to damage your air mattress with hail, so you will get pummelled!  I guess you could put your whole pack over your head, maybe??

RAIN

On the PCT, rain is usually not a problem till you get to Washington.  On the CDT, there can be rain any time (New Mexico mud is something else, when it rains there!), but especially those Rocky Mountain thunderstorms in Colorado, or the rain in Montana.

If the rain looks like just a passing shower (like High Sierra summer thunderstorms), we don’t bother with raingear.  Our clothes are lightweight nylon that dries really fast.   If it looks like more than a passing shower, we will get out the hands-free style umbrella,  and that will keep us going quite well.  
But if it looks like it’s going to be rain, rain, rain, then we do put on rain gear,  which for us is a rain jacket and rain pants.   We may or may not wear them both.  That’s why we like having them as separates—we can decide how much “coverage” we need.  The air temperature and wind often are a big consideration here—if it’s very cold and/or very windy we wear both, but if it’s not that cold or windy, then only one.   And if it’s raining, I take my fanny pack (used to carry camera, and other small items) off my waist and hang it around my neck, underneath the rain jacket and/or umbrella, so it stays nice and dry.

Why rain gear instead of a poncho?  A lot of hikers bring ponchos.  We never do, because they are only good for one thing—rain (and it had better be a nice, quiet, well-behaved rain with no wind!).  On the other hand, rain gear is a very versatile item.  It is good for  1) Wearing in the RAIN, especially when there is WIND and 2) Wearing in the cold, especially with cold WIND and 3) Keeping off the mosquitoes—they canNOT bite you through rain gear!  and 4) Wearing while you are washing your hiking clothes  (I hate to think of what would happen if all your clothes are in the washing machine, so all you have on is a poncho, and the wind comes up.  Oh dear!)

What about wet shoes & socks?   No problema!  We wear trail running shoes that dry fast—in fact, when we come to a creek or river, we just march right in, shoes ‘n socks ‘n all,  come sloshing out on the other side and keep hiking!  The shoes do not take long to dry, if given a chance.  And we have found that even when your shoes and socks are soaking wet from rain, river crossing, or whatever, as long as you keep hiking, your feet will be nice and warm!  
On the PCT in 2010, we’d been hiking in day after day of rain in Washington, when finally the sun tried to come out around noon one day.  Hooray!  We stopped to eat lunch and hung all our very wet, now STINKY socks up on bushes to dry at least a little bit.  To our complete amazement, along came a whole “flock” of beautiful BUTTERFLIES, which lit on our sodden, smelly socks and started sucking on them as if they were full  of nectar!  I said, “Wow, I didn’t know butterflies like ‘eau de trail’!""  All through our lunch break we watched the show of butterflies covering our socks.  When it was time to pack up and head out, I hated to have to shoo them off!

I do admit that when you have hiked in the rain all day, it is very hard the next morning to get up out of a warm sleeping bag, and take off your warm, dry sleeping socks and put on cold, wet pants and cold, wet socks and cold, wet shoes.  NOT FUN!  But we have found that once we get going, we warm up very quickly.

We have heard that we are really “in for it” with rain on the AT.  But we have also heard that at times, the rain is a welcome shower to rinse you off, when you are all gross and sweaty from hiking in humidity.  My dad told me about when he was in the Navy in World War II, stationed in the Pacific, that every afternoon, at a certain time like clockwork, it would just POUR rain, but it was a WARM rain.  All the guys would get ready, and they would really enjoy their daily shower!  Well....I’m not sure I would try that on the trail, but I hear that sometimes the AT rain is actually warm.  Really?  We will have to see!

You know you’re a hiker when......you do your laundry by going for a swim with all your clothes on!

Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632346,"For the last couple of days, our online weather forecast included a bright orange ""WIND ADVISORY!"" in addition to the usual ""drought mode"" stuff we've been seeing.  Oh great.  Just when the grass has been struggling to send up some green, now the moisture gets blown away by the wind.....sigh.
Fixit and I went hiking anyway, but with ""Oh man, I hope it doesn't......"" scenarios flitting through our minds.  One scenario is trail blocked by fallen trees (been there, done that, MANY times).  Another scenario is fire.  With wind conditions like we were having, and everything being mostly still brown and not very green, the possibility of fire was definitely there.  We've had to do trail detours due to both active and post-fire situations.  The most ""fun"" one was on the CDT up in Montanaho (that's the long stretch of trail which straddles the border of Montana and Idaho).  We'd been noticing a lot of helicopters--not good) and as we got farther along, we began to see the smoke.  It looked like it was a couple of ridges 'n valleys over from the trail, so we figured, ""Well, we'll hustle and get outta Dodge as fast as we can.""
So we were hustling, when from behind us came a loud yell:  ""BUSTED!   YOU GUYS ARE SO BUSTED!""  It was Popeye, one of the other CDT hikers.  He was actually running down the trail.  We stopped.  ""Busted?  Whaaaat?""  Popeye said, ""Didn't you guys see the sign back there?  The trail is closed because of the fire!""  Well, we had seen a little sign posted on a tree, way off the trail and we had ignored it thinking it was some kind of ""stay out; we're protecting the vegetation here"" or something like that.  Nope.  It was a TRAIL CLOSED sign.  So of course we had to point at Popeye and say, ""OK, we are ALL busted!  Let's MOVE!""  and we all began to run.  (Well, Popeye ran.  Fixit and I more like jogged.)  We kept going till it was almost dark, and the next morning headed out at sunrise.  It still took a good hour before we reached the other end of TRAIL CLOSED.  Whew.
So we are very leery of fires in the backcountry, and we also keep in mind what we would do in a worst case scenario that a fire came right AT us.
As we hiked along (it was Monday, Jan. 18), we saw a lot of what I call ""green twiggy stuff"" on the trail, blown off the trees.  The wind was howling in the treetops.  Then it was bigger branches.  And finally, yes, a couple of trees down, across the trail.  They were dead trees, killed by the fire a couple of years ago, and getting over them involved getting charcoal on my pants.  Oh well.
The trail was very busy, though, wind or no wind.  It was MLK Day, and it seems that the BIKERS were out in force.  I have never encountered so many in just one day before.  And there were even HORSES.  It's interesting to see the different things we all wear.  Bikers wear bright and gaudy.  Hikers like us just look ""grunge"".  And then there are the horseback riders.  They usually have more the ""cowboy"" look.
Everybody was enjoying the very warm (even with the wind) weather.
So we were thinking, ""How's the WIND on the AT?""  We've hiked on both PCT and CDT in wind so strong that it practically blows you over, and probably would if you don't have trek poles for support.  There's a very funny video I've seen of PCT hikers staggering along like drunken sailors on the trail near Tehachapi Pass (it's always fierce winds there!).  From what I hear, the wind can get really, really bad up on Mt. Washington and in the Whites on the AT, but when that happens, it includes rain, which is no joke.  Not to mention trying to hike in awful wind on wet, slippery rocks.  At least on the PCT and CDT, when there is awful wind, it's usually dry.  So we figure the AT has potential to be pretty tough, wind-wise.

Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632378,"Well, Fixit and I have (hopefully) got all our ducks in a row for getting to the top of Springer Mountain on April 23.  One of the things I always look for every time I read somebody's trail journal or blog is, ""HOW did you GET TO the trail?""  Often it's a spouse driving them or a kind friend giving them a lift.  Well, we are BOTH going, so can't drive each other, and our kind friends are all out here in California--can't very well expect them to go all the way ""back East"" for us, so we are on our own!So here is our plan--perhaps it will be helpful to others in our situation.1) Getting to the airport   We live about 1 1/2 hours away from the San Francisco airport, so that means taking the Airporter Bus.  And for us, that would mean getting up at 3:00 am, HIKING 40-45 minutes to the bus station, and then off to the airport.  We were planning to do this!  But a kind friend found out and said, ""Oh no, you're NOT!""  So on April 22, she will be picking us up at 4:30 am and driving us all the way to the airport!  Wow!  2) Fly non-stop to Atlanta in the daytime, with packs as checked baggage.We have another friend who is a flight attendant, and her advice was ""Fly NON-STOP!""  That way, far less worries about our packs getting lost.  So we will put BOTH our packs (loaded with everything we will need for the first few days on trail, except for fuel and water) into a box.  That will be less than 50 lb, so no problem with the checked bag weight limit. I know of one West Coast AT thru-hiker who brought her pack aboard the plane, and the TSA people confiscated her Nutella!  We also carry Nutella, but mostly we just don't want to take the chance of some over-zealous TSA person confiscating other things, like for example, the tiny jackknife I like to carry.As to flying in the daytime, well, when we've flown ""back East"" before, we did a red-eye flight and we were just WASTED the next few days.  So daytime it will be for getting to Atlanta.  A long day, but at least it will be a DAY.3. Take the MARTA train to North Springs station.Once we get our packs back at baggage claim, from what we can tell, it does not look difficult to find the MARTA light rail station at the Atlanta airport.  Then we have to make sure we get on the right train (there are 2 routes) and go to the North Springs Station.4. Go to the hotel recommended by Survivor Dave.  If you want details on which hotel, etc. you can contact Survivor Dave.  His phone number (NO TEXTS) is (678) 469-0978.   You can take a look at his website:  survivordave.com   but you can't email him.  He only works by PHONE, and no texting.   The reason I am being a bit cagey about which hotel, is that Survivor Dave has a special rate there for people he is driving to the trail.5. Ride to Amicalola Falls SP with Survivor Dave.Dave will pick us up bright 'n early on the morning of April 23.  He also has stove fuel we will buy (since we can't bring it on the plane).  He will drop us off at Amicalola Falls SP.  Dave knows a lot about the AT and a lot about thru-hiking.  I would say he is a very helpful and great resource!6. Getting to the top of Springer Mountain.Well, since we did the CDT, which is a sort of ""choose your own adventure"" route in several places, we figure it doesn't matter which way you go to get to the top of Springer, because the AT doesn't start until then.  So we'll survey the weather, etc. when we get to Amicalola Falls and decide which way to go.  We might do the stairs or we might just walk up the road to the picnic area and pick up trail there, or we might walk the main approach trail.  I dunno.  We'll see what we see.  Our hiking philosophy is we do NOT make any detailed plans.  We just get up and start walking, and when it's a bit before 7 pm, we start looking for a potential camping spot.  We don't need water or other amenities--just a sorta flat piece of ground big enough to fit our little tent.So hopefully, by the evening of April 23, we will be SOMEWHERE along the AT!Getting to the PCT and CDTJust in case any of you are interested, here's how we got to the start of the PCT and CDT.PCT    The first time we did the PCT, we drove a rental car to San Diego, then took a local bus to a trail angel's house.  He gave us a ride to Campo early the next morning.   The second time we did the PCT, we drove a rental car to San Diego, dropped it off in the downtown area, and took the Orange Line light rail to the El Cajon Transit station.  Then we took the ""Southeastern Rural Route"" bus (it runs to Campo only once a day).  We got off at Campo and camped for the night before starting the trail in the morning.  The bus ride was a blast--the little bus was packed with PCT hikers!  But we were the only ones who got off at Campo--the rest opted to go on to Lake Morena Campground, spend the night, then get a ride back to Campo the next day. CDT   The CDT is a ""choose your own adventure"" trail, with THREE choices of where to START.  The sorta-official one, which we opted to do, is at the Crazy Cook monument in the ""bootheel"" of New Mexico.  The problem is  that getting there involves many, many miles of VERY rough dirt road.  If your kind friend or spouse wanted to drive you there, they would need an ATV or a jeep.  Not only that, but the Border Patrol folks have begged the CDT hikers, ""PLEASE start in scheduled groups so we know you are not illegals!""  So we opted to go with the plan offered by the CDTA.  For $100 bucks, they pick you up at the EconoLodge in Lordsburg, New Mexico, and drive you to Crazy Cook.  That was THE ROUGHEST ride I have ever done.  The driver actually stopped a couple of times to give us a break from being tossed around.  We needed it! But first we had to get to Lordsburg.  If you have no one available to drive you there, the two main options are AmTrak and Greyhound bus.  We chose the bus, because it runs more frequently.  So we drove a rental car to Phoenix, AZ, and then took the Greyhound bus to Lordsburg, New Mexico.  From there it's a little bit of a walk to the EconoLodge.You know you're a hiker when.....you see a long line waiting for the bathroom, and look around for a bush!",,View Entry,"Jan 24, Sun",0
Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632429,"Every year right around this time, I get to do a couple of miles of hiking on Market Street, which is the ""main drag"" of downtown San Francisco.  Usually I get to do it with around 200,000 other folks.  :)   And it's a hike for a very worthy cause--the Walk for Life. Normally it's the second-largest pro-life walk in the entire USA.  Some people like to polarize into ""I'm pro-CHOICE"" or ""I'm pro-LIFE"".  I have friends in both camps.  What I say to my pro-choice friends is, ""Hey, I'm pro-CHOICE!  The different between me 'n you is the TIMING of the choice.  You say, ""Be as irresponsible as you want, and oops, if you get pregnant,  THEN make your choice"". The problem with that is no matter which way you choose, somebody gets hurt.""  I say, ""Make the choice AHEAD OF TIME to be responsible, so you DON'T get pregnant, and nobody gets hurt.""
This year,  it was a challenge just getting TO the Walk.  The covid rules in San Francisco have really messed up the Muni bus and train system.  It was a bit of an adventure just getting there.  The organizers thought that with fear of covid plus fear of violent protesters, probably only a couple of hundred people would show up.  Boy, were they wrong!  It turned out to be thousands (Not the usual 200,000, but still, a LOT).  The walkers were all sorts of people--this year a new group came along, called ""Atheists for Life"".  They wanted everybody to know that it's not just those ""religious people"" who are pro-life.  Way to go!
I got some ""rough trail practice"" in, too, for the AT, because San Francisco doesn't seem to be doing a very good job of maintaining their streets.  Market Street had some rough going in it that was pretty bad in a few spots.
Then the next day I did another couple of miles of pro-life hiking here in Sonoma County, this time in the rain!  There was a very good-sized crowd, and when we finished at Courthouse Square, Santa Rosa, there was a wonderful time of spontaneous prayers in English, and Spanish, in both Catholic-style and Baptist-style. We were a pretty motley crew (Fixit and I are REALLY motley--we're active in TWO churches--Anglican and Salvation Army) but very unified in wanting to see the end of the Holocaust of abortion and its betrayal of women.  
Then this last Monday, Fixit and I headed for Point Reyes National Seashore, because we heard that the Rift Zone Trail was open for hiking.  Basically, it's a hike along the San Andreas earthquake fault!  One of our favorite Point Reyes hikes (more than 20 miles) is Rift Zone Trail, then up the mountain to the Lake Ranch Trail, pick up the Coast Trail and follow that through Wildcat Camp, then along the cliffs above the sea to the Bear Valley Trail, and back to the park HQ.  Can't do that loop right now, because a bunch of it is closed due to fire damage.  But it sure was great to be able to do at least PART of it!
It turned out to be good practice for COLD weather hiking, with temperatures in the upper 40's much of the time, plus wind on the ridgetops.  Brrrrrrr!  I wore my raingear all day just to stay warm, plus all my other layers.  Back East people would probably laugh at Fixit and I for thinking it was cold, but hey, we are not used to this!
Another advantage to doing at least part of this favorite loop is that very few other hikers go that way.  Good!  Then we didn't have to deal with all the uptight covid stuff.  Instead, we could enjoy all the new green growth that's starting to spring up--including (sigh) the stinging nettles.  When those are full-grown, they overhang many of the Point Reyes trails, and then I wear rainpants to protect my legs.
Hmmmm, I wonder if there is stinging nettle on the AT?  I hear there IS poison ivy.  I'm very familiar with poison OAK (it's everywhere out here) but I will have to study up on what poison ivy looks like so I can recognize it!  But I guess right now the AT is under snow!

Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632473,"Back in dinosaur days, when Fixit and I first started backpacking, trek poles were completely unheard of.  So at the end of a long day of hiking, my fingers would be like sausages--""hiker edema"", they called it.  I tried my best to REMEMBER to hook a couple of fingers under my shoulder straps, to keep my hands above my heart, and thus avoid sausage fingers, but I never remembered enough.  Just try setting up camp, cooking, etc. when you can hardly bend your fingers!  We would console ourselves with the thought, ""It'll be fine tomorrow morning.""  Since we were not thru-hiking, the next day was usually spent swimming (we always tried to head for backcountry lakes) and poking around looking at rocks, plants, etc. or doing a little bit of orienteering.  (Fixit was really good at this--he was amazing at just NAILING it and finding some obscure little thing on our map, that was way off of any trail).
But then we began to see hikers on the trail swinging along with what looked like ski poles.  Whaaaaaaat????  We did some research, and wow, it looked like ""those trek pole things are a good idea!""  So we each got a pair.  And then we had to face the snarky queries of ""Hey!  Where's the snow?"" as we started using them.
And that was no laughing matter, actually.  I'm a klutz.  I kept getting my feet and my poles all tangled up.  It was really difficult trying to figure out how to make it all coordinate.  And I never forgot the day we were hiking at Jack London State Park, when I tripped over my own trek poles and went down, and just about dislocated my thumb because I was dutifully wearing the wrist straps.  Me 'n the poles were a tangled up mess lying in the trail, and man, did my thumb hurt!  I almost gave up on the trek poles after that.  But the information I'd gathered about how good they are for your knees made me resolve to keep trying to get the hang of them.
I sure am glad I persevered!  Now, both Fixit and I LOVE our trek poles, and consider them a non-optional ESSENTIAL piece of gear.  But one thing we both do when we get new trek poles is we remove the wrist straps!  We don't like the risk of dislocating a thumb.  As to what KIND of trek poles, after Fixit accidentally stepped on his carbon fiber pole and snap!  Instantly the pole was in pieces....we now use titanium poles, made by Leki.  They do cost more than aluminum, but are quite a bit lighter.  I like the titanium, because it's very sturdy and handles rough trail and whitewater river crossings very well.  (I'm talking the kind of river crossings where the poles are vibrating like crazy from the force of the water!)
Fixit and I have very different STYLES when it comes to hiking with trek poles.  I do ""cross-country ski"" style, and Fixit does ""downhill"".  That's because we have very different reasons for using the trek poles.  I use them for  1) Extra ""eyes"".  I wear bifocal glasses, so I can't tell where the ground actually IS.  If I look down through the TOP of my glasses, it looks like it's waaaaaay down there.  If I look down through the bottom of my glasses, the trail looks like it's at my knees.  So the trek poles serve as feelers so I know where the ground is.  2) I'm a klutz, as I said, and without the trek poles, I would do a lot of faceplants in the trail.  The crosscountry style, with one pole reaching out in front, while the other one is still behind, is perfect for this.  3) Steep downhills--I turn my trek poles into ""brakes"" and have them both in FRONT of me as I walk down.
Fixit, on the other hand, is into SPEED.  He is a very fast hiker, and uses his trek poles like downhill ski poles, pushing him along, faster and faster.  I am not strong enough to use the trek poles in that way.  I tell Fixit, ""My arms would fall off if I used my poles the way you do!""  And being a klutz, if I dared try the downhill style, I'd be sprawled in the trail in a couple of minutes!  When Fixit sees a steep downhill, he just stows his trek poles and heads down, typically at a run.  Then he stops at the bottom and waits for me!  And remember--he is 82 years old.  Not bad!  
Now, when people ask me, ""Why do you use those trek poles?""  here's what I tell them:
1) They save your knees.  Using the poles takes many pounds of weight OFF your knees when you are hiking.  And no more ""sausage fingers"" at the end of the day!
2) If you are a woman, they help you AVOID breast cancer.  The lymph system, where breast cancer often causes trouble, has nothing to keep it flowing and well-lubricated except your own MOVEMENT.  The trek poles (especially if you use them cross-country style, as I do) gives your arm and chest muscles a lot of pushing, carrying and lifting movement that pumps the lymph fluid along and keeps the system ""clean.""
3) They exercise your arm muscles, which get very neglected when all you do is HIKE.
4) They are great for BALANCE.  You have way less worries about a trip 'n fall when you have trek poles.  They also make great BRAKES for steep downhills.  (Unless you are like Fixit and prefer to RUN down!)
5) If you have to cross a roaring snowmelt creek, with no bridge, you can do it with trek poles!  They make it possible to really lean into the current, and sidestep across.  There is no way you could cross such creeks by just walking across on your feet.  And sometimes if you are not sure of the depth of the water, you can use a trek pole as a feeler to find where the river bottom is, just ahead of you.
6) If you have to cross a steep sidehill snowfield (like on the PCT), trek poles provide a welcome safety feature.  You plant a trek pole firmly into the snow one step ahead of you, then step next to it with the pole on the downhill side of your foot.  Now your foot will NOT slide out from under you and leave you slithering down the hill.  Meanwhile, your other trek pole (on the uphill side) provides something to hang on to.
7) We use them to set up our tent.  No need for separate tent poles!
8) They are available to use as WEAPONS if needed.  There have been several times when Fixit and I have had to face snarling, growling DOGS blocking the trail, while the owners stand by saying sweetly, ""Oh don't worry!  He doesn't bite!"".  Yeah, right!  Our response is to brandish our trek poles at the dogs and tell the ill-mannered owners, ""Get your dog by the collar and get him off the trail.  You should not have brought an out of control, untrained dog onto a public trail!"".  And there have also been several times when a pack of coyotes went close by us in the night, and  we each grabbed a spare trek pole and prepared to defend our food!  And when we have to take public transportation (like Greyhound bus to the CDT) the drivers take one look at our trek poles and will not let us bring them aboard!  They are weapons!  We could hurt somebody!
So bottom line, we love our trek poles, and would not consider hiking without them!

Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632541,"Back in the 1950's, when dinosaurs roamed the earth, I was in elementary school, and what we did then for ""PE class"" was to play singing games.  We played ""London Bridge"" and many others, including one called ""Go In and Out the Window"".  The whole class would stand in a circle, holding hands, then RAISE our arms to form ""windows"".  One kid was selected as ""It"", and while we all sang the ""Go In and Out the Windows"" song, that one kid would run as fast as he could, twisting in and out of the circle, via the ""windows"".  Then there were other verses about other things, like ""Now follow me to London...."" etc.  Well, this last Monday, Feb. 1, Fixit and I did a trail that really felt like that song.  It was the Bolinas Ridge trail out by Point Reyes National Seashore.  The route alternates between OUT the ""windows""--open, grassy ridgetops and ""INside""-- through the forest.  But on Monday, the ""windows"" were quite a challenge.  The wind was howling from the south, so when we headed out in the morning,SOBO, we were headed INTO the teeth of that wind.  Wow, was it cold.  Our high for the day was 53.  Not fun in a strong wind!  Every time we were crossing a ""window"", it felt like pushing against something.  Then we'd reach another belt of forest, and whew!  Out of the wind!   But we could hear it howling in the treetops.  The path was heavily littered with broken bits of branches and twigs.As prep for doing the AT, both of us have upped our packweight some more.  My training pack, which is my old PCT pack, is a bit hard to handle in a big wind.  It has a bit of width to it, and catches the wind like a small sail.  Fixit's training pack has a more slender silhouette, so he has less of a problem with wind than I do.  Rain was in the forecast as a possibility, but we did not bring umbrellas because of the wind.  I had my raingear lashed to the top of the pack, ready to grab if needed. We ate lunch in a sheltered spot beneath a large Douglas Fir (they shed rain and damp so well that the ground underneath them is often dry!)  but it was so cold that I put on all my raingear, trying to stay warm while I ate.  We brought a thermos of hot rooibos tea, and it was very welcome.  On long trails like the PCT and CDT, we often have a hot ""redneck mocha"" at lunch (boiling water, instant coffee and chocolate milk powder).  To my surprise, a very large salamander creature came wandering up right next to me while I was sitting there drinking tea.  Did he think I was part of the forest?  Not sure.  He was about 10 inches long, and very plump.  I had to be careful when I stood up to go, trying not to step on him.The rain began as we headed back NOBO.  But with the south wind, that meant it was coming from BEHIND us--much more comfortable than having it slamming us in the face!  However, the ""windows"" in the trail were tough--rain pouring down, wind slamming us, and the trail itself very lumpy and uneven from being used by horses and cows.  It's not a nice smooth level pathway!  Well, that's OK--I guess a lot of the AT is just as bad or worse.  Fixit and I were talking about how nice it was that we were headed for a warm, dry car and a warm, dry house, not a small, wet tent.  We've had plenty of nights like that, so we know!  Not to worry--it's part of the adventure!You know you're a hiker when....you meet with other hikers and talk GEAR, GEAR, GEAR!",,View Entry,"Feb 05, Fri",0
Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632580,"We've been reading a lot about the famous white blazes that mark the AT, so that in THEORY I guess you could hike the whole trail and not need a map???  I don't think the theory holds up, though, because a lot of the AT journals seem to regularly include a bit about, ""Oops, I ended up hiking a couple of extra miles today because I missed a turn and didn't realize it right away.""  
The PCT is sorta well-marked, but when the trail AND the signposts disappear in the snow, well, you are on your own.  We've experienced that a number of times.  And then the CDT--oh man, in lots of places, there was 1) No visible ""trail""   2) No cairns or posts or markers on trees    3) Mountains all around that all look the same, so you have no landmarks .  On the CDT, we figure we lost at least a couple of weeks worth of hiking time being ""lost"" and trying to get ""found"".
So here is what we have learned about trying to stay FOUND.
1) Non-optional:  Carry a compass and PAPER maps  Never ever try to hike without a REAL compass.  Do not depend on your Guthook,  phone or Garmin ""compass.""  They can fail.  Carry paper maps, for the same reason:  a paper map will never run out of battery (or other malfunction) AND it gives you the BIG picture of where you are.   
On both our PCT hikes, we carried paper maps (they were from the Wilderness Press PCT guidebooks; we literally cut the books apart and carried the maps relevant to the section we were in.)  We also carried a good compass, the kind you can adjust as you travel farther and farther north. (or south, if that's the way you are going!)  WE NEEDED BOTH of those.  Many times we would come to a junction that was not well-marked, and we were not sure which way was the PCT.  Simple solution: look at the map to see what DIRECTION the PCT roote took, then use your compass to determine which of the junction trails is the correct one.
Each morning, I would get out only the map pages we needed for that day.  The rest were stowed in my pack.
2)  Helpful IF you have enough battery:  Guthook 
When we started the CDT, we knew we were in for it when it came to navigation.  We carried our COMPASS, and TWO SETS of maps, known as ""Bear"" (Bear Creek Survey) and ""J-Ley"" (Jonathan Ley).  Both of these were available online, and we downloaded them.  The ""Bear"" maps show the (more or less) ""official"" route of the CDT, complete with waypoints, while ""J-Ley"" showed ALL THE OPTIONS of routes.  The J-Ley maps often looked like a bowl of spaghetti, showing many different ways you could go and giving reasons why you might or might not want to go that way.  We used the J-Ley options on a number of occasions, sometimes very successfully and sometimes disastrously.  
We also had Guthook loaded up on our cellphone.  In theory, the Guthook app would give us our exact location, if we were not sure.
The CDT is pretty much a ""choose your own adventure"" trail.  You CAN stick to the ""official"" route, but few do--most hikers do a lot of improv on the CDT.  So having BOTH sets of maps was very helpful.  And we figured ""with Guthook, too, how can we go wrong?""
Answer:  Easily!   The very first day, fresh out from the Mexican border, we found ourselves completely perplexed as to which way to go.  (We found out later that one of our fellow passengers on the ride to the Crazy Cook monument trailhead managed to get so lost on his first CDT day that he wandered into MEXICO, and had to be rescued!).  So we turned to Guthook.  Voila!  Now we knew where we were, and got back on track.  Then it happened again.  And again.  And again.  And that's when we found out that we could only consult Guthook for 8 times, before our phone ran out of battery and became useless.  So after that, we really, really rationed any ""looking at Guthook.""   
Pretty much every single day on the CDT, there would be several times when we were very perplexed as to which way we should go.  But we always managed to muddle through and find our way again.
3) Very helpful;  Garmin
We had muddled along on the CDT (still losing a lot of time trying to ""stay found"") when we got to the GORGEOUS Wind River Mountains of Wyoming.  Wow!  Our plan was to head straight through with no turning off to resupply as many hikers do, so we were carrying a lot of food.  There's a place in the Winds called the ""Cirque of the Towers"" that we really wanted to see, even though it was off the CDT route.  And wowee, the J-Ley map showed a great shortcut that would take us right to the Cirque and then we could go from there back to the CDT.  Well, that J-Ley route was gorgeous in itself, and we hiked all the way from just after sunrise till lunchtime, on nice trail, till we found ourselves totally boxed in by cliffs, and the trail abruptly ended.  According to the map, we were supposed to continue straight ahead.  No way.  Fixit left his pack with me and made like a mountain goat up that cliff (including snowfield) to the top to reconnoiter.  He came back down and said, ""No go.  I don't think you would make it down the other side.  Too scary.""  So VERY, VERY sadly, we hiked all the way back the way we had come.   A whole day, lost.  And then the very next day, AGAIN, we hiked quite a ways along what we THOUGHT was the CDT.  It was not.  It took hours to get ""found"" again, and then it happened again.  And again.  Our food was running low.  And that's when we said, ""ENOUGH!!  We are getting a GARMIN!""  So we bailed off the trail, went into town and got one. loaded up with waypoints to match the ""Bear"" maps.
After that, we were never ""lost"" again for more than a few minutes, and the Garmin uses very little battery power, so we didn't worry much about it ""dying"" on us.  The younger hikers laughed at us, and called our Garmin ""quaint"" as they navigated with their cellphones, but they had to be constantly worrying about recharging their batteries.  We would rather not deal with that!
FINAL CONCLUSION
A REAL COMPASS (adjustable for declination) and PAPER maps are non-optional, gotta-haves.
If the trail is really tricky (like the CDT) carry a GARMIN.  And every time you stop, CHECK to see where you are, so if you have gotten off track without knowing it, you won't have gone too far.
If you like Guthook (a lot of people do) and don't mind the hassle of having to recharge a phone, Guthook works OK.

Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632606,"For our all-day training hike this week, Fixit and I returned to ""The BIG roller-coaster"", only this time, we came up with a way to add some extra mileage and make it even longer and have bigger ups 'n downs.  Some of it even includes very rooty & rocky going, on a steep hillside.  We figure that at least somewhat replicates the AT, maybe?   But what made things rather different was the SILENCE.  There was NO wind.  No roaring in the treetops.  And not even bluejays cawing or squirrels scolding.  Just....silence.  It was like the forest (we were mostly in forest) was sitting quietly, waiting for something.  We didn't even have wind as we crossed the dam at Kent Lake.  Usually it's quite a wind tunnel there.  The sky was quiet, too--just a sort of opalescent overcast.  When we got up on top of the final ridge, we could see that over by the ocean there was fog, and we thought about how we missed hiking the Coast Trail--it's closed because of the fires there last fall.There were some indications of spring in the forest, though--the leaves are sprouting for wildflowers (buttercups, wild geranium, Douglas iris, and others).  Some of the ferns are starting to leaf out.  The poison oak buds are starting to open.  Willow catkins are swelling.  The redwoods are putting out huge swathes of ""pollen branches"".  Pretty soon there will be pollen blowing on the wind.  Fixit and I remembered our 2005 PCT hike--we stopped for lunch at Timothy Lake, just before you get to Mt. Hood, and the entire lake surface was covered with floating pollen.  Fixit went for a swim while I was making lunch, and when he came out of the water, he was coated with pollen!  Messy, messy.We also met a couple of guys in a ""Sheriff"" truck, and had a very fun conversation with them.  They stopped to ask, ""You guys training for something?""   And it went from there.  One of their buddies, it turns out, thru-hiked the CDT the same year we did.  Unfortunately, we never ran into the guy.  The ""sheriff guys"" asked if we'd run into any fallen trees across the trail.  Yes, we had!  We told them where the tree was, and they said they'd clear it.  THANK YOU!   We hikers really, really appreciate the ""trail gorillas"" who carry equipment into the back country and clear blowdowns.  The CDT trail had some really bad sections of blowdown trees--it was like trying to hike through a giant game of ""Pick Up Stix"".  Even the PCT up in the Glacier Peak Wilderness, in 2010, was often a challenge of HUGE fallen trees across the trail.  So we cheer for anybody who goes out and clears them!You know you're a hiker when.......you're drawing Social Security and still sleeping in a tent!",,View Entry,"Feb 09, Tue",0
Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632652,"If you have ever had to get a wilderness permit, you know about ""The Talk"" the rangers give.  It doesn't matter if this is the zillionth time you've been out in the back country and had to get a permit, you still HAVE TO listen.
The Talk includes all the good info about protecting your food from the bears (and hey, protecting the BEARS from your food!), and how to choose a campsite (200 feet from water, etc.) and a number of other LNT (Leave No Trace) principles.  But eventually they finally do get around to the charming topic of ""How do you go to the bathroom in the woods, when there's no bathroom?"" 
 Well, as hikers say, ""You dig a hole.""  But LNT!!!!  There is nothing more annoying than finding little bunches of used toilet paper out in the bushes and under the rocks.
Fixit and I have learned a few things about this, having hiked around 10,000 miles.  So I thought I'd let folks know what we've figured out.
First of all, guys are different from gals.  So what works for Fixit does not necessarily work for me, and vice-versa.
I'll start with me (ladies first!)  If all I need to do is pee, I do not bother taking off my pack.  I get off the trail, hopefully behind a bush or tree,squat down and pee.  Then what?  I grab a few dry leaves or a rock and wipe off.  I finish with my bandana.  That's it.  No TP.  The bandana gets rinsed out regularly and never ever gets smelly.
If I have to ""dig a hole"", I do have to take off the pack. I take with me our classic orange plastic hiker trowel, and my ""TP bag"" which is a quart ziplok containing a very small roll (the squares have been counted, allowing a max of 4 a day) of TP, and a couple of snack size siploks to hold USED TP.   Of course I scout for a location WAY FAR from any creek, river or lake, and well away from the trail.  Then I look (preferably) for a decent-sized (at least 1 foot diameter, and pretty well ""into"" the dirt)  ROCK I can dislodge, thus creating an ""instant hole.""  Using our classic orange trowel, I enlarge the depth if needed.  If there are no useful rocks, then second best is the loose, compost-y duff right next to a rotten log.  In that case (or worst case scenario, just plain DIRT)  I have to just do the work and dig a hole.  I do my thing, then use small smooth rocks and/or smooth sticks, to get pretty well cleaned up, and FINISH with toilet paper.  I rarely need more than 2 squares a day, because I use only one square at a time, and keep folding & refolding it, to get as much use from each square as possible.  The used squares go into one of the snacksize ziploks, which is then placed inside a quart ziplok.  Usually about 6-7 ""used"" squares will fit in each snack ziplok.  When I get to a garbage can (several days later, usually), I toss out the little ""used TP"" ziploks.
Needless to say, I clean my fingers with alcohol gel afterwards.  And about the orange trowel....we've tried ""NO trowel.""   It sucks!  Digging a hole with sticks, rocks or the tip of your trek pole is seriously tedious.  Then we tried a superlightweight teeny little titanium trowel.  Even though the handle was painted yellow, we still lost it in the woods.  So we gave up and went back to the good ol' orange trowel.  It weighs very little, and you CANNOT lose it!   Also, I found it very useful on the PCT and CDT when I postholed in the snow and needed to dig myself out.  There's nothing like the ""fun"" of being up to your hip in snow, with your foot solidly encased in ice and trapped.  Digging out of that with your hands is pretty awful, but with the little orange trowel, no problem!
At the end of the day, when I'm getting into the sleeping bag, I do a final cleanup with a baby wipe, to be SURE everything is in good shape. And actually, since I usually need to ""dig a hole"" very early in the morning, I usually ""pre-dig"" the hole before I go to bed so it is all ready when I need it (often before dawn).
Now for the guys.  Fixit has filled me in on what he does.  If he needs to pee, he's a guy, and no problem.   If he needs to dig a hole, he does like I do for making the hole, but his philosophy is, ""Who needs TP?""  (Right, Fixit--you've never had to deal with a UTI like we girls get if we are not VERY careful to stay superclean!)  So he says it's a step by step process for him.  First he uses some smooth sticks.  Then he switches to (preferably) a handful of grass he has formed into a ""bunch"".  Or he may use a bunch of leaves.  He actually tries to NOT rip any leaves off a plant, but instead will actually BACK UP to a low-lying plant, and wipe off using its leaves intact, without removing them from the plant.  If needed, he will wet the leaves first with a little bit of water from his water bottle.   That's it!  No TP!
The one thing I am a small bit worried about on the AT is, ""Sounds like there are a LOT of other hikers--how can you find any privacy for digging holes, etc.?""  On the PCT and CDT, we could easily go for whole days or more without seeing another human being.  Maybe we will just have to settle for getting as well off trail as possible, say ""oh well"" and go for it, no matter who may pass by???   I know there are privies at the shelters, but we are not planning to camp at shelters unless we HAVE to.  
So bring an orange trowel, and LEAVE NO TRACE!

Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632744,"When Fixit and I hiked the PCT in 2005 and then did it again in 2010, and did the CDT in 2016, we noticed that our ""trail day"" was different from a lot of the other hikers, especially the younger ones.  A typical day would often involve us PASSING a pack of younger hikers early in the morning, while they were still asleep.  Then later on, they'd pass us, and we would not see them again till we passed them early the next morning.  We started calling it ""leapfrogging.""  Some of the younger guys were incredulous at the fact we were keeping up with them.  ""What?  You again?"" was a greeting we heard more than once.So here's what a typical trail day is like for us!Rise 'n shine is typically at about 5:15 when we are starting the trail in late April.  If we are still on the trail in September, it's too dark to get up that early, so we bump it to 5:30 or maybe a bit later.  We get dressed, pack up, do an ""idiot check"" for items that somehow got missed in the packup, shoulder packs, and then before we start, we pray.  We thank God that He is with us, we ask Him to walk beside us, keep us safe, and help us to be a blessing to other people we meet.  So if you see us early in the morning, holding hands and heads bowed, that's what we are doing.Hit the trail.  Typically we are off by 6:00 am.  I hear that on the AT, this may destine us to be ""web-walkers"", busting through the overnight spiderwebs that have been made across the trail.  Hmmm, that means Fixit DEFINITELY gets to go FIRST!  We hike along enjoying the beautiful early morning light, birdsongs, etcBreakfast  After an hour or so of hiking, we start looking for a comfortable, sunny spot (preferably with a view) to stop and eat breakfast.  We do NOT like breakfast in the cold, if we can avoid it!  We take a half hour for this, so by 7:30 we are back to hiking.Midmorning snack  At around 9:30 or so, we stop, roll out our Z-Rests and lie down for 15 minutes to rest and eat a snack (usually Snickers). We try to put our feet up a bit for this (by just draping legs over packs).  We might rinse socks if there is water around.Lunch  A bit before noon, I am on the lookout for a good lunch spot--in the shade if it's hot, or sun if it's cold.  We really like to have a good view if we can get one.  Lunch is a 1-hour break.  I work on cooking the FOOD while Fixit takes out our sleeping bags and finds a good sunny bush or rock to lay them on so they can air.  He will keep turning them every few minutes so all sides get ""sunned.""  If there is water around, we can rinse socks and rinse ourselves as well.  We eat lunch, wash up the pot and cups, and then lie down for a 10 minute rest.  We have learned that this is a good idea because we are older and NEED it!Midafternoon snack  This is a rerun of the morning, and typically around 3:30 pm.Dinner  Around 5:30, I start looking for a nice ""dinner spot.""  We take a half hour to eat our cold dinner (the kind of stuff most people eat for lunch).  I find that this break is really energizing when my tail was starting to drag late in the day.  Back to hiking  Then we head back onto the trail and hike for another hour, enjoying the beautiful evening sky and light.Done for the day  At 7:00 pm, we start looking for a possible place to stop and camp.  All we ask is ""reasonably flat, and preferably under trees.""  We avoid being near water or other campers, if we can.  If we are in really rugged terrain, I will have already been studying the topo lines to see if I can spot something up ahead, and we might stop a little early or a little late if necessary in order to have a camping spot.  Sometimes camping near others is unavoidable, like in the North Cascades in Washington on the PCT--there are so few places that are campable, that we will happily share any spot we find with other hikers, and they also share with us.  We set up our tarp or tent, OR just roll out the ground cloth and set up a cowboy camp.  Using our water bottles and tiny scrap of ""hiker towel"", we clean up our legs and feet.  Then it's time to put on the silk longjohns and go to bed!  We don't do campfires, we don't ""hang out.""  We just CRASH.  Well, actually, Fixit crashes.  I'm one of those annoying people who always looks at the END of a new book so I can see what happens, so I curl up in my sleeping bag and get out the maps, guidebook pages, etc. for the next day, and start planning.  Where should we stop and get water?  What challenges lie ahead?  What points of interest are there?  I like to know.  Fixit is a ""Mr. Improv"" and he likes to just see what the trail brings, without fussing over such things.  I also get out a pen and write up my PHOTO journal for the day, and my STORY journal.  Yes, a pen on paper! That's where I'm at.  Last but not least, it's time for us to read the Bible for awhile and pray for people we've met that day and things that have happened, and any problems we may be facing.  Then it's ""Goodbye, cruel world!  See you tomorrow!""So the reason we end up keeping up with younger, faster hikers is simple.  We start earlier and finish later! And inbetween, we take on the challenges, the beauties, the joys and sorrows of life on the trail.  The trail becomes ""home"" and we are so glad to be there!You know you're a hiker when.....you take your kid backpacking with you, on their own feet with their own little pack, when they are THREE!",,View Entry,"Feb 21, Sun",0
Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632807,"Fixit and I live in Sonoma County, California, where we are blessed to have a zillion great options for hiking, and weather that allows us to be outside year-round (no blizzards, no hurricanes!).  But overall, one of our favorite hiking destinations is Point Reyes National Seashore and the other ridges nearby. When the ""covid thing"" happened last year, the NPS immediately shut down the whole area.  If we had dared to hike, we would have faced a hefty fine.  This continued for quite a long time before the closure was lifted....just in time for a very unusual event where we had storms with lightning for two days in a row, and the lightning started many fires, including at Point Reyes.  Bam!  The National Seashore was closed AGAIN.  And instead of nice winter rains finishing off the fires, we've had a drought, and the fires continued to smolder.  So for many, many months, we have not been able to go hiking except in limited parts of the park.But hooray!  Things are looking up!  This last Monday (Feb. 22) we parked our car at Bear Valley, which is our favorite ""beginning spot"" for many hikes.  Even with the very scanty rains, the grass is now intensely green (though very short), and the trees are shining with new growth and buds and baby leaves opening.  Just up the hill is the Morgan Horse Ranch, where they raise and train Morgan horses for the use of park rangers all over the West.  Morgans are awesome horses--not very big, but really smart and really strong, and not easily spooked.  If you meet a ranger riding a horse, it's probably a Morgan.  It's fun to walk by their ""training center"" where they have a sort of ""trail obstacle course"" for the Morgans to practice on.Normally we would have a choice of 4 trails that head out from Bear Valley, but the fire damage has closed 3 of them.  No problem!  We put on our training packs (still getting slowly heavier) and headed out on the Rift Zone trail, which basically follows the famous San Andreas Fault.  It's a gently rolling trail through meadows, forests and even some swampy areas.  We walk through a huge pasture that's on land owned by a Zen Buddhist retreat center, and the pasture is full of very mellow, friendly Angus cows, calves, and sometimes, bulls.  We still are not sure why Zens would own a whole herd of MEAT cattle???  But maybe they lease the pasture and make money that way???  Then we took the meandering Stewart Trail up to Fir Top, which at 1,324 feet is the highest point in the southern part of the park, and continued on down the other side before stopping for lunch in a little meadow.  The grass was short, but it was green, so before we headed back, we checked for ticks.  Around here, the motto is, ""When the grass is GREEN, the ticks are SEEN.  When the grass is BROWN, the ticks go DOWN"", because in spring, when the grass is green, the ticks are very active (we've been ""ticked"" many times in springtime, so we've learned to be cautious), but in summer and fall and winter when the grass is brown, the ticks are not a problem.I was very happy to see our FIRST spring wildflowers, which around here are the ""Milkmaids""--dainty little white flowers that like partly shady areas.  The bracken ferns have really leafed out, and the sword ferns are just barely starting their first ""fiddleheads.""  And as a great finish to the day, we arrived back at Bear Valley at the same time as a ranger lady riding one of the Morgan horses!Back at home that night, I continued my very careful study of the 2021 AT Hker's Companion, to make sure that all the resupply options we'd planned for last year are still available.  So far, so good.  Our living room is now lined with 9 boxes and 10 large envelopes, being readied to go.  The supplies we ordered are arriving daily.  Our airline we are flying with to reach Atlanta just emailed us with a change of schedule for our flight from San Francisco, along with profuse apologies for having to make the change.  It means getting to Atlanta about an hour later than we'd planned on, but we can live with that.  Wow, it will be good to finally just get to the trail and start hiking!You know you're a hiker when....you start to drool over the package of backpacking meals that just landed on your porch!",,View Entry,"Feb 26, Fri",0
Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632839,"When I am with other women, and they find out that I LIKE to do thruhiking, almost invariably I get the question, ""But....aren't you scared of bears?""  One time we were car camping in Yosemite Valley (a bear magnet if there ever was one!) One of our kids and I had gone to a ranger campfire program, and were now walking back in the dark, on a path next to a road, when up ahead there appeared a BEAR!  It was minding its own business, and crossing the road.  But our kid squeaked, ""Bear!"" and grabbed me around the legs in a death grip.  ""Honey,"" I said, ""let go of me!  If the bear comes this way, how can I do anything with you wrapped around my legs?""  My words of wisdom had no effect, and instead the death grip grew stronger.  So I just waited till the bear finished crossing and disappeared into the woods.  I was finally able to persuade our kid that the coast was clear.  Several years later, Fixit and I and another one of our kids were car camping at Lake Tahoe (another bear magnet!). I had stayed up way late the night before getting everything ready for the trip, loading the car, etc. and I was tiiiiiiiired.  So I decided to take a nap while Fixit and our kid went for a walk.  About 30 minutes later, I heard an odd sound over by our campsite picnic table.  I sat up to have a look, and through the door of our tent, I saw a bear, only a few feet from me.  He had easily popped open our little ""lunch size"" cooler and was going through it.  He took a pass on the bags of frozen veges, but happily munched up the cheese, wrapper and all, while I watched helplessly.  I had always been told never to interfere if a bear has got your food, and I was surprised to find the bear OUT in the middle of the day.  I'd thought they only came out at night.  The bear next took the little flask of ""Butter Buds"", bit the end off, and was slurping up the liquid butter, when a very loud yell interrupted his pleasure.  It was the camp host!  He leaped from his vehicle and charged that bear, yelling his head off.  The bear quickly got to its feet and ran off, still sucking on the flask of Butter Buds.  I came out of the tent and thanked the camp host!  He said, ""Ma'am, you should NOT let a bear get away with that.  If a bear tries to get at your food, or makes any kind of trouble, you need to act like an ALPHA bear and show him who's boss.  Alpha bears don't let ""lower"" bears come near them, or infringe on their personal territory.""  I said, ""Oh!  OK.""  The next day, I had a chance to take his advice.  Our daughter and I were on a hike (Fixit had gone off to do a bigger challenge, climbing a nearby mountain).  We were walking along the trail, when up ahead, a large bear rambled onto the trail and just stood there, blocking our path.  I said, ""OK, time to act like an ALPHA bear!"" and the kid and I marched straight at the bear, while acting very angry and indignant and yelling, ""Hey!  Get offa MY trail!  Move!""   And guess what?  The bear moved.  Acting quite disgusted, he slowly moved out of the way, and the kid and I went marching by.  Yahoo!Ever since then, when I see a bear in a campground, or someplace else he has no business being, I run him off, stomping and yelling and acting angry.  I've met several USFS rangers who confirmed that one of the big problems with many hikers and backpackers is that by NOT acting like Alpha bears, they are ""training"" bears to disrespect humans.  One ranger said, ""Don't ever take a picture of a bear if the bear knows you are there.  If a bear sees you just standing there, apparently helplessly, with camera in hand as you take the picture, he will disrespect you.  So only take pics if the bear hasn't seen you yet.  Once he sees you, go into Alpha mode.""Having said that, I do NOT go out of my way to meet bears!  That's why Fixit and I avoid camping near water, or any ""popular"" places.  And we do hang our food, using the ""PCT Bear Hang"" technique, if we have any reason to think that there might be bears around.  From what I hear, the AT has plenty of bears, so I guess we'll be hanging our food a LOT.The other ""big critters"" we've encountered include mountain lions, bobcats, deer, elk, moose and coyotes/wolves.  I haven't personally MET a mountain lion, but sure have seen their tracks!  Bobcats are not exactly the world's brightest lightbulb, and we've often seen them before they even noticed us.  Deer--a buck ran off with a PCT thruhiker's trek pole, chewing on the handle as he ran (wanting salt from the hiker's sweaty hands).  That thruhiker was promptly named, ""Buck Larceny"" and Fixit and I realized we'd better be protective of OUR trek poles and not just leave them leaning against a tree at night.  We keep them right next to us!  Coyotes, we've seen (and HEARD) many times.  They don't worry us much, but we grab our food and keep it close to us if they are around.  Elk don't want to be anywhere near us.  The joke is, ""Elk have cloaking devices so no one can see them!""  But wow, do they leave a mess. A herd of elk will really tear up the trail if they use it.  Moose--we try to keep a tree between us and a moose.  We hear they are grumpy.  But for such a large, ungainly-looking animal, watching them ""float"" by as they jog along is really amazing.On the AT, we figure we will see some bears, and deer, and moose.  Not sure about mountain lions or coyotes.  I have not noticed any AT hikers mentioning those!  We will see!You know you're a hiker when......you have a little bitty thermometer hanging off your pack, so you have bragging rights on how COLD or how HOT it was!",,View Entry,"Feb 28, Sun",0
Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632972,"Fixit and I did an 8 plus hour training hike this last Monday (March 1) and headed for as many hills and rocks as we could find, which basically around here means going to Annadel State Park near Santa Rosa.  We go there often because it's near to home and many of the trails are really rough. We know which ones are the worst, and head straight for them!  But Annadel is beautiful, too, with forests, meadows, views, lakes....what more could you want?Spring has truly ""sprung"" even though it isn't March 20 yet.  I was walking along laughing to myself because I suddenly realized that the early spring wildflowers were being very patriotic--the WHITE ""milkmaids"", lovely BLUE wild forget-me-nots (otherwise known as ""hound's tongue"" because of the shape of their leaves, but I don't like that name!) and then what really got me laughing was the RED!  The red wasn't a flower, actually, but there was plenty of it--the tiny baby first leaves of the poison oak are a lovely shade of RED!  So in the forest (these are all shade-loving plants) there was RED, WHITE and BLUE! Out in the sun, there were the pink ""shooting stars"", but they like sun, not shade.  I'm always glad to see them.All the flowers, grass  and plants are growing short and stubby, though.  We are way far behind on rain.  BUT when we walked by one of the seasonal creeks which right now would normally be rushing nicely, it was just trickling from shallow pool to shallow pool, and wahoo!  I got my first MOSQUITO BITE of the spring!  OK, that makes it official--spring has really sprung, because the mosquitoes are hatching.  The little rascal got me on my knuckles and I didn't swat him in time, so I had to hike and itch.Fixit is very nimble on rough n' rocky trail, so he spent a lot of time getting way ahead of me and then stopping to wait.  On dirt trail I can easily go at 3 mph or even faster, but on rocks, I slow way down.  I have had too many falls on rocks when I try to keep up with Fixit, and I've had to live with the damage from some of those falls ever since, so I am now much more cautious than I used to be. As we hike the rocky trails at Annadel, we wonder, ""Will the AT be as bad as this?""  Well, we will see!But when I got home, I found ANOTHER harbinger of spring--a TICK! The rascal had just begun to ""dig in"" on the back of my leg (they love BACKS of things--at least it wasn't the back of my head!).  I was able to get him off easily, but it meant ANOTHER itchy spot.  This time of year, when we get home from a hike, we check ourselves all over for ticks, which is how I found him.  You just run your fingers over your skin, feeling for the roughness of a tick starting to ""dig in.""  I immediately went to warn Fixit that he'd better do a tick check on himself.  He lucked out.  No ticks on him.  Usually, HE is the tick magnet, and I am the mosquito magnet.  Today I got both and he got nothing.  Grrrrrr.  But it is nice to know spring is truly here!You know you're a hiker when......your food scale is for weighing gear, not food!",,View Entry,"Mar 05, Fri",0

That's because keeping MICE out of your backpacking stuff is WAY HARDER than keeping bears out!  We often hang our food out of MOUSE reach, rather than BEAR reach, because on numerous occasions, we've picked up a food bag that was sitting on the ground overnight and a mouse popped out!  We can tell you what mice like to eat, based on the holes we've found in our food bags.  They LOVE granola, and they LOVE trail mix!  Little rascals! 
There are lots and lots of other little creeping and crawling critters out there that we hikers have to deal with.  In the High Sierra, there were the marmots!  They look sort of like fat cats, and there are a lot of them.  At one lunch break near Evolution Lake on the PCT, Fixit and I literally had to sit back-to-back because the marmots were closing in on us from all sides, and they were after our food.  We dared not turn our backs on them, and had to keep throwing rocks at them while we ate, to keep them back.  If we had left our packs unattended, they would have been INTO them.
Up in Washington State on the PCT, there were totally CUTE little furry guys called pikas.  They didn't bother us, except for one thing--they are LOUD.  They have this ear-shattering ""MEEP"" sound they like to make.  One time we had stopped for a rest, and the pikas started in with their meeping.

But then...there are the CRAWLING critters--snakes!  Here in CA, we have only 2 kinds of poisonous snakes--the rattler and the coral snake.  Coral snakes are very shy and scarce, so we don't worry about them, except to occasionally remind ourselves of the rhyme, ""Red and black, friend of Jack; Red and yellow, kill a fellow.""  We have seen King snakes (the ""Red & Black""), but they are not poisonous.  The rattlesnakes are much more common, but we call them the ""Gentlemen of the Trail"" because they are so polite about ""buzzing"" you to let you know you're getting too close for comfort (THEIRS, as well as yours!).  Once we were on the PCT in southern California, and were confronted with a huge rattler all coiled up in the trail.  He was not interested in moving.  And I do NOT charge at rattlers like I would at a bear!  So we had to detour around him.  Another time, we were in Deep Creek Canyon on the PCT, where the trail goes very precariously along the side of the canyon, when we were met by a BABY rattlesnake in the middle of the trail.  It was so cute!  It did its very best to buzz with its tiny little tail, and when we did not move, it tried to frantically flee in blind fright and ended up plunging over the edge to the river far below.  We said, ""Oh no! Poor little guy!""
But most of the time, we HEAR the rattlers rather than see them.  In late summer, the grasshoppers flying actually sound like a rattler buzz, and we'll do a fair amount of ""leaping away"" only to groan, ""Oh bother--it was a grasshopper!""And then there are....ANTS!  When Fixit and I are deciding on a campsite, one of the first things we check is the ""ant situation.""  Are there ant holes nearby?  Are there a fair number of the little guys running around?  If there are, we pick another campsite!  Our worst ever ant experience was actually in Colorado on the CDT.  We thought we had found a nice place to camp, but when we started to set up our tent, it was like the ants just converged on us, and they were MEAN!  They seriously started attacking and biting us!  We very quickly got away, but in our haste, we actually lost one of our tent stakes (fortunately we had a couple of spares).  So ants are definitely one of the creeping critters we are NOT fond of!
In the deserts of California and New Mexico, the other crawling/creeping critters we DON'T like to meet are the scorpions.  They come out at night, and they are not very big, but they are nasty.  Fixit and I were cowboy camped one night, and I had my headlamp on, because I was writing in my journal, when a scorpion came creeping up to me.  Apparently he was attracted by the light????  So I did a very girly thing.  Fixit was already half asleep and I woke him up and said, ""There's a scorpion!  Can you knock him away?""  My theory was, ""Fixit is stronger then I am.  If HE knocks the scorpion flying, it will go farther than if I knock it flying!"".  So Fixit gave the scorpion a mighty WHACK! and it went flying and didn't come back.  But I did quickly turn off my headlamp!
OK, so snakes on the AT-- sounds like there are a lot of them!  Several different kinds of rattlesnakes??  Yikes!  And other nasty ones, too?    Well, I guess we just have to be careful.
And the Dread Gray Mouse on the AT sounds like its cousins out here in the West.  I hear they are serious pests in the shelters, which is yet another reason why we want to avoid shelters.  The ATC recently sent us a very pathetic little email about ""Oh dear, with covid around, it would be better if you DON'T camp at the shelters.""  They then followed this with lengthy advice on how to camp in the woods!  Fixit and I laughed and laughed!  Out here in the West, there are NO shelters, and ""camping in the woods"" is all we ever do!  And ""out in the woods"" far from commonly used camping areas, there are far less of the Dread Gray Mouse!

Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633147,"One of our favorite places to go hiking here in Sonoma County is to go out to ""Jack London's place""--the home and farm he made for himself.  When I was a kid, I loved reading his stuff!  The cottage where he lived with his wife, Charmian, is still there, as well as many of his barns and buildings.....and the ruins of the Wolf House.  There is also the House of Happy Walls, where Charmian lived after Jack died.From a hiker point of view, ""Jack London's Place"" is great!  There are plenty of long, long climbs and awesome views and a variety of forests, plus all the history that surrounds the place.  The trail we took heads for the summit of Sonoma Mountain, and it's the very same trail Jack himself used to ride.  The morning of the terrible 1906 earthquake, Jack rode up to the summit and watched the smoke from San Francisco, where his dream of a voyage round the world was temporarily put on hold because his boat burned up in the fire.  As we hiked up the mountain, I wondered what was going through Jack's mind on that April morning in 1906.  It was a very cold March morning for us (53 degrees) and before lunch, it started to rain.  We ""fired up"" our umbrellas and kept on going.  The place we were aiming at for lunch is actually outside Jack London's Place, in the Sonoma Mountain North Ridge open space.  We were hoping to go to the Umbrella Tree, which has a very panoramic view, from up high on the end of the ridge, but the wind was pretty bad, the rain was coming down, and it was really cold, so we backed off and headed down to a grove of redwoods near a creek, out of the wind, and actually so well-sheltered by the trees that we hardly needed umbrellas.  There was even a picnic table with a plaque that read in part, ""When we hike hand-in-hand, the world becomes a wonderland"".  Amen to that!  Fixit and I feel so blessed that we BOTH like to hike and we BOTH like to do long hikes!  Jack and Charmian London were also a pair who really enjoyed doing adventures TOGETHER!On our way back to the car, we stopped off to visit ""The Cottage""--Jack and Charmian's home while the Wolf House was being built.  It's also where Jack died.  A group of very dedicated volunteers do a fantastic job of taking care of the place and maintaining the garden.  The Cottage was closed (due to covid rules) but I still like to walk around the place.  I was hoping to go over and visit the House of Happy Walls as well, but we ran out of time--the park closes and the gates are locked at 5 pm.I thought about Charmian's name for her final home.  ""The House of Happy Walls"".  Considering all that she went through, that was a very upbeat choice of name, and it reminded me of how Fixit and I are involved in running a Bible club for kids, called Awana, and just two days before we did our hike out at ""Jack London's Place"", we held a big ""Bible Quiz"" event for the kids.  I had to recruit a lot of volunteers to help do the event, and afterwards, many of the volunteers said, ""Wow, this MADE my day!  The kids were so JOYFUL!  It was amazing to listen to them recite the Bible verses they memorized, and they were so HAPPY!""  One of the verses that really meant a lot to the kids this difficult year was Psalm 46:1, ""The Lord is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.""  Instead of just moping around at home, the kids had something to LIVE for, and they had JOY!  One of the cool things for us about doing long hikes is that we then come back with lots of ""trail tales"" to tell the kids!  They love it!  You know you're a hiker when.....you are OK with not showering for a whole week (or maybe more!)",,View Entry,"Mar 11, Thu",0
Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633263,"OK, so I hear that the motto of the AT is ""No rain, no pain, no Maine.""  Well, pain is generally a part of every thruhike, but I guess there are more opportunities for it on the AT.  Way back in dinosaur days, when fire lookouts were actually MANNED (or WOMANNED), Fixit and I were backpacking in Lassen National Park.  We spotted a fire lookout tower just outside the park and decided it would be fun to go have a look at it.  Turned out it was a ""womanned"" lookout, and the gal who was there invited us up and showed us the ropes of what she did (though still maintaining her vigilance!).  She told us how she had also worked in fire towers ""back east, by the Appalachian Trail.""  And she said, ""That is one TOUGH trail!  Most of the people who quit, well, they quit because they are HURTING.  It's really tough on knees.""  Fixit and I filed that away under ""reasons to NOT bother doing the AT.""  But we still were thinking about thruhiking the PCT (which runs right through Lassen NP), and indeed we did--TWICE, once in 2005 and again in 2010.  Then we did the CDT in 2016.  Now we have Triple Crown fever and are crazy enough (at ages 81 and 73) to tackle the AT!
On the PCT, we often encountered PAIN. My very first night on the PCT in 2005, my feet were literally throbbing and hurting so badly that it was hard to sleep.  And not just feet--you name it, any part of your body, almost, would take turns hurting.  We found ways to fix all of them.  Sometimes those ways were provided by fellow hikers.  For example, in 2005, by the time we were 100 miles into the trail, my right knee, which years before had a bad infection inside the knee, was really hurting.  I was starting to wonder if I could continue.  I mentioned this to one of the other thruhiker gals, and she said, ""Oh, your knee hurts?  No problem--I'll loan you one of my patella straps.  That will fix you up till we get to Big Bear City, and then you can buy your own.""  I had never heard of a patella strap, but wow!  It WORKED!  No more hurting knee!  
Sometimes we just figure it out ourselves, WHY something hurts.  In 2010, we were about 400 miles into the trail, and one of my feet started to just ache and hurt on TOP.  It was bad.  I thought and thought about it, and finally concluded it was the way I was tying the laces of my shoes.  Some rearranging on the shoelaces, and I was fine.  Another time, it was my shoulders that hurt.  We had covered 2,000 miles at that point and I was mystified as to WHY my shoulders, which I thought should be totally toughened up by oow, would be so sore.  I thought and thought about it, and realized, ""Duh!  It's because I've lost so much weight that my pack waist belt is loose, and the pack is just HANGING off my shoulders instead of transferring the weight to the hip.""  But I couldn't tighten the belt anymore--it was already tightened to the max.  So the next time we went in for a resupply, I went to a thrift store and got an old sweatshirt, cut a hunk off it, and tied that around my waist to make my waist ""fatter.""  Then the pack belt fitted again, and instantly, no more sore shoulders!
But sometimes the pain relief came in answer to prayer.  We were on the PCT in 2010, and had gone through the High Sierra in a big snow ye and we had gone straight through from Kennedy Meadows all the way to Vermilion Valley, a 9-day hike, carrying packs that were awfully heavy with a bear can, ice axe, 9 days of food, microspikes, etc, not to mention the really tough going, the postholing, the scary river crossings, etc. By the time we finally reached Donner Lake and a trail angel's house, I was so exhausted that all I could do was just lie down.  The house was perched on a hillside, so there were lots of stairs to do, and when I was headed DOWN the stairs on the day we were there, I felt a really nasty pain on the right side of my lower back, at the back side of the hip.  It was brief, but I should have paid attention to it, because by a couple of days later, it had become horrendous pain every time I was walking DOWNhill.  Uphills and level trail, no problem.  But downhills were agony.  I was in despair.  I had only a few Motrin with me, no where near enough to get me all the way to the next resupply.  But I remembered that the Bible says when we are in trouble, to CRY OUT to the Lord, and He WILL hear.  So I did.  I kept walking, and I literally cried out, ""God, please, either show me how to fix this pain or send me some Motrin!""  We were out in the middle of nowhere, so things didn't look too hopeful.  But 15 minutes later, we met a PCT SOBO!  I stopped and asked him, ""Could I buy some Motrin from you?  I don't have enough and I'm really hurting.""  He took off his pack, and it turned out he was virtually carrying a pharmacy!  Not only did he have Motrin, but he had stronger stuff, too.  So I took a supply of Motrin, accepted just two of the stronger ones (though he urged me to take more) and when I asked him ""How much for this?"" he said, ""Pass it on!""  I knew what he meant--that's so common among hikers, when we help someone else by giving them something, we just say ""Pass it on!""--the idea is that when THEY get an opportunity to help someone else, they WILL.  
So I went on my way, thanking God for sending the guy at just the right time!  And eventually that awful pain did disappear and I was fine.  I think it must have been due to the strain of carrying a heavy pack through such tough conditions.
In 2005, on the PCT,  Fixit also had to deal with the pain of plantar fasciitis, but he solved that one by getting a night splint to wear on his foot, and he was fine after that.  And we both have had to deal with the pain of scrapes and bruises from falls.  Fixit bloodied himself pretty badly in 2010 while trying to cross a creek up in Washington State.  I ford creeks; he prefers to rockhop, and I had walked right across the creek and was headed up the trail, while Fixit looked for a way to rockhop.  Suddenly I heard an agonized yell behind me from poor Fixit--he'd slipped and fallen and was all scraped up and bloody.  I helped him out of the creek and we assessed the damage--nothing broken, but some really bloody nasty scrapes on his legs.  We bandaged him as best we could, and at the next resupply, I spent quite awhile mending his torn pants.
So yeah, we know about pain.  But the AT looks like it will have a lot more pain opportunities than either the PCT or the CDT.  I am bringing my patella straps (even though I have not needed them for a long time) and I will make sure I have enough Motrin, even though I avoid taking the stuff if I possibly can, because it really isn't good for you.  We figure our knees will probably take the brunt of the pain we run into.  But like the saying goes, ""No rain, no pain, no Maine!""

Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633454,"Fixit and I went for our usual all-day Monday training hike, but man, all we can say is, ""What happened to Spring?""  Much of the day it was only 48-50 degrees, with a strong wind that made it feel a lot colder.  The higher mountaintops around here are all dusted with white.  The chilly temperatures don't seem to stop the first of the California poppies from blooming, though!  They were nodding cheerfully in the wind that was making us shiver.Back in February and even in January, we had some days in the upper 70's and wondered, ""Where'd the Winter go?""  Now we have the same question about Spring.  We have a friend who is going to start a PCT thruhike on March 29 (he got stuck with such a ridiculously early date because of the ""no more than 50 hikers start per day"" quota system) and he is looking at dealing with lots of snow right from the start.  Crazy!  The hike Fixit and I did on Monday was what we now call our ""killer"" hike, otherwise known as ""The BIg Rollercoaster"" because it's the route with BIG climbs and descents, with some rootyrocky stuff too.  We figure on doing this hike a couple more times before we leave for the AT.  When we first started doing it, by the time we got back to the car, we were just DONE, totally worn out.  But now, hooray, we feel fine and no more feeling like we just want  to just go home and collapse.  We can roll right up the big climbs.  Fixit is still WAY faster than me on any descent and way WAY faster on rockyrooty, but overall, things went really well.The hardest part of the whole day was lunch.  The spot where we usually eat is out in the open, with awesome views, but exposed to the full blast of the wind.  Monday's bitter cold made eating there out of the question.  So instead, we hunkered down on the lee side of a nearby large rock.  Even there, wind gusts will still occasionally get through, so I resorted to my thruhiker technique of wearing my RAINGEAR, just to stay warm.  On the PCT there were some places where I wore my raingear all day to protect myself from cold wind.  In this case, I just needed it for when I was SITTING.  We were looking at very long-range weather forecasts for the AT, for this summer, and it sounds like they are expecting ""normal"" summer temperatures.  Well, that's better than ABOVE normal, but I think we are in for a big learning curve when it comes to dealing with heat PLUS humidity.  We are used to DRY heat.Our 9 resupply boxes are starting to fill up.  Today (Friday March 18) I finished up all the ""dinner prep""--50 freezedried dinners (which we bought from LDP Camping Foods) are now each accompanied by home-grown, home-dried veges, and loaded into their respective boxes. We figure on buying other ""dinners"" as we hike along (like pizza, which tastes great cold, or burritos, etc.).  Yum!You know you're a hiker when......your kitchen counters are covered with little baggies of dried food, and rows & piles of different ""bars""!",,View Entry,"Mar 18, Thu",0
Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633572,"When I'm reading hiker blogs and journals, I usually shy away from the ones where the hiker is agonizing over their feelings about the hike or about their various personal miseries.  I like it better when they talk about what the trail was like, or how their gear worked, or stuff that happened.  But today I'm going to veer into ""feelings""--specifically how I've learned to handle fear and courage as my hiking partners.  I say MY hiking partners, because Fixit and I are certainly hiking partners, but I don't think he hikes alongside fear very often.  I used to hike with fear, but that has really changed.  I will never forget hiking the PCT in 2010, heading towards Forester Pass, when we met a young couple, obviously thru-hikers, who were heading southbound.  I was surprised to see SOBO's so early, and asked if they were PCT hikers, when I got a terse response that, yes, they were PCT thruhikers, and they had tried to go up Forester, but the wife was so terrified by the ""Chute of Death"" and the steep, scary snow, that she said she could not go on, and they were headed back.  Oh no!  That sounded rather concerning, but when we got there a little while later, I had no problem.  If I had run into that situation several years previous, I would have been really scared, just like that young wife.The reason I was able to face the Chute of Death (and later on, the Knife Edge up in Washington State), the scary whitewater river crossings, etc., was because of an experience I'd had a couple of years before, on my firstever climb of Mt. Whitney.  It was as a result of that experience that I learned to hike with COURAGE instead of hiking with FEAR.Fixit had gotten into hiking the John Muir Trail every year, and each time trying to improve his personal time for doing the whole thing.  (For those of you who may wonder, he does the whole JMT in 8 days.  Most people take 14-21 days!).  I did not want to hike that fast, so I used to just drop him off at the trailhead.  But then I started thinking, ""Wait!  I could hike with him to the top of Whitney, and then he can take off on the JMT, and I go back to the car.""  (The car was about 1 1/2 days hike away).  So dark and early on a chilly late June morning, I was putting on my ""water & snack pack""  (leaving my regular pack at our ""Whitney base camp"") and looking forward to the summit.  Fixit had already left--he was on a tear to get to the top ASAP so he could start his JMT hike.  The night before, I had asked him, ""What's the trail like up Whitney?""  He said, ""Oh, no problem, it's just trail.  You just walk it.""  Well, that is true.  But he forgot to mention, ""Oh, and by the way, there are THREE places where you have to walk right close by a dropoff edge that goes straight down for a mile.""  So I happily climbed up the long, long switchbacks from Guitar Lake, reached the junction with the trail to the summit, and walked along thinking, ""Other than a bit rocky, this is great!""  Then I came to the first of what are called the Whitney Windows.  And yes, all along the east edge of the trail, for about 20 or 30 feet, it's STRAIGHT DOWN for over a mile!  And no way to veer off to the west--that's a very steep jumble of rocks.  I could not believe my eyes.  At the time, I was in total terror of heights.  I stopped.  I shook with fear.  I sat down and felt miserable.  How could I ever get past that?  It did not help that other hikers were breezing on by and saying things like, ""Wow, look at the view!""  Finally I gritted my teeth and dragged myself across the ""window"", shaking and trembling.  Whew.  But then it happened AGAIN.  Again I dragged myself across.  But at the THIRD ""window"" I was just completely out of determination.  This time I sat down and almost cried.  I could not face that dropoff.  But as I sat and shook, I finally prayed, ""Oh Lord, please help me!""  And only a minute later, along came a guy, coming down from the summit.  He took one look at me and said, ""Are you OK? ""  I told him how I felt, and he said, ""Oh, you know what?  This is the LAST one of those dropoffs.  After this you will be fine.""  Those words gave me hope, and I thanked God for sending the guy, got to my feel and scuttled past the dropoff, then on up top, where I had a great time!  The Whitney summit is just amazing!But I knew I had to face the return.  So I stood on top of Mt. Whitney, and I prayed.  I said, ""God, You know I'm scared.  Please help me get down.""  And when I got back to the ""window"", I thought, ""Now what?  God, what do I do?""  And I had a thought, ""LOOK at it.  LOOK at the dropoff.""  did not want to do that!  But I made myself do it.  I stood and LOOKED at the fearsome dropoff instead of scuttling by it in terror.  And then I walked past it, stopped, and LOOKED at it again.  And what I discovered to my amazement, was that the fear was melting away.  I did the same with the next ""window"".  And by the time I reached the last window, I could look right at that dropoff, and just walk along next to it, and say, ""Wow, what a view!""I practically floated back down all the long switchbacks to where I'd left my regular pack, and had a fantastic and joyful hike back to the car, including a wonderful campsite I found with an awesome view.  And ever since then, though I certainly respect big dropoffs, I am no longer terrorized by them.  I've learned that when fear comes along and wants to hike with me, I need to turn to God, listen to Him, and He has a great way of providing COURAGE to be my hiking buddy instead of the fear.Now if Fixit were writing this journal entry, he wouldn't be writing about fear.  He'd probably write about, ""OK, guys, here's how you handle it when your wife/girlfriend gets scared!""  But I am very grateful to the ULTIMATE hiking buddy ever, which is to have God Himself walking with me, showing me HOW to have courage.  Yup, I am still way slower than Fixit on tricky steep trail, but not out of fear, it's because I'm klutzy and I need more time to figure out how to get through without going ""splot"".From what I hear about the AT, I guess there will be lots of opportunities to practice walking (or rock scrambling!) with courage, not with fear!You know you're a hiker when.....you get all excited because it's a CLEAN sock day!  ",,View Entry,"Mar 21, Sun",0
Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633797,"One of our kids was a US Marine, and while she was in boot camp at Parris Island, FL, a hurricane blew through.  The ""hatches were battened down"" and as the storm roared, the recruits all hunkered indoors, listening to the howls of the wind, and feeling the building shake.  But once the storm was over, the DI's announced, ""Time for a Garden Party!""
So the recruits were detailed to go out and PICK UP all the fallen branches, leaves, twigs, etc. blown down by the storm, till the grounds looked neat and tidy once again, and then it was back to ""normal"" (which as our daughter told us was, ""You just survive from chow to chow."")  But she came out the other side as a proper US Marine, and we were very proud of her.  She sent us a copy of her ""graduation"" picture, in full dress uniform, but with the warning, ""Prepare to be scared!"" because apparently in the Marines, if you are a woman, even the COLOR of your LIPSTICK is regulation (bright red, oh dear!) and she about died having to wear lipstick like that!
Well, part of the trail we hiked this last Monday sure could have used a platoon of Marine recruits to come out and have a Garden Party!  It was a 2 1/2 mile section along a high ridgeline (""creatively"" named The Ridge Trail) and I guess that not very many people ever travel it, and it was obvious that the wind has been really blowing up there, because it was a MESS.  We lost track of how many times we had to step over/climb over trees fallen across the trail, and the rest of it was so scattered with debris of various sizes that it made the going really slow, at least for me.  (Fixit was his usual zippy self!).
The trees haven't totally finished leafing out yet, so we did get some pretty awesome views from up there on the ridge, even with all the mess underfoot!
Before we did that Ridge section, we'd already done many, many miles from a trailhead called Five Brooks, then up and over the Coast Range mountains down to another trailhead right by the ocean, called Palomarin Trailhead.  The part along the coast was spectacular, with high cliffs going right straight down to the sea below (if you remember my last post, I mentioned how that sort of thing used to terrify me, but not anymore).  Fixit and I did give the cliff edge a good berth, though, because these cliffs are crumbly sandstone stuff that has a bad reputation for suddenly breaking loose and plunging down to the sea below.  It's not like the solid granite of the Sierras on Mt. Whitney.  It was a beautiful but very windy day, with the ocean full of whitecaps and the seagulls having a bit of a tough time navigating the gusts.
Lunch was at a sheltered, sunny spot heading up to the Ridge Trail, right next to lupines in full bloom!  Sweeeeet!
We finished the day with a fast hike down the twists and turns of the Stewart Trail, and the final touch was that as we approached our car in the parking lot, a guy approached us to find out what the situation was up at Glen Camp, one of the backpacker camps at Point Reyes Nat'l. Seashore.  Turned out he was from.......GEORGIA!   We told him we were fixing to hike the Appalachian Trail, and he was very pleased!

Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633965,"Our boxes and big envelopes for AT resupply are just about ready to roll, and looking at them sitting there along the wall of our living room brings back an awful lot of memories of the first time we ever did the PCT.  We'd never done anything before but a week-long backpacking trip, and thinking about doing 2,650 miles (that's what the PCT was then) was pretty exciting.There were many things we did not know about longdistance hiking before we started that year, but one thing we learned about fairly early on was the AWESOMENESS of meeting TRAIL ANGELS!  One of our first experiences with this was in Big Bear City.  We were sitting on a bench in front of the post office, emptying out our resupply box and putting the contents into our packs, when along came a cheerful guy who greeted us with, ""You guys hiking the PCT?""  We said that yes, we were!  He said, ""Where are you staying tonight?""  We said, ""We don't know yet.""  His response was a hearty, ""Well how about you stay at MY place?""  Wow, were we surprised!  But he was for real, and we climbed into his truck and headed out of town (not very far) to his house.  We were met by his equally friendly wife, and the minute we walked in the door, I KNEW we were ""home"" because the walls were lined with BOOKS and there were even piles of books on the floor!  The first thing I look for when I go into somebody's house is books.  If their place just looks like something out of an interior decorating magazine, or the opposite, a total junk pile, I am equally not impressed.  But a house full of books?  That's home territory!  I asked about the book piles on the floor and it turned out that the guy was in the middle of a big research project.  (Remember, this is WAY, WAY before the internet!)  We had a great evening with this trail angel couple, and that was just the first of many such experiences, all of which were just spontaneous ""happenings"".Trail angels have fed us, given us rides, let us stay at their house or camp in their yard, given us water, and even asked, ""Would you like me to take your garbage for you?""  (That one was up on Sonora Pass in 2010--we were in the middle of a 7-day stretch from Tuolemne Meadows to Lake Tahoe, and being able to get shed of our garbage was wonderful!)  We have had so many trail angels help us that I have totally lost count of the times!  Many people who BEGAN their hike all bitter and cynical about life end up totally transformed by the genuine kindness they receive from trail angel after trail angel.Fixit and I try to be trail angels ourselves, whenever we get the chance.  When I'm on my way home from climbing Mt. Whitney, as soon as I get back to Horseshoe Meadows, I start looking around for any hikers who might need a ride down to Lone Pine.  I've met a lot of PCT hikers that way!  And when Fixit and I are car camped anyplace where PCT hikers might show up (namely Onion Valley or Mammoth Lake in California or Mazama Village in Oregon) we look for PCT hikers and offer to let them share our campsite, for free. On the CDT, the trail is mostly so remote and far from anything that trail angels are relatively rare.  On the PCT in 2010, Fixit and I joked that the first 200 miles or so are more of a ""hobbit walking party"" than a thruhike.  There's just one trail angel after another!  And they all FEED you!  We hear that there's a lot of trail magic on the AT, too, and we are looking forward to it!  You know you're a hiker when......you meet strangers and start telling them about the local trails.",,View Entry,"Mar 28, Sun",0
Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634116,"On Monday, we did what will be our last hike at Annadel State Park, before we head for Georgia and climb up Springer Mountain.  We are now carrying our ""real deal"" packs--the ones we will actually be using on the AT--instead of our battered old, tried 'n true training packs.  Fixit has a brand new pack--it looks so spiffy and clean and bright!  I joked that I need to wear sunglasses to walk behind him--the pack is a blindingly BRIGHT orange!  I'm carrying around 20 lb.--I think Fixit had more like 24 or 25.I was also carrying our tiny ""kitchen"", and a freezedried dinner, so I could get back in practice with cooking on the trail.  On the AT, our plan is to only cook maybe every other day, and use ""other stuff"" on the alternate days.  ""Other stuff"" can include all kinds of things, from cold pizza to thawed frozen burritos, to Subway sandwiches, or whatever else we happen to spot that looks good.It was actually a warm day, at last, and we soon were able to shed all our layers.  Wow, that felt good, after being cold for so long!  The grass is intensely bright green,  embroidered with wildflowers (a bit short 'n stubby due to lack of rain).  A couple of ridges over, we could hear the sound of a ""working"" helicopter.  Not sure what the project was, but that helo sure was busy--it kept coming and going for a long time.  And then there were the turkeys--flock after flock of them, with the toms showing off their tails and the hens just scurrying away from us.  We heard ""gobblegobblegobble"" all day long!  The other critters we met (and lots of them!) were the mountain bike riders.  It's Easter week, so I guess they were on vacation!  How they can enjoy being on the rocky, rough trails of Annadel Park is beyond me--it looks like a very uncomfortable ride.  We stopped and COOKED lunch by a little creek, the only one that is still flowing, and enjoyed a redneck mocha (hot chocolate powder mixed with instant coffee), followed by a ""Pasta Romano"" (accompanied by splitting a ""Hefe"" beer), and then we split a Snickers and and an apple for dessert.  The little stove (made by Fixit from the bottom of a beer can) worked great, even with a fair amount of wind blowing, and then Fixit washed the pot and the cups we eat out of with water from the creek.  We talked about how on the trail, we normally would also take out our sleeping bags to fluff and air, and wondered about how bad the ticks might be along the AT, and would we dare to lay out our sleeping bags on the ground???  Fixit suggested we could maybe drape them over bushes to avoid ticks, but I said ""I think ticks are in the bushes, too.""  So we decided we might have to look for bare rocks or bare dirt to air our sleeping bags on.The rest of this week, we have lots of stuff going on with church--services every day, and then Easter Sunday, hooray!  We are looking forward to the sunrise service over in the hills west of where we live.  After that, it's only 16 days till we head for the airport!You know you're a hiker when......you bring your postage scale to go shopping at REI.",,View Entry,"Mar 31, Wed",0
Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634295,"A friend of ours who is curently starting on a thruhike of the PCT just posted a pic of a very, very rocky stretch of trail that was basically a collection of ankleturner type rocks.  I said, ""A job for the trail gorillas!  Call for the trail gorillas!""  ""Trail gorilla"" is a PCT term for the volunteers who work on maintaining the trail.  They're called gorillas because they often pack in heavy, heavy equipment and supplies, and do a lot of really heavy work.  The PCT depends on these determined volunteers to take care of the trail, and they ROCK!  Not only do they move rocks and clear rocks, and log out fallen trees and ""brush"" the overgrown bushes that are sometimes so bad that you can't even see the trail, but they do it cheerfully, and for NO pay other than the fervent thanks of ""us hikers.""  The PCTA even has classes that potential gorillas can take to get ""certified"" on things like chain saw work, moving BIG rocks, constructing new trail, and other interesting topics.Fixit and I admired the trail gorillas so much that one summer we volunteered to be gorillas, too, on a stretch of the PCT up near Mt. Adams in Washington.  There had been a forest fire the autumn before, followed by snowmelt runoff in the burn zone that caused a lot of damage to the trail.  We had to each bring a pair of steel-toed work boots, plus our own personal tent, etc. but the food and tools were supplied by the PCTA.  We packed in our own personal stuff (it was about a half day hike), and horse packers brought in all the food and tools.  We had a really great time!  The ""boss"" (who was also a volunteer) horrified us all on the first day by telling us we were ""done for the day"" at only 3:00 pm.  'Whaaaaat?"" was the universal reaction amongst us crew.  The boss said, ""Well, the PCTA doesn't want me to work you guys so hard that you go home all cranky and tired and saying, 'I'll never do this again.'  We all roared back,  ""We came out here to WORK!  We love this trail!  We want to fix it up as much as we possibly can in the time we've got!""  And we mutinied and refused to stop till almost 5:00 pm, every day.We had divvied up who did what camp chores, and so most days, Fixit and I would ""get off work"", grab our ""camp clothes"" and then hike a bit over a quarter mile to a lake, where we would take off our shoes and go for a swim with all our clothes on, to wash the sweaty, dirty work clothes AND us, then change into our camp clothes, bring the work clothes back to camp, hang them up to dry, and join the rest of the crew for dinner.  Those  ""rest of the crew"" thought we were craaaaazy!  They would just stroll over to a nearby creek and ""sloosh off"" and rinse their clothes.  But Fixit and I prefered our ""lake showers.""By the end of the week, we had really fixed up our assigned section of the trail, and we were all very proud of our work!On our first PCT hike, Fixit and I had reached Castle Crags campground in northern California, and arrived in time to not just camp, but even take a shower. We take turns taking showers, so there is always at least one of us ""at home"" to watch over our little camp.  (On a thru hike you can't take any chances on somebody coming by and stealing your stuff.)  I'd done my shower, and it was Fixit's turn, but he did not come back for quite a long time and I was actually starting to get worried about him when he finally arrived, all damp and grinning.  Turned out he'd had to wait in line for a shower!  Ahead of him was a whole crew of CCC (California Conservation Corps) kids, and Fixit said their conversation went something like, ""Man!  I am tiiiiiiired!""  ""Me, too""  ""But man I feel SO GOOD!""  And they they started talking about how for the first time in their life they felt like they were really doing something worthwhile, something that would really make the world a better place, as they worked their tails off on trail maintenance, trail construction, etc. and how they loved that feeling.  ""I felt like so worth nothing, before CCC"" said several.  ""It feels so good to work HARD and feel good about it,"" they all agreed.  They were discovering how it ROCKS to be a trail gorilla!But THE MOST AWESOME TRAIL GORILLA of all, in the opinion of Fixit and I, is the ""trail gorilla"" who took on the the whole weight of all of our selfishness and stubbornness and sin and its awful consequences, and carried it off where it is gone forever, and now He walks beside us every step of the trail.  That ULTIMATE BEST trail gorilla is Jesus.  Today is Easter Sunday, and It has been an awesome, joyful, glorious day of celebration that He really is alive, not buried in a tomb somewhere, and we each have met Him and He has been changing our lives ever since.  He is the best Trail Gorilla of all!You know you're a hiker when.....dieting is about trying to GAIN weight, not lose it--so bring on the chocolate Easter bunnies!",,View Entry,"Apr 04, Sun",0
Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634525,"Today Fixit and I loaded our car trunk with AT resupply boxes and took them over to a friend's house--she'll be mailing them in 3 batches, one month apart.  Loading the boxes into the car made it start to feel very real--YES!  We are doing the AT!  I felt like the steps out to the car carrying boxes were the ""first steps"" of the hike!On Monday we did our weekly all-day hike, this time a 20 miler out at Point Reyes Nat'l. Seashore.  We loaded up with our basic training 20 lb. packs and left the car at Bear Valley.  We were the only car in the parking lot, but as I got near the start of the Rift Zone trail, along came a ranger in his car and the conversation went like this:  RANGER:  Hi!  Are you planning to go camp?  (Meanwhile looking slightly suspicious because I had no permit hanging off my pack).  ME:  Oh, we're just on a training hike for the day--we getting ready to do the Appalachian Trail...leaving in a couple of weeks.""  RANGER: (slightly relieved)  How many miles are you gonna do?""  ME:  ""Oh, around 20, we hope""   RANGER: ""Then you must be planning to go over the mountain to Wildcat Camp.""  ME:  Exactly!  That's where we're headed.""  RANGER:  Well, you make sure you stay out of the burn zone and don't do any of the closed trails.""  ME:  Absolutely, we will stick with the open trails.""  RANGER:  Have a good hike!""  ME:  ""Thank you!""I felt like I was back on the PCT in Yosemite, meeting a backcountry ranger who wanted to be sure we 1) Have a bear can and 2) Have a permit.  I do really like and appreciate the rangers but when they go into ""enforcement mode"" it's not always comfortable being around them.So Fixit and I headed into the woods.  Green was the color of the day, everywhere we turned.  But what really stood out to me was that in the Douglas fir forests where the trees are dark in color, there are small deciduous trees growing among them, and those little trees were just starting to show bright green leaf buds.  I immediately flashed in my mind to a San Francisco Ballet performance I recently watched of George Balanchine's ballet, ""Jewels.""  (Yes, in addition to hiking, I also love ballet--was  a ballet wardrobe mistress for years)  One of the pieces in that Balanchine ballet is called ""Emeralds"" and the backdrop for the dancers is a very velvety dark that's spangled with tiny emerald green glitters of light.  I stood and looked at those little trees in the fir forest and said, ""Look!  Emeralds!""  I tried and tried to take a picture of them, but the camera just doesn't seem to see things the way I see them.There were quite a few people out on the trails--hikers, backpackers, bicyclists and horse riders.  When we walked through Horse Camp before making the turn for the big climb over Fir Top mountain, we saw ""horse people"" camped, and figured we'd meet some of them later on.  We sure did--what beautiful horses!  There were also ""dude"" riders from the riding stable at Five Brooks, although I was disappointed to see that on one of the horses, there was a dude city kid completely ignoring the beautiful forest and the fact that he was riding a horse, because he was totally engrossed in his cell phone.  Sad.  We saw that on the CDT in Yellowstone Park, even.  There were people who ignored Old Faithful Geyser because they were ""into"" their cell phones.  We made it all the way into Wildcat Camp by lunchtime and that's when we discovered Fixit had forgotten to bring the fuel for our little stove.  No problema--we put water in our pot, added the freezedried ""Chicken Risotto"", and stirred it a lot while we were eating the other things we'd brought.  Then we ate the just-a-bit-chewy Chicken Risotto!  But as I chewed away on the risotto, I was watching a puzzle on the hillside north of the camp.  There was something on the ground that looked like a log--but I was sure I was seeing it move.  What could it be?  It was the wrong color for a deer.  Then suddenly, it stood up, and it was an ELK!  A cow elk!  I could not believe my eyes.  Normally the elk are kept strictly confined to the north end of Point Reyes.  And then ANOTHER one stood up, and another, until there were SIX of them, all casually eating grass.  Fixit and I were totally engrossed in watching them.  We've seen elk before on the PCT up in Washington.  We have never seen them here in Point Reyes South.  Wow, were we excited!  The elk did not seem one bit worried about us.As we headed back up the big climb over the mountain, I did get a couple of elk pictures!  Fixit had an up close 'n personal encounter with two huge bull elk on the CDT in Montana--because we hitched a ride into town with a bow hunter who had just killed them, cut them up and put them in the back of his pickup truck.  He had room for me in the cab, but Fixit got squeezed into the back with a huge dead elk head starting him right in the face.  Fixit said that ride into town was quite an experience!  And it was only the first day of bowhunting season.  The hunter told me that his secret for success is ""Do your homework!"" -- get out in the woods BEFORE hunting season and study where the elk are and what their habits are.  Then you just lie in wait for them, and if you planned well, you should have no trouble bagging a couple of them the first day!Well, the elk we were looking at in the meadow at Wildcat Camp were cow elk, so they'd be off limits to hunting.  We sure enjoyed watching them!  Then it was back to the Bear Valley trailhead, walking through the ""emerald forests"".  I guess we'll be seeing plenty of ""emerald"" on the AT--my sister went on a trip to New England one summer and came back saying, ""Wow, it's green there in July!""  We Californios are used to summer being BROWN, not green!  You know you're a hiker

Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634649,"We just recently received our official ""AT Thruhiker Registration"" paper from the ATC and printed it out.  Not sure what we are supposed to do with it??  Is it like a PCT or CDT thruhiker permit that makes it so you don't have to have separate permits for all the various parks you pass through?  Well, we will carry it along for whoever wants to see it!  And we still have to get a Smokies permit.  
The ATC keeps sending anxious emails that remind us very much of what Fixit and I call ""the trailhead gauntlet for unwary hikers"".  We've started out at trailheads where the whole first 20 feet or so of trail is lined with signposts warning you about all the potential dangers you may face if you ""go out there"" on the trail.  Sometimes there are so many of these that an inexperienced or anxious hiker or overprotective mommy might see them all, freak out and go back to the car, never ever to attempt a hike.  We wonder how many kids have been deprived of the joy of learning to be a real hiker, a real outdoorsy person because mommies got scared of the signs and wouldn't try hiking with their kids.  I can say that because I'm a mommy, and we ENCOURAGED our kids to go ""out there"" and taught them how to NOT be stupid or careless, and what to do in various situations.  Our kids' favorite one of those situations was ""hug a tree"", which is what you do if you are a kid out in the woods and suddenly realize ""Oh no!  Where are mom and dad?  I don't know where I am"".  You go to the nearest tree, give it a big hug, and sit down next to it and STAY there till mom or dad come.  And not only that, but you have a secret password (ours was ""A Locksley!"" which means ""I'm for Robin Hood!"") and anyone you don't know who comes along and says, ""I'm here to take you to your mommy"" has to tell you that password, or you do NOT go with them!
So the ATC is now sending us email after email about all sorts of problems and dangers we may face--I guess they are hoping we will get scared and stay home??  The latest one is about problem bears.  Well, there wouldn't be problem bears if it weren't for problem hikers who don't know how to stow and how to protect their food, and who insist on camping where everybody else camps.  I've said it before--bears do not want to spend their time wandering around trying to find hikers.  That would be like elk bow hunters wandering around in the woods hoping to spot an elk.  No--the bears observe the hikers and hang out where hikers go, just like bow hunters observe elk and then lie in wait for them.  So if you don't go where hikers go to camp, your chances of a bear encounter are way minimalized.  Actually, Fixit and I are WAY more worried about TICKS than we are about bears.  We don't want to end up with Lyme Disease!
Out here where we live, the ""trailhead gauntlet"" signs typically include:  RATTLESNAKES!!   TICKS!!  WEST NILE VIRUS!! (from mosquitoes) MOUNTAIN LIONS!!  COYOTES!!  FALLING TREES IN BURN ZONE!!  We will be interested in seeing what kind of warning signs there are along the AT.  
The AT also recently sent another email warning of ""dangerous stream crossings"" due to heavy rain.  Well, for us PCT hikers who have gone through the High Sierras in a big snow year, when all the creeks are roaring whitewater, we just shrug and say, ""OK, streamcrossing protocol needed.  Can do.""  Fixit and I have made many scary crossings. A couple of them were bad enough that we did a ""team crossing"" where we sidestep across together, with Fixit (heavier and taller than me) in front, facing the current, of course, and me right behind him holding on to his pack, but protected from the full force of the current.  If I am crossing whitewater solo, the basic rule is ""Face the current, lean into it, and move one thing at a time--first one trek pole, secure it, then one foot, secure it, then the other trek pole, secure it, then second foot, secure it....repeated all the way across.
So we are used to the trailhead gauntlet....only now it's coming by EMAIL!

Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634909,"We did our last all-day training hike on Monday, April 12, by taking on what we consider to be our toughest hike--the ""Big Rollercoaster"".  This is the one where the first time I did it, I was totally WASTED at the end.  Now I'm fine--a bit tired, but fine.  We had perfect hiking weather--not cold enough to need a jacket, but cool enough that if you stop for too long, you'll want the jacket back on!  The wildflowers were trying valiantly to put on at least a little bit of a show, but they were so stunted and so few.  Our ground here is dry to the point of cracking, and this is the time of year it would be MUD!  But that's California for you--good rain years and drought years.  In the 1890's, there was a prolonged, severe drought lasting several years, and it was pretty devastating to the economy--things didn't really recover till the early 1900's.
That's why I shake my head and roll my eyes a bit at all the ""climate change!!!!"" fuss.  People who fall for that simply do not know their history. (Not to mention that hundreds and also thousands of years ago, there were severe ""climate changes"", long before people had any way to ""mess things up"")  It pretty much has to do with the goings-on of that big yellow ball up in the sky.  One time when I was hiking alone in Samuel Taylor State Park a couple of years ago, another hiker came along, and we were chatting a bit.  He began to express concern about climate change, and I jokingly said, ""Yeah, that big yellow ball in the sky sure does mess us around sometimes, doesn't it?""  His response was literally to go berserk!  He began to SCREAM at me, a high pitched, horrendous scream, and told me that ""People who think like you should be TERMINATED!""  I did have my trek poles and was quickly thinking of getting the poles into ""self defense mode"" like we use when we meet really rude dogs on the trail, and wondering if the guy was going to attack ME??  But instead, he whirled around and began running away from me, still screaming that I should be terminated.  Whew.  I turned on the afterburners and hiked/jogged as fast as I could for a good half hour to put as much distance between that guy and me as I possibly could.  And of course I prayed for him and felt very, very sorry for him living in such a state of mind.
Anyway, our training hike went really well--we saw lots of BIKERS out on the trails, including one guy who was quite the senior citizen (like us) and he told us how mountain biking ""really keeps you in shape!""  It is certainly keeping him in shape!  But everybody we know who mountain bikes also ends up breaking things--arms, legs, head.....and we would rather avoid that!  The bikers don't seem to care about rough trail and rocks--they go charging and bumping along anyway.  Are there a lot of mountain bikers on the AT?  Nobody seems to say anything about them in their trail journals.
Back at home, prep for the AT is getting serious.  Our first ""batch"" of resupply boxes just got mailed--the post office clerk was a guy, and when he noticed the boxes were all going to different places, he inquired what they were for, and when I told him ""Resupply boxes for an AT through hike"" he got all excited.  Turns out he is hoping to hike the PCT!  So that was a very encouraging thing to have happen!
We are loading our packs, checking and rechecking every single item, to make sure it's there.  When we hiked the CDT in 2016, Fixit thought I had the groundsheet for the tent, and I thought he had it, and our first night out from the Mexican border, we were planning to cowboy camp and that's when we discovered that NEITHER of us had it!  We ended up using the tent as a groundsheet, and once we reached Lordsburg, our first resupply, we went to the Dollar Store and got a $1 plastic tablecloth, which lasted for the whole rest of the hike!  It was heavier, though, than the Polycryo we thought we were bringing, that got left at home.  So we learned our lesson, and this time we are being super-careful.
Our biggest question mark at this point is the logistics of setting up our tent in the pouring rain.  Out here in the West, where it rarely rains, we always use a tarp, which is actually the IDEAL shelter when it IS raining, far better than a tent.  No worries about condensation, and in the rain, you whisk out the tarp, set it up, then get under it and do all the rest of your ""camp chores"", like preening the ground of sticks, pine cones, etc., spreading the groundsheet, getting out sleeping bags, unpacking, etc. while completely protected from the rain that's falling all around.  We actually went to a park a block from our house and puzzled over how to set things up if it's raining.  We have some ideas at this point, but are not yet really satisfied.
My one disappointment is that I had hoped to have LOTS of pictures of all our AT prep hikes, etc. over on our WordPress blog.  But we just have not been able to get the technology to work for us.  To put pictures on that blog, we first have to put them in a file in our computer (no problem there) and then put that file into the ""Media Library"" at our WordPress site.  Problem: the ""Library"" doesn't seem to have room for very many pictures, and it is (for us) a HUGE and FRUSTRATING hassle trying to get the pics to go in.  So we have more or less given up on having lots of pictures.

Army warehouse.  This Sunday, both Fixit and I will be the preachers for church.  We get to talk about how to read the Bible, which is no ordinary book!  At St. Johns, I will do my last bit of helping get the service set up (Anglicans need more than a mic and a music stand!), attend the 8:00 service, and then head down the block to the Salvation Army to preach!You know you're a hiker when.....You buy Heet, but it's not for your car!",,View Entry,"Apr 18, Sun",0

This morning (Tuesday April 20) I totally finished every last itty bitty detail of loading my pack and fanny pack.  The next order of business was to get our Smokies Nat'l Park AT Thruhiker permit.  We'd been advised that the best time to do this is a couple of days before you leave home, since the permit is good for 38 days, and we should be long gone from the Smokies by the time it runs out.
So I went to the Smokies NP backcountry permit website....and then spent the next almost 2 hours wrassling with it.  I was only able to make forward progress by constantly retrying to register.  Each time I tried, I'd get a wee bit further on than the last time.  Finally I got to what I thought was going to be the finish line--to PAY for my permit.  All was filled out, all the credit card info, etc. and when I hit the ""pay"" button, BAM!  I was up against the wall again--a blank white page with the cryptic note in a corner that said ""HTM1:1 not available""  
So I finally gave up trying and PHONED the Smokies backcountry office.  It was voicemail of course, but it wasn't too long before a very nice lady returned my call.  I explained the situation, and SHE tried to get the permit site to work.  No go!  She wrassled with it for awhile, too, and finally gave up--BUT solved the problem (for now) by simply TELLING me what our Smokies AT hiker permit numbers are, for me to write down and bring with us.  She said when we enter the park, to put a copy of those numbers in the box so they will know we entered, and then as soon as possible after we EXIT the park, to please call them and see if it would be possible yet to PAY for the permits.
So that means we just walk on in to the Smokies NP and then hope that by the time we are done, they have their website working.
That's government in action for you.  Sigh.  But the lady at the backcountry office was supernice.
Unexpected Drama, Act 2   ""Redirect Resupply Box""
One of the places we were planning to send a resupply box was to a friend who lives not too far from Harper's Ferry.  He was happy to have us mail our box to him, and looking forward to seeing us.
But later today (not long after the ""Smokies Permit"" drama) we found out that he has Covid-19 and is very, very ill.  We are not sure he will survive.  So I had to rush to the home of our friend who will be mailing us all our boxes, open up the box that was originally going to our Harper's Ferry friend, and retrieve the guidebook pages that list where you can send maildrops.  (There aren't many such places around Harper's Ferry!)  But I finally located one that is 5:5 miles off the trail, just before Harper's Ferry, called them up to confirm if they took mail drops (whew, the answer was YES!) and then I made a new mailing label and resealed the box.
If our sick friend recovers (we are praying he does!) we can still go see him, but we dared not risk sending our box to his house, given the situation.
OK, NUFF drama for one day!   But we are grateful it all ended up well.  After today, only one more day at home!
You know you're a hiker when.....the day hikers all smell like flowersps Addendum to Act 1.....at 8 pm tonight (our time) lo and behold, our AT thruhiker permits appeared in our email box.  The lady at the Smokies backcountry office had promised me she would keep trying, and it looks like she succeeded!  ",,View Entry,"Apr 20, Tue",0
Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635232,"Today is our last day at home before we leave, and it will be superbusy, not with getting ready for the AT, but with getting set up and then running the Awana Awards Night for all ""our"" kids and their parents.  But we will squeeze in a last 1-hour ""training walk"" with fully loaded packs.
From this point on, here's how this journal will work.....
1) Every night I will get into my sleeping bag and handwrite (yes, on paper, with a pen!) all of what went on for us that day.  I'll write fast & scribbly, but leave a blank space at the top of the entry.  Once I am done scribbling, I will write a SUMMARY, very neatly, in that blank space.
2) When we get to a resupply, my paper journal gets put in an envelope and mailed to my sister (her trail name is ""Cellolady"" because she plays the cello) who lives in Arizona.  She will transcribe and post the ""Summary"" for each day on TrailJournals.  (Eventually, when we return home at the end of the summer, I will add the rest of my scribbles to each journal entry).
3) Photos--I actually do have a lot of photos, but getting them to post online has turned out to be impossible, probably because they were too high-res.  So I have turned down the res in my camera, and Cellolady will do her best to put up the photos at our WordPress journal site, which is montybillpct.net
If you would like to read our journals and see some photos for the PCT in 2005 and 2010 and the CDT in 2016, they are all at montybillpct.net
So nothing will appear on this journal from this point for maybe a couple of weeks.  And when entries do resume, they will come in ""bunches"".
There's a song we sing with the kids at Awana, and I am singing it to myself today.  It goes, ""I am off on the Ultimate Adventure, trusting Jesus all along the way!  To the truth of God's word I will surrender, no matter where I am from day to day.  In the sky, undersea, in the wild, Christ with me, here at home, around the world, His love is clear to see--won't you come along with me, on the ULTIMATE ADVENTURE?""   Thanks for joining us on our AT adventure!

Then we got our start numbers — we are hikers 2,036 and 2,037.  At 9:40 up the trail we went to the top of the falls.  Very pretty!  And then the “firsts” began.  First wildflowers — the trail was literally lined with violets!  First blue trail blaze.  We climbed steadily and reached our first bare trees, spotted our first poison ivy, saw our first AT shelter, and near Springer Mtn. summit was our first trail dog!  (A nice, friendly one!)  At the top it was 2:40 pm.  We devoured the rest of our sandwich, collected a pebble to take to Katahdin, and the Ridge Runner took our picture.  Off down the mountain, following white blazes at last.  We are camped tonight on Hawk Mountain.  (Miles to Katahdin: 2185)","Roswell, GA

Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636891,"Well, the AT motto is “No rain, no pain, no Maine”.  Today it certainly was RAIN!  The forecast was for potential heavy rain and wind.  The rain started in the dark and early, so we ate breakfast in the tent, before we started hiking.  Packing up in that cold rain was no fun, and took longer than a regular packup.  Then we did PUD’s all day.  (PUD’s are “pointless Ups & Downs”, where the trail runs up and over every hill, instead of contouring around them.)  Many of the PUDs were steep and rocky, and had been turned into a creek by the rain.  We even had some rain-swollen creeks to ford, and occasional fierce blasts of wind.  It was too cold and wet to try to just sit down and eat lunch, so we pushed on till 2:00 and went to the Gooch Mountain shelter to be able to cook and eat out of the rain.  The place was crammed with hikers, but they let us squash in for a little while.  We got water there, too, from the nice piped spring.  This evening, we reached Preaching Rock, where Fixit very happily did a “sermon”.  He just finished a book (he wrote it) called “Satan’s Masterpiece and the Way to Freedom”:  you can get it on Amazon (Author William G. Chipman).  Tonight the rain is back, with lightning and thunder too.  (Miles to Katahdin: 2,171.2)","Hawk Mountain, GA

Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636893,"I think I can honestly say that the AT is physically way tougher (so far) than the PCT or CDT.  There’s not a whole lot of flat dirt trail, and there are mostly steep ups and downs, some very, very rocky.  But one interesting side effect is what I’ve decided to call the “Sleeping Beauty effect”.   When you are up on top of the mountains, the trees are still all asleep, bare and brown.  But when you do a big killer downhill, you’re in the zone where the trees have woken up and are starting to leaf out, so you feel like you are walking through a cloud of intense green.  The big challenge today was the ascent and descent of Blood Mountain (it got its name from a very bloody battle between the Cherokees and the Creeks).  Whew, was tough!  Rocky, rocky, rocky!  But our gear that got wet in the rain yesterday got all dried in the sun and wind up top.  Down below we could hear what we thought were car races — nope!  It was motorcyclists “riding the hill”.  After pizza at Walasi-Yi hiker center, we pushed on for another 4 miles.  Tonight we are camped at Wolf Laurel Top.  (Miles to Katahdin: 2,158.1)","Preaching Rock

Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636895,"Colorado may boast of its many “14-ers” (14,000 foot peaks that people can climb), but the AT boasts of its “4-sers” — 4,000+ foot mountains that all AT hikers must climb, whether they want to or not.  Today we climbed 3 of them in a row — long, steep huff ’n puff climbs.  On the PCT, the trail contours past the peaks, with side trails or routes available for people who want to do “peakbagging” — climbing them so you can add them to your collection of “Peaks I Have Climbed”.  It’s a fun hobby for people with lots of energy, while the rest of us just stick to the PCT trail.  So we have now “bagged” Blood Mountain, Rocky Mountain, Tray Mountain and Kelley Knob, plus countless others that didn’t quite make 4,000 feet.  And of course in between you go way down!  By the end of today, we were so tired!  We sure miss the beautifully graded trail of the PCT!  But the Appalachian mountains (when we can catch a glimpse of them through the bare branches of the trees) are an incredible mix of color, texture and design.  Their beauty helps keep us going up yet another big climb!     (Miles to Katahdin:  2,124.5)","Unicoi Gap, GA

Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636899,"We spent a lot of our time today way up high, above the “green line”.  Here’s how it works:  you know how when it snows, you can see a line across the mountain where the “white” begins, and below that, it’s just rain?  Well, here in the Appalachians, in spring you get the green line, where the trees have leafed out in spring green gorgeousness, but above that, the trees are still brown and gray and bare.  I really wanted to take a picture of this, but the air was too hazy for my camera.  Today we twice climbed above 5,000 feet — the biggest one was up Standing Indian Mountain, which is quite huge.  The wind on top was really roaring.  The trail today was often rocky and rooty — not much smooth dirt.  There was one very rough and difficult (for me, not Fixit) stretch that made me feel rather bad, but only a couple of hundred yards later there was a trail magic setup — a retired guy who gave us sausage patty sliders, fruit, drinks and granola bars.  Wow!  We are currently in a “hiker bubble” which means a group of hikers with similar speed.  So the trail today was pretty busy.  But we are pulling ahead of the “bubble”.  Tonight we are camped on Ridgepole Mountain, with a glorious view.     (Miles to Katahdin: 2,098)","North Carolina

Guyot and then over Mt. Cammerer.  We had to admit, we just weren’t going to make it to the park boundary.  And the long downhill ahead of us was really rough going, with lots of roots and rocks.  So I told Fixit not to wait for me, but to head straight for the shelter and grab a camping spot, while I picked my way slowly down, dealing with roots and rocks.  I reached camp, and we barely had time to eat before it started to rain, so we scrambled for the tent!  It’s still raining as I write this, and we are very tired.

The AT = A Lovely Beast   So far, I am just amazed at the sheer beauty of the AT, with its forests, wildflowers and crystal springs.  But at the same time, it is a ruthless Beast of a trail with its relentless steep ups and downs, and much rough trail.
The CDT = An Epic Maze   The scale of everything on the CDT is at “epic” level, both in scenery, elevation, etc.  But don’t do it without a good navigation system!
THE PCT = Collector’s Edition   The PCT has the most amazing variety!  Even within one day’s hike, you can see several different types of scenery, etc.  And it’s a trail that soon feels like ‘home” and is comfortable to hike (except the High Sierra in June — that’s tough!).

Rodgers Outfitters, where our resupply box was waiting.  Well, 9 am came and nobody opened the store.  There were several of us hikers there waiting.  10 am — no sign of the owner, even though we phoned his number repeatedly (and a local who knew him even called his girlfriend, begging her to send somebody with a key to let us in so we could get our box).  It was an important box with not just maps, vitamins and personal stuff, but also 5 freeze-dried dinners with lots of dehydrated veggies.  After 2 hours of no response from the store owner or his girlfriend, we gave up and went to “worst case scenario”.  I took notes on other peoples’ hiker books (like “where is water?”, “what difficulties should I be aware of?”, “how many days will it take?”, etc.).  Then based on my hastily scribbled notes, I went to a Dollar Store and resupplied as best I could.  BUT, during all this, little brown sparrows kept flying near to me and I said, “OK, Lord!  Got the message” and began to hum the song Ethel Waters used to sing at Billy Graham crusade meetings:  “I sing because I’m happy — I sing because I’m free, ‘cause His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.  Yes, His eye is on the sparrow…..and I know He watches me.”  I told the Lord, “Thank you!  I know you will take care of us.”  And meanwhile, back at Lady Di’s, all this had given Fixit the opportunity to help another hiker who said he was a Christian, but was really going through some personal difficulties.  So all that fuss and delay was not only for the sake of “us” sparrows, but for the sake of another lonely, troubled “sparrow” who needed comfort, wisdom and prayer.  Well, once I had our resupply from Dollar General, we headed out as fast as we could go, to get in as many miles as we could.  It was a very warm day and we were grateful for the ever-present “green tunnel” for shade.  Tonight we are camped near a creek, and the gentle water rushing sound is so nice.  We are glad “His eye is on the sparrow.”  And I guess our box we never got will have to be mailed back.  And the store owner who never showed up was also a guy going through great personal problems.  Bummer about our box, but we will pray for him!Total miles so far:  485      Miles to Katahdin:  1708.1","Lady Di’s hostel

Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638665,"Hikers have very mixed feelings about rain on the AT.  On the “pro” side, the forest and plants here depend on having plenty of rain.  Without it, things do start to get a bit droopy.  We’ve had so little rain now for awhile, that we are seeing the “droop” happening.  The other good thing about rain is that it “powers” the springs so they run well.  We love drinking that cold, delicious spring water!  On the “con” side, hiking in the rain means mud, slippery-ness underfoot, and wet clothes and gear if you are not careful.  And setting up/taking down in the rain is not fun!  Well, last night when we set up camp, it was beautiful weather — warm air, blue skies with white clouds, etc.  I even hung some sweaty socks out to dry, and we settled in for a very comfortable evening.  I zonked out quickly — I was tired!  But about 4 am came the pitter patter of raindrops — we quickly “battened the hatches” — and it really came down for awhile!  But when it was time to take down the tent and head for town, the rain stopped and the sun even tried to come out.  We hurried past some huge and loudly-buzzing power lines, before a stop at the “Lindamood Schoolhouse”, which was all set up as it would have been in the 1890’s, complete with an open Bible on the teacher’s desk, turned to Psalm 90.  (Very appropriate!)  Some of the thruhikers “camped” in the schoolhouse to avoid the rain!  We pushed on through a couple of miles of “hiker carwash” — wet plants and grass overhanging the trail — just missed watching a freight train go by, and soon found ourselves in what I guess you could call an “Interstate freeway exit” with a motel (where we are right now), 2 gas stations and 2 restaurants.  We did a “pack explosion” in the motel room and went to the truck stop gas station for breakfast (did the best we could) and discovered that one of the truck stop tables was piled with really good Christian books for people to take and read.  Awesome!  We are doing a zero day tomorrow — I will be reading!  While we were eating breakfast we had a lively discussion with a fellow hiker who is a real live Arian (look that up so you know what it means!).  Then I picked up our little resupply box from the Long Neck Lair Alpaca Farm.  They were not home, but you could just walk in.  I sat down on the very comfortable couch-with-coffee-table to do some planning, and was immediately besieged by the very friendly kittens who live there.  One insisted on getting on my lap to be petted.  Back to the motel I went to do laundry, and Fixit and I found ourselves in another lively discussion, this time with a Native American guy.  Then the rain returned.  Wow are we glad to be under a roof.  We are so tired.  What a day!Total miles so far:  545.7      Miles to Katahdin:  1647.4","3 miles from Groseclose/Atkins

Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639086,"We finally, finally had some sense to stop after 5 weeks on the AT and just rest.  Every single day till now has been filled with the pressure of trying to make more miles or trying to get resupply “chores” done as quickly as possible so we can get back on the trail.  It’s been a lot of pressure.  And it was self-imposed.  On the PCT and CDT, the trail was much gentler and everything just felt more wide open and free.  We never felt so pressured.  But we run into hikers here who just love the AT so much that they are doing it again!  They are truly enjoying themselves.  So we are going to do our best to unpressure ourselves.  Anyway, today was basically ""Eat.  Read.  Rest.  Eat.  Repeat.""  And it is really making a difference.  Fixit's feet have completely stopped hurting.  We are feeling like jello – which means we are really starting to relax.  But what's really great is we've now had a number of conversations about the gospel with a fellow hiker in the motel room next door.  He is tall and looks unbelievably strong.  He says he can do 28 mile days on the AT and we totally believe it.  If you could see the muscle on this guy, you would know what I mean.  And he fully admits to having done plenty of things he knows are wrong, and he is sort of wandering around trying to know/understand God.  He has read the Bible and he is also a real thinker.  What we feel from him is a great longing to truly know God, but it's mixed with a lot of confusion.  He says he likes to be up on the high mountaintops on the AT and sit alone and try to talk to God.  He has agreed to come to church with us tomorrow.  (We found a Baptist church 1-1/2 miles away that we can just walk to.)  It will be interesting to see how a bunch of Southern Baptists react to 3 (or maybe more, if we can get them to come) ""AT hikertrash"" coming to church!  We are hopeful that the reaction will be a good one, because so far, all the ""Southerners"" we have met have been very friendly, kind and hospitable (unlike the self-centered ""me, me, me""-ness of so many Californians).  And last night, just down the road a bit, there was a ""down-home, just local folks getting together"" to play and sing bluegrass music.  We got to hang out and listen, and it was so fun!  What cracked me up was all the friendly Virginians there who would start a conversation with me and after I had said only one sentence, they would smile a big smile and say, ""Wall, whar y'all from?  Ah kin tell by yore talk, yore not from he-yar.""  Yeah.  Our California accent sure was different!  But the Virginians have Californians totally beat in the category of real, heartfelt friendliness!Total mile so far:  545.7      Miles to Katahdin:  1647.4","near Long Neck Lair Alpaca Farm

Chestnut Knob, where the shelter is an actual building with a door and windows.  Nice!  But nobody was in the shelter.  I wondered why and opened the door to have a look.  Pheeew!  I slammed it shut quick!  The inside totally reeked of skunk!  Fixit and I stayed outside along with everybody else and rested a bit and had a snack and admired the awesome view of the ""God's Thumbprint"" valley far below with its many tidy farms.  Then it was back to the PUDs.  We were now on another ridgetop, only this time it was very rocky, and the AT trail literally drags you over every ridgetop rockpile.  Argh!  Slow, slow going for me.  We ended up camping by the trail – we created a campsite, since there hadn't been one for miles.  We could not stake the tent – the ground is too rocky – but we used rocks instead!

Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639439,"After we got up this morning, the first thing we did was to fill up on water.  Springs and creeks are getting farther and farther apart.  No problem to us – we are used to this from the PCT and CDT.  After that came 3-1/2 miles of hiking through what I would call a very brave and valiant forest.  It looked as if some malicious giant had wrenched and broken the tops off all the trees, kicked others over so they were lying on their side, and then bent over and crushed others so that even though their tops were not broken, they were bent over all the way to the ground.  It was so sad to see all this, BUT these trees and forest were not giving up.  No matter if they were broken, knocked over or bent, they had put out their leaves and were doing their best.  I was very impressed!  The AT trail faced quite a challenge going through all this.  Instead of a straight run along the ridge, the trail twisted and turned, and wove its way through.  We wondered how much mileage this added to the official miles?  At Symms Meadow, we had incredible views of farms and valleys down below.  There were also some very steep, tough climbs today, and some of the trail was basically tough but tedious.  One of the other hikers commented on how boring it was except for the fact that you have to be constantly alert so you don't fall and break something.  We did eventually reach ordinary forest where the trees were not damaged.  We were grateful for the shade, since it was a very warm day.  Then after having to deal with several crazy-steep PUD's, we said ""Nuff!"" and switched to walking a road that parallels the trail.  We are almost back to the trail tonight, camped in a very pretty forest near White Rocks Campground.  We have decided that from now on, if there is a blue-blaze trail or a road that is close to the AT, we will go that way.  We are pretty fed up with the very poor condition of much of the AT treadway.  Often as we walk along, we comment on what a PCT trail crew would do to fix the AT.  So I guess you could say we are now ""CDT-ing"" the AT.Total miles so far:  662.7      Miles to Katahdin:  1529.7","Up on a ridge

Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639441,"It was cool and cloudy this morning – the rain overnight left everything misty.  We ate breakfast before we started hiking, rather than trying to eat in some muddy turnout along the road, because this was a ""let's see Virginia and meet some locals"" day instead of slippery rocks in a green tunnel up on a ridge.  And we had a great time – locals driving by would stop to chat (the road was not busy, so no problem there!).  They thanked us very much, ""You came down off that ridge to see the real Virginia"", they said.  One lady tried hard to persuade us to ditch California and ""come out here – hardly any taxes, and if you want to start a little business at your house, you just do it.  No permits – no licenses.""  We stopped at a little old general store for cold sodas and the lady who ran the store came out on the porch to talk as we drank them.  She's a retired dairywoman and told us a lot about farming.  But it was time to climb back up on the ridge to the AT, and we found a whole trail magic setup with happy hikers.  We joined in for awhile, but we had one more bit of roadwalk, around the famous/infamous ""Dragon's Tooth"" rock.  Many of the hikers ""slack"" that part of the trail (carry only a small daypack with lunch and water).  We had decided not to do that section because it's notorious for the difficult rock climb down.  Being 1) old people, and 2) we are not into ""slacking"", and 3) it's been raining and it's humid, so the rocks are slippery, we opted to go with ""safety first"".  Going around Dragon's Tooth also gave us a chance to see a lot more of the fascinating Virginia mountain ""culture"" – a mix of real log cabins with modern ""stuff"".  We were aiming to stay at 4 Pines Hostel, and were worried we might not be able to find it.  Many of the hostels have no sign out in front – and in this case, the only way we knew we were there was we saw some hikers walking down the driveway!  I concocted a salad out of stuff we found in the hostel fridge, we took showers to wash off all the sweat (it was humid again), and we set up our tent to the sound of thunder rumbling and occasional lightning.  No rain, though.  We are all comfortable now, with the resident duck flock walking by and quacking!

We filled out our Shenandoah National Park permit, and began the walk that took us up and up into the mountains.  Since we were walking the road, we had lots of awesome views of both sides of the mountain ridge, plus really interesting signs that told about what we were looking at.  Evidence of the CCC work int he 1930's was everywhere, and it was all top quality.  The thimbleberry plants were blooming, with purple flowers!  Since the park speed limit is 35 mph and the road shoulders are plenty wide, it was ideal for a roadwalk.  The wild grapevines are really leafing out.  They climb and sprawl everywhere, and are really pretty.  Summer-type wildflowers are starting to bloom, and we also saw a lot of deer, including one totally clueless fawn who was running around playing in the road while its anxious mama tried to shoo it up the hill.  We had so many great views of interesting Shenandoah features like small talus fields on the hillsides, and across the way there was a ridge that looked just like what the ridge here in the park used to look like.  The whole top of it was cleared and was being used for pasture and crops.  When they decided to put a national park here, they kicked out all the ridgetop farmers, built the road, and replanted the trees.  Now those trees have grown huge and beautiful.  We were hiking as fast as we could, hoping to reach the Loft Mountain ""Wayside"" where food is for sale.  But it was so hot and humid (I literally had sweat dripping off my chin!) that we just couldn't do it, and ended up ""yogi-ing"" a spot in the group campground next to the Dundo Picnic area.  ""Dundo"" is important to us, because Ray and Jenny Jardine were here when they hiked the AT, and it was here they invented the ""Dundo bath"" which is a hiker version of a sponge bath.  Tonight we're camped with a jolly group of friends, who even gave us watermelon.  It is very warm.  No cold night tonight!Total miles so far:  887.9     Miles to Katahdin:  1305.2","Waynesboro

Back to the AT we went, very excited about heading into Harper's Ferry!  At first it was nice dirt trail, but after that it was back to rocks, ranging from ""not bad"" to the kind where you put down your trek poles and use your hands to haul yourself up or down.  Fortunately, it was mostly what I call ""medium rocks"", and since it was a very warm, humid morning, some of those rocks were already starting to ""sweat.""  I tried to be really careful not to step on any of those.  A real highlight was meeting a football-size box turtle sitting in the middle of the trail.  The sky, which had been very cloudy, gradually cleared.  
We finally got a glimpse of the Shenandoah River and the freeway next to it; the hiker route took us UNDER the freeway, then up ONTO it, on a protected walkway next to the cars, all the way across the river.  On the other side, of course, was a steep climb up onto the Harper's Ferry peninsula.  We took the blue-blaze trail to the ATC headquarters (enjoyed all the history signage along the way!), and found out we are hikers #733 and #734.  I guess we have made some progress from #2,036 and 2,037!  To be fair, they did mention that ""hundreds of hikers had already gone through but didn't get counted,"" because the headquarters was closed.
We headed for the Amtrak station to meet our friend we'd been looking forward to seeing, and while we waited for him, I got to watch an Amtrak train coming in, then it headed into a tunnel in the cliffs by the river.  Wow!  Fun to watch!  Our friend picked us up, we had lunch with him on the way back to his house, and now we are clean, our clothes are clean, and we got to rest and meet his grandkids.  Tomorrow I plan to do a bunch of gear mending, and I've started studying the maps that will take us from here to our next stop at Duncannon.Miles today:  5.6         Total miles so far:  1,025       Miles to Katahdin:  1,168",,View Entry,"Jun 27, Sun",0
Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641188,"We spent today at our friend's home in Frederick, Maryland, eating and resting, and for me, SEWING.  I think I have learned something--a hiking shirt is good for ONE long trail, not TWO.  For the CDT in 2016, I made a new hiking shirt for myself, and really liked it, so I have been wearing that same shirt for the AT.  Not smart.  The fabric on the back of the shirt, where it rubs against the pack, has worn so thin that it is starting to tear.  I do not want to get a new shirt, because I really like this one, so today I put a very large PATCH on the ""worn thin"" part of the shirt.  Our friend does not have a sewing machine, so I had to do all this by hand.  No problem--I am used to hand sewing, too. Hopefully the patch will help the shirt survive all the way to Katahdin!I also mended a number of other items as well.  Today was a good day to be inside and sewing--outside was very hot and humid.  Fixit mostly just rested and hung out with our friends--it was so good to get all caught up on each other's doings and remember the awesome things we got to do together in the past, during the ""Jesus People"" time of the late 1960's and early 1970's.Also, I found out that when it rains around here, it rains like crazy for an  hour (or less) and that's it.  So if the forecast says ""Rain"", it doesn't mean all day.  It also explains why the AT trail so often looks like a gullywashed creek bed, not a trail.  I know I'm sounding like a broken record, but the AT people really seriously need to learn how to BUILD A TRAIL PROPERLY so it doesn't gullywash, especially since the rains here can be so heavy.  Well, tomorrow, it's ""on into Maryland!""  So that's 5 states done, and 9 to go!Miles today:  ZERO",,View Entry,"Jun 28, Mon",0
Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641191,"Our friend dropped us off in front of the Harper's Ferry train station, so we could resume hiking right where we left off.  It was 8:30 am, and already warm and sweaty.  We got to walk across the Potomac River on a hiker bridge right next to the train bridge.  The river was really moving fast, with some white water.  Fixit and I were soon on the C & O canal towpath, dodging the bikers as they came along.  There is still some water in the old canal (it's all green and scummy, though). Finally the trail left the towpath and started switchbacking up South Mountain.  To our pleased surprise, the trail tread was quite good, and we stopped for lunch at the Ed Garvey shelter.  Wow.  This is the BEST shelter we have seen on the entire trail so far.  It's two stories high, very clean and varnished, with plenty of seating.  Another hiker came along while we were cooking and eating the lunch, and talked about his dismay at the thought of the steep halfmile climb down from the shelter and then back up again to get water.  We encouraged him to do what we were planning to do, which was to just hike on another 4 1/2 miles and get water at a county park, right on the trail.  He said, ""Whew, I will do that, then!  Thanks!""It turns out that South Mountain was the site of some tragic battles during the Civil War, where Confederate and Union troops were wrestling for control of the roads leading to Harper's Ferry.  Along the trail, we often saw signs that said, ""Hallowed Ground"", and requesting that we treat the area with respect, remembering the hundreds of soldiers who died there.  I stood by one of the signs in the green and quiet woods, and tried to imagine what it was like during the fierce battles that raged there.  It was a very sad and solemn place.Meanwhile, the TRAIL ""ground"" went from very nice to being rocky and nasty.  We keep looking at these stretches of trail and thinking how to FIX them.  It so could be done!At the end of the day, since Maryland does not allow dispersed camping, we stopped at Dahlgren Backpacker camp.  Normally we prefer to just camp in the woods, but it was sort of fun to have a table and even showers!  There is an elegant eating establishment nearby, but all of us hikers opted for  our own trail food at the camp.  There are ""tent pads"" provided, but hardly any of us were using them, because most of us do not have freestanding tents, and the tent pads are made of tightly packed gravel--impossible to get a tent stake into. Our lightweight tents set up with our trek poles and 6 stakes, so if we can't get our stakes into the ground, we can't set up a tent!  Everybody is grumbling about the ruff 'n rocky trail.  But it is very pretty here, we are on nice soft grass, and the shower sure felt good!Miles today:  18.8         Total miles so far:  1,043.3        Miles to Katahdin:  1, 149.8",,View Entry,"Jun 29, Tue",0
Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641276,"Today was a long and tough going day.  But it had a very inspirational start--we climbed the hill up to the original, FIRST Washington Monument, built in 1837 by a little town nearby, to honor their beloved first President. After that it was time to tackle the AT.  Somebody around here must be really, really ""into"" laying logs across the trail to stop erosion, because we had an awful lot of ""step over the logs"" this morning.  What's sad is that if the trail were built right in the first place, the logs would not be needed.  Aside from the logs, the trail was pretty much rocky all day, ranging from a few rocks to just craaaaaaazy rocks.  The hikers are starting to joke about ""What's the big deal about ROCKsylvania?  We've had ROCKorgia, ROCKolina, ROCKassee and now ROCKyland!""We managed to do almost 19 miles in spite of the rocks, and had great fun at a well-timed bit of trail magic just when we needed it--cold Gatorade and fruit!  Awesome!  The trail magic guy was hoping to see Nimblewill, who is supposedly not far behind us.  He's an 80-plus year old guy who is hiking the AT for the I-don't-know-whatith time.  He has an amazing support team, and is basically slackpacking the whole trail and getting picked up most nights to go stay in a hostel or something.  Fixit and I are self-supported, carry full packs and we pretty much camp every night.  So we are operating kinda differently from him.Another thing that happened at the trail magic place was I got an answer to my question of ""What is going on with all the big bugs dying and falling out of the trees?""  I had one poor dying bug fall on me while I was eating lunch today.  Turns out they are ""7-year cicadas"", and they are the ones which last week were singing in the treetops so loud that it almost hurt my ears!  Apparently they sing to find a mate, do their thing, lay eggs and die.  It's nice to have the forest quiet again, but sort of sad to see all the dead bugs on the ground.Then came a fiercely hard climb up a very steep rocky trail, past Raven Rock, and on to a shelter.  The climb was steep, but to give it credit, it was pretty much all on carefully built stone steps.  Somebody really worked on those!  Thunder was rumbling, and there were lightning flashes, so for the first time ever, we decided to try staying IN the shelter, instead of setting up our tent.  The forecast was for rain tonight, and the thought of not needing to pack up a wet tent was very appealing!  We weren't the only ones who thought so--the shelter was quite full, even though it had two ""stories"".Miles today: 18:8       Total miles so far:  1,062.1        Miles to Katahdin:  1, 131",,View Entry,"Jun 30, Wed",0
Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641278,"Fixit slept very well in the shelter last night, but I did not--nobody snored, and everybody was quiet by ""hiker midnight"" (9:00 pm), but those superlight air mattresses are so noisy!  Every time a person on one of them moved, it was LOUD!  So I barely slept.  Now I understand what happened to a couple we met on our first day of hiking the CDT.  On their first night, they were camped near a road (because the trail is near that road), when a large vehicle with NO headlights on came along, obviously coming up from the Mexican border.  The girl told me, ""We were so scared!  We figured they were illegals or drug runners or something, and I said, 'Don't move!  They might hear our Neolites!'""  At the time she told us this, I couldn't understand what she was talking about.  Now I do!Well, last night before everybody went to bed, the talk was about the rather depressing weather report for today--""Rain showers ALL DAY.""  But when Fixit and I got up at our usual 5:30 am, when the birds began their morning songs, it was not raining (it did rain some overnight). We tiptoed out of the shelter, packed up, and headed down the .6 mile trail to the spring to get water.  ""Let's eat breakfast there, too!"" we said. ""Then we can fill up on water again and head out.""Just as we finished eating, the rain began. Whew, perfect timing.  And looking at the map, we realized that instead of hiking all the way back up to the AT, then hiking to the next road, then doing a hitch into town (we did need to do a resupply), we could save all that bother by just continuing on downhill on the ""spring trail"" to a road, where we could easily just walk into town.  We figured then we would walk back to the trail from town instead of hitching.So that's what we did, happily hiking along under our umbrellas to the cute little town of Cascade.  There used to be a big military base there, but it's no longer used, and they are obviously trying to figure out ""now what do we do??"".  We headed for the grocery store and stocked up, and while we were there, the post office lady came in and noticed us.  She said, ""I'll bet you'd like to go to a GOOD restaurant!  I can take you there.""  Well, that was a no-brainer!  We hopped into her car and had one of the best ""2nd Breakfasts"" ever at the Mountain Shadows Restaurant.  From there it was a a couple of miles to walk along the highway and back to the AT.At that point, instead of getting directly onto the AT trail, we took a little forest road that travels along right near the trail and parallel to it.  This meant we got to avoid the rocks for awhile!  The rain came and went, and came and went, but we were very comfortable under our hands-free umbrellas.  But then we began to be very dismayed at what we were seeing in the forest.  It was severely damaged by what had obviously been a severe wind event, and RECENTLY.  The trees were ripped and torn and trashed, but the leaves on the downed branches were still green.  We looked at this in horror and thought, ""Rain is one thing, but this is awful.  I hope no AT hikers were here when this was happening!""  Huge, healthy trees were snapped in half and fallen down.  But we found out from the locals that what happened was a TORNADO, last week.  It was pretty scary for everyone who lives around here--and there are a lot of people--many real log cabins are tucked among the trees.  I didn't hear anything about AT hikers getting hurt, so I guess everyone is OK.We finally reached our goal of Hwy 30, and tonight we are at the Trail of Hope hostel, which is in a church.  We were very interested in seeing it, and meeting the pastor.  But the hostel was full by the time we got there, so we ended up camping in their outdoor pavilion.  No problem!  We enjoyed our ""dance"" with the AT today--we crisscrossed it many times--and tomorrow we plan to do the same again.  And wow, are we glad for hiking umbrellas!Miles today:  22:8        Total miles so far:  1,084.9        Miles to Katahdin:  1,108.3",,View Entry,"Jul 01, Thu",0
Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641387,"Today was pretty much a roadwalk on Road 233 and on the Pine Grove road.  We went this way because if we'd followed the AT, it would be like doing 2 legs of a triangle, and this way we only had to do one.  That's why our ""Miles today"" looks pretty impressive at 27.1.  If we were on the PCT, that many miles would be close to normal, but not on the AT.The day began with a great breakfast at the church hostel--bacon, eggs, and PIE!  Then we headed out on Road 233, and as we walked along, we were admiring the beautiful rhododendrons in full bloom.  They were a different color that the rhodies we saw in Tennessee and Virginia.  And to add to the loveliness, there was a misty ground fog that made the whole forest look mysterious and magical.Another nice thing we noticed as we walked along was we noticed that our clothes are getting DRY!  Because it's been so humid, when we take off our clothes at night, they are quite wet with sweat, and even if we hang them up, they still don't get dry.  Last night when we were camping in the outdoor pavilion, we did hang up our clothes, and this morning they were as wet as ever.  (Inside the hostel, many of the hikers had their clothes draped on chairs in front of a fan, so I reckon they DID start the day with dry clothes!).  We joked about how no critter would ever come near us--my socks now all smell like dead animals, because I can never get them dry---but oh how nice to feel the drop in air humidity.  My pants and shirt actually felt normal.We stopped at noon to cook and eat a freezedried dinner, and by 2 pm we were at the Pine Grove Furnace State Park, ready to eat ice cream!  In fact, as we walked towards the General Store, we saw many hiker packs leaning on the walls, and suddenly there was a roar of cheering from one of the outdoor tables--somebody had met the ""Half Gallon Challenge"".  We had no plans to attempt that, but we did buy a ""half gallon"" and shared it.  Meanwhile, another burst of cheering let us know that another hiker had met the Challenge.  It turned out that though the Challenge gives you a whole hour to finish your half gallon of ice cream, most folks were done in 28-29 minutes.  Way to go!We filled our water bottles and headed back to the road.  Actually, we almost took the wrong road, but (thank you God!) our attempt to go the wrong way was blocked by a ""road closed/bridge out"" sign.  That made us stop and recheck the map, and we realized our mistake.  The rest of the day we were walking by lots of totally CUTE log cabins and homes, all decorated for 4th of July.  Our goal was a place called Cherokee Campground, which is only .4 mile from the AT.  But when we didn't see it and didn't see it, I became concerned, and walked up a driveway to ask a couple of guys I saw out in front, ""Are we near the Cherokee Campground?""  Their reaction was interesting.  When I walked up, first they ignored me, but finally one of them snarled, ""Whadda YOU want?""  I thought, ""Wow, I guess I'm for sure NORTH of the Mason-Dixon line now"", then asked my question.  They said, ""Yeah, it's just down the road.""  I thanked them and we went our way.  What a contrast to the unfailing kindness and friendliness we found in the South!So tonight we are in Cherokee campground with all the usual campground smells and noises.  Tomorrow we will get back on the AT trail!Miles today:  27.1       Total miles so far:  1,112        Miles to Katadin: 1,081.1",,View Entry,"Jul 02, Fri",0
Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641389,"Last night, I was so tired that I just conked out, even with all the campground noise.  Fixit and I are both SO tired!  But we were up 'n at 'em at our usual 5:30 am, and looking forward to reaching the town of Boiling Springs.  It didn't take long to reach the AT, and at first the trail was pretty nice.  I was walking along and admiring the deep green ""velvet"" of the moss tucked at the roots of the trees.But then came a steep rock-step climb (nice job on the rock steps, whoever built them!) that took us onto what I can only describe as an insanely rocky ridgeline.  And I'm not talking ""argh, those annoying rocks in the trail"".  I'm talking piles of BOULDERS (some car-size) to climb over.  Lest we doubt that those boulders were the ""trail"", there were plenty of white blazes and even white arrows to show ""where to go.""  I did a couple of the boulders and just rebelled.  Looking down, I could see that only 20 feet or so below the boulders was a mountainside with very normal-size, manageable rocks that would be way easier to walk on.  So I said to Fixit, ""I'm NOT going bouldering.  I'm going down there where it's reasonable.  We can just yell back and forth to make sure we don't lose track of each other.""So that's what we did.  I dropped down off the boulders and walked the ""regular rocks"" (though it did cross my mind there might be copperheads or timber rattlers hiding in the leafy debris that was all over the place).  Fixit continued on with the boulders, and we yelled back and forth.  Finally he yelled, ""The trail's off the boulders and it's heading off in another direction.  Better come up now!""  So I did.  Needless to say, as soon as the trail reached a road, we said, ""Sayonara, AT, enough is enough!"" and we walked into Boiling Springs along a lovely road through farm fields under a big blue sky full of clouds.  No rocks!  No green tunnel!  The Boiling Springs town turned out to be very lovely, with beautiful historic homes, a lake, and FOOD.  We had a great lunch, and said, ""OK, AT, we're coming back!""  Out of Boiling Springs, the AT trail goes winding along in a narrow green tunnel, through wide open farm country.  We saw lots of corn and soybeans through the ""doorways"" of the tunnel, and sometimes the trail actually broke out of the tunnel and went along the edge of a field.  The corn reminded me of the song in the musical Oklahoma, that goes ""The corn is as high as an elephant's eye, and it looks like it's climbing clear up to the sky!""  Wow, that was some corn!We stopped for our afternoon ""Snickers break"" and started talking about how nice it would be to be able to go to church tomorrow.  If we stay with the AT, we will land up at a highway where we could hitch a ride into town, but.....from where we were, it was possible to walk a few country roads right into town and NOT have to hitchhike. Hmmmm.  So that's what we did, and tonight we are camped out under the roof of the outdoor pavilion in back of a church in the little town of New Kingstown.  Tomorrow the plan is for church, then back to the trail, so we won't reach Duncannon till Monday, and we've heard the trail to get there is really rocky.  Oh joy!  But it was very interesting today to see how the crops were doing on the various farms along the trail.  Some are vigorous, green, and strong, while others are obviously struggling.  Looks like some farmers are really taking care of their soil and some are not.  Before we set up ""camp"" under the pavilion here, I did talk to the guy who lives right next door, to make sure it would be OK for us to do that.  He said, ""No problem--they let the homeless folks stay there for a night or two.""  Well, I guess we are temporary homeless??  Anyway, I asked him if he went to church, and with rather colorful language he told me ""No way, those church people wouldn't want the likes of me.""  I tried to persuade him otherwise, and invited him to come to church with us in the morning, but he refused.  However, he did insist on giving me several of his homegrown tomatoes, which I took very gladly!  FRESH veges on the trail!  What a treat!Miles today: 20       Total miles so far:  1,132        Miles to Katahdin:  1,061.1",,View Entry,"Jul 03, Sat",0
Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641439,"Despite the Hwy 11 traffic noise, Fixit and I got a pretty good sleep last night, and since it did rain a bit, we were glad to be under a roof at the church outdoor pavilion.  This morning, I had gotten dressed, and was sitting on my Z-Rest tying my shoes, with a plan of loading the packs for our return to the AT after church, when I suddenly had a very clear, kind and compelling thought that instantly got my attention.  It was, ""You should check with Fixit to see if he really wants to keep on with the AT, or if he's hiking on because he thinks YOU want to.""  My immediate gut reaction was ""Noooooooo!  He might say he wants to go home, and then we won't finish the trail.  We ALWAYS finish!  We don't quit!""  But the kind thought continued, ""You really need to check with him.""  I stopped tying my shoes and I knew, ""This is God talking to me.  No way can I blow Him off.""How did I know that was God talking and not some random thought?  Because I've experienced this many times before.  The first time ever was when I was in college.  I was an atheist/agnostic-y person, but out of curiosity was at a Christian college to ""find out about Christianity"".  Of course the college required a Bible class, and the first year class was a Bible survey where we went through the whole Bible chronologically.  I rolled my eyes as they talked about Adam and Eve as real people, but by the time they got to Noah and the ark and the Flood, it was just too much.  I was sitting in the class one morning and getting more and more agitated at how they were teaching ""fairytales"", when out of nowhere, I had a clear, compelling thought that said (sort of with a smile)  ""Tsk, tsk!  You're being EMOTIONAL.  Whatever happened to logic and reason?""  Well, since I prided myself on logic, reason, research etc. my reaction was, ""Oh no!  That's right!  I am being emotional.  Shame on me!"" and resolved to stick it out for a year and be totally fair and objective, not emotional.  Well, the end result of that was I came to the conclusion that the Christian position was absolutely right on, and I committed my life to God, to live for Him.  It's been an adventure ever since!So sitting on my Z-Rest with my shoelaces waiting for their final knot, I turned to Fixit and asked him, ""Are you really wanting to keep on with the AT, or are you doing it because you think I want to, and you'd rather not?""  Well, Fixit told me on no uncertain terms, ""I am DONE with this trail.  I am DONE with having to stare at the ground all day to keep from falling and getting hurt.  I'm done with the endless green tunnel and nothing new to look forward to for at least another month of hiking.  I don't mind the boulders, but I do mind the fact that there are WAY too many ways to get hurt on this trail.""  So we sat and looked at each other.  Finally I said, ""Shall we go home?"" and Fixit said, ""Yeah, let's go for it.""  So while we ate our usual breakfast of granola with powdered milk (plus the tomatoes the guy gave me last night), we discussed how we could get home.  We finally decided, ""Let's go to church and then we'll see after that.""  So off we went to the Methodist Church, since it was the first one to have a service that day, and discovered we'd walked in on the ""First Sunday"" for a brand new pastor!  In introducing himself, he explained that he was a former middle linebacker in football.  ""That's why I'm intense"" he said.  Yeah, ""intense"" was a perfect description for him, and we loved it!  This guy does not mess around!  No wimpy sermons from him!  After church, the folks invited us to stay for Sunday School, which we gladly did, and asked them, ""Where's the nearest airport to here?"" and found out that Harrisburg, 20 miles away, had an airport.  Twenty miles?  That was do-able.  Fixit and I immediately made plans to walk over to Hwy 11, stick out our thumbs, and hitch to Harrisburg.But we didn't need to.  The brand new pastor came over to us and said, ""Is there anything I can do to help you?  Do you need a ride back to the AT?""  I hesitated a split second and said, ""We could use a ride to the Harrisburg Airport.""  His response was ""OK!"" and even though his car was still full of moving boxes, he shoved them around till there was room for Fixit and I and our packs, and totally unselfishly of his own time, gave us a ride to the airport.  It turned out he grew up in Harrisburg, and really knew his way around there.  He was the perfect person to help us, and we knew God was at work on our behalf.What we did NOT know at that point (we didn't find out till the day after we got home) was that yes, it WAS God who had told us ""Go home.""  While we were off hiking the AT, a close family member had unexpectedly been hit with a horrendous and grievous situation.  Other family members tried to reach us, but we didn't have phone service most of the time, and when we got to town, we'd look at the ginormous list of phone numbers who'd tried to reach us, and we were too tired to deal with it.  So our family had started to pray, ""Please, God, either send Bill (Fixit) and Monty (3rd Monty) home, or help us be able to reach them.""  God's answer was to send us home, and He took care of the details.At the airport, we found there was a flight to San Francisco that had a couple of seats left, but was taking off in less than an hour, and we decided to go for it.  We scrambled to toss everything from our packs that we no longer needed (or would need in future), and reconfigured them to be carry-ons.  We got through TSA (lucky Fixit is so old now that he doesn't have to take off his shoes!) and raced for the plane.  We got there just as they were boarding, whew!We were still in our hiking clothes and everything seemed so unreal.The flight took us to Detroit, where we had just enough time to grab a sandwich and call our friend in CA who'd promised to give us a ride home from the airport when we finished the trail in September.  She was home (another one of God's ""perfect timing"" things) and said, ""No worries--I'll see you at the airport!""  As the plane flew west, we still felt like it was all a dream.  But when I got my first glimpse of the Sierra Nevada mountains below, I was SO glad!  I think I am a ""Sierra girl"", not an ""Appalachian girl"".  Then it was the golden hills and oak trees of the Coast Range mountains, and the glistening waters of San Francisco Bay, and I knew, ""We are HOME!""   Our friend met us as promised, and we got to our house not long before the 4th of July fireworks started bursting across the sky.  We were so tired!  But our neighbor helped us jumpstart our very dead battery car, and we made a quick trip to the grocery store for food, before we finally collapsed into bed.  We were so tired we didn't even take a shower, even though the first thing Fixit did when we got home was to turn the hot water heater back on!It wasn't until the next day, when we started phoning all our family members to let them know we were back, that we found out about the awful things that had been happening.  And then I understood why I'd had that thought from God this morning, and why God had taken care of all the details of getting us home so quickly and easily.  He really truly does answer prayer, and a lot of times, we get to be part of the answer!I'll have more to say about the AT in a couple of days!",,View Entry,"Jul 04, Sun",0

Now I have access to another computer, hooray!You've figured out by now, I am sure, that doing the AT was not a very enjoyable experience for Fixit and I.  Several people here at home have asked if we plan to go back and finish.  Nope.  Well, we would like to go mess about a bit in the Whites, and we would still like to climb Katahdin (hey, I still have my little shiny rock from the top of Springer Mountain!), but other than that, nah, we are done.I will explain the problems we saw on the AT, but first, to be fair, there were some wonderful aspects to it as well.1) THE WATERThere was water 'most everywhere on the AT, for the 1,132 miles that we did.  And not just any water--it was COLD, TASTY, right from the ground SPRING water almost all the time.  Only once did we ever have to treat our water, so we carried our Aqua Mira mostly in vain.  We watched other hikers doggedly filtering and Sawyering and shook our heads ""Why????""  And even better, we never had to carry big water loads--the sources were close enough together.The only water we've had that was comparable in delicious flavor to what we had on the AT was the water on the PCT up in Washington State.So the AT wins for WATER!(One caveat--I hear that the ATC has shut down the wells for a number of shelters in New York and elsewhere, because the well water ""didn't meet drinking water standards"".  Duh, why not just put a sign on the well pump to let hikers know, ""Treat/filter this water""?  On the PCT, there's a little campground a bit offtrail when you're on your way to Kennedy Meadows South, and the Forest Service shut off the water there because it ""didn't meet standards.""  The hikers and campers said, ""Grrrrrr.  We're only here for a brief while, and we won't drink enough of this to hurt us.  Let us have our water!!""  I think that shutting down the wells is yet ANOTHER example of the ATC having no concern for hikers, but only for what is ""PC"")2)  THE PEOPLEWe met so many warm-hearted, generous people along the AT trail.  And yes, there is more opportunity to MEET people on the AT, because there are way more of them!  On the PCT sometimes and on the CDT frequently, we could go 4 or 5 days without seeing anybody.  But among both hikers and townsfolk, wow, what a bunch of awesome people we got to meet on the AT!3)  THE SHELTERSWe only stayed IN a shelter for one night ( to see what it was like, and also because rain was forecast).  We didn't camp near shelters, either, on the theory that shelters attract bears and critters.  But what we LOVED about the shelters was the opportunity to sit at a table to eat, on rainy days to eat out of the rain, and since water sources are near shelters, we did not have to carry a bunch of water to cook with.  (Remember, we cook and eat at NOON, not at night).  That meant we only needed to carry ""walking water"" to sip on while we walked.Eating at the shelters also gave us a great chance to hang out with other hikers, which was fun.4)  SOME OF THE HOSTELSUntil we did the AT, we had hardly ever stayed at a hostel.  There just aren't any on the PCT and CDT.  The only hostel we stayed at in connection with the PCT was when we were done and on our way home, we stayed at the Green Tortoise Hostel in Seattle.On the AT, some hostels were rather poorly managed and run--they were a bit chaotic.  Other hostels basically wouldn't do anything for you at all without their hand out wanting payment.  After staying with trail angels on the PCT, who do marvelous things for the hikers and just hope maybe you might give them a donation (you don't have to), we found that the hostel-as-a-business model was kinda irritating.BUT there were some hostels that we really enjoyed.  They were either in town or close to town, so we didn't have to depend on a shuttle.  And they were well-run, clean and efficient.  We never did stay in a bunkhouse at the hostels--we either camped out on the lawn, or got a private room--so I don't know anything about the bunkhouse experience.  One of the nicest hostels we stayed at was Angels Rest.  Great place!And you know what?  Even though I groan (see Part Two) about the endless green tunnel, I grant that it was a very pretty tunnel.  So yes, there were many things to enjoy about the AT!",,View Entry,"Aug 01, Sun",0
Third Monty and Fixit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642405,"Fixit and I are basically very determined and stubborn about finishing anything we start.  No matter how hard it got on the PCT or CDT, nothing stopped us (other than a quick trip home during our second PCT hike to take a week and recover from giardia, before returning to the trail).
Fixit is much more fearless than I am, but for me personally, there were a number of times on the PCT early season (roaring rivers to cross; steep icy snow where a slip could mean serious injury, etc)  when I was truly terrified.  But I did not quit!  Prayed a lot, took longer to get through the ""scary stuff"" than Fixit did, but I never quit.
But the AT was different.  On the PCT and CDT, we had MOMENTS of tough stuff, but the normal day-to-day experience of the trail was basically very enjoyable.  The AT for us was 24/7, unrelenting frustration.  There were some nice places, yes, but the overall experience was not enjoyable.
Here's what made it a trail to which we do not plan to return....
1) Having to spend ALL DAY staring at the ground.  We found that most of the time on the AT, we could not freely HIKE.  We had to walk cautiously, staring diligently at the ground, because it was so covered with rocks, roots and trip hazards.  Often the trail was like a dry rocky creekbed, not a trail.  To avoid falls and injury, we had to stare at the ground all day.  We just hated that!
2) The endless green tunnel.  The AT trees, plants and flowers are very beautiful.  But they are endless.  Much of the time, I could not even see the sky!  I felt like an animal in a cage.  I never realized till I was deprived of seeing sky, how much it meant to me.  Out here in the West, we take big open skies and magnificent views for granted.  On the AT, we were lucky to get one ""view"" a day, and honestly, for a Westerner like me, those ""views"" were all the same.  Pretty, but all the same.  I found the AT green tunnel to be downright oppressive.  I wondered how people could stand living in such thick forest.
3) The rocks.  The AT ""trail"" would never qualify as ""trail"" on the PCT.  There were times you could not tell what was trail and what was just rocks.  When we objected to this, we were told, ""You don't understand--the AT is a very OLD trail, very WORN.""  Nonsense!  If it were built RIGHT to start with (like the PCT and CDT), it would not be worn, but would have remained in good condition.  More than once we heard the joke on the trail, ""Oh you know, the AT was laid out by a bunch of drunken college students!""  I half believe it.  Only fools would have laid out the routes that go straight up and down instead of carefully switchbacking and contouring.  We also heard, ""Oh, you don't understand--the AT right of way is sometimes so narrow that the trail is stuck on rocky ridgetops.""  Hey, we hiked those ""rocky ridgetops"" and guess what?  Only 15-20 feet below the official white blazes traipsing over rocks, there would be a nice DIRT mountainside!  Don't tell me the right of way didn't include at least some of that dirt!  Put the trail right on the edge of the right of way if you have to, but get it off the rocks!  I understand that Bob Peoples has been trying to remedy some of this on the AT....go, Bob!
4)  Bouldering should never be referred to as hiking   We were sitting with a bunch of AT hikers, and one guy said, ""Hey the thing that's really getting to me is I signed up to HIKE A TRAIL.  I didn't sign up to GO BOULDERING.""  Fixit and I gave him a hearty Amen!  Anybody who does the AT needs to realize that there's going to be a fair amount of bouldering, which is an entirely separate sport from hiking.  And bouldering in the RAIN is seriously scary.  And it rains a lot on the AT!   We finally ended up avoiding the boulders wherever we could, on the grounds that they were NOT a trail, and were too dangerous.
5) ""Easy resupply options and lots of them"" was a myth.  I was bitterly disappointed in the ""resupply situation"" on the AT.  It turned out that towns are mostly only accessible by hitching or paying a hostel to give you a ride or paying to stay overnight in a hostel so you could get a free ride--on THEIR schedule, which meant usually having to waste a whole day just to resupply.  The hostels had some resupply items, but were nowhere near a match for a grocery store.  It was very frustrating.  I had to spend so much time trying to figure out HOW I would get into town, then buy what I needed, repackage it, and get back to the trail.  It was not fun, and took a lot of time.  On the PCT, we mailed ourselves almost everything we needed, and the resupply towns were easy to access from the trail.  On the CDT, we did do a lot of hitching, but since we had put almost everything we needed in our boxes, I didn't have to spend hours shopping and prepping while on the trail.  I should have done that for the AT instead of believing the myth, ""Oh, there are lots of resupplies, no worries!""
So Fixit and I have no plans to ""go back and finish the AT.""  We might go have a look at the Whites--that part did sound more interesting and more scenic. And I still would like to put my Springer Mountain rock on top of Katahdin!  But doing the rest of the trail has zero appeal.  We're glad to be back home in the West under big skies and climbing big mountains with big views!   We wish a rousing ""Happy Trails!""  to all the hikers we met on the AT, and hope you all make it to Katahdin!",,View Entry,"Aug 15, Sun",0
