Smuggler ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632450,"I first set foot on the AT probably 13 or 14 years ago, and I knew instantly that one day I would pass through that spot on my way north to Maine. My mother had just moved to a new house up in Pennsylvania hills, far away from anyone or anything, but thankfully bordered by a few massive tracks of public land. Her new house was clean and orderly, top of the line and absolutely beautiful. I despised it. Truth be told, top of the line was never my style, and orderly and cleanly conflicted with every part of who I am. 
I don't think I could have survived if not for the dog. Me and Gunner would escape the house every night, every day we could. After school, on the weekends, me and that dog would be out exploring the hills, seeing what we could find, going a little further each time.
""You know the Appalachian Trail runs through here somewhere"", someone finally told me. I'd heard of it before, they mentioned it at some point in elementary school, and I decided finding it was as good a way to occupy my adolescent mind as anything.
Of course, no one bothered to give me any indication of where exactly the trail was. I set off up the mountain every night, private property be damned. I went further and further every day, sometimes staying out well past nighttime, much to my mother's dismay. Even Gunner was starting to look at me like I was crazy when at last I decided to try a new approach, and instead of climbing walked along the base of the hills. There, at last, only a few miles away, was a well worn path and a few white blazes. I looked north, and knew I could walk all the way to Katahdin, and then south where I could find myself atop Springer, and I was hooked. 
I went to the trail almost every day. I found where it passed through nearby Swatara State Park, I started paying attention to all the road crossing in the area. In summer I met the thru hikers and became determined to be one of them. When I got a little older and got my driver's license, I started picking up hitchhikers and listening to their stories. I would just have to wait a few more years, graduate from high school, and I would be free to hike. 
The only problem was I had no gear and no money. When the time came, and in 2013 I graduated, I ultimately had to put the trail into the back of my mind and go get a job. I decided to go get some backpacking experience, and found myself a job cleaning rooms in the Old Faithful Inn in Yellowstone National Park, where I fell in love with the lifestyle, and returned year after year. 
When one of my best friends Creech decided he was thru hiking, I almost joined him, but instead ended up with some friends in a house in Colorado, where I was eventually evicted by two cats (its a long story). Creech, an expert vagabond who bears a striking resemblance to White Jesus, finished the trail with minimal gear and practically no money. 
I went back to Yellowstone and got promoted to Old Faithful Inn Bellhop, where I was finally able to make some half decent money. On a trip to the Annapurna Circuit in Nepal, another of my best friends Corey got hooked on the backpacker life and decided he was hiking the next summer. I almost joined him but was saving up for six month trip through Asia that winter. Corey, who the average person requires a ladder to look a in the eye, finished the AT in September of 2019, with the trail name Safety First.
Now I'm tired of waiting. After spending all of last summer hiking with Creech and Corey through the Tetons and the Absarokas and the Beartooths (why aren't they the Bearteeth?) and hearing their stories all the while i figured now is the time. 
The world's not making it easy for me. Covid is raging through the country, and the Appalachian Trail Conservancy is recommending against thru hikes. Staying in shelters and hitting the usual hiker hangouts would be dangerous and irresponsible. I  plan to carry more food, limit my town days, where a mask whenever I'm around people, and sleep as far away from others as I possibly can, and I think that would actually be safer then staying in Yellowstone for the summer. For now, I'm skiing a few miles a day to keep in shape, reading about gear and trail life in every second of my off time, and staring furiously at the calendar wishing it was closer to my start date. 
Bring on the threat of rain and snow and blisters and pestilence, I am ready. Whatever it takes, I'm getting this done. My start date is April 2nd. See you on the trail.",,View Entry,"Jan 28, Thu",0
Smuggler ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632542,"Research has been done and is ongoing, but I'm almost out of things to research. Other than a few odds and ends, my gear has been bought and shipped,, my start date has been selected, and I've fought through the arguments of everyone who, as usual, feels the need to tell me I'm insane. ""I already know that and by now you shouldn't be so surprised by it""With all of this out of the way, the final task, probably the hardest, is to wait. I got an app that counts down to 9am, March 26th, my start date, and it current tells me I have 48 days, 15 hours, 34 minutes, and 15 seconds until I leave from Amicolola and ascend Springer to get to the start of the trail. 48 days doesn't seem long, especially after waiting all these years, but at the same time, it feels like an eternity. What makes it worse is the fact that I've sent all the gear I've ordered to my dads house in Pennsylvania (mail gets lost way too easily here in Yellowstone). I want to lay in my hammock, sleep with my new quilt, set up my rain tarp, but they're all thirty hours away from me, and I'll only have two weeks to make sure they work when I leave here on the third of March. I'm sharing a start date with two good friends, Jill and Morgan. I've seen Jill rough it in the mountains plenty of times, including my second trip to Nepal, she has the advantage of living with a successful thru hiker, my best friend Creech, who I'm sure has given her the best possible advice for gear and mental preparation. Morgan I've never hiked with, but I'm confident in her ability. Last year she started a thru hike but abandoned it ten days in when the pandemic started, this year she has no intention of letting covid stop her. We'll at least do the first week or so together, after that, it will all depend on eachothers pace, but I'm confident in the three of us beating the odds and making Katahdin. Jill and Creech came up to visit last week and Jill asked me what my ""hopes, dreams, goals and fears"" were. ""Well I'm pretty sure hopes, dreams, and goals are all the same thing, but I guess they would really just include reaching Maine, having a good time doing it, and at some point turning feral to the point I can't be reintegration into society and living out the rest of my days as an escaped farm animal adjust to its newfound wildness.Fears, on the other hand, I'm only afraid of five things. Bison, norovirus, rental RVs, toilets that won't stop flushing, and one other thing i don't tell people because I can't give out ALL my weaknesses. A few of those are pretty low concern on the trail, and a few more are likely issues. Otherwise I really just hope I don't get Lyme disease again."" (I couldn't walk for over a month when I was child, I'm pretty sure that's actually my first memory).Jill agreed. Her and Morgan have both told me they're worried about hypothermia in the first weeks, especially in the Smokies, I told them their fears are far more reasonable then mine. And the waiting continues. I take another lap on my skis, go ice skating for an extra few minutes, build up my legs just a little further and wait for March. The time is coming fast, but its taking so painfully long.",,View Entry,"Feb 05, Fri",0
Smuggler ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633838,"The prep stage started to feel like it was never going to end. I packed up my room in Yellowstone and drove the whole way home to PA. I found my gear that I had been sending to my dads house and the two of us went to work dialing it in. I slept in my hammock, walked with my backpack, used my stove, and waited. The waiting is the hardest part, as a great philosopher once said. The minutes rolled by slowly, but steadily. Those minutes turned into days and those days turned into weeks. I went to see Corey and bask in the advice of a successful thru hiker. He told me I start to hate whipperwills with a burning passion. I got more gear, made some runs to REI, and waited. I started setting up my hammock and tarp every day for practice. The second or third time a huge gust of wind came just as I was setting up and ripped the tarp out of my hands. It, of course, kindly decided its best course of action was not to blow away from me, it's loving owner, and instead it directed itself onto a thornbush. The tarps noble sacrifice was heroic but it left a pinhole sized rip near the ridgeline. I patched it with duct tape and can only hope that will hold.I loaded everything inside my bag and stepped onto a scale, wrote down the number, stepped off, laid down the pack, stepped back on and rejoiced. The difference was only 15 pounds. Then I loaded myself up with what I now believe to be an absurd amount of food.And just like that, the time was up, and the waiting was all done. Yesterday I picked up my bag, walked out the front door, hopped in my dad's truck and was whisked away to Georgia.This morning we arrived in Amicolola in a pouring, driving rain. Warnings were sounding all over the state for flash floods, tornados, and severe thunderstorms. Neverminding any of that, I ran around to the backside of the visitor's center and stood in silence when I came across the arch. There it stood, drowning in a growing puddle, the start of the approach trail. Next to the arch sits a sign reading ""Mt Katahdin Maine, 2190.9 miles"". I waited for Jill and Morgan to show up, Morgan brought her whole family for the first few days and her boyfriend Tom for the first month, but only the three of us were going to Maine. We signed in, Jill was 1200, Morgan 1201, and I was 1202. We decided to hike the steps today and start out for Springer tomorrow. We made our way up Amicolola falls in the pouring rain, and now I sit in the Amicolola lodge watching the most intense lightning I've seen in years. Apparently the steps washed out shortly after we did them and closed for days, maybe even weeks. Tomorrow they are calling for a clear day and if all goes well we will reach Springer and officially be on the Appalachian Trail. My thru hike has begun, let's hope I don't drown.","

Amicolola to stover creek shelter
A good combination of lightning and nerves kept me from getting a decent night's sleep. The group of us ate breakfast together and I said goodbye to my dad. 
We all left the lodge and started climbing. We started meeting other hikers almost right away, the first of which said he was already having a hard time. I hope he gets through it. I saw a squirrel a proclaimed that it was our first wildlife sighting.
The weather was beautiful, hot at times but usually with a nice cool breeze. A perfect day to start out. We stopped and filtered water and then went down and back up again and were on the slopes of Springer. We climbed and climbed until we came to a group of backpackers, a narrow view, a plaque, and most importantly a white blazes. The approach trail is marked with blue blazes, common for side trails here, but following the white blazes meant at last we were on the Appalachian Trail. 
I stopped just after Springer and talked to some dayhikers. I told Jill we should start calling the non thruhiker folk muggles, I hope the name sticks. A mile down from the summit at the Springer trailhead was a cooler full of beer and a bag full of packs of Doritos, barely a mile in and there was already trail magic. Two guys, one old with a big beard who called himself ""Doc Holliday"" and a younger guy who called himself ""Chopsticks"" were running it. I drank a PBR while Chopsticks told me he was bringing ten pounds of bacon and pork up to the Springer shelter and cooking for everyone. He says he's doing at least a thousand miles this summer. 
The trail magic (and the beer) put us all in the highest of spirits. Pearl, one of Morgan's group of section hikers, stayed with them and we hiked on. The trail wound through rhododendron forests and crossed the Benton MacKaye trail frequently. We got to Stover Shelter just as my feet were starting to hurt. I laid down my pack and was greeted by a dog named Zeus. 
I patted Zeus and took off my shoes, socks, and liners and slipped into my xero shoes. We all set up camp and I saw another guy with a warbonnet hammock. We filtered water and cooked, then Pearl was nice enough to build a fire. A few other hikers gathered round, and two guys asked for eachothers names.
""My name is Zach,"" said the first. 
""No way, that's my name!"" Zach replied. 
Zach then turned to another hiker, ""what about you?""
""Well actually my name is Zack,"" said Zack to Zach and Zach. 
Another hiker, this one a bit older, chimed in, ""you're not going to believe it, but my son's name is Zach, and what's even more strange is that he's gay and is engaged to be married to a guy name Zakk, he spells it with two ks"". 
""You guys are never going to beleive this,"" I chimed in. 
Zach, Zack, Zach, and Zach's dad all turned to me with a look of astonishment. 
Yes it is true my dear readers, though I've never had much use for the moniker, the truth is that when I was born in a little hospital in Pennsylvania, the name that was saddled onto me was in fact not Hershey Jah-phealz Porterwhiffer, but rather that four letter z name. I usually keep this a secret and refer to myself exclusively by my sugary surname, but alas this gathering of Zachs was much too great a coincidence to ignore. 
""Call me Hershey, but legally speaking, I am Zach""
Together, this group of Zachs, this ""Zach attack"" as everyone called it, sat around the fire, told stories, and ate. We all scattered to our tents and hammocks when the sun went down and the moon lit up the sky. 
I laid in my hammock without my pants until I had to pee and declared to Morgan, Jill, and Tom ""always pee before you take your pants off"". A first little bit of trail wisdom learned. 
Tomorrow the weather calls for rain, but we will march on. To Katahdin we go!","Amicolola Falls State Park

Stover Shelter to mile 11.5
Noone seemed capable of sleep last night. Everyone rolled reluctantly out of bed complaining about a long night with little sleep. Tom said he felt like he was on a hotdog roller all night.
For myself I didn't sleep bad other then some very odd dreams. I boiled water and burn my fingertips pouring it into my oatmeal packets. Lisa came and helped me. Next I found that my spork was too wide to properly eat the oatmeal, but Pearl had an extra one that was long and narrow. Note to self, buy wider oatmeal next time. 
The forecast called for rain all day but in the morning there was only a mist and then alternating clouds and sunshine all day. The humidity was my only complaint, it's hard readjusting to the east's saturated air after years of bone dry Wyoming air. 
We stopped for a break at a large waterfall where I took my shirt off and soaked in the cool mist blowing its way off the tumbling creek. 
When we stopped for lunch Jill laid down her pack and water poured out. Upon investigating she found her water bottle cap to be missing, thankfully she had another.
I very nearly made a similar mistake that morning. I had been cooking in the shelter and had my bag packed. I was about to walk off when I thought I should double check the campsite first. I walked back and found both of my hammock straps still wrapped around the trees. Very nearly an uncomfortable mistake, I promised myself to never leave camp without checking again. 
A ridgerunner came and told Morgan that her dad would be waiting for her at the shelter. Jill and I had to filter more water so we sent Tom and Morgan on to find David, Pearl, and Lisa. When Jill and I got to the shelter none of them were there. We pressed on and found them at a road crossing. They all said they planned on walking all the way to Gooch Gap today because tomorrow will likely be a heavy rain. Jill and I both said that we would rather stagger our miles to ease our legs and feet into shape so we told the others to press on and we would find them tomorrow. Looking ahead there were no upcoming official campsites so we decided to go forward until we found water and then camp at the next clearing. 
Someone was firing an automatic rifle down in the valley below Sassafras mountain, I'm not sure if it was a military base or just someone having a good time. 
Jill and I found water and camp around 4 and set up. A rain cloud came through so we cooked under my tarp. Jill accidentally forgot to remove the sleeve from her cookout and set it briefly on fire,, a mistake I'm sure to emulate. The two of us spent the evening reminiscing about our trip to Asia together and talking about Creech. I think she misses Creech a lot. I do too. I asked her what first inspired her to do this and she said she wanted to learn some independence and backpacking skills on her own, as up until now Creech had taught her everything she knows. 
I wandered off to the woods for a baby wipe bath. The breeze was lovely. 
After dark I crawled into my hammock and was happy for another successful day. I hope I stay dry tomorrow.","

11.5 to Lance Creek, mile 23.9
There was a short burst of light rain followed by heavy gusts of wind overnight, not half bad. Jill and I ate and packed up with incident. As we descended we ran into a heavy fog. Next came a soaking, pouring rain. 
I hurriedly pulled off my pants and put on my rain pants and jacket. Jill was less swift and got wet before she could get her rainwear on. 
At the bottom was a stream with no bridge. Two girls we had been leapfrogging all day were putting there shoes back on so I didn't feel the least bit guilty over changing into my xero shoes for the crossing. 
The rain was so hard I my socks got soaked anyway just from taking them off and putting them on. The trail turned to mud which slowly covered all my clothes and gear. 
When we came to the next stream I just walked through without care, everything was soaked anyway. 
I could feel my first blister forming on left pinky toe. It would need popped that night in camp. We crossed Gooch Gap and stopped for lunch.
Jill has been making tuna and cheese tortillas every day, and as she assembled one she said ""I'm proud of this tuna tortilla for lunch idea"" which is such a fantastic sentence I felt the need to write it down. 
The rain came and went all day, but the fog and gloom stayed. It blocked all the views, but had its own eerie beauty. 
We thought about camping in top again, but decided to press on to the Lamce Creek Camping Area in hopes that Morgan and her people would be there. 
Everyone was in there tents when I got there so I gave a hopeful ""hello"" and a myriad of familiar faces popped out, happy to see Jill and I. 
I've been carrying one nice dehydrated chicken and rice meal since the beginning that I was saving for a tough day, and after popping my blister and wringing out my socks, I decided this was it. 
The sky cleared as soon as I got to camp though. The sun shine through and I hung up everything that was wet, I'm hoping it will dry overnight. 
Zach's dad (I should really learn his name) is here as well and a fellow hammocker named Seventy Pound Hammer. Finally a good trail name. 
Hammer did little research and overpacked. Severely. When he weighed his pack before starting, the scale settled at exactly 70 pounds. Due to this preposterous weight, he has only been able to make about 5 miles a day and was running out of food. I gave him a few packets of oatmeal and Pearl gave him some tuna. 
This morning I thought I lost my stake bag, but now as I sit here writing, I feel something odd beneath me in my quilt, the stake bag lives to see another day. 
Hiking through the rain today made me think of all the people who asked me why I wanted to hike the Appalachian Trail and suffer the rain and cold and heat and pain in the first place. I find that question preposterous. 
George Mallory once shot back at a pesky reporter who would stop following him and asking him why he wanted to climb Everest, ""Because it is there!"". Mallory offered this more as an annoyed jab to get the reporter to leave him alone, but he was speaking the truth, wiser words are rarely spoken.
Why hike the Appalachian Trail? Or the PCT, CDT, Te Aroura, The Jordan Trail, whatever you have? Why hike any trail, climb any mountain, or float any river? Because it is there. 
How can a person know that a footpath winds through the mountains promising adventure and discomforts without feeling its pull? How can a person not answer the call of the wild when it beckons, not want to see the beauty and feel the pains of such a trek once they know they are there? For me the trail requires no other justification. 
Why do I hike? How do you not?
Tomorrow I take on Blood Mountain, which in my mind marks the first major milestone. Onward I go","Sassafras Mountain

Lance Creek to Bull Gap
The wind picked up heavy last night. I was startled awake several times by the sound of a rushing gust sweeping through the trees amd brace myself as it neared me, then upon impact my hammock would lightly rock back and forth in a pleasing comforting motion. 
By morning the wind had stopped but a chill had set in. Lisa came and woke me up and I wrapped myself in my topquilt whole I tore down camp. 
Jill and I were the last ones in our group to leave camp. We walked out to the trail and just kept going until we hit a familiar looking bridge and realized we were SOBOing. We corrected our course and moved on. 
The climbing started immediately, we followed several ridges until we hit the slopes of Blood Mountain. By then I had left Jill and passed Morgan and Tom. I stopped for water at a stream before the climb and some muggles I met the day before asked me where my ""better half"" was. I didn't bother correcting them but Jill and I had a good laugh about it later. 
The climb up Blood was significantly overstated, it wasn't bad at all. At the top I waited for my group and met a little puppy, a black lab. 
The climb down was a killer. It was steep and rocky, hard on the knees. I now had blisters on both of my pinky toes. 
Jill lost another bottle cap on the way down, but was able to recover it. We've tried to give her the trail name Cappin, but I'm not sure she likes it. 
Morgan was having some pains in her knee. I hope it clears up for her.
We got to Neels Gap and stood under the shoe tree. Neels is by far the most common spit for thru hikers to quit, and it's a tradition to throw your boots up into the tree to signal your defeat. (Why would they throw away their shoes? Of you only make it 4 days into your 6 month hike, you're probably never going hiking again.)
The shoe tree was an eerie sight. Hundreds of shoes swayed in the wind, accompanied by windchimes. 
This was also where David, Pearl, and Lisa were leaving us. They handed us each a few cold beers, bought us two pizzas from Mountain Crossing, and hugged us goodbye. 
We ate the pizza and I found a guitar in the hiker box and played for a little while. 
I went inside and bought an asspad, cursing myself for not thinking to get one sooner. 
We decided since there's going to be freezing rain and hail on Wednesday that will be our first zero day. We plan to get a ride out to Helen tomorrow and take a zero there. 
We hiked another mile and set up at Bull Gap. I ate a summer sausage I bought at Mountain Crossing.
I've been joking for the last few days that whenever I take my poopshovel out to dig a hole I am paralyzed with fear that I will hit the remnants of another hiker that was out there for the same purpose. Today it happened. I am now scarred. Tom almost pissed himself laughing about it. 
We played cards after dark, tomorrow is a short day then a ride to town. 
Blood Mountain is behind us, which means our chances of completion have gone up significantly.","Lance Creek

Bull Gap to Tesnatee Gap
It was another chilly night, I may buy a sleeping bag liner to help keep the heat in until Virginia. 
Jill woke me up and I was the last person to leave camp. I ate my second summer sausage and moseyed my way up the trail. 
I caught up with Jill, then with Morgan and Tom. Morgan is having some trouble with her knee and is walking with a bit of a limp. I'm a bit concerned but I can only hope it will heal up tomorrow on our zero day. 
I got out ahead and laid down at Cowrock Mountain, a rock outcropping with a magnificent view. I set out my asspad, propped my feet up on my pack and was almost asleep when three dogs came and licked me, jarring me back awake. 
The group caught up and and our ride, a nice couple that Tom knows named Viviane and Marcello, found us at the top and told us there was trail magic at the Gap. 
I got down first and found two guys with an army of lawn chairs, a cooler full of soda, a table of snacks and even free hats if I wanted one. 
I didn't, but I took some soda and snacks and waited for the others, chatting up a friendly and quite talkative man named King Tut. 
The rest came down the trail, sat for a bit, and then Marcello loaded us all up in his Land Crusier. It was a 1982 and only had 70,000 miles on it. I had to ride in the trunk with the backpacks. I waved at the people in the cars behind us. 
Marcello drove us to Helen where we got a hotel, then to Cleveland where we hit up the Walmart for a resupply and a Chinese restaurant where I cleared a plate faster then I ever have in my life. It's incredible how fast the hiker hunger is setting in for me. 
Helen is an improbable heavily German themed town in the middle of Georgia. It's quite strange, but will be a great place to wait out tomorrow's supposedly apocalyptic rain and hail. 
We did laundry, got creative when the coin machine didn't work, some kid asked me for my favorite dinner food, normal town things. It will be nice to let my feet heal tomorrow, but I already miss the trail.","Bull Gap

Tesnatee Gap to Mile 45.5
We absolutely demolished the free breakfast at the hotel then set out onto Helen's main strip with our thumbs out. Hitchhiking during a pandemic is confusing and difficult. For one thing, I've decided that for everyone's safety I'm only riding in the beds of pickup trucks where I can't get covid from the driver nor them from me. Another issue is masks. The whole secret to hitchhiking is smiling, letting the people see that you are friendly and interesting and probably not a serial killer. If I wear a mask they won't see the good intentions in my smile, but if I don't they may think I'm irresponsible and not want to pick me up. Then again if the driver is a conservative he may see my mask and think me a liberal and not want to give me a ride, but if the driver is a liberal and sees me without a mask he may think I'm conservative and therefore not worthy of a ride as well. 
All this was running through my head as I assured Tom and Morgan that hitchhiking is both easy and safe. I've hitched in Yellowstone, through Death Valley after losing an entire wheel in the desert, and Jill and I hitched across Southern Thailand easily. 
T and Morgan have somehow lived their entire lives without traveling by the thumb, I was hoping the Georgia drivers wouldn't make a fool out of me. Just then, a pickup pulled over and agreed to take us halfway to Tesnatee, we'd only been on the road for five minutes. 
The four of us piled in with the coolers and oil cans in the bed and we're taken six miles down the road. He gave Tom the card of a restaurant he owned. 
The very next truck pulled over and let us in. It was some sort of work truck and the bed was full of extension cords and various other types of equipment. He took us the rest of the way to the gap. 
We were absolutely frigid by the time we got there and had to rush past the trail magic guy (who was set up in the same spot and did not recognize us at all) and rush up the hill to warm ourselves.
Today was the coldest and windiest day yet. I ran into Sherwood as he was bundling every piece of clothing he had. I kept myself bundled in my hat and puffy jacket all day. 
I left the rest of my group in the dust, and tried to wait for them to catch up but was forced by the wind to keep moving. Stopping was impossible.
There were long strands of hoarfroat all over the trail. I haven't seen hoqrfroat since my last winter in Old Faithful and it was a happy reunion, even though it meant an unpleasant day of hiking.
Finally, the trail dropped down the other side of the mountain which blocked the wind and I waited for them at a water source. 
My food bag has become a joke because I made the mistake of underestimating how many chewy bars come in a 36 pack. Our next resupply is in three and a half days which means I'll have to eat ten chewy bars a day, in addition to all my other food, for this to make sense. As I chew on another chewy bars I contemplate the fact that so far I seem to be terrible at managing a food bag.
We did 8.5 miles and called it, wanting to set up before it got too late. 
The sun went down and it became unbearably cold. I made dinner, hung my food bag, layered every piece of clothing I brought, crawled into the sleeping bag liner Morgan is letting me try out, then got into my hammock and under my quilt. 
It's so cold that I had to tuck my filter in under my jacket against my belly out of fear it would freeze and break. When I felt the urge to pee, getting out was out of the question. I simply unzipped and peed out the side of the hammock. 
I'm trying guy best to stay warm in this frigid wind, let's hope I hold up and tomorrow is warmer.","Tesnatee Gap

Mile 45.5 to Cheese Factory Site
The cold last night was downright obnoxious. The wind didn't quit until well after midnight and it got down into the teens before dawn. I woke up at 6 am and bundled myself up as much as I could. I was downright refusing to get up.
I had hoped the sun would warm things up but when I saw that it was 9:30 and still not warm I knew I just had to accept it. 
Some guy came through camp while I was tearing down and asked Morgan and Jill if they were mother and daughter, they are the same age. They both gave that guy a death stare and he moved along. 
I packed up as quickly as I could and ran out of camp, last one up and first one to leave. There was more hoarfrost and big icicles hanging off the side of the trail. 
I stayed bundled all day, hiking in my hat and puffy. I found an asspad on the trail and ran ahead to return it to its owner. 
The trail was a bit monotonous for the first half of the day, sidehilling it's way along at about midmountain. A stream marked the 50 mile line. It was too cold to stop and filter so I just went without water. 
I leapfrogged with a solo redhead for a while, she got a ride to town from Unicoi Gap. Then I met an exceptionally friendly longhaired guy who said he believes in me and that I will make Katahdin. That was a relief to here. On the way up Rocky Mountain I met an old Ukrainian couple and with her thick accent the woman said ""bless you and your hike, you can make it."" Finally there was a kind man with a thick southern accent who I passed twice as he went in circles around the mountain. 
I didn't see Jill, Morgan, or Tom all day. I stopped just short of camp and made supper, knorr pasta and Walmart brand chicken. Jill found me there and we walked into camp together and set up. Morgan and Tom made it next, and Morgan said her knee was bothering her again.
A guy named Shepard built a fire and we all gathered around to warm up. When the fire went out I crawled in my hammock to find I had made a serious miscalculation. The trees I tied them to we flimsy and my weight made the hammock sag to the ground. I tried to make adjustments but my efforts were futile. In no mood to rehang in the dark and cold, I took my quilts off and went over to Jill's tent. We are roommates for the night.","Mile 45.5

Cheese Factory Site to Deep Gap Shelter
I slept pretty well in Jill's tent. The barred owls were going crazy all night, which was oddly soothing.
It was warm enough to make breakfast today, I had oatmeal and then hit the trail up over Tray Mountain.
I was in the zone today. I put my head down after Tray and simply marched. At ae point I started fantasizing about food and decided to stop and make dinner for lunch. To my surprise it was already after three. 
I ate at Sassafras Gap and the other caught up. Morgan said she remembered this gaps water source and that it was magical. I went down to find the spring flowing out from under a tree. Magical indeed. 
We climbed over Kelly's Nob, the last 4,000 foot peak in Georgia, and descended to Deep Gap shelter. There some kids here and a dog, and that friendly guy I saw who few days ago that says happy trails to everyone. 
I ate more oatmeal and crawled into bed early. I am trying laying on my asspad for some extra insulation, maybe ill stay warm tonight. ","Cheese Factory Site

Deep Gap to Plumorchard Gap Shelter 
Finally it was warm and I could sleep. I woke up and played with Oakley, a thru hiking Australian Shepherd who spent the night in the Shelter. I leapfrogged all morning with his owner, No Rush.
We hiked a few miles and got to Dicks Creek Gap and hitched into town. A nice lady picked us up who's daughter is on the trail right now. Her name is Mermaid. 
We went to the grocery store and I got there Chinese food. I'm hopelessly addicted to Chinese food. We resupplied, charged our battery packs and called our families. Apparently it's Easter today.
I went to an outdoor store and bought the warmest sleeping bag liner they had. I'm tired of getting cold.
Then I bought some headphones from a Verizon store and we started hitching back to the trail. I broke my pickup trucks only rule when an odd fellow in a car stopped for us. 
The more he talked, the stranger he got. He claimed to be a thru hiker but didn't know what year he did the trail and seemed to think the trail started in Florida. He also claimed immune to all viruses, but ironically was now suffering diabetes. Even more ironic is the fact that he was a sugar truck driver. 
He drove us back to Unicoi Gap by mistake but was nice enough to spin around again and take us to Dicks creek.
We got back on the trail and my knee felt like it was on fire. I hobbled along until I couldn't stand it and popped a few extra strength Tylenol. This made it manageable until the Shelter but I am concerned about it, 
There was ridgerunner at the shelter who I had a nice talk with. More barred owls were hooting at dark. It's so much warmer tonight then it has been all week.","Deep Gap Shelter

Plumorchard Gap Shelter to Standing Indian Shelter
It was hard to leave the three story palace that is the Plumorchard Gap Shelter. Situated in a cool and not too windy hollow with a nice stream and glorious privy, the spot is an absolute delight. 
But as it is, it was time to get out of Georgia. I ate a bagel and some cookies for breakfast, said goodbye to the ridge runner, and set off on the trail.
Today I didn't start in any layers, it feels good to be hiking in the warmth again. I promised my group I wouldn't cross the border without them so when I finally came to a pipe grown into a tree and a wooden sign that read ""NC/GA"" I sat down and waited. 
A hiker came up the trail behind me and I recognized his face, it was one of the Zachs from the first night. We caught up a bit and I took some pictures for him. Next came a girl named Philly Cheese, she took a picture at the sign with a bud light seltzer. Looked damn good. 
Finally my group came in and we all crossed together, our first state over and done with. 
It was a short flat walk to a water source and I joked that so far I like North Carolina. Directly after that we started what I think was the hardest climb yet on the whole trail. Sharp Top was a tough climb and you don't even get to stand on the summit. 
Yesterday in Hiawassee I bought a pair of ear buds and last night found out they didn't work. I got off trail and called the store to see if there was anything they could do but the logistics of being on trail make these things impossible, I may never get them fixed and I'll probably just have to buy another pair. Such is trail life.
I was off trail for a while talking with them and I was pretty sure everyone passed me. 
I hiked with Goat for a while, until she stopped and stared at a signpost and asked ""does this lead to the shelter or to the privy?""
I looked over at it and laughed as I read ""SHEETER"" 
I caught up with my group and we hiked on, past another gap named Sassafras and another gap named Deep, it's like the trail is already running out of names. 
We made it into the shelter and setup camp. Some moron hung his food bag right in the middle of everyone's tents. 
I'm living on extra strength Tylenol. My knee felt a bit better today, but I'm still popping those little pills like candy.
This was our longest day yet and I didn't feel much like socializing so I ate supper and crawled right in my hammock. 
I suppose I should tell you about my setup, on the off chance someone is actually reading this. I ordered everything from Warbonnet. A blackbird xlc hammock, a wooki underquilt, a diamondback topquilt, and a thunderfly raintarp. Every night I hang my shoes out the side of the bug net from my ridgeline inside my head net, my dads suggestion, genius idea. I seem to be fairly rainproof and warm but we shall see how it all holds up in the months ahead. ","Plumorchard Gap Shelter

Standing Indian shelter to Betty Creek Site
Today was easy walking. There was a small a climb right out of camp but then it flattened out and was smooth and easy. 
Tom and Morgan slept in late so Jill and I picked out our goal for the day, and when Morgan awoke she renamed it ""Betty White Site"" and the name stuck. 
We met Mermaid, who's mother was nice enough to give us a ride to Hiawassee the other day. I told her her mother was a sweetheart.
I left a note in the logbook from Danger Last and hit the trail. My knee was killing me at first. I sat along the trail and massaged it, worried I wouldn't be able to walk today. I took it easy from there and it started to hurt less. I popped two more Tylenol and soon the pain disappeared almost entirely. 
I stopped at a few views but for the most part the easy walking let me cruise all the way to camp. I set up my hammock and a group of four came and built a fire. Among them was a Welsch man who told fantastic stories about castles, Welsch towns and $5,000 espresso machines.
In bed before sundown again, and I don't think I'll have to sleep with my filter tonight.
Today was Morgan's birthday, still not much to do to celebrate except hike.
""Katahdin if it kills me"" has become my mantra when my knee starts hurting. Jill reminds me not to actually die over this, I told her I will damnit. ","Standing Indian Shelter

Betty White Site to Rock Gap Shelter
Noone got any sleep last night. Not me, Tom, Jill, or Morgan, not Mermaid or Goat or Dave, probably not even Oakley, but he's a dog so who's to say. There was nothing to attribute this to. The campsite was quiet, it wasn't especially cold, the moon wasn't out, there seems to be no explanation.
Due to our collectively restless nights, we got up late. We didn't hit the trail until 11 and instantly started a climb of Albert Mountain. 
We played the alphabet game in the way up, then ran into a group with five dogs. We kept on, walking along the cliff edges until the trail turned straight up. 
It was a mix of carved in wooden steps and rock scrambling to get up. Several times I had to let my poles go loose and and bring myself up with my hands. 
At the top there was a fire lookout tower. The very top part was locked but I climbed most of the way up and looked out. It's been smokey the last couple days and I suspected a controlled burn in the area. Mermaid later confirmed my suspicion, there are actually two. 
The words ""100 miles"" were painted on the side of the tower. This is not strictly speaking true as the tower currently sits at mile 99.7. Another 0.3 miles down the trail ""100"" was arranged in sticks. We've officially conquered the first hundred miles. 
Jill and I broke out ahead and had some really deep talks. 
We got to camp and set up. Mermaid and a guy named Dave were at the shelter as well. 
Everyone was in a particularly happy mood. We stayed up until dark, playing cards and telling stories. Tomorrow is another town day. I'm hoping to get my covid shot if I can. 
As I type this, the lightest gust if wind had my tarp shaking beside my head. I need to fix this.","Betty Creek Site

Rock Gap Shelter to Winding Stair Gap
Last night brought a fabulous sleep and the rain was kind enough to not fall at all in the night. 
When I got out to adjust my rainfly the night before I saw, perched precariously above me, a fallen tree suspended in the branches above. I thought about moving but decided that it wasn't too windy and therefore would probably not fall and kill me. I'm sure glad I was correct in that prediction.
We hiked to Winding Stair, only 4 miles away and not too intense or remarkable terrain, beautiful but relatively unremarkable.
I passed a trail magic cooler bit nothing was left but Pepsi, so I left it for the next guy.
About halfway down to the Gap were some friends of Jesus handing out bags of candy and Slim Jims, I took one and thanked them dearly.
Mermaid's mom was at the Gap. We told her Mermaid was just behind us. She offered another ride to town but we were gettinga free ride from Baltimore Jack's hostel so we declined. 
Our ride showed up in a van and we rode to town. Our driver, I think his name was Jim, was a fascinating man. He had been a professional wrestler in Mexico and traveled all of North America, wrestling on Spanish TV channels. He had also been a hotel owner and now was trying his luck as a gun show promoter.
The words ""Legends Never Die"" surrounded a portrait of Baltimore Jack at the hostel. He was a legend indeed. After a tragic life in which he lost his mother at a young age and then his father just before finishing college, Baltimore Jack (who was neither from Baltimore nor named Jack, such is the way of the trail) found himself settling in to the married life but left it to go hike the trail. Here, he at last found the peace and purpose that had been so absent from his life and would go on to hike it seven more times. When his knees finally gave out after so many thru hikes with a heavy pack he began traveling with the thru hiker bubble, cooking, giving rides, throwing parties. He was a part of the trail, everyone knew him, many people loved him. He spent his last few years volunteering with the hostel that now bears his name. News of his death spread from Georgia to Maine along the trail he so adored in a matter of hours. Thru hikers the world over wept for their loss, and the Hikers Den Hostel had its name changed instantly. 
Baltimore Jack's hostel is a perfect memorial for the man. It's a little rough around the edges, old and not trying to be pretty, the hot water doesn't work and one of the dryers is broken, but it has heart. It is welcoming, embracing.
Jim had to go to a gun show apparently, so we are all on our own here. Two more hikers came in and took showers and did their laundry. Since both of them were confined to the hostel by their lack of clothing, I promised to get them beer.
Jill, Tom, Morgan, and I went to the Lazy Hiker Brewery where we found Chopsticks giving advice on stretching and dealing with knee pain. I aye a cheeseburger and brought back a six pack for the naked ladies in the top bunks of the hostel room. 
It didn't bother to rain at all today. I suspect it will pour tomorrow as soon as we get back on trail.","Rock Gap Shelter

Winding Stair Gap to Wine Spring camp 
All four of us got up early and walked out to a church in Franklin that is well known for its free hiker breakfast. We got there late, and therefore only heard the very end of the speech the preacher was making. He said he had tried to grow rhubarb but had thrown lime on it, throwing off its pH and killing it, and that we would need to balance the pH of our lives (????) with Jesus (????????????) 
All that aside, I was handed a plate of pancakes and bacon and a cup of herbal tea and was happy. I had my picture taken and mailed to my dads house, and signed a big sheet of paper labeled ""class of 2021 thru hikers"".
We looked for Creech's name on the 2016 sheet but couldn't come up with it, but on the 2019 sheet we quickly found Corey's trail name, Safety First.
We went back to the hostel and lounged about until noon when it was time to take a shuttle back. I don't know if I will take another shuttle, hitchhiking was honestly much easier. 
Tom and Morgan have decided to take a zero today and stayed in town. We hugged them goodbye and told them to try their best to catch up with us soon. 
Jill and I made it back to Winding Stair and survived the treacherous run across the road in the Gap.
We climbed Siler Bald, the first bald on the trail going north.
After that we dropped quickly into Wayah Gap and then climbed again into camp. Figuring this 8 miles was enough we set up camp here and cooked.
I was mildly drunk when I went grocery shopping and therefore got entirely too much food, but I am also sick of knorr pasta sides and granola bars, so I've been trying to get creative. I poured a bit of olive oil into my cooking pot and stuffed a tortilla in it. I filled the tortilla with cheese and pepperoni and hoped it would cook up like an oversized Crab Rangoon. This didn't exactly happen but it was certainly edible. Next I made some Ramen and ate, enjoyed passing the evening with a group of three brothers who collectively share the trail name ""Three Brothers"", and went to bed before 8:30 as is now my habit. I've never been the sort to be in bed before sundown, but that is the way of the trail. ","Winding Stair Gap

Wine Spring Camp to Wesser Bald Shelter
They've been calling for rain for three days and it has finally come. I woke up this morning to a light misting rain that was just enough to soak my tarp. 
I converted to porch mode and ate breakfast under the shelter. After that I put on my rain pants and jacket and packed my tarp into the outside mesh instead of with my other hammock gear on the inside. 
I walked off and climbed Wayah Bald. The clouds cleared enough for a small view from the old stone lookout tower at the summit. There was a plaque saying hoe balds were formed but the chilly wind let me only time to glance it over. All I gathered was that they weren't entirely sure about what caused mountains in the southern Appalachians to be bald, and that some even required maintenance, this one included. 
I stopped at the shelter and had lunch, using its roof to hide from the rain. 
The rain was on and off for a bit after that. I find my rain jacket intolerable hot on the climbs but it's worth it to stay dry. Still when it's not raining I like to take it off. The result was a constant stopping and putting my jacket on or taking it off. After an hour the rain picked up and I had to wear it all day. 
The ground was saturated and puddles began to form. I took a step on a steep section and the mud gave way and I briefly skied down the muddy trail for four or five feet. I made sure to step on rocks after that. 
In the gloomy woods I noticed a yellow sign on a tree. I walked up to it and saw the message ""trail magic ahead"". I looked around at the silent, misty woods and wondered if someone was going to murder me. I laughed at the thought and walked on, letting my imagination get the better of me. 
Most trail magic is a simple assortment of snacks, which we all very much appreciate. But what if this time people are cooking? Maybe it's some grand feast set up out here. 
The trail magic grew in my head and became more and more preposterous, my hiker hunger influencing my fantasies, until I rounded a corner and found a small village of tarps and tents and fires, peopled with a combination of thru hikers and people dressed up as frontiersmen. I looked out in confusion for a second until a big burly man came up and introduced himself as Blueberry. He said I could set my pack under their tarp, grab a bowl of chili and some homemade biscuits and take a seat by the fire. 
I did exactly that and a boy of about 12 brought me a can of sprite. I dried out by the fire and looked on at the preposterous scene sprawling out before me. I wondered if these people were some branch of Mennonite because of their dress, bit they didn't look much like any Mennonites or Amish I had ever scene. I gathered from them that they had come from Alabama and they did this every year, today would be their last day before packing up. One fellow in a long purple hooded robe started talking to me and I tried to think of a polite way to ask if this was a cult. He finally said that they were all part of a group that is essentially the Jesus version of the boy scouts. I thought it odd that most of them were middle aged or older, but soon decided that anyone who gives out free food to hikers was all good with me. 
I left just as Jill arrived, looking as confused as I had. 
After the camp the rain increased dramatically. My shoes and socks soaked through and we'll as my jacket. In a rain like that staying dry is impossible, even my pants were somehow compromised. I climbed up over several mountains and down into several gaps, getting all the wetter along the way. 
The wind also picked up dramatically. Loud gusts would come tearing through the still leafless trees and rhododendrons toward me, and more then once I huddled down and hid my face from the gusts.
My knee started hurting a little worse so I popped two more Tylenol. It was a near constant ache at this point, and I walked with a bit of a limp. It came and went but for now never got so bad I couldn't walk on it. ""Katahdin if it kills me"" I reminded myself, hobbling a bit and keeping my head down in the rain. 
At least at this point my blisters have hardened into calluses. My feet are turning to leather, I have that to be thankful for. 
I passed a few tents taking up a flat spot on the soaking hillside and thought about joining them, but decided instead to press on to the Wesser Bald Shelter a few miles ahead. 
Now everything was soaking wet and getting chilly in the hard wind. I desperately wanted to get to camp and walked as fast as I could down the mountain. 
When I at last saw a group of tents I almost ran down the hill. Everyone was cowering I their tents and I had every desire to join them. I put up my tarp first, quickly and efficiently, not bothering with porch mode. 
I ducked under the tarp, relieved to be out of the rain and to have a dry space to work. I pulled out and set up my hammock, being extra careful not to let it touch the ground. I hung my underquilt then set everything else inside, stripped naked and set aside my wet clothes, and dove into the hammock, wrapping myself in my topquilt and enjoying the simple pleasure of dry warmth. I ate in my hammock, not bothering to cook tonight and being extra careful not to make any crumbs. Now it's dark and it sounds like the rain had finally abated, but Jill doesn't seem to have made it this far. 
I texted her and to my surprise she replied (service is limited in these mountains and we usually don't bother with our phones) and said that she was sleeping a few miles back with those other tents and that she was also soaking wet. I promised to wait for her tomorrow at the NOC, which is only five miles down the trail.","Wine Spring Camp

Wesser Bald Shelter to Mile 137
The rain cleared up overnight, but it got colder as well. I didn't particularly feel like getting out of my hammock right away so I was lazy for most of the morning. I was the last one in camp by the time I got up.
The trail followed a lovely ridge that was burned by a fire, with fantastic views in all directions and birds chirping and the sun shining. It was a welcome chance from yesterday.
The trail went down for almost five miles. I hadn't realized just how high up I was until I clamored my way down the steep and rocky descent. 
At the bottom was the Nantahala Outdoor Center, a paddling school and outdoor shop right on the trail. The NOC is where everyone prints their permits for the Smokies, myself included. I grabbed a new headlamp and some replacement parts for my gear and set about making repairs. After that I grabbed two beers and waited for Jill. She had somehow slipped by me and was in the store buying a new backpack (hers was too big) do I cracked open a beer, put in my headphones, and laid out on the bridge. It was fabulous.
I also managed to get myself a vaccine appointment in Robbinsville, not far from Fontana Dam. I hope I can find a way to get out there.
After Jill came out with her new bag we saw Three Brothers and cooked supper with them. They handed us some more beer and we were drunk and content. 
We tried to hike on from the NOC but the beers hit us much harder then usual. We were both a stumbling mess and decided to set up camp before we hurt ourselves.
We set up down by the river. I hung my ursack without issue, but Jill still needed to throw a rope up over a tree and hang hers. I'm so happy I went with the ursack, and they're not even paying me to say that, it's so much easier. 
Jill tried a few different limbs and branches but they were too high up. Finally I found one on the side of a steep hill. Jill fired the rope up over and tried to wall down to it, but lost her inebriated footing on the slope and lost control of her food bag. It tumbled down the hill, bouncing off trees and rocks all the way, and rolled out of sight of our headlamps. 
Jill gave a few exclamations but climbed her way down to retrieve the bag, thankfully it hadn't quite made it to the river. We stayed up late and looked at the stars. It was a good day, if a low mileage one.","Wesser Bald Shelter

The hike out of the NOC is no joke. It reminded me of hiking out west, where you just continously climb all day for miles. The top was over 4,000 feet above where we started. 
At one point I ended up behind a lady who was wearing headphones. I couldn't get her attention to pass her so I simply followed her for a while, until she pulled out her phone to take a selfie. I waved in the background and scared the loving hell out of her.
I got to camp first and was getting worried when Jill wasn't showing up. I waited and watched and finally she came into camp, and much to my surprise Tom and Morgan soon followed. 
Jill had some trouble hanging her bear bag again. She got it up over the branch but the rock remained out of reach and wouldn't come down,, so I hoisted her up on my shoulders and we got it down..

I rescheduled my covid shot appointment for the next morning and hitched into town with Jill and a girl named Paradox.
Paradox had never hitchhiked before. I showed her the basics, and she accidentally stuck her thumb out for a car going the wrong way. Soon a truck stopped and we rode in the bed.

This morning I got my first covid shot. I've never been happier to be stabbed by a needle in my life. I've still got over a month until I'll be fully vaccinated, but at least I've started getting away from this hell inducing disease.
After waiting 15 minutes to make sure I didn't die (I didn't) I bought a new smart water bottle (the black one this time so it wouldn't be identical to everyone else's) and left the store. 
Jill and I stuck our thumbs out and the first car that passed stopped for us. It was a kind older lady who drove us back up to the pass. 
We left the pass and climbed for a few miles. We both wanted to get to the Fontana Dam Shelter but since it was already 1 we didn't know if we could get 15 miles done. 
I told Jill while we walked that the night before I had averaged our miles so far and they only came out to about a 7 mile a day average. We would need to bump up those numbers, those are rookie numbers. 
The weather was pleasant and I was well fed on pizza and happy. Nevermind the extra food weight, I was just happy to be back on trail.

Mile 163.8 to Mollies Ridge Shelter
We left camp this morning a little after 9:30. The rest of the hike down to Fontana Marina was pretty simple and straightforward. 
At the marina, we considered hitching to town since I am almost out of butane and Jill needs a new filter, but we found butane in the marina and kept on.
We passed the famous ""Fontana Hilton"" shelter and found Bushwack there with a terrible hangover. He said the shelter and tentsites were packed and there was a lot of beer going around. This is also one of the few shelters with a showerhouse. I'm sorry we missed it. 
The trail followed a paved road for some time. We found a box of food sitting on the trail and thought it to be trail magic. Jill started digging through to see what she could find when a woman yelled ""Hey!"" And chased us away from her food.
The Fontana Dam is the largest on this side of the rockies and is a formidable sight. It's also the gateway to the Smokies when you go northbound. 
Before making the dam crossing we made many dam talks and dam jokes. We stopped at the dam visitor center, read some dam signs, and learned some dam information. Brenna was there, and I told her I was dam glad to see here. 
Jill, Brenna, and I crossed the dam and dropped off our permits in the dropbox. From there it was all uphill. 
Today and yesterday were our two longest days, and this was one of the longest stretches of uphill we had seen since getting on the trail. Combine that with my arm being stiff from my covid shot and it was a rough day. 
At the top of Shuckstack there was a side trail that led up to an old abandoned fire tower. Brenna's bag was there and took mine off and went up. 
The difference without the pack is incredible. Suddenly I am light as air, nothing tires me or slows me down, I feel unstoppable. 
The tower rose to more then double the height of the trees around it. I carefully made my way up the steep, winding stairways to the top. 
The top was a small, square, wooden box shape. The wind howled through the broken windows and the tower swayed. 
The tower gave us our first good view of the smokies, rising high above out ahead, and revealed a lot more climbing to go. My legs were shaking as I made my way down.
The last few miles were a hard slog, occasi alleviated by fields of little white flowers growing under the trees.
At the shelter a strong combined with cold air. I leaned in toward the fire as a girl named Otter handed out hot rocks to everyone to warm our hands. We all discussed the togetherness that hiking brings and slowly were lured back to our sleeping bags by the cold and wind.","Mile 163.8

Mollies Ridge Shelter to Derrick Knob Shelter
Woke up this morning with a strong aversion to getting out of my hammock. I forced myself up and packed up. I was slow moving right from the start.
It was a cold morning so I started hiking in thermals then slowly took them off as I went. 
Jill and Brenna went out ahead of my and I didn't catch up to them all day. 
This was perhaps the most scenic stretch of trail I've seen yet. Each peak is wide open, with a brushy grassy top and views in every direction. Even the gaps are full of flowers and meadows. The smokies are downright paradisical, even if they are cold and suffer from a lack of water.
I crossed Rocky Top and wondered if it was the one from the song, then Thunderhead.
I caught up to Mel (who was putting in a 17 mile day) and hiked with her a bit. It's the first I've seen her since Baltimore Jack's. 
Next I caught up with a woman who seemed to be in the thick of a mental breakdown. She screamed and cried out that she hated this trail and life in general. I thought this was as good a way of dealing with the trail as any so I offered her some encouraging words and told her she could make it to camp. 
I made it to camp myself at a decent hour. The scene was the same as last night's, Otter and Meatsicle throwing rocks in the fire and handing them out, Misha and Practice huddled close to the fire, Jill and Brenna off cooking. Honey Badger lit her hair on fire with her stove and the smell filled the air around the shelter. I told her not to worry since it would grow back by the time she reached Katahdin. 
The girl who was screaming (didn't get her name) came into camp and was followed by Sourdough, a man who I don't fully understand. Sourdough is dressed as if he just came home from WW2 and is baking his own bread on the trail. He carries no stove and cooks in the fire. His bag looks like it's from the 50s. He walked down off the mountain today to some picnic area,, adding over ten miles to his day,, and noone knows why.. I'll have to speak with him more and find out what exactly his deal is. Seems like a nice guy.
A few trail runners came in and said they had run 37 miles today. 
It's another cold night but (knock on wood) I haven't been cold in my hammock for some time. I'm finally getting it down. Layering the asspads under me, sleeping in my liner, and making sure I have the perfect lay so I'm firmly on top of my insulation are all helping.","Mollies Ridge Shelter

Derrick Knob Shelter to Mt. Collins Shelter
I woke up to snow hitting the outside of my tarp this morning. I stayed in my hammock until it stopped, then got out and packed up as quickly as I could before the next bout came through. Just as I packed the last of my hammock into my bag, it started sleeting and raining and I ran under the shelter. 
I hid under there with Honeybadger, Bushwack, Sourdough, and Papa Smurf. We all did our very best to stall. I stretched and ate breakfast, Honeybadger fooled with her rainwear, Papa Smurf told stories, Sourdough just gave a determined look to the sky and set off. He is clearly the bravest of us. Honeybadger and Bushwack went next, but I stayed and talked to Papa Smurf.
He is 71 years old and hiking to raise money for a fund that is looking for a cure for melanoma, which his wife died of a year ago. His son is also maintaining a youtube channel for him.
I left the shelter and the rain ceased immediately. I smiled at my luck and hiked on in dry raingear. 
I got sleeted on for a second but otherwise the day was dry and cloudy. At some point the trail seemed to curve around and do a complete 180. My sense of direction fell away as I swore I was walking southbound. I couldn't see any blazes and thought I might be off trail, but guthooks confirmed I was on trail and hiking north. 
At the next shelter I found everyone eating lunch. I asked if anyone else had that same sense of disorientation, but apparently noone had. 
Sourdough left the shelter and I asked if anyone knew why he was dressed like a veteran of the world wars. Happy Feet said ""he says that just makes sense to him."" 
The trail passed another mountain named Silers Bald. The AT is terribly repetitive I've noticed. Several Silers Balds, multiple Deep Gaps, but nothing can compare to Sassafras Gap. Assume any Gap may be Sassafras. Sassafrass abound. The three assurances in life are now death, taxes, and Sassafras Gap. They are everywhere.
Honeybadger and Bushwack sat at the next shelter and I could hear them laughing from a mile away and for a mile past. They were suspiciously happy. I've decided I like them. 
The forests today were the most impressive I've seen. Deep, dark, mossy pine forests, they look like they could be the homes of elves and dwarves. It was like hiking through Mirkwood, I felt like a hobbit. The sun barely reached through the pines, and the miss ruled the damp Earth.
From there I was climbing up toward Clingmans Dome, the highest point on the AT and if some random kid at the top is to be believed the highest in Tennessee. 
Happy Feet and Jill caught up and we went to the top of the tower together and looked out in all directions. I wondered briefly if at some point millions of years ago Clingmans Dome might have been the highest point on Earth. I'm no geologist, but with the age of these mountains and the height it reaches, why not let's think it may have. 
From there it was all downhill to the shelter. Mt Collins Shelter is actually a half mile off the trail, in another of these mysterious pine forests. 
It was Happy Feets birthday today, and Sourdough made her a cupcake, wrote her a poem, and made a card for everyone to sign. He even put a stick of fire starter in the cupcake for a candle. We all sang happy birthday and Sourdough recited his poem. 
More intel on Sourdough, it turns out he broke his glasses and can't see a thing. Another hiker, Ken, let him borrow his and oddly enough they were close enough that Sourdough could see, and he took in all of our faces for the first time. The mystery deepens with this man. 
I made an entire packet of Idahon Mashed potatoes for supper.","Derrick Knob Shelter

The only downside to sleeping in the pine forest last night was the dampness. I woke up cold and wet, with condensation soaking my quilt and my thermals.
I warmed up by the fire and struck up a conversation with Honeybadger. It turns out she used to work in the Tetons and we've hiked a lot of the same trails there. We wondered aloud if we had ever run into eachother there. 
I tore down camp and warmed myself again, this time with Sourdough. I started a talk with him hoping to uncover yet another gem in this goldmine of a human and sure enough I struck pay dirt. It turns out the man is fluent in Tibetan and used to do translation work, he even knows three monks in New York and plans to visit them. I continue to be infatuated with this kindhearted giggling madman. As far as I can tell he is good and kind with every ounce of his soul. 
I left the trail ahead of Jill and came out at Newfound Gap just as everyone was getting in the back of a pickup to ride to town. I waved goodbye and waited for Jill, who only took another two minutes to appear. We hitched a ride and enjoyed a leisurely cruise down off the mountain in the bed of a pickup. 
We got to Gatlinburg and met up with everyone at the NOC. We dropped our packs and the whole group decided to go to Mellow Mushroom for pizza. There was a thirty minute wait so we went to the moonshine distillery first and did a tasting, which got us all instantly drunk. 
Next at the Mushroom we got apps and a few pitchers of beer. Me, Otter, and Honeybadger went out on the deck for a safety meeting, and Misha, Practice, Bushwack, and Popsicle went out for their own as well. We all got pizzas (I ate a whole one myself) and after the meal my drunk mind got an idea.
I unscrewed the cap to the crushed red pepper and poured it out onto a napkin. I wrapped the napkin up, twisted another napkin around it, and shoved it in my pocket. Then I did the same with the parmesan and the rest of the condiments. The rest of the table laughed like lunatics and said they'd probably give me some to go. I said that was nonsense. Practice called me a smuggler and I stopped. 
""Smuggler,"" I said, trying the word out, seeing how it sat on my tongue.
""Smuggler,"" Practice said, just as contemplative.
""Smuggles?"" Honeybadger offered.
""Do we like it? Does it work?""
""Hershey is now Smuggler!"" They boldly declared. 
And so it was, Smuggler or Smuggles, either one will do. I at last have a trail name.
We resupplied, I bought my usual too much, and Jill and I hitched back to the trail. 
Most impressive from the Gap was a sign that read ""Katahdin Maine 1972.0"". We have less than 2,000 miles to go.","Mt Collins Shelter

Icewater Spring Shelter to Tri-Corner Knob Shelter
There was some strange animal belting out a screeching bark throughout the campsite all last night, circling my hammock and barking out at me. He interrupted what was an otherwise deep and restful sleep. 
This morning it was snowing on my tarp again and again I waited it out, refusing to budge until this precipitation ceased. 
Jill lifted her tent and shook it vigorously to spill the dirt out. I laughed watching her do this, and told her she looked like King Kong destroying a building. She may want King Kong as her trail name.
Today it was freezing cold with an icy, frigid wind in Tennessee, and a sunny baking heat in North Carolina, and whatever side of the Ridge I went to, that's the weather I felt. It was an entire day of sweating and freezing, jacket on, jacket off.
Early on we came to a little side trail to Charlie's Bunion, a rather creatively named rock outcropping. I climbed up to the top while Jill ran out on a lower rock.
My Dad called me around one and I stopped on the Ridge and talked with him for over an hour. He's coming down and hiking with me in a week, and needs help getting his pack together. 
The call set me back a bit so I tried my best to keep up a fast pace for the rest of the day. The effort drained me a bit and by the time I got to camp I was ready to turn in and call it a day. 
It is supposed to be even colder tonight. Another hammocker showed me a trick. On the really cold night, if there's no chance of rain or heavy wind, she just drapes her rainfly over her hammock, and apparently it hold the heat better this way. I'm going to try it and see how it works. 
At dinner some guy was telling a story about someone he met earlier on the trail who played the most lovely classical guitar he'd ever heard. He said this stranger was serenading everyone with Bach and other classic composers. What was this guitar players name? Sourdough.

Tri-corner Knob Shelter to Davenport Gap Shelter
As is my habit, I was the last to leave camp today. It was brisk, but sunny and really not too bad.
Where as the first day in the Smokies was a never ending ascent, today was a forever descent. As the altitude lowered it got warmer and warmer. I finally thawed out. For the first time in days I took off my thermal pants and discovered that my underwear had been inside out the entire time. 
I left the dark pines, then got into rows of rhododendron, then back to the lower hardwood forests. I drank an entire bottle of water, finally not so cold I dreaded stopping to filter.
It's amazing how much self care takes a backseat when it's cold out. For the past week I haven't been brushing my teeth in the mornings, taking my socks off at all, I discovered tge bandaid from my covid shot still on my arm after six days. Now 
All my old and happy habits can return.
Just then I thought to take a look at the weather and see how it would be these next few lower altitude days. And wouldn't you know it, the temperature is plummeting to 21 degrees and there's a chance of snow tomorrow morning. It would appear I get this one evening to enjoy and then it's right back to Smokies level cold.
It's actually a stroke of great fortune that I'm leaving the highlands before this hits, it's likely to be much worse up high. I hope my group, who is now a full day behind me, makes it through alright.
Jill and I stopped to filter at Cosby Shelter. Cosby is closed because some shoobie left his food in his tent and a bear came and ripped it open. May that fellow stumble on every root.
No sign of the aggressive bear, but the water source was low and impossible to fill my bladder with. I took a rock and dug out a small pool, then took a leaf off a rhododendron and set it above the pool. The result was a mini waterfall off the tip of the leaf that we could fill with.
Today was my longest day on trail so far, almost 15 miles. I stopped and climbed up a rock outcropping near camp and enjoyed the view. 
My inspiration for getting to camp is generally the thought of cooking dinner. Food is a thought that is constantly consuming my mind. I fantasize about food the way I used to fantasize about sex. Suddenly my thoughts are invaded with turkey breasts or chicken thighs or pork loins. Pho all night long. Eating out sounds more and more pleasing to me.. My mouth waters and my stomach growls. This is what hiker hunger feels like. 
The shelter has a fence covering the exposed wall. We all laughed at it, calling it the ""bearacade"" and wondering why this of all shelters should have this cage.
I took advantage of the warm weather to take something close to a bath. I tucked behind a bush and wiped myself down with a wet rag. 
I took off my shoes and socks and noticed that my feet almost look like they are changing shape. The sides are buldging out, maybe swelling or maybe growing some new muscle.
While eating dinner with the lovely and surprisingly small group that had assembled, a guy came running over and said there was a bear just below our shelter. I ran over to the hill and there stood a large momma with her cub. The whole shelter erupted in a series of oohs and awwws, myself included, until we all turned our thoughts to our tents which lay directly in the momma bears path.
At that point we all somehow simultaneously decided that with tomorrow's rain and cold it would be a great night to sleep in the shelter. Everyone ran for their tents and started packing them up as fast as they could. As the bear and cub got closer one camper just grabbed her entire tent and ran with it.
I took my hammock and strung it from the rafters, following the example of Amazon who did the same with her hammock. With everyone safely inside we bolted the door and now hope to have a bear free night.","Tricorner Knob Shelter

Jill, Outback, and I waited in the shelter when it started to rain. Stalling under the shelter roofs has become my specialty.
I made the first move and ran out into the misty drizzle.
There was a waterfall just before the end of the smokies.
I dropped my second half of my permit in the box as I left the park (which I'm still not sure was neccessary but I needed to get rid of it anyhow) and stepped out of the smokies.
I felt accomplished, but sad in a way. The Smokies have been my favorite part of the trail so far, with their mysterious forests and steep mountains and panoramic views. Still, completing them was something to be proud of. I'm that much closer to Maine, another section down.
The trail followed the road for a little ways, on a bridge across a river and then to an underpass under I-40. I stopped at the underpass and decided to have lunch.
With the interstate humming above me protecting me from the rain, and grabbed a few candy bars and a poptart and set about eating. A few cars rolled by and slowed, giving me odd looks, probably assuming I was homeless, which is arguably true. One car stopped and Amazon stuck her head out and asked if I needed a ride. I was tempted to take up her offer but I declined.
Jill caught up to me and together we went a few more miles until the trail came to a dirt road. Turn right for the AT, turn left for Standing Bear Hostel. We turned left.
Standing Bear was interesting to say the least. It had a bit of a culty feel when we rolled in, everywhere were strange, lost looking people, some hikers others just random loiterers. Everyone was smoking pot on the porches hiding from the rain.
We had read that we could resupply and were given a sheet of paper and told to write down whatever we took and venmo them. Quite a few of the items being sold were more than a year expired. 
I warmed myself by the fire, bought a few things, felt generally uncomfortable and decided it was time to get going. I did however run into Chopsticks there, always a pleasure to see that guy.
Hikers that spent the night there had horror stories for me, how the owner was so stoned and belligerent he was accusing people of not paying or selling things for different prices. One guy called it the hostel from hell. I thought that was a bit harsh, truth be told I kinda liked it. 
The one suspicious thing was that all the workers were extremely protective of the main houses porch. We were all told time and time again not to step on the porch. When I went to pay the girl who was taking my money jumped up there and I went to follow and she frantically told me to stop and stay off the porch. What are these people hiding?
After Standing Bear I had to switch to a new section on my Guthooks app. The first map only stretched as far as Standing Bear, now on to section two.
The trail climbed and climbed on the slopes of Snowbird Mountain, and the mountain lived up to its name. For one thing, I saw turkey tracks, for another, the higher I went the thicker the snow got. It clung to the trees and bushes, and coated the trail. It was a heavy wet snow, the kind that soaks your shoes when you walk through it.
Snowbird was a bald, and at the top was a humming, round building that looked like an alien spaceship. Hoping to follow my Hitchhiker's Guide fantasies and ideally leave Earth forever, I walked up to the UFO only to disappointedly realize it was merely an air traffic control tower. A bog sign read ""no trespassing"". I walked around the sign and enjoyed the view. 
Down the other side it wasn't as snowy, and near the bottom the snow vanished entirely. According to the comments on guthooks, the next shelter has a bear problem. Bear have been coming in most nights, stealing food and harassing campers. I decided this would be the perfect place to spend the night.
I rolled in to the shelter and found a couple that had been there all day, pulling a zero with the cold rain. I set about getting a fire lit. The rain and snow had stopped but it was entirely too cold for anything to be done. I managed to get the wet wood to light and everyone gathered round, first Yogi and Boo Boo, then Outback and Amazon, and then finally Jill came into camp. 
I was so hungry today I made two dinners. The first was a dehydrated backpacker meal, the second was Ramen with peanut butter and cashew in it (highly recommend). 
I hung my ursack on the bear poles just to be safe, if this bear is as bad as everyone says I'm taking no chances. Amazon and I hung our hammocks inside the shelter above everyone again, and Jill didn't bother setting up her tent and instead laid in with Outback. Hopefully the bear stays away. We've decided that the safeword is whiskey.
UPDATE: 
The time is now 3 am
""ughhh if anyone's awake the bear is here""
Silence 
Me: ""WHAT!?""
""Yep, this is happening""
""WHISKEY, WHISKEY""
""I SEE THEM! THERES AT LEAST THREE""
""Oh yeah they're messing with the bear cables""
ME: ""Did they get the food?""
""ALL THE BOTTLES ARE OFF THE TABLE!""
ME: ""My hammock is against the table!""
The entire shelter is now awake. We are shining lights with eyes looking at us from the trees. Yogi and Boo Boo, who were sleeping in their tent, have made a break for the shelter at the mention of the safeword and are joining the ranks in the shelter. Of course my hammock is on the outside of the shelter.
""THEY RIPPED DOWN THE BEAR SIGN!!""
""They what?""
""THE BEAR WARNING SIGNS, THEY LITTERALLY RIPPED THEM DOWN!""
ME: ""That's all they came in for""
""Damn they guy just came and hung them today, he had a broken foot too, he's gonna have to hike out here with a stapler again""
""They hate this propaganda""
""These are some hyper intelligent, intellectual type bears""

Groundhog Creek Shelter to Walnut Creek Shelter 
This morning was another freezing cold one. I'm actually starting to enjoy sleeping in the shelters and waking with the group. I stuck my head out as everyone was discussing last night's bear encounter. Apparently the signs that the bear tore down were placed there by a guy with a broken foot who hobbled the whole way in here. Rocky put the torn signs in his pack as souvenirs.
I left camp third to last this time, leaving Jill and Outback behind. Up over one freezing mountain, down the sunny and warm other side. Then back up a snowy and frozen mountainside, and down the clear and dry other side into the Gap. 
There at the bottom was a single pickup on the dirt road, from which a woman emerged and shouted ""hi there! You want some trail magic?""
I watched as she lined up about 25 Subway boxes and lifted out a tremendous cooler. I grabbed a turkey sandwich and a yoo-hoo (they still make those things?) 
She went all out. She even got the chips and the cookie. It was a feast. I took a Gatorade to go and hiked up over the net mountain, bundled now to keep the frigid wind off me. Jill caught up to me just as we were climbing up to Max Patch.
Max Patch is paradise, heaven on Earth. A 300 acre bald with exquisite views in every direction. Highly recommended. 
We saw Yogi and Bear Watch (Boo Boo has changed her name) and I told them they missed the Subway sandwichs.
From there the trail descended and then stayed level for most of the day. Easiest hiking we've seen in a long time. 
We passed by a tent and saw our friends gathered around it and decided to go up and join. An Australian Shephard ran out and greeted me. We played and I gave him a belly rub. 
The owner of the tent was a guy named Poet, and he had a bag of wine which he filled my now empty Gatorade bottle with. Poet owns a hostel near the hundred mile wilderness and we promised to come and stay with him.
The wine kicked me into maximum overdrive and I ran up the final climb to the shelter, where Amazon had a blazing fire. 
We cooked, I ate two suppers, and Jill wandered off to make a phone call. She then came running back and said ""not to freak anyone out, but there's four bears over there.""
We all jumped up and ran over to them. Across the hill was a massive mama bear with three second year cubs. That's three days in a row now we've had bears in camp.","Groundhog Creek Shelter

Walnut Creek Shelter to Deer Park Mountain Shelter 
Last night was among my worse nights of sleep. Tucked in to the crowded shelter, my hammock just a little too low so that I would touch the floor if I laid wrong, I was sandwiched between Amazon and Outback. Outback would move, wake me up, and nudge me over toward Amazon, who was in her own hammock and resting against me. Nudging toward her would cause her to start ruching around and she would nudge me back toward Outback, and the process repeated throughout the night. Twice Outback managed to knee me in the face. Halfway through the night, the odd position I had to lay in made my hip sore. It was agonizing and I couldn't wait to get up and strike a half pigeon pose to stretch it out.
On top of that, it was colder than expected in the morning. It was a hard day to wake up.
It was hard to get up and moving, but despite the lack of sleep, today was a joyous and beautiful day. Somehow I felt great after that restless night. My spirits were high, my energy was high, the temperatures were low but not too low. 
I climbed over Bluff Mountain and down the other side without any trouble. Things are greening up fast and it's making the forests particularly vibrant.
On the way down I passed some day hikers who asked for my name. 
""Smuggler"", I replied without hesitation. It struck me then that I was fully committed to my trail name, another name in my ever growing list of identities. Hershey was my name off the trail everywhere but my home town. It's a name I started using my first day in Yellowstone seven years ago. It was somewhat of a reinvention of myself. 
I grew up as Zach. I never cared for the name. It's short, sort of barkish and aggressive to pronounce, not at all pleasing to the ear. Even worse was the person attached to the name. Moving to Yellowstone was a chance to change who I was. Zach was timid and quiet, he had narrow horizons and didn't see or know much about the world around him. Hershey was bold, even when it made him look foolish. Suddenly I was able to make friends, to go on adventures and tell stories and make people laugh. Hershey was the sort to ride motorbikes in Vietnam or lead a lost group out of a deadly dark wilderness in the night or be arrested for swimming naked with a beautiful woman in the moonlight. He was a bellhop,, able to carrying his own baggage as well as everyone else's around him..
Hershey was a much needed change and I refused to go back. I now tell people that Hershey Jah-phealz Porterwhiffer is my real name, because, to me at least, it is. 
Of course that's ridiculous, I'm just me no matter what I call myself. Still, when I go home and am called once more by that accursed childhood name, it's incredible how fast I slink back into my old shy and timid ways, back to my old habits. There's more to a name then just a label I suppose. Now how was I going to take this new handle, who was Smuggler going to be? Another personality, another reinvention to fix all the messes Hershey made? Or just a label for more of my antics? We shall see.
Anyway, I crossed the gap, climbed over a smaller mountain and got to the shelter, finding only Amazon with her hammock set in the shelter suspended from the rafters. I set mine out on the trees, ready for my own space after last night's travesty of a sleep. 
Despite my best efforts, I ate all my food and left nothing for the morning. We are only three miles from Hot Springs (the first town going north that the trail actually passes directly through) and hunger will have to be my motivation. 
Amazon built a fire as Jill and Outback rolled in. Then to all of our surprise Happy Feet came into camp, followed a half hour later by Ivy League. 
We all gathered around the fire, talking and joking and telling stories. Amazon asked us for our highs and lows for the day. For threw pine needles in the fire just to watch them burn. Amazon said it was like the fourth of July and we all randomly started singing Grand Old Flag. When that was over we all sang The Star Spangled Banner. We've all lost our minds clearly but after the singing in the silence we all thought we heard something echoing through the trees. A whistle? No, the notes were too deliberate and quickly changing. A harmonica? Happy Feet and I walked closer toward it and distinctly heard a fiddle. Who was playing a fiddle so far out in the mountains was beyond us. I tried yelling out to the mysterious musician but got no reply. It was so far away it didn't seem to ce from any one spot. It just hung in the trees, a mere whisper in the air. The Southern Appalachians sing to you.
We were nearly out of wood for the fire, so Putback suggested a simple contest, whoever brought back the most would would win. Win what you ask? Absolutely nothing it would appear. 
Everyone scattered out of sight to scavenge all the wood they could. I refused to be defeated and knew running into the woods at random was a losing venture. I  found a fallen tree broken in half right in camp and was able to drag it over to the fire pit. Still not confident of my chances, I ran down. The hill and got ahold lf an entire tree that had fallen. I pulled with all my might but it would just barely budge. I looked at Ivy League, who was sitting this contest out and cooking dinner. 
""Hey Ivy, do you have a second?"" 
He did, and he ran down to me and hoisted the end of the log on his shoulder. I grabbed the root ball and together we carried the dead tree into camp. My other campmates returned with sorry looking bundles in their hands and stood mouth agape at the two trees laying at the fire pit. They were completely impractical for firewood of course, but they had won our little tournament.
We stayed up until after 9 then laughed at how absurd it was to think 9 is late.","Walnut Creek Shelter

This morning I awoke in my hammock dreadingthe thought of facing the torrential downpour that was beating away at my tarp.
""Three miles, that's all you have to do, three miles then it's breakfast and a shower."" 
I saw Jill emerge from her tent and then looked over and everyone in the shelter was already gone. I put on my rain gear, packed away the quilts and the hammock and ran my bag over to the shelter, leaving only the tarp standing. I already felt wet and cold. 
Jill left as I stuffed the tarp into my packs mesh, not bothering with the stuff sack. I bravely stepped out into the pouring rain with my head down and marched my way toward Hot Springs. 
What the trail was like, I really don't know. I didn't bother looking. Today was simply about moving and getting to town before I got too cold.
Hot Springs is the first town going NOBO that the trail leads directly into. In fact the main street sidewalk is literally the trail. It's a charming, friendly southern town that welcomes us hiker folk every year. 
I stood on the trail on the rain as I came into town. A voice from my left yelled ""Smuggler!"" and I recognized it as Outback's. There it was, the Laughing Heart Hostel. 
We were too early to check in so Outback, Jill, Yogi, Bear Watch, Happy Feet, and I all went to the Smoky Mountain Diner and had a life changing breakfast. It was the most I had ever eaten for breakfast, which is saying something. 
Next we went back and got checked in and I grabbed some town clothes off the rack. Rocky and Switz were also there. So was Chopsticks. This was bound to be a good night.
First things first, I hadn't had a shower in 11 days. I stepped in and turned the hot water knob and my knees went weak. It's incredible just how much you come to appreciate heated water when you live full time in the woods. I pulled the rats nest out of my hair and got Switz to braid it. She asked what kind of braid, I said ""go crazy, have fun.""
""Viking braids it is"" she replied and twisted up my hair in less then a minute. 
With borrowed pajamas and Viking hair I tackled the town. I resupplied and brought back my groceries when I found Tom and Morgan in the hostel.
I ran and hugged them, thinking they were still a full day behind us. 
While I was gone, Indy, who is an Australian Shepherd, jumped onto Switz and chipped her tooth. She was grinding away at it with a nail file she found in the hiker box, trying to smooth out the now sharp edge. The sound of file on tooth echoed through the halls and made everyone cower and cringe. Switz laughed madly as everyone shrunk away, tickled by her newfound power.
We all put on borrowed pajamas and went to the brewery. I got a beer, then a flight, then a guitar player and a woman with a wash tub bass took the stage and Amazon's heart practically exploded when they started yodeling. I had more beer. And tacos.
Outback and I were properly hammered. Tom and Morgan wanted more food and whiskey, so we all went to a bar. Turns out this is a ""moist"" county and there's no liquor. We had more beer. 
Outback and I got so drunk we planned a trip to South America. We shook on it, pinky swore, and I even showed her a sacred sign from a cult I may or may not have joined a few years back. 
Apparently I'm going to South America.
""Commit mischief, be a dirtbag!"" I yelled at the empty night streets on the way back to the hostel. Outback found a chicken and hugged it lovingly. 
Rocky and I stayed up late. It was almost midnight before we went to bed, all happily drunk and loving town. I'm in live with Hot Springs, may it stay small and quirky forever. ","Deer Park Mountain Shelter

That's absurd, being on trail makes you use more profanity then you ever have in your life. A combination of no longer needing to impress anyone, comfort with your surroundings, a lot of things to rage on about, and an embrace of the dirtbag life. 
I'm filled with urges to sleep under bridges and hop trains and camp in the post office. This living in the woods and the dirt, hitchhiking to town every few days, it suits me. I may try and go for the PCT or Te Arora next year. We will see. For now, all my focus is on the AT.
Everyone in the hostel woke up with a hangover and got a late start. Jill and I bought some postcards to send back with Tom, who is leaving tomorrow to go back to Yellowstone. His hike is finished. I wrote out a card to my friends at the bell desk, and told them I love them.
We didn't get going until after noon. It was a beautiful day and I was a bit sad to be leaving. I will return to Hot Springs some day soon. 
The hiking was steep and felt harder then usual. I met a dog named Zolly who I am in love with, passed a trout filled pond in the middle of the forest, and walked along some gorgeous, wild country roads. It was a happy day.","Hot Springs

Spring Mountain Shelter to Mile 295.2
This morning I had no urge or need to leave early. I was one of the last awake, took my time, dug a hole for some reason, ate breakfast, had a nice chill time.
Jill did the same. Why were we so relaxed? We each had company on it's way. 
Jill's boyfriend (and one of my best friends) Creech was coming to Allen Gap, and at the same time my own Dad was on his way to the same spot. How on earth these two decided they should visit at the same Gap on the same day at nearly the exact same time is a question we mere mortals cannot answer.
Jill and I made record time to Allen Gap, covering the 3.5 miles in just over an hour.
Jill cussed herself out the entire way because she lost a pair of underwear at the hostel, and losing things seems to be her greatest weakness on the trail.
I arrived first and saw what looked to be the dirtbag version of White Jesus laying facedown alongside the road. I gave a whistle and a blonde head popped up. I ran across the road and embraced my friend. Jill came soon after and did the same. Creech proudly proclaimed that he felt like he never left.
We caught up as much as we could until a car stopped and Dad got out. Creech and Jill both stayed for some time at my dad's house and so knew him well. We all had a great reunion until Creech and Jill headed up over the hill.
Dad is not a hiker. An avid outdoorsman who is at home in the mountains, yes, but not necessarily a hiker. He sewed his own hammock after seeing mine and is now putting it to use. He also had not slept in over 24 hours in his way out of work and down here, so I started us off with low miles. 
It was warn today. I've been hearing from someone or another every day for the past week that ""tonight is the last cold night, after this we can relax and stop sleeping with out filters"" only to discover that the next night was just as cold and I would have to deal with this dribble on my shirt again. Today, however, finally seems to have been the day. It is warm.
We climbed up to the shelter, then saw more climbing ahead so went on for another 3/4 of a mile closer to the top and set up on a knob.
We hung our hammocks, made supper, hung our bear bags, and went to bed early. Tomorrow I will cross the 300 mile mark and we will see how far Dad can make it.
The wind picked up pretty bad after dark, despite the warmth. One of my tarp stakes was pulled out of the ground and flapping in the wind. I had to get out and tighten everything.","Spring Mountain Shelter

Mile 295.2 to Mile 302.6
We started off the day witha small climb. Dad had set his tarp too high and thus caught the worst of last night's wind, having another sleepless night as he laid there shivering. Now only have a few hours total in the last three days, he was struggling a bit. 
We came to a piped spring and filtered some water and he didn't look good. He admitted he felt a little ill but insisted that he would be better once we got going. He collapsed facedown a half mile later and said he had never felt so bad in his life, and that he might throw up. I was concerned and wondered if I would be able to get him out of here or if we would simply have to set up and stay here until he was better. 
Just then he made a miraculous recovery and got back to his feet. He stayed a little weaker then normal for the rest of the day, but was otherwise unaffected. We wondered all day what the cause of this was.
We took a long break at whiterock cliff then climbed up to Big Firescald Knob. Just before the knob was a sign that led to a trail marked ""bad weather bypass"". The first of these I have seen on the AT, I wondered what could lay ahead that they felt a need to make a bypass trail for stormy weather. 
The trail climbed up the Ridge until it turned to a rocky edge with steep drops on both sides. The views were indescribable, and the trail was rough. Rock scrambling was the order of the day up there. The sub beat down oppressively and the only wind could be felt by leaning over the west side of the Ridge. 
Some spots required turning and twisting. 
""I have to do the backwards donkey"", Dad yelled as he turned around and climbed down a rock.
""Whats a backwards donkey!?"" I yelled back.
""I don't know, I just made it up.""
We crossed the mile long Ridge and when the twisting and turning and backwards donkeying was done we found other side of the bypass trail. It's rejoining marked the 300 mile mark. We also saved a salamander who was tangled up in the leaves. 
After that the trail was easy. We cruised along on what was probably the longest stretch of easy flat I've seen since Georgia. 
We passed the shelter, but I didn't care much for the crowd, so we kept on up the hill.
We kept on and found ourselves a gorgeous field about halfway up Big Butt (yes that's what it's called) and set up camp. The sunset was mesmerizing, the fields were lovely (although filled with bear sign), and the night is warm. 
Dad's illness this morning set us back a bit, we will have to make up some more miles tomorrow. ","Mile 295.2

Mile 302.6 to Mile 312.5
Last night some large animal was raoming about our campsite for over an hour. Probably another bear, based on the ample bear sign lying about the area and my own tendency to encounter them. He minded his own business and we minded ours and therefore we all got along splendidly and I kept on sleeping, not caring much about it.
It was also the warmest night of sleep I've yet had and probably the warmest morning. I didn't even need my jacket.
I was half awake when a turkey gobble jarred my upright. I ran out of my hammock and over to dad to ask him if he heard it. He had and the turkey repeated his performance. Dad adores turkeys, and is extremely talented at calling to them. We were both hoping to hear one yell one of these mornings. This is the first time heard on trail.
After camp was torn down and our packs were on our backs we began an ascent of Big Butt. Yes, you read that right. There is a mountain here called Big Butt, God bless America. Of course after living in the shadow of the Tetons for several years I'm not surprised (research the meaning of that name if you don't already know it) but none the less I have to draw some attention to this. 
I hiked Big Butt and I cannot lie. Baby got switchbacks. My anaconda don't want none unless you've got blazes hun. She got a big booty so I called her the Appalachian Trail. Other such puns.
Up we went, past another bypass Trail (which was, of course, Big Butt Bypass) and to the top of the mountain. The climbing was rocky but not nearly as bad as yesterday's ridgewalk.
""We might have to do some reverse donkey here""
""Is that different then backwards donkey?""
""Probably not""
All forms of donkey aside, we made it through with no issues. From there the trail is a long flat stretch followed by a well graded descent. 
I checked the log book at Flint Mountain Shelter. Amazon and Outback stayed there two nights ago, and Yogi and Bearwatch had lunch here yesterday and then were headed to a hostel down the trail to ""remind the owner that the Union won the war."" May they succeed, if I was with them I'd smuggle out the man's confederate flag and we could all set it ablaze together, but I've got my dad with and should probably tone down the criminal mischief for now. 
Dad and I went through Devil's Fork Gap (you never see anything called Devil's Spoon do you? The poor man lacks for cutlery in hell I see). At the Gap I found a candy bar by the trail, some leftover trail magic I see. There was also a club soda but who in their righting drinks that? I took the candy bar and left the club soda. 
Our day almost over we hit a wall of a climb. A nearly vertical hollow with a stream tumbling and cascading through in a series of short waterfalls greeted us, and set us sweating. 
The stream is the last water source for five miles, so we found a spot a mile up right next to the water and set up in a Grove of mayapples. 
My most important discovery today was that this journal had a little guest book attached where people can leave me notes, and what do you know, there are two of them, both praising my writings and stories, both saying they are loving keeping up with my hike. What do you know, someone is actually keeping up with my half asleep, typo plagued rambling, even a guy like me can have fans. I will live and die for these two fans. They are now my heart and soul. I litterally love you both, if you're reading this send me your names and I'll get them tattooed on me (I won't actually, but really thank you).","Mile 302.6

We woke up late in the mayapple sight and kept going up the hill. It eased off a but, not nearly as steep as before, and let us catch our breath. At the top Misha caught up and told me he heard there was trail magic at Sam's Gap, 8 miles ahead. I told dad we were making it on time no matter what.
Later at the shelter, Practice caught up. I thanked her for the trail name she gave me and let her know that Smuggler had stuck. She showed me a video of a bear the had gotten into the trash room of her hotel in Gatlinburg. 
Dad and I coasted along the ridges toward Sam's Gap, along the short stretches of old, dilapidated barb wire fences in the middle of the woods. What was everyone trying to keep out? Or was it in? We saw a snake sunning itself on the trail.
At Sam's Gap we found an old man named Bearcrawl who was handing out snacks and drinks and inviting hikers to use his lawn chairs. He was even kind enough to take my trash for me, an angel in its purest form.
From there it was another up and down and we came to the piped spring that we are now calling home. We set up quickly because they were calling for rain overnight, and now we are getting it.
As I lay here typing so peaceably a drop of water has fallen on my forehead. Then another, causing me to jolt. I have a small leak in my tarp it would seem. I'll have to grab some seam sealer in town and try to fix it.","312.5

Mile 323.3 to Spivey Gap
Last night the wind howled like a freight train through camp all night. I had a drip coming through my tarp onto my head, which I blocked with a towel. 
The morning was chilly, but not too cold. The sun was partly out so we stayed in our hammocks and let our tarps dry all morning. 
The wind still raging, we set out for Big Bald. Big Bald is a 5,500 foot peak that towers above all the land around it, dwarfing the other mountains. Dad was worried about crossing the top on such a violently windy day with the possibility of storms, but I assured him I've lived through worse. Somehow he didn't find that particularly comforting but he laughed it off and set out up the mountain with me.
The trick to walking through the woods in the wind is to keep an eye out for dead trees. A strong gust could knock one over onto your head and then you either have a serious problem or no more problems ever again. I eyed the swaying branches as I skipped about. 
Up top past the treeline the wind was strong enough to knock you over. My pack acted like a sail, catching the air and turning me sideways, pushing me off the trail. The view was indescribable. We took a few pictures and ran down. 
The trail had spent the entire morning on the left side of the Ridge, taking the sir pockets full force. Now we finally dipped over the right side and got out of it. We followed the Ridge the rest of the way off the bald and took a steep descent. 
Next came little Bald, which as far as I could tell was neither little nor bald. The trail was straight up and straight down the other side.
Finally came the climb of High Rock, where I tried to climb to the top of the rocks but couldn't quite make it up over the final ledge. 
We caught up with Practice and told her Dad was parked at Spivey Gap and we were headed to Erwin for the night and slackpacking the section tomorrow. I invited her to join and she accepted, admitting she was out of food and would be having a hungry night otherwise. 
The three of us went down to the Gap and found a guy in a van cooking quesadillas and handing out beer. I liked him.
From there we dropped off Practice and got a room, skipping out on tonight's predicted frigidness in favor of the comforts of civilization. I've got two days of slackpacking ahead of me and plan on trying to crank out some 20s while I have the chance. 
We ran into Rocky and Switz at the hotel and offered to slackpack them as well, but they refused, both of them feeling obligated to carry there full packs every mile of the trail. I wish them luck with that, I'm going light.","Mile 323.3

In the morning, Dad ran me out to Spivey after I did a bit of light smuggling at the continental breakfast at the Super 8. Practice texted me and said she was taking a zero today, so I was on my own for the slackpack.
We got back to Spivey Gap (proper pronunciation heavily debated) and found Morgan sitting with the quesadilla guy, who was still chilling in his van cooking for whoever passed by. We had a fine little reunion and ultimately decided that she should slackpack as well. Dad took her bag and put it in his truck and then hiked up about a half a mile with us before turning back around.
My plan for the day was to hike the 12 miles to Erwin where I would meet Dad for lunch and then hike another 8 miles, still packless, while Dad drove around and set up camp. 
Without the weight of our backpacks slowing us down Morgan and I made great time. We discussed our last few days, who we had been hiking with, what we had seen, talked about the merits of kilts, the trails ability to remove all modesty and filters from those who hike, more such fringe science. 
I stumbled over a snake that lay sunning itself on the path. I saw it slither out from under my feet and tried my hardest not to step on the poor little guy. He said his way back to his snake hole, annoyed but otherwise unharmed.
Things that make me happy on the trail. One is when the blazes are on things other then trees. Rocks are the next most common place to find them, but I've also seen them on trashcans, light posts, guardrails, streets, sidewalks, and even people. Another is finding a downed tree with a blaze on it. I like the sound my trekking poles make when they strike hard surfaces, I like reading the trail logs, especially whoever keeps drawing the comics, and most of all I like the community. We are all odd on some level. That's why were here. If you find a normal hiker, you just haven't gotten to know them well enough. It's such a joy to be amongst people as odd as me.
We got into Erwin where I found Dad drinking beer and handing out trail magic with Practice and Paradox. Dad had been having a busy day. After leaving us at Spivey, he found Paradox at the Gap in need of a ride. He drove her to the Super 8 where he found Rocky, Switz, and Ninja, all needing a ride back to the trail. Back at the trail he found Practice, who needed a ride into town to resupply, so he took her and paradox to Walmart where he felt the urge to buy lawn chairs, beer, apples, oranges, and oatmeal creme pies. He took the girls back to the trail and the three of them set up and started handing out food to the hikers and had been there for about an hour when I showed up and fully partook in the magic. 
I hung out, shared stories with Paradox, who I haven't seen since teaching her how to hitchhike in Robbinsville, and talked with Practice and whoever else came through. Jill and Creech texted me then asking if I wanted to join them for dinner, and since I haven't been seeing Creech much lately (we spent nearly every day together for over two years but this past winter I only got to see him twice) I decoded my plans for i more miles were being scrapped. We all went out for pizza and enjoyed the company.
Dad dropped everyone off where they needed to go then we drive around to Indian Grave Gap because we heard that there was a nice campsite here. We made a fire and stayed up and finally went to sleep.
There is no chance of rain and fairly warm temperatures tonight so I've decided to try my luck sleeping without the tarp.

Dad drove me back to the trail in the morning. I stopped over and said goodbye to Creech and wished him a good drive back to Jackson Hole. 
Dad slackpacked Morgan, Jill, and I again. I left ahead of everyone and climbed out of Erwin in the hot and humid air. It was so hot I took my shirt off and hiked in just my shorts all day. I wish it was more acceptable to take my pants off, I can't wait for hike naked day. I need to get that kilt.
Near the Gap I saw a cross in the woods and some freshly disturbed dirt. A small note on the cross read ""This is a dog, do not call 911"". 
I found dad posted up above the Gap handing out trail magic to whoever came. He gave me a footlong sub from subway which I ate happily, sat for a while, then proceeded down the trail.
I set foot on the road when I heard dad and the others yelling for me. Apparently Jill and Morgan were closer behind me then I thought. I went back up the trail.
This short section of trail between Indian Grave Gap and the campsite is now by far my most hiked section. I went up and down that hill a total of 11 times between camping there last night and hiking through today.
The three of us pushed on to beauty spot together and came to the road where dad picked me up and took me back to a hotel room. He's leaving tomorrow and wanted to get me a shower before he left. Thanks Dad.

Beauty Spot to Clyde Smith Shelter
Dad dropped me off on Beauty Spot first thing in the morning. I hugged him and said goodbye and he said he would probably see me again in a month or so.
I hiked on and soon dug in my lack for my raingear. The morning was a consistent on/off rain that kept me putting my jacket on and taking it off again for all eternity. It was misty and dreary, but as sunny as it's been those days still seem like a novelty and are not nearly as depressing as one may think.
Maybe a bit annoying though.
I caught up with Jill and Morgan at the next shelter and the three of us hiked on.
We came to some trail magic and stopped and had a soda and some chocolate. It was a nice guy named Kevin who was showing us pictures of Roan Mountain, which we should be crossing tomorrow.
Jill was showing off her new REI co-op pants. I mentioned that I had the exact same pants.
""No you don't,"" she said, looking down at my rainpants which I still wore.
""Well maybe not exactly but they're REI brand""
""They're Marmots,"" she said and pointed to my knee.
""What are you talking about?"" I said and suddenly looked down to see a marmot logo on my knee.
WHAT IS THIS MADNESS?
THIS IS NOT MY BEAUTIFUL HOUSE!
THIS IS NOT MY BEAUTIFUL WIFE!
THESE ARE NOT MY REI CO-OP RAINPANTS.
""Do they fit you?"" Morgan asked with an excited giggle.
""They're a bit big, I thought I was losing weight""
Giggles turned to maniacal laughter. So many questions. Who's pants was I wearing? Where are my pants!? How could this have happened!? Where does that highway go to?
I'm out here with someone else's pants, it must have been that darned sasquatch. 
The rain abated anyway so I stuffed someone else's pants back into my mesh. Anyone on trail, check your pants and make the arrangements, if I see a set of REI co-op rain pants that look a little small on someone they're getting tackled and depantsed, then repantsed. Repent or be repantsed.
By the time we got to the shelter I was exhausted and didn't feel much like mingling. I ate and went right to bed. I wonder how far ahead Amazon and Outback are, I miss hiking with the both of them.","Beauty Spot

A love letter to salamanders:
Oh salamanders, how you brighten my day until it glows nearly as brightly as your skin. You orange spotted amphibians are a such a pure source of joy in my life. We lift you up, call you trail puppies and are awestruck by the way you clumsily crawl over our hands. We lift you off the trail and place you on safer ground out of nothing but love and respect. You are the very embodiment of joy and innocence, the bliss that we all so crave in this cruel and indifferent world. Thank you salamanders, for being one of the truly good things in this evil ridden world.
So yeah, we like salamanders out here. When they are put, the three of us watch every footfall and every pole plant, making sure not to crush the poor little amphibious angels. When we do see one, all progress stops and we move the little orange fellow out off the trail and one to someplace safe. They must be protected at all costs. Save the salamanders.
From the shelter it was a few rolling hills then the two things that defined our day began, the climbing and the rain. 
The climb was well graded, but went on forever. Roan High Knob was 5 miles from the road crossing and uphill the entire way. The rain was unceasing, and nearly unbearable. The trail turned into a creek, small waterfalls cascaded down off the rocks and steps. 
It was the hardest rain I've seen on trail. My jacket soon soaked through. Then my shoes. There are different stages with your shoes in this kind of rain. At first you are dry, or at least it hasn't soaked all the way through yet. Then you are partly wet, still avoiding the puddles and trying to keep your feet dry. Finally, you are simply soaked, and walking through puddles indifferently. I stepped in water well over my ankles. It didn't matter.  Nothing could make my shoes any wetter. 
My jacket soaked through and my short was wet. Just then the wind picked up and the temperature went down. I took off my glasses and put them in my backpack, they were so covered with rain I couldn't see anyway. I hiked blindly with my head down. I remembered then that I hadn't seen Jill or Morgan in a long time, they fell behind. 
Roan High Knob Shelter is the highest Shelter on the AT. I was too miserable to stop. I hiked right on by, intent on getting through the highlands and out to lower and warmer altitudes.
There were no views at the top.
I put my poles away and hiked with my hands in my pants to keep them warm. 
The rain slowed down going over the balds but didn't stop. The wind picked up even worse. It was back to that 'blow you sideways' kind of wind. 
The trail down the other side was slick mud. I had to search for rocks to stand on to keep from sliding down the steep embankment. I passed the next shelter and thought about stopping, but why would I? I was already cold and wet, and wasn't going to get any wetter. Might as well press on to my target for the day.
Just as I made that decision it suddenly got warmer. The sun didn't come out but it shined through the clouds, warming me and drying my shirt strangley quickly. 
The last two miles were the best of the day. Warmth and dryness, both welcomed in like an old friend. I got to the overmountain trail junction and turned right, towards the big red barn. A turkey gobbled and I stopped and made turkey noises at him for a while, listening to more gobbling. 
Down at the barn (which is now ""structurally unsound"" and not to be slept in) I set my hammock up outside and started dinner when an older couple came up. They told the camp, which was only me, Top, and one other guy, that they had beer, chips, and salsa and were there to celebrate an early Cinco de mayo. 
Trail magic like this was exactly what I needed after a day like today. Apparently four hikers were struck by lightning south of here. I was also glad to see Jill and Morgan come into camp and be ha dedicated a beer. 
To top the night off, they both landed their bear hangs in one try.","Clyde Smith Shelter

Overmountain Shelter to Mile 401.2
It was a night of vivid dreaming, deeply asleep but active as ever none the less. One dream saw me as some fantasy hero fighting off some force that couldn't be beat. Every move I'd make, it would close in tighter, like a boa constricter strangling the life away from me, and I was powerless to fight it alone. But I looked aside me and realized I wasn't alone, fighting next to me stood Outback, her pack on her back as usual. Then I looked over my shoulder and saw Jill and Morgan, and Creech and Corey too. Row upon row of my closest companions stood with me, and together we all took a stand, maybe we won, maybe we all went down together. I guess it didn't matter.
I also distinctly remember a dream where I was in some dark decrepit cabin, the kind with a musty, moldy smell and creaky dirty floors. I yanked open the front door and found myself eye to eye with an enormous black bear. It breathed out its nostrils into my face and I slammed the door and awoke with a gasp. 
It was daylight, and it was still raining. I took my pack into the barn to keep it dry and took down my hammock.
Jill was under the roof too, looking out wearily at the persistent precipitation that has been plaguing us.
""I'm so over this rain,"" she said without averting her gaze. I was too. I put on my last pair of dry socks then my soaking wet shoes. 
I climbed back to the trail and a turkey gobbled behind me. I owl-hkoted at him and he screamed again. A section hiker came past me and looked at me like I was crazy. I hooted again and the turkey answered yet again, the section hiker just looked uncomfortable and moved along.
I could see down the valley at first but then the trail climbed into the low clouds and I couldn't see anything more then 20 feet away. It was like the trail was all there was, just a brown path in the middle of some endless expanse of blankness. 
I hiked through the treeless bald, listening for the rumble of thunder and trying to plan some escape route if I heard it. Nothing seemed available, it was flat white in all directions. 
The trail went down a bit, and the wind speed went up. I caught up to Morgan and Jill and we climbed a 500 foot incline together, getting hot with sideways rain the whole way. Next came a strong descent on slick mud. Every step send you slipping and sliding down the path. It was dangerous walking. My shoes soaked through, as usual, and my last pair of socks became soaked. 
We all made it out of the mud and found a short bit of flat trail above a Christmas tree farm. Just then the rain stopped and for a half a second a break came in the clouds and the sun shined through to us. I ripped off my rain jacket and let ut hit my shirt for the few seconds we got it, then the clouds rolled it back up again. Hiding us from the warmth. The rain was still kind enough to keep away.
At the end of a small field was a sign that read ""Leaving NC"". 
After weeks of bouncing between Tennessee and North Carolina, we were finally leaving our second state behind for good. It was Tennessee for the rest of the way to Virginia.
The rain started back up again. We made it to the road where Morgan's Uncle Allen and Aunt Karen were meeting us. 
Allen was a rough voiced, highly energetic, agreeable and fun guy. Karen was quiet but very interested in all that we were going through. They drove us to the grocery store and paid for all of our resupply, then took us to the local restaurant (it's a very small town) and even insisted on buying us all lunch. I was absolutely dumbfounded by their kindness. They wouldn't let me pay a cent. 
In the restaurant, at least two tables of locals were staring at us, listebing to our conversations and hanging on our every word, but too shy to say a thing. They must not see too many hikers. 
Then Allen asked the ultimate question that none of us three know the answer to. ""What are you doing after the trail?""
This question is my most feared. At any point of course I have five or six different ideas floating around in my head. Maybe I would fly to Isreal, do the Isreal National Trail and then go to New Zeland and get the working holiday visa until I save up enough money for the Te Aroara. Or maybe I would got to Jackson Hole and work with Creech and make enough for the PCT. If Covid restrictions keep getting looser I could go on another trip out of the country for the winter, live cheaply in some exotic location and try and make some money online. I should finish the books I've been trying to write, take some wilderness first aid classed or some TEFL courses, or better yet maybe I should actually get around to college for a change, but who knows. Either way, the trail will end someday, and I will continue, live on if I don't die.
I value my freedom to roam above all else in my life, and I find a certain freedom exists in voluntary poverty. I think low income and excessive income grant you the most freedom, middle income is a trap. Something guaranteed to put you on a path to a wholly unremarkable life, which I refuse to have. Excessive wealth is unlikely to ever happen to me, so that leaves a kind of low but strategic income. I don't own a house, I've never even rented an apartment. I live mostly in employee housing and my car. I've gotten good at it, I don't have much to lose, financially speaking. I know how to get by without much, and not just get by, prosper. I'm not afraid to lose what I have, it's more then I need, even if it is less then most people have.
On the other hand, I'm not making much difference in the world. I don't have a job that I can look at and honestly say it's for the betterment of humanity, all I do is convince people they can't carry their own luggage. I'm not using the full power of my own mind, I'm smarter then this, or so I've been told. How do I maintain this lifestyle, this freedom, but also feel like I'm contributing to the collective good of humanity? 
All this bounced around in my head as Allen drove us back to the trail. We hiked on, up over a mountain and past a cemetery. We found a church alongside the road on the other side and filled up our bottles on its spigot. 
A mile or two past that, the number 400 was painted on a tree. 400 miles were done. We were getting somewhere now. After that Jones falls ended the day. They were the largest since Amicolola.
We spot camped and sang songs until well after dark. This was the first night I had to use a headlamp to set up my hammock.","Overmountain Shelter

Mile 401.6 to Mile 416.1
The sun. How happy can a person be to see the sun? How could I possibly explain what a relief it is to see blue skies and sunshine coming down after days of cold and rain. What a relief to grab the socks off my hammock straps and have them be dry for once. I don't care if they are dirty, they are dry.
Even on a sunny day, leaving the hammock is initially tough. My legs are stiff, my feet hurt, it's such a process to get moving. I stumble out of my hammock like a newborn baby giraffe and wait for everything to loosen up. 
As we tore down camp a hiker walked past us. We casually said hello and upon hearing my voice the hiker stopped and stared. I looked up into a familiar face. It was Amazon. 
I yelled and jumped up in surprise, ithought she was still at least half a day ahead of us. She laughed and said the whole crew was still with her, minus Yogi and Bear Watch who were out ahead. We would probably see the rest today.
The trail went down to a river and I thought about how nice it will be once it gets warm enough to swim. 
We hiked on, passed Mountaineer falls (a disturbing name for a waterfall when you think about it) and stopped for lunch. 
A woolen clad soldier stepped down the trail and joined us, it was Sourdough.
He giggled in his own maniacle way and told us how the wood has been too wet for him to build a fire for the past few days, and since he carries no stove he has been unable to cook. He said he has been surviving on hot peppers and raw eggs. I was about to ask why he was bringing hot peppers and raw eggs on the trail, but I held my tongue, knowing I shouldn't bother. Geniuses and madmen should never be questioned, and Sourdough is certainly one of those two, maybe both.
Next down the trail came Outback, with her usual good humor and adventurous nature. She told us about a shelter coming up where raccoons had been stealing people's gear and called it ""Groundhog Creek round 2"". I said I wanted to stay there, she said she knew I would. 
I ate 4 of my sandwichs (tortilla, spinach, pepperjack, pepperoni, sprinkle of Snyders honeymustard and onion pretzel bits, in that exact order, only thing it needs is some honey to round out the flavor with some sweetness, honey will have to be smuggled from a diner). 
We left and Rocky, Switz, and Ninja met us at the next water source. Switz gave me a big hug and said she wanted to camp with us tonight. I walked on with them, leaving Jill and Morgan behind. Rocky said there were confirmed cases of Norovirus at the hostels just behind us. I felt a shudder run through my body. Norovirus is one of my five fears. (Yes I am afraid of 5 things and 5 things only. Those are: bison, norovirus, rental RVs, toilets that won't stop flushing, and one other thing that I keep secret). 
In response to the noro, the three of them are not staying in any shelters until it clears up, and I decided right then I wasn't either. I may not even go to town tomorrow. 
We pressed on, thankful for our health. I explained that if the movie Finding Nemo was about people instead of fish, it would basically be Saving Private Ryan. Rocky talked about how The Lego Movie and The Matrix basically had the same plot. This is considered civilized, high class trail talk. Any talk that doesn't become scatological is considered sophisticated.
We passed Amazon again at a shelter and warned her about the virus then went on to our campsite, a lovely field in a gap in the mountains. We set up in high spirits and just as we finished Rocky looked over and said ""did someone really throw up in our campsite. We all looked over at a fresh pile of vomit next to a tree and realized that it was probably infected with noro. What followed was a series of words from each of us that this website does not allow to be published. We all panicked and tore down our tents and hammocks and ran with them across the field. I hope we all feel okay tomorrow. ","Mile 401.2

Mile 416.1 to Boots Off Hostel
Any time I go backpacking out west, waking up comes with a happy realization, a little surge of joy at the realization that I didn't get eaten by a grizzly bear in my sleep. Today I felt the same way when none of us woke up with noro. 
The rain, on the other hand, seems to hate me. In last night's good weatger and sunshine I decided to hang up my socks to dry, all of them being soaked at this point. During the night, the weather shifted dramatically and it was pouring by the morning, my socks reaching a whole new level of soaking wet just as they were almost getting dry. 
I packed everything away and started hiking to warm my hands. Jill and Morgan left before I even woke up, and Rocky, Switz and Ninja hadn't even torn down their tents yet. 
I passed Outback and then rain turned to hail. I passed the top of the mountain, pelted all the way by the iceballs, and went down the other side.
I tried my best to make up time and catch up to my group. I stuffed the pockets of my rain pants with food so I wouldn't have to stop for lunch and kept going as the rain stopped, the sun came out, and the trail followed a river.
The river walk was flat, but painfully rocky. I found Jill and Morgan having lunch at a waterfall. It seemed so odd that we were now in the thick of so many tremendous waterfalls after weeks of none. 
We kept on along the river, then up over another mountain and into Boots Off Hostel. Supposedly a top five hostel on the AT, I knew the place would be classy as soon as I found a man drinking beer and sitting on a lawnmower (which was not even turned on) sitting in the driveway laughing at his dog. 
The hostel was actually quite nice. Jill and I, fearing the noro, chose to camp outside while Morgan took a spot in the bunk room. There was a shuttle taking people in to town, but it was running late so Jill and I decided to hitchhike. 
After some people blew passed us we ended up getting a ride from a young lady with an AT sticker on her car. Her name was Dirt and she was a former thru hiker. She lived in Damascus and gave us her number and told us to ""call if we needed anything when we passed through"". She also had a banjolele in the backseat she let me pick at while we drive to McDonald's.
That's right, in this town the biggest spot for food in town seemed to be good old Mcdicks.I haven't eaten at a McDonald's (besides breakfast) in years. I don't even like McDonald's (noone should, no hate if you do, but noone should) but today I was so hungry that Mcdicks might as well have been a five star eatery. I got a spicy chicken sandwich, got them to throw on an extra chicken for me, a large fry, an order of Mcnuggets, and a shake. I will admit, it was glorious.
We hit the dollar general then caught a ride back with the hostel van. I gave all my clothes and my waterlogged socks to the hostel to be washed and dried. They needed it desperately, all those days of walking through mud did them no kindness.
Next came the shower. It was a metal bucket with holes punched in the bottom with two pipes running in and mixing, one hot and one cold. The shower room steamed up and I stood under the flowing hot water. It was one of the best showers of my life. 
Clean and without many clothes I went back to the campsite, hung out with Rocky for a bit, played a guitar I found and went to bed in my hammock. ","Mile 416.1

Boots Off Hostel to Mile 441.6
Last night I thought I heard the trash cans get knocked over and someone yell ""get out of here.""
First thing this morning, Rocky came over to my campsite to discuss trail safety. Both of us went up to breakfast and, feeling incredibly safe, I ate three bowls of Captain Crunch and a breakfast burrito. 
We walked out of the hostel and back to the trail, which wound around the lake for a few miles before climbing again.
Some day hikers told me there would be trail magic a mile ahead and I doubled my pace, leaving Jill and Morgan behind. I found the trail magic, along with a fine group of hikers. 
Rocky, Switz and Ninja were there, along with Poet and Scribe. Poet and Scribe are names I've been hearing on the trail but until today I didn't realize that they were, in fact, the two brothers Zach and Rob, which I had met my first night on trail, during the great gathering of the Zachs. 
We all left together, with me leading the way and telling all my favorite stories from the past few years my life: the time I spent three weeks in the desert with a crazy man who tried to perform an exorcism at every illegal and improvised campsite, the time I was lost in grizzly country in the dark for 13 hours trying to lead put my two best friends while they were in the midst of an LSD trip, the time I extorted $401 from a drunk rich woman in a mink fur coat and gave it to a fundraiser for a friend and ended up with a knit hat with a propeller on it, the time a man in India found me freezing to death in his outhouse, all my classics. 
Eventually, the group dispersed and it came down to Switz and I covering those last few miles together. I enjoy Switz's company immensely. Both of us seem to have the same high energy and unshakeable optimism even in the face of our own cynicism. We both like randomly dancing and ""Mountain Polevaulting"" (which is probably very dangerous but come on its so much fun riding downhill with your trekking poles). 
I asked her if her and Rocky were, as the kids say, ""together"". She said not officially but maybe someday, but Katahdin first and foremost. 
At camp I decided to give everyone a crash course in hammocking, a 101 on the pinnacle of human relaxation. Everyone lined up to lay in my warbonnet. Ninja said she could sleep right there, Poet said it was most comfortable thing he'd ever laid in, Switz refused to get out, and even Scribe, who is kind and pleasant but rather quiet and keeps to himself, gave out a hoot of adoration. 
Rocky and I started a tents vs hammocks feed today, exchanging insults and jibes at one another's sleep systems. He said he hoped a squirrel chwed through my suspension, I told him I hoped his tent flooded. He said hammockers were always looking down on tenters, I said that's because we are always hanging above them. We laughed and had a good fight over it, and I said he wasn't allowed in my hammock, but decided to let my new archival see what he's been messing. As soon as he got in he said he was ending the fued right then and there.
I talked with Ninja in camp and asked her how she needed up on the trail. Ninja is a woman in her 40s with a semi serious attitude that betrays her military background, but a welcoming kindness underneath. Shes like a slightly older version of Amazon. She said she had a husband and a well paying government job and was set for life, but always felt this urge to walk away and do the trail. Her husband would get furious and tell her no every time the subject came up. Now she was divorcing him and living her life the way she saw fit. She quit her job and has no idea what she will do after the trail, but she'll figure it out. 
I respect that.
For supper I decided to finish off all my spinach before it gets gross. I've figured out the ultimate trail sandwich. The order is key, you lay out a tortilla, then throw on a handful of spinach, then lay on a slice of pepperjack, finish with a row of pepperoni and a drizzle of honey. Today I didn't have honey so I used some sweet and sour sauce I smuggled out of McDonald's. It was slapping. After that was all gone I made a tin of ramen and some ginger tea. Then, for some reason, I cut up a clove of garlic, put it in water, boiled it, and drank the water. It actually wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, and now garlic tea is a thing. 
When Rocky got in his and Switz's tent I stole his crocs and used a trekking pole to hang them up as high as I could in a tree. Have fun with that tomorrow Rocky.
Jill and Morgan got to camp just as we were all going to bed. Today someone in this group referred to me as a member of their trail family, I swelled up with pride. Rocky and Switz have been calling us ""The Groundhog Group"" after that night of horror with the bears in the Groundhog Creek Shelter. I think we're all happy to feel like we belong. 
There is currently a mouse scurrying through under me and a coyote howling near me. I don't thinkneither are a cause for concern, but the mosue definitely has me more worried. ","Boots Off Hostel

Mile 441.6 to Damascus 
Today I woke up to the sound of Rocky cursing my name and looking for his shoes. It was a happy morning.
I remembered it was mother's day so I called mine, and it turns out she got married yesterday. Her and her new husband had a surprise wedding, telling their parents it was a dinner party. She sounded upset though and I asked her what was wrong. She said the dog was not feeling well and had to go to the vet. Gunner is my original hiking partner and one of my best friends, but he is 12 years old now. I hope for good news from the vet.
I stumbled out of my hammock and fell to the ground, with my long uncombed hair flailing and my sunglasses almost sliding off my face. Rocky was sitting on a stump and looking down at me, ""you look like a Hollywood star that just hit rock bottom,"" he said. I said he was exactly right.
The whole talk around camped this morning was ""30 miles to Damascus"". Everyone wanted to push it and get it done in a day, everyone also severely did not want to do that. 
""Come on, let's do it!!"" 
""I'm not doing it"" came a few replies 
""I'll do it if someone else does,"" said Ninja.
""Fine, I'll go,"" said Rocky
Soon everyone was in agreement, everyone but Jill and Morgan who said we were all crazy, and shouts of ""30 mile day!"" We made as we packed up.
Rocky traded me a vanilla breakfast essential for two slices of pepperjack, and I heated up some water and mixed in the powder and chugged the drink.
""Are you really going to Damascus today?"" Jill asked concerned.
I started jumping up and down, "" I'm all jacked up on Breakfast Essentials, I can do anything!!"" 
We walked out of camp at a brisk pace and set out. Now you may be thinking that bring the responsible adults we all are that we would have set an alarm and made sure to get up early for our 30 mile day, and you would be wrong. If anything, we left camp later than normal and we would get there when we got there.
""Did you have an injury on your right side?"" Ninja asked from behind me.
""What?"" I asked.
""You walk like someone who's had serious trauma on their right side, did you injure yourself?""
"" I had Lyme disease when I was a kid and could walk for a while, my right knee took the worst of it, that and I've had a series of really stupid injuries on my right shoulder and now it dislocates with the slightest breeze. How did you know?""
""It's all in your gait, I had to watch horses gaits and learn how to spot old injuries. Not that you're a horse but it's the same concept with people.""
I was impressed.
""What did you do to your shoulder?"" She asked after a silence, ""what was the stupid injury?""
""It started when I decided to go sledding down a mountain on a giant inflatable duck with four of my friends (rest in peace Ducky), then there was some drunk skiing on an obstacle course, a pinata accident, and a mistake with an ice age when I was coming down from Middle Teton.""
Ninja simply nodded her head in understanding. I liked Ninja a lot, she treated everything with a kind of ""so it is then"" acceptance.
Poet looked at guthooks and said there was a vast cow pasture coming up while Rocky and I filled our water. 
""Are there cows in it?"" I asked.
""I think so"", he answered.
""Man, you know what I haven't had in a long time is some good fresh milk."" I said, thinking outlook.
""Don't even say it,"" Rocky interjected.
""We smuggle some milk right out of the cow's udder!"" I declared.
""He said it,"" Rocky said, defeated. ""You're gonna steal from a farmer?""
""No, of course not, maybe we can tie some money to the cow's ear or put some money in the mailbox.""
""I can't beleive you want to do this"", Rocky said with a laugh.
""Listen, we take just a bit if milk, we pay the farmer double what it's worth, plus he doesn't have to milk that particular bit out of the cow, it's a win win for everyone""
""I am not helping you smuggle milk out of a cow"", Rocky declared.
Just then Switz caught up to us, with her phone out, ""guys, there's cow's! We should try and milk one!""
We got to where the AT crosses the pastures and hopped the gate. We followed the trail as it wound its way through the fields. Our plan was perfect, as long as they were dairy cows (we sure weren't milking anything else) Rocky would take the head while Switz and I dealt with the udders and Poet filmed the whole encounter and maybe wrote a poem about the great milk smuggle of 2021.
There was only one problem, where were all the cows? We were in blank pastures, with high grass and a suspicious lack of fecal matter. There was an old barn and a fence, but no cattle. We came to a cow trough filled with bright green water and tadpoles. It was like the kind of water you drink and you become one of the Ninja turtles. Much to my surprise, Rocky filled his bottle, made sure to not displace a tadpole, screwed his filter on, and took a sip. ""You're gonna need a hospital in Damascus,"" I told him.
At 10 miles was a shelter where we stopped for lunch. I took some Tylenol as a precaution.
After that I went on until it began to feel more like a march and less like a hike. Past 15, then up to 20, already a personal best on the AT. 
A heavy rain came through and soaked me. I got out my rain jacket, headlamp, and glasses. The sun went down just as the rain stopped. I got clear walking up until the state line, then the rain started back up. 
I saw a big toad on the trail.
As town grew nearer, the pains of a 30 mile day grew greater. First, my feet started hurting. Next came my knee, and after that my hip. With everything aching, me soaking wet, and the trail a small ray of light in a light in an expanse of black, I thought about stopping for the night. But what good would that do? I wanted to do 30 and I was doing 30. I pushed on into town and waited for the others at the park. 
As soon as I saw them come limping in, I burst out laughing. ""Why did we do this?""
Everyone started laughing along with me.
Cries of ""I've never hurt so bad in my life"" and ""is this how old people feel all the time?"" rang up.
 There was no real point or purpose, other then that we felt like it. And now we knew we could do it. Apparently Scribe and Ninja had booked everyone a room but me (it's okay, they don't have my number) so if dirtbag urban camping was going to happen I was going to have to make it happen.
I hobbled through town and explored a bit, then I found the perfect spot. A set of stairs led down below a bridge, a small rocky island in the middle of a small river sat under it. 
I looked around and didn't find much litter or graffiti. There was no sign of drug use or other such debauchery so I decided this was a safe place to sleep for the night (I still kept my knife with me in the hammock just to be safe, what exactly I planned to do with a pocket knife if someone tried to rob me I have no idea, but it seemed the proper thing to do when sleeping under bridges). The bridge even had some metal rafters and I could hang the hammock. 
It was actually a good night's sleep except for when a truck would drive over and the bridge would shake. ","Mile 441.6

Damascus to 30 Yards Or So Further North In Damascus
I got up early and packed up the hammock before anyone noticed me sleeping under the bridge. 
I saw right away that it was still raining, and I layered up and walked out without any trouble. My shoes were still soaked and falling apart. The tread by the toes was starting to fold up under them, so I decided a new pair of shoes was in order. I went to the outfitter and bought another pair of Speedgoats, these ones green and blue. 
Next I went around the corner to the Damascus Diner and had breakfast, highly recommended. 
I walked by the outfitter again and Rocky ran out and said they reserved me a bed at their B&B if I wanted it. I told them I planned to hike a bit today and wouldn't be staying with them. 
""You know you are allowed to take zeros,"" Rocky said as he walked away. 
I thought about that for a minute. I looked out at the cold pouring rain, lifted my legs which were stiff from that thirty miler, and turned around and ran after Rocky, telling him I'd take the room.
I walked to Lady Di's and was welcomed in and given a shower. I seriously doubt that I will ever get over my love of hot water. If you had a hot shower today, count yourself as lucky.
After my shower I met Lady Di, a sweethearted former thru hiker (class of 2019) who decided to get into the hostel business and was on her tenth day of being open, every bed was full. 
A yellow lab came strolling into the room with us. Duke was a legend I'm his own right. He was supposed to be a seeing eye dog for the blind but instead he failed dog school being afraid of stairs and tight spaces. Narrowly avoiding getting a job like the rest of us, Duke now instead gets to spent his days being patted and played with by the hiker. He is fond of jumping on you when you sit on the couch and loves chasing his tail. We made friends instantly.
Lady Di, it turns out, hiked with Corey for a bit in 2019 on her thru hike. Corey called me later and asked about the trail. I told him all about Lady Di's and he remembered her instantly. 
I took a bike and ride on the Creeper Trail to a grocery store. They had an excellent selection of knorr, and I decided to give it another try. For the first week or two, I bought only Knorr pasta sides and chicken and tuna packets but I didn't bother making sure the flavors of each matched. The result was a few disgusting combinations that turned me off from Knorr. Now, I'm hoping it can make a comeback.
The hostel consisted of Rocky, Switz, Ninja, Outback, Amazon, Scribe, Poet, myself, and a guy named Patrick. None of us knew Patrick but he fell right in with the group. He had a million questions about Nepal and India when he heard I was there, and had a bunch of stories of his time in the Peace Corps in Lesotho (which, it turns out, is a name I have been mispronouncing my whole life). Jill and Morgan called and asked if I wanted dinner and I took Patrick with me.
After dinner I sat with Switz a bit on the porch. Rocky came out and said he had a surprise for her, and pulled out a ukulele. The man somehow found a ukulele and got it for Switz. I'm shipping Rocky and Switz hard at this point, the two of them are adorable together. It pains me to leave them tomorrow.","Damascus

In the morning Lady Di made us all breakfast. Coffee, smoothies, quiche, sausage, a French toast casserole with real maple syrup, and of course fresh fruit.
I honestly didn't even want to leave, Lady Di's is a small paradise.
Rocky and I talked over breakfast. He desperately wants to start a podcast called ""Hiker Trash Radio"" and interview all of us dirtbags as we smuggle milk and sleep under bridges. Rocky and I seem to be experiencing some sort of bromance, with constant pranks and threats and laughter. I straight up love the dude.
My trail family is taking a zero today while I move on, I'm not too worried, I know we'll all meet back up soon.
I packed my things and remembered that I never bought a new rain jacket (apparently the British call those a macintosh, who knew). After days of cursing my old rain jacket and wringing out my sleeves I wasn't leaving without one. 
After buying one, I returned to the B&B, promised Lady Di a postcard from Katahdin, said bye to Duke and made him chase his tail one more time, put on my new shoes, left my old jacket in the hiker box, and hit the trail with Morgan and Jill. 
It was a fairly easy climb for being fresh out of town, nothing too extreme. Good thing too, because I am still not fully recovered from that 30 mile day. Yesterday I felt fine until I got to the stairs at the hostel. Walking up stairs was agony. Today I can handle it, bit my legs aren't exactly happy about it. Still have every plan to get my full 15 miles in.
The leaves are nearly all the way out now, less and less sunlight is penetrating to the forest floor, and I've sent home all my anti sun juice.
Jill and Morgan packed out a container of hummus and I made a hummus wrap. I want some desperately at the next town stop.
The trail followed the Virginia Creeper Trail for a bit and then crossed a huge wooden bridge just before dark. We had to headlamp in the last mile to the shelter. 
We were all most excited about the bear boxes that sit around the shelters in Virginia but when we got there the shelter was packed and the bear box was completely full, we all had to hang our food anyway. ","Damascus

Lost Mountain Shelter to Thomas Knob Shelter 
Something is not right. I pull my head out from under the quilt to feel the air. Why does it feel so cold? I can hear precipitation, not out of the ordinary, but this is different. Something is wrong. I poke my head up and look outside and yell out in frustration. It's snowing.
It's snowing. It's May, I sat outside last night and looked at the stars and listened to the coyotes without my jacket and was comfortable, and now it's snowing. 
Cries of protest erupted through camp. Everyone was angry. This was supposed to be our break from the cold and rain, but we were cruelly denied. 
I packed up my camp slowly, stopping to warm up my hands as often as I had to to keep them from going numb. I packed my tarp up last and ran under the roof of the shelter, where everyone was smoking and playing cards in their sleeping bags. I looked over and saw Morgan and Jill's tents still standing, no efforts being made to tear them down. I decided that was a great idea, so I grabbed my quilt and ran over and jumped in Jill's tent with her.
The two of us made tea and waited out the rest of the rain and snow. When the time came, I jumped up first and ran back to my backpack. I put it on and hiked out of camp. It was 1 pm.
The rain and snow stopped instantly. I followed the trail into another cow pasture. I wondered if this was where my great milk smuggling escapade would happen, but they turned out to be beef cows, not dairy. Some cows stood in the middle of the trail.
""Moooooooove over!"" I said to them.
They didn't seem to understand, so instead I cried out ""Moo b***h, get out the whey!""
They didn't budge. Finally I just walked up to them and clicked my poles together. They all scattered. Cows hate pole clicks.
Got a call from a friend at home. He said he took a girl on a date and her mother and her mother's boyfriend crashed the date. Turns out the guy was a billionaire. I told him he better marry that woman.
From there it was a bit of a climb, then a lovely jaunt across long grassy ridges and forested side hills. 
The temperature dropped ridiculously after dark. I got in and started setting up just after sunset. Some very strange people had a fire going, they kept yelling and arguing with eachother then inviting me over. I went to Morgan and Jill's tents instead.
Morgan's tent froze. Like litterally froze solid. I ran back for my sawyer and kept it tucked in my jacket for the rest of the night. 
Setting everything up to cook, I realized I was in serious trouble. I shook my fuel cannister. Nearly empty. I had enough left for maybe one more boil, which I used to make my rice. I was going to have to figure something out or starve for the next few days.","Lost Mountain Shelter

Thomas Knob Shelter to Hurricane Mountain Shelter 
This morning I woke up to an odd airy sound, like some animal huffing away. My first thought was a bear, then I listened closer and thought that it couldn't be. 
I jumped out of my hammock and found three wild ponies surrounding Jill's tent.
""What do I do!?"" She yelled, penned in by all the little horses who munched away at the grass. She tried to stick her head out but retreated when a pony looked at her. 
I laughed and walked up and let a brown and white pony sniff my hand, then started scratching its head and patting its back.
""You can pet them?"" Jill asked.
""They seem friendly to me,"" I answered.
The brown and white was a bit skiddish but let me pet him, the dark brown mare was the most friendly, not caring one bit about my presence, but the gorgeous brown chestnut was wild and didn't care for our company. I told Jill and Morgan to watch if they turned around, you didn't want to get kicked.
Jill joked that I should train one to carry my bag, she called it ""pony-blazing"".
I decided my mission for the day was to find a fuel cannister. There was a general store somewhere nearby that might sell them, but going there would add at least 3 miles to an already long day. I was feeling too lazy for extra miles. Somehow fuel would be obtained, I just had to figure out how.
The next few miles were some of the best on the entire trail. Wide open pastures, rocky outcroppings (I miss Rocky), and high mountain views in every direction. The ponies ruled the highlands, they were everywhere I looked and their droppings were even more common. For such a small horse, these were the biggest piles of animal dung I'd seen since tracking rhinos in Southern Nepal. One herd of ponies had a little foal with them that whose coloring was that of cookies and cream ice cream. I named the little colt Oreo.
The back of a wooden sign had the number 500 drawn on with a sharpie. I stared at this a bit confused for a few moments, then I realized it was the mileage marker. 
500 miles, almost a quarter of the way done. (And I would walk 500 miles and I would walk 500 more, and I would walk 500 more and I would walk 500 more and I would walked almost 200 more).
After 500 miles I felt like I'd learned a few thing, like I was finally starting to know what I was talking about. So what have I learned in 500 miles?

There is hope for humanity after all
500 miles. People like to ask me what I think about all day. The answer is usually food, specifically this Chinese place in Elizabethtown called E-Yuan, I plan on annihilating that place when I get to PA. Other then food my thoughts are pretty simple. I think about my family, my friends, various things from my childhood. I think about how bad everything hurts and how good it's going to feel to get to camp tonight. I don't think about Katahdin much, not nearly as much as I thought I would anyhow. I think this trail could go on forever and that would be just fine.
One thing that is very odd about not having constant stimulation anymore is the way your brain starting grabbing at straws and giving you memories that you haven't even considered recalling since you were ten. I'll be walking down the trail and get the theme song from CatDog stuck in my head. 
I came to one trail crossing and saw some weekenders coming out.
This was my time to be smooth. I told myself. I was getting a fuel cannister from them somehow.
""Hey, do you guys have a map? I'm trying to find the way to the camp store""
That drew them in. I pretended to look at their map, I said the store was still too far, I might just have to eat cold food. 
""Oh cold food, no, that sounds miserable"".
Yes, feel bad for me, my life is hard, give me your fuel.
I talked to them more, smoothing them over. Turns out they were cutting their trip short, they had bad weather and twisted ankles. 
Finally the time came to shoot my shot ""you don't have an extra fuel cannister you would sell me, do you? I'll give you cash!""
They did, and that's how I ended up with an absurdly large cannister of fuel.
Top showed up and hiked with me a bit. Top only talks about three things, his gear, his wife, and the army. 
""My wife says I got in shape to carry this Osprey pack from my 20 years in the army"".
I let Top go out ahead.
Ponies were playing about all day. We also went through a cow pasture. Big longhorns, mooing at us all the while. 
I got to the shelter and there was noone there. I wondered if Morgan and Jill were behind. I waited. 
I made some ramen for supper and waited some more, but no sign of anyone. Finally I gave a yell and they responded, turns out they were camped right below the shelter since there weren't any good tent sights. They came up and were shocked to see it was just me. 
""I was getting worried,"" I said, ""it was like being in one of those movies where everyone else vanishes and you're the last person on Earth"".
""What would you do if you were?""
""Probably finish my thru hike then go looking across the country for other people"".
Ultimately, I left the empty shelter and went down to camp with Jill and Morgan.","Thomas Knob Shelter

Hurricane Mountain Shelter to Partnership Shelter
I'm sleeping better then I ever have in my life. Every night is restful, wether it's dreamless or alight with visions and hallucinations. I have a combination of extreme exercise and a hammock to thank. I honestly have no desire for beds any more at this point, I think I will find a way to hang my hammock in my room when I get home. 
Jill and Morgan left ahead of me, trying to hitch back to trail days. I ultimately decided that between Noro, covid, the fact that I was just going to spend money anyway, and the fact that I would probably be having to take a zero when I got my second covid shot anyway, trail days wouldn't be worth it. 
I was alone the rest of the day. 
The trail was empty. Emptier then I've ever seen it. 
Something else was different. The leaves seemed fuller and darker, there was a certain kind of warm in the air, and there were chipmunks. Chipmunks everywhere. This side of Mt Rogers is further into spring then the south side, I've decided. I seem to have jumped ahead a couple weeks, I must be at lower altitudes. Maybe this cold snap will be the last. Maybe those promised warm days are finally coming in. 
I was out of snack food and so I finally broke down and ate tuna straight out of the pack. For some reason this always seemed so disgusting to me, I couldn't get myself to do it. I had been mixing it in my ramen every night, drowning out the flavor. Now I'm hungry enough to try. I took a bite and what do you know, the stuff is delicious. 
I went through another cow pasture today, and found a small black cow lying in the middle of the trail. I approached it without much concern until it coughed and I jumped four feet in the air.
Somehow I had gone my entire life without hearing a cow cough, it never occurred to me that they did. The strange noise startled me. I stared at the cow. It coughed again. I laughed. 
""What do you have a cold? Do you have cowvid-19?"" 
I laughed aloud since there was noone around but myself and the cow to appreciate this delightfully good joke, and the cow didn't seem to get it. 
I at last saw other humans at the shelter. Two people sat by the fire and told me that there was a pizza place down the road that delivered to the shelter. I told them thank you and moved on to set up my hammock when a voice came from a tent, then a head, then a pizza box.
""You want a couple slices man?"" 
There wasn't a chance of me passing that up. I ate his last two slices and threw away the box for him. It was a pepperoni pizza.
The guys name was Starburst, he's a thru hiker as well. Sometimes trail magic comes from the hikers too. 
Tomorrow I need to get up early and hitch to Marion before the post office closes at noon. My goals for the day are to pick up my kilt, get more of that spectacular tuna, and get my second round of my covid shot. The CDC just lifted mask mandates for people who are fully vaccinated, which means if I can get my shot tomorrow, I will have two weeks to get my ""I'm in public and need to look like I'm enjoying these people"" face back.

Partnership Shelter to Mile 547.2 (Pasture North End)
I got up early, packed up, and headed for the road. Today was kilt day, and I had to be at the post office before they closed at noon. 
Thankfully I was right next to the road. It was just a matter of getting a ride. Hitchhiking so far has been easy. As anyone who's done it before will tell you, the whole trick is to have a woman (or preferably women) with you. For some reason, drivers are far more likely to pick you up if someone in your party has no Y chromosome.
Car after car blew past me. I was starting to worry, I even considered calling a shuttle, but as they say, the trail provides. A car pulled over and I hopped in, and who should be driving but my old friend Goat. 
I was astounded at this coincidence. I hadn't seen Goat in over a month, and now here she was picking me up and taking me to town. Apparently she had been hiking over Wesser Bald when her knee blew out and forced her off trail, sadly unable to finish her thru hike. Now she was back home (which it turns out was right here) healing up and wondering what to do with herself. 
Goat took me on a quick tour of the town and dropped me off at the post office. I was actually a little early, they didn't open until 9:30 on Saturdays.
I got my kilt and walked to the grocery store. On the way that hiker hunger hit so I tried to go in a Taco Bell. The inside was closed for covid so I ordered at the drive thru window.
Next came my resupply, and the next order of business was to see if I could get my second shot. I ran to every pharmacy in town, something was wrong at each stop. No Moderna, no vaccines on weekends, sir this is an Arby's order something or leave, every excuse in the book. 
I took a look ahead and figured out that Pearisburg would be the best bet for my second shot. They had a walgreens with Moderna that was taking a million reservations. Pearisburg was 100 miles away and I had ten days left in my window for the shot. I decided I was getting there in seven.
I went to the Arby's, which was also drive thru only and I had get a nice lady to pull forward and set off the sensor. Fed and happy (ish) I walked out of town and prepared to hitchhike. 
I stuck my thumb out and watched the cars buzz past. I looked up on the hill to my right and saw a barb wire fence and a guard tower.
""You've got to be kidding me,"" I said aloud to myself.
I walked up a bit and sure enough, there it was, ""Virginia State Hospital for the Criminally Insane"". I was trying to hitchhike in front of a hospital for the criminally insane, noone in their right mind was going to pick me up. One flew over the cuckoo's nest but he sure didn't stop for me. 
I went another half mile up the road where I hoped people wouldn't think I was Sling Blade and stuck out my thumb again. A nice guy with a white can with a single cot rolling around in the back picked me up and took me back to trail.
I ran in the woods and took off my pants immediately. A hiking kilt with a black watch tartan and leather buckles soon covered the parts of me that someone deemed offensive. I've never known such comfort, I've never felt so free. The breeze was all I've ever needed in my life, especially when noone was around (which was all day) and I could lift my kilt and fully enjoy the breeze. I never want to hike in pants again.
I met a flip floper today, the first I've met on trail. He had started in Harper's Ferry and was on his way south to Springer, then he would shuttle around to Katahdin and hike back to Harper's Ferry again. Just another way to do the trail. He told me about all the beauty that was out ahead, and I told him about the Grayson Highlands.
Other then him, I saw two people total today on trail. That has to be a new record.
The trail dipped down into a rolling valley at the end of the day with cows and grassy fields and low hills. I lovely walking through people's farms.
I set up camp just outside a cow pasture. This is the first night I've spent alone on the AT. I don't mind it.
I climbed back over the fence to hang NY food bag, thinking it will give it some extra protection. Hopefully the cows don't eat it.","Partnership Shelter

Mile 547.2 to Lynn Camp Creek
Leaving camp today I was walking out across a sidehill when I came around a rhododendron and saw a sign nailed to a tree. I stopped and starred as my kilt ceased its flowing and my pack stopped its rattling. 
1/4 GA>ME 
I was a quarter of the way there. Lots of other milestones hit me or made me stand in awe, but this was different. Rather then being some arbitrary boundary like a state line or new national forest area, or a mile mark that implied how far I had come but not how many lie ahead, this one told me I was going somewhere. It implied progress in a way the others could never. 1/4 of the way there, do that three more times and you're done. 
It's a profound thing. Sometimes me and all the other hikers talk about Katahdin, we're all sure we're going to cry, but noone mentions points like this or what you're supposed to do at them. I decided it would be best to walk by it. 
It was more of the same as yesterday, climb over low ridges, clamor over those wooden ladders that let you cross fences, walk through a cow pasture, and repeat.
""I got a fever, and the only cure is more cowbell!!"" I yelled at a cow who wore no bell and stared at me blankly. The cows don't make great company in truth, they don't laugh at my jokes, they don't converse with me, they smell kind of bad. I miss people. Today is the last day of Trail Days so I'm hoping more people come back to the trail tomorrow.
I need to get ahold of my trail family as well, especially Switz who had promised to help me milk one of these cows. If I pull all 20s, I could make Pearisburg in 4 days, get my shot, take a zero or two, and let everyone catch up. I don't know if I have four twenties (nice) in me, we shall see. 
I talked to some cowboy looking folks on horses (the horses did not talk, however they did seem very unhappy about something) and they (the people, not the horses) told me about the climbs ahead and an enclosed rock shelter I should pass tomorrow. 
Before I went up the hill I saw a barrel with a sign on it asking northbound hikers to take a bag of wood chips up for the privy, which I obeyed. It was the least I could do considering all the trail has done for me, and besides that's just the sort of basic cooperation that makes a trail like this work. 
After the shelter I decided to go one more mile and camp by the creek. I was stepping through some rocks when my foot slipped and I tumbled forward. I tried to catch myself with my poles but the weight of my pack had too much inertia. I tried to regain my footing but there was no fighting it, I was going forward into the rocks. With only a split second to think I instinctually protected my right shoulder (which has suffered many stupid injuries and now dislocates at the slightest breeze) at the cost of my left arm and my head. My left elbow came down hardest and then my head collided with a rock. I rolled around and laid still for a while. My head was sore but thankfully the rock was flat and not sharp and so I wasn't bleeding. My elbow was bruised and my knees were bloody, but I was okay enough to stand and walk. I stumbled out of the rocks and carefully made my way to camp. My elbow hurts now as I write this but thankfully my head doesn't seem too sore.
If anyone is wondering why my shoulder is in such horrid shape, wonder no further, I love telling this story. Especially since me hurting myself seems to be the theme of today journal entry.
The first time I dislocated it I was sledding down Mt Washburn in early September of 2017 on a giant inflatable duck. We had just gotten our first snow of the fall and were eager to get some sledding done, so four of us tried to pile on top of Ducky (In hindsight this may seem like a terrible idea, but in my defense I was trying to impress a girl)(also yes it was a terrible idea). Ducky started gliding down the hills at an alarming speed and we all held on for our lives. The treeline got closer and closer but Ducky bravely saw our peril and ran himself into a rock that was protruding out of the thin layer of ice and snow, getting himself killed in the process (RIP Ducky, we will never forget) and launching us four humans across the slope. I came to rest hard on my right shoulder, and had to pull it back into place. All of us were bloody and bruised. That was the first time.
The second and third time came during the Snowlodge Winter Olympics. Working at Snowlodge in the winter means you are 30 miles from the closest road and spending you're time with the same hundred people for months on end, with nothing to do but ski and drink. We combine those two favorite activities of ours and the result is the Snowlodge Wknter Olympics. The first event I tried to compete in was the ski obstacle course, where I tried so hard to win that a pole plant was enough to send my shoulder out of socket and bench me for the duration of the games. I spent the Olympics drunk on the sidelines cheering everyone on. I won no medals that year, but I did win the spirit award.
The third came during the closing ceremony. The ceremony always includes a piñata, which is filled with various adult themed treats. I watched with particular interest because, being trapped in a frozen wonderland/hellscape 30 miles from a car with a certain female makes you run out of certain things and unable to get more. But I knew there were plenty in the piñata. I took a sip of my whiskey sour, set it to the side and leaned in closely. When the bat broke through the piñata and thing started flying I too was flying, and elbowing my coworkers out if the way I dove in to the middle of the pile. I landed on my shoulder and dislocated it, screaming in pain while using my other arm to shove candy and condoms in my pockets.
A fourth dislocation came during the descent from Middle Teton. Corey, Creech and I had camped at the saddle the night before, strapped on our crampons in the morning and made our way up the Southwest Coulair to the summit. It was a glorious day. From there we climbed back down, grabbed our camping gear and started the trek back down the canyon to the base of the mountain. We were casually glascading down the snowfeilds, not a care in the world. It was a happy moment until I slipped on one particularly steep section and panicked for just a moment, just enough time to completely forget how to self arrest with an ice ax. Rather then tucking it under my arm I simply buried it in the snow. It stopped me, but the force of it drive my shoulder out of place harder then any before. I had to put on my campons and walk the rest of the way down after that, my arm hurt too bad to glascade. 
That last one was the worst. After that it dislocated all the time, with little warning. Somehow I've been lucky so far on this trip. I hope it holds out for me, the last thing I want is to be jamming my shoulder back into place on the AT.","Mile 547.2

Lynn Camp Creek to Jenkins Shelter
I was awoken by a mouse running around under my hammock. I looked at my phone and saw it was 5 am and decided that was as good a time as any to start my day.
This was the second night in a row I was camped all by myself and I decided I was over sleeping solo. The advantage of having others around you us that you have something to blame the noises on. When noone is camped for miles around, every leaf crunching or twig cracking becomes your impending doom.
I checked guthooks for upcoming shelters and found the Jenkins Shelter (LEEEERRRROOOOYYYYY JENKINS!!!!) was a solid 19 miles away. I put on my kilt, took off my pants and headed out.
Yesterday before camp I passed several signs warning me about a washed out bridge. They said the river would have to be forded and I should be prepared to wait out high waters or be swept downstream to death. I found a low, ankle deep stream with a rope running across it for balance. Also there was a line with water shoes on it. I took the water shoes off, put them on my feet where my shoes had been, took my own shoes and put them on the line where the water shoes had been, and sent my shoes across the water. Next I crossed, ignoring the rope and using my trekking poles instead. 
The water was cold, especially on my middle right toe (I had a bit of the knuckle on that toe removed after repeated exposure to frostbite when I was a teenager, what a rascal) but the crossing was easy. I sent the water shoes back to the other side and kept on.
It rained a few times today but never much more then a steady drizzle. It occurred to me that Top wasn't around. Top draws rain like no other. The last time I saw him he was complaining that he had been rained on almost every day since Springer. I thought about it for a second and realized that most of the days I was rained on were days that I saw Top. The man seems to have a perpetually spitting cloud following him everywhere he goes, I will do my best to stay ahead and out of his meteorological influence.
I climbed up to a bald ridge and followed it to Chestnut Knob Shelter. One of the few fully enclosed shelters on the trail, it was also unique in its rock and mortar construction. It was a beautiful stop and I turned on my phone to see if anything was going on. Turns out a guy named Hollywood found my credit card on the trail and it was all over Facebook, everyone I know was messaging me about the card. Hollywood is leaving it at Brushy Mountain Outpost for me, I will pick it up tomorrow. What a nice guy. 
After that I followed a Ridge with some odd rock formations and hooted at the barred owls, who answered me with their ""who cooks for you, who cooks for you alllllll"" hoot. When I was a kid my dad taught me that hoot and that, because turkeys despised barred owls for some reason, you could make a turkey gobble with that noise. He used to drive me up dirt road to the tops of mountains just to let me hoot down at the roosted birds. I made quite a few gobble, and I never lost the ability. Tonight the owls were all answering, no turkeys, just owls.
With two miles left to the shelter, one of my trekking poles broke. Something inside was out, and it doesn't look fixable. Oh well. 
I got to camp very late, especially considering how early I started. I hung my hammock and decided I wasn't cooking tonight, which turned out to be a good call.
I ate a few cold sandwiches and brushing my teeth when I heard something walking in the trees. With the wet ground they made almost no sound. It was dark and moonless now, so I shined my headlamp into the trees. A pair of eyes stared back at me. Next the eyes raised up on their hind legs, and staring at me. I shined my light around and saw another, larger set of eyes coming out of the dark trees towards me.
""HEY!! HEY BEAR! GET!!!! GET GOIN"", I shouted at the bear and cub. The mother stopped coming towards me but just stood and stared. I clapped my hands and ran at them. The bears turned and ran into the night. I grabbed my ursack and tied it off to a tree as fast I could. I sure hope it actually holds, it's probably going to have a bear trying to get into it tonight. I ran back to my hammock. A few people around camp got up out of their tents, shined there lights around and asked about the bear.
""There's at least two, they're after our food, I'm going to bed"" I yelled, and went to sleep undisturbed. ","Lynn Camp Creek

(LEEEERRRROOOOYYYYY) Jenkins Shelter to Helvey's Mill Shelter 
The talk all about the camp was the bears. I in my hammock and listened for a while. The bears had apparently been running around camp all night, causing a ruckus everywhere they went. I slept through it all. 
I got up and walked around and was relieved to see they didn't get any of our food (not from a lack of trying no doubt). I can be thankful this was not the LeBron James of bears. 
This Hollywood fellow who was so kind to save my credit card was leaving it at Brushy Mountain Outpost, 12 miles ahead. I left camp and covered the miles in record time, the terrain was flat ridgetops for most of the day. 
At one point I stepped off trail and brushed against a plant that seemed to set my leg ablaze. I'm almost certain I'm immune to poison ivy, so I assume it must have been burn hazel. Either way, the burning stopped after a few minutes, hopefully I don't wake up with an inflamed leg.
I was a sight to see today, hiking along with scuffed up knees, a bruised elbow (and head if you could see it), my signature limp, no shirt, nothing but a kilt, and only one trekking pole, the other still lying broken on my pack. On top of all that, downright filthy. I can rub any spot on my body and filth just flakes off. I'm a sight to see, hiker trash mischief filled dirtbag at its finest, I look like a Smuggler.
Brushy Mountain Outpost was a nice little stop with a simple resupply, burgers, and shakes. I got a vanilla shake, a bacon cheeseburger (and they go HARD on the bacon, the bacon was thicker then the beef, it was beautiful) and some Cajun fries. I also bought a new fuel cannister and left that absurdly large one I bought from the muggles in the hiker box. And of course, I got my credit card back.
I tried my hardest to fix my trekking pole, but decided it was a gunner and chucked it in the garbage. I'll have to single pole it into Pearisburg. 
I hiked a few more miles, passed the shelter, then looked at guthooks and saw there was no water for miles ahead. The lack of hydration potential, and not at all the fact that last night's bear encounter made me not want to sleep alone tonight, made me decide it was worth it to backtrack the half mile and stay at the the shelter after all. ","Jenkins Shelter

Helvey's Mill Shelter to Weary Feet Hostel
I was reluctant to get up today for some reason. I had a hard time falling asleep last night, I laid awake for some time listening to the barred owls hoot and cackle. When I at last got up, everyone was already gone from camp. 
I braced for some chill when I took my quilts off, but it never came. It was warm. It stayed warm all night. Summer was rolling in, it was more and more obvious every day. 
I stretched out, put on my kilt, and walked down to the water. When I got back and sat to eat breakfast a deer came walking in to camp. It walked right up to me, staring into me with those curious doe eyes, and decided I wasn't much of a threat. It calmly ate leaves while I ate my breakfast. 
Sharing a meal with a wild doe put me in a good mood, and I went out of camp almost skipping. It was warm, so warm I took my shirt off and wore only my kilt and my backpack. The trail was flat too, flat and easy, no rocks, no roots, no thin patches and no slippery mud. Things were looking up for me, I decided.
The flat trails leave enough extra energy for the mind to wander. Most days the terrain is so exerting that it's all you can focus on, but not today. That old question of what to do after the trail crept back in. The thought came to me, what would I do in a perfect world, one where I could just do anything I pleased and not have to worry. The ideas were all downright absurd at first (traverse a magical land with a wise old wizard, an elf, a dwarf, the rightful king of men, and four hobbits wouldn't go very far in the real world) so I toned it back a bit. What would I do, ideally, in this world. Travel, explore, write, volunteer. I'd be some wandering author, part vagabond, part philosopher, part explorer, part humanitarian. Go to a foreign land, sometimes for pleasure, sometimes for some cause or another, always for adventure, and then write about it. Maybe too, in my ideal world, my friends would come with me, and I would meet some kind and loving woman who wouldn't mind the hardships and trials, she would count on them, learn to love them, and she would stay by my side for the whole thing. It was a nice dream to have. Does such a path exist though? I'm not sure there's much demand for a freelance hobo writer in the world today, and would anyone listen to what I had to say anyhow? I suppose I'm at least partly doing that right now, I know someone is reading this blog (which I swear I'm going to be better at updating from now on), but the trouble is its not quite sustainable. I'm losing money, not gaining it. I don't mind not having much, in fact I prefer it, but I do need something. Maybe I'll start a blog site some day, or maybe I will finish a book and get it published. 
Right now, I'm not worried. There's a certain simplicity to life on the trail, and I don't intend to waste it worrying about the future. I must wake up, I must pack up, I must hike, I must filter water, I must eat, I must set up camp, I must sleep, and repeat. And when I have to do these things, that is all I have to do. That is all I need, and that is all I think about, and so it is all I do. Every day, there are clear and laid out goals, problems that are solved. If I see a view, or run into a deer, or meet another hiker and have a friendly conversation; that is good; if I don't, that is fine too. 
Long term goals as well. I must get to Katahdin before the snows come. It is clear, obvious, distant yet attainable, and easily understood. If only life off trail could be this clear cut. 
I smelled something foul in my food bag. I investigated and found that overnight my spinach had gone beyond wilting and went straight to rotting. I no longer had the cold nights to extend its shelf life. It occurred to me now that summer was coming in, I probably couldn't pack out spinach any more. I decided to eat everything in my food bag that should be refrigerated before it too went bad.
I decided I wanted a shower and a phone charge so I called the next hostel, Weary Feet, and they said I could set up in their yard. I walked in at about 7:30 and fell instantly in love. Here was an old farm house, rickety and spacious and beautiful. The front porch occupied by a few hikers and a man named Robert with suspenders and an exceptional mustache. Robert laughed and giggled with me instantly, he was in the kind of good mood that gave the impression that he was always in a good mood. He was happy, he was content, he was always direct and to the point, but always with a joke on the side. I liked him immediately. 
Robert gave me a loaded baked potato with bacon and homemade chili and a cup of homemade sweet tea. I took one bite and immediately put my name down for breakfast in the morning. 
I sat and ate on the porch with a girl named Bear Girls, so named because she didn't know who Bear Grylls was. I loved that because I always thought Bear Gryllls was a moron (sorry fans of Bear Grylls) and I appreciate someone who doesn't even know him.
Bear Girls, I soon learned, has also traveled Asia and much of the US, and also plans to go to Europe in the near future. We made fast friends and spent the night joking and laughing. Then she took it up a step further and referenced The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, my favorite book. I hope she stays near me for the foreseeable future, shes a good new friend.
I feel so at home here, I wish I didn't have my shot on Saturday, I could take a zero or two here. This is paradise, it is heaven. A fair warning to anyone keeping up with this journal, in a few days I plan to change the ne to my trail name, so it will now say ""Smuggler's trail journal, but it will still be the same otherwise, thank you guys!","Helvey's Mill Shelter

Weary Feet Hostel to Mile 618
Some days stand out from the rest. This will be one of those days I remember.
I got up just in time for breakfast in the kitchen of the farm house. I had been sleeping without my rainfly and the morning sun shining on my face slowly brought me back into the world.
Bear Girl joined me at the breakfast table. We started talking, and she mentioned that she has worked a season in Antarctica, which has been a dream of mine for some time. I asked her a hundred questions about it, she was impressed that I already knew so much. I decided right then that I was applying when I got to Pearisburg, who knows, maybe I can go live with the penguins after the trail. 
We got back on the subject of India again. She told me how she suffered from terrible food poisoning for weeks in the north, I told her about the time I got sick in Pushkar and the time I almost died in Dharamsala. She mentioned dating a local man for a few weeks, I told her about the screaming matched I witnessed at the Pakistan border. Dizzy, another hiker staying at the farm, looked up from his pancakes enough to say ""yall are the most fascinating people I've ever met"" in all seriousness. I will admit, it felt good to hear that.
Bear Girl and I hiked out together and went straight to Dismal Falls. We jumped in the pool below the falls. I've been waiting this entire hike to go for a swim. Now at last the air was warm. The water was absolutely frigid. We could barely speak with the icy water above our waists. We swam over to a big rock and sat and talked some more, making it a point to be in the sun.
I told her a story about a time I left a silent meditation retreat and told the instructors they were fools, she asked if it was a vipasina, I said yes, and as it turns out she's the only other person I've met that has been to one and also shares my opinion on them that they are absolute nonsense (sorry fans of vipasina).
We soon swam back and sat on the top of the waterfall, letting the cold water flow over us.
We went further down the trail and came to a stream crossing. I carefully hopped my way across, dropping one foot in the water and filling it up. With one soaked foot and some effort I finally emerged on the other side of the stream and realized that we had made a wrong turn and needlessly crossed. The trail didn't even go that way. 
We hopped back over and got back on trail. We hiked on for ten easy miles, planning to stay at the Wapiti Shelter, sight of a double murder and apparently one of the most haunted places on the AT, if you beleive in that sort of thing. 
Just before the shelter, we came to a large, man-made pond with blueish water. I stuck my foot in and as soon as I felt that it was warm I took my clothes off and jumped in. Bear Girl followed. We looked down and saw fish swimming with us.
Bear Girl cracked open a beer she had been carrying. We shared it and talked about the fish. I said I wished I could catch one and cook it. Just then, I felt something tangled around my leg. By some grand coincidence or divine providence, I pulled on the mysterious string and found it to be fishing line. I commented that I wished there would be a hook at the end. There was a brand new spinner, the hooks hadn't even started to rust. 
We swam a bit more and them decided that we would much rather stay here then some murder site shelter. We set up camp and I tied the fishing line to my remaining trekking pole. I figured we wouldn't have much chance of catching anything with a spinner and I mentioned that we would be in much better shape if we could only cut the hooks off. Bear Girl had wire cutters for some reason.
Why on Earth she had wire cutters is beyond me, they serve no real purpose out here, but this time they were exactly what was needed. We tied the treble hook on and tried fishing with a tortilla. The fish were all over it, but the tortilla was too soft. We went out in the woods and started digging for worms. 
We overturned some rocks and dug down with our trowels and found some baby nightcrawlers and started throwing them into Bear Girl's hat. With a hat full of worms we went to the pond, tied one on, and threw it in. Sunnies and bluegills swarmed it. 
I pulled fish after fish out of the pond with the trekking pole. Most were too small, but I kept four nice ones for dinner. We laughed joyfully at our ridiculous luck.
Bear Girl built a fire while I cleaned the fish. We skewered a few and roasted them like hot dogs, and set a few others on a rock. The all cooked up beautifully, white meat flaking off the bones. It was one of the best trail meals I've ever had. 
After dinner we threw the bones and scraps back in the pond for the fish and decided to go check out this supposedly haunted shelter once it was dark. We took only one headlamp and snuck down the trail. 
In 2019, Corey actually met the guy who killed those people. He got into a bit of a fight with him because he stole someone's dog. The next day the man, who's trail name was Sovereign, threatened to burn another man's tent. When they tried to leave, Sovereign went crazy and killed the man.
This all happened just south of here.
In 1981, two hikers bodies were found at the Wapiti Shelter with knife and gunshot wounds. They had been killed by a man named Randall Smith, who was convicted of murder and served 15 years before being released for good behavior. He then tried to kill again at the same shelter. 
All the comments on guthooks talk about strange vibes and odd noises in the night. There are several stories about people packing up and leaving in the middle of the night. Is this a simple case of placebo effect? Probably, but that doesn't mean I'm not checking it out.
When I was 20 I spent three weeks camped in the desert with a fellow who turned out to be crazier then anticipated. Every night he would get out his stones and tarot cards and whatever else and insist something bad happened here and there were restless spirits and whatever else, so I'm apparently no stranger to camping with ghosts if you believe that guy, they must just not bother with me.
We came to the shelters spur trail and turned off our headlamp. We snuck in so that we wouldn't disturb anyone and looked around. The shelter was creepy alright, with the light of a half moon shining down through the trees and one guy snoring in it, but I didn't see a ghost.
""You know that's probably why everyone gets so scared here, it's just all the other hikers coming through and looking for ghosts at night. It's people sneaking through camp, that's what's creepy. We were the ghosts this whole time!"" I said and Bear Girl tried her hardest to hold in a laugh. 
We left the shelter, with a moment of silence for those who were needlessly murdered, and went back to our camp at the pond. At camp, something was walking around in the woods. Could've been a deer, could've been a bear, could've been another ax murderer. I guess we'll never know.","Weary Feet Hostel

Mile 618 to Mile 633.6
I awoke with thoughts of fish and feasts. Turkeys gobbled all around, and the air was warm. I would hate to jinx it, but I really think the cold has finally broken. At last I can stop complaining about how cold it is and start complaining about how hot it is, what a joy is the summer (sarcasm, but yes, I'm happy, for now).
We packed up camp and Bear Girl started boiling water and offered me a cup of coffee. I had drank four or five cups of coffee a day since I was 10. I loved most of my life with a raging caffeine addiction.
I remember at the Inn when me and my second in command were never sleeping. Whoever looked less tired on that particular day bought the coffee, and hot and butter juice would bring us just a little bit back to awareness. I remember gathering around the coffee pot in Canyon every day and getting to know all my coworkers and dropping off candy and cookies by the coffee pot. I remember when we started working 7 days a week and 14 hours a day how much harder we hot the coffee and how grateful we were to our boss Julie for buying it for us. I remember lining up in the morning in Vail for a ""hobo mocha"", coffee mixed with hot chocolate, I used to sneak in on my days off too and take coffee, I was too busy and too broke to be making my own. Coffee was always there for me when life was hard, but was it really for the best? I couldn't be normal without it. I was miserable without my coffee.
Two years ago, I swore off the stuff forever. Caffine as a whole that is. I quit drinking coffee and tea, and even large amounts of chocolate. I felt amazing (once the withdrawals stopped at least). I no longer had to have coffee to feel like myself. I decided it was the best decision I had ever made and I was never going back, but for some reason, I decided to have a cup this morning. This broke over a years streak, the last cup I had was the day before I left Vietnam because I wanted to try their egg coffee, it was a year before that as well. 
A cup of coffee was like visiting an old friend. That familiar taste and aroma, that familiar little buzz inside of me. Coffee is like that feeling when you get up earlier than usual, but your not tired and you go outside but noone is up or around yet. You find yourself in an empty space that is usually so chaotic and you take a deep breath, and find it so peaceful and relaxing yet energizing. That is what coffee tastes like to me. Am I falling off the wagon? I think not, just stepping off to say hi to an old friend.
Oddly enough, the whole day revolved around addiction.
Bear Girl and I left camp and started hiking up the mountain. We both sweated harder then we ever had on trail, it litterally pured off our foreheads and down our faces. 
I got ahead for a bit and jumped a deer. I stopped and decided to wait for Bear Girl. There aren't many people that I can hold a conversation with the way I can with her. She offers an interesting perspective on every subject, she's a practical, free thinking woman. The kind of person who can figure it out whether she knows about it or not. 
She's also led a life very similar to mine. I don't meet many people who have lived the way I have, and it's oddly refreshing to meet someone with the same set of trials and problems. She has boyfriend somewhere behind us who is trying his best to catch up. I don't know that she wants him to. 
I asked her over lunch if, like me, she ever has fantasies about living a normal life. Having some sense of stability after all of this madness. A partner, some kids, a dog, a white picket fence, a steady income, all the basic comforts of modern life. No more spending your last dollar on a new guitar (did it, worth it) or having to spoon with a smelly hobo on a bus in the desert (I was cold) or waking up and not even knowing what state or sometimes what could try you are in. She said yes, all the time. We both soon agreed we were a bit jealous of people who could be satisfied with such a life. It wasn't in either of us. We were travelers, dirtbags, hiker trash, dumpster children, and that was probably all we were ever going to be, and all we could do was be thankful every day that we knew better then to try and be anything else.
The trail was incredibly hot and dry. I ran out of water with two miles to the next source, and struggled my way to the shelter. 
Doc's Knob Shelter was right along the trail in a rhodi patch (that men's rhododendron, my new favorite word is rhodi). I filled my bottle and drank it down all at once, then filled it again and drank another half until I thought I would be sick. 
The talk of the shelter was for some reason moonshine. Two fellows were there taking about someone they had met a few days back who made the greatest moonshine they had ever tasted. Another guy, who must have been with them, laughed at the story until they asked him why he hadn't tried any with them anyhow.
He explained that he hadn't drank in thirteen years, not a drop, and if he had the other day he would probably still be there, drunk as drunk could be and unable to move or hike, draining his wallet and burning his money in a glass jar. He wasn't self conscious about his alcoholism or egotistical about his sobriety, I liked him. I wanted to ask him more about it, but I didn't want to be rude and so Bear Girl and I moved along, hydrated and with full bottles.
We talked about what we had heard, about that man's drinking problem and his newfound sobriety. The conversation turned to harder drugs. She said she saw a lot of opiate addiction while she traveled in Australia. I hated to bring the mood down too far, but I mentioned losing a childhood friend to heroin a few years ago, and being so close to losing others as well. It raged through my hometown, ensnared a lot of good young people, too many of them never made it out. 
Bear Girl asked if I ever felt addicted to a people, I said yes. Relationships are an odd thing when you live seasonally. We both agreed we had a habit of latching onto them, whether they were healthy for us or not, and sometimes had a hard time letting go. Then she said something that struck me harder then that bump to the head on that rock 
""Do you think that we get so attached to people because a relationship offers the closest thing that white picket fence, normal life that we wish we could have? Do you think we obsess over it because it represents everything we want and can never have?"" 
I was dumbfounded. I had to admit just hoe right she was. But that was neither here nor there for me, I was staying single on this trail, or at least so far I was, she was the one with a decision to make. 
We came out to a powerline and switched to happier subjects. Cats, who doesn't love cats. I used a lazer pinter once to get one to play piano. The same cat forced me out of the house I was living in at the time (I'm very allergic). Bear Girl loves cats. She had a million stories about her cats.
We stopped at Pearis cliff and hung our feet over the edge. The wind blew kilt up, but who cares, noone but Bear Girl was around to see and I don't think she cares. 
A bald eagle went soaring past us. ""Look at all that freedom!"" I shouted.
We set up camp at a nearby spring which was apparently a Mecca for deer. Deer were appearing from all sides, wandering through our camp and chomping away at the leaves and things. 
One came down to camp and walked right up to me, cautious but not too afraid. I slowly reached into my food bag and pulled out a cracker. I took a slow step toward the deer and showed it the cracker (I know, feeding wildlife is not cool, but whatever I tried anyway). The deer sniffed the air, considered the cracker, and ultimately turned away. 
The deer circled back around and I repeated the experiment. The deer stepped toward me this time, but once again turned away. She was wild, and distrust of me was built into her. 
We watched the deer scamper off and watched the sunset. We smiled and laughed and were glad we were there.
The funny thing about those home stability dreams is how fast they fade. A week or two at home and they are gone, and I'm ready for unpredictability again. Our place is out here with the deer. I wouldn't have it any other way. This is where I can truly be happy.","Mile 618

Mile 633.6 to Pearisburg 
Last night we apparently camped in the deer Mecca. This was Amritsar, Varanasi, and Vatican City, but for deer. Those adorable doe eyed.... does, who make such great jerky and such horrid and inconvenient automobile accidents were rading our camp throughout the night. Deer after deer after deer, how I dearly love them. 
Bear Girl and I left this deer infestation and set out in search of crab rangoons and a Dairy Queen. We came to an overlook where we found a young couple who seemed very nervous at our arrival, I think we interrupted something. Good for them I say.
The trail past that was steadily down but was covered in hordes of giant millipedes, Narceus Amaricanus. The milipedes are not uncommon along the trail but today they appeared in massive herds, gathering on the trail and taking up the entire space, leaving no room to avoid them. I tiptoes around the piles of hundreds of crawling millipedes, looked a lot like an episode of Fear Factor. 
We hit the road, passed it purely out of habit, and then realized we were making a mistake and turned around. We started walking down into town. Here is a town that truly feels like America. Shirtless and mowing the lawn, every red blooded American was riding or pushing along, maintaining the US's largest and least useful crop with a beer between their legs. Every house had a few old cars sinking into their yards, every house had an inexplicable amount of stone or brick or mortar lying about. A lawnmower past us, riding down the road at at least 20 miles an hour, clearly it was suped up. 
One one porch we found a pot bellied sow lying about, free with no fence or restraints. We named her Porch Pork. Bear Girl and I snuck in for some pictured and tried not wake Porch Pork, who was napping in the hot southern sun.
We had some Chinese food, got to a hostel where I set up camp, and I had a shower and went to do my laundry. After that, it was off to Walgreens (they didn't even pay me to use their name). I got my second covid shot rather unceremoniously, I even had to ask the guy to fill out my vaccine card. Now I just have to wait to grow my tail and get my 5g boost, and I will be fully vaccinated.
I'm taking a zero tomorrow in case of side effects, hopefully that's simply in abundance of caution.
I stopped at the outfitter to replace the pole I broke. All they had was a few sets of lady poles, I took one and some tent stakes.
Bear Girl joined me for a blizzard and the two of us (quite litterally) hung about the hostel all night long, talking until well past dark. I've never found it so easy to talk to someone for so long, I am glad she is here and I hope she is happy.","Mile 633.6

This is a real American town. Here are loose pigs sleeping on porches, here are men riding their lawnmowers to the convenience store for two tall boys of Miller Lite and a pack of Marlboros. When they shut down the circus, everyone showed ended up at this Dairy Queen. This is freedom, this is unique, this is true American culture, and I love every bit of it.
Of course, I have to enjoy it through a post vaccine fog. Now that a second syringe of Moderna mRNA has been plunged into my arm, the side effects must be faced and conquered.
Phrase it just like that, faced and conquered, that makes you appear noble.
In reality, there's not much to it. I remember waking up last night with a slight chill, and I woke up this morning feeling like I had a light hangover. I'm not dealing with chills or shakes or growing a fourth toe out of my head or any of that. I'm a little tired. 
Tired enough to not really leave the yard of the hostel, sure, but still just tired.
I spent most of my day on those weird hammock chairs the hostel has. People came by, sometimes I said hi. I met Rooster and Pistol and Pinch. Bear Girl brought me food from the Hardee's. I didn't over much. 
After an exhausting day of napping and building antibodies, I did look up to see two redheads shining in the Virginia sun. The gangs all back together, Jill and Morgan are here with me again. 
We got some Mexican food and filled in each other on what we've been through the last few days (or has it been weeks?) 
Hopefully I can hike out of here tomorrow.","Pearisburg

The three of us, newly reunited, resupplied at the grocery store and I bought a fanny pack. Somehow this took us until noon.
We got back on trail and all agreed it was refreshing to be hiking together once again.
The midday heat was brutal, but the forest was well shaded. I hiked in nothing but my kilt and my shoes. It's time to work on my tan. 
We crossed a bridge and went by a massive factory. I told Jill they probably produce a bunch of smaller factories, it was a factory factory, where else would factories come from? Certainly not the stork.
That nonsense behind us the trail dipped back into the woods and climbed a hill up to a bald with a glorious view. 
Ahead was another long dry stretch. Water carries have been much more prominent in Virginia so far. This was a ten mile stretch with no water sources, so the three of us cooked dinner at the last spring and then filled everything we had.
I noticed while I was eating a rash spreading on my left leg, and a bit on my right. Not too itchy, but widespread. I hope it's not poison oak.
We followed the ridge until it was nearly dark. Jill and Morgan stopped to use the facilitrees and I kept on. I stopped when I heard something rummaging through the woods, rolling rocks around and stomping on leaves and sticks. It sounded a lot like a bear to me. I stood and waited for Jill and Morgan. They came and turned their headlamps toward the noises. We shouted and moved on past, causing the animal a bit of a disturbance but otherwise making it with no problems. I can't say for sure that it was a bear or not, but I am fairly confident it was.
We headlamped into camp through the dark. Morgan did a faceplate at one point but I think she's OK.
I discovered to my horror that my hammock straps were not with my hammock. I rigged it up with my rainfly straps and texted Bear Girl. I was lucky, she was still at the hostel and found them tied to the tree. That woman is lotterally a lifesaver.","Pearisburg

The trail provides. You hear it all the time, hikers from Katahdin to Springer utter these words repeatedly and the longer you stay on trail, the more you understand and the more certain you become that it's true. It's almost like, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, the trail actually likes us and wants to see us finish.
Today I sat in my hammock and watched Jill and Morgan pack up. I wanted to join them and put in a full day but I was anchored in that spot by my missing hammock straps. Bear Girl had them and probably wouldn't be here with them until 3 or 4.
I cursed myself repeatedly for being so careless and forgetting them. The night before had been horrid, the paranoid that usually holds up my rainfly stretched and without a doubt put an undue strain on my caribeanors, which were not designed to hold weight. I ended up sleeping in a weord crunched up position and woke up halfway through the night with an excruciating pain in my shoulder. 
I popped a Tylenol and prepared to say goodbye to Jill and Morgan when someone came Southbound and warned them of a rattlesnake eating a rabbit just down the trail. Another person stood just up from us and asked for help with a black snake that wouldn't leave the trail. We named the campsite The Viper Pit.
I stayed and hung out in place and spent my day warning people about their impending snake encounter, even long after the snake had likely shriveled off, it was a great conversation starter. 
Amazon and Outback rolled through at about noon, both of them slackpacking and spending another night at the hostel. I wished I had thought to get them to grab my straps so I could get moving, but there was no point in getting upset. It was what it was, I wasn't going anywhere until Bear Girl got in. 
I sweated in my hammock. I sweated overnight, I sweated when I hiked, I sweated when I rested, if it got any hotter I would probably sweat while I swam. Everyone who passed also sweated profusely. This was life now, we've finally gotten through the winter and it's jumped right into a brutal summer. 
At last, at around 3:30, Bear Girl and Rooster came in and delivered my suspension. I was saved and could hike on. I packed up my tarp as they stayed and talked. Pistol and Pinch showed up too and stopped in to discuss trail safety. We discussed so hard and my mind was so fixed on that ultra important concept that I walked away without my raintarp straps this time. Pinch yelled back for me and I felt like a moron as I took my pack back off and threw them inside. 
One of the caribeanors had been bent out by my weight. Bear Girl's pliers once again saved the day.
I hiked on through the light and warm rain, the precipitation was cool and refreshing, but the humidity was murder. I miss the bone dry air of Wyoming. 
I stopped at the first water source and filled my bottle, drank deeply, then filled it again. I hiked on a few more miles and stopped for supper. There u realized my water bottle was missing. I yelled out and searched I'm vain for it. I must have left it miles back at the water. 
My spirits sank and I hiked on with no water. I filled my cnoc when I could and drank straight through the filter.
I came to a shelter and found Bear Girl, Rooster, Pistol, and Pinch waiting for me. They warned me so oncoming rattle snake, coiled up on the trail. I walked on with caution but never saw it. Why are there so many snakes in this part of Virginia?
I just before dark I came to some trail magic, a 2019 hiker handing out drinks. I took one and greedily chugged it. I told the lady about my missing bottle and she handed me a new bottle that she had rolling around in the truck. The trail provides, indeed. ","Mile 650.5

Happy two month. 
I really can't remember the last time I had such a pleasant day. 
I awoke and left for the trail without delay, remembering all of my straps and gear this time. The trail was rocky at first (God I miss Rocky) but soon leveled out. I said goodmorning to a guy and asked how his day was going.
""Great! I just won a four-wheeler!"" 
That was all he said and I didn't see him again. How this man won a four-wheeler, or even found out he won a four-wheeler in this wilderness that is devoid of signal, is beyond me, but I guess it doesn't matter. Good for him, he's having a good day.
I got to where Jill and Morgan camped last night and found it empty. I was on the chase, I decided I wasn't stopping until I found them.
A snake came at me from the middle of the trail, and then veered off to the side. I don't know what kind he was, but he didn't rattle.
The trail descended to the Warspur Shelter, and next to that was a deep creek. I stuck my hand in the cold water and couldn't resist. It was unbearably hot that day and sweat was pouring off of me. I went up to be just out of sight, took off my shoes and kilt, and sat down in a deep pool. 
It was ecstacy. It was orgasmic. It was like that feeling when they bring out fresh orange chicken at the Chinese buffet. The cold water washed over me. I rubbed away the days of dirt that had collected all over me. I dipped my head underwater and washed my face. I stayed in until I was genuinely cold, and my feet were starting to lose feeling (this happens to me very easily) then I jumped up, put my kilt back on without bothering to dry myself, and hiked on. 
A climb started at just about the hottest part of the day, and just as I was getting dry and starting to sweat again. Just then, a thunderstorm came and soaked me, kicking up the wind while it was at it. There was no need for rain jackets today, the rain and wind were like air conditioning. It stopped as soon as hit started and I hiked on, refreshingly cool. I used to dread the rain, now these quick thunderstorm bursts were one of the pleasures of my life. 
I crossed Kelly's Knob and went down the other side. I met two ladies while I was eating supper and then, after moving on, heard them scream through the woods and I hurried up to see what was going on. The cause of the screan turned out to be a black snake, I told them to keep him around, he would keep the rattle snakes away. 
I hiked down through farm fields and found some trail magic. They gave me Gatorade and a sandwich. Pleasant days indeed. 
From there the trail climbs up to the top of the mountain, reveling first a sunset, then a bright orange moon rise. 
Jill whistled at me when I came into the shelter. I whistled back in our secret whistle. She yelled that it was good have me back.","Bailey Gap Shelter

I filled everyone's water bottles this morning, it was really good to be back with them both. We talked with a lady who was in the middle of a ""career crisis"" (hell of a way to describe quitting to thru hike, good on you lady) and we told her how to apply for Yellowstone.
The trail wasn't too bad at the beginning, a lot of downhill. Of course it was still hellishly hot and dry all day. 
We stopped for lunch and I dug out everything I had and started getting creative. It ultimately came down to caramel crisp cookies with sweet and spicy tuna lumped on top, drizzled with duck sauce I smuggled out of a Chinese restaurant and topped with just a bit of Wasabi. It was good and it looked fancy. That was some classy trail lunch. 
""Virginia is flat"" is the lie you most often hear. The week before this I was starting to beleive it, but now Virginia was getting back to her old self and throwing some climbs at us that felt straight out of North Carolina. 
The heat was hot, as some great songwriter once said (what a genius line). The heat was hot and the ground was dry. I had to tackle each climb crossing empty creek channels with an extra two liters of water in the cnoc strapped to my back. It added considerable weight, but was far better then the alternative, 8 or more miles without water.
We made a 1500 foot climb, followed the ridge a bit, then dropped down over the other side. There was a deep, wide creek at the bottom and I decided it was time to repeat yesterday's performance. I snuck down around the corner, took off my shoes and kilt, and jumped in, scrubbed the dirt and sweat off me for a second, but mostly just enjoyed the rush of cold water.
We made one more climb and considered staying at the shelter, but ultimately decided to push on just a but further and found one of the loveliest campsites we've yet seen, grassy and wooded.
We made mac and cheese and hung our food bags. In the meadow by camp I saw a quick green flash. Then another. And another. Lighting bugs, I realized. I hadn't seen lightning bugs in over 8 years. They were my favorite when I was kid, I used to sit and watch them glow in the back yard. They were magical to me. Now I lived far away, somewhere with no lightning bugs, but here they were, still blinking away.","Sarver Hollow Shelter

Mile 698.1 to Catawba Mountain Shelter 
The morning started with a burst of rain then sunshine. 
I climbed out of camp and made my way up the steep ascent towards the Dragon's Tooth. 
The trail followed a rocky ridge that took a lot of scrambling. It was hot. It's always hot nowadays it seems, but what's really getting me is the water carries. It the beginning it was never more then a few miles between sources and you never had to even think about water, now sources are 8 miles apart and I have to carry an extra liter in my cnoc. I feel the extra weight.
Dragon's Tooth is a monolithic rock outcropping at the mountain top. I dropped my pack and climbed up, realizing halfway up that I probably should have put on underwear under my kilt. Not worry about any unfortunate soul who might be following me, I reached up and touched the tip of it, then slowly worked my way back to safer ground and took in the views. 
Dragon's Tooth, along with McAfee Knob and Tinker Cliffs forms the ""Virginia Triple Crown"", three legendary spots along the trail, all of which I'll see in the next few days.
I stood for a while in the wind tunnel between the rocks, letting the breeze clear the sweat off my body while Jill and Morgan climbed on the rock. 
The path down was the steepest and rockiest on the trail so far. Lots of ""reverse donkey"" as a wise man once called it. 
A thunderous, spontaneous downpour hit us just after the mile of rock scrambling. It got so bad I put on my rain jacket. It stopped as quickly as it started but it was still enough to flood the trail and soak my shoes. 
At the bottom was a lady giving rides to the store for everyone. I bought as much as I could, had a pizza, was happy, and we all got stared at by locals. Except, of course, the ones who refused to look at us. 
I had the strangest interaction on he walk back to the trail:
A small group of cyclists came down the road and passed us. They had what looked like weeks worth of gear strapped to their saddle bags. There was one guy at the front who stopped and talked to me.
""How far are you hiking?"" He asked
""All the way,"" I answered, ""how far are you biking?""
""All the way,"" he said, ""we're going for the west coast."" 
I stopped at that, and looked at him in admiration. I've had the pleasure in my life to meet some very impressive people, people who have achieved things I can only dream of, and these meeting always bring a certain look to my face, but this was the first time that look was staring right back at me.
We were two people out chasing our dreams, following our ambitions and pushing ourselves to our absolute limits, and we both had one another's respect. This might as well have been Bob Dylan meeting The Beatles, or Orson Welles having a fistfight with Ernest Hemingway. We stood as equals, each basking in the others admiration. With little else to say, I nodded my head to him, and he nodded back to me, and we both turned to face our own paths. I hope they make it to the west coast.

Catawba Mountain Shelter to Daleville
We were up before the sun and I packed up my hammock in the moonlight. I snuck out of camp, trying not to wake anyone. It was hard to pack up without light, I need to get a new headlamp.
It was refreshing to hike in the cold night air instead of the sweltering heat of the past few days. It was also a rush to try and beat the sun. 
The top was only two miles up. I ran in the dark with my pack. I came to a rocky area and found a little side trail on the left and followed it out to a rock outcropping and there it was McAfee Knob.
McAfee Knob is often called the most photographed spot on the AT (whether it truly is or not is up for debate) and it earns this title. Of course everyone sees the mandatory picture out on the rock but what noone ever shows you is the view. 
Mist and thick fog clung to the hills and mountains below, drifting over the miles and miles of dwarfed mountains under the knob. The sun shined through a few holes in the puffy clouds sending rays of sunlight down onto the land below, while dark storm clouds hung ominously to the south. It was the most stunning view I've seen on the trail. 
I walked out to the point and stared at the cliff below my feet, then the ring of mountains around me. This will be a morning I remember, one of those rare moments that I will always recall, a view that I will never forget.
The day stayed refreshingly cool. I hiked on along the ridges and came to Tinker Cliffs, completing the ""Virginia Triple Crown"" (whatever that means). After the cliffs we got a light rain and hiked on into town.
Somehow hiking is harder on town days. Any other day you can simply resign yourself to hiking on and be content, but the promise of town food gives you something to hope for and push for, and somehow makes the hike exhausting. We're getting a room tonight and taking a zero tomorrow.","Catawba Mountain Shelter

Today was low key. We hitched a ride out to Walmart where Jill and Morgan got their second covid shots. There was some sort of demo happening on the parking lot and someone was cooking up free samples of food, we went through and got as many samples as we could. 
We hitched back in a truck with two big dogs who loved us and we loved them. Otherwise we pretty much just ate food all day. Solid day, not gonna lie.","Daleville

Daleville to Wilson Creek Shelter
We packed up the room and went to the outfitter, where I bought my third headlamp of the trip and some replacement tent stakes (I have a habit of breaking mine while I stomp them into the ground). 
With that done all that was left was to cross the deadly highway and hike on. 
About a mile in we found a sign on a tree that read ""1/3 of the way to Katahdin"". We all agreed we felt like we could do that two more times. 
We climbed up past the first shelter, which was .1 off the trail. I decided to hike up and go to the shelters water source. Upon arrival I pulled out my filter and discovered that I had been carrying an extra liter all day and had no clue. I filtered that and stepped back on trail.
At some point I came to a fence on what looked to be an old logging road. It was one of those short fences with no connections on either side and a narrow place to pass through. Someone had written ""This fence makes no sense!"" in big letters on the fence. Someone else wrote ""it's to stop horses"", to which another replied ""horses settled the wild west you moron, it's for cars"" ""well my Jeep could plow right through this"" ""your Jeep wouldn't make it up here, it's for the horses!"" ""the horses can walk around!"" ect ect. The argument graffiti spilled out all over the wooden fence, full of arguments and name calling. I laughed at the absurdity and pettiness and went on my way.
The weather was almost suspiciously nice today. Cool and clear, not cold and not hot, just perfect.
We rolled in to the shelter and found Misha cooking with a couple of other hikers. One guy packed out a pineapple and was grilling it over an open fire. He cut it up and passed out grilled pineapple chunks to everyone. I went to bed in my hammock early.","Daleville

Wilson Creek Shelter to Jennings Creek
Maybe it was the lack of sleep last night, but today really felt like a slog. The trail was easy, the views were gorgeous, someone even left some water and a nice note on trail, and yet I felt a bit sluggish, like I had seen it all before and like every hill was just another climb that led to nowhere. 
Was this the ""Virginia Blues"" I had been warned about? Or was the length of the trail starting to wear on me? I doubted it. It was just a tired day, I should make a point to get more sleep tonight.
The thought of quitting, I hear at least, crosses everyone's mind at least once. I have been spared so far (but I'm only 1/3 of the way in after all), but I can't imagine anything short of emergency driving me off the trail. For one thing, hiking is one of my few true passions, even in every day life. What would I even do? Quit then hike somewhere else anyway? For another thing, I've got too many people who would be disappointed, myself most of all. I don't think I could live with being a quitter. Bit third and most of all, it hasn't been bad. At all. In fact it's been one of the pleasures of my life to be able to be out here on the trail. So with that in mind I stepped on. 
I put in 17 miles and came to Jennings Creek, where Morgan had left me a note saying where to camp and find her. There was also a note about a campground with cheeseburgers and milkshakes and a free shuttle to and from the trail. We tried to call for the shuttle, but their phone must have been disconnected. We called over and over with no answer. We tried to hitch a ride but there were hardly any cars, and none of them would stop.
""I hope you get in a very minkr car accident and noone is hurt but you are sufficiently inconvenienced!"" I called after one as it passed by and left us on the side of the road. 
It came down to walking. It was only a mile away and we decided we could use the exercise (sarcasm face) so we took a stroll down the road. 
We all dreamed about the milkshakes on the walk.
""What if they're closed?"" I asked as we went down the road. 
""At least we had a nice walk,"" Morgan said.
Jill and I both looked at her, hostily. 
""Just what I needed,, a walk,"" I said sarcastically. ""If it's closed I'm setting the place on fire."" 
""I'll smash up the windows and tear up some boards."" Jill started.
""I'll commit arsen and go to prison,"" I confessed. 
We got there 30 minutes after closing, but before I could throw a chair through the window and start a riot, the owner came out and asked if we needed anything.
We asked for food and she said the grill was closed but the fryer was still on and she wouldn't mind making us some food. I bought a few beers and some supplies while I was at it.
She fried up some onion rings and made us milkshakes. We thanked her repeatedly.
We walked back to camp though the lightning bugs. I hung my hammock in a most impractical spot over the creek, at a place where I had to walk out in the water to hang. Why on Earth I did this I confess I do not know.","Wilson Creek Shelter

Jennings Creek to Thunder Hill Shelter 
Last night, as I slept so peacefully, with my hammock out over the creek bank and no rainfly, some crazed drunk woman saw fit to wander over and shine her headlamp at me. 
""HI there! I haven't met you! What's your name?"" She asked as she rudely shined her light in my face and woke me up. 
I guessed the time was around midnight. ""What the hell is wrong with you!?"" I shouted.
""I have to pee,"" she said in her defense.
""I don't care, go pee then, I'm sleeping here! Go pee and don't shine a light in people's tents!"" 
She wandered off and didn't come back. 
I told everyone about it at breakfast and we all had a good laugh. Apparently Morgan and Misha had both heard her blabbering all kinds of nonsense the night before. She poked up out of her hammock and yelled about how cold it was, we all left without saying a word to her. I'm fairly certain she was just out camping, not a thru hiker.
The morning air was cool and crisp and tasted to me like adventure. I charged out of camp and ran up the first hill, full of energy. I crossed over a mountain and down the other side, stopping only to filter water, until a few miles led me to Bryant Ridge Shelter. 
It was a beauty. Probably the biggest Shelter I'd seen on the trail. Guthooks said it had space for 20 people, I'd say that was a sharp underestimate. You could fit 20 on just the second floor, comfortably, and the first floor was nearly twice that size. I climbed up to the loft and gazed out at the woods. I wished I could have spent the night here. 
After the shelter was a forever climb up Bryant Ridge itself. By the time I crested the hill, I was drenched in sweat and shirtless. At the top, a deer stepped out in front of me and stopped to stare. I looked back and saw a tiny fawn stumble out of the brush and waddle over to its mother's legs. The little spotted fawn gazed over at me, and when it saw I was a human jumped into the brush and ran wildly. It's mother followed. I smiled and watched them bound away. 
I stopped and ate lunch with Jill and then as we left we came across the largest snake I've seen on trail climbing up a tree. I stared, shocked. I've heard that snakes can climb trees but I can't think of another time when I actually caught one slithering up the trunk. It was at least a five footer. Jill asked how they managed to get vertical and climb like that, I told her I had no idea. Snakes have always been a mystery to me. 
We found Morgan near Cornelius Creek Shelter (I though it was fun to call it Yukon Cornelius, but noone else knew who Yukon Cornelius was). Apparently Morgan had come across a rattlesnake, hers wasn't climbing a tree though. 
I went out to Black Rock overlook and climbed up on the rock to enjoy the view. When I tried to leave I realized i couldn't get back down the same way I came up. I sat up there a bit perplexed about what to do, and finally decided to make a slide for it. I landed on my feet without scraping myself up or tearing my kilt. I called that a victory. 
A thick fog gathered at the top of Apple Orchard Mountain, I couldn't see anything past a few feet. I left the summit and entered the more ominously named Thunder Hill Wilderness. The trail turned to a rocky mess. I climbed and clamored my way down off the mountain. I passed under a rock formation called The Guillotine and thankfully didn't lose my head. I rolled into Thunder Hill Shelter, made supper and called it a day. 
""Are you suffering from exhaustion and lethargy? Do you find yourself soaking wet and miserable at all hours and in all weather's? Are your legs and arms and face covered in dirt and a plethora of strange rashes? Are there blisters on your blisters? Do you find yourself screaming into the void every night because you've become a hobo? Do you chaff? Are you pooping in a hole that you dug and burying your own sense of decency with it?

Thunder Hill Shelter to Glasgow Shelter
It rained all night but was surprisingly sunny in the morning when I got up. I left the Tuunder Hill Shelter and followed the ridge for a few miles before beginning to climb (chuckles) to climb (holds back a laugh) to climb Highcock Knob. 
It was hard, working our way up Highcock. But with perseverance we worked our way right up to the tip, working through the bush and sweating all the while. But we came, we saw, and we climbed the Highcock. 
""It's probably named after a chicken or something,"" Morgan clarified.
""Why do you think I'm laughing? It's the thought of a stoned rooster!"" I replied.
Up at the very top, Rogue was sitting on a rock that said ""tip of the Highcock"" and laughing hysterically. 
After all that NSFW nonsense, it was practically all downhill. Miles and miles of downhill. My feet ache now on the downhills worse then the uphill, but at least I don't sweat as much. 
I saw a sign that said ""no jumping off the James River Foot Bridge"" and looked around for some way to tear down or defile it. I wanted to burn the sign just to send a small message to whatever fascist cowards decided jumping off the bridge was illegal. I've read that the local police like to sit and watch the bridge, handing out tickets to whoever jumps, because apparently the police in this town feel so small and pathetic that they need to harass hikers just to feel important, lord knows there's no real police work to be done. 
You could say I overreact to things like this, but I am strongly of the opinion that if I want to jump off a bridge noone has any right to stop me, so long as the bridge is public property. Sure, if I jump off the bridge I might die. There could be rocks, or odd currents, or a thousand other things and they might kill me. But why is that anyone problem but my own? I beleive people have a right to get themselves killed and as long as they don't involve anyone else in their stupidity I don't think it's anyone's business but their own. We should take down this ""no jumping"" sign and replace it with a sign that reads ""jumping might kill you and so we strongly discourage it"" and leave people to make their own decisions. And send those cops away and make them do something productive for a change. 
The ironic thing is that I had no intention of jumping off the bridge. There could be rocks, and I wasn't risking my thru hike now that I was almost 800 miles in. I jumped into a small stream instead, just to cool off and enjoy the last few miles. 
The James River Foot Bridge is, ironically enough, named after a man named Foot. I went my entire day thinking it was simply a bridge that only allowed foot travel, but no, I was the Foot Bridge, not simply a footbridge. It was also the longest footbridge on the Appalachian Trail.
I crossed and did not jump off, but I raise a fist to anyone who does. 
We sat along the road with our thumbs out for twenty minutes before a man in a construction truck took pity on us and spun around to pick us up.
He gave us a ride into town and dropped us at the town shelter. The town of Glasgow apparently loves us so much that the entire town pitched in to build a shelter in the middle of town, and it is luxurious. There's trash, a shower, towels, books, and electricity, all for free. A paradise for thru hikers. 
We had dinner at Scotto's, an Italian place that seemed to be the only thing in town. The people in the booth next to us bought us a pitcher of beer. I love this kindhearted little town of Glasgow.","Thunder Hill Shelter

Glasgow Shelter to Mile 802.3
Last night, in the midst of my drunkness, Dad called and said he was coming down. In his usual madman style, he was working until 6 am, going in for a root canal, sleeping for three hours then making his way to wherever I was. 
Reservoir road, Mile 802.3, I decided. 
We resupplied and tried to hitch out of Glasgow, but were soon offered a ride by the local hostel, $5 for the group, which we took. This is only the second time I've paid for transportation to the trail. 
We shared a ride with a fellow named DB. I got excited and asked him if he was D B Cooper, he said yes without the slightest hint of humor in his voice. I appreciate that. 
Jill didn't know who D B Cooper was, and I told the whole story of his daring escapade with the fullest enthusiasm (D B Cooper has always been a personal hero of mine).
Jill and Morgan laughed at my odd passions. Just yesterday Morgan asked me if I've ever read ""On the Road"" and I flew into a rage about how much I despise that book and Jack Kerouac (although to be fair I've only read On the Road so I really shouldn't say I don't like Kerouac, maybe his other stuff is good, but my God On the Road is awful (sorry fans of On the Road)). Apparently I have strong feelings about odd things.
We met a friendly and eccentric ridge runner named Spider. She was full of energy and odd humor and general weirdness. I liked her immediately. She told me she was in a band called ¿Bannana? and they had an album on spotify called Reading the Room. I listened to it while I climbed, and it is straight fire, great stuff, highly recommended. 
The climb was forever, and I had an extra liter of water strapped to my back. I climbed and climbed until I thought I would pass out. I sweated more water then I could possibly be carrying. At last, Bluff Mountains summit came into view, marked by a plaque commemorating a child who escaped a school in the area whose body was found there way back in the day. 
After that, it was all descent. We found one spot, still up high, which showed off a mixture of tall, thick, old trees and low, vibrant green brush. That's my favorite kind of forest in the east. 
Deer ran before us and the sun started sinking low when we came across ""800"" spelled out in pine cones. Another hundred miles down.
We got to the road, crossed a suspension bridge and set up camp. Dad rolled in with 20 chicken tenders and some beers and fries. I was happy to see him, and tomorrow he is slackpacking us, which will be a big help because tomorrow's climb up Bald Knob is even longer.","Glasgow Shelter

Mile 802.3 to Salt Log Gap
Slackpacking is such a joy. We woke up and had breakfast and Dad hiked with us the first two miles. We left our bags, out food, and our camping gear in the truck and carried only a water bottle, a filter, and a snack in a little drawstring bag.
I made it in to the former Brown Creek Mountain Settlement, a former community of freed slaves that lived in this stretch of beautiful creekside property before ""deciding"" to sell it to the US Forest Service (I hope they got paid five times what their land was worth but I doubt it). The site was full of old stone walls and other little bits of history, mostly reclaimed by nature and only visible to the keen eye. I took a bath in the creek then climbed up to the road.
Dad pulled in, popped a few of his root canal pills, and set up trail magic. I told him what we missed most was watermelon, and he showed up with slices of one. We ate and took lunch, along with a guy named Slim Shady (please stand up) and a fellow named City Slicker. We asked City Slicker what city he was from and he retorted that he was a farmer, he didn't even have cell signal where he lived. He seemed perplexed by his trail name. Apparently some cowboy had named him that, must have been the work of Dallas Woody.
We left just as The Chads rolled in. The Chads were becoming our mortal enemies. I hate to complain about people, but I actually love it and I'm absolutely about to. They're nice people, don't get me wrong, but we were trying so hard to lose them. They are cliquey as can be, they don't even really acknowledge everyone else, they only really seem to be interested in themselves and eachother. They also take up more space then any group of nine ever should. They will show up to a shelter and simply become the shelter, like a swarm of locusts they will overtake any space and choke out all other life. They are loud as can be every night until late and then up early and loud as can be all morning. I hope they all make it to Katahdin, I hope they have the time of their lives, but I wish they would get head or behind us and leave us alone.
We've been trying to lose them for two weeks now it would seem. We speed up, they speed up. We take a zero, they take a zero. There has got to be some way of losing these insufferable Chads. 
Somehow Rainman seems to be he only one capable of breaking through their ranks and interacting with them. Rainman is a creature of the wilds. Eccentric, talkative, insightful, and probably insane, we all admired him from a bit of a distance. I liked him. 
We're all in agreement that we miss our trail family. I joked that we should round up our entire group and face off with The Chads at the base of Katahdin, an Anchorman style brawl, loser has to quit the trail. We could even get Raindance to be the referee. Morgan said she wondered if we could win, I said we had Amazon, they wouldn't stand a chance, she's a marine. 
I suppose we needed a villian.
After the trail magic was a forever climb up Bald Knob. We hardly noticed the climb without our packs. Oddly enough, Bald Knob is not a bald, it's entire face is tree covered. Directly after, however, is Cole Mountain, a half mile bald, extremely beautiful, followed by miles of rolling, high ridge meadows. It was beautiful.
There was trail magic where Dad picked us up. We got sandwiches. They were beautiful. Dad drove us down and found us a campsite. We sat around and reminisced for a few hours before bed. 
I got out everything in my pack I wanted to send home. No more bag liner, pillow, thermal pants, shorts, rain pants, or pack cover. Most shocking, however, is my decision to send home the brain of my pack. I hung up some socks to dry but the moths swarmed them. I took them off the drying line before the bugs could eat holes in them. ","Mile 802.3

Salt Log Gap to Tye River
Another day of slackpacking. I could get used to Dad being around to shuttle my bag around, and just to be around in general. It's good to have family here.
Dad came up with us for the first two miles then turned back for the truck. I met a guy who had been to Scotland and he said he loved my kilt.
More ups and downs. I was thinking about cooking all day today. When I get home I plan to learn to cook, and cook well. I want to make homemade pasta, and roll my own sushi, and make curries from scratch. All my favorites that I can't make out here. Another goal for the after trail days.
I've been thinking a lot about the triple crown too. The lifestyle is addictive, I don't know if I can stop at just the AT.
My mom texted me today. It turns out that Gunner the dog, my original hiking partner who I found the trail with all those years ago, has cancer and may only live another few months. He's old and has had a happy life, and I'm glad he got old enough to see me set out on the trail. I'm visiting him when I get home, it may be the last time I see him. He's a good boy forever, I'll make it to Katahdin for him.
I went up to Spy Rock (cool name and great view, highly recommended) and met a couple who asked the age old question ""how do you afford this?""
I don't know why people think it's so expensive to be homeless in the woods for six months. Anyone who is not saddled with extreme debt or children could live modestly and be a janitor for a year and have enough money for the trail, and maybe work another two or three months if they don't have any gear. I answered ""by never owning a house or apartment and not spending my money on anything else"". 
""What about your career?""
""The trick is to not have one,"" I said with remarkable candor. 
They seemed confused. A lot of people look confused when I tell them that I'm a seasonal worker with no real skills who only works eight months a year at best and yet travels the world. That's the perks of employee housing and dining, it makes life cheap. Every penny I earn goes right to my travel fund, my entire cost of living is paid in full and I don't have room for olive drab furniture sets. 
Some people have asked me if I have rich parents. I had a comfortable life but they both work in a chocolate factory (Yes I'm serious) and no they aren't rich and no they don't pay for any of my travels. It's really just the lack of olive drab furniture. 
Leaving this couple to ponder, I ascended The Priest. The Priest Shelter is world famous in the thru hiking community. Not for the shelter, it's average and honestly fairly unremarkable, but for it's logbook. The Priest logbook is where we thru hikers confess our sins and transgressions. It's a time to be honest about what we've been doing on the trail. 
""Forgive me Father for I have sinned"" reads the entries. The first was ironically from the day we started, and the book was mostly full. It overflowed with the expected stories of people not hanging their food bags, peeing on the trail (thank God it's not just me), doing drugs, having sex, telling lies and other such debauchery. There was a few standouts. Someone confessed that they had defecated on the trail and thrown it off a cliff. Another confessed to stealing from someone's food bag when he got hungry. There were hundreds of confessions, some were barely sins and others were downright disturbing.
Since the book was full, I wrote mine on the front cover. ""I build mounds instead of digging holes, I steal from the restaurants, and I'm writing on the front cover of this journal. Forgive me father"" -Smuggler
The way down from the priest was four miles and rocky, uneven terrain the whole way. More then once, I eneded up in a swarm of black flies and ran down the trail. I found Dad set up and doing trail magic. Ironically enough, another hiker was there and she went to high school with me, graduating two years ahead of me. Her name was French Fry.
We camped by the river. I took a camp chair and sat it in the water, letting the minnows pick away at the callouses on my toes.","Salt Log Gap

Tye River to Mile 850
First thing in the morning we drove out to some little country store that had nothing to offer us. Dad asked for coffee and was told there was no more. Then someone came in and refilled his cup. Dad asked again for coffee and found the store owner about to dump the pot out. She said it was old, he said he wanted some anyway. It apparently tasted fine and was even still hot. 
Another hiker was out there and seemed so horribly confused he had no idea where he was. I hope he makes it back to the trail.
We climbed up from the river and Jill had to sit down, she had become stricken with carsickness on the ride back. I climbed up the side of Three Ridges until I came to a water source and stopped to refill. On a whim I read the comments on guthooks for the Harper's Creek Shelter that was around the corner. Apparently, back in April, three vicious dogs were living at the shelter, attacking hikers. Gear was spread around as if people had to leave in a hurry, and one comment spoke of some valiant battle with them where three hikers faced off with the canines, barring themselves in the shelter with the picnic table and battling them with their poles, sustaining multiple injuries. There were no comments after April, which suggests to me that everyone else has been killed by the dogs.
Starburst showed up, that kind fellow who fed me a pizza back at the Partnership Shelter back when I was still wearing pants. We caught up, and he said Dad hooked him up with breakfast that morning. 
Jill and Morgan caught up and we all passed the shelter together, no sign of mad dogs. 
Today was the worst humidity I've seen in years. The upper half of Three Ridges was shrouded in clouds. The air was heavy with water, like living in the lungs of a pneumonia patient. It would not rain and the wind would not blow, it just sat,, still and stagnant and hot and wet. Sweat was running off me in rivers. I felt like a noodle.
The view at the top was the solid white of fog. Jill got a bit of service and was delighted to find that Creech remembered their two year anniversary (I didn't bother to mention to her that I reminded him of it last week when she said he would probably forget, always look out for your bros). 
I met Syrup, although her dog Maple was taking a zero that day. She had seen a rattlesnake and Morgan saw a copperhead. We're still thick in the snakes.
Dad was laying in his hammock near the Gap at ten miles. Apparently someone had spent the morning talking his ear off about how he ""knows a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy"" that was hiking near here and a mountain lion jumped out toward his girlfriend, meaning to pounce on her but the boyfriend heroically grabbed ahold of the lion in midair, spun it around, and threw it off a cliff. I laughed hysterically. People are fool enough to believe nearly anything it would seem.
Other then the occasional escaped pet (which is far more common then you'd think, they just pulled an escaped alligator out of the Susquehanna) there are no mountain lions in the Appalachians, no matter what anyone says.
One of The Chads apparently hurt his ankle, and they are all taking three days off to let it heal. I hope it heals up fine for him, and they enjoy their three days rest. Actually, I hope they enjoy it so much they take three more.
We decided to go down to Devil's Backbone Brewery, a hiker friendly place that let's hikers sleep and shower for free. We were only ten miles in and didn't plan on spending the night, but that's just the sort of business I like to support and brewery food sounded delightful.
We rode down with Cousin Eddie and had dinner with him. Cotton Candy stopped by, and to all of our amazement, Ninja even rolled in. For a brief moment I hoped that the rest of the crew would be with her, but it turns out that she had pushed on on her own. 
We only had one beer so that we could still hike. We put in another five miles before dark. Morgan and Jill, in a plot to cause me great annoyance, started singing a song by Florida Georgia Line, which is the single worst thing to ever happen to the human ear. I would prefer chronic tinnitus to their music, it's the worst thing to happen to humanity since fascism. I'm not sorry. Anyway, they sang because they knew I hated it so I slightly overreacted and threw handfuls of tiny rocks at them until they stopped (not the sort to injure, just enough to annoy.)
The interaction left me in an angry mood for the last few miles. I felt some urge to punch a tree but I'm not an idiot or a hormonal teenager, so I decided to not do that. My sour mood receded when it got dark and we got a view of the lights of town below, then found Dad and realized he already had camp set up. It was a good day.","Tye River

Mile 850 to Rockfish Gap
As is my usual habit, I left camp in the morning. The last few days have been full of brutal climbs and rugged terrain, but today was different. It was a gentle, rolling ridge. It was clear and even a little cool in the morning. Spirits were high. 
I fell back behind and hiked with Dizzy for a while. I got in the zone, put my head down and was cruising right along when I looked down and  aught myself just in time before making a terrible mistake. I stumbled and reared back, I was inches away from stepping on a massive rattlesnake. He was thick and covered the entire width of the trail, but more of him was hidden in the brush. 
He blocked the entire way. There was no walking around him. I thought it best to get him off the trail, for everyone's safety, his included. I tried the bear method at first. I clapped my hands and shouted ""Hey bear! Get out of here!"" but the snake didn't budge. I realized I had been a fool and that this was no bear, so bear tactics wouldn't work. I clapped my hands and shouted ""Hey snake! Get out of here!"" A black tongue and a bored look were the only response.
I picked up a handful of twigs and rocks and threw them at its body (not enough to hurt, just enough to annoy) but the snake still didn't budge. He just surveyed me with his black tongue. I resorted to using my trekking poles. I poked at him until he started to, reluctantly, move ahead. He exposed his rattles, but would not use them. I couldn't resist the urge to hear them, so I rattled them myself with my pole. He stopped again on trail. He was certainly a stubborn snake. I tried to get under him with my pole, thinking I could fling him into the woods. He did not react kindly. He turned and struck at my poles. I gave him a light tap and tried to throw him again but he was too big. He bit at my poles again and slithered in to the brush, with only his head and his venomous fangs sticking out. The little black tongue surveyed me further. I worried that with just a head sticking out He might be an even greater danger, but decided it was past time to move on and leave him be. Harassing snakes is an act of love, both for hikers and for snakes. They need to learn to fear humans, because too many of us out here would try to do him harm. I hope he lives on and doesn't bite anyone. 
I strolled on, climbed Humpback rocks, and found Dad waiting past the shelter.
The last few miles of trail were a smorgasbord, especially with Dad's keen eyes helping me. Black raspberries grew thick on both sides, most weren't ripe yet. In another week or two this place would be a buffet, but I found a few that were ripe. Blackberries and red raspberries grew as well, although none of them were ready yet. Honeysuckle was everywhere. I grabbed the blossoms, pulled the little stem out to get that tiny drop of sweet nectar and drank it down. The tiny drops are probably not enough to save a man who's dying of thirst, but they are just enough for a burst of flavor. 
I caught a few crayfish in a stream and Dad found chicken of the woods mushrooms. One of these days on a zero I should gather up some wild mushrooms and catch enough crayfish for a boil, but for now we each left our quarry to brave the world another day. I could live for some time on crayfish and black raspberries, not to mention the squirrels and rabbits that cross the trail so frequently. I think I could survive.
I picked honeysuckle the whole way back until the thunder got louder and I stepped up my pace. Cousin Eddie found us again and we gave him a ride into town. Jill and Morgan and Eddie went to sleep at a YMCA Pavillion while Dad and I got a hotel room for the night.","Mile 850

Rockfish Gap to Turk Gap
It occurs to me that I can probably stop starting these entries with ""I tore down camp"". I'm sure everyone reading this is capable of hearing about my day starting on the trail and assuming that I tore down camp at some point.
So I tore down camp and left the hotel and Dad drove me up to Rockfish Gap. We left Jill and Morgan to hitch back on their own. I crossed the bridge and entered the Shennies, starting with a short road walk and a pointless climb through thick vegetation. The blackberries were thicker then ever, but won't be ripe for weeks here. Whoever comes through next month should be well fed.
I saw The Chads doing a southbound slackpack, and realized that my hopes of losing them while they were staying in their cabin were lost, The Chads were still getting their miles in. Dad got a ride to Turk Gap from the mother of one of the Chads. He said she was very nice but that she had a poodle that snarled at him the entire time.
Dad waited for me at Beagle Gap. We heard someone shouting to the south and turned to see a hiker chase out a bear from the trail. That makes twelve bears, if anyone's keeping count.
The guy who sighted the bear came down to talk with us. He was local and claimed to know the park very well, we asked if he knew of any good campsites coming up.
""Oh yeah there's a beautiful, postcard perfect site coming up shortly. You leave here and cross over Little Calf Mountain, great view, and after that you climb through some thick forests and some old apple orchards, this place all used to be apple orchards. Now after that there's a side trail but don't take that, no you're going to go up the AT to the summit then down the other side. You know the summit has this really interesting rock pile, everyone throws a rock up there. Now after the summit there's a trail to the shelter but you don't go there. You keep going until you...."" for twenty minutes until neither one of us was listening or following and even if we had would never have been able to follow these absurd directions.
In the afternoon, the rain picked up, suddenly and unexpectedly. It started pouring so hard, I joked with Dad that Top must be catching back up to us. He said he heard that Top was in Waynesboro and I cursed the man's name, it will be raining for weeks if Top is with us again. 
We got back to the truck and Slim Shady told us it would be an 8 mile (haha) water carry so I got Dad to drive up the road four miles and hid myself a water and a Gatorade under a log. ","Rockfish Gap

Turk Gap to Blackrock Hut
I fell off a bit of a wagon today. I've been free of caffeine for two years now, but last night I saw a container of Mio energy in my dad's truck and threw it in my food bag.
This morning, while tramping through the thick vegetation that lines this part of the trail and keeps you from seeing anything (not to mention soaks you as you pass) I was feeling tired and beat. I had my pack back on, Dad left that morning, I didn't sleep great, everything seemed against me. I stopped and dug up that water and Gatorade I hid (Dad got there before me and added a note) and drank it when I remembered that I had a shot of happiness and energy in my bag. I lifted the little bottle, unscrewed the cap of my water, and turned the clear liquid red with cherry flavored energy drink. 
Caffine may sound like an odd thing to give up. Most people don't think twice about it, their morning coffee or tea is as standard a part of their day as brushing their teeth, most don't even think of it as a drug. But of everything I've encountered in my life, I think caffine has by far held the most sway, and for the longest time. 
I remember those first ten years of my life when my parents were still married. They worked opposite schedules, 12 hour days at the chocolate factory. Any time one of them worked a day of overtime, I was taken to Nana and Paps house. I loved Nana and Paps. It was a peaceful, kindhearted, welcoming, and ever so wholesome place. There was no sound of my parents screaming at one another, Nana never yelled, and Pap only seemed to get angry or yell if the Phillies were on (Pap claims to love baseball to this very day, but truthfully I think he just watches it to get all his anger out for the week, so that he can be his kind self the rest of the time). 
Anytime I was dropped off, me and Nana would spend the morning together until Pap got home from golf, then he'd take over for the day. He always wanted to teach me something. One day, it was clocks. He showed me how to read the time, he disassembled a clock and showed me the innards of it, and made sure I understood. Another time it was chess. He taught me how to use each piece, how to open up and form a solid defense, and how to get people into check-mate and win the game. Soon I was unstoppable at recess. He gave me his homemade chess set that he used to play on when he took lunch breaks back when he was a stone mason, before he worked at the chocolate factory, and it's one of my most prized possessions. Pap was a skilled carpenter and he showed me how to build (although as my woodshed teacher will tell you I never did get very good at it). He taught me archery, baking, how to catch a squirrel and release it off a bridge so that it would have to swim to shore and never come back and eat off the bird feeder again, you name it. And the entire time, he had a cup of coffee in his hand.
The only time Pap ever stopped drinking coffee was when he made a cup of tea instead. I, of course, was so enthralled with Pap and his life lessons that I wanted to be just like him, so I tried to drink coffee too. It was horrible. I hated it at first taste, so Pap showed me how to make tea and put lots of sugar and milk in it. We would sit at the chess board, or watching the Phillies, or in his garage/workshop, him with his coffee, me with my tea. Then I slowly lost my taste for the milk and sugar,  then brought it back but this time in coffee, until by the time I was twelve we were both chugging cups of black coffee all day long. 
I fell so madly in love with the stuff. I had a cup every morning, no matter what. I would carry some with me at school and drink it halfway through the day. I started buying fancy coffees and teas at specialty shops, I became friends with the baristas anywhere I went and got them to teach me how to make espresso and how to steam milk. I lived the life. I was always high energy, jacked up on whatever I drank that morning, loving every minute of it. I couldn't function without my coffee. People rarely saw me without a full cup.
I had to wonder if it was really healthy though. Sure, I drank on occasion, I smoked a bit from time to time, I'd even taken a few mind melting, reality bending things in my time, but I could go without them, they could be denied me, and that was fine, in fact I often went through long periods of simply not wanting any if those things. Not coffee. Coffee controlled every thought in the morning. I didn't put on clothes, I didn't talk to anyone, I didn't do anything until I had my coffee. I even kept canned coffee drinks when I worked in Yellowstone out of fear that the frequent power outages would deny me my morning cup. Combine that with a plague of stomach pains (which I probably should've seen a doctor about but as it is I didn't) and my anxiety being through the roof at the time (this is when I was about 24, Pap was going through major surgery, a woman I was very deeply in love with couldn't figure out if she wanted to stay with me or return home for a more normal life, I was about to go to Asia for the first time, I had just spent a night taking care of a close friend who someone had roofied and who knows what might have happened had I not been there, and a thousand other things that led to a mental state on the verge of cracking made so much worse by my ever increasing caffine consumption) and I decided it had to stop.
""I'm giving up coffee,"" I told Pap, who was finally out of the hospital and enjoying a cup on his own porch again. He was confused, but Pap is the sort to support me even if he doesn't understand my reasoning. 
I gave up coffee, tea, sodas, large amounts of chocolate, anything caffinated. 
It was miserable at first, I was forever on the verge of murder, but as time passed I slowly adapted, and soon found that I felt perhaps better then before. I had my energy in the mornings, I didn't need my coffee for it. I told everyone that giving up caffine was the best thing that ever happened to me. 
Once my abstinence from caffine even caused me to abandon all influence of eastern religion in my life philosophy and embrace a more punk rock approach to life, but that's a story for another day.
But now, two years in, I feel tired. I feel like I need a boost, a little pick me up, and it's really no wonder. If there was ever a time to crave stimulants, surely it was now. I gulped down the bottle and felt that old familiar surge of happy excitement. I wore a huge smile the rest of the day, I ran through the hills, talked to everyone I met. I asked people their names, their favorite color, what they would name their dogs, anything. I loved the trail and the world. I even enjoyed my talk with The Chads today.
Pennsylvania is now only a few weeks away, I realized, and when I get there I think I'm going to have a cup of coffee with Pap, and maybe a game of chess.
With my newfound energy I went as far as Blackrock Hut, where I found Ninja setting up her tent and decided to call this a happy day (albeit a low mileage one) and I set up my hammock. The Chads pressed on to the campsite 7 miles ahead, where Jill was staying tonight. The rocky ground around the shelter made for perhaps the worst tarp setup I've ever had. One stake is protruding out of the ground, another is wrapped around a tree. There's a laurel bush sticking up into the front,  making a flat lay impossible, and there's a corner being held down by rocks. To make things even more fun, there's a flash flood warning in effect until midnight. Bring it on.
A guy named Trash came in to the Shelter and remarked how ""The Shennies are strange"". I realized he was right. So far at least, Shenandoah National Park was weird. They erected concrete pillars as trail markers, there were no views anywhere except the ones you got when you crossed the roads, the shelters were called hits and were spaced, it would seem, with every intention of causing irritation. (Noone wants to hike 13 miles! Day hikers want to do 8s or 10s and thru hikers want to do 17s noone likes 13s!!).

Blackrock Hut to Hightop Hut
The Shennies are strange, it remains true. In the morning, everyone was gone when I woke up. The area around the shelter was covered in a thick, foggy mist. The water on the ground, remnants of last night's driving rain, wasn't going anywhere. 
It started to rain again as soon as I got camp packed up. I put on my rain jacket and disappeared into the wet fog.
This wasn't just your average, everyday fog. This was (....dramatic pause.....) advanced fog. I could only see the trail, the bushes, and the trees that were within 20 feet of me. The world materialized out if a blank expanse of white, and seemed to be repeating itself all day. From time to time a deer would appear out of the fog and stare at me with those frightened brown eyes then either go back to eating or silently scamper off across the soaking forest floor. Other then the deer, there was no sign of life anywhere. I walked for hours like this, my feet growing ever wetter.
I made full use of that little bottle of energy and happiness in my food bag. I didn't even bother diluting the Mio energy, I just took a shot whenever I needed a boost. Right back into my old habits. The stuff tasted foul when it wasn't diluted, but it got the job done.
Jill texted me and asked if I was going to Hightop Hut (what's this ""hut"" nonsense all about?) and I said I probably was. She said ""thank God, I need a friend"". I had no idea what that meant or what she needed, but if there's one thing I actually do take seriously, it's being there when someone needs me. Hightop was 21 miles, no matter, I would simply have to get there. 
I plunged on through the rain, through the unyielding fog, past rock outcropping that probably overlooked beautiful vistas, and past thousands of blackberries, still too green to eat by weeks. 
I stopped at a ""camp store"" next to a campground and bought two cheeseburgers and a milkshake. I sat under a porch with Churkey, who told me the story behind her name. She had been attacked by a ruffled grouse her first week on trail and had no idea what it was. She called it a turkey chicken, and the name was soon reduced to churkey, which became her name. 
I laughed and told her I'd been attacked by several grouse, they can be little bastards. I told her about one time when I was threatened by a blue grouse on the slopes of the Washburn Range. I decided to see what this little bird had in him and did my best to mimick the noises he was making, getting down on all fours and getting in the birds face. We had a long exchange between the two of us, he seemed a worthy foe, but soon our unflinching attitudes seemed to win one another's respect. He stopped hissing and drumming at me and I watched him milling about until a lady grouse stepped out in the meadow with us. He began doing backflips and singing out to the lady grouse, no doubt sharing his valiant tale of his battle with a human. I wished him luck as he chased the lady grouse out of the meadow.
Churkey looked at me like I was insane, then let out a huge laugh. That seems to be the normal reaction to any of my stories, maybe I am a bit crazy. Every word of them was true though, my life has always been stranger then fiction.
After lunch I got back on the trail and didn't see another person all day. Some deer scared the hell out of me but otherwise it was just me out there. 
For the last mile my foot started aching. I've always had a bit of a limp but my foot felt so sore it became a hobble. It was the foot that I had a bit of a toe knuckle removed, probably why it was hurting. 
I hobbled into camp soaking wet and thirsty as a soaking wet human could be (I was in no mood to filter water today. I set up then cooked in the dark. 
A moth flew into my headlamp. ""Be gone sir!"" I shouted and swatted. He kept flying at me. ""I will end you and your horrid rain of terror you scoundrel, go back to whatever hellhole spawned you you fool!"" I am always being plagued by something 
What Jill needed a friend for I never found out, probably she will tell me in the morning when we are both dry.","Blackrock Hut

Hightop Hut to Mile 924.8
I had the fullest hopes that this morning the fog and rain would be cleared. I was wrong.
It was drizzling, my shoes (and soon my socks) were still wet, and worst of all we still couldn't see a thing. I laughed at the Shennies for their feeble attempt to break my spirit, and strutted happily out into the swampy air, my limp exaggerated by the pains in my foot.
Jill and I stayed together all day and caught eachother up. Being out here with no real outside stimulation, we seem to have a keen interest in whatever happens to eachother when we split up. We all listen to eachothers stories and hang on every word.
Jill had a bit of a rough time. She stayed at a campground where some supposed ""trail angel"" had bought a few sights for hikers and was giving out food, but when she got there and after taking some food this guy got creepier and creepier with all the young women there. He made lots of comments that were way beyond okay and everyone went to bed together, hoping he would keep to himself. 
I said it was good I wasn't there, I probably would have gotten myself in trouble.
This trail Satan aside, Jill did make some nice new friends and have a good time.
There seem to be three kinds of people that do trail magic, the Jesus people, the creepy middle aged men who are desperate for attention, and the people who actually just genuinely want to help. Most people fit in that last group.
We hiked ten miles and then went to a camp store. I had cheerwine for the first time (if you like cherry colas, it is delicious). We formed a large group and had a fine discussion about regional sodas. I got really jacked up on caffine and turned goofy. I told some sweet old lady to make good choices when I left.
""Who was that?"" Jill asked.
""I have no idea,"" I answered.
A few weeks ago, Jill met some muggles who asked about her thru hike, and then said ""enjoy every step"". As soon as they said this Jill stunned her toe on a rock and stumbled face first down the mountain. Now, every time one of us stubs out toe and goes flying forward (10 to 20 times a day when we're sober) it's become a joke to say ""enjoy every step"". 
It's interesting that this website doesn't allow profanity. That makes it impossible to accurately portray any trail conversation. Maybe it's the lack of need for a customer service voice, maybe it's the comfort we hikers feel with one another, maybe it's that we're all just going feral (I can only hope) but we all talk like sailors now. Jill and I have always had total guttermouths, but it's rubbing off on everyone elsetoo. You rarely hear a sentence without at least three expletives. Often it's even other word. 
The entire day, we walked through more of that oppressive fog. Nothing was drying, I got new blisters and my feet became a wrinkled, shredded mess. 
Typical trail talk: "" I used to have a roommate who claimed a duck called him the n word"", "" you know I listened to this podcast recently about a woman who formed a sort of romantic attachment to a dolphin"", ""why do movie monsters only fight in densely populated urban areas? Imagine Godzilla vs Kong if it took place in a cornfield. Maybe in Nebraska, noone would die. Unless Sharknado came in too. Godzilla vs King Kong vs Sharknado"", "" here's the thing about feminism, sure it's true that women in the US have it a lot better then women in a lot of other places but that doesn't mean that we're done or that everything perfect, you wouldn't say someone who came in 4th won the race just because someone else came in 10th"" , ""Godzilla vs Kong vs Mr. Peanutbutter!"", ""No, I don't think it was ok for that lady to get romantically involved with that dolphin"" , ""I feel like if I had more body hair I would shave the AT logo into it for hike naked day"" , ""Batman vs Superman vs Godzilla vs Kong vs a guy named Larry the cable guy!"" , ""we don't joke about that here! There is nothing funny about Blue Collar Comedy tour!"" , ""gay marriage? I'm actually against straight marriage if you can beleive that"" , ""Godzilla vs the two party system!""
We got so wrapped up in our trail talk that we blew past the shelter where we planned on filling up our water, leaving us without enough to camp for the night. We would have to put in an extra five miles and stealth camp. 
Going over the top of Hazeltop the sky finally broke through, the clouds parted at last and lifted the seige of the fog. Beams of sunlight shined through the fog right at golden hour, turning the forest into a magical fairytale world. We were awestruck, our spirits never higher. At last the fog that made the Shennies so mysterious and gloomy was defeated. The air felt lighter. I could see out over the mountains again. I wondered if every view I passed was that beautiful. 
We saw deer after deer, including a few bucks. I set up camp and was about to go to sleep we I realized I still had jerky in my fanny pack. I ran it down to my food bag, 100 yards up trail, but I didn't bother putting any clothes back on. Hike naked day was coming up anyway, I needed practice. 
Moths, I've decided, are my mortal enemies. How does such an obnoxious creature still have a place on this planet? Never mind malarial mosquitos or black widow spiders or even those bloodsucking ticks, moths are the worst of the insects. Every night I turn on my headlamp and try to cook in peace and I am divebombed by the butterfly's evil brother, the Vader to butterflies' Luke. May they all come to a burning and unpleasant end. Just tonight I tried to make some Mac and cheese when I found about 20 of them chewing on the socks I laid out to dry. I sat and tried to cook but was slammed into by the 747 of the bug world. 
""Be gone sir!"" I shouted but was assaulted by these glowy eyed parasites. Moths are schoolbusses and I'm just Regina George trying to cross the street. ""I will end you and your entire family!!"" I scream, swatting in vein at them. ","Hightop Hut

Mile 924.8 to Little Stony Man Cliffs
I woke up this morning and prayed for sun. I Lai back and didn't open my eyes, for fear of what I might see. I listened, and as far as I could tell it didn't sound like rain. It didn't smell like rain. Could it be? Was I finally going to get a day in the Shennies without getting soaked?
I stuck my head out and found an overcast sky. Good enough for me. I let out an approving bark and a whistle and got ready for my day.
My socks and shoes were still sopping wet, so I decided to simply not wear them. There was a camp store in one Mile, I would get breakfast there and lay them out in the sun until they dried. I slipped on my camp shoes and headed out. 
I got a cup of coffee and more microwave cheeseburgers as the sun came out and at last dried my socks. I laid on a picnic table and drank in the day (and the coffee, oh how I've missed the taste of coffee these last two years, what a joy to be off the wagon). I finished an audiobook and started another.
I miss books. Audiobooks have become my friend out here, they weigh nothing and can still tell a story, but I miss being able to read the words myself and decode how the story plays out, the tone of the words. 
Since getting on trail I've ""read"" The Canterbury Tales, White Fang, Endurance, Under the Banner of Heaven, the Worst Journey in the World, Brave New World, Fahrenheit 451, and I just finished A Feast for Crows, the fourth book in A Song of Ice and Fire. 
I looked down and saw a tiny tick in between my knuckles, just recently attached, not quite buried yet. I reached in carefully and pulled it out and flung it away. Not today you miniscule Satan. Then I looked at my arm and found another, and another, and another. I pulled eight deer ticks off of me, then got paranoid and took off my shirt and checked all over for more. I've already had a terrible time with Lyme disease that I don't plan to repeat. 
With dry socks I left the camp store and got back on trail. I basked in the sunshine, practically skipped down the trail, and stopped at every overlook, so glad I could finally see things. Then the sun went away. 
Now, when I say the sun went away, I don't mean it got cloudy, I mean the sun seems to have taken its leave of the Earth. It got dark. Then a strong, howling wind slammed into me, string enough to knock me backward. Just yesterday I heard a tree fall in the forest (it did make a sound) and I thought about how dangerous this wind could be. Fog rolled back in too, a wall of it, with little fingers that reached out just ahead of the white nothingness. I threw down my pack and grabbed my rain jacket. Without a doubt this was the scariest looking storm I'd ever seen. As soon as the fog hit me, so did the rain. A sideways rain, instantly soaking. I took off my glasses, put my hood up, and hiked on. 
I thought about finding a rock overhang for shelter, but it was too late, I was already too wet, and it was cold. I would just have to keep pressing on. The trail was indistinguishable from a creek. Water past my ankle tumbled down through the rocks while lightning flashed overhead. My dry socks lasted about two hours, now there might be fish living in my shoes. 
In a rain like this, your rain gear fails, all you own gets wet, and anything not in your pack liner is useless. I sent home my packs rainfly, it was pointless, but if I could offer everyone one tip for thru hiking, pack liners would be it. Don't settle for some trashbag either, ball out and get the official one, you'll thank me later. 
I survived the storm and made it to Skyland Resort, where I heard thru hikers were overtaking the restaurant and getting out of the rain. I ate with a group who seemed beaten by the Shennies. These are the times when one has to be just plain stubborn to be out here. Hikers discussed getting a room for the night, but they had no laundry and I didn't see much point in all of us splitting a $160 room and packing in uncomfortably when we could all stay for free and be comfortable outside.
Jill and I, being parkies, got an idea. National Parks are generally run by people who live on location, employee dorms are usually tucked away behind Park hotels. Some even have community shower rooms (I always take a shower in the employee dorms when I visit Zion). Most importantly, laundry is always free. We walked around back and found an ""employees only"" sign and went by it and found the dorms. Parks have a high turnover rate so noone ever notices strangers in the housing areas. We walked in like we owned the place and found exactly what we were looking for, employee laundry. 
We went inside and tossed our socks in the dryer, then checked over our shoulders, hoped noone else was coming in, and threw the rest of our clothes in. We covered up with our rain jackets to lessen our chances of ending up on a sex offender registry and sat on top of the dryers. A half hour later, we redressed in warm and dry clothing, we smuggled a laundry room.
We hiked on and came to Little Stony Man Cliffs. There was a stealth site there, and the rain filled up a spot in the rocks with fresh water. We decided to camp there. Truncle came down the trail and joined us. Truncle is a man I can get behind, he hikes with four watches on his arm, all set to different times. I highly respect that. 
We all cooked and gazed out over the valley. It was threatening to rain, fog overlayed the distant mountains and the farms down below us. Slowly, the fog grew and expanded and soon swallowed us up, throwing us back into that white void. The wind picked up to and it drizzled a bit. I said I was going to bed and unzipped my hammock but before I could crawl in I heard Truncle yelling ""Dude! Get back out here!"" 
I ran back and saw that the sun was shining through again, burning a hole in the fog and revealing the world again, except now we were in the midst of the most intense sunset I had ever seen, and the remaining for scattered the colors all around us. More and more fog burned away, revealing all the cliffs and mountains again but now draped in this majestic red and orange. All three of us stood at the edge of the cliff, braving the wind and light rain for what we all soon agreed was the single most beautiful sunset we'd ever seen. 
That was worth four days of fog and wet shoes and rain. I could die happy after witnessing something like that. Of every other view on this trail is blocked by fog, this alone makes it a success. Just when it seemed like the Shennies truly were starting to hate us, they showed us just what we were here to see. I've decided to not flip off the Shenandoah National Park sign when I leave after all.
Truncle's tent collapsed in the wind and I helped him find his stakes and set it back up, I hope it makes it through the night for him, the wind is intense (in tents, haha) up here.","Mile 924.8

Little Stony Man Cliffs to Mile 950.3
The night was, I'd have to admit, a bit restless with all that wind. I slept in a bit to make up some sleep. 
I was glad to see that Trunkles tent made it through the night and he was still alive and able to tell us the time in eight different parts of the world (I pointed out to him that, since his watches made no distinction between AM and PM, he can really claim two time zones per watch). 
The only major development on trail today was that it did not rain while we were hiking for the first time since entering the Shennies. Dry socks prevailed, the sun shined brightly, and I can start healing up these blisters I got from days of wet shoes.
I have lots of rashes and what looks like a fungus growing in several spots on my body. I heard a story from Starburst (remember Starburst? The pizza guy?? We love Starburst around here) that someone hiked a few years back and went to a doctor and tested positive for 74 different parasites. Now most trail anecdotes should be taken with enough salt to cure a ham, but it does say something that these are the stories we hear. We're all pretty likely to pick something up. 
Elkwallow Wayside is the only wayside grill that is currently open and serving the famous blackberry shake. I said as soon as I got here I was getting a blackberry shake if I had to camp outside the store. There hours were 11 to 5, so we decided that rather then wait until 11 tomorrow, we would just hitch there today, get a milkshake, then hitch back to where we got off and hike on, ending our day close to the wayside and simply passing it by in the morning. 
Some nice people from Chicago gave us a ride there, I got my milkshake (oh my goodness for the love of all that is good in this world get this milkshake it's amazing I don't care what anyone says I love milkshakes) and it was pretty good (MILKSHAKES BABY, YESSS) although a bit pricey (did you just order a $5 shake?). The company was also fantastic, the yard was full of our fellow dirtbags. I smuggled a new roll of toilet paper from the bathrooms and then hit the road.
We got a ride in the bed of a pickup truck back to the Gap. I want to take a moment to say that if you own a pickup truck you have no excuse not to pickup your local hitchhikers. We'll climb in the bed and you won't even know we are there, and we will thank you for it. Riding in the bed of a pickup is the most free feeling on this planet, letting the the air flow through your hair and seeing the world flash by you without a plate of glass in your way, now that's paradise to me. Also, if you are the sort of person who picks up hitchhikers, just know that you are loved and respected by me and by travelers, hiker trash, dortbags, and dumpster kids everywhere. You are a hero.
We hiked on and spot camped just past mile 950. A deer came into our camp and walked right up to us, smelled the air, and ran off. Then it came back from another angle, gave us a look, then hopped off, just to come back from another side and do the same. This deer spent the entire evening circling around camp and checking us out. It seemed shy but heenly interested in us and our behavior. It even followed us out to watch us hang our bear bags. Even after we went to bed, it stared at Jill's tent and my hammock until I lost interest in it. It's probably standing outside right now as I lay in here righting (it is, I just looked). 
I pulled another five or six ticks off me again. Jill and I scanned eachother but couldn't find any more. I set all the ticks I found on a log and lit them all on fore with my lighter. We watched the fireflies for a bit then called it a happy day and climbed in, just as a thunderstorm was rolling in. 
""What a night, fireflies, ticks and deer,"" Jill said.
""And deer ticks,"" I added, ""deer ticks that are on fire"".","Little Stony Man Cliffs

Mile 950.3 to Tom Floyd Wayside Shelter
In last night's torrential downpour I overlooked a very important detail, the placement of my shoes. I got up in the sunshine and dumped water out of my shoes. They could've supported a small trout. Why does this happen?
So, with soaking feet, yet again, I hit the trail. Oddly enough, I got back to Elkwallow Wayside at exactly 11, when the grill opens. Hitching here yesterday was completely unnecessary it turns out. I should ignore the grill and keep walking. I should not buy another milkshake and cheeseburger. But oh what providence that I should get here exactly when it opens. I'm weak, let's be honest. There's no chance I'm walking past a cheeseburger or a milkshake.
After that it was mostly a long and uneventful day. I made it across what was probably the fattest stretch on the trail, past more friendly deer, and put in 19 miles.
I got to the northern border of the Shennies and left the park. There's been some blood, less sweat then usual, and quite a few tears shed this week in Shenandoah. The Shennies are strange, that's really all that can be said. It's a relief to get back to the ""normal"" part of the trail for one thing, at the same time I'll miss the park.
A week of rain and thick fog, wet shoes and friendly deer. A week of running across Skyline Drive and hoping a car doesn't materialize out of the mist and end my hike with a shattering blow. A week of those weird trail markers that look like a gravestone had a baby with a smokers pole (seriously knock down these things Shenandoah, noone likes them, put up some real signs I don't need five feet of concrete with an unreadable band on it, make a normal trail sign!). A week of ticks and the shelters being called huts for no real reason, and one incredible sunset that made it all worth it. I love you Shenandoah, for that one sunset if nothing else. You shall be missed, and loathed. 
Now the end of Virginia lies in reach. The Rollercoaster is the last obstacle and I will have overcome the ATs longest state. It's felt like forever since I crossed a state line, I'm coming Harper's Ferry.","Mile 950.3

Tom Floyd Shelter to Mile 979.9
The three miles to Front Royal were a breeze. Downhill, but not so downhill to be a bother. The woods were different, no longer that thick jungley vegetation like in the Shennies but rather a wide open sort. 
We found trail magic near the road, a cooler full of ice and coca cola. At the road crossing, we were offered a ride right away by a lady who was dropping off her husband on the trail. I sat in the back with her young daughter and a sleeping baby. 
She drove an Xterra, which was my first car. It felt good to be sitting in one again. I put over 100,000 miles on mine, drove it up into the highest mountain roads and down into the sketchiest desert tracks in the canyons. I laughed, cried, started and ended most of my relationships, saw a lot of beautiful things in that car, and all the whole it never gave me the slightest issue. Never an engine light or a low oil pressure or even a flat tire. I did lose a wheel once out in the desert but that was probably the doing of some crackhead stealing my lug nuts. Ultimately, it turned out that the Xterra's only weakness was box trucks, specifically getting backed over by them. I remember pulling over and crying like a baby after getting all my things out when it was declared totaled. But that was back when I drove places. Now I only had to worry about walking. 
I told the nice lady all of this as she drove Jill and I to town, she said her Xterra was holding up just as well as mine. Jill mentioned that she sold her car to hike the trail, and I made my usual joke about the irony of selling a car to be able to afford to walk. 
Our driver drove us right into town, and even insisted on taking us directly to ""Basecamp"". Basecamp is a beautiful concept. Four businesses combined their resources and built and maintained a secret room in the building they all share. All a thru hiker has to do is get in touch with one of the owners of one of these businesses and they will be shown the way. We found the owner of the outfitter enjoying a cup of coffee with the owner of the bakery and they took us in and showed us the secret room. 
Four storage lockers, a washer, a dryer, a bathroom, a shower, town clothes, a free box, several outlets, and a huge chalk board. All free to hikers and built, cleaned and paid for by the surrounding businesses. It was beautiful. 
I took a shower, got rid of my trash, resupplied as much as I could out of the free box, and took to the chalkboard. I wrote my name and drew a quick lookalike of my tattoo (I have a tattoo on my forearm of a stick figure cowboy riding a bison getting abducted by aliens in front of a mountain. All this is happening inside a triangle except that the aliens ship is breaking out of the triangle. I now use this as my symbol for everything, it's painted on my backpack and I've been doing my best to recreate it for my signatures. Alas, I'm terrible at drawing). With that completed, I saw another section of the board that was reserved for messages for missed connections and lost lovers. I took another piece of chalk and wrote ""to all those behind me, know I loved you dearly, to all those ahead, let me apologize in advance."" 
I looked at that like it was the most profound thing I'd ever written and decided to head out to the bakery to think about it. There was a kind young lady behind the counter who told me she just pulled some cinnamon rolls out of the oven if I wanted a hot one. My heart melted at the offer so I bought a cinnamon roll and a cup of coffee. Praise the sun I've missed coffee.
Jill has been performing some amateur psychology on me (and reminding me constantly that she is not qualified for this and everything she says should be ignored). We hit the subject of my past relationships the other night. ""They all sound crazy to me"", she said, ""all your female friends are crazy too, and your dude friends, at least ones I know, but especially your ex girlfriends."" 
""They're not all crazy, and you're dating one of my dude friends!"" I protested.
""Yes but that's another point, the point is why do you have so many crazy people around you?""
I entertained a few ideas. ""It could be because im attracted to crazy people, or it could be that crazy people are attracted to me, or it could be that you'd have to be crazy to want to be with me, or maybe just that people become crazy when they're around me. Maybe I'm the one that's crazy?""
""Of course you're crazy, everyone knows that!""
Who could argue with that logic, I'd be crazy to even try.
I gave a giggle into my coffee cup. I just wrote an apology to all my future friends and lovers on a chalkboard in a secret room in a brewery, bakery, and outfitter.
Jill came out from her shower and we decided to eat lunch at the brewery (we were hitting all the businesses that maintained Basecamp). 
I got a flight and a cheesesteak. Jill was feeling anxious all day, I could tell. She was trying to get to DC from Harper's Ferry to see some friends, and it was proving far more difficult then she anticipated. She searched through her phone for a solution while I talked with the bartender Dan. I liked Dan. 
There were license plates on the wall and one had a patriot from the revolution playing a flute on it, that led to a whole talk with Dan about US history and about how British people are generally so unamused when you bring up the war with them. Dan left to refill someone else's beer and Jill began to fret over her options and whether she should even go to DC.
""I need to just make a decision here!"" She scolded herself 
""Just chill out and see what happens,"" I said. A lot of her options for going or not going were up to chance at this point. ""Of course that's just my advice and you know how bad I am at making decisions"", I took a sip out of one of the beers in my flight.
""You think you're bad at making decisions?"" she asked.
""Why do you think I'm having four beers?"" I laughed.
She set her phone down. I looked above the bar and noticed and empty rectangular glass case mounted in the wall, empty.
""What do you think was in there? Maybe a small sword? Or a big fish!? Or a really small swordfish!"" I yelled.
""I wish I had your level of curiosity and delight about everything around me,"" Jill said. 
We resupplied and hitched back out of town in the bed of a pickup truck. 
I found more black raspberries on trail, then more honeysuckle. Most if the honeysuckles were duds, but the raspberries were ripe and as fresh as they could be. I passed hundreds more blackberries as well that needed a few more weeks. 
Jill fell behind while she talked on the phone with Creech (another perk of town days is phone service on trail) and while she was out of sight I ran into another bear (if anyone's counting, that's thirteen so far and I'm not even halfway done yet). The bear stopped and stared at me, then turned and ran.
We hiked on and ate more raspberries. At a road crossing,, we found a machete buried in a trail sign..
""That's terrifying!"" Jill said.
""Nah, it's not so bad.. what's really scary is when the killer still has the machete.""
We settled down in camp and ate dinner. Tonight we didn't talk about me or my ex girlfriends or psychology but about Morgan. Morgan is currently visiting her family in Ashville, leaving Jill and I alone. The group dynamic has been pretty solid, but in all honesty a change in lineup is probably doing everyone a world of good. Jill told me that Morgan was very upset about the incident the other day after the brewery, I told her that I was as well. Ultimately we both determined that I shouldn't be throwing rocks ( although in my defense it was really more like tossing pebbles) and they shouldn't be trying to bother me like that. Communication has always been easy between Jill and I, but if Morgan brings this up I feel like there's a potential for it to not go quite as well. I hope it does though. I love the both of them and hiking with them has been one of the things that keeps this thru going, our little trail family will endure, I am confident. 
Something is making a ton of noise in the woods. Jill and I keep alternating yelling at it in the dark. I hope it goes away and if not I hope it's something harmless, seeing a bear and a machete is a little worrying.","Tom Floyd Wayside Shelter

Mile 979.9 to Rod Hollow Shelter 
Hiking out today something seemed different. The woods rang out in some loud ominous clatter. It sounded like thousands of angry rattlesnakes in the trees. 
""Could it be?"" I wondered. Then saw that it definently was as a giant oversized insect flew past me. We were at last in the realm of the cicadas. 
This being a cicada year sets everyone's thru hike apart from those done on any other year. For seventeen years these massive bugs have been living underground and waiting for the day that it would at last be there turn. Now they emerge and overtake the landscape, raising the decibel count to an obnoxious level and being absolutely massacred by every possible forest dweller. For six weeks they follow a peculiar life pattern that I call SFD, which of course stands for Scream, Reproduce, Die. 
Cicadas have no idea how to live up here, they've spent there entire seventeen year lives underground. Now faces with the prospect of universal ground life they are eaten by birds and snakes and people, run over by vehicles, crushed by foot and hoof, flying into fans and a thousand other things. They desperately seek out mates until they're satisfied their purpose is fulfilled and the the next brood is set to come out in seventeen years, then they all drop dead. 
We have the pleasure of hiking with these screaming insects this year and enjoy the sounds of their colossal orgy. 
I can hear it through my headphones, not even music is enough to drown it out. 
I spent the day picking black raspberries and got to the shelter early. I ate dinner with Truck Stop, so named because last year he meant to thru hike but was run over by a box truck, shattering bones and dislocating his hip. He was on a cane as recently as March, and his doctor told him there was no way he would be able to do the trail. He's almost one thousand miles in and noticeably not on a cane. The worst part is his hip, however. He was taught how to put it back in place himself, and he confessed it has become dislocated on trail already. Knowing how much shoulder dislocations hurt, I can't imagine an entire hip.
Feeling lazy, I set my hammock up inside the shelter. Sleep well everybody, tomorrow we cross the thousand mile mark and set foot in another state for the first time in over 500 miles.","Mile 979.9

Major milestones today. We left the shelter together and crossed almost instantly into The Roller-coaster. 
The Roller-coaster is the final obstacle in Virginia, standing sentry at the northern tip of the AT's longest state. It is 14 miles of steep and constant ups and downs with rocky, uneven, poorly maintained, and abysmally viewless. 
That's a bit of an exaggeration, it's not really that bad, it would be an average day in North Carolina, but it does wear you down a bit.
A few miles past the coasters entrance, we found another sign, this one labeled ""Springer GA, 1,000 M""
1,000 miles. We litterally just walked 1,000 miles. I looked at the sign, wordlessly, and nodded to Jill. We savored the moment for a second,, then she asked, ""how do you feel about that?""
""Hungry,"" was all I could say.
1,000 miles and we weren't quite halfway done yet. 1,000 more to go, plus another 200 roughly. Still, I have to admit, it's a good feeling to know I've come 1,000 miles. All I have to do is do it again, and I'm practically there.
Moving on, we started pressing for the state line. The constant up and down made the going extra slow, and tiring.
We stopped and jumped into a creek to bathe and cool off, it was oppressively hot today as well. After that I ate all of my food, excluding a mountain house meal I packed for supper and a tuna packet for breakfast. Not enough for tomorrow. I'd survive, but I wouldn't be happy about it.
We hit a road crossing that felt like a game of Frogger, dodging cars and hoping for the best. Next we started a climb and met some dayhikers.
A particularly exasperated looking lady came down the hill, sweating and panting, and asked how far it was to the parking lot. We told her she had less then a quarter mile and she said ""oh thank God, it's been a LONG hike.""
With that statement, and especially her emphasis on ""long"", gears started turning in my head. Machinery that laid format for over a decade began to move, breaking the cobwebs away and creaking back to life. Steam started rising and pouring out my ears. I became a stuttering mess, cross-eyed and foaming at the mouth. ""We just crossed a thousand miles!"" I yelled out to her.
She looked frightened, said congratulations, and moved on. Jill looked at me with the same cross-eyed, perplexing look and we both laughed. Laughing at day hikers gets easier by the day.
We actually missed the sign for the new state. I pulled up guthooks and beheld, we were no longer in Virginia. We had traded it out for the new and mysterious land of...... West Virginia.
It is quite ironic that the ATs longest state flows directly into its shortest state. The trail rides the border for about fourteen miles before dropping into the state just long enough to pass through Harper's Ferry then you're in Maryland. 
We found the end of the roller-coaster and we're exhausted and glad to be off that ride. The two of us pressed on after dark to Blackburn Center. The ""Center"" is really a cabin in the woods the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club has purchased and rents out to people, but next to it is a hiker cabin that anyone can stay in. 
Though we planned to camp, the cabin was empty so Jill took a bunk and I set up my hammock on the flimsy rafters, scooting a table under me and putting my backpack on it for cushioning in case the rafters failed me. 
We went through our daily routines, brushed our teeth, checked eachother for ticks, burned the ones we did find, and crawled into bed. ","Rod Hollow Shelter

Blackburn Center to Harper's Ferry 
I made it a point to check out the center before I left for the day. There was the little one room cabin with four beds and a porch that we stayed in, a big house that can be rented out, and a solar shower down below. The big house had a wrap around porch and a spigot with potable water, we filled up.
The going was fairly easy today. I ate my last bit of food for breakfast but the trail provides. The entire ridge was lined with black raspberries and I gorged myself on hundreds of them. My hands stained purple, I was more then satisfied. Reminiscing while I was sitting on my backpack eating handfuls of berries, I remember being a kid and going up to our cabin in Northern PA every fourth of July and picking black raspberries. We would spend the week eating them on cakes or making them into pies or whatever else. These berries bring back a lot of good memories for me. I also remembered a time in Hawaii when after a hard day's work on a farm, me and my friend Dig Dug were turned loose on a rambutan orchard and told to eat as many as we could and I ate so many of those fuzzy red fruits I threw up. I need to work on pacing myself when it comes to fresh fruit.
Then, just to make things that much better, I found out about a store just down the road near the trail and walked down for some chicken tenders and a milkshake.
In the midst of some oppressive heat, I walked the ridge until I came to the final border crossing. Here, the trail officially leaves Virginia and does not reenter. On one hand, the forever state is now over, and all future states will be conquered a few weeks at a time. On the other hand, Virginia was a pleasure at times. The Grayson Highlands, McAfee Knob, Little Stony Man Cliffs, all beautiful beyond words. There was those long flat days as well as those insane climbs. I reminded myself that state lines are purely arbitrary and hiked on down to the Shenandoah River.
We crossed a tremendous bridge over a huge river, dipped back into the woods for a bit, then found the blue blazes to the ATC HQ.
The Appalachian Trail Conservancy Headquarters (that's the only time I'm spelling that out) is here and it's where we all get our pictures taken and receive our hang tags. They must figure that anyone who makes it this far is really going for it, so it's past time to properly register then. 
The guy at the HQ gave a little talk about leaving no trace, and asked what we were doing about it.
""Digging holes and destroying every rock pile I find"", I told him. 
That satisfied him and I got my tag, it's purple.
Jill was getting a ride to DC for the next two days so we got some food and waited for her friends to grab her. 
After that I wandered aimlessly for a bit. I meant to sleep under another bridge but ultimately I was directed to a hostel. The hostel was a few miles up the trail, meaning it was in Maryland. 
I crossed back onto the trail and headed northbound. 
The trail here crosses through Harper's Ferry National Historic Park, an old town mostly noted as the furthest point north in the confederacy and as the site of John Brown's raid. Brown, a prominent abolitionist, led a group of 22 men in capturing the towns armory, hoping to invite a slave rebellion across the south. The slaves didn't revolt and Brown was later captured, tried, and executed for murder and treason. Before his death, however, he did manage to make a speech on the fly said to be so moving it stirred the hearts of every man woman and child in the nation. Some even say that Brown's speech was what made the abolition of slavery no longer a fringe view in the north (though it is my opinion that anyone who can't see that slavery is, as the kids say, ""bad"" and should be ""illegal"", and is an absolute injustice to the very nature of human kind should taken into the streets and assaulted with a jackhammer).
The historic town was beautiful, I passed Jefferson Rock, which was held up by sandstone because someone was afraid it would roll down and land atop some unfortunate bystander. Next came the old churches (I love old churches more then any non-Christian probably should) and the rest of town, then finally what the locals call ""The Point"". This is the spot where the Potomac meets the Shenandoah, two massive rivers combining into one. I crossed the bridge as the sky was turning golden and crossed over into Maryland, barely having time to register West Virginia.
I hiked on a few miles then saw what looked like a massacre of blueberries below me. I looked up and saw a mulberry tree full of ripe fruit. I shook the tree and gathered up all the berries that fell. The trail provides, it is true. Mulberries are delicious, if only they would grow somewhere you can reach them. I'm sure I missed dozens of berries that fell and mixed in with the crushed berries on the ground.
The path up to the hostel was the hardest part of the day. They even ahead a rope in place to use. I stayed up, had a shower, then retreated to my hammock. Tomorrow I'm taking my first zero in three weeks. A much deserved zero, I'm tired and my foot is in serious pain. I'm walking with an even greater limp than usual. I'm not sure if it's my shoe or just my foot. 
Either way, I'm chilling ","Blackburn Center

Zero at Cross Trail Hostel
Today my soul ambition was to do as little as possible. I stayed in my hammock as long as I could until nature intervened, then I realized the house was air conditioned and had a couch that was far superior to the hammock. I laid on the couch, ordered another set of shoes (you've done well pair 2, but it looks like this is going to be a four shoe hike and not a three) and enjoyed the lack of motion.
I did walk .2 miles down the road to the liquor store for a soda and a small bottle of Jack. I made friends with the clerk and hung out with him for a while, talking with him and some of the customers. 
I spent most of my day at the hostel drinking whiskey mixed with Dr. Pepper. I found a guitar at some point and strummed it a bit, though I must admit I'm getting noticeably worse at it. Maybe this winter I'll put in some practice and finally start my folk punk band.
The guy who runs the hostel, Peak Freak, offered to drive us out to a food truck so three of us piled into the bed of his pickup and went a few miles down the highway. I've started waving at everyone I see when I'm in the bed of a pickup. They always wave back, they all look so happy to be acknowledged. Wave to the masses, they all deserve it.
We stopped at a hotel in town and helped Peak Freak smuggle out a cooler full of ice out an unlocked back door. When we got to the food truck there was a trampoline which Riptide, Life Alert, and I jumped on until our food was ready. I had Panang Curry with white rice and a Thai iced tea.
It's Father's Day so I called Pap then Dad and told them all about my day of jumping on strangers children's trampolines, stealing ice from chain hotels, and hanging out at liquor store counters, all things that make parents and grandparents proud.

Harpers Ferry to Ed Garvey Shelter 
Today is a very special day that lives in the hearts of hikers and nudists everywhere. It's the summer solstice, and on the Appalachian Trail, that's hike naked day.
This particular holiday is not official or recognized by any governing body anywhere, which makes it even more fun because you get to break the law. 
I packed up at the hostel and heard some other hikers saying they were going for it, a few others saying they wouldn't. L took my Jack Daniel's and stuffed it in my food bag, it was light enough, why not. 
The first few miles were still on the canal towpath and I would probably get arrested if I celebrated there,so I hiked with clothes on. On my right was the mighty Potomac, flowing out toward the Atlantic, on my left was a swamp with a layer of thick green algae on top. Turtles broke through, covered in the algae themselves. I picked more mulberries and went swimming under a bridge..
I kept my clothes on until I got back up on the mountain and past the first viewpoint, eliminating the theeat of day hikers (mostly). I pulled off to undress and the group from the hostel passed me, not a speck of clothing on any of them. They told me they had run into a ridgerumner who was extremely upset about their nakedness.
""I'm gonna have to ask you to put your clothes on,"" she said in a snarky tone to Compass.
Compass smiled and waited. 
""Will you put some clothes on?"" The ridgerunner pleaded.
""Nope,"" he answered and kept walking.
Same thing happened with Mowgli, Zen, and finally when Not So Bad got there she yelled ""Come on guys this is indecent exposure!!"" 
She was promptly ignored. Other then that, they were just being cheered on by day hikers. 
I figured this was a perfect opportunity for me because if I stayed just behind them they would draw all the heat, and I could throw my hilt back on if needs be. 
Not So Bad in particular loved naked hiking, she says it's legal in Vermont and she wants to do the whole state naked (is that true, ehhh I'm not a lawyer, who knows). 
I hung a shirt from the side of my fanny pack in case I ran into a family with small children or something, but I never saw anyone except one old guy who just laughed, doubtlessly already passing the other naked hikers.
I hiked up the trail and enjoyed the breeze, until it grew dark and stormy. Thunder started booming and rain drops started falling. 
I ducked into the shelter and found the whole naked group, now with clothes on. 
The Smoking Bubble they called themselves. They are all working together to perfect the art of lentils and trail curry. I have been wanting to bring lentils into my diet so I took some tips.
We all discussed trail safety and the merits of naked hiking. I've always been somewhat of a nudist so I love the concept. It's freeing and the air feels great. We all talked down on the trail runner who tried to ruin their day with her ""indecent exposure laws"" as if they exist. I find it hilarious how afraid people are of their own bodies and of other people's. It's completely absurd when you think about it. 
We discussed more trail safety, until we all felt so safe we could hardly move. The Smoking bubble have a great sense of humor and just a great group dynamic, I hope I see them more. Moglie has packed out a guitar and played us songs by the fire after the rain stopped. Zen, who lives up to his name but retains this odd zenned out humor,.... what did Zen do again? I forget what I was going to say. We discussed a lot of trail safety. 
Setting up was a nightmare. This shelter is basically hammock proof, it's entirely too well constructed. It needs a few years for some boards to separate so I can get my straps around them.
I set up on the backside but it was pouring rain and nisty droplets were blowing in. I set up my tarp without staking it just to use as a sheild. 
Anyway, I set up on the back porch of the shelter, Naked Hiling day was a resounding success, and fight the power and take your clothes off, you all deserve it.
Jill was supposed to join me today but her train was delayed and she got into Harper's late. She's at the Hostel. Too bad for her.","Harpers Ferry

Ed Garvey Shelter to Dahlgren Camp
Somehow, it was freezing this morning. After the two hottest days on trail we are back to shivering in the rain. I don't get it either, maybe all the naked hiking upset the sky God or some other nonsense.
Also, for the first time, maybe ever, I wasn't the last one out of camp today. To my great surprise, I rolled out of bed at about the same time as the Smokey Bubble. Maybe these really are my people. 
I got my hammock tore down and out away in between bouts of rain, and ate a protein bar for breakfast. My food bag is alarmingly empty. I wondered briefly what I was going to do, and decided hike anyway was the only viable answer. I was hungry then, I was hungry after supper last night. I could eat everything that was left in my food bag and I'd still be hungry. That was going to have to be that. 
I don't regret sending home my rain pants, but they would have been nice today. The driving rain soaked my kilt and shoes (ahhh the wet shoes again) and the cold made it extra unpleasant. I hiked a few hours until I got to some old building and tried to go inside to escape the rain. 
The door was held shut by a chain and a padlock. A nearby sign read ""Gaths empty tomb"". Apparently this guy Gath built himself a whole mausoleum and then never bothered to die. He went so long without bothering to due that when he finally did his body was buried somewhere else. But even in death, I'm not allowed in the man's tomb. 
I walked on and found a few bathrooms and hid out in them for a while, then found a pavillion and hid under that. I was still hungry. I wondered if I could get a pizza delivered, there was a road crossing right next to the pavillion. 
While discussing trail safety with the Smokey Bubble, I called first Domino's, then Papa John's, and was swiftly told no by both. Another shop had the option to order online and I figured if I didn't ask they couldn't say no, so I ordered a medium pizza, got out my quilt and jacket, and waited out the rain. 
The Bubble moved on, my pizza came and I ate the whole thing, and then Forward came. Forward had hitched a ride in a Tesla the other day and Ludacris mode had awakened her vertigo, forcing her to take a zero in Harper's with a bad case of the spins. 
Booty Shorts, Riptide, Jiffy, and Jill showed up as well, and then a guy named Brick gave us cheeseburgers and coca cola. The phrase trail magic makes more and more sense the more I see it. It feels magical that so many people would be so willing to just hand out food to us just because they know we're hungry. Thru hiking is a great way to be reminded that humans really are a mostly good force in the world. It reconfirms my unshakeable faith in the human race.
We all pressed on together, stopping (as usual) at every raspberry bush along the way. We got in to Dahlgren Camp, a free campground for thru hikers with running water and showers, run by the state of Maryland. 
There we met back up with Washer (who was still wearing his tie), Pocket Snacks, Rock, and Roots.
We found out that the same pizza place would also deliver here, and decided why not. We went up to a nearby parking lot and waited for food, and I found a campers cell phone up there and brought it back to him. He tried to give me kindling as a thank you, but I wasn't lighting a fire. 
I ate everything I ordered, a good bit of what everyone else ordered, plus I made teriyaki rice. My food bag is empty, bit somehow I managed to eat more then ever today.","Ed Garvey Shelter

Dahlgren Camp to Ensign Cowall Shelter 
It was another cold day, but no rain this time. The result was extremely pleasant. We left camp and hiked two miles up to the original Washington Monument.
On the way up we passed signs with highlights of good old George's life, (notably leaving out the slavery, chopping down the cherry tree (which probably never happened) losing his teeth, or all those vampires he killed with Lincoln). We noted the lack of cherry trees in the area and decided that Washington obviously hates cherry trees and wouldn't have any located near his monument. 
The original Washington Monument resembles him about as well as the current one. It is a large tower of mortared stone with a staircase leading to the top. From the top you can see Antietam Battlefield, as well as Pennsylvania. We should hit Pennsylvania tomorrow. I'm almost home. 
From there we had miles of flat walking to enjoy. We all talked about our lives before the trail. Booty Shorts did the graphics for the show ""The View"" which I have never seen but I hear it upsets a lot of people. Booty Shorts says he doesn't want to be associated with anything political and therefore doesn't showcase that too much. He also doesn't want to do it forever, and is looking to expand artistically. 
Jiffy worked for a clothing company, and Forward works for REI. I told them all about Yellowstone, they had a million questions. 
We passed Annapolis Rocks, which just two weeks ago was closed due to a murder/suicide of a father and his young son. There's not much else to say about that.
Near the shelter, Booty told us a story about a guy he saw get his food bag stuck in a tree. He taped several trekking poles together and taped a knife at the end and attempted to saw the rope that held the bag. A half hour and a few stab wounds to the bag later, another idea came to mind. He taped a stove onto the poles and burnt the rope, retrieving his bag. 
We pulled in to the shelter and Dad drive down after work to camp with us (I'm that close to home now). He brought his new hammock that he sewed and I decided to try it out for the night. I'm laying in it now, and it's as comfy as it gets.
Let me end this with a rant about bear poles. For those of you who have never had to play keep away with a giant angry killer racoon, a bear pole is one of the approved food storage methods out here. It is by far the most despised method of storage on Earth. Metal hooks bend out like a chandelier while a forked metal pole which weighs five times more then it needs to is chained to the pole and used to hang the bags. This obnoxiously heavy pole is made worse by putting your food bag on it and then you have to try and loop the bag over the hooks. It's dangerous, difficult, and just unnecessary. Not to mention ineffective, it barely even gets them off the ground, most nights I can reach up and touch peoples bear bags. Cables would be much easier, or better yet bear boxes. End these accursed bear poles! Whoevers idea they were should be removed from the country and never allowed to return. Everyone hates them, I've never met anyone who said they liked them. Death to all bear poles!","Dahlgren Camp

""O, Pennsyltucky, your three mile islands, your coal fires buckle the miner's highways,
I'd love just to leave you, 
but it's good to see you.""
For those of you who've never slept under a bridge or gotten a stick and poke tattoo, those are the lyrics to ""O, Pennsyltucky"" by the Philadelphia folk punk band Mischeif Brew (a personal favorite of mine) and they perfectly sum up my feelings about my home state. 
I've spent most of my adult life doing everything I can to not be in Pennsylvania, I could never live here again, nor do I ever plan to. But I must admit, I feel a very strong sense of joy and relief when I cross the border and hit those first potholes of the turnpike, or those first road work signs from the south, or those first speed traps along 81. It's my home, it's shaped who I am, it's where I was born, went to school, found out that hiking and skiing were my two greatest loves, and above all else discovered a passion for travel which instilled an even greater passion for not being in this state. And today, I crossed the border and found myself home again. 
Maryland, despite being what I would say is the easiest state on trail (even easier then West Virginia) did throw a little challenge at us before it would let us leave. The trail went up and down a few steep hills with switchbacks carved in the sides. At a stream crossing a met a lady who invited us to stay in her yard. She saw my kilt and proudly proclaimed that she plays the bagpipes and has quite a few kilts in her house. Then, as she pounded down a cigarette, she said there was a nudist resort in her town that you could get a day pass to. 
Jill, after we left, turned to me and said, ""are you actually staying at that lady's house?""
""The crazy lady with the bagpipes and the cigarettes that proudly proclaimed about a nudist resort and said we can discuss trail safety with her in her house? Absolutely! That's a dream come true for me!""
She lives at the north end of PA, I got her number.
I got into Pen-Mar Park near the border and saw a sign that pointed the distance to Springer and the distance to Katahdin. It was over 100 miles short in both directions. 
The whole crew was there. The Smokey Bubble, Rock n' Roots, The Booty Clan, Washer and Pocket Snacks, and ourselves. We decided we need a collective name for our little trail family now that The Groundhog Group has unfortunately dispersed. I hope a name comes to us.
A lady came by and I struck up a conversation with her golden retrievers. Then she started talking to me with the same fascination.
""You're doing the whole trail! I've never heard of that! Now, of course you've got a gun right?""
""No not at all""
""What!?"" She was flabbergasted. ""How could you not have a gun! I just had mine out here at the park the other day!""
""Why?"" I asked, confused and above all curious. I hate to judge but it was pretty obvious already that this woman was highly unintelligent. I own several guns myself, but dumb and incompetent people with guns is something that I find terrifying. 
""Well I was out walking the dogs and I heard a snort in the woods!"" 
""It was probably a deer""
""No, no, it was a snort! I'm sure it was a bear!"" 
(Don't be an jerk Smuggler, it does no good to be a jerk) ""Well first of all bears don't snort, I'll almost guarantee you it's a deer. Secondly black bears are mortified of people and your odds of getting attacked by one are miniscule""
""Even with the dogs though?""
""Especially with the dogs, bears are terrified of dogs, my dog chases after them all the time. Now if anything you're putting yourself in more danger by having a gun then not having one, especially if you're pulling it at every sound you hear. Beyond that, even if you were hiking out west or somewhere else with grizzlies where bears would be a concern you actually have far better odds with bear spray then a gun.""
This woman had never heard of bear spray and couldn't seem to handle the amount of information she was receiving. Her brain shorted out and reset to default happy lady with her dogs. She trotted along. I just hope she doesn't shoot someone. Gun owners, don't be like this lady, don't make us all look bad.
That's not the first person I've met that thinks people on the AT are facing the sprt of constant danger that would make carrying a gun neccessary. These are the same kind of people that barricade themselves in their houses with 40 kinds of locks and alarm systems and weapons in every room and never speak to strangers. The culture of fear and paranoia in the US perplexes me. At most I'd say maybe some pepper spray to deal with some creep at a road crossing. Other then that, the trail is safe, safe enough at least, you'll never be completely safe anywhere, it's true, but it's safe enough that it's not worth it to worry about it. Live your lives and stop taking your .45 to the grocery store.
I laid around at Pen-Mar with everyone and foraged for berries. Dad had been taking some hikers to town for a resupply and brought them back and crossed the Mason Dixon line with me. 
Home again. 
Dad also brought a warning. Apparently just before the shelter a tornado had touched down on Monday, ripping down massive trees and leaving them on the trail. The locals were recommending that hikers walk around this section on the roads. I said there wasn't a chance in hell of that, I'd buy a chainsaw and clear it myself if I had to, we don't skip miles here.
Dad went back to the truck and asked if I wanted anything. I laughed and said chicken tenders. He showed up at the next road crossing with 20 chicken tenders. I ate 14 and he had 6. What would I do without this outrageous man.
I warned him that if he kept coming down and visiting sooner or later someone would give him a trail name. My father was once a world champion cornhole player. 
Yes I'm serious. Him and his partner once finish 33rd at worlds. Yes there is a world championship of corn hole. He used to go out to tournaments every night and win almost every time, bringing home the prize money and putting it in his travel fund. We even started making our own bags. We never advertised once, but let them speak for themselves at the tournaments. We sold so many that it got out of hand and for a few years I was doing nothing but sew bags and was making a small fortune off of it. 
So, after telling that story to Booty Shorts, Jiffy, and Forward, they named him Corn Pops. 
The trail got more and more full of debris the closer I got to the tornado area. Of course PA greeted me with a tornado. This is exactly why I love it and can't live here.
The blowdowns were extreme to say the least. Healthy, living trees ripped down and lying about on trail, impossible to climb through, almost impossible to go around. I got stuck by a lot of thorns, and used guthooks to navigate most of the because I couldn't see where the trail was, but my conscience is clear. No miles were skipped. We don't skip miles here, no matter what. 
At the shelter (shelters, I should say, there's two of them) there were a couple of perfect hammock trees for Dad and I. The trouble was that they were just behind a sign that said ""restoration area, keep out"". I looked around. There were probably other good spots, but this was perfection. Why did this tiny area need restored? There was litterally hundreds of thousands of miles of pristine land all around. I looked down at the sign again. A mischievous smile crept across my face. I pulled the sign out of the ground, walked forward a few steps, and planted it back in the ground on the other side of my hammock trees. I've altered the course of history, the world will never be the same with five feet less of ground restored. I've altered the borders, may it lead to world peace. ","Ensign Cowall Shelter

Tumbling Run Shelter to Mile 1092.9
It's good to be home.
First thing in the morning Dad drove all of us (us being myself, Jill, Morgan, Yogi, and Bear Watch) out to Walmart for a resupply.
It turns out Yogi and Bear Watch are married. Who knew?
I got a coffee, Dad bought an entire cantaloupe.
We got back on trail and started a joyful 17 mile march. Dad drove around and met us partway and joined us for a bit. We crossed Rocky Mountain and enjoyed the rocky ridges, then started a nice gradual decline to Caledonia State Park. 
We hit a traffic cone and a sign that said ""Trail closed for storm damage, use detour"". I tossed the cone to the right and the sign to the left and we moved along. We found a friendly turtle on trail and patted his shell a bit before we set him off to the side so he'd be safe. We found no notable storm damage so I also moved the sign at the other side.
A nice old man taught me a Scottish saying that means ""may there always be smoke in your chimney"". May ya alum reek, I think he said.
Quarry Gap Shelter was downright ridiculous. Two huge shelters, a swing, landscaping. Landscaping! There was actual landscaping! Flowers, little pictures of ducks and distlefinks, welcome signs, you name it. The Potomac Appalachian Trail Club are heros.
We didn't stay there.
We finished out the hike and Dad showed up with four pizzas.
We sat in a circle, ate pizza, talked about life, and built a fire. Life was good, I do hope that Yogi and Bear Watch stick with us for a bit. Jill, in particular, seems dead set on the idea, constantly inviting them to stay and hike along with us.
I'm sleeping without my rain fly again tonight, I hope I'll be dry.

Mile 1092.9 to Mile 1105.9
Three month anniversary, halfway point, half gallon challenge, 1100 mile mark. It was a full day.
We started the day by finishing off the leftover pizza and chugging mountain dew, a nutritious hiker breakfast. It was the half gallon challenge day so I determined to not eat anything else until Pine Grove Furnace State Park. 
The campsite was so idyllic it was almost hard to leave. The tall, shady pines reminded me of the west.
Dad set up trail magic at the road and we took off. The trail was flat. Seriously, if ever there was a single day in this flatness and God forsaken stretch of land that could be called flat, today was it. A long stretch of high, almost gravelly soil, thing tree cover, lots of blueberry bushes (even a few ripe blueberries), and then a nice shelter with a friendly dog. 
We talked for a bit about how much of a flex these grandiose shelters must be on all the other trail clubs. I feel like if I was a trail maintainer from North Carolina and saw these I would just be embarrassed. These trail mansions are so much more then any of us need or deserve, but it's here. Good for you guys.
The trail made a road crossing just before the halfway point and Dad was set up there again doing trail magic. There was another guy too also giving out free food and drinks. 
Between the two magic stands, quite a group was assembled. Compass announced that at the 1100 mile mark him and the Smokey Bubble would be discussing trail safety 11 times, and everyone was else to assist them. 
We all found a 1/2 mark made of stones, but were unmoved by it. We built out own put of sticks and posed around it. 
What sort of divine intelligence prospered to have us reach the halfway point the day of our 3 month anniversary is beyond me. That puts us perfectly on schedule down to the day. You'd never guess that not one of us has been paying attention to our mileage.
Halfway. Now we were closer to Katahdin then we were to Springer. Everything we just went through, we just had to do it one more time.
I think I could do one more. One more hike up the stairs at Amicolola in the pouring rain with the steps washing out right after we crossed them, one more first night on trail with all the Zach's and finding our footing and learning how to be hiker trash. One more hitch with a former professional wrestler and one more climb into the smokies. One more night of freezing with hot rocks in our hands and Honeybadger setting her hair on fire. One more night at Groundhog screaming at the invading bears and laughing at our own misfortunes. One more round of hypothermic colds and apocalyptic rain and fog through the Roan Highlands, one more time surving the great Norovirus outbreak unscathed. One more 30 into Damascus for no reason and sleeping under a bridge one night and in a luxury b&b the next. One more trip across Grayson Highlands with the horses. One more slog through Virginia with The Chads one more time catching fish with Bear Girl. One more life changing sunset in Shenandoah and one more walk through Harper's Ferry. 1,090 some miles again, and I'd be there, except it was all going to be new. That was all from Springer, this would all be to Katahdin.
It's been a lot of cold, a lot of hot, a lot of blisters and screaming and a lot of smiling and laughing. It's been one of the happiest times in my life, and it's only halfway over.
We found the halfway point sign from 2018 and all agreed it sucked. There was a picture on it of a much cooler looking sign, we wanted that one. 
We soon came to the 1100 mile mark and as promised, there was the Smokey Bubble, very heavily into their safety meeting. I discussed trail safety with them a bit myself, and soon we were all floating down the trail, smiling, hungry, and very very safe. 
We got to another nice shelter where I befriended another dog named Clara. Dogs are loving me lately, almost as much as I love them. The house wolf is perhaps the most good boy species on this planet, and we need to show them all love for that.
Scratch them behind their ears.
At Pine Grove Furnace State Park is the half gallon challenge. Everyone is challenged to eat a half gallon of ice cream, that's a full tub plus another pint. I made one crucial error and got strawberry cheesecake flavor. I started eating my tub and pretty quickly stopped enjoying myself. Yogi sat across from me and was pounding down his. I looked up to catch my breath and Yogi drained the last bit of the tub. I was speechless, not even halfway through mine. It only took him 14 minutes. He stood up and casually bought a pint from the 10 year old girl working the stand (is that even legal? Good for you kid) and sat down and ate that. It was about that moment that I started despising strawberry cheesecake ice cream. Why did I pick something so thick and sweet? I'm sure I could've downed a whole half gallon of vanilla, but the flavor was too much. With my stomach hurting and heaving I laid down my spoon and gave up. I didn't want to end up like one of the hikers out puking in the bushes. I already felt like death. Yogi finished his pint and laid back. He did it, and he only regretted it a bit. He stood up and told the children of the store that he had done it. They gave him a tiny wooden spoon that said ""half gallon club"". 
Across the street was a thru hiker museum that was sadly closed today. We speculated on what might be in there. ""Probably an old Katahdin sign and one of Grandma Gatewood's sacks,"" Drafty speculated.
""Nah man, they probably have Grandma Gatewood in there,"" Compass theorized.
""She's all preserved in a mausoleum like Lenin,"" I agreed.
To everyone's surprise, The Smokey Bubble put on perhaps the worst showing  of anyone. None of them even finished half a tub. 
Compass was ending his thru hike there. His ex wife had announced that she was moving herself and their children down to Florida, and he decided that his kids were more important then his hike and he was going home to spend as much time with them as he could. It was an emotional goodbye with all the hikers, we were all sad to see him go. Compass is a tough guy, but I could see tears running out from behind his su glasses and down into his beard. The Smokey Bubble has lost a man, and so have all of us. In the beginning, people left all the time, but now that we're halfway it's assume that we're all going to make it. Bonds get stronger, people become family so quickly. I hate to see anyone leave the trail, but he at least goes with a good reason and a lot of memories.
Dad hiked out with us. The park was full of people, none of them hikers, all of them families out grilling with their kids. We drew some strange looks. Apparently people didn't realize the Appalachian Trail ran right through their picnic grounds. One group yelled out ""where are yall hiking to?""
""Maine,"" I yelled back.
They scoffed and brushed off the answer, ""no for real, where do you hike to around here?""
""All the way up,"" I said.
""What?""
""This is the Appalachian Trail, we just crossed the halfway point!""
""Oh you guys are HIKING hiking, you're really going for it. Your legs look like you've been going for it!""
We made it out of the park and camped near the border. Stride and Big Egg joined us. Stride wears a kilt as well. We like to joke about how everyone out here assumes that all kilt wearers know eachother, or how the day hikers feel some constant need to tell us about eachother.
Big Egg only recently got on trail. He's doing a flip flop, starting in Front Royale and hiking up to Katahdin, then driving back to Front Royale and hiking south to Springer. He is an immigrant from Myanmar. He had a thick accent but speaks English pretty well, and he an absolute tank of a hiker. 
All of us had some cantaloupe and beer, luxuries we can't carry out too often, and turned in after the sun went down. Dad leaves tomorrow morning, and after next week he probably won't see me again until he picks me up at Katahdin. I remember when I first started, I asked him not to pick me up anywhere else even if I asked. I don't think that's a concern anymore.","Mile 1092.9

Mile 1105.9 to Boiling Springs Camp
I miss talking to cows. Deer make bad conversationalists. 
All that ice cream yesterday combined with a lack of other food wreaked havoc on my stomach all night. We have a phrase out here that this website won't let me say. S******* p*** and p****** s*** we like to say. You know, when everything's backwards.
So I spent my morning p****** s*** and s******* p*** and left camp feeling kind of lethargic. Why on earth did I pick strawberry cheesecake ice cream? In what world was that a good idea?
Those first few miles went slow. It was hot as the Devil's ass today as well, and that didn't help. I tried eating food and felt an instant, but short-lived, boost. I pressed on to a store where I got a basket of fries and shrimp, some juice and two Dr. Peppers. That woke me up and put me back in gear, only problem was I was behind now. 
I saw Misha coming up to the store as I was leaving. It is kind if reassuring to know that if I ever fell behind I would still be among friends. Although, the way if the trail is that you're amongst friends always, even with strangers.
I made up time and kept pressing on, climbing through a nice flat forest then up over Center Point Knob. 
The Knob was covered in deer.
""Oh deer!,"" I would yell at them but they would throw up their tails and run like mad away. How rude.
I crossed the northern boundary if the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club's jurisdiction and gave an audible ""NOOOOOO!!!"" I'll miss those grand shelters. 
The trail dropped into the Cumberland Valley and left the ridges for corn and wheat fields. I got into the fields just as the sun was setting and the lightning bugs were coming out to light up the world. The last mile was like something out of some Midwestern fairy tale. Fields of grain, softly singing.2","Mile 1105.9

Breakfast in town was entertaining to say the least. 
Yogi: ""I wish like an old Mexican gunslinger would hike the trail""
Bear Watch: ""what the hell are you talking about?""
Morgan: ""My uncle is buying a house in a Jimmy Buffet retirement community!""
Me: ""Jimmy Buffet is a cult leader""
Yogi: ""I found an article called Hell is a Jimmy Buffet Retirement Community.""
Me: ""He's like the Osho of old people""
Jill, drinking her coffee and her cappuccino: ""Why did I get two of these I'm so jacked""
Yogi: ""like an old school gunslinger though with like a big Sombrero and spurs on his boots""
Boiling Springs is an idyllic town, quaint and picturesque that definitely put up that camp in the corn field to keep hikers from staying in town. The trail crosses right through the center of town and town seems to say ""come right in, we love you here, that's right, just keep walking, get on out, use the back door next time"". 
Today was spent crossing the Cumberland Valley. The valley was probably the longest stretch of relatively flat land on the entire trail. 18 miles or so between the ridges across the farmland. 
I was picking black raspberries along the trail when Bear Watch sprinted ahead and Morgan yelled ""trail magic!""
I picked a giant handful of berries and carried them to the road to offer the lady some reverse trail magic.
I picked more berries, moved at some cows, and honked at some geese. We were worried that we would be in the sun all day but thankfully the trail stayed along some trees in the fields. 
I bought two ears of sweet corn from a barefoot Mennonite boy riding a lawnmower for $1.25 and threw them in my pack. He had ice cold raw milk as well but sadly that was the last of my cash, and with heat like this milk might be a bad choice.
It's been in the 90s and sunny all week. Last night I even slept half the night without my underquilt. Each of us is a river of sweat. We all hike along as scantily clad as custom allows and wipe away the sweat from our faces while letting it flow off our bodies. You get used to it pretty fast, but still seek some relief. 
I found relief in the form of a large creek. I took off my shoes and shirt, waded in to make sure I couldn't see any houses or roads from the water, then threw off my kilt and dove in, waving to Jill and Morgan to follow. We washed the days of sweat off and enjoyed the swim in the nice cool water.
The crayfish were massive, like small lobsters. I caught a few and briefly considered cooking them for supper, but I still had four miles to go and doubted they would live that long. I threw them back to die another day, still one of these days I want crayfish.
In the early evening I got to the base of the next ridge and climbed up, looking back at the agricultural patchwork below. The valley was conquered. 
I built a fire at the shelter and threw in my corn husks. I rotated them a few times then pulled them out once the husk was black and crispy. I pulled the husk away and found perfectly cooked corn on the cob below, and bit in happily. 
Mowgli and Drafty entertained us with music and stories all night before we all went to bed after the sunset.","Boiling Springs Camp

Darlington Shelter to Duncannon 
Another night of unbearable heat. I slept half the night with my underquilt pulled off to the side, the other half sweating. 
We got up early and headed out for Duncannon. The way was rocky but flat, but the heat was murderous. I've never sweat so much so consistently. It was pouring off of me in rivers. 
I jumped on top of a haybail and took a short break. The farms here are really beautiful, but you can't linger in the direct sun of the fields for too long. 
We went down into Duncannon, where my whole family was waiting for me. Dad, Aunt Bonnie, Nana, Pap, and Chase the dog. 
I composed myself for a second, still so hot and sweaty I couldn't properly speak, then I crouched down to say hi to Chase. He backed away a bit, unfamiliar with how I was looking. Then he sniffed a bit and a hint of recognition came to him. He stepped forward and smelled and immediately realized who I was. His tail wagged and he barked and jumped around in celebration. 
We are taking a zero at the house tomorrow, so Dad drove Drafty, Mowgli, Yogi, Bear Watch, Jill, and Morgan back to the house while I went to Nana and Paps for a bit to play with Chase, then went over to Dad's house. We spent the day ordering Chinese Food and playing music and watching Hot Rod.
We ordered over $100 worth of food, and the lady on the phone casually wrote down our laundry list of orders and said ""OK, 15 minutes"". Morgan said ""I can't make cereal in 15 minutes!""
Drafty and I made friends with some tweakers in the Chinese restaurant. I told them we lived in the woods and it blew their minds. 
There's a scene in Hot Rod where the main character falls down a hill for several minutes. Mowgli said, ""that's me going down to the water source!""
Dad went to work and immediately decided that was a terrible idea and came back home. ","Darlington Shelter

Zero at Home
It feels strange to be in my childhood home and still hiking. Usually all of my strange galvanizing is separated from my ""home"" life, but now here I am, here home is, and here everyone is.
We started the day by making toast and omelets for everyone. Next we loaded up the boat and drove out to the river. We all jumped in, Mowgli played Rock Lobster over the boats speakers and danced on the bow. 
We drank beer and floated about on a tube. Next we ran a rope out and started a more extreme form of tubing.
During this time, Mowgli was attacked by the boat. He tried to climb aboard and his foot found a sharp metal connector and sliced his toe open. He was bleeding all over the place and Drafty had to wrap up it up. Mowglis spirits dropped almost instantly. You could see the worry creep into his eyes as he stared at the gash on his toe, no doubt thinking about the trail and what this could mean for his thru hike. 
It was quickly decided that Mowgli should go get stitches and antibiotics. Yogi, being an angel and the most sober person on the boat, volunteered to drive him in. 
We wondered what we should do next, go back out or just go home after that incident. ""Mowgli would want us to go have fun!"" I declared and we ran the boat back to the sand bar, but no more tubing happened. 
Instead we all opened a beer, gave a cheers to Mowgli's foot, and tried to think of a way to cheer him up. 
""What does he like?"" asked Morgan.
""He's a simple man, he likes music and trail safety"", I answered.
We tried to write him a song.
""Sweet Baby Mowgli cut his Toegli,
If it weren't for that propeller he'd of been a ten toed feller,
But he's gonna keep walking til he makes it to Katahdin,
Sweet Baby Mowgli cut his Toegli!""
Then soon, with the help of more beer, it was determined we should call him ""Mowgli Nine-Toes"".
Then the singing devolved even further to a cover of ""Jolene""
""Mowgli, Mowgli, Mowggglllliiiiii!
I'm begging of you please don't be an amputee,
Drafty talks about you in his sleep,
There's nothing he can do to keep from crying,
When he calls your name, Mowgli"" ect ect.
At the end of the day Mowgli ended up with nine stitches and a ten day recovery period, which he will spend living in my dad's house. 
Drafty took the news a bit hard. Him and Mowgli had met on the first day and been together every day since, the best of friends immediately. We asked Drafty what he plans to do and he solemnly answered ""the trail goes north, and so do I.""
Compass is off trail, Mowgli is injured and recovering, Zen and Not So Bad are fallen behind, and Riptide is even further back after having a friend visit. It would appear that, at least for the moment, The Smokey Bubble has popped. What just last week seemed to be the sturdiest and closest tramily on trail has dissipated. 
We made quesadillas and got a good night's sleep, wore out from the days fun. Mowgli was back in his usual high spirits, claiming that he'd be back before we knew it. ","Duncannon

Duncannon to Peter's Mountain Road.
We packed up, resupplied, and got back to the trail. 
The trail at this point passes through Duncannon for quite some time.
Duncannon is a town in decline. It's economy seems to run on strip clubs and funeral homes, both of them dot the outskirts of Duncannon like vultures about a dead cow. Noone looks happy ro see you, noone looks happy to be there.
I love old towns, decrepit towns, places that have hit rock bottom. When a town goes so far down it becomes gritty and dangerous. Art arrives, shops become stranger and more experimental, food gets good. That's one of the things I love so much about Chicago, or Flint or even Harrisburg, but Duncannon refuses to crash or get interesting. It doesn't seem to be crashing, just simply decaying. It's become an ugly sore on an otherwise beautiful landscape. It refuses to have any redeeming qualities.
Immediately after Duncannon, however, is the Susquehanna river. Growing up, this was what people referred to as ""The River"". Probably the widest river on the AT, the Susquehanna houses a fake statue of liberty that someone thought would be a fun prank but the state loved so much they paid to refurbish it, Three Mile Island the nuclear plant that nearly killed us all, and a decent population of fish and one fugitive alligator. The river is often thought of as the boundary between the north and south part of the trail. It's also the inspiration for a really good song by Defiance Ohio. 
The bridge felt like forever. The climb on the other side took less time, I'm fairly certain. After that it was more hiking, Rock scrambling, and enjoying some views. I had my first reverse donkey in quite some time, and I picked out a friend's house from above.
A few miles down I was greeted by a chocolate labaradoodle named Odie. Last time I saw him he was a tiny puppy I could hold in one hand. Now he's half grown with Shaggy hair and a little beard. Despite his age, he is calm and incredibly well behaved. There is wisdom and understanding in his eyes. It is as if he was born old and wise, like Morgan Freeman. 
Behind Odie was my childhood friend Aarron, who had driven up to Peter's Mountain Road after work and hiked in with his dog. 
The three of us hiked back out, Odie excitedly leading the way and Aarron listening to my stories and making fun of my kilt. We got back to his truck and drove to the Carsonville Hotel for supper. 
It may just be a Pennsylvania thing, or maybe it's everywhere and I haven't noticed, but the Carsonville Hotel is not a hotel. There's a very specific type of bar, too nice to be a true dive bar but with a similar attitude, regulars and locals always inside, a bartender that learns your name and has a real conversation with you, and some over the top incredible bar food. The foods not modern or hipstery, but old, tried and true and unhealthy, the sort of  you dream about for years after. And all of these bars, despite containing no parador, pension, or hostelry call themselves ""hotels"". 
We got soft pretzels, wings, bacon cheeseburgers, and Yuengling. The guy tending bar was busy, running back and forth all over the place, but ran back to me and Aarron every chance he got to listen in to what I was saying about the trail. 
We drove to Aarron's house, just off the trail, and Odie sat on my lap the whole way. Aarron's longtime girlfriend Cybil waited for me at their house and gave me a hug when I walked through the door. I took a shower and sat and talked with them in the living room. 
Aarron was the one who introduced me to Corey when we were still in school, we used to go fishing together every year on the opening day of trout season, and he was along for my first ever backpacking trip. I'm surprised he never left PA with Corey and I, but he seems content here. He has Cybil and Odie, a nice little house in Clark's Valley. 
Cybil and I had a bit of a deep talk after Aarron went to bed. She had just finished nursing school when the pandemic hit, and ended up working on the covid floor of a hospital, working long hours and watching patient after patient die, and trying desperately day in and day out to save as many people as they could. The pressure mounted and eventually became too much, and now as the pandemic wanes she finds herself working the front desk in a different part of the hospital. She told me she's not sure she wants to be a nurse anymore. I reminded her that she doesn't have to, she's still young and Aarron would support any decision she made. She said she wished she had traveled and explored a bit more, she said she wished she could do something like what I've been doing. I laughed at that and said sometimes I wished I could be a bit more like her and Aarron, and have my life together and a nice dog and a good relationship and be satisfied.
She has a lot going for her, most importantly a loving partner who stands by her side. They've been together for almost eight years now, far longer then any relationship I'd ever been in. With that comment she asked me if I was seeing anyone. 
""Not officially,"" I answered, ""although I've been talking with someone"". 
Dating is an odd thing when you're a seasonal worker. Practically every time it's been a fast and hard, passionate affair that burns through the summer and ends up flaming in a roadside dumpster once the season ends. Over the years I had grown a bit cynical at the concept, some of those burnouts nearly killed me, so I determined not to bother anymore. Then this past winter I met a lovely lady who's company I enjoyed immensely. We never made it official, she existed somewhere in the space between girlfriend and a really close roommate, and then when the season ended I expected she would decide she had no more use for me and leave like all the rest. Only she didn't, or at least she hasn't. Despite the distance between us, and even despite the fact that I've tried to get a head start on this thing and push her away, she still talks to me, still seems to want this to work. She's even said she'll hike the PCT with me if I want her to. Something is different here, for some reason she seems to like me just as much outside the park as inside, even now that I'm on the trail. And what's more fascinating, I haven't stopped liking her, not in the least. 
Cybil gave a big smile at that, ""then don't stop talking to her"" ","Duncannon

Peter's Mountain Road to Rausch Gap Shelter
Aarron had to be at work early but Cybil woke me up and took me out to breakfast with her parents. They are nice people, although a bit sheltered in their central PA lives. They were a bit shocked at the long hair and the kilt but I quickly won them over and they were kind enough to buy me breakfast.
Cybil dropped me off at the trailhead and I hiked on.
If there's one stretch of trail that I could call my own it's the miles between Peter's Mountain and Swatara Gap. I've hiked through here a hundred times, I went to camp at the base of the Mountain in fifth grade and the class hiked up to the trail and to Table Rock, which I now stop and look out from. It looks smaller then it did in fifth grade. 
Next comes Peter's Mountain Shelter where I took my first backpacking trip with Aarron and Corey, where I took my first girlfriend and slept in the loft, where my friends took me before I moved out of PA for the first time. 
After that the trail follows the ridge and drops down to Clark's Valley, where I used to go fishing in the kids area and catch my limit every year, where me and my friends got chased out of our fishing hole by a crazed man with a gun, and where we used to go to drink and laugh and smoke cigarettes (at least we all quit that nonsense).
I found Dad and Mowgli set up with trail magic at Clark's Creek. Dad brought me my new filter that I ordered from REI, the Katadyn BeFree, we'll see how that works. Mowgli had his guitar in hand and his foot propped up. 
I planned to go all the way to ny mother's house today, but decided to cut it short and stay at the Rausch Gap Shelter instead, still a solid 21 mile day. ","Peter's Mountain Road

Rausch Gap Shelter to Greenpoint School Road
The talk of the shelter thing morning was the beavers. A warning on guthokks said the trail was flooded out by beaver ponds, but of course on trail that warning was expanded to a flood of biblical proportions, swallowing all things, living or dead. The trail was guarded by giant killer beavers with club and knives and chainsaws who would drown you, steal your money and make you a part of their dams. 
After crossing the old railroad bed and passing the beaver bypass trail (I'm not rerouting because of a beaver!) I found the flooded area. It was about forty feet wide and could easily be traversed without getting your shoes wet, you just had to walk across the logs. After that was simple dryland hiking. 
I've hiked this short section litterally hundreds of times. I got to the field, texted my mom, picked her some black raspberries and my step-dad came and picked me up on a four wheeler. 
Gunner lost his mind when I came in the door. He must have missed me terribly. It was hard knowing this would probably be the last time I ever saw him. I spent my whole day playing with him, giving him extra treats and telling him I was going to Katahdin just like I always used to talk about when we would walk out to the trail together. I don't know that I ever would have made it here without that dog. 
My family and I all went out to the Fredericksburg Hotel (also not a hotel) and enjoyed some drinks and food.","Rausch Gap Shelter

Greenpoint School Road to Mile 1193.4
I took Gunner for a walk today. When I tried to turn left to go back to the house he stopped and wouldn't follow. I pulled on his leash and he stood still. I understood at once and let him lead the way, he led me around the long way, as if he knew this would be the last time and he wanted to make it last as long as he could. 
I said by to him and crossed the road and got back on trail before collapsing and sobbing for a good while. The vet said his cancer would come back soon and he probably wouldn't live more then three months. That was two months ago. As much as he's acting like his usual self, full of energy and happy as can be, it won't last. Chances are good he won't be there when I get back from Katahdin. But he was my first hiking partner, and I think he'd be proud that I'm going. 
More familiar trail for a few miles down through the state park and across the bridge over the Swatty (that's the Swatara for you normal folks). It struck me as odd that I knew so little about the trail north of here. I've been on quite a few sections to the south, but north of the Swatara is an absolute mystery to me.
Rocksylvania is living up to its name. Lots of climbing and clamoring. 
That weird fungus is back under my right armpit again. I got the idea to try and kill it with hand sanitizer, which my mom was kind enough to refill for me while I was there. I rubbed the stuff under my arm and then on my hands and was attacked by the single most nauseating stench I've been afflicted by on the trail yet. Whoever makes this hand sanitizer should be made to answer for their crimes against humanity, this stuff is intolerable. For the rest of the day I couldn't stop and take a break, I had to keep moving to keep ahead of the stench.
I hiked on and found a camp out past the William Penn Shelter. I texted my group and found out they are about 18 miles ahead of me. I decided not to make a huge effort to catch up right away, since every time I fall behind I seem to meet cool people. I'm going to enjoy this new solitude for all its worth. 
I forgot it was the 4th of July until all the fireworks and gunshots started. Happy birthday America, hopefully this racket quits before we all have a conniption.","Greenpoint School Road

Mile 1193.4 to PA Route 183
My day started with a guy grilling cheeseburgers in the parking lot. I sat and ate and Dolly came up and joined me. Dolly had been hiking with (and we all assume dating) Hollywood but now he has apparently gone ahead to reach Katahdin more quickly. I thanked her for saving my credit card for me back in Virginia.
Soon Whitecap, Pocket Snacks, Gretchen (who still doesn't have a trail name somehow) and others crowded in and I decided it was time for me to move on. 
I hiked up to the 501 shelter, fully enclosed and near enough to the road to deliver pizza. I needed neither pizza nor a place to rest, but went in mostly for the log book.
Drafty has been keeping a very entertaining and completely accurate narrative of the Mowgli's toe incident. As he tells it, Mowgli shotgunned 15 PBRs before diving in and having the propeller sever his entire toe, Bear Watch dove in and swam back with it in her mouth, Jill swam it in while Yogi took Mkwgli up in his arms and ran him to the hospital. 100% accurate.
Trails get rockier every day. Speaking of Rocky he texted me last night saying he would reach Pennsyltucky today, and that we should start the PCT next year on the same day. I'm through lying to myself, PCT 2022 let's get it. That's right, all of my fans can rejoice! I love you both to death and we're having a sequel.
But anyway, rocks. Rocks slow you down and give you ankle pains. Rocks are what causes your shoes to wear down and your health to deteriorate. It was rocks that burned the library of Alexabdria, birthed Ghengis Khan, and killed Franz Ferdinand. Rocks lead to lower birth rates and higher death rates, they unstabilized our economies and robbed us of goods and services while robbing me of my balance. Rocksylvania is real. 
I missed a turn in the Hertline Creek area, and stumbled upon a dammed up creek. The pond was big and green and inviting and empty. I rushed down to it and found a rope swing and Dolly at the dam breast. She smiled and said she didn't want to swim alone. I said I'd swim with her, but wqrned her I wasn't wearing anything below my kilt. 
I threw my pack and shoes and kilt aside and jumped in, being met with a shock. The water was so cold it took my breathe away. I couldn't even speak. The change from the 90 degree heat to the icy waters was so sudden I could barely even swim. 
Dolly yelled from shore ""how is it?"" and I was incapable of answering. She put her feet in and knew instantly that she wasn't going in. She's smarter then I, it would appear.
I've never had my thighs go numb before, but somehow today was the day. That frozen skinny dipping was actually a lovely wake up, I felt energized and cranked out those last couple miles in no time at all.
Dad is taking me home for the next two nights. I've been feasted and put up the whole way through PA, but my luxury is coming to an end. He won't be coming out to slackpack me anymore either. Two more night and I'm on my own. But today, he packed me out an eight piece fried chicken, which I shared with Dolly. 
Dad drive me home from the road crossing. I said hi to Mowgli when I got home and asked how his toe was helping up. 
Mowgli had adapted to living in my dad's house like a trout adapts to a new beaver pond. Dad is basically always either working, sleeping, or just generally not around, so Mowgli has been left alone to enjoy the solitude of the modern American household. And he has made the most of it, Playstation and curry every night. Dad says he's just happy someone is actually using the house.

Today will likely be my last day of this glorious stroll through PA. No more beds, showers, likely no more slackpacking for the rest of the trail. Dad goes back to work, I'm getting farther away from home, and to be honest I'm ready for it to be done. I'm actually so relieved to be getting back to some real thru hiking, back to hitching and going weeks without a proper shower. Having home and vehicle support has been getting much too comfortable, as great as it has been. 
I said bye to Mowgli and Dad drove me to the trail and hiked in a few miles. Nothing too exciting on trail today, just the usual oppressive heat and even more oppressive rocks. 
Strolling along, felt an itch under my shoes. I ignored it, but soon it became a drilling pain that couldn't be ignored. I sat down and ripped off my shoes when it became intolerable. I found a big red mark there, as if something had bitten me. 
There was a steep climb down into Port Clinton. Dad waited for me, drive me home, and we got more of my favorite Chinese food. Tomorrow I carry my pack and sleep in the woods again.","PA Route 183

As planned, Dad dropped me off with my pack and a Mountain Dew. He's got a lot of work coming up and then he's going to Yellowstone for a few weeks, so I probably won't see him again until after I reach Katahdin. 
I walked through town, then down along the river. 
I reached a new phase of my foraging today. Looking in the bushes near the river, I found that some of the blackberries had turned that pre ripe red, then I looked closer and found a few king berries that had turned that dark purple color that meant they were ripe and ready to be eaten. 
We've entered a new phase, the black raspberry is past its time and the day of the blackberry is just now beginning.
After a short stop at Pocahontas Spring to fill up water I resurrected a dead woman. 
Walking up from the spring I was startled to see a limp body laying in the trail. I ran up to see what was happening. It was a young lady, her pack was off, her phone was laying next to her and playing music, and her head was propped against her pack. She looked like she had laid down suddenly but deliberately. 
""You alright there?"" I asked and got absolutely no response. I tapped her on the leg with my trekking pole. No movement.
Was she even breathing? I started to get concerned. I bent down and placed a hand on her shoulder and gave her shake, soft at first but then harder and harder. She made no sign that she was conscious or even alive.
""Oh my God"", I said and stood up, looking around. Worried she had been attacked in some form or another I gave the area a quick glance, but found no evidence of struggle and noone peering from the bushes.
I turned my attention back to the girl. Her hands were tucked between her knees as she lay on her side. I lifted her leg up and pulled a hand out. Her skin didn't feel cold, that was at least a good sign. Her hand was as limp as the rest of her. I frantically turned her hand over and found her wrist, looking for her pulse. I felt nothing.
""No, I must be in the wrong spot, where's the vein?"" I felt around further on the underside of of her wrist and suddenly felt a beat. Just then her eyes opened and she gave a startled yelp. I was so surprised I gave a yelp myself and then fell backwards.
""What? Who are you?"" 
""Are you okay?"" I asked.
""Yeah"" she said, seeming to have been enjoying being dead and now terribly upset that I had brought her back. Or maybe she just hated being a zombie, hard to tell.
""Are you just sleeping here?"" I asked.
""""I was,"" she said and laid her head back down, annoyed.
""But you... I.... I've been trying to wake you up for like five minutes! I almost called 911, you are the heaviest sleeper I've ever seen, I thought you were dead!""
She ignored me and closed her eyes. 
She seemed annoyed at me for waking her so I left her be. I walked away both frightened and confused.
I hope she wasn't too frightened or confused herself. It's not every day that you wake up to a strange man in the forest holding your hand, I'm probably just lucky I was pepper sprayed. I knew there were a few people behind me so I decided to let them handle it if anything was truly wrong. Maybe she's fine and just napping, maybe she's suffering heat exhaustion, maybe she's on drugs, who knows? I tried my best. 
The trail climbed up to Pulpit Rock, then to The Pinnacle where I stopped to cool down and eat supper. I was trying cooking with lentils, curry, and powdered coconut milk for the first time. It was okay but definently needed more flavor, so I added some hot sauce and a packet of honey I smuggled out of a restaurant. Tolerable, but I wouldn't say good. 
Jill, Morgan, and now Yogi have all texted me asking where I am. I ignored all of them. It's kind of a liberating feeling, nokne knowing where you are. I was feeling another solo adventure. The last time I split off from the group I got those joyous days with Bear Girl, if this time is half that good it will be a resounding success. 
Still, they might be worried. I told them all where I was and they let me know they were 26 miles ahead. I gave a laugh, turns out I was screwing around at home longer then I thought, and now I was world's away from the others. Which was just fine with me.

It rained overnight and stayed cloudy all day. This left the rocks pleasantly cool. Throughout the day, whenever the sweat started pouring and I needed relief, I would find a long flat rock and lay naked on it until I felt sufficiently cool and like I could walk again. It's that hot. 
More of the same for a Pennsylvania trail, rocks, heat, bugs, the occasional view of farmland.
I realized that I wasn't far from Palmerton and texted Squeak to see if her yard was still open. She said yes, although she lost her glasses and can't drive, but I could hitch there and she'd even let me play her bagpipes.
There's apparently a nudist resort there too that will let you swim in there pool. Bagpipes and public nudity sounds like an adventure, I'm in.
The sky grew dark later in the day. Around 5:30 the sky grew so black that the lightning bugs came out, followed by actual lightning. 
I was near a road crossing so I hid under the porch of a restaurant for a bit until the rain slowed down. I thought about getting some food but the bartender told me to keep my wet jacket outside and I decided it was too fancy and probably expensive.
I pushed on a bit further until I got hungry and wet and decided to call it a day. I set up my tarp first, cooked under it, and discovered that powdered coconut milk will congeal when boiled and grow out over the pot. It's a big mess. 
For cooking water, I held my filter bag under a corner of the tarp and caught the rainwater as it poured off.
I made some instant rice noodle and onion soup and added some coconut and curry to it and it was delicious, incredible.

Mile 1247.2 to Squeaks House
I woke up and it was raining, so I went back to bed. Sleeping along is always awkward and involves lots of waking up for no reason.
I got up again when the rain stopped. I left two bottles at the corners of my tarp to catch rain water, and was pleasantly surprised to find them full. I filtered the water just to be safe then went out on trail.
You know what comes next, rocks. Rocks sacked the city of Constantinople, rocks convinced the British to conquer India, rocks are the reason China won't free Tibet, rocks killed Tom Petty. We all hate rocks.
I stopped at Bake Oven Shelter and felt sorry for anyone who would be joining the trail club that took care of that place. It was falling apart, even the picnic table was splintered and missing boards. The water source was probably the single worst water hike I've done on trail, I wish I had set out more water catching devices last night.
At some point I got weak and shaky, so I sat down and ate the entirety of the non cook able foods in my bag. That made me feel better.
The trail led across ridges and forests and power lines and eventually dropped down to the Lehigh River, where I stuck my thumb out to hitch to Squeak's house in Palmerton. A car stopped and picked me up, it's driver was a rough looking woman in her thirties who said she never picks up hitchikers.
As I climbed in, she asked me what I was doing and I told her I was hiking the Appalachian Trail.
""Duuuuddddeee,"" she said in a stoned sort of voice, ""I was just in jail and they made me stay in the hole, have you ever been to jail? No? The hole is like, where they put you when you're bad, they put me in the whole for 27 days because I tried to smuggle Xanax into the jail, what's your name dude?""
""Smuggler,"" I said.
""Haha, no way! So they put me in the hole for 27 days and all I had was this book about this guy who did that, and I told myself as soon as I get ooouuutttt of this place, that's what I'm doing!""
""Did you do it?""
""Do what?"" She asked as she swerved around a car. 
I have to admit I was enjoying this conversation. ""The trail, did you ever try to hike the trail?""
""Oh, nooo dude. Where does it go?""
""Well it comes off that mountain,"" I said pointing, ""and then crosses back there and goes up this mountain.""
""Ohhh I thought it went that way,"" she said, pointing to the mountain I just came off of. 
""It does, but then it crosses and keeps going here"".
""But how does it go both ways?""
She was a lost cause, it ride my best but she just didn't get it. She asked how long I was out and I said three months. She was taken aback by that. She was amazed.
""Have you ever taken psychedelic mushrooms?"" She asked with sudden vigor.
""Yeah,"" I said.
""Check these out!"" She yelled and produced a massive, vacuum sealed pack of mushrooms. 
I held the brick in my hand for a half a second and said, ""are you taking them tonight?""
""Yeeeaahhh!"" She answered with exuberance, ""you should come to my place and take some with me! You can take a shower too if you want!""
It was kind of her to offer, and while doing mushrooms in the shower with a paroled felon who I just met is honestly just the sort of nonsense that I can't get enough of I had a few reasons to decline. For one thing, I wanted to get to Squeaks and get a look at those bagpipes. For another thing, I haven't taken psychedelics since I was 20. And probably most importantly, I don't want to die in Pennsylvania. Save the drugs with strangers for another state.
I talked with the woman for quite a whole, She was actually really nice, if somewhat branded. I thanked her extensively and then walked a few blocks to Squeaks.
Squeak is everyone's hero out here. A trail angel who is so in love with the culture she just let's anyone and everyone sleep in the yard for free. There are three rules: you can't defecate in the yard, you can't let the cats out, and you can't do meth, crack, or heroin with the neighbors. Otherwise, she says, make yourself at home.
2fer was here when I got here and soon Weatherman and Colideskope joined in, all sleeping in the yard. Squeak plays bagpipes professionally, and plays in a band every Thursday. She let me blow into them and I gained a new respect for every piper on Earth. I had no idea just how hard it is to sound the Goose, I could get all three drones but that was it. Squeak serenaded the neighborhood with a few songs then put her pipes away.
We spent the night talking about hikers, dead people, strippers, tinder, music and Scotland, then finished with a shot of Irish whiskey and I went off to bed. ","Mile 1247.2

Everyone else left Squeaks early, around six am. Because I refuse to acknowledge any hour before eight as a legitimate time, I slept in until nine. 
I dreamed that I was riding a horse named Stolzfus and Jamie Lannister beat me I'm a race through the woods. What does this mean, you ask? What does this have to do with the trail? Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
Squeaks husband was nice enough to drive me back to trail when I got up. They seem to have an interesting relationship to go along with everything else about them that could only be described as interesting. Go there, you'll see what I mean. Squeak is all of our lord and savior. It's people like her that make the trail so special.
The mountain above Palmerton is polluted with heavy metals from the zinc mining. All the growth on it is from the last ten years, before that is was a post apocalyptic hellscape. It still kind of is. The springs are polluted and shouldn't be drunk unless it's a dire emergency, so I had to conserve water the whole way through.
Soon I was on bare rock climbing my way up a nearly vertical face. It was about time the trail threw something fun at me again. 
I attached my poles to my pack and climbed up the rocks, following the white blazes as I went. The sky threatened thunderstorms, the trail threatened rock climbs, and the environment threatened lymphoma. I pushed through all of it, but the heat got to me. I climbed the last bit naked, since I never made it out to the nudist resort and mostly because it was just genuinely that hot out.
I squeezed a clump of staghorn sumac berries and licked the sour juice off my hand. I'd've loved to make some sumac lemonade, but I had neither the time, the equipment, nor the water. There was a nice surprise waiting for me at the top though.
The wineberries have finally started to open and get ripe, I picked my my first few at the top of the mountain. Delicious, less seeds then black raspberries, and growing everywhere this year. I ate and ate them as I walked along.
The black raspberries are now rotting on the vine. It pains me to say it, but their time is up. I stopped stopping when I saw them. 
I ran into Rock, Roots, and Tinder and watched Tinder fall off the side of the trail. That led to her spouting out a laundry list of injuries she's sustained from falling off this trail. She is unfortunately quite find of injuring herself.
There was trail magic at Blue Mountain Road. Some thru hikers from 2019 were set up with sodas, beer, freezepops, and a grill. They made me a bacon cheeseburger.
It was a divine experience.
I went until I came to another road crossing, this one with a spring .6 down the road. I was passed by four or five cars on the way down and took that as a sign I might be able to get a ride back up. I didn't see a single car when I walked back up.
I realized that I was going to be hiking in the dark so I made supper there too. Knorr rice, lentils, curry powder, powdered coconut milk, and pita bread. Always eat before s night hike because you won't want to when you get to camp and you litterally cannot skip a meal out here.
Next came night hiking, good times. Brush the bigs away from the headlamp, trip on a few rocks, blare some music and clank your poles together at every sound you hear. 
I made it three and a half miles to the shelter in the dark and got set up. ","Squeak's House

Leroy A Smith Shelter to Kirkridge Shelter 
I had every intention of getting to Deleware Water Gap today. That would have gotten me out of Pennsylvania. I even had a church hostel picked out for when I arrived. Good intentions so rarely pan out.
I woke up and it was raining. That put me right back to bed. I woke up again and it was drizzling. That just made me thirsty.
On the way to the water source I met a 2020 hiker named Beast Mode and an 18 year old kid on his first solo trip named Isaac. 
The three of us ended up sitting in the shelter for over an hour, discussing efficient farming techniques, space travel, future human colonies on other planets, the moon, and of course trail safety. 
Isaac, being young and on his first trip, had a lot of questions, so I hiked out with him for the first five miles. I explained hammock camping, the reason I no longer used pack covers (because they're useless and pack liners actually keep things dry), berry identification, and how to take an eight year gap year (and counting). Thankfully, for his sake, Isaac is ignoring me on that last bit and going to college for environmental science (although he dropped out of AP environmental science, my favorite class, which seems a bit concerning but I hope it works out for him).
At Wind Gap Isaac decided to try out hitchhiking for the first time. I waved goodbye to him and wished him the best of luck. I took a liking to the kid, he's blown away by everything he sees, fascinated by the woods and hills around him everywhere he looks. He reminds me a lot of myself at that age (I sound more and more like an old guy every day). 
There was a rundown trailer park with a big sign that said ""yard sale"" pointing towards the bowels of it. Figuring this was probably the largest community gathering in the history of this trailer park, I decided to attend. 
It was a perfect picture of rural America. Strange accents, missing teeth, cigarettes smoking, a guy who rode up on his lawnmower, all the works. They were all having the time of their lives, the whole trailer park was out to exchange their VHS tapes and Def Leopard CDs. 
I couldn't buy anything (or rather couldn't haul anything if I did buy it) but I had a nice talk with the residents of Wind Gap and a couple even let me fill my water from their hose. I hope their yard sale is profitable and Mr. Lahey doesn't catch them. Be well people of Wind Gap.
Crossing the road I found 2fer sitting at the trailhead having lunch. I joined her and she showed me twelve hornet stings on her leg and told me how she had been attacked by bees and then broke her phone and had someone obtained a new one and still stayed ahead of me (the trail provides). 
I remembered I still had a can of beer that Squeak had given me before I left so the two of us split it and 2fer told me about her husband. She said the secret to a happy marriage was respecting eachothers space and privacy. She told me she had run into a few people who said they were surprised her husband ""let"" her do this. She said she always let those people know she was her own person and could do whatever she wanted, she didn't need anyone's permission, least of all her husband's.
2fer was also pushing toward Deleware Water Gap and intent on staying at the church.
An elderly fellow came up to us and tried to give us cards with a Bible website on it. When we said no thank you he started preaching about the apocalypse and how we were living in the final days. Nothing out of the ordinary, if Jesus people ever stop saying the world was ending I'd be concerned. 
I picked up my pack and turned to go, so did 2fer. 
""Do you beleive in the Bible?"" The proselytizing old fellow asked, with some force.
""No"" we both answered in unison.
The old man went through all five stages of grief in about four seconds, then turned his head, gave us a defeated look, and waddled back to his car.
""Well then, I'll see you at church"", I told 2fer with the greatest irony.
The rocks have been tearing my feet to shreds. They were sore and throbbing for the next few hours, and the going was slow. My chances of getting out of PA grew more and more distant as the miles went by more slowly. On top of the rocks, there a tornado warning for tonight. With that in mind, I stopped at Kirkridge Shelter and set up inside.","Leroy A Smith Shelter

Mile 1474.5 to Pine Swamp Brook Shelter 
Last night, after journaling, I looked up at the sky and thought it looked slightly ominous. Since I was set up on the side of a litteral cliff I hadn't set up my tarp was just hoping it wouldn't rain. I checked the weather and saw that it was to rain all night. I cursed myself for choosing this completely ridiculous camping spot and set about trying to set up a tarp while clutching a cliff naked in the dark. 
Since there was no dirt to put stakes in, I just draped it over my hammock and tied the ropes together. The result was a sauna. My shoes and pack were outside, 20 yards back on some flat ground, they would get wet but that couldn't be helped.
Don't camp on cliffs kids, it's a terrible idea.
Packing up camp in the morning was a whole nother adventure, with the cliff now being wet and slippery. It's a miracle I didn't die.
Descending was a pain as well but that was followed up by miles of flat trail along a river. The only thing that are it a challenge was the mosquitoes, but I could outpace them on the flat ground.
The trail climbed up a particularly lovely peak, Pine Knob. The slopes were flowing with rushing cascades on every side everywhere I looked and the top was covered in a thick grove of pines. The air smelled sweet and piney, it smelled like the west, like home. I drank it in as I enjoyed the views.
My phone being almost dead, I called a lady in Salisbury that takes in hikers. She is quite old and has a hard time hearing, I struggled to make myself understood. After about five minutes of shouting I'm honestly not sure if I have a room reserved or not. I'll find out tomorrow night when I get to Salisbury. Mad respect to her though for still helping out the community being as old as she is.
Last night I told Marsha that I was unsure if we should be together, and today I got to listen to a thousand screaming voices in my head. Some were saying that I was right, that all I was going to end up doing was hurting her and wasting her time, others were telling me I was a moron and should run back and beg forgiveness because I had finally found someone willing to put up with me. All agreed, it's hard to know what to do when you actually care about someone. 
I may not have to worry about it anyway because these mosquitoes may be enough to kill me. They are swarming, I had to eat supper in my hammock tonight. Even now, they line my bug net and swarm the outside.","Mile 1474.5

Kirkridge Shelter to Mile 1307.5
It stormed pretty bad over night, I don't know if they ever got the tornados they were calling for, but I was woken up a few times by thunder and was glad to be in the shelter.
A bit of rain blew in and hot the very end of my hammock, but I didn't even notice it until morning.
I sat and spoke with the shelter people for a bit then got in the trail. I was only six miles to Deleware Water Gap and I couldn't get there fast enough. I was tired of these Pennsylvanian rocks, jarring and jabbing my feet every single day, slowing me down and making me come up short. 
The rocks were wet which made the steep descent to the Gap even more treacherous then usual. I had to focus hard on where each footstep was going and make sure it didn't slide out from under me. 
The hills were littered with wineberries and blackberries. Thos had the dual effect of slowing me down and boosting my moral.
There was long stretch with big puddles on the trail that had to be walked around. I managed to not get my feet wet.
I passed a pond full of Lilly pads, a rather unusual sight for this part of the country, and met an elderly couple that asked me to take their picture. When I told them I'd been out for three months the old man looked at me like I was insane and backed away slowly. 
The trail goes right into town then turns right to cross the Deleware. I turned left in search of food and found Issac. He sat out in front of an Italian restaurant sharpening a large knife with a honing steel. He said he got the knife at the yard sale in Wind Gap but the edge was dull. I told him it was probably used to chip out too many teeth. 
We talked for a while more, and I got a Stromboli. I was planning on getting the $5 apple pie and hot dog special at the farmers market, but plans are for tourists and liars. Stromboli it is. 
I asked Issac how long he was going to stay out here and he said he had no clue. I loved that answer. Here's a kid that just wants to venture off into the wilderness and return humbled at an unspecified date. He's gonna be alright.
Issac left and Weatherman came by. I asked him for the news.
I've been calling it ""the news"". Anytime you meet another thru hiker it's become habit to fund out what they know about the other hikers, specifically where they all are. This way, we all keep track of our friends and foes and know who's around us. 
It turns out that Weatherman filled the void that Jill and I left in our first hiking group, joining in with the group in the Smokies after Gatlinburg. He happily reported that Bushwack, Honeybadger, Otter, and Popsicle were still in the trail and only a few days behind me. 
I told him what news I had and he went in his way. It occurred to me after he left that I forgot to ask about Sourdough. Where was that cackling mad genius? That absurd fellow who's good mood and positive energy proceeds him everywhere he goes? I do miss the feeling of having my spirits suddenly lifted and good moods suddenly strike and knowing that Sourdough must be close. Where was that woolen clad monk? No answer would surprise me.
I got a small resupply at a gas station and headed out. The trail immediately crossed the Deleware on a long bridge. It was a toll bridge so all the dummies that drive their cars there had to pay to drive across, while I got to walk it for free. The toll plaza even had a visitors center for some reason.
In the middle of the bridge I could see the state boundary, painted in colors that made it resemble the national flag of India for some reason (??????) (Why is this town so weird?). I strolled across into New Jersey and let out a victory screech. The halfway state, where I was born and raised, was behind me. 
That crossing felt good. Not just because I was so tired of the rocks, but because that made me feel like I was really getting somewhere now. I had walked all the way home and kept going. I was past that now, no more looking ahead and seeing a stop at my parents house. Now when I look ahead I only see Katahdin. 
Katahdin and a climb out of this place, I should say. I feared a steep clamber up a rocky hillside, instead I was given a gentle and well graded ascent with few rocky sections. It was bliss to my feet. I saw a mother doe and two fawns walk right in front of me, paying me no mind.
Next the trail came to Sunfish Pond, a glacial lake where swimming was strictly prohibited. I wouldn't call what I was doing swimming, it was closer to bathing really. And in my defense, I desperately needed it.
Blueberries and Bear feces, that's what lines the trail in New Jersey. An alarming amount of both, there's probably a connection there. 
Near the top of Raccon Ridge I heard something run in the grass. I looked closely and saw a bird running from me. Instinctively I chased it. It ducked under leaves and was remarkably good at hiding. I used my trekking poles and got a better look at it and soon determined that it was a juvenile grouse. I don't know if it was supposed to be away from its mother yet or not, but either way I wanted to try and catch it before letting it go. Once I caught a wild turkey with my bare hands and took it back to show my dad while we were camping in upstate PA, I've never seen him laugh so hard in my life. Another time he caught a pheasant and it bite him in the hand so hard it left a scar. You might say catching birds is a family tradition, but this little guy was elusive. ""Well done sir, you've outsmarted me,"" I said and left the little guy alone after a daring chase.
I hiked on until thunder and a few drops of rain led me to set up quickly next to a tent, who it's occupant is I do not know.","Kirkridge Shelter

Mile 1307.5 to Brink Road Shelter 
I never met my camping partner from last night. They stayed over in their tent and that was that, still set up and inside when I left in the morning. 
2fer came by and I hiked with her for the morning until we got to some trail magic. Some nice older folks made me a cheeseburger and a hot dog and I drank a coca cola and a beer. One of the guys doing magic mentioned that he'd been to India and that sparked a long talk about world travel. 
I went past a big beaver pond after that. New Jersey has some really interesting swamps, another new landscape I haven't seen. 
It was another foggy day with a wet ground. My right foot has been sore, and my pinky toe hurts with each step whenever it's wet. The result is a lot of limping through the pain on days like this. 
On my other foot, what I assume is a spider bite hasn't gone away at all. It's red and swollen but is able to be ignored unless I start itching it, then it becomes unbearable.
I intended to push on past Branchville but ended up stopping at Brink Road instead. The shelter has a healthy population of mosquitoes and I had to put on my puffy and slip my legs into my pack liner while I cooked. Mozzies are an annoying creature at best, and there's apparently West Nile in New York so I'll do my best to keep them off of me. 
There's some people yelling and screaming at eachother up the trail from me. I can't hear what they're saying but they sound very unhappy with one another. Oh well, that's probably keeping the bears away.
Rocky and Switz texted me today and said they want to catch back up with me. I also talked to Bear Girl yesterday and she said Rooster has slowed her down so much they've had to flip flop, and they were doing Katahdin today. 
There's nothing wrong with flip flopping, a lot of people do the trail this way, either out of pleasure or necessity, but for me this thing ends at Katahdin, not Harper's Ferry or some random road crossing in the middle. Katahdin gives you that epic finish, saves the hardest parts for last, and gives you a mountaintop to scream off of. That's what I want my thru hike to be, but best of luck to everyone who does it any other way, hike your hike as they say. ","Mile 1307.5

Brink Road Shelter to Deckertown Turnpike 
I hiked out of the shelter and away from those mosquitoes along some beauty open, grassy ridges.
I went down to the Sandwich Lobby, a quaint little sandwich shop right along the trail that offers a hiker discount and has a water spigot. Unbeknownst to me, when I paid for my soda and Hawaiian cheeseburger I left my credit card in the slot. That's twice I lost it on trail so far.
Just up the trail from that was a sign promising trail magic for the entire month of July. I found the man sitting in the parking lot with whatever food or drink you could ever desire. He even had a portable freezer full of ice cream. 
Moose was the guy's name. He was a girlscout troop leader, a hot air balloon enthusiast and pilot, a chemist, and a longtime trail angel. Every year he came out and set up for an entire month. He told me he got his name after a battle with a moose that he had walked into and defeated by throwing a jacket over its head and escaping. He also explained to me how to steer a hot air balloon. Fascinating subjects. 
I left Moose and hiked over the ridge and found more trail magic up on top. A lady who had just survived a battle with cancer and was spending her days feeding watermelons to hikers. I ate a few slices, thanked her, and went on my way. 
I was pushing to Deckertown Turnpike. I had a friend coming through the area to pick me up for the night. 
All the streams have been brown and yellow. I've seen this before in Northern Michigan, when the tree sap runs into the water and changes the color. I'm really hoping that's what's happening here. Even after filtering, the water remains suspiciously yellow. 
I found Marsha near the road and we left the trail and I got to spend a night in a room with fine company and all the amenities of non hiker life. ","Brink Road Shelter

Deckertown Turnpike to Pochuck Mountain Shelter 
Marsha took me to recover my missing credit card from the Sandwhich Lobby, then took me for a resupply and dropped me back off on trail. I thanked her for all her help (especially fir recovering my card) and watched her go on her way. She's I'm the process of moving to New Hampshire for the rest of the summer.
I felt well rested and in a good mood. I just about ran the first couple miles. The trail was a bit rocky, then just hilly, then borderline flat. 
Swamp. That's been a new ecosystem that has been absent until now. The low parts of New Jersey are covered in swamps of all sorts. 
The trail is kept dry by wooden planks where they are needed. After all the rocky uneven footing in PA the planks are a welcome bit if relief for my feet. 
I found a few cans of Arizona tea set out on the trail as trail magic and took one and drank it at the park HQ for Highpoint State Park. I could see the state high point for New Jersey just ahead of me, but that would have require leaving the trail and I was trying to make up some miles. 
I found a cooler with some cheese in it and ate a few slices. Then I got to a creek and filled up, but then read on guthooks that the creek flowed through cow pastures and might be contaminated. I carried the bottle as long as I could but soon had to start drinking from it. 
I saw a sign for the ""secret"" Shelter, an unofficial Shelter built privately on someone's property, and thought there might be water there. I arrived and found a few section hikers, an old man, and a donkey. The donkey's name was Jake, and he loved me. He reminded me of a dog, the way he ran up to me and stuck his head in my arms, demanding I stratch behind his ears, which I happily did. 
The shelter had two spigots, but they were both turned off. I patted Jake a few more times then headed out through the swampy lowlands. 
There was a long roadwalk after that where a few people offered me rides, but I turned them all down, saying I was in trail and had to walk this section. 
I passed over the Wallkill River and then went out across the wetlands of the Wallkill National Wildlife Refuge as the sun was starting to set. I had been listening to music but I took my earbuds out here to enjoy the peace and serenity of that absolute orgy of bird calls. 
The wetlands and the pink sun and the birds all combined to give the place an exotic feel, I half felt like I was back in Chitwan tracking tigers and rhinos. A deer jumped out in front of me, then a few rabbits sat and watched me pass. Friendly creatures in a serene place. I watched the sun shine off the swampy water then turned and followed the trail north. 
At this point it turned back into the woods (more accurately described at a jungle here) and I walked across a particularly long stretch of wooden boards. I was still zenned out from the Wildlife Refuge and so I was waltzing along happily, whistling and humming to myself when I heard a noise and saw a bear pop it's head up right in front of me. 
The surprise of it threw me off balance and I lost my footing on the boards and fell off, one foot plunging in the water and mud below, shouting and swearing and trying to regain my footing and composure. The bear looked terrified and tried to turn and run but tripped into some bushes and soon had to settle for climbing halfway up a tree. I turned back with my wet foot and backed away as the little bear stared at me from the tree. It looked small enough to be a second year cub, so I thought it best to back away before it's mother showed herself. 
I stood on the planks for some time, hoping someone would come up and walk through this part with me. Noone came but the mosquitoes. They had an absolute feast on me and I decided it was no good hanging out here and getting West Nile so I started banging my poles on the planks and calling out to the bears. I made it to the end without seeing it again. That makes 14 bears if anyone's keeping track. 
I filled up my water at a well known abandoned house where the outdoor spigot still works. The place had a strong murdery vibe but beggars can't be choosers. 
With two full bottles I strolled up the mountain into camp. ","Deckertown Turnpike

Pochuck Mountain Shelter to Wawayanda Shelter
Humidity was particularly brutal today. I couldn't get enough water into me all day.
A trail maintainer came to the shelter this morning with a new log book, I got to sign the first line of the first page. My message proclaimed that very obvious information.
The trail was rugged by New Jersey standards going out of the shelter. Lots of steep rocky climbs.
After descending a hill and eating an alarming amount of wineberries I found Skydragon sitting near a road crossing. Skydragon hosts a podcast, is a published author, will soon be featured on a show on PBS and most importantly is a thru hiker. She's an interesting person and I've been wanting to speak with her, so I sat down next to her and talked about whatever she wanted to bring up. 
While we were sitting and talking, some day hikers noticed us and came back with handfuls of fresh fruit. I was handed an apple, a mango, and a nectarine. I pulled out my knife and cut up the mango, it was a look.
After that road crossing came a mile long boardwalk. A nice break for my aching feet. (It occurs to me that I did the ""Rocksylvania"" section on a brand new pair of shoes, I wonder if that's what killed my feet, I'm suddenly covered in blisters as bad as my first week and having a consistent ache in my right foot on top of that, maybe my body's just giving out and ill be found dead on the side if the trail, oh well, Katahdin if it kills me). I walked across the boardwalk and at the other side found a sign warning people not get hit by trains, some train tracks, another sign warning people not to get trampled by cows, a cow pasture, and then a sign warning people not to get hit by cars, and a road.
A farm that supposedly sold milkshakes was just up the road, but I never made it there. Instead I was lured away by a hot dog salesman. I bought two hot dogs and a birch beer. 
After giving me two particularly good hot dogs the hot dog man lit a cigarette, blared some 60s psychedelic rock, and laid out in the sun, smoking and ignoring the world around him. He was a grumpy old bastard, in a good way. He was the sort to grill and grunt through his sentences, not bother to smile or pretend to be happy to see you, but none the less call you ""brother"" and make sure you got a good hot dog. When someone walked by and shouted hello and waved, I waved back but the hot dog man ignored him, watching him pass by and smoking his cigarette indifferently. I think we need more grumpy old bastards in the world today. Here is honesty, what you see is what you get, no frills or fake courtesy, just an honest man. If he's in a bad mood, he won't care if you know it. Sure I like friendly people, but give me honest grumps over fake niceties any day. Be a smoking hot dog man sometimes, we've all earned it.
The next part of the trail I'm told is nicknamed ""Stairway to Heaven"" (along with every other incline or set of stairs in the country). It's easily the hardest climb in New Jersey. I clambered up the near vertical face and tried not to die on the rocks, which were out in Pennsylvanian force, and struggled to drink more then I was sweating. A quick thunderstorm rolled over me at the top, giving me a much needed jolt of cold wind but no rain. 
At the next road crossing were two coolers full of ice and sodas and cheese. New Jersey has been a motherload of trail magic. It seems that every other crossing has some coolers or a guy cooking cheeseburgers or at least some drinks set out. I see you New Jersey, I don't care what they say about you. I'm impressed.
Because there's such a ridiculous bear population here, I don't want to camp alone. The shelters are spaced horribly here, so I ended up calling it at 12 miles today, giving my feet a break. I'll try to get an early start tomorrow and make up some time, I'll never catch Jill and Morgan at this pace. 
I spent the night eating dinner with a ridge runner. He's halfway through Lord of the Rings and I just finished the latest Song of Ice and Fire book, so we talked about fantasy novels until the mosquitoes drive us to our tents and hammocks.
I'm covered in mosquitoe bites. The only way I can stand to even cook supper is to put on my jacket, put up my hood, and slip my legs into my pack liner. It's unbearably hot, but better then being a mozzy feast.Wawayanda Forever!!!!","Pochuck Mountain Shelter

Rock ledges, heat, ice cream, mosquitoes, climbing, clamoring, internal strife, sore feet, sweat. The hallmarks of any thru hike, certainly the defining features of today.
I woke up early just like I said I would. I even set an alarm, which I swore I wouldn't do on trail. Waking up to my old alarm tone was oddly nostalgic, I'd have to admit. I have a strange relationship with mornings. I love them, uts by far my favorite time of day. The lights still dim and not overpowering, the people are either in a good mood or too tired to let you know they aren't, it's cool. I like sitting in the early morning and watching everything slowly come to life. That said, I loathe waking up in the morning. I've always struggled to sleep, I've never once woken up and felt well rested and ready to greet the day. It's more like a slow reluctant drag myself out of bed. I do love the morning though once I am up.
I breathed that crisp morning air and walked the ridge out to the state line. Another state is in the books, goodbye New Jersey, hello New York, may you triumph over New Lancaster.
I was going for bigger miles today, that's why I got up so early. For one thing, I'm still behind the group, for another I'm basically out of food and fuel and I'll have a serious problem if I can't get up to get some by tomorrow. The trail provides, I tell myself. Something will come along.
People have been a rare sight lately. I must be in between the bubbles, everyone has simply vanished. I don't think I saw any other hiker trash all day today. 
I found a local place that was making homemade ice cream and got a dish of the flavor they called ""Great White Way"" which seems mildly racist but sounded like the best flavor. It was really good for what it'd worth.
I popped two aspirins this morning to help my feet make it through, they're feeling rougher every day. But that's the trail for you, making things hard on you (welcome to the Salty Spittoon, how tough are ya? 
How tough am I? I thru hiked the Appalachian Trail!) 
On multiple occasions I had to put away my.poles and lift myself up with my hands. All day I was warned about severe thunderstorms coming in. Between those and my aching feet and legs and the low food I decided to get a room for the night.
I hitched into town and got picked up by a guy from Brooklyn. Now, I've known a lot of people in my life. I have lived and worked with people from every continent, people who English is there second or third language, and have never had a problem understanding accents and communicating, but I could not understand a word this guy was saying. About the only thing I could puzzle out was a story about him going to jail and somehow getting paid for it. That's two hitches in a row now that brought up jail.","Wawayanda Shelter

A zero was apparently all I needed. My legs and feet didn't hurt anymore, my blisters had turned into calluses, my spirits were right back up where they belonged, all was well.
I got picked up by the first car to drive by who took me right to the trailhead and I was off, passing people as I went. 
Ripper and Captain Hook told me that there was trail magic ahead, but they told me on a steep incline so they were too out of breath to explain any of the details. 
The downward section was called ""Agony Grind"", like seriously, that was its actual name. It was a nearly vertical hillside full of loose boulders and slick rocks. I ran into Tinder, Rock, and Roots on the way down. Roots lifted up her shorts and showed me her asscheek, which was skinned and bloody from a fall. Then Tinder lost her footing and fell over but her backpack caught on a rock and saved her from tumbling down the mountain. My foot went out from under me once or twice but I stayed upright. Descending this hill in the rain would be suicidal.
Down at the bottom the trail magic turned out to be Rippers parents, who drive here all the way from Iowa to see him and feed us walking tacos. I haven't seen walking tacos for trail magic yet, good thinking Mr. and Mrs. Ripper, you guys are our hearts and souls, I'm gonna miss them.
The Lemon Squeezer was the next big obstacle. I went through the narrow slot without taking my pack off, although I did have to throw my poles out ahead of me and use my hands to climb through the narrow rocks. Next was a sheer cliff that had to be climbed. I was certain I had made a mistake but then I saw the blaze, right on top, this was the trail. 
I threw my poles to the top and tired to climb up but couldn't find a foothold. I got ahold of a tree that was growing on the edge and pulled myself, pack and all, up with just my arms. When I got to the top I laid back for a second and looked down over. I don't think I could climb down that, it's a good thing I'm not a southbounder. There's a way around it, of course, but that wouldn't be the trail and therefore it's out of the question. 
After that it was a lot of rocky ridges lined with blueberries. There are an absurd amount of blueberries, litterally thousands lined the trail. I can grab a handful whenever I want. I don't even stop to look at then anymore. They are delicious, of course, but if I stopped at every Bush I would litterally not even be moving anymore. Blueberries and huckleberries are sure to become a staple of my diet.
From the top of one mountain I looked down and saw a huge river that could only be the Hudson. I looked out through the afternoon haze and picked out the skyline of Manhattan in the distance. Jill and Morgan would be headed to New York City any day now, but I hadn't managed to catch up to them. They'll have to go without me, much as I hate to miss it. Maybe I'll go to New York after the trail.
West Mountain Shelter was probably a half mile off trail. This is the single best view I've had from a shelter though, so it was well worth it. The shelter sits at the edge of a rock outcropping and looks over the Hudson and toward the city. 
I sat and ate in the shelter with two day hikers from South Jersey. They both packed out glass bottles of Coca-Cola. One finished his and blew in the bottle, sounding a low note. The other, who had some coke left in his bottle, sounded a different note. They figured out that they could play the Jaws theme, which set the entire shelter to laughing and applauding. 
I talked to the both if them quite a bit. They were friends out together on their first backpacking trip, both were musicians and both were outgoing and friendly. We all wrote a bad poem in the shelter log. 
Jake, the younger day hiker, told me that people were his favorite thing about backpacking, as contradictory as that may sound.
We watched the bats fly and the lights come on below as the sun set and the moon took its place in the sky. It was a good day. I am happy to be out here. 
Also, this shelter sits at exactly the 1400 mile mark. That's pretty neat.","Orange Turnpike

West Mountain Shelter to Fransiscan Way
I woke up this morning to find the view obscured by a dark and ominous haze. I've seen this before, no blue in the sky, a bright red sun, a heavy feeling in the air. This was wildfire smoke. 
Sure enough, the entire western half of the country is on fire. It's so bad the smoke is actually reaching us here in New York. The world is burning it would seem, what else is new?
I ate blueberries and huckleberries for breakfast (I prefer the blueberries myself, huckleberries just make me think of tourists in the Rockies where we sell Huckleberry flavored anything you want and they all buy it up like it cures covid). 
The trail went down, and the trail went back up again, this time to the top of Bear Mountain, then vack down again to Bear Mountain State Park. This park is the lowest point on the entire trail. I guess it's all uphill from here.
The trail wrapped around Hessian Lake then past a pool (tempting) and through a zoo. The bobcat and fox were napping hard, the weasel had the day off (seriously, the weasel gets a day off, go read the sign I'm not even joking) and the bear was hiding from an invasion of turkey vultures in his pen. 
Does that bear count as bear number 15? I'm counting him, why not. 15 bears. 
After the zoo, the trail crosses the Hudson on a massive suspension bridge, guarded on each entrance by signs reminding people that life is worth living. 
Then the trail goes up, and down, and up again. I stopped at some massive Jesus retreat with dozens of statues and an absurdly large main building. I joked that I was going to hang my hammock off Jesus's staues right arm, but figured they may frown upon that. These people do let thru hikers stay for free, so they are friends as far as I'm concerned. ","West Mountain Shelter

Franciscan Way to Canopus Lake Beach 
First thing this morning I saw two hikers go by me. I yelled out my greetings to them. The first responded, a male, and kept on walking but then the second, a lady, threw me off. A very distinct Midwestern accent, the kind of voice that is sharp and unique and you'd know it anywhere.
""Otter?"" I asked as they walked on. Both of them stopped. I was right, it was Otter, and the newly bearded and scruffy fellow was none other then Popsicle. The hot rock in the sock duo, the firemasters of the Smokies and part of what is still one of my favorite safety meetings were back at last. Otter and Popsicle live and they are still pushing on. They told me about a thru hiker site at a beach in 14 miles and I decided to camp there, first because there was really nowhere else to go, but also to catch up with them. 
I met a lady who looked like she was about to fall over dead. She exclaimed that the trail ""just keeps going on and on"" and I had to wonder exactly what she was expecting it to do. This poor lady just started hiking yesterday and did 20 miles and is trying for 14 today and I really hope she doesn't die.
I met a fellow named Connor at a road crossing who was giving out string cheese and interviewing thru hikers for a documentary he hopes to sell to Outside (that's a website and magazine for those of you who don't read Krakauer). I had just finished chugging two cans of Mountain Dew and a few chocolate bars and was feeling absolutely jacked, so I gave a ridiculously overhyped, practically screaming interview that included me singing the CatDog theme song. I sure hope it makes it to the documentary, I'd love that to be the first the world sees of me. He also asked what inspired me to wear the kilt and was left speechless when I gave the candid answer of ""my balls were sweaty"".
The trail went on a bit further along what looked to be an old stone wall in the woods and passed a revolutionary war smallpox inoculation site. 
The last mile was along the lake and ended with me fighting off a hoard of geese with my poles (no geese were harmed in the making of this journal).
The beautiful lakeside campsite was more of a beautiful non lakeside patch of grass and I sat with Otter, Popsicle, and my dad who came out for one last surprise visit. 
We caught up quite a bit. The entire group from the Smokies is still on trail, which is no small feat. Statistically, they should have thinned out, but we really did have a group of finishers in those cold mountains. The only one neither of us can account for is Sourdough, though we'd never cut him out. He'll either show up on Katahdin in someone else's clothes with no explanation why or show up in the news in five years as a self made billionaire or leader of some third world country or something along those lines. It's in the man's nature. 
Today I found myself looking at my shoes and thinking how much longer I have to go to keep myself at four pairs of shoes instead of five. The answer is not much longer. It was an oddly exhilarating thought, just thinking about having one more pair of shoes to go. 
I'm less then 750 miles from the end, which may seem like a lot, but it's going to go fast. I am, to use a very appropriate phrase, not out of the woods yet by any means, but I'm far enough along that the end is starting to seem tangible. It's becoming a real thing. In two or three days I'll be put of New York, and out of the Mid-Atlantic region, leaving only New England. I'm honestly a bit nervous about the end, like I won't know what to do with myself anymore. But I'm getting ahead of myself. There's still a lot left to get through, and success is not guaranteed by any means. Now is the time to stay sharp and make sure I make Katahdin, and most of all to enjoy it, every damn step of it. ","Fransiscan Way

Canopus Lake Beach to Morgan Stewart Shelter
The smoke is pretty much gone, I'm happy to report.
I said bye to Otter and Popsicle and took off on a relatively easy and uneventful day. Lots of easy hiking, lots of various kinds of berries, lots of the usual. 
Dad drove me to a deli for a sandwich before he had to go back home, I've discovered that I love delis. Especially New York delis, the kind with homemade sauces and wildly good sandwiches. These people have mastered the art of sandwhiching. I've also come to realize that New Yorkers are extremely talkative and friendly. You say anything to a New Yorker and they will talk to you for hours, I love it. 
I got to the shelter pretty early and set up and laid back for a bit. When I stood up I heard even more familiar voices and, being on the great AT reunion tour, saw Honeybadger and Amazon cooking dinner together. Honeybadger has recently made friends with a wild bobcat while Amazon has been suffering from a terrible rash, but most importantly they're still hiking, still pushing on. They also have no idea where Sourdough is. I've made it my mission to find out. 
We talked for a while, we shared our news, and we all went to bed when the mosquitoes got too bad. ","Canopus Lake Beach

Morgan Stewart Shelter to Ten Mile River
I woke up and went down for water. It was a new setup, something I hadn't seen before on trail, an old metal hand pump.
I grabbed the handle, which was nearly above my head at its highest point, and slammed it down. It made a loud creaking noise with a dull, metallic clank when it hit its bottom, then another creak and a different metal clank at the top. The sounds were satisfying, but no water came. I grabbed the handle and pumped away at it, filling the air with that sweet sound of olde tymey machinery. After a minute or two, water trickled out of the nozzle. Another minute of intense pumping and water was flowing freely, filling up the half a water just that served as a bucket there. I filled my filter and then filled the bucket up for the next guy.
I finished both the audiobooks I was listening to yesterday and went to download another. Despite my extensive collection of books that I've never read or listened to, I decided to go back to an old favorite, and downloaded ""Seven Years in Tibet"". The first time I ever read that book was three years ago hiking with Creech and Corey in a town called Manang. When we got into town after a long and hard day on the trail I came down with some sort of flu and couldn't go on. Not wanting to hold my friends up, I encouraged them to go on and I would take a shortcut to Yak Kharka and meet them there. In a day or two I was feeling good enough to wake around town again but not quite ready to hike out, so I went to a store in search of cold medicine and found that they were selling copies of the book, in fact it was the only book they had in English. I bought it and fell in love with it, devouring the first half the day I bought it (I'm generally a slow reader so that's a lot for me). When I recovered I hiked up to Yak Kharka as planned and waited there, reading and waiting for Creech and Corey. I soon discovered to my dismay that the book I had was a misprint, the final 50 pages or so were not the end of the book, but the beginning. I was just starting to scowl at the fact that I wouldn't be able to read the end of the book after finding it so engrossing when another hiker sat down next to me and proudly proclaimed that he was reading the same book. He said that he was out here hiking with his two best friends but had come down with a terrible flu in Manang and, not wanting to hold up his friends, told them to hike on and he would take a shortcut to Yak Kharka once he recovered and he found the book in the store while looking for medicines and bought it to pass the time. I told him that that was litterally and to the word exactly what had happened to me and brought me here. We both had loud, bellowing laughs and the sound filled the little stone teahouse we were in. When I told him that my book was a misprint and didn't have the ending he pulled out his copy, checked the final pages, then handed it over to me and said enjoy the ending, he had a copy at home in Germany. Even on other trails, the trail provides. When Creech and Corey caught up to me I gave each of them a copy and warned them they'd have to share one book when they got to the end.
Creech and Corey, I miss those bastards. I got my phone out, put it on speaker, and called Corey's phone. Just my luck, the two of them were hanging out together on the couch and threw me on speaker phone. We talked for over two hours while I hiked today, wonderful way to pass the time. I had a million trail stories (as anyone reading this journal should know) and they had a million for me in turn. They both are staying in Jackson Hole for the winter and making an absurd amount of money there, and they are trying their best to talk me into coming out with them. It's tempting, I must admit. I'm lucky to have such a bond with my two best friends. There aren't many people in the world that bounch off eachother the way we do, when one finds something, the others go along. It's a special bond, I don't know where I would be without those two. 
The trail climbed up and came to Nuclear Lake, which was ""formerly"" contaminated by plutonium after an accident in the area but has now been ""decontamined"" of those radioactive metals. I decided against swimming there.
The trail crossed a large swamp (MY swamp!) and came out next to a place called ""Native Landscaping"". I've heard about this place being hiker friendly, so I went in and was shown a place to dump my trash, fill my water bottle and they even had an outdoor shower head with hot water. I think the idea behind the shower head was more to be a rinse off since it was outside and in the middle of their gardening section, but there weren't many people shopping so I took a full on shower. I'll guarantee I'm not the first one to be naked in the gardening section. The water was hot and refreshing, I felt like a whole new person after that. It's incredible how big a difference a shower can make. 
After thanking the guy who fortunately didn't notice me showering, I went back out and climbed over another ridge. At the end of that one I found a few coolers full of cold drinks and snacks, trail magic at its finest. I decided to have supper there but the mosquitoes were going crazy. I put up my hammock quick and cooked from inside that, drinking soda and eating fruit snacks while the food cooked. 
Just as I was leaving the lady who put those coolers out showed up to collect them and I got the chance to say thank you to her. 
I passed the Willey Shelter which had a full collection of The Lord of the Rings books and The Hobbit. I almost stopped and set up there just to read, but decided that Tolkien would have to wait, I was on my own quest. I made it down to the road where a guy named Einstein handed me a beer and said ""welcome to Connecticut.""
I pulled out my headlamp and crossed the last mountain of the day in the dark, setting up at last next to Ten Mile River near the shelter.","Morgan Stewart Shelter

Ten Mile River to Mile 1474.5
At some point this morning I passed the 2/3 mark. I'm going places.
I walked through a covered bridge into a little town with a convenience store that was loaded up with hikers. We all talked and joked outside while we feasted on the peculiar delicacies that are microwaveable breakfast sandwiches.
They are odd because when you need them, and when you can find them you usually need them, they are delicious, but any other time they are going to be terrible, I think. But when you have them, when you are desperate enough to eat them, you'll never taste anything better.
Someone pulled in and shouted ""Mikey!"" and we all looked around wondering which one of us was Mikey. I have known all of these people for months, but I have no clue which one is Mikey. Hydro ended up being Mikey, as he hopped in the car of whoever was picking him up the rest of us started shouting ""no! I'm Mikey! Take me! I'll be your Mikey!! Pick me!!""
With a full stomach I went on, slowly at first, slowly later as well, and finally, slowly. Progress was downright abysmal today. 
I saw two hikers coming toward me and I stepped aside. They didn't have the look of regular hikers. They were scruffy, looking beat but happy. I looked at their legs and saw immediately, they were thru hikers, but they were going the wrong way.
""Are you guys southbounders?"" I asked.
""Yep!"" They replied. So they do exist.
I went swimming and finally called it a day on the side if a cliff, with massive difficulty and inconvenience while setting up camp. This is undoubtedly the most inconvenient and dangerous spot I'll have the entire trip.","Ten Mile River

Mile 1474.5 to Pine Swamp Brook Shelter 
Last night, after journaling, I looked up at the sky and thought it looked slightly ominous. Since I was set up on the side of a litteral cliff I hadn't set up my tarp was just hoping it wouldn't rain. I checked the weather and saw that it was to rain all night. I cursed myself for choosing this completely ridiculous camping spot and set about trying to set up a tarp while clutching a cliff naked in the dark. 
Since there was no dirt to put stakes in, I just draped it over my hammock and tied the ropes together. The result was a sauna. My shoes and pack were outside, 20 yards back on some flat ground, they would get wet but that couldn't be helped.
Don't camp on cliffs kids, it's a terrible idea.
Packing up camp in the morning was a whole nother adventure, with the cliff now being wet and slippery. It's a miracle I didn't die.
Descending was a pain as well but that was followed up by miles of flat trail along a river. The only thing that are it a challenge was the mosquitoes, but I could outpace them on the flat ground.
The trail climbed up a particularly lovely peak, Pine Knob. The slopes were flowing with rushing cascades on every side everywhere I looked and the top was covered in a thick grove of pines. The air smelled sweet and piney, it smelled like the west, like home. I drank it in as I enjoyed the views.
My phone being almost dead, I called a lady in Salisbury that takes in hikers. She is quite old and has a hard time hearing, I struggled to make myself understood. After about five minutes of shouting I'm honestly not sure if I have a room reserved or not. I'll find out tomorrow night when I get to Salisbury. Mad respect to her though for still helping out the community being as old as she is.
Last night I told Marsha that I was unsure if we should be together, and today I got to listen to a thousand screaming voices in my head. Some were saying that I was right, that all I was going to end up doing was hurting her and wasting her time, others were telling me I was a moron and should run back and beg forgiveness because I had finally found someone willing to put up with me. All agreed, it's hard to know what to do when you actually care about someone. 
I may not have to worry about it anyway because these mosquitoes may be enough to kill me. They are swarming, I had to eat supper in my hammock tonight. Even now, they line my bug net and swarm the outside.","Mile 1474.5

Pine Swamp Brook Shelter to Riga Shelter 
Last night I again insisted on sleeping without my tarp. I'm not sure if it rained or if it was just a heavy, misty fog, but things got wet. 
I was woken up at three am by a drop of water to the face off of the trees above. It kept coming, drop after drop. I couldn't be bothered with it so I just threw my quilt up over my head and pretended it wasn't there. This utter refusal to beleive that rain happens is becoming a problem.
I set an alarm, begrudgingly, for 6 am so that I could get some miles in. Sure enough, at 6 am my phone rang out om mani padma hom and I woke up and packed up my damp hammock.
The fog didn't lift for the first hour, the trail was clearly in the mood to be all mysterious. Things are changing, it's subtle but it's there. There are more clusters of pine, especially on the tops. The climbs are steeper and rockier, the streams are bigger and more frequent, the hills are growing. New England is taking on its own charecter now, distinctly different from the Mid Atlantic states. 
The pine groves have me wondering if I'm not reaching altitudes and latitudes sufficient to begin poking into subalpine environments, this is a prospect I find more exciting then I probably should.
The trail went down off the mountain and into a nice flag valley along the Housatonic River. The interesting thing about the Hula Satan River is that a long stretch along it was actually made wheelchair accessible, so everyone can enjoy the natural beauty of the Hoobastank River. In fact, the Houston Tonic River was the very first part of the trail to be given this designation. You go House Santana.
After filling my bottle from the hose at the Hail Saint Nick Agricultural School (ok I'm done with the river jokes now) and then kept walking until I came to a power plant.
Next to the power plant was a small ivy covered shed with a spigot, a power outlet, and a showerhead, all very well hidden in the ivy. My phone was desperately low so I plugged it in and laid in the shade for an hour. The shower head had absolutely nothing around it to block people's gazes, and was in sight of several houses, a public road, a state park, a functional power plant, and of course the Appalachian Trail. None of this bothered me in the slightest, but still I decided to wait until just before I left to use the shower in case anyone called the cops.
When my phone was almost charged I packed up and took the most hiker trash shower yet. For all the people who saw, you're welcome. Clean, cooled off, and charged up, I walked on. I past Grest Falls, which is a great fall.
I was starving all day today and daydreaming about food the entire hiker. I was practically ravenous by the time I got to the summit of the next mountain and then I pushed hard to get to town. I almost missed the 1500 load out before me in ferns. 1500 miles, over 2/3 of the way there. How about that.
I made it to the road and got a quick hitch from a nice guy. I found Otter, Popsicle, and Amazon sitting outside the store eating. I went inside and, realizing suddenly that it was my four month anniversary (Jill texted me about it or else I might not have realized) I bought two containers of sushi and a bottle of Stewart's. I could have died happy in that moment.
Some guy seemed to be glaring at us so I waved at him as he drove off, he stopped the car and yelled at us but I yelled back ""be merry! Change the world! Live a happy life!"" and he drive off. Don't know what his problem was but kill it with kindness and fire.
Some other lady came up to us with a giant bag of change and said she was recreating some Greek tragedy and something and something and the loser gets change and then something else and we were completely lost but for some reason she gave us almost $70 in change and we bought ourselves beer and the group used it to get back to the trail (they, for reasons I did not ascertain, came from a road about ten miles up that wasn't hitchiker friendly, so they were hiring a shuttle). Popsicle brought up the coin shortage (apparently that's still a thing?) and I said this is probably why. Not one of us could figure out why we got this money but we couldn't see a better use for it then spending. 
A lady from the Salisbury tourism board took some pictures of us and I hiked back to the trail. It was a long steep ascent with my full bag of impractical foods (since I'm going to a town again tomorrow I bought all impractical things) but I managed and got to a beautiful overlook and then to the shelter where it was just me and a guy named Easy Rider. This is the most empty I've ever seen a shelter, I set up inside and Easy set up outside, it's just the two of us tonight.

Riga Shelter to Great Barrington 
I woke up at 6:30 and was so stirred by the view I actually stayed up. Some fog had gathered around the lakes below and now the sun was shining over the hills and reflecting off the fog and water. 
I said bye to Easy Rider and went on my way, up over Bear Mountain. At the top, I met a southbounder, she warned me of the upcoming mosquitoes and I told her where to find free showers. It is a good time talking with these people and sharing eachothers knowledge. Even if they are all going the wrong way.
Connecticut ended with a long river walk with a few nice waterfalls. River walks were kind of a defining feature of the state. There were great swimming holes but it was actually kind of cold this morning so I stayed out.
By the time I crossed into Massachusetts and onto the next climb it became unbearably hot. Halfway up I was sweating so bad I took my clothes off and naked hiked to the top, figuring no day hikers would be in there. I was low on water and actually hot and dehydrated enough to feel a bit ill. I filled up at the next spot and chugged water until I felt better. 
The trail turned into a long, high ridge walk then dropped over the other side. I ran into a few people and all of then talked about the mosquitoes as it they were suffering ptsd from walking through them. I had at least six miles to go and it sounded like those six would all be through an infestation.
They were intolerable. I actually ran almost two miles, with a literal horde chasing me. Any time o slowed down it was accompanied by lots of screaming and cursing. May those mosquitoes burn eternally.
Then the rain came. All day had been bright, clear and sunny. The rain came out of nowhere. One minute I was fighting mosquitoes and the next, it was pouring and shooting down lightning on me. 
The rain came down so hard it flooded the trail. Soon as it started I was in ankle deep water, my shoes hopelessly full. Then just as quick as it started, it gave way to sun and a double rainbow. 
My right footbbecanr unbearable in those last few miles. I don't know what's wrong with it. That is the foot I had some of my middle tie knuckle removed due to frostbite though, I wonder if that's connected. Either way it made walking impossible, I can to stop and massage the foot then limp to the road.
Then the mosquitoes were back out instantly. I'm not sure if mosquitoes vanish on the road because it's bad habitat for then or because the occasional car just kills enough of them. Either way I have a lot of admiration for people who drive cars just for all the mosquitoes they hit while they do it.
I got picked up by the third car, a nice fellow who works at the safety store (they have them in Mass!). He drove me to the community center, where hikers are allowed to camp for free.
I was just about to go into town when I saw Popsicle, Honeybadger, and Amazon walking the other way. I asked where they were staying, they said a hotel, so I asked to use their shower, and they said yes. It's good to have good friends.
I resupplied and, since they don't give you bags in this state, took the basket with me. Amazon was out on her rooms porch and saw me walk by. She burst out laughing and said ""Did you smuggle the basket?!","Riga Shelter

I slept great and woke up peacefully. I honestly wasn't entirely sure I was supposed to be camping there so I was glad to see that noone kicked me out.
For being the most mosquito infested town I've ever been to, it sure was difficult to find bug spray. The pursuit took up half my morning, I finally found some in a gas station.
A slow talking, stoned looking young man in a van drove me back to the AT. He said ""you smell like a football locker room man,"" as soon as I got in his van. Oddly enough, his name was Zach.
The mosquitoes are out with a vengeance in this state. I sprayed on my spray and for the first time on trail used my head net. Everyone in trail had one on today, it was just that bad. 
I called it a nero after six miles. I was tired and needed a rest. I set up in the shelter and had some lively talks with the hikers.

Tom Leonard Shelter to Upper Goose Pond Shelter 
Packing up today, I checked guthooks on my phone and the texts came rolling in. Turns out it's my birthday, who knew?
The mosquitoes didn't know, they might have had the decency to leave me alone if they had. I decided right away I wasn't dealing with them and put on my rain jacket and head net, then sprayed my legs down with bug spray. 
I've gained a new appreciation for road crossings. Every time I see a car, I like to think about the hundreds of mosquitoes it's continually plowing through. It's a beautiful image.
I saw some people hitching back to Great Barrington, fleeing from some ""bad thunderstorms"" that were apparently coming later on. No rain no Maine, I kept on walking unafraid.
I was given trail magic by some southbounders who warned me about the mud coming up, they said it was almost as bad as Vermont (everyone has horror stories about Vermont). I picked my way through the mud as best as I could, but soon had wet shoes and socks. Considering that I was on my last pair of dry socks, this was a bit of a blow but I kept on. 
I had no real plan today but saw that it was 21 miles to Upper Goose Pond Cabin and popped two Tylenol in case I went that far. I've noticed lately that it's incredible what Tylenol can do for you. Two in the morning could add ten miles to your day, it would seem. I took it any time I wanted to go over 18 miles.
Picking my way through the thick mud I soon came out to a road, and saw a sign that read AT Booth. Someone was selling eggs, soda, and candy. I had no cash but took a picture of their venmo, planning to pay them later for the candy. I love this level of trust. 
There was a field of brown jersey cows. Beautiful fellows, they all stared at me as I walked through there herd.
All day inwas irritated by a painful rash that's forming on my hips and upper thighs. I think it's from the heat and sweat where my kilt touches me, it's the only thing I generally don't remove when I'm hiking. It also severely needs washed.
Just as the rain started, I came to trail magic. Some dude under a huge umbrella was handing out beer and donuts, true American hero. I sat and talked with him for a while, and told him it was my birthday. He gave me an extra donut. 
I hiked most of the rest of the day without my kilt, trying to air out my rash. I just hoped I wouldn't run into anyone, which thankfully I didn't.
After 21 miles of mud, I came to the side trail for the cabin. Upper Goose Pond Shelter is a fully enclosed cabin, complete with a caretaker. I sat with the caretaker and her sister for a while and talked about Mormons of all things. 
I jumped in the lake (it's actually a very large lake and sells itself short by calling itself a pond) and washed off all the mud that coated my legs then went back up to cook dinner. 
I cooked outside but ate in the cabin. French Fry and Easy joined me and French Fry and I talked about school (remember we went to the same high school) and app the teachers we remember, especially Mr. Good who would get incredibly stoned and just wonder the halls all day. Easy gave me a hard seltzer that he packed out when he heard it was my birthday. The rain and lightning picked up and I sat inside until I got a break and then ran out into my hammock. ","Tom Leonard Shelter

Upper Goose Pond Cabin to Kay Wood Shelter 
First thing this morning, the cabins caretaker made everyone blueberry pancakes and coffee. There was even real maple syrup, none of that poser Log Cabin brand nonsense, real maple, tapped out a tree somewhere. 
The Cabin was the picture of paradise. A big red two story cabin with a bunk room up top and a living room with a fireplace and a full bookshelf on the bottom. There was no electricity, just a single gas light. Down below was the lake, stretching out in every direction and begging to be explored. There were even two canoes, free for anyone to use. 
It was tempting to stay. Easy and French Fry Noth said as soon as they got up they weren't leaving. For myself, I could have happily passed the winter at that cabin, maybe even longer. 
But I was feeling determined. Reluctantly, I slipped on my wet shoes and socks, signed the book, and walked out. We must not anchor here, no matter how sweet the waters, no matter the hospitality of our friends, we are permitted to receive but a little while, that's not exactly it but Walt Whitman said something like that in Song of the Open Road.
The torrential downpour last night (which flooded out everyone who slept in their tents) greatly expanded the puddles and mud spots on the trail. Now long stretches were buried under genuine ponds, creeks flowed freely down the trail, and long wallows and mud pits sat where once was the AT. 
Keeping your feet dry or your shins clean was a joke. Soon I was covered up to my knees in mud, my shoes went into water, clear or muddy, at least every fifteen minutes, and all I could do was laugh about it. 
The sound of running water even drowned out the sounds of the forest in places. There were entire streams running in places where there shouldn't have been streams. It was as if the Berkshires were going to be buried in some biblical flood. 
Wet feet tend to become sore feet, so I popped two more Tylenol and trudged on. The striking thing was that the change in climate had become so obvious now I could easily fool myself into thinking I was back out west again. For a while I swore I was on the Delacy Creek Trail, headed toward Shoshone Lake. The pines, the swamps, the scents, the remoteness, and most of all the chill in the air. Even when it's hot, you can still feel that slight northern bite up here. I missed that feeling, come back to me sweet cold air. 
I got to a road crossing with a sign directing me to ""The Cookie Lady"" and followed. Next to the trail was a pick your own blueberry farm. In the middle was a house and in front of the house was a picnic table with a homemade wooden box that read ""cookies"". I opened it up and sure enough, it was full of chocolate chip and blueberry cookies. 
I stared up at the old farm house and ate the hundreds of blueberry bushes all around, when a door opened and out stepped a lady named Ruth with a mason jar of homemade strawberry hibiscus lemonade in her hand. She handed me the lemonade and sat down with me. Apparently the Cookie Lady was the former owner of the farm. After moving in she saw some thru hikers on her property and went to kick them out, but then struck up a conversation with them and discovered she actually liked them. She made them cookies and invited them to sit on her porch. Soon she met more hikers and enjoyed their company as well, and made those people some cookies. Before anyone knew it, she had boxes of homemade cookies out every day for whoever was passing through. This fine woman sadly passed on last year and Ruth bought the farm and made it her mission to carry on the legacy. She now calls herself Cookie Lady 2.0. 
Ruth asked if I wanted to sleep under the plane in the airplane hanger. I said no then those words registered a little better and I said ""what?"". She took me out to the hanger and showed me an old airplane, from sometime in the 50s. She said it needs some work, but next year she wants to get it flying again. Underneath it, under each wing, was a mattress where Ruth let hikers sleep. She said if I wanted to stay I could earn my living by picking a few buckets of berries.
Once again, I was in paradise, but I hadn't gone far that day, and I wanted to push on. I could've happily stayed there, explored the farm, got a closer look at the plane (I did crawl in and sit at the controls, don't worry) and picked berries for days, but the trail calls. I thanked Ruth and went on, taking an extra cookie with me. 
More mud, more water, standing or otherwise. I hiked until I felt weak then I stopped and ate, then I hiked more. I did the last two miles in the dark, no easy feat on a good day but especially hard when hopping across ponds and rocks and water. I got to the shelter and was the only one there.","Upper Goose Pond Shelter

This morning, for the first time in a long time, it was cold. Genuinely cold, like not leave your sleeping bag, don't use your poles cold. It's hard to believe it's only July. It feels like autumn should be breaking and leaves should be changing. 
I put on all the clothes I had and made my way into town. There I went to a certain coffee shop and found Jill. 
I hadn't seen my petite yet fierce redheaded friend in five states, the longest we've been apart on trail. There was much news to tell. I related the stories of the boardwalk bear, the dead woman I resurrected, the jail lady, Squeak and her bagpipes, mentoring the younger hikers, the sketchy showers, the various New Yorkers and the great AT reunion tour.
Jill told me about her battles with snakes and her trip to the city. 
I took a shower at Jill's hotel then walked my way out to a laundry mat, where I wrapped myself in a towel and washed all my clothes. 
It was a long walked through town, up over a rodge and down the other side. Then through another town and up another ridge. My feet were hurting terribly today, it was tempting to just stop and set up, but I wanted to keep with Jill now that I had caught her, so I pressed on all the way to the shelter, arriving in the dark but finding it empty and setting up inside. All the Massachusetts shelters are built the same, with a roof that sticks out to form a porch, a loft up top, and four bunks on the bottom.
I set up with one strap hanging from an outside pile and the other diagonally to the top bunk on the other side. It covers me and it's quite comfortable. This is the third time I've done it.","Kay Wood Shelter

Mark Noeple Shelter to Williamstown 
Leaving the shelter, an old familiar sensation came over me, silence. For the last few states, the trail has been narrow, that is to say the trail has been a tiny strip of wild on the midst of sprawling development. Now at last it appears the trail is widening back out again. I can't hear a highway, or a lawnmower, o don't even hear an airplane. Gone is the urge to fill my ears with audiobooks or Celtic Punk to drown out the ambient sound of automated transportation, now I am satisfied to hear what is around me. Birds, leaves, wind, and silence in between.
A text from my mother told me that Gunner is on his way downhill. The cancer has spread to his heart and liver, and they would be keeping him as long as they could but when things get bad, they're going to have to put him down. The news, combined with the aches in my feet and legs which have been getting worse the past few days, told me I needed a zero.
I hated to take one since I had just finally caught up to Jill, but the body needs what it needs. I decided to go into Williamstown, but first I would have to criss Mt Greylock.
Greylock is the highest point in Massachusetts, and the changing environment is more obvious here then anywhere. This is subalpine, there is no doubt. 
At the top is a giant lookout tower and a parking lot for those of us who think you can see a mountain by driving to it's summit. The view was fantastic, looking out of the tower I could see the Catskills in New York, the mountains of Vermont and New Hampshire, and so much of what I had already crossed to the south. 
I befriended a young woman in a bdsm collar and a onesie that looked like that road map rug your first grade teacher probably had in her room. I went up to her to say I liked her onsie just as she was coming up to arrival to say she liked my kilt. Her best friend had just graduated (from college I assume) and they were up there taking pictures. She gave me a granola bar and said good luck. 
There was also a paraglider struggling with the erratic winds. His sail would fill, he would get excited and start pulling ropes and cords and look like he was just about to take off when the wind would stop and his sail would collapse back to the ground. He would hang his head in disappointment and wait to repeat the process. I was up there for almost an hour and he never made it off the ground.
I sat and ate lunch near the parking lot ( I always eat near the muggles on the off chance someone will take pity on me and give me food, it's not much, but it's not honest work either). Some little girl walked by me and immediately declared to her mom, ""it smells bad here! This mountain smells like socks!"". 
I laughed and wondered how I would smell if I hadn't showered and did laundry just yesterday. Is the hiker smell just so ingrained in me now that even showering can't get rid of it?
I made it into town and got picked up and taken to the Williamstown Motel. Nice place, looking forward to laying down and doing nothing. ","Mark Noeple Shelter

Leaving town was difficult. I could have laid and slept for another day or two even, but one zero was enough. It was time to move out, even if I was basically taking a nero today anyway. 
My Dads friend Andy lives up here and is meeting me tomorrow with my cold weather gear. It's a bit early maybe, but it's been getting colder, and his house was a good spot to mail everything. 
I climbed up and out of town, passed a bad weather bypass, which always signals a fun time coming up. It was a steep climb up the rocks all the way to a big wooden sign. 
""Welcome to Vermont"" it read. 
Vermont, I was down to the final three, three states and 600 miles to go. Of all the state crossing, this one hit me the hardest. I don't know why Vermont has always been some sort of significant border to me, but it feels like the gate to the end. The thru hike is slowly coming to an end. Slowly, but it's happening. I'm on my last full month, sooner rather then later this is all going to end, and if the trail doesn't kill me I'll live on. I took a step, was in Vermont, and never looked back. 
The Vermont border is also the southern terminus of another trail, The Long Trail, which runs the whole way through Vermont to the Canadian border. 
The shelter was full of Long Trail hikers, out for their first night, struggling to make their gear work, carrying 70 pound backpacks, and looking ahead excitedly to the adventure ahead.
I had to laugh. The scene was identical to the first days on trail, all those months ago in Georgia. ","Williamstown

Vermont is infamous for its mud, and I probably shouldn't say this, but so far it's not as bad as Massachusetts. 
I did pass a lot of beaver dams today, lots of chewed up trees and big wide ponds. I haven't seen an actual beaver yet though, hopefully that's in my future.
There were snakes everywhere. Little water snakes, probably not poisonous, at least I hope not. Amazon caught me harassing one off a plank with my pole and gave a chuckle and a ""whatcha doing there?""
I met my Dad's friend Andy, who lives up this way and was kind enough to bring me my winter gear. It's that time of year, or rather that part of trail. The nights are getting colder, I need my liner and my warm pants again. 
Andy is a retired firefighter with a wife and two young kids. He drove me out to a general store where I bought a sandwhich and we split a four pack of a strong IPA. I was honestly hammered by the time we were done, and have no idea how I managed to climb 1000 feet to the shelter. ","Seth Warner Shelter

Sleeping in was the order of the day. It was almost 11 before I made it out of camp. I also had a rather disagreeable stomach and that held things up. 
Long Trail hikers are a major addition to the trail here. Reactions to them vary. Jill absolutely despises them, I find them kind of adorable. After months of refining gear, developing Trail legs, and learning what Trail life is all about, it is a bit odd to be suddenly surrounded by these people who are hikers but haven't learned any of these lessons yet. People who hike in boots and laugh at the novelty of their camp stoves. If anything, I'll mentor a few.
My first pupil seems to be a guy named Dan. If I'm being honest, I'll be surprised if he makes it. Day two, and he's already having a rough time. He told me his pack weight was thirty pounds, I said that's not terrible and looked at his gear. For one thing, he had three full water bottles. I told him to get rid of two, carry less, fill up more. Then there was his shoes. I told him he should think about getting rid of his heavy boots and switching to trail runners, he said he thinks he needs ankle support. I told him to do what he wants, but pay attention and you'll never see a thru hiker with boots. 
At the top of Glastonbury Mountain was a fire lookout tower (high but didn't sway nearly as much as Shuckstack) that I climbed up and looked out over the mountains.
They really are mountains up here, no more of those little hills that make up the middle of the trail. Real mountains, pine forests on top, noticeable peaks, no more long ridges. The views are incredible.
I made it to the rather alarmingly named Kid Gore Shelter and set up without my tarp. I ate dinner with Dan and a few firefighter/ chicken farmer/ pizza craftsmen that are out for a section hike with their dog. They had some eggs from their chickens too. Solid people.
I'm going to try to get up early tomorrow and put in a 20.","Melville Nauhiem Shelter

This morning Dan got up and said he felt like his legs were going to fall off. He was immediately named Lieutenant Dan.
At the breakfast table, my friendly chicken farmering and fire fighting new friends made me a hard boiled egg from an aggressive their chickens laid just a few days ago. Eggs don't need refrigerated, just as long as you don't wash off the waxy outer coating. In fact the US is one of the only places on earth that you will find refrigerated eggs. The egg was delicious, maybe it was because I was on trail, maybe it was because it was from a local chicken that they claimed was a ""happy chicken"" but either way, it was the best hard boiled egg I've ever tasted.
On the way out I found a pair of flip flops on trail and carried them as far as the next shelter. I never found their owner so I left them as a pair of shelter flops, hopefully someone finds a use for them.
The mud in this state is constant. While Massachusetts was wetter, Vermont is just never ending mud. Every step requires a hop, a skip, a balanced walk, or some other acrobatics to avoid the mud pits of the trail. While rockhopping over one such mud pit my foot slipped, causing me to jam my pole down into the ground. I then fell over and put all my weight on the pile, snapping it in half before coming to rest on a thankfully dry log. 
I lifted up the half of the snapped trekking pole in my right hand and cursed my luck. I packed out the broken pole and sent it on with the chicken farmers after we got to their car.
Gourmet made out even worse today. She slipped head first into the mud and was covered head to toe. I found her bathing in a cool stream, rubbing the caked mud off her skin and trying to wring it out of her clothes.
Stratton Mountain dominated this afternoon. An almost 2000 foot climb up the sides was a reminder that from here the mountains were getting bigger. I got dizzy partway up and put a hurting on my food bag. I may need to hitch into town tomorrow.
At the top was another tower. This one may have been my favorite fire tower, the surrounding landscape was alive with mountains and lakes. 
I met a SOBO with a kilt. We made fast friends. 
At Stratton Pond I found some campers but decided to press on to the next shelter, but not before jumping in and washing the mud and sweat off of me. This would turn out to be a useless gesture. 
I quickly covered my legs in mud all over again. While crossing one mud pit, I jumped across to a big flat rock only to find it slick as ice and my feet went out from under me as my entire body slid across the rock, crashing into the mud off the other side.
I got to the shelter just after dark. For the first time, there is noone here, I have the entire shelter to myself. I have mixed feelings about this. On one hand, I set up inside and don't have to worry about anyone else. At the same time, I do wish I had some company here. Plus it's kinda creepy, I can hear the mice running around on the roof.","Kid Gore Shelter

The day started with a short road walk that was such a joy. I put on some music, The Pogues, and merrily strolled down the road with my one pole. 
I sat for a while beside a brook and soaked my feet. That's when I noticed that my shoe was basically split in half. It was still together, but barely. I looked at that, my dwindling food sack, my single trekking pole, and my ruined buff, and decided I was going to town.
I made it a point to befriend some day hikers on the way out in hopes that they would give me a ride. My charming personality wins again, they took me straight to the outfitter where I upgraded everything. New socks, new shoes, new poles, new buff, new foods I've never tried. I soared no expense and almost fainted at checkout.
A friend from trial saw me coming out with all my new gear and asked if I had been robbed. 
I made friends with a couple from LA in front of a bagel shop, but here my charm failed me. I stuck my thumb out and a car instantly swerved off the road and an unmistakably Russian voice welcomed me.
I thanked this sweet Russian woman and she said ""is OK, I remember not having car."" 
She was a sweetheart. I hope she never loses that accent. ""She with you?"" She asked and I turned around to see another hiker running to the car. 
This other hiker jumped in without asking and joined us. Oh well, the Russian woman didn't seem to mind. 
She drove us out of her way to take us all the way back to the trailhead then taught us a few words in Russian. I forgot them all, typical.

At 4:30 am, right on queue, every phone in the shelter sounded their alarms, and all of us awoke and got to packing. For some reason, I had an awful time sleeping, but felt surprisingly good this morning. 
I left the shelter in the dark. This is only the second time I've left camp before sunrise, the other time was at McAfee Knob. I'm not even sure why I did it this time.
The trail climbed until it came out on a ski slope near the top. It was a gentle green circle slope, the kind you cruise around on when you feel like relaxing or dipping into the trees. 
At the top was a few lift terminals and a ski patrol cabin. The scene made me miss the winter, of course everything makes me wish it was winter, It's my favorite season.
The way was open to the top of one of the lofts so I climbed up the ladder and went onto the walkway around the bull wheel. Several years back I worked at Vail for a season, running the ski lifts and hitting the slopes on my off time. It was an easy and enjoyable job, and every few hours we would have to climb up and perform a ""safety check"" which entailed exactly what you are thinking if you've been paying attention to the slang (hint, the key word is safety!). On New Years Eve, I stubbed my toe. Not just any tie, but my frostbite toe, the middle toe on my right foot that's missing part of its knuckle from the cold and hasn't been right since. The injury was enough to get me put on night duty for a few weeks, where I soon convinced them to let me stay for the rest of the winter. There's no skiing at night. I was litterally just there to send a few people up to the restaurant, send them back down, and send the workers down. My only real job was if the lift stopped, I pressed the button that made it start again. That was it. I would ski every day until 3, ski down to my lift, try not to fall asleep all night at work, go home and rest for a few hours, then do it all again the next morning. I skied obsessively that winter. I hardly ever ate or slept, I got a permanent tired look in my face, I grew dangerously thin, once I almost passed out and realized I hadn't eaten in two days. I didn't care. I was content with snow and two skis. 
I sat and reminisced on top of 5he slopes, then decided it was time to move along. 
I met a lot of friendly puppies today, so that was a win. 
After Bromely, the trail went down then back up again at Styles Peak, where there was a view of fog despite the sunshine. Then it followed the ridge and dropped off gradually. 
I put in 20 miles today. I almost stayed at the shelter at 16 miles when I saw Noodles there, bit was determined to get to Rutland so I kept on. 
Little Rock Pond forces you to pay a $5 fee to the caretaker, a nice long lady named Emily, in order to keep the crowds down. It must work because there's only three of us here. I thought about finding a way to avoid the fee but was so tired I thought I better just pay it. 
I went down to the lake and jumped in to wash off. It was still and warm, the setting sun glowing off the hills that were reflected in the glassy water. Whenever I moved it sent a small ripple out across the lake. ","Bromley Shelter

I left the shelter fairly late, getting some extra sleep to compensate for yesterday's performance. 
I hiked along the pond, then up a steep hill into a haven of pine trees. My time in the south has reinvigorated my passion for pine groves. The needles form a soft duff that's gentle on your feet, they provide the best kind of shade, and that smell. That sweet smell that fills the air of pine sap, what a joy.
Mom texted me after I crossed a small summit and said today was the day they were putting Gunner down. I already said my goodbyes and made my peace with him not being there when I got home, the best thing I can do for him now is get to Katahdin like I always promised him I would.
I remember the day we picked out Gunner. He was part of a litter of that a brother of our former dog had fathered. We met the puppies mother, Sage, and then went inside to meet the pups. There were probably six or seven, all identical, all so excited to see strangers. It would have been impossible to pick one out, but Gunner picked me instead. When the puppies were left out and taken outside to play and roam, one of them took a sudden liking to me, followed me around the entire time and never once left my side. We all knew immediately this was the one. 
Gunner was my best friend for a long time. When things got hard and I needed a break from all the yelling and screaming, Gunner was there, we went to woods. That's how it started, me and Gunner walking in the woods, going and finding the Appalachian Trail together. We were like Alexander and Beaucephilus, inseparable. I can say with certainty that I wouldn't be hiking the AT today if not for Gunner. 
In his entire life, I've only ever heard Gunner bark twice. He never bothered. Most people never heard him even once, and when he did it was enough to shock whoever was in earshot. He was just too calm for it. Nothing bothered him, he had no reason to bother. When people came to the house, he would sit down and stare at them in silent curiosity until he decided they were friends and ran over to greet them. He was motivated solely by food, we had to watch him or else he would sneak out back and start eating the corn out of the deer feeder. He was well fed but eating was his greatest pleasure in life, and if there was anything around for him to eat he did. He was scared of deer but chased bears out of the yard fearlessly. He was unique, that was for sure. We shall never see his like again, and he will be missed terribly.
I met a Long Trail hiker named Sketchy Disco-Fries and spent tge rest of the day with him. He was a Canadian with a masters in philosophy, which led to some great conversations for the rest of the day. We discussed Diogenes, I told him that I felt he fell in the same trap as Buddha. Sketchy took an interest in that and asked me to elaborate, and I shared with him my feeling that while both men found a way to alleviate their own suffering, where they failed was the assumption that suffering was always bad, they missed the mark that suffering was sometimes good for both the individual and the rest of society as a whole. This led to an hours long discussion. We covered morals, ethics, meta physics, the nature of reality and existence, just the sort of topics to carry one through the day, the kinds of things one can ramble about endlessly and pass a long day on trail. 
We got to a road crossing and hitched a ride into a deli that was down the road. We got sandwiches and beer and sat outside, soon to be joined by Lt Dan (not the Lt Dan I mentioned a few days ago, a whole new Lt Dan, this one being an AT hiker instead of an LT hiker and being way less prone to moaning and complaining) and a fellow named Ryan. Ryan is the more serious military type, but friendly, intelligent, and generally thought provoking. I liked him a lot actually, despite our personalities being so different. 
The four of us ate our sandwiches and drank our beer out back. We got the idea to try to camp there, we even asked the guy who lived above the store. He was an enthusiastic supporter, wanting us to hang out all night with him, but said we would have to asked the store owners, as he was just a renter. The store owner shut us down immediately, saying we couldn't stay for safety reasons, ironically enough, because of the guy upstairs. 
""They're afraid we'll go up and murder him"", said Sketchy.
""What if someone else murders him tonight, it may turn out that we could have fought the murderer off if only we had been camped out here,"" I said.
""That's his loss, I sure hope he survives"".
We stuck out our thumbs to hitch back and we're picked up by a familiar face. It was Rain Man, who has now apparently left the Chads and has been taking a week off trail to recoup, and is currently living with the Yellow Deli cult. 
I plan to stay with the Yellow Deli tomorrow night so I told Rain Man I'd be seeing him. I sent Dad a picture of the two of us (Rain Man was always his favorite thru hiker) and hiked on with my four companions. Rain man hopped back in the cult owned van and started heading back for the Deli, he said he'd spent the day working on their farm.
The climb was one of the steepest I've seen in Vermont. The four of us struggled up the hill in the heat (this has been by far the hottest day in New England) and eventually came to the shelter, which was packed full and had a fire going. 
Even though I lost my dog, I'd still say it was a good day.

I woke up later then I intended but still with enough time to make it over Killington to Rutland. Ryan and some southbounders were the only ones left at the shelter, I walked out ahead of them.
Ryan and I have a habit of passing eachother all day every day and today was no exception. He stopped at our first passing while I was having some food near a hillside overlooking the river and told me he admired the fact that I took my breaks anywhere I wanted rather then pushing on to a shelter. 
I received a fine pep talk from a fellow in a tank top and blue lipstick who was named Pep Talk and then climbed what I believe to be the single most pointless of all the trails ups and downs. Now pointless ups and downs, or PUDs as we affectionately term them, exist in plenty across the entire AT, but this one had something special. The trail had been following a small river for almost a mile, never crossing, just meandering about alongside the flowing Brook. Suddenly, the trail turned and shot straight up a sheer cliff. After almost 150 feet of climbing it turned again, and shot back down the hill and switched back toward the original incline. It got within about 30 yards of the start of the climb before crossing the river. It nearly curled back around and touched the trail. You could save 150 feet by simply having the trail cross the river a bit sooner, or just staying right next to the river, but instead there is this completely pointless climb. I crown it king of the PUDs, all hail.
At the next road crossing I looked down and saw about 10 beers sitting on the side of the road. No time for contemplation, I cracked one open, sat down in the shade, leaned back against my bag, put on some Dubliners, and had myself the finest of rests. Ryan and Crispy soon came and joined me, I stayed for over an hour. 
Immediately after came a sig proclaiming 500 miles to Katahdin. I sat and pondered what still lies ahead. 500 miles, it was about 100 miles to the Whites, those 100 looked relatively easy compared to the rest, then there would be the 100 mile wilderness, which I hear is a wild and mostly flat dreamscape, that leaves 300 of the hardest miles on the entire trail. By all accounts, it was going to be grueling. I've heard it said that soon it ceases to be the Appalachian Trail and becomes the Appalachian Obstacle Course. 
I hiked on, like always.
The climb up Killington started shortly after. Ryan and I kept passing eachother the whole way up. It was a hard climb, the biggest climb since Virginia in fact. I scrambled over the roots and rocks and enjoyed the views near the top until I realized that the trail doesn't actually reach the summit, or the ski are for that matter. It tops out at Cooper Lodge, and plummets down the other side, 200 feet below the summit. 
My high school ski club trip was to Killington. I'm pretty sure we weren't allowed back, don't tell them I was here.
I never ran into Sketchy on the descent. I hope I see him tomorrow in Rutland. 
At the bottom of Killington my feet ached a bit, but were helped by the sight of a cooler labeled trail magic. Inside was a can of Coars on ice. 
I hitched into town with a tow truck which dropped me off in the middle of town, about a mile away from the Yellow Deli. I've been hearing stories about these people for years. The hostel is run by a cult. ","Clarendon Shelter

Zero at the Yellow Deli
I'm no stranger to cults and I don't see why people are so afraid of them. You just have to remind yourself not to fall into the traps, they catch you when you are at your weakest, keep a strong mind and dabbling with cults is a fun time. 
This particular cult is fairly normal compared to others I've been around. They are some slow talking, glazey eyed, hold hands and have a prayer circle type of folks but that's barely even unusual. The last time I spent a night with a cult I broke my windshield, had a small breakdown and woke up in someone else's tent with a girl I didn't know. There's none of that here, these people are just some calm, happy living, simple life loving folks who have an odd obsession with machta. 
They also run a ton of businesses which I don't doubt are largely helped by the fact they don't pay taxes. 
The hostel is free and so is the breakfast. I wasn't sure if I would zero here or not, but the food in the Deli convinced me to stay. 
I ate breakfast with some cult members and a few southbounders. The lady who ate with us told us all about how she worked for the post office in Phoenix before she joined the ""community"" and when she quit her job they sent her to a government physiologist for three weeks before they would let her leave. She rendered to all the other ""community"" members as ""my sister"" or ""my brother"".
They asked for help peeling bananas and I figured I'd earn my breakfast. I spent about two hours peeling with a guy named Levrock (probably misspelled that). The cult members all take on Hebrew names as part of their commitment to recreating the early Christian church. They even call Jesus ""Yahshua"". 
Rainman came down and peeled bananas with me. We caught up, shared a few laughs, and then I started noticing that something was a bit off about the way he was talking about the group. I asked him how long he planned to stay, he said a few weeks. That was concerning, but then he told me after that he would be finishing the trail and coming back to join permanently. 
They got Rainman. The poor man intends to join the cult. 
When we finished the bananas I took Rainman for a walk to the store. I bought him some beer and we sat down on the park bench and day drank a bit. I heard him out, he's in deeper then I had hoped. He confessed to me that he only starred the trail with $600. I was blown away and asked him how on Earth he made it this far. He attributed it to a combination of the kindness of strangers, a charming personality, and sheer dumb luck. Rainman has been carrying his father's ashes since Springer, this entire hike is a send off for his elder, a fulfillment of his fathers final wishes. Its no wonder that the cult was able to sway him, he needs love and support, and I knew I couldn't talk him out of joining. 
I did the next best thing, I got him buzzed and planted a few ideas in his head, a few ways out, and if that all failed, I reminded him to keep his wits about him and remember to get out of there of things changed as he went further into the cult. Rainman still calls it a cult. That's a good sign.
I found Sketchy and Ryan back at the Deli. We all ate lunch together (listen, I'm not even a vegetarian, but this places veggie burger is life changing) and drank some more machta. 
We decided to sample some local beers, so the three of us went to a tap house and got a few flights. I've grown very close with Ryan and Sketchy in the last few days. Ryan especially I never thought I'd come to admire so much. He's a worldly man, full of wisdom and stories from a life traveling the globe in the military, sometimes for reasons he agreed with and other times not. 
Sketchy is a smart man, Ryan is a wise man. Together they make for excellent company and intelligent conversation, but also both have great senses of humor and a bold curiosity for all they see. They are good people, they'll both finish the Long Trail. I only wish they had been AT hikers that I might have been with them all along. 
Back at the Deli, a big group of hikers got a table and had supper. I was sober at this point, despite all my earlier alchohol consumption, and I think this was the hardest I've laughed since I started the hike. The amount of caffine I've had today from cup after cup of the cults machta may have helped. Sketchy, a Canadian citizen, used the word ""poutinery"" and I thought that was the funniest thing I've ever heard in my life. They have restaurants in Canada that just sell poutine, nothing else. Poutinery.
 Racehorse ordered a glass of banana milk and when I said that I had been working hard all day peeling the bananas, she said ""I'll drink your banana milk"" and because we are all four out here we laughed at that sentence for an hour. 
Days like today really remind me why I'm out here, which is ironic because I didn't hike or even set foot on the trail. There is a community out here, not the cult, the hikers, which you could say is its own little cult in and of itself. 
We've got all the markings of a cult. You get a new name, become part of strange traditions, form a new family, take part in self abuse that anyone outside your circle finds odd at the least, even terrifying. You alienate some, are admired by others. You speak for your group, inspire the public and recruit new members. You take part in a certain ideology, a new code of ethics, you take part in something because it makes sense to you.
We still pay taxes and don't abuse children or brainwash the weak and helpless of course, but still, the parallel is there, I'll take what I'm given. ","

I stared at a quote painted on the wall. Something about how it's far easier to teach an unintelligent man than an educated one. Stupidity as a virtue, typical cult propaganda, don't think too hard or you might realize that this is completely bonkers. 
I ate breakfast down at the Deli with a table of hikers and cult members, same as yesterday. Eggs, cheese, bulgar wheat, the deli's bread, watermelon, homemade jams, and of course an unlimited supply of matcha. One of the cult members, a young lady, seated at our table seemed a lot different than the others in the community. She didn't talk with an exaggerated slowness, she didn't have that glazed over look in her eyes, she didn't go out if her way to refer to everyone around her as sister or brother. Conversation with her flowed naturally, she told us all about her life, the history of the community and all about their ""peacemaker"" busses (apparently these are some oddly rigged up Ken Kesey style busses that used to drive around and provide medical assistance and stop fights at Grateful Dead shows).
She was highly intelligent, that's what it really was. She was the smartest person there, maybe the smartest in the cult. She was also the only one that mentioned that people should join, almost in a reactionary way. There were insecurities there, I could see it. That was her way of compensating. I had to wonder if the people in the community were frightened or alienated by her, especially with her being a woman, and this was her way if showing devotion and overcompensating. The talk remained friendly however, and soon she brought out her little infant son to the table.
The little guy was adorable in his cult flannel and hat, I had to admit. I wondered how much having a baby in the cult would tie his mother down if she ever got the urge to leave. I wondered too about the baby, what his life would be like. The 12 tribes homeschooled their children and never sent them to college, the kid would have to undergo a major transformation accompanied by great difficulty if he ever wanted to break out into the real world. Then again he might just thrive there, be a model citizen and never feel an urge to leave. 
The cult invited me back for a wedding in October. I'll admit, that's tempting. I bet these guys put on some fantastic weddings. Wouldn't be the first wedding of a foreign faith I crashed, in fact the last wedding I went to before the pandemic was a Sikh wedding in the Punjab city I'd Amritsar, where I never met the bride or groom but got some fantastic pictures of myself dancing with men in full turbans and beards. Maybe I will make it back to here, we'll see. I'm never converting to Christianity and trying to bring about the end times by recreating the early Christian church, so there's really no harm in hanging around these people.
I decided to pack up and get out of there before they tried to get me to start peeling fruit again. I packed my bag, stripped and remade my bed, threw a couple things in the hiker box, and headed down to the bus station. Rutland has a free bus that runs back and forth to Killington all day, and they will drop you off at the trailhead.
I hiked a mile up before coming to Maine Junction. Here the AT split from the LT, with the Long Trail headed north to Canada and the Appalachian Trail going east to New Hampshire. I sat down to take one more lunch on the LT. 
A dog came running southbound on the LT and ran up to me and started licking me. I scratched his ears and patted his head. He sat right down on my lap and kept on petting him and playing with him. 
A woman came running up the trail, calling to her dog and apologizing. As long as I lihe I will never understand why people with dogs apologize when they find you petting them. Petting a dog is litterally one of life's greatest pleasures, if anything I should be thanking these people for letting their dogs play with me. 
I walked up over a few peaks, took a break by a lake, walked a bit more, took a nap in my hammock, walked a bit more, befriended a Croatian couple that just moved to the area last year, walked some more, saw a waterfall, walked some more and got into the shelter after dark. It was a lazy day with low miles. I set up off the rafters behind the shelter and cooked dinner in the dark.","Yellow Deli Hostel

I wanted to make at least 20 miles today. I had good luck overnight, it didn't rain on me and the dog in the shelter stopped growling at me pretty quickly.
I left and started heading down the ridge until I came to a sheer cliff with an aluminum ladder tied fast to it. Down below the ladder, the blazes kept on, so I turned around and climbed my way down off the cliff. Ladders, rebar and various other handholds will only grow more common from here on.
I made the bottom and went back up the other side, and repeated several times. The heat today was the worst yet. I hiked along shirtless, and whenever I came to an uphill I would look around then tuck my kilt into my hip belt, otherwise it would be intolerable. 
At the bottom of one hill about 15 miles in was a thick overgrown field. I pressed through that, surprised to still be finding white blazes, and came out the other side to a bridge. When I looked down off the bridge I thought I must be hallucinating. The heat had finally gotten to me and I was going mad, but no, it was there. Two naked ladies laughing and playing in the creek. They looked up at me when my trekking poles hit the bridge and I waved at them. They waved back and smiled, then wrapped themselves in towels and came up to say hello. 
""Sorry you saw us naked"", the one said. 
In my head I thought ""I'm not"", but I held my tongue.
""Let us get you some food! There's a store right down the way!"" The other offered.
So they went to the store while I jumped in the creek myself and they came back with an absolute smorgasbord. Two turkey sandwiches, a hard boiled egg, four cheese sticks, a blueberry pie, doritos, chips, a crate of blueberries, a snickers bar and two Dr. Peppers. 
I talked with them for a minute, they were a couple from California who were scoping out a new place to live here because their entire state is on fire and out of water. Then they took off and left me to my feast. 
I started laughing uncontrollably. Something about this was just so funny. I told the next hiker what happened when he asked where I got all that food, he said they were mermaids. 
I ate everything I couldn't pack out and drank both Dr. Peppers. Feeling jacked from the sugar rush and good fortune I cranked out the next few miles without much difficulty despite the elevation gain. 
At a road crossing (where I found more soda in a cooler) I filled up on enough water to get through the night and decided I wasn't going all the way to the shelters (it was nearly dark already) and I would just camp with the first people I ran into. There were some viewpoints ahead with stealth sites. 
I climbed up 600 feet in .6 miles, and collapsed at the top and watched the sunset for a moment. Then I noticed that noone was around so I kept moving, hoping to find camp before dark. 
The woods there were a campers dream. The most spectacular camping woods you can imagine, no rocks, spaced out trees, pine needle beds, hardly any logs or sticks, yet noone was camping in them. 
It grew dark. I considered just setting up and sleeping alone (which I'm no stranger to but it tends to be a bad night's rest) but a few sets of eyes in the woods changed my mind. I night hiked with my headlamp, still figuring I'd run into someone somewhere. 
It was another hour to the shelter and I knew then that I was going to have to go all the way there. I made it in around 10 pm and laid down, almost too tired to sleep.

Thistle Hill Shelter to Hanover
Last night I was almost too tired to sleep. It started pouring rain at about 3:30 am and it was hard to sleep through. 
By morning it was clear but I wasn't very well rested. I was lazy about getting up, reluctant to pack, and even more reluctant to hike. I was slow and sluggish and took a lot of breaks. 
I made it up to a hill with an apple tree. I grabbed a low hanging apple, gave it a slight pull, and bit into it. It was perfectly ripe. I ate the whole apple and tossed the core into the bushes. The taste of wild apples reminded me of fall at our cabin in Pennsylvania, where I used to take a backpack and hike down to the bottom of the mountain, fill the backpack with apples, and hike all the way back up with them. We would make pies, or just eat them, or sometimes throw then out for the bears and the deer. 
It's exciting to know that the apples are ripe, it's been a bit of a dead spot with the berries, and I miss calories that I didn't have to carry. 
Even more exciting, cider will probably be a thing soon. Apple cider, the real stuff, like the kind you drive out an hour and buy from the amish and it says nothing on the label besides ""Apple cider"" and where it's from, is one of the greatest joys in my life. I hope I can find some along the trail.
The trail went through the town of West Hartford, where the whole town was out swimming in the river. It's a tiny town with nothing going on, but had some really neat old buildings and an awesome abandoned looking church. 
At the end of town, I was feeling over the day. I sat down for about an hour and looked at the map. I wasn't far from the border at all. I should easily make New Hampshire if I would just get up and go there. 
Somehow, that was all I needed to hear from myself. I stood up, put my pack on, and got some bolt of energy that carried me at top speed through the next six miles. I had no plans for when I got there, I just wanted to hit New Hampshire. The trail crossed the border in a town, maybe I'd have to walk all the way to the next shelter, maybe the trail would provide, either way I was going. 
I made it to Norwich, the town on the Vermont side, and went to the grocery store for a resupply. They had some crav rangoons sitting in a fridge so I bought them and sat outside eating them when I struck up a conversation with a guy named Mike and his daughter who were eating ice cream outside. 
Mike is a middle aged man straight from a 90s sitcom and his daughter is about my age, curiously minded, fun, and intellectual, I liked them both immediately. It ended with Mike inviting me to come set up in his back yard. He lived in town just on the other side of the border. He also mentioned his older daughter had hiked the AT in 2016. 
If any of you ever start to lose faith in humanity, do a thru hike and you'll find out the true nature of humankind. Someone like Mike has nothing to gain from me. It's almost dark, by the time I get to his house I'll be going straight to bed, we won't even hang out. He doesn't know me, all he knows is my name is Smuggler. For all he knows, I could be some crackhead that steals all his lawn ornaments. But, for no real reason, he trusts me. And, for even less reason, he wants me to sleep in his yard just because it will benefit me. You're a good man Mike, we should all try to be more like you.
I crossed the river and entered New Hampshire, my second to last state and, I'm told, the second hardest state. It's also said to be the most beautiful. I made it to Mike's house, just off the trail, right where he said, and set up my hammock under his back porch. Mike warned me several times of a Groundhog that libes back here. If I see that Groundhog we will fight to the death, noone messes with Mike's yard on my watch. ","Thistle Hill Shelter

Mike came out with a cup of coffee for me first thing in the morning. We talked for a while while I packed up my hammock. I tore the hammock a bit near the zipper, that sewing kit I've been carrying this whole way is going to get some use it would seem. 
I promised Mike a postcard and hiked out of town with a full battery pack. I spent four hours sitting on a rock. Crispy sat with me, Amazon came and declared she was doing the pct next year and gave me her number, various others came by and said hello, I stayed and laid back with my shoes off. I'm beginning to accept that I'll never catch up to Jill and Morgan, I'm about to stop trying. Every time I try I wear myself down, hurt my feet and end up losing miles.

Today I refused to move. I stayed in my hammock, slept in until almost noon, and didn't leave camp until almost 2. It was a good day. 
I needed it. I was still feeling that big day, last night I limped into camp. The new shoes aren't quite broken in all the way yet either.
Something I've noticed in New Hampshire and Vermont is that sections of the forest smell like pancakes. This region is famous for its maple syrup. Lines come off the trees and run the sticky sap into barrels anytime you're on private property. When you hit a big group of maples, it reeks of pancakes. It's torture to anyone suffering hiker hunger.
I crossed over Moose Mountain South and North peaks. When I stopped for lunch a guy named Bluegrass joined me. Bluegrass started on March 28th, two days after me, and we haven't met until now. It makes me wonder how many people have stayed just a day or two away from me and I never knew it. There's probably someone who had kept a consistent pace a few miles behind me the whole way that I've never heard of. Maybe he or she occasionally sees my ""Smuggler was here"" messages and wonders who I am.
I got a coca cola from a guy named Chuck and then crossed another mountain. Marsha is joining me for a two day stretch coming up, and I sat down on the road on the other side and waited for her. 
As I sat in waiting a van pulled up to me and shouted ""You look comfortable!"".
I made some small talk for a second until I noticed that the side of the van read ""Miss Janet"".
""Are you Miss Janet?"" I asked suddenly with the keenest interest. 
She was. I jumped up in excitement, so happy to be meeting this absolutely legendary woman. In the centuries to come, Miss Janet is one of the trail angels that will be remembered. Early on, Chopsticks told me to never worry about how fast I'm going in relation to the other hikers, the only metric that one needs to measure himself with is if he is someplace close to Miss Janet. 
Every year, she packs up this beautiful van and follows the bubble, doing trail magic, giving rides, being a legend and an inspiration to everyone on trial and making the lives of everyone she meets that much better. She gave me a Dr. Pepper and I cherished it, before returning her the empty can. I thanked her for what she did, for being Miss Janet, and she told me I was going to make it then she sped off into the dust of a dirt road.
Marsha came just as the dust settled. We went to town and got a pizza, then drove out ahead and dropped her car off and her brother drove us back to the road crossing where I saw Miss Janet. The two of us are hiking the next two days.","Mink Brook

Mile 1768.6 to Bracket Brook
We spent the night on some sort of old road bed and woke up to a chilly sunshine. 
We hiked out to the first stream and filtered some water. Marsha had all mew gear and was still learning how to use it. She plans to thru hike the pct next year, so these two days are the first of her shakedown hikes. Most people would dial back the mileage for something like this, but I thought it best to keep it where it has been, give her the full experience.
The trail started climbing Smarts Mountain early on. Smarts is a rather large and bulky mountain with a fire tower on top. We climbed and clamored up the face, which was full of massive rocks that add for decent walking, and passed several flash summits and steep climbs. When the top looked to finally be the real top, I jumped up to see the view, and found myself looking up and across about a mile at a fire tower. The summit was still at least another 1000 feet up. 
Marsha did well with the climbs. She had to stop a few times, she couldn't quite keep up with me (no surprise there considering I've done nothing but hike for almost five months) but her spirits stayed high and she seemed to be enjoying it. 
From the fire tower you could see the false summit, a large cube shaped mountain which logic could only dictate to be Mt. Cube, and beyond that Mousilauke towering over everything. It was another day and a half away, but the Whites were in view.
After Smarts we went down and then climbed Mt. Cube. Cubes rocky and open summit was a great place to have supper, so we ate on top, enjoyed the view, then went down the other side in the dark to a spot camp next to the first water source. Marsha only fell a few times.","Mile 1768.6

Glencliff to Beaver Brook Shelter
Welcome to Moosilauke, the trail will never be the same.
In the morning, Marsha was gone and it was pouring rain. I had no service to check the weather, but decided to wait it out and see if conditions improved. I waited in my hammock until noon then started making plans.
My only goal for the day, I decided, was to cross over Moosilauke. Having to cross the highest mountain since Virginia and one of the steepest on the trail in a storm was no ideal, but I knew I had to get some miles in at least.
I packed up and left in the rain. The climb started out steep but not too extreme. 
The problem with steep climbs in the rain is that your rain gear makes you sweat, and it's about equal to how wet you would be getting without the rain gear. You can't win, you get wet no matter what.
Further up the climb I got back into service and checked the weather. It turns out we were getting hit with the remains of a tropical storm who was lovingly named Fred, and it wasn't going to stop raining until tomorrow morning.
The climb got steeper and the climate changed. Now I was clamoring up a rocky trail that clung to the side of a near vertical hillside, lined with nothing but pines, distinctly subalpine. As I climbed, the temperature dropped. It occurred to me that I was soaking wet and the top would probably be battered with intense wind. Getting too cold up there, or worse getting injured, could be deadly. That's not even to mention the possibility of lightning. But I was already most of the way up, my best bet would be to just get over the top to the other side as fast as I could. 
It was getting late too. The straight up climb took hours longer then expected. I had to keep moving to get down before dark. 
The trail came to a ridge that provided a steadier climb and I tried to make up time on it. I watched the trees along the ridge get smaller and smaller, going from towering pines to little more then battered bushes. They got shorter then me. The winds picked up and the rain was blowing sideways. Then it happened, I reached that magical point that marks a new climactic zone. That spot where trees can no longer handle the conditions, you leave their habitat.Genuine alpine tundra, above the treeline.
This was a real alpine zone, not the south with its mysterious balds, but the tundra, where the winters are too harsh and the climate is too brutal to even grow a tree. The last few before the line are stunted, battered, broken things, then it is nothing but grass and moss, which often takes years to grow a few inches.
Hiking past the treeline is a powerful experience anywhere. I've done it countless times in the Rockies, the Sierra, the Himalayas, but never the Appalachians, never any mountain on the east coast. When you cross that line you are vulnerable, taking the full force of all the mountain has to throw at you with nothing for shelter. There's nothing left to hide behind, nothing to shield you from the elements, nothing to protect you from the fury of the mountains. It's also the most beautiful place on the mountain, with nothing blocking your view and the entire world below. I wished I could have stayed to enjoy it.
I put my hood up and tried to block the rain hitting my face. My glasses were so covered and wet I couldn't see out of them do I put them in my fanny pack (people with kilts call them sporrans) and pressed on. I tried to pick out the cairns in the fog. The outline of the next one would stand sentinel over the trail, and the silhouette of the next one would stay hidden until just after it. 
I crossed over the top and felt like I was going to be blown off the mountain. There were a few rock piles to serve as wind breaks, but I knew better then to try to hide behind them. If I stopped, the cold would creep in, the only option was to keep going. 
Rain soaking my face, wind pushing me eternally to the left, I hiked on until I saw the trees popping back up on the other side. I took a step back down into the tick pine forest and was once again insulated from the brutal crosswind. There was calm. 
I laughed and took out my glasses. The frame snappe, the left side fell off. 
I put them away until later and hiked on with my prescription sun glasses. The danger of the summit was past, but the descent posed a whole new challenge. 
The trail was covered in rocks, boulders, logs and various other forms of uneven terrain, and it was all soaking wet and slick as could be. The trail was also still on the side of what could very nearly be reasonably called a cliff. A slip here could mean the end of the hike or worse.
The shelter sat partway down the steepest part. By all accounts, the worst was st to come, but that's tomorrow's problem. I made dinner with the three guys in the shelter and we all had a good laugh about how dumb we all were for crossing today. 
I made knorr pasta with pepperoni and habenaro cheese. It was delicious. A section hiker in the shelter tells me he's been catching frogs and cooking frog legs, and I think I may follow his example in the near future. They're like berries that hop.","Glencliff

Beaver Brook Shelter to Mile 1820
The morning was cold and drizzly. I waited it out. 
I got up as things started to clear out. You are supposed to be able to see the Kinsmans (Kinsmen? Kinsmanses?) from the shelter but the fog still had it blocked. 
I meant to cross them today and when I left camp I should have had time, but I missed one crucial detail in my calculations, the infamous descent off Moosilauke. 
I made almost half a mile an hour coming down that thing, less then a quarter my usual speed. The wet rocks didn't help, but even without them it's a tough climb that requires the utmost care with each step, let's of scrambling and clutching the mountain. 
Beaver Brook parallels the trail on the descent, kept in a near constant state of waterfalls by the impossible steepness of the mountain. 
The descent killed my time, by the time I reached the bottom I knew I'd be lucky to get anywhere near the Kinsmans. On top of that, a hurricane is apparently coming to New England, and will be striking here on Sunday and Monday. The last time I was in a hurricane it caused widespread flooding and destruction, I nearly drowned myself once or twice while trying to get home. That said, I'd probably still keep going through this one if not for the fact that Franconia Ridge is up ahead. The ridge is said to be one of the most beautiful places on the entire trail and I don't intend to walk across it unable to see. 
I plan to hike to the road tomorrow and take my first double zero, why not, there's time. ","Beaver Brook Shelter

I need to get over this mountain and off this trail. Naturally I didn't bother getting up until 9. 
Marsha has been kind enough to agree to pick me up and let me stay at her place until Henri (that's what they're calling it, Hurricane Henri, it's adorable) is gone. First though, I need to get to the interstate, which lies on the other side of the Kinsmans. Red and Racehorse led the way, after they passed I went into ""uphill mode"" (naked) and started the climb. And a climb it was.
Put away the poles and grab on to whatever you can, clamor over the rocks and roots. At least this time it was dry. The Kinsmans get about as close to breaking treeline as you go without actually breaking it. The trees at the top are about knee high, dwarfed and scraggly, and the view is phenomenal. Franconia Ridge loomed out ahead, high and inviting. I stared out at it until a cloud blew in and engulfed the summit. 
The way down was treacherous. I would throw my poles and climb down to them and soon have to repeat the process. I took a few bad falls.
Near the bottom at the Lonesome Lake Hut was a wedding, full of fancy looking drunk screaming people in dresses. Classy yet trashy, not my people. They all kind of sideeyed me, noone wanted to talk to me. That's typical, I kind of hate weddings actually. I did notice a jug of water on a table and noone bothered to stop me from filling up my bottle. Noone ever said a word. I should have taken a beer while I was at it. 
It was a race to get to the road before dark, since my headlamp was dead and my glasses were broken. Towards the end it was getting difficult to see through my sunglasses.
In the end I got to the road and Maraha grabbed me with a smile and whisked me away to her place. She lives in a big fancy canvas tent up here and works for a place that offers ""glamping"" to wealthy New Englanders who will most certainly be the first to die when the revolution hits. 
It's a lovely place to wait out a hurricane. ","Mile 1820

Hurricane double zero part one
Another lazy zero, this time in a fancy tent and a trap house. I laid in bed recovering until Marsha got off work then we went to REI for a new fanny pack for me (the one I bought in Pearisburg is about destroyed) and then we got Thai food. The storm wasn't that bad, just a bit of rain.","

Hurricane Henri Double Zero Part 2
Same as yesterday, I laid in Martha's bed and waited for her to get off work. The lack of motion, of having to climb or hold myself back on a steep descent, was everything I could have asked for. The fridge was full of sugary drinks, the table full of high calorie baked goods, and there was unlimited electricity. Everything a tired and Weary thru hiker needs to pass a hurricane. 
Marsha was too kind, really. I've only known her for about 8 months, and five of those I was on trail for, and yet here she was, picking me up, driving me wherever I needed to go, sheltering me from the storm outside.
This past December I moved my things into a small dorm room in Mammoth Hot Springs, Yellowstone National Park. The pandemic, which would soon be peaking and killing thousands a day, meant that Old Faithful was closed for the winter and I wouldn't be able to spend my time as usual sealed off from the world in that icy wonderland free of cars or even roads. Instead I would be spending my time on the edge of the park, the edge of civilization where I couldn't quite escape it. 
I made fast friends with a young woman named Shannon. She was an energetic and fierce girl who enjoyed harsh winters and fine whiskeys and the occasional emotional breakdown just to keep things interesting. We skied every day, a quick loop after work, a long trek into the frozen woods on our days off, whatever was available. Then, after a few weeks, she said she was inviting Marsha out to a spot we found and had been frequenting. Marsha had seen my name go across her desk countless times in the last few years, and we had probably met briefly once or twice, but we didn't know eachother.
Marsha was new to cross country skiing, and the trail Shannon and I liked best was difficult and dangerous, yet Marsha pressed on without fear or concern. I was impressed with her right away, the fact she didn't back away like most people, but rather accepted whatever lie ahead and worked her way through it. 
Later that day, when we stopped into town for a pizza at one of the few restaurants still open in Gardiner, Marsha said she was cold so I gave her my yak wool hat. She took it and smiled at me, and I gave her a bit of a longer look then usual. 
With the bars being closed and indoor gatherings not allowed, the place to socialize became the ice skating rink. Marsha, Shannon and I were all skating together one night. Marsha was new to it, and I was holding onto her hand while we were gliding across the ice. She got off the rink for a second and Shannon came skating up to me. ""Do you see what's happening here?"" She asked, motioning back toward Marsha. I smiled and nodded. 
The next time Marsha came out, I took her hand and we skated around all night until long after everyone else went to bed. 
Marsha was born in Russia and had grown up in an orphanage there until she was six and adopted and taken to the USA. She had been in the park since 2014 (same as me) and was planning on moving on with her life at some point in the near future. We both enjoyed quiet nights, skiing, Asian foods, the prospect of adventure, and laughing in the face of whatever the world threw at us. She was kind, intelligent, thought provoking, good at cracking my back, and beautiful. It was a happy winter. 
I knew I was headed for the trail so I tried my best to not get too attached, I figured I would leave for the trail and that would be the end of it. Instead, here I was in the tent that now served as her house and we were going to do the PCT next year. Life is full of little oddities, you can never know what lies ahead. 
When Marsha got home she drove me out to a nearby Walmart where I noticed a vision center and remembered my broken glasses. I tried earlier to order a new pair online but no website exists that will make glasses with a prescription as strong as mine, and even worse my prescription is over two years olf which means ordering new lenses would be impossible from any respectable store.. but this was Walmart, and I knew that trashy miracles happened at Walmarts. I walked in and an extremely nice lady heard me out and got the idea to see if the lenses from my broken glasses would fit any of the frames they had lying about in the store. The trail provides, she found Ines that fit, and I now am the proud owner of a set of plastic rimmed glasses. 
The hurricane was underwhelming on all fronts, just some heavy rain and it moved on. Tomorrow is supposed to be nice again, back to the trail. ","

Interstate 93 to Garfield Ridge Campsite
Marsha drove back to the trail while I napped in the front seat. 
We got back and started the long climb up the ridge. I met AARP on the way up, I've been hearing about him for a long time.
The climb was long and grueling, but at the top was the legendary Franconia Ridge. Look up anything about the AT on Google images and I will guarantee you will see pictures of Franconia, it is the face of the trail.
Above the treeline, the wind was blowing straight across, sending clouds across the ridge, occasionally burying us in a sea of white cloud, only to open back up to a new view of the ridge and surrounding hills. 
It was clear over Mt Lincoln but the summit of Lafayette was shrouded. On the other side of the peak we got below the cloud line, then it opened back up again, revealing the wonders of the mountains and the warmth of sunshine. 
This is one of the most beautiful places on the entire trail. It was a genuine pleasure to be able to do this with Marsha. 
After that we passed Garfield Pond and crossed over Garfield peak near sunset. The evening colors were magic, Marsha and I sat on a rock just below the summit and gazed out at the world together until we got too cold. Then we went to the top, where Owlbear was spending the night, I wished him good luck.
At the campsite, every tent pad was taken. We set up in the woods and then realized it was on a recovery zone. Too late.","Interstate 93

Garfield Ridge Shelter to Mile 1839.4
Marsha left in the morning before I even woke up. I instantly wished that she was still there, but I knew she had to get back home. We've come a long way in the last few weeks, I'm growing more fond of her by the day, I must admit. I can't wait for next week when she comes to visit again. 
I got up and tried to leave, but instead sat down for breakfast and was joined by Bluegrass. He told me that yesterday he almost quit. I asked him why, with only 360 miles to go, he would ever want to quit now and he said the Whites were absolutely wrecking him, and yesterday he snapped a pole and his frustration boiled over. I encouraged him not to quit, and he said he was taking a zero today and then finishing this thing. 
Some people's bodies seem to have peaked. They're not longer gaining muscle and getting stronger, but rather they are withering away, looking scraggly and finding themselves with less energy as the days go by and the hiking gets harder. The constant stress out bodies face put here is compounding, and rather then developing into some invincible superhiker, we're all just becoming wounded.
I fear I may be part of this group. My miles are lower then ever, my feet hurt me so bad it's hard to convince myself to keep going, and above all I'm tired. But it's so beautiful out here, and despite all this complaining I'm doing, I am happy. So happy I don't want this thing to end. 
Tomorrow is my 5 month anniversary on the trail. There's a good chance there will not be a 6th. 350 miles to go, under normal circumstances that would be three and a half weeks. Of course 100 miles weeks don't seem to be possible in the Whites, but how long do they actually last? Or, better question, how long do they stay so hard? New Hampshire and Southern Maine are well known for being the hardest parts of the trail, and with good reason if the last 40 miles are any indication of what lies ahead, but northern Maine is said to be a breeze. There's only 80 miles left in New Hampshire, so if it stays hard for say around half of the remaining miles, I'll make it to Katahdin before my six month, and if not, it'll only be another week or two. 
I left the shelter and climbed down off the mountainside, nearly vertical as usual. Whoever designed these trails and thought that building a trail up a cliff with no switchbacks was a good idea should be whipped in the streets. Honestly, I love it. 
I made my way out to the next Hut, which had a spigot for drinking water. I filled my bottle then filled an empty sweet tea bottle I'd been carrying but hadn't used. I took a big gulp from the tea bottle and spit it back out when the taste of stale tea hit me. I looked at the bottle and saw that it was full of mold. I hope that doesn't kill me. 
I made the climb up South Twin, then enjoyed the relatively easy ridge walk that followed. It is remote up here, the mountain tops are above treeline, there are lakes when you look down over, the trail is full of climbing and obstacles, and you can't hear the sound of anything unnatural other then your own feet and poles. 
Towards dark I found a water source and set up with another fellow hammocker. ","Garfield Ridge Campsite

Mile 1839.4 to Mizpah Spring Hut 
Sometimes I think about how easy it would be to murder me out here in my sleep and I laugh. I always wake up just a little bit happy that I didn't die. Living is kind of my thing. 
The first thing I came to was Zealnd Falls Hut. What a fantastic place, you could swim just outside the cabins doors in the stream and the falls, it overlooked the mountains in the distance. Spots like that make me wish I had more time. I wish I could have just stopped there and spent the day, but I need to get to Maine. 
The trail after that was the fattest it's been in New Hampshire. I almost forgot what it was like to walk on flat ground, to make up time, to not be exhausted and not have to worry about where each foot is landing. 
I went through a big rock slide, hiked along the river a long way, and went through a bog. 
I looked ahead and saw something charging down the trail at me. With my poor eyesight and depth perception, I couldn't tell what it was a first and I lifted my poles and prepared for a fight. Then I took note of its ears and long feet, it's small size and it's distinctive gait. It was a snowshoe hare charging down the trail at me, still in his summer brown coat.
I relaxed and admired the creature, then I noticed how exhausted it looked. I could actually hear it panting as it got closer and closer. How long had it been running? I don't know that I've ever seen an animal looking so exhausted. A better question, what was it running from?
I tensed up a bit again as the hare got to within 15 feet of me, now 10. Was I about to have a fight with an oversized rabbit. It must not have noticed me, even though I was standing in the middle of it's path. I was worried it would run right into me, so I jumped and yelled at it. 
It took notice of me and changed its course just before it got to my feet. It made a rushed turn, dodged me, and ran around through the bushes and continued at its fast but exhausted pace down the trail. I looked after the hare, looked back forward again, then repeated the process a few times. Nothing came chasing after it.
Later on I got stung by a bee. It had to happen sooner or later, today was the day. I think it was just a small bee, the sting isn't too bad. 
Walking out of the woods into a parking are I noticed a note for Coach and Tator Tot, but I didn't bother reading it. 
I found Woodman at the bottom and ate lunch with him, then Coach and Taor Tot came by while we were filtering water. I mentioned the note to them and they said they hadn't seen it, Coach ran back to check it out, but I turned around and started another of the Whites many absurdly steep climbs. 
Woodman and I climbed together as far as Wevster Cliffa, a few thousand feet above where we had met. We were both drenched in sweat, as was Great Dane, a flip flopper who we passed. 
After Webster (which, by the way, is a spectacular spot) the trail switched to some of the most technical scrambling I've seen. Coach and Tator caught up again and the three of us navigated the Cliffs. 
The sun was pretty much set by the time we hit Mt Jackson (I'm sorry Mt Jackson, ooooo). In the distance, I could clearly see Mt. Washington, looming menacingly and shrouded in dark clouds. Tomorrow's problem. We all climbed down off the Cliffs and through the bogs with our headlamps. 
We found a group of thru hikers cow on camping on a rock in the middle of a treeless bog. We stopped and talked with them and asked them why on earth they would pass so many great stealth sites to spend the night on a rock in a bog, especially since the Hut was only another mile. They had no good answer, it was just what they felt I guess. I also think they had discussed a bit too much trail safety that night.
We made the Hut, the last place to camp before the Presidential traverse. Tomorrow will be 14 miles above treeline over the highest mountains in the northeast.","Mile 1839.4

Mizpah Spring Hut to Mile 1867.6
Today was the Presidential Traverse, the longest we'd stay above treeline on the whole trail and the whole way was through what they proudly proclaimed to be the ""worst weather in America"". 
There was no camping above treeline, you could bail out at one spot by climbing half a mile down off the ridge, but the best way was to just go for it and knock the entire traverse off in one day. It was only 15 miles to treeline, which isn't much in the scheme of things until one remembers those are 15 miles in the Whites.
I got up early today. I packed up quickly and ate a small breakfast and got on the trail. 
Mt Washington was the biggest climb and the highest mountain in the northeast. I could see it towering over the rest of the Presidentials. 
The trail followed a long ridge. The warmth of the sun would turn the cold air to steam as it blew over the ridge, creating a continuous cloud that formed when it hit the sunlight, grew large and white over the ridge, then burned itself out a little ways past as it descended. 
The trail summited Mt Pierce, then skirted around the edge of Mt Eisenhower along a steep cliff. At that point I was firmly in the alpine zone, walking through the tundra with no sign of trees or any tall plants to obstruct the view.
On the other side of Mt Monroe was Lake of the Clouds Hut. The Huts in the Whites are lodging for tourists who want to hike but don't want to camp. A bunk is usually around $150 and includes breakfast and dinner. I of course would never pay to stay in one of those places but I did happen to know a little secret. All the food for breakfast and dinner has to be hauled up there by the workers, which means that any leftovers would have to be hauled back down. Unless.....
""How's it going? You looking for some leftovers?"" The guy working there asked before I could even say anything.
He gave me a plate of cold eggs and oatmeal with some lemonade and tea cake. It was excellent by the standards of free food. 
I ate with the Air Jordan's then we all went out to climb Mt Washington. Mt Washington has a weather station at the top which once recorded the highest wind speed not associated with a hurricane. The wind tended to blow at hundreds of miles an hour up there for absolutely no reason. The mountain was downright volatile. 
Thankfully, today the wind was only unpleasant, not dangerous, but I had a bigger concern. In addition to the weather station, a road and a railway have been built to the summit. A gift shop and cafeteria sit at the top and melt down what was good and beautiful about this place line there pockets with what could have been nature.
It's infrastructure, not people, that ruins a place. I've been to some incredibly popular places that are sill kept inaccessible, in the wild, making everyone put in the neccessary effort to get there. The feeling amongst everyone in these places is one of brotherhood, of mutual accomplishment, of adoration for one another. But when there is a road, and a gift shop, and those lazy tourists speed through without actually seeing a thing, then is when a place becomes ""touristy"". It struggles to maintain its status as an emblem and a wonder, instead it becomes a commodity. 
These people will take a picture by the summit sign, look out over a view for a few seconds, probably take a picture of that, buy a sticker that says ""this car climbed Mt Washington"" as if that's something they should be proud of, and leave without having seen a thing. 
There was a line of about 50 people waiting to take a picture at the summit sign. A pile of rocks behind the sign was the actual summit. I moved toward it, but the Air Jordan's went around it.
""You're not gonna climb up this mountain without touching the summit are you?"" I asked them.
""What about the line?"" They asked.
""I have no patience for cowards!"" I answered and we all interrupted someone's photo shoot to touch the summit rock.
Since there was nothing I could do to fight the decline of America and humanity as a whole, I figured I might as well benefit from it, so I bought three slices of pizza and a Dr Pepper. I'm weak, I know. 
Quickdraw caught up with me shortly after and we went down the mountain (it should be noted that as soon as you are off the summit those cravens and their cars vanish and you are once again in a splendid alpine wonderland being blasted with wind and sunshine and beauty). We followed the trail around Mt Clay, Mt Jefferson, and Mt Adams. At Thunderstorm Junction we were joined by Flow, AKA, and a guy whose name I don't know but his husky Crystal soon became my best friend for the day. 
Mt Madison was the final obstacle for the day, the last mountain and last president before we could reenter the realm of the trees and camp for the night. We filled up on water at Madison Spring Hut (they were just starting dinner, we were too early for leftovers) and started the climb. Of all the Presidentials, I think Madison was the hardest. I was clutching the side of the mountain trying to haul myself up through the rocks and cliffs while Crystal was navigating through on her four legs. I got to the top around sunset. Everyone else got out ahead while Quickdraw and I picked our way through the descent. 
I banged my leg on a sharp rock and it started bleeding. My other legs, where the bee had stung me, had swelled up to a massive itchy red welt. I guess that evened them up. 
We managed to hit the treeline just as the light vanished. We found Crystal camping in a small clearing and we set up with them. I slept well knowing we had a guard dog. 
Whatever bit or stung me yesterday, the mark is swelling up on my knee pretty bad. I hope that goes away soon.","Mizpah Spring Hut

Mile 1867.7 to Pinkham Notch
Today I opened my eyes and found Crystal laying under my tarp with me, face to face. She perked up when she noticed I was awake. I unzipped the hammock and patted her head. She stuck her head in with me and I stretched her behind the ears. I miss my dog, it does me good to spend time with any dog though. 
It was the coldest it's been since Virginia, maybe even before that. I can't remember the last time I hiked out of camp with leggings on, much less a knit hat. 
The climb down was pretty bad, my knee was hurting me quite a bit. When it started to warm up I took the leggings off and realized I had a serious problem. The bite/ sting had swelled up to the size of a baseball. It was bright red and burning hot to the touch. My left knee was twice the size of my right. 
""That can't be good"", I thought. 
I had been stung by bees many times in my life and never had a reaction like this, which leads me to think it may have been a spider instead. Spider bites are only good news if you're Peter Parker or Miles Morales. 
I hiked out the rest of the way to Pinkham Notch where Marsha was meeting me for a date. I showed her my knee and she instantly drove me back to her place for a rest.

This morning I couldn't even walk. I had to get around with some hobble that put little weight on my leg and kept it from bending. 
It's probably going to be a double zero if not more for this one. The only good news is that the swelling has gone down a bit and it's a bit less hot. Marsha and I went out to a brewery and drank and ate appetizers all afternoon after she got off work. Solid day.","

Pinkham Notch to Zeta Pass
It feels good to be back on trail and back on my feet again. The swelling is almost gone, the pain is mostly negligible, hell it barely even itches anymore. I'm ready to start knocking miles off again.
Marsha came back to the trail with me and we started our climb of the Wildcats. You know how the Whites are, trail was straight up, lots of Cliffs, great views, all the usual. 
We passed the ski lift at the top of Wildcat D and then climbed to the top of Wildcat Mountain, where we could see Carter Notch Hut and the ponds that surround it. 
We stopped there next for water and then started climbing Carter Dome. I had planned on spending the night at Zeta Pass but now read that it was overused and declared a no camping zone. I thought briefly about why they wouldn't just turn it into a camping area instead of a no camping area but then sadly admitted defeat and decided to stay instead at a spot that's definetly not Zeta Pass. That's right, ignore the top line if this, we are staying at Not Zeta Pass, any indication the reader may have that we are at Zeta Pass they should attribute to their own misinterpretation of the text. Along with anything else you may read in here that seems to imply me breaking the law, the issue is you haven't been paying attention to the literature. 
The funny thing was Not Zeta Pass was an absolute tent city. It was hard to even find a spot to camp. We all crave for that thrill of not breaking the law and not staying at Zeta Pass I'm sure. ","Pinkham Notch

Definitely Not Zeta Pass to Rattle River Trailhead
Another cold morning. Marsha and I stirred awake slowly, along with the crowd that also camped at a spot that is most certainly not Zeta Pass, camping there is illegal you know.
After breakfast we climbed up over South, Middle, and North Carter Mountains, then down to Imp Shelter. I saw Honeyman and Wildflower near there, I didn't even recognize them at first. It's incredible what the trail does to us. 
The descents were, for the most part, the stuff of nightmares, but that's pretty much the usual around here. Horrid straight down descents and ascents have gotten so common I feel like I'm wasting my time even reporting them to you. At this point, unless I say otherwise, you all can just assume every Mountain included Cliffs that tried there best to kill me.
Mt Moriah was the last big peak of the day and the last major peak of the Whites, or so I'm told. The descent was surprisingly mellow, although poorly maintained. Where are those old people rhythmically swinging their weedwackers without the slightest thought of their surroundings, forcing you to time it just right to get by uninjured, jumping past like they are all Crash Bandicoot billions? We need some of those.
A plank I was walking across was rotted and broke under my foot, sending me flying face first down the mountain. I regained myself and kicked away all the rotten wood that I could get to. 
At the bottom we stuck our thumbs out and got picked up by a local who was on his way to Gorham to pick up his daughter from soccer practice. He had a six month old lab puppy in the backseat, so Marsha and I naturally both sat in the back and played with the little guy. His name was Tucker and he loved us both. 
That guy dropped us off in Gorham then we got a ride in the bed of a pickup back to Marshas car and drove that back to town for supper. 
Marsha helped set up in the woods near the trailhead. I might make Maine tomorrow, maybe the next day, but I am close. ","Zeta Pass

Rattle River Trailhead to Trident Col Tentsite
It rained overnight so I slept in to give my stuff a chance to dry out. Marsha made it back and was texting me. I already missed having her there. 
I walked up the road to Rattle River Hostel and struck up a conversation with a thin, long bearded guy and got a shock when we got around to exchanging names. It was 70 Pound Hammer, practically unrecognizable but still on trail. The last time I saw him it was day 4 and we were about to cross Blood Mountain. We were still in Georgia, hadn't even gone 50 miles yet. Now, on day 160 and almost 1900 miles in, we reunited. Hammer has been doing well it would seem. He's grown a massive beard, his pack no longer weighs 70 pounds, and barring serious injury he will make it to Katahdin. Good for him. 
Potholder was there too and we caught up a bit, but the real kicker was seeing Drafty again. I thought Drafty was way ahead of me. I hadn't seen him since PA after Mowgli became Toewgli. 
It was a day of happy reunions it would seem. I actually got a little emotional leaving the hostel. Seeing everyone again felt like a symptom of the hike wrapping up, running into old friends with 300 miles to go. It was like that scene in Jeremiah Johnson when the lead runs into his old friend from the beginning of the movie who taught him how to live in the mountains, and the friend says, ""You've come a long way Pilgrim, were it worth the trouble?""
And Jeremiah looks down and after all he's been through can only think to say ""It weren't no trouble.""
Mountain man movies aside, I had a rather low mile day today, doing about 7 miles out from where I had camped and ending up at Trident Col Campsite, where there is a tent set up bit noone else seems to be here. ","Rattle River Trailhead

Trident Col Tentsite to Carlo Col Shelter
The sky was in some moods today. 
It would continuously flash from bright and sunny to dark and raining without warning. One minute was a nice cool sunshine the next a freezing rain. The worst part was that just as the rocks were about ready to dry another rain cloud would come through and soak them again. 
My goal for the day was Maine. It was there, in striking distance, the place that I and every thru hiker had been speaking of and dreaming about since stepping of Springer. Today was going to be the day.
The northern tip of New Hampshire is guarded by the aptly named Mt Success, which is also ironically the sight of a plane crash. 
As I crested over Success, I turned back for one last look at New Hampshire's peaks. They showed beautifully through the sun, rounded off by the stormy clouds floating about them. New Hampshire was a semi hellish dreamland, a place beautiful beyond words and difficult almost beyond human comprehension. I'll miss it.
Knowing I was about to enter my final state I took a look at my gear and had to laugh at how much had changed. I was on my third set of poles, my fourth pair of shoes. I had a kilt that I didn't start in, a different on, I had gaiters on my feet and a fanny pack that wasn't there before. Really on the outside only my backpack was original, all the way from Georgia, hugging me the whole way there. 
Even my body felt different. My feet had grown a whole size, my legs got huge while the rest of me got slim. My face had a thin beard growing in now, even my glasses were different. My hair was the same.  Marsha was kind enough to brush the dreads that were forming before they became permanent, so there was that at least. 
New Hampshire tried its best to hold its grip just a little longer. There were some steep descents on Cliffs made harder by the wet rock. It all slowed me down, but never stopped me.
When I came to the sign I was a bit overcome by it, a little shakey at the knees. This was my last state border. At the end of this was the mountain, that was all. Georgia to Maine, that much was done. 280 miles would put me on Katahdin and at the end of this thing, but Maine was a major victory all by itself. I took my first steps rather slowly and timidly. Maine, I kept repeating, almost as if trying the word out, Maine. I gave a little laugh, but entered my final state mostly silent. 
Halfway up the hill I heard some screaming by the sign so I joined in that, congratulating myself and whoever was down there.

Carlo Col Shelter to Mile 1919.8
The rain and fog were stubborn this morning. They held on for as long as they could before the bright sunshine showed through, making for a frigid and sunny day. If it gets any colder I'll have to start sleeping with my filter again, the time has come for promiscuity. 
The leaves seem to be almost thinking about changing, the air is cold, I dare say it's fall.
Maine is said to be the hardest state on the trail, thus far that has proves correct. After one day.
The climb up Goose Eye soon gave way to rebar ladders, then bare rock and good luck try to find a handhold. At the top, the wind was so intense it caught my pack and turned me sideways. It was hard to stay on the trail, I kept getting blown over into the fragile tundra. 
I was trying my very best to hurry. I was basically out of food. I had one Mac and Cheese (and praise Vishnu for that) and a few granola bars and that was it. I would have to ration out today's food, still only about half of what I'd normally eat, and get to Grafton Notch at all costs. The problem was that Mahoosuc Notch laid in between me and the road. 
It was 14 miles out from camp, which on a normal day should have been easy. Today was not a normal day. 
I fought my way through the alpine bogs (I heard a hiker call it ""Bogwarts"") and came out with wet feet. At least here the boards were mostly unbroken and above water, and not posing a serious risk to the lives and limbs of every hiker who dares step on them.
I want to take a moment to thank the Maine Appalachian Trail Club for actually caring for and repairing there bog boards.
I would also like to say a few words about the Appalachian Mountain Club, which is responsible for trail maintenance in New Hampshire, but sadly this websites terms and conditions prohibit such vile language, and it's just not politically correct anymore to use such diction. Please accept the following as a symbolic gesture of what I think of your utter incompetentance:
¿•■~::
Hope that clears it up. Fix the damn boards AMC.
Anyway, so with wet feet I climbed down toward Mahoosuc Notch and ate my last granola bar before I entered. It was 3:00, plenty of time to get to Grafton and the road if I made good time through this mile.
I did not.
Mahoosuc Notch is the self described ""hardest mile on the AT"". It's sort of a thru hiker boogeyman, it's what young hikers check under their beds for so they can go to sleep. It haunts our dreams, crushes our hopes and aspirations. Churches have been started to pray against it, entire nations have fought it and fallen before its might, the behemoth Balrog that fought Gandalf would run in terror if he could see it.
It's actually not that bad, it's kind of fun. Or at least that's what I told myself when I first entered. I put my poles in my bag, they would do me no good here. This was a mile of car to house sized boulders gathered up in the bottom of a narrow canyon. Hikers, if we can still be called that, are forced to clambor up, over, around, under, and through the maddening maze of ancient rock. 
More then once I climbed over the top of a boulder, threw my pack down to the other side, turned around, and had to go and climb through a different way to get my body through. I inched my way through small caves and arches, dragging my pack behind me. It was a day of grabbing roots and trees, hanging on for dear life, sliding and scratching myself, some real rugburn, and strain on every part of my body. 
It's honestly a miracle that I didn't dislocate my shoulder. 
It was exhausting, especially since I was out of food. Nearly defeated by the Notch (which I've heard described as ""Notchy"", work that word into your life readers) I slumped down and checked the distance. I wasn't even halfway yet, and I'd been in there over an hour. 
Mahoosuc Notch killed any chance I had of getting to Grafton today. It took me almost two and a half hours to do a single mile. 
I ate my Mac and Cheese and hiked as far as I could up Mahoosux arm before the sun went down. In the end I only made it 8 miles today, the rest will have to be done tomorrow, and on an empty stomach.","Carlo Col Shelter

Mile 1919.8 to Grafton Notch 
The way circumstances can change out here so fast is astounding. Last night I had miles to go, no food, an empty stomach, and then just before bed I got a text from Marsha. She had a sudden day off, she wanted to come out and see me for a day. I asked her to bring food.
So it ended up that I was handed a cinnamon roll and a chicken wrap at Speck Pond and found myself with enough energy to get to Grafton Notch, where we went to town for pizza, beer, and ice cream. Great day.
The exciting thing about Grafton Notch is that this is where the map ends. I've had to once again switch to a new map, but this map ends on Katahdin. I've reached the final guthooks map.","Mile 1919.8

It rained hard overnight but I awoke to sunshine. When I packed up someone had set up trail magic in the parking lot. I used his chair to put on my shoes and an old man named Slow Stepper made me two hot dogs and gave me an orange juice. 
Slow Stepper kept bragging about his wife cookies, saying ""she puts something in them that you can't have just one, you can't stop eating them!"" 
To me, that sounded like cocaine (which I've never done but that's what it seems like to me) but I didn't say that, I just took two cookies and told him they were delicious. They were. It was a happy morning.
I've been plagued by pains in my right foot since Pennsylvania. Yesterday Marsha looked at my foot and said I had a wart. For some reason, I brushed off the comment. But today, as I was hiking and my foot was hurting me in that same usual spot, it occurred to me that a wart right there would have the potential to cause serious pains. That's all it was the whole time? Just a wart. How many long days did I skip out of because of a wart. Next time I get to town, I'm freezing the thing off. 
Today's climb up Baldplate was the easiest I've seen since Vermont. It felt good to actually walk up a mountain for a change, no more climbing for now.
At the top of West Baldplate you can look over and see East Baldplate. I sat and enjoyed the view before hiking over to it. 
At the top of the East peak I looked to my left and saw a wall of rain and thunder coming at me. I ran as fast as I could down the smooth rock, not wanting to do that descent in the rain. When the storm hit it was intense. Depp pools of water filled the trail, I got soaked, and thunder started crashing. The only thing to do was hike on.
Yukon and Stuff talked me into making a reservation at a hostel tomorrow, so I've got laundry and a bed to look forward to.","Grafton Notch

Dunn Cascades to The Cabin
Today was a comparatively easy day, at least the first half was. Semi flat miles out past a small lake and up over Wyman Mountain, then a sharp drop to the next water source. I saod hi to a southbounder who was filtering water, crossed the river and stopped to fill up. Poptart and Bananas came by and also stopped to filter water, and Poptart made the obscure observation that hikers always cross the stream before filling up their water. 
I looked ba k at the Southbounder, looked at all of us, and then thought back to the hundreds of times that I had to get water and I realized she was right. But why?
We proposed several theories. Maybe we knew that full water would throw off the balance of our packs, making us more likely to fall in unless we crossed first. Maybe we subconsciously wanted to get a closer look at the water before we drank it. Maybe we all hate stopping and wanted to press on just a bit further before having to take our packs off. It's a bit of hiker psychology that may be worth examination by a professional some day.
We had all been warned about Mt Moody, but compared to what we had all been through in the previous state, it was nothing. Just a bit steep. Some people point out that Maines climbs are so steep they had to install rebar, but they fail to realize that New Hampshire's climbs are also so steep they require rebar, except New Hampshire doesn't give you the rebar. 
From the top of Moody I called The Cabin where I had made reservations yesterday, they said they would be in their way to pick me up. 
A young lady named Rusty came and got me. She thru hiked back in 2019 and stayed at the Cabin, loving the place so much she decided to come back and help run it. She referred to The Cabins owner Honey as her ""trail grandmother"". 
We stopped at a store so I could get some cash but the atm was broken, not a problem I could come back in the morning, and then went back to the hostel where supper was on the table. 
Honey was sitting at the head of the table, 92 years old and the life of the party. She cooked us chicken, potatoes, rolls, salad, corn on the cob, and brownies for desert. She told us all about how her and her late husband hiked the trail and wanted to stay part of the hiker community so they bought this house, which was ""the most run down and gross place you've ever seen"" and turned it into something beautiful.
The phone rang and Rusty answered it, after a few words she hung it up and told Honey ""Odie and Nimblewill just got out, they made it through the notch and they are on their way back"". 
Those names struck me ""Odie and Nimblewill are staying here?"" 
""They are,"" Honey answered with her usual smiling grace, ""you'll see them at breakfast tomorrow.""
After supper I went back downstairs and read a book I found on the shelf while my laundry went through the machines, no more dirty wet socks for me. ","Dunn Cascades

The Cabin to Bemis Mountain Road
In the morning, just like Honey said, Odie and Nimblewill sat at the breakfast table drinking coffee and eating eggs and bacon. 
Nimblewill is a man you have to respect. At 82 years old, he is currently working on setting the record for the oldest thru hiker ever. Even more impressive is the fact that he did the Pinhoti Trail before reaching reaching Springer and the fact that he claims to have accumulated over 30,000 miles on the AT in his lifetime. This will be his third thru hike and without a doubt his most famous.
Odie, much younger and with a much shorter beard, is one of the people that keeps the trail community so closely tied. After his thru hike in 2013, Odie found that he had no way of contacting a lot of his friends, especially since he only knew then by their trail names, so he started a project called ""The Hiker Yearbook"". Just like a high-school Yearbook, it has everyone's names, various pictures throughout the trail, and an option to include contact info. Everyone can order one of these books at the end of the season. Now Odie follows the bubble every year in his converted school us, being a trail angel and hiking short sections along the way. He is a staple of trail culture.
Nimblewill is taking a zero today. He's earned it. Yesterday in the Notch, he took a few bad falls, scrapes, bruises, and had a few near death experiences. Odie caught him and probably saved his life on more then one occasion, he got so worked up about it he gave himself a terrible migraine and was puking for the last quarter of a mile, but the two of them made it out. 
Odie drove me back to the trail in his bus. On the way we passed a stop sign with a sticker on it with a four letter word starting with F, then the name of a certain politician.
""Man, there's old ladies driving home from church in this town, they don't need to be seeing that!"" Odie proclaimed and got out a bottle of super glue and a sticker that said ""meow"". He put the glue in the back and stuck the sticker over the obscene one, sparring all the old ladies the gutter talk. Best if all, if anyone tried to peel it back off, the super glue would ensure the other sticker came with it. I knew right then I liked Odie, he shares my passion for morally conscious mischeif.
The arrival of Odie proceeded a party. Hikers came out of the woods everywhere when they saw the famous bus. AARP, Babyhands, Yukon, Stuff, August West, countless others crowded around. Odie gave out cookies.
The next climb was brutal, 1500 feet straight up. My foot ached the entire way. Back when I thought the pain in my foot was the result of overuse of some muscle, it could be tolerated, as it was inevitable, but now that I know it's a wart and can be cured I can't stand it, it has to go. 
Add to the the fact that tomorrow is predicted to be a torrential downpour, and it seemed like a great day for a zero, and I knew just the person to sweet talk into picking me up.
You may have noticed that I have been abusing the concept of the zero, I noticed as well. It may be that I'm just tired and don't feel like hiking, it may be that I have someone nearby now that I want to spend time with, but I think the biggest thing is simply that I know the more miles I put in now the sooner this thing will end. Here I am, trying to extend my hike by way of laziness. I just have to make sure I don't go too far with it.

I tried my best to freeze off that wart on my foot. If it comes off, I'll he the happiest man on the trail.
I ate bibimbap and saw Ms. Janet in town. When Marsha drove me back to the trail I asked her if she just wanted to stay and she said yes, so the two of us spent the night sleeping in the back of her car. 
It was terribly uncomfortable and I woke up every half hour or so with my hips and back aching. It was well worth it. ","

Bemis Mountain Road to Little Swift River Pond
Marsha got me up at 5 am when she had to drive back to work. I got up and climbed in my hammock and napped there until the rain stopped. I didn't pack up and leave camp until almost noon.
There was a small climb right away after crossing a stream. The climb led up to an overlook called the Height Of Land. Glorious place with a view over a massive lake.
Otherwise, there were no climbs today. No real descents either. Not once did I have to use my hands or take off my trekking poles. I've almost forgotten what it was like to simply walk for an entire day. What a joy.
Passing by Long Pond I was stunned by a familiar sound. It was waves. The pond was so big that waves were actually breaking on the shore. I ran down to the shore and was even more surprised to find a sandy beach. It was only three feet long but the sand stretched out as far as I could see. I wished it was warm enough for a swim, nevermind the leeches. 
The sound of waves breaking and the feeling of sand took me back. It felt like forever since I was on a real beach, even longer since I had seen the ocean. In fact, I don't think I've seen the ocean since the pandemic began, the last time I saw it was probably in Cambodia when Creech I stole a kayak (borrowed really, we paid for it all day and simply didn't see why that payment wouldn't cover the night as well) to go see the glowing plankton in the ocean without any light pollution. We rowed out into the still darkness and jumped in, holding onto the kayak as the water around us lighting up a bright electric blue every time we moved. We were like lightning in the water. I got stung by a sea urchin and we got yelled at for taking the kayak, but it was magical, I'd do it again in a heartbeat. 
I opened my eyes on the lakeshore, back to this year and this place. Daydreaming won't get me to Katahdin. I left the beach and hiked on until I came to another lake, this one having a bunch of canoes sitting on the bank. I thought about taking one out but ultimately decided to just set up camp instead. As far as I can tell the canoes seem to just be there free for anyone to use, which is a beautiful concept.
Tomorrow I have the Saddlebacks to cross over, which I'm told is a hell of a climb but also marks a transition to generally easier terrain until the end.
I laid in my hammock just after dark and felt the cold creeping in. I resisted. The leaves are now distinctly changing, the winds are growing colder, and that only means one thing when you're a backpacker. If I could simply will the weather above freezing I would, but sadly we mere humans have no such power. I finally gave in, the mountains have defeated me. I grabbed my filter and scornfully put it in my sleeping bag. For the first time since that snowy day in Virginaia, I have a dribble of water on me and an awkward peice of wet plastic sleeping with me.","Bemis Mountain Road

Little Swift River Pond to Redington Stream Campsite 
I slept pretty well, despite that accursed filter joining me under my quilt. The cold morning air had me putting off packing up, but of course that can only last so long. 
I was just walking out of camp when a single engine plane buzzed above me. I looked up and saw that it was a ski plane. In all the travels I've done, I don't think I've ever seen a ski plane fly. I can now confirm, they do exist.
Today is Corey's birthday (what a horrible day for a birthday) so I messaged him and told him to enjoy. 
The colors in the leaves are exploding now, the forest is alight with bright reds and yellows and oranges. I like the way leaves think. They answer death with life. They don't just fade away quietly, they spend their last days showing off all their beauty and grace and color, shunning that repressive chlorophyll and living a little. We should all be more like leaves.
The first half of my day was spent on flat and slightly downhill ground, then I crossed the road and started heading back up again, working my way up Saddleback. 
The climb was steep and long, but really nothing special. The views on the other hand, those were special. 
The Saddlebacks are a long alpine ridge that carries on above treeline for miles with 360 degree views from the top. I gave my usual look back toward the Whites, every time a mixture of admiration and pure relief that I'm out of there, but then I looked to the north.
The Crockers and the Bigelows were of course visible, but I couldn't help myself, I looked beyond them. It was now 200 miles to Katahdin, but those were trail miles. How far could it be as the crow flies? 100? 150? You can easily see a mountain 100 miles away on a clear enough day, especially a freestanding behemoth like The Greatest Mountain, but alas, the hills had it blocked, or maybe it was just too far away. It won't be long now, Katahdin will be in sight and I suppose I will weep.
I climbed down the Saddleback and up the Horn, just in time for a beautiful sunset, then down the other side in the dark to the campsite, which every guthooks comment seems to suggest is as haunted as it gets. If this campsite needs an exorcism, it won't be getting it from me, I am tired and I ain't scared of nothing.
So today marks 20 years since 9/11 became 9/11. What can a person possibly say at this point that hasn't already been said about such a tragedy? I don't have a lot I can say about that to be honest, at least not much of value, but I feel like I should say something. Never forget, never place blame where it doesn't belong, never let it happen again here or anywhere. Never lose hope in humanity, remember for every person trying to burn the world there are ten trying to make it better. Be one of those people trying to make it better. That's all any of us can do, and enough of us can really do that, it's all we'll ever need to do. Sleep well and be thankful for what you have everyone.","Little Swift River Pond

Redington Stream Campsite to Spaulding Mountain Shelter 
I slept in.
Didn't leave camp until 10:30
Straight out if camp was the climb up Saddleback Junior. It was cloudy and gloomy looking when I left camp, but once I got to the top of Jr I could see that the Saddlebacks were capped by a big circle of cloud and all around it was sunshine. Our topcoat of doom simply rested atop the peaks and it would be nice once I got out from under it, unless it followed me.
The rest of the day was a long slow descent followed by a long slow ascent. At the very bottom was a river crossing where I rock hopped across and filled up. There was the remains of a smashed up boat lying against the rocks on the river, smashed so hard it was nearly flat. I can only imagine what kind of floods or storms destroyed that boat and hope another doesn't come. 
One very positive addition to the trail that Maine had made is the red squirrels. Twice as energetic and thrice as mischievous as the Grey's, these little rapscallions are continually hopping above, below, and to the side if me, creating chaos wherever they go. I could watch the little rascals all day, and most of the time I do. They are the trails equivalent to television.
I made it to Spaulding Mountain Lean-to right at dark. I hate that they're called lean tos here so I'm going to keep calling them shelters, that's what they're called for litterally the entire rest of the trail, you don't get to rename them Maine. 
So I got to the shelter and noone was there except Great Dane. We talked a bit then he went off to bed. I sat cooking when another guy came out if the woods and joined me in the shelter. His name was Mohawk. We sat and talked about our travels for hours, he was a really interesting guy, I hope I see him more.","Redington Stream Campsite

I talked more with Mohawk over breakfast. We both sat and ate while staring north, knowing the benchmarks that awaited us today.
I climbed most of the way up Spaulding and around the summit and came to the first, a completion marker marking the spot where the trails joined and made one big trail, the last part of the trail to be built.
Immediately after that came another, 200 miles to Maine. I sat there a moment and thought about how I could push 20s from here on out and I'd be done in 10 days. I won't, probably, but if I really to I could. Odds are pretty good I'll be done in 2 weeks either way.
The biggest milestone wouldn't come until later. The trail dropped sharply off the side of the mountain and I gave my poles a toss before climbing down like I had a thousand times. This time, however, one of my poles hopped back up and sprung its way out off the trail into the thick brush. I went on quite the extensive rescue mission to get it back.
I crossed the river at the bottom with Great Dane and gave him a small pep talk before climbing up Crocker (FAIRY GOD PARENTS!) and reaching the south peak, then the north.
As a side note about Crocker, we really don't give the guy enough credit, he's without a doubt the smartest man in that shows universe. He's the only one who managed to figure out that fairies were real and that Timmy had them, now that is impressive. It has nothing at all to do with the trail but it was impressive, you go Mr. Crocker you were right all along.
So anyway, I crossed over the top of Crocker and waited for the viewpoint down the other side. At last, the trees cleared and the moment I had been waiting for since Georgia was upon me. Right there in front of me, spelled out in little rocks, was the number 2,000. I had come 2,000 miles now, it was official. What a feeling to have hiked 2,000 miles. I laughed, laughed uncontrollably at all I had been through and all the people I'd met, at the sheer absurdity of it all and at myself for even doing it. 
It was a good time to celebrate so I booked a private room in a hostel in Kingsfeild. The guy who answered the phone said his name was Loren.
""Lion?"" I asked.
""No no, it's Loren""

ME RT. 27 to East Flagstaff Road.
In the morning I went downstairs and got a cup of coffee. The hostel was an old farmhouse that Loren had renovated and redecorated. It was one of those places that was full of surprises, the more you looked around the more you found the odd little knick knacks and subtle little messages all around. The house got more interesting the longer you were there.
""Morning Lorne,"" I said to Loren. He grabbed himself a cup of coffee and the two of us headed back out to the trail.
Loren dropped me off at the road where I had gotten off and told me to text him from the top. I said ""Thanks Lonn"" and he drive away.
The first mile was flat easy and cold. I sat and warmed up in the sun on the Dick Brown Bridge (haha) and then started the climb. The Bigelows were the final 4k peaks until Katahdin. After them it was all smooth sailing, a long flat stroll to the end. 
That said, they weren't a hard climb compared to what came before. What was most exciting was the top, up above the treeline. For one thing it was probably the most beautiful view in the state if not on the entire trail. On top of that, you could see Katahdin. Now let's play a round of ""every distant peak is Mt Katahdin"". Dozens of mountains were the one at various times, some were all the way over in Canada, but after some looking and thinking I think I got it figured out.
The first look at Katahdin, the end is now quite literally in sight. It doesn't feel real. It's been fat enough away for so long now that it feels like an abstract concept. I've already accepted this as my new life, it doesn't feel like it just ends at some point. 
I've talked about it with other hikers, and there's two things we can speculativley compare it to. An institutionalized prisoner about to be released and a really old person who knows they will die soon. Both of those are on a much greater scale of course, but maybe finishing the trail is like the diet version of dying. I'll see. I hope I can't readjust to the world. I hope I've gone feral.
I headed down, looking around at all the peaks and lakes as much as I could but mostly looking out towards Katahdin.
At the top of Little Bigelow I met a guy (and never got his name) and we hiked down together. He was an older man from the south, but he had some stories. He'd seen Flogging Molly and the Dropkick Murphys, he'd trained with Gurkhas when he was in the army, he told me once he almost joined the French Foreign Legion (which is apparently no longer allowed on French soil) just because he felt like he needed an adventure. I liked him, the walk down went by quickly.
I got back to Loren at the bottom and he drove me back to the hostel. Tomorrow is to have some miserable weather, and on top of that I have two job interviews. Sounds like a perfect day for a zero.","Terrapin Hostel

Zero at Terrapin Hostel 
In the morning I sat with another Hostel stayed (I really need to work on getting more names) and drank some coffee. I told him I had the interview coming up that morning and he said he'd leave me the whole downstairs. 
I set up my phone and waited for the zoom call to start. Then I looked down and remembered I had a tattoo of a stick figure riding a bison getting abducted by aliens on my forearm. I panicked. I ran out, and thankfully Loren was there.
""Lauren! I need a long sleeved shirt, have you got one?""
""I got you man""
Loren brought me a blue long-sleeved, very professional. So professional in fact I was soon offered the job in Jackson Hole.
The other interview was to be back in Yellowstone. It's hard to choose between your best friends and the place you've come to know and love and call home. The best thing to do is stack up one side. Jackson Hole had the money, it had Creech and Corey, maybe even our friend Kyle, it had some delicious Thai food and good pizza, and most importantly, I talked Maraha into going there with me. It was the obvious choice. 
So, now that I'm officially employed, I bought some stout and had myself a bath. 
I had a few beers with Slayer and Popeye. Slayer flipped up to Katahdin, she's almost at mile 1500 in her hike, and she's about to quit. It didn't seem to be a rash decision either, she seemed to have thought it through. I'd normally try to talk someone into staying, but knowing what she has coming southbound I don't know if anyone can make it through that with anything less then sheer concentrated power of will, so I left her to her decisions, but I did tell her she should at least hit the Bigelows and Saddlebacks, maybe those will change her mind.
Popeye had a hell of a story. I think he was a bit drunk and sharing more then he intended. He had been hiking last year and made it as far as Boiling Springs PA, where he was attacked by a dog. A week later the bite on his thigh was infected and in nonstop pain. He got off trail to let it heal, and ended up home with his mother for a few months. He says that's the best thing that could have happened, because those months would be the last he'd ever spend with her. His father ended up killing his mother. 
Slayer and I had nothing to say to that, there's not much you can say. We sat and listened. I understood that the trail was his escape. He'd have a hard time when he got home, but for now, he could be in a different world. 
I made some tortellini with chicken sausage and the three of us shared a bit of a meal. It wasn't much, but it was food, and hikers love food. 
We spent some time looking through the hostel, finding all the little surprises scattered about. I really like it here, but Katahdin is calling. Back on trail tomorrow.","

In the morning I said bye to Loren and some guy named Matt drove me and Popeye back to the trail. I hiked out around a few lakes and came to some orange tape. A note was written below the tape that just said ""bees!"" And I almost ducked under it until I saw a giant hornets nest hanging four feet above the trail. 
It was the perfect height to walk straight into if you weren't paying attention. I walked well around the thing.
Mohawk came along from behind and I started talking with him again. He's lived a thousand lives and has a million stories, plus he's a bellman just like me. I wonder if I'll be like him when I'm 50, I'm well on my way already to be honest. I can already answer his travel stories 2 to 1. We made a good team the rest of the day.
Mohawk was feeling determined and I was easily swept up by the concept of miserable and unnecessary adventure. We soon talked eachother into hiking the entire way to Shaw's, the famous hostel before the Hundred Mile Wilderness. That would be 58 miles, we'd have to hike all through the night and all the next day. There was just one problem, The Kennebec.
The Kennebec River is the largest river on trail without a bridge. The historic route is across a canoe ferry, provided free and running from 9 am to 2 pm. We wouldn't get there until 9 pm. Mohawk was determined to ford the river. I was in, but I was wary of the cold water and the fact that the water level changes rapidly due to the dam upstream. They apparently usually don't release the dam at night, but it was still enough to work on our nerves a bit. 
We found Popeye and told him our plans. He said we were crazy and he was going to stay and camp. 
We got to the river after dark. He could see our breath in the cold air in front of our headlamps.
""You can swim, right?"" Mohawk asked.
""Yeah"" I said.
""Good, I heard the guy that died couldn't swim"", Mohawk responded.
""Someone died?"" 
Mohawk shrugged. We had decided to try, but at the same time we weren't willing to get our packs wet. We would try to cross but if it got deep we could camp on the other side.
I stood there in the freezing water while Mohawk plunged ahead. We made it about halfway, shivering and always watching the water level out of the corner of our eyes, ready to bail and leave our packs and swim to shore if needs be.  
Mohawk was up to his waist, I was only up to my knees. He started cursing the river. It got deeper, a lot deeper, right in front of him. We hatched up some plan to go back to shore, take our clothes off and hike with our packs on top of our heads, but then that plan was abandoned. We went to shore and set up camp, and ate a good meal. The Kennebec had defeated us, but we still had a 20 mile day to show for it. I slept good that night.","East Flagstaff Road

Mohawk and I slept in today and didn't get up until just before 9. Popeye cam up from the south and the canoe guy came down from the north at almost the same time and Popeye and I took the first ride of the day across the river.
I dipped my hand in the water and was surprised by how warm it was. It occurred to me that where Mohawk and I tried to cross was a spot where a major Brooke entered and formed a delta, and that influx of water was probably why it was so cd last night.
The canoe guy went back for Mohawk and for my water bottle which I had left. I noticed that there was a blaze in the bottom of the canoe.
Popeye went out ahead and Mohawk and I lagged a but. AT the road crossing, a van from the Sterling in saw us, pulled up, slowed down a bit, then when he got close he sped up and got away from us as fast as he could. I've read on Guthooks that the guy from the Sterling Inn is very judgemental and will only pick up the more straight laced looking hikers. Mohawk is covered head to toe in tattoos, has an absolutely massive and glorious beard, and obviously a Mohawk. I haven't cut my hair in over 7 years, haven't shaved since Virginia and I'm wearing a kilt. We didn't fit the bill. We had a good laugh about it and went on. We didn't actually want to go to town anyway. 
The trail was perfectly level until it wasn't. Even with this new trend of barely any elevation gain, we had to deal with a 1,000 foot climb. That was where I left Mowhawk, I had some thing to take care of of and he was hiking all through the night for a zero at Shaws. I got his number and promised to meet him there.
Marsha text me, she coming out for a visit. I hiked until dark and then kept on hiking. I rockhopped across a river in the pitch black and found Popeye on the other side. I saod hi and kept on moving.
Marsha showed up by the light of her headlamp, and she had a pizza.
We sat in the middle of the dark woods and ate. I heard a strange noise which I believe was a moose. We hiked back to Marshas car and she got out her hammock, which had finally arrived in the mail just today. We plan to hammock the PCT, for better or worse I refuse to go back to living in a tent and she's with me on this. We had a good time figuring all the things out and soon had a brand new warbonnet setup for her.","Kennebec River

Today was an exercise in laziness and procrastination. Marsha and I tore down camp and sat in her car a bit, and I simply refused to go hike. I managed to procrastinate so hard that a few drops of rain hit the windshield and we decided it was time to go to town for a blueberry soda.
We didn't roll out until 5. The trail climbed straight up Moxie Bald where we got a bright and fabulous sunset then a long hike down in the dark. We set up camp and I ate 8 servings of Mac and cheese.","Bald Mountain Brooke Shelter

Marsha left to go back to her car and I turned north to go to the Hundred Mile Wilderness.
It was perhaps the easiest day on the entire trail, I passed ponds and heard loons and had no worries. 
I walked into Monson for absolutely no reason and bought my last resupply. I went all out, buying practically nothing but freeze dried meals. Cost me a small fortune but I am sick of Knorr, I'm eating good. 
I went and said hi to Poet and Hippie Chick. Amazingly enough, Hippie Chick actually remembered me from North Carolina where they give me and Jill a bag of wine. 
The two of them run the hostel here and the best resupply store on the whole trail. I would have loved to stay the night but I'm filled with this anxious restlessness. I need to hike on.
I just need to get on top of Katahdin, then I can relax. With only a 120 miles to go, I'm too close to the end now. Finishing has always been my weakness. Look around my spaces you'll find hoardes of unfinished stories, beginnings of songs, drawings missing vital components. When I play pool, I will sometimes run the table but I will never sink the 8 ball. 
Now I'm consumed by some outlandish fear that I will fall and break my legs, get struck by lightning, get caught in some freak snowstorm that closes the mountain, contract malaria, be kidnapped by the Russian Mafia, be taken away by aliens, dismembered by a moise, or simply die without cause. All of those things can happen after the summit, I do not care, but I need to get to the end. 
I crossed over the border of the hundred mile wilderness in the dark. I fumbled around and tried to find the trail for a few hours before setting up in the first shelter all by myself. ","Bald Mountain Stream

I don't know how it happened. I woke up early, I hit the trail, I stayed focused, I kept hiking. I only went 10 miles. 
There's no reason for this whatsoever. I can't even think of where the time was spent. 
I left the shelter and passed a few lakes, said hi to August West who keeps showing up lately, went to a waterfall for lunch, crossed a few logging roads, climbed a few hills, and that was the day. 
I am going to bed early tonight at least and getting up before daylight tomorrow, or at least that's what I'm telling myself. Four 21s will get me out of the Hundred Mile Wilderness, that's what I'm going to try for. Whether I will succeed we will have to see, no doubt today was a failure as far as miles go. ","Leeman Brooke Lean-To

Vaughn Stream to Mile 2106.5
A mile after leaving camp, I came across two things of note. One was a stream that required me to take off my shoes to cross. The other was a small island in the middle of that stream with a taped off hornets nest. I made it through both without much issue. 
Next came a surprisingly long and steep climb. I was beginning to worry that the entire 100 Mile Wilderness would be harder then advertised. My food supply grew increasingly inadequate with each slow mile, it was beginning to seem obvious I had to do something. I started asking everyone I saw what their plans were, thinking I could get an idea of what was happening to everyone else and see what I could come up with.
There was a stunning view from atop Barren Mountain. The leaves changing was now more prominent then ever. Suddenly the forest below was alive in a patchwork of color.
Three girls at the top asked me if anyone had ever told me I talked like John Mulaney. I said yes. They asked me to say several of his quotes and giggled whenever I complied. 
Shortly thereafter was the 2100 mark. I expected a string emotional reaction to my final hundred mile mark, but it wasn't there. Instead there was simply a calm acceptance. Apparently I'm taking the stoic route to the end.
The three girls were there again and one told me a fine story about how when she was a child she thought Toy Story was real and her parents found her dunking her toys heads underwater in the toilet, trying to torture them into talking. It didn't work, but it did terrify her parents.
I checked my phone at the top and found several messages from people on Yellowstone, all shocked that I wouldn't be returning for the winter season. The trail had taught me not to linger too long in a comfortable place, and that was just what I had been doing out there. My job and my place in the community would fade until I was a stranger, every year a little more. 
I finally broke down and admitted to myself that I simply didn't have enough food to make it. I called Shaws and Hippie Chick answered and said she was driving out to Jo-Mary Road (one of the few navigable roads out here) almost every day and she could drop me off some food. I don't doubt that she has saved thousands of hikers in her time in this section, what would we all do without her.
Low Rider showed up in front of me and I passed her, crossed over a bog on some boards, followed the blazes around through a trail in the trees, and came to more bog boards. I looked up and saw Low Rider once again out ahead. 
I asked how she did that as I crossed the bog boards. She looked at me in utter confusion, then I noticed I was on the same boards I had crossed moments ago. Further inspection revealed more blazes climbing up the cliff instead of to the left. What a cruel and hilarious joke, someone had built and blazed a trail that led you in a circle!. Someone not paying attention could find themselves circling all day.
I noticed toward dark that my headphones were gone. I decided to leave it to chance. I went to the shelter and gave the southboundeds my number in case they find them. Then I hiked until 10. 
Easy and French Fry were just ahead of me and I could see their wet footprints on the rocks, somewhat comforting as I was hiking alone in the dark. Several times I came to vista's and shut off my headlamp to enjoy them by the moonlight. It was a warm night.","Vaughn Stream

Mile 2106.5 to Logan Brooke Lean-To 
It was a fairly easy down to a dirt road that cut through the area. I filled my water and took a break there, hoping a car would come by with some trail magic, but nothing ever came. 
It was cloudy and dreary today. This contributed to a rather sour mood amongst all the hikers, including myself, today. It was raining slightly as I did the obligatory river crossing that comes every morning in the Hundred Mile. I checked for leeches (I've yet to find one) and moved on. 
I saw the girls who pointed out I was sitting under a widow maker. I told them if it fell on me maybe I would die and wouldn't have to hike. They thought that was hilarious.
I powered up the first mountain. The rationing of food over the last few days has me feeling weaker. I'm not eating enough. 
At the top I found water looked to me like apple trees but none of them bore any fruit. Was it too late already? Was I just bad at identifying trees? I didn't know, but I knew an apple tree would be a relief beyond measure. 
These peaks were the last until Katahdin, and that was the real motivator. I could almost whisper it to myself and my speed would go up, my spirits would lift. Katahdin, Katahdin, it's finally right around the corner.
The sun set faster then I would have guessed. White Cap was the last peak of the day, the last real peak until the end actually, and from the top was the first good look at Katahdin. I ran up it, as much as I could. The sunset was the not bright sort, the kind that fades from grey to black with no real colors. On top of that, there was fog and mist everywhere. I didn't know if I would see the mountain even if I made it before dark. 
The top was open and blasted with wind. It knocked me off balance. The kind of wind that grabs your pack and turns you around. I fought my way to the viewpoint and braced myself on a rock. At first I saw nothing out in the clouded expanse. But the clouds parted just a bit before dark. My heart raced as my eyes lit up. There it was, a dark shadow looming over the land, a single mountain that towered over everything. It looked close enough to reach. I told it I was coming 
I made it into camp with some of the worst aching feet I've ever had. It was clearly a muggle camp at the shelter. The remains of a fire were a dead giveaway, no NOBO at least bothers with those anymore. .
I actually did a pretty awful job at setting up my hammock, the angle was too steep, the trees were too close together, I almost didn't even bother with the rain fly which would have been a big mistake, but oh well I will suffer. My feet hurt and I am tired and hungry, therefore I do not care","

Logan Brooke Lean-To to Jo-Mary Road 
Putting up the tarp turned out to be a good idea, it's rained on and off all night. Worse then the rain, I was afflicted with dreams that it was raining on my hammock. You ever have dreams like that? Where it hits you as soon as you fall asleep and jolts you awake, and then hits you again as soon as you start to doze off again and you spend the whole night locked in this endless cycle? Kinda sucks.
What doesn't suck is that I woke up to blue skies. It was a warm and sunny morning, reflecting off the wet leaves. 
Even better, I had one more small bump to go over then it was essentially flat the whole way to Katahdin. No more 5,000 feet every ten miles, now it was 5,000 over the next 50 miles. It was time to relax and press on.
Even better, my food drop was coming tomorrow. I almost said no to it but I broke down and paid the $40, why not enjoy the last few days of my hike?
The flat and simple terrain leaves the mind time to wander. The thing you can't do is think about after the trail. When those thoughts of laying on the couch and eating an unlimited supply of food that you don't have to carry and drinking water without having to filter it and taking a bath in water that's not cold and having as much electricity as you want and not having to set up camp every night and.... what was I saying?
Yeah, when those thoughts take over you can't get them out of your head and they make you oddly weak. Hiking seems unbearable. It's much better to think of the past, all the trail I've gone through, everything I've seen and experienced and survived along the way. Those thoughts give me strength. 
If course the immediate future carries the greatest weight. I don't even know how to think about Katahdin. I've been dreaming about that mountain for as long as I can remember, and now I've glimpsed it, but what it will feel like to climb it is anyone's guess. There's a certain thrill to Tye thought.
The very best thing to do, I've decided, is stay here in the present. There's so much to appreciate in this place. The trail is flat and has few rocks, the leaves are changing and adding so much color, the sun is shining, there is good camping also the entire way along the trail (which I've come to oddly appreciate, even if I'm not camping there good stealth sites make me happy), and I can hear water flowing. 
It's to rain over the weekend, Monday will probably be my summit day. There will be a six month anniversary, I'm not submitting on a rainy day. Six months and a day, most likely. 
I stopped at Jo-Mary Road and saw a car, been a bit since I've seen one of those, and I sat on the bridge with my shoes off until dark. There's time now to enjoy the small things. I'll take in as much as I can while I can, it's nice of the trail to give you this time to reflect as you cruise toward your destination.","Logan Brooke Lean-To

I sat in my hammock in the rain and waited for Poet to bring my food drop. He came and gave me a free coke and a PBR.
The rain stopped when I tore down and started hiking. The ground on the second half of the 100 mile is flat, and you can cruise right through.
At Antlers Campsite I got some surprise texts. Dad is already on his way up, and he's got a campsite Sunday night at Katahdin Stream, the last place to camp right at the base of the mountain. 
I cracked open the beer Poet brought me and ate most of my food. I didn't have to conserve anymore, Dad was coming and I would have all I needed. 
He'd been out hunting elk in Colorado with his cousins for the last month or two, so it's been a while since I'd seen him, and I suppose he couldn't stand it any longer. I told him where to meet me that night.
It got foggy while I was walking. Looking out over the lakes was like staring into and endless white void.
By the time I got there it had started to rain again. Dad ran out and hugged me and said that he thought we should go to town instead of camping in the rain. I agreed.
On the drive back a bull moose showed up and started running straight down the road away from us. We followed him for almost five minutes before he finally turned off. First moose of the trail.","Jo-Mary Road

Nahmakanta Stream Road to Hurd Brooke Lean-To 
Despite the forecast of some biblical rains and Gilgameshian flooding, the sky was blue and the sun was shining by the time I got back to the trail. Dad dropped me off with a vague and convoluted plan. 
Somewhere near Rainbow Lake the satellite pictures showed an old logging road near the trail. Dad was to drive his truck around as close as he could to it, then hop off and ride in on his e-bike. I would then hike 17 miles, bushwack off the trail a bit, find that bike, and ride it out to the truck which the two of us would camp near. If that failed and I found no bike, I would simply hike on, doing 25 miles and getting to Golden Road and out of the Hundred Mile Wilderness. But of course, plans are for tourists and liars. It is the nature of plans to break down when they are set in place.
I hiked around the lake and crossed over the north slopes of Nesuntabunt Mountain, where Katahdin stood tall, dominating the northern skyline, the mist that had shrouded it burning away in the unexpected sunshine. Up until now Katahdin had remained hidden, giving me only short and small glimpses, like a monster in a low budget catastrophe flick. 
Now at last it stood tall and proud, baring itself to me now that it was close enough to tower over everything. 
There's no mistaking it. The mountain is THE MOUNTAIN. Any clear view to the north is of what the hikers are all calling ""Mama K"". It's unlike any mountain I've ever seen. Baxter Peak stands as a notable high point, but the area around that, what they refer to as ""The Tableland"", is obvious. Katahdin almost appears as a giant plateau, as if someone had chopped off its top with a sword. In sharp contrast to this, it is vertical on all sides. The longest and steepest of any climb I've seen. I've heard that some make it all the way here, past the aching feet and blisters, past the rocks of Pennsylvania, past the brutality of the Whites, only to be turned back in sheer fear of Katahdin's rock faces. 
""I ain't scared of nothing"". Sort of an old inside joke among my friends, I've made this literary abomination of a sentence almost a mantra. Something to keep me going even if it's not true. I don't need it yet. At this distance, Katahdin is striking, but not intimidating. What it is is beautiful. The leaves has fully changed so the colors of fire illuminate the flat forest floor that lines Katahdin like some rug around a Christmas tree. The lakes send off a bright blue that rivals that of the sky, and in the center of it all, the mountain I have dreamed of seeing for as long as I can remember, the only real goal my life has had, standing majestically, now less then 30 miles away. 
The rest of the hike was a cakewalk. The trail was not only flat, but smooth. You could take steps without contorting your foot into whatever improbable pattern the ground had laid out for it. 
I found Bananas sitting by a pond, watching some people fish out of a canoe. I stopped and talked to her for a second, but she was completely entranced by the fisherman. 
""I've never fished before,"" she told me, ""but I think I see the appeal of it"". 
""What you've got here is basically hiker television,"" I said, ""have they caught anything?""
""Not at all, but they just look so relaxed and peaceful""
""The nice thing about fishing is you can do absolutely nothing with intention,"" I said, ""it's like you don't actually have to do anything but you're still trying to accomplish something. It's relaxing, yet productive."" 
She nodded, and I left her to ponder the world of the fishing residents of Maine. I was just pondering how on Earth they got a canoe into that pond. 
I walked along the lakes and through the forests until I came to the spot where I was to leave the trail. I took two steps off trail when some satellites linked up just right in space and at the same time the trees blew in just the right way that somehow some small renegade bit of cell signal penatrated the forest and found its way straight to my phone, ringing with messages that the road does not exist and the bike I needed wouldn't be there. And just as quickly as the signal had come, it was gone, leaving me unable to respond.
I wasted no time. It was practically dark, and rain looked to be on its way. I kept moving up the trail, over the top of the dome of Rainbpw Ledges. The trail up over was flooded and flowing. I walked right through with no second thoughts about wet feet. I went down over the other side in the dark until I came to a huge stream crossing. I couldn't tell where the trail was, and the river I had to cross was a bit flooded. I shined my headlamp up and was soon greeted by another. I crossed toward the mysterious light, hopping over whatever rocks were exposed, and at the other side a hand reached out to me. I grabbed hold of it and it pulled me across. It was Corn Pops himself. Dad had made his way in.
We were now at Hurd Brooke Lean-To. Dad had apparently found another road to ride his electric mountain bike in, chained it to a tree, and bushwacked a mile along the stream to come to the shelter. He was up late, worrying that I'd be rummaging around in the woods looking for the nonexistent road near Rainbow Lake. I told him not to worry, I was here and I was fine. 
We spent the night there, climbing in our hammocks just before the worst downpour I've seen in Maine. ","Nahmakanta Stream Road

Hurd Brooke Lean-To to Katahdin Stream Campground 
That apocalyptic rain finally hit overnight. I was woken up a few times by the sound of rain punting against my tarp, but as always I stayed dry. This was one of those nights where people in tents were probably flooded out. As usual, those people have my sympathies. 
The rain slowed a bit but never stopped. I had three miles out to Golden Road and Dad had se ridiculous odyssey to get back out. We split up in the pouring rain, me following the trail and him following the, now flooded, creek. 
The last few miles of the Hundred Miles were some of the easiest. For all the challenges that place hit me with, I was sad to leave it. Emotions at this point are a funny thing. One second I am hiking along as is my daily routine, like everything is normal. The next I am dizzy with the thought that this is all almost over, and I feel accomplished and proud, excited to see the sign at the end of the blazes. But just as quickly I am reminded that my new world is going to collapse, all of these people will disperse and I will have to stop hiking, and it seems terrifying.
As is the usual, the best thing to do is not think too much about it, just keep on hiking.
At Golden Road I crossed Abol Bridge, with that classic view of Katahdin over the river. Surprisingly enough it was mostly visible despite the rain. 
Just passed the bridge was the Abol camp store. I expected the final good resupply on the trail (and the first for SOBOs) to he a big deal, perhaps the northern equivalent to Mountain Crossings down at Neels Gap. Instead I found a dusty, dimly lit, and poorly stocked convience store with bare shelves and a morose shopkeep. 
I bought a soda and left. Dad pulled up then and told me he had reserved sight 8 at Katahdin Stream Campground, 5 miles from the summit.
I sat in his truck for a half hour to warm up and dry off then hit the trail again. 
The trail followed Golden Road for a short way then crossed with another great look at Katahdin. This was the entrance to Baxter State Park, and I found a guy sitting under a roof taking people's names as they came in. The Birches, Baxters woefully inept long distance sight, was always booked before 6 am. He had the sign up list there and I was happy to see some familiar names, AARP, Nat Geo, Maui, French Fry, EZ, among many others. No doubt they would be sumitting tomorrow.
The rain slowed and the trail got flat and even for a while. It followed a river that was flooded terrifyingly past its banks. I past a sign that read ""high water bypass"". No doubt, the water was high, but I haven't missed a single step on this trail and there wasn't a chance I was going to do it now. 
I pressed on. 
The trail dipped close to the rushing water a few times, past some small cascades which had swelled into huge torrents. The noise was deafening. 
Then came the first stream crossing. It wasn't the big river on my left, that would have meant certain and foolish death, but a small side stream which only carried possible and maybe even heroic death.
My shoes were already wet and I had my rain pants on. I felt no need to take anything off. I took a first step into the water and was in at my knees. Another step and it was mid thigh. The force of that water was pushing me over, I braced myself against the rocks as the water went up to my waist. What I was doing right then would have upset a lot of my loved ones had they been able to see it. One slip would probably be enough to kill me, and if the water got any stronger it wouldn't even take that. But what kind of a moron dies ten miles from the end? Dying in Baxter would just make me feel too much like a jackals, so I stepped carefully, took longer then what I needed, and made it across the mercifully thin stream.
Now I was cold and wetter then ever, but relieved that I wouldn't have to do it again. I was surprised Tye guy at the park entrance didn't try to talk me into waiting or taking another route. For a second I thought they must not know about it, but then I realized something far more probable. They knew better. At this stage, noone was going around.
I walked a few more miles and the rain started to slow down and the sun was almost peaking through. I started to speed up and that's when I hit the second crossing.
I took pause at the sight of this one. It was at least twice as wide and it looked even deeper, and worse yet, swifter. 
I jumped I'm, my shoes refilling with water and my rain pants resoaked and stuck to my again. I made it to the center, but that's where it dropped off. The water was now above my waist and soaking my pack. Worse still, the force of it was knocking me over. I struggled to stay upright on the slippery rocks. I furiously dug my poles in and fought to stand. 
I soon realized that another step forward carried a very serious risk of drowning, so I backed off and stood in the shallow and calm water and tried to gage the situation. 
There were a few tall rocks sticking out just downstream. There was no way to hop it but I thought I might be able to hold them and they might break up the flow somewhat. 
I stepped in there and made it most of the was through, until I came to a gap in the rocks. The rocks had the effect of concentrating the flow to this one area. I stepped out into the torrent, still gripping the rock behind me and soon found myself frozen, unable to let go of the rock for fear of my life. 
I looked across to the other side, so close now but still unreachable. Defeated again, I climbed on top of the rock and out of the water. Next to that was an even taller rock. I got to the top of that one and took off my pack and gave it a toss to the other side. This had the dual effect of me not having to carry the pack through the water and forcing me to get across.
I tried a third spot, this one was where I needed to be. I collapsed on the north shore, soaking wet and relieved. I silently hoped that there would be no more of this.
The rest of the park was so flooded that I walked in water most of the way. Even where log bridges were constructed, they were a few inches under the flow of the water, but nothing was as treacherous as all that. 
I came to a short little road and knew it was the last road crossing on the entire trail. The trail took me into Katahdin Stream Campground where Dad had somehow managed to book a two person site at the last minute. 
Katahdin was right there. I was at the very bade of it now. It towered above everything. I sat in awe. I got my permit and laid back, ate some food and dried off my shoes in the campfire. This pair of shoes is destroyed, my toes are poking out the sides, there's not much more damage that the fire could do anyway. 
All my gear can fail now and it will be OK. It all just has to last for 5 more miles. My hammock has an irreparable tear in it, my pack is battered with bits of the frame sticking out all over, my kilt is getting tears, my clothes carry a stench I can't even wash out, and my body itself has uncounted aches and pains and problems. It is OK now. As long as it can just go 5 more miles. 
Despite all of this, I'm not ready for it to end. The concept of home and a bed and unlimited food has seemed so enticing up until now, but those now seem all like some simple zero day luxuries, nothing compared to the life I've found out here. Comfort is the death of happiness, I've known that for a long time. It can be satisfying for a short bit, but it can never sustain you without the expense of your life's true joy. 
This dread of ending the trail though is eclipsed by a combination of sheer excitement for the lofty goal finally reached, the sum of all efforts and determination about to be surpassed. I can sit back and smile now. I know that I will either make it or die trying. 
Accomplishment, finishing something, that is the highest order of happiness. 
It is a clear, cold, starry night. I've spent surprisingly little time looking at the stars out here, between the trees, the clouds, and the fact I'm usually dead asleep. Tonight I made it a point to take a good look at them. 
I guess there was a six month anniversary. In the end, the trail will have taken six months and one day. The second half has actually taken me longer then the first half. Six months out here, and it all comes down to this. I slept surprisingly well that night.","Hurd Brooke Lean-To

Katahdin 
It was still dark when I got up. It was like any other morning. Warm up my clothes by throwing them in my bag with me, get dressed, tear down camp, eat a little something, check guthooks and mark a goal. Only today the goal wasn't a campsite or a road into town. It was the northern terminus, only five miles ahead. 
Five miles sounds a lot like a nero, but keep in mind two things, first that I'll have to come back down, and second that these five miles represent the longest climb on the entire trail. 
The sky was just starting to light up, giving me one more look at Katahdin before I started the climb. 
Dad is determined to see the end with me, so he's climbing the mountain with me. I don't think he has any idea what he's getting himself into, he hasn't hiked with me since Pennsylvania and I don't think he realizes that these northern mountains are nothing like the south. This will be fun.
The trail was flat and easy for the first half mile or so, through the woods following Katahdin Stream. Then we came to Katahdin Stream falls and it started upward, following some steps and some long rocks. 
Dad said something along the lines of this is a bit challenging but he can handle it, I laughed and told him it would certainly get much worse. 
The view was breathtaking right off the bat. Katahdin has a few tall mountains around it which can be easily seen to the west, but the view south has no mountains for at least 50 miles. Looking across the vast plain of lakes and woods, the colors of autumn, from such a steep freestanding mountain is truly breathtaking. 
It was sunny down at the bottom but soon a distinct layer of high mountain fog developed at the tops of the peaks. It looked like I'd be finishing up inside a cloud. Rather unfortunate but thankfully the lower parts of the mountain still had their views. 
Finishing up in a storm cloud was probably the most appropriate way to end it anyway. I remember that storm the night before I started. How Amicolola was shrouded in the most threatening rain and fog imaginable, flooding the area and unleashing nightmarish lightning. The trail was always an intense experience, why should the end be any different.
Soon the trail got steeper. The recent rains and flooding meant that we were basically following a creek, Massachusetts style. I tried for a while to keep my recently dried shoes out of the flowing Brook, then gave up and just walked right through. 
The trail got steeper, as it always does the higher you get. I soon found myself climbing on all fours over the rocks and grabbing onto the roots. Dad asked if this was what the Whites were like, and I laughed a bit and told him that this was easy compared to that. 
Before long, we hit the treeline. The trail ceased to be a path and turned to a scramble up a cliff, distinguishable only by the continuous white blazes I've been following since Georgia. 
We skirted a cliff, crawled through a crack, and finally found our way to the rebar. Not the welcoming rebar ladders of Southern Maine or the revar steps, but a single piece that formed the bare minimum of a foothold where there was no other option as you climbed a cliff face. Next came what amounted to a pull up bar. You had to jam your feet into a crack, pull yourself up until the bar was in reach, grab hold of it and use every bit of your strength to get yourself over top of the bar and onto the flat rock on the side. I laid there and caught my breath while dad did the same. 
I looked down and wondered how anyone managed to get back down over that. That would be a problem for the future though. For now I was going up. Katahdin if it kills me, I've always said. 
A woman came down in front of me and I moved aside to let her come past and soon recognized the face of August West. I yelled out to her and she answered back, I asked her what the top was like and, ever one for drama, her own description moved her to tears. I almost reflexively offered her a Tylenol but then remembered this was Katahdin, everyone was ending here. I said bye to August and realized I'd probably never see her or most of the other people out here again. 
Just then the wind picked up. I stopped and put a pair leggings on under my kilt, then my puffy jacket and my hood. At the same time we entered the cloud. The rocks all became wet, and moisture soon settled all over my clothes. It was cold, wet and windy. 
I kept pushing on into the wall of fog. As far as I could see I was now on a thin ledge, with an endless white void on either side, getting blown toward the edge by the wind. More then once it grabbed my pack and spun me around. I kept my head down and pushed forward, climbing through the jungle of rocks and Cliffs. 
The Hunt Spur is a famous little respite. It's a short flat stretch that offers climbers a much needed break. I tucked behind a big rock to get out of the wind. Dad soon appeared and tucked in with me. I checked guthooks and saw that we had gone half a mile in just over an hour. 
""This is more like it!"" I shouted over the howling wind. 
When we got up to leave I noticed ice was starting to form on the rocks. Just a thin layer to make things a bit more slippery. I had to constantly stop and warm my hands until the feeling returned to them. I was cursing myself for not bringing gloves. 
Another hour or so of climbing over the now icy rocks and intense wind and I looked ahead on the Cliffs and saw a sign directly ahead. It had to be the Gateway, the end of the most technical part of the climb and the entrance to Katahdin's Tablelands. 
We crossed by it and were releived to be able to walk again. I tucked my hands in my jacket pockets to warm them and pushed on, with an exaggerated pace and fervor. I came to Thoreau Spring, the last water source on the trail. Only one more mile to go now. 
I was almost running along now, slipping in the ice covered rocks but not caring, following the white blazes through that endless void of fog. All thoughts were gone from my mind now. I wasn't reminiscing about the miles and months of effort that brought me here, I wasn't feeling any longing or sadness or accomplishment. It's was just a mad raving determination, a vague excitement and inducement to press on to get past every blaze.
That was what stopped me. The blazes. How many were left now? 50? 30? A dozen? It was too foggy to see much ahead of me, the end could be only a hundred yards away, but what I really felt was the blazes. The fact that the blazes were going to end. I've been following them for over six months now. I didn't think about them any more. When I saw a blaze I simply walked to it, and then to the next one. But now they were going to stop. 
I stood still for a second and walked on. Now I was slower, still with my mind firmly fixed on the goal ahead, but no longer rushing, no longer hurrying though. 
The trail got steeper again and I knew I now had to be ascending the little bump that was Baxter Peak. The rocks were now caked in ice, and my glasses were icing over at the same time. I had to stop a few times and clear them off. I looked back and realized I left Dad behind at some point in my rushing. No matter, he would be up here soon. 
French Fry and EZ passed me. I said hi and they returned the greeting, but were clearly too focused to say much else. I let them go ahead. I put my head down and moved forward. I had noticed that they had ice in their beards and hair, and I felt my face and realized I had the same.
The wind picked up harder then ever and temperature dropped another ten degrees. The peak was significantly harsher then the Tablelands or even the Spur. It was going to have to be a quick summit. No matter how determined I was to get to the top, I really didn't want to die there. 
I kept on, head down, arms tucked in, I even covered my face with my buff to protect it from the wind and the wet air. Things got a little flatter and I looked up.
A wooden sign materialized out of the void. French Fry was standing on top of it, shouting some words that were lost to the wind. Behind it was a huge cairn marking the true summit, and all around it was nothing, the land dropped away into the fog in every direction. I got dizzy for a second. I regained myself and stood there, unsure of how to react. 
You don't come straight up to the sign, it's sort of sideways when you first see it. I didn't know what to do so I just stood there and waited a minute for Dad to catch up. 
There wasn't much time for tears or reflection. Everyone at the summit looked rough, like exhausted, half drowned rats that somehow found their way into a freezer. 
Dad came up and put a hand on my back. Without a word a I approached the sign. 
Katahdin 
Baxter Peak  Elevation 5267 FT.
Northern Terminus of the Appalachian Trail 
A few distance markers, including Springer Mountain via AT 2,189.1 (not quite accurate but they can't be expected to change the sign every time the distance changes) 
Baxter State Park
How does it feel to put a hand on the sign? After ten years of thinking and planning and dreaming, after six months and one day of hiking?
There's only one way to know what that feels like and I would encourage everyone who hasn't done this to start immediately. 
Make the Appalachian Trail your sole goal in life. Start working and putting away money, buying gear and learning how to use it until you are ready. Get dropped off in Georgia in an apocalyptic storm and start walking north. Join a group around a campfire who all suspiciously share your name. Get food from strangers who simply want to see you succeed. Survive those early days where you are freezing cold and watching your comrades drop out one after the other. Don't be one of those people. Wave to them, shake their hand, wish them the best of luck but be more determined then that. Cross the first state line. Become closer and closer with the people around you. Cross the Smokies. Hitchike. Rob a pizzeria because the liquor told you to do it and get a name for it. Be a Smuggler. Band together with your fellow hikers against swarms of bears. Dont see a damn thing in the Roan Highlands aside from your own waterlogged self and a nice lady giving out salsa. Light a fire in a rainstorm and fight off a horde of hyperintellgent bears. Do a 30 into Damascus for no reason and sleep under a bridge. Pet horses. Pet dogs. Learn to love the little things. Be happy. See the sunrise at Mcafee. Write off your sins and confessions. Let things get strange in the Shennies. See the most beautiful sunset you could ever have imagined. Flip off the Shennies. Fight more bears. Hide out in a storeroom built just for you. Have a shake relationship with cows. Try to lose the Chads. Just try. Catch fish with a trekking pole and cook them over a fire. Get naked with strangers. Get out of Virginia. Buy some corn from a barefoot Mennonite boy and cook it in a shelter. Say bye to your dog. Lose track of your friends. Hate Pennsylvania even though it's your birth state. Love Pennsylvania a thru same time. Get offered mushrooms by a crazed, recently paroled felon while she drives you to the house of a professional bagpipe player who's yard you are sleeping in. Cross the Hudson and see Manhattan in the distance. Eat berries. Enter New England. Get throughly waterlogged and attacked by mosquitoes until you become a raving idiot. Miss your friends. Wonder where they all got to. Hike on. Start a relationship on the trail. Stay a few nights with an actual cult. Go into New Hampshire and get absolutely wrecked by the Whites. Be so sore that you hobble with every step and can only do 8 miles a day. Love every minute of it. Get stung in the knee by a bee and get taken off the trail for a few zeros. Enter Maine. Run out of food on the hardest part of the whole trail. Get a job and a reminder that you're almost done. See the Bigelows. Hike with Mohawk, gain wisdom. Fail at crossing the Kennebec. Do it on a canoe instead. Throw a fit in the Hindred Mile Wilderness because you know you are running out of food. Breakdown and buy food. See a moose. Enter Baxter and climb the mountain you have been dreaming of and accomplish the sum of all your life's goals and dreams in one fell swoop with a simple touch of your hand to an old wooden sign and you will know how I felt right there on that mountain. 
The proudest moment and one of the most profound of my life was right there, shivering and ice covered on Katahdin. Only last about two minutes. I took a picture with the sign, touched the top of the cairn, and got off before things got any worse. 
I passed a stream of hikers on the way down. AARP, Red, Racehorse, Babyhands, Nat Geo, Maui. I yelled my congratulations to all of them. Iay never see them again, but that would seem a fitting last word to someone anyway. 
As I went down, things got less intense. The cold went out of me. Things started to clear up. At Thoreau Spring I realized I was a free man now and could walk any trail I chose, so I took the blue blazed Abol Trail down. It was shorter and steeper but less exposed. The clouds cleared as soon as I started down. The view opened back up and I was given a view to the south from where I came. I could see out into the Hundred Mile Wilderness and knew that the AT stretched right through there and all the way back to Georgia. That white blazed pathway was the key to so much that was so strange and so beautiful and so perfect, and now I was officially off trail. I was done, no longer thru hiking. Now I can call myself a thru hiker. ","Katahdin Stream Campground

What happens now
I made it down off the Abol trail and out of the Clouds and got one last look south to where I had come from. Whitecap was out there, clearly visible beyond a patchwork of lakes and fall colored trees. It was hard to beleive it could end just like that, that tomorrow I didn't have to walk anywhere.
At the end of the trail Dad and I caught one last hitch back to the truck, where I threw my pack in and took my shoes off. I haven't worn them since.
I collapsed in the front seat and took a few sighs of relief. At that moment, I could finally relax. I took a deep breath and went limp for a second. This burden was off my shoulders, the strain was gone from my knees. I could let me feet heal. 
Dad and I spent a few days on the road, easing me back into the world I suppose. We went to Acadia and rode bikes on the trails, we got a massive lobster, we stopped to see some friends in Rhode Island. 
I made it three days once I was home. I spent a lot of time on trail daydreaming about couches and unlimited food. Day one they were all I wanted. I didn't tell anyone I was home yet so I wouldn't be disturbed. Day two I suddenly felt restless. Even though every part of me still hurt something seemed wrong about being inside. Like a rabid raccoon in a five star restaurant, I was feeling like I didn't belong. 
So, three days after going home, I found myself right back on the AT, passing the white blazes on a 12 mile section from the Cumberland Valley to Duncannon, friends by my side and kilt around my waist. If ever I needed a sign, this was it, there could be no doubt, there's something beautifully wrong with me. 
I made the local newspaper. Someone told someone and an interview was set up (without my consent) and I told a nice reporter about the trail and soon found myself on the front page of The Hummelstown Sun, right below a story about a rat that crashed a dog party. 
I've been watching the Facebook Groups and keeping in contact with all my friends on the trail, and the past month has been a string of victories for everyone behind me. Every picture I see of another hiker standing on the peak of Katahdin sends my heart racing and fills me with pride. I know what they've gone through to get there, and I make sure to congratulate every one of them. I'm proud to say that almost everyone I hiked with made it to the very end, some before me and some after. 
Poet trail depression is a word that gets thrown around a lot,  but I'm happy to say it's largely missed me. Sure, I've been feeling lazy and somewhat trapped here, but I always feel that way when I'm home, it's nothing new, and I have the future to look forward to.
Soon, I'll he moving in with Marsha in Jackson Hole. Jill, Creech, Cory, and Alanna will be right up the road and we'll all be working in the same building. I'll be able to strap my skis on again, gliding through the Tetons and breathing in that icy winter air I love so much. I'll have an easy job that pays well, a membership to a climbing gym, and another trail to look forward to. 
So now the scene looks familiar. There's research to be done, gear to be ordered, and another great trail on the horizon. Permit day is coming up for the PCT, and have every intention of stepping off from the Mexican border, northbound to Canada.
The truth is that you never really stop hiking. We've all seen it in the movies, our beloved main character reaching some goal and in an instant being changed forever, so overcome with the accomplishment that their life is never the same. In the real world it doesn't work that way. It's the journey that makes you, that slow wearing down of your old habits and even slower building of charecter that leads to new ones. Reaching the top of Katahdin hasn't changed me forever, mile after mile getting there is what did it, and it's a process that will likely continue until I die.
Still, there is one thing it has shown me. As I now look to my piles of other unfinished work scattered about, I can stop and know that with focus and determination, I can make it, I have finished at least one grand project, reached at least one goal, and now I know for certain there's no reason I can't reach the next one.
As one final side note, let me say thank you to everyone who has actually read this thing. Having this as a record and an outlet was incredibly helpful out there on the trail, and I'm certain I'll have another journal going next summer, so if you enjoyed this feel free to check that out. Thank you to everyone who left a comment in the guest book as well, I loved reading those and hearing from everyone. And if any of you are planning your own thru hike and would like some advice or even if you'd just like to talk, please feel free to reach out to me, my email is zachyoutz@yahoo.com. 
Live well everyone, and as the thru hikers say, happy trails.
