Made it to the first hostel - where 25% of thru-hikers decide not to continue.Spent some time in Franklin, NC, where I had to get new shoes that were two sizes bigger. Hoping that helps my ankle on the hike.","Trailhead in Georgia

Painless,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634126,"250 miles in now. Lots of work, but fun. Had some cold wet rainy days. 2 days ago it was in the teens after hiking all day in the rain the day before. Shoes and socks were frozen solid. Took 15 minutes to just get into my shoes. Staying in the top story of the treehouse in this photo. There are 25-30 other hikers here, pretty cool!","

She's one of the sweetest people I know and she hoped she could meet Tim along the way. Well, she treated him to a hot shower, warm bed, yummy food, Easter brunch, ""ubered"" him around to REI, grocery store, etc., and a tour of the beautiful Asheville area. She took him back to the trail this morning.","

We had another beautiful day of hiking.Met a girl yesterday that is from the Apostle Islands, WI. What a small world!","
