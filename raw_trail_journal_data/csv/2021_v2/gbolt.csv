gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639245,"Since Summiting Katahdin, Sept. 1, 2018, I have never experienced the Gratitude and Contentment that I felt after touching the sign, returning home, and trying to move on with life off the trail.  I thought another Thru Hike, this time the Buckeye Trail, would create another opportunity for these fleeting emotions.  However, Covid hit and that delayed life and the hike.  That year, changed me, as I was able to be at Peace social distancing, mask wearing, and the multiple other constraints placed on life.  In a way, it was similar to life on the trail, with limited resources and adapting to a simple daily routine.  Of course, this was minus wonderful views day in and day out, meeting people along their walk thru life, and the magic that only the trail can provide.  It also was much more sedentary, adding back more weight than lost thru hiking.  My body strength decreased tremendously and my resting heart rate increased causing more couch and Netflix binging.  Many people flocked to Local Metroparks or National Parks, in record numbers,  to break the covid confines.  However,  my feet and knees never returned to pre hike status.  I felt older than I was and knew that Pennsylvania ruined my feet while the Whites Took out my knees.  Too this day, I have foot numbness and when walking, I feel like the sock is bunched up under the toes... even when bare foot!  My knees creek and grind when called upon  to step up or over any object.  Physically, I knew that I was ruined.  I am sure 2020, ruined us all Emotionally as we tried to find our new normal.  Mentally, I struggled to find the next challenge and arena to place my focus.  This all led to a decline in my Spiritual Wellbeing that is the core of motivation for accomplishing any great thing on a daily basis.  I struggled to outlast Covid and literally, bowled my way into 2021.  Knowing six months was too great a commitment, I thought a three month Buckeye Trail Thru Hike was just the ticket for a post covid transition.  (See my 2021 Buckeye Trail Journal if interested). However, that just illustrated that the Appalachian Trail had ruined me more than I could imagine!",,View Entry,"Jun 12, Sat",0
gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639246,"""I’ve decided to end my Buckeye Trail hike.  Basically, what many will hear is that I am a quitter.  Which is true and stings my tongue to say it  I started with excuses to soften the blow: my age (61 and yes it is a factor but not an excuse), my feet (still numb and feel like a bunched up sock from previous hikes), my knees (countless surgeries and some days even hard to walk up or down steps in a 2 story house),  and an inability to give the trail a chance to provide water and camping spots (which is really my failure to live by Faith). Mentally, I hear myself saying, “I’m a Quitter!” and that stings me.  Mainly because I never want to be that example to my children, family and friends. Confidence is a key mental element to succeed in life.   So, I sit here filled with self doubt! Yet, I refuse to be a failure. This single hike should not and will not define me.  I am glad that I at least tried and started!  In life, we shouldn’t be afraid to find out what brings us joy, because we are worried about a sense of defeat.  I discovered that I enjoy day hiking and even camping at no cost sites where there is water and a privy!  I found peace and release from my uneasiness by putting long distance thru hiking in my past now.  Which actually is liberating!  I am getting excited about the possibility of going to Trail Days, in Damascus, or hiking the Foothills Trail or even The Long Trail!  I also am going to make sure I at least walk the dog in the neighborhood, which should now be relaxing and a blessing, not a chore!""  
It was with this in mind that I tried to move on from my past into a new future.  A future that immediately was realized with a phone call from RTK... Would I like to hike the Foothills Trail?  Heck yes!!! Followed by a phone call from Recon... Would I like to hike with him as he wraps up the last miles of his 2018 AT Thru Hike? Heck yaaa... maybe... I don't know... Hello Self Doubt, my old friend!",,View Entry,"Jun 13, Sun",0
gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639247,"It was great to be buried in a Data Book, creating a new gear load out, and figuring out meals for the trip ahead!  On the road heading south, I drove along I40 over Davenport Gap and saw the AT sign! Joy, excitement, and Inspiration filled my soul!  Arriving at Table Rock State Park, SC to spend a night SUV camping was the perfect transition away from the Pandemic. Even met a fellow AT hiker, ADD on the AT, as he successfully finished his Foothills Trail Thru Hike and headed out for a drink, burger, and shower.  I truly was confident that I would conquer the 76.2 mile trail, after all, it couldn't be any tougher than the hike from Amicalola to  Dicks Creek, or could it!  First day from Occonee State Park was 11 miles to a wonderful camp spot along the river! Hiking and Reminiscing with RTK was filling my soul!  Then we hit two 13 mile Day's of unseasonable and brutal southern heat and humidity!  A death march that we swore we weren't going to let happen. Yet, here we were struggling up and down the same Nantahala Mountains that the AT also crosses less than 100 miles west.  Zapped of energy, lacking trail legs, and carrying 6 day's of food, we truly questioned what had happened to the ""Conquerers of the AT""! The morning of Day 4, with even more heat scorching us, we called Taz, the Trail Angel of the Foothills.  If we could hike 10 miles by 2:00, he would pick us up in his pontoon boat at the only access point for that day.  Otherwise, we would have to keep hiking over the biggest elevation gains of the trip.  Somehow, we manage to push out the miles to our rescue spot and true Trail Magic!  How many people get a combined shuttle and boat ride tour of the very lake that lies at the base of the Foothills Trail we had been suffering on.  The beer, shower and then Mexican Food were as awesome as any nero into any AT town!  RTK and I, realized that we had hiked more miles than we would have in order to reach Neels Gap and that this could become our symbolic Foothills Trail Tree for our Boots!  We vowed to return during the fall colors and finish what we had started.",,View Entry,"Jun 14, Mon",0
gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639294,"RTK and I are very similar in our battle of ""Self Reliance"" in life and on the Trail.  Battling with how much to ""Let Go and Let God"";  While also struggling with the good ol' saying, ""God helps those that help themselves"" or ""Pull yourself up by your own boot straps"".  Back and forth, up and down, like PUD""s we struggle along.  Was the Foothills Trail a Success or Failure?  If pressed, I would say I failed.  My body ached, especially my knees.  I didn't sleep well. HIking 13 miles for ten hours, pushed me to my limit and I really didn't enjoy the daily grind. Yet, I did love the views, abundance of water/waterfalls, and camping each evening. The conversation was excellent and mentally stimulating.  My gear choices worked well and I didn't desire for a thing while out in nature.  However, I bailed on completing the Thru Hike, forcing me to struggled with the decision of whether to return to the AT with Recon; the entire trip home and beyond.  NH and Maine or the real deal and a challenge that will test a persons to their very core!  Balancing miles and smiles is a major challenge when Hiking.  Every hiker will have day's that they can conquer the mountain and day's when the slightest incline while cause faltered steps. RTK and I both acknowledged that Recon was the strongest hiker, who should have easily finished the trail out of any of us. Once the three of us committed to hiking together, he was the one that had no self doubt and stated, one for all and all for one!  We needed each other more than he ever needed us.  He could pound out the miles, hike solo, and never seemed to wear out.  Yet, he was the one that often told us, ""if my wife asked, or it's not meant to be, I would leave this trail in a heartbeat"".  His wry smile and wit in the Mahoosuc Notch helped us to enjoy the boulder playground and propelled us up the tough Moahoosuc Arm!  The picture of us three at the Maine/NH Border sign, gave no indication that we would not be together for a repeat photo op, at the Wooden sign atop Katahdin.  Yet, the most powerful hiker among us, was not allowed to finish.  Truly unfair, but life can be unfair at times.  Recon's battle was bigger than the trail and was life altering itself!  I didn't know it then, but now I see that Faith in God is not only knowing that many prayers for a successful Thru HIke will be answered the way one may dream; but also that when the dream doesn't go as planned and prayers seemed to go unanswered, God is still there.  Real Faith is accepting that thought while using the skills and self reliance that he has instilled in each of us to hike on.  Who is to judge that Recons Thru HIke wasn't a success.  I truly believe it was a Great Success that not only changed him but those impacted by him; whether a sign was touched or not!  In the end, we all must live by Faith and Keep HikN^ thru life.  That is exactly what Recon did and continues to do to this very day.  He started hiking the trail with his wife in 2019: covering the previous 2018 missed miles.  He was having a blast and enjoying the trail until Wasps caused his wife to get off trail.  Just like in 18, he didn't complain and supported her.  Covid changed a lot of things but not Recon's decision to continue to hike the AT.  After he read my final Buckeye Trail Journal Entry, he sent me his itinerary for completing the hike and asked if I would like to join him when he restarted in Andover Maine?",,View Entry,"Jun 15, Tue",0
gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639383,"After the trip home from the Foothills, I was still relying more on Self Reliance than Faith.  Emotionally, I was excited to answer Yes to Recon’s gracious invitation to join his hike to Katahdin.  Physically, I was filled with doubt about my hiking abilities and knew I would probably hold him back, struggling with the daily grind of hiking in Maine; without the benefit of previous New England and Green Mountain miles that usually prepare a Thru Hiker for this rigorous finish.  Mentally, I was in a defeated state of mind and didn’t have the positive motivation to keep hiking for smiles and not give into quitting the miles, especially when bailing from the Trail is so difficult, so far from home.  Emotionally, I was on a Roller Coaster ride, knowing the goodness and magic of the trail and understanding the difficult challenge presented by the Wilderness of Maine.  I know the difficulty of the state.  I felt the Hunt Trail itself, was a microcosm of the entire AT and my most difficult day on the trail in 2018.  Yet, looking back now, I realize the fatigue, wear and tear on the body, and the toll hiking 2,00 miles takes on a person.  I would be fresh and hopefully better able to enjoy the long days; without having the end of an epic journey looming before me with a desire to simply be done with the hike.  Ultimately, debating what would bring me joy, staying home or hiking.  Meanwhile, Recon shared that he was enjoying time at a CT. Shelter with Underdog and other hikers currently on the trail.  In 2019, Underdog hiked with a fellow named Sleeves as they both touched the wooden sign as documented on their youtube channels that I have subscribed to for years!  In 2018, Sleeves had hiked a great deal with RTK as Recon and I followed them up the trail. However, both Sleeves and Recon had their journey cut short due to major injuries and no fault of their own.  Of course this is what led to RTK and my story, which shows how connected everyone is that steps foot on the AT, both past and present.  Spiritually, I struggled to commit to Recon.  However, Recon never wavered and showed constant Faith in finishing Maine with me tagging along. His confidence forced me to rethink my gear choices such as returning to the Toaks and Pocket Rocket cookset, ditching an umbrella, saving time by using a Double Rainbow Tarptent versus hammocking and finally creating a milage plan that hopefully will serve as a minimum daily amount that is doable and hopefully matches my current physical abilities. This has led me to once again, become hopeful that this will create a new and unique experience that will once again fill me with Gratitude and Contentment!  It truly could be a full circle moment to watch Recon touch the sign and then hopefully get a picture of both of us Trail Brothers standing victorious on it together!",,View Entry,"Jun 16, Wed",0
gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639446,"My wife mentioned to me that I have the excitement back in my eyes, that was missing before the Buckeye Trail and questionable when I returned home from the Foothills Hike.  I am starting to feel confident and better prepared now that I have spent two weeks on the treadmill and two 7 mile power hikes at our local metro park with my pack on.  I have also done some step work, like I had before departing for Amicalola in 18"".  However, I am watching the Vlog of ""Heading North"", who killed the Whites and recently posted the early sections of Maine where we are starting.  No way am I ready to keep his pace of 17-20+ mile day's.  He did Rangeley to Stratton in Two day's and I am hopeful we can do that section in 3!  He often states, ""This was another hard, hard, day!  The views were beautiful, but it's tough!  Maine is not easy!""  I totally get where he is coming from; but, I am hopeful that doing a section hike, I can better slow down and enjoy each day on the trail without the push to get miles in and ""get er done""!  Plus, I am blessed to be allowed this opportunity to hike with Recon and finish the story of our epic journey! Today was final prep with the highlight being able to mail an 8 day Resupply to Shaw's for the HMW.  It is strange to once again Address it to: AT Hiker gbolt C/O...  I also packed the four day resupply in my Ursak Almitey.  It is more stretched out and flexible now that it has been used.  I like it, however, the velcro stitching is pulling away.  Something, I hope is covered under their warranty since I didn't get it a REI.  It's not a big deal, because the system really works by a very tight double hand cinch knot.  My base weight is under 20 pounds with a 20* quilt plus my 50* and also a puffy with hat and gloves.  It still has some cold nights in the upper elevation and so I am not chancing it.  That means with 4 day's of food, water, fuel, and gatorade, it will stay under 32* total load out weight.  It's packed tight and rides nice so I am still happy with my ULA Ohm 2.0.  I put my Dirty Girl Gators on my Altra Olympus for a training hike, but have decided against them.  The Olympus 4.0 are still very comfortable and without a doubt are my current favorite hiking shoe.  Still rockin the Lite AF Waist Pack for electronic items and candy snacks.  I am putting the Be Free 1L in my pack waist pocket for easy access to fill up my smartwater bottles.  I liked just looping it on a hook by the Aqua Clip, but it I don't think it's stable enough for this rigorous of a trail.  I also like the Hydration setup that worked on the Thru Hike.  However, I love the quickness of the BeFree over the Sawyer.  So I'm blending the past and the present.  The backpacks in the car and I'm ready in the early morning, to head to VT, then the next day to NH... So we can start from North of Andover!",,View Entry,"Jun 18, Fri",0
gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640028,"After spending the night in a tent at Harry and Peggy’s Campground, we were a 2 1/2 hour car drive from the trail.  After a leisurely breakfast, cooked by Recon, Harry drove us to Dunn Trailhead parking lot.  Just North of where we were picked up by Jeff and Tracy in 18’ and the site that Recon was forced off trail and separated from RTK and myself.  It was exciting to be back with Recon and posing for another photo op with Harry in the pic too.  It reminded me of Hanover NH and Recon’s promise to get me through the Whites and to Maine.  Now I am Grateful to hike with him to Kahtahdin!   Today wasn’t suppose to be that tough, but Maine is always tough!  The heat didn’t help and I was sweating, panting, cramping some, and trying to stay hydrated and moving forward.  Recon is a hiking machine but is setting a steady, pace, slowing when I lag behind.  I realized that nothing can train or prepare a person. It is just a trail that has too many different obstacles to throw at a hiker.  After under a two mile an hour pace and eight miles, we called it a day due to forecasted thunderstorms.  It is raining on the tin roof as I type this.  Stopping  short will add a day before we hit Rangeley, but I am glad Recon made the call to stop here. We had plenty of time in camp for the first night.   Which I needed because my BeFree water filter dried up and the flow wasn’t good. We also hiked up behind the shelter to Gunsight View and great cell service, Returning when the thunder started to rumble. I’ve taken two vitamin I’s and although it’s two hours before hiker midnight, I am ready for bed.  Maine is no joke!","E. B Hill Road

Up early and no rain predicted for the morning forecast; but a chance the rest of the day and evening.   First climb of the day was Moody Mtn. And it was rigorous with rebar in rock and cedar steps up a near vertical incline. It was followed by a granite stone down and then a climb up Ol Big Blue.  It was rugged and made me realize I am not in shape for Maine.  Even on the “easy” parts I rolled my right ankle and fell twice.  We had no choice but to get over the 4,000 ft Bemis Mtn and part way down the north side to the shelter.   Once again it is raining and suppose to continue all night. Forgetful, a thru hike NOBO came in close to dark so he his sharing the shelter with us.  Already hiker midnight after a 14 hour hiking day!

gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640097,"Today was less elevation gain and lost but still tough!  Plan was to head to a hostel overnight but we held up short and will Nero tomorrow.  These  hikes are no joke!  In 2018 I slack packed these miles, plus was already in great hiking shape, so I shouldn’t complain.  The morning we played leapfrog with Forgetful.  At one point one pheasant attacked him while another then lead us away from the nest.  Cool to see “real life” occurring in the wild.  Later Recon spotted a dear crossing the trail up ahead, as it stared, sniffed and try to determine if we were friend or foe.  Highlight of the day was ME 27 and the park that looks out over the  Rangeley Lakes.   Made slightly better time so able to set up the tent and cook a leisurely diner.  Spring water was the better choice over pond water, but was flowing at a trickle.  1 liter per 10 minutes!  It’s was 42 last night and suppose to be 38 tonight, so ready for a cold sleep. The only bad thing is putting on damp clothes in the mornings and trying to stay warm until hiking. It was cool to set up a tent for the first time on the AT (after using a Hammock previously).  I relied on Recon for the best site and spot.  My Tarptent Double Rainbow went up easy enough, although I had the head and foot end switched around.  Should be ok for one night.  Also, Recon is complaining about no evening entertainment with my Ursak being so easy to strap to a tree.  Much safer for me, especially since my Body is aching and my ankle is so swollen.  Getting slightly hungry, so enjoying a Spanish Rice Dinner tonight, although I left out the protein tuna packet.  Such is the life!

gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640099,"Up early after 38* night in tent! Survived and getting dressed and packed up with no issue. I would probably use a Stuff Sac for Quilts next time in a tent.  It's easier to load that into the Pack when kneeling inside the tent, rather than trying to fill out the bottom of the Pack.  Rolling the Sleeping Pad went well, although I will probably be getting a Trekology Pillow because the S2S Aeros is leaking Air somewhere.  Oh Well, it served me well. Love Coffee with Hot Chocolate to take off the morning chill and breakfast Tucan Sam cereal bars are easy to digest while I wait to get hungry enough for Honey Buns!  On the trail at 6 and hiking the 5 miles down to the road and on to The Hiker Hut, arriving at 9 am .  A little apprehensive because it is off grid and no power or cell reception.  But a busy place with mainly SOBO’s and lucky to get a bunk for the night.  They do have an “on  demand” hot shower that was awesome as well as a double egg and cheese sandwich that really hit the spot, even without hiker hunger yet.  Then at 10:30 a shuttle into town for laundry, big hamburger lunch and more fries than I could eat at Sarge’s Pub! Best place in Rangeley. Went for ice cream for Recon at a super busy place.  Then to the Outfitter for freeze dried meals. Next stop IGA for a few items to get me to Caratunk and Recon to Stratton. Why the difference?  I am not attempting the 4,000 footers!  My ankle is too swollen and my knees are shot.  Haven’t hiked enough miles to make it to the proper shelters in a safe-timely manner.  So instead, holding up here two nights, then a shuttle to Hostel of Maine provided by Steve, Vera or his Sister, who made great suggestions.  Shuttled back to the Hut four hours later and then a cold soak in the stream running through the property.  Very refreshing!  It’s good to see all the hikers, hear stories, and be a small part of the trail community hiking the AT.  Matter of fact, sitting out after dinner, Recon told this hiker our trail names.  He said, hold on, I somehow know you guys.  His trail name was Hawk and it turns out that he was hiking the Vermont Long Trail, while RTK was hiking Vermont in 18"".  So we are all three are in RTK’s book!  Hawk is doing a SOBO section hike down past the Whites! Such a small world and so cool when these Connections happen! I truly believe Section hiking can be more difficult than Thru Hiking. Although, I feel guilty about not pushing the miles and settling for smiles.  I am keeping the Faith while skipping ahead past the Bigelow’s.","Little Swift River Pond Camp

gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640145,"Up early to hike .5 with Recon and then a Loop Back around to Rt 4.  Knee is now very sore and ankle is still swollen. Glad to not hold Recon Back and let him stride on out over the SaddleBacks. Got to go into the town and stopped by the Rangeley Historical Society. It wasn’t officially open,  but one volunteer knew about my Great Uncle's WWII Bomber wreck into Deer Mountain. The other had interesting input and I plan on sharing more details when I get home.  Also got a lead to newspapers during 1942 from the Library as I used there WIFI.   Messaged Joanie, RTK and then received a text and pic from Recon.  He was killing it, but said I was smart to stay put.  Will see him early Sunday at the rate he is moving. Lunch at Sarges again!  Great crock of Chili.  Then Ice cream that I skipped the day before.  Steve suggested calling Hostel of Maine to insure bunks and so I did.  Great idea and Justin recognized the Trail Names, thanks to RTK who had stopped by a week earlier doing research for his platinum blazing book. Then back to the Hiker Hut.  Sat down and really looked through the 2018 Hiker Yearbook.  It was amazing how the trail names (even more than the picture) would transport me back to a very specific, time, location and story from the hike.  Some hikers that complete the trail, may not submit to the book.  However, my thoughts transition to all the hikers I meet on trail as well.  Odie does a great job with this connection resource, year in and year out and it has become part of the totality of the AT experience.  Tired of sitting, I did another .9 Loop and step ups followed by a stream soak and work to get the Be Free flowing better.  Finally some Advil.  All in the hopes of being stronger when I join back up with Recon.  Yet, I still have self doubt in my ability to hike and realize that my days are numbered and retirement is inevitable.  I however, am no longer feeling depressed or a sense of failure.  Instead, the sense of accomplishment is growing as I watch and listen to those currently attempting the trail.  Recon also is an example that there is no failure in this Journey and that we all must have Faith and let God control the outcome.  Breaking my silence, Steve offered a veggi burger and some rice with a broccoli side.  Wasn’t going to eat, but it was very good. Great chat with the SOBO section hiking brothers from Purdue University. Their dad is picking them up in the morning.   You could tell they appreciated him. Just like that, the Hostel is empty with a big crowed expected tomorrow night.  Good thing I am shuttled out in the morning!  Trying to relax and Keep the Faith while I wait to see if I am HikN^.","ME Route 4

Now Closed and weeds growing on railing, but my brain is filled with good, ghostly memories of a sunny past afternoon full of hikers going through packs and resupplies.  My eyes shifted forward to the final yellow blaze road to the Right turn sign for the Newer “Hostel of Maine”. Immediately greeted by the owner while saying goodbye to Vera.  Such quality people supporting the AT.  The experience wouldn’t be the same without all the support putting life into the path.  Way early,  but Justin put me in touch with a Mountain Dew and left me sitting on the porch, his work never ending. I Called Joanie and heard her voice for the first time in a week. She does my soul good and I don’t deserve her.  Then some Spotty connection with Recon, but put together that he is breaking the hike up into two days, so I switched his stay for tonight instead of tomorrow. He said he will have a ride from the trail head no matter what time it is. Once again, The Trail (“God”) Provides.  Once everything was clean and ready, I slipped into room 1 and picked out a couple of bunks/six bunks per room, showered and put on loaner clothes keeping the pack and shoes outside to be placed in a Ski Hut.  Hostels struggle to get hikers to follow simple rules along the trail and it sometimes doesn’t make sense.  “LNT” or Leave no Trace works both on and off the trail. Covid should have taught us something, if Noro and other hygiene issues of the past haven’t!  So rules are good and necessary when hikers congregate and recharge at the Hostels up and down the trail. In my opinion, this one is one of the nicest, if not the nicest Hostel in existence today. Really more of a log cabin retreat.  It is nicer than the Professional Ski Training Facility up the hill at the base of Sugarloaf Mountain. Truly Beautiful and the WIFI means time on phone with the real world.  Something I didn’t do on the Thru Hike except for Journal Updates.  I’m just killing time and waiting to hike the easier Elevations with less percent grade.  I am very relaxed and at Peace for sure.  Getting to that sense of Contentment that is so fleeting in Real Life.  If there is something to take from the trail; for me it has to be minimize, declutter, simplify and find the sense of contentment living in the moment.  I have heard it stated as learning to ""JUST BE""  Much easier on the AT than in the “real world”.  So taking advantage of it while I Keep the Faith, here at The Hostel of Maine.","ME Route 4

gbolt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640258,"Just after 3:00 p.m. yesterday, I got a text from Recon, “Hey gbolt, on the porch!”  Out I went, amazed at the miles he covered and the time he made. But saddened by the knowledge of the  loss of his Father in Law earlier that morning.  I had meet Clyde in 2018 and also saw how great his daughter, Recon’s wife, was to him and all those around her.  A perfect match to Recon.  A death is a hard time on any family and this was no exception.  They handled it with Grace and and hopefully, I wasn’t a stressor at a time when peace is really what is needed. Every Thru Hiker requires the support and sacrifice of a partner, family, and so many others!  I concentrated on being there for Recon even more, reasoning that maybe God’s plan was never for me to be part of his Katahdin Summit.  So many obstacles thrown against one person, hiking the AT, while my hike and life was a lot easier.  I believe I can’t handle as rough a road as Recon and others and am grateful for that blessed fact. I haven’t been tested as often. Recons ability to roll with these obstacles and stay so positive with a wry grin on his face has taught me even more about “Keeping the Faith”.  Recons ability to adjust and smooth out rough patches; is as important in life as self determination to overcome the obstacles placed there to begin with.  An Old prayer was,  “God grant me the serenity To accept the things I cannot change; Courage to change the things I can; And wisdom to know the difference.  Recon has that wisdom. Sipping Coffee and waiting for his daughter and son in law to drive 5-6 hours, he started to look at the possibility and future timing to complete the last two weeks and just under 200 miles to his journey.  I was saddened that I wasn’t going to be part of it.  However, I realized his storied ending is his alone and the reasoning for it may only be revealed to him, personally.  I myself have been so blessed by my time on the Appalachian Trail. I am even more grateful to have had the opportunity to complete the miles and now better appreciate the difficulties involved with 5 1/2 Month long Thru Hike experience.  I now realize how difficult the journey actually was (is) and I have a renewed peace and contentment for my AT Thru Hike.  A journey that I am now realizing didn’t end with the touching of the sign and in a way never well.  That is until God calls us to the greatest Hostel of all!  Whether on a trail for a Thru Hike, Section Hike or short walk, we all must: 
Keep the Faith 
and
Keep HikN^.
