Kinsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552847,"Hi. Welcome, c'mon in, and take a load off. I'm Kevin, henceforth to be known as Kinsman.I'll get the bio thing out of the way here.Originally from Keene NH, spent the bulk of the first 48 years on a family Christmas tree farm while at the same time enjoying a great tech career pretty much since graduating high school. For the most part beyond a wild youth, have generally always done what society expected...take over the family farm, hold a good job, pay taxes. Along the way met a great gal who has been a terrific wife for 30 years. A wonderful son now 23 and out of college...also on the Trail this year.I'm a cyber security guy... architect, practitioner. Spent the last 10 yrs in public service for the State of NH, but when Homeland Security recently wanted oversight of our threat intelligence and data feeds, and the Governor changed the law by executive order on Oct. 28 to facilitate that, well, that was a bridge too far for me. Too many grasping things have been done in the name of 9/11 and federal over reach, and my gut told me this was one of them, so I resigned at the height of my career, from the place I was well on my way to retire from in another decade. Just a few weeks, and already a possible job on the table, with a significant raise (it's an incredibly hot field right now, which isn't going to change anytime soon) and great benefits... and I think even if I get the offer I'm turning it down to go hike the AT. Peak of irresponsibility in most people's eyes (except here in TJ blogs of course). What the hell is wrong with your head? What about your career?I need a break. Cyber security isnt going anywhere. I've long wanted to walk the AT, I'm not exactly new to backpacking and hiking, growing up in the shadow of Mt Monadnock, and having been a trail maintainer for years in southern NH and the Whites. I just figured I'd do it 10-15 years from now at retirement, if I lived that long.Then it hit me the other day as my son is getting prepped for departure...the stars have aligned to do this at 52 instead of 72. Odds of completion go up, odds of injury no more than they are any time I go hiking now, and an easy step back into the career in 6 months (if I find I still want that level of pressure). This opportunity ain't gonna knock twice, it's now or most likely never.I plan to stick to the HYOH ideal, I'm not going out there to be an overbearing helicopter parent, that's never been my thing anyway, and I fully expect my kid that's half my age and a man in his own rights and age to forge on ahead, to do his thing, hike his own hike, live his experience to the max without the burden of Dad, and have the time of his life, now, while he can. At the same time, any shared time on the trail will be fantastic, and a treasured experience. But, I need to reconnect to me, my roots, refresh my soul, and the opportunity has presented to fulfil a dream I'd never really expected to achieve. My wife is supportive though understandably torn, surprised, and apprehensive. This is totally out of nowhere after all... She hikes too though, and we trail angel together in Kinsman and Crawford Notches, so she gets it. And with that I find myself here, in a place I never expected to be, and oddly enough I'm rather eerily relaxed and excited about it at the same time. That's it in a nutshell. UPDATE 1/3: I did not get the job, as I am a bit soft on i-Series systems and that is the employers main platform. He was a little surprised when I said ""Awesome, I couldnt be happier"". So I was thanking the headhunter for his time and mentioned I'd be off grid for a bit, like 6 months. He inquired why and I sort of sheepishly told him. Well, you coulda hit me with a stone. Man, the trail provides I'm tellin' ya...he said call when I get to NH, he'd start looking around, and by the way, when you get to Monson, take this particular road 100 yards off the trail and make yourself at home at our camp. I was stunned, like ""get the F out, seriously?"" stunned. Even doubly so because that is where I stopped plotting to when I was pouring through the Companion this past weekend. My wonderful wife Kristen says it's clearly meant to be. I couldn't agree more.",,Pre hike 1,"Jan 02, Mon",0
Kinsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552856,"Post two of the the obligatory triple I thought I'd give a bit of insight to what I do for fun and what it's like to maintain trail in the Whites.It's quite a bit of time and work, but it's also fun and rewarding to get out and give back.Usually it goes like this... Friday afternoon rush out the office and head for the trail, pack's already in the car. In fact, 2 packs. The 75 liter hauler and a 28 liter daypack strapped to it, plus an extra 20 or so pounds of whatever tools you anticipate using. A dbl bitted cruiser ax or a pulaski, bow saw, hand pruners, and a short handle hoe are pretty standard every trip.So we hit the trailhead about 3 pm. Hike in 3 miles loaded with the standards for a multiday trip, plus the extras noted. 1000' of elev gain and 3 stream crossings...hope the water's low, there are no bridges.We happen to have an established stealth site after several years on the same trail, so in we head, well off the trail and set our hammocks and tarps up. The small fire ring is cleaned and a bit of small wood gathered for later.If it's still light for a bit, we'll grab the daypacks and hand pruners and brush back a 1/2 mile of trail before dinner, noting what waterbars or dips and outflows need cleaning on the morrow. Back at the camp some dehydrated dinners, and it's in bed not long after a small fire.Up with the birds, coffee and pop-tarts, and off we go with destructive and constructive implements for the opposite trailhead up at Kinsman Jct, seeing what's needed on the way up, and prioritizing our time. Then we work all the way back down. That could involve re-setting a bog bridge that has fallen off a corner rock pile foundation, setting new step stones in a mud hole, re-channeling water off the trail. It's almost always about water and getting it off the trail. Then there's the standard fare of blowdown removal like the pic, ditch clearing, and so forth.Back to camp at day end, rinse and repeat as needed.We love to have people stop and ask questions, which they frequently do, and we're always willing to chat a bit, or provide directions for the ""confused"". Many maintainers are skilled in back country first response/first aid and carry well stocked kits while in the field. They'll also know your quickest way to get help should you need it.For me personally, the only thing that gives more satisfaction than the work itself, is the passing thank you, a silent smile and a nod, or wave of a trail user cruising by. Especially that of a Thru Hiker moving in that sure footed blur we jokingly call ""AT speed"". (and sometimes we wonder on whether we'll find you bloodied and bruised in the middle of the trail on the way out, you go so fast it's kind of amazing to watch)You're very welcome, Friend. The pleasure is ours. God speed and watch those wet, off angle rocks!",,Pre hike 2,"Jan 02, Mon",0
Kinsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552869,"My first section hike on the AT was accidental. No I wasn't lost, it was actually the result of boredom. Years of hiking southern NH was becoming dull from repetition. New challenges were in order.I hiked solo all the time as the rest of the family were not really into it, so I'd head off for 3-5 days and hike 50 milers like the Monadnock-Sunapee Greenway and get picked up at the far end.Well, growing up in NH I'd been through Franconia Notch hundreds of times. I remember the Old Man of the Mountain before he fell, up there looking over the Notch and Profile Lake from the Kinsman/Cannon side. Every trip through the Notch my eyes were always drawn to the peaks of Franconia Ridge, wondering what it was like up there, on the other side. So one day I decided I'd find out, and I spent considerable time looking at topo maps. I mapped a route from Franconia Notch to Crawford Notch. I dont recall how I stumbled on it, but somewhere along the way I learned about The NH 48...The 48 peaks in NH over 4000 feet in elevation, and realized I'd go over 8 in the trip I was planning. I quickly realized this was a bit bigger than anything I'd done prior, and it needed far more in-depth research. During that research I discovered the route I'd selected was known as the Pemi Traverse. Essentially the trip is walking the rim of a glacial bowl, the interior of which is the Pemigewasset Wilderness. Cool, I'm thinking, but what's that little symbol and why is this line a different color on this map once I get to Mt Liberty from Mt Flume? It's the AT. No way, really? This is getting cooler by the minute.I asked my son if he wished to join me, and he agreed. The day to depart was near, and final plans laid. We'd go at a time that would put us on the ridges in time for Flags on the 48. Flags on the 48 is a Sept 11 memorial. Every year, on the first Saturday after Sept 11, crews of hikers carry large flags and flagpoles up to all the 48 peaks, and fly them in remembrance from Noon to 2 pm. It's quite moving to see, especially from the Twins, the Bonds, the Franconia peaks, and the Presidentials.Day 1 we're on the trail at 5 am, taking a 6 mile trip up to the peak of Mt Flume, and from there to Mt Liberty, and down to Liberty Spring tent site for the night. A gorgeous day with fine views, though we could see a change in the weather coming, we had no idea what we were in for the next day.Arriving at Liberty Spring, we encountered our first Thru Hikers. Those of you that have read Lost On The Appalachian Trail by Kyle Rohrig and/or Gary Sizer's Where's The Next Shelter will recognize the names I'm about to drop...Just coming in to get water were Mecca, Yukon, RedFoot and K-bar. Little did we know we'd spend the next few days leapfrogging these 4 incredible guys. Anyway, off they went to the Ridge for a stealth, and we set up our tent. The weather started to sock in the mountain, and rain began. Hiker midnight came early.The next morning, weather had gone downhill, but we headed up to the ridge to make our way around to Garfield shelter. What a day...we passed the Thrus up on the ridge. They were hunkered down in their camp site, and waved as we went by. We probably should have taken that as a sign. The weather did not improve. As we were climbing at a snail's pace the winds were in the area of 75 mph, forward progress on the flank of Lafayette was near impossible, the wind and rain blowing up the side, whipping over the top, and back down over nearly knocked us down several times, visibility was just a few feet, finding cairns difficult, and we struggled to even find the White Blazes...but those are what got us through. In hindsight it was not wise to be there...but it sure earned some cred. We made it to Garfield, soaked, exhausted. The caretaker informed us of what we had just come through. I have to admit it was the most difficult and exhilarating moment I've ever had in the Whites. My son was ready to quit, but I informed him I'd made reservations at Galehead hut, and he'd have a dry bed if he could make it to the next day and just a few short miles.We entered the shelter to find 3 Thrus in residence on a zero. One of them was Green Giant himself. GG was kind to a couple locals, admonishing the other 2 guys good naturedly for having monopolized all the wall pegs. They moved much of their stuff so we could hang our soaked gear...Thanks Green Giant! Of course we peppered them with questions and they were all very kind, but I realize we kept them up long after hiker midnight. It was a long night in semi wet gear, Gary informed us the shelter temp was 28 degrees as he was headed out the next day. We never saw Green Giant again but learned he had completed the trail some months later.Later that day we made Galehead hut. Yukon, Redfoot, Mecca, and KBar were doing work for stay. Superman, Spider, and Sunshine stealthed up on Galehead peak.Willy and I dried out, and I went to study the maps. William struck up a conversation with Redfoot...the seed got planted that night that set my son on the AT this year. It's all he's thought of doing for the years since thenNext morning as I struggled up the 1 mile/1500' gain from Galehead to S. Twin, these 4 guys flew by, Yukon pausing to give encouragement, pump me up, and off he went with a fist bump and a smile. It was a long day, and the kid wanted to do twice what I had planned for miles. He wanted a hamburger and a bed. I foolishly consented and cut through the wilderness taking Zeacliff trail to try to shortcut Zealand hut and come out on Ethan Pond trail a couple miles down. What a mistake...it took more out of me than I expected and then struggled the rest of the way. It started to rain, I didnt manage moisture well, and was soon shivering. We made Ethan Pond shelter but it was full. The Thrus were all in there, they offered to make room, cook for me in my sad state, but we said screw it and pushed the last couple miles to the trailhead, and got a room down in Intervale 20 miles south.We'd really taken a liking to these folks on the trail. Next morning we got up early, picked up some donuts, coffee, apples and headed back to the trailhead so we could say goodbye and wish them well.A couple hours later they began to emerge, one at a time about 10 minutes apart. They spent about an hour with us and had to take their leave. As they headed down to Rt 302 we were treated to them belting out the best rendition of Bohemian Rhapsody I've ever heard.Every time I read a journal, or a trail book, and see these names I can only smile, the eyes gloss over a bit drifting to memory. These people have changed our lives forever. They have undoubtedly altered the course of my son's career dramatically. All I can do is wish them all wonderful lives and say thank you for the enlightenment. It's going to be interesting to see what things look like come Fall.",,Pre hike 3,"Jan 03, Tue",0
Kinsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552994,"This is a test of interactive features for family and friends to follow along, know approx where I am, and for the geography challenged.
Two maps will appear in each TJ entry, one that plots the route so far, the other is basics of the current stopping point ie shelter, town, landmark. Click the link to open in a new window, play with the buttons to turn mapping features like satellite view or terrain, on or off. Zoom in and out with the controls at lower right corner. Click waypoint markers on the maps to get info on those particular places.
It will also tell the daily miles, total miles, and it will show a link back to a given Trail Journals entry, in case you land here from a different referrer than TJ. Currently it links back to this entry.
This feature won't go live on a daily basis until my son and I actually leave Springer.
Caveats...Map plots a straight line between way points and the trail is far from straight with a lot of to and fro across that plot line.
Due to cell service constraints, battery life or lack thereof on portable devices, and other field based challenges, this is no where near real-time, and may lag up to a week's time.
Tons of thanks to Airlock ('15), and her husband Gary who actually wrote the code.

Kinsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553499,"The world is lookin' pretty white here in N.H. these days, seems like it snows daily. 
Spending some of the cold days getting some things buttoned up.
Some mundane...
Bathroom repainted. 
Couple vents cut in the living room floor over cellar woodstove. 
Order new battery and front tires for lawn tractor. 
Return the Osprey pack rain cover that didn't fit for exchange.

Others not so much...
Amtrak tix and travel insurance in hand, bedroom on the sleeper car. Concord NH, Boston, Philly, Atlanta. Never traveled on a train beyond commuting distance, a nice little pre-adventure SOBO before The Grand Adventure NOBO.
Hotel reservation in Dawsonville, and ride out to it, locked down. 
Shuttle the next A.M., 8:00ish, booked. Richard Anderson, listed at the ATC site, nice guy, great rate, easy to work with, quick response to email. 
So far all's been nice and smooth, and things are falling neatly into place. 
Last couple minor gear items should trickle in over the next week. I did decide on a new pair of boots, and they're back-ordered til late Feb. Ugh. Always has to be one minor stress point somewhere, right? The current pair would go a while I'm sure, but I doubt the full distance. Been contemplating maybe a Smartwool NTS 250 long sleeved 1/4 zip to replace a thermal underwear top used for sleeping. Would be nice to go feel one, but no one around here has one in stock. I'd love to hear an opinion from someone that owns one...",,Pre hike 5,"Jan 19, Thu",0
Kinsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553740,"Spent some time with a scale, and some miles on the local trails, dialing in on what for me will be an acceptable weight to haul around.I'm looking at 34.5 with 4 days food and included a liter of water. For some that will be just way overboard, and there will be many packs I'm sure substantially beyond that. What matters of course is that it's comfortable. A normal load for me is closer to 50 or more with tools strapped on. I've shed quite a bit for this undertaking. I also wear a heavy hiker capable of such load, as opposed to a trail runner not made for that kind of weight.It's a matter of costs and mitigators. The largest ""cost"" in my gear, in terms of weight expense and effort to move, is my ""house"". I hammock, and that comes with the penalty of weight, 4x that of a UL 1p tent roughly. I could easily swap out an underquilt, straps, tarp, bug net, etc, pick up a tent, and shed 6 lbs, or just use the hammock rainfly and hiking poles to tarp tent, and lose another 1/2-3/4 lb over the tent.I know I'd pay for that change with the currency of daily pain and stiffness on waking and continue paying all day, every day. Thanks but no, I'll take the extra 6 lbs every day and be assured of a decent night's sleep and wake rested/pain free. I'm already hoping that every Smokies shelter I come to is spilling over the edges full, simply so I'm not obligated to sleep on a flat. I carry a sleeping pad but it's for sitting on or lying out in a field enjoying a view. For it to actually be used for sleeping would be a rarity.I could forego a set of sandals and a pound. Crossing streams on unseen slick and/or sharp rocks barefoot, or not spending 5 minutes of pause to change and have soaked boot interiors for 3 days to show for it, is not my idea of fun. Getting air to the feet at the end of the day so they dry out and recuperate is nice too. I did dump some things altogether. The Steripen stays home for reasons of weight as I dropped the Nalgenes which far outweight plastic water bottles. It doesn't seal well to a soda bottle style top. Also, about 2.5 lbs clothing swapped out for some dual use Smartwool baselayer that will work for hiking and sleeping wear. My med kit has been stripped to moles skin, blister treatments, a few band-aids and a very small hotel type sewing kit.All the gear's been on the floor several times, every piece weighed repeatedly, things removed, some added back in that I just know I'd regret having left behind (like the sandals).On other notes, I've pretty much plotted out to just beyond the Smokies in terms of food and associated drops, something I'd not planned on doing many of at all, maybe 3. One of my goal is to carry no more than 3-4 days food at a time and there's only really 4 maybe 5 times I'd need to exceed that. Nothing fancy...a quick hit at Mountain Crossing, a good sized one in Fontana where I anticipate a zero, though debating on moving that out 2 days to Gatlinburg. Definitely one to Monson and will certainly be arranging a mid point bucket in the 100 acre wood, er I mean 100 mile wilderness.That being said, there's not a whole lotta journal updating planned 'tween now and Mar 27, just a bunch of hikes to keep in shape. Once we leave I'll update while on the train and from the hotel the night before hitting the trail. After that I will update as often as possible, posting coordinates to a web page that will show up as a Google map here in my Trail Journals entries, with plot points and lines showing progress.Until then,",,Pre hike 6,"Jan 24, Tue",0
Kinsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555312,"Well a month to go and it seemed a good time for an update. Been a few changes here and there...Found a steal on a rental car that cut the cost of the train trip to GA just about in half, so jumped on that. Managed to wheedle out of a no cancel hotel res in Atlanta for an upgraded room same chain in Gainesville. Shuttle and dates remain the same.Mail drops are all set, all 19 of them, 90% in USPS flat rate containers...you know, ""if it fits it ships"". Lemme tell ya, they're packed to the max. They stop in Bennington VT for the moment, as once I hit Hanover, I'm only 40 minutes from home. Home is also about 25 min from Mt Moosilauke, 40 min from Kinsman and Franconia Notches, an hr from Crawford and Pinkham Notches and another 10 min beyond that to Gorham. Resupply for me across NH is a piece of cake, and there are a couple good slackpack opportunities to be had as well. Maine's drop dates are yet to be determined as I will likely take a day or two off, being so close to home. So at this point I only need to pick up breads, meats, cheese on my town stops. Basically some bagels or wraps, some salami or other hard cured or smoked meat, some laughing cow spread and a cheddar block. Get in quick, get out quick.Gear...I'm following a few hikers myself as I do every year. I have picked up on the fact that water is, shall we say, less than abundant, and it did not get cold enough to knock down the organisms in that water. Sickness seems to be coming on early. The SteriPen is back in the pack and I've managed to figure out how to obtain a good seal to a plastic water bottle. Rain coat...to be honest I detest them, nothing like donning a micro-environment that surpasses and seems like 80% humidy in August even though it may be only March. What a unique torture that is. Why bother has been my experience, either soaked with clean water or in your own sweat, I'll take the clean water if I have to be wet, so I am going to do a bit of a test on the trail...hell of a time to test, live and in color, top rope with no net...but I have tossed my Patagonia Torrent Shell (which for me has been primarily a wind layer, it's the one I have on in the pic) in the closet and purchased a $30 GossamerGear reflective umbrella, a not so common piece of gear that has been quietly triple crowned over and over.Several benefits to an umbrella...this year in particular less water usage is looking to be a top reason, and that translates to less water carried or longer spans between fill ups. (keeping in mind umbrellas were developed originally for shade) Venting is certainly the best it can possibly be short of being in the buff. Weighs a whole 8 oz vs the 12 of the coat. Have quickly and easily rigged a simple velcro strap to retain it over head and pack, so hands are free for trek poles. Makes a nice water gatherer in a rain storm by simple inversion. Keeps a map or phone dry while checking it along the trail. A 10 cent trash bag will suffice for the few minutes I might need a coat while setting up or tearing down the camp tarp. No more of the ""put it on take it off put it on take it off"" of a spotty rain day. Wind will be handled by the down puffy. As an eye glass wearer, there's less fog with no rain coat hood. I was going to carry a Surface and keyboard for ease of journaling, but instead I upgraded a phone as I hadnt done so in several years, and got a 4 oz bluetooth folding keyboard to go with. Boom, 2 lbs gone, and efficiencies gained, with less power needs and an incredible 200 hrs use on a single charge. The new Meindls have finally showed up. After a quick test fit out came the laces and two coats of very hard to find cuz it's not made anymore Kiwi Mink Oil was applied to both boot and lace, the leather is nice and soft with conditioner and break-in has commenced. 2 more coats of oil to be applied just before leaving, probably about the same day that we have a Permethrin session with all the gear getting sprayed down with tick and chigger prevention.So, at a month out conditions are green, all systems go, and counting down the days. Really looking forward to sunrises, sunsets, very cool and gorgeous campsites, new faces, new friends, memories for life, sights and smells of Appalachia, and maybe a little fishing along the way since I treated myself to a pen sized micro rod and reel.",,Pre hike 7,"Feb 28, Tue",0
Kinsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555970,"Clock's ticking down a little quicker now. A couple Robins showed up yesterday, but it snowed today and a Nor'Easter coming in a few days.Nearly a whiteout coming through Crawford at 7:30 AM today, after having just stopped down at the 302/Webster Cliff crossing to photograph a couple feet of the white stuff on the trail.Cleaning up a couple loose ends with the AMC before heading out. If you've read me this far you know I do some volunteer trail work, and am the Kinsman Regional Leader for the Adopt a Trail program in the Whites, which is also volunteer. Kinsman Notch to Franconia Notch AT miles, about 18, are under my purview for gathering adopter work reports. I was discussing my absence with my Program Director of course and as well mentioned I'd like, with their permission, to try to do a little good will work along the trail. To put it simply, things are a little different here in NH, or rather they seem so to some, in regard to campsite fees and there are some in the Thru Hiking community that don't like some of the policies. I get it, and I can assure you, the AMC gets it, too. Who ever wrote a policy everyone liked? I know I never did, and that was 50% of the cyber security job for 10 yrs. I was a policy wonk. There's a whole lot more dislike than like most of the time, but once cooler heads settle in and folks see something other than their own perspective and needs, they realize it's for the best. Most of the time anyway.Now, before people get wound up, let me put it right out there I'm not taking sides, because I'm already right smack dab in the middle by default, right? For me it's about making sure places stay open and accessible, and in decent shape instead of littered with human shit every friggin place I look out there. (there are quite a few places like that, take my word for it...) Pretty simple when you get right down to it. I will gently point out a couple honest points though...we all pay to traverse the Smokies, Shenandoah, and there's some pay sites in VT. The first two in that list are on National lands. In NH, keep in mind you don't have a fee at shelters/campsites until you hit the National Forest. That's the key. AMC doesn't own the sites, they manage them. It's the U.S.Forest Service that is the land owner. The public pays day use fees of $3 per person per day at trailheads, I opt for an auto window sticker for $25 annually for unlimited trailhead use, weekenders pay the same camp fees you and I do. AMC members get 10% off sites and merchandise...they've already paid quite a bit more in their membership fee anyway, it all goes the same place in the end. Yes, full disclosure, of course I'm a member in good standing. That being said,, I've got some terrific news. While in Pinkham Notch Wednesday I met with the AMC Campsite director. We discussed a program he has just rolled out and rather than my try to regurgitate the whole thing, please take a minute and read the document in the picture of the day. I think you'll be pleased if you're a hiker. If you aren't one, but know one hitting the trail this year, please bring their attention to this post.I've seen the actual passes, they are a good deal cost-wise, and you'll just have to trust me that I say that without bias. I'm excited, and part of it is because the first place you can get this Pass, which is fashioned a bit after those in the southern Parks, is at ""my"" shelter/campsite that's on the trail I maintain and adopt, Kinsman Pond, if you're NOBO. (Speck Pond SOBO)The program is live, the Hut Croos and the Site Caretakers are up to speed. Boiled down, full price 1st night, half after that, no matter how many you use of the 9. 2 baked goods and a bowl of soup (which was bottomless last time I had one) included at whatever Huts you wish to get them at. 10% off merch, like a hat or pair of gloves...hint, hint...at the Huts. (you can do pretty well on that one...make your initial $10 back depending on what you might get).The shelters/camps all have reliable water, hardened tent sites or platforms, privy, and no turn away guarantee...no matter what, you have a spot. Bear boxes too...and from personal experience up all night once 2 years ago a few miles from Guyot with a bear harassing me, concerned enough to not dare let the fire die, throwing whatever came to hand into the brush, I am definitely a believer in food care. (and mine was hung, but close to me in a cramped site).Anyway, just a little PSA to pass along. If you see me on the trail, feel free to ask me about it. Please do not inundate my Journal email via the Guestbook. You can direct the questions to the Director, he's placed his email on the letter and this letter is posted on many of the Socials as well. Background...he was the caretaker at Kinsman shelter for 3 yrs, I believe he was also at Guyot for 1. He's a real nice guy, young, open to ideas. He put quite a bit of time and effort into making this happen, and it's straight from hiker survey results. One of the numbers dropped my jaw...between Nobo/Sobo/Section hikers in 2016, 2500 AT hikers came through the campsites. That's a tremendous increase from just a few years ago. But, when asked in the surveys taken, the majority indicated a willingness to obtain a pass of this nature.People do listen, we're all in it together, and I hope this proves useful to each and every one of you as you traverse the Whites.",,Pre hike 8,"Mar 09, Thu",0
Kinsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557224,"Trying not to climb the walls til next week, beating back the second guessing of gear choices, have I planned appropriately, and the new trail nerviness that I always experience headed onto new ground in anticipation of what the terrain really looks like vs the map. Taking at this as a project, best tackled in pieces methodically. Keep telling myself it's not a hike, it's 165 hikes give or take a few, they just happen to be strung together. Work it accordingly. Plan the hike, hike the plan, you've been doing this since you were a boy scout. The only thing changing is the scenery.So for the last 2-3 weeks to keep myself engaged I've been through the AWOL guide, in conjunction with the Guthook app at times. Planned my days, ID'd the desired evening stop points, and alternates if the day has not seen the miles required. Used to be I'd plan a given days miles around campsites and shelters even if it meant short miles, but the hammock has relieved that need for a reasonably flat space for a tent, and for the last couple years it's water sources as primary criteria, distance points and beneficial terrain features such as a rock ledge or a hollow to block wind after that. Shelter spacing just doesnt enter the picture any more from a planning perspective.Gear is set as it's going to be, boots broke in real nice, drops are packed, sealed, stored in a cool closet. This would be a fine time to introduce my best friend and wife, who is pulling duty for resupply being in place and on time. She hikes a bit, is a terrific Trail Angel, best life partner I could've asked for, and without her I could not do this. She needs a Trail Name...I've dubbed her Quartermaster. Quartermaster is on board, she may get shackled with a guest journal entry now and then, too. In addition to her enviable resupply gig, she's a security guard at an outdoor concert venue, works with disadvantaged kids, and is a White Mtn Nat'l Forest Trails Ambassador. She also does quite a bit with the National Lupus Foundation and Lupus Foundation of New England. If you feel an urge to donate to a worthy cause, I can tell you first hand every cent counts and is much appreciated. It's an awful affliction, with no cure, yet. www.lupus.orgThere's some folks I'd like to thank, acknowledge (or maybe curse), probably a little of both, depending on the days to come, for infecting me with the fevah only Katahdin can quench.The hook was definitely set by Alan ""Gonzo"" Strackeljahn.

Thanks to each and every one of you that has decided to hook up a wagon and read along. Some I know of, others I don't, all provide drive, each one another reason to persevere when the days are worst. I know there will be those days, this is a mental game far more than physical. I'll reply to emails as I can when signal allows. My last thoughts are that the physical challenge is just a small part of the journey, the bigger hurdle is the mind. There will be days when I place boot to trail, and the trail will have days it puts boot to my ass. I'll shoot for a draw. Accepting everything the trail dishes out, adapting down to the basics, overcoming the adversity, and at the same time recognizing and accepting it's blessings...those are the hard parts I think.Finally, I gotta give a shout out to Leki. My son, sponsored by #ThruHikerSyndnicate, of which Leki is part, scored me a new set of collapsible Leki Micro-Vario carbon trekking poles with push button collapse and a nice little shock absorber down at the tip, for my 52nd b-day that was on the first day of Spring, Mar 20.

Kinsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557925,"Greetings from Gainesville, G.A.Yup, we made it. An interesting ride this morning though, an hour in the fog at rush hour traversing the Smokies. More than once we wished we were walking already. Later, almost got backed into by a truck in a McDonald's parking lot 20 min from the hotel. The 25 mile destination danger zone, and Murphy's law, both still strong it seems.Some nice looking countryside to see, very different from New England but in many ways the same as well. Lots of the similar/same trees, and though I haven't seen many birds yet I recognize some trilling in the nearby neighborhood to be a cardinal and some robins, some mourning doves cooing, and I did see up close and personal a couple female turkey vultures as we walked a mile or so to the post office to send our radar detector home along with a couple pairs of socks and a Leki bag.Speaking of radar detectors...glad I brought it. Quiet all the way down to V.A., a few speed traps there, but G.A....wow. Gotta be more cops here per square mile than bears, no pun intended. We didn't go 5 minutes over the entire 50 in state or so miles without seeing one. Was worth the $7 to ship it back home several times over I have no doubt.The hotel here, Best Western Plus Lake Lanier, gets 5 stars and a recommendation. Great staff, nearly 4 hr early checking, free upgrade to a suite as the room wasn't ready, Keurigs....didn't think I'd see one of those for a bit, real creamers, not powders. You get the picture. Good rate, and my new AARP card (that does make me chuckle a bit typing it) was honored as well.Met a guy from Oregon at the check-in counter with an Osprey Atmos well laden. Pretty clear he starts tomorrow, too. Poor guy looked beat, long flight. Another little sign appeared...probably a bit early to call it trail magic but the trail as I always say provides...a nice cold bottled beer sitting in the fridge. Someday when I have nothing to say I'll tell about the can of Bud that magically floated down a Whites Mtn stream to the Quartermaster and I, above the Birches camp ground in Gorham....and no one was up the trail. That was a little trippy.Ran across a 6 lane to get to Aldi's. Nothing like that store in our neck of the woods, so that was new and different. Inexpensive as well. House brands keep things down I guess is their game. Brought approx. $23 in coinage for tolls, used $3, so unloaded most at the Hardy's next door, a few more in hotel soda machines drinks, and we kept a buck in quarters each for the trail.The furnace is on down here....humid, 80, and it's just the beginning, but like winter we gotta climatize a bit. Tomorrow supposed to be beautiful, rain 80% Thurs, then nice again, rain back Monday. That works, a rainy day one would kinda suck a bit, so blessed again.Been through the pack one last time, as ready to go as I need to be. Not one to wish my life away, I do wish it was this time tomorrow, and the day was winding down. The butterflies gone, initial miles down, last bit of reality set in...yeah, you're really here Bro.

He noticed my AMC and maintainer patches and we chatted for a few minutes...but the siren call of the Trail beckons, and off I must go to make my way backwards on the AT a mile to the summit. A very gentle trail, maybe 300 ft elevation gain per mi winds out in front of me on a gorgeous morning of blue sky and wispy clouds. Arriving at the summit in short order, I have it to myself for quite a while, but soon dayhikers and peakbaggers start arriving. Ridgerunnner Andrew stops by around 11 and we discussed the AMC Thru Hiker Pass and he happily took a copy of the letter to post at the State Park.It a small world...met a thru from Concord NH, cousin of a guy I used to work with, who just had to have a picture to send him at work. Hi Brendan P in DoIT. Great guy your cousin.After a few hours at the summit Will arrived, and once he downed a quick lunch we set off on another short 5.2 mi to set camp at Long Creek Falls. I had a terrific hang, about 70 yrds below the falls, which promised a relaxed evening and a soundtrack for sleeping.Dinner for the evening was chicken and rice in a nice chicken gravy, hit the spot and just the right size.Trail conditions pretty good, nocomplaints.

Kinsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558485,"Late start due to some foot concerns with Will, so on trail at 9. Looking for a 13 miler to Ramrock Mt., we didn't come close. Gentle trail around to Hawk Mt shelter we we met Ridge runner #2. He cleared up some rumors regarding bad water ahead, and wished us a good hike.
Sassafrass Mt, the first climb of the day, gave a feel for what the trail is really like after yesterday's long downhill. 500-700 gain, a little rock but still a nice treadway. While stopped for lunch near the top, after Will had gone ahead a bit, another hiker came by asking if I had lost a pack towel and rain cover. No, but it seems Will had...so I went back down a 1/2 mile to collect it, and back up of course. That was more energy spent than wanted, and I needed a bit more caloric intake for Justus Mtn., and Will's feet needed attention.
A storm coming, we decided to stop at Cooper Gap to camp. We set up about 50 yrds down on the lee side of the ridge. 
After a delicious dinner of sweet and sour pork with rice, we settled in for the blow to come. Not long to wait either, the wind came up the other side of the gap like a freight train, thunder and lightning directly above, we got the rain, but never felt the wind that would have folded a tent rather handily. Site selection is key to a safe night, and camping on ridgetops can end in unwanted surprises like a tent in your face at 2 am, or swinging like a pendulum in a hammock.
While at the gap, a 72 yr old named Chocolate Chip decided he was to leave the trail. We flaggwd a passing car, trail angel Grateful stopped, and said he'd be back in20 for the evac. Help CC pack his gear and waited til Grateful returned. Sorry to see CC go, but better than risking debiliating injury.

Cooper Gap to just south of Lance Creek.

Awoke to a clear morning and turkeys gobbling around the valley below us. None the worse for the boomers last evening, we broke camp around 8. William is going to speed on ahead to make Neel Gap asap and have The Quartermaster send down his broken-in Meindls that have never caused him issues. I plan on a mile less than he. Lance Creek for him, and another ridge lee-side for me, for this evening. 
Tomorrow he'll bang out the remaining 10 or so. I will likely short up of that at Jarrod Gap, which begins a bear cannister restriction to camping without one, continuing to Neel Gap 5 miles further.
Too much push with a climb over Blood Mt, the highest point in GA, late in the day, for me I think.

Starting the day 3 miles into a 6 mile stretch with no water sources flowing, the Army has fortuitously parked a tanker in the Gap that hikers are welcome to fill from, and I topped up 2 liters and set out.

The first climb is Justus Mt, which proves to be less challenging than Sassafras before, but no slouch either. Nice switchback grades provide a steady incline on a smooth trail. From here it is ridge walking, following the countour of the land, a steady gentle climb. Next comes Gooch Mt,  and finally the previous days goal of Ramrock Mt. A nice climb with a view to reward  the effort. Following is a 600' climb out of Woody Gap over Big Cedar Mt. 

That's it for climbing today and I settle in to a 2 mph gait to chew up the remaining 2 mi for the day to camp between Dockery Lake Trail and Lance Creek campsite and streamside restoration project, neccesary due to excessive camping in the area, and which  I know to be full from Will. ( It is awesome having trail intelligence like this, from William out front, and with the Guthook app which we are both commenting to along the way)

Tanking up from a hillside rivulet, scanning for suitable camping sites ahead, I locate one in an unnamed gap a 1/4 mile further down trail, and made myself at home.

Another good hang looking over the valley, some deer moved across my view to the creek below. Winding me in my humble nest as the cooler air thermals move downhill, they snort and run, white flags bounding down the dale below.
Dinner tonight consists of pork sausage gravy and biscuits, and it was just right for a cool evening. Stick to the ribs comfort food.  As darkness grows the lights of Dahlonega appear in a gap between the hills to the East, and sleep comes easy.

Kinsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558722,"Day 4 

Unnamed Gap to Neel Gap.

Started late, around 10, expecting a short day to Jarrod Gap, but was there by noon, 7 hrs of daylight left, 5.1 miles. Over the ill-reputed Blood Mt, which has a taste for knees, ankles, and toes. Bear cannister zone. 

About 11 I get a text from Will...he, Murph, and Joe have arranged a cabin in Neel Gap, to nero and resupply, and the 4th bed is mine if I push. Sold.

What the hell, way too early anyway, so off I went. A mile up I dropped pack and scarfed down a tuna wrap with mayo and chopped onion. Power charge...
I have a habit of failing to eat enough, always have, and I'm working on that. Taking a 20 min break, boots off, I steel myself for the grind to come. 

A nice view from my table, which is a large rock trailside. The forest is beginning to take on a green tinge from leaf buds opening. Enough chilling out, it's time lace up and grind out 5.

Tuna powered pistons, the knees don't complain and I summit Blood around 4, an easier climb than Sassafras, but the coming descent is quite steep, trying to make a hiker brake with their knees, ankles, and smash toes in poorly fit or tied boots. Experienced none of that as I'm locked in place in a heavy boot, and trekking poles ease the smash of heel to trail.

I make Neel at 5:50 pm, too late for a pizza at Mtn Crossing Outfitter, but managed to grab a couple cheeseburgers, made my way half a mile to Blood Mt Cabins, and flopped in my queen bed. After 10 minutes prone, the most splendid shower evah ensued. 

Brews and pizza tonight, getting to know our new friends better, I managed one of each and crashed hard, Joe soon thereafter, as Murph re-did his pack and chatted with Willy. Guy has a 20 baseweight. Nice.

The day would not disappoint.Stopped at Will's tent, he was stirring so we chatted a few min and off I went. 8.8 here we go...gentle climbing for the first couple, alone on trail, skies darkening , i reached the summit of Poor Mtn, and had it to myself, as lightning pealed and the thunder rolled around me, rain threatening and visible in the near distance. Up and on my way again, the sky soon opened up to moderate rain. I actually love this exact condition...its cool, so heat produced balances just right. Stop long and get cold, so very short breaks, on 300 ft per mi incline like an old railbed, and the miles just go by.  Summit of Sheep Rock Top, after 2 miles on the ridge and a long drop to Low Gap.Spent the time wet, by choice,  shell open, sleeves to the elbow, OR pants vented hip to knee. In places the trail became a stream for long distance, no problem.The Meindls, with 3 coats of mink oil before leaving,  kept the dogs dry all day. Theyve performed well so far,  no blisters, toe or ankle issues and yeah you bet your ass i just knocked on the closest stick I could find.A fuel stop at Low Gap when Will caught up and i offer him half the hot food I was to make. He agreed, so I fetched water while he dug out a stove, and out came of mtn hse mac and cheese, gone near as fast, and off for the 5 remaining miles. Stormed all day from there on but still great trail, gentle, nearly smooth.Made Chattahochee a couple hrs later, Will awaiting me in the rain at the bottom as he had overtaken me about half way there. As i came into the Gap I pointed to the woods to the side, hollered over the tempest, said I was getting out of the wind, and over the edge I went, quickly  finding what I hoped would be a good pair of trees. Dropped pack and as the rain let off for a couple minutes I stripped rain top, shirt, and dove for dry clothes, slid into them, a down puffy, whipped out the umbrella and got my tarp up pronto.  It was only 2 pm. Nice.  Took my time making camp under the tarp, eventually settling in and donning a Smartwool baselayer set. Nice and toasty and in the down cocoon.Wicked pissah of a blow goin on down here as i write, wickedest weve seen yet. The sky is some kinda lit up. Under my tarp, rocks piles on the stakes in this soft and rich soil just in case...in the 30s tonght, getting wet will suck unbelievably, and make for a long long night. Its gonna be damp the way its blowing nowH ammock strung maybe 3 inches off the slope and a big dead log just inches uphill. Dry and warm so far.  Had a great dinner of Alpine Aire Minnestrone soup, which is loaded with veggies, and a dessert of raspberry crumble...rasp. sauce and crushed choc cookie on top. A dose of sugar and a pick me up for what we know is goinv to be a long and potentially wet cold 11 hrs til dawn.It wasnt long coming, wind like a train, the way it blows between the hills, it just sounds ferocious like nothing Ive ever heard in New England. Several hours during the night it rained buckets, wind changing ridgeside and now coming up slope from below me...not good for keeping a roof on, and I was forced to extend my arms out from the hammock, grasp the tarp mid point each side, and hold it against the wind, if it lifts off im drenched, and in my dry set. At 37 degrees and 40-50 mph wind thats near instant hypothermia, so Im pretty motivated to stay up until 2 am like this, when it finally subsided. I did stay dry, and warm thankfully.Will reserved a room at a hotel in Hiawasee, 5 miles in the AM to Unicoi Gap, shuttle to town at 915 or 1115. Shooting for the latter.

Precipitation changing from rain, freezing rain, snow, sleet so far now hinting at a few rays of sun and a less challenging descent to the Gap.I arrive at the bottom, Willy waiting, several others not far off, to wait 15 minutes for the free shuttle into Hiawassee. In short order it arrives, wet smelly packs and hikers pile in, and off we go. We arrive at the hotel, and as it would happen we had the only reservation, all others were turned away. Lobby coffee never tasted so good, as we did our paperwork, and we're handed the key.Making our way to 110, we knock at 109 to say hi to Joe and Murph, who are getting back on trail Saturday,  and who arrived here a day earlier.

I split it with Will and we set on the chips as gear starts dropping on floors, beds, tables, chairs, curtain rods. Heat maxed, it's soon a sauna. A quick shower, and I'm off to Ingles.  Great store, wish we had some in NH, closest in Portland Maine the staff tell me.I'm on a mission...to the olive bar. 2 large plastic containers, then a few slices of green, yellow, and red bell pepper fall in one of them. Following are some baby gerkins, some turkey and ham straps. Close it and move on...next is some cucumber/tomato/onion salad in an Italian dressing in a small round container. Now for the real stars of  the show, a head of iceberg, a pair of hothouse toms drop in my basket. Stop at the deli...6 slices of dripping rare Boars Head roast beef...plus the slice the lovely young lady handed me to sample, and it's time to find some feta cheese.Grabbing some hot salsa and chips for Will as I make my way to the front, and a rack of bud cans fell in the basket somewhere along the way too apparently.I practically ran the half mile back to the room, split everything with Will, ... then constructed/destroyed the masterpiece above, after topping it with some NH cranberry-pear infused olive oil and vinegar I've been packing since day 1, in anticipation of this very moment of simplistic culinary bliss, in about 10 minutes. Sipping a Bud, plans are made to do the BBQ later with several groups, they'll come get us when ready, so now a good time to settle in, relax, call home.The BBQ ends up being about 12 hikers, we have the place to ourselves, and conversations are light, happy, trail and home related. Politics, religion, and other drains on life never arise. This is family around the dinner table, and it's a good time. This is the kind of America and warm gracious people I remember, part of what I'm out here looking to see still lives, and it is heartwarming to find it so quickly. We finish up as the place closes soon after dinner. We'll hang out with Joe and Murph a couple hours, share some boxed zinfandel Joe doesn't want to carry up 3000 feet tomorrow, and hear each other's plan. I retire a bit early to catch up on journals.

I lingered in the down cocoon a while as the sun rose, giving it time to take the chill off.  Crawled out about 7, started packing things up. Coffee sleeve and 2 sugars in 8 oz cold, in a squirter bottle, couple shakes and pour it in to kickstart, on the trail a bit after 8:30. 9 miler set for today, mostly long gradual up, a couple nice views, and a really nice site at Cowart Gap if we get there. Still feeling yesterday a bit, but I'm not alone in that. So the trail was still very pretty today, but it was a bit mundane. Thought I'd take this opportunity to introduce you to The Master. Also known as the monkey on my back, the bitch, trail boss, and several other choice names not fit for print.This is, of course, my feed bag. Yeah, I'm it's mule, I'm it's bitch. It rides me all day. In the evening I love me some feed bag. My sweetie, giver of sustenance, how could I go without you. I seek it's open bosom, and draw down its zipper, and take from its bounty.In the morning I personify and curse it roundly. Yeah, I got a love/hate relationship goin' on here. All is not lost, there is a strategy to everything out on The Trail.Eat the heaviest things first, no simpler rule can there be, and it does work. Each day about a pound and a half should be eliminated. It sucks the max climbing 1500 feet out of a gap with a full load.Thankfully, I've yet to be in need and have it empty, probably never will as I always pack, and always have packed, 1 extra day just in case of injury, illness, or weather forcing a day in place. Swollen rivers after a heavy rain causes this condition regularly, and you can't get out the way you came in without risk to life. Hikers drown in the Whites unfortunately all to often, and this is often why.Well, enough introductions. On to more pleasant thoughts....Sitting here in camp, Willy has a small fire going in the ring, something we don't often do. The orange glow is comforting, takes the chill off the cool evening. An ample supply of dead wood lays around down here, pretty much everywhere. Dinner tonight was Knorrs Asian Sides...rice and pasta, chicken flavored,  peas, and carrots and a chicken sauce. Supplemented that with a half package of Tyson chicken dumped in. Since we're on food...the new breakfast power bags are getting a big thumbs up. Seem to be just right to keep a slow drip going. I think my Mom will let me slide on the two Little Debbie Oatmeal cream cake I start the day with. Also able to eat a quickie lunch with 1 10"" wrap,  1/3 of a single serve cup of PB, and a squirt of jam, hits the spot, and convenient about the same time the boots come off to cool the dogs mid morning.Happy, warm, and dry. Goodnight from the AT.A huge Thank You to Sasquach for a quick code review and email with the fix to make a map display properly.

Kinsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559620,"It was a gorgeous sunrise in the Gap, no wind, an owl hooted just minutes after I woke from a tree just behind us.Laid in the hammock a bit to dissipate the sweat in my tee shirt, then slid into my shorts and heavy tech wick while in the hammock and started breaking camp slowly. A short day planned, 7 and change, to the border of NC and camp about 300 yards over it.Just as we were ready to leave who comes trucking down the trail...hey. lookee there, its Joe. Good to actually have a chance to hike with him.
A nice relaxed lunch at Plumb Orchard Gap shelter with Joe and Will, and I was first out knowing I'd be last in tonight. Grabbed a photo with Willy at the sign post and went to gather water. Joe was somewhere, we didn't know how far he'd gone, and Will and I were both prepared to do another mile or two to catch up if needed. Turns out he was yards away, and we are all camped, along with what must be the second bubble, as there's probably 25 tents, almost a dozen hammocks, here on the knob.Absolutely beautiful sunset tonight...it had folks lined up on the path, cameras and phones in hand, looking out over some hazy lesser mtns and ridges, light pink, purple hues with the blazing glow sinking behind them. The yet leafless trees back-lit on the ridges nearby. Incredible.Trail today was one long up, and tiring as it was, we all feel pretty good and looking forward to another good day tomorrow. The plan is for 12... a long day for me but I will try to rise right at 530 and get myself rolling, hopefully on trail by 630, so I can take advantage of the cool morning air.Dinner tonight was an Alpine Aire entree...barbecue chicken in beans and rice. Super-duper. This one is top shelf backpacker food and will definitely be purchased again in the future. Always had good luck with this company and if you want a change from backpacker pantry or Mtn house, I would recommend giving these folks a try.A quick thank you to all the wonderful people I met in the great state of GA. Warm, dry, and happy. Goodnight from the AT in NC.

Kinsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559833,"Awoke naturally at 5:28, and the internal alarm was set for 5:30. No time for dalliance and dorking around, I expect to need every minute of the day to do a 12er.Sat up after working my way into the techwick shirt, grabbed the previously staged wool socks and liners, work the toes into the toed Injinji liners, slide on the wool, boots next, gaiters already attached and lock them on. Grab the shorts off the embankment in front of me, and step in to them and out of the hammock as I pull them up. Grab the headlamp from the pocket on the hammock and flip on the red mode to preserve my night vision and not wake my neighbors literally 3 feet to each side but not behind, as I'm hung on the hillside beside the row of tents. Gotta love those hammocks, my view is unobstructed. Packing goes quickly, not as fast as I'd like, but I work silently, as people stir and roll on their air mattresses, and someone is softly snoring. Still of the morning, my favorite part of the day, as things wake up, cool air for outdoor work or hiking as the case is.I'm about done as Will, Joe, and Jane start popping heads out, Anchor is not far behind. I mix a 4C strawberry packet in my bottle, sling my pack up, ""see ya later"" and I'm gone. 1st out, 1st on the two brutal peaks within the first 2 miles. Up on the ridge there are miles of easy walking, 2-3 mph stuff, clear almost rock free, and I settle into a long gait. Gotta keep ahead of the herd that's behind me, I'm expecting them, actually Willy the Mtn Goat, to come within hearing distance any moment, but I've got the cool air on the shaded side of the ridge, rhododendron tunnels and easy open trail all to myself.   It took a while, and as expected he catches up.After 7.7  by 11:30 I swung into Standing Indian Shelter for refuel and water, expecting to and finding Will waiting.  2 tuna/mayo/relish wraps and 45 minutes with the boots off, I'm suiting up as the first hiker, Jane, wanders in. ""Hi and bye, have an awesome day"", a long climb but I'm charged, throw on Molly Hatchet Flirting with Disaster album and  something clicked. Right tempo and beat and the big afternoon climb up Standing Indian Mtn, 800 feet of switchbacks and contour climbing.  More easy sailing after this last summit. Rounding the last rise, there's swing to the other side of the ridge and 2.5 to the bottom and Beech Gap, tonight's camp. At .9 I stopped for a small break, no rush it's only 2:30, and all of a sudden Will is coming down the trail. I'd passed him at some stop somewhere. After a quick greeting he took the lead and was shortly out of sight3 pm, 12 done, in camp. Pretty freaking sweet . An awesome day, awesome hike, out in front except for the Goat...should be his trail name but I named him once already...Pulled out all the tricks today, I did not want to end up in the midst of what is behind me by an hour or two at best...we do what we call straightening and leveling the trail.  We ski and snowboard, it's natural to ""pick a fall line"" for both of us, stem-christie our poles in corners, hug inside corners only, never the outer edge, as straight a line as possible within the treadway for as far as possible, and repeat it continuously, stay up on the rocks and boogie along the tops like at home whenever possible,  never climb or relinquish an inch you don't need to, ""level"" the trail as best you can to as easy a grade as possible, use every root, rock, dip, waterbar and step  stone to your advantage. I would not be surprised if we shaved a half mile off the 12, but have no way of knowing for sure. It certainly made a difference, and it was incredibly fun.Joe rolled in, we had a spot saved for him. Anchor got here so she is close by, `Bama here as well, can't miss the accent any more than mine. Getting to be a loose group here, good folks. Hope it can stick together a bit.Dinner tonight Rissoto rice and pasta with Chicken Backpackers Pantry...very good. Parmesean sauce, corn, broccoli, red bell pepper, chicken chunks. Coffee and a PB and strawberry jam wrap for dessert. A pretty perfect day for all of us.

",Albert Mtn.,"Apr 11, Tue",11.90
Kinsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559963,"Today started much the same as yesterday,  and went smoother, packed and out by 6:20 after wishing Joe a good day as he popped out, no sound from Will's tent, so off I went by headlamp, and as I hit the trail, tapped it from red to white lighting.Nice easy flowing trail, though a good number of  blowdowns to navigate along the first couple miles. Moving through last year's fire zone. Some places just surreal, dead rhododendron everywhere. Yesterday's pic is titled Sleepy Hollow, because moving through this stuff in the dark, I felt like Icabod Crane expecting the Headless Horseman to come round the bend on his black steed, flaming pumpkin head in hand.The miles and hours went by quick today, and after coming out of the woods with a fresh load of filtered water for the 2 mile ascent of Albert Mtn, I spy a gentleman my age leaning on a truck. He motions me to join him and two other hikers who had also tanked up just before me. Trail Magic. I fist bump, introduce myself and thank him right away for his bounty of pine apple chunks, strawberries, clementines, oranges, bananas, and apples, OJ and coffee. This is Trail Angel Rodney. Perfect Magic, in just the right place on trail. I hang a few minutes, enjoying strawberries and pineapple, a cup of OJ, and in my pocket goes an apple as a reward when  I summit Albert, where there is a firetower and a 100 mi view. I make my farewell to TA Rodney, a fist bump, and "" that really was just right, it's gonna get me over, thanks , Man. Thanks for doing this."" ...and Im gone, delighting in the magic of fruit I hit the trail again. Spun up a little Three Dog Night...Never Been to Spain followed by Road to Shambala. Followed that up with some live CSN...Crosby belting out a mean Almost Cut my Hair and Long Time Gone to set the hiking mood after Magic. The trail is direct, lots of log steps, some nice little granite ledge climbing reminiscent of up north, and it's quite steep. The view is definitely worth the climb. Whipped up a PBJ, eat it and my wonderfully juicy apple, and after about a half hour resting feet and getting ready to go, Will summits. Only one of our group I've seen today, 9 miles in by noon, 3 to go for our planned site. We chat a bit, ask another hiker to take our pic, he's going to hang a bit and I'm headed for camp. Will comes by me a short time later, and soon out of sight beyond the bend. All downhill, it's a quick 2.9, only 2:30. 7 mi plan for tomorrow, when Will, Joe, and I will head to Franklin for resupply and a shared room. I can go more, and want to, so at the next water hole I tell Will I'm going further, maybe another hour. Went about 2, so camped just shy of Rock Gap, where we get our shuttle I believe. Easy morning for me while I wait for them to get here, assuming at this point Joe made it to where Willy is, and join them on the way out.Great hang tonight,mover looking a valley with a few homes in it as the lights coming on show me. Pack of coyotes howling down there in the farmland somewhere. Solitude. Crickets, and others in the night insect symphony. I built a little fire ring and may have a small fire tonight, there's no wind, just still, moon coming up off to the left through the hills. Going to be a beautiful night.Dinner...Mtn House beef stew. This is a good staple and always delicious, just need the patience to let it sit 2x what the package says and stir frequently for full rehydration of the potatoes and peas. Rich sauce and nice junks of beef. PBJ wraps and coffee for dessert. I eat pretty good as you've seen. I'm not starving, yet. I do crave some things....cheese pizza, a Chicago style hotdog, vanilla ice cream with real maple syrup on it, vegetables of all sizes, shapes, and colors, a bowl of wonton soup, and a  fish filet from Burger King. Betcha I can do it all tomorrow.  :> And have room for more....  Gluttony.  I also understand from Joe, that there's not 1, but 2 micro breweries in town. (His biz was selling craft beer, and not on a micro level either. Knows his stuff, knows his brews. This could be a really good time!)Happy, fed, warm, and dry.

Kinsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560113,"Resupply in Franklin was easy but for one task...refilling a prescription from my cardiologist in NH down here in NC.I use CVS. National brand, pretty much everywhere, not in Franklin though, where I happen to be down to my last 2 Crestor generic. Sort of a needed pill...along with a couple others. 3 heart attacks at 42 does that to a person if, like me, they're lucky enough to survive it to begin with.Shouldn't be a big deal, I have the script number, bottle, etc. Just transfer it. This is the big task of the day. I needed some fuel, a couple entrees, and I could score a free hiker tee from Three Eagle Outfitter, right across the street for a $25 purchase, and those items made $28 and change. Tee shirt and bag in hand, and with another 6% thru hiker discount in savings,  I inquired about a pharmacy.These folks were so nice they took me to Walgreens several miles away and asked if I wanted them to wait. Knowing this would take a while I thanked them for their incredible kindness, and declined the return ride. TEO gets a major thumbs up and a recommendation, sweet, kind people and the owner is of course a hiker. Then the fun began.  I forfeited my healthcare when I resigned, but did get a family catastrophic plan before we left. Basically unusable. This prescription of Crestor, that was $1 under my health plan before, is $996.00 brand name and almost $700 generic. Ouch, right?It's all good, I use Blink Health, a discounter anyone can use after a free sign up. Search the med you need, it gives you a price up to 95% off retail.For me, the nearly $1000 prescription is $77. Not so ouch anymore, eh?So I pay the fee with my CC online, it emails me a card with a member number, activates it on my phone in their app, and I just walk into any pharmacy that accepts it, like CVS, Walmart, Rite Aid, show them the app or card, and they hand me the prescription, no cash changing hands. Pretty simple, great savings.Anyway, Walgreens apparently missed a contract resign date  or some such thing, and can't accept Blink as of the 10th, hopefully a temp thing. The pharmacist said it was a little nuts of them, because the savings people have been seeing are comparable to mine.Now I need to find the Walmart, that does still take it. 3 mile walk, so I start walkin', not a big deal. I get a third of the way, and some gentleman just pulls over and picks me up...a real hiker friendly town, I wasn't even hitching. Drops me off with a smile, and my thanks. In I go, right to the pharmacy, where the Blink Health card is happily accepted,  they do the transfer while I grab the groceries I need, and 20 min later pick up the pills, no cash/copay. That's it, done. Slick. The lady at the counter asks how this works, they've only had one customer use it before...well, being a Blink Health Ambassador, I happily explained it to her just like I did my cardiologist, who also loves the program and is regularly referring other patients. I was invited by Blink Health to be an brand ambassador because I wrote them a letter of gratitude, this is big big savings, on a life preserving medication, that would break the bank if only available retail. Of course I gladly agreed.Saving several hundred dollars today made the walk of 3 miles back to the hotel in the noon hour sun in downtown, more bearable. I even managed to score my Chicago style dog from a cart, on that walk back along the local greenway/riverwalk.So today, thank you to the kind people of Franklin NC. Nice place you got here. Don't change a thing.And of course, thanks to the folks at BlinkHealth.com for keeping another $600 in my bank account.If other hikers or their family members need info on this, as a service to the hiking community,  they are free to speak with me, or ping me through TJ email, and I'll reply when I can. The Ambassador rules prevent my giving a code on a site I don't own,  but I can tell you that I can get you an additional discount on your first fill, by providing the code through email or verbally.We're itchin' to get back out there tomorrow...camping at Wayah Bald. Tarp tenting for the first time on the A.T.

Kinsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559910,"No entry here...pics instead. A little change of pace today. Takes time to do them and playing catch up.
Next entry will resume normal operation and mapping.
Photos can be accessed via the left column link.
Guess I will get an entry in...so I woke up thinking I had an easy day. 1.9 to Rock Gap. Took it slow packing and stood watching sunrise in the valley, mist moving between the hills below, as I waited for Will and Joe. Will showed up, then Joe a few minutes later, both snapping shots of the beautiful sunrise fromm my awesome campsite.
As we're chatting and admiring creation, 'Bama rolled in too. Someone said something about shuttle at Rock Gap, but Will says we're really getting the 11 at Winding Stair Gap, 5.1 miles away. WHAT?! 
Time to jump on a horse. Saddle up. In 30 seconds I'm bidding adieu, 3 hrs to go. 2 climbs. Errr. Practically ran through that 5 miles and did jog some of it coming off the second peak. 2 hrs, in the parking lot at 2 min to 10, and wasn't passed by Willy. :>)
Shortly Will, Joe,then Anchor show up.'Bama took the 9 at Rock Gap. About 11:30 the shuttle for Franklin NC shows, and we're all headed to another flea bag $50 a night flop hiker hotel, and loving it. 
1st stop, before showering, Motor Company Grill, for a specialty burger...the pizza burger. Half beef half Italian sausage, marinara, pepperoni, tons of provolone, onion, lettuce, tomato, and some onion rings. Washed down with an orange Fanta. Next, over to Outdoor 76 outfitter,where they have craft brews in the back room. An IPA and a hard cider later it's time for a shower, laundry, split a cheese/pepperoni  pizza with Anchor, and of course, more beer...I'm short a Chicago dog and wonton soup, but it's only 5:30, and on the plus side for beers. Unusual for me but a pleasant change. Figured I better do the journal now, it might be long night with this crew cuz we're all all at the same place, and lots of pubs in this hiker friendly town.
Waiting on Domino's, we are all out on the hotel walkway, sitting around like we own the place. Good times in progress, lifetime friendships building.
Goodnight from Franklin NC.

Kinsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560375,"Woke at 6 and jumped in the shower, dressed and headed to the store a half mile away for coffee, grabbed 3 16ers, a pile of sugars and creamers, and headed back. The sugars are for my bags, Joe takes it black and Will needs 3. We are condiment crooks of the worst stripe, no shame, wander into a store and see what packets they have...mayo, relish, mustards, hot sauce, you name it, we find a use, other have favorites. We do buy something, outright thievery is below us yet. :>

Returning as the other two are waking, greeted with ""I could kiss you, Kinsman"" as Joe dives in. Will still groggy, it takes a minutes for him to rise. I'm headed out on the 9 shuttle so I'm already wide awake and itching to go, they'll follow on the 11.

It's a bittersweet day, we lose one of our group who'd been section hiking a week or so with us and was a total family member in every respect. A great all around and stand up guy, 'Bama was done and headed home. He' s already missed. It was a pleasure to hike and live, and share evening conversation with him. Said goodbye, bump o da fist, and climbed on the shuttle. Be well, Bro.

Only 4 on the bus, 3 including myself starting out of Winding Stair. Ron Haven the owner, former pro wrestler, and hiker host extraordinaire gave some uptrail resupply advice, and off we went. While the others got into their gear I hit the hill, and just kept on climbing, climbing, climbing. Over Siler Bald, down the other side, half way back up I came to a service Rd, as a Subaru was coming down, so I waited off road a bit for them to pass. It stops, window goes down, a lady asks would I like a Mr Good bar to get me over the next top...well, yes ma'am.  She hands me the bag, unopened, and says you should just take the whole thing, with a smile. I stutter a thank you to her and her husband,  and off she drove. Magical.

Up I go, munching a Mr Goodbar, the top of Wayah seems to come fairly soon. I hold a couple spots of grass for the guys tents, and after Will arrives I set up my tarp as a tent, tossed in sleeping pad, bag, and hammock underquilt, to use as an overquilt, dug my feed bag and stove out and slid the rest of the pack in to be my roomee for the night. Helps hold me in place on the slight slope. 

Incredible sunset from up on what remains of the Wayah Observation Tower after last year's fires.  Too bad some knucklehead had to go setting those fires, its pretty awful through here. Self immolation would have been alot easier and less destructive. Anyway, see the pics page, for a really gorgeous sunset pic or two. 

Dinner tonight was an Alpine Aire Pasta Roma...vegetarian, pasta, romano and parmesean cheese in a thick tomato sauce. Pretty good. Coffee followed, and not long after I crawled in under the tarp, on a fairly windy night, into the bag and pulled the quilt over. Slept like log, nice and toasty. The down puffy makes a great pillow. Didn't even wake when several people came up around 12:30. The guys tell me they did wake, and as soon as the folks noticed the tents they quieted right down and just enjoyed the view. Mighty nice of them.

Kinsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560380,"Awoke to voices, and found a small church group gathered for sunrise on Easter morning, Will and Joe already up. Out I crawled and joined them a few minutes, and then put water on for coffee. A few min later, mug of java in hand, started breaking camp as the other group went in the tower to have a Service and sing hymns. Nice start to the day. Will and Joe stashed a bunch of candy filled plastic eggs around the tower and I headed out, thinking of home, past Easters, and the traditional ham dinner with asparagus and scalloped potatoes that I'd not be having for the first time in as long as I can remember. In .9 I came to Wayah shelter where folks were just packing up. Wishing a happy Easter to all as I went by, I picked up another NH hiker in my draft, funny I didn't catch her name, but she's from Litchfield, on her third Thru attempt. She liked the pace managed to stay fairly close, catching up at rest stops or water holes, as I churn up the hills a bit quicker than she. Nice to talk to someone from home and the miles sort of just went by today. Half way point of our 10, I was coming into a gap and could see some cars, my drafter mentioned it was looking like a Magic show, and I agreed. Popping out of the woods into an old homestead or cattle runners clearing where a couple ancient, twisted, apple trees still had a few blossoms showing, we were greeted by a group with a table of colored hard boiled eggs, apples, clementines, and more. Then some one said ""we also have ham sandwiches"". Yup, jaw fell open just about then....did I hear that right?   I mentioned my Easter dinner dilemma, and was served up a slice of juicy ham, with Colby jack, mustard and mayo. A fine and welcome substitute and at the perfect spot and time.  This stuff just continues to happen, one way or another, nearly every day.The Trail provides. I needed a piece of rope, very size specific, for my tarp after one was frayed in that storm a couple weeks back, and soon thereafter, there was one on the ground at a camp site. I had a water hose clip come apart due to age. One was laying on the table of the next shelter, no one around, and it's brand new. I could continue, but you wouldn't believe me.So, I thought on this Easter I would share how I start my trail day. You see, I gave up control of this thing on about day 3. It ain't me, any more. And it's blatantly obvious.I get going, out there alone, and my little ritual goes like so:Thank you for this day.
Thank you for this trail.Thank you for a Wife, Son, and Mother that love me.Mostly, thank you for Your Son.Please give my heart the stamina it needs today, keep my knee together another day, and give me the strength to move myself over these mountains and miles another day.
And it happens, stronger, more durable, resilient, powering up hills, infrequent stopping but rather just mind over matter one foot in front of the other, I'm not fatigued, a little sore a day end and ready to go the next pain-free, and no vitamin I, can't take the stuff.It is what it is. Raised in the church I'm not particularly religious in the sense of going to weekly services, but I revel in Creation and loving being out in it, that's my church, and I try to show some of that in respect for the environment and the trails.End of sermon...Happy Easter to all. The obligatory dinner tag...Mtn House pepper steak and rice. Yummmmmy. Nice big chunks of beef and lots of em. All the way to the bottom, every bite. Yellow, red, green bell peppers, and long grain white rice in just the right amount of spice and sauce. Not exactly asparagus and scalloped potatoes, but definitely on the future menu list.Warm, dry, fed. Goodnight from the AT.

On my way at 8, Will soon coming up behind, we took it easy in this section and he led the way down.Arriving at the bottom, we were timely as it started to rain. Crossed the street to NOC and found a place to drop the load. Sat around a half hour, looking the place over and waiting for Will's food drop to be checked in.Made our way down to the hobo camp, and found a great grassy site for the two tents and an equally good site for a hammock on the cliff 20 feet up the bank. Several hours to kill and rest before dinner, we went to the small convenience store and the old Deadhead in me couldn't resist the only remaining Terrapin IPA Survival 12 pack.  4 different brews, 3 of each...how convenient for our little group. Been seeing these all over the place down here and finally succumbed to my temptations.Yes, they were very goodOnce settled in and lightly lubricated, we all headed down to the Riverbend restaurant. I decided for one hell of a burger...Wesser half pound patty, cheese, sautéed onions and peppers, bacon, lettuce, tomato, plus a side salad and tater tots with onion sauce. Washed down with a local cider. A second burger was tempting but prudence won out. After dinner, several hikers gathered on a gazebo to hang out, I spoke with a guy from NH down here doing trail magic. Haven't run into him out there yet, but I've heard of others that have.Rained hard while at dinner, but we managed to find some dry tinder and had a nice fire down on the riverside. All the gear stayed dry, and tonight I'm warm, dry, and fed. Goodnight from the A.T.

Count a trip to a shelter and we'll definitely hit the 4k mark. Rain expected, it's looking to be a long day.Alarm set for 5, I wake and hear no rain on the tarp. Roll out, dress and pack up, on the trail by 7 in full rain gear. 10 minutes in, the skies open and it's like that til about noon. The climb does not meet its reputation, it's just another 500' per mi grade, with a couple peak ascents a bit steeper, and a few false summits. Standard fare...Around 11, slid into Sassafras Gap shelter, whipped up some yellow fin tuna salad, slapped it on a pair of wraps and ate while changing into a dry shirt, 2nd layer, and down puffy.About 20 min later Will showed up, and I made ready to depart. He decided to leave as well, and he led us out and then sped off to claim a site at Locust Cove campsite. I picked my way for the afternoon, being in no hurry and only 2.5 miles from camp. Up and over Cheoah Bald, then all downhill from there. In dry clothes and back in the rain gear, it's a game of moisture management to not sweat/keep dry clothes dryArrived mid afternoon, famished, but set up  the tarp and hammock first, and then whipped up a homemade dehydrated meal, snagged out of a hiker box when I dumped in some ramens, cheese,  and peanut butter cups. Cheesy Mac and beef, with broccoli, peppers, corn, and cabbage pieces in it. Delicious.

Kinsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560836,"Awoke at 5 to a soft pitter patter on the tarp and heavy mist in the air. Everything has a bit of dampness. The drops on the tarp are from the trees though, there's a break in the rain, so roll out and pack up. No one else is awake, as we have the company of several other hikers, when I go down to collect the bearbags and line. Leaving Will's at his tent door, I finish up and hit the trail at about 8. Incredible but fleeting views as the mist fills in the valleys, mountain tops seem to be floating in an ocean of white only a few hundred yards away. Climbing out of Simp Gap, right up the backbone of the ridge, one side a wall of mist, the other crystal clear for miles, the dividing point between the two sharp as though a wall was between them.Getting 3 miles done in about an hour and twenty minutes, I arrived at Stecoah Gap to find apples and bananas on a pair of picnic tables. I had a yellow delicious. Also a huge blood orange that a hiker left after disembarking a shuttle...didn't want to carry the weight. Soon, just as Will was coming down the hill, a gentleman pulled in the parking lot, asked if I wanted a ride to Robbinsville, 5 mi away. I'd love one...so we piled in, and were dropped of at the AYCE pizza and salad parlor, where we had a good feed, and then walked a mile to the laundromat, (and were asked if we needed a ride by a nice lady along the way, which we politely declined) tossed all our down items in an industrial dryer, along with a couple sandals to fluff them, for 20 minutes, and a smaller one for everything else. When done, packed, and ready to get going back for our remaining 5 miles, we walked 200 yards across an Ingles parking lot, stuck out our thumbs, and had a ride right to the trailhead in 10 minutes. Awesome folks in Robbinsville!We resumed climbing knowing we'd have super dry and fluffed beds tonight. Climb out of the gap definitely tougher than out of NOC, some really nice trail, rock scrambles and huge slabs, thin treadway along mountainside. Loved every minute.Wildflowers galore today. Several types of trillium, covering entire hillsides. Pictures will be posted tomorrow night when we will have a room at Fontana Lodge where Joe and I both have resupply drops to pick up and sort through/repackage.Dinner was a basic Mtn House lasagna.

Kinsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561180,"Owls overhead made a great alarm clock, a bit before first light. A slight drizzle is sounding on the tarp. It's an 8 mile day, so I lingered in the hammock.

Another group above us is just starting to pack up...rather noisily, shaking out their wet tents...and is just about to move toward Fontana dam. That's our goal as well. 3 mi up, 5 mi down.

As usual I leave a bit ahead of the others, it will be a heavy task to stay in front as they'll leave in a half hour. Good group...Will, Joe, Sarah, and Jay. The last two are a young couple and very nice. He reminds me of me 25 years ago, very much the outdoorsy/hunter type. Best hen turkey call by mouth only, no diaphragm needed, I've ever heard. I'd love to hunt with him sometime.

At a rest stop they all caught up, and after a quick snack I precede them again. A couple hrs and were all in the Fontana dam parking lot and waiting a shuttle. Everyone grabs a soda from the machine while we wait.

Arriving at the lodge, pay my 3 bucks to the driver and checkin. A step up from Budget Inn, this place is sharp. Nice grounds and buildings. Showers, and a trip to the general store for some fuel, a couple snacks, and then pick up the resupply box which holds 6 days of food. Only need 4, so a couple PB cups go in the hiker box. Old wraps swapped for fresh. Will eat one hiker meal for dinner.

Went to the lodge grill for lunch, had a toasted roast beef sub with the house adjus, onion rings and just had to try the blue cheese coleslaw. I'm not a blue cheese fan, but that slaw was pretty awesome.

Snacks for dinner and repack ingredients supplies. Late start for 11 mi tomorrow as shuttle runs at 8:30.

Kinsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561656,"Up at 4:45, after another pretty sleepless night with someone snoring in my ear. I gotta say, I hate the policies in the Smokies re shelters. Couple guys from MA up and headed for an early march down muddy trail by headlamp in the fog,  out of camp at 5. Joe, Will, and I are all up, packed, ready to go but struggle to get moving. The last 36 hrs of rain have taken a toll on morale, everything is damp and it's a bit chilly at a little over 5000 feet. The original plan for 17 to Newfound Gap, hitch to Gatlinburg comes up as we mill about eating breakfast. We climb to over 6500 feet today, up Clingmans Dome, the highest point on the A.T., plus 17 miles. After the last couple days thats just too much for me and I mentioned it to Joe, saying I'd come off at the parking lot at the Dome after about 12 miles, and they could do the remaining 6, but he was feeling 11 would be better as well, and Will agreed.Managed to knock the 11 off fairly well, on muddy, slick, rolling trail but no terrible climbs. Done around 2, after 2 shelter stops for refueling along the way.Down in the parking lot we need to find a hitch to town...22 miles.  Joe, now known as Bon Appetite, spots a lone gentleman my age with a dog and sets about chatting with him, 5 minutes later 4 of us...we have a female hiker named Parakeet joining us...are piling into his van with a ride right to the hotel previously reserved. Nice guy, we had to force cash on him for his trouble and kindness.Staying at Days Inn, the general store right out front is an easy resupply and has a grill. You can guess where we gravitated...a nice Reuben sandwich with tots for me. A rack of Angry Orchard green apple came back to the room, to be enjoyed with some pizza later.Local trolley service makes getting around town easy, so laundry and other chores are fairly simple, there's a Nantahala Outdoor outfitter right across the street.

Little groups wander in to Days Inn with a shell shocked look, but fist bumps and raised beers on the way to their rooms from others already arrived and hanging around the concourse brings smiles, packs dropped and tales told. Instant pick me up.We sleep in... to all of 7, arise and we start planning the day. The 4 of us want to do laundry, resupply, repack the goods, explode packs, etc. Trolley around town, we all head to laundry, common loads, and while it's going we hit Dollar General, knock of the bulk of our food lists for 20-30 bucks each, stuff the clothes in dryers, and visit the beer and liquor stores nextdoor. Unpacked all the food while waiting, left the boxes in the laundromat trash.

You betcha we all poured into the bed, packs, poles, and all.
A chilly but pleasant ride. We have a bluebird day, and the views are great as we travel up, dropping the other hiker at Newfound Gap, and on to Clingmans. 
Climbing out of our benefactor's truck, he joins us, as we are treated to some spectacular sights from the parking lot overlook. Long distance views with some of the smoky mists down in the low lands that give these mtns their name. 
I came down the summit bypass on Monday, when the weather was foul,  and will return up the same route to resume where I turned off, as to not miss any white blazes. From there its a short .3 to the summit, where I'll rejoin our group and go up on the observation tower.
Soon after I head out to Indian Road Gap, 5ish miles away. Roughly our mid point for the day, which will end at Icewater Spring shelter. Champagne catches me near the end and we have some lunch and lay in the grass a while at the gap. Its a gorgeous day.  After an hour or so Bon Appetite and Parakeet join us. Again Im off, now the remainder of our 9, 1200 feet over 3 miles, to the shelter, which promises to be packed...YEA!!!!!  A nice, but clear and chilly night. I'll  take not in a shelter for that and consider it a great deal.
The Trail Boss is full, but I'll eat a couple heavy items right off so she's reasonable again. Small can of chicken salad for lunch, and for dinner a Velveeta mac and cheese, which is extra heavy as it has cheese sauce already made, vs a powder like Kraft that wants milk and butter, and is frankly gross with olive oil substituted for them.
Oh, and a big thanks to a pair of first time Trail Angels down at Newfound Gap who had hot dogs, glazed donuts, sweet tea and cold cokes. Hit the spot just right for the climb out of the Gap. Well done!

Kinsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562774,"Gonna be a wet one, but refuse to sit still 12.1 miles slated so I was up at 5, out at 6:15, and had about an hour of decent views, while lightning played in the distance.
Made it out onto Charlie's Bunion for a look at the Tennessee side of the mountain, the rough, craggy side that gets the brunt of the weather, and its quite the contrast from the smoother and forested side. Pics show it better than i can describe.
Lightning and thunder coming nearer, a wall of rain visibly approaching as Im on the ridge, I quickly ducked under the next rhodedendron bush, dropped pack and dug for rain pants and OR shell. Unclipping and deploying pack cover first, the drops started just as I finished zipping the legs of the OR pants.
Dry and warm, the storm was pretty intense, and more than once I muttered to myself about being in the wrong damn place at the wrong damn time. There's a whopping 15 feet of scrawny tree cover above me and several miles to go. Champagne caught up, of course, and soon after some lightning and immediate thunder crashed right above us causing us both to duck and exclaim in surprise, and quicken our pace a bit.
Several hours of this ensued, and we stopped in the lee of the knife edge on some dry moss embankment to escape the weather for a brief bite to eat. Back on our feet, nobody's passed us yet, and the shelter race is on for a dry night. We made the shelter by 2, first ones in, and claimed our spots. Drying out from the sweat of rain gear is first business, eating second. Other hikers start trickling in after an hour and before we know it the place is full and tents going up.
Dinner was Beef Bolognese,  Backpackers Pantry. Tasty, but not quite as good as the real thing. Still hit the spot. Cup of coffee and got my gear ready for tomorrow's early departure for a 14.8 mile trek down 5000 feet in elevation, to get to the last damn shelter in the park...Davenport Gap. This shelter still has the chain link bear fence across the front of the stone hut, so that at least will be interesting.

Managed to stay in front of the herd today, see some great views, take photos to be posted later, and after that little run through the jungle, only one other hiker and Champagne, were inside Davenport Gap shelter when I arrived.  I walked in and claimed a space by laying my sleeping pad down. After an hour they all started trickling in, and soon the place was full. Poor tentsites helped assure that. And we had a familiar snorer, who managed to keep most of the place up.

3 climbs today, and several miles of down, like 5000 feet worth. Easy travelling, Champagne and I reached town at noon...13.2 in 5.5 hrs. Not bad, not bad at all, for and old n slow guy.
Hot Springs not what we expected, having just come out of Gatlinburg. A very small town, no fast food, major chain stores, etc. However it has an outfitter, where there's a resupply box  awaiting me. Supplement that with $23 of perishables and I'm good to go. 
Laundry is across the street from outfitter, our cabin 1/4 mile away, so we checkin, strip, and head back to do all the chores today. Had em done by 3:30. Rest of the day to chill and await Bon Appetite, possibly Parakeet.
The town is full of hikers, everywhere you look, not that there are many place to look in this 2 stop light town, but what there is, is lousy with a dirty, wet, and extremely cheerful yet bedraggled bunch. Morale is high, open containers abound...reminds me of the carnival of humanity that was a Dead tour, back in the day. Nuthin' left to do but smile, smile, smile.
Sense of community building among those remaining, as the herd is thinning a bit now with people dropping off. Estimates say 35% are gone by now. After this it will be injury or low finances that take people out. 
The yellow blazers are now showing themselves...when hikers you know were behind by at least 2 days suddenly are in town before you, and they didnt pass you on trail, its obvious how they got there...so for those not in the know, yellow blazing is hitching/shuttling/otherwise using roads and skipping blazes/trail miles. 
Not something we do, feel is right, but its hike your own hike and if partying with a bunch of people is what youre out here for, I'm not here to judge. At the same time though, those are not the type we plan to hang or even associate with much.  Ive built a career largely on strong adherence to ethics, so it naturally rubs the wrong way with me.

Cold overnight, it snowed at elevations over 5k. No precipitation my entire 10 miles, but a gorgeous cloud shrouded snow covered Mt side with a steep side slope climb. Trick today, as it's below 32, is to go slow and not sweat a drop.
It didn't snow on me and I reached the shelter by 11. Camped out right away, first one in. Champagne soon followed. Others got caught up in the TM, and got snowed on, rained on, hailed on...or they hitched out at Sam's Gap for Erwin.
One hiker helped off the Mtn, hypothermic and mumbling, to a local residence to recover.

Yep, we're still alive and walkin'. Been out of any decent service a long time, so making up for it much of my zero in Erwin. Go back several days to catch up as I've back filled the entries.
OK, now for this entry...after a bitchin'  cold night in the upper 20s and lower 30s at over 5000 feet, though I was perfectly comfy and thankfully dry in my 25 degree down bag, under a 0 degree down underquilt on the shelter floor, Champagne and I arose late...7ish...as planned, for we have only a 10 mi day planned, to be followed by an easy 6 the next, to get to Erwin.
The day dawns clear, sunny, and it's going to be gorgeous. Scrubbed clean by the snow, the air is crystal clear and visibility unlimited. Melting fast, trail is going to be muddy today. We pack slow, letting the air warm before setting out. Most of our shelter mates have left by 8, though Daddy Longlegs and his awesome little dog Cole, headed out before us at 830.
Leaving around 9, the day is warming quickly, and I shed layers half way up the first climb. Spent most of the morning leapfrogging DL and Cole, and eventually many of us ended up at the shelter by 2. I suggested pushing to near Erwin, finding a stealth camp along the trail/railroad tracks, and enjoying some of Erwin's amenities.
Sounds good others said, not part of the plan but tempting...this will be a 17 mile day Champagne warns me...Yeah, I know I acknowledged, biggest day for any of us yet....and off I went. We made Erwin by 4:30, found a great stealth site with a fire ring and ready pile of wood awaiting us, and we spiked camp in 20 min.
Champagne, DL, and I are hankerin' fer a breakfast dinner with all the fixing. Eggs, bacon, sausage, waffles, home fries, biscuits and gravy...huddle house here we come. DL is a non meat eater, so doubles up on the eggs, veggies, and gets Cole bacon and eggs too
We found a great shuttle guy, Doug, and ended up utilizing him several times, at a whopping 7 bucks per trip...total, not per person.  Nice guy, came back out to get us after dinner, 9 pm, gave us his direct number, pleasure to talk to and a very intelligent man, snake expert, so we plied him with questions. 
A nice night back at the camp, Champagne got a fire going and we all enjoyed a beer while watching the flames and enjoying the warmth. Chatting about what an epic 2 days it's been...snow, ice, howling wind one day,  sunny day the next, with big miles and feeling great after them to top it off.
We'll sleep in and shop tomorrow, Champagne reserved a room, but Super 8 doesn't allow dogs, so DL and Cole will hole up at Uncle Johnny's hostel, where I picked up my resupply box from The Quartermaster. Hope we see them again, DL is an interesting young man,  quite a bit deeper than most of the folks I've met so far, and it's been nice to have a dog around a bit too, as Cole is quite the little character, though it's bittersweet as it makes me miss my own much more acutely.

Kinsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564436,"Greetings...from New Hampshire.
After 6 weeks of some pretty cool scenery, wondrous sunrises and sets, 343.9 miles, weathering some storms that made for indelible memories, and making several new friends, I decided to stop in Erwin and come home. Woke up Tues at 5, showered, dressed in trail clothes, and made ready to hike out. When he woke a bit later I told Champagne I was going home, then hemmed and hawwed around the hotel til 11, shuttled to the trailhead, took one look at it and turned around. Rented a car at 3:30 pm Tues in Johnson City, and was home in 13 hrs. Rolled in at 6:30 am on Wed morning to a surprised and very happy wife.
My gear all performed spectacularly, nothing broke, never had a blister, banged toenail, sliver, or wet feet even once. The hiking was great, not especially difficult, nor was the repetetiveness of day in/day out hiking in all forms of weather mentally taxing. I have zero doubt I can walk the distance if I still choose to do so, but I don't. The truth is, to me it has become unimportant to be an AT thru hiker.
Why?  Several factors...The so called ""social"" and ""cultural"" aspects, for the most part, are not my style and try as I might to avoid and distance myself from it, the number of hikers makes it virtually impossible. I've met some wonderful people in the public sphere during my travels, and a select few hikers hold a special place and will always be for life welcome guests in my home, and whom I will gladly assist in hiking across NH in any capacity I can....BA, Murph if he makes it back on trail, Parakeet, Sarah and Jay, Daddy Longlegs and his wonder dog Cole. Chances are high that none of them but BA even know I'm off trail yet. Such is the ebb and flow of days on trail, seeing some, or maybe none, of your trail family you are usually hanging with, and ours had become terribly fractured by illnesses and injuries. I never shared my cell number with anyone or asked others for theirs, our only form of contact was in person. At the same time, I've met an awful lot more on trail I'd rather forget, and i'll leave it at that.
A couple unforseen issues back home, primarily an estate/probate hearing on Tues the 16th I learned about while in Hot Springs 2 weeks ago, was weighing on my mind and it is difficult to attend that by phones  from somewhere between Roan Mtn and Damascus, which is where the schedule had me.
The rolling party...after a while hearing people yap about how drunk they're gonna get, or got, at each town, over and over to anyone that will listen, grows tedious. Also, the entitled and ""self only"" attitudes, irregardless of how one's actions may  affect others, are over the top, particularly among Millennials, including the cliques and herd mentality...after witnessing several hikers turned away from a ""full"" shelter only to have one known to several residents and part of their group, show up much later and room expected to made for that person, again without care for how it impacted others, including those already in the shelter but not part of that group, I'd seen enough. Lastly, general and repetitive town behavior that reflects poorly on the hiker community as a whole. Mildly amusing or better would be to say tolerable at first, it got old .
I can hike right here in the Whites and see none of that, over an entire season. I'll continue maintaining trails, enjoying hikes with my family and friends, as well as solo trips. What I won't be doing anymore is Trail Magic, because that has been spoiled for me by what I have seen. Certainly there are some terrific people on the trail, that truly appreciate the help, but unless you live with them for a spell, you can never know if they even remotely deserve the kindnesses being done for them and there is no way to separate the wheat from the chaf as Magic is happening. 
I believe I chose this moment to leave because I wanted my last trail experience to be an extremely positive one...Champagne, DL, Cole, and myself...3 of us and a dog, the fellowship of a meal shared together, then later around a campfire for a night in conversation and contemplation, after a big mile, beautiful sun filled and cloudless day, and a friendly, smile filled parting in the morning, though expected to be temporary, a few hours only really, instead came to be likely for good. I left with one of the best possible moments of joy as a lasting, final memory and vision.
With that I'm off, not going back, no intent to flip flop from Katahdin. Called Mtn Harbour hostel and put my resupply box that I should have gotten to yesterday if I were hiking, into BA's name so it didn't go to waste... Bon Appetite, BA. Good stuff in that box. You'll be missed, and looked for when you hit NH, maybe sooner...VT is close, my friend, very close. Will be watching your journal, I know it's a pain in the ass, but pls update now and then.
I will be keeping myself busy, it will be a bit of work to keep my mind off trail, and to keep the sense of self letdown I've felt the last couple days at bay til it passes, but I will manage...Plenty of work to do around the house we bought just last August, while I spend time looking for a new job. My days will be well filled, and based on the news today of a multi-national cyber attack, my skills are probably still in high demand.
Regrets...not having more moments with the aforementioned group, plus `Bama and Anchor. Missing the Grayson Highlands/ponies, McAfee Knob, and Harper's Ferry, though I can go see those landmarks anytime.
Best times....the entire time, spent with my son. Cherished every moment and always will. Meeting Joe and Murph and a day at Blood Mtn Cabins. Zero in Franklin with Bama, Anchor, Joe, Champagne. Dinner with Parakeet, Joe, Champagne in Gatlinburg. Camping/dinner with Champagne, Daddy Longlegs and Cole. Every moment spent around a campfire with these folks.
Stupid stats...left at 176 lbs 27.5 bmi, which is a bit overweight, but in my opinion probably too light at the time. Returned 156 lbs, 24.5 bmi, nearly the picture of perfect health, lean, with legs of steel and a tan. 3 inches off waist, 4 new holes in belt, new pants needed. No question it was good for me.

Kinsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568852,"Hi TJ readers,
Been home a month and thought I'd make a last update before a new chapter of life starts.
After moping around a couple weeks on our return, torn about my decision, and conversing with some of you over my feelings, which was tremendously eye opening, humbling, sobering, and uplifting, I got my ass in gear and started looking for a job.
As expected months ago before leaving, the market is pretty hot in cyber security. Lots of calls, ended up taking a position at a Boston law firm. That entails an apartment, and a train ride of 2 hrs each way, but it's worth it. More responsibility, great move professionally, location right on the harbor...Tall Ships floating by the office window all this coming week in fact. I start the 19th. Excited, nervous, hoping all goes well. Talk about a dose of culture shock, country boy to the big city, and especially after the solitude and peace of the AT.
Miss the trail and it's routines, friends, relatively simplistic day in and out. Have been out doing maint work. Kinsman shelter looking good, the caretaker tells me the Thru Hiker Pass is being met with approval by the folks trickling in. Walked a bit of the local AT section in my realm and they are in good shape.
Happened to be at the crossing near the Hiker Hostel near Warren, found a Canadian passport, so dropped it at the hostel, if anyone looking for one. It was dry, hadn't been run over, so must not have been there long. One disappointing thing I noticed though...a brand new trail sign, 3 trails on it, has been defaced and destroyed. Someone scratched out every letter until only those that said AT remained visible.  This is exactly the sort of thing that sort of drove me off trail...it's that poor behavior. Obviously this was done by an AT hiker, and I'd wager a Thru. Who else would do it, who'd want to, who is that arrogant, uncaring, and obnoxious to destroy a sign costing in excess of a hundred bucks. I just shook my head. 
Speaking of the Hiker Hostel, on a happier note...I was some kind of surprised to see a familiar looking face come around the corner. Met the guy that does the Thru Hiker Yearbook a couple months back on Wayah Bald at the tower. He is here now...running the hostel for the Conn based owner. We had a nice chat, and of course he noted with a huge grin that I was looking a little cleaner since we'd last seen one another.  Yeah, I miss the grime. Really, I do. I wasn't that dirty anyway.
Still saying my little prayer every day, it's just a different chunk of life's trail now, and I'm thankful for it.
There's a lot to be thankful for, and high on that list I will be ever thankful and grateful for having been able to experience the AT and all it holds, and having done it with Champagne. These memories will never fade.
Shout out to BA and Parakeet who I hear are still heading northward. Had we stayed out there we'd be coming to the top of VA about now.
And one more to Airlock and Sasquach...yes I'd love to walk some miles with you someday when and if I ever see VA again. Thank you.",,Just chillin',"Jun 16, Fri",0
Kinsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581892,"Well hi there. Didnt expect anyone to be looking at this hiker much these days... Not a day goes by I don't think of the trail, of Erwin, BA, DL and Cole, Bear, Murph, Anchor and Bama, and many more. Maybe Google some other hikers, a shelter, mtn, or a gap name. I think of the good parts, see the pics, and smile. And I am still a bit disappointed at not having finished.To that end I started planning how to continue northward while really loving and managing my career as principle security analyst for a global firm....3 weeks vaca per year, I will use 2 weeks a yr to hike for some number of years. I will have the pleasure of my wife's company and maybe sometime  Champagne's in the future.Looking to head out from NH on 3/31, QuarterMaster in the nav chair, for Erwin. Jump back on at the railroad tracks by Chestoah Bridge bound for Damascus, right where I bailed last year. Finish NC and TN, start VA, pack it up and return next year. Really getting excited to be back on the long brown path. Quartermaster will hang at some B&Bs along the 130 mile distance for the two weeks.Taking all the same gear, no need to change a thing, though I plan to take a shitload more pictures going over all those balds and meadows! I took a lot last year, but no where near enough really.Will update the map from where I left off if I can remember how.",,View Entry,"Jan 05, Fri",0
Kinsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583864,"The Universe is up to its usual humor, making lots of little streams come together into a swell...After nearly a year of searching, I managed to find and converse with BA and Paruhkeet...incredibly both on the same day.
Neither finished, both went further, both have suffered similar trials in societal re-integration, self recrimination, etc but we have all managed to even up the keel and I think all come out the better, and wiser for it.
Paruhkeet has a sweet gig as a trail ambassador type and caretaker along the AT with Granite Gear and is featured on their website along with the rest of the national team of do gooders at the moment. If you happen to go look, she is Ms Alexis Rodriquez. 
 BA is the Guru of Grapes at a place in Louisville KY...back on his native turf and rocking it as a well known Sommelier, which has been his trade for decades, he is sorta famous. Having dined and drank with BA at several establishments both renowned and sorta seedy, I can attest the Man can pick a great brew, wine, or spirit for any occasion or meal.
Me, I lasted 3 weeks in Boston last July,  boss drove me absolutely nuts as a micromanager with a wicked case of Napoleon complex and one day I just walked and didn't return. Spent the summer landscaping, and since Oct have been the principle security analyst for a global education leader. Love it, great people, benefits, salary. It's all good now.
So I am thrilled BA is likely to join me for a week around Carver Gap, he heard my plan and invited himself and I will be very excited to see him and have him along. Later in the year he and Paruhkeet are coming for a visit to NH and join me for a weekend of trail maint up in the Kinsmans.
40 days to go, looking forward to getting back on the long brown ribbon, getting back to nature and simplicity again. I will look forward to this every year...a little rejuvenation walking with Spring, seeing new sights and faces, surely rejoining old friends here and there as well as making even more friendships.
Kinda makes me glad I didn't bust it all out in a single season. Corrected the miles to reflect last season stopping point...RR tracks/hobo camp at Erwin, mile 343.9","NH

Kinsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588741,"Left NH on 4/20 in snow, for TN, around 2:30 pm. Arrived at Mt Harbour hostel about 10:30 am next day. Warm and sunny. Checked in, set up my pickup truck bed tent and air mattress, and slept a few hours til dinner time.
Chatted with a few hikers that evening to check trail conditions, how's the water flow in general, any ice left on Roan, where is ""the bubble"" roughly, things along those lines. Had a nice conversation with MacDaddy who was headed home for a family function but due back a few days later...I never did see him again and haven't seen a new journal post, but he was in good spirits. Also spoke at length with a couple retired sheriff deputies from MN...this pair had some real horror stories to share, and it seems there could be some pretty illicit substances in use out there this year. Way beyond the weed...  and I will leave it at that.
Awoke on Sunday, started packing things up prior to shuttle, turned the key on in my truck...got a warning for low pressure right front tire. Ugh....brand new tires, I already have an idea of what I'm going to find. A couple min of inspection and I found a nearly new, not yet road worn, sheetrock or deck screw protruding from the tire. A string of expletives later I find Dave the owner, explain my predicament, noting it's Sunday and the tire will be flat in 24 hrs...these folks at Mt Harbour are so kind, he offered to take the truck on Monday himself, for repair. I handed him the keys and never gave it a thought again. (On my return they charged me a whole 20 bucks, so I tipped them another 20, and still consider I got a great deal. Thanks Mtn Harbour, you all rock! )
Plan was to shuttle down to Erwin on Sun the 22nd, solo a few days and meet BA at Roan High Knob. Sunday morning dawned cool (37*) and clear, Sharon shuttled me down, dropped me off with a ""if you need anything, call us"" and into the woods I went with a wave.
 Arriving at our last campsite by the tracks I dropped pack, shedding lots of emotions and demons along with it. Placing a hand on the first white blaze I said a little prayer. Slipping back into the pack, off up the trail I went, thinking on my planned first 8 miles, noting water sources flowing decently, and generally transitioning into the trail mindset. It didn't take long to get into gear, nor to realize that while I was in better shape than when starting last year, it was not as good as when I left. In the middle...so there was some resting, some hard breathing, but onward I pressed to Curley Maple Gap shelter, where I met Journalist, Over Easy and Scrambled, Mirage and her dad, Lux, and Venus. This formed the basis of this year's Tramily, and I would spend the next 3 days and nights hiking amongst and sheltering with this great bunch of hikers.
The plan had been for 8 mi on day 1, but that changed on the high wind and rain warning for the first evening. I laid out my pad and bag in the shelter after much consideration of going further, then enjoyed a chicken teryaki Mtn House,  and laid awake for quite a while after hiker midnight, reveling in the return to trail. Waking at the usual 5:30 I quietly packed up and slipped out without disturbing anyone, hitting a damp trail by headlamp. I need to do 12 mi to get back on sched to Cherry Gap, so 4 miles to make up from day 1. This evening should have been spent at Indian Grave Gap, but I am happy to have stopped where I did, avoiding the perils of high wind and rooflessness, and met some good folks at the same time. Their company over the next few days would be warm and welcoming, and I am thankful to have had it.","Erwin TN

Kinsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588747,"Today starts with a 2000 ft gain on the climb of Unaka Mtn. It's cold but at the moment not raining. High wind has brought some wood down overnight along the trail, lots of debris to step around, over, or through. As dawn comes I switch off the headlamp, climb into full rain gear and get the pack cover on just as the rain begins. I have the trail to myself for several hours as I climb Unaka, but eventually my shelter mates all overtake me. (As expected)
Everyone is headed for Cherry Gap shelter...capacity 6. Each stops to chat, offer encouragement, see you tonight. I expect I will hammock tonight, not being a big shelter fan, but at the same time, rain, or actually, packing wet gear after rain, is a powerful motivator for shelter dwelling, and miraculously as I roll in at about 3, hours after the others, there is a slot remaining in the shelter, thought several tents are present as well. Smiles and "" we knew you'd make it, we had faith in you"" are offered, a berth mysteriously opens and I gladly accept. It's good to be back on trail with awesome people. 
Dinner is Knorrs rice and a Tyson chicken pack....not much has changed in diet, we had that licked pretty good last year and no need to adjust. In fact, the only change I made is a dif set of hiking poles for this year, to an older pair of Leki Cristallos, vs the MicroVario, as they are more adjustable.
Once again I slip out silently in the dark early morning, knowing I will see my new shelter mates soon....","Curley Maple Gap shelter

Kinsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588748,"Another day of wind, rain, socked in mountain tops with no views, but there is still plenty of beauty to be found walking in the mists, there is plenty of flora along the way...the trillium, Turks hat lillies, purple violets and some form of iris, the savis trees are all blooming, the rich green grasses and mosses, are all welcome to see. 
There are no big climbs, just rambling ridge walking, a few PUDS, easy trail. Muscle memory has returned, long strides, rock hopping, speeding down the trail, the 9 are done in short order, I am back on schedule, and there is time for hanging out, snacking and snoozing, in the company of new friends. An afternoon of joking, sassy wit, and laughter is had between bouts of caloric intake. Tonight will be the last I see of most of them (except when each passes me tomorrow) as they will blow on by Roan High Knob shelter for the Barn (Overmountain shelter) and be on their way north at twice my speed and daily miles. It was really great to hang with these gals and guys for 3 days. Thanks for the welcome, setting a great tone, and best wishes to all of them. I hope to see several in the late summer, if I can catch them at a crossing...  
Tomorrow I am to meet BA somewhere between Hughes Gap and Roan High Knob. I am very much looking forward to seeing my friend, since we never met back up after Hot Springs last year...that has bothered me a full year. It will be good to put those ill thoughts down finally.
Dinner after a wet day is pork sausage gravy and biscuits Mtn House, and a whole lot of pepper to beat back the mild body chills. Everyone falls asleep soon after supper and darkness comes early in the wet weather.","

Kinsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588755,"Once again gone in silence, Over the course of the day almost everyone that passes me asks how I manage to leave so quietly, and thanks me for my courtesy. (Good thing I'm not an axe murderer, eh?) The trick, I tell them, is to stuff bags away from the shelter, and not use an air mattress, opting for a silent foam thermarest instead. Air mattresses are about the noisiest thing there is to try and pack silently, and impossible to do so. 
Today is again cold and wet. I run into some slack packers going sobo, and I start hearing the unfortunate news of a hiker's death. Seems a gentleman, a veteran, was on resupply trip from Greasy Creek Friendly, when he started feeling lightheaded, began vomiting, and went into cardiac arrest. He later died. News like this travels fast on trail. So very sorry for the family, and for those that had to try to locate them and give the news. RIP Savage, he met an end doing what he loved.
Gave me much to think on that morning, as a heart attack survivor, and pause to reflect that maybe I should have paid a bit more attention to the dizziness that made me sit down mid trail, 2 miles in, on day 1, climbing out of Erwin.
Over the course of the day all my shelter mates trickled by. I made sure to get photos, say goodbye, and thank each and every one of them for their kindness and friendship. God bless all, and may they have safe travels.
The climb of Roan was long, but not hard. BA texted he was on the way, and he arrived at the shelter about an hour after me. Lux, Venus, Mirage were all there at the time, and Venus managed to capture in picture the bear hug between BA and I. Shortly thereafter they were gone, probably never to be seen again, and BA and I spent the afternoon catching up on the last year, the demons we dealt with, re-integration to society challenges, etc. We grabbed the top floor in the shelter, set up by the window, and never left the shelter again until morning. Good to see him...really good.
Tomorrow we had planned a 16 to Mtn Harbour, but we decide we would rather do 8, and spend the night at the iconic Overmountain shelter, a great barn near the historic OverMountaiin pass of Revolutionary history. This change will hamper my sched a bit, but that's ok, there is no pressure this year, and the long term plan will be just fine if I don't make Damascus this year...and I have a terrible heel blister that needs attention, definately a zero, maybe a couple, but toughing it out at the moment, in hopes of good weather for the next day crossing the Roan Highlands.
Dinner...snacks and a ramen, wasn't really supper hungry tonight, and some adjustment needed as we added a day, so re-alloting food stores to accommodate that.","
",Roan High Knob shelter,"Apr 25, Wed",8.50
Kinsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588802,"BA and I decided the night before to only do 7-8 miles, and stay at the iconic barn shelter, then finish out the rest of the 16 to Mountain Harbour hostel a day later.
It's tough to slip silently out of the second floor of the small cabin that is Roan shelter, on a ladder, with a pack that just makes it through the hole in the floor, so we agreed to wait until most were awake...or til our bladders couldn't hold out any longer. Bladders won...and we got outside to see a pink sky with blue hints. No more sitting around, 730, pack up and get going. The weather was semi pleasant but no blue skies appeared.
Hitting Carver gap in about an hour, I noted the USFS signs and knew a decent privy would be near. Small things can really excite a hiker...  dry paper, roofs, just to mention a couple. I made sure to let my fellow hikers in on the little secret, and they were grateful. ;>)  Crossing the road I took my first steps into the Roan highlands, and had a good view for about 15 minutes, but then it clouded over for the next 5 miles, and views were severely limited. Too bad, as this is part of the section highlight, being in the grasses and balds.
Mostly a downhill day, easy side slope contour walking, that sort of thing. I arrived at the barn while the weather was relatively nice and a great view of the valley below, and the ridge line we would follow tomorrow, for maybe an hour. BA arrived and we set our hammocks in a small grove of Hawthorne on the hillside beside the barn, so we could enjoy what little view we would have, rather than be inside the barn walls. Of course the place filled up with soggy hikers, it rained most of the afternoon and all night. We were fortunate to arrive before the rain, and remained dry.
We also found trail magic of 2 beers and 2 Mountain Dews left in the loft...  Thanks very much to our unknown benefactor! They were delicious and welcome with our Beef Stew and Lasagna Mtn Houses. 
Tonight is the first night not in a shelter, and it feels good to be in my hammock, snug in the same down cocoon as last season, even if there is a pitter patter of rain on the tarp.","Roan High Knob shelter
",Overmountain shelter,"Apr 26, Thu",7.10
Kinsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588939,"Waking at the usual time I heard no pitter patter on the tarp. Some owls hooting and a lone turkey gobbling in response from some pines down in the valley below the barn was all the sound for quite a while, until the rest of the song birds started in.
A nice comfortable sleep, it was tempting to return to it, but out I rolled and began packing up. A 9er today, to get down to Mtn Harbour, a shower and a burger await.
Due to the ensuing sogginess and poor vis,  BA and I discussed repeating Carver to Mtn Harbour on the next day, as the weather will be clearing. We can't wait it out today...We have already made a 1 day into a 2 day hike, and as a result we ate our spare day/emergency foods for dinner last night. Just a few left over items from yesterday's snack bag to fuel the fire today.
I start out about 10 min prior to BA, pause for water on the way out, and then it is poor views and rain again, the climb out of the gap at the barn up onto the ridge is a grind, with no real warm-up distance before the ascent. I stop half way up and remove rain pants and coat, plus a layer of techwic to manage temp, and though there is no rain on the ridge, the blowing mist dampens my hair and shirt. It is a comfortable cool to go with a now improved pace.
The features of the Roans...grasses and rock outcroppings, come in and out of view, looming up in the heavy mist, disappearing behind just as quickly. The only ""landmark"" is the trail itself, winding ever onward and seemingly ever upward . As I climb Little Hump and Hump Mtn, about 700 feet each, I paused to re-don my OR rain shell to keep out the wind. I pause on Hump in the lee of a small outcrop near the top for a couple tuna wraps and to enjoy the weather, hoping the gray would break open from the sun I can feel on my hands and face but not see at all. It never comes, so I make the 5.5 mi trek down to Rt 19 in about 2 hours. A big milestone in this 5 mile chunck...the end of the AT in North Carolina. 2 States complete.
After snapping a couple photos of the sign I moved on a decent clip, and near the bottom, I surprised a couple morel hunters coming out of theirr secret spot along a creek, each bearing a plastic shopping bag with several pounds each inside. BA had mentioned it was the season for them here. I chatted them up a bit to put them at ease that I have no ill intent on their hot spot, and then got an education in morels as I slowed my pace  to walk with them. 
Neat, but sounds like quite a bit of effort to prepare. Apparently they can sell for $25 or so per pound, but these fellers look to eat what they have scored, it shows in their eyes. Sort of like a New Englander and the first syrup run, or springtime Fiddleheads, is what I would compare it to. As we approached the road, they offered me a ride down to the hostel just as BA pulled up behind them, and we both gladly accepted, even though it's only .3 and all downhill, to walk it. Lazy hiker trash... 
An AT burger, bacon and all the other fixin's, some onion rings, and a couple IPAs to wash it down, a little conversation and planning for the big repeat tomorrow in gorgeous weather,  I express a little doubt as I have been ignoring an epic heel blister several layers deep for a couple days, but finally get a decent shower, clean and dress it, tape it up good, and promise to be ready for a 9 shuttle to Carver gap. With that I bid BA and a new friend Rob, goodnight, and crawled in the pickup bed tent, to enjoy a night on an air mattress.

Got one of those famous Mtn Harbour breakfasts with BA and Rob, made a check of heel, gave it a fresh dressing and tape, laced up, and into the van for a nice ride up the mtn to the gap we went.
Gorgeous blue skies, a few wispy clouds here and there, no haze at all and the views are incredibly clear, and long. Exactly what we hoped for and will certainly be worth covering this ground a 2nd time.
The balds are gorgeous as they spread up and out into the distance. The trail is clearly visible over little Hump and Hump. The day quickly warms, and the miles slide by as I absorb the views and uniqueness of my surroundings. So glad I decided to try and pull a 15er on a bad heel...don't even feel it, the tape and medicated bandage is doing its job, this is the highlight of the section I'm seeing today, and every step is a pleasure.
Rob is quite a bit faster than BA or I, and he was soon out of sight. BA and I leap frog a bit, and run into Rob, big grin on his face, every now and then throughout the day. BA and I have lunch near the Houston Ridge plaque, and take the last 5 at a more leisurely pace than the first 10 miles as we head back down to Mtn Harbor.
BA needs to head back to KY tomorrow...something about a pony race going on back home. He tells me it's a highly profitable time in rare wines and whiskeys for someone of his profession.  :>)
We arrive back at Mtn Harbour a little after 4, and just chill a bit. Dave tells me we beat the average time by a half hour.. and if I count the trip to the privy before leaving Carver, then it's 45 min. Not bad for less than a week on trail, 15 mi in 6.5 hrs with a break for lunch.
Dinner off the food truck, a chicken burger with bacon and a chicago style beef hot dog, onion rings. Great portion,  reasonable price, cooked to order. Dave does a real nice job and makes some pretty good grub. I definately recommend Mtn Harbour, they're good people, genuine in their care for you, run a clean and honest operation.
Hanging out for a couple hours after dinner, chatting with other hikers and some of the B&B guests, but eventually a full belly and a couple of beers , not to mention the 15 miles, has me looking for a bed.

Kinsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606305,"Hi and happy New Year. 
Laying around a couple days with the flu, looking at the class of '19 up and comers to pass the little time I'm not sleeping, reading old entries, and realized a couple were mis-ordered and that I never finished up last year's journal entries. Here goes...
After a gorgeous and sunny 15 from Carver Gap to TN 19E slackpack with BA and Rob, on a silver dollar sized heel blister beneath a half roll of 1 inch tape, prudence demands down time. An infection is not worth it. It doesn't hurt, but it's pretty ugly and going to take weeks to fully heal as it is. BA and Rob are both headed home, and there is no point in my hanging around a hostel for a week, so I make the decision to join the wagon train out to the interstate.
We hang out till 11, and discuss next year for a few minutes, thank Dave and Sharon for their hospitality, let em know I'd be back next season, reluctant to part yet knowing we must be on our ways, we shuffle haltingly toward our rigs, a hug and well wishes, stay safe and see you next year, and thats it. It's over. Once again richer for the time spent. Mildly saddened it has to end. If I could figure how to get paid what I make now, but to be out here, I'd do it year round. Me and everyone else...yeah I know. If it were only this simple. Imagine, as Lennon did.
Thoughts while driving are far more pleasant this time northbound. This was good, and instead of having negative thoughts of disappointment for missing out and failure as I passed various trail town highway signs, such as Damascus, Grayson, Shenandoahs, Luray, while I cruise north, I am uplifted for the things I have to look forward to in the coming years. I even detoured a little side trip into Damascus for the hell of it. Cute little trail town, swung in to check out the outfitter stores, and then back out to the interstate again and onward.
Mostly uneventful ride north but for the clown 5 or 6 ahead of me that nearly caused a pileup, several of us ending up in the median, because at 80 mph he decides to try and reverse direction in one of the cop crossovers. Amazingly not a single car touched another. Once everyone back up on the the road it was quiet from then on. Drove up through Delaware Water Gap to Matamoras PA and took a nap in the Wal-Mart parking lot for a few hours, then joined the rainy morning commute N.Y. traffic all the way up to Bennington VT., where I was greeted by more rain and several inches of snow once reaching Hogback Mtn. Ah, yes. Good ole New England dreariness. 
Plans are already laid for '19. 2 weeks, May 4 thru 16, starting at Mtn Harbour and ending in Atkins. Will be seeing the ponies this year if all goes as planned, 10 days with a 15 mi avg, a short stint on the Creeper out of Damascus for a change of scenery...and I want to wet a line in the river there,  maybe have a trout for dinner one night, put that featherweight pen rod to use for the first time. Will make 400 miles in the first couple hours, and the 500 mile mark near end of second week, and see the last of TN. Should be in Damascus the weekend before trail days and out in time for what will likely be some fairly empty trail on the north side of town while the party goes on.
BA on board but his exact dates as yet unknown. Paruhkeet also looking to join this year, possibly the entire distance, very cool will be great to see her and hear of her grand adventures...she went the furthest of us in '17 and then you may recall my mentioning she was a Granite Gear caretaker in '18.   Quartermaster says she's in if we can find a goat and chicken sitter,  as a small farm has cropped up here.  She wants to see the ponies and easy to do for her from Grayson Park.
Should be a good time and looking forward to the now annual Spring stroll again. Can't come soon enough.

Kinsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612234,"Been counting down the weeks, it's finaly time for the annual mental reset. I have come to really enjoy doing the trail in a section per year and I think the memories are a bit more crisp, the days don't get to the point of running together in obscurity, as some did in 2017 after several weeks on trail. 
Hike in the rain, sleep in the rain, eat, shit, and piss in the rain. At least that's how it mostly went the last 2 years. Makes those nice days all the more wonderful, though, like the last day in '17 to Erwin, and the last day in '18 repeating the Roans. Maybe this year will be different.
Home base to start this year is Black Bear resort. Quarter Master coming along, she scored the Creekside Cottage for  the first week...and it happens to sit right on the bank of a stocked trout steam, 12-16"" Rainbows and native Brookies. Finally gonna try out the micro pen rod I took along 2 years ago and never used.
Hiking day 1 is a drop off at Shook Branch Rec area and slack pack the 9 miles back, up and over Pond Flats on the east side of Hampton TN, to the resort, for a little warm up.
Day 2 and 3, SOBO 25 miles down to see old friends at last season's base camp and jump off point. Shannon, Mary, and Dave at Mt  Harbour, hopefully just in time to score some of Dave's lunch or dinner offering.
Get picked up, have a night at Black Bear with QM. BA should arrive from Kentucky, and we start for Damascus in the morning, meeting back up with QM in 3 days.
Paruhkeet had planned to join us as well, for the whole 2 weeks, we were going to pick her up on the way down through NY, but she has recently suffered a concussion, has some vertigo, and obviously that doesn't mix real well with hiking, so has bowed out for this year. Too bad, was looking forward to seeing her and catching up., but certainly want her to take it easy and get better. We shall see what 2020 brings.
Anyway, after Damascus it's time to head for Grayson, assuming no injuries or illness to that point. I have heard there is quite the Noro outbreak between Erwin up to just shy of Damascus right now. Lovely. Might just totally avoid shelters this year. Might have to anyway....dropping into the middle of the bubble 2 weeks before trail days, I expect it will be crowded on the trail for the first week.
Will pass the 400 and shooting for at least the 500 mile mark. Several nice sets of waterfalls, fat man squeeze, Grayson ponies. New friends and time with old ones. Southern foods and some travel with my wife a few days. Looking to be a good time.
Gear is still the same, though I have replaced my OR gaitors and rain pants (both under lifetime warranty) with the same ones, after much use and abuse. Menu and snack bags havent varied much, though on those I have swapped out the little debbie oatmeal cream pies for a special k and berries bar. The cream pies just don't travel well in a cargo pocket and are mush if not eaten in the first mile of the day.

Kinsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613288,"After a 15 hour drive, and an hour's nap at the TN Welcome Center, we pushed the last 40 mi to Black Bear Resort, met Linda and Travis the new owners,  and checked in to sleep away the rest of the day in the Creekside Cottage. 
Sunday dawned dreary, rain in the forecast, and I happily drove up to the lake to begin a 8.1 mi slack back to BBR were I knew a clothes dryer existed. Rain coat, shorts, gaiters, I forego the rain pants at first.
Starting up the trail after saying goodbye to Turtle...formerly Quartermaster. (She wanted a new name?) I said thanks for the trail and started climbing. Stopping after a short while to put the rain pants on, then continuing the 1800 foot climb to Pond Flats, a ""level"" stretch of trail  with a couple vernal pools the size of a mid size car. Rain is heavy at times but often it is a pleasant mistiness. 
Once the descent starts the rain is off and on, there are many switchbacks, and I am pretty wet from sweat. I reach the blue blazed shelter cutoff/high water alternate trail, and follow the AT down in to Laurel Fork gorge, hoping the water isn't covering the trail after what has been several days of rain.. once at the river edge I can see the water is up, but not too much. I had been watching a rock behind our cabin at BBR the day before, and noted in the morning just before leaving for the hike that it had become submerged over night, so I was glad to be able to walk the gorge to Laurel Falls. The Falls were thundering, and it was pouring the hardest it had all day, as I had a snack and took some pics.
The 300 stairs up out of the gorge, kind of a grind but I'd rather do them on a day like this than in 90 degrees with 80% humidty.
I passed 400 miles somewhere up on Pond Flats, but not sure exactly as i`m sort of moving the wrong direction. 
4 10ths back to BBR from the trailhead at Dennis Cove Rd,  and I throw everything in the dryer, and start getting the full pack ready for the next two days hike back south to Mtn Harbour.
Nice to be back on trail. It rained all day, so if the weather turns nice I won't feel  later that I've been cheated out of my moisture quotient for the year. Gear all performing as expected, feet dry and no blisters. A good start so far.","Watauga Lake/Shook Branch Rec Area

Passing a rotted shed is the only thing of significance until it reach some elevation. As I climb the ridge the sun starts to do the same, the heat is starting to build and  I swap a hat out for a buff. The trail is a typical gentle grade, well maintained and easy walking. The forest is a very nice early shade of green, the fielded hilltop are lush with 6"" tall grass.It becomes a gorgeous day, forest alive with this song of birds. I saw either an indigo hunting or a bluebird but could not tell which as I was standing in one of the mountain meadows. I think it watched me as much as I did it.I stopped at some shelter, didn't really pay attention to the name, for a couple quick tuna wraps and headed out again. I'm moving about 1.5 mph average for the morning and maintained that over the mostly downward afternoon until reaching my camp for the night at Upper Laurel Fork, where at about 3 I set my hammock up right next to the stream, and in a moment of either bravery or stupidity, decided to forego the tarp for the night. It didn't rain and I had starlight and the sound of the stream to fall asleep to.So far I have only seen a dozen people headed north.

Kinsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625929,"Hi and Happy New Year. It occurred to me that I had not completed last year's journal entries. I havent decided if I should make one long one or several, 1 day per entry, as always. Its been nearly 9 months, and this year was of course a great deal different than prior years, I definately will not remember all. Thinking about the terrible things last year while planning for this year is what reminded me of my oversight....
I guess I'll try for the many, will probably screw up some details along the way, but here goes.
As always, awoke with the birds, a nice day on tap, I laid in the hammock just a few min, happy to be dry as I recall I went topless that night. Takedown took about a minute with no tarp to package up. The couple that rolled in late and set up on the opposite bank, showed no sign of rising soon, and down the trail I slipped in the twilight.
Again, its good to be back, a night solo in the bush, still capable, and old ways and mannerisms return. Mental shift complete, cares of the world slid off, every motion purposeful. Like slipping into a skin, even the slight pain and muscle ache is welcome. An old, familiar and comfortable friend...
If memory serves, there wasnt much along this stretch...although I think the spot that someone had hauled a cast iron bench to was in this piece. The bench was rotted, a couple logs in its place. Somewhere along here I also got the call of nature...  nice to have a dry time of it. ? There was some very nice high meadow strolling in the afternoon along the river.
Legs are feeling good, old habit of not eating needs to be overcome again. Looking forward to seeing the crew at Mtn Harbor, maybe get some food there. Turtle to pick me up around 4.
Got down off the ridge and made it out to 19. Found the new path Dave has made down into the hostel and passed a nice treehouse down in there. Got to the office, locked up. Dave and Sharon both off on shuttle runs and didnt see either. Turtle rolled in and back to BBR we went, after a stop to stock up on some Terrapins. I had been looking for Terrapin IPAs all over in 2018 and came up empty, but they had a good stock down the road from the resort. First found those at the NOC. The Hopsecutioner is especially tasty. They only ship as far north as PA.
Tomorrow the plan is to jump ahead a bit, to TN 91 trailhead, and start a couple days out from Damascus and hike into town. Spend about a week before trail days with several slacks between there and Grayson Highlands, then at the end of the trip, I will return to TN 91, and hike back to Watauga Lake before heading home. Not the original plan, but weather forecast made this a better way to do things at the time, and because BA would be joining us and wished to walk a couple chunks in particular again, in his limited time. Jiggled things a round a little to accomodate. This might have proved to be a very fortunate change in events.
Dinner was something insignificant from 7-11 I guess, maybe even McDs. BA rolled in around 6 and introductions to Turtle, a couple beers and some catching up took place.

A bit later than usual for me, the heat was starting to rise as well, but it is a beautiful blue day with high clouds and long hazeless view. For now anyway, rain coming this evening. 
Easy walking trail today, lots of tall grass, so on the lookout for ticks. Permethrin on everything a week before heading south, should be all set, but vigilant none the less. Came by and then took a few min to seek shade in the decrepit Queens Knob shelter. Sweat is rolling off, but only about 1.5 mi to go to Abingdon. 
At the campsite we scouted around and settled for a site at the elevated point about 150 yards from the shelter. Got our hammocks up and started hearing a few rumbles to the west. Lots of folks rolling in, biggest crowd I've seen by far to date. Shelter is full, a good 10+ tents, a few other hammocks. Its quite a hike down to the water so taking all containers so I have enough for tomorrow as well as tonights dinner.
Speaking of dinner, this is one of those details that time erases, so I have no idea. Some Mtn House or a Knorrs Im sure.

Left a bit before BA, and everyone else. He was up, going to have some breakfast. I always eat on the move sometime in the first couple miles, and had a Special K with berries bar as I moved along , not making a sound but for the gentle swish of pant legs and pack straps. Woods are silent except for the dripping from the forest canopy. 
Today is not a very long hike and pretty much all down hill, so I made Damascus fairly quickly, and saw the Red Racer pull in to the town park parking spaces, piloted by Turtle, just as I came by the pavillion. 
Suspecting BA would be a while, took a ride uptown to the gas station for some fried chicken, potato wedges, egg roll, and mushrooms.
Back to the park to wait for BA, he wasnt all that long coming into town. I found 5 bucks while exploring the gazebo, so lunch was free, and back to the store we went for muchies for him.
After eating, we hiked the Creeper trail about a mile west of town to the cabin we had rented along the river for several days, showered, and then drove back to explore and check out the outfitter shops for the rest of the day. 
We all went out for dinner that night at the coffee shop, had some good brews and a great meal. Oh yeah, almost forgot...end of another State, well, except the bit I will be going back for on the last 2 days, TN 91 to Watauga lake.

That's her in the photo, hanging with a pregnant mare. 
So up we went, me stiff as a damn board, and usually that will wear off but it didnt this time. We climbed up to Fat Man Squeeze and back down, a little snack on one of the outcroppings, and spending ample time with various ponies each way. Turtle can now claim she ""hiked the Appalachian Trail"", in a Bryson sort of fashion. ?
Tonight is the one night we dont have the cabin, but do have a different place to stay at a place in the middle of town, so headed over there, showered, and went out for dinner at the diner for some basic American fare. After the second shower the back muscles started relaxing and all is good with a few vitamin A.
Good we got some time in for her to take in some of the sights. She also hiked in to the water falls by Black Bear resort. Places that have nice attractions closer to the road are better for her, given her health challenges. Weather is about to take a turn for the next few days.

Took us 4.5 hours to get to the town park, including the little safety check and then a snack to cure the munchies, at the half way point picnic area.
A bit after 2, back at the cabin for some beers and a late lunch we whipped up from stuff we got at the grocery store next door to the cabins. Planning for tomorrow is to go up to another crossing and hike back to where we got dropped off today.
We were chillin and enjoying the late afternoon, I was laying on the bed, just starting a journal entry, when we heard about the murder, just up trail. I wont rehash it all out here. I'm sure without even looking that plenty of folks on here wrote about it. It was shocking. Disbelief. Too damn close. I missed this guy in a couple places by 1 day, including at Mtn Harbour where he blocked the trail. On the way down there I went by a dog headed north on the trail the first day, I didnt see an owner and asked another couple about it, they said it wasnt theirs. I never did see who that dog was attached to, and happy of it. The feelings are still undescribable. 
I put down the tablet, and never wrote another word until 2 days ago when I started these entries. And since I am writing this several months after the fact, I can tell you that of the several days solo hiking after this occurred, I have never in a lifetime of hiking and hunting, felt so ill at ease in the woods and I have never checked my backtrail like I did for the rest of the trip. 
The whole hiking communiy was stunned. People were scared. Not many hiked out of town the next day, including us, and not many hiked in either. Hold in place was pretty much what people defaulted to until the information became clearer. Those that did hike out did so in numbers.

Up early, we headed to Massie Gap in the pre dawn twilight. It is clear down low but the mist builds as we weave our way up Jeb Stuart highway.
Arriving at the road up into the park, it is a bit drizzly. I jump out in the parking lot, put on rain gear, bidTurtle a safe ride back to town, and off across the meadow I go.
Its a little chilly, and alone with my thoughts they are morbid, but soon the trail mind set, paying attention to where my feet are going, as well as the effort of the climb, take over.
As I make my way up, southbound thru the mist and slight drizzle, I come upon some cattle. They are not impressed with my intrusion, and I am wary of their attitude. There is a calf. I give them a wide berth, going thru some of the brush and rejoining the trail several dozen yards further along, they bellow and follow a bit, but soon go their own way.
Fat man squeeze comes and goes, as does the upper meadows and open areas. Shortly I start seeing some wet hikers coming along, so I know the shelter is not far. Passing the very nice looking meadow tent sites along the way I muse they might have privided a pretty nice resting place, snap a few pics, and onward without missing a step.
I start seeing some ponies, and soon arrive at the shelter, which is still housing some occupants. A pony is at the platform. Another couple pic
There are a few tents in the area, and then I come upon a mare and foal. A couple others come by as I hop the fence, and stop to take a few more pics.
Not long later, the spur to Mt Rogers peak, VA's highest point comes up on the right, and even though there will be no view, i will likely never be here again, so I take the 15 min side trail. The mist did not disappoint, there was no view.
Back on the main trail it begins the long down. The walking is pretty easy, passing an occaisional soggy nobo, the weather begins to clear as I pass below cloud level. 
Later it becomes a very nice day, rolling hills interspersed with heather, small trees, and open highland meadows. The sun is out, vista long. Yellow wildflowers dot the landscape as the trail winds down thru Elk Park, crosses the road, a nice privy nearby, and back into the forest, which is quite lush and fully green these days.
Not all that long later, I cross 601, and meander thru the meadows among the Black Angus cattle chewing their cudds nearby.
Turtle is waiting at the main road when I arrive, and a pleasant ride back to Damascus, some hot food and a shower, then a quiet evening watching the river flow behind the cabin complete the day.

Its quiet, I have the trail to myself. Its going to be a gorgeous 2 days of sun and easy walking. Todays goal is the shelter half way between here and Watauga. 2 days of hiking left, only about 2/3 of what i wanted to get in, but enjoyable what it has been so far, and I got to see the ponies, a couple times, BA again, and with Turtle along for the experience. 
Not far in I run into a train of NoBos headed for Damascus and Trail Days,  which starts in 2 days. I should be another 40 miles north of there today...so much for planning.
The trail today is alot of grass overhanging, so mindful of ticks. The sun is up but it is shaded under a full canopy of tall hardwoods. Most of the ephemerals have gone for the year at this lower elevation but some of  their leaves and stalks remain.  I have come to really love the pre and early canopy southern forest, with its flowers and mists, and yes even the rain. I could walk that forever and never be bored.
Went by Nick's monument. Looks like someone slept there in a tent, the grass was matted down. Quite the epitaph...
I dont see a soul all day, making the shelter around 3. I string up my hammock out back, half out over the cliff via a jutting tree, for a spectacular view. Soon lots of hikers showing up, a group of slackers headed for Watauga....i dont see them arriving before dark, its pretty late with considerable distance to go, but they have their trail legs and I dont, so maybe. They hung out for an hour, smoked a bunch of weed, and giggled their way down the trail. Alone again.

Janice was murdered in front of the shelter at her campfire by Paul Bigley, with a hatchet. I believe that was in 1975. I was 10 that year. 
And that is quite enough of the gory, for 2019, thank you very much.
I awoke early, not even a hint of light from my perch. I swung back to terra firma from the outer end of the off cliff hammock, packed up with the usual silence and slid out of camp. I had fetched water the night before, which is a bit of a way down hill, so no need for any pause. Once again, silence by headlamp, day birds just coming awake and chirping, another gorgeous day on tap. Several miles of silence and forest before eventually seeing the lake and crossing Watauga dam, and then several more paralelling the shoreline before reaching the recreation area.

Headed back to the room at Black Bear resort, another night with Linda and Travis. Theyve been great hosts, and we have actually kept in touch with them. They are ready and open for the 2020 season, and worth the stop for either a shower and bunk or just a quick snack like ice cream and pop or a few days resupply. The fishing here is great, right along the property edge, 16 inch trout, native and stocked. Stopped in the market and bought a bunch more Terrapin, all they had in fact, got back to the resort, cleaned up, ate, and started packing for an early departure to NH. Visited with our hosts a bit and hit the rack.
Left early the next day, watching trail town road signs until we saw Damascus, and just had to swing in. Have come to enjoy the town and its people quite a bit. Coffee at Mojos, stop at the outfitter next door to get a Trail Days tee for me, Turtle, and one for Champagne...you remember Champagne?

Distance to cover, at a minimum, between Massie Gap (500) and Lane ST-Pearisburg (636.5), is 136.5 miles. I would actually like to push a little further than that...we'll see. There is a closure out of Pearisburg for 15 or so miles, so going to hop ahead a bit and get back on at Trout Creek (697) and head to Daleville
Estimated ascent in front half of section is approx 28,920', Estimated descent is 32,740'. I havent figured the second bit gain and loss yet, but Daleville is the end of the Guthook southern VA section.
The downs have it by a little shy of 4000'. Not that much really, but I'll take it. I love the mtns, both ends of the trail are great and challenging, but I am looking forward to seeing some of the rolling lower meadow lands and other terrain changes of what I have always perceived as the softer middle ground, this year. There are a couple good climbs in that, so I certainly wont feel terribly cheated or that I shortchanged myself on the upish side of it. As always, looking to meet some new people, experience some new places, local flavors and brews (and while down there, stock up on Terrapins to bring back for the summer!!!). Then, come back back north and get my adopted Kinsman and Cascade Brook sections of the AT ready for this year's crop of hikers. The snow should be just about gone by the time we return, and they will certainly need some clean up after a year and a half of nothing.

Be well out there,","Grayson Highands
