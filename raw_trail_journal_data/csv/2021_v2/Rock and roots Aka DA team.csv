Rock and roots Aka DA team,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633126,"So in order to prepare for this thru-hike we have been doing lots of research and one person we both love watching and learning from is Darwin on the trail. You can find him on You-Tube if your curious So anyhow I took lots of notes about the advice we have gotten and we have tried very hard to follow these. So with further a do the list from Darwin goes like this1. Pick a trail2. Year to plan (even though David and I have only spent about 7 months on this, I have been researching this a lot for the last 5+ years and he has wanted to do this since he was in boy scouts and I had the idea back in highschool when I hanging out at boyscout camp and doing the explorers with my dad) this helps save money and gear down3. Make a commitment 4. Do your research (we have watched, read and listened to books on tape, such as Becoming Odyssa, Hiking through, Just passin thru, AT documentaries, How to Hike the AT, Awol and more. Some of the best knowledge is found this way and following those on you tube who have made the journey or or on the journey now. 5. Make a budget and save (it is estimated that you will spend $1000 a month yet some have done this under as well as over)6. Get your gear7. Hike (thanks to many great places and people we have been out and about working these legs)8. Throw your plans out the window and just go with the flow9. Put your life on hold (such as car insurance and anything else you spend monthly that you will not need while away. This saves money and less headaches) 10. Now live your life and hit the trail",,View Entry,"Oct 11, Sun",0

Rock and roots Aka DA team,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632798,"So this resupply ""bounce"" box idea is brilliant and time consuming lol
It really makes you think about what foods you will want to eat and researching plant based options. Thank god we have more choices then people realize. It just might not be the healthiest to eat. Yet we have lots of variety.
So what is one thing we are guaranteed to be eating on the trail......
Yep, you guest it energy bars along with other hummus, juice, yogurt, salad mix, on resupply day when we have the chance of getting to a grocery store. If I know David we will also be picking up lots of fresh fruit and veggies. ;) 
Some other ideas we have thought about it getting a pack of dogs on those days and having them for lunch and dinner. They shouldn't go bad between the both of us. We got some of these ideas off of You tube Vegan resupplying. Thank you to the herbivore hiker. She gave us the idea to buy belvita crackers for breakfast. Which hopefully be a nice change from all the oatmeal we resupplied with haha. She also gave us the idea of buying hotdogs and wrapping them in tortillas and getting some type of plant based dip to go with it. Then they get finished up at dinner with couscous, banza and Knorr. 
along with that we saw how one resupplies with the basic trail mix, brownies, nut butters, chips and earth balance squares when available and not to forget the freezer bags if we are low. We are hoping to re-use as many of the ziplock bags we can along the way. 
 hope to try the backpacker burrito 
refried beans, Knorr and Doritos 
We will let ya know",,View Entry,"Feb 26, Fri",0
Rock and roots Aka DA team,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632869,"Today we mailed off the first bounce box! We have spent many hours dehydrating fruits and veggies to help keep our energy levels up. We also spent some time making a few treats that got vacuum sealed. Hoping it will be worth it along the way. We are in the final weeks before this adventure, walk about begins. Working hard to make sure everything is in order so we still have a few days to relax and take care of non trail projects.",,View Entry,"Mar 01, Mon",0
Rock and roots Aka DA team,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633060,"So we finally did it we have sprayed our gear for the first 6 weeks on the trail or through 6 washes to help us with trail bugs. the top three that appear to be mentioned through all our research our Mosquitos from Georgia to Maine.  It has been mentioned that Pennsylvania and up has the worst. Ticks oh my.... yep they are already out and New England has the reputation for the worst. We shall see and Vermont is known for the black flies.
So how do you prepare, we first Permethrin yes we broke down and treated almost all of our gear. We have also purchased natural wipes to use along with essential oil remedies. The last thing we did was purchase head nets that fit over top of a baseball cap. We looks kind of funny yet if it helps who actually cares. One thing we did not do was buy anti bug clothing.  Apparently it does exist and we just created our own with treatment.",,View Entry,"Mar 07, Sun",0
Rock and roots Aka DA team,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633059,"David and I started planning this adventure many months ago and as we get closer to the departure date  into the wild I often look back in the notebook where it all began. 
So for today it was food ideas for our resupply ""bounce"" boxes. We thought we would make 15 boxes however we have slimmed it down to 8
Back in November we gave ourselves a budget of what we would spend on these boxes and I feel we might have gone just a tad over. 
So what did we pack? 
Lets see.............
pre-made foods (backpacker pantry, good to go)
dehydration ideas for soups sauces and oatmeal
ramen

 We both have are deuce of spades (trowels) and I only hope they work well and we get more comfortable shitting in the woods. This is for us to did cat holes. Thank god we got a supply of dude wipes!
Also we have to remember this is a leave no trace area so that means if the bidets don't work we are responsible to  carry out.

Rock and roots Aka DA team,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633204,"So I made a list of most of the items we put into each box we made. It is nice to look back and see what might be coming to help us prepare and plan on resupply days. David and I spent many hours working hard getting these together with dehydrating fresh produce and some marinated tofu. We even made some sweets and vacuum sealed them to help with those cravings I tend to get lol. 
Heads up this entry is mostly for us yet its also nice to share just in case someone was wondering what two vegans will be eating in the woods. You will be quite surprised its most likely what many people will be eating we just substituted the animal with plants.

She is a triple crowner. We hiked for about 5 hours meeting other through hikers including Jordan from Connecticut, and Nicole and Panga.  The scenery was beautiful as we climbed through the mountains.  We arrived near strong flowing creek just before camp. filled up with water.  We met Moxey the ridge runner who is staying here.  She through hiked the AT in 2014.  We have seen St Patrick, Cara, Patrick, Audra, and a couple named Paul and Marie from Tallahassee Fl at the shelter past couple of nights.

Lots of weekend hikers out with dogs. First bear bag hang was needed and hiked the morning over  blood mountain which is the highest in ga. In the evening we stayed at blood mountain cabins with four fellow thru hikers.   Oh yeah, walked into the store for  our pack shake downs at Mountain Crossings by Jeff aka ib tat on YouTube.  We sent a bunch of gear home and donated some to a hiker box reducing our pack weight.  We feel a lot better. We took a shuttle to JR'S roadkill BBQ where we ate salad, chips and salsa and beers to go with the crew and out shuttle driver Michelle. Today we spent the morning in mountain crossings and hiked on toward Whitley shelter. It was a tuff hike up and down mountains and sometimes along ridges. Ran into Marie and Paul up here and camping with them and st Patrick and Kara. The views have been amazing almost hard to describe when your not able to look past what your use to. Dinner tonight was awesome bc we all ate on a rock overlooking the mountain view of the trail we have accomplished thus far. Tomorrow we hope to walk 12 miles to the next shelter. Lots of video and photos have been taken. As well lots of snacks eating along the way.","Mountain Crossings

Rock and roots Aka DA team,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633691,"We got an early start, leaving our camp site by 8:45.  We hiked out past a parking lot into the mountain forest where we hiked along ridges. We crossed over mountains several times to get to another ridge trail.  More buds are sprouting due to the warming Georgian sun.  We filled our water bottles at 2 streams the first was a small waterfall next to the trail.  We crossed over a long rocky area where everything was mossy. It reminded us of a fantasy land.  We arrived at Blue mountain shelter around 4pm. Greeted by our new friends we set up our tent and made our selves dinner.  Tonight we had couscous and home made rice crispy treats.  I started the fire for our shelter.  Many more arrived filling the tent sites around the shelter.  We chatted with friends as we watched a beautiful sun set over the mountains.

Today we traveled 12.8 miles ascending 4275ft and descending 3940ft.  The day started off at the shelter. It stopped raining before we woke up.  We had some breakfast and chatted with Cheddar and Chickpea.  We went over many mountains. The views where fog until it cleared up later in the day.  We made it to another Shelter where our friends were staying the night. After discussing our resupply plans with them and resting a while we went on to hike another 5 miles to a camp site that has a water source.  We ran in to Jonah who we had met and Mushroom and Stephenie.  For dinner we had Kare Kare seasoning on rice noodles with sunflower butter and mashed potatoes. After the long day of hiking it was delicious.

Rock and roots Aka DA team,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633880,So yesterday we did a Nero and got off at dicks creek gap and picked up by the famous trail angel miss Janet. She took us to the the lake chatuge lodge for a cleansing and resupply after 6 miles in a rain storm. It was like a giant slip and slide and we made it down the hill. Last night we had dinner at the titled Cafe with some trail friends/family and all went shopping at ingles for a 6 day resupply as we head out of ga into NC.  today miss Janet picked us up and brought us back to trail. You can you tube her if not familiar. She is awesome we filmed a little for her and she got into some of our video as well. After saying goodbye till erwin Tennessee we began our hike of 9 miles ascending 2234ft and descending 3436ft. It was a beautiful day the terrain was up up up. We made it to NC that is one state completed and 12 more to go. Now we are all snuggled into our tents for the evening hoping the rain will hold out for a while. We plan on hiking to a shelter tomorrow and seeing if we can ride out the storm predicted to hit Sunday. Fingers crossed. Tonight's dinner was by far one of the best we had Asian salad and a quinoa bean mix in a tortilla with some follow your heart cheddar cheese. Yes our packs are little heavy with this type of food but we figured its best to try and get some nutrition after resupply in town. Plus we know what we have to eat first to make the packs a little lighter in the week.,"Dicks Creek Gap

Yet we have survived. We stayed at standing Indian shelter for two nights one day being a zero due to all the rain and storms. The next day we hiked over 16 miles to make our way up the scrambling rocks to the fire tower. The views were beautiful and the day was sunny and bright. We have captured a lot of random trail footage with video devices we hope to share later. we would like to announce we have made it 110 miles on the trail plus the 8.8 approach trail. We have 26 miles to NOC and have decided to take it slow as we wait for another storm with rain and possible hail and snow to pass tomorrow. The temperature is suppose to be in the 20s at night at being wet in those temperatures does not sound good. So the tramily is spending some time together visiting the hiker friendly town of Franklin. Tonight we hit up the lazy hiker brewery and got some good eats. We are also hoping to do a few errands as well rest up for the climbs ahead. If you ever need service for footwear outdoor 76 has lots of knowledge and we plan to have them look at Annie's feet tomorrow and see if she is in the right shoe.,"Long branch shelter

The trail angels name trail name was ""intense""  he brought us to a Walgreens the outfitters and then back to the hotel.  People have been so kind on the trail.  We had a lovey Italian dinner; Pasta with veggies and chatted with our trail friends who have been on the same journey as us.  We are  warm and happy and ready another good night of sleep.","Franklin, NC

We even met highlander and his lady Lydia. Had a nice fire and we survived the cold. It was cold and lucky for us old school woke up and made another fire to warm up before the hike. the weather warmed up nicely as we hiked to the third fire tower. Each tower is made differently one is metal one stone and today's was wood. We stopped off took in the views met some lovely people who were out for a day hike on this sunny Saturday. One lady Darlene gave us candy called awake and it had 1/2 cup of coffee in it. The dark mint chocolate was wonderful and no coffee taste at all.. it was the afternoon lunch treat. Yes we  had lunch which was the second one on trail thus far. We have decided to try and make this part of our daily routine to rest and energize. Normally it had been snacks after snacks. So glad we did this because later we would be scrambling down rocks. We saw tim along the way and he said blue is having a great play date Vaca with her friend. We arrived at the shelter around 530 tonight. Not before we got to the point of singing songs along the trail and have the trees sing with us. Annie's new trail name is roots. Seems fitting as Wipeout came from them and now she is becoming one with them. Lol Today had a climb of 2477ft and decent of 5326 ft.  The trail was narrow and steep at times. We made a lot of video footage of it.At camp we met up with are tramily except ripper he went above and beyond and went an extra 2 miles to pick up beers and fries for the night to share. They are all in the shelter which is next to the privy and this one is designed all wrong by everyone in the shelter can get a view smh the woods the life we have begun to call home. Tonight's dinner menu was ok not great some pine nut couscous and gear pasta with knorr veggie mix.

Which is when we hike for the day with just are day pack and they meet us later to drop off our packs. Surprise he found a place and we agreed to wait at the bottom of stecoah gap for Craig. While waiting we had the opportunity to talk with ox who hiked in 97 and is now part of the at trail maintenance. They are in the process of rerouting the trail with a walk over bridge. It was really wonderful to hear the stories of how the trail has changed. Also how much harder it was back then and yet how difficult it still is today. Once Craig picked us up we found out that we were actually staying in a tiny house on the mountain. It is built right on the side of a mountain off from there house. We showered they took are laundry and we cooked cheesy ""not cheesy more lemon tasting"" rice for dinner with beans and veggie sausage. We have just sat around in the tiny house resting for the evening.

It was fruit bars with pumpkin seed butter (which was green) and jelly. We snacked a lot ""we do this often, lol"" We enjoyed the long hike looking down at hazy mountains views caused by a controlled forest burn.  Jacobs ladder was how we started the day and it was a nice workout. We ate oatmeal at the top to refuel for the rest of the morning adventures. We almost ended the day by walking down to the marina and checking out the boats and green water and fish swimming by. Then we realized we had two more miles to hike to the shelter. It is called ""The Hilton"" of shelters. We are tenting but this place is amazing with running water in the privy area along with shower. Its also on the water we are just up on a mountain so we get to look down on the lake.

What a night and what a morning waking to cleaning up the forest. It was full of laughter after all had settled since it seemed the cubs took everyone's toilet paper and all we could do was sing my hinnies clean thanks to charmin and then the bear necessities as we asked into trail magic. It was a wonderful surprise. Hot coffee fresh produce veggie soup and vegan cheese and crackers. The 2020 thru hikers chit chat, her husband, camper, osa and trail angel Aaron did wonders for the soul as well as shared great stories. Thanks again! After lunch we head to max patch and yes it's an incredible view and great place to day hike for many.

We were waiting for one to catch up. Yesterday we hiked about 8 miles to the highest shelter on the AT and stayed in a house. This shelter had 4 walls and a door. It was also two stories so the house was packed and the rain and wind came through the night. However not before Ripper hiked a 21 mile day to catch up with his tramily.

Had a creek next to us and ate dinner on top of a massive rock on the water. 
The next day Sunday we hiked up and over a mountain. Stopping off to check service for the mothers to receive a phone call. We hiked buzzard Rock. On the down hill we met curly a thru hiker in 1992 who is also a triple crooner. She is originally from Germany and shared stories with us from her hikes. She was out taking photos of wild flowers as her husband waited down the trail at the parking lot. I got a photo of her and the book she wants me to read about the trail and women who helped men basically how they worked together. We got rained on on the next mountain climb and I lost my poncho which rock found down the trail. It blew off during a dry spot. While he was off looking for that I was trying to carry two packs further up trail to the shelter as the rain started again. He made it back within 6 minutes and poncho in hand. So we geared up and kept walking towards the shelter. We made it just in time to get a spot upstairs. Not a great night of sleep yet we stayed dry through all the rain and woke to ponies outside. The apples roots had carried 30 miles where greatly appreciated by these beautiful creatures. Two had babies and everyone loved them. We even got a little love show. After that rock and I hiked off trail to summit Mt Roger's the highest area in VA. Came back to the shelter to drive off as it was raining again. Changed clothes, ate breakfast and packed up. We started to hike on north to cross the 500 mile marker. Hook was with us all day hiking and it was great. The rain settled and we hiked in a mist of clouds the rest of the day.

We woke up at our camp spot on the top of a mountain with Noodles, Ref, Not so bad , and Zen.  We hiked 17 miles  in the rain to a road.  Rock and roots spent much of the day hiking there hikes at different paces and meeting up at certain locations. Always rock waiting on roots. The climbs were long with highest elevation gain in VA of 4000 plus.  Before the rain we arrived for lunch at the coolest shelter on the Appalachian Trail. The craftsmanship was second to none with lots of windows and a loft balcony. It even had a porch. 
Rock met the wolf pack (formerly had dogs on trail yet do not now bc of hot weather) ironically it has been raining and cooling off all of a sudden.  names of these amazing  thru hikers are luna hooked on phonics sunflower and lenscap. Roots took a break on top of mountain and did some practicing of yoga.  We had plans to go to the orchard cascades yet the rain turned us differently took look for a spot to camp. We did get to see black Rock outlook while hiking on. When we came to a road we set up the tent, made dinner and called it a night. The weather had broken for a little just in time to complete the evening duties. 
Day 74 This morning we woke up to passing hikers about to make the 2.5 mile hike up the next mountain. It is called apple orchard. We packed up and too set off up the hill. Hiking together to the break stop at the shelter.  moved on bc the water was not flowing. We got to thunder mountain outlook and saw hokey pokey. He told us about trail magic. We turned the corner and saw a trash can and parking lot. When we got down Onassises waved us over and gave us some nutter butters.  We thanked him and continued hiking on thru the clouds and mist. Lunch time rolled in around the top of the second mountain of the day  James River face wilderness. We stopped on top of two big rocks and made a quick lunch. Temps were low which makes breaks shorter and rain was coming. The afternoon hike was mostly all rain and dinner was made earlier then normal bc we arrived 1 mile from destination of the day. We made three amigo stew and rolled it into a tortilla with avocado. After dinner we started to hike on as the rain and slowed down. We hiked two more miles and found a little spot to set up on the river. Now the rain has picked up and we are all settled in for some r and r. Important note of the day we didn't turn the phone on to check anything. It was a white blaze trust each other from the night before planning adventure.","Campsite

It was a lot of climbing from 450 feet back up to 4000. We made it and took some breaks at great spots along the way we documented with video. We crossed the 800 mile marker around 730 pm 
We met Pegasus gooey and mcfly yesterday. Pegasus mom was the lady who drove us back to bland after our ride was Mia. 
Had dinner at punchbowl overlook till it started to rain on us. Quickly packed up and hiked back into the woods. Soup in hand till we found a place to sit and enjoy as the rain settled down.
We woke by the creek and started off this am. Came across a snake with two yellow lines down its back and a pattern.  We came to a creek and roots just walked through it to cool her feet off. Maybe she slipped yet she realized how wonderful it felt and just stayed in standing soaking in the cold water. Luna was wondering what she saw yet later found out when we met up at the shelter which was along side the creek of an old community that was bought up by the national forest is 1920. It was an area that had freed slaves. Also saw the stove fire pit that corn cakes where made. We found out at the shelter that trail magic was happening off 60 next crossing from hokey pokeys aunt. When we arrived it was a double magic bc clay was out with Johanna also. Clay is starting on June 15th from katadin so we hope to see her again. 
We fruited up at trail magic apple orange and banana each. Some chips and peanut butter also. Root got oreos and and orange to go and rock grabbed a few bags of chips and some apples. We had 2000 feet to climb and we did not one summit but two. Cole mountain had great views. We hiked on till 745 when we came to a stealth spot .2 from water which we needed.

At the top of spy Rock we had a beautiful 360 degree view of the Virginia country side.  One of the older gentlemen gave us a map and roots showed him our electronic maps on our phones.  We hiked on to another rock cliff where we had lunch. After we hiked to a shelter called Priest Shelter where it is tradition to confess your ""trail sins"" in the shelter log.  It was a very exciting place to be because first we saw a fawn with its mother and then a fre people who we had hiked with and had not seen in weeks arrived.  We found out that Highlander and Mylady are expecting. We hiked 3.5 more miles filled our water up again and made dinner.  We hiked down to a river crossing,walked over a bouncy suspension bridge with Platnum then Roots and I ate dinner.  We walked 1.5 more miles and set up our tent just as it was getting dark at 9pm.  We set up quickly and are watching red ants and roaches crawl all over the outside of our tent.  It could be worse.","
