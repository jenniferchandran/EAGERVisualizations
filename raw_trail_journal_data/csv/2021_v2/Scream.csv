Scream,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634303,Today Is Easter Sunday 2021. This is my first trail journal entry although I started at the bottom of the falls on the 9th.I have no previous hiking or camping experience and all of this is so new and hard to me. I've been learning and trying to adapt everyday but this is definitely by far the most difficult thing I have ever been through in my life. I am out of shape and over weight and an extremely slow hiker. So slow to the point that I slow everyone down who has ever tried to hike with me that they very politely and apologetically leave me behind.So today I very proudly did 8 miles. From Standing Indian shelter to Carter Shelter. Not bad. Terrain was decent. I made my way at my own pace and only took two water breaks. I did not take a lunch today and it showed towards the end of my day I was barely moving and inching along....My body hurts so bad right now. I am completely stiff from head to toe... And at some point today I developed a rash on my butt that is most likely just a heat rash but it made today even more difficult to move along.. I hope I did not pop a squat in something poisonous lol.I hope I can move tomorrow a bit more smoothly and if I remember correctly it's only 7 miles tomorrow for me.. But it's mount albert and I hear that is pretty steep and rocky.,,View Entry,"Apr 04, Sun",0
Scream,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634470,I have not been able to get any service in several days so I would like to take a step back a few days to carter gap. When I went to go leave the following morning to get back on trail I started heading southbound and thank God I ran into a friend of mine who told me I was headed in the wrong direction. He pulled out guthooks to show me how I was travelling south and in that moment I realized how important guthooks was and how badly I needed itFinally did Albert and let me tell you that sucker was intense. I had to put my trekking poles down in some places and physically crawl up rocks and boulders with my hands and knees and pull myself up. With my knee being injured from a nasty fall on springer and me just plain being over weight and out of shape... It was the hardest things I've done in a very very long time. Possibly the hardest things I've ever done. Finally making it to the top of Albert I took some selfies with the fire tower and proceeded down the other side of albert in the direction and safety of the next shelter... Ran completely out of fuel and nearly all out of food I had to return to franklin for the second time to resupply... Storms are supposed to be rolling in tomorrow night and staying for about 3 to 4 days.... With no money to spare for a hotel room or hostel my plan is to tough it out in the rain and hike in it and hope for the best.....Hope I can get service more frequent for more journal entries.... Scream is out...,"
