I'm sitting here with just over three months till my feet step on to the Appalachian Trail.  I'm not sure I fully believe it's actually gonna happen quite yet.  There is so much going on in the world - states shutting down activities and businesses, threats of martial law, travel restrictions, political unrest.... And of course, Covid.   Will the northern states allow hikers to pass through their states without testing and/or quarantines?  Shelters and privies are closed.  Last year, they closed trail heads.  Can they actually close the Appalachian Trail?  Will I be comfortable with the dog care set up that I've implemented?  Three more months of questions.  If I can get through that and get my feet on the trail, I will not quit!  I will finish!",,View Entry,"Jan 17, Sun",0

Travel size toothpaste, it is!!  I wonder what I can worry about tomorrow!?  I need to train... But after overdoing it (three miles!! really???!!) And having lingering swelling in my foot, I'm opting to not do much training and let the foot have plenty of time to heal inside and do my training on trail.  Probably not the best scenario after a Covid year, but somehow I don't feel the need to put too much anxiety focus on that when there are so many other things I can have anxiety about!!  Do you see the pattern of my journals yet!!  This is my current state of mind!!",,View Entry,"Mar 14, Sun",0

But the hurdles are plentiful!
So, some friends already know this crisis...  I bought a headlamp, charged it, weighed it and decided not to take it to the garage yet so I could charge it again right before leaving.  I also pulled out my canister of dice and a massage creme container I intend to take.  That was the last time I saw those items.  I have no idea where they are and I've searched for hours.  I live in a SINGLE room!!!  Where are these things!!  I've come to believe I've thrown them away!  I'll order another headlamp in a few days and buy more dice.  I can't keep looking in the same few places expecting them to turn up.  😢 
PA seems to be abundant with trail angels!  If I can time it right, I'll meet with one about 40 miles in for a trip to Walmart.  I'll meet with friends (that I met once, back in 2011, when I rode the Tail of the Dragon with them) for a visit about 40 miles later and then another angel a bit after that.  I also may be able to connect with someone I met in 06 on a cruise ship!  She lives in DC and may drive me to the start and hike a few days with me.  If not, maybe we can connect on my way back through heading south.

Hiked solo all day.  Stopped at Dahlgren campground and charged my phone, ate and talked to Dawn and Eddie.  Back on the trail to Pine Knob Shelter.  Caught up with Shep and Harold again.  12.4 mile day.  Had a tension headache all day.  I feel like I'm drinking enough, took a salt stick capsule and Propel.  Maybe it's adjusting to the trail and the tension was leaving my body.

I got lost trying to get to Pen Mar.  I'm not sure what happened but it was concerning.  I couldn't find a blaze for the life of me and I went back to the last one is saw and still couldn't see where to go.  Thankfully, that lasted only about fifteenn minutes and I was on my way again.  I got a shower, 3 sandwiches at Hardee's.. Yes, three!!  And some food for trail.  I had a hard hill to go up with a full pack and once again sat down in the middle of the woods thinking I couldn't make it!!  I pushed through to the next shelter, Deer Lick, rested and pushed through again to the next shelter, Tumbling Run.  Rain expected tonight into tomorrow.  May stay here.  Met up with Harold (Edible) again to camp.  Shep is in Waynesboro with his daughter.  Lots of hikers staying in Waynesboro.  Michelle, the four young men, possibly Saunder and her brother.

Feral,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635876,"So glad I slept in a shelter last night as it rained.  Sounded pretty steady.  Packed up and got out early as rain was expected today and thunderstorms later.  Left about 7ish and the plan was to go to the heck shelter 6.6 miles away and hole up for the rain.  Got the and realized Caledonia State Park was only 3.5 more miles where I could get picked up by Brad and Cathy, so I kept going.  I'm currently waiting at the park at a pavilion, having hiked those last three miles in the rain.  Looking forward to seeing B&C again.  Met once in 2010 to ride the Trail of the Dragon.  We were introduced by a mutual friend who has since passed.  Brad and Greg served together and hadn't seen each other in 25 years when we all met up that weekend.  I'll be forever thankful to Greg for that weekend and introduction.

Side note.. Meet a guy named Jaws yesterday.  Retired EMS worker.  He's been stay at a B&B on Waynesboro.  He said there were four hikers there with injuries from the rock gardens. Two went home!

Feral,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635932,"Today will be my first zero... Meaning I will hike zero miles.  I put in about 10 miles yesterday and stopped at Caledonia and Cathy picked me up.  I got a shower, did laundry, assessed my pack and food, went to dinner and slept in a bed!  Pure heaven!!  This area gets high winds at times and today til tomorrow am, gusts about to 50-60 mph are expected.  I'm staying with Brad and Cathy, and it was decided that going back out could be dangerous as the ground is wet from the rain yesterday and trees can get blown over.  There are also many trees already just leaning on other trees (widow makers)... So I decided a day off was necessary.  Plus, I'm a few days ahead of where I thought I'd be anyway.  Saturday and Sunday should be nice days, but I think rain is expected again on Monday.  
Although I've been hiking solo all week, I'm enjoying it.  I've camped with people every night.  So many thoughts run through my head.. But I'm not sure I feel any clearer about anything specific.  I count a lot.  Mom was a counter.  This happens usually when I'm going uphill and am making deals with myself.  If I go another thirty steps, I can stop and count to 50 to catch my breath!  I can hike pretty fast.  But this rock stepping hurts. I feel like a Clydesdale.. Picking up my feet to walk over them.  No lasting soreness or problems, thankfully.  
Today is going to be blissful!  We don't realize how lucky we are with all of our creature comforts!!

Off I went!!  I wouldn't have gotten up the hill out of Caledonia without them!!  A few good climbs, nothing really to write about.  Went 9.6 miles to a crowded shelter/tent area.  All the weekend hikers were out in droves.  Talked to most of them and everyone was super nice.  Even got a compliment on my skin!  Someone wanted to know my skincare routine.  😂. Water and pretty much whatever.  No routine!  
Today I did 17 miles.  Stopped at Ironmasters Mansion.  Wish I could have stayed.  The caretaker asked my opinion on placement of something to be more efficient. She was pleased with my response so we moved the bin of loaner clothes to a more accessible area.  She provided me with a meal and soda.  I stayed about an hour.  I was going to stop at a camp site about 12.5 miles from last night's shelter... But it looked pretty desolate and lonely, so I pushed another 5 miles to be at a shelter with people.  Much better!!  Maybe a short day tomorrow.  I've heard we have to take packs off and scramble over some rocky areas in the next four miles.  Should be interesting!","

Met Lenny and Pat on trail and a family with a dog.  Spoke to a woman that is doing rim to rim in October.  They are all going to follow me.  Didn't get the woman's name but told her I'd answer any questions she may have.  People are so nice to hikers!!
Stopped in at Kinda Outdoorsy and had some cookies and a soda and sat a bit.  I was the only one there.  Decided to stay at a church, do eagles the .5 miles there, left my pack, met the pastor and went back to the Doyle for a shuttle to the grocery store.  Ran in to Boomerang and he went with me.  Came back and ate dinner at the Doyle, then walked back to the church.  Touched base with the pastor and found out Jaws was staying here as well.  They have eggs and pancake stuff for hikers.  We are the first ones to stay here.  Nice place.  Hot shower!
I've been told by two male hikers that I'm a fast hiker.  Apparently they are surprised.  Word got back to me on the JMT that people were talking about my hiking out there.  Not trying to be conceited, but I've said before, I'm built to be a hiker.  
I hope I continue to feel this good during my journey.  I feel good mentally and physically.  I'm still feeling driven... Which is good to a degree..

But is anyone ever ready for that?  Can you say I'm happy with what I've done in life?  How can you not keep wanting more?  ","

Since I actually hiked about 17.2 today I'm going to shoot for making it in to DWG tomorrow night so I can sleep at the church.  That's 20 from here.  We'll see.
I ran in to Iceberg, that I'd met at the Eckville Shelter.  When I last saw her, she wasn't happy and was considering going home from her hiking weeks vacation.  Her hip was hurting.  Her stomach was upset from all the ibuprofen.  She just wasnt feeling it.  Nice to see her out again, still in the woods and much better.

Santa left the shelter first today.  Then me, about twenty minutes later.  I got passed about two hours later at various times by the rest of them!  
It was a biotch of a day as I knew i wanted 20 miles to get in to town to the church hostel.  I think there was only about two miles without some sort of rocks.  It went from just the little ankle biters to boulders.  Learned a new phrase from Slippers...I was angry hiking.  I had so many cuss words going in my head all day!!  I'd meet day hikers and would say things like..I don't know why anyone would choose to hike here!  This is ridiculous!  This isn't hiking!  Not a pleasant greeting or conversation!!  I finally came across an older man who stopped and said, it gets easier after this for awhile.  I stopped and replied... Thank you!  I really needed to hear that!  
Made it to the church and had a reunion with everyone but Pixie.  Everyone went their separate ways for dinner, shuttle to resupply, etc.  
My feet are super sore and I've developed a weird stitch in my right side when I breathe deep.  It's uncomfortable.  But not only that, it started to also cause a nerve sensation on the top of both feet a few seconds after the stitch activates.  It's not pleasant, but doesn't seem to be a major problem.  Just don't understand the connection.  
Found a nice camp site about 12 miles out and gonna shoot for that tomorrow.  Also, making plans for a hostel stay in about three nights so I can get a pack cover.  The poncho isn't going to work in major rain to keep both me and the backpack dry.
Tomorrow's a new day.  Going on to New Jersey.  Hopefully less rocks, but I've heard the ascents and descents will be worse.  One bad incline today had me stopping at least 7 times to catch my breath!!  It was long and steep!  On to the next adventure.  At least I can get stronger and handle these better.  Maybe my feet will catch a break!","

Feral,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637487,"Well I just learned something about trail journals. I can turn it on while I'm hiking and voice text to it so that some of my midday musings can be documented rather than trying to remember them in the evening. But I also found out that unless I go in and actually save that document before my phone shuts off, I lose it. So here we go again... One of the first things I am pondering as of yesterday is that this trail is like a lifetime that I am walking through. The uphills, the downhills and the flats. The uphills seem like they're never going to stop and it takes every bit of stamina and motivation to keep going. The downhills can be treacherous and I have to move slowly and watch each step. Flats, I can stride along without a care in the world. The main thing to remember is that none of those circumstances are going to last. And I've been reminded in life that we just have to keep rolling with everything because it will always change. Things generally never stay bad nor good nor stable! Sometimes it takes a lot to pull us out of bed as we get so sucked down into the bad sometimes.I found out a bunch of hikers went to the tavern yesterday and I'm kicking myself for not going.   I felt awkward as many northbound Georgia hikers had their little groups while I am still hiking solo. I'm not sure whether anybody would have invited me to come and sit with them. I don't mind being alone, but being alone around people that I am Know and am acquaintances with makes me feel like I stick out like a sore thumb. And I didn't want that awkwardness. I think that's something I need to work on and the next instance that is similar, just go on in and decide whether I want to invite myself into a group or feel good about choosing my own place and being alone. Last evening at the picnic table at the shelter, I met  Pagne, as in champagne.  Conversation that I had with Pagne was very interesting as he lives out of a class C motor home and has been traveling around. He has camp hosted at Padre Island along with bartending and was going to make his way to Alaska during summer months to do some work up there. He seems to be the opinion of what I see in my life, however I'm not sure I have motivation to fully embrace that. These are the instances where people think I have such a free spirit, but as much as I promote moving forward and going through with your dreams, I still have my own hesitation and fears. Maybe I'll feel differently in 5 months when I finish the thru!   I do think I'll get a camper to live in at the house to maximize the use of my house for Airbnb and a massage establishment. Then, when and if I choose to hit the road and camp host, I will already have had my camper and going to use it while being in my driveway.I'm currently at Moseys Place, a hostel in her personal residence, with four male hikers.  I feel like I've been validated by several GA hikers when I tell them when I started.  They say in funny great.. Especially compared to several others that started around my time.  They seem to just be taking a summer vacation, enjoying the hostels and restaurants!  Which is totally fine, HYOH!!  Hike your own hike...Also, one of the youngins at the church the other day said he didn't mean to make things awkward, but after finding out I'd only been hiking three weeks, said I had very strong looking calves!!  Haha...I told him I've heard that a few times in the past!  Between the support on my page and compliments like this along the way, I may just suck this out and finish!!  😊","

I bought root beer and ice cream, for dessert.  I'm shooting for Warwick, NY in two days to camp at the drive in theatre.  Shuttle be an easy hike.
Slight change...I got a text asking if I wanted to go to NYC for a day.  I've never been so thought I'd jump at it without knowing details.   Rapture and Capt America were going to get CAs Mom, Jiffy Pop to her cousin for her ride home and have lunch, then get a ride from the cousin out to Middletown.  Upon getting to Middletown, it became a little difficult to get clear information on the train fees and schedules to the extent that I was going to just shuttle back to the trail.  I think it's been figured out.  It's obvious we don't have time to see much, but I think the idea is to just experience NYC.  I'm trying to roll with things, but the planner in me is freaking out!

We had dinner last night at Buffalo Wild Wings.  Had to leave the hotel about 715 to get to the train station.  Got off the train in  Hoboken and took a subway into the city.  We did a fair amount of walking, taking in various sights.  Interesting, how when I think of NYC I think of fashion trends and beautiful people.  That's not what I saw!  Any sort of clothing that can be thrown on is being worn and there were very few beautiful people.  Us hiker trash fit right in.  Another thought occurred to me, if everyone were to put the amount spent on drinks not purchased in a grocery store and brought from home, we'd probably take a chunk out of the national debt!!  It was amazing how many had coffees, sodas, etc ranging from $2-$7, I'm sure!  
We got to see a crazy guy on the subway.  He randomly started yelling.  Then we saw someone talking to himself while looking at his image in a window.  Another guy yelling about killing someone.  
The city is not for me.  This trip confirmed that.  But it did more for me than that.  I grabbed an opportunity.  I got frustrated at not having details and thinking it was going to be a waste of time and money.  I berated myself in my head for trying to do something out of my comfort zone and what I saw was a failure.  But I hung in there and we found a reasonably priced train, managed our way around the city (with only one $3 subway ticket purchased that we didn't actually need).  I saw the sights.  I can say I've been to NYC.  All because I just said yes, when asked if I wanted to go.  I encourage you to say yes more often.  Make it happen, roll with the things that aren't perfect.  Stop looking at why you shouldn't do it and look at why you should!  We only have this one life, shake it up a bit!!  ","

Lots of inclines and boardwalk today.  Worst incline was named the Stairway to Heaven.  
Capt America decided to hike on his own and didn't join Rapture and I at the drive in.  He said he wanted to hike on his own for awhile and nothing Rapture nor I did had anything to do with his decision.  I'm hoping that is true.  They've hiked together for over 1000 miles, I definitely don't want to come between them.
It's free to camp at the drive in and they usually show the different movies on different screens, however, tonight only two projectors are working and we have a choice between a slasher movie, Circular Saw, or Tom and Jerry.  Ugh!  I'd take the slasher film but Rapture isn't into that.

As upset as I was yesterday, I didn't want to go home.  But I did question why I wanted to do this.  It is NOT fun!! Maybe if I were in my 20s and started at Springer and got in with a small group, going in to towns together, hanging at the hostels together...?  But I just see this as hard as hell.  I think I did it to prove something to...?  Who?  Maybe I wanted to come out here and have an epiphany of some sort.  Take a step back and get a clear view of things..?  I'm beginning to think I could have done an extended stay on a cruise ship for the same amount of money, kept to myself and had all the meals and blue ocean and give looking for the same outcome!!  😂","

New day, looks like a pretty steep incline within the first few hours getting away from town.  My favorite!  Stopping at a deli/resupply store in about six miles.  Ordered a new pair of boots.  Not sure if the rocks did them in or they didn't last long sure to them being inexpensive.  Price wise, I probably got the same mileage out of them as anyone paying more and getting a few hundred more miles tho.  I get them off Amazon, so it's an easy purchase.  Wouldn't mind trying something with more cushion, but not ranting to make a change at this point... Unless I could get to an REI and have their warranty program for a year!
Mexican food last night was good!  Rapture ordered more than he could eat.  I've dropped a few pounds, but I don't think it's significant.  Scrapes on my legs don't seem to be healing very quickly.  Only mentioning this as I wonder if it has anything to do with nutrition.. Or lack thereof?  Nerve issues on the top of my feet seem to have resolved as well as the stitch in my right side.  
Rapture didn't have a good day.  Apparently didn't sleep well and HE complained about the humidity and incline when we finally connected at the deli.  Most of the hike felt like it was feel in the woods.  A bit cooler and mostly just hiking.  It seems no matter what the day consists of, by about 4pm I'm ready to call it a day.  I'm hoping to stay around 15 miles per day at least..

Left the Dennison group camp address about 630.  Rapture was up and moving early, which isn't his norm.  I knew we had a shelter at 10 and 20 miles today with rain coming late afternoon.  He made the decision to hike on without me.  I'm slowing him down and he can't do what he wants.  A bit annoying since it's a given he can do more miles than me with 1400 under his belt.  I'm guessing a more accurate issue would be that he didn't get laid within the week of knowing him.  Either way, it's always sad to lose a hiking companion.  I cried when Jarod hiked on after about five days of hiking/camping together on the John Muir trail three years ago.  We weren't romantically involved either, but it was nice having the company.  So after dealing with that, I found the telephone in the wind kiosk and started really crying!  But then I had to celebrate my 400 mile marker today!!  So that was an accomplishment that I'm happy about!  Rapture and I passed each other three times today (as he went to lunch and down to check out a lake while I kept hiking to get to the shelter before the rain) and are now at the same shelter.  He's with friends about 150 feet away and I'm tenting near the shelter that had for guys in it.  I know one from my stay at Moseys Place about a week ago.  Like the ups and downs of the trail, my emotions are following a trail of their own.  HYOH...

After getting in to the shelter the next morning, it continued to rain most of the day.  I finally ventured out and took my tent apart to try hanging it in various places to dry.  Friday was only about 46 degrees all day and very damp.  Later that day, Emerald and a few other hikers showed up.  Emerald settled next to me and after a minute, I realized Emerald was Erin, whom I hadn't seen in weeks!  One of the other hikers squeezed in for the night, but left early on Saturday.  The others kept hiking.
Spoon had tried to contact a boutique hotel in Pawling, but they weren't returning his calls.  It was going to be very expensive, but at this point, we needed to get out and get moving.  No one wanted to move without knowing we had shelter for the next night tho.
Thankfully, Brandi contacted me asking what I needed.  A new tent sent?  She found an Inn that the boutique place had mentioned, but somehow couldn't provide the number to and arranged for us to contact the guy and get a room.  Spoon, Emerald and I went for it.  Upon reaching a road, 2.6 miles from my resupply, we decided we were done and started trying to figure out a ride.  A small group of people were taking pictures at a large Oak and when the group left, one remaining guy pulled up and asked if we needed a ride!!  He took us to the Inn and asked if we needed a drive through or store run for food.  He was super nice and part of a church group showing children about nature.  The room was perfect for the three of us.  Mexican food within 1/4 mile, the separate beds/couch to sleep on... Perfect!  I found a trail angel on FB who will come get us, stop at a store and take us to Duncan Donuts before taking us back to the trail.  My spirits are restored!  I've ordered some tent maintenance stuff I'll get at the end of the week and see if I can waterproof the fly when in Salisbury, CT.  I've also contacted my tent company on the off chance they will warranty the fly.  New boots as well, as mine are leaking.  Hopefully I get these problems solved.  Wet gear is no fun, especially if it's going to rain for days on end!!!
Very thankful for the night spent with Spoon and Emerald chatting about ideas and experiences!
Woke up to a very nice Venmo deposit from Liz A!!  The generosity of people has been amazing and so helpful!  It's so interesting to go days without any expenses, then a hotel, shuttle, resupply, etc adds up so quickly.  Especially up here in the north.  Not many options, so a lot of resources are from general or convenience stores at ridiculous prices and very limited choices!!","

I got my packages and realized that I probably didn't have enough time to allow my seam seal to cure before wanting to pack it up again. I had received a text from Emerald with a 3-day hiking plan going into Great Barrington and sharing a room as a possibility and decided to do that rather than stay at Maria's. I made a trip to the post office to return some waterproofing and stopped at the store to get a few extra protein bars for the three days. Chatted with Maria a bit more then left and oddly enough connected with the three other hikers just outside of town. They decided to add another 2 mi to the day and Emerald realized she chose the wrong night to book the reservation.

Moisture, dampness, rain, humidity, etc are everyday words all of a sudden! I had to put clothes on that were wet this morning. It doesn't matter whether it rained on them, whether it was the sweat that didn't dry from yesterday or the dampness in the air, I had to put on wet clothes! My socks have been damp almost every day, but miraculously, once they are in my boots my feet are warm and I have yet to get a blister.
Spoons burn was pretty painful for him, but this morning he was able to put a sock on his foot and lace up his shoe so he is hiking forward to a road and hoping to get a ride to the hotel that he is sharing with No Bad tonight. Emerald and I are hiking about 9 mi to a shelter and then hiking about another 8 tomorrow to get roadside and hopefully find a ride to the same hotel.
The hike this morning was treacherous. Very steep and rocky descent with wet leaves and wet rocks. I slipped once, but thankfully didn't have far to fall. Other times I just sat down to get from one rock to the other however sometimes it's hard to sit down in the area provided when you have a big pack on your back! I found myself cussing quite a bit in my head at how dangerous it was and I was mad at ""them"" for not making it any easier on us! Then I had to scold myself when I thought of people doing this trail 20 and 30 years ago with no Guthook digital navigation nor AWOLs guide to fall back on. And I reeled my thoughts in!
We are inching our way forward towards the final three states, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine, which are known as the big three. Everything that we are enduring now is preparing us for those states and the terrain.

The good outweighs the bad.  I can certainly understand that this wouldn't be everyone's cup of tea for a summer vacation.... But it's a lifestyle for some of us and we stay with it because we'd rather have this situation than any other.  ","

Spoon stayed back in Great Barrington another day or so.  Guessing we may not see him again.   
It's hard to describe the various forest types we pass through.  Some remind me of Jurrasic park with huge ferns and greenery.  Today was very dense forest with brush and small trees really thick.  Other times the trees are far apart and there's a lot of dried leaves on the ground.  We also really through a lot of Meadows and pastures.   Today we went through a cow pasture with cows in it.  
The temps have been high... In the 90s.  It's tough to hike in that!  
My shoulders are taking a beating with this pack.  It doesn't fit properly.  I may look for an opportunity to try something different.
I did seam seal the tent, so I'm hoping that's fixed, but the overall material seems thin in that area.  It could be time for a new tent as well....","

We knew there would be rain later in the day and we were about a good 90 mins shy of making it to the shelter in time.  It rained pretty good with rumbling thunder throughout.  Maybe one flash of lightning.
Thankfully we were in a shelter that night.  I fell asleep shortly after getting there.

We arrived in Cheshire early afternoon.  Got ice cream and did some camp chores before walking to dinner.

Before heading out the next morning.... In the rain.  Ugh!!!  
Vermont mud became muddier.  Almost nothing you can do but trudge right through it.  
Had a nice sunset at the lake last night.  Got a tad cleaner in the pond before bed.
The actual hike this morning wasnt bad.  We had hoped to hitch, but there were three of us and two others, Trek Star and Gad About (who I met with Spoon back at Moseys several weeks ago) trying for rides so we called a shuttle.  Only could take four, so No Bad was going to keep trying to hitch.  He wound up with a ride before we could get settled in the shuttle!
He and Emerald went to the Outfitter in town.  I went to the grocery store and post office then called the hostel for my ride.  
Kitchen Sink, Four Lo and Kindle were already here having zereod today.  
Very nice place to lounge around, rest and get phone stuff taken care of.

I found out a restaurant overcharged me by about $35 May 30.  When hiking and not having signal and watching my battery, it's not like I'm checking my banking daily.  Manager wants to know what I ate and oddly i can't even pick it out off the menu... Not that I understand what that has to do with anything, find the damn receipt.  Anybody that knows me would second guess a restaurant receipt for $53 as I just don't spend that kind of money on myself.  So frustrating!!
Once again my bag is heavy.  I really don't like resupplies!

I feel like I've been so negative regarding the trail and the weather, but this has certainly been a week where the mental aspect has kicked in and kicked my butt. The tremendous amount of effort it has taken to get over multiple mountains, to see absolutely nothing due to the weather and knowing with each step I could end my hike due to the rain has really impacted me hard. I considered taking a couple of zero days to get my mind right and let the weather pass through however tomorrow is supposed to be a decent day so I will move on. I also considered a way to do my flip now and do some time in the south and then come back up and finish up but that's just more logistics, money and time that I would have to put into this hike and I'd really like to be home at the end of October or sooner. I'm very thankful to have not injured myself to a point that I need to lay up or go home But with each fall, I'm just one position away from that happening. A friend should be ordering my new tent tomorrow and I'm hoping to have it by the weekend or early next week. That will remove a lot of stress!All of what I've experienced so far isn't what I've expected from this hike. I'm thinking a lot has to do with me as I'm older than a lot of the people out here and also, as I'm doing right now I'm in a private room looking at my phone rather than being down with the youngsters watching a movie or talking. But a good hour or two of that time has been sent looking ahead trying to plan the next food resupply, hostile stay to get out of weather and determine two points for the possible tent delivery. I think I'll find less people on trail when I head south as flip-floppers and sobos are the smaller community.Going back to the hutts in the whites, each hut generally has soup and bread, baked goods coffee, tea and lemonade for sale.  Our dinner meal consisted of a salad and bread, a tomato bisque soup, pasta marinara and a fried chicken breast as well as a large size cream cheese filled brownie. Breakfast was oatmeal, eggs bacon and pancakes. The food definitely was very good and filling the only downside is the expense for staying in a bunk.When passing through the whites and stopping at campsites, they have a through hiker pass. At the first campsite you pay $10 and receive the pass and your overnight stay. Each additional campsite or shelter that you stay at then is $5 rather than 10 if you were just doing a section hike. A caretaker is at each place maintaining the privy. And there is also discounts on the card for the soup or baked goods as you're passing through the huts.Will be crossing over into Maine soon and I believe we have about 30 miles and 12,000 ft elevation in the next three days. Not big miles, but a lot of work getting up and over the mountains. I'm praying for clear skies and no rain. As of now I believe we expect to overnight in bethel Maine Thursday and it's calling for rain Thursday and Friday.I woke up to find a very generous donation in my Venmo account this morning! Thank you Liz k for your kindness! It certainly comes in handy as I know I will be taking more breaks, more so for my mental health than my physical! :-)","

Feral,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640588,"So I'm taking a lunch needed day if the trail today.  The last few weeks going through the Whites, presidentals, Careers, Wildcats, etc have been grueling.  Incredible trail with so many technical obstacles.  I wish I could have pictured all the different things along the path that we had to find a way over and around... But the pictures don't show the difficulty of passage.  The rain every day has had but only impacted the severity of the trail, but also has put me in a funk.  I've been hiking in fear for two weeks and it hasn't been fun.  I've fallen more times in two weeks than I have in several years.  I just got a text from Emerald.  I haven't seen her since she took a few days off to visit with her husband.  She took a bad fall yesterday coming down a rock scramble just before Full Goose shelter where I stayed two nights ago.  She's not broken, but in a lot of pain and not in a good head space.  She is taking a few days off to assess whether she feels she is done or can continue.  It's very hard to hike and enjoy your adventure when each step you are afraid of serious injury.  I haven't hiked with a clear head in days.  Anybody that knows me, knows I hate sitting someone just acruing charges, but thankfully it's an inexpensive place and they serve breakfast and dinner for nominal amounts.  Bless my friend Brandi, who wound up staying at my house due to a mix up regarding staying at another friends condo for the holiday week... But find out immediately that did weren't allowed.  She reached out to me and Brittany have her my house for several days.  While there I got a report that Coco is doing great and that she had turned herself in to an outside dog!!  She has free access to go in and out and sisterly she is staying out executive to come in for a treat, her meds and food.  She was it during fireworks and just laid in her various holes, relaxing!  Maybe she knows I'm sleeping outside and wants to be bonded with me!  ❤️❤️Back to Brandi.... Amazon can't get my boots to be for a month.. But I had a state pair at home so Brandi sent them two day guaranteed shipping to this hostel. They were supposed to be here yesterday... They didn't make it!  Hurtfully Brandi gets her money back guarantee and I get them today.  She also sent pants... Which I desperately need as I split the whole back end of of my black ones.Also, big thanks to Eric for ordering my tent from Big Agnes.  I ""should"" get that at a hostel next  Thursday shit 75 miles from here.  I don't be putting in big miles as I'm trying to hit the hostel in time to get the tent... And hopefully it makes it on time!  Two moving targets can be hard to connect.I think this area could be beautiful with clear weather.  Also, as a day hiker with far less weight on their backs and knowing they get to go back to a cabin, hotel, etc for the night may make some of this hiking easier to manage.  Also, you can choose your trails or loops to make the mileage more manageable.  I never actually knew that the AT was considered such a hard trail compared to the other national scenic trails.  A friend just injured himself on the CDT and is headed home early.  I'm glad I decided to give this a try and at this point, barring any unforeseen problems, my I will finish.  The hardest part, aside from Katahdin is almost over and I'm strong enough to put in some good days headed south.  The dilemma there will be whether I put in long days with higher miles because it will be easier or to say a shower piece and breathe it in.  I've felt pushed due to either trying too stay with other hikers or needing a shelter due to my tent issues.  Having the ability to stop at any point, knowing I have good shelter, will allow many more choices for how long or short my days will be. I've been in context with since friends in the last day and raise how much I miss my friends that I have relationships with, versus people I've only known a few weeks or a month.  Hike your own hike and you be you are very overblown out here.  Heaven forbid you rent to circulate with someone.  Having a hiking partner is a false sense of security as at some point they'll remind you we are all out here ""hiking our own hike"".  So I believe solo it will be from here on.  It was so good chatting with Brandi, Dawn and soon to talk with Eddie and then with Cathy to start formulating my pick up once I summit Katahdin.  There's so much to do with being off from the trail that even then sometimes we don't get a chance to catch up with everyone we'd like to or their time didn't match with ours.  I've been blessed with another large donation a few days ago.  It still amazes me where some of these sunstone are coming from!  I had no idea I'd receive help from so many.  I'm also humbled by the people that have reached out to tell me how much they've enjoyed the pictures, the stories, etc.  If anyone has questions, is be happy to answer or give my opinion on things.  I haven't kept track of each mountain I've gone over as some hikers have.  I just go up and then down while some say we are hitting Bemis tomorrow, were hitting the Saddleback's next, the Bigelow's in a few weeks, etc. I've just been hiking...Love you all and thanks for being here with me!","

But as soon as I see an incline or descent with rocks, I get really nervous and upset.  I met a woman named Marmot who is back on trail to finish her 2018 hike.  She was the 13th Triple Crowner.  Meaning she hiked the AT, The PCT and the CDT and was the 13th person ever to do so.  I also met a man who said he was Greg N Wild.  I thought that an odd trail babe till he clarified.... He is the real guy that met Cheryl Strayed on trail, who wrote the book Wild (the movie started Reese Witherspoon).  In the book and movie his characters name is Greg.  So not Greg N Wild... Greg IN Wild.  Pretty cool!  Sobos are saying NOBOs are angry and cranky.  I find that abusing because I'm one of them and can't hardly argue that description!!  Poor GA hikers have come a long way and this is the toughest part of the trail and it's rained a lot.  The views they were looking forward to have been minimal.  I passed Sugarloaf view today, socked in, yet twenty minutes later saw blue sky.  I've been dressing sleeping in the Hexamid tonight as we were supposed to get thunderstorms.  Thank God for a light rain as I may get to stay dry tonight.  I'm sleeping in my rain jacket and not getting out my down quilt for fear of things getting wet.  I've got my pack cover on my pack and it's in this single person tent with me.  Hopefully I'll just stay curled up.  I'm alone at this camp site.  I don't necessarily like that.  I have a reservation tomorrow at the Hostel of Maine and will get my new tent.  I asked for a bunk tonight, but would have had to walk an extra three miles off trail today to get there and walk it back out.. Or pay $55 for a shuttle.  After making the reservation then hitting the next incline I called back and said I didn't have the strength to get there.  Tomorrow I'll go 7.3 miles of trail to the road and hitch in.  The incline today was almost 4500 up and the same down.  I'm surprised I got in 14.2 miles.  Tomorrow I go over the Crockers.  I hope I stop crying while hiking.  I get so beat down and worn out...

It's still way too small of a tent for me overall.  Got a good sleep, woke up about 540 and was on trail about 630.  Made it about 100 yards before hitting my first 700 foot incline over .4 miles.  I had no energy.  Then I hit another incline and started thinking I'd never make it anywhere today. . It dawned on me, I may not be eating enough.  Once I started thinking about it, I bet I'm consuming about 1500 calories and burning about 6000.  I'll try to eat more, but I can only carry so much.Once I got the climbs out of the way I actually got to hike with a fair amount of picking over rocks... But at least it resembled walking to a degree!  I met about five people headed south.  A few thru hikers and a few section hikers.I got to the road and someone jumped out of their car and often me a drink and a ride.  I found it the hostel was one direction and the list office was in another town, in the other direction.  He took me to the PO then the hostel.  He's the chief of police and is a trail angel in his free time!  Something has been in my sucks the last two days buying my feet. .I have about ten sores that will have to be trapped to continue hiking.  Chiggers?  I've had no other foot problems.I I've had a shower, my laundry is done, i resupplied at Dollar general, ate a burrito from Rolling Fatties . Life is good.  There are two shuttles tomorrow.  I think I'm taking the 930 instead of the 730 you extend my break!  I'll have to climb tomorrow and I believe the next day, so I want to be ready. I'll be in Caratunk in about three to four days and will do another hostel.  I hope I can keep a good outlook.  It's been difficult.  Hostel stays help!!","

The next day, they were doing 17.9 to get themselves back on schedule.  That sounded like a good idea, so I did that as well, leaving the shelter around 545. Thank God the Bigelow's were behind me by mid day and I got to do some regular hiking!  It was a pretty long day tho. 
Got to the shelter about 430, got water from the pond, made dinner and crawled in bed.  Several other hikers came in.
Left the shelter today at 515 with 14 miles to the Kennebec River.  There is a canoe that shuttles you across.  Hikers used to ford it, but it is dam controlled and very dangerous.  The canoe runs from 9-2 and I got there about 11.  I then found out the hostel I read going to stop in to was closed and the other one was full.  Not a good feeling after hiking in the rain for almost 7 hours.  I got shuttled to Sterling Inn and was going to hang out for a bit to decide what to do.  So glad that I ran in to Denim Dan as he allowed me to share his room!!  I did but want to go to the next place and tent camp!!
Got a shower, my laundry done and went to a brewery for lunch.  Do glad to be warm and dry, or of the rain.
Also very thankful for two more donations!!  One from Jo whom I met on trail several weeks ago and one from Kenny!!  I definitely will be putting these to good use, keeping my spirits up and my belly full!!  Can't recall if I mentioned it, but Carole, a friend of a friend that passed last year, reached out to me with a donation and said that Patty is watching over me.  I certainly hope so!  She was a ray of sunshine  and very well liked.  If she's watching over me, I'm in good hands!!","

The trail was quite a bit easier thank what we were used to, so we got to camp by mid or early afternoon each day.  We didn't have reservations in Monson until Wed, so there was no point in pushing more miles.  The first night out, it rained on the middle of the night.  The last morning of hiking, it rained all day.  I was so thankful to be done by 10am!!..Something to note.... I'm telling/sharing with people MY thoughts, opinions and experiences on trail.  Someone a day behind or a day ahead may not be getting the same weather that I am.  A younger person may not have minded all the climbing and sketchy descents that scared the crap out of me.  So many variables for each hiker to have a different experience than those around him.  I write how I feel... Not for pity or kudos, but to give  my honest perspective at any given time.So, interesting that Sunday I had to cross a river in a canoe and yesterday I had to ford my first water crossing.  It was a short 20-30 foot wide crossing that was up to our thighs.  Not hard at all... No slippery rocks, etc.  I have a plan for the wilderness and my summit.  As best as can be planned.  Im thinking 7 days through the wilderness, a night at Abol Pines, a night at the Birches, then summit on July 31 and hitch to Millinocket.  Cathy will meet me in Millinocket and take me back to Chambersburg, PA for a few days ready and food, then take me to Harpers Ferry for the rest of my hike.  ","

Feral,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641708,"Whew.. Where to begin after not journaling for so long!!
Leaving Shaws I felt pretty good about the tentative plan I had with Bread and Cathy for connecting with them in Baxter.  I couldn't give them a definite date, I didn't know if I'd get my name on the list of 12 to be allowed to camp at the Birches in Baxter, I didn't know what the weather was going to be and if I could summit the day I had picked... All this knowing is have little to no signal through the 100 Mile Wilderness and nothing at Abol Bridge into Baxter!  
My first day on the wilderness, u did 15.1 miles.  I heard a rattler on a ledge, was warned about a cat (Lynx) guarding it's cub and had to ford a river.  I made it to the shelter I wanted tho!  
The next day I decided to do double my original plan and hike 20.8 over the Chairbacks due to weather the next day.  It was a grind!  Nothing like the scrambling and bouldering that I had to do with the Whites, Presidentals, etc but stumbling, tripping inclines with tons of roots and rocks.  The next day I realized I could go short and did about 10.8.  Short day but still tough with a few mountains to cross..I believe I crossed White Cap on this day.  Very windy, coldn and socked in... Pretty similar to most of my mountain crossings!
The next several days leveled out a fair amount.  The hikes were 19.5, 18.2, 11.5 and 3.6 to get us in to Abol Pines early on Thursday morning as we heard they served breakfast!  A lot of people say the wilderness is beautiful and it certainly had beauty with lakes and a roaring river, but you did a lot of time picking over did while hiking which is very tedious.  A lot of hikers get mentally fatigued paying so much attention to their foot placement and I personally found it difficult to enjoy the scenery while knowing I had limited food supplies to get through such a remote section.  I carried for days of food into the wilderness and scheduled a food drop halfway with another four days of food.  But I also had to spend a night at Abol Pines and the Birches before finishing.  So... We did get to the store/restaurant for breakfast.  Due to staffing issue, they only offered breakfast.  It was a buffet for $11.  Music to a hikers ears!!!  Until you got in and realized buffet many three hot bins and various bread products.  Fake eggs, biscuits and gravy in the bins.  English muffins and bagels and pastries in cellophane.  Ugh!  But the best, but about eighty if us tried to get our $11 worth!We grabbed some snacks from the over priced limited store and headed across the street to Abol Pines.  Thankfully a guys father was coming to visit and brought food to share with his friends.  I wasnt really part of the group, but they offered to meet me dig in!  I may dinner full time banners traveling with their dog.  They'd been out for 2.5 years.  They'd fine the beet harvest in the northwest, started in Quartzite in the winter and give to the R2R festivals with Bob Wells of Cheap RV Living YouTube channel.  So cool!!I had connected with Brad and Cathy from a ledge before getting to Abol Bridge to confirm Saturday as a summit day and my route plan, but I couldn't confirm is make it in time to get my name on the list of 12 that are showed to stay at the Birches.  Without being at the Birches, one has to either stay at Abol Pines or get a shuttle to Millinocket, stay the night and get shuttled back in to summit.  On Friday, I got up at 5 and hiked the .08 you the kiosk for the sign up and was the first on the list for the Birches.  I continued hiking the 9.5 in to Baxter, checked in with the ranger and went to the Birches shelter.  I was there by 10am so it made for a long day.  Baxter has no electricity, signal, water, etc.  I rained most of the morning hike and a free times in the afternoon, so I just stayed in the shelter, contemplating my summit.  Saturday, summit day, I left my backpack at the ranger station, took a day pack and hit the trail at 645.  The climb was tough, but not near as involved add I thought it would be... Either that or after all I'd been through, I was trained and prepared!!  The further up I went, the more windy it got, cooler and cloudy.  I couldn't see 50 feet in front of me.  The first 1.5 was a gradual hike incline and the last 1-2 were flat and rocky... So the actual bouldering and scrambling was about 2.5 miles.  The temp with wind chill was probably in the low 40s, I was wet due to the cloud mist so the time didn't say the top was pretty miserable.  I submitted about 945.  I quickly got my picture are a snack and started my descent.  Several people were still coming up.  During my descent, occasional breaks in the clouds presented beautiful views.  I had no idea what I'd been hiking through or what surrounded me on the way up.  It was hard to say whether those later had chat skies and there seemed to be a cloud shelf that kept the top socked in.. But I'm guessing they had better views and maybe a bit warmer summit than I did.  I'm surprised that I found the whole thing less scary than what it was built up to be.  Again, not sure if it wasn't really that bad or that I'd already been through worse!  As I came out of the woods, Brad and Cathy were sitting there waiting for me.  *I had been able to text them from the top to tell them of a descent change after speaking with the ranger the day before.","

Bunk, linens, towel, shower, soap, loaner clothes, wifi.These items may be included or may be extra....  Laundry, breakfast, dinner.  Shuttle to/from the trailhead, shuttle in to ""town""...They may or may not have a kitchen a hiker can use.  Some have Resupply options on site... Full or limited.  Some allow you to walk in with your boots and pack... These generally aren't hear as homey or clean as the ones that are a bit more strict and ask you to take your boots and socks off outside and leave the pack in a separate area.  While it's obviously nice to find the ones for less that offer the most amenities, any place out of the woods after a week is appreciated!!  It's very easy to take a ""zero"" in the clean, homey ones!!Sometimes you can ""work for stay"" and they'll allow you to do some small jobs for the cost of your bunk.  I did this at The Cabin in Andover when I had to wait for a package for three nights.  Bunks were $20, breakfast $8 and dinner $12, and small charge per shuttle depending on number of riders.  And there wasn't anything around, so meals were that or from your pack.  I did some minimal work and got two nights reduced.  I only ate one day of breakfast and dinner (probably not the smartest decision there).  It can be fun to connect with other hikers at hostels.  I haven't had a problem with anyone I've met at one so far.  Bunk rooms are like staying in a shelter.  Generally coed and you deal with the snorers, the early risers, and anything else you can imagine from group dynamics.Hostels in the south are generally closer to the trail.  I can easily stop in, charge my phone, rest, maybe eat a frozen pizza and get back on trail.  But we'll see....

Or... Continuing hiking to get to a tent site and cabin with a spigot.  I'll have to check the additional mileage to the tent site, but I'll be adding a mile just to get to and from the stream at the shelter anyway.  I'm hoping water isn't going to be a daily problem in this heat!!  I may have mentioned before, I hope to add a side gig helping people declutter once back home.  It's not just about taking stuff out of your house, it's the whole mentality of living with less and being comfortable with empty space.  For now, I just need to think about the next 1000 miles, one step at a time tho!","

Feral,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642045,"I certainly didn't expect to still be at Brad and Cathy's!  However, I decided to get a zpack backpack from Kenny and am having to wait for a larger waist band to be delivered.  The pack is super light and seems to fit well, like it's literally a turtle shell on my back that lives where I do.  My other pack may have been too short, but maybe also too big, as when I leaned to the side it would slide a bit,  even at the tightest adjustment.  I also learned that my shoulders, near the scapulas have chronic muscle strain, probably from wearing my pack for three months with an ill fit.  I walked the other day and noticed a strain just having my arms hang down!  So in the next few days, I'm rolling on a tennis ball and stretching, trying to get rid of that before carrying a weighted pack again.I've been watching some trail movies.  While A Walk in the Woods was labeled under comedy and was entertaining, a lot read missing from it.  But it shows a lot of people do the trail for a sense of accomplishment, adventure and challenge.  Meanwhile, in Wild, the character did the trail for healing.  To get away and go within.  I'd have to say, I'm doing it for all of the above.  I'm feeling revelations and about life and myself.  I want to be a better person.  I want to live with intention and comfortable with my choices, in a world where I can see my choices are considered alternative.  Heaven forbid as a woman I don't have twenty purses and 30 pairs of shoes.  I don't have my house set up with show room style.  I'd rather be in a flannel shirt, jeans and boots than high heels and a dress.  (Clothes have no gender)!!  The movie from last night, Barbarian Utopia brought tears to my eyes and returned me to a happy state for being part of this community and on trail.  I'd lost that mentality for a month or so in NH and southern Maine.  But the interviews of the hikers consistently talked about the kindness of others whole on trail and that e don't see this hear as often in ""real life"".  Why is that?  On trail, people see a thru hiker and immediately start checking their packs for an extra protein bar or bottle of water.  In some places, you don't even have to hitch.  People see you with a pack sitting in a parking lot and ask if you need a ride.  Obviously, not ALL the time and not ALL people, but far more near a trail than normal settings.  I've been the recipient of so much help while out here!!  It's been amazing!  The months before leaving I offered to help declutter neighbors houses or hello with anything that they needed assistance with that I could do.  No one took me up on it.  I was serious.  I would like to live in a community where we help our neighbors.  I know I need extra hands or know how now and then...I despise having to call a handyman for a relatively simple task.  What can I do to help someone that would make it worth their time to help me (depends on the task obviously... But you get my point).  Will I wind up in a commune or intentional living society of van people to find this?  I should be heading out to trail Tuesday.  Water sources are scarce. That's concerning!  I could leave some cold weather clothing and my quilt behind... But I'm concerned that due to sleeping cold, I'd actually still use it!  What I have doesn't get me much below 45 degrees and if probably wear/use it in 60 degrees.  But I may need to shave off more weight to carry more water.  Decisions!!  ","

Right?  But me being me, I'm scared.  I'm scared of being alone for days on a trail with very few people on it (except on weekends, then I'll complain about all the day hikers), I'm concerned about the shortage of water, I'm concerned about leaving behind cooler weather clothes and my down quilt.  What else can i worry about!?  I do not do this with the ease that some people think I do, which is why I love the meme, ""if you can't get over the fear, you'll have to do it afraid"".  That pretty much sums it up!  I was hoping I would gain confidence coming out and doing the trail so that I didn't have to go through the worry process... But it seems to be a part of the process that I'll have go through to get to the next step.  The things I was hoping to learn and grow from out here haven't happened yet.  I can talk the talk, which I was always able to do, but having patience, flexibility and not worry don't seem to be in my wheel house and I'm stubbornly hanging on to my traits!  (The first step is admitting your problem)!!😂😂.   So I'm not beating myself up too much, at least I can acknowledge that I showed up, I'm here and I'm gonna do it.  Jo contacted me and hopes to come to Shenandoah early next week for a day.  If that pans out, she can bring some of my extra food I'm leaving at Cathy's.  The park will have plenty of waysides to grab a burger, ice cream or other town type food along the way.  I'm anxious to see how I do with this pack.  I don't really think I can judge the pack as long as I have shoulder tension tho so I may have to get home and do physical therapy (or something) then try it again.  I'm hoping the little bit of stretching and rolling on a tennis ball along with ibuprofen released some of it tho.So...1026.1 to go!  I'll hot my 1200 mark in about 33 miles.  I have a few people that have mentioned coming out to see me along the way.  I think knowing I have more friends in the southern half will get me through...

Feral,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642336,"I left Harpers Ferry on Tuesday afternoon, August 10 at about 2pm.  It was hot as hades and the first mile or so had a lot of uphill.  I seriously thought I'd have to call Cathy and have her come back and get me.  It was also pretty rocky....I thought I was done with them!!  After a few hours, the thunder started, then the rain, which turned into a down pour, high winds and some lightning.  I was walking in about three inches of water on the trail.  Hiking alone in a storm is scary.  Or doesn't make it any day to be hiking with someone, but at least you have someone to be scared with and scream and try to laugh as the thunder booms around you.  It passed and I continued hiking till about 6pm.  I stayed at the David Lesser shelter about 9 miles in by myself.  It was a nice shelter with a great porch. 
I started day two about 7 and planned to go just over 15 miles.  About mid afternoon, the rain came in.  I made it to the shelter and there were two men there.  I was thankful for the company.  Two more hikers came in and I knew one from my northern hike.  I'd met her in the first week, I believe.  I hoping to meet up with her for overnights but she was pushing bigger miles to get off trail for a weekend with family.
We have bear poles at the shelters in VA.  Tall posts with hooks at the top and a long rod with a hook on the end, chained to the post that you push your bag up and hook it to the hooks on the tall post.  I had no problem with this at the first shelter.  I put my food up at this shelter and couldn't get it back down the next morning. How long would it have taken me to get my food down had others not been there!!?  And should I continue using the poles?  What in the heck do I do if I can't get the food down!!?
I set off to go another 15 miles.  Again, temps over 100.  I dehydrated myself by the time i got to the shelter.  I had been walking in open fields directly in the sun for a bit and realized I wasn't sweating or peeing.  My ab muscles started cramping.  After rehydrating, I continued to the next shelter another 4.4 away.  Again, was alone.
The terrain in VA is much easier than up north.... However when people say VA is flat, that's not true.  I had to climb 4200 feet of elevation on Thurs.  There are some very easy walking portions of the trail, but there are also rock gardens and elevation change.  Most are somewhat gradual but continue for awhile so they still can drain your energy.
Friday I decided to stop at a Hostel to look at my map and make a schedule to meet Jo and Liz in the Shenandoahs.  I called the hostel in the morning thinking I may decide to spend the night... And found out they closed this week.  Ugh!!  But they did let me come by and get cooled off, charge my phone and eat a pizza.  Just as I decided to start hiking again, the thunder started and i saw a bolt of lightning up on the mountain.  That was it, I called another hostel and am staying the night at Stumble Inn.  Looks like I'm going to zero tomorrow.  The whole week has rain and storms every day.  The temps are lower and this means maybe we'll have better water sources... But I'm not overly anxious to go out hiking in a storm.  I saw way too many new trees down the last few days from the other storms, I definitely don't want to be under one of them!
I just have to get it through my head that if I don't want to hike,  I don't have to.  It's hard to outrun a storm when you've got any significant number of miles left to go and it starts thundering.  
It would be really nice to be able to get up and just hike without having to worry about so much.  I guess the bottom line is I'm not supposed to be worrying.  I'm not learning my trail lessons very quickly!!","

And while I feel lonely, I think it's more that I'm not ""connected"" to anyone.  It is comforting knowing that I'll see someone reach evening at a particular shelter or camp site or that we will connect at a parking to try to hitch together or share a shuttle.  I know I'm capable, but it gets tiring being strong and confident.  It would be nice to just KNOW that things will fall into place and work out.  I also think this is more a personal problem than a real problem!!  Trail lesson maybe!??I encourage anyone that wants to do a little backpacking out even done day hiking to visit the Shenandoahs.  The AT is pretty well groomed pretty easy to hike.  There are areas with definite elevation change, but I'm sure you could talk to a ranger and figure out the loop or trail best suited for your level of fitness.  The rooms at the Big Meadows lodge are fairly primitive.  No TV, no heating, AC, microwave, fridge... But comfortable.  And the campground look well kept.  Showers are only at the camp store area and are fee based.I've met some Sobo hikers here at the hostel and am hoping to chat with one of them about hiking together... Which again, didn't always mean within eye sight of one another, but just knowing you'll connect that evening at a particular location.   I'm feeling good today, physically and mentally.  I'm hoping I can bring myself to this place when I start slipping again.  Last weekend I was ridiculous!!  I think remembering everything is temporary is key.Looking forward to meeting up with Liz and Janet this afternoon and going to dinner then a good night's sleep inside before setting out tomorrow for the next 50-60 miles of trail.","

I told Nav the night they came to the shelter so late and i was in my tent, I think I had a dream that someone with a headlamp came to my tent much later and said we're in the shelter.  He said that was Grizz!  Grizz woke up and couldn't find Cricket.  He woke the guys up, worried she ran off.  He found her laying outside of my tent which was about 75 feet up the path from the shelter.  She knew when they came in that I was in there and came up to lay by me.  I wish I would have known she was there, I would have let her in!!  What a sweetheart!!
I got up on Tuesday morning and hiked the 11.2 in to Daleville and waited at the BP for Liz.  As I was sitting there, I saw Captain walking down the highway.  He had a room at the Super 8 and was waiting on Nav.  Grizz couldn't get a room with Cricket, so the people they hitched with took him in for the night a bit further down the trail.  I'm not sure if anyone is hiking today in the rain.  
I met with Liz and she took me to Cracker Barrel. Yum!!  As we were sitting there she pulls up a picture that i had taken and posted on fb.  She asked me what I saw.  It was the sun filtering through the trees... But when I looked at it, I saw an angel.  She said that's what she immediately saw and that my Mom was with me.  I told her I was walking in the opposite direction and for some reason, turned around and saw the sun streaming through and took the picture.  I have been repeating the phrase I put on the fridge in magnets at Shaws... Angel Mother, heal and watch over me.  ❤️

Feral,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643805,"What a great place to take a zero.  They are getting me out by allowing me to use some trail magic money to pay for my stay and meals for yesterday and I will do some easy work to pay for most of all of today's stay.
I woke up feeling better.  It rained last night into this morning, so everything is wet.  Good day not to have to hike!  I'm finding I'm more of a fair weather hiker at this point and don't have much patience for being miserable.  There's enough misery on trail without adding to it!  
I'm envious of the orle that don't seem to care if they are around others.  I tried to connect with Barbie several weeks ago, but she didn't appear interested.  Yet I've just heard she and Blue, I guy I met up north, just got into Pearisburg.  Maybe their connection was random and I'm trying to hard to make a connection with someone to hike around?  I am craving connection while on trail and not getting as much as I'd like.  
Nav hiked here from Angels Rest yesterday.  Grizz and Capt and shuttling to the TH to hike with him today.  
I've found one thing I really enjoy about being at a hostel is not only bring clean, but wearing loaner clothes!!  And seeing what some of the hostel help is wearing.  It's a very hippie ish community and what you wear doesn't seem to matter.  It covers you.  If it's got a hole or a stain, it's not a big deal, it's still functional.  There's something about this that appeals to me!!  I'm tired of being ruled by consumerism/retailism.  The amount of clothing I truly need is small.  The less I work and the less I socialize, there is a less of a concern for looking the part.  I don't feel I've ever been a diva, but I think my true nature is grunge!!  That's not exactly conducive to the area I live in.  They would associate that with being poor.
I see that what I want out here on trail is similar to what I think I want in life.  A connection with someone.  Yet, I haven't found anyone (not looking either) that seems to be where I am in this stage of my life.  Not everyone wants to live in a camper or minimilize their life.  I also don't want to be confined or limited.. And maybe that's what I'm seeing on trail.  When something doesn't suit someone they just move on.  I, on the other hand, feel like I'd make certain compromises to stay near someone to satisfy my need/want.  To what degree, I'm not sure.  But I'm not finding joy in a solo hike and I feel that if I were with someone and we wanted to separate yet stay together, knowing we had a plan to reconnect would really help me.  Now I say goodbye to people and I'm just alone.  I'm sure if you are reading this on the daily, it seems to be my neverending theme.  But I think it's been my life and now it's my trail life.  I just said goodbye to Nav, and I'm crying.  I feel left behind.  
I have little patience left for unmanaged trail and overgrowth.  I have little patience left for tough climbs.  Inclement weather.  I just want to walk home and be done.  And, as I hear happens often, I'll then be wishing to be back on trail.... ","

Feral,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643840,"After many tears yesterday, I made a plan.  I'm working on being happy with it, but it hits a lot of check lists and seems to be the best way to move forward.  
I could lie about this or not mention it, but for the sake of honesty, I will tell those reading my journal that I am skipping ahead 15.9 miles by car and taking a zero again.  I personally don't approve of skipping parts of the trail and calling it a thru, however, I've talked to many people and they all have their personal opinion on what a thru means to them.  
There are those that will walk past every, and I mean every white blaze, and anything less isn't a thru.  The are those that will yellow blaze (shuttle ahead), blue blaze (take a shorter side trail), aqua blaze (kayak the Shenandoah river) and as long as they hit Springer and Katahdin, they thru hiked.  My belief is feet on the AT for MOST of the trail....
My reasons for skipping this section are...
It allows be another zero 
It gets me to where I'm supposed to be at the end of the day 
It provides me with an easy water carry and help through an 18 mile dry section and a resupply at the end of it from a friend's car 
It keeps me close to the guys that moved ahead yesterday 
Pink Crocs, whom I met up north, is coming to hike a few days with me.  She will pick me up here and will drive to the next hostel, West Feet, and spend the night.  Tomorrow she'll take her car to a lot where we will pass by on Sunday am.  I'll pick up my extra food and electronic bag from her car and will hike a bit further south before she'll need to turn around and go back to her car and head home.  I'll have 33 miles from her car to the next hostel then about 11 to the next.  During that time I can assess things.  
Kenny had insisted that if I finish this hike, he will personally get me back up here before my twelve months is up for me to complete the 15.9 mile section.  I have decided that I am good either way as I will finish this hike with less than 1% of missed trail.  I think my OCD and conscience can handle even 2% without beating myself up too bad!!  
I've had a few people tell me that not continuing my hike doesn't have to be a negative.  I hate even thinking that way... But is finishing in pain the way to go?  Will I get more accolades for walking 600 miles while hurting?  Have I hiked enough to open my eyes to the things I came out here to understand about myself?  I know one thing...I will not attempt this again.  I either finish it out I get to where I get and maybe section the rest, but bless those that decide to start over!!  The AT is a hard trail.  I feel I've seen very few rewards for the work I've put in.  The views that are few and far between have been compromised by weather and smoke.  
I do know being it here had reinforced the direction I'm taking in life.  I'd rather be comfortable in my clothes than wear what society tells me I should to fit in.  If those clothes on shy given day make me look more like a tom boy or masc lesbian, then so be it.  Clothing has no gender.
I want to buy better produce and make things from home, have a pantry of things I've put up....  That all sounds good until the actual work starts!!  I want to eat what I need to fuel my body and not be the glutton I haven't been.  
So this is what being out here is reinforcing in me.  Maybe when I get home that'll change again... But my needs/wants are very different than what most want.  I think I'd be good in a hippie commune (for awhile... Maybe not forever).  
So this blog is definitely more for me thinking through things.... Maybe not the mile by mile description of the trail or surrounding area.  I can't remember a lot of the trail itself.  Hikers ask about certain areas... How's the water, how's the terrain in this area or that.  I just passed there two days ago and can't tell them!!  I walk in a fog of thoughts.  Still no music or podcasts.  That may help if I listened to something other than myself!!  😂😂I've also just realized something from playing Suduko that I've always known.. But maybe needed the reminder... And to have it displayed to me visually through this game.  When playing Suduko, I look at all the squares in a certain way to start putting numbers in.  After I start getting several numbers in, but can't see what the squares need, my attention shifts to what the rows and columns need, and I can usually see where to put more numbers.  Obviously to look at both at the same time might speed up the process, but the idea that things need to be looked at from so many different views in order to complete the project is so simple yet interesting because it's not always an automatic.  Sometimes I get stuck on the one view and can't get beyond what looks like a dead end.  Once that view shifts, doors/squares present themselves to move forward.  The knowledge of this has always been there... But it was interesting to literally see this happen with this game...","

Feral,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643950,"Well.... This isn't the way this journey was supposed to go.  I'm off trail at Pink Crocs house.  She came out to hike with me this weekend.  I managed 15.9 miles on Saturday with about 20 lbs in my pack, but had varying levels of discomfort all day, ranging from 3-7.  Falling asleep was more difficult than other nights due to discomfort and hiking the mile out this morning was difficult.
So, I'm going to head home at the end of the week.  Muscle relaxers, steroids and ibuprofen are not getting rid of the pain.  I cried a lot yesterday.  I'm hoping maybe some physical therapy will help and I can go back out for a few weeks in Oct then pick up a few weeks next spring before my year deadline hits.  
I realize dealing with an injury isn't failing or quitting.... But I haven't achieved my goal, so I wouldn't call it a success.  ","

Feral,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644104,"I've been asked if I have plans for my homecoming/return to trail.  I don't.  I have no idea what I'm dealing with nor do I know how I feel about trying to squeeze in another few hundred miles this fall.  
On the positive, I'm glad it was an injury that is bringing me home and that I didn't just give up due to being lonely, etc.  I also had told myself before starting the trail, that at least I was putting in miles that I'd never done before.  The whole northern section from Harpers Ferry to Katahdin were new to me, as well as from Harpers Ferry to where I stopped (ironically).  I've already hiked 195 miles from Bland, VA to 19e in TN.  I've also hiked the approach trail to Stecoah Gap, which is about 155 miles.  I wasnt counting those miles already hiked as I wanted this to be a thru hike, (all miles done within a 12 month period).  I'm not sure how I feel yet about this being a section hike.  Once my body heals, and I see what kind of time I have left and what the weather is like, I can think about how I want this hike categorized and what I need to do.  
I haven't felt post trail depression yet.  I don't have any great longing to be back out there.  I feel more anxious about getting home and getting my life squared away.  Time will tell....","
