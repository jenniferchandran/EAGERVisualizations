Flex,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633993,"On April 11th, 2018, my wife Curly and I set out on one of the most life changing adventures imaginable. On that day we headed north from Springer Mountain with the intention of hiking all 2,190.9 miles of the AT.  It was a glorious and wonderful 142 days on  trail.  Alas, we did not make it to Katahdin.  On day 142, we descended down the Valley View Trail from Mount Madison and called the hike finished.  You can read our story by checking out our Trail Journals from 2018 if you desire.  I can't write about it because it brings back so much regret and disappointment.
Since that time, much has taken place, and our commitment to finishing the trail has never wavered.  We did go back in 2019 and picked up where we left off, but got off in Pinkham Notch because I blew both of my knees out (Patella Tendonitis).  Fast forward almost 2 years from then and we are now making preparations to head back north and finish what we started.  We are excited and plan on approaching this hike a lot differently than the first one.  Even though we only have 300 miles left to hike, we are going to savor and relish those miles.  We don't have a time limit on finishing, so we just going to take it one day at a time.  Savoring the miles and taking each day individually are two things I didn't do a very good job of last time.  Not this time.
We have lots of hiking planned between now and June 9th, all of which we will share.  Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy this journey as much as we hope to!

Flex,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633994,"It doesn't matter if you day hike, section hike, thru hike, or something in between.  If you hike, you understand how powerful and life transforming hiking is.  Hiking changes our perspectives, it whittles life down to the basic necessities, it challenges our preconceived notions about life and people, and so much more.  And no matter how well you think you know people, how well you have figured out the human race, the trail will teach you new lessons about humanity.
The absolute hardest part about leaving the trail in 2018 was leaving the people.  The friends we made then are still friends today, three years later.  Phone calls, texts, sharing pictures and life events, reunions (Trail Days 2019).  Once you make a friend on the trail, they are friends for life.  But its not just the people you meet on the trail that are so special, it is also the friends who support you on your quest.
Curly and I hike the Art Loeb Trail up to Cold Mountain last weekend.  We went with Wobbles (who will be hiking SOBO this year), Dr. Cheezit, Fire Girl, and Wendy.  Funny thing but each of those amazing people in that picture made it possible for Curly and I to go on our hike.  Wobbles lived in our home and watched out for Curly's mom who lives with us.  Wendy generously sprung for a night in a lodge at Big Meadows in Shenandoah.  And Dr. Cheezit and Firegirl met us south of Daleville and hike with us 2 days and treated us to incredible trail magic.  The sights and sounds and experiences of the AT are unspeakably wonderful.  But it is the people that we call friends who make the hike a Hike!Flex",,View Entry,"Mar 28, Sun",0
Flex,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633996,"When Curly and I hiked in 2018, we lived in a REI Dash 2 tent. It was ""one of a kind"" to be sure.  28 square feet with two adults and all of our gear smushed into it.   It was light, I think around 3 pounds.  Sadly, they were discontinued two years before we hiked, and we only saw one other person who used the same tent.  We loved that tent.  It served us so well, kept us dry, was comfortable, and we hated going to something else, but fact is, we wore it out.  It's last trip was a section hike over Roan Mountain in 2019 and it was full of holes and tears and lots of duct tape.
We decided to get something bigger and ended up with a Big Agnes Tiger Wall UL3.  Same weight, but lots more room.  Then, this year, I decided to get a Nemo Hornet 2P.  I like the room of the BA but love the size and packability of the Nemo.  Both are going to be used next week when we hit the trail for a 3 day section hike.  Winding Stair Gap to the NOC.  Super excited as this is our first shakedown of 2021 (2 others in May) and we have some gear to try out, besides the Nemo.  I think that part of the love of hiking/backpacking is the passion for gear.  Some folks like cars, others like boats, others like cameras - I like backpacking gear!

8.2 miles from Winding Stair Gap to Wine Spring Camp


Curly, Wendy and I hit the road at 6am and were at Winding Stair Gap by 10am.  We were super excited to be hiking with Wendy, as this was her first time backpacking. That and the awesome weather forecast which said no rain for the next three days.


With only 8 plus miles for the day planned, our first destination was Siler Bald, and it didn’t disappoint!  Views from all over, you could actually see Clingmans Dome in the far away distance.  We lingered long and soaked up the sunshine.


Our destination was Wine Spring Campsite and arrived around 430pm.  We were surprised that we were the only ones there...but not for long!  Within the hour the campsite was bustling with activity, it was just like old times!  Everybody gathered around a fire ring and made their dinners and chatted away. It was fun to once again be hanging around hikers; they truly are wonderful people!


Finally hiker mid nite arrived and before long the camp was quiet and still. A great first day back on trail, can’t wait for tomorrow!",,View Entry,"Apr 05, Mon",0

9.5 miles from Wine Spring Campsite to Rocky Bald stealth site


One of the fun aspects of section hiking is the flexibility of hiking distances and camp life. And we took full advantage of both this day.


I was up and around at 630am, light was just coming over the mountain. It was a cool morning but not bitter cold. You could tell it was going to be a good day. I was into my second cup of coffee when Curly and Wendy began to stir. There was no rush to get out of camp, and by golly we took our time. It was after 9am before we stepped off got the day. 


Layer upon layer of mountains, each one with its own unique blue and green hues were simply spectacular.  We ate second breakfast and lingered for a good while.


We pressed on towards the shelter, not in any hurry and taking plenty of breaks. We stopped at Licklog Gap for lunch and saw that Rocky Bald was only two miles beyond the shelter we were intending on stopping at. We decided that if we were feeling good once we made the shelter that we would camel up and set up camp at Rocky Bald.  Turned out to be a great decision.


Rocky Bald is a blue blaze off the AT, and it’s a tough one tenth of a mile, but make no mistake, it is most definitely worth the effort. The views are incredible, and the camp sites are awesome.  Once again by the time we finished there were several other hikers joining the party, and I think everyone plans on being front and center for what is forecasted to be a great sunrise.  All in all a wonderful day 2, with one more to go before we wrap this one up!",,View Entry,"Apr 06, Tue",0

8.75 miles from Rocky Bald to Rufus Morgan Shelter.


Lots of very cool things happened today.  Wendy is now “Charmed”, and you need to ask her about the backstory in that trail name.  All I have to say is that she earned it!


We caught an absolutely remarkable sunrise today. Everyone at the camp got up right around 630am for a 712am sunrise, and Mr. Golden Sun did not disappoint! It was a gorgeous morning as Mr. Moon bid Mr. Sun a good night...both in the sky together, briefly. It was magical.


But I think best of all was sharing that morning with others. Curly and Charmed of course, but also Sully, Wendy and Linger, fellow hikers and newfound friends. I’m telling you, acquaintances turn to friendships quickly on the trail and I look forward to following all of their journeys; on and off trail.


So we had 8.75 miles of pretty much all downhill today. Fortunately it was a fairly gentle grade and the terrain was kind to us, mostly. We pulled in to the shelter at 4pm, which is about the arrival time of our previous days. Pitched our tents down by the stream and can’t wait for the running waters to sing us to sleep.


Tomorrow we have one mile to wrap up our hike into the NOC, and there we will celebrate a maiden hiking voyage with Charmed then back home for a hot shower and our own bed!",,View Entry,"Apr 07, Wed",0

1 mile from Rufus Morgan Shelter to Nantahala Outdoor Center
Slept well last night with the stream providing wonderful background noise. One interruption  around 2am when a slapping sound woke me up. Wasn’t sure what it was, turns out a bear was trying to get a thru hikers bear bag which wasn’t far enough out of reach.  Fortunately, the bear wasn’t successful in claiming his prize and the hiker simply taped over the claw scratches on the bag.
Since we only had a mile to go and the restarting wasn’t open till 11am, we took our time getting around and finally broke camp about 930am. Strolled back into civilization and waited on the restaurant to open. When it did, a flood of hikers poured in and it was game on!  We all enjoyed a celebratory meal and hit the road for home.
All in all, a spectacular time on trail, the weather held out and rain didn’t appear until we got into our shuttle back to car.  Can’t wait for our next trip in May - Sams Gap to Erwin.",,View Entry,"Apr 08, Thu",0

Wobbles, Curly and I managed to drop a car at Table Rock SP, hang a stash of food at WhitewaterFalls, then get over to Oconee SP for a 1030am start!  I was impressed at our logistical skills.  Hopefully the good will still be hanging by the time we get there on Wednesday.


The first 8 miles are pretty easy, with a fairly flat terrain and lots of water.  We took our time, drank a lot of water and when we hit Licklog Falls, it was packs off and into the water for a long, refreshing break!  While we were “breaking”, we met a couple with a young, energetic dog named Coco. She saw that water and was in it before you could say “Lickety Split”. The six of us splashed around and took relief from the afternoon heat of 90 degrees.


Eventually we dried off and with 3.5 miles to hike to our campsite we began the climbing section of the Chatooga River portion of this trail.  The ups were a bit more challenging but the views more than made up for it! The ridge lines are spectacular with ferns covering the open spaces and the mountain laurel bringing their white buds to offset the greens.


We made it to camp about 430pm and set  up along the river.  Another soak in the water, a hot meal and a rushing stream all topped off what was a wonderful first day on this thru hike!",,View Entry,"May 01, Sat",0

Curly and I were stoked to be getting back on the trail especially so because we are with the Cosby’s. This is our fifth year in a row section hiking the AT with them, and we make a great hiking team.  With a few minor setbacks to start our day, we finally hit the trail about 1130am.



Spring has definitely sprung, (except for the temps), with the trees budding and the flowers in full bloom. I think one of the highlights of hiking this trail in April-May is experiencing the magical transition of winter to spring, it really is a death to life occurrence, and it’s beautiful to watch.


We’ve been told that Norovirus is running rampant in the shelters down south, so we passed on Bald Mtn Shelter and set up camp at a designated site about .2 tenths north.   Following a delicious, hot dinner, Curly and I are tucked into our tent looking forward to a good nights rest.  We have ten miles planned for tomorrow, we shall see how the day goes!",,View Entry,"May 10, Mon",0

We were totally expecting a wet, cold and dreary day today, and were completely surprised by what turned out to be a very nice day.


Taking our time breaking camp, we had a leisurely breakfast and finally stepped on the trail about 830am.  The trail got the day took us over High Rocks, which had a blue blaze trail to its summit. Curly and I neglected too many of those opportunities in 2018, so we’ve decided to be a bit intentional and take the time to venture down those blue blazes. Sadly the fog was still hanging around so the views were limited but that’s ok, we still reached the top and took a short break. 


Mid afternoon we stopped for a break and it was then that sun broke out of the clouds and the blue skies finally appeared. For the rest of the day we were treated to spectacular weather and fairly easy terrain.


We hiked just past No Business Knob Shelter and came upon a fantastic campsite just large enough for a couple tents.  Fire girl got a nice fire going and we enjoyed hiker tv until bedtime.  The weather is forecasted to be lousy tomorrow but we’ve only got 6 miles to Erwin.",,View Entry,"May 11, Tue",0

The rain held out until 4 am or so, but once I started it was game on.  Thankfully it was warm and dry in our tent, but you can’t lay around all day (or can you?).  Finally about 630am I got up and retrieved our food bags and the day began.


We were slow getting out of camp and the cold rain making it that much more difficult and miserable.  This was the first time in 5 years of section hiking with the Cosby’s that they had ever hiked in this type of crummy weather…their string of good luck definitely ran out.  But here’s the upside to crummy weather on a town day with only 6 miles to hike-you fly! No breaks no stops no nothing, just traveling down the trail as fast as our legs will carry us!


We ended up at Uncle Johnny’s  around 1130 and waited on our ride. We got to meet some thru hikers: John, Gab, Juice, Spokes and a couple from nearby us in Charlotte, NC. I think that’s the best part of the trail, meeting hikers and hearing their stories, definitely makes us wish we were thru hiking.


In the end, we hiked 24 miles between Monday afternoon and Wednesday morning. Weather wasn’t perfect, but this trip helped us dial in our gear for Maine next month. And of course we always love hanging out with Dr. Cheezit and Fire Girl.  Next up for us, a Foothills Thruhike in a couple weeks then onward to Maine!",,View Entry,"May 12, Wed",0

The FHT is a 76+ mile trail that runs from Table Rock State Park to Oconee State Park in South Carolina. This trail has no shelters, but does have excellent designated campsites.  It doesn’t travel through any towns, and there really aren’t any resupply options unless you stash some food yourself, but it does have an incredibly high concentration of waterfalls.

I woke up this morning expecting this day to be a big miles day.  For us to hike this trail in six days require a 12-13 miles per day average. It was ok for us to make a little less on day 1, but not any other days, and especially the second day.  But you know what? Stuff happens and plan A’s are typically useless on the trail to begin with…and so it was today.
We got to Fish Hatchery Rd about 430pm and what did our eyes see?  Trail Magic - ice cold sodas left by Taz for hikers. I can’t tell you how appreciated that drink was, especially for Wobbles. She couldn’t keep a single thing down all day but that soda soothed her stomach and allowed us to hike another 3 miles to the site we’re at tonight.  Thank you Taz for you generosity, it made all the difference today.


We got into camp about 630pm and set up, ate, hung our food and jumped into a stream to cleanup and cool off.  All things considered this day could have been a disaster but turned out to be a huge win for Wobbles. Overcoming adversity is what you have to do when you hike. It’s just the way it is.  She certainly persevered, and it was great to watch her hang in there.

We woke up this morning hoping that Wobbles would finally be rid of the nasty stomach bug but unfortunately that was not the case. Our initial thoughts was that she was experiencing heat exhaustion or something like that.  She got very little sleep and was fighting off the heaves all night long.


We basically had two options. One was to get to the next road crossing about 3/4 of a mile away and get her a shuttle back to her car, or try and gut it out and see if she gets any better, with another bailout point an additional 5 miles away. She opted for the second  one, and ended up paying dearly for it. Probably the most miserable five miles of her life. Curly and I felt so helpless all we could go was keep encouraging her to drink liquids and keep moving.  I was able to get enough cell service to reach Taz, and by 145pm Wobbles was on her way to the doctor.


Curly and I stepped on the gas to make up some miles, and in spite of the heat, it was a beautiful day. We followed the Whitewater River as well as the Thompson River and Bearcamp Creek.  The terrain in this middle section is no joke, really challenging. I forgot how tough this section was, but my memory soon came back!  I mentioned yesterday that there is plenty of water, and for the third day in a row, we jumped in and cooled off!


Because of the miles, we hiked until 715pm and landed at one of the nicest campsites on the trail - Bearcamp Creek campsite.  Directly on the water, this site has fire rings, benches and bear hang cables. A fantastic place to finish a grueling day!  It’s 9pm and time to hit the hay. Tomorrow is Heartbreak Ridge at the end of our day…gonna be another tough one!",,View Entry,"May 26, Wed",0

Today was definitely a day of contrasts. On the one hand, we had some really gentle terrain.  On the other hand, we had done horribly hard, hellacious, no switchback straight up climbs that literally took my breath away.  We had the cool gentle morning and then the contrast of vicious, soul sucking heat during the afternoon. We walked through stands of rhododendron that literally cool down the temperature by ten degrees, and we walked across completely bare spaces that were graded for electric lines.  It really was a day of contrasts, but in all the best ways.


We weren’t sure just how far we were going to hike today, but as the day wore on we just decided we wanted to have as few miles as possible on Saturday and that directed our actions.  So we got out of camp and took the trail by sections, from one camp to the next. As a result, anytime we arrived at a campsite, we took long breaks, and at the Toxaway camp, where the Toxaway River flows into Lake Jocassee, we stripped down to our skivvies and took a nice leisurely soaking!  By the time we finished up there it was almost 3 pm and we still had 5.5 miles to hike,so we stepped on it…at least until we reached Heartbreak Ridge, an appropriately named section of trail. This ridge has 284 wooden steps going up one side and 231 (I think) on the other.  It’s absolutely brutal! Curly however made it look easy as pie. I was simply thrilled to survive!


We made it to Laurel Fork Falls at a little past 6, got our chores done, cooked up some delicious instant potatoes with chicken, gravy and crunched up salt n vinegar chips. A feast fit for a hungry hiker.

Believe it or not, and Curly isn’t buying what I’m selling, today was the easiest day in three days…in terms of mileage. After pounding a 15 and a 16 mile day, today was merely 13!  But we did this in order to have a meager 8.5 mile to end our hike.


What we didn’t realize was that the hardest hiking of all week was today. Each day was difficult in its own respect, but wow we were surprised at the elevation and grade changes today.  By the time we summited Sassafras Mountain at 4pm, we were toast.  Fortunately, it was a beautiful day and the sun hid behind clouds a good portion of it.  The breezes were a huge blessing especially when we hit those summits, nothing like a cool breeze washing over your body.


Another high note was we got to meet “Mischief”, a hiker we follow on Instagram. He has a very inspiring story of overcoming adversity and it was a pleasure to run into him.  Matter of fact, yesterday when we were climbing Heartbreak Ridge, I found a camera lens filter on the ground.  I was sure it belonged to Mischief, as he is an outstanding photographer.  Sure enough, when we crossed paths on the trail, I pulled the camera filter out and asked if it was his? Indeed it was.  


We finally made it to camp at 5pm, a lot earlier than previous days, and we are all alone.  Ate my favorite meal “Black Bart Chili”, and are enjoying the evening breezes.  After 5 straight days of hiking with one more to go, I’m looking forward to the next week with our family, as we make final preparations for finishing the AT.",,View Entry,"May 28, Fri",0

No better day to finish up this hike than a Memorial Day Saturday.  Curly and I got up early to backtrack the 1.2 miles to Sassafrass Mountain and just barely caught the sunrise.  We brought our stove and had coffee and breakfast before hustling back to camp to pack up and finish this hike. With a 845am start and 8.5 miles to complete we somehow thought all those miles would be downhill after  the challenges of the previous week. Ha! Not happening, at least not yet. It wasn’t until we actually entered the State Park boundary that we began the downhill descent.  Until then, it was up, and some more up.
We camped the night before with @mischief_onthetrail and got to spend some time hiking with him. He was finishing up this thru hike as well. What a great guy and I can’t wait to follow his future adventures, he truly loves hiking and it obviously brings him great joy!
With 4 miles left in the hike, we began to see the weekend day hikers, sadly for them, they had to smell us!  We continued heading downhill, and finally made it to our car in a completely jammed parking lot!  What made it all great though was Wobbles was waiting for us and she was feeling a lot better and had a big smile on her face.  We can’t wait to head north with her to finish our AT hike and see her off on her own!

On the plus side, we did hike 6 miles and got over Wildcat D and E.  The views were incredible and so was the weather.  I think that for me, I have to remind myself regularly that we aren’t hiking in South Carolina and our mileage is gonna be a whole lot less for a while.  We came out here to finish the hike, and have a good time doing it.

We had 5 mountains to go over today - Carter Dome, Mt Hight, South Carter, Middle Carter, and North Carter. It was a cool, overcast day and we were expecting rain but it never materialized.


We had a fantastic day going up and over all of these mountains until coming down the last one, North Carter.  I’m not sure who thinks up this trail, but obviously whoever designed this descent must be absolutely stark raving mad!  The trail during the first third of a mile down required butt sliding and a whole lot of praying.

Well…it only took 3 years but it finally happened…we crossed the 1900 miles hiked on the AT!  We crossed over early in the day and just kept on walking north, and it turned out to be a really great day, a hard day but not treacherous, so overall a great day.


We had two ledges to scramble over, and neither bothered Curly, who is getting stronger and stronger every day.  We had our biggest mileage day, and was able to get it done by 5pm.


We did not get rained on, which was forecast, and the moment we hit the shelter, drops fell!  But we are dry.  The views were absolutely incredible, the two mountains in this post are Mt Washington on the left and Mt Madison on the right.


Tomorrow is supposed to be a wet day and we are preparing for that. Hoping and praying the residual effects of the recent tropical storm bypass us as we are entering some very difficult terrain.  Maine, here we come!","Gorham NH

7/9/21 - 9.6 miles from Gentian Pond Shelter to Full Goose Shelter.


Today was one of, if not THE most difficult days of hiking ever. 


We got an early start on trail knowing that our day would be wet and slow. It rained all night and pretty much the entire day, shifting from mist to drizzle to steady rain.  Of course this only heightens the anxiety when throw in some hand over hand climbing.


We hiked from 645am until 7pm with only one brief break at noon.  It was too wet and cold to stop for long, all your body heat dissipates immediately, and with the clouds covering ranges, views were very far and few.


Curly struggled but pushed on and was a trooper. When we hit  Goose Eye West, you had to go up a vertical slab with rebar hand holds, then cross over to a ledge with just enough room for your feet then another vertical slab that took you to a huge wooden ladder. That was pretty much the mental “end”of her day.  But she pushed thru it, had a good cry at the top and we kept moving.


Tomorrow we hike thru Mahoosic Notch and we are going to sleep in a little later and rest up for another big day","Gentian Pond Shelter

7/10/21 - 5.1 miles from Full Goose Shelter to Speck Pond Shelter


Hard is hard no matter the distance or task, but when the hard is conquered, the satisfaction that comes is a sweet reward.


We are feeling satisfaction today having hiked thru the infamous “Mahoosic Notch”, and up the doubly infamous “Mahoosic Arm”.


It can get a little claustrophobic going thru some of the tunnels, and packs have to come off it’s that tight. But…it’s fun and a great comeback after such a difficult previous day.


We only hiked 5.1 miles in 9.5 hours but the miles up here are so much more difficult than anywhere else on the AT, we are good with it.  Tomorrow we have “Old Speck” mountain between us as and a hotel room, shower and laundry. Can’t wait to get the stink off my body!","Full Goose Shelter

7/11/21 - 4.6 miles from Speck Pond Shelter to Grafton Notch


I believe Speck Pond Shelter is one of the most beautiful shelter settings on the trail. The shelter is probably 4 or 5 years old, constructed of gorgeous timber and roofed with wood shingles. Nestled no more than 50 yards from Speck Pond, which is stunning itself.  We were greeted as we arrived by a huge beaver swimming towards us from across the pond.  This morning we woke up to clear, blue skies. A chilly 50 degree morning got us moving and on the trail by 7am.


With only 4.6 miles to hike, you would think it’s a stroll to Grafton Notch…but that’s not how it works up here. You have to earn your miles and our first order of business was the 1 plus mile hike up Old Speck.  It was a doozy - steep and lots of slab, very unnerving and I just reminded myself and Curly to just keep looking up not down. Those “down” views will melt whatever courage you that remains!  We slowly nudged our way along the slabs, up and finally over the summit.  Took a picture of Curly going up the fire-tower ladder (not), and over the other side we descended.


It was a long slow descent, over 3 miles of steep, still wet rocks and slab.  But it was down, not up and we had town day to look forward to.  It took us 2 hours to hike up one mile and 3 hours to hike down but we arrived at our destination just after noon and our hiking partner, Sargent Sunrise, had her car in the lot. Lucky us!  She graciously gave us a ride to the store to resupply before dropping us off at the hotel.  We did our chores, ate a magnificent burger in town and decided to zero tomorrow for a rest day. These mountains are beating us up so an occasional break can only do us good. 


Next up, heading north day after tomorrow!","Speck Pond Shelter

Zero day in Bethel, Maine


Well, taking a zero after 7 days of hiking is definitely not something we would have done 3 years ago, however, old age and the trail changes things, and these circumstances are way different than last time.


I told Curly on this journey anytime she wants a zero just say the word.   Gotta make the most of these final 300 miles.  Today is all about good food, good rest, and refilling our food bags for the next 4-5 days.  Rangely is 46 miles away and our next resupply destination.


I’m typing this at the Crossroads Diner where we just finished a delicious breakfast at noon….because, why not? Breakfast is good any time any place.  Next up, a nap, then more food and a good nights rest.  Imposing Baldplate mountains for tomorrow will be our first order of business…more to come!","

Today was a day that went from easy to hard with the flip of a switch. With ten miles planned and the guide telling us that our first mountain (Wyman) would not only be easy, but take up the bulk of our miles (7), we were feeling pretty good as we broke camp.


Sure enough, the uphill was a pretty easy hike, and I was pleasantly shocked.  Nothing has been easy since we started, so we gladly welcomed this development.


The name was appropriate.  Moodiest mountain I’ve ever hiked! Imposing, intimidating almost daring you to attempt it!  Naturally, the weather called for thunderstorms in the afternoon, and as we went up we heard the rumbles of thunder, so we had to outrun rain and lightning to boot, which fortunately never materialized.  The elevation change was over 1,200 feet up and this was accomplished in about a mile.  I believe this was the most strenuous ascent we’ve made on this hike. It just seemed to go up, up and more up.  There were very few spots where you got a breather, it was just steep and up. Took us and hour and a half of just ups, and by the time we reached the summit, we were toast!


Fortunately the descent wasn’t quite the same, we were able to get down a whole lot easier.  We are camping at a site where a group of Maine Conservation Corps folks are working. They aren’t roughing it quite the same way as us, but I’m glad they are out here taking care of this land.


Tomorrow is Old Blue and Bemis mountain, both of which should make for incredible views if the weather clears up.  Can’t wait to find out!","East B Hill Rd

Today was a looooong day!  We started hiking at 630am and didn’t get into camp until almost 7pm.  It was our longest mileage day, and probably the warmest day as well.  


We had 2 mountains to climb up and over today: first was Old Blue. We actually made pretty good time ascending the three miles to the top, and that was mainly due to the easy grade right in the middle of a crazy beginning and a crazier summit.  Once we got over Old Blue, the elevation looked pretty good for Bemis Mountain.  Unfortunately, elevation changes don’t tell you the whole story, snd the story today was very steep “downs”.  The descents seemed to go on and on and that makes for very slow going.  So slow that it took us six hours to go 7.4 miles in the morning and six hours to go 5 miles in the afternoon.


Needless to say, we were dragging by the time we got to camp!  We are pitched close to a very nice stream, and a brother/sister duo (Grapple and Turtle) are next to us as well.they are Southbound and actually from our neck of the woods.


Tomorrow is a shorter day, 9.2 miles to Little Swift River Pond, where they have canoes on the pond that hikers can use. We are hoping the weather cooperates because rain and storms are forecasted.","South Arm rd

As this new day began at 5 o’clock in the morning, I was hoping and praying for a much better day than yesterday. We needed an “easy” miles day, and by golly that’s exactly what we got!


We had no idea what the trail would be like, given our experience up to this point was brutally difficult. But somebody pressed the “easy” button and our miles flew on beautiful paths mostly absent of boulders, roots, and nasty ascents/descents. The miles ticked off quickly and because we only had 9.3 to hike, we were halfway there by 1030am.


At precisely 1030am, the rains came and came down pretty good.  We happened upon Sabbath Day Lean-to and stopped in for early lunch. Curly got her first of 2 naps today!  I was entertained by a chipmunk trying to mooch food who makes his home at Sabbath Day Pond Lean To.


Rain quit after an hour or so and we got back on trail to finish up our hiking for the day. Strolled into our campsite at 3pm, we were all alone until about 10 minutes ago when another NOBO arrived.


Curly was disappointed that she didn’t get to go for a swim today, but she did get 2 naps which are a pretty fair trade. Tomorrow we have 4.8 miles to Rangely where we will stay at the Hiker shut, resupply for the next leg which includes the Saddlebacks beginning Sunday.","Bemis Stream

Today’s hike is brought to you by the word “suck”!  This day truly was on the level of suck the minute our feet hiked away from the Hiker Hut…which is a total exception to the days word.  Place was so cool…hippie vibe, totally off grid, hostel owner was a very nice guy, and we will definitely return some day.


But after that, this day was brutal. I have absolutely no pictures of today’s hike because I was too busy trying to stay alive. Cold, wet, windy weather came in from 745am until we finished at 315pm. I was hoping to get 10.5 miles in today but after getting over Saddleback and the Horn we were soaked thoroughly to  the bones. I was worried Curly might get hypothermic so we just did our best to come off the mountain and get to a campsite that was 8.1 miles from where we started.


I pitched the tent and got hot water going while Curly changed into dry gear. After a hot cup of tea for and instant chicken soup for me, everything was right with the world.  Hoping to get 10.5 miles in tomorrow weather permitting.  Right now, it’s all about the weather!","Rangely
