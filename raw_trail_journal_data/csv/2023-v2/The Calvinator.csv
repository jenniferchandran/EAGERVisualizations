The Calvinator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660879,"Hi. I'm Mike. Trail name is to be determined.Tomorrow is Friday, and it's my last work Friday in my career. A few months ago, as I was counting down the days to my retirement, time seemed to be frozen, each day bringing me any closer to retirement than Bill Murray was closer to the day after Groundhog Day. At least I didn't wake up to ""I've Got You Babe"" every morning.From a Christian perspective, I know that time is a gift from God. It's a gift you must spend -- you can't put it in the bank or save it for a rainy day. How we spend it determines the quality of our life. What is life made of except the passage of time? We can either spend it wisely or throw it away, never to repeat our moments, Kodak or otherwise. My past 17 years at JPMorgan Chase has zoomed by like a fleeting shadow. Whoa, what was that I just saw out of the corner of my eye? It was my career, my experiences since September 11 (easy day to remember), 2006.I used the pandemic as a wedge to flee Ohio at the end of 2020. Initially, I didn't even think about moving to Chattanooga. Knoxville or Maryville were my targets. But a member of the church I attended mentioned his dream destination was Chattanooga. ""Hmmm,"" I thought. ""I hadn't considered Chattanooga."" In the providence of God I not only ended up in Chattanooga, I purchased a condo perched on Lookout Mountain less than a mile from National Park Service trailheads. It was as perfect for me as a mud pit for a pig.Facing retirement feels like jumping off into an abyss. Yes, there are a bunch of perks, starting with having the time to thru hike the Appalachian Trail, fulfilling a long-held dream. No more alarms, the opportunity to socialize more by attending book clubs and Toastmasters' meetings, volunteering at church, spontaneous road trips and not dealing with the pressures that come from dealing with rude, angry clients, deadlines, keeping up with technology and meeting performance goals. But I'll miss the routine, the structure, the feeling of ""I've got something to get done today."" I'll miss my boss and colleagues, even though I've been connecting with them for three years via Zoom. And, let's face it: There's something nice about getting a paycheck twice a year and being able to count on the abundant healthcare benefits I have enjoyed through Chase.I haven't settled on what I'll do of my first day of retirement, but I'm certain retirement won't be anything like the refrain in Cheech and Chong's comedy record, ""Sister Mary Elephant."" The good sister demands her students read their essays on how they spent their summer vacation. She called on an apparent pothead who is obviously fabricating his essay as he speaks. ""Okay. The first day on my vacation...what I did on my summer vacation. The first day on my vacation, I woke up. Then, I went downtown to a look for a job. Then I hung out in front of the drugstore. The second day on my summer vacation, I woke up, then I went downtown to look for a job. Then I hung out in front of the drugstore. The third day on my summer vacation, I woke up. Then I got a job, keeping people from hanging out in front of the drugstore.""But I, for one, won't be making up a story on the fly. THIS is my story. My hike. My dream come true (I hope). After almost a decade of dreaming, planning, researching gear, doing countless training hikes and telling scores of people that I'm planning to thru-hike the Appalachian Trail, I am now going to do a lot more than talk. On April 20, my friend Tim and I will meet up at the Appalachian Trail Conservancy in Harpers Ferry, W. Va., take a few photos, saunter 3/10th of a mile down the blue-blazed connector trail, and step north toward Mount Katahdin. Tim can only hang with me for about a week, but it's great to have someone with whom I can start the journey. OK, it's almost 11 p.m. Time for bed. I have to work tomorrow. ",,View Entry,"Mar 16, Thu",0
The Calvinator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660897,"Everything seems to be coming together nicely. My Medicare Part B is now showing on my Social Security Account page. Today, I purchased a Zoleo satellite communicator, which is replacing my old SPOT device. The Zoleo interfaces with my Smartphone, so I'll be able to send and receive emails and get updates from first responders in the event of a medical or other emergency, like being lost and unable to find my way back. My Far Out app supposedly would solve that, but technology isn't foolproof. This is a backup plan for that possibility. The redundancy is 1) My cell phone 2) Navigation app 3) Zoleo. More importantly, I'll be in the hands of God. He doesn't guarantee my health or safety at any given moment, but He does promise to never leave or forsake me, to provide my needs, and to carry me safely to heaven.Tomorrow morning is going to be cold, cold, cold for this time of year. But I think it's important to get out there and do a long hike. We'll see how motivated I am. Last Saturday, which was also chilly, I was content with doing a 10-mile loop on Lookout Mountain. I might end up repeating that. I will be able to get in a number of good hikes before I leave for the AT. In two weeks, I plan to hike the Coosa Backcountry trail in Vogel State Park, which is definitely major league hiking. I did Coosa last April. I don't recall ever feeling that I couldn't make the hike or anything like that, but...I learned that I needed a better tent, as I woke up in the middle of the night in a pool of water. Having rain pants would have enabled me to get back to sleep. I tried to hike out at 4 a.m., but alas, it's not easy finding a black Ursack bear bag against a black tree in the black of night. So I suffered, and learned. I wonder what I'll learn on my thru hike? There's a lot more to backpacking that you might think, but I'm beginning to think the information overload is a net loss. You can find a You Tuber telling you about the benefits of using a certain piece of gear in one video, and then telling you the same piece of gear is superfluous in another video. These click bait videos like ""Ten Things I'd Do Differently if I Thru-Hiked Again,"" ""Five Things Thru-Hikers Ditch First,"" etc. are probably not real helpful. Sometimes, it almost gets to be considered a moral issue...""You are carrying THAT?"" Everyone who makes it at least a few hundred miles learns what does and doesn't work for them. It literally matters not at all what someone else thinks about gear choice. On the other hand, I want to stay humble...just because I bring a certain piece of gear or do something else on the trail doesn't mean those choices can't be improved. The majority of thru-hikers are quite serious about their backpacking passion, and they know A LOT more than I do. If you add up all the backpacking I've done in my life, it probably totals less than three weeks. My strength is hiking, not backpacking. Meanwhile, I've got 11 days of work left, and only five of those days will I be in the office. I have the Ligonier Ministries National Conference to look forward to next week!",,View Entry,"Mar 17, Fri",0
The Calvinator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660925,"Providence struck again today. I stopped in to the Mountain Memories gift shop on Lookout Mountain this morning prior to heading out for a hike on Raccoon Mountain. I decided to grab a Coke and at the cash register I saw they were selling small pocket knives, exactly what I needed instead of the larger multi-tool knife I had originally planned to carry. I may not be ultralight yet, but I just saved myself an ounce or two.",,View Entry,"Mar 18, Sat",0
The Calvinator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661523,"The past two weeks have felt like a ride on Space Mountain at Disneyland. I drove to Nashville and then flew to Orlando on March 22 for the Ligonier Ministries National Conference. Getting sick on the last day of the conference has become a regular occurrence. A few years ago I picked up a bad cold and ended up all drugged up and sleeping through Sinclair Ferguson's final conference message. This year, the culprit was food poisoning. I found myself rushing out of the auditorium to vomit out to remnants of the ""Mum's Pot Roast"" I had eaten the previous evening. It was back to Chattanooga, followed by a drive back to Nashville two days later for a flight to Columbus, Ohio. My team at JPMorgan Chase helped me celebrate my retirement with many kind words, a cake, a card, an AT map wall decoration and dinner. It was a sweet sendoff as I capped my 50-year working career. The day after returning from Columbus, I headed over to Vogel State Park near Blairsville, Ga. for a shakedown backpacking hike on the Coosa Backcountry Trail. The Coosa means business; 3,600+ elevation gain in almost 13 miles of hiking. I didn't know how I'd fare, as I had experienced food poisoning and a cold and really hadn't hiked in about 10 days. Once I got on the trail, I felt fine although a little slower than usual (and the usual is far from speedy). The first day I really enjoyed the trek and just savored the moment. Since I'd gotten off to a late start, I only hiked about five miles and set up camp at one of the primitive campsites along the trail. I hadn't seen a soul for the entire hike, not even a squirrel. I ate my Mountain House chicken alfredo meal, and I was annoyed at myself for having forgotten my Cosmic Brownie dessert in my car. I even sipped a steaming cup of hot tea. The forecast called for ""thunderstorms in spots"" early in the morning, which didn't intimidate me. It turned out that one of the spots the storm hit was my tent. The wind howled, the rain came, and the thunder roared. At one point I was afraid the wind would tear the rainfly off my Nemo tent, so I grabbed my rain paints and jacket just in case I had to dash out in the rain to re-stake the fly. But everything held. After waiting for the storm to subside, I finally was back on the trail around 9 a.m. and began a very tough hike, ascending probably 1,500 feet before dropping down to Highway 180. I stopped for lunch, followed by an insanely steep climb that lasts less than a mile but feels like five. Shakedowns are real-world learning labs, and I discovered that the pack I was using, my Granite Gear Crown 60, was just not going to work. I love the design of the pack, but there was too much weight on my shoulders, so I went back to my Osprey Exos 58. I THINK I've adjusted it to ride just off my shoulders, but I'll be doing some day hikes with the pack fully loaded just to make sure.It's surreal to say this, but I'm only a little more than two weeks out from starting the trail.",,View Entry,"Apr 02, Sun",0
The Calvinator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661777,"Last Wednesday, my A.T. hiking partner Tim Taaffe and I did about a 10-mile loop on the Cumberland Trail. It was a hot and humid day, and we were both whipped by the end. This was the very definition of a ""trash"" hike -- a hike in which, by the end, your body is trashed. For the last mile, I just was out of energy. Tim fared better, but he was exhausted, too. It's these kinds of hikes that, while difficult and discouraging, grow one's ability to hike and remain resolute. So many sweet things have happened the past few days. A few weeks ago, I was a caller on Kim Komando's (www.komando.com) national radio show and podcast, asking a question about cameras for my thru-hike that would enable me to transfer photos via wi-fi. Kim was fascinated by my thru-hike, and I sent her a link to my TrailJournals page along with a frank explanation that I couldn't take her recommendation of a GoPro 8 -- I ended up with a less expensive and simpler Polaroid Wave. Kim took the time to write me a personal note, and it was obvious she had taken the time to read my Trail Journal. Then I briefly texted with Kyle ""Mayor"" Rohrig, a triple crowner who is an outstanding story teller and has written books on his AT, PCT and CDT thru-hikes. It was Kyle who first encouraged me to stop dreaming and start doing my AT thru-hike. Kyle and I exchanged some friendly texts, and he said that knowing he made such a difference in my decision was fulfilling.Then I received an Easter lunch invitation from Roger and Shari Collins. Roger is our new associate pastor, and he and Shari are staying in my condo while I'm on the trail. Their logistical support and encouragement are invaluable.Lastly, my former manager, Holly ""Chief"" Neville, texted me with a trail name suggestion from another former colleague, Heidi Johnson. The suggestion won't work, but the fact that they are still thinking of me means so very much.On Wednesday, I'm headed to Tim's to compare what he and I are carrying in our packs to start the trail. Of course, Tim's only going to be out there for a week, so he can afford to take more. When hikers get together, they can pick up ideas from one another. We both carry Osprey Exos 58 backpacks, and he showed me how to use the little bungee attachment on the back of the pack; I showed him my Anti-Gravity Gear rain jacket, which he thought was the coolest thing since sliced pepperoni. He also had his wife text a picture of his pee bottle. It seemed better than what I bought from Walmart, a contraption that essentially looks like a gasoline pump hose. What, you expected us to crawl out of our tents and stumble around in the dark every time nature calls? ",,View Entry,"Apr 08, Sat",0
The Calvinator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662033,"One week out...I did a 10-mile training hike (Skyuka/Bluff Loop) on Lookout Mountain on Tuesday; yesterday, I discovered that I had somehow lost my Six Moons ultralight hiking umbrella on the trail.As Deputy Dog would have said, Dagnabit.So I perused replacements and the possibility of having one shipped to me that would arrive by Monday. I didn't purchase one, hoping I might find the umbrella on my training hike. I prayed that the Lord, in His kind providence, would allow that to happen. But I also know that losing stuff is part of life, and these things are part of the curse of the Fall -- the thorns and thistles that grow because nature is cursed.In this case, I had already ascended the big hill on the Bluff Trail, which crests at the point where the trail to Point Park splits off to the left. There's a kiosk there with a map. I never pay any attention to it, and I hiked right past it. But I soon encountered some rock climbers, the same folks I had seen the day before. There was a very attractive young woman, Andrea, with whom I had a brief conversation. Many who see my full pack immediately understand I'm out there training for something big, and she asked me about my plans. I told her I was soon leaving for an AT thru hike. She was rightly impressed (haha). So fast forward to yesterday, and who do I see but Andrea and friends. The first thing she said was, ""Did you get your umbrella?"" It turned out she had found it, placed a sweet note on the kiosk and hung the umbrella behind the kiosk. I had missed it and would not have found it had she not told me about it. So I have my umbrella back, thanks to Andrea and the kind providence of God.Meanwhile, I went to Tim's house yesterday and we laid out all our gear. I also weighed my back, and I cringed when the scale read 21.5 pounds. Too heavy! I want to be at or below 20 pounds base weight, but where could I save weight? Tim agreed that there didn't seem anything I could scale back on. But I thought and thought and decided that I'm going to swap out my sleeping bag liner for long underwear. The weather forecast shows lows in the low 40s. I already have a 20 degree quilt, and I can augment it with the long underwear and, if needed (and it probably will be needed) my puffy jacket. As May approaches, the weather should be warmer and warmer, and a sleeping bag liner, while nice to have, is one of those things that I probably would have needed if I had started a week or two earlier. I'm also trying to buy a lighter power bank. The weight savings from the liner/underwear swap and a lighter power bank could get me under 20 pounds.And finally, I think I have my trail name, ""The Calvinator."" David Marr, an elder at my church, came up with that at our small group Bible study earlier this evening. I like it.Don't mess with the Calvinator.

The Calvinator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662180,"In April 1994, having become self-employed, I decided to take a vacation. I had a fuzzy vision of visiting a quaint mountain town somewhere out west. On a whim, I stopped at a travel agency (yeah, those were actually a thing). Hoping to get some attention from a leggy travel agent who would sit down with me and present some options, I instead got a leggy travel agent who handed me a brochure about a town called Estes Park and sent me on my way. It was a letdown. Not only did I not get the female attention I wanted, but the marketing material she gave me was about a place of which I'd never heard. As far as I was concerned, the magazine she gave me might as well have read, ""Visit West Armpit."" But I took the magazine back to my apartment. Visiting the bathroom, I needed some reading material, so I leafed through the magazine urging me to visit Estes Park. And wow, did the Chamber of Commerce ever put together a great publication. It made Estes Park, the eastern gateway to Rocky Mountain National Park, seem like the fountain of youth, a kind of modern day Eden. I was in. I had no idea that my life was about to change profoundly. I fell in love with Estes Park, with Rocky Mountain National Park, and with hiking. Slowly, year by year, I did more and more hiking, as I would visit Estes Park annually. I got better at hiking, even doing a 17-mile backpack across the Continental Divide with my brother in 2017. And, eventually, I learned about something called the Appalachian Trail and thru-hiking.Fast forward to 2014 or so, when Triple Crowner Kyle Rohrig replied to my text with an encouragement to thru hike the AT. It was at that point I decided that was what I was going to do. Since then, I got more and more serious about preparation for my thru-hike. That preparation included moving to Chattanooga in January 2021, where I had access to more challenging and interesting terrain than I could find in Ohio. Despite tearing my quad tendon twice that year, I was back to doing serious hikes last year and the first four months of 2023. I have hiked the Bluff Trail on Lookout Mountain, a decent after-work training hike, hundreds of times. Saturday marked the last time, at least as a training hike for my AT thru-hike. Starting my AT thru hike is something I've dreamt about and into which I've poured much sweat. Hiking almost every day takes discipline. I seldom ""felt"" like ending my workday and strapping on an heavy backpack, driving to the Cravens House or Guild trailheads, and hiking the same trails over and over. Yet I did it. I did it because I knew I needed to do that if was going to have any chance to successfully thru hike the AT.But now that the big hike is upon me, I'm feeling very apprehensive. That's probably normal. My lifestyle is getting a major kick in the butt. Climate control, driving to a store or restaurant, church every Sunday, browsing my phone for Kitboga videos, starting my day with coffee and an Alistair Begg sermon -- all of this will be temporarily gone. Everything I own, I'll be carrying on my back.This is my last entry before the hike begins on April 20. It's here. Finally. I can barely comprehend it. I'm surprised I'm even writing all this. Harpers Ferry, here I come.F",,View Entry,"Apr 16, Sun",0
The Calvinator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662463,"this is being dictated by voice, so please overlook the typos, misspellings, poor grammar, Etc. This will be stream of Consciousness stuff. We finally got on the trail yesterday morning around 10:30. Yesterday's hike was extremely tough, made more difficult by hot and humid weather. We finally made it to the Crampton Gap shelter around 5:30, and I was able to relax and prepare a meal consisting of idahoan mashed potatoes with some beef jerky thrown in for protein. For dessert I had a half melted Snickers bar. Earlier in the day, we stopped for lunch at the Ed Garvey shelter. That was a really sweet shelter, and it would have been nice to stay there but it was too early in the day to stop. I'm guessing it's one of the few shelters with glass windows on the Loft floor. The Crampton Gap shelter was cool too, with a large deck and a boardwalk Bridge to the privy. With water sources rare, I filled up on water at Crampton Gap, which made today's hike more difficult. My pack kept weighing down on my shoulders, and to make things more uncomfortable, the plastic clip for the pack brain, which I'm not using, kept digging into my shoulder. So when I arrived at the Dahlgren backpack Campground I perform surgery on my pack removing those two plastic clips. I'm also beginning to see the necessity for being is light as I can with my pack. So I got rid of some food and also was able to dump my trash. The Dahlgren Campground is probably about the nicest facility you could find on the AT. There's a water spigot, bathrooms, showers, picnic tables and tent pads. After 2 days on the trail I'm a bit discouraged with how difficult this is and seriously Wonder if and how I can make it to Maine. But I'm certainly not ready to give up, and I hope that lightning my pack well give me some more pep in my step tomorrow.","Harpers Ferry

The Calvinator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662588,"I think this is the first time I've updated my blog since two nights ago. At the Dahlgren backpack Campground, not only that I order pizza and take a shower, I meant some exceedingly nice people. One of them was Rainbow Warrior, a beautiful Hawaiian girl who was section hiking with her dad who's 76 years old. Yesterday turned out to be the worst weather day I've endured on trail so far although in some ways it was preferable to hiking in 80 plus degrees with high humidity. The weather changed overnight and yesterday morning it was windy and somewhat cloudy but still very pleasant for hiking. But in the afternoon the storms came. I deployed my backpacking umbrella, which was a real asset to have on the trail. A number of passing hikers inquired about it and thought it was very cool. But the rain became so intense that I also had to dine my rain jacket and rain pants to stay relatively dry and avoid having to put on wet clothing this morning. With temperatures in the low 40s or even high 30s, putting on wet clothing would have been especially demoralizing. Yesterday I hiked nearly 15 miles, which was a real confidence booster. I made it to the Ensign Cowal shelter, where I caught up with Tim and his friend Ken. They had ducked in there at 11 a.m. and never left because of the rain. I experienced my first night staying in a shelter. I thought I might freeze but between my hiking clothes, puffy jacket, quilt and liner, I managed to stay fairly comfortable.  I kept waiting for the dreaded mice, but I think it was too miserable even for them. Yesterday's and Today's hikes featured plenty of rocks. They slowed me down but have not been scary. Tonight I'm zeroing near Pen Mar in Soola's home with two other flip floppers. Soola is doing my laundry.  Tomorrow we are going to resupply, and then I will read and relax and a nearby coffee house. Life is good. Glory be to God alone. ","

The Calvinator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662683,"Today has been my easiest day, and it was just a beautiful day to hike. Yesterday, I zeroed at Cascade cottages, which is just a fancy name for a home that hosts through hikers. I spent the day yesterday relaxing at a coffee shop and resupplying and I also enjoyed a burger and fries from Wendy's. It was a good evening to be inside from the elements, as the temperature last night was close to freezing. Tonight will be chilly too, but probably not quite as cold as last evening. Today featured an eight point six mile hike from penmar Park to tumbling run shelter. The shelter setup is really sweet. There are two small shelters one for snores and the other for non-snorers. There's also a covered Pavilion with a picnic table, another picnic table, and a clothesline. The weather could not have been better with clear skies and cool but not cold temperatures. The train was also extremely mild. I reached the shelter early in the afternoon and could have gotten here even sooner but I took a long lunch break. Had I known it would be so quick and easy I wouldn't have made a reservation at the Caledonia State Park campground for tomorrow night. But since I've already made the reservation and paid for it, I decided there's no rush and I was happy to stop for the day. The two through hikers who were at Cascade Cottage are here, Magilla Gorilla and his wife Broom-Hilda. She got her Trail name because of her habit of obsessively shelters.

The Calvinator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662923,"hello folks. I realize it's been a few days since I last added to my journal. The days have flown by and were sort of a blur the last time I added an entry seems like a thousand years ago. That was back near penmar Park. Penmar is at Mile 1067. I'm currently at mile 1124.3. Wow, it's been almost 60 miles since I added to my blog. The weather and Terrain have been mild until yesterday. That's when it all hit the fan. I was hiking 15 miles from Pine Grove furnace State Park, where I had stayed in the iron Masters Mansion hostel. The last few miles into Pine Grove were rainy, but I managed to stay dry with my backpacking umbrella and rain jacket. It was supposed to rain yesterday, but all it did was missed a bit in the morning. It wasn't anything that even required any rain gear. I stayed at the Alec Kennedy shelter, expecting there to be a big group of Backpackers. But it turned out it was only me and two other hikers. I decided to stay in the shelter, as the weather was supposed to turn bad overnight. And it did. I only had about 4 MI to hike to reach Boiling Springs, but they were four miserable miles. It poured the entire time, and I ended up soaked even though I had deployed my umbrella and more both rain pants and a rain jacket. When the rain is coming down that hard it doesn't seem to matter much. It one point the trail zigzag through farmland, and getting my feet soaked was unavoidable. I finally stumbled into Boiling Springs, and had a good breakfast that included a cheese omelette, home fries, toast and sausage. Now I want to backtrack to yesterday's hike. The AWOL guide had two notations wanted mile 1117.5 and the other at 1117.9. It's simply said Rock maze. At first, it seems sort of fun following the arrows and white blazes through the mass of house sized boulders. But then the fun really started, with some serious scrambling at several places, the first of which I could only barely hoist myself up to the next Rock. Thanks be to God for getting me safely through that section. The train for the next 8 miles or so is going to be very mild, which is a plus. I am going to have to hike in it for 8 Miles tomorrow morning but then I will reach Carlisle, where I'll be staying in a Quality Inn. It won't be a zero, but it will be civilization and respite, which I desperately need. Meanwhile, I have had the opportunity to serve the Lord. Back at the iron Masters hostel, there was a volunteer who seems to be essentially homeless, and loves to talk with anyone who will listen. His interest seem to be peaked when he heard my trail name, the calvinator. He began spewing all sorts of false religious beliefs, apparently thinking I would be impressed. He even opined that Jesus was a Buddhist. In response to this, I had the opportunity to share the true gospel, and not only did he hear it but several in the lounge next door and The Innkeeper, who is from Israel. I saw this man the next morning when I was getting ready to head out, and I asked him if he had thought about what I'd said to him. He said he had been thinking about it and I urged him to repent and Trust Christ Alone for the Forgiveness of his sins. I'm sitting at a picnic table covered and out of the rain although it's still chilly, waiting for my ride to the hostel. I'm sipping on some convenience store hot coffee which actually tastes delicious. It will be so good to dry out tonight, and even better to stay in the motel tomorrow, if I can somehow Splash my way 8 miles down the trail to Mechanicsburg PA. Sorry this is so choppy, but again I can't write it so I'm just dictating random thoughts. Perhaps, if I make it all the way to Katahdin and then to Springer Mountain, I'll try to make sense of all this and put it in a book. But that's a long long way away. That's it for now folks","

The Calvinator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663012,"okay so the first thing I should say is that somehow I have exceeded 100 miles on this journey so far. I can think back not far in the past, when I wondered how I would be feeling at the 100 mile mark and even if I would last that long. Before my Appalachian Trail through hike, the longest backpacking trip I had been on was two days and three nights and some of those trips seem to last forever. But here I am on the 80 and I really have not given much thought to the 11 days I've been out here. Scratch that, make it 12 days. Today started out bright and early from Lisa's hostel in Boiling Springs. I don't want to rag too badly on hostels, my experience in the three in which I've stayed is it's the worst part of attempting a through hike. Lisa is a nice lady, and I don't blame her for trying to make a few extra bucks. The accommodations were in a type of outdoor shed, where you might normally park your rider lawn mower. She has converted this space to a makeshift hostel with four bunks a microwave, with a small round table, some folding chairs, a small refrigerator, and a microwave. The bathroom was okay as hostile bathrooms go as it was in the house and fairly clean. Lisa was very clear about the rules, one of which was we needed to be ready by 7:30 or she'd be driving away without us and the bathroom would be locked. Anyway, the best part about the morning was that it wasn't raining. There were patches of blue sky, and that along with moderately cool temperatures made it a good morning for hiking. I got off to a late start as I first ate breakfast at Cafe 101, and then waited for the local Outdoors store to open at 9:00. After talking with some other through hikers or long distance Backpackers, I decided I needed a pack cover. The rain was soaking my pack even though I had been using my backpacking umbrella, which I thought was going to keep the pack relatively dry. That plan hasn't worked, and not only does the pack get soaked but it adds Precious weight. I had a pack cover at home but I didn't bring it because I didn't think I would need it with my umbrella. So when I called Shari back my condo, she was able to find the pack cover and will be mailing it to me along with my Bear Vault, as the ATC says new enhanced food storage regulations are in place in many national forests.  Thank you, Shari and Roger! Anyway,  today's hike was essentially flat and took me through bucolic fields and pastures. Along the way, I came upon my first trail magic consisting of oranges and jugs of water. I grabbed a couple of oranges, eager for some healthy food. At the Quality Inn, they have a hiker rate and a hiker box, where I found some needed Ziploc bags. I enjoyed a nice dinner at the diner next door. I've been able to do laundry and dry out everything  Back in Boiling Springs,  Seeker, who is getting off the trail due to multiple injuries, gave .e two Mountain House meals, so I'm set for resupply. Seeker served 38 years in the Marines, so the chitchat was mostly about military topics.  Now for some possible TMI. I'm going to try hiking sans under shorts. They just keep riding up and giving me a wedgie, and I can't handle it anymore. We'll see how it goes!","

The Calvinator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663146,"Today's hike began at the Darlington shelter, where I froze my @#$%! off last night. There were a bunch of hikers there, including Little Train, Frodo, Oz and Leap Frog. They were a pretty chill group but all 20 somethings except for one guy.  Frodo, who's from the UK, was especially friendly. This morning they alerted me to some major trail magic 2.5 miles down the trail. A trail angel had set up a truck with an awning,  gas fire, and a full breakfast spread of eggs, potatoes,  bacon, blueberry pancakes, coffee and orange juice. On a cold, rainy morning that lifted everyone's spirits. The trail traversed expansive pastures and fields of green before reentering the forest and climbing. After Hawk's Nest Lookout, only about a mile from Duncannon,  the rain returned along with some hail, and the trail descended very steeply over uneven rock slabs and steps. I finally reached Duncannon,  glad to be on level ground,  and the rain stopped.  Tonight I'll be warm and dry at Kind of Outdoorsy hostel.","

The Calvinator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663554,"It has been 4 days since I last posted in either Facebook or Trail journals. That was at mile 1185, which was where I stayed in Lickdale. Since then, I have traversed 35 difficult miles, and I'm in Hamburg , PA , taking only my second zero tomorrow. Long distance backpacking weighs on you, both physically and mentally. Yesterday I was seriously considering getting off the trail again, but my friend Tim back in Chattanooga talk me off the ledge. At the time my back was aching and the soles of my feet had taken a pounding from the rocks, the climbs, and hiking in general for many miles with a 30-pound pack strapped to my back. As is typical along the Appalachian Trail, upon leaving Lickdale the trail climbed about 800 feet. After that, the trail leveled with only minor ups and downs. I ended up camping for the night at the William Penn shelter, mile 1192.3. The shelter seemed pretty creepy to me, and I read some comments on Far Out app about a rattlesnake that had taken up residence on the second floor of the shelter. I decided to pitch my tent. The next day was more of the same, and I ended up hiking through a burned out forest. I camped at Hertline Campsite. It was a warm day, and my quilt kept me cozy as I got a good night's rest. I also was able to call ahead to the Microtel Inn in Hamburg for a two-night reservation, as I planned to take a zero on Thursday. My last night of camping before reaching Hamburg was at an unnamed campsite at Mile 1216.1. That left me less than 5 MI from Hamburg, and I was dreading them. That's because both the app and AWOL showed a very steep descent into Port Clinton. I've hyped enough to know that those types of descents can be scrambles that require you to at times sit on a rock and slide down. So I decided to do a little research, and I found an article on the Trek that essentially described the three miles leading into Port Clinton as a rocky nightmare. So I tossed and turned, wondering how I was going to get through all that. But I knew it had to be done, even if it was partially on my butt. I called friends back in Chattanooga and asked them to pray. It turned out that this section of the trail was much like the chained lion in Pilgrim's Progress. I kept waiting for the trail to become extremely rocky, followed by a virtual drop into the abyss. But alas, my dread had no basis in reality. While there were some rocky portions, and the trail did drop rapidly, the hike was actually very easy and I arrived in Port Clinton hours earlier than I anticipated. The biggest challenge of the day turned out to be finding the Red Robin burger place, I finally did locate it, and down a gourmet cheeseburger, two orders of fries, several Cokes, and a chocolate milkshake. One thing I've learned is that you can't believe everything you read or hear about the trail. For example, Rocksylvania is not as rocky as people say. The NOBOs that wrote about the ""insanely steep"" descent into Port Clinton must have wanted us to believe they are some tough hombres who conquered the terrain. So, I'm still on the trail after 193 miles. I don't have any idea what the future holds, and I'm just taking it one day at a time.","

The Calvinator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663830,"Well, the physical and emotional roller coaster that is my journey on the Appalachian Trail continues. I ended up taking back to back Zero's in the Port Clinton area because I intended to hike out on Friday, but I needed to mail home my bear bag and the post office didn't open until 12:30 p.m. with temperatures in the mid 80s, I just couldn't get motivated to hike out in the afternoon knowing that I would encounter a fairly steep and long climb. The hiking on Saturday and Sunday did not go stunningly well, especially on Saturday when many things went wrong. Perhaps the most annoying of those was that my little bottle of sunscreen, which was attached to one of my belt loops with a carabiner, ended up leaking all over one of my pant legs. That created an uncomfortable and ugly mess. In addition both my water filtration bottle and my cooking freezer bag developed small leaks. Finally, the system I had worked out back in Hamburg actually was not working out well at all. I had purchased a hydration fanny pack at Cabela's, thinking it would take some the water weight off my shoulders. The whole setup was extremely uncomfortable, and there was no way I even wanted to go on to Lehigh Gap wearing that ridiculous fanny pack. The remedy for all this turned out to be a stay at Lookout hostel in New Tripoli. The hostel owner, Trail name Yardsale, helped shake down my pack and also took me to Dollar General, where I found the perfect water bottle and was able to return to my former system with a slightly lighter pack. Yardsale had offered to take me to Delaware Water Gap for a fee of $110, but she was really encouraging me to dial down my pack weight and continue the trail. Ultimately, that's what I did. Today featured beautiful blue skies and moderately warm temperatures. It's a good thing there was no rain because I had to Traverse the infamous knife's Edge. That was extremely intense hiking and I had to concentrate and balance very carefully to avoid falling. It felt great to have completed that section and survived what Rocksylvania threw at me. Tomorrow it's on to Lehigh Gap, where I'll indulge in some town food, resupply and stay in a hostel.","Lookout Hostel
