Dingo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660327,"Getting ready finish what I started last year. What a year that was. Highs of starting and making the first week or so feeling great and ready to press on. Lows of watching a parent decline and fade so quickly. What turned into a thru hike has turned into a section. A very short one from Springer to Franklin, NC and a longer one from Harpers Ferry to Bennington VT. Will fill in the gaps between Frankie and Harper this year. 12 weeks starting in early April. Then flip up to Bennington and continue on to Baxter. Wish me luck!",,View Entry,"Feb 28, Tue",0
Dingo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661222,Got into the states on the 16th. Will spend the next few weeks visiting friends and family while doing last minute tuneups to my gear. Hit Franklin NC 29 March a few days slackpacking in that area before heading North on 1 April. An appropriate day some would say.,,View Entry,"Mar 18, Sat",0
Dingo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662222,"Back on the trail where I left off last year at Deep Gap. Thanks to Marty for getting me to Franklin the night before. You’re a good friend mate. Sherpa Al brought me  back to where it all fell apart last year. Spent some time walking back up to Standing Indian Mountain thinking about mum. Still miss her a lot. Continued on with a slack pack to Mooney Gap and back to room for my first day slackpacking.
Day two Mooney to Rock Gap woke up feeling great another day getting back into the flow windy as hell feeling great. Crossed 100 trail miles met Jeff, more on him in a few weeks and a few folks whom I’ve fell into walking with.
Day three Rock to Wayah Gap. Last day slackpacking. Still felt great. Met a guy who looked familiar doing trail magic. Turned out he was at hostel around the bend with me last year. Good to see he finished. Small world!
Day 4 Wayah gap to cold spring shelter. 10 mile day. Felt a bit tired. First real night back on trail. Met Slow and Steady there. Nice couple from FLA. Maybe we’ll walk together?
Day 5 Cold Spring Shelter to the NOC. 11.7 miles. First part of the day was great. Then the rain set in. Yuck. Wet descent into the NOC. Fortunately had arranged a night at a hostel Gracious Stays, a funky hostel just up the road. A great night cleaned clothes and warmed up.
Day 6 NOC to Sassafras Gap shelter7 miles. The climb out of the NOC kicked my ass. Had designs to go farther, stopped at Sassafras Gap for a rest and decided best call was to stay. Caught up with Slow and Steady and started seeing familiar faces. Good folks. 
Day 7 - sassafras gap shelter to Stecoah Gap. 7 miles. Quick walk on a sunny day to Stecoah Gap. Got to the main road and trail magic of brekkie sandwiches on the menu. Yum. Picked up by Nancy at ‘The Hike in’ will slack pack one day then hit the smokies.","Deep Gap

Dingo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662231,"April 6 - Slackpacking from Stecoah Gap to the Fontana Hilton a 15.4 mile day. Had bail out at Yellow Creek but pushed on. Felt tired for sure but glad I made the effort. Going to rain tomorrow so zeroing Friday.April 7 - Glad I decided to zero because it rained all day. Felt good to be lazy in a room. But…April 8 - Woke up to rain but it was supposed to let up. Got dropped off at the Fontana Hilton and started the trek to Mollies Ridge shelter with the hope to go one more along. First thing to go wrong as the buckle on my waist belt half snapped. Fortunately it still held together so decided to press on. If that was the only glitch for the the fine… Nope! Rain never let up and I was soaked and boarderline hyperthermic when I got to the shelter. Squeezed into the shelter got into some dry clothes and my quilt to warm up. Probably had twice the number of folks but we fit and everyone was cozy. Quite a welcome to the Smoky Mountains.April 9- Happy Easter! A cool but sunny day. Mollies Ridge to Derrick Knob shelter. 12 miles. Great to be in the sun drying out. Meeting a good group of folks. Enjoying the chats at shelters and rest stops along the way. Tented as it was a clear night. April 10 - Derrick Knob to Mt Collins Shelter. 13 miles. Passed the 200 mile mark as I crossed Clingmans Dome. Pushed as I wanted to get into Gatlinburg early the next day to see if I could repair my waist strap. Was wary about going hard over a bunch of hills. A long day but I made it. A friend I made on the trail, Jeff, got some bad news about his dad might have to get off to look after him. Will know better when in phone range tomorrow. April 11 Mt Collins to Newfound Gap 5 miles. Woke up early and out of the shelter by 7:30 Glad I did else I would have missed the first free shuttle to Gatlinburg. Got to the NOC outfitters there and they helped me make a fix to the pack. Not 100% but free was good. Did a small resupply and was able to score a great room at the Bearskin lodge for $65 through their referral (instead of $220) Washed clothes, had a big feed at the pizza buffet next door and a nice breakfast the next morning to hit the at 9.April 12 Newfound Gap to Tricornor knob shelter. 15.7 miles. Felt great and pushed out an extra shelter. Could have stopped earlier but glad I didn’t. Caught up with some of the crew I’ve seen before. Nice night in the shelter as the camping areas were very full.A great second week","Stecoah Gap

Dingo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662235,"April 12 Tricorner Knob Shelter to Davenport Gap Shelter 14.6 miles. With the prospect of morning trail magic to Davenport gap we pushed to the last shelter in the Smokies. Had to shelter as there weren’t any tent spots. Met two black snakes who kept the mice away. Found out Smoke Master was deathly afraid of them. The snakes realised they weren’t welcome and slithered away. Nice chats with Silverback and Dozer. Nice group of folks. April 13 Davenport Shelter to Standing Bear Hostel. Woke up and out of the shelter early to get fed. Steak sandwiches, fruit, joy. Met another guy doing the magic from hostel around the bend last year. Crazy small world. Headed off to Standing bear and it started to rain. I had to go in order to get a new gas bottle. Ended up staying. Glad I did as it rained most of the day. Iconic hippie spot on the trail. Quirky and fun.April 14 Standing Bear to Roaring Fork Shelter 15.2 miles. Beautiful walk today. Crossed over Max Patch mountain. Beautiful spot. Decided to camp. Great night till a rain shower at 6am got everything wet. Just enough to make a mess.April 15 Roaring Fork Shelter to Deer Park Mountain Shelter 14.7 miles was prepared to push to Hot Springs NC and have two nights in town. Sadly no room at hiker friendly spots so stopped a few miles out of town. Dried out my gear and had a wonderful chat with Juliet. Really miss her and home. Made some plans for post trail fun. April 16 Hot Springs 3.2 miles. Up and out of the campsite by 8. Quick walk to town. Big brekkie resupply. Now at Elmers Sunnybank inn. Another iconic spot on trail.","Tricorner Knob Shelter
