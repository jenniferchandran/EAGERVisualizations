The NH Peakbagger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661560,"I am at the Manchester Airport in NH. Jean, a friend from the United Divers of NH Scuba Club picked me up at my home. I had my Osprey 65 L backpack all loaded. I weighed the pack with a digital scale at a little over 19 lbs base weight. This is a real good feeling.When I add water to my 3 L Camel Bak water bag, the pack will be heavier, but the weight will go down as I drink water and consume food.It is close to boarding time. I will get ready to leave Manchester for 5 or 6 months. It is a surreal feeling.",,View Entry,"Apr 03, Mon",0
The NH Peakbagger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661585,"My flight arrived at the Atlanta Airport at Oh Dark Hundred. I was a half hour earlier than Oh Dark 30 (aka 12:25 AM or 0025 Zulu). Zulu Time is military time.I rode an airport train to baggage claim. I got my backpack, which is one of my most important items for this thru-hike second only to my cell phone and my cash and credit card.I texted my shuttle driver Ron to let him know I am in town.Another 7 or 8 hours, I will buy a ticket to take the MARTA Red Line train to the Sandy Spring Station where I will meet my shuttle driver at the REI outdoor store.It is safe in the airport. I constantly see police patrolling the area.There are food courts although they are closed for the night. When they open, I will get breakfast.I asked Ron if it was safe for me to take the train at 4:45 AM to the REI where he will meet me. He advised me to wait at the airport and take a later train during daylight.I am one step closer to getting to the trail (AT). I can already feel the trepidation from when I met my ride at my house to go to Manchester Airport to going to Chicago to arriving in Atlanta.Wow! It is surreal, but it is real.",,View Entry,"Apr 04, Tue",0
The NH Peakbagger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661648,"Hiked up the stairways up past the Amicalola Falls and tent camped at Nimble Will Gap on 4/4.4/5 Thru-hiker Gilbert the Gentleman Hiker tented near me.He deceived me that he had a weather report that a destructive, extremely dangerous weather front was moving in and insisted I go back out with him. We went to the Amicalola Falls State Park Lodge where he wanted us to stay. It cost $240.00 a night and $188.00 for Veteran’s.I ditched him after I searched out weather data. I called my first shuttle driver Ron to come and get me quickly. He got me back in the trail by a Forest Service road. That cost me $75.00 for that bail out.I finally made it to the Springer Mountain Shelter. All of the hikers were in tents. I stayed in the shelter and had it to myself.I heard owls hooting after first dark. This morning they started in again at 5:00 AM.I saw only one mouse in the shelter. I left all of my backpack pockets open to avoid mouse damage.","

The NH Peakbagger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661870,We had a very bad rain storm. My Eastern Mountain Sport rain suit soaked up a lot of water. Two thru-hikers lent me clothes until I got to Neel Gap where I went to the Mountain Crossing Outfitter. They sold me a Gortex rain jacket and a 20 degree Western Mountaineering sleeping bagMy light weight 50 degree bag was not warm enough. I was dangerously hypothermic. I had to boil water and put in Smart Water bottles into my sleeping bag to come out of it. I was really scared being in a remote mountainous location.My clothes are all dried out.Tonight I am at Whitley Gap Shelter. I am here alone. I thought other thru-hikers said I would meet them here. This place is 1.2 miles off the A.T. and down the backside of a mountain. There’s plenty of water and a privy.,"

The NH Peakbagger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663956,"I got a ride from The Refuge Hostel to the trail head at Highway 19E everything was $20.I hiked through old farm land. It was really nice. I suddenly came upon the marker made of small pine cones that made the 400-mile marker.Joneses Fall was unique. The hiking today was more rolling up and downs. It was steeper climbing to go over summits to the Moreland Gap Shelter.Tonight in the shelter, I hear owls.Tomorrow I plan to hike 14 miles. I will hike to Bob People’s hostel. It is only a $5 donation.Bob People’s is a legendary trail builder maintenance worker. I was told I should meet him. The comments in the Far Out app say the same thing.

The NH Peakbagger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664019,"After leaving the Moreland Gab Shelter, I stopped in at the rustic Kincora Hiker Hostel owned by legendary trail builder Bob Peoples. He wasn’t in; so I charged my electronics, fell asleep on a couch with his cat sleeping on my stomach.
Bob didn’t show up, so I left a donation and continued my hike.
I met three men camping by a river, they invited me in when the learned I was a Thru-hiker going to Maine.
I cooked two hot dogs, drank a cup of coffee and ate other things.
I came to the famous Laurel Falls. 24 people have drowned there from being pulled under by the hydraulics of the falls. 
I saw a harmless Corn Snake on the trail; that was neat.
I couldn’t find a shelter with water source for the miles I needed for Maine, so I contacted the Boots Off Hiker Hostel for a reservation for a tent site for the night.","Moreland Gab Shelter

The NH Peakbagger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664071,"Left Boots Off Hiker Hostel after breakfast and crossed the road to hike around Watauga Lake before passing the massive Watauga Dam.
While hiking in the mountains, I saw an all black snake with a white under belly. Dont know what type it was. It was close to 3 1/2 feet long and seemed stoic. 
There were very few people on the trail because they went to Hiker Days in Damascus, VA. It was a lonely feeling.
At 7:25 PM I saw a rather large black bear 150 yards from me; it was on a ridge upwind of me. I was downwind of it; it didn’t see me.
I gave a loud yell to scare it and started barking like a baying dog. The bear jumped up and spun around and took off running.
At 7:40 PM while still hiking, I heard and saw bushes moving 100 yards from me. I gave out a loud yell and started baying like a hound dog.
The bear jumped up and whirled around and took off ruining but stopped. I yelled some more, and it was gone.
I was 2.6 miles from Iron Mount Shelter and started to run.
I met a solo male hiker. He hesitated at my story but decided to continue on. He said he had seen one recently and that the bears were out moving around.
I told him I had seen a hiker pitching a tent 2 miles down trail. The next shelter was 7 miles away. I don’t know where he was going unless he was going to night hike.
I had my headlamp on as I neared the shelter and saw the eye shine of three deer.
I am not sure if I saw two bears or if the second sighting was of a bear stalking me? Both were large and the same size.","Watauga Lake

They said they do it once a year. They were also trail maintainers for the Virginia Tech Outting Club.The lady, Sunny Side Up, said she would get an identification for the large black snake with a large segmented head that I had taken a picture of in a tree.Everyone says it is a Rat Snake until I blow up the picture showing the very large head; they almost all go silent. Two Thru-hikers independently said they believed it was a very dangerous snake that was not from the South.I am getting closer to 700 miles.I am now in Central Virginia.","War Spur Shelter
