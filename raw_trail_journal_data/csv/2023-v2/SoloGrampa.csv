Just did a 20,21,and a 20 (miles) in a row. Been meeting up with a lot of folks I've met on the trail. Me and ""Joker"" are probably gonna part ways tomorrow. He's slack packing today. I caught up to my adopted grand daughters from. New Zealand, but now they're gone again.Â  Just ran into ""Easy Ryder""and Jewles in town. I'll be leaving 13 lbs. heavier in the morning. Had a nice meal at the diner today. I sat with a couple that invited me to their table.

I've put in 4 good days since. The ponies on Mount Roger's and Grayson Highlands were the highlight of my hike so far. I saw about 30. One came right down the trail, and I scratched his head. I'm in Marion VA. right now at a hospital trying to get some tests done. I've lost way too much weight, and I'm trying to find out why. I'm doing good on mileage. I broke 500 two days ago.

There was 7 or8 of them playing that Tennessee mtn. music. They had all string instruments. They sounded great, they fed me, and just before I left, I couldn't resist kicking up my ""heels"" a bit!

They were about 30"" long, and when you agitate them,they strike at you, and they make there tail twicht like a rattle snake. It's been hot during the day, but still cold at night.

I repaired my sleeping pad, but I got some new leaks! It goes flat in about a half hr. I haven't got a good night's sleep in 5 days! The second morning out of Pearisburg, I encountered 6 feral Billy goats on the trail! They pretty much mauled me. They try to lick every exposed skin area for the salt. They were professionals! 4 infront of me occupying me, and 2 inback picking my pockets. One of them yanked one of my $45.00 gloves out,and took off with it. I ran after him, but couldn't keep up with my pack on,so I dropped my pack, and grabbed my trekking pole and chased him down. If he didn't drop it, we were having Goat loin for supper over a spirit!Â  The last 4 days have been pretty tuff. I know I say that a lot, but they really are. Lots of steep rugged climbs. The last 2 days boarders on ""class 3"" mountain climbing. Some fabulous views. Everything's in bloom down here in VA. The woods actually have a perfume smell to them. Saw another huge snake yesterday,Â  about 4'. I'd like to again thank the people on the trail that said they'd donate to my campaign, and did. Like ""ginger goat"", andÂ  ""bat 6"", .I haven't checked my web page lately, but I'm sure there is more. They need to leave a comment, so I know who it is. I've got a third of the trail done as of tonight. That's hard to believe. Time Flys! These mountains I've been climbing this week are amazing. There's boulders on top as big as a bus! Stacked on top of each other. To think that all this was thrashed up out of the ocean millions of years ago is hard to imagine.

Anyway, in my last entry, I meant to tell you about the whip-o-wills. My air mattress was leaking, and would deflate in a half hour,Â  so I wasn't getting much sleep. One morning I was awake at 3am,so I decided to break camp. I was hiking by 4am. It's quite different hiking with a headlamp. Anyway I saw a Brite almost fluorescent dot up ahead of me, then it was gone! I just brushed it off as my eyes playing tricks on me! Soon after I heard a whip-o-will call out. I haven't heard one since I was a kid! There used to be a few in the swamp behind Link Perviers house. Then I saw one hop up on a log with my headlamp, and it's eyes were bright orange, just glowing! Being a bird that's active at night, that makes sense. Just like a deer, they have eye shine. Anyway it was good toÂ  here them again. This gs have been going good until last night, when a big storm moved in. I was stuck, and had to stealth camp on a ridge. We got about 2-3 inches of rain. Everything got soaked, and all the brooks and streams flash flooded! I had to Ford a stream at 7 this morning that had turned into a raging river! It was well above my knees, and if I would have slipped, it would have been curtains for me! So I'm at a hostel now, regrouping, and drying things out. I spent a night in Daleville VA. about 3 days ago,and got a new air mattress.Â  Still putting in some big mileage days. Gotta make up for these short days. But you gotta have um every now and then.

That was another milestone for me. I'll be a happy guy when I pass 1100! It was freezing cold last night, and I got rained on again about 4 pm. so I was quite wet when I reached a shelter. It was spitting snow in the morning. I hope we have some better weather soon, as it lifts your morale. Craig Twohey is a couple weeks ahead of me trying to finish his hike from last year. He told me that I was going to love VA. I'm not feeling it yetðŸ˜’! WaynesboroÂ  VA. is just a day out, but I think I'm gonna push through.

Same excuse, low,battery, no service, no time, etc. Anyway, about a week ago my brother Mike was driving up from Florida. We had to figure out how,and where to meet. Elkton VA. was are only chance. I needed to hike 67 miles in 3 days to make it happen, and still get out of the woods in time to have a good visit. I booked a motel room, and was out on the edge of highway 33 by 2:05 the 3rd day. We had a great visit. Went out for a good meal, then went out for breakfast. I was back on the trail by 11:30 the next day. I had a food drop waiting for me in Luray VA. so that was my next stop. I was gonna take 3 days to get there and give myself a little break, but then I got a good pace going,and decided to power through, and do it in 2. The hiking has been moderate in some stretches, and really tuff in others, but I'm still making good time. I passed the 1,000 mile marker yesterday! That was a milestone. Yesterday I left a nice dry shelter, and went out into the pouring rain! Hiked 19.9 miles.I was completely soaked when I got to the next shelter. Got up this morning, put all my wet clothes, socks, hiking shoes, and hit the trail. The morning was horrible. I was in the section they call the roller-coaster. The rocks are horrible climbing up the mountains. The afternoon wasn't as bad, and my feet finally dried, but I had it in my head that I wanted to make it to""Harpers Ferry"" West Virginia, which was a 23+ mile day. I'm gonna chill out a little bit in the morning. Go to the ATC center and register, and get a pic. This is the unofficial 1/2way pt. (We're actually 75 miles away). I'll hopefully be back on trail by noon. I'm out in front of most of the friends I've made right now. Maybe if I goof off for awhile tomorrow they'll catch up.

My balance was off for the rest of the day,Â  and I had a headache. When I was picking myself back up, I noticed my lifestyle water bottle was missing. I thought it ripped off my shoulder strap when I fell. Come to find out, I left it back at the shelter where I got spring water, which I had to go .25 of a mile down hill to get. The shelter was about a mile back, but I had to go get it. Bummer!! That cost me 2 miles today. I forgot to tell you yesterday I almost got shot while walking the trail. Turns out there's a target range over the hill, and some nimrod must have shot over the birm! When I heard it pass through left to right, I saw a piece of branch with leaves fall, and heard it hit two more branches on my right. I yelled some obscenities as loud as I could, and boogies down the trail! The bullet passed about 6 to 8 yds. In front of me!Â ",,View Entry,"May 11, Thu",0
