Joe Wawrzaszek,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660075,"Ground Hogs day,  My how time flies.  18 days to blast off. I first learned of the Appalachian Trail about the same time Neal Armstrong uttered the iconic phrase  “one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind”.  As a nine year old, hiking the Appalachian trail or being an astronaut were both feasible paths my life could take.  Right?  Turns out wearing glasses excludes you from the astronaut gig.  One childhood dream down.  
  My sense of wanderlust comes naturally.  I was blessed with parents who liked to travel.  Nothing exotic, just load up the Dodge for a 2 week summer road trip around this great country of ours.  Sightseeing by day, hoteling it by night.  To me it seemed anticlimactic to follow up a day in Yellowstone with a night in the Holiday Inn.  Ending the day sleeping under the stars with the gentle crackle of campfire as background noise seemed a more complete picture.  But, camping wasn’t something my family did.  Dad said he’d slept on the ground enough in WW2.  No more tents for him.  Hotel lodging meant restaurant eating, and Mom was on board with that.  “It’s not a vacation if you have to cook”.  Don’t get me wrong, I have fond memories of those trips, but my appetite for the complete outdoors experience was far from fulfilled.  
  My desire for the camping experience led me to the local library where I devoured what they offered on camping.  Specifically backpacking.  Fully self contained adventure, not unlike the astronauts going to the moon.  One particular book spoke of the Appalachian Trail as a backpackers nirvana, with thru hiking the whole thing it as the pinnacle of the sport. The astronauts of backpacking if you will.  Sign me up!
  Fifty plus years have passed. Lots of childhood dreams have come true.  I have a wonderful family.  I was lucky to run an enjoyable and successful business.  Now in retirement, I feel very privileged to have the opportunity to attempt a thru hike the Appalachian Trail.  I can’t begin to express the gratitude I feel towards my loving wife and family for their support in fulfilling this childhood dream.  To let me be that astronaut .  18 days to blast off.  Launchpad, Springer Mountain. Then, one small step for man, then 5 million more…..   Destination Mt. Katahdin.",,View Entry,"Feb 06, Mon",0
Joe Wawrzaszek,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660076,"A lot has been written about gear choices for thru hikes.  I’ve probably read most of it.  I’m a bit of a gear head. I like stuff.  My loving wife half jokingly refers to our storage space as REI.  She’s not far off.   I’m also prone to overthinking my plan of attack.  Nothing wrong with being prepared, right?  Researching a new project is part of the fun.  The hunt, if you will.  Searching out the thing or method that will yield the best results.  At the very least, the gear hunt allows you to begin your trip in your imagination well before the actual commencement date.  Double the fun.  
  I’ve backpacked for a few years doing multiple week long trips. However, this is my first thru-hike.  My equipment choices listed below are the result of those trips.  I feel I’ve found a balance of weight, functionality, and comfort in my gear choices.  Living in Wisconsin, I’ve found that I can handle the cold better than I can the heat.  Winter trips have been a staple part of my hiking diet.  Guessing that I’ve spent over 100 nights out below freezing and dozens below 0 F.  I’m more comfortable with ice than I am with bugs…
So here's the list.  
Pack.  Sierra Designs Flux-Capacitor 60. Gen 1
Tent.  Tarptent Rainbow II Li
Sleep system.  North Face Hightail 3 15 deg.  I switch to a Katabatic Palisade 30 
                         Thermarest X-Therm lg. Pad
Cook system.  Soto Windmaster, Olicamp XTS pot, long handle Ti spork.
Misc. Platypus Quickdraw filter and Cnoc 2l bag.
Nitecore NB10000 battery.
Nitecore NU25 headlamp
Six Moons Umbrella
MontBell rain Jacket
OR Helium Pant
Topo Terraventure 3 shoes
Garmin Inreach Mini 2
Other various items round out the kit with a base weight around 17 pounds.  This weight will drop about 2-3 pounds as warm weather gear is substituted in. 
None of the above are brand new.  Through trial and error they have all earned their place on this journey and will hopefully summit Katahdin with me sometime late summer early fall.  I have confidence in these items.  I also feel there is only one gear item that will make or break this trip. 
That's the gear between my ears.",,View Entry,"Feb 06, Mon",0
