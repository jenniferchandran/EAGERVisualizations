Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625648,"Spike and I had an absolutely splendid time on the Appalachian Trail (AT) last year.  Unfortunately, after 1258.8 miles on the AT, the soles of my feet developed painful sores.  As I was limping the last few miles, I decided that if at all possible we would return the next year to finish the last 933.2 miles.  Well, now it is next year, and we are putting into place our plans for returning. 

Our original plan was to thru-hike the entire AT with a non-traditional flip-flop in 2019.  We would start in Damascus, VA when I finished up my contract with my previous employer, late-ish May.  I would be joined by one of my nieces, a 17-year-old with a black belt.  She was referred to in this journal as Spike’s Cousin, or SC for short.  We would hike north to Maine, hopefully summiting Katahdin in late September.  Then we would get a ride back to Damascus, finishing the rest of the trail southbound around the beginning of November. 

We were able to begin hiking on May 18, 2019 in Damascus, VA.  However, as thru-hiking has want to do, things did not go as planned.  I would say I never developed what people refer to as “trail legs.”  I got a little faster and gained some endurance as I hiked, but anything above 15 miles a day never really worked for me.  So, in mid-July when I was still in Virginia and melting in the summer heat, I was not looking forward to hiking the rocks of Pennsylvania while it was so hot.  I started thinking, where do I want to be in August: Pennsylvania or Maine?  And where would I rather be in October: Pennsylvania or Maine?  I called my retired parents and asked them if they would be interested in driving SC and I to Maine.  And they said they had never been to Maine, and they would take us!  It was a couple of weeks before they could pick us up (they are a very busy retired couple), so we continued north until July 28th when they picked us up at the parking lot where the AT crosses PA Route 501. 

On the 29th we drove up to Millinocket, and then SC, Spike, and I summited Katahdin on July 30th.  We finished up Baxter State Park on July 31st, and then started the 100 Mile Wilderness on the first day of August. The plan then was to hike south back to PA 501, skip down to Damascus, and then finish as planned at Springer.  We made it through Maine and then plans changed again.  Just before we entered the White Mountains, SC decided she was ready to go home.  She would finish the Whites and then head home while Spike and I hiked on.   That seemed like it might be the last change of plans, but 11 days after SC left the trail, Spike’s Dad met up with us and my feet were done.

Anyway, all of that is to say Spike and I have 933.2 miles left: Mad Tom Notch near Manchester Center, VA to PA 501 – 462.9 miles – plus Damascus, VA to Springer Mountain – 470.3 miles.  The plan is to hike these two sections southbound (sobo).  This will probably take us about 12 weeks, and we are planning to start in early August to try to avoid the hottest part of the summer and be off the trail before it gets terribly cold.  However, as we learned in 2019, plans have a tendency to change without warning.",,View Entry,"Jan 08, Wed",0
Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625781,"One thing I never really posted about last year was gear.  I think I want to write a little more about that as I prepare to go back to the trail.  Today I will just talk about what is considered the big three: pack, shelter, and sleep system. 

The Pack 

My backpack is an Osprey Aura AG 50.  My parents wanted to get me a graduation present a few years ago, so this is what I decided on.  A few confessions: 1) I was motivated to get this pack after it won an editor’s choice award from Backpacker Magazine.  2) I didn’t try any other packs.   I later bought a Gregory Jade 28 daypack in purple (my favorite color), so if I had known that was a possibility for a backpacking pack, I probably would have gone that direction.  3) It is not a pack that is popular with the ultralight crowd.  AG stands for anti-gravity, which means it has a robust suspension system for heavy loads.  However, the suspension system itself adds a significant amount of weight.  It also can be noisy.  However, I never had any soreness or pain related to the pack which was a huge improvement over my previous pack. 

Fun fact: SC had the same pack as me.  That’s right, same make, model, year, and color.  They were both 50’s (Osprey also makes the Aura AG  65).  The only difference was that she had a size medium and I had a small.  We got the packs independent of each other. 

The Shelter 

Spike’s Dad and I got an REI Half Dome 2 tent back in 2013, I believe.  As I was prepping to hike the trail, I got a NEMO Hornet Elite 1P.  However, when SC joined us, I went with the Half Dome which was pretty heavy.  When she got off the trail, I changed from the Half Dome to the Hornet.  I like that the Hornet is semi-freestanding, has a separate rainfly, and doesn’t rely on my trekking poles while still being reasonably lightweight. I plan on using the Hornet this year on the trail. 

The Sleep System 

The sleep system I used in 2019 on the AT was a sleeping bag, a backpacking pillow, and an inflatable sleeping pad for sleep with a mylar blanket for backup when it got really cold.  My bag is a NEMO Rhapsody 30, and Spike’s Dad has the men’s version of the same bag, the Nocturne 30.  I don’t believe NEMO still makes these bags.  The Rhapsody is insolated with hydrophobic down.  While I have had problems using down pillows due to allergies, I haven’t had any issues with this bag.  A 30-degree bag worked well for me.  I had picked up a Sea to Summit Thermolite Reactor Compact Plus sleeping bag liner just before I got off trail to add some warmth to my bag as cold weather approached and did not use it. 

Most people see pillows as unnecessary weight.  I love my pillow.  It’s a Slumberjack synthetic pillow I think I bought back in 2002.  One side has fabric similar to a regular pillowcase and the other side is flannel.  The flannel side is wonderfully soft.  Even though my sleeping bag has a pocket to keep the pillow in place, I don’t put it in there because I prefer to have the flannel next to my skin than the nylon of the sleeping bag.  The pillow is kind of lumpy now, so I am planning to unstuff it and pull apart all the fluff before I get back on the trail. 

My sleeping pad is a Therm-A-Rest UberLite.  I love that it is very small, very light, and as comfortable as I can imagine something that small and light could be.  I actually was less bothered by the daily ritual of inflating my sleeping pad than I thought I would be. In order to be so small and lightweight, the material appears to be really thin and fragile, but so far [knocking on wood], I haven’t had any issues with leaks.  It is longer than I need and narrower than I would like, but the dimensions seem to be standard for sleeping pads.  Backpacking gear seems to be made primarily for tall, skinny guys, not short, curvy women.",,View Entry,"Jan 15, Wed",0
Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625960,"Last year I went through three different pairs of shoes on the trail, averaging just over 400 miles per pair.  Anyway, if you get me started on shoes, I get very passionate because I feel like no one makes shoes I really like (or stopped making the shoes I did like), and I can get angry about it.  Shoes are very personal things, so if you are reading this because you are trying to figure out what you would want to wear, just be aware that your mileage (literally) may vary.

 

New Balance

I love New Balance running shoes.  I am a runner and I have worn 860s for the last 5 years or so.  Before getting on the trail I went to several stores and tried on trail runners and had not found anything that fit well. So, I decided to go to a New Balance store and say, “I need 860s with a trail running outsole.” The guy working there said he had exactly what I wanted, but they didn’t carry it in my size, so I would have to order them.  I came back 2 weeks later and tried on the ordered pair: New Balance Hierros in a women’s 8.5 wide.  The woman I worked with that day could see the disappointment on my face.  These were very heavy and stiff.  They seemed more like hiking boots than trail runners.  She went to the back and brought out a pair of shoes that had been returned and were on clearance: Leadville 100s in a men’s 8.  They were perfect except for one problem: the model had been discontinued.

I bought both pairs and then wore them around to get a feel for them over the next few weeks.  The Leadvilles were great.  The Hierros destroyed my heals.  I tried to return the Hierros, but the store wouldn’t take them back because they had been worn.  I tried to find the Leadvilles online, but I couldn’t find any in my size.  I began the trail in the Leadvilles and wore them from Damascus to Waynesboro, VA, about 380 miles.

 

Hoka One One

One of the things that I learned from the Leadville experience was that a men’s regular width is a women’s wide.  So, even if a model doesn’t come in a women’s wide, I might be able to wear the men’s – the only problem is that most stores do not carry men’s shoes that small.  I had tried the Hoka Challenger at one point, which does come in a women’s wide, but the tongue seemed very stiff and hurt the front of my ankle.  I had heard such great things about Hoka’s though, so I decided to try their Speedgoat in a men’s 8 because it did not come in a women’s wide.  I ordered them from a running store near the trail.  However, when I went to try them on, they were too entirely too narrow.  I mean, it wasn’t even close. 

 

Topo

After the Hokas didn’t work out, I went to another running store near the trail to see if they had anything that could work.  The store was a huge fan of Topos, and the closest thing they had in my size was a pair of men’s MT-3s in a size 9.  They were way too big, but new shoes seemed like a better idea than continuing in old shoes that had nearly 400 miles on them (I tend to change out my running shoes at about 250 miles).  I met someone in Shenandoah National Park who had gotten aftermarket insoles and then ended up needing to get bigger shoes, so when we got to Front Royal, a little more than 100 miles later, I bought a pair of Oboz insoles.  This did help them fit a little better.  Also, they were zero-drop shoes that had very little cushion or protection, so the insoles helped with that as well.

I wore them from Waynesboro, VA to PA-501, about 345 miles.  I then wore them through the 100 Mile Wilderness, so I put about 450 miles total on them and about 350 on the Oboz insoles.

 

Altra

When my parents came out to take SC and me up to Maine, we stopped by an REI in Connecticut.  I was determined to find something better than the Topos.  I asked what shoes they had in stock in a women’s 9 wide or men’s 8.  The woman working the shoe area said, “What about Altras?  They are wide.”  I had heard this a lot, but every Altra I had tried on (including men’s sizes), while they had plenty of room in the toebox, were not wide enough through the instep.  I told her this.  She brought out a pair of Altra Lone Peaks anyway.  I tried them on so that I could show the clerk that they were too narrow.  Guess what, they fit!

Like Topos, Altras are zero-drop and lack much cushion, so I went a size up and bought another pair of Oboz insoles.  I wore them up Katahdin because I didn’t want to trust my Topos that already had 345 miles on them and also wanted to make sure they would work before I replaced them, but I then went back to the Topos through the 100 Mile Wilderness because they still had some life left in them.  After the 100MW, SC’s parents came for a visit, and they brought my practically new Altras with them.

One problem I had with the Topos was that the toe cap came unglued and would often catch on things and trip me up.  I had the same issue with the Altras – the toe cap came unglued the very first day I wore them!

Anyway, I wore the Lone Peaks with the Oboz insoles from Monson, ME until I got off the trail in Manchester Center, VT, about 430 miles.

 

Brooks

Fortunately, not everyone has shoe drama.  Spike’s Cousin used Brooks Calderas without any problems.  She used two pairs, going about 600 miles on each pair.  I could not find any Brooks trail runners in women’s wide.  I did try on a pair of men’s Cascadias, and like the Hoka Speedgoats, they were too narrow.

 

This Year’s PlanMy feet were what got me off the trail, and I’m still not sure to what extent my shoes were responsible.  I did have a podiatrist recommend getting insoles made for people with diabetes.  I would like to try some.  I had bought a new pair of Altra Lone Peaks just before I got off the trail, and I have been wearing them when I go hiking or when I run (I’m training for a half marathon) if I am concerned that the sidewalks are going to be snowy and icy.  My current plan is to start with these, and because these shoes already will have some miles on them, replace pretty early, maybe about 200 miles in.  In the meantime, I will keep my eyes open for other possibilities.  I recently saw the new New Balance Hierros, and at least from the pictures, they seem to have less of a structured heal, so maybe they are closer to what I am looking for.",,View Entry,"Jan 27, Mon",0
Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627118,"I had thought at the beginning of the year I would update my 2020 AT journal once a week.  Since then, I have been hiking a lot and it has been hard to just keep up with my North Country Trail journal.  I have 6 hikes from 2019 I still need to document!  I’m also spending way too much time on Twitter and reading the journal entries from other Trail Journals hikers. 

The last couple of weeks have been . . . interesting. I am glad I can still get out and walk, run, and hike while doing the social distancing thing.  I am also glad that I have been slowly acquiring hiking food – in the event that we are unable to get to the grocery store we are covered for at least a couple of months with dehydrated meals and instant oatmeal.  I probably should be using my Kula cloth given the recent runs on toilet paper, but we buy a case of TP at a time and have at least 6 months’ worth in the basement. 

I have been reading the Trail Journals entries for those who were planning on hiking this year.  Now that I have done more than half of the trail, I sometimes see people who, in their pre-hike entries, write some not-so-accurate things.  I want to “sign” their “guest books” and set them straight, but I want to keep guest book entries positive, and I don’t want to turn into this guy: https://xkcd.com/386/.  So far, I haven’t heard anything that I think could lead to death or significant disability, so I have just kept out of it.  Anyway, last month Gorp-Gobbler had an entry about trail veterans who were planning to go out on the trail this year: https://www.trailjournals.com/journal/entry/626132.  He gave me a shout-out!  If you are new to long-distance hiking, I recommend reading the journals like those he highlights. 

I “saw” a number of people start the trail this spring and then a few days in announce that they were quitting, even before the whole COVID-19 pandemic put a wrench in things.  Most often they cite “the trail wasn’t what I expected” as their reason for getting off the trail.  Here’s what to expect: it’s hard!  As hard as you think it will be, it will be five times harder.  It will rain.  It will be cold.  It will be hot.  There are bugs and bears and annoying people.  It is both physically difficult and psychologically difficult.  And you might have to stop because you are injured or sick or there’s a wildfire or a global pandemic.  Prepare to be flexible and make wise decisions.  Don’t just keep going because of pride.That being said, I know COVID-19 has messed up a lot of people’s plans.  A lot of places along the trail are closing, and the Appalachian Trial Conservancy is recommending that hikers postpone their hikes.  My plan for this year was to do a LASH (long-@$$ section hike) to finish up the 933.2 miles I didn’t get to last year.  I would start in early August and finish in early November, which would keep me from the worst heat of summer, and I would get to see the arrival of fall colors.  However, I recognize that might not happen. I might have to postpone until next year or do a smaller section.  I will do what I can as a responsible citizen to keep others safe and healthy even if that means putting off this hike longer.  That being said, this situation is sad, and grief is an appropriate reaction to loss (I say to myself as well as to others).",,View Entry,"Mar 19, Thu",0
Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637344,"I haven’t been very good about keeping up with this particular journal.  It started off as the journal where I was going to document in 2020 completing the remaining 933.2 miles of the Appalachian Trail that Spike and I did not do in 2019.  I was also going to write some entries about gear and other things I had learned from my first 1258.8 miles on the AT.  However, with COVID and everything, I had to change my hiking plans, again.  When it became clear that I would not be able to get back to the trail in 2020, I changed the year for this journal to 2021.  As of May 2021, I don’t have any plans for revisiting the AT this year, but I will wait until that is certain before I change it again.  I guess that is one of the things I learned from my 2019 hike: you can make plans, but you have to always be flexible.

This is the 2nd anniversary of the attempt Spike, Spike’s Cousin, and I made to hike the AT.  On the anniversary of getting off the trail, I posted this on my 2019 journal: 
https://www.trailjournals.com/...

In the last 8ish months I have started a new job and gained back the rest of the weight I lost on the trail.  I also have been fully vaccinated for COVID!  (Spike has not, but that’s okay because it’s not a rhinovirus.)  Now that I am working, I won’t be able to take the 2-3 months off to finish the remaining miles in one go (at least in the next couple of years), but I still want to finish eventually and maybe even attempt another thru-hike (maybe 2029 or 2030?).  I still dream at night about being on the trail.

Meanwhile, Spike and I are working on the North Country Trail.  We’ve done about 365 miles so far in Michigan since 2016 and have plans to complete more than 85 new miles this year (we will do more than that in total because there will be some repeating of sections of trail we have done in the past).  Feel free to read our Trail Journals entries for that trail as well.  This year we are also visiting every park in Grand Rapids, MI, which we are documenting on Twitter (@hikewithspike).

I continue to try to reflect on and live out what I learned on the trail.  I came away with the conviction that I should make travel and experiences a priority and become more minimalistic in terms of clothes and other possessions.  I try to go hiking or backpacking whenever I have the chance.  While I am working, I have limited myself to 1.5 days a week for the time being, which allows me to keep up on my skills while also giving my best to my clients.  Spike and I have encouraged Spike’s Dad to take all of his vacation days this year.  Last month we spent a week hiking around Utah and Nevada.  Next month we are spending a week on Lake Michigan with family.  COVID has only reinforced my belief that life is short, and we should get out there and see what we can do about completing that bucket list.",,View Entry,"May 18, Tue",0
Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659775,"Well, it’s official – or at least it’s as official as it can be 8 months out – Spike and I are returning to the AT this year!  I have blocked out 4 weeks of work beginning in September and plan to spend about a month on the trail.  The plan is to start from where we left off at Mad Tom Notch outside of Manchester Center, VT and see how far south we can get.  The goal is to get at least to Clarence Fahnestock State Park in New York, although we would like to get Bear Mountain State Park if we can.  If we can get farther, great!There’s not much else to say at this point.  We will be attempting the #hike100NCT challenge again this year, so we will have a separate Trail Journal for those hikes (I also need to finish up the entries from 2022 for the NCT).",,View Entry,"Jan 07, Sat",0
Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668577,"Our plan to go back to the AT is still on.  I have four weeks off work, 3 resupply boxes laid out, and a new rain jacket purchased.  None of Spike’s Cousins will be joining us but Spike’s Dad will shuttle us for some slackpacking for the first few days.  We are hiking toward where I used to live in New York and are looking forward to meeting up with a good friend there to do some hiking on her birthday in early October.

I am using a lot of the same gear I used back in 2019.  My big three (pack, tent, sleeping bag) are unchanged.  I do have a new stove since then.  I was using an old MSR Whisper Lite International, and I now have a proper canister stove.  The biggest change has been to my electronics.  I now have a battery bank that plugs directly into an outlet, so I don’t have to have a separate wall adapter. Not only have I purchased a new phone in the last 4 years, I am also using AirPods and an Apple Watch now.

I will be posting here with daily reports, but they will be a few days late.  This is partly for security and because it takes me a minute to write and post.  I still haven’t mastered uploading pictures from my phone, so many entries will not have pictures associated with entries when I do not have computer access.  Check back in mid-October to see a picture from each day.  I will also be posting pictures to Twitter (I know, I refuse to use the new name): @hikewithspike",,View Entry,"Sep 02, Sat",0
