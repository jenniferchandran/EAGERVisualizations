Quiet Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619217,"It supposedly takes ~5,000,000 steps to thru-hike the Appalachian Trail.  And every hiker is likely familiar with the Chinese proverb: ""A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.""  Of course, the AT is about 2,200 miles; philosophically then, the journey may begin with more than a single step.  The 5 million steps are actual physical steps; but the journey really begins with a lot of mental steps before one even physically passes that first white blaze.  The physical journey typically takes between five and seven months.  The mental journey may last decades before and even after the thru-hike.  The first step for me was probably in 1974 or 1975, when I first learned about the concept of long distance hiking after reading the first edition of Colin Fletcher's seminal book, ""The Complete Walker.""  I was a weekend backpacker as a teenager, but that book deeply ingrained the desire to complete a long distance hike. I do not remember exactly when, but at some point during that time frame, I first stepped foot on the Appalachian Trail near Hawk Mountain, PA.  Then the oft-heard refrain, ""Life intervenes,"" conspired to divert the journey.  That is not to say the diversion was a bad thing.  College, a career, and a family offered new adventures and new life goals.  There were even plenty of hiking and car-camping trips with my wife and children.  Living and traveling in Europe for more than 30-plus years were a once-in-a-lifetime journey in itself.  And a 30-year Army career offered so many opportunities to carry a rucksack and sleep on the ground than at times I care to remember.  But from time to time, the thru-hiking dream rises from the depths of my consciousness like a mountain rises out of the mist.  In mid-February, we spent a great weekend exploring vineyards, breweries, and distilleries based out of a bed-and-breakfast in Lovingston, Virginia in Nelson County.  Forty-five miles of the AT pass through Nelson County, including along the Blue Ridge Parkway and the well-known Rockfish Gap crossing.  Our first night, we ate at the Devil’s Backbone Base Camp and I drank a brew called Mile 842, named for the AT milepost.  The beast was awakened.  The next day we headed north to visit a lavender farm and vineyard near Harrisonburg.  We passed through the Rockfish Gap and stopped in Waynesboro, VA to visit an antique mall across the street from Ming’s Garden.  Having read a lot of trail journals in the past, I could not help but imagine what it would be like to be visiting Waynesboro as a thru-hiker.  I haven’t ever really shared this thru-hike obsession with my wife.  To be honest, I doubt she would really be on board with the idea of me spending six months on the trail.  At some point, I will have to confront the beast – the trail, not my wife.  The question is how to take that precipitous step with her and broach the subject.  The Class of 2027 is the current mark on the wall.  That seems like plenty of time to convince my wife that this is a good idea! And plenty of time to prepare physically and plan logistically.  It may not be the first step of my AT journey, but it certainly is a giant and critical step.

Quiet Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619239,"In two weeks, I will do my first true Appalachian Trail section hike!  I have been reading a lot of trail journals and frequently the phrase “the trail provides” has been used when a hiker realizes that they need a little push, reassurance, or encouragement to get over a physical or mental obstacle and somehow something happens or someone happens along to provide that little bit of needed inspiration.  I am a skeptic by nature and believe more in coincidence than “magic.”  On the other hand, karma is in the eye of the believer and sometimes you just have to believe.  A few months ago, I casually mentioned the idea of hiking the AT to my 27-year old son.  Matt and I have never backpacked together.  We have day-hiked a few times, including along the AT in the Shenandoah National Park, while car camping when he was a kid.  He also accompanied me as teenager on several day hikes with World War II Yugoslav partisan and military veterans in the mountains of Slovenia, including a snowy hike up and back down Mount Krn on November 11th for a World War I commemoration.  Since then, he has hiked and backpacked himself a bit with friends.  So, when he texted me a few days after returning from our European trip to ask how I would feel about taking a 2.5-day trip on the Appalachian Trail, I was quite surprised.  Of course, I immediately agreed that it’s a great idea!  Although, I wasn’t sure what his mother, my wife, would think of the idea.  At first, the idea seemed like pure serendipity.  But was it?  Maybe it’s trail karma.  I’m still not in the greatest hiking shape; even though I have been jogging a bit in order to get back into running shape.  And for over a year now, I’ve been taking daily dose of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug for a case of bursitis/arthritis in my left hip.  Diagnosed two years ago, the pain in my hip would not let me walk more than 10 feet without being almost unbearable and was constant.  After physical therapy and starting the anti-inflammatory, the pain is now only occasional and very mild.  If I am going to be walking a lot, I also have a prescription narcotic-like pain reliever to use as needed.  During the trip to Spain and Greece, my wife and I walked a lot around the cities and archeological sites, including the Mount Olympus day hike, and I did not need to use the pain reliever very much.  So, while I know it won’t be easy, I think I can handle the short backpacking trip.  I thought my wife (a nurse practitioner) would balk; saying I’m not really in shape yet and still somewhat dependent on the medications.  But, again to my surprise, she only asked that the dates for the trip not conflict with potential boating days!  She also said she would make sure I had the right first aid kit and meds to take along.  Serendipity?  Or karma?  I have been apprehensive about broaching the idea of a thru-hike with my wife because I am not sure she will be even slightly on board with the idea.  More so because of the lengthy time away from home than the physical aspect; she knows I won’t attempt a thru-hike until I am in sufficient physical shape as she’s seen how I trained to run marathons in the past.  I even suggested that I might run another marathon to celebrate turning 60 years old and she thought that was a great idea.  But a thru-hike?  This section hike is going to start in Harper’s Ferry, which is only about 35 miles from my son’s house in Virginia.  (It’s about 100 miles from my home on the Chesapeake Bay.)  My son suggested we could even visit the Appalachian Trail Conservancy HQ.  My son’s husband will drop us off in Harper’s Ferry and my wife is planning on riding along.  The four of us will have dinner and then my son and I will start our hike that evening, while my wife and his husband drive home.  Maybe I’ll convince her to visit ATC HQ with us.  Never know; karma might happen.

Quiet Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619295,"While I don’t consider myself a true gear-head, I do enjoy looking at and thinking about the best gear.  There is no substitute for actually field-testing gear for yourself, but of course, that involves buying the gear and getting out on the trail.  I am not quite ready for that investment in time and money; so, I have contented myself with virtual research.  In reality, this is a huge advantage over the “good old days.”  Online product descriptions and commercial reviews are usually quite detailed.  And then there are the hiker forums and trail journals to learn valuable info from the hikers out there using the gear right now.  Ever since I started recording my thoughts about an eventual thru-hike, I’ve been keeping a gear prospectus, specifically what gear I’d test right now if I were seriously preparing for a thru-hike.  The prospectus gives me a great starting point to assemble some gear for my upcoming West Virginia AT section hike.  My son is providing some big items, specifically, the backpack, sleeping bag, stove, and a few smaller things like a water filter.  The biggest thing I had to purchase right now was a tent.  I went with the ALPS Mountaineering Lynx 1 Tent; at 4.6lbs, including a footprint, it’s clearly not a thru-hike option.  But it was on sale on Amazon at a third of the price of a much lighter tent (like the Big Agnes Copper Spur HV UL 1 Tent in my prospectus that weighs 2.4lbs with a footprint).  I also picked up a few smaller things like trekking poles and a sleeping pad.  It was a great lesson in realizing the cost/weight ratio: i.e. the lighter the gear, the more it costs and the inverse.  In my thru-hike prospectus I am aiming for a base weight under 20lbs; however, for this section hike, I have been struggling to get it under 25lbs.  The clear lesson is to focus on reducing the big three (pack, tent, sleeping system) and packed clothing; no surprise since this is the conventional wisdom from the experts across the internet.  But there is nothing like coming to the realization yourself through practice.  I also offered to assemble the food for the both of us; aiming for 2lbs per day per person.  The lesson here is that snacks are where the weight quickly gains – both physically and physiologically due to the ubiquitous sugar content of snacks like candy and trail mix.  Again, online research provides a lot of good information; but there is nothing like the realization that the amount of M&Ms you purchased for the hike weigh a third of the total food allowance!  It’s just so damned difficult to leave behind those little morsels of chocolate-happiness, isn’t it?!

Quiet Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619643,"I am just sittin’ on the dock of the Bay waiting for the start of the upcoming WV AT section hike with my son.  Just about everything is ready.  The gear list is more or less complete (but not packed).  Food for three days is planned and more or less packaged.  We haven’t settled on a potential plan other than starting in Harpers Ferry and ending at Snickers Gap/VA 7, a total of about 20 miles.  We’ve planned three days; it’s certainly doable in two days, but since I haven’t backpacked in decades, my son was thinking we can take it as slow as necessary.  Of course, he joked that I’ve run more than that in about 4 hours, so it should be no problem (my personal best marathon time is 4 hours); I added that was 20 years ago!  But I’m in decent enough shape, just not the best shape.  So, I think I can handle a 2mph pace and 10 miles-a-day over that terrain.  In the meantime, my wife and I are going to take the boat out for a couple days.  Our boat is only 21’, but has a cuddy cabin; so, we can overnight.  Planning for a 2-3 day boat trip is not unlike planning for a 2-3 day backpacking trip.  Actually, a few small pieces of my backpacking gear are borrowed from the boat: a couple stuff sacks, my UV Buff, a Gerber Dime multi-tool, Gerber Paraframe Mini knife, and my Merrell  All Out Blaze Sieve hiking sandals (land shoes for the boat/camp shoes for backpacking).  Spending the weekend on the boat is like car camping, except there is no tent to set up.  Today’s task is to pack the overnight gear onto the boat and systems checks – fuel up, make sure the batteries are charged, fill the water tank.  I also have a food shopping list (my wife is working today).  It’s already mid-morning; sitting on the deck, sipping coffee and contemplating hiking – and boating – is enjoyable, but, I suppose it’s time to stop sittin’ on the dock of the Bay and get my butt in gear (literally and metaphorically).

Quiet Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619981,"We’re back from an awesome three days cruising on the Bay!  The weather was perfect for boating.  We even saw a pod of about 10-15 dolphins playing near the Chesapeake Bay Bridge.  Curiously, I didn’t think about the trail much during the trip.  While running the Bay, you are concentrating on the water (think about watching your feet on a rocky part of trail); while at anchor, we enjoyed the time together, swimming, playing backgammon.  The only time the hiking trip came up was when my wife was thinking about helping to put together a first aid kit for the trail and wondered if there was anything in the boat first aid kit to commandeer.  But now that I’m again sittin’ on the dock of the Bay, my thoughts are back to the upcoming section hike.  The plan right now is to have my son’s husband drive us out to Harpers Ferry Sunday afternoon 4 August (my wife is still planning on riding along); have dinner together in Harpers Ferry.  Then, Matt and I will spend a night at the Harpers Ferry Hostel in Knoxville, Maryland – across the Potomac from Harpers Ferry – and only a couple hundred yards off the AT that follows along the Chesapeake & Ohio Canal towpath.  Monday morning, we’ll jump on the AT, cross the MD/WV state line across the Potomac and enter Harpers Ferry.  We’re planning a short visit to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy HQ and then continue on to David Lesser Memorial Shelter for the first night.  The second day has us heading for a campsite near Ravens Rock, just a few miles north of VA7 – where my son’s husband will pick us up the next day.  As is well known, the AT runs along the border of Virginia and West Virginia in this section and crosses the state line at least twice; and it will check West Virginia off the list as a section hike.  I have not really considered the possibility of completing the AT in sections; a true thru-hike is what occupies my mind.  However, anyone who reads anything about the trail knows that the AT provides various opportunities; some people turn thru-hikes into section hikes and many people section hike and eventually complete a thru-hike.  One state a year equals 14 years; so, since I’m waiting another 7 years to attempt a thru-hike anyway, I could knock off half of the trail in the meantime.  An adventure in itself and a lot of valuable experience to be gained.  Thus, I’ll walk the VA/WV line and cross the line from only thinking about hiking the AT to being an AT section hiker.  “As sure as night is dark and day is light; I keep you on my mind both day and night.” Johnny Cash – I Walk the Line",,View Entry,"Jul 30, Tue",0
Quiet Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620297,"My gear list for the WV section hike is set.  Base weight is 23.7 pounds/total pack weight 36.9 pounds.  Yea, I know; that is heavy!  The Big 3 (pack/tent/sleeping system) alone equals almost 15 pounds.  Yea, I know; that is really heavy!  The pack and sleeping bag are being provided by my son.  I just purchased the tent as a close-out, knowing that it’s heavy at 4+ pounds.  12 pounds = food/water; went with 2lbs of food per day - just looking at the volume, it might be too much for this trip.  We'll see.  The other relatively heavy category is clothing.  Much of these are interim purchases on sale or close-out; there are a lot of lighter options.  All of this is a starting point.  If this thru-hike fever is chronic, it is clear to see where I can reduce weight.  Of course, that means spending some money.  In the meantime, there is no sense in spending too much until I’ve crossed the Rubicon.  Right now, I only need cross the Potomac and the Shenandoah.  This gear will get me on the trail and across those rivers – which at this point, is the best treatment for this flare up of thru-hike fever.  Click here for my complete gear list.

Quiet Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620346,"Sometimes I think it's better to procrastinate and then be busy right up until the last minute, rather than to be ready a day or more before a trip and then be impatient to depart.  Too much time on your hands provides the chance to second guess the gear list or - even worse - debate with yourself about adding one more thing. You convince yourself that another 4 ounces won't really matter.  Or even worse, you unpack and repack just to do something - realizing a day into the trip that you forgot to repack a critical item. You swear under your breath that you packed that fuel canister. Then you see it in your mind's eye on your kitchen table.  Fortunately, I will have a second look at everything. The pack I will use is at my son's house; all my own gear is in a duffel. I will load the pack at his house tomorrow. I suppose I should just occupy myself with some household chores.
Afterwards, I stopped by my local purveyor for a beverage to enjoy while looking over the PATC guide for the northern VA/WV section once more. I was thinking of a German Hefeweizen, one of my go to summer beers. But the cooler where they keep the Erdinger was broken and all the beer lukewarm. Fortunately, a second cooler was still operational; there I was pleasantly surprised to find Devil's Backbone Mile 842 Lager! This is the beer, named for AT mile marker 842, I had back in February at Devil's Backbone Base Camp when this incarnation of AT fever took its grip. Karma.  Let's get it started (Ha)!

Quiet Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620431,"Easy drive from the Chesapeake Bay to my son's home in northern Virginia to begin the journey.  I have driven this route hundreds of times over the years, but today I was struck more poignantly by the demographic change. I live in a very small town on the Bay, not unlike many of the small rural towns along the AT. But I had to drive around Washington DC to reach my son's house and I found it curious that I left a rural setting, drove around a major urban center, to classic suburbia, and will end the day once again in rural America.
Arrived Harpers Ferry without fanfare. We made the requisite stop at ATC HQ; not much ado since we are not thru-hiking, but it was an opportunity to sign the register and make the start of this journey official. Then it was a stop for a beer at the Almost Heaven Pub - to make this a proper wetting down.  It was still a 2 mile walk to the Harpers Ferry Hostel - easy along the C&O Canal Towpath. A perfect opportunity to work out the fit of the pack since it's the first time I've hoisted it on my back. I have to say, the feel of the hostel is a bit odd. Can't put my finger on it exactly; maybe because I still feel like an outsider to this whole hiking community thing.  Anyway, we had an enjoyable time with a burger and a couple beers at the nearby Guide House Grill. Definitely a place with character for characters. Time to make some adjustments to the pack and call it a night. The journey has begun - one step at a time. One day at a time.

Quiet Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620484,"Had a fairly decent night's sleep at the Harpers Ferry Hostel and a pretty good cook-yourself breakfast. I must say though that I have not become a turkey bacon convert.  Can't beat an over easy egg though (because then it would be a scrambled egg, wouldn't it?).  
Although, we walked yesterday north from HF for about 2 miles on the AT to get to the hostel, I didn't count those since we will re-trace those steps today.  The C&O Towpath was a pleasant way to ease into the journey as we headed up around the bend in the Potomac to cross back into HF. HF was quiet on a Monday morning - a pleasant stroll through history.  Weather couldn't be more perfect for August - high in the 80s and a breeze blowing every now and then.
Even though I haven't carried a rucksack for 20 years, it was really an awesome day.  Of course, the trail is relatively easy in this area. I was surprised at how difficult the rocks can be - they really can slow you down. I know the rocks are much worse in other parts of the trail, but for a neophyte trekker, they truly tried my patience a few times. We did get a chance for a cold soda at Keys Gap - thanks to my son who made the half mile round trip to a nearby store.  Ah, the little things that make a difference. Overall, though it was a great first hike. I did run out of gas on the last uphill about a mile and a half from the shelter and felt like I was on fumes for the last mile or so, but we made decent time, averaging about 2 mph for the day. Made the shelter around 5pm with plenty of daylight left to setup camp and enjoy a trail dinner. I then surprised my son with a a dram of Highland whiskey from Virginia Distillers that I packed in… I really can't thank him enough for suggesting this hike.  Just what we both needed. Another day tomorrow - looking forward to what it may bring.

Quiet Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620546,"Well, today shows that I ain't as good as I once was, but I am as good once, as I ever was. And that once was yesterday. We only had about 7 miles to go today, but my legs were still tired from yesterday. And as I wrote before, I know there are places on the trail where the rocks are much worse, but it sometimes it feels more like rock hopping than hiking.  We moved much slower today.  That said, it's still great to get out here on the trail. Earlier in the day - after climbing back up a steep hill from the spring at the shelter - I remarked to my son that our next hike should be on the beach. Later, we passed a part of the trail where runoff had turned the trail quite sandy, he said ""Here's your beach!"" Yea, smarta**; now where’s my tiki bar?  Other than some rocky stretches that tried my patience again, it was mostly ridge walking today. Not much in the way of scenery either, but there were some pleasant “deep woods” stretches with periwinkle, ferns and sun-speckled trees. We did see a deer in one of those stretches (forgot to mention that we saw a doe and her fawn yesterday); I am always amazed by how fast and easily whitetail deer bounce through the underbrush and trees compared to our slow slog over just a few rocks and roots.  Oh, and the crazy squirrel that came barreling down a tree and into his hollow tree; sounded more like a large animal charging through the brush rather than a panicked squirrel. Made both of us stop and look at each other - like what is that?! 
Other than moving slow, our biggest challenge today was wondering when we could re-fill our water bottles.  We left the shelter with 4.7 liters between us; however, the temperature seemed higher today and the breeze was noticeably absent.  So, it seemed like we were going through our water faster. The idea - not really a plan - was to camp somewhere near Raven Rocks, where I had noted a campsite when reading about the section earlier.  The little map/elevation guide I was carrying showed three water sources starting with the northern end of the Rollercoaster. We just didn’t know exactly where they were located and how reliable they would be once we got there.  Fortunately, we passed a NOBO section hiker that gave us the exact location of the next spring and confirmed it was running fast enough to hear it as you approached. This put a spring in our step (pun intended). We arrived a short time after 3pm and decided to camp at a site near the spring - a perfect location to end the day because it was only about 50 yards off the trail, room for more than a couple tents, and a fire ring (although we decided not to bother with a fire).  Only drawbacks to this campsite were the two ticks I found on my leg while sitting on a log cooking dinner and the evidence of buried trash - mostly cans (assumed to be beer) - buried by some yahoos in the past. Late in the evening we heard thunder and figured we were going to get some rain during the night; however, when I checked the radar app I usually use on the boat, it showed a big storm passing just to the north (which we could see over the ridge) and a smaller one passing to the south.  We were sitting perfectly in between and out of both paths - another reason this location was perfect to end the day.

Quiet Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620611,"We only had about 3 miles to go today to finish the hike.  Matt’s husband was picking us up at the Snickers Gap trailhead around noon.  We left camp around 8:30, which gave us more than 3 hours to go 3 miles. In those 3 miles were only 3 thrills on the northern end of the Rollercoaster - aka hills.  We had descended one hill after passing the northern finishing sign for the Rollercoaster yesterday and then camped in the resulting gap. The map showed 2 longs and 1 short.  Actually, in the end, the hills were not all that bad - yes, long, but we had the time to take them easy. The short was very rocky with a series of about 3 switchbacks; so, again, we had to take it slow, but it was not all that difficult.  In fact, there was a rock/boulder scramble uphill for about 50 yards that was actually kind of fun. Yeah, fun on the Rollercoaster! After that last thrill, it was all downhill for about three quarters of a mile to the trailhead at Snickers Gap.  We made it in plenty of time as our ride had not yet arrived. Checking in with Matt’s husband by phone we learned that the Horseshoe Inn (a local watering hole less than a half mile from the trailhead) didn’t open until 5pm. Well, there had to be a glitch in the day, didn’t there?  I had been thinking about a cheap cold beer to celebrate the end of the hike and now we needed to come up with alternate plans. Since this point is only about 30 miles from my son’s home and in the same county, he quickly suggested an alternative. Adroit Theory Brewing Company was only minutes away, which meant really good cold beer was minutes away.  Matt’s husband dropped us off for the first round and headed to a nearby BBQ - Monk’s in Purcellville, VA - to bring back some lunch. Then the rain came. We had been expecting rain in the afternoon, but thought we could enjoy our beer and ‘que outside before the drops came. Nevertheless, the brewery crew was more than accommodating by welcoming inside two smelly hikers, one clean driver, and a couple pounds of smoky meat.  We were back at my son’s home by 2pm and I immediately headed east to the Chesapeake Bay. It meant that I would hit the beginning of rush hour around Washington, DC; but waiting longer would just mean more traffic buildup. Thanks to the express lanes, I was back home again in about 2 hours; a little longer than normal, but still not too bad. So, ends the 2019 West Virginia section hike. My son and I discussed over the last couple days the idea that we could make a hike an annual event - and maybe even include my other son, Greg.  Actually, we really only talked about the hike and hiking the last couple days; a good break from some stressful times for my son and just the right treatment for my thru-hike fever. Upon my return, my wife was even interested in somehow working her into the equation - a combination hiking/camping trip for the family. For me personally, it’s time to reflect on the hike. Oh, and I have a shopping list for the annual family crab feast on the Bay coming up in a couple days. Fortunately, I have some time to lay this tired old body down before shuttling around to different stores.  Yep, back home again.

Quiet Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620717,"Even though this section hike was short, it produced a few lessons to guide future planning and hikes.  I won’t bore the casual journal reader with the nitty gritty details; I will record more details on my website.  Here, I’ll share some of the big ticket items. The biggest take-away (I suspect this is the same for everyone when they start) is I have to get overall pack weight down.  My pack weight was around 36 pounds. This wasn’t that much of a problem for a short hike, but I know I wouldn’t want to carry that much for an extended time. The target, of course, has to be the big three: pack, tent, and sleeping system.  Another weight-cost factor was the fact we carried too much food for this short hike. I went with 2 pounds per day; this equated to 3500 calories per day. We didn’t eat several items - especially part of breakfast and some snacks - simply because we weren’t hungry.  We never went into calorie deficit during such a short hike; so, thru-hiking might alter the equation. However, there were times we wish we were carrying more water and less food - because we did get quite thirsty. And it wasn’t even that hot for August - high 80s and some breezes.  Dog days would’ve been tough. So, other than exchanging for lighter options, every piece of equipment we carried performed as expected. I was pleasantly surprised that the ALPS Mountaineering Lynx 1 Tent had plenty of room; going with a one-person tent will be a big weight savings.  Positives: I definitely liked the Merrell Moab Vent 2 hiking shoes (paired with the Darn Tough Merino wool socks), especially for the support and cushioning they provided on the rocks.  Originally, I thought they might be too heavy for a thru-hike, but a SOBO thru-hiker we met at the shelter gave them a thumbs up; so, I might have to reconsider my shoe choices. I also learned that I must have trekking poles; these were absolutely necessary for rock hopping and for the extra push on ascents. The inexpensive Mountainsmith Pinnacles performed well, but I need to test lighter options. Other lessons were small, but good to know: Under Armour boxer/jocks really helped prevent chafing; attaching a 700ml Smartwater bottle to my pack strap was very convenient - no need to remove pack for a drink (also need to attach a pocket or have a pack with hip belt pockets for a snack); it was comfortable hiking in the Columbia Silver Ridge Convertible pants (to prevent ticks).

Quiet Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622607,"September days in Maryland are perfect for hiking; so, I suggested to my son that we get another couple miles on the AT before school, weather, etc put an end to the hiking season.  Today found us both with not a lot that needed to be done other than do something we felt like doing - going for a little day trip.  The trailheads on either end of the AT stretch that traverses Washington Monument State Park are almost equidistant from both of our homes.  That gave us the combination of convenient and easy.  The trail is not very rocky and is fairly wide for most of this five mile stretch.  And since we went north to south, we descended the steepest climb on the south side of Monument Knob instead of climbing.  And with the monument in between, it gave us something interesting to view for our efforts.  Weather was as perfect as it gets - partly cloudy and temps in the 70s.  Those conditions brought out several other day hikers, but I can't say the trail was crowded - at least through Washington Monument State Park.  When we got back to my car at the U.S. 40 Trailhead, the parking lot was full - I suspect most of those hikers headed north to Annapolis Rocks.  So, while we took the easy way out, we still had a good hike.  Not much more to say about that...

Quiet Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627062,"It's been just over a year since I started thinking more and more about a thru-hike.  Since my last entry in September and over the winter, I have been mostly dormant.  But I am one year closer to starting a thru-hike on 17 March.  The question remains what year that will happen.  So much still can happen that would divert me from that goal.  The AT class of 2020 is facing the question now whether or not they will be able to start their hike due to the Covid-19 crisis.  One thing is certain, this will pass.  It will just take time.  In the meantime, I can start planning some section hikes for this summer.  Happy St. Patrick's Day!I'm a long way gone down this winding road I'm onIt's gonna take me where I'm boundIt's a long way aroundThe Long Way Around, Jackson Browne",,View Entry,"Mar 17, Tue",0

Quiet Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628369,"It was a great day to get out on my local trail in the Glendening Nature Preserve for my promised at least once a week conditioning hike.  It started out a little warm and a horsefly just wouldn't let me alone for the first half mile.  But all in all, I was feelin groovy! I managed a good 3.5 miles with about .5 miles of bushwhacking.  I decided to check out a trail spur that I had not covered previously and it dead-ended at the marsh.  Rather than backtrack along the same trail, I thought I would bushwhack back along the marsh since I knew I would cut across a trail to a boardwalk into the marsh.  That little adventure was a good workout for the legs because it was along a fairly steep slope.  The only negative to the workout was evidence that more people are starting to get out on the trails with easing of stay-at-home restrictions and the onset of good weather.  Multiple pieces of litter and even dog droppings right on the trail.  This trail is convenient enough and easy enough that it attracts a lot of day hikers and dog walkers that probably do not spend any more time in the outdoors than it takes to stroll through the nature preserve.  Few if any probably have read the LNT notices at the trailhead sign board or even care.  It makes me wonder how things are on the more rugged trails like the AT.  I have noticed several articles noting that with lingering COVID concerns about traveling, camping, hiking, and other outdoor activities closer to home could become the go-to vacation options for many people this summer.  That could be very concerning for the trails and easily accessible campsites.  In the meantime, I am still feelin groovy about getting out on the trail.""Slow down, you move too fastYou got to make the morning last""Paul Simon, ""The 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin' Groovy)""",,View Entry,"Jun 03, Wed",0
Quiet Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628853,"Four days ago I turned 60 years old. I was out on the boat for the actual birthday; so, today was my ""birthday hike."" Although, it was just an easy 3-mile conditioning hike on my now-favorite local trail, it was still a hike. The colorful spring blooms have given way to the green of summer. Time does march on in many ways. I had hoped that the family AT section hike might have happened around my birthday, but it is looking less and less likely that I will even get a mile on the AT this summer. Like so many other hikers in 2020, fate has intervened. So, I will be content to get quick hikes on my local trails and continue to think about ways to refine the gear prospectus.

Quiet Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629602,"Sometimes it seems like my thru-hike journey is moving along three steps at a time. I still have not made it out to the AT this year. Of course, more than half of the year remains; so, there are still plenty of opportunities. With the dog days of August almost upon us, it probably is for the best to wait for cooler – and more colorful – autumn weather. In the meantime, I am still getting out every week on my nearby trails for conditioning hikes. I hiked at Maryland’s Rosaryville State Park for the first time, which offers an almost 10-mile perimeter trail. Not much to say about that trail except that it affords an opportunity to string together some longer miles. While I subscribe to the idea that every trail is “interesting,” this one surely challenges that notion. Simply a walk through old-growth hardwood forest without any significant terrain features to add interest. This past week, I also was cutting the rug down at a place called the Jug; the Jug Bay Wetlands Sanctuary. This was my second time on the Jug Bay trails, but this was my first time taking the longer Farm Connector Trail all the way out to Jug Bay Pier. This trail affords a fantastic view over Jug Bay on the upper Paxtuxant River. While it is an out-and-back trail, this is my favorite so far of my local trails. These conditioning hikes have also provided an opportunity to do minor gear field-tweaks. During my AT hike last year, I decided that I really want to have a water bottle conveniently attached to my pack strap. I have been using two Nite-Ize 12” Gear Ties, which have been a functional yet imperfect option. I recently viewed a YouTube video in which I saw the Aqua Clip in use and decided to give those a try. I still need to add a shock cord band (instead of one Nite-Ize Gear Tie) to keep the bottle from swinging; nevertheless, I think this will be the best solution. And I finally have tired of using my REI Co-op Packmod Rainshield Pocket on the opposite pack strap for my mobile phone. I still want a pocket on that strap to keep my phone, but the REI pocket simply is about a ¼ inch too short to hold my Samsung mobile phone in a Defender Otterbox. Searching the internet, I can find ultralight pack strap pockets that are either too big or with an attachment system that will not match my Osprey Kestrel pack straps. So, going back to Nite-Ize, I ordered a Clip Case Cargo Holster for a mobile phone. This holster comes in various sizes to fit mobile phones with a protective case like the Otterbox. Unfortunately, it is fairly heavy pocket (3.6 oz) for backpacking purposes; however, since I cannot find an acceptable ultralight option, I will have to pay the weight penalty. If a company like REI, ULA, ZPacks, or Gossamer Gear made a pocket with this mobile phone holster design using ultralight materials, I am certain it would be a profitable effort. Hey, free idea; all I ask is to get one free in return!

Quiet Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629661,"Sometimes it feels like my journey to an AT thru-hike is in slow motion. And the casual visitor to this journal might wonder, “Is this guy ever going to actually hike on the AT?!” Sometimes I wonder that myself. Then I remember that my realistic start date is still years away. So, I continue to take my AT journey just a little bit at a time. This past month I was able to snack on a few conditioning day hikes; four to be exact for a total of 21 miles. Today’s hike was again at the Jug Bay Wetlands Sanctuary, which has become my favorite group of day hiking trails. It was also my first hike in decades in the rain. Actually, when I trained for marathons (a long time ago now), I really enjoyed running in the rain. And we used to say in the Army that you do not need to practice to be miserable; nevertheless, hikes in the rain seem like the right way to prepare for an AT thru-hike. To cap things off, today’s hike also completes all the various trails at Jug Bay. Finally, this month had a couple ticks taking a bite out of me; fortunately, I seem to have dodged the Lyme disease bullet. But a good little reminder to be careful. Little bites, a little bit at a time; yet forward progress.

Quiet Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629987,"I finally stepped foot on the AT for the first time this year! I managed a day hike to Annapolis Rocks, but with only a mere 2.3 AT miles from Black Rock Gap to Annapolis Rocks. However, total miles was 6.6 as this was an out-and-back hike using the Blue Blazed Thurston-Griggs Trail to access the AT near the POGO Campsite. Thurston-Griggs is like the backdoor to Black Rock and Annapolis Rocks overlooks. Most day hikers come up from the crowded I70/US 40 Trailhead, but I think Thurston Griggs is a better hike up the mountain since it isn’t as busy. This Blue Blaze is very short at .9, but is quite rocky as it follows the course of Black Rock Creek up the mountain. A couple other firsts for the year. I saw my first whitetail deer on trail this year - three does having a drink at Black Rock Creek on Thurston Griggs. And as I cruised along the almost park like route of the AT between Black Rock and Annapolis Rocks, I suddenly realized that this was the absolute first time that I have ever hiked on the AT all alone. Every other time, I was with either family members or a group. Of course, I wasn’t really alone since this is probably the most heavily trafficked segment of the AT in Maryland. Today was overcast with an occasional drizzle; so, there weren’t as many day hikers (like myself) on the trail. Still a lot of people were out for a day hike, including several families, and everyone seemed to be enjoying the experience. Although today was still “busy,” Annapolis Rocks can seem more like Annapolis City Dock on a nice weekend day. So, I was content to linger on both overlooks without getting too close to others. While this hike was a drop in the bucket, I keep forward progress on this AT journey.

Quiet Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630641,"My son Matt and I found an opportunity even though the summer is turning to autumn to make good on our idea to make our AT section hike an annual thing. Even better, my older son Greg is able to join us for his first hike on the AT! So, we are back near Harpers Ferry to begin a mini-section north into Maryland. Last year we went south into Virginia to Snickers Gap. This trip will take us from Weverton Cliffs to the US 40/I70 trailhead for about 20 miles. We met up at the US 40/I70 trailhead, leaving my Jeep there and shuttling with Matt’s car to Harpers Ferry. Last year we started the trip at the Harpers Ferry Hostel in Knoxville, MD. Unfortunately, the hostel appears to be a victim of the pandemic and is closed. So, we booked a couple rooms at the Hillside Hotel in Knoxville. The Hillside gets very mixed reviews, including a lot of very poor ones, online. However, we found the old-style motel a clean and comfortable place to pre-position for our weekend hike. And it is across the road from the Guide House Grill and their very tasty burgers! The evening gave us a chance to help Greg organize his pack since he is not really a hiker/backpacker. I feel very fortunate to share part of my AT journey now with both of my sons. Who knows; perhaps the trail will provide even more fortune in the future.

Quiet Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630686,"This morning, we were frustrated that the gas station/convenience store across the road from the Hillside Hotel did not open as advertised at 7:30 am. So, we adjusted and found a Burger King nearby; I really needed some coffee! Fortunately, we had Matt’s car; we parked my Jeep at the end point and planned to park his at the start point. After a quick breakfast, we headed to the Weverton Cliffs Trailhead parking and were very surprised to find it full and cars starting to park along the road itself. Of course, it was a Saturday and this is probably the second most popular day hike on the Maryland AT. But we found a spot and headed north. The climb to Weverton Cliffs is advertised as one of the steepest on the Maryland section of the AT; however, it really isn’t that bad since it is a series of switchbacks. Nevertheless, Greg was happy to hear that it was going to be the toughest climb of the weekend, especially when it was over! At the overlook, we found all the people from all of the parked cars. It was quite crowded with day hikers. We didn’t stay long, continuing north. The “crowds” of day hikers continued all the way to Gathland State Park. Most were friendly, but several seemed fairly indignant that we were not wearing masks. I find it is relatively easy to step off the trail and get a 6-foot distance in most places. But a lot of these folks apparently didn’t think the same and even chose to barrel right past us even on narrow stretches or on the uphills with us coming uphill rather than ease their concerns by stepping aside themselves. Once again demonstrating the theory that common sense isn’t all that common. 
It was in this initial stretch that Greg earned his first trail name. He isn’t too fond of spiders and surprisingly (considering the day hikers) hit a spider web across the trail since he was in the lead. If the trail weren’t so narrow and if Matt and I weren’t behind him, I think he might have made it back to Harpers Ferry in record time! So, Spiderman is born. After that, Gathland was our first long stop – other than a quick-ish lunch stop at Brownsville Gap - in order to fill up on water at the pump without having to filter. We hit the blue blaze to Crampton Gap Shelter shortly after the park around 2pm. Even though it was Greg’s first backpacking trip, we decided to push on to Rocky Run Shelter and make it a 12-mile day. We actually made pretty good time today; we started at the trailhead around 8:30am and made it to Rocky Run Shelter just before 5pm. The shelter itself was empty, but most of the tent sites were already taken by some other weekend hikers. Still, we found some good pitch sites for our tents near the shelter – close enough that we could still use the picnic table to cook/eat dinner. Curiously, we could not find a bear box nor a bear pole at Rocky Run; I thought that all Maryland shelters had some type of bear device. Among the weekend hikers at the shelter was a group of about six kids, ages around 6-12, with two dads. The kids stayed up until about 11pm playing games like flashlight tag and cooking s’mores. Any bear would have been pretty crazy to come anywhere close! All in all, the weather was cool and near perfect despite being overcast; so, still a good day to be back on the AT. And sharing it with my sons made it an even better day.

Quiet Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630792,"Even though we had only 6.2 total miles to go today to get back to my Jeep at the US40/I70 Trailhead, we were up with the sun. It turned a bit chilly overnight, but despite thinking I heard raindrops a couple times, it stayed dry. It was fairly windy though and something like an acorn fell out of the trees right onto my tent, giving me a slight startle. The chilly morning made the coffee (Starbucks Via Italian Roast - my go-to coffee for backpacking) taste even better. After a quick-ish breakfast - Clif Bar for me, oatmeal for Greg and Matt - we were off on the trail to finish up the weekend. The breezy wind moved out the overcast sky of yesterday and replaced it with a partly cloudy sky that put some sunshine into our hike. The AT in this stretch is fairly easy and we quickly arrived at Dahlgren Backpacker's Campground and a chance to fill our water bottles. We decided to not go searching for the spring at the old Rocky Run shelter just to save a bit of time at breakfast. We had enough water left over from the tank-up at Gathland; so, we had a couple gulps to make the two miles to Dahlgren. From Dahlgren, it's up and over Washington Monument State Park, a gradual uphill - nothing too strenuous. We did stop at the park to use the restroom and to have an early lunch before the last few miles. The wind was blowing pretty good up and I had to pull out my rain jacket to keep off the chill since my shirt was damp from sweat. The final run from Washington Monument to US40/I70 Trailhead, Matt and I did as a day-hike last year; so, it was familiar and went pretty fast. And since I counted those miles in a previous entry, today's total miles count only from Rocky Run Shelter to Dahlgren Campground. We got back to my Jeep around 2pm and decided to skip a post-hike food stop since we still had to get back to Matt's car near Harpers Ferry. After that it was still going to be an hour plus drive to northern Virginia for Matt and Greg and almost 2 hours for me back to the Chesapeake Bay. We were all a bit sore from pushing past 10 miles the day before. But it also felt good to have about 14 more AT miles checked off this year. That leaves a stretch in Maryland from Black Rock Gap to Pen-Mar; as well, as a couple miles on the C&O Canal leading up to Weverton Cliffs and from the US40/I70 Trailhead to Annapolis Rocks that I've skipped trying to piece together day-hikes and this weekender. There are still three months left in 2020; so, maybe I can still travel back out to the mountains and snag those last Maryland miles and close out another state. Step by step. Mile by mile. Hike by hike. Year by year.

Quiet Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631653,"With a bit over 20 miles left to complete Maryland, my sons and I looked for a time to get one more weekend on the trail in order to finish the state this year. The best weekend in October appeared to be the same time as Greg’s birthday; so, it seemed like an easy decision. The plan was similar to our hike of the southern half; position one car at the end point – in this case PenMar Park on the MD/PA border – and drive back south to start where we left off last time – the US40/I70 Trailhead.  We planned to get together again on Friday evening at the trailhead; so, we could get an early start on Saturday. Instead of staying at a motel near the trail, this time we decided to spend the night on the trail at Pine Knob Shelter, less than a mile in from the US40/I70 Trailhead. Since autumn brings earlier sunsets, the timing was going to be tight for Matt and Greg to get from Virginia and still make it to the shelter before dark. It has been said many times in this journal, but karma entered again to make this a special Friday. My wife, Jackie, offered to drop me at the start point and then pick up all three of us at the finish, which would eliminate the need for Matt and Greg to drive all the way north to PenMar Park and then the three of us drive back to the trailhead. Since she was making the drive on Friday, I asked her if she would like to hike in to the shelter and spend the night with us. She needed no convincing because it was going to be Greg’s birthday on Saturday and she thought she could do something nice for him at camp on Friday. Fortunately, I could piece together some gear for her – mainly a sleeping bag, sleeping pad, and a pack – from things we already had at home.  She ended up with my usual day pack (a 30L EMS pack I have had for 20+ years) vice her small daypack, a 13L Osprey Daylite. Her sleeping bag, however, was a bulky (and heavy) synthetic Eddie Bauer bag our daughter used for camp when she was in high school and a self-inflating sleeping pad we actually use on the boat, another bulky (and rather heavy) item. Those two items just about filled the 30L pack! In order to bring the special treats - hot dogs for Friday dinner and cinnamon rolls for Saturday breakfast, she also needed to use a 6L sling pack that she uses instead of a purse on the boat. Her total weight was about 20 pounds. But that was only half of what I had to carry from the parking lot to the shelter. I had 40+ pounds because we decided to not wait for Matt and Greg at the trailhead, choosing instead to get to the shelter as soon as possible in order to get campsites. I had to carry the tent and sleeping pad Greg usually borrows from me and ingredients for s’mores around the evening’s campfire. The weather was forecasted to be very good for the weekend and as we expected, there were already several groups at Pine Knob Shelter when Jackie and I arrived just before dark. Even with trying to get an early start, we ended up in bumper to bumper traffic on US 40 because of an accident on I70 West. The irony of escaping to the mountains and we still sat in traffic for over an hour. Matt and Greg didn’t arrive until just after dark, but since I had set up Greg’s tent already and my tent – which Jackie was using; we could get right to the camping feast Jackie planned around the campfire. Greg also had a surprise, he brought along some instant Croatian dumpling soup he found at a market – to remember when we lived in Slovenia. It was a perfect evening to sit around the fire and enjoy the treats; something, we hadn’t been able to do as a family in a long time. Karma also gave me the chance to bring up the idea of thru hiking at dinner – half joking/half serious. At least, Jackie didn’t immediately tell me I am a crazy old man – even though I may be – but she also didn’t say it was a great idea. So, at least the idea is now out there to revisit again in the future.  Unfortunately, my daughter and her boyfriend and our grandson – Matt’s son – weren’t able to be there as well. But now we have a reason to plan another family hike on the AT!

Quiet Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631857,"I slept in Pine Knob Shelter last night since my wife Jackie was using my tent. I am a “shelter skeptic” and this was my first time sleeping in an AT shelter. I understand the allure of not having to pitch a tent, especially if it’s raining. But the allure of shelters eludes me; they just seem like rodent infested, dusty, crowded, and noisy hovels with one side open that can still let in the wind and rain. I have seen some very nice looking shelters; Rocky Run in Maryland and David Lesser in WV come to mind. Unfortunately, Pine Knob isn’t all that nice. It is on the small side and crammed on a rocky patch just off the blue blaze trail. You can almost touch the picnic table while lying inside the shelter and the fire pit is practically under the table. This last aspect puts an exclamation point on my aversion to shelters. On this particular night, another hiker was also using the shelter and decided to have a fire in the pit. I actually invited him to our fire a bit of a distance from the shelter where the tents were pitched, but he declined, saying he really enjoys a fire by himself. Okay. No problem. Of course, a couple hours later – somewhat past hiker midnight – when my son Matt (who also decided to sleep in the shelter) and I headed for our pillows, the problem rose like a plume of smoke. Our reclusive shelter-mate kept his little fire going easily for another two hours; the smoke wafting gently directly into the shelter and the frequent snap, crackle, pop of him breaking another branch for the blaze echoing off the walls. Pine Knob Shelter became Pine Knob Smokehouse. Yea, I know; he has the right to a fire – it’s his hike. Nevertheless, he got a trail name that night – at least to us – Smokehouse. And I have a genuine experience now that reinforces my aversion to shelters. Thanks Smokehouse for a useful trail lesson. 

I mentioned in yesterday’s entry that Jackie brought homemade cinnamon rolls for Greg’s birthday breakfast! That is a trail breakfast one could really get used to having! She brought so many we actually had some leftovers to offer impromptu trail magic to another hiker camping close-by (not Smokehouse – he was still asleep even though it was by now almost 8am!). After a nice family breakfast, Jackie headed back to the trailhead; Greg, Matt, and I turned north in the direction of the Pennsylvania border, the objective for this section. Today’s plan would have us stopping at Ensign Cowell Shelter, about 8.2 miles away. The trail for this stretch is probably some of the easiest in Maryland; a bit of an uphill towards Annapolis Rocks to start, but mostly a literal walk in the park otherwise. The stretch of the AT to Annapolis Rocks is probably the most popular and well-known hike in Maryland and the trail conditions are pretty easy. We cruised fairly easy and decided to skip the blue blaze to Annapolis Rocks itself – choosing instead to spend a bit more time at Black Rock a bit further down the trail. The view from both overlooks is relatively the same, but Black Rock is almost on the AT instead of down a blue blaze. Not that we really had to worry about mileage today, but sometimes one rock is the same as another. 

Unless, of course, those rocks are the pointy, ankle twisters on the trail. We found those about two miles after we filtered/cameled-up with water at Thurston-Griggs Trail/POGO Campsite (one of the best water sources close to the AT in Maryland). In this stretch, the trail traces the very top of the ridge; consequently, the rocks are totally exposed. This was one of those stretches where it’s more rock hopping than hiking. Then the trail descends quickly to Wolfsville Road and Ensign Cowell Shelter. This is one of those descents that you are glad you are going downhill rather than uphill; this is not a bump in the trail, but rather a genuine elevation change that makes you expend effort regardless of your direction of travel – up or down. At least for Maryland. We met a father and his two daughters midway – they going up as we were going down. We shared the usual, “You are almost there!” The young ladies did not seem convinced and the father gave that “what are you going to do with teens” look. Frankly, I felt the need to sit on a rock as we got to the bottom of the descent. Having run a lot of miles throughout my Army career and with a few marathons under my belt, I always remind everyone that the uphill might seem harder, but the downhill side of a climb – or life – is always harder on the body. The shelter and campsite was less than a mile away at this point, but I still needed that five minutes to sit. Listen to your body. 

We made Ensign Cowell Shelter around 3pm; seems like an early time to stop, but we wanted to enjoy some camp time since it was Greg’s birthday – 34 years earlier at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. The tent sites around Ensign Cowell are fairly spread out, but we found a couple tent pads close together with a decent fire pit not far off the trail. We spent the next hour or so pitching tents and collecting some firewood. It was probably 4pm or later when we decided to head back to the blue blaze to the spring only to find it dry. We each still had about a half liter of water – much better off than the young lady trying to filter water from a stagnant puddle barely the size of a pie plate near the spring. We actually met Kelly and her hiking friends at Pine Knob the night before when they came in after dark looking for a spot to camp – they ended up going on to the campsites at Annapolis Rocks – and earlier in the day having lunch up on the rocky stretch before Wolfsville Road. She said this was the only water her group of five was going to have tonight. From AWOL Guide and Gaia GPS, I noted there was supposedly another spring two miles further north on the trail. But Matt and Greg decided to head back down to Wolfsville Road and a line of water they saw on Google Maps. Kelly said she hoped my friends find water; I told her they are my sons; my friends would not have let me run out of water! HA! I headed back to the campsite to collect more firewood, hoping my sons would come through as well.  And then, my first AT trail magic. Camped next to us were two young men – boondocking a campsite and not hiking they said. They asked me if the spring was dry, to which I replied yes; they then offered a gallon of water from their supply back in their truck at the parking lot on Wolfsville Road. I texted Matt and Greg the good news who by this time decided the road run-off they found was not a good idea and had decided to walk the two miles down Wolfsville Road to a Dollar General in Smithsburg, MD. I only wished there was enough to share with Kelly and her friends. Actually, there were a few groups at Ensign Cowell that evening without water. Several people wandered past us in the dark headed for Wolfsville Road to link-up with an Uber Eats delivery with pizza and water from Smithsburg. We fortunately were able to enjoy our fire and another serving of Croatian dumpling soup from Greg.The danger of typing a journal entry on a laptop in the comfort of home instead of in a tent on a mobile phone, is that it is so easy to write much more about the day. I really would like to write about the poor condition of the tent pads at Ensign Cowell (loose fine gravel and rocks that make it impossible to set a tent stake – broke two) or how fantastically good was my Cheddar Broccoli Knorr side with Starkist Tuna Creations Tomato Basil (bought by my wife because she thought they would be good for backpacking meals) that I had for dinner.

Quiet Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631870,"I am satisfied with my sleep system. My down-filled REI Co-op Radiant 19 Sleeping Bag (bought earlier this year when discontinued by REI) is cozy and likely will be my eventual thru-hike bag. My Klymit Static V2 Sleeping Pad is comfortable (will be replaced due to its 17.2oz weight, probably with a NEMO Tensor). But I still toss and turn a lot at night; the same as at home. Nevertheless, it was easy to get up and moving at daylight. The plan we’ve established has been to wake up at daylight and be on the trail within an hour. We managed this easily this morning even though we paused to heat water – in my case for coffee, Greg and Matt had some oatmeal. I had a Clif Bar with my coffee and I think that will be my go-to breakfast for a while. I am one of the odd hikers that actually really enjoys Clif Bars. I know I really don’t like instant oatmeal; so, no sense in even thinking about that as hiker breakfast. 

Today’s distance was 9.8 miles to the Mason Dixon Line and then backtrack the half mile to Pen Mar Park to be picked up by Jackie around 4pm. The first order of the day though was to fill up on water; the gallon that our neighbors gifted lasted through dinner and breakfast, but left us each only a swallow or two for the trail. AWOL Guide had a spring 2.5 miles away and the stream at Warner Hollow Gap at 3.1 miles; so, we were confident we would reach water within a couple hours. The trail heads up from Ensign Cowell Shelter, but it’s a gradual incline that eventually enters a cow pasture. Surprisingly, the pasture was occupied by Texas Longhorns! An odd sight to find hiking in Maryland; the cattle seemed to look at us as equally odd interrupting their morning graze. This is about where the spring showed have been, but all we found were boardwalks through a mostly dry bog. So, on to the stream at Warner Hollow Gap. The stream was flowing very well and we able to quickly fill our bottles. While filtering water at the stream, Kelly and her group of thirsty friends arrived; the college-aged group acted like they found a free keg of beer. From there, we headed up the climb to Raven Rock, crossing first Little Antietam Creek, also flowing well. Fortunately, we were full up with water because as we crossed the creek, we found a very foul decaying corpse of a deer near where we would have probably tried to get water. The climb up to Raven Rock is fairly steep and slowed me down a good bit – even though Matt and Greg still had fresh legs. On the top, the trail becomes another 1.5 mile walk in the park all the way to High Rock. As a Maryland resident, I have to say High Rock is an embarrassment. Easily reached by car and a well-known hang glider launch site, almost every rock surface and several trees near the overlook are spray-painted with graffiti. When I say almost every rock surface, I mean stones even two inches wide sticking out of the ground were painted. Only pebbles seemed to escape the zeal of the paint can artists.  It looks more like a haphazard neon canvas than one of the best natural rock formations in Maryland. We didn’t linger long. 

Maybe we would have wasted more time up on High Rock if we had known how tough the descent would be down the east slope. This 1.7-mile stretch gets my vote for the toughest on the AT in Maryland. It's like someone said, ""Let There Be Rock!"" and there were rocks. The entire distance is a boulder field that requires watching your feet and hopping from rock to rock. There is no way to see the trace of trail itself; you have to hop rocks downhill from one blaze to another. Considering Maryland’s easy reputation, this stretch is a bit of a surprise if you aren’t aware. And to add insult to injury, just when you get to the bottom of the slope and the trail looks like it will at least be level, it turns uphill and gives you a quarter mile or so of uphill rock hopping. And speaking of injury, I narrowly missed my first injury on the AT. Stepping down from a boulder onto what appeared to be a flat patch of dirt, ""Let There Be Rock!"" I found a small rock hidden under the autumn leaves. It twisted my ankle; fortunately, I had a chance to place my trekking poles and shift my weight quickly. It was a short and sudden pain, but I averted actually twisting my ankle. After a minute of stretching, I was good to go and didn’t experience any more pain. Had I twisted my ankle significantly, the 1.5 miles remaining into Pen Mar Park would not have been fun at all. Shortly after the potential calamity, the trail levels out and is again a park-walk into Pen Mar Park.  We made good time and easily made the link-up with Jackie for our ride home. We cruised through Pen Mar Park, which despite the pandemic seemed full to capacity with family picnics. One lady even called out to ask us if we knew a “shit ton of rain” was on the way. Actually, we did know that rain was in the forecast and were thankful it had held off so far. All three of us kept saying how terrible the last boulder field would have been in the rain, especially with the leaf cover. We only needed to cross the railroad tracks and tick off the last few hundred yards to the Mason Dixon Line and complete Maryland. I suppose it feels better to a thru-hiker, but the MD/PA border on the AT is a bit under-whelming. Nevertheless, another state is completed; well, except for 2 miles from Weverton Cliffs Trailhead to Harper’s Ferry. We’ll get that as a day hike before the year is over. While 2020 has been difficult for many reasons, I was still able to make significant steps forward toward an eventual thru-hike. Now, it's back to the Bay to plan the next hike.

Quiet Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632138,"When Matt and I started counting AT miles in 2019 with our first section south from Harpers Ferry to Snickers Gap, we stayed at a hostel in Knoxville, MD. So, we hiked the two miles from the hostel in Maryland to Harpers Ferry, WV. Then, in 2020, when Matt, Greg and I started to work on the Maryland section we started at Weverton Cliffs and headed north. That left this two mile stretch in Maryland from Weverton Cliffs to the Sandy Hook Bridge at Knoxville, MD near the hostel still lingering un-hiked. Of course, it was a busy holiday week, but my wife was great and agreed to go along with Matt, Greg, myself, and our grandson, Lucas to notch a short day hike and complete Maryland on New Year’s Eve. It was expected to rain, but the rain held off so we could do a dry out and back from Weverton Cliffs Trailhead. While 2020 has been a difficult AT hiking year for many, I have been fortunate enough to complete my second state in this extended section hike of the AT. I have been even more fortunate that the hiking bug has extended to my oldest son, my wife and grandson, all who notched their first AT miles in 2020. Everyone is looking forward to a family hike on the AT in 2021 and maybe bringing along my daughter and her boyfriend. When I started thinking again of thru-hiking the AT, it was a personal thought and not shared with my family. Now, not only is the idea of thru-hike out there with my family, they are hiking their own hikes on the trail. So, while 2020 has been difficult in so many different ways for so many people, the year for me has been a hiking positive. Here’s wishing everyone a great hiking 2021.

Quiet Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632148,"The last year had been a difficult year for many in so many ways. Considering the pain and loss many have suffered, a hiking journal seems a bit self-absorbed. It’s been both enlightening and frustrating to read hiking and backpacking sites the past year. Most entries have been mature and accepting that there is something much larger going on in the world than whether or not we can get out on the trails.  For the most part, Trail Journals has been incredible in its ability to keep most of the vitriol out of the daily discussion. Let’s hope that continues and in that regard, let me get off my own high horse and get back to journaling about hiking. I need to let go of my own urge to be judgmental and move on to the next climb. Don’t stop believin’ that we can get back to fonder ways of hiking the trail and better ways of accepting that everyone is hiking their own hike. For me 2021 is the year of Virginia. My current HYOH method of day hikes and short ass section hikes (yes, I am currently sashay-ing the AT!) will not be sufficient. It will take some serious planning to knock off the state with the most AT miles this year. But I believe it can be done. Here’s to the miles in 2021! Don’t stop believin’!

Quiet Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632377,"There was a Virginia ""breeze blowin"" when I met my son Matt at the I66/Tucker Lane Trailhead around 9am, but the temperature was hovering around freezing; so, it wasn’t exactly ""sweet."" And the partly sunny skies in the forecast were actually mostly cloudy. Still, ""the Blue Ridge Mountains tend to set me free,"" so we looked forward to getting 2021's first AT miles under our feet. First, we had to shuttle south to VA522 and Lake Front Royal since we planned to go northbound for today's planned hike of about 8 miles.
As the trail heads north from VA522 trailhead, it skirts the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute or the National Zoo's breeding facility. Considering the type of fence and secure electronic gates, it makes one wonder if this government facility really is for zoo animals. There have been several semi-secret CIA facilities in this part of Virginia, west of Washington DC; so, I will let your imagination wander. The history of the facility is actually interesting and worth a Google search. The trail runs right along the secure fence and remnants of old stone walls. Just inside the fence, we could see a well worn animal track running along the fence for quite a distance. Never saw enough sign or actual creatures to determine what made the track, but I am guessing a decent size animal.
The trail leads up gradually, but lasts almost 2 miles before hitting the ridge. Not much to see along this section except a lot of stone piles and stone wall remnants. The ground was salted with snowy sleet in several places, so it still made for an interesting climb even without a view at the top. Overall, this section between Front Royal and I66 is lacking in sights. But the ""exquisite"" Denton shelter and a couple high pastures give it some character. The ridge walk weaves through private land and several large houses, making this almost a suburban hike. We stopped at the Denton shelter for lunch; boiled water for hot chili Ramen and tea. It wasn’t really cold staying in the low 30s and the base layer with a mid-layer fleece were sufficient while hiking. But when you stop, it gets chilly fast. So, some hot noodles hit the spot. While eating lunch, a snow squall ran up the valley to the shelter. It looked like it was going to last some time, so it motivated a quick pack up and move out. It was the snowy sleet again, but was pretty close to whiting out for a minute or two; only lasted about 10 minutes, enough to salt the trail with white. Surprisingly, the trail was fairly muddy leaving the shelter for a mile or so. Thought it would be frozen, but instead was quite mucky. Until the rocks. 
The last mile of this stretch north bound descends to US55/I66 and the trailhead at Tucker Lane. Starts at about 1500ft and drops below 1000ft at Goose Creek. And it's quite rocky, a taste of what comes further north in the Rollercoaster. Definitely the most difficult piece of this stretch of trail. Not too bad going down, but wouldn't be fun going up as a southbounder. Matt and I skipped post hike food since it was after 3pm and I had a 2-hour drive back to the Chesapeake Bay. As I said in the last post, 2021 is the year of Virginia and we realized the drive to trailheads is only going to get further from home. But this day hike sets up a family section hike from Snickers Gap to I66 when it gets warmer. And probably another day hike or two from Front Royal to Shenandoah National Park. Then, we are hoping to scratch off SNP in one 2 week trip sometime later this year. We shall see how things develop.

Quiet Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632743,"It's been ""So cold up north that the birds can't hardly fly."" But down south, it looks like the TrailJournals thru-hikers who have started their journeys are doing quite well with the snow and cold weather from the north Georgia mountains through the Smokies. I have never considered myself a fair weather hiker; I have had my share of cold and snow in the mountains, growing up hunting in Pennsylvania, cross-country skiing over the years, and from my time living in northern New York serving with the 10th Mountain Division. When I ran marathons a dozen or more years ago, freezing rain, snow, ice, bitter cold, whatever winter had to offer in the northeast, never stopped me from getting in training miles. Nevertheless, my philosophy now is there is no good reason to practice to be miserable. It comes naturally. So, I have yet to log very many conditioning miles so far this year. With a sunny break in the weather today and an increase in temperature to the mid-30s, it looked to be a great day rather than a slog; so, I hit my local nature preserve trail for a few conditioning miles.
This also gave me a chance to use my new day pack for the first time. I recently replaced my 30+ year old EMS 30L day pack with an ALPS Mountaineering Tour 35-45L Backpack. This has a variable volume due to being a roll-top closure. I need to give it a bit more use to make some detailed conclusions. But after one use, I am not sure I would want to pack it up to the 45L capacity. However, as a day pack in the 30s range, I think it will be an improvement over my previous pack. I also am now convinced my dry cold weather clothing system is where I want (need) it to be should I want to push out on the trail this time of year. I say, dry, because I have not yet used my current wet weather gear in cold weather other than as a windbreak. That said, my combined top layers of an Under Armour Velocity HeatGear T-shirt, Under Armour Cold Gear 1/4 Zip, and an REI Midweight Base Layer Hoodie have been more than sufficient on my hikes this winter. My Columbia Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket was more than optimum the one time I needed to use it as a wind break. I have never really liked wearing long-johns or leggings as layers; so, my bottom layer has only been my usual Columbia Silver Ridge Convertible Pants (and Under Armour Tech Mesh 6"" Boxer/Jock under shorts). Two key pieces of my cold weather gear are from my Army days; a polypro neck gaiter and a Polartec microfleece beanie. There may be lighter, fancier choices from popular outdoor manufacturers, but these standard issue items are some of the best pieces of Army gear I ever used; they will always make the cut. So far, the lightweight REI Co-op Merino Wool Liner Gloves have been fantastic. The ensemble is usually rounded out with Darn Tough Merino Wool Cushion socks and my Merrell Moab 2 Vent hiking shoes. Today, I wore a pair of waterproof Alpina hiking boots (similar to their current Stador model); I got these almost 20 years ago in Slovenia. They are still in great shape and a bit better in snowy conditions than the Merrell’s. Of course, the Alpinas are somewhat heavy and are only a day hike option if there is snow on the ground. For cold wet weather, I think I will add a pair of rain pants and I already have a pair of Komperdell Thermo Mittens. The mittens are really just neoprene shells to wear over the Merino Wool liner gloves. This clothing system works great for section hiking and I don’t see why it wouldn’t for a thru-hike. 

Still no target on the wall for the next AT section hike; we have a tentative plan, but no set date. At a minimum, looking to get an AT day hike or two on the calendar for March.

Quiet Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633086,"Matt and I met up at the trailhead parking at Lake Front Royal and then shuttled with my Jeep to Jenkins Gap parking next to the AT in Shenandoah National Park. Today’s hike: Jenkins Gap north to Lake Front Royal – about 7 miles. We stepped on the AT precisely at 8:30am as planned. The forecast all week had suggested that we would start hiking under sunny skies in 30 degree temps, improving to the 40s as the day progressed. The sunny skies were an accurate prediction; however, it was in the low 20s to start and I don’t think it hit 40 degrees until we were finished around 3pm. I don’t mind the frigid temps since I have my cold-weather hiking layers dialed in to a comfortable point. My REI Merino wool glove liners previously have been quite comfortable, but this morning my hands stayed fairly cold for a couple miles. I also expected the trail to be muddier and slushy by this time, but the ground was pretty well frozen hard and solid ice/snow lingered on the trail. Although, we didn’t hit “treacherous” ice on the trail until the blue blaze up to Compton Peak. The ice was mostly frozen snow melt run-off, but it was a good 3 inches thick and slick in places where the sun was glinting off the surface. I have to say, the view from Compton Peak is less than exciting considering the views that are possible from Skyline Drive in Shenandoah NP. Nevertheless, it was the only real view to be had on today’s route and I am glad we took the .2 blue blaze (even with the ice), but this vista is definitely a one-and-done kind of thing. 

Once past Compton Gap (one of the spots where the AT crosses over Skyline Drive), the trail did become a bit muddy in places and there were even some fresh blow-downs across the trail. Fairly uninteresting stretch from Compton Gap north to the park border except for the area with the blow-downs; the entire forest was crisscrossed with down trees, suggesting the wind must really blow across the ridge above Indian Run. Just past the park border the rock formations at Possums Rest are worth a snack break. On the way down towards Tom Floyd Wayside shelter the trail turned icy again. It was slow going among the rocks and ice without traction devices, but I felt sure-footed with trekking poles. Matt eventually took a sliding butt fall, which I found amusing, but karma found me a bit further down the tail. Just as the trial looked like it was going to level off, I hit a slick spot and before I had time to even think about it, I face-planted into the snow. Fortunately, it was snow and not ice or a hidden rock and I came out unscathed and unhurt. I can’t remember the last time I fell on the trail – I just can’t remember having fallen at all in years. Anytime I have read about someone face-planting, I have always thought...hmmm, how does one fall flat on their face? Well, as they say, pride goes before the fall and the trail reminded me that hubris is a karma target. 

We made it into Tom Floyd Wayside shelter shortly after and took a pack-off break for a light lunch. The PATC shelter caretaker arrived as well and we had a pleasant conversation about the conditions of the trail, shelter, and how some folks just can’t seem to understand that shelter graffiti isn’t cool or just how many fire pits does a shelter really need (we all thought one, but it seems others have thought three or four within feet of each other was a better idea). It wasn’t long before the chill pushed us back onto the trail to warm up and finish up the last 3 miles or so to the trailhead at Lake Front Royal. Once off the ridge, the trail did become a lot muddier and we slipped a few more times, but avoided the embarrassment of a fall. There are a couple of rock-hopping stream crosses in this stretch, but otherwise nothing spectacular to report – other than the squirrel that had to be the size of an adult cat. That squirrel had to be 10 pounds at least and the biggest one I think I have ever seen. Of course, it was too fast or shy to get a camera shot. 

We made it to Lake Front Royal late afternoon, with plenty of time to make it back home for dinner (despite the 2-hour drive back to the Chesapeake Bay). It’s nice to get into Shenandoah National Park even before spring, setting us up for a couple solid overnight or multiple night trips later in the year. We still have a 20+ mile stretch from Snickers Gap to Tucker Lane/I66 trailhead in northern VA to complete. After that it’s moving south further into Shenandoah and after that, southern VA. So far, the year of Virginia is off to a decent start and if we knock off the Shenandoah before fall, I would consider it a success. Anything south of Rockfish Gap this year will exceed expectations.

Quiet Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635181,"This is supposed to be the ""Year for Virginia,"" but an opportunity appeared to meet up with a former work colleague for a weekend on a PA stretch of the AT; so, my first short ass section hike (SASH) of 2021 is in my birth state of Pennsylvania. I haven't hiked in PA since I first started hiking as a teenager in the 1970s! The plan was to link-up on Friday night at a motel near Carlisle - about equidistant from his home in Pittsburgh and mine on the Chesapeake Bay. The hike: Pine Grove Furnace to Boiling Springs, around 19 miles. As often happens when two old friends meet, a few beers (maybe a few too many) were consumed Friday night, especially when they are 7.5% Tröegs Perpetual IPA. The shuttle (Mike's Shuttle - easy to arrange, on time, and friendly gentleman) was set for 7am Saturday in Boiling Springs. At 5:30am Saturday morning the alarm made ""my head hurt"" (""my feet (probably) stank"" and Jesus definitely would have been amused). But eggs, bacon and coffee at Waffle House made things more bearable.
Matt made the early drive up from Virginia to meet-up at the Fisherman Parking Lot in Boiling Springs, where we left our cars. Mike's Shuttle was right on time and had us by the AT Museum in Pine Grove Furnace SP in short time and we headed north. Fortunately, the first mile out is flat and easy because Jimmy Buffett's song still was bouncing around my hurting head. The first ascent out of Pine Grove Furnace is gradual - about 550ft - to Pole Steeple. We skipped the Blue Blaze out to the vista; first, my head was still a bit resistant to the whole hiking idea and second, the half mile round trip didn't seem worth a view of another valley. I am getting into the mode of unless it is an ""iconic"" vista, there are enough beautiful views right on trail instead of adding every Blue Blaze. A couple miles of ridge hiking and my head was back to normal (well what passes as normal). It didn't seem long before we thought about a lunch stop at James Fry (or Tagg Run) Shelter.
Our indifference to Blue Blazes hit again as we noted it went uphill to the shelter from the trail. And right next to the trail are some wide open campsites with inviting logs around the fire pits. Add the fact that Tagg Run flows right past the sites as well, we opted for a stream side lunch instead of a walk up to the shelter. We easily hiked the remainder of the afternoon, conversing about various plants along the trail and debating if it would be overly stressful to attempt to count the White Blazes (and other things like do arrows even count as blazes). Through the morning we encountered only a couple dayhikers along the trail. We did cross paths with Nick, who is flipping from Harpers Ferry, and his buddy Steve, who was along for the section. The sky was overcast and the temperature was comfortable; but there wasn't a lot of traffic on the trail for a pleasant spring Saturday.
We made our planned stopping point at a campsite next to Deer Run around 2:30pm. This will seem to most as too early to stop for the day, but 12 miles is our longest this season and since I am sash-ing the trail, there isn't a push for big mile days. Besides, I knew there was a fairly decent ascent to Rocky Ridge rock maze between us and the next shelter and didn't really want to deal with that at this point. Matt also had been up early to make the drive from VA to PA; so, it was best to stick to the plan. We set up camp - (first time for a full pitch of my new Big Agnes CopperSpurHVUL1 tent; will take some practice to get fast with the pole design) - gathered some wood for an early fire, had dinner, and were in our tents before the dusk twilight faded. It was also getting chilly - not cold, only low 40s - but it was enough to make us seek the warmth of our bags.

Quiet Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635254,"Stayed cozy most of the night, but did wake up at some point with a chilled head and closed up the hood on the mummy bag. Inevitably the urge to pee would interrupt my slumber. Wondered if I might delay going out into the chilly air until wake up time, but checked my phone and it showed 4am and I knew sunrise wasn't going to be until 6:30am. The temp showed 37degrees; so, it wasn't bad to get up, do business, and get back in a warm bag for a couple more hours. And it gave me the fortunate opportunity to see a star filled sky.
We usually try to wake up at first light, break camp, then have breakfast, and be on trail within an hour. I could see the light increasing through the tent walls as expected around 6:30am and made the move to get up. Quick new equipment review: plenty of space in my new Big Agnes CopperSpurHVUL1 tent and I especially like all of the mesh bin pockets inside and the awesome head room; the new NEMO Tensor pad was comfortable and it deflates much easier than my previous Klymit pad. It was chilly enough to wear my down jacket to pack up and cold enough that my finger dexterity was hampered, slowing down packing. Ultimately nothing that a couple cups of hot coffee didn't cure.
While finishing up breakfast, we were joined by Mountain Drew, a friendly older hiker that came into camp just before dark last night. He said he started around Delaware Water Gap and decided to hike because he has macular degeneration and figured he would try this thing before he went blind. He vaguely thought he was thru-hiking, but he was headed south so it wasn’t really clear what was his ultimate plan. Nevertheless, he was in good spirits, enjoying himself, and already had some trail and hostel stories to share. Amazingly, he said he never hiked or camped before starting this and was learning as he went, trading gear like a hatchet for a stove and other odd deals. Certainly a candidate for a character in a new Chaucer book of tales or Procol Harum ode. We lingered a bit longer than we would have without his conversation, but as always the time to hike pushed us onto the trail.
We only had about 8 miles to hike into Boiling Springs and finish this short ass section hike; so, no time penalty was incurred. That didn't come until the rock maze up on Rocky Ridge. While not really challenging or ""treacherous"" as my 7 year old grandson might say, there really was ""no maze to unwind,"" the rock scramble and the preceding ascent up the ridge did take us a bit more time than expected. The terrain validated our plan to stop when we did yesterday rather than push on to Alec Kennedy Shelter at the end of the day. Regardless, this stretch was the prettiest of the section with pines decorating the ridge and the maze gave us some entertainment. Certainly the best part of the hike. After the rocks, we only had the short climb up to Center Point Knob and a long downhill to the fields outside Boiling Springs to finish out the hike. Just south of the Knob, we did cross paths with a small Eastern Hognose snake right on trail that added some interest. By the time, we got down off the ridge and into the ATC owned fields outside Boiling Springs, the sun was high and the temperature felt in the 70s. A bright and sunny end.

Quiet Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640780,"The merry month of May was consumed by finishing up the school year and the decision to not return to teaching next year and fully retire. Since then I had to catch up on a lot of yard work and home chores. There were also some family events with our annual crab feast and having our grandson spend a week with us on the Bay. So, even though I am now officially ""retired,"" at the moment, it seems like all I can manage are day hikes to check off a few AT miles.It’s a bit shorter to get to the southern PA sections than it is to pick back up in Virginia. So, I headed up to Pen Mar Park for a day hike north to Deer Lick Shelters. The weather looked good at first, but a thunderstorm started dogging me from the west; so, I felt like I was looking and listening over my shoulder as I hiked. Added to the cacophony of cicadas always in the near distance, it was a bit of an odd hike. This stretch really doesn’t have much interest; no views and only one stream crossing early on after crossing the Mason Dixon Line. I did manage some photos of flora and fauna - always taking a moment to “stop and smell the roses” or at least take a photo of the wildflowers. Also, had a whitetail doe hike with me for about a quarter mile. Other than that minutia, the highlight was hitting 100 total AT miles. At this rate, I may have to live to 100 to reach 2000 miles, but I keep reminding myself that the journey is the goal and not the end point.
Deer Lick Shelters were kind of dark and dank on this overcast day. And the privy was a bit nasty. Not sure I would want to overnight here, but it was the best spot for the turn-around since I was doing this day hike as an 4.7 mile out-and-back. The thunderstorm to the west made a turn east and sounded like it was headed directly for Deer Lick; so, I had to decide to wait at the shelters for the storm to pass or cut short my lunch break and start back south. Since the storm was headed north and still off to the west, I decided to cut short lunch and head back to the Jeep. I prepared for rain, but only got a light drizzle for about 10 minutes that was mostly blocked by the forest canopy. So, fortune went my way this time.

My wife and I needed a getaway and headed to a favorite B&B in southwest Virginia near several wineries and breweries, and actually quite near the AT.  While she likes hiking and is supportive of my desire to notch AT miles, I try to make it not only about hiking during our getaways; especially longish hikes on the AT. I read about a short easy hike through an old train tunnel during one of our previous trips to the area; so, this time, we decided to check it out because it was near a brewery she wanted to visit. The Blue Ridge Tunnel is a 19th Century railroad tunnel near Afton, VA that actually goes beneath the Appalachian Trail near Rock Fish Gap! I didn't realize it at the time - poor map reconnaissance - on this hike we weren't on the AT, but under the trail! I suspect this is the only spot on the 2190+ AT that you can actually hike beneath the trail. Kind of cool and unique.

A day hike was the easiest option. The day and hike started out uneventful; however, the day would end with events that would soon break my heart. It may be appropriate that the first feature of the day was the damaged bridge over the East Branch Antietam Creek. A severe storm blew through this segment in early July and the bridge took a direct hit from a huge blow down. The huge tree broke the bridge in half, but it’s construction was very solid. The bridge was significantly damaged, but it was still sturdier than a much older bridge nearest the picnic area. Despite a posted detour, the bridge was quite passable. The 2.5 miles south to Deer Lick Shelter are fairly easy and I made quick time. The Deer Lick Shelters were just as uninviting as they were during my last visit despite the weather being more sunny. Out of curiosity, I walked up to the spring and discovered that the best campsites are for tents along the Blue Blaze. It also is not necessary to make the hike to the spring source because the water actually flows down hill and crossed the AT about 30 yards north of the shelters. Fortunately, I was able to share the info that the bridge was passable and the trail reroute was not necessary with a couple thru-hikers when I later paused at Deer Lick Shelter. There were quite a few thru-hikers taking short breaks at Deer Lick and I was able to offer some trail magic in the form of a couple beers to NOBOs Pappa Parmesan and Lunch Lady back at the Old Forge Picnic Area. This was a short easy day and I was headed back home by early afternoon. When I got home, Laško, our cat of 18 years and my best buddy, was eager to head out to the deck for some sunshine while I drank my usual post-hike beer. Laško had not been urinating much lately and his water intake seemed to be way down; so, we were monitoring this closely. In the past he had diabetes, liver, thyroid, and now kidney problems. He hadn’t urinated in more than 24 hours despite drinking water; so, my wife, an urgent care nurse practitioner, told me it was time to take him to the vet ER. The first news from the vet was not encouraging, as his kidney values were very high, indicating his kidney disease was very advanced. We kind of suspected this, but it didn’t make it any easier knowing for certain that his time was now likely days, maybe weeks, at best months. They started him on fluids for dehydration and we hoped that he could be stabilized enough to bring him home as soon as possible. My heart started breaking like the bridge I crossed twice earlier in the day.

Quiet Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641742,"Laško, our cat of 18 years and my best buddy, passed away quietly today at home in his favorite spot in the sun room overlooking the Chesapeake Bay. He wasn't a hiker, but he always helped me pack. And he was always ready for a post-hike beer on the deck. We were comforted by the fact that we could bring him home from the ER and hoped we would have more time. But instead we said our farewells and had one last beer together. I will always love and miss him.",,View Entry,"Jul 15, Thu",0
