Testing to see how easy or hard it will be, after all, I will be doing this journal using the iPhone out on the trail. So far so good, not too bad.

Rock n Roll,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660091,"Completed 3 day 2 night 31 miles, shakedown backpacking trip in the Ocala National Forest with a couple of friends. Cold the first night but cozy in the tent and sleeping bag, great weather overall. Lessons learned: triple check everything before you leave home, didn’t take my battery charger for my electronics. Took too much clothes (clothes bag too heavy and bulky and half not needed) And make sure the water bottle cap is tight before you throw it inside the tent….",,View Entry,"Feb 08, Wed",0
Rock n Roll,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660176,"I am an activity leader for the Florida Trail Association, Highlanders Chapter. I recently led a group of 32 hikers on a 6-mile hike on the FT. During the hike, I got many questions about my upcoming thru hike of the AT. Most questions centered around; hiking alone, how long will the thru hike take, what about bears and snakes, tent camping and food resupply. I was surprised at all the interest and questions; it all was a good and quite enjoyable. Showed me that many people are interested in hiking the AT and maybe even thru hiking one day. Of course, I told them about Trail Journals and this blog I will keep. A little self-promotion doesn't hurt :)",,View Entry,"Feb 16, Thu",0
Rock n Roll,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660281,"My second shakedown hike was another three-day two-night outing. A total of 31 miles on the Florida Trail in the north part of the Ocala National Forest. I believe I have all my gear ready and dialed in. Total backpack weight is 25 pounds including 2 liters of water and food for four days. Weather was clear all three days but warm, highs in the afternoon were in the mid to upper 80s!! I was hoping for some cooler weather for this hike, but I'm in Florida. Lessons learned this trip is to make sure all items are out of the tent before I break it down and pack it up. I keep forgetting to check the tent pockets and packed up my glasses, car keys, and knife in the tent! Panicked a little when I couldn't find these items, especially after going thru my already packed up backpack. What a relief to find everything. I don't think I'll forget making sure the tent is totally empty now before I pack it away!",,View Entry,"Feb 25, Sat",0

Lucky for me, another hiker had already called a different shuttle and they were more than happy to give me a ride into town, and no charge and wouldn’t accept anything! The trail provides.

I called ahead to the NOC (Nantahala Outdoor Center) and made a reservation for a bed in the the hiker bunk room, that gave me a goal to keep going during the day!

Then it was a snow covered trail and the further up I went the deeper the snow got, so I turned around and went home. Today was no snow and a beautiful day. I did get choked up when I realized I had past that point. I also got reaffirmed that it was the right thing to do back then as the trail continued to go up and higher.","NOC

First 3 miles today was up, and then a long 4,000 foot decent! It was steep at times but overall not too bad. The only problem was the constant downward slope causing my feet always bent down and by the end of the day the top of my right ankle was hurting. This caused me to go extra slow the last few miles. I don’t think the ankle is sprained or anything pulled, just fatigued. 
Exited the Smoky Mountain National Park today. The last 71.6 miles was all in the park. Check off one of my bucket list items, to hike the entire length of the AT that is in the Smokies!

To paraphrase Winnie the Poo; It was blustery out there on the AT today! Beautiful trail and great views all during the day. Went over bald mountain today which is the biggest mountain in this section. I also got surprised, snow!! It came down pretty hard and sideways in the wind….For about 5 minutes, then gone.

Still some high winds at times but I was at lower elevation today so not as fierce as the last couple days. I’m still in my trail family bubble and saw about 8 of them today. We all got together at a great Italian restaurant for dinner and talked about….what else, our hike and what the next few days has in store. Good companions and I’m glad I’m part of this group. Tomorrow I’m hiking out of Erwin and headed north, this time with my full pack and about 4 day supply of food, it will be much heavier than the slack packs for sure!!","Spivey Gap

Today was 8.4 miles from Erwin to Indian Grave Gap. Great day for hiking, good temperatures, no wind or rain. Once again saw many hikers along the trail that I knew or had meet before. An additional bonus today was that a local friend hiked with us the entire day. Thanks Marcia for driving us to the trailhead and hiking today, a great hiking day with a great friend.

Rock n Roll,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663396,"Full pack today with 4 days of food. Definitely heavy compared to slack packing with just a day pack and one day of food. I felt the extra weight. In addition the first part of the day was basically all up. However, there was a bonus at the top of the mountain because there was a very nice spruce tree forest with a bed of thick moss. We sat under the spruce trees on the moss and had lunch. Very serene place and it was a good rest. After starting the hike again we decided to stop at cherry gap shelter area for night. Many nice tent sites and picked a good spot. Today’s hike was short 3 miles from the planned 12 mile day but that’s ok. After a good rest tonight maybe we can add a couple miles tomorrow","Indian Grave Gap

I stepped wrong on a rock and thought I had twisted my ankle, but not, all is good. we stopped at the Kincora Hostel and met the owner Bob Peoples. The hostel is one of the first ones on the AT, been open 27 years and has hosted 25,000 hikers. Great conversation with Bob about hiking. He has done countless hours doing trail maintenance, building shelters and improving the AT. He also has several trail associations awards.

About noon we found some trail magic provided by a very nice group of people. AYCE bbq sandwiches, corn on the Cobb, lots of drinks, snacks, homemade cookies and cake and ice cream... so good and unexpected!

But quickly got warmer and off and on light rain starting around noon. I did see my first snake of the hike, I think a garter snake, trying to get alittle sun on the trail. We we’re going to a tent site about a mile past the shelter but as we got to the shelter the rain started coming down harder. We stopped and stayed in the shelter and lucky we did, all night it rained! It would have been miserable in the tent. Sometimes your best is not good enough and in a rain like this was, it could have got wet inside the tent,  not good. We were dry at the shelter.","TN 91

Wow, I’ve hiked from Springer mountain Ga to Virginia, hard for me to believe. 3.5 more miles from the state line we entered the town of Damascus where the trail goes right down Main Street.

For more than a week, everyday I start out good but by lunchtime I get fatigued, and through the afternoon the more fatigued I get and the slower on the trail I become. Doesn’t matter uphill or downhill, very slow. I think the daily hiking on the AT, trouble sleeping some nights, maybe lack of good nutrition when on trail and possibly not drinking enough water has got to me. Hopefully a couple days rest will renew me. Unfortunately, all my hiking buddies I’ve been hiking off and on with will be moving on and I’ll fall a couple days behind them. Hopefully I’ll see them again down the trail.","Damascus Va

Rock n Roll,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664208,"I had to get off trail. My body was getting very fatigued everyday the last couple weeks during the hike and I slowed way down in the afternoon. Probably a combo of not eating the right foods, lack of good sleep and rest and maybe getting too dehydrated. Plus my feet were hurting, feels like the bottom of my feet are made of cardboard with no real feeling! I made a very tough decision and flew home yesterday. 
So my thru hike attempt has turned into a long section hike of the AT, almost 1/4 of the way. I went 472 miles in two months, north Georgia to southern Virginia. Still not bad for an old man 😂
Maybe I’ll return to the AT next year and continue this amazing journey.",,View Entry,"May 21, Sun",0
