Fizzix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660309,"As many of you know, last year's attempt ended at mile 428.1 near Damascus, VA with a fall and a right leg broken in three places. It healed pretty well but over the Fall, I really never got past three days hiking without having to stop for two days of rest and recovery. That was not good enough to restart the trail and it wasn't good enough to get back in shape.  So around Thanksgiving, I gave up and  let the leg rest until January first.  Then I started slow.  For two weeks, I did 4 mile hikes without a pack.  I was able to go every day and that's really my key indicator for being ready to start.  Then I added a 16 pound pack on 4 mile hikes.  Then every week, I added a mile and 1 or 2 pounds to the pack.  By late February, I was at 7-8 miles and 22 pounds.  That's good enough to get on the trail for me because those hikes were all under 4 hours.  So I felt like a full day of hiking the AT could cover my starting goal of10 miles per day.For the the next two weeks, I plan on dropping back to 5-6 miles and keep increasing pack weight.  That should reduce the risk of a last minute minor injury that would delay the start.  Plus, I really need the extra couple of hours a day to get my To Do list under control.  I'm getting excited!  I feel ready to start and it's hard not to head to the trail now...",,View Entry,"Feb 27, Mon",0

Clare & I made it to Damascus, VA about noon. Rain almost the whole way from SC. But stopped while we were having lunch. Showers were forecast for the afternoon but heavy rain was past so decided to chance it. [Clare’s said: Awful weather, 40 degrees and raining.]. 
Started at 2:09pm Worked out great because all I had was a few very light showers and a lot of fog. I had a single 1100' up and down  which went surprisingly well. All in my pack was about 31 pounds which is 8 over where I ended training. Gonna be sore tomorrow and next day I am sure but it got done without problems. Very encouraging.
Mid point of the day…Top of the first mountain. Three miles from Damascus. All is well so far. 
Hike On!
Stopped about 5:00 so I had plenty of time to set up camp since I knew I'd be rusty.  Had chicken with stuffing for dinner and now at 7:00 I'm all snuggled in under my new quilt. Another first tonight. It's starting to drizzle outside - right on time with the forecast. But I'm warm and dry inside the tent. Saw 4 day hikers today but no other thru hikers.  I expect it to be pretty quiet during the week.  I'm in the Grayson Highlands area which is super popular. So who knows???Many many thanks to all of you for supporting this crazy adventure.

Anyway the day started with a 3 mile 2200' climb to get the motor running. With 2 inches of fresh snow that took 3 hours to do. I heard you can break a leg out here so I went slow.
Topped the hill and it was a bald which I wasn't expecting. 40 mph winds- it was cold. Decided not to try for the next shelter and stopped wt 3:30 to get warm and eat. One had pop tarts at that point.  Water was frozen and couldn't cook lunch. 
So I stopped and pitched the tent and thawed water. Don't ask it was crazy. First melt snow to pour n bottles etc. It was 28 inside the tent a 4:00. It's down to 22 at 6:30. Probably hit teens tonight.  So focus now is to stay warm. All is well.","

Passed the 500 mark today. Yay. A good indicator that I'm making progress.
I bet you are wondering how cold it was last night. 14 in the tent!  Lot of wind. So it was a good decision to bed down early.  I was fine - didn't even need to put on extra clothes to stay warm although I put my puffy over my face to keep it warm.
Sun came out early so the trail mostly cleared off. Never got above freezing because water was an issue. Had to ""camel"" from source to source. No way to carry it. Luckily there were enough streams. One spring had to be an artesian well it was flowing in surges. Unexpected this high up.
Passed by Mt. Roger's highest point in VA. 5700 something I think. Only one 1000' climb today so I made extra miles. Also too cold to sit and rest -- just kept plodding on. 
Saw another 4 people today but they drove up. Wimps! Two more on the trail. Might get to Dickeys Gap tomorrow. Have a resupply box in Troutdale. Hopefully it will be above freezing tomorrow.

Long day to push for getting to Troutdale but there weren't any big hills so it was easy- NOT. warm and sunny also helped.  Picked up my first resupply box and that worked like a champ.

The water can best be termed ""liquid stink.""I've taken pictures but haven't been able to send them because I've had no data. Hopefully in two or three days I'll be close enough to I81 to get some. 
Troutdale was a bit of a surprise. One church, bank, fire station and a post office. Maybe a dozen homes??? You can tell at one time it was much busier and it's probably the hub for many miles. Not big enough to get cell service though. I'm sending this text by standing next to the church's cross on top of the hill. A little sore but actually better than expected. I'll probably pay for the big miles tomorrow. Only ten planned to my next stop. Rain showers all day but reasonably warm.  I can live with that.

Good day for miles. Showers off and on all day but never enough to warrant a rain coat. Sleeping in a shelter tonight because tents aren't allowed for several miles around this point. Two other guys with me. Passed 2 more on the trail. Hasn't been a single day that I haven't seen at least 4 people.
Got my ear phones and white noise app in case they snore. It's 8:00 as I write this and I'm already under my quilt. Tomorrow night is supposed to be in the teens again, forecasted to be 12 degrees. So we (me and the guys I shared the shelter with last night) are all going to hold up at the Long Neck Lair alpaca farm/hostel in Atkins VA.

It was a cold 11 mile hike into Atkins. I made the decision pretty early in the day not to hike on Sunday.  Not an especially difficult day in general but about 5 mile descent into Atkins. About half was pretty rocky. I’m still cautious with the ankle/leg and I’ve never been very fast downhill so I didn’t get into town until 4:00.
Ate at the Sweetwater Venue restaurant on the way to the hostel. It was a fish fry night and was delicious. I’m sure they don’t do it every night but I was lucky and ate my fill. On to the Alpaca Farm and warmth. Staying with two other hikers in the bunk house and enjoying the company — Mini HaHa and Surefoot.","MM 534

In Atkins, VA taking a “zero”.  That means I am not going to hike any miles on the trail. The weather forecast was for 18 last night and 12 tonight. The high today was never going to get above freezing so water was going to be an issue. I am staying at the Long Neck Lair farm/ hostel/ BnB.  It’s great. Highly recommended if you are going to be in the area.
Taking that zero!  Went through my food bag and organized it this morning for the next two and half days. That will get me to the next stop and resupply. Quiet day. So if you have any burning questions, text them to me. A good day for clarifying any confusion I have so far created.","

A cold start this morning. It was 19 at 8:30 when I started but no wind and sunny. So believe it or not, I was almost too warm after a couple of miles. Passed a big milestone - the quarter way point to Katahdin. Still a long way to go but an achievement for three partial years. I feel good. 
First time I have had a little pain in my right ankle. Not bad but I was happy to stop walking on it this afternoon.  It feels much better after some Voltaren and food. 
Trying to make it to Burkes Garden hostel tomorrow where I have another resupply box waiting.  It’s 13 miles away and I’ll have to see how the ankle does.  If I have to there is a tent spot 8 miles from here and a shelter 11.  I can stop at either of those and walk in the next day.   That’s how it works on the trail. Every day is different and plans have to adapt. Weather is supposed to be excellent!

Butt kicker today. The miles weren’t bad but there was a 800’, 900’ and 2100’ climb in that order. Would have much easier had they been reversed. A two thousand foot mountain in the afternoon is at my limit right now. Easier in the morning when legs are fresh. But I got it done and made it to the hostel. It’s an old Amish barn that is being converted. And it’s beautiful. Burkes Garden Hostel. 
Burkes Garden is a four by eight mile limestone sink hole!  The picture shows it off. Appears to me to have dropped about a thousand feet. That is a big sinkhole. It happened long ago so I don’t think anyone was bothered.
Also had to ford a stream about 20 feet wide; water was 10-12 inches deep and cold!!! I went barefoot. The bottom was smooth river rock - a little slippery but otherwise ok. Needless to say, I went as fast as possible. 
Going to try for a smaller day tomorrow. I’m getting a little tired with all the 13 mile days. I’m glad I can do them this early but I don’t want to overdo it early and slow my progress in the long run.","MM 558 Ceres, VA

Even though it was a short mileage day, it was still tough. Only about 1200' of 'up' but the trail was 90% rocks.  Very hard on my feet -- they are complaining tonight! Also very mentally stressing as you have to really watch every step to keep from falling. Very light rain was falling most of the day and with some wind it was a little chilly.  When it wasn't raining, the trail was in the clouds so there was never a good view. Definitely not as much fun as a sunny day. 
On the plus side, I had a couple of hiking buddies today - Shades and Blaze. The most amazing team I have ever seen. Shades is visually challenged and Blaze is her guide dog. The two of them were just unbelievable to watch. With direction from Blaze, Shades went over, under and around every obstacle that I did without being able to see them. Living proof that to walk the AT, you have to really want it -- the rest can be overcome. WOW!","MM 571 - Burkes Garden Hostel - Tazewell, VA

Gotta love the AT. Two days ago we were all freezing and today in the low 70’s. You have to be ready for anything.
I spent the first four miles with Shades & Blaze this morning then they caught a ride to a hostel for the evening.(Photos included under ‘photos’).I wish I could really convey to you how difficult what they are doing is. The AT is a huge challenge on a minute by minute basis. You have to choose your path and foot placement so precisely at times — watching them do it as a team is fascinating. She spent two years training Blaze to do the work needed on the trail. A real inspiration — their work has spread up and down the trail. Everyone we met already knew who they were. 
I clocked another 7 after leaving them. I wanted to go only 5 or so but made a water mistake. Thought there was a source that turned out not to be there. So I was very dry getting into camp. On the plus side, I should have real breakfast at a restaurant tomorrow. Yum yum!!!

Small objectives keep you going.  This hike was more like what I expected VA to be like. A climb up to a ridge that you run for a few miles then down -- repeat.  The ridge runs are where I make my time. Slow up - slow down. But able to do 2 or more mph on the ""flats"". Again another super dry day. I had trouble finding water at the shelter which is very unusual.

Well, I'm up Dismal Creek without a paddle although I don't know why I'd need one.  Three days that felt like I was in the desert and today I was near water half the day. The last good source I saw yesterday was Kimberling Creek near Bastian. I literally stepped across it in one step. This afternoon I crossed it again on a 60' hanging bridge. Unbelievable how fast it grew. Then up a 400' hill and I walked near to Dismal Creek for 4 miles. Anyway, I drank my fill today. 
Hit a bit of a wall today after lunch.  Just couldn't seem to get going. When I first got to Dismal I drank a full liter of water- it was so cold and nice!  Then I ate some sugary trail mix and after 20 minutes of rest things started getting better. 
The last half of the walk was through pine forests which is very pleasant. Nice soft needles to walk on and that smell is heavenly. Lots of roots to watch out for though. Started setting up camp around 5:00 and just got in the tent when it started to shower. Better to be lucky than good!","MM 604

At Doc's Knob shelter tonight alone. That's always nice. First time this trip.  This is one of the most unusual shelters I have seen. It has a large deck on the front with benches and an Adirondack chair for two. I kid you not! I got here early- about 3:30 and really wanted to go another couple of hours but water situation going forward prevented that.  If I went on there were no reliable sources so I would have had to carry enough to finish today and get through 10 miles tomorrow. So I stayed and used the time and sunshine to set out some clothes and my quilt.  Also planned out the resupply stops for the next two weeks. I’ll be in Pearisburg sometime tomorrow afternoon. Next stops look like Catawba,  Troutville and Glasgow. All are close to the trail and have grocery stores so they make good stops.  I'm still carrying too much food. First thing I want to do at the hostel (Angels Rest) is weigh what I brought in. I really need to dial this in better. I think is going to be 5-7 pounds. Just dead weight!  I think because I'm moving faster than planned, I'm always carrying a day and a half extra. Always some problem that needs to be solved.

So today was a first for me. I did a “slack pack”. Basically, the hostel takes me down the trail (north) and drops me off and I walk back towards the hostel (south). I’ll actually stay at the hostel again tonight. What’s the advantage, you ask. The slack part!  I didn’t carry my gear - only food and water for the day.  Which means my pack weighed about 10 pounds instead of 30 something.  Much easier on the knees!  Usually, slack packing is much faster because of the reduced effort. That didn’t turn out to be the case for me. Getting through the rocky parts, especially downhill, is my limiting factor. Being lighter didn’t help all that much. Still, I did get a 20 mile day in. Tomorrow I’ll start at the same place and go the normal north direction.
Spent a lot of the day hiking along the state border with WV.  Cool for me, since I’m a real, live hillbilly from there.  In fact, it felt like I could almost see Beckley. 
Oh, wild goats - I almost forgot about them. They live along this stretch of trail and are very friendly. I shushed them away with my poles - they’ll actually eat your clothes right off you.

Whew!  Tough day. Two of the 12 miles were like Rocksylvania and took over 2 hours to navigate. Small medium and large boulders all scattered together. Extremely hard on ankles and knees and believe it or not on your brain. Since I had to decide on every single step, my brain actually needed a break twice to reset. I was getting a headache from the concentration. I did not think I would get to the shelter tonight. 
Fortunately, after clearing the rock field, had about three miles of flat easy to rest on.  Then back to three miles of regular downhill - not easy but getting used to it. Staying with three other really interesting people tonight: Eyore (sic) yes the donkey.  Fearsome and Hero. Look them up on Facebook. Inspirational women keep showing up on the trail. Very sore feet tonight. Hopefully they'll recover over night.  Rain is coming - been lucky so far.

At Sarver Hollow Shelter. It's one of those good news/bad news shelters. It's pretty new, very large with a roofed deck on front. That's the good. The bad: it's 0.4 miles off the trail straight down. I hate walking that far to get to a shelter. And tomorrow it will be 0.4 straight back up. And these miles don't count in the totals either. Blah!
So why choose here? Very good question! I actually made a mistake - yes, you heard it here first. I had lunch in a shelter about 6 miles back and should have stayed there. Rain was in the forecast but less than a quarter of an inch. Not too bad so I decided to keep going. It started off and on drizzle as soon as I started which is what I was expecting.  But the intensity kept increasing. After a couple of hours it was a full on rain storm.  And I still had to go up a 1000' hill. The climb was on very slick clay, standing water and rock stairs. Not a very inviting combination. As I got about half way up, I actually ended up in the clouds. Visibility was about 100 feet. Did I mention the wind?  Oh it was blowing 40 mph at the top. Temperature was in the low 50s so it was getting cold and I was soaked in places I didn't even know I had. Yes I was wearing rain gear but those rains go through everything eventually.
Walking along the top I passed by dozens of rock piles about 6-8 feet high and in diameter.  To me they looked like burial mounds.  I began to wonder if maybe that's where they put dumb AT hikers they found frozen on the mountain! Well, I wasn't really in danger of freezing. But those conditions are prime for hypothermia. So I kept moving to keep my body temperature up - I felt like stopping to eat or drink would be a mistake. I finally got to the side trail for the shelter at 6:00 pm - 5 hours to cover 7 miles. It was brutal. Took another 30 minutes to descend the 0.4 mile to the shelter. I had been planning my course of action for the last hour. As soon as I got under roof, I dumped my pack, blew up my air mattress and set up the quilt. I stripped naked - some scenes are graphic:-) - and used my towel to get as dry as possible. Then quick into my sleep clothes which are always double bagged so they are dry f or this very situation. St this point, I expected to be shivering and would need to climb in bed to get warm. But I wasn't too bad surprisingly. Not warm or hot - that's the first symptom of hypothermia. So I actually grabbed a couple of candy bars to eat for the calories. I wasn't going out in the rain to get enough water to cook with. I had enough to drink - that would do.
Then I spread out all my stuff to let it drip dry as much as possible. Under the quilt at about 8:00. My last thought was ""it's okay to use the whole shelter - nobody is coming down here this late at night.""Well......
At 9:15 I hear two guys coming up to the shelter from down! the hill. They come on to the deck and they are in camouflage. What????…Turns out they are cadets from VMI. They had evacuated one of their group with a sprained ankle and were supposed to rendezvous with the other 15 at the shelter. The other group was on the AT but couldn't find the side trail for the shelter. 
Fortunately both groups had radios and could communicate.  With their maps and the landmarks I had seen on the way in, we were able to figure out where they were and the two leaders went up and brought them in. 
I gathered my stuff back into a reasonable area and at about 2200 hours (we were now an operating military group) the whole group of 17 showed up. They strung some tarps around the deck to block the wind and rain - still had both - no signs of slowing down. Then broke out their sleep gear and good - MREs of course! Believe it or not, within an hour all were fed and sleeping. Very well organized and disciplined group of you no people. It was one of the most interesting days on the trail I have ever had. What, in the afternoon had seemed a disaster, turned out to be very rewarding.

0700 and the troop wakes up, eats and hits the trail by 0800. Eventual destination is McAfee Knob about 50 miles away - they planned to be there in three days and I'd bet money they made it!It's still raining so went back to sleep! About 10:00 am (back on civilian time), the rain stopped and the sun came out. I put everything out in the sun. When my pants, shirt and shoes were somewhere between wet and dry but acceptable I started packing up to go. 
Made it to the top of the hill at noon and was off hiking again.  I made it to the next shelter six miles away at about 4:00. Should have been quicker but three of the miles were on ""ledges.""  An AT term I have come to translate as large boulders mixed with sloping smooth rocks whose intent is to kill you. Hands and feet were often needed to make way forward. The wind was still howling with strong gusts. Twice as I heard one approaching, I dropped to a knee to keep from being toppled.  It wasn't really dangerous as much as it was focusing. You absolutely had to be 100% on task to get through this part. And I was so I did. The sun was warm so when I arrived at the shelter I decided to hang stuff out to dry there rather than hike another 4 miles or so.

Todays problem: a bridge is closed on the trail. What to do?  The recommendation is for a 5 mile road walk around the area. Never fun so not my first choice.

Weeelll, upon arrival it's a little more than a creek - more like a small river!  With all the recent rain, it's flowing like gangbusters. The water is deep at the bridge but upstream looks to be a place where it might be possible to ford. After giving it a good look, I decided I would not do it alone. Too dangerous as there was a lot of deadfall in the water downstream. No road walk. No ford. How did I get across?  Not saying. The bridge was closed NOT destroyed. 
Now up Brush Mountain 1600' a decent climb but with really good surface. So not bad at all. At the top was the Audie Murphy memorial. He was America's most decorated WWII veteran and died in a plane crash there. Was headed to a campsite at 701 but found this beautiful one at 699 and decided it was too good to pass up.

Good news. Passed 700 today only 1500 to go. Gulp!  Man, this was a tough six mile stretch. A lot of what's, unfortunately, becoming normal - the boulder walk on top of the ridge line. But after that comes the Dragon's Tooth. A very technical (in hiking terms that means really hard and steep that requires both hands and feet to traverse) descent of about 300 feet then just normal 900 after that. I actually didn't find it as hard as it was built up in my mind. Mainly because weather was ideal today. In rain, it would be virtually suicide. It's a popular destination and there was a lot of traffic. But it was fun at the same time - no room for error. Staying at a nice hostel called Four Pines. Very laid back and peaceful. Only one other hiker here tonight. He's 34 and we had a long discussion about parenting and life in general. I think I may have done some good. I hope so. Next stop is Troutville. It's 26 trail miles away. Unfortunately, doesn't appear to be any way to break it into two 13 mile days.  I'll be crossing McAfee Knob in the middle which limits places to stop. I hope I can get 12 in leaving a 14 day to go. There's a shelter at 10 and maybe I can get some advice from a SOBO that I pass. Tomorrow's problem....","MM 699

Well, it turns out you can break the hike into two 13 mile days. All you have to do is pitch your 8x7 tent in a 9x8 spot. I'll try to send a picture. Basically, I'm on top of one those ledges I talked about a couple of days ago. Wedged in between the rocks and a pretty sharp drop off - not a cliff, that just wouldn't be safe! Paaalenty of room. So I thought you might be interested in tonight's dinner. I haven't talked much about how we eat out here. It's not very pretty.   I try to meet two basic criteria which are completely different from normal life. I try to get as close to 1000 calories in each meal as I can.  Then snacks during the day add another 1000 or do. I also try not to carry any food that is less than 100 calories per ounce.  But you can't always do both.
This was dinner:Tuna, beans and quinoa packet. Lots of good protein and stuff but only 160 calories in a 5 ounce package. Clearly a loser on rule two!  I added a package of six Oreo cookies - no real nutritional value but 320 calories. I had two hard boiled eggs that I hope were about 100 calories each. Then for dessert, a share size pack of peanut M&Ms worth another 450 calories and some protein too. Pushing me over the thousand mark and perhaps getting an award for the strangest meal combo yet.
You eat what you have to eat - and can get. My last resupply was from a gas station so I was lucky to get tuna packs.  That's why hikers dream of real food that can be had in town.  Like tomorrow when I hit Troutville. Look out first restaurant I walk past!!!*side note added by ‘blog assistant’ on the calories eaten today…78 calories - 6g protein in a large egg79 calories - 16g protein in 2.6oz tuna222 calories in 1c quinoa - a superfood","MM 704

Made it into Troutville today. Staying at BeeCH Hill hostel. Had a pretty nice walk into town. For awhile it looked like it was going to be a breeze but the AT laughs at those thoughts. I passed by a shelter about 10 am that was really nice and had second breakfast.  Great water source and nice, wide smooth trail. Since it was 7 miles to town I had a feeling it might just finish out that way. The locations that are close enough for other than long distance hikers to get to easily are usually in better shape. So I made the next three miles in an hour!  That felt really good and I was having fun  with just the hiking piece.
But alas shortly after that point, the trail turned back into the rocky track I have seen a lot in the last 80 miles. But I’m feeling stronger and more confident than even a week ago and made it to the hostel. 
I was expecting to have a town walk through city streets for the last mile but the ATC has somehow managed to preserve a narrow corridor of “wilderness”. Lots of road noise from I-81 but otherwise, visually, it seemed you were still in the mountains. You couldn’t see any “town”.  The exception was crossing US 220 - possibly the riskiest thing I’ve done yet!  Grabbed a shower, some loaner clothes and a ride to the BBQ.

Staying with hiker Fortune who has a YouTube channel documenting his AT adventure. Take a look - you’ll get to see some stuff. Search for “Fortune Adventures.”  Taking some grief about my trail dinner a couple of nights ago. Contrast with my town dinner tonight. Went to a Cracker Barrel and had the 8 ounce hamburger steak topped with onions and brown gravy and sides of steak fries and broccoli.  Fortune had different sides.  It was so good we both had another. Waitress thought we were joking; it was her first experience with “hiker hunger.”  There is no way I could have done this back in the “real world.” But right now I am pleasantly satisfied. No idea where it goes…

A little catch up. Easter was a fabulous food day on the AT. And you've probably picked up on how important that is to every hiker.  There is a Trail Angel named Fresh Ground who I've heard about for years but I thought was just a myth. Turns out he is very real. He drives up and down the AT in his white van/ kitchen and makes real meals for hikers. I was lucky enough to get three meals in a row from the Leapfrog Cafe. Easter lunch and dinner and breakfast the next day.  There were hikers literally running into his Cafe once they heard where he was. It is not possible to overstate what he means to the long distance hiking community. Many, many thanks to him!

First full day in my ""summer"" gear and it felt great. I pulled in to John's Hollow shelter at 3:30 with time and energy to spare -- at least a little of the latter. Would have liked to put 1-3 more miles in but the topo map did not look promising for finding any campsites going up the next mountain. Big climb tomorrow. A bit over 2000' in under 3 miles so it will be steep. Water also challenging for the next 10 miles so it will be a 'heavy'  load tomorrow morning. But I'm getting used to it - maybe I'm finally getting some trail legs. Went over the James River this afternoon on the longest footbridge on the AT. It was almost 1000' long.

Passed 800 today!  8 down 14 to go. Those milestones make for a happy day.  I feel pretty good this evening. I managed 13 miles with over 4000' of vertical -- one half mile of which rose 700'.  That's a 26% gradient!!!  Most treadmills max out at 12-15%. You can't even simulate that kind of a climb. But it was gratifying to make and not feel like I was gonna die. Temps were outrageous today--86 on my thermometer. So glad to have my summer clothes -- bless you Clare!  I don't think I would have made the second top in my long pants and shirt. It was a dry climb; no water for the first 9 miles. So I started out with 3 liters which weighs about 7 pounds. And I arrived at the water source bone dry which was perfect. I didn't carry any extra up the hill. Unbelievable camp site tonight. Right on a large creek. I set up my tent so I am looking at it. Soaked my feet, washed my shirt and socks. Felt good to knock the days sweat off. On a more somber note, I passed the memorial for Ottie Cline Powell. I'm sure you can find the story online so I won't go into details.

And then needed to do a 9 mile, no water hike up 2000'. So I was carrying about 19 extra pounds up the mountain. Oh, and then it decided to rain. Yuk.It was a tough mental climb. Twice I stopped to check out a tent spot and was ready to check out for the day. But neither panned out so I kept walking eventually making it to the top. The good part of water weight is that it goes away as you drink and well, you know. I kinda got a second wind. The top was pretty and had good trail so I got moving pretty good. Then, of course, the AT does its thing and it's down another thousand feet. At this point, there was a shelter but it was 0.6 miles downhill and I hate to walk that far off trail for a shelter. It was 4:30 so I sat down to evaluate my options. Next campsite was 3 more miles up on the other side of that thousand I just gave up.  I had just enough water and time and thought I had enough energy left in the legs so on I went. About a quarter mile up the hill, I see two Gatorade bottles propped against a rock. Trail Magic! I downed one which was a huge boost and thought that was a sign. At the top, I found myself on a bald which wasn't mentioned in anything.  So I had a nice mile walk on relatively flat grassy trail. A real Godsend--as easy as the AT ever gets. I got into camp dry as a bone - would have been tough without that Gatorade. A common hiker saying is: the Trail provides.

At 2:00 am I had to yell for them to turn down their music. They did but it started up again at 5:00. This time included words related to bodily insertions. The short message was I did not get much rest. Fairly typical walking day -- up and down, repeat, repeat. It's getting much warmer and I'm even more thankful to be in shorts. Can't wait for the leaves to come in so we can get some shade. Had a decent cool breeze most of the day and I found myself stopping in the shade of large tree trunks. Talk about desperate!  About 2:30, I stopped at a shelter for a late lunch and decision on where to stop. My 13 mile mark would put me at one of those car accessible points on a Saturday night. That ain't happening again.  Fooled me once - shame on you. Fooled me twice - shame on me!  Next good stop would be at 15 miles after another long climb at Priest shelter.  A bit of a press but had a point at mile 11 where I could stop short if I didn't think I would make it.  I pick up my pack and in walks Li’l Engine.

Back on the Trail!Finished my visit with the family yesterday - it was wonderful. Anna Marie is a doll but no surprise at that. Got to see all the older kids play soccer which was a lot of fun for me. Clare dropped me off around 10:00 this morning and with much trepidation, I got back to it. I have to admit to being somewhat concerned after taking 10 days off.  So I was pleased to have a pretty easy trail today for the most part. Pine forests make the softest trail surface and I had a lot of that. Some rocky hills to go up and down but all pretty small - less than 500 feet anyway which is starting to seem small. I managed to keep my overall speed above 2 mph but the easy day had a lot to do with that. 
So I finished up just outside Boiling Springs, PA. The trail passes right through town and there’s an ATC regional center along the way too. I came down the last of the Blue Ridge mountains today. Been on them since Springer in GA.  Tomorrow I cross the Cumberland Valley and go up into the Allegheny mountains. There will be a big change in the geology and I expect the mountains to get really rocky. 
But for today— I made it to my destination and feel pretty good. I’m sure that I won’t feel this good tomorrow but I’m happy at the moment.

Second day back did bring some issues. My left hip bothered me most of the day. Just felt like it wasn't getting loose or something. Uphill steps were painful. Flat and down were fine. Fortunately, today had the most flat miles I have ever seen and possibly will ever see. Today I crossed the Cumberland Valley- about 14 miles of almost dead flat. I spent about two hours during the day resting the hip and taking vitamin I. Ibuprofen. By 4:00 it seemed okay just in time for the climb back up into the mountains. So all in all my strategy worked. I arrived at the shelter feeling pretty good. 
So yesterday ended my hike through the Blue Ridge Mountains. After crossing the valley, I will be hiking the Allegheny mountains for awhile. Geologically very different and the beginning of Rocksylvania. Todays uphill was not very difficult but the rocks were definitely different. Didn't see any limestone. The rocks are much harder probably some kind of shale. Very dark in color and having sharper more planar edges. I did see some chunks of sandstone as well. Clare took some more cold weather stuff back and substituted some warm stuff in. The net was a loss of 2 pounds or so. My base weight is 15.5 pounds now. Much better than the start of 20-21.  Felt much better     
One other first for today. I ate ""town food"" three times! I had breakfast in Boiling Springs to start the day. I was passing by Carlisle at noon and wanted to rest the hip again so I walked a quarter mile of trail to a diner and had a gyro platter. Then just before crossing I81 for the last time (I think), I passed an Amish farm stand and got a pint of homemade ice cream!  It was delicious!!! I was so full, I stopped by a river and took a half hour nap. Sometimes this backpacking thing is just sooooo difficult. 
Buttoned down in my tent for the night. Hope the hip is back to normal tomorrow. Stay tuned to find out.","MM 1122

NERO today. Walked into Duncannon today to do a resupply and overnight at the Kind of Outdoorsy hostel. It feels really good to put NERO and 12 miles in the same report. Remember when a full day was 10 or 11 miles!!!  I averaged just over 2 mph for the day. The hip felt pretty good today - only a little soreness to deal with. 
Had a wonderful spaghetti dinner at the Christ Lutheran Church.  They do it for hikers from May to September. What a fabulous ministry. They had a table of things hikers need like toothbrushes to take what you need. Really fun ladies to talk with as well. Tomorrow going to try an 18 mile slack pack back into town.

Slack pack out of Duncannon today. Wanted to give the hip one more day of ""rest"". I carried only food, water and emergency gear. Pack probably weighed 12 pounds - it was like carrying air.  Easy to see why ultralight is so desirable. The first hour uphill was 2.46 miles!!! It felt like I was flying. 
Saw something today that was completely unexpected.  I passed a group of 12 Amish women hiking!  It was actually an interesting sight. They were in traditional clothing and pretty decent backpacking gear. Anyway, I think it's pretty cool that they were out there. 
So the numbers of the day were 18.4 miles in almost exactly 9 hours so I kept my 2 mph target speed.  It's easy to see the appeal.  Back to normal hiking tomorrow.","MM 1150

I wanted to a tent site 15 miles out but realized in the afternoon that it was Friday. This site was close to a road and my past experiences made me leery of that. Next good site with ester was another 7 miles and I felt like two 18s in a row was too much.  So I stopped short. Passed a lot of coal mining stuff in the area which was fun for me. Even one drift mouth that was still open. Should have been closed but wasn't.First hour uphill with a 30 pound pack was 1.68 miles.

Ok. Today was really unbelievable. I started at 7:00 am and was at the shelter at 4:00 pm. So 18.3 miles in 9 hours including all the stops and breaks! I've never done 2 mph over a whole day. I usually go much faster in the morning than in the afternoon. Today I did the last 2 miles in 45 minutes. That works out to 2.67 mph. I think maybe something switched out my body this week. 
I'm starting to feel like a real thru hiker. Staying inside a cool cabin tonight and it has a caretaker that keeps things going.  Only long distance hikers allowed. We all ordered food from town and had it delivered.  Nice reward for a good day hiking.","MM 1179

Great day today from a “milestone” perspective.  Passed 1200 miles so 12 down 10 to go. Amazing to be going “downhill “ now.  At the same time, I passed the 1000 miles to Katahdin point. So from now on, I only have  3 digit miles to go!  Might not seem like a lot but it feels really good to me.
It was a Rocksylvania kind of day as well. Several boulder fields to cross which are a little rough. For me, it’s not really a physical challenge as much as a mental one. It takes a ton of continuous concentration to pick a path and not FALL.  I’m really interested in not doing that again. So far, so good - knock on wood!","MM 1197

Today was a bit of a disappointment. Not because of hiking but because of food!  I passed down off the trail into the town of Port Clinton through which the trail passes. It was about noon so I was really hoping to get a town meal in. Unfortunately, PC only had two restaurants and they were both closed on Monday and Tuesday. Double dang. No gas station or convenience store to even get a sandwich. The only thing open was a really cool candy store that specializes in the old timey stuff we had as kids. It was fun to look through and I got a couple of bars from my youth that I hadn’t seen in decades. I also managed to get a couple of bottles of Gatorade and a coke for the fizz in Fizzix. I ate my jerky with the coke for lunch. Not a fresh sandwich but better than nothing. Used the Gatorade for the climb back out of town. That was a nice part of the day. That climb would have been hard several weeks ago but not was not that bad. I would not call it easy but I felt pretty good when I got to the top. More boulder fields but, hey, what’s new?  Made it to Windsor Furnace shelter for the evening where I set up my tent. Why tent at a shelter you might wonder?  Well, the tent is more private than the shelter for one. Imagine sleeping in the shelter being like sleeping side by side on the floor with 5-7 others. It can get crowded and you have to change clothes under your quilt. Just inconvenient compared to being alone in a tent.
Also, I can get to sleep a little earlier and stay a little longer. In the shelter, once the first person gets up you kinda have to also. If it’s going to rain I try to stay in the shelter. The tent keeps me perfectly dry but it gets wet and has to be packed away wet in the morning. That makes it heavy - not really - it’s probably only an ounce or two of water but it weighs on the mind. Get it!","MM 1211

Fizzix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664489,"Day 73 20 mi MM 1246Hiked into the Lookout Hostel today. The place is fabulous. It has everything a hiker wants and an incredible view out over the valley.   It is advertised as “light resupply” which means you can get things to supplement what you have and stretch out the time before a full resupply.  But I could easily have done a full resupply here.  Reasonable prices as well.  Only downer was I was in a tent and there was a lot truck air-brake noise.  
Have I mentioned before the road noise in PA?  Well, it pretty bad.  Interstates seem to flank the AT for large sections. There has rarely been a place where you can’t hear road noise. Right now as I sit in a shelter, I can still hear the trucks. Not a lot for sure, but at till there. Hiking was a tale of two cities today. Morning was really heavy on rocks and so was slow. But the last 5 miles was mostly clear of rocks and flat. With a good surface, I did the last 4.1 miles in 70 minutes.  That works out to 3.5 mph!   Woo hoo!","MM 1226

Meeting the ladies tomorrow at the hostel but still got a full day in. Pretty typical PA day which means a lot of rock scrambling. But today featured a one special enough to be named “Knife’s Edge”. What makes it so special is that you can fall off on either side of the mountain as opposed to only one!  My method was to put one foot on each side and then not fall in a sitting position.  Worked. Shoes held on and I was upright the whole time.

My ""twin Lizzies"" made it here. (Both ladies are named Liz - so I use that name when referring to them collectively.  When I need to be specific, I use their Men in Black names:  K and C. Short and sweet.)We started the day off by touring the Lookout Hostel and talking to hikers still there. I reminded them several times that most hostels aren't that nice. But it gave them a good feel. Next came some instruction on the use of hiking poles. I am a big believer in them and  feel all new hikers should give them a try.  On level ground they don't do a lot unless you are in Rocksylvania where they help to prevent tripping falls. On uphills, they can reduce the workload on the legs by 25% if used properly. Course your arms get tired - but, hey, there's no free lunch. On downhills, they again prevent falls which are much more serious than on level ground.  But they also reduce the impact load on knees and help cushion the steps.The ladies managed to do two outbound miles which of course comes with two return miles. A very respectable 4 mile AT hike!  They met 10 hikers in that 4 mile hike - so much for being lonely, right?  There were 7 men, 2 women and a dog in that sample.  Ten percent is heavy on the dogs and twenty is a little light on the women based on my experience. We ate several times during the day - a thru hiker's dream and plotted the next day.","1261

Fizzix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664494,"Day 76 0 miles. Started the day by going back to last night's restaurant where I had left my wallet. Next, we did a cave tour (I've forgotten the name already) that was very educational. (Editor note: Crystal Cave). It wasn't a big cave but they really maximized the opportunity to learn.  Our group included 3rd and 4th graders which were a hoot to watch and very well behaved. Next stop was a diner style restaurant - Isaac's - Lancaster, PA); a favorite of K back in the day. (Both ladies had ties to this area in years past which made it a great location to be) I had soup and sandwich and that were  absolutely delicious.  It passed muster with K as well for still being top notch. The whirlwind day continued at the Turkey Hill Experience. Now, if like me, you wonder how much you can learn about a gas station-- you'll be surprised to find out that their business is ice cream!  So we learned how the whole process works. For an ice cream fan such as myself, it was really nice to see. We also managed to sample 7 of the 10 flavors of the day.  One person had 4 of the 7 but I refuse to name the soul. I leave as an exercise for the reader to determine. 
Finally, one more trip to eat in the evening at a local bar-style restaurant; Hops Fogelsville. The food was fabulous as was the menu. Wish this place was open at home! With a tremendously full belly I managed to get to a happy, happy sleep.","MM 1261

Set up the tent at a stealth site tonight.  That's an unofficial location where previous hikers have set up camp. Usually rough. No facilities. You have to plan water accordingly. This site had water way down, as in a half mile. Fortunately, some trail Angels had left a water cache at a road crossing about  4 miles back so I had enough water for the night plus a half liter to start the next day. The seasonal, meaning they may or may not have water, are all getting pretty dry. It hasn't rained in quite awhile and there was almost snow this past winter. So the snow melt that usually charges these small aquifers did not happen. No snow, no rain, no water leads to unhappy hikers. If the trail angels were not stocking water caches, this hike would be twice as difficult. Thank you so much Angels!!!So todays hike started with the famous climb out of the Lehigh Valley often touted as the hardest climb outside the White Mountains. So what is it like?  Well, it's about a mile of ""trail"" with close to a thousand feet of vertical - so about a 20% incline.  But much of that vertical comes in a climb that requires the use of both hands a feet. Literally climbing not walking. The rock face is exposed so you have a great view of where you would fall if things didn't go well.  But having said all that, it is very doable. I found only three locations where I had to be very careful and did not have really easy hand and foot holds. I was super glad to be going NOBO because the SOBO folks would have to look down as they traversed the mountain. Something I do not like to do. No fear of heights-just a fear of bad landings! The climb also had significant rock hopping sections much like the rest of PA.  The only difference was these went up not horizontal. If a hiker did not feel up to this task going either direction there is a Blue Blaze bypass available. Since I didn't take it, I'm not sure what it was like. But rumor is that it isn't easy either - just not so exposed.  Upon reaching the top, your reward is a 5 mile hike across a Super Fund site. I heard it was because of an old zinc mine but I didn't do any research myself. Anyway, for a hiker, the important thing is that things are starting to grow again but nothing is very tall. So there is little to no shade and absolutely no water and it was a very sunny day.  So it was quite hot. I found a pair of pine trees that gave a pretty good patch of shade about half way across and took a 30 minute nap. That cooled me down enough to continue. 
At 4:00 I was 7.4 miles from the shelter I was trying for and realized I might not make it. So I pressed moderately hard for one hour and found I had covered about 2.2 miles. That meant I had at least two more hours of hiking if the rocks didn't get worse which was quite possible. That would have meant arriving at the shelter and doing set up in evening's fading light. I didn't care a lot for that option and continued on looking for a good tent site.  I ended up there about 6:00. In the end, I was a little disappointed in not getting to the shelter but felt comfortable with my decision to stop short. A thru hike is a continuous balancing act - the most dangerous thing you can do is stick to a plan just for the sake of the plan.","MM 1261

Well, yesterday's decision to stop early was a good one - the rocks did, indeed, get worse. My least favorite kind. Not too big but all sharp. Very close together so that every step has to be a separate decision.  Easy to trip - I did - fell three times. I only count a fall when my butt touches the ground. I now have 7 total. First two of no real consequence; nothing hurt. The last caused me to wrench my back a little bit because I went sideways as well as down. The long and short of it was if I had pushed on last night it probably would have been much worse. So I had another short day as the back slowed me way down. Two good things happened though. Another cool hiker caught up with me. Her name is Scorch and she is a bunch of fun. We collectively decided that staying in Wind Gap was the best option for the night. We pitched our tents in the grass in front of the Gateway Motel. Essentially a free hostel run by a kind gentleman named Satish.  We had access to drinking water, a bathroom with shower and a place to sleep. You really can't ask for more!  He does this for hikers for free - the generosity on the trail is remarkable. Thank you Trail Angel Satish!Turns out that both Scorch and I share a love for ice cream so we hoofed it 1.2 miles into Wind Gap to Sweet Nanny's Candies and Ice Cream Shop. These miles don't count anywhere except the wear and tear on feet. I had an old fashioned banana split and Scorch  went for straight ice cream and some candy for her pack. It was all delicious and well worth the walk!  So we headed back uphill to the motel and stuck our thumbs out. Two young guys picked us up and took us back. That was fabulous because I was stuffed. 
All in all a good day. Delaware Water Gap and the end to PA was 16 miles away and reachable tomorrow.","MM 1270

Another dang short day.  I'm getting a bit frustrated. Why? Fall number 8 and PA finally drew blood!  Simply a trip and face plant but this time I was unable to dodge all the rocks. Left knee hit something on the way down and took out a chunk. Not serious and not painful but really ugly. Lots of blood running down the leg.  I planned on cleaning it up when I got to the shelter later and had access to plenty of water.  More on that in a minute. So we stopped for a little break just down the trail. As we were sitting and talking, I saw a bear run across the trail just over Scorch's shoulder about 100 feet back down the trail. It wasn't very big so I judged it to be a yearling. About 30 seconds later, a second much larger bear followed. The first took no interest but the second must have heard us talking. She (pretty sure it was the mother convincing her baby it's time to move out of the house) stopped and gave us a pretty good look over. But eventually decided to amble slowly on. - we weren't worth the trouble I guess. We got up and started moving on. There is a parking lot at the PA 191 road crossing.  A Trail Angel (Slowey Pokey, I think. I’m sorry I’m so bad with names) was there. I had a coke, an iced Frappuccino and an orange. Delicious and refreshing!  I wish I could put into words for you what it means to have these selfless people do things for us. Wow!!!  Just the kind of boost I needed right then. Also, to my great surprise she knew who I was from this journal which she had been following. Truly unbelievable. I was taken aback by this revelation. I thought I was writing this for a few friends and family. Turns out I have many more trail friends that I haven’t met yet.  Thanks to you all!While sitting and absorbing this trail magic, an ATC Ridge Runner came into the parking lot. Her name was WIC for Women In Construction. These people run back and forth up and down the trail doing things to keep hikers safe and the Trail in shape. Most often an invisible and unfortunately thankless job. Well, she saw my leg and offered to clean and dress it for me. Since we were only s half mile from the shelter, I declined her offer. Three times I think. She was very kind and persistent. So time to get back on the trail and get water at the shelter. We did this and as we got back from the water source who do you think we saw coming up the trail?  Yep - WIC.  Now I had time to look at the wound and it was more than the trail rash I thought. So I accepted her fourth offer. It took a liter of water, a dozen wipes and tweezers to get it cleaned up. Then a very nifty tape job - l knees are so hard to bandage - and I was good to go. Many thanks to WIC for her persistence and skill!!!
Have you noticed how many people it takes to get a thru hiker to the end?  This is not a solo sport. It takes a team made of many people you haven’t even met!Scorch and I left the shelter for s short 0.3 mile hike to s tent spot with a great view of sunset and sunrise.  A pleasant way to spend the last night in PA. We thought. About 2:00 am we were awoke by a noise/call that I had never heard before. I can’t really describe it but it was big, loud and about 15 feet from our tents. Whatever it was, to me it sounded pissed off. After a good ten minutes of laying there trying to figure out what it was and what to do, I turned my light on in the tent. It got quiet and apparently went away. Good, I thought. Time to go back to sleep which I did. Not too much keeps me awake. Even a wife in labor - long time ago - but still remembered by said wife. 
Next morning I did a walk around camp and saw a large bed in the grass, much larger than a deer makes. Something had tried to pull down our food bags that were hung in a tree (PCT method - topic for another day).  Had we been visited by a bear. Can’t say for sure but all the pieces fit. Anyway, no harm no foul. It was a beautiful sunset BTW!Here’s a link to a YouTube video on black bear sounds.

Many things today. First and most important, the Pennsylvania rocks are behind me!  Physically, PA was not very difficult but mentally it was horrible. The tripping hazard seemed to get worse each day. I felt like all I saw the last three days was my feet.  NJ will have rocks for about 30 miles I am told. Already half way through that. 
Next:  passed 1300 mile mark so 13 down 9 to go. That sounds fabulous. Finally: deli blazing has begun. Today I stopped at Mohican Center for lunch (ham, turkey and Swiss sandwich) and took a second on the trail for dinner. Rumor has it that you can eat at a deli type place every day while in NJ and NY. I am committed to testing that as yesterdays resupply was all breakfast. No guts, no glory. Made it to a large stealth site for the night. Something large walked through about 2:00 am but the consensus is that it was a deer. Knee is doing well.

It’s a good rule. The problem is that is nice to be walking on those nice trails so sometimes it takes a while to notice. So as in many days, there are miles walked that do not count into your AT total. Oh well….Final stop for the night was a state park pavilion and cowboy camping. There was sign that said “No Camping” but since I was only sleeping it seemed fine. If you aren’t familiar, cowboy camping is where you don’t pitch a tent, you just lay your sleeping set up on the ground directly. No rain the forecast and high enough to be away from the bugs. Good gentle breeze to also help with the bugs. Ahhh, sweet sleep!Today was a practice for the heat tomorrow. Stay tuned….","MM 1313

We need rain badly to replenish the water sources, but not all at once!  Pretty average day until about 4:00 pm when a monster thunderstorm dumped what seemed like a couple of inches of rain in 30 minutes. Not really sure how much there it was but it was a lot. Back up to about 3:30 and I’m  mile from the road crossing to Uniomville, NY. That’s my deli stop of the day and a free church hostel SOLA.  It’s early, I’m really hot and tired - why not stop for a break at the top of the last up for the day? All was well until the thunderstorm came over the hill. I was under a nice maple tree in the shade when the rain started. It took about 15 minutes before the tree quit protecting me from the rain.  Then rain jacket on and back on trail. It was raining so hard that the trail was completely full of water - over ankle deep. Pants soaked in less than minute. But there is some good news - you can only get so wet and then you’re soaked. From that point on, it doesn’t matter. How much it’s raining. That point was about one minute for me.  Sad part is that I could have been in town, dry, if I’d kept walking. See, not all my decisions work out. The SOLA hostel was really nice. It’s set up for only 4 and I was first one there. I had 3 more in my group still to come and they all made it.  When I arrived, the pastor, Bonzai - he was a hiker too - was getting to pour some self-leveling concrete next to the bathroom. I got to help and it was nice to help out some. Laundry and a good bed for the night - these are the good things. Good conversation over breakfast pancakes and coffee and off again. Going to the general store for a little resupply and hopefully a pair of reading glasses. Yes, pair number 6 is gone after only a few days. I can make do without them - barely. It’s just frustrating because they aren’t easy to find on the trail. 
Addendum:  no glasses, sigh…..

Shorter miles today. Basically, a NERO out of town instead of in like usual. Out of the hostel at 9:00 am and down to the General Store for breakfast sandwich. Had pancakes at the hostel too but hey needed some eggs and ham too. Three other hikers congregated on the front porch. There was no rain in the forecast but heavy clouds were passing overhead. It was really easy toSit on that porch, talk, go back in for more food, repeat. I was the one who broke first and set out for the Trail— at 11:25!  Hence the small number of miles. We all had a total lack of desire to set out and get rained on. I had to use my first Deet today. I went through a lot of low, swampy land via boardwalk. The mosquitoes were pretty fierce. They have been for a couple of days at water sources but they were almost everywhere today. So out comes the 100% Deet. My hiker buddy Lil Engine would chastise me if she knew.  She hates the stuff. Sorry LE! 
I am stealth camping behind a farm stand where I bought dinner tonight. Using the overflow parking area. Hopefully, law enforcement won’t come by and kick me out. Do I think they will? Nah, i have permission from one of the employees as long as I’m up by sunrise. 
Deli blazing was different today but I’m counting it because nothing need boiling water to eat!  Breakfast sandwich and fresh fruit and veggies for dinner. So far it’s working. Looking at a hotdog stand just off trail at 9 or so miles tomorrow. It was much cooler today and only felt a few raindrops. Down to 40 tonight which is cooler than average but I’ll be fine. I sleep warm. It’s been 12 weeks now since I set foot on the Trail. I wonder what the real world is going to feel like.

Crossed into NY today. Goodbye to NJ.  It was much better than I expected it to be. Very pretty sites to see and well groomed trail for the most part. Was getting rougher as we closed in on NY and NY started out tough today. Deli blazing was so - so. Got a fantastic banana split at Bellvale Farms for ""lunch"". The hot dog stand was closed on Monday which was a total bummer. I had plans for four....While there I saw a B-24 and B-29 flyby. Really rare and cool. Maybe an air show somewhere. I did manage to fall again - on perfectly smooth trail. No more harm but didn't help the back. There were two really difficult climbs left in the afternoon. One even had rebar cemented in the rock to form a makeshift ladder. I arrived at a water source and decided to call it a night and pitched my tent. I was very, very tired and still in some pain with the back. But I think it's getting better.
Oh and I forgot that I went almost a mile down the wrong trail. Backtrack and continue while being very unhappy with self!  Two more miles that don't count. Anyone who says hiking the AT is easy, fun, and all sweetness is lying or delusional. Some days are just hard!","MM 1370

Rain showers off and on all day made the rocks slick and treacherous. I slowed down in an effort to protect my back.

Fizzix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665152,"Day 88 15 mi MM 1412Today is a tale of two packs. I had a box waiting for me at the post office in Fort Montgomery, NY.  I was also going to need to go to a Walmart or such as I had several things to pick up - like my seventh pair of reading glasses. I keep losing or destroying them.  So I arranged for a shuttle to pick me up as my destinations were more than 8 miles apart. I was to meet Jon the Driver at 11:30 and the place was 12 miles from the shelter so I had to get up and get moving. At this point the first pack of the day weighed probably 18 pounds. Almost no food left (as planned) and 1 liter of water (I would pass a water supply on the way) made the pack very light. A light pack makes for a fast Fizzix so I easily made the rendezvous. We went to Walmart first and on the way back I discovered that we were driving through the US Military Academy aka West Point. So yesterdays bangs probably were some form of artillery. Now comes pack number 2 -- weighing closer to 30 pounds full of food and water for the climb out of the Hudson River valley. Yuk. I really wish food and water could weigh less. The heavy pack, the Canadian smoke and the steep climb meant 3 miles in 2.5 hours. Very slow but I got to camp for the night. I had a few coughs through the night from the smoke but I really didn't have big problems. I just hope it's better tomorrow. Oh, and the back -- felt pretty good even with the heavy pack. I think it's on the mend. I've been super careful not to jerk it and that seems to be working. There was a lot of history in this area. One day I hope to get back. WITH A CAR!!!!","MM 1397

A long hard day of 11 hours of hiking (including breaks) to get those 17 miles. Was really wanting to get to a shelter at 19 but it was approaching 6:00 and I was pretty tired with the heavy pack. So I found a spot just big enough for my tent and set up camp. Deli Blazing update: I got breakfast at the Appalachian Market and Deli. The Trail goes right by its door. It was amazing how much they packed into a small space. I had a big bowl of fruit and the ""heart attack"" sandwich. It was on a 12 inch hoagie bun. Here's what I think was on it: 2 eggs, hash browns, ham, bacon, sausage and cheese. Not sure how they came up with the name. It was delicious though!  I ate half and packed out the other half for lunch. Smoke was much better today -- hardly noticeable. The sun was back to the correct color. Looked like rain at various times but never got any. Felt cool; not sure what the temperature was. Water sources were better today than they have been in a month. Hope that trend continues. One was the outflow from a beaver pond. Love those little engineers.

So yesterday’s mileage was 12 at MM 1441.
This can only mean the best answer to the game was:  C
That is what I did and what 4 out 5 thru hikers did as well. There were 5 of us altogether. Not a single one selected option A — the call of the food was just too strong!  One of the five had the internal fortitude to get back on trail and continue. The rest of us ate twice and hiked out about 8:00. Congregations to all you winners and there are no losers!So for today, the only thing to report is that my last water source was Nuclear Lake. Apparently this was the site of a plutonium spill in 1972.  The water looked fine and there was plenty of wildlife. The frogs had four eyes but who couldn't use an extra pair of eyes?  If the water is still radioactive, I am hoping I'll wake up with a new Super Power -- the ability to walk 3 mph over any terrain without falling down.

I think CT is less than 50 miles so it should go quickly. Second, I passed the 2/3 mark today at 1465.6.  It wasn’t marked, sadly. I think thirds should get the same recognition as quarters but apparently their PR department isn’t as good. The hiking in the last third of NY and so far in CT was much better. It feels like I am back on a hiking trail not a rocky jungle gym. I get that the rocks are part of the Trail but it’s really nice to be hiking again. Let’s hope it continues. 
The air seems much better although I still smell smoke from time to time. When I look back on the last few days, I think the smoke was having more impact than I thought. Miles were down; sleep wasn’t as good; and fatigue was much higher. Water sources were a little bit better today as well. I really, really hope that continues. One water source was Native Landscapes Garden Center near Wingdale, NY. They have a spigot available to hikers and an outdoor shower!!! Yes - Really!!! It was a magnificent experience even though an hour later I was all sweaty again. After my shower, I sat in a chair for a half hour just enjoying the feeling of being clean.  Once again, Trail Angels are everywhere and  so deeply appreciated. Thanks Native Landscapes. Since I’m in CT and the grandkids are in CT, I’m taking a couple of “rest” days off trail starting tomorrow. I’ll be back with you later in the week. Be Safe.

NERO day but back on the Trail after 3 days with grandkids. Had a lot of fun and gave the back some time to rest. Seems ok today-fingers crossed. Camped out on the Housatonic River. It is surprisingly nice. For some reason I thought it was going to be one of those wide, slow & kinda boring rivers. But it actually has some rapids and of course, some big rocks. So it's making that nice noise that I like to sleep with. I went in to Kent this afternoon for an early dinner. The town kinda smells like money. Looks like a great little town to wander about and window shop but real shopping probably blows a hole in your wallet. The first restaurant I stopped in wanted me to leave my pack outside so I went elsewhere. I know it probably smells and they don't want that inside. But if the pack were to grow legs and walk off, my hike would be over. Not so much because of the cost but the time. Many of the items I have are custom made and would take weeks to replace. The only alternative would be to go to Amazon and try to find Chinese knockoffs.  But I hate that thought.  So I keep my pack with me and move along. 
It was a quiet day on the Trail- only saw a few day hikers. It's definitely going to rain tomorrow which we need but it's not fun to hike in. I'm planning on a 16 mile or so day if it holds off.  Could be shorter if the rain comes early. I'll just have to wait and see. I'm gonna pray that the rain starts after 7 pm and can go all night if it wants. But it's not really my decision, is it?

In 1492 Columbus sailed the ocean blue…Sorry, how often will I get to do that. So another short day. I got going a little late this morning. I sat down at the shelter at about 3:00 and pulled out my phone to see the latest on the rain situation. And a raindrop fell on it!  That question answered I shoved all my stuff in the shelter and watched it rain for two hours. At that point I wasn’t going to set out on a wet trail just to make another 3 or 4 miles. Maybe I’ll make it up tomorrow - or maybe not. It’s not a race.  Plus I think it is going to rain all day tomorrow.  Saw bear number 8 today. I stopped at a really nice official campsite for second breakfast and heard a hiker coming up the hill. Now I'm sitting in a nice pavilion sort of behind a low wall and a bear goes ripping through camp. I don't think it even saw me. He was moving along.

A more reasonable day today in terms of miles. I’ve stopped in Salisbury, CT for the night at a hostel. Shelters ahead are closed for a complete rebuild so this was the best choice. There has been almost no spots to stealth camp due to the ruggedness of the terrain. But in defense of CT, they have built some really nice official campsites. I passed one that had a pavilion and swinging chairs in addition to the usual privy. All of the sites have had bear boxes as well. I like these much better than bear hangs because they are faster and easier. Also, bears are starting to figure out  the best hangs and occasionally get food bags. The boxes seem more effective. Managed to eat town food twice today!  Had a good second breakfast in Falls Village after 6 miles and then good pasta here in Salisbury this evening. That counts for a good day in my book. The miles are getting a little tougher again. Both of the past two days had nearly 4000 feet of ascent. Nothing over 500 feet each but lots of small ups and downs (150-400).  There were a few more miles of river walk along the Housatonic which are very pleasant.  I don’t even want to talk about tomorrow yet. If I survive, I’ll describe it. There seems to be a pattern developing where the Trail gets ridiculous as you leave a state. I’ll be leaving CT tomorrow.

Well, I made it. I’m now in MA. The last mountain in CT was Bear Mountain - yes, another one. It was a 2300 foot top from about a 600 foot base which made it one of the highest climbs since VA. But it was over almost 4 miles so it wasn’t all that steep or hard going up. Down?  A completely different story. There was over a 500 foot drop on 0.4 miles which works out to a 25% grade. Imagine walking down a step ladder for almost half a mile. Of course, that’s the average. Sometimes it was only 18% and at others it was vertical - hands and feet - put away the poles. Steep, rocky downs are my kryptonite so I went very slow. I spent 40 minutes on that section.   Then came a normal steep, rocky down where I could relax. NOT!  But somewhere over the next mile I left CT and hit MA. The first mountain, Mount Everette, was just the inverse of Bear Mountain. It was a steep climb and a long nice down. I think the up was about 850 feet per mile which is what a lot of the southern mountains were like. Since falling uphill isn’t really all that dangerous, I definitely prefer those mountains. 
At the bottom I took a one mile side trip to Moms Country Cafe for a late lunch burger. And, of course, a Fizzy coke. It was worth the extra distance. Since it was a road walk, it was flat and easy. On the way back to the Trail a Trail Angel picked me up and saved some wear and tear on the old body. Speaking of which, the back seems back to normal. Knees and feet are talking to me a bit so it’s time for new shoes. I ordered them from Amazon and am trying to have them delivered to the PO in Dalton. People have had varying success with that so keep those fingers crossed. I really don’t want to go too long this way. I got just over 600 miles on the first pair and almost 500 on these. But those miles included Rocksylvania which were much harder on them. BTW, I wear Altra Lone Peaks in case you’re interested. I set my tent up fast this evening and climbed in.

Yes, yes I know - the math doesn’t work out. But trust me, I walked 14 miles. The Far Out app has a problem with continuity between maps. It would take too long to explain. So just trust me. Now to the good part. I met a hiker back in VA named Sneak Attack. She was doing a section hike and was headed back to MA where she lives. She gave me her number and told me to call her when I was getting to Great Barrington.  I have to admit that at the time MA seemed like another planet and I wasn’t real sure I’d get there.  But I did so I called. She has a property just 900’ off the AT and she does Trail Magic there. The site has some history. Google “Great Barrington tornado “ and you’ll get a better description than I’ll give. But here goes. In 1995 a tornado came through the area and hit a boys school. Three people were killed and the school was destroyed. On the site, a small chapel was built in their honor. Sneak Attack is an avid and accomplished hiker and purchased the property a couple of years ago with the intent of helping AT hikers. I got to sleep in the chapel!She came up in the early afternoon and brought snacks and of course, Cokes for Fizzix.  We talked for several hours - she gave me tons of info about parts of the hike I will be facing. It was really helpful. She drove me in to Great Barrington to her favorite dinner location and then showed me a bit of the town. The place was interesting and deserves some follow later to take it in some more. 
I had a very pleasant and restful sleep on the chapel and a really great day. Many, many thanks to Sneak Attack!

A long, long day. I'm staying at Upper Goose Pond Cabin tonight. It's staffed by a couples of volunteers from the AMC (Appalachian Mountain Club). It's a pretty location but it's a half mile off the Trail (therefore not included in the 20!) which always makes it a tough decision. But the important point is -- they serve pancakes for breakfast! So I pushed a long day and got in right at 7:00. Still plenty of daylight but a twelve hour day nonetheless. When I arrived, several hikers were gathered around the picnic table as I walked by to drop my pack and get some water. I heard ""Fizzix"" called out and looked at the source. Unbelievably, it was from a couple of hikers I had not seen in 60 days!  They are a married couple from Texas - possibly the rarest form of hiker on the Trail. The married part, not Texas. Their first day was the day I started Shenandoah. At that time, they didn't even have trail names. Now it's Plain View and Miso. It was remarkable to see them after so long a time.

So off I go down the Trail. About 3 miles down, I grabbed my phone to check the map. reached for my glasses and did not find them. Crap!  Did I leave them at the cabin?  Probably but I had to completely unpack my pack to be sure.
No joy!
So I stashed my pack and poles away off the trail so I didn't have to carry them. Back 3 miles to the cabin. Passed 2 hikers who left after me who both verified they were there. No one knew who they belonged to. Sure enough, they were on the table waiting for me. Pick them up and restart. Remember the complaint about the cabin being a half mile off trail?  I now have done in 4 times!  Annoying to say the least. I had planned on going to a shelter 17 miles away but this little adventure changed that plan.

The day started with a 2.5 mile hike to the Cookie Lady. A Trail Angel who allows tenting around her home on a blueberry farm. She provides WiFi, outlets for charging, water, a privy and, of course, fresh baked cookies. I charged my phone, took a liter of water and had three chocolate chip cookies for breakfast. I know sitting wherever you are as you read this, it may seem strange for me to think this is a big deal. But I can assure you, there were many happy faces at that place and there will be many more. This simple generosity brings joy to my heart and I am sure to many other. In many ways, hiking the AT is like wandering in the desert - a tough, arduous task. It's easy to get a little down from the sheer effort required some days. And then you come across these oases provided simply from compassion for fellow humans. The Angels have never seen us before and will never see most of us again. Yet through love I presume, they give freely. Is there a better message? 
Thank you Cookie Lady!!!Well, on from there to Dalton, MA where I hope and pray that my new shoes will be. I got into town about 12:30 and went straight to the PO. Guess what? They actually were there. I was simply ecstatic. I really needed these shoes and was afraid it was going to be a problem. My knees and feet have been hurting for a couple of weeks. I think because the cushion was gone. I know I have been slipping on rocks because the tread was largely gone. But it comes on so gradually that it is easy to not notice. I'll let you know over the next few days if the pains go away. Remind me if I forget. ;-)
I ran into another hiker in town called Mr. Friendly and let me tell you he is aptly named. Very kind and considerate to all whom he meets. A real gentleman who literally is half my age. Anyway, we were sitting in front Angelina's Sun Shop and Juice & Java Coffee House and partaking liberally from both. Again, great people. We were able to charge our phones and get our water bottles filled when we left. Which by the way was ad 4:15 for me. Mr. Friendly stayed on. What a pleasant way to spend an afternoon. But duty calls - in the form of the Hike. I still had an 800' climb and almost 6 miles to do. So off I went. I managed to get to camp at 6:05 - 40 minutes faster than I expected. The new shoes I'm telling you. The Trail gives and the Trail takes. Yesterday was a stressed out mess and today was a simple reminder of how good it is to be out here. Oh, I almost forgot to mention the bears. Last night about midnight, two bears were working their way up the mountain towards the campsite. You could hear them coming quite a way off as they were turning over rocks looking for insects. Another hiker, Redline, started huffing at them but they didn't pay much attention. We both shined lights-that didn't do much either.

Today was Mt. Greylock, the highest mountain in Massachusetts at 3489'. Also, the biggest climb we've had to do since probably southern Virginia at 2200'. Good prep for what's coming in VT and NH.
Remember the discussion about leaving a state and how they all seem to be unusually difficult?  I was expecting this today since this is also the last mountain in MA. I was pleasantly surprised. It was a big climb but the gradient and route selection was just normal. That made it a much easier climb. The big deal of the day was the weather. Apparently there is a big slow moving system off the coast somewhere and rain was forecast to begin at 4:00 pm. And it's supposed to stay around for 3 or 4 days. Real bummer! So my goal was to get to the top where I had reserved a bunk before the rain started. I made it at about 4:15 and looking back down you could, indeed, see some nasty clouds on the way. Winds picked up; clouds moved in; and it started to rain about 5:00. But I was high and dry at the lodge. I even had a shower by then - first in several days. You do not want to know what that water looked like! We had 3 thru hikers and a Brit who was trail/road motorcycling the area. They put us all together for a really nice dinner. The lodge offered three choices and I selected the double thick pork chop with cranberry chutney.  It was delicious and I could have eaten another but I was good and didn't. All in all a pretty good day!","MM 1578

Rain Day!It rained most of the night as I slept soundly in my bunk. Breakfast was not going to be served until 8:00 am which was too late for all the hikers. We all had day old coffee and muffins and prepped to leave. About 7:00 I put on my pack and headed to the door. The drizzle turned into a downpour-I kid you not. You can only get so wet so out I went anyway. I knew from experience that I would be pretty soaked in an hour and just have to hike wet all day. Exactly what I did. The trail was a running creek in a lot of places.  Best thing to do is just walk right in and get it over with!  I did. So by 7:10 my shoes and socks were as wet as they could get. Nothing to worry about now. After a couple of hours, the hard rain backed off to a steady, gentle, soaking kind of rain. Really needed to get the water sources full again but not all that much fun to hike in.  But here's the deal, you simply cannot hike the AT without getting wet. It is by far the wettest of three long US hikes. It rains a lot. This has been an unusual year as I've been in a half dozen or so rain days and none that were multiple days. So it's time to pay the piper, I guess. I can tell by the look on some of your faces that you are puzzled at why my feet got wet. I mean wasn't I wearing waterproof boots?  … Warning: the following discussion is what works for me. …No, I wasn't. I have hiked in ""waterproof"" Gortex boots before. Guess what? They aren't. Sure, if you go out for a few hours and it rains and you don't have to wade across anything deeper than the top of the boot, you'll probably get home with dry feet. But trust me, given time, everything wets out even Gortex boots. And once they are wet, it can take days for them to dry out. So I just stick with trail runners that give no protection at all from rain but will dry out the next day. In case you are interested, I wear Altra Lone Peaks. …Now that's MY opinion on the boot issue. But I have not seen a single thru hiker in waterproof boots this year. Just saying....
It stopped raining about 4:30 and I got to my camp spot at 5:00. So I was able to set up without dealing with the rain. Very nice bonus!  I can, if necessary, set up my tent in the rain and get very little water in it. But it takes a lot of practice to get to that point. It's about 8:00 now and the rain hasn't restarted yet. So maybe I'll get lucky again. I'll let you know tomorrow.
Oh, I'm in Vermont so another state down. And I passed MM 1600 today. 16 behind me and 6 in front!

If you want to have some real fun and feel like thru hiker-do this. Get the clothes out you are going to wear tomorrow and take them to a sink. Half fill the sink with cold water. Now the fun part-gently hold your clothes underwater until the are fully soaked. Take them out and wring as much water out as possible and then put them on the back porch. Now go get a good nights sleep knowing what awaits you in the morning. You've still got it easy because the clothes are wet with clean water not a mix of mud, sweat and rainwater. Now you have a feel for how my day started. Sure, it wasn't raining but I was soaked before I got out of the tent. That put me in a somewhat grumpy mood. But I could only be grumpy with myself and I was. It got worse as the morning went along because hiking conditions weren't all that great. The trail still had running water in places just not ankle deep like yesterday. Lots of mud - Vermont is famous for its mud even on days when it hasn't rained. And the worst thing was that the trail was not trimmed back at all. So lots of wet leaves hitting you as well. That's pretty normal but the stuff is usually knee high or so. I was constantly getting hit on the face. I had to push branches back just to see the trail. I ran into a SOBO hiker who confirmed that this was the normal state for Vermont. This did not improve my grumpiness at all. I was tired all morning. I must not have slept well or something. Hiking was slow.  At 12:30 or so i arrived at a shelter 7 miles from my start.  I made lunch; got some water; and decided to take a break for 30 minutes. Shortly afterwards, a father -daughter team came in and we talked awhile. Meantime, the clouds got heavier and heavier and thunder could be heard in the distance. The rain started again just like yesterday so I decided to stay the night. I don't like the short day but I should still make my resupply point on Tuesday. Oh, and fall number 10 came today. Ground just broke apart and went sideways due to the water content.  Nothing seemed hurt at the time. Hopefully, the back did not get jerked too much. We'll know tomorrow!BTW, since I'm not wet tonight I'm not as grumpy as I was this morning. Clothes will still be wet in the morning though...","MM 1604

As I am writing this, it is raining. Had a good morning without rain. Then two and half hours starting about 1:00. Dry until now - 6:45. But I made it to the shelter around 4:30 so all my chores are done and I'm in bed for the night. So the rain on the metal roof is kinda nice. The thunder isn't but I haven't actually seen any lightning all day. It must be somewhere else. Thunder in the mountains is really different. It seems to rumble on and on. I expect it has to do with some interaction with the valleys and reflections. Nothing significant happened today. I'm still wet. Hands and feet have turned white and wrinkled from being wet so long. I cleaned up as best I can with wipes and then got as dry as possible with a camp towel. That means damp dry. I'd like to hang my feet out in the air for a while but the rain dropped the temperature. So I'm under my quilt. 
Forecast is for rain all day tomorrow. Oh, joy. Hopefully it will be like today and not be all day.  Hiking wet just stinks. There's no way around it. On the AT you can't really get dry either. It's just too humid and no direct sunlight. You have to go to town where they have those fancy clothes driers. Miracles!

Dry at last!I’m staying in a hostel tonight “Wicked Waystation” that just opened June first. It’s an old farmhouse and has a huge amount of comfortable common space and a full kitchen. There’s a small country store 0.3 miles down the road to get food so it’s very convenient as well. I washed and dried all my clothes and so they, like me, are clean and dry for the first time since Saturday at 7:00 am. You have no idea how good that feels. Unless you tried yesterday’s experiment. Show of hands - how many put on cold, wet clothes this morning?  Yeah, that’s what I thought. I did say all my clothes, didn’t I?  Anybody wonder what I was wearing during that process?  Or are you afraid to even think about it?  Well, most hostels offer “loaner clothes” for just that purpose. Something to wear after your shower and while your clothes are being laundered. I generally try for the gaudiest combo possible. Your choices are limited by what will fit though. This time I have cardinal red shorts and a deep maroon tee shirt topped off with a canary yellow fleece because I was cold just sitting around. Not my best effort- it really doesn’t look all that bad. Course I make everything look good.  Ahem….
Today’s trail summary…I know you will never guess it, but it rained today. Had an overcast but dry morning and was forecast for rain to start about 4:00.  So I pushed it a bit and got to a shelter at 1:00 that was the last place with cell service to call the hostel and arrange for a pickup. I managed to get through and set a pickup time for 3:15. Thought I could make it by 3:00; I hate to be late so I add some time so the driver has some cushion. It was a 3.6 mile almost all downhill trek. Time to scarf down some lunch. As this was the last day before a resupply, it was a bunch of leftovers. One stick of cheese, 3 peanut butter tortillas (the really small ones), some granola, and a Snickers bar. Actually wasn’t all that bad. At 1:20 I set off to make my rendezvous.  It was looking like I might stay dry today. At 1:25 it started to rain a nice steady one. It got stronger as I went further. Finally, about 2:30 I decided I needed to put my rain jacket on. Not to stay dry - that ship already sailed - but to stay warm if I had to stand and wait for my ride. I got to the parking lot at 2:50 and my ride showed up at 3:00. She said she knew we all gave a cushion but since it was wet she was trying to beat me there. “A” for effort. It was a great thought. I fell three times today, numbers 11,12 and 13.  I’m okay. 11 and 13 were minor slips caused by the wet ground giving way under my weight. All they managed to accomplish was to drop me into pools of water. Ha! Fooled them!  I was already completely soaked. One of my trail truisms: You can only get so wet. 
Number 12 was a different story. First time since PA that I thought I might have done some damage. Was going for a longish rock hop and it wasn’t completely secured and rolled when I landed on it. Down I went on my complete right side; this time into the rocks. Hit pretty hard from the ankle up to the shoulder but the hip took most of the blow. It landed on a nice round rock about the size of a basketball. Pretty sharp pain at the moment of impact so I gotta say, I was worried for a minute. But nothing seemed damaged so I went off again. I am expecting a very large bruise tomorrow. I passed 4 separate beaver ponds today. Northern MA and VT sure seem to have a lot of beavers. I really like them - natural engineers!  
The trail maintenance was not quite as bad as the past two days. The mud was just as bad maybe even worse. Vermont is shaping up to be my least favorite state although it is really beautiful… When you are upright and can afford to take your eyes off the trail!I have WiFi tonight so I was able to send some photos and a video. Check out the last few days for the added photos. The video is attached to yesterday’s post.","MM 1625

Zero Day. I was alone in the hostel today. Walked down to the grocery store and got food for the day and then ate it. Tough day, huh?I did order a couple of things that I needed. Some gear is just plain old wearing out and needs to be replaced. Did some planning for the next couple of good drops. And started to look ahead into NH. Options really are getting slim. The Trail is a long way from towns in some cases 20 miles.  I’ll have to be very particular about where I get off to resupply. I also think I’m going to have to carry more days of food just when I had hoped to carry less. I expected to be slowing down due to the terrain being tougher. Add onto that more weight and even slower I’ll go. Hopefully, all this rain will have replenished the secondary water sources and I will be able to carry less. That would be a good trade off. One liter of water is just about equal to a day’s worth of food. I’ll try to fill only my 700 ml bottle at a source and then camel up (drink what I can hold - usually  another 700 ml) to get to the next source. If they come every five miles or so that will work. Temps are going up though at the same time which means more water. See how this gets complicated?  The good news is you just change your plan as needed and keep moving forward. 
I’ve decided to switch packs back to my heavier Granite Gear. I feel like my loads are going to be over 30 pounds a lot and it handles the heavier weight much better. It’s only a pound heavier so not a disaster. But since “a pint is a pound the world around” it’s another pint of water to displace. Of course, I could just suck it up and carry a 40 pound pack and quit whining. Naw, I think I’ll keep whining and try to stay light. I do feel rested. I hope that translates into a good day tomorrow. I hope even more for nothing more than a few showers. That looks inevitable for the next week. I was dry today at least.","MM 1638

High Mile DayWith all that rest and food from the zero day, I apparently was ready to crank out some miles.  I managed one of the mythical and magical (at least for me) twenty mile days. The reality was that about half the miles today were also cross country ski trails so they were pretty flat and much better groomed. Also - No Rain!  All that made for a somewhat easy day. There were lots of large creeks today that were very nice to see. Water not falling from the sky can be quite beautiful. I have officially switched from drought mode to normal AT mode where water sources are plentiful. I'm only filling my small bottle to carry.  There seems to me a water source every mile at this point. So not having to carry water is also a big plus. In the morning once I am on the Trail and alone, I try to spend a few minutes in prayer. It's pretty simple and somewhat repetitive - I hope God doesn't get bored easily. I usually ask for protection and guidance and then express my thanks for being able to do this. This morning when I opened my eyes I saw that I was standing in a place so beautiful that it literally brought tears to my eyes. The forest was stunningly bright, green and vibrant. I wish you all could have seen it the way I did. It was almost like I'd never seen it before. It would be so easy to take for granted. I hope I never do.","MM 1638

Or Day Eleventy-one in Hobbit. A slightly short day today for a couple of reasons. I was headed to a shelter at 15 miles that sits right on a flowing river. It would be a beautiful place to set my tent. I love camping next to moving water. But then I read through the comments and found one that said this site was very popular on weekends because it was only a mile from the road. I've had some bad nights in this situation so I decided to stop one shelter short. This one also has a good sized creek beside it and it's making that wonderful noise. Not a bad compromise. My second reason for going short was that my left knee was giving me a niggle. That's what I call those little messages a body part sends you that aren't really pain but demand you pay attention.  Fall #14 came yesterday on a boardwalk. Those things are incredibly slick when wet and they all are right now. Anyway, I just took a slightly too long step with my left leg and it skidded down the board. I fell off to the right into a mossy section. No harm from the fall but I might have stretched that knee a bit too far. So, a niggle. I listened and moved a bit slower and stopped a little sooner. 
Tonight at the shelter, I was talking with a couple who is SOBO (southbound). They started at Katahdin but skipped down to Vermont because high water has made many of the crossings in Maine impassable. Many of the NOBO hikers are stuck in place and unable to continue. I sure hope the waters subside soon for them and for me. If you have the time and the inclination, a little prayer for them would be nice. Thanks to all of you out there who are supporting me in this adventure.","MM 1648

I talked with them for almost an hour. They were very generous and gracious giving me brownies and fresh coffee. They had lots of questions about how I managed things on the hike. One was video logging back to Turkey. Maybe I’m famous there now - naw, I don’t think so. Not a whole lot to share except some pictures. It was a pretty routine day.

Aaaarrrrgggh DayFirst, let's talk about last night. At 2:20 I woke up to the sound of an animal inside the shelter. I listened for a few seconds and decided it wasn't mice and it probably wasn't a bear. So I sat up and it was my arch nemesis Rocky Raccoon. I told him to leave a couple of times in increasing volume and anger. He totally ignored me. I got up and he moved to the steps but didn't leave. I went back and got my hiking pole. Hit him twice and he remained unconvinced. Finally, I poked him with the sharp end and he decided to leave. He hadn't done any damage yet just made a mess. Forget bears - the dang raccoons are the problem. Everybody back to bed and to sleep. Rain began at 3:30 and continued on until about 2:00 pm. Not real heavy but very steady.
So the trail was pretty slick again in the morning. And you know what I did - that's right. Fall #14.  And before you say it out loud - I am careful!  I was coming down a pretty steep hill into Clarendon Gorge (which was beautiful) and I came to a place where I had to cross a big, sloping rock maybe 15 by 20 feet. No way around it except to jump over the cliff. I came to a complete stop and actually said out loud ""this is a bad one."" Yes, I talk to myself occasionally especially about problems. There was a diagonal crack running through it that I thought I could use. Made it about half way before there wasn't enough grip and out goes my foot and down goes me. Fell mostly on my butt but gave the back a little jerk so it's talking to me a bit tonight. It hurt for awhile but I don't think any damage was done. Hike on!The hike today also involved two water crossings of about 40 feet each. The ""rock hopping"" patches were underwater so the best thing to do was just walk right in. Water was only a foot deep or so but really cold. Felt good. But you spend all day trying to keep your feet dry and then have to walk through a river. Go figure!The attached photo shows what the day looked like.
So why the short day?  Well the rain and the fall were factors. But the real reason was the next shelter that I was originally aiming for at 15 miles had a leaky roof. I don't want to hike in the rain all day just to get to a shelter that leaks all night. So I stopped short one shelter. Should still easily make Killington tomorrow and the Inn.

No Rain, No FallsCan there be a connection? Maybe. I thought about this a lot last night after getting to my destination - Inn at Long Trail. Not all of my 14 falls have come while it was raining, most of the last six have. I don’t think there is a real physical reason for this because after a good rain, the Trail remains wet and muddy for days. So that makes it mental. I do think the rain is incredibly distracting. Even after you are soaked, you still don’t want to get wetter - crazy as that sounds. Of course, this is me that’s talking. It might not apply to everyone else. For instance, I keep my hiking poles just a little longer than is “correct” because I rely on them more going downhill. That makes my forearm slope backward towards my elbow. The rain slowly seeps past my wrist and pools at the elbow. Then comes the time I reach up and suddenly a quarter cup or so of cold water runs down my arm and my back. It’s always a shock. It’s often a little misty while it’s raining too. With my tired old eyes I think I miss the details on a rock at times. If you have a good rough surface, the rocks are the best wet surface to use. But if it has been polished by thousand and thousands of feet over the years and you hit it wrong - Fall!It had been calculated that it takes 2.2 million steps to complete the AT. And only one bad one to end it. That happened to me last year and I’m trying hard not to do it again. Last night at the bar(the Inn has an Irish pub) o was talking to another hiker who had zeroed to do some planning. I see why. I have had “my head down” for a week trying to survive Vermont and didn’t realize how close I was to finishing it. At this point, I am less than 100 miles from hitting the White Mountains in NH. This is, by far, the toughest part of the AT. it is physically difficult but it is the remoteness that is worrisome. I’ve said before that the logistics of a thru hike are maybe the hardest part. The Whites have few hostels and towns close to the Trail, making resupplies difficult. Just at the point where I would love to lighten my pack for the climbs, I’m going to have to make it heavier. I’ll likely need to carry more days of food and I’ll have to add some cold weather gear back.  Can I carry the weight?  Absolutely!  But it’s in my head and 80% of doing a thru hike is in your head. So today I’m taking that same zero day to try to get some planning done. Also, great public bus line runs into Rutland so I’ll go in and kick around some in the afternoon. Oh, I almost forgot. Passed 1700 today. 17 down and 5 to go. Hike On!","MM 1695

Independence Day I'm staying at the Inn at Long Trail taking a zero. There's a free bus line that runs between Killington and Rutland so I decide to go into Rutland and see the sights; get a little food; you know be a tourist. As I'm getting off the bus, I ask the driver what he recommends for lunch. He looks at me funny and says, ""nothing is likely to be open today.""  Why, I ask. Because it's the Fourth of July!  Oh. He was right. I went to the grocery store and Walmart and got on the next bus back to the inn. Too bad, it was a nice looking town. My day then consisted of talking to several other hikers and beginning to look at what logistics will be for the White Mountains. Challenging is the answer. But if there's a will, then there's a way. Oh, and a huge thunderstorm came through around 3 PM. I was very glad to be inside!Tomorrow back on Trail. AT only as the Long Trail has now split off headed north to Canada and I'm headed due east to NH. It will be interesting to see if there's a noticeable difference.

So much for being clean. Saw a few SOBO hikers today but no one was in the mood to chat. The heat was a bummer. The Trail was pretty dry today and was in fairly good shape.

Fizzix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666508,"Day 117 13 mi MM 1730Today’s highlight was lunch at Lookout Cabin. It’s a private cabin just off the AT that the owner lets hikers use as a shelter. Would have been a great place to spend the night but I hit it midday. They have a platform on top of the cabin and a ladder to access it. Spectacular views all around. It’s a very strategic location. Would be a great place to bring a telescope. Except that it is miles from everything. I suspect there must be an ATV/snowmobile road close. I’m staying at another “secret hostel” tonight - my third one. These are places that are not advertised and are kind of invitation only. Someone who knows about it deems you worthy and passes on the information. I have my tent set up about 10’ from a great creek - my favorite place to sleep. It has tenting space, water and a shower all for free. This guy has been doing this for 30 years and guesses perhaps 15,000 hikers have come through. Simply amazing generosity!No rain at all while hiking today. So the Trail is getting a little drier making hiking conditions pretty nice. Had 2600’ or so of gain in 13 miles for an average of about 400’ per mile. That number isn’t steep but of course the uphills were much steeper. Still, that number continues to rise as we head east towards NH. I’m pretty comfortable with how I’m performing right now. A few niggles here and there but no major issues. That’s how I’d like to hit the Whites, healthy and rested. So I’m in a bit of a cruise mode trying not to over do anything and not worry about speed or daily miles. Not easy for me to do, but I’m improving. I did hear from my hiker buddy in Maine and she is okay. I was getting a little worried about her. But she is moving forward slowly and I hope safely.

I have probably told you what this means but a little refresher from time to time is a good thing. And nothing really sums the day up better.
Pointless Ups & Downs or PUDs is what we call what the AT designers did to us when we summit hill after hill for no apparent reason. First you go up to a summit only to find no view or anything noteworthy at all. Then you immediately go down the hill only so you can go up another one. Some days are worse than others and today was one of the worst ones. The mileage was only 12 miles but with over 3600 feet of vertical and only one view. The last three miles was basically a long down to get back to river level. So we dropped almost 2000'.  At the same time there was 652' of climbing. Which of course we had to go back down. See the pattern?
The AT has a lot of vertical - all the hikers know and accept that. It's a tough trail. But some days the ups make sense and some days - PUDs. 
Staying at another Trail Angel house that lets us tent in the yard. These are really nice because the give us a place to stay that's more like home than the shelters. A front porch, a portapotty, fridg with soft drinks and friendly talk.
No rain in the forecast today and I got off to a late start so the sun would thoroughly dry my tent. Back on the trail about 8:00 am. It was hot today; no idea what the temperature was but had to be mid 80s. Took a longish lunch break from 1;00 -2:00 to cool off a bit. At about 2:30 the thunder started. At 3:30 the showers started. At 4:30 the heavy rain started. I am really getting tired of being wet. My socks smell so bad I'm not sure I can sleep with them in the tent! Hopefully, my hands and feet will ""de-prune"" tonight.
Fortunately, there's no rain in the forecast for tomorrow. Yeah, right!","MM 1730

As I sit here this evening in NH, I can hear thunder off to the west - yes, towards VT. We may still get something tonight but it's 7:30 and I'm safely in my tent for the night. There's a fair amount of wind so who knows?Vermont was not a fun state but it was mostly because of the rain. When I could look around, there were some pretty parts. The people were really friendly and helpful. I met some really cool hikers. As grumpy as I was those first days, upon reflection, Vermont was okay. I wish I could have seen it in better conditions. 
I entered NH by crossing the Connecticut River (on a bridge) onto Hanover the home of Dartmouth College. The town seemed pretty small outside of the college but I was able to find a restaurant and get a salad and bang bang shrimp. One of my favorites. I spent a good chunk of the afternoon just people watching and letting it cool down a bit. Of course, the first time the sun comes out in a week and I have a five mile road walk on asphalt and concrete. It was really hot!  Fortunately there were a lot of low stone walls and I took advantage of them when they were in the shade. I managed to dry my tent and a few other things in a parking lot. A blazing hot sun and asphalt make a really good drying system. My knee did not like the road walk - it never does. So I took lots of breaks in hopes that it wouldn't get worse. I think it worked because it feels fine tonight. The climbs are getting steeper and longer. I think my miles are going to go back down in the 10-13 mile range as I move forward. Depends on spacing of camping spots, as usual. But I plan to slow down and try not to hurt anything. I've made it this far - knock on wood!The thunder seems to be getting closer. Sigh....","MM 1742

I'm writing this at 10:00 am. This morning is the closest I've come to hanging up my poles and quitting. My legs are completely dead. No idea why. I've done a half mile up rocks and a half mile down rocked followed by two miles of mud and marsh. It's sprinkling already so that doesn't bode well. It's been really hot for a few days. I'm sitting beside a road that has a fair amount of traffic so it would be easy to stick my thumb out and head to a town. It's 6.5 miles to the next shelter. Normally a hop skip and jump. But right now it feels Insurmountable. 
My wife is coming tomorrow to change out some gear for the finish. If she were to pull up right now, I think I'd jump in and go home. Maybe it's good it's tomorrow. Well, I'm going to put my pack on and start walking north again and again and again. I'm really tired...","MM 1754

Still on the Trail. After the morning fiasco, the afternoon got better. The immediate next 2 miles was all nice, dry trail through pine forests. My favorite. I ate and drank a bunch and my legs began to come back some. Long story short, I made it to the shelter at 3:00 before anything more than a little shower. So I was dry on arrival - a big plus.  The forecast is for 2.5 inches of rain in the next 24 hours. Mud slides and flash flooding has been closing some roads in Vermont. But that won’t stop thru hikers! Adapt and overcome. As hikers came in through the evening, I heard more stories about “Worst Day Yet” Maybe something was in the air. Who knows.  It felt really good to have a group that was feeling the same way I was. The consensus is we have come way too far to quit now. I agree. I’ll continue on. I’m lucky because in three miles my wife will pick me up and I get a couple of days of R&R to regroup and prep for the next big push - the White Mountains. Some say that we have completed 80% of the miles but only 50% of the effort. They are really that difficult. I know that’s a little exaggeration. Only a couple of weeks will tell and I intend to find out.  Thanks for ALL the support and I’m sorry for the morning scare. But I think it’s important for people to see some of the lows that come out here too. I’ve said before that getting through the AT is 80% in your head. I need to get my head back in the game.

3981' up 1931' downSmarts MountainNot sure why it's called this - didn't seem any smarter than the other mountains. Back on the Trail today. Wife dropped me off about 9:30 where she picked me up. A late but not terrible start. First mile or so was a beaver pond/ bog. They often go hand in hand. Everything was above water so I was able to stay dry crossing it (in my new shoes) which I'm pretty sure would not have been possible two days ago. Then up a 1000' climb and, of course, right back down because this is the AT and it's what we do. A couple of miles of fairly flat but muddy terrain and then Smarts Mountain. A very long climb of about 4 miles and just over 2000'.  That doesn't sound too bad but it has a trick up its sleeve.  After about 2.5 miles you hit a false summit and the unwary May think they've made the top but not so. I had looked ahead and was prepared. In fact, I was hoping there would be water on this plateau because there was none at the top. I had decided not to haul 3 liters of water up the 4 mile climb - a definite gamble. If I was wrong, then I would have to go another three miles down the mountain to get water. That would mean hiking until 7:00 or later which I do not like to do. 
So here I go. The plateau is definitely wet and muddy - a good sign. But no water, no water, no water. I was coming to the end and had a steep last mile to do. Bad news was no water but good news was I'd be light going up. Then I came on a tiny little stream but it was water!  So I filled everything and started the climb. My gamble had paid off.  This water would not have been there in drier days so from the bad comes good. And just to make the point, after about 15 minutes, the rain started again. I went about 10 minutes because the cool rain actually felt good and then it got harder. I decided to drop my pack and get my rain gear on. That takes a couple of minutes. Back up I go. As is so often the case, it then decides to stop raining. Ok - I'm wet from waiting and im going to be warm with the rain coat on. I figure I only have 30-40 minutes to go so I laugh and tough it out. The AT does not seem to like for its hikers to be comfortable. Part of the challenge you sign up for on a thru hike. Smart Mountain then throws its last pitch at me. The final 0.2 mile has 380 feet of vertical. If you do the arithmetic and I did, that's 1900' per mile - super steep!  In some places there was rebar set into the rock so you had something to grip with your feet. At least it was short. I'm on top and take the first tent site I come to. I was tired, hungry, thirsty and unsure about more rain. But all in all, I was pleased. 
The Whites are coming and this was a tough prep day.","MM 1765

If you look at yesterday, you'll see an up day and today I gave it all back in a mostly down day. It's interesting to note that today only had one major climb and it was 972'. Almost half of the up today was in the ""little stuff"", 50-150 feet at a time that at this point I do t even think about. But they add up, obviously. Starting to run into several SOBO (south bounders) a day that have started at Katahdin and made it this far. They all talk about the rain and the high water. Same thing we NOBOs are worried about. Most don't want to talk very long. Feels like they are in a hurry to get south as fast as possible. I wonder if we would have been that way in the first 500 miles? Maybe so. It takes a while to ""relax into"" the trail.
As I think back, I remember thinking the AT was something to attack and conquer. Ha! What foolishness!!! The AT is more like a partner you have to learn to live with.  It's symbiotic.  It gives; you take. It takes; you give. Speaking of which, fall #15 today. The wood got me again and I skidded off a log. Now the right knee matches the left. Not as bad as the PA fall but still gonna take some care.  No serious damage just another scar to take with me. 
I stopped at 10 miles today because the next reliable place to stop is another 10 and that's too far. There is a ""retired"" shelter in four miles that supposedly has tent spots.  But I've tried that twice before and it didn't work out well. So I found a stealth spot beside a creek and settled in.  I needed time for my knee and I wanted to do some things to my pack. One of the pieces of gear that was worn out was my beloved pack from Zpacks. It was a trooper lasting over 2000 miles since I got it. But I needed to carry some warmer gear for the Whites and more food as well for emergencies. A bigger pack was needed. Enter my second Granite Gear Crown 60. It's about 30% larger and only weighs about 2.2 lbs and it much more comfortable at and above 30 pound loads. Expecting rain to start tonight and go most of the day tomorrow. I don't have cell service right now and my forecast is 48 hours old. So it's mostly a guess. Maybe I'll get lucky and it will stay dry. I doubt it but a guy can hope, can't he???","MM 1775

And for the first time on this hike there was no discernible time between flash and thunder. That means a couple of the strikes were very close - probably on the ridge lines above me. I was pretty low down by a creek. Anyway, no harm or damage. It rained for a couple of hours and was done fore the night. Oh, and remember the shelter/tent site issue. When I went by, I walked in to look around. There were tent sites there. So I could have gone further yesterday. That makes three for three wrong decisions on this issue.

4092’ up. 3129’ down. Mt. Moosilauke Today was a slack pack (meaning I didn’t carry all my gear) of the first 4k mountain. It’s actually 4795’ at the summit.  But I think there is something like 48 mountains in New England above 4000 feet and it’s a “thing” to hike them all. I believe we hit nine peaks on the AT. That’s a number I should know. Very, very steep climb up along a beautiful waterfall that seemed to go on forever. That was really cool. I took six pictures along the way to try to capture it. The summit was in alpine territory. There were no trees, only rocks and small plants that are very fragile. Stepping off trail is forbidden!!! The summit was actually crowded. I was shocked. But there are lots of trails in the Whites and they get used by day hikers.  I was glad to be up and over before noon and any thunderstorms. Rain is supposed to start at 5:00 am and go all day.

I have a plan - somewhat shaky compared to my usual efforts but the best the variables allow. The largest variable is the weather. The alpine zone (the area above the tree line) is bare and exposed. Thunderstorms are common and temperatures can change dramatically in a few minutes. But at least I know where my resupply points are for the next 100 miles. That will have to do. How am I doing?Great question for which i don't have a great answer. I can say for sure that I am not cocky or overconfident. I believe that I can do this but can also see scenarios that make it difficult and next to impossible. For example, if the weather turns very bad for more than two days (my reserve food capacity) then I may have to walk off the mountain via a side trail and find a way into a town (there are really only three) to wait it out. Not desirable but I'm sure it's happened to others. At this point, I think perhaps flexibility and adaptability are more important than physical skills. I think I'm ok there. I recall my flight instructor telling me not to fall prey to ""destinationitis"" - the desire to get somewhere despite the conditions and information you have. That's what kills more pilots than anything else. Extremely relevant at the moment. 
I dont expect to be able to do daily updates because of cell service. So no news is not bad news in this case. Don't fret.

Yes, Mr. Moosilauke is one but the slack pack didn't really give me any information. Now I have some and it's okay, I guess. I averaged 1.15 mph over the whole day. The ascents were not bad; they were steep and rocky. There were a few times I had to throw my poles up and forward so I could use all four paws to climb. I think that will be pretty normal. It was the descents that really slowed me down. At one point I only went 0.4 miles in a half hour. That's crazy slow. My back has been out of whack for a few days and that slowed me down as I was definitely protecting it. What little flat there existed was super muddy so that was slow as well. My conclusion is that I can still get 10-12 miles per day even at that speed but it will take longer than I had hoped. Maybe some of the terrain will be better than today - just have to see. Supposed to rain tomorrow Shocker right.    I have about 9 miles to do to get into town - the last one for awhile. So I get one more data point before it's going to get remote. I start with a 2000' climb that shouldn't be as muddy according to reports. Either way, it will help me guess at how long it's going to take to do the next segment. There's also a map store in town. I'm going to try to get a detailed map of the Whites. My FarOut app has little info about the other trails. They could be really important if I need to bail out at some point. Set up my tent so I could stretch out and try to get this back to relax. Oh, and three little falls today. None deserved a number as I ended up on my butt and pack each time. Still, I used a few choice words on the third one. I would dearly love to see some trail like I'm used to down South.

It took me 4 hours to get there. The Kinsman mountains (north and south) were rugged. Again, no view except the clouds. Soon I will surely get a view. Today had some “throw your poles forward so you can use your hands hiking”. I’m not sure when hiking becomes climbing. Maybe not until you have to use ropes. I felt close to that twice but since I’m not carrying ropes I guess I wasn’t climbing. I walked 10 miles (there was a mile to get to the pickup point) in 8 hours. So the 1.2 mph starts to sound about right. I’ve talked with several hikers who have spent a lot of time here and in Maine and this looks like what 300 of the last 400 miles are going to be like. That’s not great news for me because honestly this isn’t much fun for me. The Trail feels like it’s much more dangerous now than it ever did in the southern states. I feel like when I was 25 I would not have  felt that way. But another 40 years of experience and a lot more brittleness has changed the way I look at rock hopping. Now almost every rock looks like it had the potential to end my hike. That makes for a very stressful day. Also, the body is definitely starting to break down a bit. I’ve done something to my back and it hurts when going downhill. I think it’s just old age stuff; I’m pretty sure I have not damaged it. But compensating for the back is causing the knees to have issues for the first time too. By the end of the day I’m pretty uncomfortable. I’m not the only one either. A lot of folks are taking multiple days off. Unfortunately, I know from experience that this back niggle won’t go away in a day or two. It usually takes a week or two to sort itself out. I hope not this time. We’ll see. Tomorrow I start back up Franconia Notch. It’s going to be a tough climb but supposedly the ridge is beautiful. That would be great. I haven’t seen any of the beauty of the Whites yet and I’d like to. I’ve worked up a plan to get to Gotham which is close to the end of the Whites. One more resupply and nine days will do it. Most of the days are 8-10 miles which I think I can do. **Again, I have no idea about cell service so not sure when I can send an update. I believe that the resupply point will have Wi-Fi but I’m not sure. Wish me luck and send some prayers if you are so inclined.","MM 1816

I’ve consulted with my trail doctor (amazingly I have a little cell service here) and we are both befuddled. I stopped here today with every intention of halting my hike.

Made it to Lakes in the Clouds hut for the evening. This is the largest and busiest hut on the Trail. I heard there were 94 guests here tonight and I got the last reservation yesterday. It sits right next to Mt Washington in the middle of the Presidentials which is why it's so popular. I'm really looking forward to getting to the top of Mt Washington. It's one of the few mountains on my list. It holds the record for highest recorded wind speed (not in a hurricane or tornado) on the planet at 231 mph if my memory is correct.  So the day seemed to go well enough. Fair number of miles and under the 7k mark for total elevation change. That may be where I have problems. Just not sure. But two good days in a row is a real boost for me. Maybe I'm back on track.

Todays summits were Washington, Clay, Jefferson, and Adams. Tomorrow I'll finish the traverse with Madison. The reason for the low miles is that I spent three hours on Washington. It's a place I've always wanted to go. It's billed as having the worst weather in America. There's a sophisticated weather station at the top and I spent some time talking to them. There's a really cool railroad that brings people up and you can drive as well although I didn't see where the cars were parked. It's a very crowded place. I had a chili dog from the cafeteria just to fulfill a bucket list item. 
Before I left the hut in the morning, I had the most delightful time talking with a 4 year old little lady named Remy. She was as cute as could be. I gave her a trail name of Sparkles.  She also made the 1300' climb up to Mt Washington - which is more than most of the people up there did. Just as I was about to start down I heard her yell my name out. So I got to talk with her some more. She is quite an accomplished little hiker already. I hope she keeps it up. Good luck Sparkles!So about noon I started the six mile traverse. It took about five hours which I am comfortable with. The vertical wasn't an issue. Almost every single step was a boulder hop. These mountains are nothing but big piles of rocks. Yes, the views are great but I miss real trails. My feet, ankles and knees are very unhappy with me tonight. I hope they let me sleep. Sometimes when they are this sore, it's difficult to fall asleep. 
I had dinner with a family of seven. They are doing a 3-day family hike of the same territory I just covered only in the other direction. They had a lot of good questions about through hiking. At the end of the meal, I was told they had never seen a sixty year old eat so much.  I could have eaten more. Hiker hunger is real!Got a little shower right before dinner. Probably gonna get some tomorrow as well. Have to wait for the morning forecast to be radioed in. I actually have no idea where I'm going to end up tomorrow.

So I am DONE with the Presidentials and I couldn’t be happier. I know the folks up here are proud of their mountains and they have every right to be. 
But in my humble opinion, the last 75 miles or so haven’t really been hiking. Call it rock scrambling and climbing (granted light weight climbing) and very little hiking. Most of the thru hikers have a similar opinion. The Whites are touted to be the hardest part of the AT. I guess it depends on what you consider hard. For example, I haven’t been short of breath a single time which I consider a good indicator of how hard a hike is. Why?  In order not to fall and be injured, I have been moving very slowly and carefully. Would I be out of breath if I moved faster?  Sure!  But I would likely be in a hospital after a fall. I’ve been close to falling numerous times even at the snails pace. So I don’t think the Whites are hard. I think they are dangerous. Mistakes here have very serious consequences.  Everybody, I’m told, slows down through the Whites. For me, it wasn’t difficulty (for the most part) that caused this. It  was safety. Just like carrying extra food and warm clothes was for safety. 
NH isn’t done with me yet. I have to do the Wildcats next. Really not sure what to expect. They are just hard so the word on the trail goes. I can tell there will be lots of ups and downs but no idea what the trail surface will be like. That makes a huge difference.
Tonight both knees are swollen a fair amount. This is due to the large amount of steep descent on rocks today. Hopefully, they’ll be okay tomorrow for the Wildcats.
I know the NH folks probably don’t agree with me and I’m sorry for that. But I felt it is important to note what my impressions are. Especially since they aren’t in exact alignment with the general story line.","MM 1871

Fizzix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667374,"Day 137 8 mi MM 18873451’ up. 1843’ down. Steepest MileThe second mile out of Pinkham Notch has been deemed the Steepest Mile on the AT.  I don’t know if that is literally true or not but I can tell you it is very, very steep. Every yard was either a rock step or a climbing scramble. 
For the first time, I stowed my hiking poles in my pack in favor of having unencumbered hands to grip with. In the past, I have always just let my poles dangle on their straps when I was climbing but they can sometimes get caught on something or just get in the way.  This time I didn’t want that distraction. 
Most of the climb was on steps as I said. But these aren’t steps like in  your house. These are just rocks stacked on top of each other that stick out a little so you can get your foot (or at least a part of one) on it. Sometimes the stones are round or uneven making you pay close attention to foot placement. I often used hands and feet together like I was climbing a ladder. Glad to have the hands free. BTW, sometimes you are coming down those steps and that is absolutely no fun at all. 
There were several places where you just had to climb. The most difficult one for me was about 20’ long. Imagine you had a door made of two rocks and it was opened inward towards you. The right side would be the wall - in this case an almost vertical flat rock. The left side would be the door - a really big round rock with a kinda flat surface facing the “wall”. The upper 8’ had some rocks wedged into the groove to give some hand and foot holds. The bottom had nothing I could see. I really needed my nephew Jon who is a true climber. He could have told me what to do. I’ve seen him basically walk up these things. What I didn’t have was his arm strength and confidence. What I DIS have was a 30 pound pack on my back.You can sort of see where other people have put their feet because the stone is worn down a bit (making it smoother). I saw almost no hand holds on the way up so I was often just “slapping” the stone with the palm and using friction to grip it. That is a scary thing to do. As you are climbing, all you do is look for the next hand and/or foot hold. Don’t look down and don’t look up too far. Move one thing at a time and keep three points of contact at all times. Somehow that worked. 
Most of the other climbs were much easier because you had a crack to work with or at least some uneven surfaces to grip. I actually enjoyed the climbing - right after I was done with one. No real time to enjoy it while you are doing it. You need all your concentration. Or at least I do. 
So I’m in a section called the Wildcats. A lot of up and down and fairly rocky. But so far all below the tree line so not nearly as mind numbing as the Presidentials were.  
My knee held up on the climbs but was giving me troubles on the descents. A lot of swelling again tonight. We’ll see what tomorrow holds. 
Thanks for all your support!  I need it.","MM 1879

Knees are feeling better...Maybe 80% or so. That will have to do. I talked to more hikers; word is that the next 100 miles may be worse than the last. Just what I needed to hear - NOT!I have another resupply in 50 miles 5 days. My pack is heavy with 5 days of food. But one day and 10 miles at a time, right?
My first few miles went okay. As the day went on, I was feeling drained and needed to get to the next shelter or find a decent tent site. I made my way, enjoying the never ending rocky ""trail"". All I can say is, we are spoiled on the Southern portion of the AT!
Well, push came to shove and my body said it was time to stop. I managed to get myself to a spot where I could set up my tent. It took a lot longer than I hoped but I got it done. I was tired and not feeling hungry so I tucked myself in for the night and waited to see what the next day would bring.","MM 1900

The details in the rest of the section from now until I reach Katahdin may be a little sparse or delayed due to cell service. So don’t be alarmed if there are gaps. I may fill in more details when I finish the northernmost section.

Sitting on top of first mountain. 7 miles in. Tired but all is good enough. Would like to get 8 more in to next shelter. Mostly downhill so it's possible. I expect to lose cell service as soon as I start down.

I'm bedded down for evening at a stealth spot. 13 miles. All in all pretty happy. Gonna have very sore feet tomorrow. Definitely lost part of my hiker legs. At least the feet part.   I'll send this tomorrow when I get to a summit - I hope.","

The Voltaren really works. Right knee isn't a happy camper but isn't that bad yet. One deep water crossing today. Came up to my crotch but was fairly slow current. Another one tomorrow that will be deeper I think but virtually no current.With only three days of food, the pack hasn't been a problem either. On the map, it looks like most of the day was flat but it added up to another 1000' of up ad it was constantly up and down. Do it was actually a pretty good test.

Still doing okay. I am sore but it's the normal "" just getting on the trail"" kind of sore, I think. Cell service will be very spotty from here on so be forewarned. I am hoping to summit on Thursday next week - weather permitting. Right now the forecast is for rain on Wednesday and Thursday is okay. If you are so inclined, please pray for dry weather on both days. I really don't want to climb Katahdin in wet conditions. I won't attempt it if it's raining. And I'd love to have a whole dry day before so the rocks will be dry. 
No real change in any of the medical issues. But I am still able to do almost 2mph the last hour of the day. The end of day exhaustion I was experiencing isn't happening right now.  That's really good news!","MM 2075
