The number of times an AT thru-hiker would climb up Mount Everest is 16 times. Compared to trails in higher elevation mountain ranges, many falsely assume the AT to be relatively flat. In fact, over the course of the Appalachian Trail’s 2,192 miles, thru-hikers gain and lose over 464,464 ft., or more than 89 miles.",,View Entry,"Jan 29, Wed",0

Boone,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628548,"I've been getting out during this Covid mess and have been slowly upping my miles. Just did a 12 mile hike in 4 hours and 20 minutes. Averaging a little under 3 miles an hour gives me hope for my AT thru hike attempt. When is now the question? Originally, I was hoping to try to thru hike in 2021. Covid has messed that up. Partly because I assume that the trail will be really crowded next year by those planning a 2021 hike and also including some of the 2020 hikers, whose hike was derailed by the pandemic. The other reason for the delay is my being able to semi-retire and take a year to attempt the thru hike. 2021 is now my hope and 2022 is more than likely the reality. We'll see, at least I'm getting some good miles in.",,View Entry,"Jun 07, Sun",0
