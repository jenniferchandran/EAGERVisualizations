Pete Schmid,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661471,"Started 3/25 at Lewis Mtn Campground - avoiding the rain on Friday and Saturday morning that most everyone i met complained about.  So, the decision to delay a day for this portion was appropriate.  Walked to Rock Spring hut on Sunday - about 11.5 miles.  mostly an easy walk, in great weather.  Did not run into any folks and expected to be alone at the shelter.  It was supposed to be raining in the morning and so i planned to stay in the shelter for the night, did not want to pack wet gear.  Push showed about 6.  He is a thru-hiker that got an early start and is one of the first to make it this far.  He said he was number nine.  He brought a mousetrap and caught a few of the shelter mice.  Monday was planned to be an 11 mile day.  Got going about 7:30. It turned into a long day.  I was planning to end at Byrd's Nest #3, but ended walking all the way to Pass Mountain Hut.  That made for a 15.3 mile day.  It worked out pretty well since Tuesday was planned for 17.5 miles.  As hard as the 15 miles were, not real sure i would have made the longer distance.  Ran into a few day hikers and some with dogs that were mostly well behaved.  It did not actually rain till about 1 mile before i was going to stop.  More on my rain gear later.  At Pass Mtn, i was surprised to find Push as well as a group of kids and adults out for spring break.  They built a fire and acted like they had been out in the woods before.  One guy snored louder than i have had the pleasure of hearing before, but my head phones worked to mitigate that.  Next stop Gravel Springs hut after 13 miles.  it was a pretty easy walk, but again not many others about.  Stayed in the hut again due to probability of rain.  It did in fact rain around midnight for a bit.  The hut has a resident rat, Annabelle, that likes to steal socks for her nest. Turns out shelter mice are pretty noisy and spent the night racing back and forth on the bunk above me.  Sleep was not great.  I did see Annabelle - she looks pretty healthy.  She does not have any of my socks.  From Gravel Springs hut, the plan was to walk to Tom Floyd Wayside, just outside Shenandoah National Park. Since it was just 3 more miles to the end of this hike, i decided to finish.  Ended up at Mountain Home B&B.  I would recommend them as a great place to stop.  Went into Front Royal for a beer and burger at the local microbrewery.  It did hit the spot.
Weather was great for most of the week.  High was not more than 50 and lows were in the low 30s.  Almost always sunny.  It did snow at the higher elevations Wednesday night. My rain gear was of little help, especially since i left it in the car.  It wasn't supposed to rain.  I won't do that again.  My wife figured out there was more work to do at home than she anticipated, so i am rethinking this through hike a bit and likely turning it into a longer section hike.  The updated plan is to hike May and June.  I should be able to get through about 600 miles.","Lewis Mtn. campground

Pete Schmid,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662903,"time to start again.  i head out on the trail tomorrow, maybe, depends on the weather.  90% chance of rain tomorrow.  i know i will have to walk in the rain, but it seems silly to start with that.  really grateful for the support of my family and friends, especially Amy.  without her support and approval, however reluctant, this wouldn’t be possible for me.  
i’m spending tonight at Mountain Home in Front Royal, Va.  i can recommend it.  neat old farmhouse and the hosts are really great.
i have changed some equipment from the last hike.  of course it all adds weight-carrying a bear canister, have a different pack so the canister is easier to manage, and rain gear.  
i did get my food planning done.  Amy will ship stuff and i have some stuff i still need to buy.
flight up has had an interesting start.  got moved to a middle seat, ugh, but i have the whole row to  myself, yea.  2 dogs and a cat on board as well.  no lunatics screaming about how the airline has somehow wronged them, so that’s good.  flight from Atlanta to Dulles was uneventful.  events of the last few days reminded me that we are not guaranteed tomorrow.  however trite it might seem, Carpe Diem.","Front Royal, Va

Pete Schmid,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663263,"days 3-5:  made it into Harper’s Ferry today 5/5.  it was a nice easy walk.  made it out of Virginia.  only took 8 years.  stayed at Bear’s Den Hostel on Wed night.  the hike in was really tough, the first 2/3 of the roller coaster.  13 miles of straight up and down.  on thursday walked to David Lesser Memorial Shelter.  i am sure there is a story there, i don’t know what it is. it’s been raining a bit.  just enough to be aggravating.  i am grateful that i haven’t been caught in heavy rains.i am past mile 1000 since 2009. not quite halfway.
Wed miles: 10, Thurs: 11, Fri: 8


total AT miles: 53 or so


have met a few through hikers.  they are doing 20-30 miles per day, so it’s mostly hello and good luck as they blast past me.  it’s still early in the season and the bubble hasn’t caught up yet.  


Harper’s Ferry has an interesting place in US history.  At the confluence of the Potomac and Shenandoah rivers, it was of some importance during the civil war.  it was also the place of John Brown’s raid.","

Pete Schmid,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663595,"Days 6-10 - walked from Harper's Ferry to Waynesboro, PA.  Passed the Mason-Dixon line, so i guess i am officially in yankee territory.  Spent the first night out of Harper's Ferry in Crampton Gap Shelter.  That shelter was a hike down into the hollow and, naturally, a nice hike out (ugh).  Met the snake that inhabits the shelter, a nice 4 ft black snake.  probably explains why there were no shelter mice. Lots of tents around, but it was going to rain overnight and so shelter was a better plan for me.  3 other hikers agreed.  Next stop, Pine Knob shelter.  most of the day spent walking in some sort of rain.  Not hard rain, just enough to be annoying.  Everytime I thought it might be a good idea to stop and take a break, the rain decided that was a great time to come back.  have to work on my timing.  One more night in the shelter since it was going to rain overnight again.  Met a few more hikers, mostly folks doing a section of some length.  Some restarting their thru-hike after injury or some other interruption.  Day 9 was a short day.  it was supposed to rain all morning and i had planned to wait out the rain in the shelter and just walk in the afternoon.  I got antsy and the weather report kept moving the time the rain was supposed to stop.  So, off i went to the next shelter.  Got there early enough for a long nap.  Apparently, i really needed some sleep, 2.5 hours later i woke for dinner.  There was an Outward Bound group at the tent sites and so we got a few more hikers at the shelter.  Decided to walk to Waynesboro and take a zero.  That would be day 10.  i had planned to get off at PA 16.  annoyingly enough, i got off a bit short of that on old PA16.  early in the day, surprised some deer in a meadow, 5 of them took off running, so that was pretty neat.  Passed over Antitem creek and through Penn-Mar park.  Lots of civil war history in this area.   I ended walking into town at the end of the day, 2.5 miles.  the road walking was easier than the trail.  Made it to the hotel, got showered, clothes washed, and dinner.  So today, i'm going to sit and relax.  plan is to take off tomorrow and do a short day and then get back to it.I have not yet used my tent due to weather, i expect (hope) to be able to use it over the next few days.  i probably should get over packing up wet, i suspect that will be required before too long.I did complete the four-state challenge, sort of.  The four-state challenge is a 44 mile walk from VA to PA in one 24-hour period.  it starts in VA, goes through WVA and MD, and ends in PA.  it took me 4 days, but ...,One highlight of this section, I met Fresh Ground, this is a gentleman who travels up and down the trail providing food for hikers.  Bacon, eggs, pancakes, fruit, and gatorade for breakfast.  That was a great surprise.Also walked by the Washington Monument, not that one, the one in the Maryland state park.Miles for this section: 44.2Total AT miles this year: 151.6 from Lewis Mountain Campground.","

Pete Schmid,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663821,"days 7-14- Left Waynesboro quite refreshed. Uber and Lyft were a bust so i started walking to the trailhead, about 2.5 miles.  had a short day planned and so not really a problem.  A nice policeman offered me a ride and i accepted.  Saved me about an hour.  Made it Tumbling Run Shelter.  it’s supposed to rain so i spent the night in the shelter.  This shelter has a snoring and a non-snoring building.  i slept in the non-snoring although Amy would say that was not appropriate.  Met Too Much, a two time thru hiker out for a long section.  Also met Early, section hiker wrapping up his thru hike.
Rained all day Sat 5/13, so i walked to Caledonia State Park, called an Uber and spent the night in a hotel.  Next day 5/14, Uber back to Caledonia and off i went.  10 miles or so Birch Run shelter.  Tented since it was a really pretty evening.  
Today was a really long day, 17.1 miles to James Fry shelter.  Completely spent and will sleep in shelter.  didn’t see many folks today. i did pass the halfway point of the AT.  took me 14 years to get this far.
After some discussion with Amy, we decided it might be best for me to wrap this up for the year.  So, once i get to Duncannon, i will likely be heading home for year.
Miles today: 17.1

Pete Schmid,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664160,"5/16: walked from James Fry Shelter to Alec Kennedy shelter.  after the long miles yesterday, needed a short day to catch up a bit.  Some of the climbs were tough.  Rock Maze at the top of one of the hills was challenging in terms of navigation.  It was fun to figure out how to get through without landing on my head.  Didn't sleep particularly well in the shelter.  Tent sites were pretty crappy and so that option went away.  Met Beaker (yes from Sesame Street) and Lost in Town.  They were thru hikers just getting back on trail after 4 days to do some family stuff.  In some ways, i envy them for being able to be away for 6 months.
5/17: walked from shelter in Boiling Springs.  had a great breakfast at Cafe 101.  picked up my box and packed a couple of boxes to send stuff back home.  since i don't plan to be camping on trail between now and the end, i sent a bunch of stuff home.  Today was a nice flat walk through the Cumberland Valley.  Ended at the Quality Inn in Carlisle.  There was a long road walk from the trail to the hotel.  That really wasn't part of the plan.  Unfortunately, that means i have to walk back tomorrow.
5/18: Ended my hike in Carlisle this year.  Made 215 miles on the trail this year.  I am not really fit enough to walk 17 miles plus a 2 mile road walk and then think straight at the end of that.  Uber to hotel near airport.  Uber to Target to get something to put my pack and some stuff in to take home.  TSA doesn't like knives and trekking poles in carry-on baggage.  I did manage to lose one trekking pole in the Uber.  I had used it to measure my pack, so i could make sure it would fit in whatever i bought.  Promptly forget it getting out of the car.  ugh.  
Great flight home.  It was great to see Amy again as well as the cats.  
Time to settle back into that routine.  i have to review the hike and figure out if i need to do anything differently next time and how i can get my pack a bit lighter.  Still working the photos and shrinking them to fit the limits.
thanks for reading.","James Fry Shelter
