Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660462,"If you’ve been a long time Trail Journal reader you may remember me as Mrs. Knobby in 2016 and 2017. Both those years I made a start on the AT at Springer Mt. but I didn’t get far. You can see my journals from those two years under Mrs. Knobbie or Knobby. This picture was then.
Since then I’ve done several section hikes, but now, 5 years later, I’m heading out again to see how far I can go. I’m 70 years old now and white-headed. 
I will be climbing up to Springer on March 26. Wish me well!",,View Entry,"Mar 06, Mon",0
Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660484,"What?? Yes, I’m hiking again. 
A thru hike?? Yes, gonna go as far as I can! 
Starting at Springer again?? Yes! Don’t ask me why. It’s just my thing. 🥴

Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660676,"That’s what I have. Trail brain. 
Someone will be talking to me, and I’ll be trying to be listening, but suddenly into my brain pops, “If I take the purple coat, I’ll leave the long sleeved green shirt at home.”
Or, I’ll be talking to someone, and I cannot come up with the words I’m intending to say, because in the back of my head I’m thinking, “Is that new bear canister actually going to fit in my backpack?”
That’s what’s happening now. I put things in and take things out of my backpack. I have one more week to get ready. Next Sunday I will head to southern Illinois to stay with family and a new great grandbaby for a week, and the Sunday following that, March 26, I should be up on Springer Mt.

Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660914,"I'm packed and ready to leave tomorrow, with a waystop at my son's house for a week of happy grandparenting, then on to the trail the following Sunday. 
I'm writing a post today because I am ready to send out my direct link to trailjournals and I have a few things to say:
1. I am starting on Sunday the 26th with my hiking partner. We plan to hike up and down Springer Mt., which is the beginning of the trail, and then on Monday we will be ready to head out from the bottom of Springer.
2. The most common question I get asked is, ""WHY are you starting at the beginning again? Are you CRAZY??"" The only answer I have is because that is what I want to do!
3. This is my third time to start a thru hike, and I will say what I always say: I will go as far as I can. So far 4 weeks and 6 weeks is nothing to brag about and that was 6 or 7 years ago. Since then I've finished the Smokies and done a few other short section hikes. I'm 70 years old so I'll say it again, ""I'll go as far as I can.""
4. I will try to post when I can find a signal and my phone is charged. 
5. I used to end my posts with a quote of the day. I will probably do that again. If you remember reading one of the quotes before, enjoy it again. If you think you are the person who said that quote, that may be the case! I got a lot of them from other's trailjournals. Don't sue me! Just be flattered that I enjoyed your comments!

Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661196,"This is the last day of helping with the great-grandchildren in Olney, IL. It’s been time well spent getting to know each one better and having time to love on them. Tonight my husband Dave comes and tomorrow morning we drive to Georgia. It’s time to get this show on the road  
I feel unprepared for the trail. New tent. Heavy pack. Tired. But a week from now I will be in hiker stink, a pro at putting up my tent, and slowly plodding along, rested or not.
Next up: pictures from Day 1 of Hike 2023!",,View Entry,"Mar 24, Fri",0
Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661280,"Dave drove me to the Visitor’s Center to check in as a thru hiker. We said our goodbyes and he left for home at 7:30 am. 
When Brigid and her husband Eric arrived we took some pictures at the famous arch. You can check them out on the photos page. 

Then we got down to business and hiked up the mile to the beginning of the AT at Springer. We tackled the roots and the rocks and just a little mud. So technically we started our hike today when we came back down Springer and now we can log that we have hiked the first mile of this thru hike. Woo hoo!
Tonight we are in a lovely cabin and tomorrow morning we will head back and start where we left off today. Time to do some serious hiking.    
There were other thru hikers starting today and many day hikers on the trail. It was a beautiful day with temps about 68 and no rain. 
My thought for the day: A mile on the AT feels like 7 miles in Illinois. I could have walked to El Paso in the same amount of time!","Springer Mountain

Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661338,"We finally got a signal this afternoon but we were climbing Gooch Mt. and it was too hard to stop and update posts for yesterday and today. 

We are sleeping in our tents near the top of the mountain and the wind is roaring b but my tent is sitting  strong so far. It’s cold and I have nearly every layer of clothing on inside my sleeping bag. 

My glasses are somewhere in my backpack and I really can’t see what I’m typing. I’ll try to get up early tomorrow and fill you in on what’s going on. I only have one thing to say:

Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661353,"I have to think hard because already the days run together. Day 2 was a fairly good start with nice terrain. The second half turned into a lot of uphill and we got tired so we stopped short of the shelter and put our tents up at a nice camp spot along the trail. It was cold all night and and I buried myself in my sleeping bag but between leg and foot cramps and cold feet I didn’t get much sleep.
The picture of crossing the creek was the first sketchy challenge. It was narrow and uneven. But I made it nice and dry!
Then came yesterday. We climbed Sassafras Mountain. It was steep and long. The temperature dropped quickly and and we put our tents up in howling wind. It was freezing all night. I shivered like crazy. I finally crawled out about 7:30 this morning. We walked a short while to Cooper Gap and called a shuttle. We are in Above the Clouds hostel, a beautiful place that is filling up with hikers avoiding another cold night.
We will see what tomorrow brings.

Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661407,"And there was a bed for the night. Ahh! A shower, laundry, a ride out for dinner, and breakfast provided. There was a great group of about 12 hikers here for the night. One man with a broken foot and another with screaming knees were both were leaving the trail. I nearly quit yesterday. Seriously! Day 2 of hiking! But we came here, rested and refreshed, and I’m ready to go again. Brigid is patient with me. We are staying in town tonight and getting on trail tomorrow morning, expecting rain.
You should be able to see more pictures under the photo section. The site is not the easiest to follow. But if you look around you will find the photos and the guestbook, which if you sign will give me a mental boost!

Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661462,"Everything is fine…too fine! Tonight we are at the hostel again. It is a full house of 22 hikers, eager to avoid the thunderstorms tonight. So I have a bed (although it’s a top bunk this time and a bit tricky for me), all I want to eat and drink, and I’m safe and sound and dry for the night. 
We did hike today but had a late start so we did just less than 5 miles. Tomorrow will be a similar day, but hiking in the rain. 
I had a great surprise this evening when I met up with a hiker friend named Debbie who was attending a class nearby. She came to the hostel and she and I went to town for supper. Debbie was my first mentor on hiking the AT and I’ve enjoyed some fun hikes with her. An unlikely incident like that is called Trail Magic. It was good to catch up with her today. 
So, yes all is fine, but the weather is a mess with rain and thunderstorms the next several days.

Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661479,"Last Saturday Dave drove me to Georgia. It’s been an interesting week. Fewer miles hiked than expected, more nights in comfort than what we could have hoped for. Brigid and I are adjusting day by day. 


We woke up this morning to torrential rain, thunder and lightning. I was ever so thankful to be inside warm and dry. 


It cleared up and around 10:30 we were back on trail in beautiful weather. Sunshine and warmth with a cool breeze. The trail was nicely moderate. And where we ended up we had Trail Magic by Paul who had drinks, hot dogs, burgers, and many sides to share with hikers. He does it about once a month. 



Physical report:
Shoulders fine. 
Right arm has 3 big itchy bug bites. 
Right arm gets scraped every time I take my pack on or off so it’s just slightly complaining. 
Small cut and bruises on left leg and bruise on right leg from tripping (well, ok, falling) twice on Monday. 
One blister on left foot. 
Leg and foot cramps at the end of the day. 


Overall, I feel ok. But it hasn’t gotten easier…yet.

He loudly sighed and under his breath said, “Oh, man.”I agree, Buddy, I agree!","Neel Gap

Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661568,"Well, we finally had to break away from our hostel. We were comfortable hiking from there using their shuttles from the hostel to the trailheads. 
Today we had to move on. We hiked from Neel Gap to a stealth camping spot. It was raining and cold and instead of stopping to put on gloves, I waited until my hands were so cold that they were nonfunctional. Not smart. Putting up my tent in the rain with fingers that would not move was quite a challenge. 

There are many tents here now with a fire ring burning. I’m snuggled in and not planning to get out of my dirty dwelling. The rain can sure mess things up.
We will see what tomorrow brings.

Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661602,"See that big smile? That’s what happened when I came off the mountain today and saw my husband there with the van to bring me home. 
I don’t know if you could read between the lines, but I was ready to leave the trail by the 3rd day. Enough so that I threw my hiking clothes in the garbage…DONE! But after a shower and a bit of rest I dug them out and carried on. I was very reluctant to leave Brigid alone out there, but after yesterday I was ready to call it. 
Please pray for Brigid…for her safety and that she will fall in line with another hiker or two to continue on with. 
Thank you for all your prayers and interest through my AT years. My miles are done and I’m taking my own best advice: Just go home and read books!! Or maybe someday I will sit down and write a book about my adventures!
Explanation: The second picture listed today is called the boot tree. It’s about 30 miles in where about 1/4 of the hikers quit their thru hike. They throw their boots up in the tree to make their statement. I QUIT!!Quote: What do you like the most about the AT?   Answer: I like all of it but the walking!!","
