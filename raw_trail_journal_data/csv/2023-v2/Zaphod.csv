Zaphod,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/511293,"I have seven and a half years, at most until I try my hand at Thru-hiking. I became intrigued with the idea as a Boy Scout. During Spring Break other students would go somewhere warm and sandy, I went to the AT. January in Pennsylvania, on the Appalachian Trail is a cold place. Then I got a desk job and got seriously fat, and shelved my hiking days as long gone. Two years ago I had weight loss surgery and went from barely able to do 4 miles on paved walkways to doing 40 miles over some of the rockiest parts of the PA section of the AT. The fight now is to stay trim and keep my health until I am an empty nester. This year, in addition to finishing up the last couple sections of the AT in PA that I haven’t hiked, I am planning a 9 day hike from Virginia to PA. It is a small test of planning and my mettle. I think I have the moxie to do it. One way or another I will either section hike the AT done a state at a time over the next 95 months, or I will thru-hike. I am 6 lucky numbers away from going this year. I feel that trail names should be given, not chosen. I am a pretty good cook and teach cooking merit badge for BSA. Dutch oven work is my specialty in the outdoors. I was hiking PennMar to Rte 30 last June with my dutch oven in my pack and made cherry cobbler at Tumbling Run Shelter. My son looks at me and said “Dad- you should be “Chef””. Short and sweet, I like it. Unfortunately, so do a lot of people, and I mean a lot! I don't know if I can carry their karma and my pack as well, so I've dug into my past and decided on ""Zaphod"". Please the Zaphod of the radio series 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' and not the movie, and please not the TV version. That one was so bad they might as well used paper mache to make the spaceship.Only a couple short days before I go on my longest backpacking trip and the furtherst away. One way or another, this is sure to be interesting.","Rock Spring Shelter

Zaphod,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/511602,"I've just gotten the last of the food I will need for my section(s) hike. I would love to say I am totally packed but I need to repatriot my gear from my boys. Bug spray, bug net, canteen (yes I still use one),mess kit, first aid, compass. They have it, but it's always ""somewhere"". I keep my backpack ready, in case I get bitten by white blaze fever and need to work it out. I've read journals where the hikers consider Pennsylvania a swear word and the offender must by a round at the next bar for every infraction, and others who seem as tough as they come (Lucky comes to mind)found the rocky side of PA's section... discouraging. I've only known PA and I still love to backpack, so I hope that it has toughened me up enough for this test. Many thru-hikers I've met really enjoyed VA and I am looking forward to the experience.","Shenendoah Nat'l Park

Zaphod,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/511786,"It was a long car ride. You know how the high dive board doesn't seem very high until you are up there looking down. Skyline drive did that for the Shenandoah hike. Nervous about getting out of the car. Then found out that my boots are busted! Brave or crazy, I decided to press on. Angela broke into tears and then really not sure about the brightness of this venture. Just after I turned off for the site I saw 4 deer!   Feeling better already. I just used a safety pin to try to fix my boot. Tomorrow we'll see if it holds.","Fisher Gap

Zaphod,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/511880,"Well the safety pin held. I guess I'll be in for a penny in for a pound. I had my first trail magic today and it was really cool. Marilyn is the wife of Leopard who is trying the Trail for the third year running. He knows and met Proudfoot from Lancaster. If you ever want to regain your faith in people,you have to hike this trail. After everyone is set up,I'm plugging my mp3 into a speaker and we'll listen to ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy "". Sharing shelter with Sugar,Naptime,Smoke Signal, and others.","Rock spring shelter

Zaphod,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/512264,"The day started out great. There was a deer maybe 75 feet away. It just stood there for me to get my camera. After the shot, I swept my hat from my head, flourishing like in a dance and bowed to Mother Nature for all I had seen and experienced, and the deer bowed in answer! My plans for eating the previous days dinner at breakfast was a mistake with fetticini chicken. I heard from everyone that they had seen bears. Some southbound hiker would warn me,but nothing was there. Towards the mid afternoon I was startled by a roughed grouse two feet away on my right. I let out a hardy ""JEEZ! "" and to my left a bear let out his equivalent of ""JEEZ"" a lot louder and not too happy to be startled. I clacked my poles, gave a yell and put myself in high gear.Hot day and I was in a cold sweat, all hairs up! Glad I didn't get to meet the owner of that growl. I met ""The Leopard and his wife Marilyn.Super woman. Providing trail magic while awaiting husband. Finally took the break body wanted at Elkhollow, regrettable burger. I didn't make it to Gravel Spring shelter,so settled on PATC Range View cabin, locked,but they still have a porch to set hammock on.","Bird's Nest 3

Zaphod,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/512277,"I went the rest of the way up Hogback Mtn and shortly after the lookout (bummer,no handgliders today) I met the Honeymoon Hikers,nice couple. They've done the whole thing twice and half way through third. Told them I'd hiked most of PA,and still liked backpacking. He said I was crazier than him. I take that as a compliment from him. Coming up from Grace Spring I see a road crossing with a red Dakota! Marilyn is there, Leopard had passed me while I was getting water and was sitting down having a snack and a break. He has knee braces so downhill is a problem,but he sets a mean pace especially uphill. I learned about some mushrooms and some tips on pacing. We met up with Marilyn two more times before we parted ways. Most of the trail was well behaved until I left the park. Once out it was like the. difference between PA and DE. Stone staircase reminded me I'm on the AT. Nemo and Serenitina were there at shelter. I must have looked done in, she told me the next day that she almost went to get water for me. That's 0.2 miles downhill. The thought was touching but having gone for it myself,I'd have felt bad. She was a valuable source of knowledge about trail conditions ahead. She put me in doubt of finding enough water.","PATC cabin

Zaphod,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/512285,"Well I started out going downhill a little late because Serenitina_ was full of information. Yesterday while in the park I was going the speed of ""John"" . 16year old son,track,swimmer,2% body fat) about 4 miles an hour, I normally in cooler weather with less weight about 2 miles per hour. I think,let's go a little faster and I can swing by the Cabinn. Then I hit a patch of loose gravel/ stones and down I went. It isn't the blood that bothers me so much as the way my leg twisted in a quite unnatural way. My knee and hip joints won't be sending me any Christmas cards this year. It also makes me slower from pain and caution. I've had great experiences,seen things few have, like looking down on Skyline Drive,been growled at and learned tons from experience and other hikers. The people on the trail are the best. Thru-hikers,section hikers,most casual hikers (if they leave no trace) and the surrounding communities. Scott at the Cabbin saw my knee and was bang after a first aid kit. Do I need a shower,ride to town, whatever. No preconditions. A caring and generous host. My grandfather Dolan, who died before it was born was considered a saint by my mother and others because he was the same way. Lots of kids to feed (during the Depression) but never turned away a hungry person or too busy to tend to a banged up knee. I'd put Scott in this category. Tomorrow,if I'm feeling up to it I'll shoulder my 50lbs backpacking (didn't weigh it but sure feels like it),and be on my way. If caution be the better part of valor, Angela will pick me up before I do any lasting damage. We will see.","Tom Floyd Wayside
