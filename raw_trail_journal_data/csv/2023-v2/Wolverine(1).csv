Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661631,"I arrived to Amicalola Falls VC around 1:30.  After registering I started up the Approach Trail.  Halfway up the first set of stairs to the top of the falls I discovered I did not have my wallet!

I backtracked where I'd been to the VC, asking others along the way (no sign).  A kind volunteer offered to help retrace my steps.  We did so at more of a combing over pace halfway up the same stairs.  Nothing.  Then I talked with his supervisor and thought of cancelling my cards.  I retraced where my shuttle dropped me off again.  Found it in the dirt.  Thank goodness!

By then it was 4:15, so I decided to try to make it to Black Gap.  I got there around 7:15, still enough time to set up in daylight and have dinner in twilight.  I watched some people play Uno, then locked up my consumables in the box.  Easy 8 hours of sleep after being on a bus all night prior.","Amicalola Falls Visitor Center

Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661632,"The forecast, which suggested hypothermia rain for about a week, has not held up so far.  Except for a few sprinkles yesterday, it was just a little cloudy.  Today started out with fog as I made my way from camp to the Springer Mountain plaque, and started the AT in earnest.
It was pretty smooth sailing until I started climbing Sassafras Mountain.  I had to stop twice to catch my breath.  By then the sun was out, and it was getting pretty warm.  I was in a T-shirt and wiping sweat off my face as I climbed.  I followed my way up, then down to Cooper Gap where I lunched with some other hikers.  After a couple more miles, there was a stream where hikers and a family were cooling off.  I was feeling hot enough that doping my head in and drinking water just didn't cut it.  I stripped to my briefs and waded in, immersing myself twice.  I felt much better at that point.  I can't believe I have to do this in early April!  Come July, I'm worried about being roasted.  I don't want to rush, but at the same time, I want to be out of the Mid Atlantic by then.  I think a little discipline and fun can be balanced.
I continued to the Gooch Mountain Shelter.  Nice place, little crowded.  Plus, I wanted to try to reach Neel Gap tomorrow.  I pressed on another mile to Gooch Gap and found plenty of flat spots to camp with a couple car campers.  It's next to a road though.  Hopefully there won't be much traffic. I talked with a guy there who said Atlanta was expecting heavy rain Friday through Sunday that might also make its way into the mountains.  We'll see.. I've hiked all day in rain, but not for three days straight.","Black Gap Shelter

Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661726,"My main goal today was to get past the 5 mile required bear canister section of the GA AT.
It was foggy and misty most of the way to the summit of Blood Mountain.  I appreciated the cool air, but was still sweating like a pig.  I got there around 1.  Lucky for me, the sky cleared up, and I got to see a good overlook.  I descended in the sun to Neel Gap by about 2 and headed to Mountain Crossings.
My pack was feeling a little heavy and a few others had commented on it, so I elected to have a pack shakedown.   From my move and bus ride, I was already aware that I wanted to send some things for my dad to hang on to.  I spilled out all of my gear and the lady, an AT thru hiker like all employees there, went from big three to clothes to toiletries.  I ended upstanding back an extra rain jacket, pogies, an extra long sleeved shirt, glasses (need for driving during the move to storage), a daypack (handy for the bus ride), an extra travel sized bottle of mouthwash, a few separately packaged clean wipes, a bear line (not needed with an Ursack I had), and a bottle and a half of Picaridin repellent (she said to save it for MA).  After that and throwing out some trash, my pack weight went down 3 pounds!
I was surprised I could chow down an orange, Snickers, 3 energy drinks, and an 8 inch pizza after just 2 and a half days of hiking.  I guess I should be eating more.
One guy I talked with, Alex, said that the midpoint for difficulty (not mileage) is New Jersey!  He said he hiked the Long Trail for his AT shakedown hike, and that he was hard pressed to identify any part of the Georgia AT that compares to the difficulty level in VT.  That makes me more nervous for VT, NH, and ME, but I'll have 2.5 months before I hit VT, if things go as I expect and hope.
It was looking like it would be a pleasant evening to stroll out some more, so I hiked a few more miles to Wolf Laurel Top, a great dry campsite with a big fire pit, where I had a good view of the mountains to the east unblocked by trees, all to myself.  That is, until Alex dropped in about an hour after I set up my tent.  I was tired and relieved he was not a bear.","Gooch Gap
",Wolf Laurel Top,"Apr 05, Wed",18.10
Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661727,"I bade farewell to Alex, and shortly thereafter was delighted with the views on Cowrock Mountain.  I'm sure that is the best view on the Georgia AT, and I had it all to myself.
Most of the day didn't require climbing any big mountains.  I hiked toward Blue Mountain Shelter, where I heard there was a good view.  It would have been great, if it weren't for the trees in the way.  As I took a little break in the crowded camping area, 2 out of 3 people I greeted there were not very friendly, so I dropped a deuce in the privy and left.  I would seek to camp out on Rocky Mountain instead, which would require schlepping up 2 liters of water to the top.  
When I reached Unicoi Gap, I was pleasantly surprised to encounter my first trail magic!  A nice lady operating the Hiawassee Shuttle bus provided me with an assortment of trail snacks, water, fruit, and even a donut.  She was just about to leave too.  I'm glad I didn't stay at the shelter.
After some chit chat with a family from Ohio I climbed up to Rocky Mountain, getting water from a stream about halfway up.  Still a few tents, but not crowded.  The advertised view of the mountains was pretty good, unobscured by trees.  The GA section hikers from MS/AL there made a campfire and we chatted a bit over dinner.  Again, I'm glad I didn't stay at the shelter.","Wolf Laurel Top

Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661886,"Scattered showers into early afternoon.  Two big climbs - Tray Mountain and Kelly's Knob - but I'm starting to get used to the difficulty.  I didn't even realize I had hiked through Kelly's Knob until I looked at the guide after lunch.
I reached Dick's Creek Gap around 2:10, clothes all wet and dirty.  The guide indicated that Around The Bend hostel was 0.6 miles to the west along the road, so I walked there.  They had no vacancy for a same day reservation, but I paid a day use fee to shower, do laundry for my hiking clothes and use some loaner clothes, and they even gave me a drive into Hiawassee, where I had an amazing burger, fries, salad, and bottomless fountain drinks.  I dined with 5 other thru hikers.  One from London, one from South Africa, one from Maine near the Canadian border, one from Quebec City, and another from Minnesota.

We returned via the shuttle to the hostel.  I worked on a jigsaw puzzle with some of them and the conversation went from one thing to another.

The guy from Maine said he was going to hike part of the International Appalachian Trail once he reaches Katahdin to the Canadian border, which would basically take him home.  I inquired about this stretch of trail.  Apparently it is about 140 additional miles and followed roads.  I'll think about it more, but I'm sure 2200 miles will be plenty.

Some other fellow hikers at the hostel who went to Ingle's generously offered free strawberry short cake, honey dew, and cookies.  It was a great decision to head over to the hostel!
At sundown the hostel dropped some of us who dined together - Tom, Trevor (Chicken), and Étienne - back off at Dick's Creek Gap, because no rooms were available for us, where we all camped together nearby.","Rocky Mountain

Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661888,"Steady rain all day.
It was great to cross the GA/NC border, but then there was a step climb to Couthouse Bald, with no view.  Wind gusts made me eager to climb every hill I could to stay warm.

It was so rainy that I stopped at Muskrat Creek Shelter along the way to get warm.  There were already several people there, some in sleeping bags trying to warm up midday, and more rolled in.  I put on my dry layers and made some ramen for lunch.  I felt better, but after a while was cold again.
I decided to press on to the next shelter.  I shivered at first in my wet hiking layers in the rain, but my umbrella helped a bit.  At this point, the trail was more of a creek in most parts, and a stream in others.  Once I got to Deep Gap I found signs for trail magic, hooray!  These guys pulled out all the stops.  Warm pulled pork, baked beans, hot tea and coffee, fruit and desserts.  And great company too.
After I got my fill, I got cold again and continued on.  I reached the shelter and it was still raining, but forecasted to stop at 7 or 8.  I decided to wait to pitch my tent.  The shelter was full of people in their sleeping bags.  It can be awkward to strike up conversation with thru hikers who just met you while observing how well they get along with people they have hiked more or less together for about a week.
The rain eventually stopped and there was a pretty sunset through the trees.","Dick's Creek

Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661889,"What a fantastic day for hiking.
My things were all wet from Saturday, and I got started a little later.  The morning was very cool and started out with mist, which made for a great view of peaks islands in a sea of fog near the Standing Indian Mountain summit.  For nearly two hours, I could hike without taking off my jacket without breaking a sweat.  There was faint light in the fog through the forest as I hiked in the morning.
It eventually warmed up, and as I reached the base for the climb to Mt Albert, I saw Easter themed trail magic there!  Brought by locals Roger, Cindy, and their dog Annie. I had a hard boiled egg, cherry tomatoes, a ginger ale, some fruit and candy.
I enjoyed reaching my first 100 miles of the AT at the top of Mt Albert.  The top of the fire tower was closed, so I continued on my way through rolling terrain for another 6 miles or so.  I ran into some day hikers who said that in just 1.7 miles, there was another trail magic set up at Rock Gap!  Well, I couldn't miss that.

I got there and it was the same group as from yesterday.  This time, they were serving made to order omelettes, plus hash brown casserole, fruit, desserts, plus they were packing sandwiches and treats to go.  Sign me up!  Everything was amazing - so fortunate to have that.  I feel spoiled now.  Maybe there is some way for thru hikers to contribute to organizations who provide this trail magic.
Not feeling keen on sleeping near a shelter again for multiple reasons, I made my way toward Winding Stair Gap past the waterfall to find a suitable campsite.","Standing Indian Mountain Shelter

Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661890,"Another beautiful spring day.  I made my way through the steep ascents of Siler, then Wayah Balds.  I had a blissful lunch on the grass while enjoying the amazing overlook.  Then I pushed in, enjoying downhill and more overlooks at Rocky Bald and the fire tower at Wesser Bald.  I joined a few others at a makeshift campsite 0.3 miles before the shelter.","Campsite near waterfall
",Wesser Bald Shelter,"Apr 10, Mon",21
Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662064,"This morning I headed through sunny and generally cool weather mostly downward to Nantahala Outdoor Center.  Lots of great views, but the downhill seemed more racing than the steep uphill yesterday.
At the NOC, I resupplied, showered, recharged, and printed out my Smokies permit .  I had a delicious lunch at the River's End restaurant - Carolina blackened trout with sherpa rice, green beans, and a cup of fresh fruit.  I should have taken a picture of how well presented it was, but before I knew it, I had snarfed it all down.
I was ready for the steep climb out of the NOC around 2.  It was toasty.  I got some great views as I climbed and reached the top of the bald, but the steep downhill was annoying.
I chatted a bit with another hiker, Lego Man, from NH.  He carries a man made of legos in his pocket that his niece made for him.  He recounted the story of how he misplaced it while hiking the Long Trail, but eventually recovered it from some other watchful hikers.","Wesser Bald Shelter
",Locust Cove Gap,"Apr 11, Tue",16.70
Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662065,"In the morning climbs I ran into hikers GG, Stakes, and GB the Gummy Bear King.  GG lives in Iowa but does work on Isle Royale.  All three of them are fast hikers, but they wisely stopped at Cable Gap Shelter around 1 as the day heated up.

I pressed on, swatting a lot, up more steep hills and finally saw the beginning sights of the Fontana Dam through the trees.  It took another 90 minutes or so to actually get to the lake though.  I went to the marina and enjoyed some refreshments and a couple more dinners that I hoped would get me to Hot Springs.

I hiked with Tank Girl to the Fontana Dam ""Hilton"" Shelter.  She got her name because she is always looking for water.  After a 5.5 week hiatus due to third degree burns, she is continuing her thru hike and needs to redevelop her trail legs.
I was impressed with the accommodations at the Fontana Hilton.  Potable water, a solar powered recharging station, showers and a restroom, plus a fire pit and beautiful overlook of the lake.  All for free.  It is basically front country camping, and in fact, I saw families there.
I chatted a bit with a few hikers while I cooked some ramen and recharged.  I took a shower before bed.  It's such a privilege to feel a little clean going to sleep.","Locust Cove Gap
",Fontana Dam Shelter,"Apr 12, Wed",18.50
Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662066,"It was a cool, sunny, and windy morning.  The walk through Fontana Dam was scenic in itself.  For some reason, I was welling a bit with emotion as I approached the entrance to GSMNP.  I haven't even hiked 200 miles of the AT yet, but this seemed like an important milestone to me.
The climb to the ridge wasn't as bad a couple of the monster climbs I did yesterday.  Once there, it was basically rolling terrain all day.  I saw a lot of wildflowers and mossy tree stumps.  There were also a lot of views of Smokies range through the trees, and occasionally even a great view in plain sight.  It was windy most of the day.  I could feel it more as I climbed uphill, and stopped when I descended.  That gave me another reason to prefer uphill climbs today.
I leapfrogged with Smoke and Holy Shit from late morning to mid afternoon.  I got to the junction for Spence Field Shelter around 3:30.  I took a break and thought about going to the next shelter, Derrick Knob.  Considering how I was cruising through mist of the day and the last 6 miles in particular, I figured another 6 miles wouldn't be so bad, so I decided to go for it.
Unfortunately, the next 6 miles to the Derrick Knob Shelter were much more rugged than my previous 6 miles of mostly rolling terrain.  There were climbs up mountains and steep, slow going descents.  The trail was unmarked for at least an hour of hiking.  But it was also much more scenic, which led to lots more photo ops.  I thought I'd get there before 7, and ended up arriving closer to 7:45.  It was tent city there.  The wind picked up, which made boiling water more time consuming.  I chatted a bit with some people, and Struggle Bus showed me how to use the bear cables to hang my food.  I got to bed about an hour later than normal.","Fontana Dam Shelter

Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662497,"Today I thought it would be fun to visit Gatlinburg, after hearing that there is a free shuttle between Clingmans Dome and the city.  I didn't really need to go there, but I felt like I was rushing through the Smokies, which I was loving.  I thought a visit to a tourist town in the heart of it would help me to soak it in more.  So, I aimed to try to make the shuttle arriving to the parking lot at noon.
There was a drizzle on and off starting early in the morning.  There was more rolling terrain, but as I gained elevation, I entered an alpine zone.  I loved the lush areas, full of stumps and logs covered in moss, along with the sweet alpine air like I experienced in the ADKs and the Whites.  I tried to soak it in and record it with photos and videos, all the while pressing on to try to make the shuttle.
Time was running out, and the rolling terrain became a steep climb as I approached the dome. I got to a trail going to the parking lot and jogged down it carefully when encountering other hikers or wet, uneven terrain. Then I had to go back up the last tenth of a mile to the parking lot.  By that time, it was about 11:55.  I went up the trail as fast as I could, and reached the parking lot around 11:58.

I looked around and checked for white vans.  I saw one, but the man who responded said he did not know of any such shuttle.  I walked around and checked more, but found no other clear shuttle vans resembling those that the church would be operating for thru hikers.  
Apparently, they left early. 
 So, I waited for a while.  I chatted with passers-by who inquired about my hike.  One of them bought me some trail mix and water at the gift shop!  Very kind of her.  As I talked with my dad on the phone at 1, a man there who works near Gatlinburg offered me a ride.  Awesome!  We chatted about his hike and his job building yachts on the way there.
Once there I had lunch and recharged my phone.  Then it started raining on and off.  I was concerned about getting a ride back.  I went to the Gatlinburg NOC and asked about shuttle rides.  He gave me some numbers, but my request was too last minute; everyone already had plans or was out of town.  Unless I wanted to hitchhike to Clingmans Dime at 6pm -- a hitch that seemed unlikely -- I was stuck in town for the night. To make matters worse, there were a host of events this weekend, including the Spring Rod Run in nearby Pigeon Forge.  The hotels raised their prices accordingly.
Then I realized I would have to fork over the money.  I found the cheapest place, and still paid more than twice what it was worth.  But, I get my first night in a bed, took a shower, washed my clothed, and fully recharged my phones.  I grabbed some dinner and went to bed.
I'm hoping this 8am shuttle back to the dome from the Gatlinburg NOC will pull through.","Derrick Knob Shelter
",Gatlinburg,"Apr 14, Fri",9.90
Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662498,"What an amazing day.
After breakfasts at 2 different places in Gatlinburg, this time I successfully connected with the First Baptist Church shuttle at 8:30.  I rode with Happy Dancer and Cheek and the conversation on the way was football.
It was foggy at Clingmans Dome and I couldn't see anything.  I left and made my way for Newfound Gap.  I ran into the last 2022 SOBO hiker, No Rush.  He also described himself as Slow-Bo, or slow southbounder.  He asked me if I started in April and I responded April 3.  Surprisingly, he wanted to have his picture taken with me.  I happily obliged and also got one of my own.  So far, he has wanted to get a picture taken with the first January, February, March, and April NOBO starter.
I again took time to admire all the moss on the trees and took way more pictures of it than I needed to.  The sky cleared up, and soon I could start to see overlooks.

That in itself would make for a great day, but when I arrived to Newfound Gap, there were not just one, but two trail magic stands!  One by a AT thru hiker from last year and her boyfriend, and First Baptist Church.  Day packages, first aid kits, fruit, candy, chips, beverages, and more.  I probably stated there for about an hour eating food that they offered, and chatted about hiking, our reasons for hiking, traffic in the Smokies, etc.  Other hikers rolled in and it was a bit of a reunion.  Many were hanging out there to catch the shuttle at 3.  But I wanted to press on, since I had only hiked 8 miles and wanted to get to Charlie's Bunion today, because rain was in the forecast tomorrow.
It was rolling terrain with some overlooks here and there, but because the weather was so nice, and apparently also Spring Break, thus Saturday was full of day hikers going to Charlie's Bunion and the Jumpoff overlook as well.  I managed to muddle through the crowds without much delay.  One hiker gave me a king sized Snickers!
Charlie's Bunion had outstanding views.  I was there one other time in May 2020 the week of Memorial Day, and ran into a thunderstorm.  But then it was sunny on Clingmans Dome 3 years ago, so at least I got to experience a good view from both at some point in time.
I continued on relatively easy terrain and admired view after view.  I was so glad I packed a longish day in before a rainy day.  I ran into Jersey (who wears a jersey) at one of the views.  I finally got to the shelter around 7:30, though I didn't start hiking until 9:30.  So the terrain was not bad at all.  And all that trail magic was a major morale booster.","Gatlinburg
",Peck Corner Shelter,"Apr 15, Sat",18.50
Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662499,"There was an early rain, but by the time I was getting up, it was a drizzle. The expected rainstorm ended up being a cool, wet, and partly cloudy morning.  I still saw plenty of overlooks and even got to admire the moss adorned trees in the alpine zone one last time in the Smokies.
I made my way past the junction with the Balsam Trail, the last place in the Smokies where I'd been on the AT in the past.  The next area would be Grayson Highlands.
There were no big climbs - mostly rolling terrain, except for a lot of downhill towards Davenport Gap in today's last few miles, where I will exit the Smokies tomorrow.
I arrived to Davenport Gap Shelter, where I learned that there were no sites nor any feasible makeshift spaces for my tent.  I was not interested in pressing on another 2.5 miles to a campsite outside the Smokies.  The crew inside the shelter was plenty friendly.  So, I decided to try it out.  Instead of bear cables or boxes, there was a cage with a chain door to lock out bears and rodents.  The door with the chain was partly broken, so we needed to improvise by threading the chain through the cage holes.","Peck Corner Shelter
",Davenport Gap Shelter,"Apr 16, Sun",19.80
Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662500,"I was lucky if I got 2 hours of sleep at that shelter.  Part of it was allergies or maybe a cold, and the rest was the noise everyone else was making while slept or tried to.  I need to stick with my plan of not sleeping in shelters.
It was a sunny and cool day.  The exit from the Smokies at Davenport Gap was unceremonious, unlike the Fontana Dam entering point.  However, some trail angels past the I-40 underpass gave me some free food and took me to visit Standing Bear Farms, where I had breakfast and got rid of my trash.  Interesting place, but I was still cautious about the hefty price I paid for the hotel in Gatlinburg.
There was plenty of wind, which made the long climb towards Max Patch easier.  I decided to camp a half mile below the summit, so that I could watch the sunset and sunrise there.  It was very windy up there - maybe 30mph - but the sunset was amazing! I really hope I can get up there in time for the sunrise.
Unfortunately, after I turned off my camera cell phone (I also have another phone with service) to save the battery, I misplaced it. I looked all over my tent and campsite.  I retraced my steps back up to the summit.  Nothing.  I returned to my campsite and checked again.  I looked through the leaves on the ground and used a stick to feel around on the ground for a hidden phone.  Nothing.  I am so disappointed and angry that I lost it.  There are hundreds of pics from the Smokies, along with the Max Patch sunset shots, that are on that phone.  I will try to look more tomorrow morning.","Davenport Gap Shelter
",Campsite below Max Patch,"Apr 17, Mon",16.60
Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662501,"My alarm went off at 5.  It was a very windy, cold night a half mile from the summit of Max Patch.

I planned to return after daybreak to the campsite to check again for my phone, so I fetched some more water around 6:30 a short walk further down.  I saw hikers coming up to see the sunrise at the summit.  I told a few of them about my lost phone - more than one pair of eyes could help.  I checked through the campsite again for the phone when I returned, since I didn't need my headlamp on anymore.  No sign of it.
I walked up to the Max Patch Summit again to join the half dozen hikers for the sunrise, keeping my eyes peeled for my phone along the way.  The sunrise was glorious.  I took a few shots of it using the phone of my cheap camera so that I would at least have something.

After checking the summit and the climb up, I returned to the campsite and searched around it with the help of a stick to move away the leaves.  I was making such a racket that one hiker coming up during my search thought I was a bear.  Yet, I couldn't find it.  I was and continue to be disappointed about it.  I lost 3 days of pictures in the Smokies, including picture perfect shots at Charlie's Bunion, mystical fog mixed with light walking through moss adorned woods, and fantastic Max Patch sunset shots.  I also ended up losing my sitting pad at some point.  Are they both buried under the campsite leaves or were they swept away by 40 mph gusts on the Max Patch summit?  I don't know, but it was time to move on and try to be smarter about my things.
The trail was mostly downhill to Hot Springs.  But it was already 8, and I did not want to lose anymore days of photo ops on the trail, so I was determined to make it down to Hot Springs early enough to buy a phone with a suitable camera in a nearby city.
I went through the hike quickly, with my first break lasting 10 minutes.  I hiked for at least another 3 hours before I got to Garfelo Gap.  I ran into a few people there enjoying soda.  One of the offered me one, which I was happy to take.  I told them of my predicament.  They gave me suggestions.  One hiker even posted a comment on the Farout app about my issue, and proved my phone number of my backup phone in case anyone found my smartphone.

Ultimately it was decided that Weaverville was the closest city to Hot Springs that sold the kind of phone I wanted.  The guy who offered me a soda said he also did shuttle drives.  He was providing a shuttle at that time for a group doing a slack pack, but said he'd be available once they finished and unloaded.  I figured that would be around the time I'd get to Hot Springs.  He gave me his phone number and introduced himself as Smoky Bear.
After about 7 more miles, I reached the charming town of Hot Springs.  I was agitated that most of the restaurants were closed, but finally found a good pizza place open.  I think it was Vinyl Pizza Pies.  Delicious, affordable with quick and friendly service!
I found a bunk available at the Laughing Heart Hostel.  I was disappointed that I didn't have phone service and couldn't call Smoky Bear.  A lady at the nearby Hillbilly Market let me use their phone.  It turned out that Smoky was at the parking lot of my hostel - what luck, relative to my recent misfortune.
He drove me out to the Walmart in Weaverville and I got the phone, plus some much needed fruits and vegetables.  I am very grateful for his help.
So glad that this at least worked out.  I chatted with a few hikers, got a shower, ate a very healthy dinner of my fruits, vegetables, and some hummus, did laundry and went to bed.  Wow, what a day.","Campsite below Max Patch

Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662502,"I slept surprisingly well in the bunks, but then again, the last two nights on the trail were not so great.  It was a friendly group.  One kind hiker even offered free eggs and toast with fruit preserves while it was available.  I took him up on that and also left all my remaining food I bought that I couldn't take with me.  The oranges were popular; hopefully others will eat the carrots, grapes, bell pepper, and hummus.
I stopped by Hillbilly Market and the Hot Springs Outdoor Outfitters store to get a few more resupply items, liner socks, and another sitting pad.  Then I finally crossed the French Broad River for the long climb out of Hot Springs.  But it was very scenic, and I ran into a group of day hikers who gave me a couple cookies and some chocolate.
The liner socks definitely made a difference.  I didn't notice any hot spots today on my feet.  It was hot today though, which made chafing at my waist the big issue.
During the afternoon, I ran into Smoke and Holy Shit again!  They were surprised to see me - Smoke thought I'd be in VA by now, but that is just crazy talk.  Apparently a 10 mile day, which I did when going to Gatlinburg and then not being able to leave, is a nero to them.  I guess it's a few hours, but some stretches if this trail are rugged enough for 10 miles to take more than five hours.  They wanted to camp away from the shelter where I planned to set up camp (a generous distance from the actual shelter), so we parted again at Allen Gap.
It was a steep climb, and there had not been many water sources that day.  I still had a liter left and could make it the 5 miles to the shelter.  On the way I saw a sign for trail magic - home baked cookies and filtered water!  I was surprised how much of it I drank.  I talked with lady there for a bit.  She and her husband are from near Akron, OH, but were sick of city noises and light pollution.  They love their home in the mountains now, and apparently a wireless Internet project is underway in their region.
I finally made it to the shelter.  During dinner I chatted with OG Lost & Found from Boston, Nick from Australia, Benny from Germany, My Way, and Jesus.","Hot Springs

Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662504,"Today was a hot day.  Most hikers left the shelter area at least an hour before me - I left at 8.

It didn't help that I had a big climb right off the bat to Big Butt Mountain.   It featured a scenic trudge walk though.  On the way, I discovered that I had serious dehydration.  I immediately drank a liter and a half of water, and started taking a big gulp of water every half hour or so.  My condition gradually improved, but I still have a lot of hydrating to make up for.
It was a long, slow day in the heat.  I was on my own for most of the day, except for a few hikers around 10 and 5.
I skipped a dry campsite I intended to use and headed to the next shelter.  There I found Benny, Spoon,  and others to chat with over dinner.  I imagine the others were tempted by the hostel near Devil's Fork Gap.  Then again, a couple of them, like My Way, are distance junkies, so they might be even further ahead.","Little Laurel Shelter

It was a very scenic morning.  I climbed up to Big Bald Knob from Sam's Gap, along with a few small groups of weekend backpackers and day hikers.  It was a fantastic view that rivaled the one on Max Patch, though I was on Big Bald Knob around 11, well after daybreak.

On the way up, there was a cooler full of trail magic!  Plastic bags with a hard boiled egg, 2 slices of cheese, a banana slice, and a cookie, plus vans of La Croix.
The rest of the day was leapfrogging between day hikers when I took breaks, to Spivey Gap.  I pressed on to the next shelter, running into Nick along the way.  I found Benny at the shelter and chatted with him, plus Spoon, Ronin, Scoops, Reacher Man, and My Way during dinner.","Hogback Ridge Shelter

It started out with a downpour early this morning.  Then scattered to steady showers until around 8.  Mostly downhill for 6 miles with some scenic overlooks of Erwin.  I got to Uncle Johnny's hostel just in time to get some provisions and catch a shuttle into the center of Erwin.

I chilled at a coffee shops for a couple hours, then looked at Erwin Outdoor Supply before meeting Aunt Mary and heading to Asheville.  Beautiful drive!
I resupplied and my aunt paid for most of the resupply items while I was fetching codes for bulk items.  I hope to PayPal her back.  I showered, did laundry, dried out my gear, and chatted with Aunt Mary and Uncle Randy.  Then we went out to eat at 828 with my cousin Melissa.  Everything there tasted amazing!  I walked around Beaver Lake and hit the hay.

The day started out a little warn and sunny, but eventually became mostly cool, overcast, and windy.  It's great hiking weather, but a little chilly during breaks.  But because of that, and some easier terrain stretches, I was still able to get in a substantial day.
The highlight was the beauty spot, where I had lunch.  After that, there were a couple moderate climbs.  The shelters from Erwin to VA don't have privies, so I tanked up on water at a spot before Cherry Gap Shelter where I ran into Nick again, and looked around for a decent flat spot for my tent.  I eventually found one beyond Iron Mountain Gap, about 0.3 miles south of the peak with the rock pillars, with a nice view of the sunset through the trees.  It was windy and cold, though.","Asheville

The climb up to Roan Mountain was moderate but very long.  I also carried about 3 liters of water up, which didn't help things.  As I reached 6000 feet again during the colder weather here, I noticed patches of ice and even icicles.  On the way I met C from Front Royal, VA, who was crushing the climb.
I made a brief side trip to the Roan High Knob Shelter - the highest shelter on the AT - but I saw no one there.  Totally reasonable given how cold it was up there.  I prized the brief warm spots in the sunlight as I descended to Carvers Gap in what was otherwise another delightful alpine zone.
Once I got to Carvers Gap, I was pleasantly surprised to learn that there was trail magic in the parking lot!  A big team of trail angels hosted quite a trail magic lunch banquet.  Grilled cheese, chicken noodle soup, lentil soup, hot water with tea and coffee mixes, fresh fruit and vegetables, homemade banana bread, hard boiled eggs, and a smorgasboard of hiker treats and resupply items. I was handed a freshly finished grilled cheese as soon as I got there and was handed another after so finished my first one!  I was delighted to enjoy this warm lunch, and thankful that it was out in the warm sun.
After a while of eating and gathering a few treats, I started hiking towards the Roan Highland balds, the country opened up.  NC mountains  on one side, TN mountains on the other.  The views were spectacular up Round and Jane balds.  After an hour of descent I started up one last bald for the day to Little Hump, which was again spectacular, then set up camp just past the next water source I found beyond and below the summit.  Despite being hundreds of feet higher than yesterday's camp, there was less wind, which made for an easier and more comfortable dinner.","Campsite below Rock Pillars

I was not thrilled that I would have to road walk and hitch to the town of Roan Mountain from Hwy 19E, so I pressed on, as I already had plenty of food to get to Hampton.  I spotted a few scenic views every once in a while.

I saw a trail maintainer painting the blazes near the Isaacs Cemetery.  It was the first time I had ever seen that.  He explained that in this section, the grass grows waist deep in June, and he has to weedwhack the area so that the back of the thru hiker bubble cam get through the section.  I had no idea trail maintainers had to do so much work regularly for the trail's benefit.  I thanked him for his work.
I saw a number of day hikers returning from Jones Falls, via a short blue blazed trail off the AT.  If that alone did not already suggest I should do it, there were comments right on the sign to the falls, such as ""100% Do It!""  So I did, and was pleasantly surprised to see a waterfall that reminded me of Amicalola Falls.
The AT was less difficult today than it was through Roan Highlands.  I took advantage of this, and the milder spring weather, to hike a longer day.  I was also concerned about steady rain tomorrow, and wanted to head for the hostel at US 321 without a full day of hiking.

I ended up hiking a mile and some past Hardcore Cascade, where I found a weakly flowing water source and a few campsites.  I was surprised to see that no one had taken any spots.  But I enjoyed a peaceful evening at camp, with one less top layer than yesterday.","Campsite below Little Hump Mountain

I followed a brief, flat area and descended to the lovely Laurel Falls.  I noticed blooming laurel along the way.  I followed the rapids then ascended to Pond Mountain.  By this time, it was overcast.  I found no pond at the summit, but took some water at a trickling source there.

Light drizzle was on and off for the descent to US 321, about 2.6 miles from Hampton.  I decided to make it a lower distance day, and stay the night at the nearby Boots Off Hostel.  There I ran into Spoons again, as well as several others, including Gripper Overreach, a SOBO who started last August and took three months off over winter.  Nutz, another hostel owner in VA, was there to provide a shuttle into town.  We stopped at a grocery store and I grabbed some dinner to go at Subway.
Back at the hostel, Fire and Mayhem were kind enough to make hot water for tea during dinner, and even offered some of their pasta.  I enjoyed my first outdoor shower (in a sheltered area), and was impressed by the hostel's outdoor bathroom: it had a flushing toilet and sink with soap and paper towel dispenser.
After dinner, people made a campfire, and Eggs and Homer provided music with the hostel guitar and drum.  General conversation and merriment ensued.","Campsite beyond Hardcore Cascades

The rest of the day was hiking up and down ridges, with occasional views of the lake through the trees.  The sky became overcast.  Isolated droplets started around 11, then drizzle at 12:30.  Showers on and off from 1:30 onward.
I made my way quickly past two shelters.  With more rain, I used the next two shelters for breaks.  I was moving fairly quickly through the miles.  The hostel hostess mentioned that the 21 miles of the AT heading to Damascus are the easiest 21 miles of the AT.
After lunch at Iron Mountain Shelter, I headed mostly downhill to a parking lot.  Across the road was a gated entry into an open area on the AT.

I suddenly remembered that this was the southernmost tip of the AT section that was part of a 100-mile Figure-8 route that I hiked with DCUL over Thanksgiving 2020.  I was excited to reconnect with the familiar.  If that wasn't enough, there was also trail magic in the form of packaged dessert snacks and V8 Splash bottles.  That really boosted my morale in the rain.  I was also excited that I had hiked 5 miles in 90 minutes. All this excitement gave me great vibes heading into Double Springs Shelter.
At that point, I had hiked just under 24 miles.  There were still showers, but it was lightening up.  It was almost 6, but given that the trail was moving so quickly for me, and that I'd prefer to head into Damascus sooner, I decided to go for the first 30+ mile day of my thru hike to Abingdon Gap Shelter.  It was also cold, and I thought by hiking that I could make some more progress instead of being stuck in a sleeping bag for a couple extra hours.
The trail remained pretty easy - more climbing to a ridge and descending from it.  The showers remained, but were on for a while.  Then the wind picked up, which made the hiking less pleasant.  The showers became rain.  Hypothermic conditions for sure.  I jogged through much of the downhill.  
I finally got to Abingdon Gap Shelter around 8:30.  I set up my tent and ate dinner there, then soon passed out.

It was a relief and I felt a sense of accomplishment to reach Damascus, even though I had not yet hiked 500 miles of the trail.  So much of the town seemed to cater to hikers.  Easy walk into downtown right on the trail.  Lots of places to stay, though some are pricey.  A few outfitter stores.  Multiple restaurants, pubs, and cafes.
After getting more fuel and a start on food resupply at Damascus Outfitters, I ate a late breakfast at the Damascus Diner.  The food was ok, but I had a better experience at Mojo's Cafe the last time I visited.  I stopped at the Broken Fiddle Hostel to shower, do laundry, and I listened to music and chatted a little with Timber, Laid Back, and Pinto while recharging phones.  I walked to the grocery store to have a resupply of food for a few days.
By this time it was early evening.  Already feeling refreshed from the shower and wearing clean clothes, plus lounging around most of the day and eating brunch and snacks, I didn't really feel like spending the night.  I had just stayed at a hostel Wednesday night, and was starting to feel spoiled with all these overnight options. Besides, Grayson Highlands was coming up.  With sporadic showers in the afternoon, I noticed that it was forecasted to be mostly sunny tomorrow, and rainy the following day.  I wanted to camp out at a great spot near Thomas Knob Shelter with good weather - about 30 miles away.

So, I decided to hike out of town in the evening for a few miles.  But not without a big dinner at Wicked Chicken!  The food was awesome.  Ribeye steak, mashed potatoes, roasted asparagus with a tossed salad and lemon blueberry cheesecake.  I would not be hungry the rest of the night.  I hiked in a couple hours to a campsite right off of US 58 and retired just before steady showers started.","Abingdon Gap Shelter

I could feel the extra weight from three to four days of food with a full can of fuel during the climbs today.  After stopping at Lost Mountain Shelter for lunch, I hiked a couple hours to the Buzzard Rock overlook beneath the summit of Whitetop Mountain. By this time it was around 70.  It was rough climbing up at first, but the temperature cooled as I approached 5000 feet.  The overlook, which I had already been to on two previous extended weekend backpacking trips, is fantastic.
After a break, another hour of hiking led me to Elk Garden Parking Lot, where the landscape opened up.  I took another break and briefly encountered My Way.  It is lovely to hike in the open area, but then I had another 1000 feet to climb for a couple hours, mostly through trees, to another open area.
There, I passed by Thomas Knob Shelter and set up my tent in an opening nearby - maybe 0.2 miles ahead.  I did see some views in the open landscapes, but it showered a little before I found my campsite.  Fog creeped in and the wind picked up a bit, and unfortunately, there was no sunset to see.","Campsite near Feathercamp and US 58

I hiked through the wet, muddy trail for most of the day.  I had a lunch break at Old Orchard Shelter, where I met a couple section hikers who had covered everything north on the AT, up through the 100-mile Wilderness.
The terrain got easier and less interesting as I continued further, and I was able to average 2.7 mph to camp.  At 2, there was finally sunlight.  I delighted in the end of my walk for the day, including passing by Comey Falls.

That and the relatively easy terrain got me to the Pat Jennings Visitor Center before noon, about an hour fewer of time than it took for about the same mileage yesterday.  On the way, I ran into Feet, the first barefooter on my hike.

Last night during dinner, I had heard about a cheap bus that stops there and goes to Marion.  However, not having service on my phone the last few days, I glanced at the posted schedule and found that the next one would stop at 2:15.  That was too long for me to wait, and all I really wanted was a meal and a few resupply items that I saw available in Atkins in my guide.
After lunch, I pressed on for the next 11 miles to Atkins.  I knew there would be three hill climbs and then a long descent.  The second climb was pretty steep - maybe a 50% grade and reminded me of the climbs in North Carolina.
On the way, there was an overlook of Walker Mountain and a charming walk through Virginia farm countryside.  In an old schoolhouse, there was some trail magic of chewy candies and drink mixes.
Instead of getting to Atkins around 4, it was more like 5.  I was really hoping one of two restaurants would be open, but both were closed, being a Monday.  Even the gas station advertising pizza slices had none.  Then it began to shower.  While all my faculties were in order, I wished I could have had a hot, prepared meal.
I was disappointed with Atkins, but at least the people there were kind.  At one gas station, a 2011 AT thru hiker, Little Drummer Boy, bought me a bag of trail mix I was intending to get as a form of trail magic.
I ended up going to the nearby Relax Inn, which had no vacancy, and called the Merry Inn, a hostel in Marion.  They had a bunk available and had free pickup and drop off at Atkins, with tips appreciated.  I gladly took it, met the shuttle driver shortly, and headed to Marion.  I was glad to recharge phones, shower, resupply, clean my clothes.  I ate a medium pizza, tossed salad, and chicken taco at Moon Dog Pizza.","Trimpi Shelter

There was a long descent, then my first ford of this hike across Lick Creek, due to a washed out bridge.  The guide said to expect knee deep water, but it was only ankle deep for me, thankfully.  That my first ford is over 560 miles in, and the abundance of hostels, suggests how well established this trail is.
I started the long climb up to Chestnut Knob Shelter around 4:30.  It took me about 2.5 hours to ascend the 2000 feet over 4.5 miles,  but I was glad to see the views on Chestnut Ridge along the way.  I set up my tent, had dinner in the stone shelter while chatting with a bunch of kind hikers there, and enjoyed my five macarons for dessert.
After midnight in bed, a man woke me and said that someone by my name had sent an SOS from my InReach, asking if it was me.  I confirmed and was bewildered!  I had never turned it on, let alone sent an SOS.  I said I was fine, but felt bad for him, as he drove all the way up to Chestnut Knob in the middle of the night.

I think it was a bad idea to keep the InReach in a stuff sack.  From now on, I will keep it attached to a pack strap and isolate it in my tent.  I would hate for that to happen again, not only for the unfortunate SAR volunteer, but also for potential emergency service charges.  Doing it in NH would mean I'd lose most of my savings,  I think!","Atkins/Marion

I wouldn't be warm enough to take off the hat until 10, and the additional top layer until 11:30, when the scattered snow showers stopped.
I had lunch at Jenkins Shelter, where I reunited with some of the people who stayed inside Chestnut Knob Shelter last night, including Meadow and Victory.  They asked my name and if I was the one who sent off the SOS signal.  Apparently the SAR volunteer headed into the shelter first to look for me, a natural choice.  I am still embarrassed by the mistake.
The sun sneaked in every once in a while, but the bitter wind continued on and off all day, lowering the ambient temperatures by 10-20 degrees.  The gusts gradually became a little less forceful.  There were next to no times where it was enjoyable to stop and have a break without wearing a thermal top layer and windbreaker.  But the positive vibes with other hikers today helped keep things happier.
The day did clear up as I made my way towards the bridge crossing US 52. I saw some great overlooks of Bland, VA and even enjoyed overlooks that included the highway.  I leapfrogged with Mike a bit, who I first 4am into yesterday and had leapfrogged with then as well.
The last two miles of the day were climbing up 600 feet - better than yesterday.  I guess I took longer breaks, as the terrain today was not bad at all.
I arrived to Helveys Mill Shelter and found a great spot to make camp for the first time since the day I left Damascus.  I chatted a bit with Bumblebee from Ohio, Puff from Australia, Podcast who is currently living in Maryland, and Lorax from Ft Collins, CO.  Trail Days was a big conversation topic.
Bill -- who owns land close to the shelter and moved here from Fairfax, VA -- stopped by.  He supplies thru hikers with water from the source, which is another 0.3 miles downhill, in addition to the 0.3 miles to get to the shelter from the AT.  He also handed us some handmade, lightweight, small, AT commemorative woodwork medallions, as well as a BelVita breakfast bar.

I turned left and walked a half mile to Trent's Grocery for a nice late snack of a chicken sandwich, tater tots, milk, an apple, and ice cream, plus some resupply food to get me another 80-100 miles.

I ran into My Way again there.  He mentioned something about an emergency at Chestnut Knob Shelter the other day, which I interpreted as a clear reference to my stuff sack button press accident and explained it to him.  Apparently news travels fast and is not always accurate.  I know posting it here will spread it even more, but I mainly just want to tell about the happenings on my hike.
I hiked another six miles in two hours to a footbridge crossing over Dismal Creek.  Even though I wasn't exactly hungry, I decided to take a break.  The easy terrain and repetitive nature of the trail was getting to me for some reason.  I took some time to reflect and ate a few snacks anyway.

I continued for another 40 minutes -- just over 2 miles -- to the turnoff to Wapiti Shelter.  Even though it would be a 24 mile day for me, I felt like my day shouldn't be over at this point.  It was still about an hour before I usually finish, even though my diversion to Trent's Grocery used up an hour.  I also wanted to arrive in Pearisburg early in the afternoon and spend a few hours there.  So, I pressed on for about two more miles, mostly uphill, to a dry campsite near a view through the trees.  I arrived a bit before 8 and saw another 4-5 tents/hammocks in the area.  I set up mine away from them, enjoyed the nearly full moon during dinner, and retired.","Helveys Mill Shelter

So, still pretty easy terrain. 
 Along the way, I met North Star.  After another 2 hours mostly downward, I took in more overlooks, including one at Angel's Rest and made it to Cross Avenue.
I had read in the AT AWOL Guide that the Angel's Rest Hostel in Pearisburg, about 0.7 miles to the east, did free pickups and drop offs for those staying overnight or doing a day use.  So I called they got me, and Mischief checked me in.
Once there, I took a shower and started laundry.  I noticed that I looked a little emaciated after getting out of the shower, despite eating so much food on trail and in town.

I followed a brief trail to the supermarket and restaurants.  I ate lunch at La Barranca Mexican Grill, where of course they had Cinco de Mayo specials.  I ordered way too much to eat and ended up having a whole plate of food boxed up.
After finishing up my resupply at the Food Lion, I decided to tent there, and had some of my leftovers for dinner.  Hot Tamale, another member of the crew, took my picture in front of their office.
I met Tenacious, PW (Peaceful Warrior), Granny Gear, Feisty, Squirrel, among others.  PW used the hostel guitar and played a group of us a bunch of songs.  Some about the AT, a Scottish song, and a Mexican love song.  Fitting because he is part Scottish and part Mexican.  All good fun.

Then I hanged out with a later night group by the fire and enjoyed the full moon.  By the campfire, one person said he works as a boat captain, and there was discussion about that.  Eventually the conversation led to our bodies on trail.  One person commented that at the end, all the women look like supermodels, and all the men look like Holocaust survivors!","Campsite beyond Wapiti Shelter near View

While checking out, I ran into Seinfeld, who was checking in.  I ran into him the other day at an overlook prior to the US 52 crossing, but didn't know his name.  Jolly Rancher drove me back to the Cross Avenue/Angel's Rest Trailhead.  I munched on an M&M cookie ice cream sandwich as I got started around 8:45.  Boy, does that sound good right now.
It was going to be a sunny, warm day.  I made my way down over the bridge to the underpass and climbed past the Pearlis cemetery to the Rice Fuel Shelter at 11:45, where there was an overlook.  I took my first extended break there, even though I had a big breakfast, started late, and it wasn't quite lunchtime.
The weather continued to warm.  The trail was starting to get rocky, which slowed my pace.  At another overlook, I saw a family of goats resting under the shade of a tree.  The shadows from the flights of buzzards swooped over me a few times as I hiked.  There was another climb while on the ridge, which I didn't like doing in the heat, but at last it was done.

After a late lunch break at the Allegheny Trail junction around 3:45, I eventually descended to rushing creeks and streams in Stony Valley.  I reached Pine Swamp Branch Shelter, but at 5ish, it seemed a little to early when the next shelter was about four miles away. The first three miles were ups and downs to avoid Stony Creek, and I heard a bunch of gunshots from a residence as I crossed a bridge over Stony Creek.  There was one more climb, but I had initially saw the rise around 400 feet over a mile.
Unfortunately, I failed to correctly identify the trough in the elevation profile.  The climb was actually about 1100 feet. Hot, thirsty and tired, going up every tenth of a mile was agonizing, even though I stopped for a short break twice.

We introduced ourselves, and I headed out a while after him.
The elevation profile showed that the first few miles of the day were more or less flat, but that was misleading.  The trail meandered up and down,  requiring sidehilling and with a slew of rocks on what would otherwise be a footpath.  I think I tripped a couple times.
Around 9:30, I reached VA 613 - about 4 miles.  To my great pleasure I saw I big trail magic table set up!  With the lack of it in VA so far, I was especially grateful that it was there.  A couple from South Carolina who planned to hike the Virginia triple crown, Boost and Cloud Kicker, brought chicken, pinto beans, flour tortillas, and fixins for tacos.  There were also boxes of Kind and fruit bars, and tangerines, and water.  There were coolers with pop, Gatorade, and beer.  They even had homemade brownies, guacamole, salsa, and chips!  It was a such a morale boost compared to the BelVita bar I was going to have.  Other hikers congregated there.  I met F*** It, a Frenchman, who had camped under the bridge, and ran into Pink Flops again, who I saw at the Angel's Rest hostel, as well as Squirrel, Plunger, and others.  I ate and drank my fill, and enjoyed the conversation.
I didn't really want to leave, but I finally did a bit past 10 with Plunger.  The rocky terrain had given way to a gentle rolling terrain on a footpath.  We hiked together for the better part of an hour.  I learned that he is from Utah, and is a truck driver but also does tourism gigs.  He has loved in Juneau and kayakers between islands there, including one with the greatest population density of brown bears.  He has been to every state except for Maine and Rhode Island, which he will be rectifying in the next few months.  I mentioned my trip backpacking the Uinta Highline Trail last summer and plans to revisit Vernal, see the Flaming Gorge reservoir, and Dinosaur National Monument.  He had been to all of the latter three, and gave me some recommendations.
After a while we split up, but leapfrogged a bit with him.  I met Rice Bag while passing through the War Spur Shelter at noon to get water and also ran into Plunger again.
Eventually I made it to the first climb at VA 632 around 12:30.  To my pleasant surprise, it started to shower around 1.  I enjoyed climbing while being cooled off.  It was a long climb, and there was some lightning as I was ascending.  Around 1:30, I was on the ridge.  The showers turned briefly to rain, prompting me to put on my rain jacket.  As soon as I did, the precipitation and lightning stopped.  I continued to walk in it nonetheless.  I went to the viewpoint at Kelly Knob.  There was no view to see in the fog, but I saw a couple buzzards hanging out on the rocks.
Then I descended to a pasture.  As I did, the sky cleared up and the sun came out.  The walk through the pasture was beautiful.  It was so pleasant, and even dry, that I took my second extended break there, around 3:30.  Plunger and F*** It passed me.  I continued through more of the pastures.

Once they ended, I passed over Sinking Creek, and by Keffer Oak, a tree that is more than 300 years old, the second oldest tree on the AT.  The second big climb for the day came up.  I ascended Sinking Creek Mountain and hiked along the ridge for a while.  I passed by a power line view and what looked like stone mounds for burials.  I ran into Plunger again, and we more or less walked together to the Sarver Hollow Shelter junction, getting there around 6.  Plunger, who had an extra mile and had to hike up that 1100 foot climb first thing in the morning, was done for the day.  I wanted to continue on, and had no desire to walk half a mile downhill to get water.  Plunger and I bade farewell.The terrain was rocky and slanted for the first hour or so past the junction, and also quite scenic.  There were many views of a long-spanding mountain across a valley that I enjoyed.  After I reached the Eastern Continental Divide around 7:15, the trail moved downward pretty directly.  I reached the Niday Shelter area around 8:30, had dinner, and retired after a couple chores.","Bailey Gap Shelter
",Niday Shelter,"May 07, Sun",27.20
Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663541,"I started hiking at 7:30.  It was already kind of warm.  I knew it would be a long day, as I wanted to stop at a nearby convenience store and stage myself for the McAfee Knob sunrise.
A brief descent led me to another washed out bridge, so I had to ford Craig Creek.  The climb up Brush Mountain wasn't too bad; just moderate and long.  A bench was conveniently placed at a point where the worst of the climb was over, and I took a brief break around 9:20.  I stopped by the Audie Murphy memorial, then made my way down to Trout Creek around 11:45.  I had an extended break there.
After getting more water, I started the climb up Cove Mountain and Dragon's Tooth.  It was long, moderate, and rocky.  It was also warm.  A misleading mileage sign discouraged me.  Dragon's Tooth was shown to be 4 miles from Trout Creek.  It was more like 5.5 miles, according to this year's AT AWOL Guide.  There were frequent dips downward, and it was annoying to have to make up the climbing elevation.
At last, I reached Dragon's Tooth junction around 3.  I drank some water, ate a few handfuls of chips, and climbed up to the overlook.  It was beautiful, even if it was not sunrise; of the five times before this that I've been there, four of them were to see the sunrise.

The descent down to Lost Spectacles Gap I remember well: steep and rocky.  I took my time descending, as usual.  The rhododendrons had blooms as I made my way down to state road 624, a delight to see.  Normally, I'm backpacking this area in the winter to avoid the crowds.   Not an issue on a Monday.
When I got to 624 around 3:50, I made my way to the nearby convenience store, got a small resupply, and had three courses of food: pizza slice, milk, kombucha, and a creamsicle; pinto beans and cornbread; vitamin drink, banana, and BBQ sandwich.  All were delicious and satisfying.  I chatted with some other thru hikers who were staying at the nearby Four Pines Hostel.  Not for me, as I would press on to camp for sunrise photo ops tomorrow.
I left at 5.  Everything from there to the shelter I had done on a previous backpacking trip:  a brief climb and descent, water gathering, a walk through a pasture, more climbs up and down with ridge walking, descent to VA 311, then some ups and downs to the second shelter from the state highway.  By then it was almost 9, after close to 8 miles.

I was still pretty full from my late afternoon meal, so I just boiled some water to drink with chocolate and chips. I heard a rustle in the bushes and a growl.  Figuring it was probably a bear that smelled my food, I started talking and stood up.  There was another rustle, but then I didn't hear anything else.  I put all my smellables in my Ursack, and did the two double knots, as usual.  I tied it to a tree and went to bed.
I had no more issues from the bear, but an annoying whippoorwill sang its obnoxious song all night.  Given that I had set my alarm for 4 the next morning, I was already having trouble falling asleep.","Niday Shelter

Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663542,"I got up with my alarm at 4.  It was easily the second worst night for me on the thru hike so far, after having to sleep in the actual shelter at Davenport Gap Shelter, close to the northern Smokies boundary.  I always set up my tent at shelters, except for that one time when tenting was unavailable.
Sunrise time was 6:17 at McAfee Knob.  I left at 5:17 to give myself ample time for the climb up a bit under 2 miles.  Again, I am already familiar with this section of the AT, up through Lambert's Meadow Shelter.  Easy and PF beat me to the top.  I got there around 6.
I have seen sunrise on McAfee Knob twice, previously.  It was amazing both times, and was also amazing this time.  The sun came up and it was like the heavens lit up.  I took many photos while enjoying Carnation instant breakfast and a BelVita bar.
I left around 6:45, and stopped by the Campbell Shelter for water and the facilities, then hiked a little over 2 hours to get to another great overlook area, Tinker Cliffs.  I took another extended break there, then enjoyed walking along the cliffs.
I started the descent down to Scorched Earth Gap, then continued on mostly easy terrain, for a couple hours, with occasional overlooks of the greater Roanoke area. Light showers cooled me for an hour or so.
To my dismay, there were several climbs and ridge walks on slanted rocks, though also nice overlooks of a river running through mountains. I just wanted to descend to US 220, where I could eat, relax in a motel, and do gear and resupply errands. I was exasperated that I would have to take the last several miles of the 10.5 mile descent from Tinker Cliffs seriously.  It didn't help that the showers stopped and the temperatures were scorching.
I finally made it to US 220 just before 3.  I checked into the Super 8, showered, picked up a box with my second pair of hiking shoes - though my current pair could have taken me another 130 miles to Waynesboro or even beyond that through Shenandoah National Park.  I dined at Three Lil Pigs, which was delicious and had surprisingly healthy side dish options.  As a thru hiker, they gave me a free dish of banana cream pudding.  Wow, what an amazing meal.
After more resupplying tasks, I hanged out in my room, did laundry, and tried to catch up on news and photo uploads.  It felt so good to just chill and eat.","Catawba Mountain Shelter

I'd forgotten that I was running low on Vaseline yesterday.  As it warms up, I need to cover more body surface area; lately, my armpits were being affected by chafing.  I got some anti-chafing glide and ointment at the grocery store.
For this reason, I didn't start hiking until about 9:40.  Fortunately,  the stretch I hiked today wasn't tough, and had some pretty good views.  I hiked about 8 miles in three hours and had an extended break.  Along the way, I met Hot Lips and Caveman, who I think also had a room at the Super 8.  I leapfrogged with them and Mountain Man over our asynchronous breaks during the warm, sunny day.
I made it to my first intersection with the Blue Ridge Parkway around 4, where I chatted with a couple touring from the New York metro area.  They didn't know they were near the AT!  It's my whole life now, so I was shocked.
I pressed on and decided to dry camp st the Cove Mountain Shelter.  Around 6, I schlepped up three liters of water from Bearwallow Gap.  I saw views of the sunset painting the sky and surrounding mountains as I descended Cove Mountain to the shelter.  I don't think there was anyone there, but I feel a sense of peaceful solitude when I camp alone.  I tented, had dinner, and fell asleep.","Daleville

Today was a punishing day.  It was toasty with four long, rugged climbs with little to no views.
I started hiking around 7:00 and descended to Jennings Creek.   The first climb up to Fork Mountain wasn't bad - about 1000 feet of climbing over a mile and change.  This was all before 9, while the temperature was still cool.  I had a breakfast break at the top, which was treed in.
After descending past a shelter, the next climb was up Floyd Mountain, about 2300 feet over 4 miles and change.  By this time, the sun was roasting me.  I got to a campsite about 3/4 of the way up the climb and took an extended lunch break aroun 11:20.  There was a spring spur trail there, but it ended up not being worth the time - if someone was in a dire situation, it would be worth the walk.  Three bees annoyed me during my lunch break, even after I moved 20 feet away.
I ran into a few hikers the rest of the way up. There was a faint view through trees while descending to the next shelter.  The next climb was 1200 feet over 4 miles to Apple Orchsrd Mountain.
On my way up, there was a good view -- and only decent view for the day -- from the Black Rock overlook.  There, I met Hiram Hikes, an elderly gentleman from Maine who was recording there - maybe he's a YouTuber. He started in January, never took a zero, and hates the heat.  My kind of guy!  He had some weight balancers attached to his pack straps that made it easier for him to keep his back straight while hiking.  They hold water bottles, his snacks, and frequently used gear.  He said he got them from a place in New Zealand.  I'd like to get a pair of those.
I got to the summit of Apple Orchard Mountain around 2:30.  It had one of the lamest views I had ever seen from a 4000+ foot mountain that had advertised views.  I took a break at the next shelter and descended to Petite Gap, around 5:30.
By this time my butt felt pretty whipped.  I took a short break there to mentally prepare for yet another climb and refuel a little.  I took one last 700-foot climb up Highcock Knob - no view, then descended to the Marble Spring area, where I set up camp next to a few others.","Cove Mountain Shelter

Today was a fulfilling day.  While there were still a number of big climbs, there were also plenty of views and water to satisfy me.
I left at 7 again.  I saw some more views of surrounding mountains as I descended to James River.  About 6 miles in, I took a breakfast and water break at Matt's Creek Shelter around 9:00.  I crossed the James River footbridge around 10:00.  From there, I had an 1800-foot climb to a junction with the Little Rocky Row Trail, getting there  On the way, I met Soundbite and Good.
I took an extended lunch break at noon, then descended about 100 feet and ascended 600 feet to Big Rocky Row.  Great views on the climbs, thankfully.  Then came a descent to Saltlog Gap and an 800-foot ascent to Bluff Mountain, around 2:30.
There was a memorial there for Ottie Powell, who died from a fire tower accident.  The remnants of the fire tower are still there.   I took a much needed water break - it was pretty hot.  A new face, Tracy, was hanging out there, and I also met Whitman, Billy Goat, and Danny Boy, who were part of a tramily with Soundbite and Good, I think.  I ran into the two of them again, too.
I was basically all out of water, but in a couple miles, there was a plentiful water source near the Punchbowl Mountain overlook.  I descended there, and to my great delight, I saw someone there with trail magic!  He had two coolers full of water, Gatorade, and soda - just what I needed.  I spent at least 45 minutes there rehydrating and chatting with trail angel Jason, as well as Chattahoochee, from Charlotte, and Ricola, from Belgium.
Jason, aka Dredd, who thru hiked the AT in '99.  I asked if there were fewer hostels and towns to rely on back then.  He said, as far as the hostels were concerned, the newer ones are in the north.  He lives in Harrisonburg and is wrapping up graduate studies in history at James Madison University.  He is in a program to become a park ranger, and said we might see him again at the I-70 junction if he heads to Antietam for a position there.
I headed out, got some water, and soon passed the 800-mile marker around 4:30, where I ran into many of the same hikers again.  Ricola and I hiked together for a bit.  We talked about my Colorado Trail thru hike, which he is interested in doing.  European treks also came up, and he has done a number of them.  He recommended one referred to as the Alpine Crossing, which goes the parts of Germany, Austria, and ends in Italy.  Sounds like fun!
I descended to Reservoir Road around 6:00 I think. Many hikers wanted to stop there, but I had an itch to keep going to the shelter, preferably for a privy - another five miles.  The trail skirted a reservoir before heading up the Brown Mountain Creek.  I got to the shelter area and set up my tent around 7:30 or so.  Tracy arrived shortly thereafter, and after some dinner, I headed for bed after a long, satisfying day.","Campsite near Marble Spring

Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664110,"I headed out around 7 again.  To start the day, there was a long, 2700 ft climb up to Bald Knob, over 4.6 miles.  Note: Bald Knob is not a bald.  I was drenched in sweat when I reached the top of Bald Knob, even though it was overcast with a breeze.  After that, it was mostly rolling terrain or downhill.  There were three more steeper climbs for the day, but they all involved no more than 800 feet.
I am pretty familiar with the AT between US 60 and Rockfish Gap.  I have backpacked and dayhiked different  sections and loops near that area several times.  But this area, like the last two days, had pretty rugged terrain.
There was about a mile of hiking in an open area in between Cow Camp Gap and Hog Camp Gap that opens up.  It was cloudy,  but I was still able to get decent views.  After a break at 11 near Hog Camp Gap to get water that took much too long, I climbed up to Tar Jacket Ridge to see more views.
I decided to camp near Priest Mountain overlook just south of the summit, so that I could enjoy the sunrise.  At 2:30, I gathered four liters of water at a brook just past the Seeley Woodworth Shelter junction, given that I had eight miles to hike from there, with an 800 foot climb at the end.
I decided to enjoy the views at Spy Rock for my next extended break, at 3:30. They were great - I have been there a few times, and always recommend the extra 0.4-mile round trip to see it when it is not raining or foggy.  The view was clear,  but it was cloudy, and the clouds were dark.  I decided to press on.  Just after 5, it started raining on and off.  After 40 minutes of that, it was steady.  I put on my rain jacket and continued my way to the overlook, found a spot to camp around 6:30, when the rain stopped.  I cooked dinner in my tent vestibule and retired.","Brown Mountain Creek Shelter

Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664111,"The Priest Mountain overlook near the outcropping of rocks faces west, so there was no reason to expect a fantastic  sunrise view.  Yet, because of the rain the night before, waves of clouds appeared in front of the surrounding mountains and gave an impressive view against a blue, pink and yellow sky.
I got moving at 7 again, heading down the Priest summit.  I had climbed up it southbound many times, with this time being the first descent northbound.  I had hoped I could get down there quickly.  But, the descent still had many rocks.  It was rugged enough to require over 90 minutes of descending for me.
Once I got to the Tye River, I had a 3000 feet climb up Three Ridged Mountain, over six miles.  On my way up, I ran I to a few day hikers and other thru hikers.  One was a blind woman.  I am impressed that someone who is not able to navigate using vision or enjoy views has the desire and skill to hike the 2200-mile trail.
I took one extended break around 10:30 at the first viewpoint, and got to Maupin Field Shelter for a privy break around 1:15.
I got to Reid's Gap at 2:15, where I was delighted to see a trail magic table under a canopy! Rainbow, who thru hiked the AT last year, had hot dogs, mini candy bars, bags of chips, fruit, filtered water, carbonated refreshments, and Double Stuf Oreos.  What a spread! I spent a good 45 minutes there.
She lives nearby, and does work for an AT conservation nonprofit.  I chatted with her, Pottery Doug - another trail angel, Ripper, and Hot Sauce.  Hot Sauce, who is from Philadelphia, makes his own sauces from scratch.  He offered to send out hot sauces to people he meets on the trail, if they request it.  I just might take him up on his offer!
Despite all this great food, I had heard great things about the support that Devil's Backbone Brewery and Basecamp provides for thru hikers.  I had read about shuttles to and from Reid's Gap, free camping, and an awesome breakfast that only costs $5.  It is 5 miles east on VA 664, right off of Reid's Gap, where that highway and the BRP intersect with the AT.  I also had said that I had no more dinners left, and a big meal there should help for the night.
Ripper was leaving with Pottery Dan, as he was going to drive him to a hostel a couple miles west on the BRP.  But before he did that, he gave me three of his backpacking meals!  I was pleasantly surprised.  I wish I would have remembered  to give him some money for them.  I graciously thanked him.
Around 3, I set off for Devil's Backbone.  I walked for over an hour and no one stopped to give me a lift.  At least it was sll downhill.  After I was close to accepting that I'd have to walk the whole way, a van stopped.  It was Pottery Doug, with Ripper in tow!  He gave me a ride the rest of the way there - what a great guy.  I hope I can have an ounce of the heart of gold he has.
Ripper and I went to the brewery, and had our big meal.  Ripper told me about retiring at 30, and his treks and surfing along the Pacific Coast from Mexico all the way go South America.  He wants to go to southeast Asia next.  Sounds amazing - maybe Bali.
After exploring and using their wifi a bit, I asked about shuttles.  An employee there said they don't  really run them regularly anymore, and they also don't offer the breakfast.  I guess what I had read was pre-pandemic services, when they got a lot more revenue from hikers.  She said someone could do a shuttle back when they start their shift at 11 tomorrow.  Better than nothing, but very late and presumably hot for what would be a 19 mile hike to Rockfish Gap,  where I hoped to get a shuttle to Waynesboro to resupply and rest at a hostel.  She said she could drop me back off in a half hour when her shift ended, so I went with that instead.  Ripper was happy staying the night there and taking one more day on the trail to get into town early.
I started back at Reid's Gap at 7.  I ended up hiking until 9:30, where I found a dry campsite near a blue blazed trail up to a rock that had no view, about a mile and a half south of the Humpback Mountain summit. I was in time to see views of the sunset at the overlooks, but hiked in the dark for a good hour.","Campsite near Priest Mountain Overlook

Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664112,"I started hiking at 8.  It was overcast and cool.  I kept my jacket on most of the day.  I arrived to Humpback Rocks and took a brief break at 9:30.  It was mostly easy hiking as far as the elevation profile was concerned.  Yet, I was a little agitated about small climbs and rocks when I'm  usually not.  Maybe I need to eat more often.  Or maybe I need to relax more sometimes.
At any rate, I made it to Paul C. Wolfe Shelter around 11 and had an extended break, even though it would just be a 13 mile day for me.  I felt better and finished my hiking for the day at Rockfish Gap around 1:30.
But logistics for getting to Waynesboro to resupply were an issue.  I had accidentally dropped a sack containing my phone with service.  It did not have a protective case, and the screen display was damaged.  I had hoped to call a hostel for a ride from the visitor center, but it was closed on Monday.
I was a bit desperate, and started asking people near an overlook if they were heading to Waynesboro.  No one said they were.  I offered someone $20 to get there.  She and her boyfriend were nervous about taking me directly, but she requested an Uber for me.  I gave her the money, and they left.  While I was waiting, one of the other people I asked, Jerry from Nellysford, came by again and offered me a ride.  I wasn't sure about the Uber, so I just accepted it and got to Waynesboro around 2:30. Phew!  He did not accept payment or gas offer from me.
I had a big meal at the River Burger Bar, and it was delicious.  Veggie spring roll with sweet, spicy chili sauce, a burger with pimento cheese, bacon, arugula, and standard fixings, a side salad, and a slice of cookies and cream pie.  I was not stuffed, but was satisfied.
I checked in to the Stanimal Hostel, meeting caretakers Bugs and Frogger.  I showered, did laundry, and resupplied.  Frogger lent me his phone so that I could call customer service transfer my old, damaged phone to my new one.  He didn't demand anything in return, but I offered.  I got him a pepperoni pizza for helping me out.  Dinner was chicken marsala with two garlic dinner rolls, a side salad, a veggie snack pack, most of a mixed fresh fruit pack, and a chocolate peanut butter milkshake.  How do I not get stuffed from all that?  Maybe I don't eat enough, or have developed too much of an appetite.
Then I hanged out in the hostel before heading to bed.  Sometime past 11, Bugs asked if anyone was interested in hitting a piñata.  A guest, Skittles, was having a birthday gathering.  A piñata in the shape of a rainbow was there.  No one could break it, so people ended up ripping it up on the ground.  A bunch of chewy candies, hard candies, and Skittles fell to the ground.  Shameless as we were - especially me - we picked up the candies from the ground and ate them.

Frogger made everyone pancakes, some with Reese's peanut butter chips!  They were delicious, and were a great addition to the yogurt and fruit I planned to eat for breakfast.
Charlie, a 2019 AT thru hiker and veteran from Maine, showed up to offer people shuttle rides.  He generously offered to take me back to Rockfish Gap as the only passenger around 7.  There was an inch of evening rain in the forecast,  and I think a number of people opted for a zero day.
I started hiking around 7:30. I filled out my Shenandoah National Park permit.  It required specific zones where I would be camping each night.  I couldn't decide on where I might end on certain days, so I guessed.
It was overcast and there was scattered drizzle.  I still saw some views., and the sun came out around 10.  I took an extended break at a marked spring a mile or two past the first shelter around 11. Compared with the rugged section between Jennings Creek and Reid's Gap, this stretched seemed pretty tame.  There were some steep descents and limited, moderate climbs.  I had a late lunch around 2:40 near a RipRap trail marker, and arrived to Blackrock Hut to set up my tent around 4:30.
It felt weird to get to camp so early.  I wanted to try to get some good sunrise shots on Blackrock  tomorrow morning.  I was also concerned about the camping between here and the next shelter 12 miles away, given the past bear activity.
I joined a group and, along with other things, we discussed logistics on hitting the Loft Mountain Wayside tomorrow.  The AT guide and Farout app were both unclear about its operating hours.  They said it should be open by 9.  I figure I'll get there tomorrow at 10.","Rockfish Gap/Waynesboro

Finally, I had a satisfying pink orb to enjoy that was not obscured by clouds, as it was at McAfee Knob, or hidden too much by trees at the Priest Mountain overlook.
I was firmly in familiar territory.  I had been on various points in Shenandoah along the AT at least 20 times.  Today, as well as the next couple days, would be walks along a memory lane.  The last time I was at Blackrock was less than two years ago, also for sunrise.
I made my way down, then on rolling terrain until I got to the Ivy Creek Spring path to the Loft Mountain Wayside around 9:45.  I had taken the shorter path to the wayside via the Frazier Discovery Trail on that same trip less than two years ago, and remember it being a steep descent there.  Supposedly this path was flatter, according to the guide.  And indeed, it was: easy downhill and a gentle climb when I returned to the AT from the wayside, and a spring just a couple hundred yards before reconnecting to the AT.
I got to the wayside at 10.  The grill didn't open until 11.  No matter, I'd just hang out for an hour.  In the meantime, I recharged my phone.  I chatted with a few hikers and ate some snacks at the store, which opened at 9.  Once the grill opened, I had a BBQ pulled pork sandwich with chips, and a scoop of blackberry ice cream.  Delicious!  I ended up staying there until about noon.
I headed back and continued through memory lane past Pinefield Hut, where I stayed overnight during a winter backpacking trip in December 2020.  That was around 1.  Then more rolling terrain down to gaps and up small mountains.  I took a break at an overlook of Powell Gap Hollow around 3.  I saw Bear and Rocket there, who I saw at the Blackrock Hut during dinner and at the wayside today.
I had some issues with my left ankle yesterday, so I didn't want to hike too far today.  I slept with both of my legs slightly elevated last night, and haven't had any issues yet.  Still, I decided to just go for 21ish miles today, to Hightop Hit.
So, another couple descents to gaps, then just under 600 feet of climbing to Hightop Hut, where I arrived a little before 5.  Dex and Fan Fave were there, who were also at the Blackrock Hut yesterday, as well as Bear and Rocket.  Later, Flowers, Steve, and Yogi arrived.  There were various discussions of getting to the Big Meadows Wayside tomorrow, plus ideas on new kinds of food to try on trail for dinner, other than freeze dried dinner, Ramen, and other pasta packs.  I liked Flowers' El Paso rice dish and might try carrying some avocado, too.

Right before I reached my planned overlook, I ran into a day hiker who gave me a clementine and Cherry Vanilla Coke! She said she was specifically saving it for a thru hiker - very thoughtful of her.  I enjoyed that and more during an extended lunch break at the overlook.
I was moving right along.  While there were plenty of pretty views to take a brief pause at, outside of Bearfence, there was nothing major to look at.  I ended up making it to the wayside around 2:15.  I stayed there for a bit over an hour.  I got some snacks, a bit of fudge, and a couple freeze dried meals.
If I really wanted to, I could just skip Front Royal and continue less than 60 miles to Harpers Ferry, as I had enough food for it.  But, I also wanted to relax a bit, upload pics and finally add all the trail journal entries I'm behind on, charge my phone to 100% so I don't have to use my backup power, get some fruit and vegetables to carry, and I need more toothpaste too.
I also ate at the restaurant there. I had a two piece honey butter chicken meal with a buttermilk biscuit, collard greens, and mac & cheese.  It was awesome. Sadly, they're milkshake machine was not working, so I had a scoop of blackberry ice cream, just like yesterday.  Yes, I can hear the violins playing in the background.. I have it so bad.
I saw Dex, Fan Fave, and Rocket while I was getting/having a post lunch snack of chips and a chocolate pretzel.  While I was eating it, I met a guy calling himself Haiku-san, who I think said he is a section hiker.  He said he likes to write a haiku in the AT shelter logs.
I left and passed by Flowers and Steve on the way out, around 3:45.  After more pretty easy rolling terrain and some nice overlooks, I got to Rock Spring Hut at 5:30.
I relaxed after setting up my tent and caught up on two more journal entries- yesterday's and last Friday's.  Then I went down to the shelter to boil some water and have a few snacks.  I met K who I also ran into on the way up to the wayside.  He is named after a character from Kafka's The Trial, with whom he identified.  He started in March and had a few rough patches of weather.  He said that on one day, it rained, and then got down to single digits overnight.  And this was in Georgia!  I'm glad I wasn't around for that.  He mentioned Skyland Restaurant near the StonyMan Mountain Trailhead for tomorrow.  I'm glad he mentioned it, as it's not in the guide. I have an ambitious day planned tomorrow, but maybe I can stop in for yet another meal.  Maybe to go?
There was also a group of section hikers from the DC area in the shelter, who were hiking southbound to Swift Run Gap.  We chatted about foraging and identifying common edible plants, like chicken of the woods.  One said he planned to write a book on it.  I would want to read up on it or even take a short class on foraging before I tried it.
I mentioned Haiku-san and wondered if he had put a haiku in the shelter trail log.  We leafed through it, and I found a three line entry: first line 5 syllables, second line 7 syllables, but third line was just 3.  I took a picture of it anyway.  Maybe it was his?","Hightop Hut

Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664312,"I had a rough time trying to sleep.  I didn't choose a very flat site to pitch.  Sleeping slanted can be difficult, but I think I was a little wound up too.  I had planned a long day for today, and wanted to wake up at 4:30 again, which I thought would still get me to my planned camp at a reasonable hour.  However, the discomfort at an angle, alarm anticipation, and sounds from an airline, nearby Skyline Drive traffic, and a train all added to a night of next to no rest.  I turned off my alarm and finally dozed off at 3:30.
I ended up waking up at 5:30, and started hiking just before 7.  It was a little foggy, but seemed to be clearing up a little.  I stopped by the Skyland Dining Area, which is a short walk from the trail, around 8:15.  I enjoyed an excellent breakfast buffet: oatmeal with fixings, two types of scrambled eggs, home fries, biscuits and gravy, sausage, and bacon.  Fruit, granola and yogurt, cereal and milk, and an assortment of pastries.  Plus whatever beverages you wanted.  I also got free Wi-Fi and could charge my phone.  I spent over an hour there, and would love to return.  An all-you-can-eat breakfast buffet would be great every 100 miles or so.  I saw K living it up there too.
I left around 9:30.  It was cold and foggy again.  I skipped Stony Man Mountain, a mile off trail, because the long day, and because of the fog.  By the time I got to the cliffs of Little Stony Man around 10, it had cleared up a little.  Views on and off through wandering fog.  It was my first time, of several times, seeing Little Stony Man in not so great weather.
I passed by a few trails I had hiked in the past on previous day hikes and backpacking trips:  Nicholson Hollow, Corbin Cabin, etc.  By this time, it had cleared up.  Around noon, I was excited to see the fantastic views again at the Pinnacle, the highest point on the AT in Shenandoah.
I also saw the overlook at Mary's Rock at 12:45, once again.  It's a great overlook with a fun little climb on some rocks, but when I got there, a good 20 people were already there.  I just took a picture and left.  I got my way down to Thornton Gap and made it to the Pass Mountain Hut junction around 2, where I had lunch.
I had about 8 miles to go to Elkwallow Wayside before they closed at 5.  (This year's AT guide incorrectly lists the hours as 9-7.)  I left at 2:30.  The terrain, like most of the AT through Shenandoah, wasn't that bad.  There were a couple mild climbs.  I jogged on some of the downhill, and was annoyed by the final climb past the Jeremy's Run junction up to Skyline Drive.
I finally made it to the wayside around 4:55. Gasp!  So close.  To my great pleasure, their milkshake machine was working, so I got my first blackberry milkshake!  I also got a chicken sandwich with fixings, including bacon jam, their homemade chips, and various snacks.  I stayed there for about an hour, leaving again around 6.
I just had about 6 miles left to hike to Gravel Springs Hut.  I figured that would be easy to do by 8 and still set up my tent in twilight.  And indeed, it would have been, but there was a wrench thrown into the mix.
I arrived to Rattlesnake Point Overlook around 6:50.  After a quick photo, I crossed the road to enter the trail.  To my surprise and disappointment, there was orange tape attached to two trees, along with a sign that said that the trail was closed due to a search in progress.  I had not heard of any search from any of the hikers.  I checked ATCamp for trail closures, but found nothing.  I also checked the SNP website and looked through their alerts and notifications, and found nothing recent on that page, and certainly nothing about a closure due to a search.
I figured that the closure and search was over, and that the rangers hadn't  gotten around to removing tape from this trailhead.  I continued on for a stretch.
Then, I reached the Hogback parking lot, where I had to go around orange tape again.  As I approached the parking lot, I saw a group of rangers chatting.  I knew I was in trouble.  I walked over to one of them.  She pointed to a car and asked if it was mine.  I said it was not, and that I was thru hiking.  She asked why I had walked through an area where there was a search in progress.  I responded with the same logic as I had in the previous paragraph.  She was not pleased. She asked for my permit and identification, which I gave to her.  She asked me if I had seen signs posted of a missing person.  After thinking about it, I had remembered seeing one or two.  She asked if I had seen him, but all I remembered was a missing person sign, and didn't get a good look at the photo or any of the other details.  She was not pleased.  She told me that I should not pass through any more areas that are taped off, and walk along Skyline Drive instead.  She asked me where I planned to camp.  I responded with Gravel Springs Hut.  She chatted with someone on a walkie-talkie, and told me that area was open.  She told me to have a good night.  I consider myself pretty darn lucky.
After that, I figured it would be a darn good idea to learn more about this missing person.  The name is Mateo Luis Cabo Zevallos, age 21, of Oakton, VA and student at George Mason University.  He had been missing since early May near the Overall Run area, and a bunch of trails near that area were closed.
By this time, it was about 8.  The rest of the hike was easy.  I made it to the hut around 9, set up my tent, had some snacks, and fell asleep.
I have since learned after a few more days have passed that the search was suspended.  Sadly, his remains were found about a mile and a half from where his car was parked.  My deepest condolences to his family and friends.","Rock Spring Hut
",Gravel Springs Hut,"May 19, Fri",28.40
Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664314,"Pretty lazy, uneventful day.  Warm and pleasant while I was hiking.
I got a solid seven hours of sleep after a long day on two hours of sleep.  I had little choice where to camp last night, and again had a slanted spot.  So, I guess sleeping at an angle isn't the major factor when falling asleep.
I left at 8. I took a breakfast break around 9 before climbing North Marshall Mountain.  I climbed that peak a couple times on day hikes - there is a decent view on top.  
After descending to Jenkins Gap, next was Compton Peak- that was new for me.  The summit is right on the AT.  I went 0.2 miles  rockone of the viewpoints.  More descent and rock than I preferred for a view, but it was OK.  I got to Compton Gap around 11 then made my way out of Shenandoah.  I took a pit stop at the Tom Floyd Shelter, and passed by a lovely view of the countryside that was fenced off.  I got to US 522 at about 1:20.
I saw that I needed 50 cents for the trolley heading to downtown Front Royal at 2:20, so I went to the very close Mountain Home Hostel to get change.  Lisa, who answered, said she was picking up some people there at Spelunkers.  She offered a free ride, which I gratefully accepted. She also refilled my water and let me look through their hiker box.  What service!
I got to Spelunker's around 1:50. I had a large spicy chicken sandwich, fries, and a chocolate peanut butter M&M custard!  So bad but sooo good.
I resupplied at the nearby Martin's grocery store and picked up some fruit and veggies to eat outside.  Around 3:30, it started raining.
Across the parking lot was an urgent care center.  Over the past few days, I'd been having issues with bloating and increasing regularity, and wasn't sure if it was related to a stomach bug or giardia.  I backpacked with a guy -- strong, experienced backpacker -- who was thru hiking the PCT and ended up with a case of giardia after getting infected with it at a hostel, about 800 miles in NOBO.  He ended losing a lot of weight and had to go to an ER.  Given the convenient access to healthcare here, I hoped to avoid that fate.  I checked in and waited for an hour, but I used that time to recharge my phone, upload photos and add more trail journal entries.
I saw a PA who said that taking antibiotics for giardia could make things worse for me if I just had a stomach bug, or had drunk some otherwise bad water.  She gave me a giardia testing kit  that included four sample holders and something to go in to collect all the samples, which had to be liquid.  (Sorry if this is TMI.  I thought the experience would be of some educational benefit.)  The center was about to close, being 5, and wouldn't open again until Monday.
I mulled over staying versus heading back out.  My bloating and stomach ache had stopped.  I'd drunk quite a bit of clean city water.  I would see how I fared overnight.
I walked over to Main Street.  It was still raining.  Front Royal has a delightful Main street with all kinds of restaurants. bakeries, and shops.  There is a visitor center with restrooms and a drinking fountain, and an outfitter store too: all within a few blocks.
I stopped at a Nepalese restaurant for a snack of soup momo and garlic Naan, both fantastic.  There is a great atmosphere in there too.
I bought some new hiking pants and a pair of socks at the outfitter.  I signed in to their AT log.  They and other businesses sponsor a space where hikers can do laundry and take a shower for free!  There were even loaner clothes.  I'm sure its all related to spending lots of money there, which I had certainly done.  I did all that, and grabbed yet another bite to eat of a side salad and braised pork tacos -- both delicious, of course -- at Vibrissa's next door while my laundry was going.
I was surprised how much time I spent running errands.  At this point, it was past 7, and I was basically stuck in town, unless I wanted to Uber back to the trailhead and hike 5 miles in to the next shelter.   In retrospect, that would have made more financial sense.  By now, the affordable hostels were all full, and I ended up at a moderately expensive roadside motel with no included breakfast, hiker box, or any hiking community.  And I had to walk a mile out of the way to get there.  At least the bed was comfortable and I had a shower to myself in the morning.","Gravel Springs Hut

Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664317,"I checked out of the motel at 8, and decided to press on.  I took my giardia test kit with me in case I started getting symptoms again, as there was a related urgent care center Charles Town, a bus ride from Harpers Ferry.
I had a delicious, somewhat healthy breakfast at the Daily Grind of a burrito with egg, bacon, avocado, salsa, and spinach; along with a banana and chai latte.  I was hoping to find someone to give me a lift.  I also stopped by the  Down Home Comfort Bakery, which I think helps to sponsor the hiker space, to I inquire.  No luck, sadly, so, not wanting to wait about 5 hours for the trolley, it looked like Uber would be the way to go here.  I ended up having a much less healthy second breakfast of a warmed up, homemade cinnamon roll with a few assorted small chocolate candies while I was there.
I ended up getting back to the trailhead via Uber around 10:30.  After just 15 minutes or so of hiking, I saw a cooler of trail magic! It had a bunch of cans of soda and bags of chips inside.  I grabbed some Doritos for a break later.
The terrain had a few climbs but was pretty easy and moderate mostly.  Before an opening in the ridge near VA 638 beyond the shelter, there was yet another cooler full of trail magic!  More soda/soda water, candy, granola bars, fruit cups, and other treats.  I took a little more and drank some soda water.
After passing under John Marshall Highway, at a footbridge, I saw a familiar face.  It was Plunger, who I last saw near the Sarver Hollow Shelter a few weeks ago.  He was with a new companion, Skippy.  She said skippy is slang for kangaroo in Australia, I think.  She wanted to see if someone would think she was Australian, though she is actually a New Zealander, the first I've met on trail.  Thry passed through Shenandoah in four days and hiked 30 miles yesterday, spending the night at the lovely Mountain Home Hostel! I took an extended lunch break ther 1:30-2. 
After running into them once more, I had some ground to cover - I wanted to get the roller coaster segment of the trail out of the way tomorrow.  I cruised past the next couple shelters, and just took water breaks, with one snack, until I passed Ashby Gap around 6:40, for a half hour.  I got to Rod Hollow Shelter around 8, found a surprisingly reasonable tent spot amidst the eight talen others there, and retired for the night.  So far, no symptoms.","Front Royal

Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664603,"While still breaking camp, I saw Shower again, from Stanimal's Hostel in Waynesboro, on his way out with a hiking buddy.
I set out at 7:30.  It would be plenty of time to get through the roller coaster -- a trail segment about 15 miles long with several long climbs and descents -- but it was rough, and got pretty warm.
The first couple climbs were steep and tough.  On the second one, I ran into Plunger and Skippy again.  We hiked together for a while.  I asked Plunger if he saw the plunger in moldering privy at Chestnut Knob Shelter.  He did not, and said he got his name from a cold plunge early in his hike. 
I took off after they took a break -- they had started at 4 somewhere before the shelter area where I stayed.  I passed Shower and his hiking friend, and later leapfrogged with them again - I need to ask for his name.  I took an extended break at a nice tenting site near Buzzard Hill, after the fourth climb.  On the way to my break spot, I passed a sign post with supporting rocks around it, but no sign.  I had day hiked much of the roller coaster segment twice, and I knew a sign was supposed to be there to mark 1000 miles for AT NOBO thru hikers.  I was angry that some shithead took the sign.
I ran into Plunger a couple more times as we hot water past the Sam Moore Shelter, maybe climb 6 or 7.  On the way up to the Bears Den overlook, which might be climb 9, I ran into Skippy too.  We chatted for a bit.  In the state, she has thru hiked the Pacific Crest Trail, the Hayduke Trail, and the Grand Enchantment Trail.  We exchanged parts of our experiences, her with the Hayduke Trail and me with the Colorado Trail.  She is thinking about hiking the CT if she finishes the AT with enough time to do that and not go beyond the six month travel visa.
I checked out the Bears Den hostel to see if I could snag a treat, but they were closed.  I saw Rocket doing the same.  I returned to the Bears Den overlook, and had lunch with Plunger and Skippy around noon.
The tenth climb up from Snickers Gap wasn't bad.  The eleventh one was pretty long and felt steep in spots, but I finally got to the WV/VA border on the way up.  Yay!  Then I was also rewarded with a great view at Raven Rocks.  Sweating enough water to feel like I'd washed off my forehead at a sink, I took a much needed water and electrolytes break there.
The twelfth and final climb wasn't steep, but it carried on for a while, and I was getting tired of the climbs.  But I finally got through it, and from there onward the trail mellowed out a lot - I could hike about 3 mph through much of the stretch.
I made it to the junction for the Blackburn Center around 4, and didn't go there.  I wish I had gone there to at least use the spigot, because after about an hour, I had to walk a quarter mile downhill to get water from a spring at the David Lesser Memorial Shelter.
I decided to press on, because I saw easy access to some country store east on Keys Gap, where I arrived around 6:30.  This country store just turned out to be a convenience store at a gas station.  The grill wasn't working, but I got some prepared foods in the refrigerated section, plus a few snacks, fruit, and ice cream that made for a decent dinner. 
I left around 8, and got to a dry campsite about 4 miles from the town of Harpers Ferry to set up camp around 8:45.
And no giardia symptoms whatsoever.","Rod Hollow Shelter

I was excited on the spur trail to see the ATC building, but was disappointed that they would not open until noon, just for the particular day I was in town.
I enjoyed various historical sites and views as I made my way to High Street in the lower downtown area, where I arrived at around 9:30. I was at first upset and frustrated that every place I went by was closed, but then someone said the Battle Grounds Cafe was open.  I had a satisfying breakfast there of an avocado, bacon, and egg breakfast sandwich, a waffle, a Reese's peanut butter cup còokie, orange juice, and a vitamin energy drink.  I saw Showers and his buddy drop in, whom I also saw at the general store about a half hour later.
I hadn't had any symptoms indicating that I might gave giardia or a stomach bug, and couldn't use the testing kit I had carried from Front Royal.  I threw it away.
I found the Town's Inn, where I got a shower and my laundry done.  They also had homemade kombucha on tap with free refills for $4 which I opted for, plus various other treats like fudge and a slice of watermelon.  The place was very homey and I enjoyed the ambience there, but I didn't want to stay the night after only four four miles of hiking and camping only two nights on the trail since Front Royal.  They let me store my pack there as I took the bus to Walmart in Charles Town, which took at least an hour longer than I expected it to.
By the time I returned, it was about 4:15.  I organized my food and grabbed a bite to eat at the Rabbit Hole - had a good chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries and a ""side salad"" that took up a whole dinner plate!  They insisted it was a side portion and that was reflected also in the bill, but I felt they were being generous.  Anyway, it was a positive experience, to undo the negative one I had after a Loudon and Maryland Heights day hike four or five years ago.  I also called my dad, since it was his 70th birthday that day!
Before I headed out, I got some ice cream at Creamy Creations.  I had two delicious scoops of ice cream in a waffle cone: White House Cherry and Peanut Butter Cup.  I wished that I had gotten three scoops instead.
It was now 6, and I made my way over the Byron Memorial Footbridge into Maryland.  I was getting memories of the Four State Challenge that I did with a pack about 9 years ago.  I didn't know it was so swampy off the C&O trail near there - I had hiked through that in the dark.
I slowly climbed up to Weaverton Cliffs with two liters of water, three days of food, and a new canister of fuel, and saw the overlook for the first time, around 7:30.  Excellent view, and well worth the extra 0.4 miles round-trip.  Then I followed the very easy ridge walk to the Ed Garvey Shelter.  It was now about 8:30.
I thought it would be neat to finish all of the MD AT by tomorrow, and that would mean hiking 35 miles from this shelter.  A little too much with all the extra weight I was carrying, I thought.  I decoded to hike another four or so miles to Crampton Gap Shelter.  It would be a night hike, but I figured there wasn't much to see.  Plus, I would enjoy the cool temperatures.
The four miles went mostly quickly.  I wished I had daylight to see the monument, and also the trail.  I went up some side trail for a bit by accident.  Not seeing the white blazes, I walked back and found the AT blazes again.  It was now about 10.  I took a short break because I was getting pretty hungry.  Then I hiked the last halfish mile or so to the shelter area, set up my tent, and went to sleep.","Four Mile Campsite

Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664606,"I got a later start at 8 than expected, but I also didn't set my alarm.  I still figured I could finish in 12-13 hours.
I made great time the first five miles to the Rocky Run Shelter junction, where I had a breakfast break 9:40-10.  It was also fast and easy to the Washington Monument State Park by 11:15, where I refilled water at a fountain and got rid of trash. I explored the monument for a few minutes, the continued onward, passing over the I-70 bridge sometime past noon.
The trail was starting to become more difficult.  I last recall hiking this bit of trail two years ago, when backpacking a horshoe route that included a segment of the MD AT, a 2-3 mile road walk, and the Catoctin Trail with DCUL.
I made it to the Annapolis Rocks junction at 1:20, and headed up there.  The view isn't so great -- heck, the view from Raven Rocks was much better -- but it was a nice spot for lunch. I got back to the AT around 2.  I also looked at the similar mediocre view when I reached Black Rock cliff.
Then I descended to Wolfsville Road. I was getting low on water, but had no interest in the stagnant water source near the Ensign Cowall Shelter, around 4:30, but did take a short break there, because it was hot, I was starting to do more climbing, and needed some electrolytes.
I pressed on another 2.5 miles, past Foxville Road where there is an opening and a walk by a pasture, and found a trickling spring.  I was down to just half a liter by now and was concerned.  I decided to refill there, which took 30 minutes instead of the 10 I was hoping for.  In less than a mile, there was a flowing stream.    This was all in my AT guide, but I was still annoyed by my concern for water and the time it wasted.  Maybe if I had done the Four State Challenge more than once in the past, I would have been better acquainted with the water sources on the MD AT.
I passed Warner Road.  Now the climbs were steep, and it was getting rocky.  It was now past 6.  The climb up to the Raven Rock Shelter junction took a long time with my pack, as did the rough course of rocks that followed for a few miles.
I remember all this from the Four State Challenge.  It was an ugly experience then with 40ish miles of hiking (actually, for me, maybe even more due to missing a turn on the C&O trail) and it's an ugly one now too, with less than 30 miles hiked so far today.  I had to take another break a bit past the High Rock Loop Trail junction, around 7:30.
The trail finally mellowed out a mile and some before Pen Mar County Park, where I arrived around 8:30.  A girl screamed when she saw me.  Initially, I thought it was amusing, but then I realized she was screaming pretty often.  I cooked dinner at a picnic table, got rid of trash, and organized tomorrow's food while I relaxed.  Unfortunately,  the bathrooms were locked.  There were two Four State Challenge finishers near the pavillion at the park overlook.  They asked me if that was what I was doing - no, not today.. I just woke up late and wanted to be done with Maryland.
I continued on around 9, passed the Mason-Dixon line, and eventually came to a camping spot near a footbridge, where I set up my tent and retired.","Crampton Gap Shelter

After getting water from the stream nearby, I headed out around 8:30.  I passed a couple trail maintainers.  I actually pass them about once a week, but often forget to mention it.  They make this hike possible!
I had a breakfast break at Deer Lick Shelter around 10.  An hour later, I passed by the very nice Tumbling Run Shelter, where I had stayed twice on a few weekend backpacking trips covering Pen Mar up through Caledonia State Park.  There was a 900 foot climb up to the Chimney Rocks view, where I took a lunch break noon to 12:30.
I ran into few thru hikers who were slackpacking, as well as a section hiker.  I took a long break after I had a mostly rocky descent to Caledonia State Park and got water from the fountains, emptied trash, and ran into them all again.  The rocks weren't nearly as bad as the rock course near the end of the MD AT.
Around 4:20, I started climbing up to Quarry Gap Shelter, enjoying the green tunnel without rocks, but not as enthusiastic about the 50 day hikers descending from what I assume was a hike to the nearby reservoir.
I took pictures at the award-winning Quarry Gap Shelter just before 5:30.  It has flower pots, a swinging bench, and It would have been pleasant to stay there, but I already knew another five people, plus maybe others would be there.  I didn't notice much space, and wasn't enthusiastic about doing a hair under 20 miles on such easy terrain.
I pressed on, and got to Birch Run Shelter a little after 8.  It may not be award-winning, but it's still a nice shelter area.  Plenty of tent camping and shelter room, a picnic table under the shelter, and the largest privy I've ever seen. It has a cedar chest in there, which I think is full of wood chips for moldering.","Campsite near Footbridge beyond Pen Mar

I saw Plunger and Skippy there, as well as two new hikers I met, Eric and Skipper.  The couple lives nearby.  The man is a Vietnam veteran, and shared some jokes with us.  Skippy shared one of hers too.
I hiked with Eric and Skipper mist of the way to Pine Grove Furnace State Park.  We took photos at the halfway point marker.  I learned that Eric is rushing to try to complete the AT from Virginia through Katahdin in three months before starting a PhD program.  Skipper spent 8 years in the Marine Corps.  He started in mid February, and said he needs to complete the trail by mid August before he starts law school in Wisconsin.
We arrived to the general store at Pine Furnace Grove just past noon.  Plunger and Skippy arrived shortly thereafter.  There were snacks, ice cream, a short order grill.  You can even recharge your phone and use free Wi-Fi.  I got a big hiker burger, fries - a lot of them, and a pint of ice cream, along with a little food I might need to get to Duncannon.  Plunger also gave me a pint of ice cream he bought, because there was chocolate in it that he overlooked - he doesn't eat chocolate.  I shared it with Skippy.
Of all the hikers there, I think Plunger was the only one who did the half gallon challenge: eating a half gallon of ice cream in one sitting.  He got a commemorative spoon for eating a half gallon of strawberry cheesecake ice cream.
There was another person doing resupply trail magic there as well.  He had crackers, mini candy packages, bottles of Gatorade, and Ziploc freezer bags - something I really needed to replace for my ripped up toiletry bag.
There was also an AT museum there. I checked it out, going through the planning and funding for it, construction of it, landmark thru hikers, and culture of long distance trails. They had the gear of some of the constructors and early thru hikers.
I finally left around 2:30.  I passed Plunger and Skippy a couple hours later, who left earlier.   The trail was pretty easy getting to camp for the most part.  A couple climbs, and it did get rocky.  There was a brief rock scramble, but I thought that was fun and helped break the monotony of the trail and tripping over rocks.
I got to camp around 7:30.  The campsite is about a tenth of a mile before the Alec Kennedy Shelter, which has no tenting sites.  I was near some noisy campers who I think were car camping.  They were noisy until about midnight.","Birch Run Shelter

Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664613,"As I was breaking camp, I saw Plunger and Skippy go by.  We were sure we'd see each other in Boiling Springs.  I started hiking around 8.  There was a steep, rocky climb to Center Point Knob -- the original AT midpoint, before all the changes started -- but other than that, it was an easy hike into town.
There was some construction work being done at the south end of the Boiling Springs Pool.  I got distracted, and ended up following a road detour into the charming town.  I saw Plunger and Skippy at the outfitter store neat the AT.  They had said the trail there was not closed off, so I went back along the trail and returned - a tenth of a mile or two.  I had breakfast at Caffe 101 - veggie omelet with bacon, toast, home fries, OJ, and a cinnamon muffin.  All delicious!
I got a bunch of food across the street for most of a resupply to Delaware Water Gap.  Port Clinton, halfway in between from Duncannon, looked like it required a hitch or some unreliable shuttle service, and I wasn't that interested in dealing with that.
I left a little past 11.  Not great for the long mileage I'd planned for today, but the terrain mostly easy.  I'd hiked this section before, and it mostly goes by pastures, along roads, and through towns.  There us a climb near the end of the day, and it gets rocky, but that is the last 5-6 miles.
Shortly after going into and out the fields, I heard ongoing gunshots, which I'd hear for the next three hours.  I was a little concerned, but some day hikers assured me that there was some state shooting range nearby, and they were shooting away from the trail.  I ran into Plunger and Skippy again around 12:30.  We chatted briefly about the gunshots.  Plunger said the time to worry is when you hear a whistle and a gunshot, because then it's near you.  He had direct experience with that: when he was a kid, another kid, just to be a turd, fired a gunshot from his BB gun right by him.  Growing up in a small town in Utah, though, nothing really happened as a result.
It was basically a 3mph pace all day.  The weather was starting to get warmer though.  I saw a cooler with a bunch of drinks inside and grabbed a V8/vitamin water drink around 3.  There was a brief climb to an unremarkable overlook on the way to Darlington Shelter that several day hikers were going toward, though there had also been several pleasant boardwalks by wildflowers that could have attracted them too.
I started on the steepish climb up to the rocky ridge around 6.  The climb was a little long, but not bad at all for the big climb of the day.  It was pretty well-sloped and not rocky.  The climb up to Center Point Knob earlier today felt more taxing.
Once I started hiking along the rocks for about an hour, however, I was feeling fatigued.  I should have taken a break for how long of a day I was doing, but I preferred to stop for a nice break at the Hawk Rock overlook. Where I would get to at sunset.  There were a few day hikers from Duncannon, and maybe a couple backpackers there.  We all enjoyed the sunset together at the excellent view, while done started a campfire.
I left around 8:30, and was trampling over rocks down to Duncannon in the dark.  Still worth it for the sunset, I think.  I made a wrong turn on one of the trails but quickly returned.  I got to Inn Rd around 9:10, and into town 10 minutes later.  Since every other place nearby was closed, I had a dinner of a microwave meal, Propel water, and chocolate milk at the Quick Mart, then headed into the Kind Of Outdoorsy Hostel, where I had a reservation.  I got into bed around 10:30.","Campsite near Little Dogwood Run

Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664768,"As a light sleeper, I basically woke up with the first riser in one of two bunk rooms around 5:30. No matter, I had plenty of chores to do.  I organized food, gathered dirty clothes.  I recharged my phone and uploaded photos, since I couldn't see where the outlets were last night, nor the wifi password.
After that was done, I went to Trail Laundry, a nearby 24 hour laundromat, and started washing around 8:30. The hostel owner, who also owns the adjoint Kind Of Outdoorsy resupply and outfitter store with a hiker box, arrived around 9, and I paid for my stay, and also bought even more food.
I put my stuff in the dryer, and headed to Goodie's for breakfast. Despite being cash only, I managed to get OJ, oatmeal with blueberries, brown sugar, and milk, specially prepared scrambled eggs with green peppers and mushrooms, bacon, toast, and three slices of French toast for just over $20, including tip!  Best breakfast I've had since the all-you-can-eat buffet at Skyland.
I got my clothes and sprayed the Permethrin that I'd shipped to the hostel on them, plus my tent, sleeping bag, and boots around 10.  While that was settling, I walked over to Karn's Foods to get some produce, fruit,and also ended up with some kombucha, yogurt, dark chocolate coated pecans, and a big three piece fried chicken meal with mac & cheese, home fries, and a dinner roll for lunch.  Glad I stopped there, though I had to walk along a highway that sometimes had no shoulder, had a sharp turn, and had to watch out for trucks zooming by me.
Shortly after I returned around 11:15, Plunger and Skippy arrived while I was reorganizing my food, which is now kind of ridiculous in size.  We chatted a bit, then I got to work on all the journal entries I was missing and ate lunch.  Also gathered my newly Permethrin coated clothes and gear, and repacked.  Finally got up to date on journal entries around 2.
I prepared to head back out on the trail. I knew it wouldn't a big day, and I was glad I got to relax so much.  The chores don't require much effort. Plunger and Skippy also wanted to keep hiking, and we chatted about destinations.  The Peters Mountain Shelter, 11 miles ahead, looked like a reasonable stopping point, so I said I'd aim for that, but also remarked I might wing it.
I left around 3.  The first mile and a half from the hostel, which is right off the trail, was a road walk through town and on bridges crossing over the Juniata and Susquehanna rivers.  As I recalled from a previous section hike several years ago (I can't believe it's been so long!), the next six or seven miles to PA 225 was a long, steep climb back up to the plateau, which had rocks galore.  But there was also a great view over looking Duncannon with the two rivers at field crossing by a power line.
It was definitely about as tough as the rocky course in MD.   Fortunately, these rocks, while requiring careful maneuvering at times, were orderly and easy to predict.  Sometimes like a slanted sidewalk, other times a little bit of a scramble.  I prefer that to what looks like disheveled rocks that looked randomly displaced by angle, location, and size all across the footpath, which is what the ridge walk to Hawk Rock was like yesterday.  No tripping today.
I made it to PA 225 around 6:40, had a break, and left around 7.  The trail was much easier.  No rocks and terrain that was basically flat.  There were also great views of the valley, again due to power line crossings.
I made it to Peters Mountain Shelter just past 8.  I shrugged and decided to go a bit further.  I noticed from this year's AT guide that Kinter View was just a couple miles away, and was thinking I could catch the last remnants of the sunset and then camp there for the sunrise.  The terrain was still easy enough to hike the 2.6 miles to get there around 9.  By then, it was dark.  I set up camp, and set my alarm for 5:30.  Because I had two huge meals today, I just drank some hot water and at a few snacks before I went to sleep.","Duncannon

Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664769,"The sunrise time at Kinter View was 5:42.  The view is to the right of the AT, going north, so I was hoping it would be a good spot for sunrise.  The sky was colorful, but there was no pink ball.
I started hiking at 7:30. It would be a warm day.  I took a breakfast and water break at Clark Creek, about four miles in, around 9-9:30.  The first climb wasn't bad, and I had a lunch break once I reached the Yellow Spring historical site for a village, where I arrived a little before noon.
I was grateful for the lack of rocks so far.  After a descent, I got water just before Rausch Gap Shelter around 2.  I went through a bit of a road walk and crossed a beaver dam.  I began a second climb, up the appropriately named Second Mountain, and took another break a little before 3.  It was pretty warm, but at least there was a light breeze.
I arrived to Swatara Gap around 4:50 after descending and a few highway crossings, then began my final, and most difficult climb for the day, up to the ridge.  After 21-22 miles, I had a tough time with it.  The heat of the day also didn't help.  About 35 minutes past the Swatara Gap bridge, I took a break at a campsite.  It cooled down over my half hour break, and shortly beyond the campsite, the climb became a lot less steep.  As I walked along the ridge, the wind picked up, and which made me feel a lot better.  There were a few annoying stretches with rocks, but they weren't around for long.
I took another break at an overlook past a few campsites around 7:15.  I was pretty tired.  If only I had enough water, I would have camped at one of them.  Still, just under 3 miles to go.
An hour later, I got to William Penn Shelter.  I shared a large tent campsite with Seeker, who started in early March.  We chatted for a bit.  He said there was a point in North Carolina where the temperature got down to single digits overnight, after a big rain, and much of his gear froze.  He had to walk in shorts and sandals to start a day when it was 20F, but he said it warmed up quickly.
I got much needed water, set up camp, had dinner, organized food, and looked at potential places to eat in the towns ahead.  I retired pretty late, around 11.","Campsite at Kinter View

Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664770,"A nearby weather forecasted the high temperature to be 9F cooler than yesterday, so I was happy to feel cool enough to keep my jacket on while breaking camp.  I left at 8:15.
The day had virtually no climbs -- basically flat, on the elevation profile -- but there were many rocky stretches.  It wasn't rocky all day, but some of them went on long enough for me to suspect it.
I took my first break around 9:50 near a memorial for Pilger Ruh, or Pilgrim's Rest, since it was at a spring.  I took a lunch break after taking a side trail down to a swimming hole at Hertline Campsite around 12:20.  The water was frigid, but still refreshing and revitalizing.  Having it nearby during the weather yesterday would have been such a relief.
At this point, I had hiked just under 10 miles.  I didn't see the point in hammerring out 28 miles to get to Port Clinton around 9, when it would be dark and everything would be closed.  So, I just decided to take it easier today and dry camp in a spot to have breakfast there, and pick up a few snacks.
I saw Seeker again today, as we leapfrogged in between breaks.  He also planned a dry camp for a handy morning arrival there.
I grumbled through some of the rocky stretches at times.  But there was still plenty of simple dirt terrain on my path today.  It was so easy to walk through that I was daydreaming.  Then I got back to reality with a sudden, mild trip.
I took another break about a mile past the Black Swatara Spring around 3:45-4:15, then did a pit and water gathering stop at Eagle's Nest Shelter, 5:10-5:40. I hiked for another hour and a half.
I passed four dry campsites, with only one of them occupied.  Rocksylvania could also go by the moniker Campsitesylvania, but I guess that isn't as catchy.
After a very steep, rocky, but short climb, I passed by a sign for a spring, which I think refers to the unreliable Phillips Canyon Spring.  About 0.4 miles later, I found a fifth campsite around 7:20, and decided to camp there. 
Looks like 4 miles to town.  I could hear faint traffic from the highway.","William Penn Shelter

Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664927,"I started hiking at 7:30. The high was forecasted to be 4F warmer today.  The rocks welcomed me back to the trail as I hobbled my way to Port Clinton.  The rocks don't hurt, but it's frustrating to go so slowly.  Not 20 minutes into the hike, I saw Seeker set up.  He greeted me - very friendly guy.  After some rock hopping and gentle downhill, there was a very steep descent into town over 0.3 miles that I made me groan.
Port Clinton is a small town, but full of charm.  You can access everything within a block of Penn Street, which is parallel to the highway and has virtually no traffic.  I stopped by the barbershop first, around 9:15, where I heard hikers were welcome.  And they were! They welcomed us in, even though we weren't getting haircuts.. except for one guy.  They had donuts, cookies, and other pastries ready for us.  There was also cold, filtered water for us to refill, plus hot coffee and Gatorade mix.  We could also sit in one of several rocking chairs and recharge our phones.  The couple who own it and do the haircuts wanted to hear stories, and sign their log.  They also had antiques, guitars, and lots of cool posters everywhere, plus an old coin and bill collection. I enjoyed some relaxation time as I listened to 70s classic rock and general conversation. I met a few other friendly hikers there, who started on May 6 from Front Royal.
I saw that the 3Cs restaurant was open today, and my AWOL AT guide stated they had the best breakfast.  I headed over there at 10:45, which was about a ten minute walk from the shop.  I was seated next to a place to recharge, and they have free Wi-Fi.  Their menu has a lot of breakfast items - they even have several subcategories!  I took a picture of the breakfast options in the menu. I had water, OJ, and a soda water.  I got a side tossed salad, fruit cup, omelette with chicken, spinach, cherry tomatoes, and cheese with wheat toast and a pancake.  I wasn't quite full, so I got one more pancake filled with peanut butter chips for dessert.  Awesome breakfast and definitely one of the now three favorites, along with the ones at Skyland and Goodie's.  I signed their log, and leafed through old entries too.  They have entries dating back to the 90s!
On my way back to the AT, I made a short stop at The Peanut Shop, which had opened while I was lounging at the barbershop.  While I had enough food to get to Delaware Water Gap, I figured a few treats over the next few days would be nice.  The shop has all kinds of trail mixes -- with and without peanuts -- plus lots of different  types of small assorted candies that you could mix and match.  They also had plenty of dried fruit, some crystallized and some not.  And of course, homemade fudge!  Plus cold beverages.  I grabbed a Gatorade Zero for the trail, a couple dark chocolate fudge dipped Oreos, a few scoops of different spicy trail mixes, plus a fruit and nut one, and various hard, chewy, and chocolate candies.
It was now a bit past 12:30.  I began the long climb back up to the plateau.  The rocks weren't that bad, at least, but it was hot, and the high was forecasted to warm from 86 to 90 over these few days through Friday or Saturday.  I descended to Reservoir Road around 2:30, and got some water.  There was another climb up to Pulpit Rock, which was not too bad.  It had big rocks further up, but those were fun to walk through.  I passed by an observatory on the way, then, around 3:30, enjoyed a break there.  To my pleasant surprise, I saw Plunger and Skippy there!  They had camped at Black Swatara Spring, a few miles behind me, and opted not to have the grand town tour that I did.
I wanted to stay at Eckville Shelter, and so did they.  We hiked together for the next 7 miles or so.  The trail got so easy that we were walking on a road with a gentle downhill slope, and making good time.  I learned more about their adventures.  They have seen a lot more wildlife on the AT than I have.  They saw a black bear, a fox, and when they were sitting on a rock, they learned that there were a bunch of rattlesnakes plus one copperhead under it. I was not jealous of that latter experience.
I learned that the island that Plunger had kayaker to with the greatest density of brown bears is called Admiralty Island, and has an old gold mine there too.  Visiting there could make for an adventurous weekend, as long as you survive.
I learned that Skippy thru hiked the Te Araroa, a 3000km hiking trail in New Zealand that includes Clearwater, an area used in Peter Jackson's LOTR trilogy.  She also visited the north island, where the village with all the homes for Hobbiton is located in that series.  She said the trek is far more interesting than the AT.  I would love to hike it!  She also recommended visiting the southern island to see kiwi birds, the only place in the world where they inhabit.
Eventually, I was in front, and ended up losing them.  It was close to 7, and I was expecting to see a turnoff for the shelter soon, which has water spigots - fancy.  I kept going past a parking lot and passed a couple slow flowing streams, then climbed a little.  I thought it was rolling terrain, but after several minutes, it was clear I had passed the turnoff for the shelter and was making the bug climb up the plateau again! I had enough water for dinner and the morning, and didn't want to have to repeat the climb, so I kept going.
I got to the junction for the trail to Hawk Mountain, where the steep climbing ends, around 7:30.  I was so glad I had that Gatorade Zero.  I finished that plus a few snacks, and looked at my guide: 5.5 miles to the next reliable water source.  It hasnt rained for days, and nearly all the seasonal sources have dried up.  I decided to keep going while temperatures were cool, and get closer to the water source.
I got to the trail to Dan's Spring around 8:30.  It would be nice to get some extra water.  I went down the steep trail - there was no water.  I returned and it was basically dark, with what looked like a close to full moon.  I continued walking, and about 0.8 miles past the spring trail was a dry campsite, where I arrived around 9:10.  I made camp, had some ramen with extra brown rice, some instant mashed potatoes, a pack of salmon, and a candy bar - north of 600 calories.  On weekend trips, that would be plenty.  However, after close to two months, I've lost about 20 pounds while hiking, and I need a good 1000 calories per dinner at least.  I now normally ingest hundreds of calories on my breakfast, lunch, and snack breaks.  I had a granola bar, a packet of some chocolate peanut butter, and most of a bag of yogurt coated pretzels.  I was full then, and fell asleep.","Campsite beyond Phillips Canyon Spring

Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664946,"Today was a hot day - 88 for the high, and no breeze until early evening.
I started a little before 8.  It was an ambitious day for me.  Given my mixup, and the fact that I advanced another 4.4 miles on the AT, it was now realistic for me to hike 27 miles to Little Gap and have dinner at the Slopeside Bar and Grill.  But, even without all the rocks, it would be a push.  First things first, though: I needed water.  I had barely enough while waking up and breaking camp, and now I had none left.  There was a reliable spring in 3.3 miles.
After about 10-20 minutes, Plunger caught up with me.  We hiked together to the spring junction.  I learned that Skippy started April 6 and is retired.  I also learned that Plunger had a Mormon upbringing, something not so surprising when growing up in small town Utah.
We got to the junction right about 9.  Plunger already had plenty of water, so he went on his way.  There were two different springs.  The much closer blue-blazed one had a pipe barely dripping out any water; all that was left was stagnant water.  I tried the yellow-blazed spring: 0.3 miles downhill.  I was upset and worried I would also find stagnant water there.  Fortunately, there was a good flow out of the pipe.  I collected 2.5 liters, and walked back up to my pack.  I took a breakfast and water break there, drinking a liter of water.
I left around 10.  The day grew warmer.  Many medium-sized rocks were often sticking out of the ground.  I was very frustrated with how slow I was going.  Eventually, I started yelling and cursing at the rocks.  When I was going through the Knife Edge around noon, a cool feature requiring scrambling over large rocks, my inReach detached from my pack and fell under one of the large rocks.  I was livid and cursed even more.  I was able to recover my inReach.
I passed by someone on my way down who I think heard my cursing well.  I think I was acting like a madman. My rock rage was getting the better of me.  I took a lunch break around 12:30 at a campsite and felt a little better, but the hot sun slowly snuck into my shade over the half hour break.  I suffered in the heat as I passed through Bake Oven Knob, and descended to Lehigh Gap.
I was not feeling so great and was getting low on water.  Just before the road crossing at Lehigh Gap around 3, I saw a cooler there with water, maintained daily by trail angels.  I was so grateful and took a water and electrolytes break there, plus a trail snack or two.  Another hiker, Garfunkel, was there.  We would leapfrog for a few miles due to asynchronous breaks until the Lehigh River south bank, where he stepped off into Palmerton.
In between, the next stretch was very pleasant.  No mine fields of scatteted rocks - rocks on the trail seemed much more organized.  There was a climb up to a ridge with plentiful views of the towns and Lehigh River below.  I found an excellent spring right on the trail, near George W Outerbridge Shelter.
Now tanked up with water around 5:30, I descended to the south bank of the river and enjoyed the scenic walk across the river.  Then, around 6, there was a steep 900 ft climb to an amazing overlook of the river, with some fun scrambling.  Dealing with this kind of rock felt purposeful and rewarding.  After 40 minutes of climbing, I was on another ridge again, with more plentiful views of Danielsville below.  I reached a powerline overlook with a great sunset view around 7:45 or 8.
I now had the descent down to Little Gap left, and was feeling positive about reaching the pub before it closed at 9.  As I descended, I started running into rooted rocks scattered across the footpath.  My rock rage quickly returned.  I made my way down with yelling and cursing while watching out for the rocks, reaching Little Gap at 8:20.
I had to walk a bit under a mile to the pub along a very well paved private road with little traffic, and made it to the Slopeside Pub & Grill a little before 8:40.  I asked if they were still serving.  The hostess said the kitchen made its last call about a half hour ago, and they weren't seating anyone anymore.  I was dismayed.  I asked if a takeout order was possible.  She asked her supervisor, and yes, it was!  I ordered a side salad, BBQ burger, and a large chocolate milk that they put in a big Pepsi cup.  While the food was cooking, I used the restroom to wash up, hot rid of trash, refilled my water at a water fountain, and got a cold bottle of tea from a vending machine.
They let me eat in the building that housed the pub - this is in a resort, and it also has free Wi-Fi.  As staff were leaving, I topped off my water, with more in the empty tea bottle, and got some apple juice for breakfast tomorrow morning.  Between Little Gap and Delaware Water Gap, there aren't many reliable water sources you can reach within half a mile or less.
I returned to Little Gap around 9:30, and hiked uphill through large walks about 0.3 miles, where I found a flat spot to set up a makeshift campsite.  I quickly set up camp and, stuffed from dinner, fell asleep pretty easily.","Campsite beyond Dan's Spring

Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664948,"Today was forecasted to have a high of 90F.  I woke up around 5:30.  My bladder urged me to go more promptly than usual.  I quickly stepped out of my tent.  At my makeshift campsite, I had to quickly pass by a large but flimsy tree branch.  As I did, I tripped and fell, hitting my forehead on a rock.  There was a bit of bleeding, so I put Neosporin on a large bandage, taped it on the bleeding area, then put Leukotape around the bandage.  I felt better and the bandage appeared to control the bleeding.  I was glad I had the apple juice this morning.  I drank that with a pack of nuts and dried fruit for 440 calories, and headed out around 7:15.
There were unpleasant rocks rooted out of the ground at many spots today, but -- not feeling rushed -- I managed to abate my rock rage most of the day.  I hiked about 15 miles to Wind Gap without issue, with breaks at 9:30 and 12:30. I frequently checked my bandage to see if there was any blood oozing there.
I reached Wind Gap around 1:15.  There was a hotel where hikers are allowed to use a water spigot.  It is 0.2 miles from the trailhead off of PA 33, a busy highway.  The guide I have said it was eastward, so I headed to the right, as I was heading northbound.  But then I checked again after not finding a anything other than residences.  The map showed it was actually to the left of where I got off.  Once I got there, and figured out where the spigot was, I took a longer water and electrolytes break there in a chair under the shade. I drank a liter of water and had another snack.
Then, I followed the trail a couple minutes across the highway, beginning a 600 foot climb back onto the plateau around 2:45.  The rocks weren't too bad on top of it, but I think I wanted my day to be over.  On the other hand, with what I believed to be limited water sources, I wanted a relatively short hike into Delaware Water Gap the next day for food and services.  I pressed on.  To my relief, the wind picked up, and I heard distant thunder, then sporadic showers.  But then the rocks returned.  I very carefully made my way through Wolf Rocks around 4:30.  After the rock formation, the terrain became easier and less rocky.
I got to Fox Gap around 7:10 then to a campsite past the shelter with a great view around 7:30. There were a few LASHers -- Two Hitch, Navigator, and Bear Repellent -- there with whom I shared the large site.  They made a campfire while I enjoyed dinner and the sunset.  There was also a nearly full moon to enjoy, too.","Campsite beyond Little Gap

Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665195,"I woke up around 5:20, in time to head to the view to see the sunrise.  It was to the right of the trail going northbound, like Kinter View several days ago.  Also like Kinter View, it wasn't to the east.  We got a few colors to see at the view for the sunrise.
I started hiking at 7:15 again.  There were plenty of instances of rocks sticking out of the ground every which way.  I growled through some of them for slowing me down.  Then again, I was also annoyed by several dayhikers -- having the right of way, and for whom I waited -- for delaying my access to town food.  I did not growl at them.  There were also a couple stretches of road walks, and a few overlooks of the town and the Delaware River.  I arrived to Delaware and Main streets around 9:30.
First stop was Church of The Mountain, where I took a shower.  Some were curious about the bandage on my forehead.
I left my pack there and headed to the bakery on Broad St.  I got a bacon, avocado, and cheese breakfast sandwich with a peach, chocolate covered s'more, and piece of chocolate fudge with M&Ms on top. All delicious, and they had pie!  I would be back later.
I hit up the Sunoco and recharged my device while buying a few low sugar drinks with vitamins, and resupply items.  The cashier gave me a free banana.
I stopped at the outfitter store.  They have limited supplies, but I got a couple freeze dried meals, trail meal bars, a bottle of Gatorade Zero, and a new pair of liner socks.  My old ones got all torn up from hiking through all the rocks.
I returned to the church to organize food, give a donation, and, not feeling hungry anymore, gave away my free banana.  
After that, I wanted to see if I could get laundry done and go to a grocery store.  I messed this up big time, and should have asked others at the church.  In the AT guide, I had read about a Pocono Pony bus that picks up at the Park and Ride, snd goesvto Stroudsburg, where both are present, but didn't do basic research.
I tried going to the MARTA station.  They CSR folk knew next to nothing about it.  I walked back to town and went to the Visitor's Center across from the Park and Ride.  The CSR also knew little about it, but gave me a schedule and checked some things that I should have fine on my own, like a nearby laundromat.  All were miles away - in Stroudsburg.  The Pocono Pony is a commuter bus during the week.  Morning hours go to the Delaware Water Gap, and afternoon hours go back to Stroudsburg.  I gave up on that.  I recharged my phone while I was there.
I went back into the center of town and had a late lunch at Sango Kura, a Japanese Sake brewery that also serves ramen dishes.  I had their homemade pork ramen - delicious!  I then went next door to the bakery to get a slice of mixed berry pie with crumble crust, a peach, and a chocolate bar for on the trail.  All great!  I also went to Doughboy's Pizza to get a side tossed salad and also got a slice of pizza.  It was OK.
It was getting late - maybe 6.  Plunger had messaged me, saying that he and Skippy had 15 miles around 10ish.  I wanted to see them, but I had only hiked about 6 miles so far today.  I was itching to get back out and just see them later.  So, I stopped by Zoe's Ice Cream Emporium and had an amazing hot fudge brownie sundae with scoops of vanilla and chocolate icream, walnuts, whipped cream, and a cherry.  It was divine - hands down the best sundae I've ever had.
Around 6:45 I returned to the church, got my pack, and was informed that I could have done my laundry at a nearby inn.  There was also a posting on the wall about a shuttle driver for Walmart.  I really need to be more vigilant about getting information.  My AT guide might work well enough for navigation, daily hike plans, and resupply planning, but it is far from comprehensive.
I got back on the trail around 7, soon crossing the bridge over the Delaware River into New Jersey.  I felt excited and a little emotional about it.  The last few days in PA had been rough, and I hoped things would get better.  I saw in the guide that there were several shops and taverns just off some of the roads in NJ and NY along the trail, which excited me. 
After passing by Kittatinny Point, I generally hiked uphill with a mild slope, getting to a backpacker's campsite 5 miles past town around 8:45.  I had already eaten plenty, so I set up my tent, put my smellables in the bear box, and went to sleep.","Campsite with View beyond Kirkridge Shelter

Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665246,"I started hiking around 8.  It was cool - a great start.  But I'd heard about the wildfire smoke coming from western Canada by now, and knew this nice hiking weather would not last.
I hiked around part of the lovely Sunfish Pond to start.  It was rocky and a little slow going, but scenic and enjoyable.  Shortly thereafter, I got to the summit of Kittatinny Mountain around 9:15. There were great views of the Delaware River as well as other bodies of water below, which continued as I descended down the ridge.
I got to Camp Rd around 10:30. I saw a cooler of trail magic there, and enjoyed a cup of fruit along a couple of my other snacks.  I ran into a section hiker there from NJ who had section hiked in VT as well.  He recommended a hostel where they pick up, drop off, with shower and laundry included for $45.  I will have to check it out.
In an hour, I got to Catfish Tower.  I saw the LASHers I shared a camp with a couple days ago.  I would have kept going, but a guy up in the tower above welcomed us, and invited us to come up.  So we did.  We met Bob, who was on fire lookout duty.  He gave us a Catfish Tower card, and a spiel about NJ fire towers here and in neighboring states, his navigation system for reporting smoke, and showed us points from afar to where we were headed -- interesting field of work.  One guy asked what his longest time on duty was.  I think it was something like 60ish hours over a weekend, all spent in the tower!  As we left, he said to help ourselves to the spring water he left in canteens on the back of his truck, and we did so!
I left around 12:20. The next 11 miles to Brink Shelter were pretty uneventful. The previous states were better about including signs at junctions to other trails.  I'm not just talking about short trails to a spring.  I'm talking about no sign to a lake or a village, etc.  NJ typically just puts a blaze at a junction.  And sometimes, these footpaths can be part of multiple trails, which can make it a little confusing.
I took a break near a gravel road crossing with an anonymous red blazed trail around 2:45, and another at the Brink Shelter junction around 6 for a half hour.  In a little under 4 miles, I would reach Culvers Gap in Branchville, where there are a couple taverns a short walk along the road.  Although I was 20 miles in, I thought it would be nice to dine at one.
I got to Culvers Gap around 7:30, and decided to have dinner at the Mountain House Tavern and Grill  They would close at 8 that day, but still seated me - right by Culver Lake!  I enjoyed a tossed salad and a tzatziki bowl along with the beginnings of a sunset on the lake.  Excellent service, though kind of pricey for a thru hiker.
I had a little under 3 miles to hike to the shelter.  I got some water from their spigot, and at 8:20, began the long, moderate climb to Culver Fire Tower, where I arrived around 9.  I descended to the Glen Anderson Shelter, arriving around 9:30.  All filled up with food, I made camp and fell asleep.","Backpacker's Campsite off Douglas Trail

Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665412,"It was another unusually cool day.  The ups and downs were more difficult than I expected in NJ.
I got started around 8:15.  I passed a pavilion at the top of Sunrise Mountain about an hour later.  I was not impressed with the view.
I hiked for another 90 minutes before I ran into Chance going southbound. He says he hikes southbound, but rides his bike north to do another section, so I could see him again.  Some people just can't get enough exercise.  He informed me that there was a trail magic stand near the entrance to High Point State Park, about 4 miles away, and that they would be there until noon.  Given that it was 10:45, I wasn't feeling optimistic about catching them.  Still, I hiked for another hour.  I didn't want to out off a break anymore, so I took a break at a small overlook.
I got to High Point State Park around 1:30.  The trail magic people were still there!  Jim and Robin, from the Port Jervis, NY area, had cold beverages, fruit, donuts, and some trail snack resupply items.  I took a watermelon slice and a clementine, plus two donuts.  I also grabbed a few trail snacks.  I met Woot, a past AT thru hiker who is now a ridge runner in NJ.  They help keep the trail clean.  She said they are a bit like phone service between thru hikers too.  I also met a few thru hikers who started in February - including Mr. Friendly, who lives up to his name.   We chatted about various experiences.
Between the rocks in PA continuing into NJ and what were becoming unremarkable overlooks, I had questioned whether I was still having fun hiking.  Certainly trail magic and friendly chatter with good company is fun.  Some of them suggested taking a day off, or a shorter day.  I considered it for later, since I also wanted to get to Unionville to have another town meal, plus resupply items for a day or two.
I pressed on around 2.  I followed the trail passed a viewing point of the NJ high point monument.  A little while later, I ran into multiple blazes on one tree: blue, plus a laminated marker with red and green on a white background.  At first I though this was four blazes, including a white blaze for the AT.  I quickly found out I was wrong, and found my way back to the AT.  I continued on the AT and went downhill.  It was then that I realized that multiple blazed path would have taken me up to NJ's high point.  But I didn't want to return, and continued downhill.
The next 8-9 miles or so to Unionville were uneventful.  A thru hiker zipped by me as I was starting up after a break near a stream.  I saw her again, along with Mr. Friendly and company, sitting in chairs on a patio charging their phones at Horler's General Store in Unionville, around 5:30. I did the same, got another day or two of resupply items, and ate a Snickers ice cream bar.  They had a short order grill too, but I decided to check out Wit's End Tavern down the street for potentially healthier options.
I was glad I did.  One of their specials was sesame grilled ahi tuna on a bed of spring greens.  The wasabi served with it was the strogest I've ever tasted - complete nasal cavity clearance with tears.  I got that with spinach artichoke dip and tortilla chips.  I got the main course first and the appetizer second, making my dinner go dessert first, then main course, then appetizer.  I could continue recharging there, plus they had Wi-Fi.  It took a while for them to get my food out though, so I didn't end up returning to the AT until just before 8.
I had 4.2 miles to hike.  I figured I would be done in a couple hours, but I was wrong.  While much of it was flat walking along a river and went by quickly, there was a long walk along several wooden platforms that slowed me down in the dark.  At one point, I hit my shin against one of the platforms.  I decided to supplement my headlamp, whose battery was apparently a little low, with the flashlight from my phone.  That made things a lot faster, until the last steep climb up to the shelter area: 440 feet in a half mile, and rocky.  I finally got to camp a little before 10:30.  I set up my tent, ate some snacks, coughed a bit for some reason, and went to bed.","Glen Anderson Shelter

Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665419,"I got started around 8:20 today.  The sky was not yet hazy, but still unusually cool.  There was a steep climb in about 6 miles, but also a place to get snacks and fresh produce right before it.  I enjoyed a walk along a boardwalk shortly before arriving to NJ 94 around 10:45, where Heaven Hill Farm is a couple minutes' walk.  I got a chicken burrito, a few leaves of red and romaine lettuce, a small crown of broccoli, two scoops of ice cream with oreo crumbles on a waffle cone, and trail snacks with some kombucha. It was a delicious, early lunch break!  I bought some dark chocolate treats to have after dinner some night.
An hour later, I started up the Stairway to Heaven.  It is a little under 400 feet of gain over 0.4 miles on rocky terrain for most of it.  I thought that wouldn't be too bad initially, but by the time I was done slogging up it, I thought it was a climb from Hell.
The trail mellowed out as I moved on past Wawayanda Shelter.  I had a break at the Warwick Turnpike around 2:15.  I was half tempted to stay the night at the drive-in movie theater a couple miles west on the road, which is friendly for considerate thru hikers who can find a ride there.  Ultimately though, I thought it would be a hassle to get there.  I pressed on to my original destination, a shelter past the New York border.
As I pressed on, the sky became hazier.  At the NJ/NY border, around 4:30, the terrain was full of rock slabs and some scrambling, which slowed down hiking.
Around 7:30, I got to NY 17A, and walked down the road to Bellvale Farms Creamery for my second ice cream treat - a milkshake made with calf tracks ice cream, Reese's pieces, and M&Ms.  I had a banana too.  I had two miles left to get to the shelter, and that would end up being my dinner for the night.  It looked like there might have been a nice overlook there, but it was difficult to see much, due to the now pronounced smoky haze in the sky.
I filled up water and returned to the trail around 8:15. Because of some more slow rock scrambling, I didn't end up getting to the shelter until 9:30.  I quickly set up my tent, once I could find a decent spot, had some cheesy chip mix to curb hunger a little, and fell asleep.","Pochuck Mountain Shelter
",Wildcat Shelter,"Jun 06, Tue",21.70
Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665430,"I started around 8:15.  Hazy but cool all day.  There had not been rain for about two weeks, which caused even some of the reliable water sources to dry up.  Because of all the spigots off of highways from delis and other places, I have been OK so far with water.  Occasionally there would be spots with trail magic water, but sometimes all the jugs were empty.
I was able to get water at Fitzgerald Falls, around 9.  There some highway crossings as I passed through Harriman State Park, around 1.
I saw a past AT thru hiker, Odie, near the Arden Valley Road entrance who offered beer, but I had to decline, since I don't drink. I chatted with him about the increasing difficulty of the trail.  I get very frustrated and angry with how slow I move, and what I feel are a lack of rewards like great overlooks or falls. He said sometimes you just have to take it one step at a time.  It's been a slow process for me to accept that I either need to start earlier -- and last several days, I haven't started very early -- or just accept that I will end up with less daily mileage than I'm used to accomplishing.
A little while after a break, I went through a scramble called the lemon squeezer - a narrow corridor between rock walls that I managed to still get my big  pack through without detaching it.  Then, right after, an interesting climb up a rock that required reaching up to put my trekking poles on a left, level area that was a little too high and lacked handholds for climbing, and then climbing up using the handholds on the right.
The Surebridge Brook, a reliable water source, was basically mud with a few puddles of stagnant water.  I still had water left, and decided to get some at the Tiorati Circle beach recreation area off of an intersection with Arden Valley Road that I would get to.
I passed the junction to the Fingerboard Shelter around 5:30 and, 1.1 miles later got to Arden Valley Rd and then Tiorati Circle around 6.  There were vending machines, restrooms, and a water fountain.  I supplemented my snacks, had a break and a pit stop. I ran into a group of college aged backpackers doing a loop with the AT and the Long Path, which I crossed at an earlier junction today.  They were headed to the Fingerboard Shelter and were glad it was not far.
All loaded up with water for the night, I returned to the trail around 6:45, then hiked to the next shelter.  I got there around 9:30, tented, and fell asleep.  At a hair under 20 miles after a full day, I felt a bit defeated.","Wildcat Shelter
",William Brien Memorial Shelter,"Jun 07, Wed",19.80
Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665432,"Hazy but slowly clearing up throughout the day.  The first climb up West Mountain was rough.  It was just 3.4 miles to the West Mountain Shelter from where I started, but I didn't get to that shelter junction until about 10. The haze obscured what would have been a great overlook of the Hudson River in the mountains. The trail mellowed out after the initial descent.
I climbed up Bear Mountain, then descended on the well-groomed path to Bear Mountain State Park, where I saw views that seemed to reflect a day slowly clearing up.  Hessian Lake was pretty.  I supplemented my lunch with trail snacks and ice cream from the vending machines, and loaded up on water at a fountain.
Around 1, I passed through the Trailside Museum and Zoo, which the AT goes through, then over Bear Mountain Bridge.  Something felt uncomfortable on the bottom of my left leg, but I continued through the road walk and, around 2, started a climb up from NY 9D.  The pain was uncomfortable, and I was already frustrated with how slow I was going.
After another climb and descent, I eventually made my way down to US 9 and NY 403, where the Appalachian Market is.  I got there around 4:30 and spent a hood 90 minutes there.  I looked at my mower left leg: looked like a little bit of swelling on my shin, so I decided to start taking NSAIDS for the first time for hiking in nine years.  I resupplied for a couple days and ate a large meal: three pieces of pork, a heaping of rice and corn, a large tossed salad, and yogurt with some vitamin drinks.  I saw a hiker there I ran into a few times today, on and off.  He has been having much better luck seeing wildlife than I have.  At 5, it showered shortly, which I looked to with hope for the water sources.
Around 6, I hiked another 6 miles or so. I knew I should stay at a designated campsite, but it's hard to do that when there is a 22 mile gap between the sites.  Given that I didn't even hike 20 miles yesterday, I accepted the makeshift campsite around 8:30, as did several other hikers at various points on my path past the Appalachian Market.
Still full from my large meal, I tented, and had some tea with a chocolate bar to tide me over for the night.","William Brien Memorial Shelter

Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665434,"I started a little past 8:30 today.  After about an hour of hiking, I ran into Joker, a retired civil engineer from the Philadelphia metro area who is thru hiking the AT a second time - he first did it in 2017.  We hiked and chatted together for the next several miles, passing by the Canopus Lake in Clarence Fahnestock State Park around noon and taking a lunch break closer to 1.  Then we leapfrogged with each other between separate breaks.
I passed by the 911 Memorial flag painting on a rock slab shortly after the lunch break, descended to the junction with the RPH (Ralph's Peak Hiker) Shelter, where there are bunks and pizza can be delivered.  I wanted to head further to the NY 52 highway to Stormville though, because I saw a deli and pizzeria that I thought would be great for dinner.
I got to the highway around 5 and walked the half mile to the deli and pizzeria. I hot a couple slices, and the gave me a free cheese slice.  I also got a tossed salad that was huge.  I ate it all.  I chatted with Fizzix, a northbound thru hiker who had started in February.  I had two scoops of gelato.  The pizza was good, and the gelato was amazing!  I would have loved another scoop.  This all cost me under $20.  I might go back someday just for some of their gelato again.
Joker rolled as I was getting some snacks and water.  They have tent sites there that he was going to take, but I hadn't hiked as far as I would have liked.
So, at 6, I pressed on to the next shelter.  On the way, it started raining.  I was excited for the water sources.  It came down and was steady - this was no shower.  Thankfully, it had stopped by the time I got to the shelter around 9:00.  I was still full, so I tented up, and fell asleep.","Campsite near South Highland Rd

Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665435,"Today I started around 8:30 again.  It was an uneventful morning, though the walk along Nuclear Lake around 10 was nice.  I also took a break by Dover Oak, the oldest tree on the AT.
Around 12:30, I was about 10 minutes fron the AT Railroad Station when I ran into some people who were just setting up trail magic!  The three of them, part of the New York Hiking and Camping meetup group, had taken the train up from NYC and brough a great deal of food: fruit, trail snacks plus snacks from specialty groceries, cookies, hot dogs with grilled onions and peppers, and even empanadas.  I indulged for over an hour there.  While I was there, Joker rolled in, as well as Plunger and Skippy - what a reunion!  We chatted more and talked about spending the night at a place in Salisbury, CT in a couple days.
I finally headed out around 2.  With 11 miles to go, I wouldn't have any issues making it to my planned destination. I stopped by the hiker friendly Native Landscapes and Garden Center for a few more snacks on the trail near the railroad station, then pressed on.
Around 4:30, I took a break near Leather Hill Rd to get some water, since the water in the river near my planned shelter was not safe to drink.  Eventually, Joker, Plunger, and Skippy passed by me during it.
I passed by Joker, who stopped at the nearby Wiley Shelter.  I passed Plunger and Skippy during their swim break at a footbridge - if it was warmer, I might have taken a dip too.
I passed the NY/CT border around 6 and got to the Ten Mile River Shelter around 7.  Plunger and Skippy arrived shortly thereafter.  The camping was crowded with what mostly looked like car campers.  I found a tent spot partly on tree roots.  Plunger and Skippy joined me for dinner, then we went to bed.  Thankfully, it was not noisy.","Morgan Stewart Shelter

There were a few hikers sitting at a picnic table.  I got some trail food for a day and a half, plus a spicy chicken waffle sandwich, kombucha, a tangerine, and a cinnamon roll for breakfast.  I joined the others.  One had already thru hiked the PCT and CDT, so he would be completing the Triple Crown once he finished the AT. I met others, including Bambi and Firefly.  I would see Bambi on and off for the next few days.
Fortified with a good breakfast, I returned to the trail a little before 9.  I passed Mt Algo Shelter and descended to CT 341, where I had a break around noon.  Bambi passed me.
I had a rough time climbing from Macedonia Brook to Caleb's Peak.  The descent was also very slow.  It was very slow going, and ate away at my hope for getting a mid 20 mile day, which angered me.  It also made the swelling in my shin feel worse.
I got down to River Road around 3:00.  I had never felt more relieved to have a road walk.  I enjoyed the views of Housatonic River and grabbed a bottle's worth of water from a stream.  I got to the junction for Stewart Hollow Brook Shelter around 4 where I had a pit stop and a break.  Joker passed me as I was eating.  I took a dose of Aleve.
Just before 5, I decided to press on 6.7 miles to a campsite.  I figured it would take me at most three hours.  Unfortunately, the climb up Silver Hill took a while, as did the climb uphill with the coinciding Pine Knob trail on the way to the campsite.  I arrived there around 8:15. I saw Bambi there.  The water source, bear box, and sites were all pretty close together, so I quickly finished my camp chores and went to bed.","Ten Mile River Campsite

Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665565,"I left camp around 7.  Earlier, I saw two people breaking camp at 4:30.  I thought it might be Plunger and Skippy, but I wasn't sure.  I had a 19 mile day to town, and was looking forward to relaxing.  It will have been 350 miles since I stayed in town 8n Duncannon, PA and 200 miles since my last shower in Delaware Water Gap.
It was a mostly uneventful hike to town.  I did not like the steep climb up to another cracked boulder, but it was neat walking through it once I reached it at 8:30 or so.  I took a break at the Belters Campsite junction around 10:30-11.
As I was walking along down US 7 in Falls Village around 11:30, I passed by a parking area in front of a big building where I suddenly saw an ice cream truck park.  I thought it was probably for the large event, and they wouldn't bother with me.  Still, I wish I would have turned around and walked back a couple minutes to ask.  The day was warming up.  Never turn down ice cream!
About an hour later, I passed by an amazing waterfall in Great Falls Reservoir, the likes I had not seen since Laurel Falls in TN.  That really boosted my mood.  I went up the easy climb to Mt Prospect, and enjoyed the overlook at Billy's/Rand's View in about another hour - probably around 2.  I took a break by a stream for a half hour.
I arrived in Salisbury around 3:30.  After five minutes of walking, I saw Plunger and Skippy at the city hall building, getting water from a spigot.  It was indeed them who were up early at the campsite this morning.  We discussed plans.  I told them about the place I was staying at, which was right in front of us, actually.  Prices to stay in town had gone up a lit, and this place only charged $40 per night.  They said they would think about it while they were resupplying.
I walked over to the home, checked in, took a shower, and got loaner clothes from Ted, a long term tenant.  The woman who owned the home, Vanessa, would be back later to do laundry.  I went over to the supermarket to resupply.  I saw Plunger and Skippy.  They confirmed a reservation where I was staying, so I was looking forward to hanging out with them more.  Then I went into the grocery store.  I made a basic grocery store shopping mistake- going there when you're hungry.  I got at least six days worth of food when I needed four days of food at most, plus food for the night.  On top of that, the grocery store was also pretty expensive.
I returned to the hostel/home.  Joker was there too, staying in the same bedroom as I was.  I learned that the house dates back to the Revolutionary War, that it had been moved, and that Bill Murray had stayed in the bunkroom!  All very fascinating.
I spent the most of the rest of the night chatting at the kitchen table with Plunger, Skippy, Joker, and another guest who was retired and section hiking southbound. I attempted to fix a leak in my sleeping pad, but the tub in the upstairs bathroom was broken, and the water and soap method outside wasn't effective, even with the assistance of another long term tenant.  Then I organized my food and went to bed.","Cesar Brook Campsite

Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665599,"Plunger and Skippy left early.  Joker left around 8.  After days of hiking on a shin with a bit of swelling, I thought it would be a good idea to do a half day.  I also needed to catch up on journal entries.
I got some breakfast at the supermarket and hanged out at that hostel until noon.  Then I was at the hiker square in the center of downtown Salisbury for a couple hours, writing more journal entries and charging my phone.
I was feeling better.  Over the past few days I've been trying to sometimes up or down steep areas on the tips of my feet to take stress off of the left shin.  I bought more Ibuprofen at the supermarket in case problems came up, and started hiking at 2.  Boy, was that pack heavy!  At least six days I could last on that food, plus a liter and a half of water.  I might have been carrying 50 pounds.
There was quite a bit of climbing, but none of the climbs were that bad.  It might have been that I had eaten so well in town, too.  The climb up to Bear Mountain in CT (not to be confused with the one in NY), the highest point in CT, took about 2.5 hours for a little over five miles.  The view was decent.  I took a break there.  The descent was steep, very rocky, and slow.  It was around 5:30 then.
I then passed the CT/MA border and slowly walked through the rocky footpath along Sage's Ravine, a lovely area of cascading brooks, a swimming hole, and a glen.
At 6 I started up Mt Race.  The climb up and down it was pleasant, and I enjoyed the walk along the ridge of the mountain.  Unlike in much of CT, the ridge had more short alpine plants instead of trees, which rewards us hikers with views.
The same was true for Mt Everett, concerning the open ridge, though the climb and descent were much steeper.  I got to the Race Brook Falls Trail junction at 7:30 and took a brief break before the climb up to Mt Everett.  I enjoyed the view at sunset at the summit, and the climb and descent were more fun than Stairway to Heaven in NJ.
The last half mile into the Glen Brook Shelter camping area was easy, but it was now about 9.  It was dark and several people had set up camp.  I found a spot to tent eventually.  I finished my camp chores in twice as much time as I would have liked, because of the dark and having to follow the water source to a more rapidly flowing area.  I finally went to bed around 10:30.","Salisbury

I got a little of both hard and easy.  The first 3.5 miles from the shelter down to MA 41 were rocky and slippery.  It was also scenic, with mountains in a sea of fog at several overlooks.  It took me 90 minutes to get that far.  Worried, I texted Gidget about being late.  She said she would still meet me at 10:30. Luckily, the next 4.5 miles was very easy: mostly level walking through fields and through trees.  I passed by a Shay's Rebellion memorial around 10 and got to Route 7 just after 10:30.  The canister costed $10, but I was worried I'd run out of fuel before I got to Dalton in a couple days.
I took a break and saw Achilles, who I ran into a couple days in NY, on the climb up and down Bear Mountain, and near the Stormville pizzeria with the awesome gelato.  He stayed the night in Great Barrington.  He ran into Plunger and Skippy, and mentioned their stay in Salisbury was not so great.
He left, then I left around 11.  After maybe 45-50 minutes of hiking, near Boardman St just before a steep climb, there was trail magic!  Achilles was there, with other hikers.  I had just eaten about an hour ago, bit that didn't stop me from indulging.  I had a banana, double chocolate muffin, Gatorade, and a homemade snickerdoodle cookie one hiker gave me.
After some brief chatter, I started the steep climb up to East Mountain around noon.  With all the food in me, I didn't mind the climb at all, though part of it was because it was getting cool and cloudy.  I pressed on, and around 1:30, it started to drizzle.  I had just passed Tom Leonard Shelter.  I took another break around 2 at a flat spot.  By then, it was more of a shower.  Several minutes into my break, it became more of a downpour.  I took out my umbrella and tucked all my things under it.
I left around 2:30. The rain continued for about an hour, then became lighter showers as I climbed up from Benedict Pond to The Ledges, around 4:30.  Surprisingly, I could see a bit of a view at the overlook, with clouds rolling across the sky in front of distant mountains.
I had been in a text chat with Plunger on and off -- partly because he had left his rain pack cover at the Salisbury hostel, and I took it with me to return to him.  I knew they had camped near Great Barrington last night.  I passed Mt Wilcox North Shelter around 6, and decided to press on to a campsite a few more miles away.  On my down to Jerusalem Road, I slipped on a steep descent with loose mud.  I had slipped a few times both yesterday and today.
When I got to Jerusalem Rd, around 7:30, I checked my phone.  Plunger and Skippy were headed to the same campsite as I was.  When I got my things together after a short break, I realized I was missing Mt toiletry bag.  I was furious, and thought I might have lost it on that slip a little earlier.  As I went back up the climb, I saw Plunger and Skippy.  They had taken a nap at Mt Wilcox South Shelter while it was raining earlier.  And Plunger had my toiletry bag!  I was grateful, and when we got down to the road, I returned his rain pack cover.
We headed to the campsite around 8.  It started to shower.  We set up our tents and discussed plans for tomorrow.  I cooked dinner in my vestibule, then retired for the night after camp chores.","Glen Brook Shelter

Initially, there was so much water in the trees that it basically felt like steady light showers as I was hiking.  I got to the Tyrringham Rd/Goose Pond trailhead around 9:45 and took a break.  A misty, light actual shower began, so I took out my umbrella.  I was looking forward to the better weather forecasted later that day.  I responded to a text from someone saying I had 650 miles left, which dampened my spirits further.  A trail maintainer with a chainsaw walked by and mentioned he cut through some of the fallen trees blocking the path.  I thanked him.
As I continued up to Upper Goose Pond, the sun came out and it started to warm up.  In a couple hours, I crossed the bridges over I-90 and US 20, past a pretty view of another pond or lake.
In another hour or so, I climbed up Becket Mountain and descended down Walling Mountain, followed the trail which skirted Finerty Pond, and took a break.  To my surprise, Plunger and Skippy showed up.  They had stopped at the Becket Hotel to pick up Plunger's new shoes.  They were replaced free of charge by a warranty; they had broken down in just 300 miles, with the Pennsylvania rocks being the major issue.  We chatted for a bit and they headed off again.
I hiked another uneventful, but easy six miles, to Washington Mountain Rd, where I arrived around 5.  I followed signs to the Cookie Lady Homestead, just a minute or so down the road.  I read in the guide that they offer free cookies and lemonade to hikers, plus potential berry picking, dinner, and camping.
I saw Plunger and Skippy there, as well as three other hikers there: 700, Bear Bait, and All Along.  The actual cookie lady was not present, but her son Carl and another young lady was there.  We chatted for a bit.  Plunger and Skippy wanted to weed for dinner.  On the other hand, it was a relatively easy 6.5 miles to the next shelter.  Initially, I wasn't sure what to do.  But then I took off my boots and socks -- I do this on pretty much all my breaks -- and was delighted by the touch of the soft grass.  The lemonade and cookies were great too.  The three others left around 5:30.
By 6, I had decided to help weed blueberry bushes with Plunger and Skippy for dinner, which we did for about an hour.  Then I pitched my tent.  Carl made some excellent burgers with a large salad with perfectly light dressing for the three of us.  It was all absolutely delicious.  I had a couple cookies for dessert.  Plunger and Skippy decided to sleep in a bus on the property.  During twilight, I joined them in it to chat until dusk, then went to bed.  Much better experience than arriving to a crowded shelter at 8:30.","Shaker Campsite

Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665750,"I left at 6:15, a half hour after Plunger and Skippy.  Pleasant weather forecasted until evening.  I took a quick 5 minute break at the Kay Wood Shelter junction around 8:45 for a quick snack, then got to the center of Dalton around 10:15, where I saw Plunger and Skippy.  They were headed out shortly after a quick bite at the Cumberland Farm. 
I ate breakfast at the Java and Juice a minite or two away -- bagel breakfast sandwich and muffin while uploading photos.  I stopped at Cumberland Farm on the way back for a few breakfast bars, a beef stick, chocolate protein/vitamin drink, a salad, and yogurt.
I left around 12:30.  I passed by Gore Pond in about 90 minutes and saw an overlook of the Hoosic River Valley and the town of Cheshire in about another hour.
I got to Cheshire around 4:15, and saw Diane's Twist, a cash only ice cream shop right on the trail!  They also sell other food, but I was there for the ice cream.  This time I did it right, with three scoops of ice cream on a waffle cone: moose tracks, peanut butter cup with a chocolate base, and dark chocolate raspberry truffle.  It was only $5!  Completely satisfied with the three scoops, and can't believe I was getting my ice cream wrong for so long.
I also stopped by the local outfitter for freeze dried meals.  It seemed focused on fishing, with just two Mountain House lasagna meals left.  I grabbed one.
I began the slow climb up to the shelter, which stages hikers for the Mt Greylock summit, just before 5.  It started to shower after maybe a half hour on the climb up.  By the time I arrived to the shelter, around 7:30, it was steadily raining.  I went to the group campsite area and saw Punger and Skippy tents there.  I pitched mine nearby.  I cooked dinner in the tent vestibule again, and fell asleep.","Cookie Lady Homestead

Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665978,"It rained all night long.  There were some noises in the middle of the night that kept me up, like a truck engine running on the gravel road just before the shelter junction.  I think I might have got three hours of sleep.  The rain continued as I was getting ready in my tent, around 6:30.  Plunger and Skippy were uncharacteristically still in their tents.  The rain stopped as I was ready to take down my tent.  That helped a little, but the tent was still soaked.
I started hiking around 7:30. The remaining climb up to Mt Greylock had some ups and downs.  There was some water falling from trees shaken by the wind.  It was chilly.  I reached the summit around 9, with no view in the heavy mist, and went to the nearby Bascom Lodge -- about a minute's walk away -- for breakfast.  They had scrambled eggs, bacon, toast, yogurt with fruit, and home fries for $12 - that was a winner.  I also added hot tea and a blueberry muffin.
I was warming up and charging my device there for a little over an hour, then continued down the other side of the mountain around 10.  It remained misty at first, but gradually cleared up.  Still, everything was wet.  Shortly after I passed the 1600 mile mark, I slipped on wooden planks and fell on my pack.  About 6.5 miles and 3.5 hours later, I arrived to MA 2. 
The guide showed a Stop and Shop supermarket a half mile west.  I went there and bought some healthy trail snacks, plus yogurt, salad, and kombucha for lunch.  While I was shopping, I ran into Plunger, and we had lunch together outside under the shelter of the strip mall, while it showered.  They gave me a fried chicken leg.  I said that I wasn't sure about making it all the way to Congdon Shelter, but didn't want settle for 12 miles to the Sherman Brook campsite either.  Skippy showed me discussion of a new shelter people could stay at, with a privy.  It was about 9 miles further.  I decided to shoot for that.  She said it was after two powerlines past a country road, and if I made it to a pond, I had gone too far.
I pressed on around 2:30 when I finished lunch.  Plunger and Skippy decided to continue lunch at a picnic area.  It was a long climb up to a ridge, about 1500 feet of climbing in four miles.  There was a long, steep climb up scattered rocks in showers.  I got to the MA/VT border around 5, starting northbound on the coinciding Long Trail with the AT.
I had heard that there is a lot of mud in Vermont.  In fact, some on the AT called it Vermud.  It was a downpour now, and not at all surprising to find mud.  There were many wide areas with mud on the trail.  My feet were already soaked, so I just took the mud with stride.  At one point, there was a path around the wide footpath of mud.  I ignored it and when I walked through, my boot fell shin deep into the mud.
I passed a closed shelter around 6:30 - right after a break.  I made it to the country road and passed the powerlines around 8.  It was pouring on and off with steady showers.  The wind picked up through the powerline crossings.  It was miserable, but mere misery turned into a matter of survival.   I was getting cold, but not shivering, and was concernedthat I would get hypothermia.
I finally made it to the new shelter around 8:30. There were no campsites there, and six people were asleep in the shelter.  They made room for me.  I changed to dry clothes in the privy, tripped on some mud on my way back to the shelter, ate, and streamlined camp chores.  I fell asleep around 10.","Mark Noepel Shelter

Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665979,"I slept surprisingly well, and started packing up at 6:30.  Getting into my wet hiking clothes was very unpleasant.  I started at 8:15. I was amused to hear others in the shelter talk out the day, possibly hiking just 4.2 miles to the next shelter, Congdon Shelter - depending on how shitty the trail would be.
The day became sunny, but the trail was muddy and my boots and feet were wet all day.  I stopped for a breakfast break at Congdon Shelter around 11 and met a couple section hikers.  I descended to VT 9 around 1 -- a frustratingly slow rocky descent over the last half mile -- and took a break a half hour later, on my climb up Little Pond Mountain.  As I continued further, I was pleased to no longer get see much mud, at least for now.  Hiking was becoming pleasant, though my feet were still very wet.  They were wrinkly after I removed my boots at each break.
I took another break just before the Goddard Shelter, on the way up to Glastenbury Tower, around 5.  I made a pit stop at Goddard Shelter around 6:30.
After observing that the Glastenbury Shelter was closed, I hiked another four pretty easy miles or so to Kid Gore Shelter, where I arrived a little before 8:30.  There is a view there - nothing special, but still a nice plus.  I did my chores and went to sleep around 10.","New Unnamed Shelter

Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665981,"I left around 8.  Just a few minutes into my hike, I stumbled and cursed.  Someone up ahead asked me if I was OK.  Yes, sure, I was fine, but hate being slowed down by things like that.  As I walked forward more, I realized it was Plunger and Skippy.  They had camped at Glastenbury Tower last night - I saw a nice spot with a fire ring there when I passed it.  They were taking a water break, so I pressed on.
After one minor climb, I descended easy terrain to a gravel road around 10:20, and passed three young ladies with an accent who were taking a break.  Shortly after that, I took my own break.  It was a little muddy, and the flies were annoying.  I should have joined them instead of sticking to my 2.5 hour minimum hiking window before a break.  They passed me, and Plunger and Skippy caught up too - I take long breaks.  Skippy said the three women are from New Zealand, and that she knew one through her mother, I think.  She calls them the kiwis, after the New Zealand native bird 
I continued with my break, and left around 11:15. I began the long climb up Stratton Mountain, and got to the lookout tower a little before 2.  There were crowds of people there: thru hikers, day hikers, section hikers, Long Trail hikers, etc.  Plunger, Skippy, and the kiwis were there.  My wet feet were bothering me.  After climbing up the tower and enjoying the view, I took a lunch break and chatted on and off with people.
I descended the mountain, which was rocky at first, but then got easier. I got to the Stratton Pond Shelter junction around 3:45.  The AT guide indicated this shelter junction, as well as a trail to a campsite, then the actual pond.  I figured would just walk to that third point to enjoy what I heard is a great view.  However, as I kept walking past the shelter junction   I never saw it.  I pulled out Gaia GPS, and it showed the trail going further away from the pond.  I was so disappointed that I felt a little sick.  I focused on getting to Spruce Peak Shelter, and took a break around 5:30.  Plunger and Skippy said hello and we discussed staying at the shelter.  I told them that I needed to get into Manchester tomorrow to resupply, and knew that they had already heavily resupplied at that stop and Shop a couple days earlier.
I passed by William B.  Douglas Shelter around 6:30, then a road walk for a mile or so.  After one last minor climb, I got to the shelter around 7:30.  Plunger and Skippy were nowhere to be found.  This was understandable, because the shelter was full, and there was a group of about 20 overnight backpackers there.  I was spent, especially with my wet feet.  I was on my third day of wet feet, and the boots, always wet and muddy over the three days, were chafing my toes.
I set up my tent and ate dinner.  I discovered my bowl was punctured.  I met a couple hikers who came in late, around 9: Sprout and Amy, from New York.  Sprout is hiking the last 600 miles of the AT.  She attempted a truck hike last year, but was injured while hiking through the White Mountains.  Amy is tagging along for a smaller section.
I finished up my camp chores, and went to sleep around 9:30.  Thankfully, the overnight backpackers were not noisy.","Kid Gore Shelter

Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665982,"I left around 7.  I knew I wanted to spend a lot of time relaxing in Manchester during my resupply.  On my way out, I met another thru hiker.
A little past 8, I got to VT highways 11 and 30.  I walked less than five minutes before I got a hitch into Manchester, but I was lucky.  I met thru hikers Easy Street and Ringo in the car.  We had breakfast together at Charlie's Cafe.  I think I might have eaten too much, but it was all delicious: breakfast panini with egg, bacon, spinach, and tomato; ham and apple quiche; and a large maple walnut muffin.  Yum!
I headed over to the laundromat- pretty much all the businesses downtown are within a half mile of each other.  They gave me loaner clothes, so I wouldn't have to walk around on a hot day with a down jacket and rain pants, which could also could use a wash.  Very kind of them.
I got groceries while my clothes were washing, and returned to the laundromat.   Got to recharge my phone, and ate half a bag of baby spinach leaves, yogurt, fruit, and kombucha.  I organized my resupply.  I was hoping to also get more journal entries complete, but ran out of time.
By now, it was noon.  It was sunny and hot, but that meant my boots, which I tied to my pack as I walked through town in sandals, were going to be drier.  I stopped at the outfitter and got a new bowl, plus trail snacks and freeze dried meals.  I was hoping to take a shower at the parks and recreation building, but it was too far away, too hot, and I wanted to get back on trail.  I ate a 12 inch pizza with white sauce, chicken, jalapeños, and tomatoes at Manchester Pizza.  I also got two scoops of ice cream in a waffle cone for dessert: Moose Tracks and Peanut Butter Cup.
I started walking to the edge of town towards the trailhead around 3.  I completely forgot about stopping at the Ben and Jerry's shop instead of getting Hershey's ice cream... oh well. I walked on the highway outside of town for about 10 minutes, then someone stopped!  It was a guy I met back when I was in Cheshire, MA, getting ice cream at Diane's Twist.
We chatted and then after he dropped me off at the parking lot, he said he ran into Plunger, Skippy, and the kiwis two hours ago on his AT day hike up to Bromley Mountain - where I was headed.  He also noted a well sloped climb with little mud.  To make things even better, a day hiker who just finished hiking gave me three granola bars!  I started up the trail around 3:15.  In dryish boots, hiking was a lot more fun, and I enjoyed the climb up to Bromley Mountain.  There is an excellent view at the top.  Since another face of the mountain is a ski slope, there is a chairlift there with additional views.
I left around 4:45, descended to a gravel road after an hour, then started the next climb up Peru Peak.  I arrived there around 7.  No view, but there was one on the way up.  I descended past the shelter, where the guide indicates an overnight fee, and went a few minutes further to what I thought is a scenic camping area off of Griffith Lake, arriving there around 8.
The tent sites were all on wooden platforms, which I guess is supposed to be helpful against the mud.  Still, it seems like they're designed for freestanding tents, not like my Durston XMid 1, which uses trekking poles and stakes to stay up.  I got it up though, with some help from a small piece of a birch log.
I finished up my camp chores and retired around 9:30.","Spruce Peak Shelter

Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665983,"I left around 7:30.  I passed by the scenic Baker Peak around 8:45, then continued past a couple shelters.  There were three different groups on the trail near Big Branch today - it's a cool rapid near a road.  A group of about 20 people with a bunch of kids let me and another group pass, then I passed the other group.  We passed by some day hikers too.  I took a break around 10, and the small backpacking group passed me again.
After reaching a trailhead with a lot of cars parked, I continued up towards Little Rock Pond, arriving there around 11:30. I enjoyed the walk around the pond.
Once I left it, I got close to two older day hikers/overnight campers who were taking advantage of the tradition of the summer solstice to hike in their birthday suits.  I had no desire to do that.  Aside from self-consciousness, it seemed like it would be a chafing nightmare for backpackers.  Not so bad for day hikers, I guess.
I walked for another couple hours to a junction with White Rocks Cliffs, a view point.  On my way, I ran into a group of at least a couple dozen day hikers, again in their birthday suits. As a group, they had the right of way whichever way they went.  I had no desire to watch them go by, so I stepped off the trail and hiked with my eyes averted.  They were friendly, and I was frustrated.
There were many delightful cairns constructed along the way to the White Rock Cliff junction.  I really needed a break. When I saw that the trail was all downhill, I decided, no thank you, and turned back to the junction.  I enjoyed my break by the cairns at the junction, around 3. Maybe if I ever return to hike the Long Trail, I will make sure to see this view.  That and Stratton Pond.
I continued down to VT 140, and got there around 4:30.  On the way, I enjoyed another rapid. I saw signs for trail magic!  I continued on and saw two guys starting to pack up.  The saw me and stopped.  Thank goodness, because I was a lot hungrier than I thought.  One of them.made me a hot dog, and I had three large slices of watermelon.  I had around 10 double stuf Oreos, 5 chewy Chips Ahoy cookies, another 5 Fig Newtons, a bottle of Gatorade, and a bag of chips.  And I got a free small tube of toothpaste.  They said they do this once a week.  It's very generous of them, and lucky for me.  I helped them pack up a tad.
Around 5, I continued up Bear Mountain (this one is in VT!), took a pit stop at Minerva Hinchey Shelter around 6:30, then continued on to the next shelter.  I loved seeing more rapids in the Clarendon Gorge as I crossed a suspension bridge.  Shortly thereafter, I had a rough, steep, rocky climb that I liked a lot less.

In another hour, I took a break at Governor Clement Shelter.  A couple from PA hiking southbound was there too, and soon the kiwis joined us.  A hiker from Boston whom I first saw at Stratton Mountain apparently spent the night with them in Rutland too.
I started the four mile climb up to Killington Peak.  I got there around noon, walked packless up to the peak, and took a short break to enjoy the great views.
The AT in VT has spotty phone service, so I took this opportunity at the top of a tall mountain to make a reservation at a hostel in Hanover, where I expected to arrive in a couple days.  There was solid rain in the forecast Saturday, as well as several days beyond that.  I wanted to get out of the rain that day and relax.
At 12:30, I continued on.  I descended down to US 4 around 4.  I took a break after climbing to Maine Junction, where the AT and the Long Trail split.  Then, around 5:15, I descended to Gifford Woods State Park.  The kiwis and company were staying there for the Wi-Fi and showers, but I wanted to press on after a short break there to upload photos, empty trash, and wash myself in the restroom.  The ranger also had free icy squeezes by the office.
With the weather forecast showing showers in the afternoon tomorrow, and these northern states restricting where people can camp, I wanted to get a solid day in tomorrow between shelters.  The way to do that without a low mileage day meant a long day today, due to a longer gap between Winturri and Thistle Hill shelters.
For that reason, I pressed on around 6.  I passed by scenic Kent Pond and Thundering Falls, then started a 1200 foot climb up to Quinby Mountain.  About a half hour later, I was going up and down the ridge for another hour, and saw Plunger and Skippy at a makeshift campsite.  We chatted, and I told them my plans to get out of the rain.  Then, I continued on to Stony Brook Shelter.  I got there around 9, and after camp chores, fell asleep around 10:30.","Clarendon Shelter

I hiked up and down five hills, with one mile of flat, to VT 12.  With no views, I found those climbs unrewarding.
I arrived to VT 12 around noon.  I read about a farmstead just down the road that was open today, and decided to stop there for lunch.  Great idea!  The lady there had everything for hikers: cold beverages, personal fruit pies and other baked goods, fresh and packaged cheeses and meats, fruits, and vegetables, plus an array of resupply items.  She also had a spigot and port-o-potty, plus many places to sit with flowers everywhere.  I got a banana, yogurt, soda water, ice cream sundae, apple, and personal blueberry and peach pie to generously extend my planned lunch food.  It was so lovely that I stayed there for well over an hour.
I returned to the trail around 1:30.  I had nine miles to go to the shelter.  I counted six more climbs on the elevation profile.  The first three climbs weren't so bad, which I completed in maybe 90 minutes.  I dipped my hat in a stream to cool off a couple times.  The fourth climb was very steep -- 600 feet gain in 0.4 miles -- and started to make me agitated.  There were at least a couple views, though.  Around 4, after descending from the fifth climb, I took an extended break at Cloudland Rd to get some more electrolytes and other food.  Then I made the last climb.  It wasn't so bad, but after all the other climbs, I just wanted to be done.
I got to the shelter around 5:30.  The forecast called for rain in early morning, which was expected to continue all day tomorrow.  I didn't want to break down my tent in that when I was arriving in town the next day, so I decided to sleep in the shelter.  Since I arrived much earlier than I usually do, I met and chatted with a bunch of hikers during dinner.  The privy has a window around the top of it, which was a nice plus.  I retired around 9, after completing chores.","Stony Brook Shelter

After another mile of road walking, I went through one climb and then rolling terrain -- six miles -- until I arrived at the outskirts of Norwich, around 11.   By then it had started to drizzle.  Then more road walking through Norwich, over the Connecticut River where I passed into New Hampshire, then finally to Hanover, around noon.  It was now a light shower,  on and off.
I walked by The Greens of Dartmouth, then headed down Main St.  I had read Lou's bakery and restaurant give a free donut or muffin to thru hikers.  I got a delicious, free large chocolate oatmeal raisin cookie!  It was a half hour wait for lunch, so I ate at Molly's instead.  I got a cup of butternut squash curry soup with a teriyaki breaded chicken and broccoli bowl, which was amazing.  The server even gave me some amazing bread and butter with my meal and always kept my water and soda water full.
Then I headed over to Ramunto's Brick Oven Pizza, whereI read thru hikers get a free slice of pizza.  I got a free slice of delicious cheese pizza that they baked for me, which I drank with a bottle of chocolate milk.
By now it was about 1:30.  I headed down Lebanon St.  As I passed the Dartmouth football stadium, it started to pour.  I quickly went over to the food co-op to get a few days' worth of a resupply, plus food for tonight and the morning.
I was so glad I wasn't hiking in this weather, but I knew plenty, including friends I had made, were suffering through it.  I knew they would be okay, but it still sucks.
It was now about 2.  I called the Hanover Adventure Tours and Hostel, where I called to make a reservation the other day.  They said they would pick me up within a hour.  Under a sheltered dining area, I organized my resupply and drank a kombucha and drinkable yogurt while ithe downpour continued.
The guy on the phone swang by in about a half hour, and drove me to the hostel, which is actually in Norwich.  It was a pretty large area, with two bathroom, a large bunk dorm, large living room, and open kitchen.  I checked in and put my perishables in the fridge, then got loaner clothes, took a shower, and did laundry.

After a steep climb up to the Velvet Rocks Shelter, the trail mellowed out for some miles.  After a couple hours, I saw a trail magic cooler with homemade cookies and brownies!  Grabbed a couple with a short break, then hiked up and down Moose Mountain, not a bad climb or view.  I took a pit stop and break at the Moose Mountain Shelter around 11.
It was not a bad climb down, and the weather forecast continued to improve; it looked like it would not start raining until at least 5.  That said, it was pretty humid.  The climb up to Holts Ledge was very steep, and I was sweating a lot.  I got to the overlook around 1:30, then continued down pretty easy terrain for the next few miles past Trapper John Shelter, Dorchester Rd, Grant Brook -- great rapids there after all the rain -- to Lyme Dorchester Rd.
While I was taking a break there around 4:15, a lady showed up and asked me if I wanted a popsicle.  Of course!  Her name is Teresa, originally from Hanover, PA.  She gave me an orange creamsicle, which I loved.  We chatted.  She said her son, trailname Boom, through hiked the AT a few years ago and then the PCT the year after.  He got his name because he kept saying boom while fireworks were going off on July 4 when he was in the Whites.  She said she hadn't seen many thru hikers.  I guessed it was because of the rainy forecast, coupled with the miserable downpour yesterday.  She gave me another creamsicle (yes!), I thanked her, and she headed out.
Just before 5, I began the climb up Smart Mountain.  It was rocky and steep.  I passed a couple section hikerswhile going through Lambert's Ridge, then met Backoff later on.  He's flip flop thru hiker from the Raleigh area, and retired from the Marine Corps, who started at Harpers Ferry.  The last climb up to the summit was brutal, but I made it up there around 7.  I climbed up the fire tower and saw amazing views.

The climb up to the summit of Mt Moosilauke took me about 4 hours.  I had been warned that there would be limited visibility and 40mph gusts, which was accurate.  There were no views, and there was some drizzle.
On my way down to the Beaver Brook Shelter, a few hikers from the hostel last night passed by me.  The drizzle had turned to a light shower.  Some were slackpacking, but there was also one backpacker - I tend to move very slowly on steep, wet, rocky descents.  I got to the shelter around 11:45, where I found others who had passed me.  Backoff also showed up.  I took a break with them in the shelter, and started the even steeper, rockier descent to NH 112.  It followed a waterfall down, which was pretty, but made me nervous with how wet it was.
I made it down the mile and a half to the road by 1, then started the climb up to Mt Wolf. My knees hated me.  The showers became steady, and the climb up was muddy with many stretches of ankle deep water on the trail.  It was chilly, and I was moving very slowly.  I think I hiked about 3.3 miles in about three hours.
I took a break around 4:30 and called The Notch Hostel to make a reservation for tomorrow.  I would only have about nine miles on trail, but based on how I was doing today, I could use a break.
I still had about four miles to hike to the shelter.  It started to rain, then there were a few downpours that lasted for several minutes.  During one of them, I screamed at the top of my lungs in anguish.  It was a miserable day.
I pressed on and made it to the shelter around 7.  The shelter was completely full, and many had already taken tent spots.  I found a relatively flat spot, but had to spread the base of my tent over a large rock and some roots.  It downpoured most of the time while I set up my tent.  I got into my dry clothes after getting my pad inflated, then got water and cooked dinner in my vestibule.  I finished up camp chores, and turned in around 10.","NH 25

Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666180,"It is always unpleasant to break down camp when your tent and hiking clothes are drenched.  I wringed out my clothes for the second time before putting them on, then started hiking a little past 8.  While it would just be a nine mile day, I would be hiking over the Kinsman Twins, two 4000 footers, so that would slow things down.
The climb up to South Kinsman was rocky and, had some scrambles I would have appreciated more without the showers.  There was water runoff going down the trail most of the way up.  I passed a pond area, where even the wooden planks were submerged.  I got to the summit around 11, then to the North Kinsman summit an hour later, which featured rock slabs.
There were a lot of steep rock slabs on the way down too, on which I took my time.  Plenty of stream crossings were overflowing with water, and the runoff went down the trail.
I got to Lonesome Lake Hut around 2:30, and took a break.  I got some soup and a brownie, plus some free old bread and leftover oatmeal from breakfast.  Max Heap and Backoff stopped in later.  It was surprisingly busy there; a few small groups of day hikers and one large group.
I continued down to Franconia Notch at 2.  The trail mellowed out a lot, but it was raining.  I bumped into some people who were curious about my journey on this cold, rainy day, but I indulged them.  They warned me about a stream crossing coming up that was a little beyond waist deep for one thru hiker they saw.  I thanked them and continued on.
When I got to that stream crossing, Max Heap and a hiker new to me, who I later would learn has the trailname Skip, caught up with me.  Skip and I found an alternate path across, while Max Heap forded through, with water reaching his waist.
We hiked together to Flume Visitors Center, arriving there around 3.  A few other thru hikers who had slackpacked were there from the Notch Hostel, and they had already called for a ride.  I grabbed some food and snacks quickly.
The van showed up, we piled in, and headed to the hostel.  I checked in, got loaner clothes took a shower, and put my clothes in the laundry.  Many of us took a free ride into the Lincoln Price Chopper to resupply through the next fifty miles, and get food for the night.
The rest of the day I spent eating, chatting, catching up on journal entries, or web surfing and napping.","Eliza Brook Shelter

Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666441,"I woke up at The Notch Hostel around 5 without an alarm, relaxed, made pancakes, ate a big breakfast, took another shower, and caught up on my journal entries.  The next free, scheduled  drop off to the Flume VC was at 11.  The forecast was looking partly cloudy with no rain and the weather was pleasant at the hostel, so I got my backpack ready.
I got there around 11:30, ate more bread and cream cheese, and then headed up the long climb to the Liberty Springs Campsite at 12:30, and got there around 2.
I decided to press on to the next campsite- another 7 or 8 miles.  I was hoping to see some views on Franconia Ridge on a somewhat decent day of weather, with an overcast sky.  No luck.  It was foggy the whole way.  I ran into a group of about ten young adult hikers on my way there and took a break with them around 3.  Shortly thereafter, it started to shower lightly, but stopped around 4.
I'd been here before, when I backpacked the Pemi loop with DCUL in 2016 - several years ago.  I can't believe how the time passes!  Back then, it was a clear, pleasant Columbus Day weekend, and Franconia Ridge was amazing.  I hardly could walk for a minute without taking a panorama.  
The climb up to Franconia Ridge was steep, but not too taxing.  Nor were the climbs up and down Mt Lincoln and Mt Lafayette while on the ridge.  It was the climb through Garfield Ridge that was unpleasant, which I started around 5.  Multiple steep decents and climbs on rocky terrain, with multiple rock slabs that were wet from yesterday.  It was easy to slip and fall, so I had to move slowly.
I made it to Mt Garfield around 7, then to the Garfield Ridge Campsite in another 20 minutes.  In the White Mountains, the walks off the AT to these campsites are a chore.
I spoke with the caretaker, who gave me and Seeker -- an older thru hiker different from the young Seeker I met in PA -- a spiel on etiquette at AMC campsites.  It's basically the same as it is with other designated campsites: use bear cables or bear boxes, cook in designated area, nothing but TP in the privy.  The difference is that they are dry composting privies, so you are asked to pee in the woods, away from people and water.  He asked for $10 fee for thru hikers instead of the typical $15, and gave us AMC discount card thru hiker passes.  After that, the fee is half off at all the other campsites with the pass, plus you get two free baked goods, a bowl of soup, and discounts from other places like the Highland Center near Crawford Notch, and the Pinkham Notch Visitor Center.
I shared a tent platform with a couple, finished up my camp chores, and turned in around 10.","Franconia Notch

Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666442,"I started hiking back on the AT at 6:45.  I had a long day planned to take advantage of a day where it would clear up, and try to get to Pinkham Notch before the rain was forecasted to start in a couple days.
Just a few minutes past the campsite, I encountered what I thought was an annoying, vigorously flowing downhill stream crossing over jagged rocks.  To my dismay, this stream was actually rain runoff on the trail.  I had to hike down this,  which took a long while.  I was still on Garfield Ridge, and on the Pemi loop route that I hiked several years ago, but it was tougher on wet rocks and sloshing through mud slop.
I reached Galehead Hut around 8:30ish and took a half hour break, eating egg, bacon, and oatmeal breakfast leftovers, and a free piece of applesauce cake using the thru hiker pass.
It was starting to get sunny as I climbed up South Twin.  I remember how tough it was on the Pemi loop -- though that time I had started at Liberty Springs Campsite and climbed it  --  and had eaten plenty beforehand.  Despite being one of the top ten steepest ascents from the AT and PCT, the 1100 ft climb over 0.8 miles didn't feel that bad.  I was also rewarded my first great view in the White Mountains when I reached the summit, around 40 minutes later.
From there I pressed on to Zealand Falls Hut for another nice break.  I reexperienced the great view at the Bondcliff Trail junction, around 11.  I skipped the treed-in Zealand summit, but I nabbed it when I did the Pemi loop.  The remaining stretch to Zealand Falls was relatively mild, but still wet and muddy in many spots.
I got to Zealand Falls Hut around 12:30 or 1 and had lunch.  By then, it was sunny and warm.  I met Firetower, who was drying his tent and other gear outside the hut.  I also met Howdya, who always asks how people got their trail names.  I also learned the name of Brute, a hiker I ran into when I was climbing up Mt Wolf and the Eliza Brook Shelter 2-3 days ago. I supplemented my trail lunch with a free bowl of lentil soup, free leftover pancake, and free piece of blueberry cake using my pass.
I headed out around 1:30 and caught a glimpse of the lovely Zealand Falls.  The trail became very mild, and I was relieved.  It even became scenic and mild, with no mud, as I passed by an overlook of Ethan Pond.  I was starting to really enjoy hiking again!
This bliss continued until a bit before the Ethan Pond Campsite junction, a couple hours later.  The trail was still pretty flat, but I was heading into a swampy area.  It was pretty, but there was too much mud and water.  I slipped a couple times on the wooden planks into the mud, and was angry.
I continued past the junction, aiming to start on the Presidential Range tonight.  The descent down to Crawford Notch was relatively easy, and I made it down there around 4:30.  I took a half hour break.  Brute passed me, with the same goal in mind.
I started the ascent up to Webster Cliffs at 5.  The climb was slow and long, but I knew it would be.  I had no problem with the climb up, and made it there around 6.  Brute set up camp at an excellent dry, flat stealth spot.  There was another space where I could camp, but I didn't think I had enough water.  I chatted with Brute at the overlook, and he even took my photo - I didn't even think to ask to take one for him. Pretty selfish... hopefully I can return the favor for him some other time.
Retrospectively, I wish I would have camped there.  It was a long climb up and down multiple rock slabs through false summits between Mt Webster and Mt Jackson to Mitzpah Spring Hut, next to which the Nauman Campsite is.  In addition to that, there was a lot of mud slop to slosh through.  And to top it all off, it was foggy once I got on the ridge, so next to no views.
I finally arrived to the hut at 9:45.  I used up my free goods discounts, and bought a delicious, cakey brownie, and a coconut bar, and ate a bunch of snacks.  I chatted with the Tom, who I thinknis the main caretaker for the hut, while I ate.
Then, relying on a clear forecast, I cowboy camped that night on a shared tent platform in the tentsite.  After some streamlined chores, I turned in around 11:30.","Garfield Ridge Campsite

Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666445,"My alarm went off at 5:30.  I hadn't checked sunrise time, and was pleasantly surprised to see the sunrise wrap up as I deflated my sleeping pad and started to break down camp.  The dun was completely visible, so it seemed to be clearing up from last night.
I went to the hut for another one of those big cakey brownies and tea with a BelVita bar for breakfast, then put on my muddy, wet hiking shoes to finish up the AT through the Presidential Range.
I started hiking a bit past 7.  I climbed up Mt Pierce, then saw great views.  I decided to climb Mt Eisenhower, which is off trail.  Unfortunately, it was foggy at the summit, and it took a good half hour to do that out and back.  While hiking and going off trail a few times, I met Mountain Drew, a thru hiker, and a guy from NY nabbing the NH 4000 footers and doing a Hut to Hut hike, who said he wanted to thru hike the AT someday.
Mist started to roll in as I hiked.  Views of the Whites started to become more of a silhouette.  While I knew there would be no view, I nabbed Mt Franklin, an unofficial 4000 footer due to lack of prominence, for kicks.  That was just a couple minutes off trail.
I went up the Mt Monroe Loop Trail to nab Mt Monroe, but with the time consuming rock scramble, I was starting to get worried about losing time while bagging my missing NH 48 4000 footers.  I don't think I made it up all the way, and it was foggy anyway, so I returned to the AT.  I decided to skip the rest of the peaks off trail, and save them for a Hut to Hut hike in the future.  Hopefully it would be in better conditions, and not part of a thru hike.
I arrived to Lake of The Clouds Hut around 11. I stayed there for an hour.  I ate pea soup, free pancake, egg, and oatmeal leftovers, and a piece of applesauce cake.  It was wonderful to have such a feast for lunch, even though I had only hiked 4.6 miles on the AT.  I was even more compelled now to skip the off trail peaks to get through the range today, with relatively good weather.
I left around noon for the climb up to Mt Washington.  The mile and a half took me about 45 minutes.   The sky was clearing up again, and it was getting pretty crowded with Hut to Hut hikers and visitors who took the cog rail train up to the Mt Washington summit.  There were good views atop Mt Washington, but it was swarming with non hiker tourists.  There was a long line of people waiting to have their picture taken at the summit.  I was about twenty feet below it, and have already taken my picture there as recently as NYE last year, so I pressed on.
The sky was clear, and it was sunny.  I enjoyed the views.  Occasionally, the AT path became unclear because of a lack of blazes or signs.  It continued to warm, the ridge walk was still strenuous, and I passed by many Hut to Hut hikers.  Most were friendly, but I missed being on my own on the trail.  Still, the views more than made up for it, and my feet, socks, and shoes were finally dry.
I took a half hour break just past the Gulfside Spring junction around 2:30, then another hour break when I got to the Madison Spring Hut around 4.  I ate two pieces of pumpkin chocolate chip cake with tea.
I decided it would be worse to pay $94 for a bunk at Joe Dodge Lodge than camp a few miles from Pinkham Notch at Osgood Tentsite.  I could grab an AYCE breakfast at the Visitor Center in the morning if I left early enough, plus I wanted to get there before the forecasted for tomorrow started.   The first three miles to that notch went up Mt Madison, with good views despite returning in and out mist, then a steep,  rocky descent back below treeline.  I arrived at Osgood Tentsite around 7:30, finished up chores, and set my alarm for 4:30.","Nauman Tentsite

Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666751,"My alarm went off at 4:30, and I started at 5:45, to avoid as much of the forecasted rain as possible - hopefully for at least the first 4.7 miles to Pinkham Notch.  It was forecasted to start around 7 or 8, but about halfway there, around 6:25, it started to drizzle.  That turned to showers by the time I arrived to the Visitor's Center around 8.  There was plenty of mud and stream crossings, so my feet were soaked by the time I got there.  It was chilled by the rain by then, too.
I got a few trail snacks and the AYCE buffet.  It was wonderful: four pieces of French toast, two pancakes, half plate of scrambled eggs, two sausage patties, couple slices of bacon, two quarter plates of home fries, big bowl of oatmeal, two bowls of cereal, half plate of yogurt and granola, and four cups of tea.  Aside from hiker hunger, I missed being able to eat whatever I wanted for breakfast, so I took some of everything! I hope I never take meals for granted again.  I stayed at the Visitor's Center for two hours while enjoying breakfast and watching the rainfalI through the window.
I was uncomfortably stuffed, and saw that the showers had stopped for a bit.  I started out again at 10, enjoying the view at Lost Pond before the long, difficult  climb up and through Wildcat Ridge.  Showers started again not long after I started climbing.
I had hiked this stretch of AT from Pinkham Notch to Mt Moriah on a mostly clear, pleasant Columbus Day weekend in 2018.  It was part of a long loop with trails through Wild River and the Baldface mountains.  While difficult, I found the climbing to be interesting, with excellent views.  For that reason, I was looking forward to reexperiencing some of the pleasure I experienced that weekend.
There were several steep rock scrambles to get to the first Wildcat Peak.  I was fortunate to get a few views, despite the rain.  After more steep rock scrambles, I arrived to the second Wildcat peak, where the ski gondola is, around 12:30.  The fog moved in, and the views went away.
After summiting two more Wildcat peaks on the ridge, I descended down steep rocks and slippery rock slabs to Carter Notch Hut junction.  It was just after 3.  I was drenched and felt chilled, so I headed to the hut.  I could hardly see the pond nearby, and the spur to the hut was rocky and muddy.  I got inside and wringed out my socks, like all breaks, in the vestibule.  I met Grit and K Dawg, who were allowed a work for stay at the hut.  Grit was actually my tent platform mate last night at Osgood.
I stayed there for about an hour.  In addition to some of my own trail snacks, I ate three bowls of free scrambled eggs and two pancakes from breakfast.  I also had tea, and took a free sample of trail mix.  I chatted with Grit and K Dawg.  They are both from MA - Grit works from Greater Boston, and K Dawg from Adams.
I was about as warmed up as I could get, so I decided to press on to the Imp Campsite - another 7 miles.  I started a little after 4.  It was still raining.  Hiking up to Carter Dome took about an hour.  There was no view.  The hike up Mt Hight and down to Zeta Pass was chilly, windy, and wet, but that also took an hour.  I was hopeful.  I continued on over and down Middle Carter Mountain.  I was feeling displeased with the wet descents on the slippery rock slabs.  I slipped and fell more than seemed reasonable, and I sloshed through lots of ankle to shin deep puddles of mud slop.  At one point, I lost the bottom of my trekking pole in the mud, and it got bent.
I think it took me a couple hours to get to the North Carter trail.  By then, I was angry and miserable.  I was screaming and cursing at my misfortune.  Onguard, a hiker I met when I stayed at The Notch Hostel, greeted and passed me.  There was only about 1.9 miles left, but it took forever down the steep, slippery rock slabs and through frequent mud slop puddles taking up the whole width of the trail.  That, and it was getting dark.
I finally arrived to Imp Campsite around 10.  Fortunately, there was space in the shelter. I changed into dry clothes, got water, cooked dinner, finished up camp chores, and fell asleep around 11:30.","Osgood Tentsite

Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666752,"After a miserable day and feeling exhausted, I slept in until almost 7.  I don't think I heard anyone in the shelter until then, and was surprised I slept in so late.  Onguard brough everyone their bear bags.  Just about everyone headed off.  One woman, who I think was jokingly calling herself SAM for slow as molasses, was the last before me to head out.   I met the caretaker and paid last night's fee, then headed out a little after 8:30.
I recall my climb up to Mt Moriah side hike in the fall, 5 years ago, maybe taking an hour.  It wasn't that bad of a climb as I recall.  However, today I must have been pretty unenthusiastic or just fatigued in my wet, dirty hiking clothes and soaked boots, which still encountered plenty of mud slop.  As I climbed up, I screamed at the top of my lungs, ""I f***ing hate my life!"" Being honest here, I've screamed this out many times before in the past month.  Today, I got a reply from further up: ""Me too!""  It was SAM.  I passed her on my way up.  It felt good to know that someone felt the same way I did for a moment.  I saw good views at Middle Moriah, and took a break there around 9:15.  SAM arrived there and we chatted.  Apparently she has had knee surgery in the past and was due for another.  I felt like a wimp for bitching about the trail when another thru hiker had a tougher situation.  Besides, the weather was sunny and it was clearing up, gradually.
As I got higher up, there was too much fog for a view.  I decided to skip 0.1 mile Mt Moriah summit spur.  The initial descent was slow, with plenty of slippery rock slabs. Eventually I arrived to the Rattle River trail, coinciding with the AT, around 11:30.  The trail mellowed out. There were a couple serious stream crossings across Rattle River, which was raging, but I enjoyed them.  I took a break at Rattle River Shelter around 1:10, then got to the US 2 trailhead at about 2:30.
Finally, time to relax.  The hostel in Gorham was full, so someone from the White Birches Camp and Hostel, about 2 miles from town, picked me up.  Once there, I got loaner clothes, took a shower, did laundry, and aired out my wet gear on a picnic table in the warm, sunny weather.
I needed to resupply and replace my trekking poles.  It was past 5, and the local outfitter store was closed, so that was a task for tomorrow- it looked Iike they would be open, if for limited hours.  The weather forecast for tomo, Independence Day, still showed thunderstorms all day.  Based on my miserable experience hiking yesterday, I decided to take a zero tomorrow.
I decided to run some errands in town and eat.  The shuttle driver, Bruce or Golden Waldo, dropped me off at an AYCE (mostly) Chinese food buffet, where I ate until I was uncomfortably stuffed again, and also took some take-out.  The food might have not been all that healthy, but I loved eating it.  Chicken with broccoli, green beans, sweet and sour soup, crab rangoon, steamed wonton, peanut chicken, pineapple chicken, fried chicken, fruit, jello, cake, pudding, and even ice cream I got to eat there: my one stop shop to fill my belly.  I am making AYCE places a priority now.
The Walmart was too far away, so I got a few days of food at the Dollar General.  I went into Subway, and the nice lady who worked there gave me a cup of spinach free of charge!  I needed it and was grateful.  I'll have to buy something there tomorrow.
There was a fair with rides and concession stands set up at the common grounds.  I got a hot fudge sundae there for $8.  It was tiny.  I should have known.
I tried to get a hold of the shuttle driver, but to no avail.  I walked the roughly 1.7 miles back to the hostel.  Not a terrible walk, but along a highway at night, not so safe.  Apparently it had rained, and some of the gear I had not taken in the hostel before leaving had to be dried again.  I went back into the hostel and found that Grit was there too!  It started pouring not long after.  I was exhausted, and fell asleep.","Imp Campsite

No one was available to drive us into town that early, so Grit and I walked the 1.7 miles into town, getting there around 8:15.  It was clear out. Grit had other things to do like resupply, so I headed into the outfitter store in Gorham.  Thankfully, they had a relatively inexpensive pair of Black Diamond poles.  I got that, along with a new Platypus water reservoir, fuel canister, and bug spray.  They said they could not ship my broken trekking poles for me, and the PO was of course closed today.
I ate a breakfast burrito and meltaway bar, then hanged out in the bookstore at the White Mountain Cafe for a while. I got some fudge at a local souvenir shop.  It showered for about 20 minutes.
I headed over to the Barn Hostel in town to ask about shipping the poles.  An owner said that if I packaged them and gave him money for shipping, he would send them tomorrow.  He recommended going to Dollar General to get a box.  In the meantime, I finally got a hold of the shuttle driver - Bruce said he could pick me up and bring me back to White Birches in an hour from The Barn.
By now it was 11.  I headed over to DG and got that box, plus a couple snacks.  I also got a sub and cup of spinach from Subway, and some more snacks at Cumberland Farms.  Then I went across the street to the Barn Hostel and got the poles ready for shipping, and handed him $20.  Bruce was there too.
I headed back to White Birches.  Grit had already returned.  It was basically beautiful all day, except for a brief rain in the afternoon.  I relaxed for the rest of the day, read, and did some catching up on journal entries.  I bought some ice cream a few times, then settled my bill.  Fireworks were in town, but there was no guarantee about a ride back, do I just stayed there and listened to them from 2 miles away.","US 2

After some road walking past a dam, there was a steep, but not especially difficult climb up to the Mahoosuc Trail junction around 8, which is also roughly where I hiked 1900 miles of the AT.  I saw nothing special formed in the ground to mark the mileage though, which usually occurs at mileage that are multiples of 100.
There was a nice view on the way up Cascade Mountain.  Because it was a warm day, I stopped a little further up, at a flat spot in the shade, around 9:30.  I passed by a couple ponds on my way to the Gentian Pond Shelter junction, which I in turn passed around 1.
I got some water from a stream, but lost my watch somehow.  I wanted to check the time, then realized it was gone.  I use my phone to acknowledge times now.
After a lunch break around 2 at another flat spot on the way up a climb between two streams, I had a strenuous but scenic climb up Mt Success, which I summited around 3:30.  In another hour and change, I passed the NH/ME border, then took a break at a view on the way to camp.
I got to camp around 5:30 or 6.  Grit rolled in shortly thereafter, and so did Irish, who I first met at Beaver Brook Shelter on the way down from Mt Moosilauke about a week ago.  It was great to have plenty of evening to hang out, and not many people crowding camp.  I finished chores and turned in around 10.","US 2

It was an interesting, scenic climb up and down the Goose Eye mountains.  Because of all the interesting scrambles and views, it was also time consuming as I took photos.  I saw Grit and Irish on the east peak around 8, and we took a group ""selfie"". 
I got to Full Goose Shelter around 9 and took a break, first with Irish, then when he left, with Grit when he arrived.  I also got water, which was a 0.2 mile spur not mentioned in the guide, plus a pit stop.  I finally headed out around 10.
After climbing Fulling Mill Mountain, I descended to the south starting point of Mahoosuc Notch around 11:30.  Between that and its northern endpoint, it is referred to as the most difficult mile on the trail.  And it was interesting.  For some reason, there was still snow under some small rock caves, so it was very cool at some points.  It required scramble after scramble between boulders and through a few caves.  Navigation was sometimes a little tricky, though there were enough markings to figure out where to go after a guess here and there.  I think it took me two hours, because I took a bunch of photos, but I think most people get through it in 1 hour.
After leaving Mahoosuc Notch, I really should have taken a break at the nice campsite in between the notch and the climb up Mahoosuc Arm.  I had just figured that since I only hiked/climbed 2.7 miles, maybe I should go further.  But it had been 3 hours, and I was getting low on energy.  The climb took a while: 1200 feet in a mile, with plenty of rock slabs to climb through on the way up.  I finally found a flat spot off trail on the climb up, and had a break there around 2:15, about 0.2 miles from the top.
It was a longer break - I think I finished off the climb by 3:30.  Then I descended to Speck Pond Shelter, where I arrived around 4:30.  I was pretty exhausted.  Unfortunately, there were two large youth groups -- one with 8 and another with 7, and on a Thursday -- there who took up most of the campsites.  Since this was an AMC campsite, I was advised by a hiker to talk to the caretaker, who told me to sleep in the shelter.
At 6, making dinner was crowded in the designated cooking area.  Despite my short mileage day, I was famished.  I ate dinner, then a candy bar, then a granola bar, then another candy bar, then some trail mix, then finally a few a hard candies to suck on.

There was rain in the forecast in the afternoon, so, much to the chagrin of the other hikers in the shelter, my alarm went off at 4.  My noise getting ready was bugging others, so I was asked to leave and finish outside of the shelter.  I will be aware of that etiquette for next time I stay in one.
I started a little past 5:30.  My goal was to get in a decent day of hiking for most of the day, and get to a road where some people could pick me up and take me to a hostel during, or hopefully before the rain.
I made my way up to Old Speck.  Over Columbus Day weekend in 2019, I backpacked the Grafton Loop, a 38 mile route that combines the Grafton Loop Trail and AT for a scenic, but difficult loop.  That time, it was foggy on Old Speck.  The hike up to Old Speck today was clear and scenic.  I decided to head up the 0.3 mile spur up to the summit and fire tower, which is off the AT.  I got there around 7.  The views were excellent.
I descended to Grafton Notch.  It wasn't too bad, but it took about 2 hours.  I took a break there and, despite the guide mentioning a trash can, there wasn't one.
I started the long climb up to the Baldpates around 9:30.  It was turning into a warm, sunny day, and as I observed during my break, the thunderstorm forecast was pushed forward a couple hours.  That was great, because I knew the views on the Baldpates -- part of the Grafton Loop -- would also be excellent.  I got to Baldpate west peak around 11:30, and Baldpate east peak around noon.
The climb up to the east peak was is above treeline and had views all the way up.  The east peak is the furthest north on the AT that I had ever hiked up at this point.  I took a half hour break.  It is 6.3 miles to East B Hill Rd from there.  I called the hostel in Andover where I had placed a hold for a bunk during my break on the climb up Mahoosuc Arm yesterday to let them know I would get to that road around 4.  There were a few other hikers there, also making reservations or confirming meeting times at the road.  It was still sunny, but I saw darker clouds forming from afar.
The last 6.3 miles to the road were straightforward - mostly downhill, except for a brief climb up Surplus Mountain, just past the Frye Notch Lean-to -- where I arrived a little before 1:30 -- and beyond Dunn Notch, where there are some pretty falls, and unfortunately no camping is allowed.
I passed by Dunn Notch around 3:30, and got to East B Hill Rd around 3:45.  As I approached the road, it started to drizzle.  The car to pick me up was there, and Grit was inside.  He would also be in the bunkhouse.  They waited a half hour for me, since the shuttle would cost less to pick up more than one person.  Since the hostel picks up and drops off at multiple roads, this isn't included in the hostel stay cost.
The ladies drove us back and gave me a complimentary large cup of lemonade - it was great!  It started pouring as we drove to the hostel.  Thank goodness I finished when I did, and I was grateful that I started so early.
We arrived at the hostel around 4:10.  Another lady checked me in and gave a brief tour.  She said complimentary homemade muffins would be served for breakfast tomorrow morning.  I took a shower, and shared laundry with Grit since we both had very little to wash and dry.
It continued to pour.  We took our umbrellas and walked for about 7 minutes to a market with a small dining area.  I got three days of food, plus some fruit, yogurt, ice cream, and drinks.  Grit and I also shared a large veggie pizza, and I got a side tossed salad, chicken wings, and sweet potato fries.  We were full when we ate all that!  There were a bunch of other hikers from various Andover area hostels at the market eating, including Irish.  All the while, it continued to pour.
We returned around 7:30.  I put my stuff in the bunkhouse.  Fortunately, it was just me and Grit, so we slept on opposite sides of it and each used one of the provided fans.  I settled my bill around 8.  L Someone kindly put our load in the dryer while we were at the market.  The rain was finally settling down.  I organized my food and wrote a journal  entry.  After a long day starting early with little sleep, I fell asleep around 10.","Speck Pond Shelter

Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666936,"Last night, Grit and I were told that the earliest that a shuttle driver could take us back off at East B Hill Rd was 8.  I needed the extra sleep anyway.  I still woke up at 5, but went back to sleep for 90 minuee after a restroom run.  Then, I wrote another journal entry, got my stuff ready to go, and headed into the main house for breakfast.  I was disappointed to learn that all the homemade muffins were already eaten - apparently the first time it's happened, according to the lady.  It was now 7:30.  I headed over to the market, got a breakfast sandwich and blueberry muffin, and ate that plus an apple I'd saved from last night.
The shuttle van came in at 8 and dropped me, Grit, and Irish off at East B Hill Rd just before 8:30.  We hoped to shoot for Bemis Mountain Lean-to today.  The first few miles weren't bad.  On my way up Wyman Mountain, about 4 miles in, I ran into Plunger and Skippy at a small overlook, drying their gear after camping in the downpour last night.  It was about 10:15.  I took a brief break there and chatted with them.  They were headed to dispersed camping a few miles of the Bemis Mountain Lean-to.
I pressed on, passing the Hall Mountain Lean-to, and descending to Sawyer Notch around 12:30. Then there was a long, steep climb up Moody Mountain, which took about an hour.  Then, a steep but reasonable descent to South Arm Rd, which required a ford across Black Brook right before the road.  I took a lunch break there around 1:30 for 40 minutes, and also chatted with a SOBO for a bit.
Around 2:15, I started up Old Blue Mountain, a 2200 foot climb over 2.8 miles, which took me until 3:45 to summit.  I took an electrolytes break there.  
Then, after descending and some ups and downs, I got to Bemis Mountain at 6:15.  I took another break there, and Irish passed by.
I continued down the next 1.7 miles to Bemis Mountain Lean-to around 7:45, set up my tent, and finished up camp chores.  I was happy to have my own camp and cooking area for the first time in a week or so.  I retired around 10.","East B Hill Rd

Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666937,"I left around 8:30.  It was drizzling.  There was a sharp descent to Bemis Stream, which I had to ford.   Then there was an equally sharp ascent to ME 17.  It was rough, and I was angry that I had to climb so much to get up to a highway, which I reached around 10:30.
After another couple hours, I passed by the Sabbath Day Pond, then took a break and got water after two more hours near the Little Swift River Pond Campsite.
The trail descending to ME 4 wasn't bad, so I got there around 4:30.  I saw Irish with a hiking buddy at the parking lot.  He said he was staying in Rangeley for the night. There was a forecast of two inches of rain tomorrow, so I assume he wanted to take a zero.  I was getting sick of delays on the trail, and wanted to press on - either to the next lean-to, or over Saddleback Mountain.  I would hate to have to hike over that in the rain.
In the meantime, it was a warm, humid day.  I walked down the road to The Hiker Hut.  Gretl, a SOBO from Belgium, was manning the hostel while the owner was in town.  We chatted while I had a cold Gatorade and a bunch of other snacks.  She mentioned that she heard the major rain wouldn't start until tomorrow at noon.  While I didn't want to bet only on that, it was good to know.  I tanked up on water, and headed back to the trail around 5:30.
It was a long climb up, but I passed a few ponds while ascending.  Unfortunately, it was foggy above treeline.  The trail was still easy to follow, but no views, really.  I could see a little bit of the landscape in front of me - enough to know that Saddleback had plenty of false summits.
I finally got to the summit around 8.  By then, it there was a moderate drizzle/misting.  I couldn't, and wouldn't want to camp above treeline, so I decided to keep going until I found a flat spot below treeline.  I did not find one between Saddleback Mountain and The Horn, but instead went down and up lots of rocky scrambles.
It was 9 and dark outside when I reached The Horn, and still misting.  By now, it just made sense to head to the next designated campsite, Redington.  It took another half hour to descend the 0.7 miles to the campsite junction.  I found a spot, set up my tent, and cooked dinner in the vestibule.  It was still misting.  After a stop at the privy, I turned in around 11.","Bemis Mountain Lean-to

Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667225,"Today, I was hoping to hike to a campsite past the Carabassett River.  Bases on what Gretl told me yesterday, and the updated forecast I got on top of Saddleback yesterday, it still looked like the worst of the rain would start around noon.
I started hiking at 6:45.  There was a steep scramble up to and down from Saddleback Junior.  I passed by Poplar Ridge Lean-to around 9 and had a brief break on Poplar Ridge.  By now, it was showering.
I passed across Orbeton Stream around 10:30 and saw the tall waterfall.  Even in the showers, it looked pretty cool.
After a brief water break, I began the long climb up to Lone Mountain.  There were some cool cascading brooks along the way.  After passing a couple roads, the climb became more difficult.  I arrived at the summit around 1. There wasn't much of a view at the top of Lone Mountain through the fog and rain.  By now, it was raining steady.  Around 1:30, I found a flat spot on the way down the mountain to have a lunch break under my umbrella.
I arrived at Spaulding Mountain Lean-to around 3.  There were 3 people there.  It was still raining steadily.  I decided to take another break there, hoping the rain would either stop at some point, or would attenuate, which a town weather report suggested would happen around 4 or 5.  The rain held up.  Another person joined.  I was getting cold, and the next campsite is 5 miles from here.  I decided to stay in the shelter for the night, and started camp chores.
After getting into dry clothes and starting to cook dinner around 6 or 7, Plunger and Skippy showed up.  They were soaked, and asked if there was any more space left for them to stay there. We all squeezed together to make room for them - it would be a cozy night!  After writing a journal entry and reading, I fell asleep around 10.","Redington Campsite
",Spaulding Mountain Lean-to,"Jul 10, Mon",10.70
Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667226,"It rained all night - it didn't stop until 5 this morning, when I started to get ready to go.  I chatted briefly with Plunger and Skippy.  They were thinking of renting a car after they finish the AT - sounds fun!  They left around 6, and I headed out around 6:30.
The trail was a cascading stream of the rainfall heading up to Spaulding Mountain.  Around 8:45, I got to a junction for a high water route that goes up to the Sugarloaf Mountain summit, then down to the highway.  After rain all day yesterday, then all night, that was the route I should have taken, in retrospect.  But it was not the route I chose, because I was thinking the high water route was for dire circumstances.
I saw a view through the clouds as I descended to Carabassett River.  The descent was steep and took me a while.  I think I got down to the river around 10:30.  The river was raging - high water level and a swift current.  Plunger and Skippy were there, going up and down river to find a way across.  They had already tried fording, but it got up to chest deep.  Fording tgrough this river in the wrong spot could easily eesult in a slip and being carried downstream, out of control, and potentially drowning.  They were thinking of climbing back up to do the high water route.  I was not enthusiastic about backtracking and climbing up three steep miles.
I also looked for a way across, heading a little further upriver.  There was one spot with rocks, but the current was much swifter, and between two big boulders that would require a jump of desperation.  That was not a risk I was willing to take.
Over an hour had passed, and I returned to the footpath.  I saw Plunger again.  He was speaking with others who had since arrived at the crossing.  They were thinking of bushwhacking downriver, where they think they would find two tributaries we could cross to eventually get to a golfing area near the Sugarloaf ski resort.  Still wanting to avoid backtracking and climbing, I decided to go along with it.
So, I, Plunger, Skippy, and three others started the bushwhack downriver.  The ground was muddy, unstable, and even more poorly sloped than the trail.  (At this point, that latter characteristic might seem hard to believe.)  I lost my balance and fell several times.  We continued at it for about 20 minutes.  Then, I caught up to Plunger Skippy, and a Maine section hiker from the lean-to last night, who were waiting.  The other two had continued onward, and were out of sight.
The three were discussing what to do, and in step, Plunger asked what I was thinking.  After all the crossing attempts and the slipping through the bushwhack, I was fatigued and wasn't sure what to say.  I just went with what was in front of me.  I told them I was not a fan of this bushwhack, and if I had to, I'd climb back up to the high water route junction to avoid wasting more time.  To my surprise, my tired blather made sense to them -- or perhaps they felt similarly -- and we started to return to the trail.
After about ten minutes of walking towards the footpath, Plunger spotted a small island in the river.  It separated the river into two branches briefly.  One branch was easily crossable on rocks.  The other still required a ford, but it was narrower than where the river was at the trail crossing, and the current was not as swift.  Plunger was intrigued and wanted to check it out.  After he told me all that about the branches, I was just about sold as well.  I followed him across the first branch to the island.  He started folding the second branch.  I watched as he crossed it.  He made it!
As he started to tie a rope to a tree, I decided to try out the second branch myself.  I moved slowly across it, getting knee, then waist, then chest deep.  I was about halfway across, and nearing the swiftest part of the current, when Plunger headed back into the river with the rope.  I was reaching him, and he extended his hand. I took it, and he pulled.  I was surprised at how well it was helping.  The current might have toppled me without his help.  I made it across successfully -  drenched, but safe.
Plunger had continued back towards the island and tied the rope to another tree.  He helped the section hiker start across the branch.  She continued across.  I got into the water, held on to the rope, and when she got close, I held out my hand, and she reached for it.  I helped her as we both clung to the rope.  At one point, I asked her if she felt my hand was unnecessary -- thought maybe I was overdoing it, or that she was annoyed -- but she insisted that I keep holding on to hers.  I did, and she made it across.  I similarly helped out with Skippy.  I knew full well that Plunger didn't need my help.  Finally, we were all across!  I was shaken after the ford, but it was also an exhilarating feeling, and we were all relieved.  I was so grateful I was with them.
We were about a half mile from the footpath. We got back to it, and it was about 2:30.  We hadn't even made it to the designated campsite past the shelter where we stayed last night!  Thank goodness I did not press on past the lean-to yesterday.
We continued up the two Crocker mountains.  After four hours of turmoil, climbing 1900 feet over two miles sermed like a relief.  Still, I took a half hour break at the South Crocker Mountain around 3:30 because it was sunny and there was a nice view at the summit.  The descent down, then climb up to North Crocker Mountain didn't seem bad at all - got there around 5.  From there, it was a more gentle descent of 3000 feet over five miles to ME 27, where I arrived a little before 7.
I had called the hostel where I made a reservation a couple days ago that I would not make the 4:30 pick-up time during my break, but they said to call anyway, because they still might be able to pick me up.  I had also chatted with Plunger and Skippy about staying last night, but they didn't seem committed.   Turns out they wanted to just go into town, resupply, and head to the next campsite another couple miles in.  That was doable for me, but I wanted to relax, especially after that harrowing river crossing experience.  Anyway, a shuttle came by that they ended up using to go to a grocery store. A young lady from the hostel arrived around the same time. We bade farewell for the time being, and I hoped to see them again.  
For a thru hiker months into the journey, the Hostel of Maine seemed pretty posh for a $45 stay.  Open kitchen with dinners and ice cream for sale; resupply store with snacks, a couple different bathrooms; and a large lounging room area with comfortable chairs, decorative tables, board games, and books.  Fast Wi-Fi too.  After checking in, I took a shower and opted for the laundry service.  Then, after getting partly resupplied at the hostel, I headed to a nearby grocery store to get produce, some cold beverages, dinner, and more food for resupply.
The same person picked me up from the grocery store on her way to picking up a couple more people from the ME 27 trailhead.  What luck!  I could use more of that.
I spent the rest of the evening eating, uploading photos, catching up on journal entries, and lounging.  Then went to sleep in a comfortable bunk with clean linens around 11.","Spaulding Mountain Lean-to

Wolverine,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667227,"As far as viewpoints are concerned, today was one of the best days on the trail.  It was also sunny and clear today.
I must have enjoyed my stay at Hostel of Maine a little too much, or just needed sleep, but I ended up not getting out of bed until about 8.  I loved their continental breakfast - it was, for me, basically an AYCE buffet: bread and bagels with several spreads, cereal, oatmeal, coffee and tea, juice, homemade banana bread, hard boiled eggs with Sriracha sauce.  I had a little of everything, plus the other half of my baby spinach leaves.
I was finally ready around 9:45, and they dropped me off at the trailhead around 10.  Late start, but I'd end at a suitable place, though I hoped to finish up the Bigelows today.
After a couple miles of relatively flat stream crossings and yet more sloshing through mud slop, I climbed 2000 feet over 2.5 miles.  There, I took a half hour break at a view of Bigelow Mountain around 12:30.  In a matter of minutes, I descended along a gentle grade to a much better viewpoint of Bigelow Mountain with Horns Pond.
Then, 700 feet of gain to South Horn in a half mile, followed by a descent, then ascent to Bigelow Mountain. I ran into the Maine section hiker from the lean-to and yesterday's crazy water crossing as I passed a campsite with a cabin.  I grabbed some water at an otherwise unreliable spring, well supplied by the voluminous rainfall, right off the trail.
I summited Avery Peak around 4, and took in the amazing views while taking another half hour break.  Then, an 1800 foot descent to Safford Notch over two miles.  On my way up Little Bigelow Mountain, I took a brief break at a view of Bigelow Mountain around 6:30, then continued up to the summit, then descended to Little Bigelow Lean-to, where I arrived around 8:30. I was glad to have a tent platform to myself close -- but not too close -- to the privy.  Then after camp chores, I turned in around 10.","ME 27
