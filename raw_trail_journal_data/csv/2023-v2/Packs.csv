Packs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665084,"I bought a nice pair of crocs to attach to my backpack and have for around camp.  They are really light.  The problem is, they lost shape after sitting under the pack and now I can't just slip my feet into them.  That was the whole purpose.  When I have a full bladder in the middle of the night I don't want to bend over and put them on.  The last time I went camping I tripped over them while trying to put them on and my bladder released and I peed all over myself.  These are serious issues.  No kidding.  Maybe I should sleep with them on.  I have so much to figure out.",,View Entry,"Jun 04, Sun",0
Packs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665083,I just ordered Dirty Girl Gaiters.  Cute colors to coordinate with my shoes and my hiking pants.  The problem is... are they really necessary?  What are the benefits?  I was thinking they would help keep away ticks and will help keep my shoes and socks from taking on dirt and grime.  I worry that they will be hot.  I already overheat easily.  When they arrive I will try them out for a few short hikes and decide after that.  I am wearing my Altra lone peak trail shoes.  I have two pair and plan to back the old pair as a backup to leave with my trail support (Husband).,,View Entry,"Jun 05, Mon",0
Packs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665082,"My trip is less than a month away.  I am nervous.  I have a difficult time sleeping.  All I think about is my pack weight, bear safety, and hoping I don't pee on myself when I get out of the hammock in the middle of the night to pee.  They say you pack your fears.  That must be true.  I just purchased a pee rag.    I also purchased two different sizes of bear vaults.  I just don't think I want to carry the weight.  I don't know if I can throw a bear line each night and my thinking is that I can just leave the bear vault on the ground.  Now I am not sure if the vault is large enough for 4 days of food and my other scented stuff.  I honestly would not worry about bears, except I plan to hike in Virginia in the Shenandoah National Park for 5 nights.  I will most likely encounter a bear. I also read somewhere that some people are hanging the vault so the bear doesn't play with it or run off with it...  So will I be hanging a line anyway?  Ugh...   I think I will start practicing throwing lines in my backyard and see how that goes...",,View Entry,"Jun 06, Tue",0
Packs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665149,"I have a Frogg Toggs Adult Emergency Poncho.  It was $6 at Walmart.  Frogg Toggs has an ultra lite poncho, but my Walmart did not carry it.  Since I am section hiking and can choose locations around weather conditions I don't feel like I need more than the poncho.  Again, I am probably overthinking this.  I don't want to risk falling on slippery rocks, and therefore I will probably stop hiking and seek shelter or make a shelter if it rains.  My original plan was to have rain pants and a rain jacket.  My second plan was to not bring anything on this 5-night trip.  I have decided on the poncho as a lightweight option.  I plan to use it as a footprint under my hammock so it has a multi-purpose. The Poncho I am bringing will most likely tear, so if it rains I might get soaked even with it on.  Those are my random thoughts for the day.  25 more days until my trip!",,View Entry,"Jun 07, Wed",0
Packs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665388,"I have decided to test out several different food options.  Yesterday I prepared ramen noodles by cold soaking them for several hours. I am not sure if they made me sick, or if because I was getting sick I could not eat much.  They did not taste bad.  I think I could try that method on the trail by preparing them in a Ziplock back with seasonings that I prefer, like Garlic Salt.  I will try it again this week and will try mixing in other ingredients to see what I like.  I also love peanut butter granola clusters.  They are especially good with chocolate mixed in!  I tried several variations on trail mix over the weekend and really enjoyed the salty mixture of Chex mix and Bugles.",,View Entry,"Jun 12, Mon",0
Packs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665498,"Sometimes, (many times), I run out of breath when hiking.  I have read that Pursed-lip breathing (PLB) can help ease shortness of breath!  The technique is simple.  You exhale through tightly pressed lips and inhale through the nose (keep the mouth closed). I also read that Diaphragmatic Breathing can help you have less effort and energy to breathe.  So I have added Diaphragmatic Breathing to my pre-hike training routine.  I will practice for 5-10 minutes 3-4 times a day.  I will walk up a flight of stairs and practice my breathing techniques. Eventually, when I hike I won't look like a distressed asthmatic.   I also plan to hike s l o w l y.  One step at a time.  One foot in front of the other.  It is not a race.   I recently heard a saying ""Broken crayons can still color"".  Can't remember where I heard it, but it resonated with me.  I am determined to hike the AT.",,View Entry,"Jun 14, Wed",0
