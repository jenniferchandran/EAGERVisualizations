Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667711,"171 miles have been hanging over my head for two years.  In August 2021, I was cruising through the mountains of southern Maine believing I would finally finish the AT.  On the top of Little Bigelow Mountain I met up with a friend from Texas, Robert, who was going to hike with me for several days. We were about to be done with the big mountains on southern Maine and on our way to Caratunk, Monson, and the 100 mile Wilderness.  That night at Little Bigelow Lean-to I start feeling some pain.  As the night progressed I felt worse and worse.  In the morning I told Robert that I think I need to get to a doctor.  
We started hiking down to the parking area where he had parked his car.  It was only 1.3 miles but felt like 20.  Along the way I made several trips into the woods to see if I could relieve some of the pain.  Finally I just crumpled up into a ball on top of my pack and told Robert I needed to rest.  To say Robert was getting concerned was an understatement!  He told me “I need you to get up and walk.  I can carry your pack but I can’t carry you.”  So that is what we did.  I stumbled down the trail, Robert hoisted my pack and carried his and my pack and we went for the parking lot.  It couldn’t have been more than half a mile.  
When we got to the parking lot there was a big party going on with the hikers that had overnighted at the lean-to.  They were celebrating being done with the big mountains and just had a sprint to Katahdin.  For those that had thru hiked from Georgia it meant maybe a week or so of hiking left.  For me, I just wanted to lay down in Robert’s passenger seat. He had no cell service or map so he just started driving.  Robert and I have known each other for 8 or 9 years, but he didn’t know my medical history or personal information. He didn’t know if I’d be conscious when he got me to an ER, so he started quizzing me for my personal and medical information.  It was kind on annoying as I was drifting in and out of consciousness, but I understood what he was doing.
Once at the ER, they got me in and determined it was a kidney stone.  Fortunately one that I could pass naturally.  They loaded me up with drugs and sent me on my way.  Obviously I wasn’t in shape to return to the trail, so Robert loaded me up once again and we headed for Bangor airport.  Robert had flown in and was now having to cut his hiking trip short but was going to fly me home.  It’s great to have aviation friends!
Two years have now passed and it’s time to finish the AT hike I started 9 years ago.  171.8 miles. Hopefully less than 3 weeks.  Hopefully no medical issues.  Hopefully I will once again stand on top of Mount Katahdin.",,View Entry,"Aug 05, Sat",0
Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667913,"My gear is strewn all around the den as I load my pack one more time.  My gear basically hasn’t changed for many years after evolving from the start of my AT hike.   After several years of long distance backpacking, I’ve found what works for me.  I’m not an ultra-lighter by any means,  but I have worked to reduce my gear load over the years.


In 2016 I traded out my trusty Gregory pack for a ULA Circuit pack.  That saved me 3-4 pounds.  My tent is an LL Bean Microlight, albeit with new poles and rainfly after they got damaged in 2017.  LL Bean did an amazing job of replacing them for free when they failed on the AT.  My sleeping bag is a Marmot Helium 15, patched in 2016 after a mouse chewed through the outer liner in Virginia.  I love my Neo Air mattress, it’s like sleeping on air, literally.  I did add an inflatable Sea to Summit pillow a couple of years ago after stubbornly insisting I could just use my clothes stuff sack.  


My kitchen consists of an MSR Pocket Rocket with canister gas.  This was changed in 2012 after my MSR Whisper lite failed while hiking the Smoky Mountains.  I use a Snow Peak titanium pot my wife got me for Christmas for cooking, it’s simple and light.  My clothing bag contains an extra T-shirt, a long sleeve shirt, a pair of zip off hiking pants, 2 pair of underwear and socks, and 3 bandannas.  A lot of hikers forgo the change of clothes but I want to have a dry set to change into as necessary.  I always have a puffy jacket as well as my well worn rain jacket.  


My miscellaneous blue gear bag  (stuff sack)keeps getting heavier unfortunately.  I’m carrying an extra power brick this year because of the time to get through the 100 mile wilderness.  And my wife insisted I carry a Spot locator in the remoteness of Maine.   While it’s a great idea to disconnect from your phone in the wilderness, it’s also my lifeline.  It’s my map (Far Out app, formerly Guthook), camera, journal, book, and well … a phone.  Add in a first aid kit, foot care kit, bathroom kit, etc. and the weight adds up.  (And by kit I mean a ziplock bag).   I tend to keep everything in various stuff sacks, it helps me keep everything organized.


My food stuff sack is the real monster in my pack.  A weeks worth of meals and snacks is approximately 8 pounds.  Especially starting out, this bag is a beast.  


As I load and reload my pack several times to make sure I have everything, and to see what I can leave behind, the memories of past sections come back.  The tunnel of trees in Virginia , the balds of Tennessee,the PUDS (pointless ups and downs) in Georgia , the magnificent sunsets in New Hampshire , the drenching rains in North Carolina, the patch of wildflowers, well…everywhere.  And most of all the memories of hikers I’ve met and stayed in contact with, the ones I wonder where they are, the kindness of strangers; they all go into my pack.",,View Entry,"Aug 09, Wed",0
Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667915,"Maine is one the remotest and ruggedest states to hike says the Appalachian Trail Conservancy.  Getting there is a little more problematic that many of my previous journeys.   I live on Cape Cod in the Summer and so the path to the trail starts with a 2 hour bus ride from Barnstable to Boston, and then another 4 hour bus ride from Boston to Bangor, and then a friend’s daughter giving me a ride the final 2 hours to the Little Bigelow Trailhead.   By contrast, the last time I came back from this trailhead (unscheduled unfortunately) was an hour long flight in Robert’s King Air.   The wonders of general aviation!!


Maine is a gorgeous state and I’m really looking forward to exploring it further this year.  I’ve yet to see a moose on the AT, and the 100 mile wilderness evokes the ultimate AT wilderness experience.  And then there is Katahdin, “The Great Mountain”.   I climbed it as a day hike in 2012, and when I saw the hikers coming up from the other side, coming all the way from Georgia, it rekindled my desire to climb it once again.",,View Entry,"Aug 10, Thu",0
Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667979,"I arrived Bangor and Shannon picked me up to give me a ride to the trail.  After a stop at her house and a stop at Walmart for some earbuds we headed for Flagstaff Lake.


When we arrived at the trailhead there were quite a few cars parked there.  Memories of my very painful walk through the parking lot from 2 years ago came back, and I was glad that I was I was able to return to swat then aside.


I hoisted my pack and asked Shannon to get a picture for me, a quick hug of thanks for the ride, and then she was gone and I was walking around to find a white blaze for the AT.  After a very short walk down Flagstaff Road I found it and I was back to walking on the AT!  There was a small uphill and into the woods, the muddy trail, a little buggy, and it felt like I was home once again.   It was after 6pm so I didn’t expect to walk too far but I wanted to get a little ways down the trail.   When I checked the map it showed the trail following the shore of Flagstaff Lake before turning eastward.   I saw a campground depicted in about a mile so that was my objective.


When I arrived there were a couple of families at the campground that had canoed in.  They had large tents, a big Coleman cook stove, chairs, the works.  There was a small site left that I could pitch my tent and so I grabbed it.  After looking around for other tent sites one of the canoeing dads mentioned there was another tent site about 750 feet down the trail.  I decided to grab my pack and go look at it.  It was spectacular with several large flat areas and a large rock going down to the lake.   I took a couple pictures as the sun was setting and went to set up my camp for the night.  


After I set up my tent I was deciding what to eat for dinner and three young guys that I had seen trail running earlier came in to camp, this time loaded down with large shopping bags, a milk crate, and a large tent duffel.   They had scouted out the campsite before, run back to their car and come back with their load of gear.    They took a dip in the lake to cool off and then started setting up their camp.  Their tent was huge 4 man Coleman tent, they had large bags of food and gear and were planning to use this as their base camp for a few days.  I turned out they were old high school friends, now in various colleges, and all track athletes.  It was nice to have some company and they had a lot of questions about the AT which I gladly answered.  


As it got darker and they were finishing up their dinner I climbed into my tent and was quickly asleep.   Only 1.3 miles today, but it was a start and I was back.","Flagstaff Lake

It rained on and off all night long.  In the early morning light the skies looked sullen but as the sun came up I could see streaks of blue interspersed with the grey clouds.  The wind had picked up and the waves were crashing  on the big rock by our camp with great vigor.


It was cool and I was reluctant to leave the warmth of my sleeping bag but finally did to start the process of drying out.  Every once in a while the trees would catch a gust and shower down some raindrops, but it looked like the rain had ended.  I was cooking my morning hot chocolate when Joe emerged from his tent and went to look at the lake.  He said they all managed to stay dry.


I was packing up my gear when Pete got up and joined Joe.  We talked about AT things for a while while I was trying to get my gear dried out enough to pack them up.  Finally Tristan got up and they ate some breakfast while I finished packing.


span class=""Apple-converted-space""> The grades were gentle but the trail was a muddy mess with the rain.  All the brooks were flowing with the runoff and good water was plentiful.  It was five miles to the West Carry Pond lean-to where I thought would be a good stopping point for lunch.  The whole morning’s hike ended up being a challenge with the muddy flooded trails.  Often the trail was a stream with the runoff and I was just hopping between rocks and roots to avoid ankle deep mud.  Often I was not successful.


I was the only one out on the trail this morning except for one young lady hiker that flew by me and was never seen again.  When I got to the lean-to I was beat.  The rocks and roots and mud were taking their toll on me.  For a first day out on the trail I was feeling pretty good but could tell my endurance was lacking.  I was eating in the shelter when a young NOBO hiker showed up and then a young couple slackpacking.  Tinkerbell and Push had already completed the 100 mile Wilderness and Katahdin the previous week, and were now slackpacking sections that they had skipped.  After they had moved on Alchemist and Swan Dive came by for their lunch.   They too had done Katahdin and were were SOBO to pick up sections that they had skipped.


I finally packed up and would be looking to stealth camp somewhere in 3-5 miles.   The next official camping area was Pierce Pond in 10 miles and I knew I didn’t have 10 miles in me.  The trail wound through low areas and swampy areas and was a constant struggle with the muddy, flooded trail.  I was particularly worried about crossing an area called The Swamp and there were reports of highly aggressive mosquitoes.   The Swamp turned out to be the only area I wasn’t fighting mud and mosquitoes as they built a beautiful boardwalk across it!


When I arrived at East Carry Pond my hopes were initially dashed finding a good stealth site.  There was swamp on one side of the trail and rocky coastline along the pond.  However just as I was about to pass the last of the pond I found a beautiful pine needle covered spot just a few feet from the pond.  I set up camp, cooked my dinner and watched the sun set on the pond.  The weather was perfect with just a light wind and cool enough to need a long sleeve shirt.  Hiker midnight came as the sun set and I fell asleep quickly.","Flagstaff Lake

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668013,"I awoke as the day was dawning.  It had been a quiet night for the most part with a few calls from the Loons.  I have been looking forward to hearing Loons!  When I got up I saw a hiker in a bivy sack sleeping across the trail in another stealth spot.  I was only planning 6 miles to my destination so I was in no hurry to get going, so I returned to the warmth of my sleeping bag.


When I got up again the sun was coming up and the other hiker was packing up.  He said his name was Helium, from New Zealand, and it was easy to see why, he had the smallest pack I’d ever seen for a thru hiker.  No tent, no stove, very little food.  He had started in early May and in 3 months was already in Maine.  He said the trail was a lot tougher than he expected so he wasn’t making the progress he expected!   He headed off, wanting to get across the Kennebec River this morning.


Another hiker named Veggie walked by as I was packing up.  He stopped for a short chat.  He had already covered 3 miles this morning and was wanting to make the canoe ferry across the Kennebec as well.  He had started in March and was going to finish up in the next week or so.  


I packed up my gear and headed up the trail.  It started out really nice through a pine forest with pine needles covering the trail.  This was going to be easy today.   Another hiker named Jukebox passed me and we both commented on how nice the trail was.  However the trail soon turned to mud and in many places large bogs, and in some places a flowing stream.  The grades were easy but fighting the mud and bogs took the ease out of it.  You burn so much more energy negotiating the mud, and occasionally you slip or a log you thought was solid descends in the ankle deep mud, and you let out a hearty “F***” as your shoes fill with muddy water.  With kind regards to Roy Kent. (Ted Lasso)


Please don’t mistake my preoccupation on muddy trails for lack of enthusiasm.   Hikers tend to be very focused on the day to day conditions, but we are exuberant about being able to walk through the beautiful woods of Maine.  They are stunning, and we are blessed to be able to do this.  


After 6 miles I arrived at Pierce Pond lean-to.  It was beautiful and just a few feet from the pond.  “Ponds” in Maine can be huge, more like a lake in Kansas.  It was tempting to stay here but just 0.3 up the trail was Harrison’s Pierce Pond Camp, a traditional Maine Sporting Lodge, that offers hikers a $40 bed and breakfast.  It’s one of the things I don’t want to miss on the trail, a chance to stay in a place famous in AT lore.  Tim is the owner of the lodge and it’s a very rustic place.  The only electricity comes from his generator, and the cabins are simple with two beds, a kerosene lamp and a wood burning stove.   Tim is an amazing cook, musician and host and provides a homey and welcoming atmosphere for hikers and sportsmen.  His walls are filled with AT memorabilia and photos.  


After Tim set me up in a cabin I went out to the hike the other side of the river where the actual AT was.  I hiked back to the other side of the Pierce Pond River.  I considered trying to cross it without my pack but the flow was way too strong.  The Falls were really impressive.


When I got back to the Camp I was chatting with Tim when a couple other hikers showed up, Moon and Willie (Nelson).  Moon was from Kentucky and Willie was from Idaho.   They met up at the NOC in North Carolina and have been hiking together since.  It turned out Wille was a pilot as well.




Another nice feature about Harrison’s is that after Tim serves his regular guests dinner, he lets the hikers have any leftovers which we gratefully devoured.  Hiker breakfast is served at 7 am sharp.   I’m looking forward to it!","East Carry Pond

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668144,"I awoke very early in the Cabin.   It had rained on and off through the night once again.  The storms that were forecast for the morning had not materialized but the fog lay throughout the trees in the valley.


Breakfast was at 7 am sharp but I wandered over early and there were already a lot of hikers from the lean-to site enjoying coffee.  Tim served us his plates of 12 patriotic pancakes, pancakes with blueberries, cranberries, and onions.   They were delicious and there was no way I was going to eat all 12.   He also served scrambled eggs and sausage.   After he was done serving I asked him if he was going to play something for us.  He got a little emotional and then sat down at his electric keyboard to play a song that he composed in honor of his son that had passed away.  It was beautiful and all the hikers sat and listened.  Music is Tim’s passion and his refuge, and you could tell from his playing.


After breakfast I went back to the cabin to finish packing, said a final goodbye, and was back on the AT.  The trail descended down following the Pierce Pond River for 3 miles down to the Kennebec River.  The Pierce Pond River had a number of dramatic waterfalls and rapids and it was pleasant hiking along the rushing water.  At the bottom the Pierce flowed into the Kennebec and the trail wound slightly north to the shores of the Kennebec.  


span class=""Apple-converted-space""> You stand on the west side of the bank and Greg is on the opposite shore notices you and starts canoeing across.  When he arrives you have to fill out a release (Ugh, lawyers) and put on a life jacket.


I’ve done a fair amount of canoeing but none that match the satisfaction finally making it to the Kennebec after 2000 miles of walking and getting to canoe across.  Greg asked where I was going next and all I could say is “North”.   I hadn’t looked at my map any further than getting across the Kennebec.


A phone call to my son to discuss logistics and when we would meet at Monson helped me settle my agenda.  It was time for some pizza and Mountain Dew which is had read that Berry’s Country Store had.  I was quickly able to hitch a ride up to Berry’s and had some outstanding pizza and a soda.   I really didn’t need to resupply but I grabbed a Gatorade and a Honey Bun to go and with a full belly got another ride back to the trail.


span class=""Apple-converted-space""> I started climbing the first of two climbs for the afternoon when the rain started.  It wasn’t too strong so I kept walking.  As the thunder kept getting louder the rain intensified so I stopped, put on my pack cover and rain jacket and decided to sit it out.   I was in a fairly thick grove of trees so was getting pretty good cover from the rain.


Once the rain had slowed down I started walking again.  The first climb was pretty modest, only 500 feet over 2 miles.  After a quick descent the next climb paralleled Holly Brook and was only about 700 feet over 3 miles.  Brook here again was a misnomer, Holly Brook was a raging stream about 30 feet across.  The hike was a fairly pleasant one until I got to the top of what I named Unpleasant Mountain.  The top of the mountain was a swamp for about a mile and it was slow going.  I finally made it the Pleasant Pond shelter and found Willie and Toenails there.  All the tent sites were water logged so I stayed in the shelter that night. Pleasant Pond was less than pleasant, it was really noisy with power boats making lots of noise. 


After cooking a quick dinner it was hiker midnight and time to sack out. After everyone was settling in Sun God and a woman hiker came in to the site.  The woman hiker settled on a tent site but Sun God decided the shelter would be drier.  Just as we were all settled in it started raining again.  I fell asleep to the pitter of rain on the tin roof.","Harrison’s Pierce Pond Camp
",Pleasant Pond Lean-to,"Aug 13, Sun",9.50
Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668152,"I had a restless night in the shelter.  It’s always difficult for me to sleep in a shelter because you don’t want to disturb the other hikers and you also hear them every time they move around.   Willie was the first to get up and start packing up while it was still dark.  That signaled Toenails to get up as well.  I stayed in my sleeping bag awake while they packed.  I had no desire to fight the mud in the dark.


I got up as it was getting light.  I slipped through the mud to use the privy, and a very fine privy it was I might add.  Very large and clean and someone had left extra rolls of TP in it.  It even had a gallon bottle of hand sanitizer in it!


Once on the trail it turned out to be not very muddy and it led to the summit of Pleasant Pond Mountain.  With an elevation of only 2477 and about 1100 feet of elevation gain it was an easy climb.  It felt great to be climbing again after 4 days of hiking through the lowlands.  The summit had beautiful views and much less humid air than the valleys below.  On  the summit I met Caveman and Hot Lips from Northern California.  They were on a quest to complete the Triple Crown with the completion of the Appalachian Trail.  


Another bonus to the mountain summits is the wild blueberries!  Blueberry bushes were everywhere and you can just grab handful of blueberries.  It really slowed your progress though.  Coming down Pleasant Pond Mountain we continued over Middle Mountain and then back to the lowlands.  There was a river crossing at Wild Brook that hikers were being advised to detour around.   When I got to it the Brook (probably 40 yards wide) was flowing strongly and over its banks so I headed the advice and did the detour around.  The detour was about a mile extra walk but took you through a power line easement that had a large boggy area.  I tried to cross it and sink into my thighs.   Ughhh!  What a mess.   I finally found a way through the bog and slogged my way back onto the AT.   At the first Brook crossing I stripped down to clean off the muddy mess.  At least I was clean wet rather than muddy wet.


When I got to Bald Mountain Brook there was a large group of tenters that had passed me already set up.  I found a good tent site right by the Brook and made my dinner.  Other than my muddy bog experience it had been a great day getting some mountain views once again.","Pleasant Pond Lean-to
",Bald Mountain Brook,"Aug 14, Mon",10
Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668153,"I woke up to the sounds of the brook and felt refreshed.  I had a short day planned with just 4.3 miles to just get to the next lean-to located on Bald Mountain Pond.  That would give me two 9 mile days to get into Monson to meet up with my son who was going to join me for the 100-Mile Wilderness.The trail went immediately up Moxie Bald Mountain and it was a great trail.  There weren’t any major boulder climbs and many sections were just going up granite paths rather than roots and mud.  Nearing the summit the views started coming and it was inspiring to see the seemingly endless trees and mountains spreading out in every direction.   The impressive thing about Maine is there aren’t many people and few signs of “civilization” from on top of these peaks.  On top of Moxie Bald I enjoyed a well earned lunch and met a couple of thru hikers, Cyclo and Whispering Moose.  On the descent I met Fire and Mayhem, from Australia.  It’s always a treat to meet and talk with hikers who have come from another country to explore the AT.  


I arrived at the Bald Mountain Pond lean-to in the early afternoon.  A couple of hikers already had tents set up next to the pond shoreline but I was able to find another nearby spot.  Cyclo, Whispering Moose, and Magpie were at the pond as well fishing.  Magpie was sitting on a rock with a piece of fishing line and a dry fly catching small sunfish.  The pond was reflecting the blue sky and clouds and made for a picture perfect setting.   I went back to talk with Mayhem and Fire as they were finishing up their lunch.  They were moving on and I was  questioning whether to stay or move on as well.   In the end, having an afternoon at the pond won out, so I would just have 9 miles tomorrow to the next lean-to.


As sunset came I went out to the pond to watch the evening fall upon the pond.  It was perfectly still, not a whisper of a wind.  The clouds reflected on the smooth water surface broken only by the few water lilies.  An occasional loon from across the pond could be heard calling out.  The peace was broken by a bullfrog calling out, and then answers by another, and then quiet came once more.   As the evening shadows crept over the island in the middle of the pond, the temperature began dropping ever so slightly.  All was at peace and it was another good day to be on the AT.","Bald Mountain Brook
