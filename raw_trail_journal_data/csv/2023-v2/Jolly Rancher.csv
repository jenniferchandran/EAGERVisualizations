Jolly Rancher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659285,"z15 years ago  Or so I  started this hobby/obsession  of section hiking  the whole  trail. This adventure  started with my daughter  who at the time  was 6  she made it as far as the shanadoas and decided it wasn’t her thing  but I was hooked  the first time out .  So A few weeks a year I  go and  knock off a section .  Last summer I was able to start in Harpers Ferry and finish in Delaware water gap.  I even attempted attempted  the  100 mile challenge that’s 100 in 4 days  we’ll sad to say I missed it  by 3 miles   Got my first ever 25  plus mile days   Unfortunately I had a day that my body shut down  and I had  to make the Decision  to stop for day  I  had come to a water source  and a great camping spot  and it was getting dark  so I played it safe and stopped however it cost me a few miles I just was not able to make up  but hey I was stoked not bad for being 50.  

This past summer I was not able to go  buying a house that needed a complete remodel kinda  put a damper on that 
So after talking to my wonderful wife it was  decided that this was going to be my chance to finally finish  the house is done last year I had to stop working due  to severe back issues   6 bulging disc 2 that are collapsed  and 1  that’s starting to herniate  but I’m not going to let that stop me from finishing. I’ve lived with back pain for so long  I normally just push thru it 
After so many years of  sectioning  with a bad back  I have made the switch to ultra light   With a base weight of 12 pounds and total weight of 21  with food and water  I will only carry  the absolute basics that’s not to say I can’t get it lighter  I just have certain items that I have  found to be worth the few extra ounces  for the convenience or ease of use  1 is my jet boil stove  another is my steri pen for treating water and the last is my sleeping pad  I carry a long and wide  as far as sleeping I will be using a 20degree enlightened equipment down quilt also in wide size I like to move around in my sleep the wide size allow me to  wrap up with out getting drafts  love this sleep system  more on my plans next post",,View Entry,"Nov 03, Thu",0
Jolly Rancher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659348,ounce weenie  that is what my daughter  originally wanted to have my trail name be. ha ha I said no way. but looking back maybe it was  a prophecy.leading up to all of my section hikes I have gone thru my gear looking for ways to lighten the load this year has been no  different.I have upgraded to a enlightened gear  950 fill down 20 degree quilt. All I can say is wow  this thing is warm very impressive. I did order in a wide version I did test it  a night ago  however at 50 degrees I don't think it was a fair test  this Sunday it is supposed to go down to 27   will report back after giving it a proper test   sure hope ounce weenie doesn't bite me in the butt  and I don't go running in the house at 4am shivering,,View Entry,"Nov 09, Wed",0
Jolly Rancher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659463,just getting my 3rd.  Been blasting thru trying to get garden beds   Done so that I can  plant before  I leave for  the trail working on completion  my wonderful wife wants a nice garden   So I am determined to get it done  keep ya posted,,View Entry,"Nov 28, Mon",0
Jolly Rancher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659496,I have never used a umbrella on the trail before I have used a rain jacket (doesn’t work)  I have used a poncho. Somewhat works   I  will hike in the rain  like everybody else not my favorite thing to do .  What’s your thought on them for those who have used them  i also have made the decision to use a kilt as it will be cooler in the warmer months not looking to be a trend setter I’m all about  great  functionality.  Light weight and durable So if ya see a a 51 year old dude  rocking a kilt  don’t  be surprised,,View Entry,"Dec 02, Fri",0
Jolly Rancher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659501,"Here is a list of gear that I have  narrowed down to what works for me some things may not be the lightest choice  but sometimes  convenience  or durability  is worth the few extra ounces. This list may not work for you. It has taken me years of trial and error. To develop my kit  hopefully it will help somebody  I will also list the reason I carry it
Z packs duplex tent  (lightest with the most room to spread out gear to organize or repack)
Tyveck ground sheet ( lightest most durable also use it under my pad in shelters to prevent puncture)
Leki aluminum trekking poles( need for setting up tent prevents falls acts like 4 wheel drive I use aluminum not carbon fiber they don’t break if ya snag them on a root or rock also I had to switch the grips to cork as the rubber started to deteriorate leaving my hands black also has cam locks not twist lock found twist locks will slip or fail and you you can’t loosen to adjust  when they get dirt in them)
Z packs arc blast 55 ( almost completely water proof lightest  I don’t use the vertical back supports found they don’t stay where they belong  I also don’t use the hip belt I have never been able to use a belt cuts off circulation by taking them off I save a few ounces  yeah baby!!! 
Big Agnes pad insulated (durable  I did use a Nemo pad but found it to be fragile have ruined 2 of them  is a bad night when you pad blows out)
Nemo inflatable pillow  comfortable 
Enlightened gear revolution (lightest 20degree 950 down quilt in wide
Stove jetboil flash not the lightest but it is the fastest most efficient stove  when I’m ready to eat I don’t want to mess around  plus I found I can go weeks on a tank you do not have to bring water to a boil I like to stop a mile or so before the end of day  make my dinner let it soak while I hike the last mile saves on gas and my food is ready when I get to camp
Long titanium spork
Nagilene collapsible 2 liter wide mouth canteen only use it when water is scarce or going into camp at night  wide mouth makes it easier to get water out of low flow sources 
Wide mouth Gatorade bottle  I use this all day  I found I can go 5 miles in hot weather if I camel up and carry it out full but that’s my way of being light.extremely durable
Steri pen adventure  not the lightest or most durable  that being said I have had mine over 10 years I protect it with my life it is the fastest most convenient way to treat water I’m drinking water in 90 seconds  at the end of a hard day I do t want to expel more energy than I need to or have to wait for water worth the extra few ounces  
Bic micro lighter
Knife is a micro folding utility knife  found it at lowes
First aid kit  ha ha lol what first aid kit having had first aid training in the marine corps, Boy Scouts, and as a life guard there are a few items  I carry  duct tape wrapped  on trekking poles 1 sheet of mole skin  and 1 small pack of antibiotic cream   Ibuprofen this is all  I found  I can take care of everything from broken bones to cuts  to blisters till I can get to town
Down puff jacket
2 pair darn tough socks
Walmart bathing suit cut the liner out  light dries fast ( I’m switching to a kilt)
2 Walmart synthetic t shirt cheap dries fast hike In one sleep in other keeps the Stink down
Fleece non hooded  shirt 
Synthetic long pants  in cold weather with a pair of non cotton sweat pants for a insulting layer 
Oboz sawtooth hiking shoes fit right and durable
Oofos slip on’s for camp shoes pro athletes use thes as recovery shoes  I have even hiked in them to give feet a break almost switched my trail name  to oofos as I hiked in them for a couple of weeks  you feet will love you at the end of a hard day 
A large buff use as a hat  sleep with on over face and head when it’s cold quilt doesn’t have a hood use as a water filter for sediment 
Handkerchief  camp towel  water filter bandage etc
Battery pack from Walmart cost 10 bucks  recharges phone 4x and  wireless  earphones 2 x  small light weight 
I phone and charger with a dongle you can plug 2 thing into  phone and battery etc 
Large waterproof compression sack all clothes and sleeping bag stay in this 
Medium stuff sac for a food bag 
I large freezer bag for garbage  another for small that can’t get
Rain gear I’m undecided  I use to carry a cheap Frogg toggs poncho  I think I’m switching to a umbrella 
Knit hat when it’s cold
Head net for bugs  
Big juice 
Watch . I like to be able to track my time to water sources  and when to drink  I have found that I drink half my bottle every hour and every 2 hours  I eat   I try to source water every 2 hours or about 5 miles  this method allows me to keep my phone off  when I get to water source I’ll turn on phone to check my location and for next water source and shelter
Beside food and medication that’s it   Keep it light go faster further safer
Hope this helps",,View Entry,"Dec 02, Fri",0
