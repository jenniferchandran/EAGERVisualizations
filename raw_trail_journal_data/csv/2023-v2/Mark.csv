Mark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659994,"I Just returned from my pre-hike trip to Georgia.  It was four productive days.
Day 1 -- Stay in Dahalonega, GA.  Great little town.  Upon arrival I visited the visitor center and got the idea to do a short hike that day.  I started at Woody's gap and hiked southbound for 2 hours before having to turn around to make it back before dark.  Good hike up and down for 11 miles.
Day 2 -- I had reservations at the Hike Inn and make the 5 mile hike to the Hike Inn.  Great time,  great food and good people.Day 3 -- I hiked to the top of Springer Mountain and a little beyond.  Total 12 miles.  Lightened my pack since I was returning to the Hike Inn.
Day 4 -- Hiked from the Hike Inn on the green trail to the approach trail and back to Amicalola State Park.   About 5.5 miles
Headed back home to Texas.  Excellent trip,",,View Entry,"Jan 29, Sun",0
Mark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660157,It is about 45 days until my start. I'm working on conditioning and getting my pack weight down.  I'm at about 25lbs base weight and there doesn't seem to be very much room for elimination without either freezing to death or replacing major items.,,View Entry,"Feb 14, Tue",0
Mark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660158,"I plan to fly to GA on March 26 and stay in a hotel on the 26 and 27th to finalize packing and get stuff like food, water and fuel.  I'll get a ride to Amicalola State Park or the 28.  I will stay at the Hike Inn on the 28th and start the real hike on the March 29.   Just ease into it ....",,View Entry,"Feb 15, Wed",0
Mark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660214,I kind of wish I was on the trail already but sticking with my original start plan.  Looks like good hike weather.  I'm considering gettting the far-out app even though its a bit pricey.  I like the social networking capability but not sure it's worth the price.  I think trail intelligence will be important.,,View Entry,"Feb 21, Tue",0
Mark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660422,The preparation continues.  My start date is only a few weeks from now.  I wish I had started a little bit earlier but on the other hand there was a huge storm this week.  I think sticking to the plan is best.,,View Entry,"Mar 04, Sat",0
Mark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660764,It's getting close to my start date and I'm still preparing.  I'm out in Arizona this week and they have some awesome trails and mountains around Tuscon.  I hiked to the start point and a couple miles further in one trail.  It is possible to get on this trail and hike to the top of mount Lemon over the course of a couple days.  I don't have the time this trip but perhaps in the future.  Today I'll settle for a short seven miles,,View Entry,"Mar 15, Wed",0
Mark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661284,Made it to Atlanta and took the MARTA north.  Tomorrow will be a prep day before heading out to Amiclola State Park.Did a bunch 8 mile practice hikes this past week.  Hopefully this will condition my feet a little better.  No new blisters developing.,,View Entry,"Mar 26, Sun",0
Mark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661300,"Today is my last day before the hike gets real.  I walk to REI, Academy and Walmart.  I had just a bit of fine tuning on my list.  Finally bought a set of hiking poles at REI.  I haven't used them before but the blogs convinced me.  If someone finds a set up against a tree in the woods then you will know they didn't work for me (just kidding, I know leave no trace).  i didn't pick up very much other than that.  I bought a couple bags of dehyraded fruit at Walmart,  bic lighters  and 4 AAA batteries (only needed 1 for my ultralight electric toothbrush).  I almost didn't go to Walmart because it was an additional  2 miles to walk but couldn't find the items at Academy.  Its funny how Walmart draws us in.  There was also a Target on the way but it was also downhill, so I didn't go in.  I think I'm in the hiking mindset.
Tomorrow it is a 1 mile hike to the MARTA station and 2 stops up to North Springs where I meet my ride.  Tomorrow will not actually be day 1 for my hike.  I have a reservation at the Hike Inn.  The following day i will hike past the start point on springer Mountain.
Changing my trail name to SS-AISR.  I brought a free-be hat from a previous job on a now defunct program.  The hat seemed to fit well so I selected it from my hat collection.  If you ask why SS-AISR,  I would have to respond with the John Baluchi famous line from Animal House, ""why not"".",,View Entry,"Mar 27, Mon",0
Mark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661858,"I climbed the stairs at Amiclola State Park this was a 700 foot elevation change and probably as many stairs.  This made the hike to the Hike Inn a little more difficult. It was really easy compared to things to come.  The Hike Inn has bunk accomodations and serves family style dinner and breakfast.  After dinner, there is a presentation. This night's presentation was about the presenters hike in Scotland.  He also revealed that he was the author of Thru an Appalachian Trail Love Story.  I read that book before starting my hike and was thinking of Capt Stupid one of the characters who paid a cab driver an extra 10 dollars to drive him to the top of the falls.","Amiclola Falls State Park

Mark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661922,"Left the Hike Inn and walked the 4.5 miles to Springer Mountain which is the start of the Appalachian Trail.  I hiked an additional 6.2 miles to Hickory Flats Cemetery.  James and his wife are camped there for a month along with their dogs to provide trail magic to hikers coming through.  It was a easy way to spend the first night. There was a nice grassy area to set up a tent and James maintained a camp fire.  I met Nick from Canada and Linda from Ft Worth,  Texas who would track with me for the first 30 miles until Neal Gap. This site was 2 miles short of the shelter but a great place to camp.  Weather was good at this point, cool nights and good hiking weather.  My pack is weighing heavy a 38 pounds. The evening featured automatic machine gun fire and helicopters doing insertions.  This area is used as a training area for the mountain phase of the Army's Ranger School.","Hike Inn

Mark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661926,Good hike today.  Got some trail magic from the 5th Ranger Training Battalion in the form of a water buffalo left at Cooper Gap.  This is a good thing because it is a hot day and there is little water in this area.
