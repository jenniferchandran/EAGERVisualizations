Thomson Family,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665211,"3 day practice thru-hike. Hot, mostly sunny weather. Just finished setting up our 2nd night camp and roasting marshmallows again. We had a nice long swim this evening and washed off the 10 miles of trail we hiked today. Kids are doing well hiking, especially the older two but camping life is hard, no way around it.",,View Entry,"Jun 08, Thu",0
Thomson Family,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665787,"Yesterday we realized the kids don’t have much hiking mikes with a lot of elevation gain. Our first day on the AT is about 2,000 ft of gain in 7 miles so we wanted to give the kids a chance for steeper hiking beforehand. We headed to our local “mountain” which has a loooong and steep stair climb. We put in about an hour and a half and the kids did great despite the oppressive heat. 
The highlight for me was having the family run a practice drill of putting on our rain jackets and pack covers. Rain is often a daily occurrence on the AT so I wanted to be ready. Erin and the kids balked at the idea of practicing something so simple. In my past as a firemen however, I was trained to practice everything. Finally the agreed and what ensued was a complete comedy of errors. 
I had my jacket and pack cover on within 30 seconds (mountain storms can move in quickly) while the kids floundered and couldn’t find jackets or had packed rain covers at the very bottom of their packs.  After about 15 minutes of what felt like a 3 stooges scene, we all had pack covers on (except Ford who declared he left it at home only to find it in his pack when we got home). 
Once again, we left our training hike more prepared than we began.",,View Entry,"Jun 21, Wed",0
Thomson Family,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665917,"We finally reached the point of no return (and it’s more beautiful than I imagined). After years of dreaming and months of scheming we are here at the start of our journey. Our car has been picked up and driven hours north where we hope to pick it up towards the end of our journey. We have burned the ships, there is no way back but only forward. Anywhere we go from here will be on our own two legs. 
I’d be leaving out the full story if I didn’t say we were full of fears and worries at this point. Although there is a sense of peace when you realize there is no more planning, purchasing or packing to do. Just strap on your pack and start walking. 
Undertaking this endeavor with 4 precious little ones weighs heavy on your mind. I’ve had many fleeting moments of panic on the drive out here, wondering if I’ve overlooked some crucial planning element or left out a critical piece of gear. But now we’re here, there is nothing left to do. 
I polled the family tonight to ask what their biggest concerns were as we step into the unknown tomorrow. These are the responses from the kids - 
The mountains being so steep we can’t make it up. Bears taking our food when we’re days from a resupply pointForgetting to pack something
From Erin and I the fears were - 
Not sleeping wellTicksPoison ivyKids getting sick or hurt
We’ll revisit those fears at the end and see how things played out. We also prayed with the kids about those specific fears. 
I think at this point we’re all just ready to start this hike we’ve talked about for so long.  We hiked the first mile of the approach trail without packs today so we can jump on the trail next to the hotel  tomorrow. It’s actually 7 more miles or so of hiking to get to the official start of the AT. Weather forecast is looking favorable, temps in 70’s with passing showers at times.","Amicalola Falls SP

Thomson Family,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666226,"Day 1. We left Amicalola Falls Lodge at 8am sharp. We arrived in the hotel restaurant when it opened at 7am for a buffet breakfast. We kept telling the kids this was the last food they would eat for awhile that they didn’t have to carry. 

We finished up, took one last potty break and shouldered our packs. Before walking out the hotel doors we stopped for a moment and I told the kids that once we stepped over that threshold, we would never be the same again. A bit dramatic maybe but I truly felt we were embarking on an adventure that would leave its mark on each one of us.  

We started up the trail full of anxious energy. There was a lot of excitement as we saw new trees and insects and wondered what would lie ahead. 
7 miles of hiking brought us to the top of Springer Mountain, the official Southern Terminus of the Appalachian Trail. We stopped for a snack and to let the kids climb a large, old, gnarled tree where they rested in its branches like weary baby birds. We grabbed a family photo and started our “official” hike of the AT. We quickly came to our first shelter, the Springer Mtn Shelter. It had a ladder going up to a loft which in our kids eyes was the wilderness equivalent of bunk beds. They were ready to stay for the night even though it was about 2pm. 
We debated staying or pressing on, knowing the next shelter could be worse or already taken. I had cell service so I was able to search for an image of the next shelter less than 3 miles away. I showed the photo to the kids and with just one glance between themselves, the decision had been made. The photo of the next shelter showed it was even larger AND had a ladder. It was unanimous. Onward we pressed!
We arrived at Stover Creek and found a lovely camping area and shelter with picnic table, it was all we could have hoped for. We were one day into our hike and things were looking good.","

Thomson Family,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666032,"What a day!  First of all a quick backstory. The Appalachian Trail is known for it’s trail culture.  This includes something known as “trail magic” which includes “Trail Angels”. These are people who wait at road crossings to give food, drinks and goodies to AT hikers. 
After a gorgeous morning of hiking through towering pine trees along a crystal clear creek we stopped for lunch along a forest service road. The kids were struggling and we still had 6-7 miles to hike after lunch to make it to the next shelter. It was going to be rough. After lunch and a quick nap lying in the dirt we hiked a couple more miles and then met Max Forester, our first “trail angel”.
We came off a steep mountain into a gap or low spot next to another forest service dirt road. There was Max calling out to us. We just took him for a jolly older man out for a picnic and then he told us this setup was for us!  
We had read about trail magic but I was taken back to actually experience it. Erin and Scout got camp chairs to sit in and we all got cold waters (that we didn’t have to filter or carry) and the kids got air heads and tootsie pops. My favorite part was he made the kids say “please” and “thank you” but in a fun and silly way that reminded them about manners. He kept saying, “we may be living in the woods but we’re NOT savages” and then let out a boisterous laugh. He was a character, and he took our minds off the struggles of hiking. 
He also served the ladies first every time and he took our trash, which is a big deal when you’re thru hiking as it adds up quick for a family of 6. Such small gestures of kindness have a huge impact when you’re exhausted, dirty, hungry, thirsty and carrying a huge pack.
After more chatting more and getting to know us Max offered to “slack pack” for us. Meaning he’d take all of our packs and drive them to the next road crossing while we hiked a really tough section pack free. We were thrilled. Funny note here; I realize that we met a stranger in the woods, let him give our kids candy and then handed him ALL of our earthly processions. Life just works differently on the trail I suppose :)Just as we said our goodbye to hike, Erin noticed his phone buzzed with a thunderstorm warning signal but we didn’t think much of it. We practically ran up the steep mountain feeling weightless with no packs and made it to the top in 40 min or so. We noticed the weather had changed, the air was heavy and still and the skies looked dark in the distance. We had reception up on the mountain and I checked radar. There was an enormous storm headed our way and it looked fast. By the time we reached the bottom Max was there.  He said “We have a bit of a situation”. He showed us his radar app and said “I don’t think I should leave you here.”
Immediately a thunderclap overhead rang out and a gusty wind started bending the tree tops. Max said if we’d let him. He would drive us to a hostel in town. Erin and I looked at the sky, looked at each other and said “YES”. 
Somehow we got 7 people and 6 giant packs into a small car in about 60 seconds as the storm showed up in full force. Driving the next 20 min down that first road felt like an Indiana Jones movie as tree limbs crashed all around us and even on the car. An entire tree came down once and we barely made it by. 
Max told us he had been praying God would send someone whom he could help today and decided to drive the hour and a half to the trail to just see what happened. Our first trail Angel turned out to be a true Godsend. God knew we needed help when we didn’t!
Now we’re in a warm, dry hostel full of wonderful hikers. It’s the same hostel we had booked for tomorrow night so we plan to leave our packs here tomorrow, slack pack all day and make up the miles we missed and then stay again tomorrow night as planned. 
It wasn’t the plan, but we’re learning to be flexible and accept help. I’m realizing no one really hikes the AT on their own, we all have receive help in different ways.","

Thomson Family,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666079,"We awoke to a beautiful, cool, sunny morning here in North Georgia. The air had that freshness that only happens after a good rain. After a hearty breakfast at the hostel we got on trail at the point where we stopped for the storm yesterday. We left our packs at the hostel and just used one of their small backpacks for our food and water. The practice is called “slackpacking”. Some say, once you slack pack you never go back :)
We set off at a great pace and ran into “No rush” and our other new hostel friends from the night before.  They were hiking south so it was fun to pass familiar faces on the trail.  The trail begins to quickly feel like a family.
it was so nice hiking all day without carrying all of our gear. The younger kids especially loved it as their packs really slow them down. We made it a whopping 14 miles today which is the most our kids have ever walked in a day. Keep in mind there is almost zero level ground on the AT, so that 14 miles includes ALOT of ups and downs.  We pushed hard today to get the miles in since tomorrow we climb our biggest mountain yet and we’d like to keep the miles to six or seven total. 
We had perfect weather again and only saw a few other people all day. What we did see a lot of was evidence of yesterday’s storm. We were reminded all day of how thankful we were for our trail Angel experience yesterday. The entire trail was littered with leaves, twigs, branches and even trees. It would have been so frightening to be in the forest during that storm. 
One thing we’re learning is the unique challenges of hiking with kids.  Our kids are doing fantastic physically so far, it’s other, unforeseen challenges we’re learning to navigate. For instance, our youngest son talked for 14 miles straight today. That’s no exaggeration. 14 MILES of “Daddy, do ants poop?” “Daddy, can a great blue whale eat all other animals”, “Mommy, can we play 20 questions again” (once the answer was a broken branch and the next game a broken twig). Erin, bless her heart, hiked with him most of the day and listened as only a mother could for almost 9 hours straight. I made a point of hiking up ahead and making sure no bears were on the trail. 
We got picked up off a forest road about 6pm and came back to the hostel to shower and eat all the food we could. The young man in charge of the hostel, “Achilles”, brought us ice cream tonight about 9:30. After 14 miles of hiking you wouldn’t believe the kids could still run to the kitchen that fast!","

Thomson Family,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666132,"After two consecutive nights of comparative luxury in a hostel we were ready to get back to roughing it so we packed up our things and bid farewell to our hostel family and hit the trail with full packs on. Yesterday we hiked an easy 6.2 miles including a mountain that was not as bad as we anticipated. After lunch the trail passes through on old CCC building (the only building the AT passes through on its 2100 mile journey).  That building is home to a wonderful backpacking outfitter that knows just what hikers need and want.  We were excited to arrive as this is one of the landmarks on the AT and a place of refuge for weary travelers.  As we approached the entrance a thickly bearded gentleman named “Just Bill” called out to us to come on in.  As we got closer he said “welcome home”.  I was moved at those simple words and realized how much it means to be shown hospitality when you’re tired and dirty and far from home.  
The kids all picked out a candy treat and we got some free items as well as someone before us had left $20 with the cashier as “trail magic” for the next thru hikers that came along (so many kind souls out here). We also bought a frozen pizza that they cooked for us and we sat outside taking in a great view and using their water spigot to refill all our bottles. 
We hit the trail again and after about a mile of climbing found a suitable campsite right off the trail. We arrived about 4:30 which felt too early to stop but we decided since it was our first time making our own camp (no shelter or privy here) we’d give ourselves plenty of time. There was a lot to do. We found a tree with a low enough limb for our bear hang, walked 1/4 mile to find a small spring and carried back 20 liters for filtering and “showering” (we brought an ultralight shower bag on the trip and each night we take an invigorating cold spring water shower). We lit a fire and started our water boiling for dinner. Set up two tents and unpacked all our bedding. We ended up transforming a bare spot of ground in the middle of the forest into a happy little temporary home.  We’re so thankful for all the practice we did setting up a camp, learning how to hang food in trees to keep bears out, etc.  There’s a lot that goes into setting a camp up especially with kids.
The wind picked up during the night and it was very cold. We’re all in jackets and shuffling around very cold this morning. Ready to hit the trail and warm up!","

Thomson Family,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666191,"Day 5 on the trail. Perfect weather again, temps 60’s to low 70’s with gentle breeze. We hiked 10 tough miles. 
About midday we reached a mountain peak and ran into a local hiking group of retirees. We had also met them the previous day on Blood Mtn. We all had a laugh at the irony that we were on the same peaks at the same time 2 days in a row but they had comfy beds, showers and hot meals since we saw them last. 
They warned us about some copper heads under a rock ledge further up the trail. We really appreciated the warning because rock ledges are exactly the kind of place our kids love to explore. Sure enough, when we arrived we found a nest of copperheads under a ledge on a sunny outcropping. 
I poked one with a stick to see what reaction we got but the snake didn’t pay much attention. Mainly I wanted the kids to see just how fast they could strike so they’d have a healthy fear of vipers. We had seen at least one snake each day so far but all non-venomous.  We observed a large 4ft black rat snake outside our first shelter. After watching how easily he moved across the terrain we all moved our bedding from the ground floor to the second story of the shelter. Then we saw a small snake crossing the trail the next day. Last night we had a beautiful ring-necked snake crawl out of our campfire and I was able to catch him so the kids could pet him. 
Seeing the copper head though was a good reminder for us all to watch where we sit down or place our packs during a break. 
After that the last few miles were tough as we pushed on to the next shelter. We had to bribe our youngest with treats to get to the finish line. I suppose really good trail parenting involves knowing when to break out the secret stash of motivational candy. 
We finally arrived at a simple but pleasant shelter in a grove of splendidly tall trees and a quiet little babbling brook. I believe in these parts it would be called a “holler”.   We arrived about 6pm so quickly set up our camp and got water boiling for another fine dinner of Erin’s dehydrated wonders she whips up in the camp kitchen. “Cheesy Spuds” and Alfredo Beef pasta never tasted so good!
We collected water from the stream 30ft away for filtering and our new tradition of nightly showering. The kids are really enjoying the cold showers at night and this water is COLD. It bubbles up from the ground as cold and clear as can be. We fill our shower bag and take turns washing away the day’s dirt and grime and laughing as the cold takes our breath away. We were in bed by 8:15 and spent a peaceful hour quietly reading and whispering to one another while watching and listening to the forest around us transform into night. Right before we fell asleep, a pack of coyotes began to howl, weaving their eerie music to our thoughts which soon turned to dreams.","

Thomson Family,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666225,"Day 6. We hiked another 10 miles today with extra motivation as we were scheduled to be picked up at 3pm at a road crossing and taken to a town for some R and R.  Before we went to bed we had a family meeting about the next day’s plan and how early we wanted to leave. There was a lot of big talking by some of our kids how they’d be up before 6 and ready to hike at 7. 
Well, the kids found that following through with action is a bit tougher than the making the plan but we did have our earliest start ever. We were on trail at 8am sharp! 
Even without breaking down tents (we slept in the shelter) there is a lot to be done each morning to prepare for the day ahead. All bedding and pads have to be stuffed, deflated or rolled up. You have to use the bathroom (always more challenging in the woods and with kids), brush your teeth, lower the bear hang bags, boil water, eat breakfast, wash dishes, put away your set of clean/sleep clothes and put back on your dirty/hiking clothes. We pack up the cooking gear, filter about 10 liters of water to refill camelbacks and bottles to get us to the next spring, take down the clothes line, remind the kids 4 times to refill their backpack hip belt pockets with morning snacks, remind the kids 3 times to stop jumping on the sharp rocks surrounding the fire pit, then stop and get out the first aid bag to get peroxide and a bandaid for the kid that kept jumping on the sharp rocks around the campfire. Next you have to look at your spouse and ask “are we crazy?”, or “why didn’t we just go to a resort in the Bahamas?”, put all the gear into 6 packs, walk around the campsite picking up left behind items and finally get packs on shoulders and start walking. So you can see, leaving by 8am is a true feat. 
We made our best time ever covering 4 miles in about 2 hours. The terrain was almost flat (there is no flat on the AT, just degrees of ups and downs) and the path was smooth instead of rocky. The kids were excited at the prospect of an early finish and more time in town. Oh how the trail must laugh at our feeble plans. Shortly thereafter the trail became very technical and rocky so our pace slowed. The reward was we entered a section of forest with an enchanted look. There was moss and glittering wet stone everywhere. If you are a fan of the old movie Labyrinth, well this section of forest looked like a place that David Bowie would magically appear wearing black leather pants and a ruffled blouse. 
We did not see David Bowie thankfully but the kids were hoping to see a bear. Hikers on previous days reported a mamma bear with two cubs hanging near the trail. We kept our eyes scanning the forest and soon every tree stump looked amazingly like a bear but alas, we did not see the real thing. 
At lunch we met a young hiker “Raptor” who was just days away from finishing the entire AT. He gave our kids some peanut butter M&Ms so they are now his friends for life. Meeting people on the trail has been our most unexpected highlight of this trip. Everyone on the trail has a story and it’s such a joy hearing those stories.  No one just wanders out here on accident. Something has driven them to the trail, but what is fascinating is that most don’t know why they are here when they start, that’s what they discover as time goes on.   “Why are we here?” I often ask. We don’t know…yet. 
We made it a bit early to our 3pm pickup and our camp mate, Jeff, from the previous night was waiting for the same pickup. We all road to town together and Jeff asked the kids what they most missed in while in the woods. “Smoothies, Açaí Bowls, real pillows, mattress and sleeping-in” were their responses. 
One last story; when we arrived in town we dropped our stuff on the cabin porch. While we waited for my phone to charge so we could get the key code from my email we walked across the road and swam in the creek in our hiking clothes. 
After putting on our dry clothes we ate outside at a riverfront restaurant. At one point, W - our oldest son, said his hands were sticky and he needed to go wash. We saw him walk to the rivers edge and bend down to wash in the river. We laughed out loud to think that his first inclination after a week in the woods was to go to the river instead of the bathroom to wash. Thankfully he hadn’t needed to pee :)","

Thomson Family,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666259,"Day 7 - This was our first “zero day” meaning we made no progress on the trail. We rented a cabin for 2 nights and had a day off in Helen, GA. Our plan is to take a zero day once per week, hike 6 days and then rest 1. The Sabbath model you could call it. Our bodies, minds and gear need a day to rest and repair.   Plus it gives us little mini-vacations along the way to explore new areas  
We focused a lot on eating today. We’ve eaten a LOT of dessert!  They say calories don’t count on the trail so we’re taking that to the bank. We’ve had ice creams, strawberry pie, peanut better pie, cookies and more. There is a sense of urgency when you come to town to start eating as much as you can while you have access to food you don’t have to carry. We have the coolest store ever about 100 ft from our cabin. They sell everything g and I mean everything. We’ve bought lots of goodies there and resupplied for the next leg of hiking.
The kids and I floated the river through town for 2 hours which was just the right mix of relaxation and excitement. This town is like New Braunfels 40 years ago, even all the building are German architecture. We had to walk a mile each way to get to the float outfitter but a mile seems pretty tame to us at the moment.  Especially a flat mile of sidewalks with no rocks to dance over or poison ivy to weave around. 
After a week in the woods I was sort of secretly hoping our kids would magically become perfectly behaved.  No toys, no screens, no sitting at desks; Just lots of fresh air and exercise and adventure. That’s not unreasonable is it?  I’m not sure why I thought that but I’m here to report that our kids still bicker and argue just like before. However, I have noticed a change. I have not heard complaining. Almost none (that’s from myself as well). This rental we’re staying in has some serious flaws, including very scratchy sheets. I noted that scratchiness the first night and then contentedly crawled into the sheets, thankful for a dry, soft bed and a room with 4 walls that I wasn’t sharing with strangers… I mean, new friends. 
This wasn’t a forced thankfulness such as, “You could be in a tent right now so you better be grateful for these scratchy sheets”. Or when your parents told you to eat all your food because children in China were starving but that didn’t really foster a sense of true gratefulness for your own food. I think everyone in our family is feeling more grateful for those simple things we’ve always had. If I am being really honest, I think one of our reasons for doing this trip is we wanted our kids to learn to do without. We wanted them to understand how much we have in life. Erin and I probably need that lesson just as much as them. 
I am also happy to report that we are all missing the trail and are excited to return. There something so clean and simple about the rhythm of trail life. Wake up, pack up, hike for 8-10 hours, eat, sleep, repeat.   Our first week is in the books, our second leg will include our longest stretch in the wilderness yet. We’re excited to see what’s ahead.","

Thomson Family,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666328,"Day 8 - 5.7 miles.  Today was a low mileage day since we got back on trail at 11am.  We hiked just shy of 6 miles though the terrain was very challenging.  We ascended 2400 ft and descended 1100 ft during those 5.7 miles.  The younger kids struggled physically but some fun music played on our mini speaker and a stick of gum lifted their sprits enough to get the job done. 
About 4 miles into the hike we started hearing the deep rumble of thunder. Not a reassuring sound when you’re climbing a mountain. We were trying to move quickly to get to the shelter before the storm arrived when Erin slipped and fell on a slick rock.  Her forehead got banged up pretty good but we made it to the shelter and were able to clean it up, dig out some little embedded pebbles, and got her all bandaged.  She’s one tough mother. 
When we arrived at the shelter there was another family here with 2 kids the same ages as ours playing cards in the shelter.  They are from Nashville, and live in the same area Erin grew up and even know some mutual friends.  They are both attorneys and also have a daughter with the same name as ours. Lots of fun connections. 
We really enjoyed visiting with them and cooking dinner together.  The husband had thru hiked the AT during law school so we asked lots of questions and he told us stories from hiking the AT “back in the day”.   
After dinner they retired to their tent and we spread out in the shelter for the night.  With a frightening clap of thunder, the long threatened storm finally showed up in force.  Some of us stripped down to our shorts, turned up the music and danced around in the cold driving rain for our evening shower. 
After drying off, we all put on our sleeping clothes and spread out our sleeping pads and bags. We sat on tbe shelter platform playing cards and listening to Kenny Rogers while a peaceful steady rain fell outside. 
So here we are. All bedded down back in the wilderness. A cold wind is blowing the treetops around, the temp has dropped below 60* and the kids are peacefully asleep in their bags. We’re definitely adjusting to the forest.  It’s much less scary than a week ago. 
Each day on the trail brings so many unexpected events. So many ups and downs.  Just as the trail goes endlessly up and down so does our experience.  A great view, then a knee-jarring downhill; a lunch break, then an arduous uphill; a good steady pace; then a slip and fall induced first aid stop. You just never know what’s around the next bend. But we’re learning to be okay with that.","

Thomson Family,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666350,"Day 9 - When Things Get Tough
Today was a difficult day. Our most trying yet and tough in a myriad of ways. First of all we hiked 11.5 miles.  That’s after a cold and windy night in the shelter. The kids all slept well but I did not. It’s tough to hike 11.5 miles after not sleeping. 
We had our earliest start yet, we were on the trail at 7:38am. That felt like a huge win.  We’re getting better at something. This is even after chatting and saying goodbye to our new friends.  
Everyone hiked well today but we had several more falls (none serious) including our daughter who somehow fell and hit her knee, then her head then flipped head over heels onto her back and back to her feet. She did a full somersault on a steep rocky trail and popped back up right before my eyes. She didn’t shed a tear and had just one little scrape on her knee. I told her we were changing her trail name from “Trail Dolphin” to “Flipper”. 
Then our youngest son fell a couple times, nothing serious, just run of the mill knee scrapes but every fall induces anxiety in you as a parent.  After Erin fell yesterday I didn’t feel like my nerves could handle any more falls. (Erin is fine by the way, we had her cut checked out at a clinic today)
At midday we could not find a good spot for lunch and everyone was famished. The AT in the summer is like a thin ribbon of trail snaking through dense underbrush. You often can not get off the trail at all.  If you did manage you’d likely be waist deep in poison ivy (sounding fun yet?). So you have to look for clearings or camping spots to eat lunch.  
We never found one today so we just sat on a leafy area free of poison ivy. We put our sit pads down, got out all the lunch bags, took off shoes and were in the maximum state of gear disarray right before taking our first, much-needed bites of food when our oldest screamed “I HAVE A TICK!!”  
There are not a lot of things I fear, but ticks inhabit my nightmares. I find them to be the most loathsome creatures on God’s green Earth.  When my son yelled those words I flew to my feet and immediately felt itchy all over. I was just sure I was covered in ticks too. Thankfully Erin jumped to more productive action and grabbed the tweezers and had that tick off by the time I had danced around in a few circles. 
We hastily repacked all of our gear, stomachs still empty, and hiked away from there as fast as possible after we had all checked each other for more ticks. That was a real low point for us. The sort of moment you ask, “what are we doing!?”  We hiked another mile and found a semi suitable lunch spot that appeared tick-free. After a quick lunch we had an a 2.5 mile downhill stretch to our pickup location.  Where a resupply box and night in a hotel was waiting for us. 
We made it down and got a ride to town where we checked into Holiday Inn Express. It was the only game in town that allowed 6 guests.  After a dip in the very depressing, yet refreshing, indoor pool, we split up and I took the kids to DQ for a blizzard while Erin headed to a clinic to look at her cut. 
Sometime during all of this a storm rolled through and knocked out power. So now we’re sitting in a Holiday inn Express, and our room is hot and dark and we have gear everywhere.  Erin is gone and I’m worried about her.  First what the doctor will say and then how will she get home in the storm. 
Finally Erin shows up at our room, freshly bandaged with a clean bill of health. The clinic gave her an umbrella to walk back so she wasn’t soaked.  We were all safe and together even if it was dark and steamy in the room. All the other guests left the hotel, that’s what you do when you have a car. This is a small town, no Uber or Lyft. It’s also July 4th weekend and anything walking distance was full. So it looked like we were stuck. 
And here we are still. Kids asleep on top of the blankets. Last night we slept in a shelter cold and windy. Tonight, a budget hotel room hot and still.  Oh, the irony of this being our “town” night.  We did not get our laundry all washed as hoped but we all get mattresses for the night and I’m pretty sure there are no bears in the hotel (or anyone else). 
Tomorrow we head back to the trail for our longest stretch yet. 40 miles in 4 days is the goal.  This will take us past the 100 mile mark and across a state line.  We’re nervous but excited for the next challenge ahead.  The days are getting tougher but so are we.

Thomson Family,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666411,"Day 10 - Border Crossing
Today we hiked 11.8 miles of AT.  Our packs are laden with food for 4 days and we were all feeling the extra weight. Today’s trail had lots of ups and downs but mostly ups, including our 2 steepest climbs yet.  We climbed 4,355 ft up today and descended 2,500 ft.  That’s a lot of ups and downs!  Somewhere in there we also had about 100ft of level ground :)
When we got dropped off at the trailhead this morning another man parked his car near us and started getting hiking gear out. I also noticed he had crutches, not the kind for a broken leg but the ones used by people with braces on their legs.  We struck up a conversation with him and found out he was hiking a 5 mile section today to finish up the Georgia leg of the AT. It’s his 4th state!  He told us his trail name is “4 feet” and that he used to weigh 572 lbs!  He has severe back issues now and was hunched over. That’s why he walks with the crutches. Right about this time Erin realized she left her headlamp at the hotel. Without hesitation, 4 feet opened his bag and said “take mine, I won’t need it for a day hike” and handed it to Erin.  That interaction sums up our experience with people on the trail so far.  We’ve been blown away by the eagerness to help others we’ve encountered. 
We said goodbye to our new friend, feeling convicted that we had no cause for complaining about the hike today, said a prayer for our 4 day hike and set off. The kids hiked incredibly strong as we started the morning hiking through some low level clouds. The kids got a kick out of the idea they were in a cloud. Our youngest was disappointed to learn you can’t stand on clouds.  
The forest was very cool and wet, with leaves dripping on us as we passed underneath. We went ahead and put on our pack covers thinking it would rain soon. The rain never came so we had yet another day of hiking the AT dry. We must be setting a record at this point. 
After hiking a couple of hours (and finding a couple more ticks!) we met a sweet couple named “Red Stick” and “Dancing Wind”. They met on their AT thru hike in 2010 and are now married with 2 kids.  They were getting three days back on the trail together to hike and relive old memories. 
We stopped for lunch in a nice shelter with three levels. There was a plaque inside showing an army helicopter delivering it to the mountaintop years ago.  We broke out the tortillas and had tacos for lunch which was a treat for all. Each shelter has a register, or notebook, that people write in. I always write something, even if we stop for lunch. When I opened this register, Red Stick had just written that morning. As I flipped through the past week of entries I recognized the names of many people we’ve met.  I imagine many of them also see our entries as they travel south. Just one of the many ways you get to know people on the trail. 
Early afternoon we crossed into North Carolina. That was a sweet moment knowing the entire Georgia section of the AT is behind us. Mostly, I won’t miss it. They were tough miles for us as we all gained our trail legs. 
We hiked a full day and arrived at our intended campsite but decided to go 2.5 miles more and get out steepest climbs yet behind us.  Weary, we rolled into a shelter area at dusk. We saw mice in the shelter so decided to tent camp. We had a hurried time getting everything setup before dark and were exhausted. Erin fed us a great dinner as usual and I had to fix up two bear hangs as our 4 days of food were too heavy to hoist all together. 
The boys in my tent played “battle” with cards for about 5 min. They then put their heads in the pillows and were out in less than 60 seconds.  I won’t be far behind them.","

Thomson Family,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666528,"Day 11 - The Talking Game
Today we hiked 12.5 miles of the AT. That’s our most with packs on I believe. Weather was fair, temps in 60’s and low 70’s again.  We climbed 2307 ft and descended 2305 ft.  Ha!  A lot of work and no vertical gain to show for it.  There actually is a term for this AT phenomenon - PUDs or Pointless Ups and Downs. The AT is infamous for them. A full day of ascending and descending only to end up at the elevation you began at.  It’s part of the fun. 
So after a great night’s sleep by all we hit the trail at 8:30 and immediately got something right.  Our hiking order.  The trail has been single file width almost the entire time so hiking order is a big part of our day, as in who hikes in front of or behind who. 
When we get it correct, hiking pace and conversation flow along easily and our family hikes like a well-oiled machine. When the order is off, things break down and tempers flare or tears flow.  Hiking order changes throughout the day but you’re often stuck in the order for extended periods. 
Sometimes people want to talk or play 20 questions. Some hike fast, some slow. If you want to be quiet and the person in front of and behind you want to play the “I’m going on a hike and I’m bringing an Apple…” game, well you’re in for a long hour.  
This morning our two oldest paired up and hiked out of eyesight into the lead. Our two youngest paired up and played “The talking game”.  Erin and I hiked in the back and got an hour or more of uninterrupted time. A first in almost 100 miles!  
Now this talking game, It’s basically just what it sounds like. The kids just talk, and somehow it’s a game. I don’t get it. It usually involves outlandish scenarios and big houses. I overheard snippets today and they included discussing a giant home with an arcade and skating rink in the basement. Jet skis were somehow involved as well as various weapons. I didn’t even try to understand but what I did understand and greatly appreciate was the kids didn’t even realize they were hiking. We went 5 miles before our first break. We didn’t even stop for a standing break. It was glorious. 
A lot of what Erin and I do each day has nothing to do with hiking, it’s what we call “Trail Parenting”.  It has all the challenges of normal parenting 4 kids but then you add heavy packs, long miles, ticks, poison ivy, snakes, going #2 in the woods, etc… and try to motivate your children to move 2mph through wet rocky terrain while being grateful and thinking of others first while you work on your patience. Easy peasy. 
The hiking is easy, it’s the trail parenting that is tough, very tough. Hats off to our kids though as they have come so far. They are showing so much gratitude and more and more often think of their siblings needs first. 
We’re in a shelter right now. We made it just before a storm blew in and we it rained for a hour then cleared for a gorgeous sunset. 
That’s all for now. Daddy long leg spiders are crawling all over me, as I write this. Everyone else is asleep but I may go set up the tents now…","

Thomson Family,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666603,"Day 12 -  Hitting 100 Miles!
Today he hiked 8.6 miles. A pretty easy mileage day but it allowed us to end up at the nicest shelter area we’ve seen yet around 3:30pm and have some time to rest. 
So last night as I was journaling I was being invaded by daddy long leg spiders crawling over me.  I tried hiding in my sleeping bag for awhile but they still found me.  I kept checking on the kids with my headlamp but saw no spiders on them.  Maybe I was sleeping right on their spidery highway?  
I decided to get up around 10:30pm and setup both tents, alone, in the dark. There are notices posted all around this shelter about the increased bear activity. While setting up the tents I kept looking over my shoulder and wishing my headlamp beam could penetrate further into the oily blackness as I imagined a bear emerging from the shadows and sneaking up behind me. 
I quickly got the tents up.  And headed back for Erin and the kids. I carried our sleeping daughter to the tent and zipped her up. I went back for the next and Erin had woken up and asked what I was doing?  I explained that there were spiders everywhere and they were attacking me. She shined her headlamp and said “where”?  I felt like a crazy person as I looked around, seeing none, and replied “they were here just a minute ago.”  Her look seemed to be saying “I’m sure they were sweetheart, now why don’t you go back to sleep, it was just a bad dream”. 
At this point though I had just set up two tents in a dark forest by myself AND carried one sleeping child with bedding out there. I pleaded with Erin to join me and help me get the other kids. She just yawned and turned over and went back to sleep.  So I crawled into the tent with my daughter and slept a fitful night dreaming of spiders. 
After a rough nights sleep with some of us in a tent and some in a shelter, we awoke to find overcast skies.  Soon after a steady rain began to fall so we had a bit of a rain delay getting onto the trail. 
We hiked in light rain most of the morning but no one seemed to mind. It was chilly and damp but the hiking kept us warm enough.  We hit one section of trail that was so overgrown we thought we’d lost our way. It was so itchy walking through the waist high plants as they brushed over our wet legs. 
Finally the trail opened up and we had some of our widest pathways yet. You could even walk two abreast.  One thing about the AT is it’s so much forest that it can feel claustrophobic. I love being in the woods, but endless woods takes some getting used to. 
We came upon one of the first truly spectacular vistas this morning and the kids were spell bound. A rocky outcrop allowed us to gaze out over 50 miles of mountaintops all poking through a sea of clouds like islands in a white sea down below us. 
The latter morning hike was very pleasant and including our steepest section yet with stairs cut into the stone and a rope handrail. At the top was Mt Albert and the reward from the fire tower on top should have been 360* views. The clouds had surrounded us though and all we could see was a white mist.  
Also adding to the disappointment was the fact that after climbing all the steps of the fire lookout tower, the trap door leading to the top was locked. No way to get on the top deck and no view was disappointing. Our daughter and middle son cried. They had climbed several miles to get there and hoped for more view. 
A sign was posted saying the top deck was locked to prevent vandalism. Our daughter asked what “vandalism” means. We said it’s when people break things or spray paint someone’s property. Our youngest son innocently asked “Daddy, can’t they just put a sign saying don’t spray paint”.  We told him not everyone minds very well :)
Then he suggested that since it was a fire tower and I had been a fire fighter, I should call them and they’ll give me the key. Our kids REALLY wanted on top of that tower. They had to settle for lunch under the tower structure, keeping us dry from rain. We enjoyed a lunch of tuna along with crackers spread with peanut butter topped with peanut butter M&M’s.  Classic hiker fare.  I contemplated putting the peanut butter and M&M’s IN the Tuna for a hiker trifecta but resisted the urge. We’re not that desperate…yet. 
Shortly after lunch we hit the 100 AT mile mark which someone had commemorated with a “100” written with sticks on the side of the trail.  It’s difficult to believe we’ve walked over 100 miles together as a family.  
We arrived at a shelter around 3:30pm. The best one yet. It looked like a Acosta Rica yoga retreat center (at least to us after hiking three days). We had a wonderful evening bathing in the nearby creek, cooking, playing Spades and settling in for a near perfect evening watching the sky grow dark as sleep overtook us.","

 7.3 miles. 
Today we had a short hike to our pickup point where our very own mini van was waiting for us. Freedom on four wheels never looked so good!
We woke up about 6am to a beautiful dawn with crisp air. We all moved fairly quickly (some of our kids more quickly than others) and hit the trail at 7:40. At this point a 7 mile day is not really even hiking for us. Our youngest even shrugged off the idea of hiking 7 miles when he asked this morning “Daddy, do I even need to put snacks in my pack if it’s just 7 miles?”
This is the same son that claimed he could go no further after the first two miles of our first practice hike back in the spring. 
We made good time and made it to the van by noon. It felt SO GOOD to have our own transportation again.  We drove straight to town for lunch at noon. We all are burgers and smoothies with great delight. The restaurant was a nice place with outdoor patio seating by a creek. There were a lot of dressed up older people out for lunch. I looked at our family, kids with dirty faces and filthy shirts, wife with black eye and we all stunk.  When the food came we all ate like we were famished. I’m sure the other patrons were wondering about us. 
After that we ran by the grocery store and bought three tubs of ice cream along with some less important food groups and drove to our vacation rental. We had a great afternoon relaxing and catching up with our old friends who came to stay a couple days with us. 
Our oldest son said the blessing for dinner that night. He thanked God for the “non dehydrated food”.   :)","

Today we just did a day hike with our friends along the next section of the AT from where we had left off. We hiked 6.4 miles and crossed our first “bald”. These balls are features of the southern Appalachian Mountains that are a bit of a mystery.  While the majority of mountain peaks around here are covered in trees, these bales are bare if trees. No one knows why for sure. Many tribes of Indians lived in these mountains and some think they cleared the mountain tops for agriculture or villages. Some think the early European settlers did.  Possibly it was fire or a disease that killed the trees. Whatever the reason, they are wonderful. There are views and sunshine at the balds. Something you don’t get much if on the AT. 
It was an easy morning hike for us all and it was fun to have friends (and no packs) with us. We ran into our trail friend Miranda that we had camped with at our last shelter. Running into people you’ve met on the trail feels like seeing an old friend again. 
We took it easy the rest of the day. Eating and napping.","

11.63 miles. 
We had another day of fine, cool weather. We got dropped off by “Sherpa Al” about 9am and resumed our Northward march through the woods.  We all agreed it felt good to be back on the trail. Zero days are nice but there is a simple rhythm we experience on the trail that we miss in town. 
We had a great morning with mostly pleasant hiking and the kids were hiking strongly. We saw one other hiker all day. It was a man our age named “Bones”. He hiked half of the AT after college graduation in 2001 and now was back 22 years later to finish it!  We had a great time visiting with him. 
He had actually seen our entries in the trail registers as he was hiking behind us. That was the first time that’s happened. Our family trail name is “So Dang Sweet” so that’s how we introduce ourselves to the people we meet and how we sign the registers. 
We reached another bald today with a cool stone tower on top. There were families having picnics on the grass (parking lot nearby) and the view was spectacular!
Bones was there and he told us how he had slept on a fire tower two nights before. The same tower that was locked when we arrived and our kids cried. Bones showed the kids his photos of the inside of the tower so they at least got to see what it looked like. 
We took a quick snack break and pressed on deciding to have a late lunch closer to the shelter as rain was in the forecast. We arrived at the planned shelter for the night around 4pm. We didn’t like the look or feel of it. After some family deliberation we decided to fill water bottles at the spring and then press on. Not knowing where we’d camp or if there would be water. It was a gamble but we all wanted to get closer to tomorrow’s destination which should be a good one. 
We made it another 2 miles or so and the weather was threatening storms again. We found a great spring next to a terrible camp site. Lots of mud s d very slopes tent sites. We decided we’d have to make it work as the next shelter was 4 miles further and we’d be pushing up against darkness when we arrived. 
Erin made our supper while I found a suitable tree for a bear hang. We sat on wet logs and ate our dinner, I was grumbling about the campsite and wishing we’d pressed on but Erin had a great attitude. It’s not a perfect site but we just had to make do. Finding good camping for 6 people is a real challenge for us each night. That’s why we usually go for the shelters. Having things like a picnic table or shelves for cooking on and eating make our life much easier. 
We’re hoping for a dry night and a very early start…I just heard thunder rumble and now it’s raining. We haven’t had a rainy night in the tents yet. We’ll see how they do. 
We all voted that we would skip breakfast in the morning and just start hiking while eating snacks. We have about 10 miles tomorrow to reach out next destination and hope to arrive early because there is supposed to be swimming!","FS 69

Thomson Family,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666743,"Day 17 - Rain, More Rain and Grumbling
9.55 miles today
What a night.  Last night as I was writing our daily trail journal the rain drops began and they kept getting worse. Honestly, I don’t even like writing about it. One day it will be a proud bit of family lore how we all survived the rainstorm in leaking tents on a slanted muddy bank. Right now though, it just brings back miserable memories. 
In short, a huge storm rolled over us about 9:30pm and lasted until 4am. By this morning at 5:45 when we got up in the dark to break camp, sleeping bags, shoes, books, trail maps, socks, shirts, etc… were all soaked. Mud everywhere. 
A couple of us, myself in the lead, had really bad attitudes this morning. I had gotten about 1 hour of sleep all night and was hating life by the time we got up.  Most of us were bickering and barking at each other by headlamp this morning while sliding around on the mud trying to pack up tents and other gear. 
We skipped breakfast in our haste to leave the scene of our worst night yet and hit the trail at 7am. With the leaves high above still dripping rain water on us, we hiked in silence for almost an hour. Everyone was pretty miserable and didn’t want to talk. About 2 miles in we came to a fire tower and all climbed to the top. I boiled water for our breakfast and Erin’s coffee. As soon as the water was almost ready our oldest son walked by and tripped on the pot, spilling our precious hot water.  This initiated another round of angry words and tears. 
We used the last of our water to refill the pot and all sullenly stared at the gorgeous views around us as the rain clouds lifted.  With the sun leaking through and warming our cold dampness and with hot food in our bellies we began to apologize to each other.  We asked each other and the Lord to forgive our short tempers and sharp words. We talked about how hard the night was and how it wasn’t someone’s fault. Sometimes life is just hard. It’s how we deal with it that counts. 
In better spirits we left the tower and hiked along a ridge finding our first wild blueberry bushes. They provided a delightful snack for us all. However the trail soon became overgrown with briars and brambles, leaving us all scratched and itching. 
The trail seemed to never end today. The miles passed by hopelessly slowly. The latter half of the day was all descent, knee-jarring descent that was slower going down that it would have been going up. The scenery did improve with rocky, Colorado like trail conditions and massive views as we descended a ridge line. 
Around 2:30pm we arrived at Nantahala Outdoor Center. It’s like a ski resort for whitewater kayaking and rafting.  We all made it to the swim area of the river and happily waded in then jumped into the 49* water.  Soaking our swollen feet and rinsing off the mud and memories from the night before was the perfect end to this imperfect section of trail. 
We then checked into our room which turned out to be a bunkhouse with 3 bunk beds, and that’s all. Actually it had one light bulb and two outlets.  It was worse than most shelters we’ve stayed in. No bathroom, no pillows, no sheets or towels, nothing.  
After unpacking ALL of our gear and going to eat we returned to the room and it dawned on me how ridiculous it was to pay $180 per night for this.  I looked in the shared bathroom and was appalled.  Even our middle son pointed out accurately that our room felt like a prison cell. He was right, except even prison cells have toilets and sinks. 
I called and found another option available so we packed up and walked over. We had to get two rooms but turned our two adjoining rooms “adjoined” by walking down the hall to each other.  Oh well, it was so much better than the bunkhouse AND the tents the night before.  Plus we had sheets, towels AND real pillows.  Our youngest son was the only one unhappy with the upgrade, he wanted the prison cell bunk beds.","

13.9 miles.  4748ft of ascent 3,307 ft of descent 
Sunny 68*
Today we slackpacked because of the big elevation changes. The kids would have struggled with full packs.  We hit the trail at 7:30 and had gorgeous weather. The trail immediately was interesting with giant smooth boulders of what appeared to be marble. The trail was not overgrown at all and we had several stretches of my favorite - pine needle covered trail. There are few things more pleasant than pine needle covered foot paths, especially if it’s sandy soil under those needles. It reminds me of playing in the woods as a boy in the piney woods north of Houston. 
We had about 7 miles of steady ascent but everyone was hiking strong.  We make better time on uphill than downhill. Well, actually the kids go faster than Erin and I on the downs, they seem to have joints made of rubber. 
We had a lunch of tuna packets and trail mix along with a yummy mango rice bowl. One of Erin’s many food wins on this trip. One of the kids even told her today that her dehydrated cooking has come a LONG way since our first practice hike.  He’s right!
We filled water bottles in a spring and set off for the second half of the hike. Ups and downs but more downs.  All was well until about mile 10. Then the tears began to flow from the youngest two for various infractions by their siblings such as passing them on the hike or not letting them pass. They were just tired we knew so we got out the speaker and started playing music. It’s amazing how quickly it can change everyone’s mood!  We had a fun last couple miles singing to songs and hiking with a lighter step. 
Right at the end our oldest son got stung by 4 hornets. Collectively we’ve had about 10 stings on our journey. The usual culprit is some sort of ground nesting hornet.  When you walk by they sting you in the leg before you even see them. The pain is intense. I’ve gotten three so far. Baking soda (mixed with water and applied to the sting) has turned out to be the most used item in our first aid kits. 
We finished the hike at 4:25 and had someone pick us and bring us back to NOC. We’re in our rooms again for tonight and will slackpack again tomorrow so we can make the 14 miles to Fontana Dam. There begins our 78 mile trek through Smokey Mountain National Park. 
That stretch weighs heavy on my mind. It has the highest climb of the entire AT.  To make it through the park takes 6-7 days if you’re moving quickly and there is only one resupply point possible.  We’ll have to average over 12 miles per day on rough terrain.  There is no camping allowed so you have to make it to the shelters each night. It’s also notorious for rain and known for bears.  It should be fun :)","NOC

13.85 milesSunny skies70*
Today we picked up the trail at Stecoah and slackpacked to Fontana.  We got dropped off at the trail at 7:45 and we’re hiking at 8.  We had tremendously blue skies with clouds hovering in the valleys below us. 
A mile into the hike was a section known as Jacob’s Ladder.  We had a 30% grade for about a 1/2 mile. Very steep but the kids were so busy talking I’m not sure if they noticed!  I certainly did but being early in the day we had fresh legs and only daypacks with water and food so the climb was easier than anticipated. 
We had lunch in a beautiful clearing (clearing is relative on the AT, the trees were just less dense) sitting in a tiny log shelter.  Our youngest son had somehow found fishing string somewhere so he attached it to his trekking pole and set off fishing in the small spring fed stream.  Since there were no fish in the tiny stream he claimed to be salamander fishing. 
Like the day before we only saw one other hiker all day. The trail was much better maintained here than further south and more interesting.  We are hoping tomorrow as we enter the Smokies that the terrain changes to something new. 
We arrived at our destination around 4:15. Actually, we weren’t precisely sure of the destination. You see there is a Fontana Dam, a Fontana Village, Fontana Lodge and Fontana Marina. You have to keep in mind we’ve had almost no cell service or internet for over a week. It’s very difficult to plan the next leg of your trip from just maps and a trail guide. We just knew we were headed to Fontana. 
Turns out we arrived at the Marina and there was a phone to call the lodge. The phone had a note attached saying it was broken, please walk out to the Marina bait shop and have them call the lodge shuttle. 
While we waited an hour for the shuttle to show up we had a wonderful swim time at the boat launch. We’ve missed swimming so much these past few weeks. Swimming is part of our summer routine in Austin. Lake Fontana is gorgeous and the water was warm and clear so we didn’t hesitate jumping in wearing our hiking clothes.  Our youngest rigged up his fishing pole again and tied some fruit snacks to the end of the line, intent on reeling in a fish. A fisherman walking by took pity on his valiant but fruitless efforts and gave him his tub of his worms. He then returned from his truck with a fishing pole to give him. I thanked him then explained that we couldn’t except it as we’d have to carry it another 100 miles. 
Finally the shuttle showed up and drove us the 3 miles up to the lodge. It was a steal for $99 night - two pools and a lazy river plus a good restaurant occupied our remaining 3 hours of daylight. Erin made several trips to the laundromat 1/4 mile down a steep hill. We all wish we could stay longer and relax but we had to hit the trail early the next morning for our toughest day yet. We were finally climbing into the Smokies.","Stecoah Gap

13.4 miles
Today was a big day for us. Probably the biggest in terms of elevation gain and miles hiked with full packs. 
We had a big breakfast at 7am in the Fontana Lodge and then got a ride from “Shua” down to the marina where we’d been picked up the day before. We set off across the parking lot into the woods and up another set of endless ups and downs.  We had some nice lake views for a few minutes and then arrived at a shelter known as the “Fontana Hilton”.  
It earned the nickname because it’s the only shelter along the entire 2100 miles of AT that has hot showers, electrical outlets and a lake view. It doesn’t take much to win the best shelter award. 
From there we hiked on a paved road to the surprisingly interesting Fontana Dam visitor center. The woman at the help desk was possibly the world’s friendliest person. She had file cabinets full of treats and supplies for AT hikers. She tried to give our kids every treat known to man. She tried to give me a travel size shaving cream. Erin used her phone charger. The kids all took some cheese crackers and a pack of famous dams trading cards and we politely declined the rest. 
After filling our water bottles in the bathroom sinks we set off. We hiked a half mile or so across the dam itself, enjoying great views on both sides. This was our only truly flat segment of the AT and the kids were all moving painfully slow for some reason.  I think they were sad to leave the pool and lazy river they barely had time to explore the night before.  (Side note to our Texas readers, the kids had the lazy river to themselves so they played “Schlitterbahn”. They acted like they worked there, stacking all the inner tubes and sending giant towers of them down the empty lazy river.) 
We passed one last picnic area on the paved road.  This is where we stuffed our mouths full of left over hamburgers and chicken fingers we had brought with us, knowing there would be a trash bin we could use. 
After that it was up into the smokies. Miles and miles of up. We hiked quietly for a change. Everyone had a sense of the challenge before us. With fully laden packs weighing us down we climbed from 1,500 ft to 4,583ft. With all the ups and downs it always feels like a 2 step forward, 1 step back hike.  
We also took a short but steep side trail to Shuckstack tower, which felt more like a tower of doom. It is an incredibly rickety and unsafe (as in one misstep and you fall to your death) old fire tower with expansive views. 
About 2 miles into the hike we had to break out the speaker. Normally reserved for the end of the day, we had to DJ most of this day’s hike. “Eye of the Tiger”, “We are the Champions” and “The Final Countdown” rotated with our Weird Al playlist to keep the kids motivated and our minds off the tough climb. We even broke out The Hobbit audiobook when we really needed distraction. It all worked. We hiked an incredibly tough climb with full packs and made it to a gorgeous shelter about 6pm.  
We set up camp, fixed a hot dinner, took cold showers and crawled into sleeping bags. It was a beautiful twilight as we drifted off to a peaceful sleep knowing that most likely our toughest hiking day was behind us.","Fontana

Today has been a good day. A long hard hike but a memorable day. We’re in a shelter tonight with 13 people!  It’s our first experience having a slumber party with strangers. There’s an REI hiking group, an optomologist and a ridge runner (sort of like a back country park ranger).  We’re all squeezed into this 12 person, 2 level shelter like sardines but it’s kind of fun.  Where else do you take your kids to sleep outdoors next to strangers?
This morning we woke up late (7am) at Mollie’s Ridge shelter. There was heavy rain during the night and we woke up in a dense cloud. All of our hanging clothes were soaking wet even though they were covered. The air was just too heavy with moisture for anything to dry. 
After getting on the trail we hiked about an hour and then came around a corner and saw the sight we’d all longed to see - a black bear in the wild. Not just a bear but a mama bear with 3 adorable cubs. She looked at us for about 5 seconds and then went back to grazing. Two of the tiny cubs scampered up a tree and amazed us with their climbing abilities. They looked like large kittens as they made their way 50ft up a tree trunk in no time. 
We all stood still and watched them for about 5 min, then bid them farewell and went on our way, thankful for another unique experience.  We hiked on until late afternoon when we arrived at Derrick Knob shelter. There was already a good sized group there when we arrived. We made introductions and then had the somewhat awkward moment of everyone wondering if we should pitch our tents or ask the group to move all their bedding so we could squeeze in. I voted for tents but the kids and Erin outvoted me. So we opted for askungvto squeeze in and it turned out to be a fun time. 
The whole interaction somehow reminded me of trying to not make eye contact with passengers on a Southwest flight as you’re hoping no one will take the middle row seat next to you. Except we were those last on passengers who took someone’s middle seat.  But then, just when we thought the cabin doors were closed, another, even later passenger arrived and took the final seat. Our shelter was now a full flight.  
One of the most common comments our kids get from people we meet on the hike is “Wow, you kids are so lucky to have parents who take you to hike the AT. You’ll always remember this.”  Kind words and completely true. However I always chuckle inside when I look at my kids, grimy and exhausted after carrying heavy packs for 12 miles and people tell them how great their parents are :). I wonder if they feel that way at that moment? 
Despite the hardships, I think they already realize the benefits they’re reaping. Grit and gratitude are two attributes we hoped to instill in them, it appears to be working.","Mollies Ridge

Today feels momentous.  We reached the highest point on the AT (Clingman’s Dome), we passed the 200 mile mark and we came to town. 
We had a great night in the shelter last night and out of 13 people there were zero snorers.  No mice, no bears and no snoring is the AT shelter trifecta! 
We did our morning routine (heat water, bring down food from bear hangs, brush teeth, pack up bedding, breakfast of oatmeal and carnation instant breakfast packets, put daily supply of snacks in pouch pockets, etc.) and said goodbye to all of our new trail friends as we hit the trail. Today was an easy day with “only” 10 miles of climbing. We also were motivated because we would be picked up at 4:30 and shuttled to a town, Cherokee NC. 
At this point we’re all pretty weary and beat up. Lots of bruises, scrapes, rashes, bug bites, blisters, chaffing and such.  I was recently stung by a hornet AND a bee on the same ankle. It seems their poisons created a toxic mix that caused my ankle to swell to the point that I now officially have a “cankle” and it hurts. The prospect of a bed and hot bath sounds great. 
This morning while at the shelter preparing to leave our oldest son told me with a completely straight face, “Dad, I think today I’m going to wear clean socks AND clean underwear”.  It’s nice to see our kids making good life choices. 
A few days ago our daughter turned around while hiking and said with a smile on her face “Daddy, I stink”.  Ha!  I loved that she could recognize that fact and be totally fine with it and wanted to share it. 
So our hike today was pretty straightforward, lots of climbing, but the last 3 miles were the best yet!  The forest completely changed into a Spruce - Fir forest. There was a cold breeze and the smell…. Our youngest son yelled at one point, “Daddy, it smells like Christmas!”  And oh how it did. If you closed your eyes you could’ve been sitting in front of a crackling fire wearing a sweater with gifts wrapped under the tree. It felt like Christmas in July. 
After an hour or two of refreshing scenery and tears from 3 kids (it was a LOT of climbing) we reached Clingman’s Dome. The highest point of the entire AT.  There were hundreds of tourist walking up a steep, paved sidewalk from the nearby parking lot when we popped out of the woods. 
Everyone stared as we walked by, both because our young kids with heavy packs were passing them like they were standing still and we looked so dirty compared to everyone in their brightly colored and freshly laundered clothing.  We saw one other unwashed hiker with a large pack and made a beeline to set our packs down by her. She felt like our kind of people. 
We took the obligatory family photo at the top of the observation tower and then headed down to find our shuttle driver. We got picked up in the knick of time as a true deluge of rain began to fell moments after we shut the car door. Once again, we narrowly escaped being caught in a downpour. 
We made it to our hotel, showered, put on our semi-clean camp clothes and walked to a Mexican restaurant. It was great. Then we ordered 5 dishes of friend ice cream and sopapillas and ate until we were stuffed. Back to the hotel to do laundry and crawl into sheets on a soft bed. Clean, full, safe and half way through the Smokies. So thankful!","Derrick Knob

Thomson Family,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667021,"Day 23 - 8 Miles on our Zero Day 
Today was supposed to be a zero day for us. In order to break up our Smokies section into two 3 day segments though we had to slackpack on our zero day. We wish we could have had more downtime today, especially being Sunday but this was the only way we could get the schedule to work. 
We headed up at 9am to Clingman’s Dome to resume the trail. It’s a half mile of steep sidewalk to get back to the starting point. The air was thick with cloud, visibility was 100ft and the temps were in the upper 50’s (50* cooler than back home!)
When we got back in the trail it was absolutely soaked from the deluge the evening before. The entire trail was a stream with water flowing down in little waterfalls over the roots and rocks. It was a magical flooded forest gorgeous to look at but impossible to hike without getting wet. The going was painfully slow as we hopped from rock to rock, trying to stay dry.  
We had cell service at the top of the trail so I immediately texted our shuttle driver that we would not make the pickup time 4 hours later, he’d have to give us more time. We hiked for about 5 hours without a break, munching a few snacks as we walked.  
The scenery was wonderful and a continuation of yesterday afternoon with the added beauty of water flowing everywhere.  Our youngest kept finding little pieces of mysterious forest and would say “after we finish hiking can we come back to this spot so I can go over there?”  One of the ironies of this hike is you are often too pressed for time to really stop and enjoy a certain place. We try to slow down for the kids but there is a practical side of getting to your shelter or camping spot in time. 
One of highlights today was our oldest son caught a baby mouse on the trail. He’s become quite adept at grabbing snakes, toads and other critters along the trail. The baby mouse was adorable and very calm. Each kid held it and petted it and of course asked to keep it. 
We returned the mouse to its home and kept pushing onward. We made it to our pickup spot late but have a gracious shuttle driver. We came back to the motel, grabbed lunch, showered and took naps. We had friends from home unexpectedly in the area so we met for dinner. It was so nice to visit with old friends and have playmates for the kids. 
The wife gave Erin a ride to the supermarket to grab a few items. After they left we organized all of our food, filled water bottles and repacked our backpacks. 
Tomorrow we begin our final segment of the trip. We plan to end once we get through the Smokies. That will be 250 miles total and feels like a great ending point for us. We will have completed the Southern section of the AT, climbed the highest peak and hiked just over 10% of the total trail.","Clingman’s Dome

Thomson Family,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667077,"Day 24 -  The Beauty of the Smokies
Today we hiked 10.5 miles, and the prettiest miles so far.  Our shuttle driver, Mike, dropped us off at Newfound Gap at 9am. We got a photo with him and some hugs. He said he felt like he’d become part of our adventure the past week. Certainly your shuttle drivers are an indispensable part of your team and Mike had been instrumental in getting us through the Smokies. 
Once hiking we felt like we’d been transported to a different mountain range, something out west. The air was drier and finally had that fresh mountain air scent. The views were more numerous than ever. We even hiked for a mile along a ridge, sometimes only 5ft across, with steep drops and long vistas on both sides. 
We saw many other people on the trail this morning for a change. The first 4 miles from Newfound Gap, where we started our day, the AT is a popular out and back day hike out to a viewpoint. After that viewpoint, we saw no one else on the trail all day. 
We had lunch in a grove of conifers with a deep, soft bed of pine needles on the ground. We spread our sleeping pads down, sitting on them and leaning against our packs.  The air was cool, the breeze light and fresh, and lunch was sandwiches. We were as comfortable and content as we’ve been anywhere on the trail.  We have only 3 days left until we’re scheduled to reach our endpoint. We take it slower today, drinking it all in. 
For fear of falling asleep we got up and continued hiking.  We rolled into the shelter (only option in the Smokies, no camping allowed) about 4:30 and began our routine. An hour later, Vanessa, from Baton Rouge walked into camp. We enjoyed hearing about her section hiking adventures. Then another hour later our youngest son ran down from the privy and said “Bones” was here. Sure enough our trail friend Bones had showed up again, on his birthday in fact, so we had a nice group of 8 in the shelter. 
Now we’re all fed and bathed and brushed and lying in a row in our sleeping bags reading or journaling by headlamp. It’s 9:14pm and way past our bedtime.","Newfound Gap

12.9 miles 
Cloudy/part sun  58*

Today was a long day for the kids. Our youngest son struggled for several miles. Erin, myself and our oldest son took turns carrying his pack most of the day.  The trail was good most of the way. The first hour we hiked through a dense cloud but later the sun peeked through the thinning clouds. The views were impressive but hazy when they did present themselves but mostly we were in deep conifer forest. 
We saw two more families today, each with two teenage kids. In both instances they were on 3-4 day backpacking trips. It’s always nice seeing other families on the trail.   We reached Cosby Knob shelter about 4:30 and we’re happy to see Vanessa, our shelter-mate from last night, here waiting for us. In fact, she had already swept off the upper platform for us to put our bedding on. Vanessa has grandkids in Austin so we have a connection with her. It felt great to be expected and welcomed to the shelter after a hard day’s hike. 
Shortly after arriving the kids spotted something on the bear hang cables. We went to investigate and lowered the item. It was a ziplock baggie full of candies for the kids. They said, “It’s from Bones!  We saw him using these same baggies”.  Well, they were correct. We later found a note from him to the “So Dang Sweet” family saying he arrived in early afternoon and decided to keep walking on to the next shelter.  We’re sad to miss him but hopefully we can arrange for some trail magic for him further up trail once we get off the trail tomorrow. 
Since this is our final shelter stay I decided to give the family a special treat. Thankfully the water source for this shelter is only 10 yards away and it’s a good flow.  I filled our kettle up and brought water to a boil 4 times, each time pouring it into our portable shower. I mixed in equal parts cold spring water and we all had a perfect warm shower for our final night.  Erin and the kids loved it, how nice to have a special treat. 
So here we are on our final night on the trail.  It’s hard to believe we made it this far. We’ve experienced so much during our time.  Struggles, triumphs, pain, suffering, joy, excitement, anxiety, friendships, accomplishment and so many other words could describe our 4 weeks on the Appalachian Trail.  We still have 10 more miles tomorrow so I’ll save the reflection for after we’ve officially finished this journey.","Peck’s Corner Shelter

Thomson Family,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667122,"Day 26 - The Finish Line
The final 10 miles has finally arrived. I can’t believe we made it this far. Last night in the shelter with Vanessa we were all in bed early, about 8:15. The kids still had a hard time settling down for bed so we asked Vanessa if she minded if they listened to The Hobbit audiobook. She was so sweet and said that sounded great. So in the gathering darkness of the forest we listened to tales of Bilbo and the dwarves also traveling through a dark forest. 
During the night a heavy rain fell. Between hearing the mice running over the roof and the raindrops loudly plunking onto the metal roof, we did not get much sleep.  I was out of my sleeping bag around 5:40am to get water boiling and retrieve the bear hangs. Erin got up soon after and we started waking the kids. Everyone was excited to get an early start and finish the Trail.   Vanessa would also be finishing at Standing Bear so we all had the same goal today. 
We got on the very wet trail a few minutes after 7am.  We felt certain the rain would be returning soon and end our rain-free hiking streak so we were moving quickly.  About 3 miles into the hike there is a 0.6 mile side trail to a viewpoint. We decided we did not need to add an extra 1.2 miles to our youngest son’s hiking plan but the oldest son and I would go for a look and then catch the others. Vanessa also came with us. She’s quite adventurous and in incredible shape and she didn't want to miss a good view. 
The three of us hightailed it for 15 minutes of hiking and then some rock scrambling up to an old stone lookout tower. The views were the best we’d seen on the entire AT so far. We were on the very edge of the Smokies and the view looked out over the surrounding lowlands and valleys for mile after mile. 
Back on the main trail we caught Erin and the kids (our youngest had been crying over missing the view) and we made it to the last shelter in the Smokies. We all ate a quick lunch and were interested to see this shelter as it is the last shelter that still has a chain link fence at the entrance. At night you actually close yourself and all your food inside to keep safe from bears. A reverse zoo of sorts.  It didn’t feel very welcoming and I was glad we hadn’t stayed there. It was bitter sweet as I wrote our final entry in a trail register, signaling the completion of the So Dang Sweet family adventure on the AT this year. 
After our quick lunch we were back on the trail continuing a rapid descent. The temperature was rising rapidly as we descended. The air was now thick and muggy and the forest undergrowth increasing. Our old nemesis, poison ivy, was everywhere again and the conifer’s had been replaced with Oaks, Hickory, Beech and Poplar trees. 
Now we could hear the road noise from I-40 down below.  A harsh sound, reminding us of how peacefully quiet the forest had been the past few days.  We soon made it to a road, crossed a bridge, walked along a stretch of interstate highway on-ramp with trucks passing terrifyingly close and then walked under the I-40 underpass. We only had 1 mile to go. On we trudged with mixed excitement for the end and longing for continuation. It felt as if we were caught up in a current, whether we were ready for the end or not, we were rapidly approaching it and there was no stopping our course. We came out of the woods a final time onto a dirt road. A sign said “Standing Bear - 0.2 miles”.  A UPS driver was walking up the road on a hike. He said he rarely sees hikers this time of year. He drives the nearby section of highway daily in his UPS 18-wheeler and stops for a 3 mile hike each day. He would’ve chatted with us all day but we had a hike to finish. We said goodbye and started up the hill as 2 cars were ambling up the dirt road. We were telling the kids to move to the side when two of them shouted “It’s our minivan!!” And sure enough it was. 
Sherpa Al and Sherpa Josh were delivering our van at just the right moment. We were so excited to see them again, the guys who first drove our van away almost a month ago when we were scared and excited and walking into the unknown with complete strangers driving off in our van. It seemed so fitting that they would witness the beginning and end of our journey. 
We let them pass and we walked our last 0.1 miles up the dirt road, all holding hands, crossing the finish line… together. 
4 weeks after we started and here we were at the finish line. 250 miles of trials and triumphs. Our calves were stronger, our stomachs hungrier. Our appreciation for simple things had grown and our kids were capable of more than we imagined. So much to process, so much to think about. That could all wait until tomorrow though. For now, hot showers and a dinner were as far into the future as we cared to look.","Cosby Knob Shelter

Thomson Family,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667123,"Day 27 - Bringing Home some Trail Magic
Today is our final zero day. One journey is ending but another is just beginning. We’re sitting in our van in the town of Hot Springs, NC waiting out a rainstorm and hoping to go white water rafting. 
The younger kids are running around a field getting soaking wet.  Ironic that we made it 250 miles without hiking in the rain but it’s now catching up with us. 
Erin and I have been reflecting a lot and discussing with the kids what we’ve learned on this trip. Our biggest fear is that the opportunity be wasted and we let important lessons slip by unlearned. what if our kids return home and fight, argue or complain just the same? We don’t expect a simple walk through the woods to work miracles but hopefully it did something, right?
We’ve talked with the kids about gratefulness and working hard (gratitude and grit) and those terms have a lot more meaning to us now. But what else can we take away from our long walk?
We may have seen a hint at the answer today. If I had to name the most unexpected aspect of this trip for us (the “So Dang Sweet” family) it’s been relationship. Neither Erin nor I had any idea we would be forming relationships along the way. We thought of this as a mostly insular family experience. We thought we’d grow individually and as a family unit but that’s it. 
We have been truly moved by the friendships forged along the way. Our oldest son said it well yesterday when he shared what he’s learned on the trip. He said “I learned you become a lot better friends with people when you go through hard things together”.  He’s absolutely correct. Shared suffering builds strong bonds. 
We have felt on this trip that we have been the beneficiaries of so much love and kindness from others. It has felt very unbalanced, as if we’re not giving enough but always receiving. Maybe we can’t always see the ways we’ve helped, encouraged or inspired others but it sure feels like we could do more. 
One person our paths have converged with is “Bones”. He graduated college the same year as Erin and I, summer of 2001. He came to hike the trail that year and made it half way. 22 years and some hard times and broken dreams later, he’s back to finish. The Lord saw fit to bring our paths together and we’ve leapfrogged each other many times in the last couple of weeks.  Yesterday Bones was at the hostel when we arrived, crossing our own finish line. We got to hang out with him a bit more and then he pushed off in the late afternoon for the trail again. Before he left we gathered all of our unused supply boxes out of the car and let Bones sort through it and we built a resupply box for him that we promised to deliver to the next town, a three days hike away. 
That’s where we are now. We just dropped it off at the hostel he’ll come to. We all wrote him a note and put it in the box. After he hiked away last night Erin found a scrap of paper on our bed with a pencil drawing on it. A drawing of our family.  Bones is an artist. Somewhere he had drawn a scene of our family that captured each one of us perfectly. It will be a cherished momento from our journey.  He had left this for us even before we resupplied him with food.  
Even when we thought we were doing good for him, we were already indebted to him for a gift we hadn’t found yet. 
As we left the package at the hostel a short while ago, there I was standing in the rain with our middle son as we closed the tape on the box. It felt so exciting and so good to think of blessing someone else. All this time on the trail, hiking our hike and wondering what lessons we’ve learned simply brought us back to one of the greatest and simplest truths we’ve known but often have forgotten. Thinking of and doing for others ALWAYS brings you more joy than thinking of yourself. 
As we prepare to head home we are different than when we began. Im reminded of our day 1 start. As we prepared to walk out of the lodge doors I stopped the kids and warned them.  I said once they passed through those doors and stepped onto the trail, they would never be the same people again.  
Those words were true, I just couldn’t have guessed what the changes would look like. Now we know. Having suffered, we are more understanding of other’s suffering; having gone without, more grateful for what we have; having wandered so far, more willing to help others find their way and having been so often loved and shown kindness, more eager than ever to love others. 
For the Thomson family, the journey can be summed up in three words -SO DANG SWEET!
Signing off for the last time… for now.","Standing Bear Farm
