Pheriel ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659678,"I just looked back to see my last AT Trail Journals entry from back in 2021. At that point I'd completed 1606 miles of the AT between 2018 and 2019. For 2020 Covid got in the way of finishing the final 537 miles so my plans shifted to restarting in Vermont in July 2021. But...in late 2020 an injury I'd been nursing since 2018 turned into a Jones Fracture on my left foot. I'm not as bulletproof as I used to be and recovery for an almost 66 year old also ain't what it used to be so my 2021 plans got delayed again. In late 2021 I was able to begin a hike of the Pinhoti Trail which I finally finished in November 2022. So that's a quick snapshot of where I am today. So now my plan is to restart in Manchester, VT July 8, 2023. More to come....",,View Entry,"Dec 31, Sat",0
Pheriel ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659681,"There's discussion in some circles that the Pinhoti Trail(PT) should be the southern extension of the AT. The original plan for the AT was to have the southern terminus in the ""mountains"" of Alabama but it never materialized. With the current push for ""Bama to Baxter"" it's set up to possibly happen but there's a long way and a bunch of politics to go before it happens...if it ever does. Regardless, now that I've completed the PT I've got that 350 miles behind me and will have it checked off if the AT does extend to 2,615 miles or so into Alabama. One other thing to check off prior to finishing the AT will be the 72 mile section of the Benton MacKaye Trail that connects the PT to the AT near Springer Mtn. That'll be my final shakedown hike in early April 2023. In the meantime it's ellipticals and local hikes near our western NC home because July will be here before I know it.",,View Entry,"Dec 31, Sat",0
Pheriel ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659682,Most of 2022 is in the rear view mirror with just a few hours to go until a million or so crazies watch that crystal ball drop and it's all gone. Here's hoping you have a happy and blessed 2023 and that you never stop chasing your dreams! God bless.,,View Entry,"Dec 31, Sat",0
Pheriel ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666338,"One week from today I'm back on the AT at Manchester, VT heading north. Since 2019 it's been a long time coming getting back to the AT with Covid and several personal medical challenges along the way. Somewhere in between all of that there's been urban hiking, treadmills and hiking local trails plus I was able to complete the Pinhoti Trail. But none of those give you the experience and feeling you get from being on the AT. So now it's here and I'm excited to start chasing those 2""x6"" white blazes on my final long section. Hope to see some of you that I've been watching and reading about along the way. See y'all soon!",,View Entry,"Jul 02, Sun",0
Pheriel ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666626,"After an almost 4 year hiatus it was good to be back on the AT even if it was for just 5 miles. The best shuttle driver on the AT(my wife) dropped me off at Mad Tom Notch for the short hike SOBO up and over Bromley Mtn. With all the rain the area has received the Green Mountains were definitely living up to their name. That combined with a cloudy, cool and damp morning the setting was just about perfect for an uphill climb. The forest in this area is mostly hardwoods but occasionally the nostalgic smell passing by a red spruce brought Christmas trees to mind. It was all a beautiful thing! At the top of Bromley Mtn the clouds kept me from getting any views but I didn't miss the opportunity to get a couple selfies sitting in one of the idle ski lift chairs. The 3 mile trek down to Hwy 11 was uneventful but I did pass by 10-12 AT thru hikers along the way. Must have landed in the middle of one of the bubbles. This part of the AT overlaps with the Long Trail so I also met several LT thru hikers. It was a great start on my journey north with many more days to follow but not tomorrow. I have a live-in shuttle driver, a dry hotel room in a town with plenty of restaurants and there's a 90% chance of rain with thunderstorms forecasted. Momma didn't raise any fools so unless the weather forecasters got it wrong(is it possible?) I'll be getting my real start on Tuesday morning.","Mad Tom Notch Gap

Pheriel ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666693,"The weather forecasters absolutely nailed it! Â The rain started in the wee hours of Sunday morning then intensified for most of the day. When the rain event finally worked its way through the area 4-7"" of rain had been dumped. With steep watersheds in the Green Mountains the result was devastating for many of the smaller mountain communities. Catastrophic flooding, significant property damage, roads closed all around the the area and unfortunately loss of life. You know it's bad when the Weather Channel is broadcasting live from the area! Our hotel in Manchester quickly started to fill with grateful thru hikers coming off trail along with Green Mountain House Hostel being filled to capacity. Thru hikers are stubbornly focused on the 4,000' ultimate goal at trails end but know when it's time to tuck and cover. Well, most of the time. There are some that will head back to the AT Tuesday but others (like me) are going to make it another zero day to let things calm down a bit. Hearing and reading reports from the trail of normally babbling brooks that turned into angry, raging torrents of water. Another day with my wife is always a good thing. Hope I get some brownie points for that.....Be safe.

Pheriel ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667639,"Had a great start to my reboot of the northern section of the AT. With the restart I did 17 miles over Day 1 and Day 3 while being slack packed by my wife. Those days included Bromley Mtn, Styles Peak and Bakers Peak. Day 2 was the monsoon that hit the northeast the second week of July so I took a zero l, stayed dry and watched the heavens open up. On day 4 my trail angel and I said our goodbyes as she dropped me at the trailhead and I headed north with full pack. Other than the saturated trail that often resembled a flowing creek it was an awesome section of trail going by the Rock Garden, White Rocks and the beautiful Little Rock Pond. My day ended at Greenwall Shelter. After a restful night alone in the shelter(not even mice) I had breakfast, packed up and started the descent towards Bully Brook. About 5 minutes out I talked with a local trail maintainer about conditions, thanked him for his trail service and continued down the hill. Then my foot stepped on a wet, slippery rock and I fell full force on my left knee. When I tried to get up there was no integrity in my left leg and I knew my 2023 attempt to finish the AT was done. The short version is the trail maintainer got me to Rutland, my wife(who was halfway back to North Carolina) turned around to gather her injured and humbled husband then we drove home. The orthopedic said no breaks, cracks or chips just tissue issues plus a 67 year old knee. The swelling and bruising are gone and yesterday was the first day I didn't ice it since being home. Already planning next years restart of the AT. Before then I'm planning to complete the 70 mile connection of the Benton McKaye between the Pinhoti and AT in late fall plus the 200 mile Alabama road walk in the winter. So I'll see y'all next year!!
