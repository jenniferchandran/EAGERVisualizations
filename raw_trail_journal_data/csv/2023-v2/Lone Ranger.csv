Lone Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662102,"I have finally complied with my wife's request to clean up the guest bedroom. My camping gear....enough to fill 3 good sized backpacks...has been strewn about for the last two months, and has now been pared down to fitting in just one backpack, weighing in at a tad under the self-imposed cutoff point of 35 pounds with multiple days of food and 2 liters of water. The remainder of my gear has been stuffed back into my supply closet, to be dealt with at some future date.
This is all in preparation for the next installment of my (maybe) end-to-end hike of the AT. Tomorrow afternoon I'll drive from my home in Rochester, NY, to some point in mid-Virginia. After an overnight stay in the cheapest hotel I stumble upon, I'll continue south to Stanimal's Hostel in Glasgow, Va., where I'll leave my car and shuttle further south to Bland, Virginia. From there, starting at AT mile 591, I'll begin this NOBO section hike of 188 miles back to Glasgow. With that, I'll be at the 50% completion point of the AT, leaving the southernmost 600 miles and the northernmost 500 miles remaining for future consideration.",,View Entry,"Apr 14, Fri",0
Lone Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662103,"And so the adventure begins. The weather is cooperating for today's 600-650 mile drive. Chores around the house are pretty much caught up. The plan is for an early dinner at about 2:00 PM with Mrs. Ranger, followed by a quick stop at our local Wegmans to pick up a sub, which will be tomorrow's lunch and dinner on the trail. Although today's weather is great, the forecast for my first day hiking looks pretty dismal, with showers and thunderstorms in the offing.One big 'complication' of this section hike is, in fact the weather. Looking forward, there's about a 50 degree span from the forecast highs in the low 80's to  lows of near freezing. Hence my overweight pack to accommodate extra clothing. Bummer. But that's what you get at this time of year.One other observation is that the NOBO thru-hiker 'bubble' will just be approaching my start location. It will be interesting to see if I meet up with any of the other journalists I've been following on TrailJournals. My hope is that I'm still far enough north to avoid the crowds at the shelter areas. I'm planning on tenting throughout anyway, so stealth camps may come into play as needed.Until tomorrow, Happy Trails!   Lone Ranger",,View Entry,"Apr 15, Sat",0
Lone Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662263,"Day-1:  30,800 steps.  I left the motel in Woodstock at 6:30, then after breakfast, arrived at Stanimal’s 328 Hiker Hostel, hoping for an early start. Turns out that my driver, “Spotter” ran out of gas somewhere in the mountains and I had to wait for someone to go rescue him. We still managed to leave at 9:30 and I arrived at the trailhead at 11:30 AM, where I found my first ever Trail Magic! They had drinks, snacks, and were cooking food on the grill for hikers. Of course, since I hadn’t taken my first step, yet, I had to pass.
The weather forecast was for showers and thunderstorms all day. At 2:30, it started to rain, and I deployed Tonto to protect me from the elements. He did that for 20 minutes, then the rain stopped, and the sun came out. No more rain until 7 PM, when the heavens finally opened up and it poured for a couple of hours.
I’m actually writing this first on-trail journal entry on the 17th. I’ve had no cell service from 4 PM on the 16th until 7 PM on the 17th, and even then it’s so weak I can’t upload pictures. I’ll catch up with those later. Otherwise, everything’s going fine. No blisters, broken bones, or any other ailments of note.
I should also mention that the trail here has been very agreeable. Moderate grades, and generally very good maintenance, although there were quite a few trees across the trail in one small area. Nothing that presented any difficulty, however.

Lone Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662268,"Day-2:  49,800 steps.  I woke at 6:30 this morning with temperatures in the mid 40s. Strong winds overnight dried out the tent and I was packed and on the trail by 7:30.
There are quite a few NOBO thru-hikers here. The shelters are apparently full every night, and also surrounded by tents. I was hoping that I was starting this hike early enough to stay ahead of the bubble, but not so much! But since we’re all headed in the same direction, I really don’t encounter too many of them during the day.
The trail today was a real joy! With the exception of a couple of hills, there was very little elevation change, and exceptional trail maintenance. The trees are just starting to leaf out and don’t provide much shade, but the rhododendrons are everywhere and more than make up for the thin tree canopy.
My only issue again today was no cell service with AT&T until I finally made camp on top of a ridge and got one bar on my phone. Pictures will have to wait.
Special shout- out to “City Dog” and “New Knee”, two hikers I’ve been leapfrogging all day.
Since I added extra miles today seeking cell service, tomorrow’s mileage should be a little less. Not that it matters, since I’m feeling fine.

Lone Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662320,"Day-3:  35,400 steps.  Today was more like the Appalachian Trail I’ve been accustomed to, with some taller hills and lots of rocks. With today’s shorter mileage, I left camp at about 8:15 and within a few minutes ran into “New Knee” once again. We walked together for about 2 1/2 miles, swapping life stories about how we both arrived at this particular time and place. He was stopping early at Woods Hole Hostel to enjoy a NERO. He started a thru- hike last year, but had to take a break to get his knee replaced after 400 miles.I hope he makes it all the way this year.
I finally did get some trail magic today. After hiking about 5 miles, I stopped at Doc’s Knob shelter and made a late breakfast. Chatted with another NOBO hiker there, then I packed up and was about to leave when a young man and woman arrived lugging four 12-packs of soda. I wasn’t really thirsty, but I couldn’t let the effort go un-appreciated, so I had a can of Coke. His name was “unicorn“, and he did an end-to-end last year. For many people, spending five or six months on the AT makes it a permanent part of their life, and they find themselves drawn back to it, in many cases providing trail magic for the next batch of hikers and reliving their own experiences virtually.Tonight I’m staying at the very classy Holiday Lodge motel in Pearisburg. Tomorrow, a shuttle driver from Angel’s Rest Hostel will pick me up at 7:30 AM and drop me off 19 miles north on the trail. From there, I will slack-pack south back to Pearisburg and stay at their hostel for the night. The next morning, they will shuttle me back to that same spot, now with a pack loaded down with 7 days of food, and I’ll continue on my journey north.Happy Trails!  Lone Ranger","Stealth Camp @ Mile 622

Lone Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662385,"Day-4:  49,680 steps.  The shuttle to Big Stoney Creek Rd trailhead got us on trail at 7:45. Waiting in the parking lot was a woman providing trail support for her son who was doing an end-to-end. She was going all the way, and said she was having a blast mingling with the hikers. She insisted that we sign the side of her van!
As for my SOBO slack hike, it was great. The initial 3 miles got me to my peak altitude on Peter’s Mountain,& it was all down hill from there, save a few low hills in between. The trail was crowded with NOBO hikers….I counted 42 that I passed. I’d say about 60% thru hikers and 40% section hikers like me. It was a warm day (low 80’s) so I really appreciated the 6# day-pack. What luxury!
At the finish walking into Pearisburg I stopped at Hardee’s for a burger & shake, then checked into my private room at Angels Rest, took a shower, back up to the Mexican restaurant for wings & a beer and back down to Angels Rest to do laundry, which is what’s going on as I write this.
The people there are great. In addition to being ultra-friendly, they’re also ultra-honest. They informed me that they overcharged me for a shuttle, but they found the mistake and already credited it back. I never would have known.
As for the hikers I’ve met today, I could list about a dozen names that I still remember, each with their own unique story. Too much to write about, but all part of the experience.
Tomorrow I get shuttled back up to Big Stoney Creek Rd. to continue north with my way-too-heavy backpack, loaded with 7 days of supplies. I suspect it will be a shorter day.

Lone Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662468,"Day-5:  49850 steps.   Mountain Tom, our shuttle driver from Angel’s Rest Hostel, dropped me off again at VA-635, where I resumed my northbound journey. I shortly met up with Fern, who I had met yesterday and spoke with briefly. We walked together for a couple of miles. She apparently lives in the Roanoke area and did an end to end last year, but she’s doing a short section hike to check out some of the features that she missed due to the weather. A little later, Zolo passed me heading southbound. She’s from South Africa and section hiking her way across the AT.
The highlight of the day was when I crossed a parking area and found trail magic from Mmum’s Montessori school. It was a cooler filled with fruit and drinks. After a short snack, I continued on and in about a mile I heard some high-pitched voices calling. “A hiker!  A Hiker!”. It was a class from the Montessori school out for a day hike. One of the teachers said they do this two weeks per year: one week in spring, and one week in fall. They don’t camp, but they apparently do full weeks of day hikes. I guess they were probably fourth graders. They were crazy excited and surrounded me. “How heavy is your pack? Where did you come from? Where are you going? What’s in your pack? How heavy is your pack? Did you see any bears? How heavy is your pack?. You  get the idea.  It was lots of fun. And they were having a ball, with no phones and no music just a couple of trekking poles. Yesterday included a couple of pretty nasty climbs, and I admit I was pretty tired at the end of the day. Also, it was another day in the mid 80s! I set up tent in the Laurel Springs shelter area. The shelter and tent sites are literally carved out of a rhododendron jungle. There were only three of us there, one in the shelter, one in a hammock and myself in my tent. I slept well!Happy Trails!  Lone Ranger","VA-635

Lone Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662473,"Day-6:  38,650 steps.  Today was warm, even from the start, and eventually got up to the mid 80s again. Not my kind of weather.
Early on, the trail wound its way through some beautiful pasture land. But as is always the case, it found another mountain. The big attraction here was the open ledges at the top, which seemed to go on and on forever. They did afford some really great views, but were slow going and were obviously fully exposed to the sun. That wouldn’t have been a problem except I was very short on water and had to nurse one and a half liters for over four hours. It was a relief to finally reach Niday shelter and camel up. I didn’t stay there, but moved on another 2 1/2 miles to a large camping area near a creek. Made camp early at 4:30 and to my surprise, found that I had cell service, unlike yesterday. So today I’m sending out yesterday‘s and today’s journals!
Big change in the weather expected tomorrow. Showers all day and high temperatures in the 60s. The rain will stop tomorrow evening but the temperatures will remain cool for the duration of my trip. I am all good with that. Hopefully no thunderstorms so Tonto can do his job and I can continue my treck uninterrupted. Today, I passed the halfway point. Five full days of hiking to go.

Lone Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662531,"Day-7:  48,750 steps.   The forecast was for showers and thunderstorms pretty much all day today. I hit the trail early at 6:45 AM to try to beat some of the rain, but an hour in the showers began. I unfurled Tonto, where he remained for most of the day. As luck would have it, the strongest rain, with lightning, thunder, and high winds, hit while I was crossing an exposed ridge. Nothing gets you moving like being cold and wet! But once out of the wind, he did his usual great job of keeping me reasonably dry.
I stopped at the Audie Murphy monument. He was the most highly decorated service man of World War II. The surrounding stone wall is embedded with hundreds of metals, patches, dog tags, flags, etc. from all branches of the service. Murphy died when his plane crashed here in 1971.
My second photo op was Dragon’s Tooth.. Huge granite mountain-top monoliths with great views of the surrounding valley. This is a popular day hike, and even with the inclement weather, there were quite a few people visiting. Getting up to, and down from Dragon’s tooth was a challenge. Some of the rockiest trail I’ve experienced. Actually, a lot of fun if the rocks weren’t wet and if you weren’t trying to get a few extra hiking miles in.
Today I’m camped on top of the mountain. No great views, but pretty strong winds. It will be chilly breaking camp in the morning.
Lastly, I’ve been uploading additional pictures every day. Be sure to check them out.

Lone Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662611,"Day-8:  57,230 steps.   It was a beautiful day for a long, eventful hike. Temperatures stayed in the mid 50s and mostly sunny. Got off to my usual 7:30’ish AM start, destination: 6+ miles to McAfee Knob.
McAfee Knob is the ultimate Kodak moment on the Appalachian trail, the most photographed landmark, save the “Finish” sign on Mount Katahdin for successful end-to-enders. And it did not disappoint! It was a little crowded, as it’s a very popular day hike, and therefore a little tricky getting the iconic photo, but I think I did pretty good.
I savored the moment with a late lunch, enjoying the view, then headed out to destination number two: Tinker Cliffs, another 5+ miles. The cliffs are a long series of stone outcroppings with fantastic views. Couples and families claimed their own rocks and sat or lied down, soaking in the sun.
At that point, I made the decision to continue all the way into Daleville, another 9+ miles. That’s 4 or 5 miles further than I originally planned for today, and the longest of this section hike. But I really felt it was time for a good meal, a shower and clean laundry. I got into town at 7 PM and checked into the Super-8 (nice rooms and great hiker rates…highly recommended), just a few hundred feet up the street. After completing chores I had dinner at the Mexican restaurant next door. Good food!
Tomorrow I’m thinking of hiking up to the Cracker Barrel for a big breakfast and then maybe a late check out. With today’s high mileage, I am a little ahead of schedule, so I have some options. We’ll see how the feet feel in the morning.

Lone Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662649,"Day-9:  36,920 steps.   Yesterday was a long, tough day,but it did get me ahead of schedule so that I’ll be able to pair down my mileage for the remainder of the trip. Today was an easy 14 in many ways. Cool with sunny skies and an exceptionally pleasant treadway all day allowed me to slow down the pace and enjoy the scenery. It also gave me time to make camp early at the top of a mountain, near the Blue Ridge Highway. The trail will parallel that for a good portion of tomorrow.
The extra time today also gave me multiple opportunities to bulk up on my caloric intake. I can’t say that I’ve gained any weight today, but I’m pretty sure I didn’t lose any. On that point, I know I’m down a few lb’s since the beginning of the trip. Not much to do about it as I rarely have much of an appetite the first few days.
Temperatures are expected to drop into the mid 30’s tonight, and perhaps even below freezing, but the forecast also is for calm winds. I plan on staying hunkered down until the sun finds its way to my tent tomorrow morning.
Thanks for reading my journal!

Lone Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662877,"Day-10:  44,810 steps.    The temperature did indeed drop into the 30's last night, but calm winds and a warm sleeping bag made for a comfortable night.
My stove last night showed early signs of sputtering out, and since I'm not a fan of cold-soaking my dehydrated dinners, I decided a change of plans was in order. It was my intent to walk 14 today and 14 tomorrow, leaving about 5 miles on the morning of the 27th to finish the hike, shuttle to the hotel and drive home (8 hours +) during daylight hours. Instead, I decided to up the mileage and exit tomorrow afternoon, hopefully early enough to still drive home into the night, but with the option of stopping at a motel.
Hiking conditions were again pretty good.....trail maintenance has been excellent throughout the trip and no imposing mountains to deal with....so I ended up doing about 18 miles and found a perfect camp site on a stream just south of the Bryant Ridge shelter. It wasn't until the next day that I found out how lucky I was, as there are virtually no tent sites near the shelter, my actual destination. For that reason, Bryant Ridge is a huge structure, able to accommodate 20 hikers on 2 levels. In fact, it's the largest shelter on the entire AT. It's an imposing sight, tucked into the heavily wooded sloping terrain with 'my' stream at it's base.
There were several Blue Ridge Highway crossings today, all at scenic viewpoints for the motorists. One had the ""vintage"" AT sign shown here. The mileage is just a bit off....2023's official trail length is 2198.4 miles. Even more interesting is that picture of hikers with their gigantic packs. Equipment has certainly improved a lot since then! I wish that sign was dated.
I hope to get an early start tomorrow for the final 15 miles to my exit at Petites Gap road. It's been a good trip so far, but now I'm looking forward to the trip home back to Mrs. Ranger.

Lone Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662878,"Day-11:  38,100 steps.   It was definitely chilly in the deep valley next to the cold stream when I broke camp for the last time this trip. I was up before 6:00 AM, but numb fingers slowed me down and the best I could do was a 6:45 start, not as early as I hoped. It was a challenging 15 miles I was looking at, with a 3000' climb to crest Apple Orchard Mountain, but with an additional cumulative 1500' of elevation gain thrown in along the way. I didn't know what trail conditions or cell signal to expect, so I set up a conservative default pick-up time of 5:00 PM with my Stanimal shuttle the night before. When I finally reached the top of Apple Orchard Mountain, I was running ahead of plan and was able to move my pick-up to 3:00 PM.
The views today were among the best of the trip, and even the wildflowers cooperated with a terrific farewell showing. The reality of the experience far exceeds anything that can be captured in a photo.
A few other final-day memories:  trail magic in the form of drinks and fruit in 2 locations; a 6-person maintenance crew with the Natural Bridge Hiking Club, including one former Seneca Falls native; treading tenderly but quickly under the Guillotine; another trail maintainer (a woman, perhaps in her mid-70's) who likes nothing better than to build stone steps and crush rock with a sledge hammer; and finally, leapfrogging a number of NOBO thru-hikers who I've come to know, at least on a casual basis.
My shuttle driver, Spotter, got me to the hostel and my car at 3:45, and after a quick shower, I was on the road at 4:00 PM. I ended up driving straight through, 8-1/2 hours of driving with a couple of pit stops,. and arrived home at quarter after midnight. It was a very long day!
With the completion of this LASH (long-ass section hike), I've now hiked approximately 50% (1,100 miles) of the iconic Appalachian Trail, from Bland, Virginia to mid-Vermont. That leaves approximately 600 miles from Springer north and 500 miles from Katahdin south. Unfortunately, the further from home, the tougher the logistics with these section hikes. Whether I ever have the opportunity to compete an end-to-end, it's still been an unforgettable experience.
Thanks again for tolerating my feeble efforts at documenting my journey.
