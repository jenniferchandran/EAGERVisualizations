Daybreak ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661493,Daybreak got his day started at 0300 after cowboy camping last night.  It ended up being cold and windy so it was an early start.  Todays goal will be to get to Mountains Crossing for resupply.  After 3 days on the trail the knees are holding up good (2 knee surgeries after attempting the Continental Divide Trail 2020) Sore and tired - Mike can tell he isn't in hiking shape and doesn't have his trail legs just yet.  Goose (German Shorthair) is doing well.,"Woodys Gap

Mike hiked 11.8 miles today and is staying the night near Bull Gap.   

He said it was a tough climb today and very cold start. He made it to Mountains Crossing, did some restocking and charged his phone. He continued on another 1.1 miles before stopping for the day. Between minimal sleep last night and him starting to chaff pretty bad. 

He will try to post pics when he can but between service and cell battery, it may be tomorrow.

Daybreak ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661612,"Day 5 and 6Its been a couple really good, somewhat tough days.  Daybreak Mike and Goose are both felling pretty good.  The biggest struggle so far is feeling like eating. Mike can handle a couple bites here and there but not taking in much just yet.  On day 5 while Mike was setting up the tent, Goose decided he wanted to play -- he grabbed the sunglasses and was playing keep away.  Mike left the tent, mid set up and got the glasses back from the dog --- while he was doing this the top of the tent blew away.  It has rained or drizzled all day and continued thru the evening.  That night, the air mattress sprung a leak as well.  At Unicoi Gap day day - ran into trail angel Jamie.  He made a great breakfast of eggs, sausage and toast. Again, without much of an appetite, Mike had a few bites and then Goose got the left overs.  Jamie was super!   Waited around for the free shuttle from Unicoi to Hiawassee, GA at noon -- When Mike got to town he decided to stay at the hotel, get a shower, do laundry and resupply -- including a new tent and air mattress!  The shuttle back out to the trail will head out about 11am tomorrow - so a later start for Daybreak! Thank you all for following","Bull Gap

Daybreak ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661653,"Yesterday was a tough day!   After Mike caught the shuttle back to the trail, he and Goose were climbing the Mountain --- the rocks were slick and Goose was pulling - Mike fell!   He wasnt injured too bad, a little bruised and sore - but Goose got loose from his leash.  Mike didnt have time to turn on the GPS on his collar before he was spooked and he took off about 12:30.   Mike doubled back and he and several others searched for Goose for hours.  Mike thought it best to cowboy camp right where Goose took off from, hoping maybe he'd head back there.  After an emotional , exhausting day, Mike decided to sleep about 10PM ---At 10:15 PM Mike was woke by the best kisses ever!   Goose returned and woke Mike up with lots of loves.  Goose was extremely hungry, as he hadnt eaten all day - but otherwise was in good shape and very excited to be reunited with Mike.  Today is a new day and they are back together - so they will continue their journey north.
