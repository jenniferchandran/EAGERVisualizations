Bilbo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659946,"After getting off the trail in Damascus last May during Trail Days, I've decided to give the AT one more shot this year.  I'm a bit of a purist, so starting back at the beginning again with a launch date scheduled for March 12.  Hopefully not giving myself any easy outs this time....sometimes the temptation is just to great.  Pretty much going with the same gear with the only exception being I'm not intending to take my hydration system this time.  It's nice and convenient while hiking, but I found it left to much uncertainty...you never really know what's left in that hydration bladder until it goes empty or you unpack your pack to see it, so this year I'm taking an extra 2 liter CNOC bladder and 2 Smart water bottles.  I'll probably keep 1 bladder filled during the hike or just the 2 water bottles depending on how many resources and then use the second bladder in camp for dinner, overnight and breakfast.  I think overall that will be quicker and easier to manage.  I believe I actually dehydrated myself at times cause of the uncertainly with the supply in my hydration system...I kinda conserved water, not knowing how much I had left in there.  Still debating on whether to take the umbrella.  I rarely used it last year...but when I did it was wonderful.  I'll probably lean towards taking it...can always ship it home if it just seems like dead wt.  That's it on my thoughts for now....I'll add more as I think on it.  :)",,View Entry,"Jan 24, Tue",0

Jumped out, put my boots on and hiked the 1 mile up to Springer Mtn with one stop at the Springer Mtn Shelter privy. Signed the log book, took some video and hiked back down. Took about 1 hrs 10 mins for the 2 mile round trip about 400 ft up and down. Met and chatted with Famous Trail Angel, Miss Janet. Miss Janet follows the hiking bubble every year for the past 30+ years, providing shuttles, advice, and trail magic to the thru hiking community. Honored to have been able to meet and chat with the 'Famous' Miss Janet. Will be chauffeured back to Springer Mtn Trailhead to start in earnest.","

Not much sleep at all the night before.  Thunderstorm went through around 4am and day was greeted by a very cold fog, rain off and on and wind...Great Day to begin a hike.  Breakfast at Amicalola Falls Lodge is a pretty pathetic actually...have had better continental breakfasts at Holiday Inn.  Food did not sit well with me all day.  Rode with Mike back up to Springer and quickly got going...to cold, windy and rainy to linger.  Literally and mentally walked through a haze all day. Stopped at Stover Creek Shelter to use the privy and have a snack...only the latter was actually successful. Trudged on to Long Creek Falls where suddenly the privy was needed, but alas, no privy to be had...had to quickly find a place to dig a cat hole...Thank God the weather was bad, so noone was out to visit the Falls!  Pretty much trudged through the rest of the day to Hawk Mtn.  Set up my tent in a light rain and went to get water where I discovered that my filter would not pass any water...I wish my intestines would have performed like that earlier!  Anyway, strike 3 on the day...weather, intestinal issues and now can't filter water.  Feels like I'm being punished for not finishing last year..LOL.  Was able to borrow a filter from Jeremy and his son Jack...spring break hiking from Amicalola to Neel Gap.  Only really ate dry food and rehydrated through the night. Was in my sleeping bag and crashing before 7pm.  It's GOT to be better tomorrow!","Springer Mountain trailhead

Very low energy day from the start. Made Ramen noodles for breakfast and was able to refill my water bottles from a fellow hiker.  Stomach feeling better today...fingers crossed.  Packed up a wet tent and ground cover...always a pleasant exercise!  Didn't get going until around 10:10.  Again, low energy day and just kinda walking in a haze.  Met Rob/Sleepwalker, who was the guy getting a pack shakedown from Miss Janet at Springer trailhead.  Very nice guy and NYC fireman on 9/11.  Mood picked up after hearing his story, but energy still low. Pretty much trudged through the day without much eventful happening.   Climb over Sassafras Mtn was rough, but didn't seem as bad as last year.  Arrived at Gooch Gap at 0610 and there was some trail magic...cupcakes and cheese.  My ride to Above the Clouds Hostel arrived shortly after and I was off the trail....BUT, a mix up at the hostel had already checked in someone else named Chris that they thought was me...how about taking down last names or trail names guys?!  So, 'Lucky' the owner of Above the Clouds told me he had booked me into another hostel that just opened up this year...Hidden Pond.  But first, Lucky gave me a Sawyer Mini to resolve my water filter delimma and dropped me off at a convenience store to get a pizza and called Hidden Pond to pick me up there.  Hidden  Pond is owned and run by 'Lost' Johnny and 'Rainbow', 2 thru hikers from 2022 who met on the trail, got married, and bought the property in Suches, GA to open their own hiker's hostel.  Very nice place and setting...they are off to a good start and are great hosts. Met Bob who's a huge Rush fan, so we had a lot to talk about, Matt...trailname, Satellite, 'Georgia', and 'Potholder'.  Found out that Hidden Pond offers slack packing from various points on the trail from Neel Gap to Gooch Gap.  Since the weather the next 2 nights is supposed to be brutally cold, I decided to slackpack and stay a second night here.","

Decided that since Bob/Rush fan and Matt/Satellite were getting dropped off at Jarrard Gap, that I might as well go there also, except I'll hike southbound today, back to where I got off trail yesterday at Gooch Gap. Steep uphill climb from drop-off point on a forest service road to get to the AT.  Parted ways with Bob and Satellite as they headed north to Neel Gap and I headed back south.  VERY COLD DAY!  Was actually able to make good time.  Started on trail about 0910. Passed a lot of hikers that I had stayed with at Hawk Mtn and hiked north with the first 2 days. Got a lot of weird stares like, 'How the hell did you get in front of me?'  A lot did not know what slack packing is. When I got to Woody Gap, I tried to turn my phone on to give an estimate to Hidden Pond of when to pick me up at Gooch Gap. The phone came on, but then the screen went blank...another equipment malfunction?!  Hoping and praying there's someone at Gooch Gap that can call for me! Met Sleepwalker between Woody and Gooch Gap and he offered to share a cabin at Blood Mtn cabins tomorrow night, but he had to check if there was still space from the guy that booked the cabin.  Fingers crossed again...sent myself a text from his phone so he'd have my contact info.  Got to Gooch Gap at 0301pm and had to wait a few minutes before someone came from Above the Clouds to pick up hikers. She tried to call Hidden Pond for me, since my phone was still on the blink, but noone picking up there.  What noone knew was that today was Rainbow's birthday and Johnny and Rainbow had decided not to take in any other new hikers today, so they weren't taking any phone calls. So, I ended up back at Above the Clouds where they finally got through to Johnny to come pick me up.  Johnny then offered me to have dinner with them and some other hiker friends for Rainbow's Birthday...Johnny cooked steaks, shrimp, baked potatoes with all the fixings and a full spread of sushi, since that was Rainbow's favorite.  Not a bad thing having gotten turned out by Above the Clouds a couple days ago!  Oh, and once the phone was plugged into a charger, the screen came on, but phone had only 1% charge....cold weather sapped it.","Jarrard Gap

Had leftover pizza from my first night at Hidden Pond, the packed up and headed back to Jarrard Gap. Got on trail a bit after 10...still cold days, but not as bitter cold and windy as last 2 days.  Met Helen/Peanut and Lisa, who were dropped off at the same location.  Temps supposed to get up to 50 today and hopefully a warming trend coming.  Short hike today, but a big climb over Blood Mountain...the highest peak in GA on the AT and second highest overall in GA.  Hopefully have a place to stay at Blood Mtn cabins, but still have not heard back from Sleepwalker.  Took my time with only 5 miles to Neel Gap.  At Slaughter Creek I stopped to fill my water bottles with my brand new Sawyer Mini that was given to me by Lucky at Above the Clouds and low and behold, IT would not pass any water through it either!!  I was finally able to get some dribbling through it, but would have taken a couple hours just to refill the half a bottle that I was down.  Can't wait to get to Mountain Crossings to buy a brand new one that I can test right there!  Finally got to the top of Blood Mountain and after a bite to eat and some video and pictures, I decided to call and book my own room at Blood Mountain Cabins, since I still had not heard back from Sleepwalker, nor seen him on trail today. I then headed down the other side.  This descent is one that is much worse than the ascent on the other side...a lot of steep stone stairs and boulder hopping down that wears on the knees and hips.  On the way down, I met Chris/Ghost, who I suspect now is the Chris that Above the Clouds gave my room to, 2 nights before. LOL Not his fault though.  Interesting character...decided to offer him a room or bed in my cabin for a share of the cabin cost.  He initially accepted and then decided to press on once he got to Neel Gap and resupplied. Went into Mountain Crossings to finally get my new Sawyer Squeeze and they no longer stock them...are you F'ing kidding me?!  This has quickly become the water filter challenge hike.  The single most popular water filter year in and year out on the AT and anywhere else and the first major outfitter on the trail has decided not to carry them any more!  Had to buy a new one from Platypus called Quickdraw only because I was able to confirm that it is also compatible with my CNOC water bladders...God I hope this works at least until I can find a Sawyer again!  Picked up my resupply box and a few snack items and headed down to Blood Mountain Cabins to check in.  I got the Chipmunk cabin this year.","Jarrard Gap

Got up early (for me) and got going on the trail at 0854.  A bit apprehensive about the miles I have to do today as they are about 2 more than I've done so far and that was slackpacking, and my miles per hour rate has not been very good.  Very fortunate though that today's weather was far and away the best on trail so far...high in the low 50s and sunny all day.  Learned too late that I should have put sun screen on. 🙁  I was able to keep a good pace most all day and I think I got into Low Gap much earlier than last year.  Met Buzzsaw on trail, as well as regulars Peanut, Lisa, Firefly, and Sling.  Also met Radish and Peroni...had seen Peroni off and on since Hawk Mtn, but never got a name.  Came across Trail Magic at Tesnatee Gap...better name for it would be Test-the-knees Gap cause the climb up out of it is the worst on trail so far. Not long, but by far the steepest.  Trail Magic consisted of hot ham and cheese, sodas, Cheetos, and oranges. Wolfed down the food and began the trudge up the aforementioned climb. Down the other side was Hogpen Gap and a mini trail magic presented by ""Sauce"", a 2022 Thru hiker that I probably saw on trail last year. Stuffed another orange in my pocket, downed a bottle of water and headed out.  Rest of the trail was pretty flat in ascent/descent terms, but much of it was what looked like brand new dirt that was always leaning towards the downhill side, which is not bad unless it goes on like that for a mile or more, then it really wears on your feet.  Got to Low Gap around 530pm, which again I think was better than last year and my legs felt good. Ate some dinner, set up camp, hung my food and visited the privy and was nestled in my quilt by 8.  Great Day overall!  I KNOW I was in better shape last year but it's good to know some of the muscle memory from then is still there!","Neel Gap

All good things must come to an end...Rain started sometime early AM.  Woke up at 6am, waited for a break and went to retrieve my food bag and use the privy...rain picked back up by time I headed back to my tent. Climbed back in and waited for another break in the rain...should have been packing everything up inside the tent that I could, but ended up taking a nap waiting for a break and when it came I wasn't ready to jump out and break down the tent, so of course it started raining again when I started taking the tent down.  Ended up not actually starting to hike until 1028.  Kept a good pace uphill for first couple hours and then the trail conditions begain deteriorating quickly. Every step it seemed, my boot slid one way or the other.  Another of traverses across rock slides also with a lot of unstable/moving rocks when you step on them...with wet and muddy boots. Rest of the day was like roller skating on an ice rink.  Fell once on the way up Blue Mtn and twice on the way down into Unicoi Gap, so whoever had day 6 for when he busts his ass, please cash in you tickets.  Easily my worst day this year and may have been worse than any day last year.  Anyway,  got off the trail at 0605pm and caught my shuttle to Hostel Around the Bend. Decided to take a zero there tomorrow.","Low Gap Shelter

Bilbo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660920,"Slept in and enjoyed every minute of it!  Legs and feet, Sooooo needed the break!  Waited until the hiker shuttle headed out and went to do my laundry, cook some breakfast and catch up on journaling.  Have been able to figure out my video editing and still planning to start posting entries to YouTube, but challenge is going to be a good enough WiFi connection when I have time to uploaded footage from the GoPro and upload to YouTube, which I still haven't figured out from my phone.  Hung my tent, ground cloth, rain gear, and anything else that was wet out to dry. Signed up for the 3pm shuttle to Hiawassee and went with group to Hiawassee Brewery for the best fish and chips I've ever had!  Back at the hostel, got a slack pack and packed what I'll be taking with me on a LONG slackpack of 16.9 miles.  I did this last year and it was dark by time I got back to the hostel. This year I'm doing another slackpack of much shorter distance before heading into NC.  Taking my time a bit more early this year as last year I felt near dead by time I got to Franklin. We'll see.","Hostel Around the Bend
