Left San Antonio at 7:20 am and picked up rental car in Albany, NY and drove south to hike a section of NY I missed last fall. I drove around last night to scope out options for parking and getting a ride to my starting point. My first choice for parking on the road into Bear Mountain Park was nixed because I could not get cell service. So I checked out Pallisades Parkway. This is where they rerouted where the trail crosses the road because people keep getting killed by motorists when crossing the road. I get it because speed limit is 55, I was driving 60 while searching for a spot to turn around and go north and I was about run off the road by people going 70+ and weaving in and out of traffic.
Headed over to park off Palisades Parkway on Thursday morning and scheduled Uber to give me a ride over to the Appalachian Market, where I got off the trail last fall. Daryl in his Cadillac gave me a ride. I bought a breakfast sandwich at the market and talked to some guys who bicycled up from the Bronx. Brave souls from what I see about drivers around here.
Trail was nice first thing but I got dizzy and nauseated on the first climb so knew it was going to be a long, hot hike. Some people embrace the heat or at least tolerate it but even with training in the Texas heat the last few months, I am no better prepared for these hot days. Crossed the Hudson River on the Bear Mountain Bridge after a few hours then lost the trail like I always seem to do when I walk on roads. Finally saw a sign for Bear Mountain Park so headed that way. I missed the trail side zoo that I should have passed but no big loss from what I hear.
I was able to buy a cold Powerade at the snack bar near Bear Mountain Inn which was good since I was too hot to eat. The climb up Bear Mountain was on lots of stone steps from the CCC era. There is a parking lot at top for those who drive up to the Perkins Memorial Tower and vending machines so able to stock up on water for the final stretch. I was really dragging by time I made it back to my car around 4:30. I thought it was 12 miles but checking the map again, it shows 14 miles for the stretch I just completed. But mission accomplished and now onward to Vermont to start my last section of the AT.",,View Entry,"Aug 04, Thu",0
Showtime,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655902,"Dropped off my rental car at the airport and took the bus from airport to Bennington, VT for $16. Much better deal then last fall when I had to pay a shuttle driver $100 for the same route. Walked about 6 blocks to the Catamount Motel. Pretty nice for $65.00. Walked over to the post office to mail a package home with duffel bag, day pack and travel clothes. Picked up a burrito for dinner and taking it easy until tomorrow morning.  Hotel will drive me to the trail head.",,View Entry,"Aug 05, Fri",0
Showtime,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656177,"Day 1 (8/6)VT9, Bennington to Goddard Shelter - Mile 1613.9 to 1624 = 10.1 miles
Ready to start my final section. Got a ride to the trail from the Catamount Motel on the first shuttle out at 8:15. On the trail by 8:40. Immediately crossed a stream on a footbridge so good to know the heat has not dried up the water sources. A long climb for about 2.5 miles. Not as warm as N.Y. but more humid so totally drenched within a few minutes. The trail is wet with a few mud holes but nothing like the ankle deep mud I had when hiking this area last fall. I stopped at an overlook around 12:30 and ate lunch and rested and cooled off for about an hour. Met Kronos, a hiker from New Braunfels near where I live. The afternoon was not too bad until the climb up to the shelter. A great water source so quite a few hikers were stocking up and moving on a little further up the hill to the lookout tower on Glastonbury Mountain to watch the sunset and camp. But I am beat so set up my tent and rested a while before fixing dinner and visiting with some other hikers staying in the shelter. It’s sprinkling rain off and on so decided to get in bed and read in case big rains come in.

Day 2 (8/7)Goddard Shelter to IP Logging Road - Mile 1624 to 1638 = 14 miles
Temperatures cooled down and I went to bed at 8:30 and slept great. Woke up at 5:30, made coffee and started packing up. I have a morning routine but with a new pack, I seemed off and it seemed to take forever to get packed up. But still hit the trail a little after 7:00. It was not any lighter than when I got up at 5:30. Made the short climb to the tower but it was socked in with fog and clouds so no point in climbing the tower for the view. All the campers who headed up last night were gone. Most likely when it got cloudy and started thundering last night, they decided to get off the mountain and head for lower ground.
I should know now not to judge the trail by the elevation profile but I thought it was going to be an easy day since there were not a lot of steep climbs. Instead there were so many rocks, roots, mud and puddles that it was not easy at all in spite of the minimal ups and downs. Intermittent rain showers started mid day but the tree canopy kept me fairly dry. It eventually started raining pretty good. I did not care about getting wet since I was already drenched in sweat but I did not have a pack cover and did not want my gear to get wet. I previously used a trash compactor bag as a pack liner but switched to a Nylofume bag since it less bulky. But it is also shorter and does not cover the stuff at the top of my pack very good. I stopped to check my app to see how far the shelter was and looked up and saw it through the trees. Quite a few people had already taken refuge but I got out of the rain and ate lunch. In about 15 minutes the rain had ended so everyone started heading back out. I had gone 9 miles but it was only 2:00 so I moved on too.
The trail was easier with less rocks and roots but more mud at that point. I came to a nice area by the river and should have stopped and camped there but decided to get in a few more miles. I crossed Kelly Stand Road and their was another great camping spot right by the river but I don’t think it is a good idea to camp alone near a road. It was a gravel road but a couple of cars had already gone by. There were a couple of guys I camped with last night that were behind me so I thought about hanging around for awhile to see if they showed up but decided to keep moving. A mile and a half later I found a good spot by a logging road. It’s obvious this road is not used much. I think it is mostly used by mountain bikers. A long day so I set up camp. It is warm and muggy tonight so probably won’t sleep as well as last night.

Day 3 (8/8)Logging road to William Douglas Shelter - 1638 to 1648.2 = 10.2 miles
Number one reason I don’t sleep in shelters. A guy walked by while I was packing up and said he had stayed at the cabin up on the mountain but had almost no sleep because of someone snoring so bad. He finally gave up at 3:30 and was on the trail by 4:00 am. I did not sleep well either because it was so warm. I read for a while then tossed and turned while listening to loud strange bird calls in the night. That’s the other reason I don’t like shelters because I feel like I am bothering others when I can’t sleep. I suppose if you can sleep through snoring then my iPad light is not going to keep you up.
Good thing I stopped when I did last night because because I immediately started a difficult climb up to Stratton Mountain. When I reached the fire tower, I climbed about half way up to confirm what I already knew. No views because of the fog. But the wind sure felt good. Once I made it through the descent off the mountain, the trail was much easier than the last couple of days.
I made it to Stratton Pond at noon and stopped for lunch. It was very nice. I took off my shoes and socks and soaked my feet in the water. There was a nice breeze so I cooled off and let the sweat dry. The trail was not too bad in the afternoon and then the rain started about 2:30. Just like yesterday, it rain pretty good but it was over in about 15 - 20 minutes. I had a choice of 10 miles or 13 miles to a shelter. I am thinking of going into Manchester tomorrow so opted for 10 miles since that leaves just 6 miles to town. The William Douglas Shelter is 0.5 miles off the main trail but level trail although muddy due to the rain. I am the only one here so I guess no one wanted to make the trek off f the main trail. I don’t think this shelter is used much because the privy has been removed. Nothing left but the platform in front. No signs for the water source either. Supposedly a spring near by but I could not find it. I just got water from one of the run off channels coming down the hill. My old pack, an Osprey Aura, really bothered my shoulders and it took constant adjustments and use of some old shoulder pads to cushion my shoulder straps to keep the pain at bay. A couple of people told me the pack was too big so maybe that contributed but I think it just did not fit me well. So I bought a Gossamer Gear Mariposa pack for this section. Yesterday, same problem, my left shoulder hurt so bad, I was contemplating having Gil mail me my old pack or buying something new. So today I packed things differently to move some of the weight off the left side and used my foam shoulder pads to cushion from the start instead of waiting until my shoulder started hurting. It was not perfect but much better today so maybe there is hope.
Storms moved through the area, no rain but it cooled things off so much more comfortable than when I arrived in camp.
Day 4 (8/9)William Douglas Shelter to VT Route 11/30 (Manchester, VT) - 1648.2 to 1654 = 5.8 miles
Rain started around 8:00 but I was settled in so read for a while and then listened to the rain which just put me to sleep. Up at 6:00 but no hurry since just 6 miles today to get to town for much needed shower, laundry and resupply. My tent leaked a little so sleeping bag a little wet. I like my REI one man Quarter Dome but I think it has a design flaw. The rainfly does not cover the corners so it leaks on the side opposite from the vestibule. I patched a small hole and treated the bathtub bottom with sealer before I headed out which helped but it still leaks a little. Another wet and muddy day, missed a turn near Prospect Rock but corrected pretty quickly and made it to the highway before noon. I was told this was an easy place to hitchhike but I am not comfortable with that and it is a really busy road so I tried Uber. No drivers. Not interested in walking 3.5 miles so called the EconoLodge where I am staying and they gave me a ride for $10. Took a shower and walked next door to Bob’s Diner for lunch while my clothes washed. Tried Uber again for ride to town. No luck. Taxi was $15 for 2 miles to town so I decided to walk to the grocery store. Fortunately it clouded up so not too hot. The grocery store was open but I am learning that shops and restaurants are often not open or not open during posted times. I went to a gas station/market but when I opened the door, it was just a big open room, no market. Then another 2 miles back to the hotel. So much for a rest day.","

VT Route 11/30 (Manchester) to Peru Peak Shelter 1654 - 1664.1 = 10.1 miles
Leisurely morning since my ride to trail is at 9:00. When I walked outside, I could not believe how cool it felt. Fairly gradual climb for about 2 miles and I visited with a couple from California out for a day hike. Then a steep climb for about a half a mile. A bus load of students were also out for a hike and every few minutes I would pull over for a group of 10 - 15 to go by. Then the trail came out onto a wide grassy slope. When I saw the snow making machine, I realized Bromley Mountain was a ski area. I did not stick around since there were so many people but I read later that hikers can sleep overnight in the ski warming hut.Trail dropped down to Mad Tom Notch with a gravel road. I decided it was a good time to stop for lunch. Jeff from Green Mountain House, a hostel near Manchester came by to replenish the cache of water jugs he maintains since there are no natural water sources in the area. I met Doppler and Queu an older couple heading to Maine too as well as a few other hikers. I am seeing one or two NOBO thru hikers a day. So far, all started in Georgia in April except one couple from Alaska started in March. Also seeing some SOBOs too that started at Katahdin in June. Everyone is moving quicker than me.Another climb to Styles Peak and then Peru Peak. Slow going this afternoon. Then about a quarter mile before I reached the Peru Peak Shelter, I slipped and fell. Right knee and left hand banged up a little but nothing major. While I am sitting there on the ground trying to get motivated to get moving again, I figured I would take an Advil to get ahead of the pain I  knew was coming. When I made it to the shelter, Doppler and Queu decided to go another half mile to the campground at Griffith Lake. I have a spot next to a stream so very peaceful. And I am alone once again. I was hoping for some company tonight but everyone that has come by is pushing on to get in more miles. Just heard someone walk up and I can hear them talking about the tent sites. And they are moving on too. Alone again.Day 6 (8/11)
Peru Peak Shelter to Greenwall Shelter - 1664.1 to 1678.6 = 14.5 milesHit the trail by 7:30 and was at Griffith Lake in about 10 minutes. Nice tent sites there. Ran into Doppler and Queu and ate breakfast with them next to the lake. Nice and easy trail for the first few hours. At one point, I realized I was humming a song but not paying any attention. Then realized it was Kane Brown’s “Homesick”. I was feeling kind of homesick, missing Gil and the dogs. And the chickens. But I know from experience I usually feel that way at the begin of a trip then I am fine after I get into the groove. Hit a real gnarly set of rocks at Baker Peak that required climbing more than walking. Stopped at Little Rock Pond for lunch around 1:30. Very nice shelter and tent sites there too. I was really tempted to stay for the night but it was only 2:00 so kept moving. The trail was much more difficult in the afternoon. The climb was not too bad but lots of rocks and roots. Decided to try for Greenwall Shelter but the water source is dry so stocked up on water at a stream 3.5 miles back. About a half a mile before the shelter, the wind picked up, it cooled down and got really dark. There was a hilly trail into the shelter and I was just trying to make it before the rain came. I got my tent set up and settled in and was getting my dinner stuff together to go over to the picnic table when major rain started. Now everything is wet and spattered with mud and leaf litter. But much cooler so I am a happy camper.Day 7 (8/12)Greenwall Shelter to Hwy 103 1678.6 - 1686.4 = 7.8 milesCool enough to put on long sleeves this morning especially since I will be stopping in 0.8 mikes to get water at the stream and can change. Best trail so far this trip. If you have to climb a mountain then the climb to Bear Mountain is how it should be. Long sweeping switchbacks on almost rock free trails. Still hard and slow but as good as it can be. Just one really gnarly section of rock slabs at the very top. Made it to Hwy 103 where maybe there is a bus to Rutland and maybe not. I walked about a half mile to where it is supposed to pick up but saw nothing to indicate a bus stop so headed back to trail. Ran into the hikers from Maine and they also wanted to go into town so Timber tracked down a shuttle driver to take us to the Yellow Deli Hostel. This place is very controversial and considered a cult by some people but it appears to just be a faith based group of hippie type people who live a communal type life. They are nice and friendly and run the Yellow Deli which had awesome sandwiches and the hiker hostel during peak hiker season. Men’s bunks on Floor 2 and Women’s on Floor 3. Raven and I have a bunk room to ourselves. There is a nice bathroom with showers, washer/dryer and a common area with kitchen.After getting settled in, I had to make a work call then walked over to Walmart for a few resupply items. Ate dinner across the street and finally showered and did laundry. We were able to hang our wet tents over the water pipe running over our heads in the common room so got everything covered.Day 8 (8/13)
Hwy 4 to Hwy 103 ( 1686.4 - 1704.1)First one up at 5:30 so made coffee. Settled in with my coffee and my online newspaper and within 5 minutes, one of the other women sat down and started sorting and repackaging her resupply items. So much for a quiet start to my morning. Timber, Raven, Socrates (TRS) and I are slackpacking today. The buses in Vermont are free and the bus station is one block away and will drop us off at Hwy 4 and we will hike back to Hwy 103 where we got off trail yesterday. Just 17.6 miles. We got on the 7:15 bus but Timber accidentally said we we were heading to Hwy 103 instead of Hwy 4 so bus driver said we were on wrong bus. After we got off, we realized what happened but now we had to wait for the 8:15 bus. I decided to go back to the hostel to get my headlamp in case we did not get done before dark. Made it to the trail and made the 6 mile climb up to Killington Peak where the ski area is. Climbed the 0.2 mile wicked, steep final section to the top where there is a great view and food. The others were almost finished eating by time I got there but I got a sandwich and we watched the mountain bikers get off the gondola with their bikes after riding up so they can ride down the mountain. Then back down the wicked, steep section to start the final 12 miles. About 5 minutes after I got back on the trail, I realized my wallet was missing. I could not fathom having to make that steep climb up to the top one more time. I just started back up when I remembered I had put my puffy jacket on at top and sure enough, it was in my jacket pocket.Then I started thinking what the hell was I thinking when I decided to slackpack with a group of people half my age. I am going as fast as I can but cannot come close to keeping up. They promised they would wait for me so I only took a couple of quick breaks and kept pushing on. They were waiting at the final lookout before the end of the trail and called the shuttle driver as soon as I got there. Only another half mile down a steep rock scramble and it was almost dark. But I made it and survived. When we got back to the hostel, we walked down the block for pizza but they refused to let us order because they were closing in 20 minutes. So ordered Dominos for delivery. Very long day and now the hostel is packed. Even the top bunks in our room are taken.Day 9 (8/14)Hwy 4 to Stony Brook Shelter (1704.1 - 1714.1 = 10 miles)Slept in until 6:00. Made coffee and read the paper before packing up. Hiker breakfast available at 8:00. Scrambled eggs with cheese, scoop of brown rice, apples, and the most awesome homemade scones made with spelt flour, apples and cinnamon. Caught the 9:15 bus back to the same trailhead as yesterday but heading north this time. Only 10 miles today. Long climb in the morning up to Sherburne Pass. The trail cuts through Gifford Woods State park. A pretty, peaceful place so I stopped and sat at picnic table to eat a snack and watch the chickadees. Started to warm up but 70s warm instead of 80-90s warm. Then a steep climb up to Quimby Mountain. These steep uphills just kill me and never seem to get any easier. I was concerned because Far Out did not have any comments about water status in about a week and I was just about out. The stream was no longer running but there was a good size pool to dip from. Last two late nights are catching up to me so I I sure did not want to keep hiking in search of water.Day 10 (8/15)
Stony Brook Shelter to Ascutney Mountain (1714.1 - 1726.6 = 12.5 miles)I heard lots of people coming into camp last night and when I went to get my food bag from the Bear Box, it was jam packed so lots of people camped here last night. Saw a couple camped down by the water and then when I got to Stony Brook, a sea of tents all through the woods. Since it is so easy to get into Rutland and the Yellow Deli is also a big draw, I think a lot of people head in to town and then this is a good distance to make heading out even if you get a late start.Climbed all morning but at least the climbs were broken up with some downhills. My goal was to get to The Lookout for lunch. It is a private cabin open to hikers. After eating lunch, I climbed a tall ladder to a small platform on the roof. It was a clear day with views of The Whites way off in the distance. That is where we are headed. Made it to Wintturi Shelter about 3:00 but too early to stop so ate a snack, topped off my water and headed out with TRS. Hiked another 2.5 miles and found a good camping spot on Ascutney Mountain so decided to stop. The others moved on.Day 11 (8/16)
Ascutney Mountain to a spot in the woods (1726.6 - 1739.6 = 13 miles)Almost out of water after fixing coffee. And fuel canister is now empty. Easy morning and hiked a little over a mile to the first road and got water and ate breakfast. Hiked to the next road and stopped to check the map and a car pulled up and TRS got out. They had hitched to a nearby restaurant for breakfast. They take tons of breaks so even though they hike fast, we often end up at the same place. Not too bad of a day, crossed multiple roads and streams in the morning. Afternoon prospects did not look too good for water so got water from a slow moving stream with lots of algae. Oh well, that is what filters are for. Rain showers started off and on around 2:00. Made it to Thistle Hill Shelter by 3:00 and once again too early to stop so kept on moving. Around 5:00, the terrain leveled off and I saw a couple of tents set up so decided this was a good time for me to stop too. Since I am out of fuel and cannot cook dinner, I just snacked. Heading into town tomorrow.Day 12 (8/17)
Mile 1739.6 to Hanover, NH (1751) = 11.4 miles aWoohoo, Vermont is done! Since I could not make coffee, I got up around 6:00 and started packing. I did mix my instant coffee in my Instant Breakfast but just not the same. Walked a short way to a stream and filled up with water. Then crossed the White River in West Hartford, VT where hikers were already jumping 50-60 feet off the bridge into the river at 8:30. I was encouraged to join them. Once upon a time I would have been up to the challenge but those days are gone. The trail follows a road through town and I finally had decent cell phone service to try and find a hotel in Hanover. But none to be found. This is the home of Dartmouth and if I had known there was such a shortage of rooms, I would I have booked something before I left Rutland. I did find something in White River Junction just south of Hanover. Back on the trail and even after stopping for a snack, I was really hungry. Made it to Norwich about 2:00, long downhill road that killed my knees and detoured a short distance to Dan and Whit’s General Store. A really cool place with groceries, deli, pet supplies, hardware store, garden center and more. There motto is if they don’t have it, you don’t need it. I had Gatorade, pizza and ice cream. Feeling much better after that. The trail then follows a busy road over the Connecticut River and up a hill into Hanover. I passed a bus stop and talked to the driver about the bus system. Once I made it to Hanover, I went by the Post Office to pick up a package and then over to the bus stop. Waited about 5 minutes and the bus to White River Junction came and dropped me off about a block from my hotel. The hotel is across the street from the VAMC and I recognized it it from a business trip there about 15 years ago. A lot more built up now. So glad to be here. Taking tomorrow off. Time to recuperate before getting back on the trail.
Day 13 (8/18)Zero day. Last night, I did laundry and walked to a nearby market for a bottle of wine and a frozen dinner. This morning, coffee, newspaper, breakfast, finished my book. This afternoon, I took the bus over to the Food Co op to get a few resupply items and dinner for tonight. Missed the return bus so walked back the 1.6 miles. Should have waited because the bus drove by just as I got back to the hotel. I am depressed because temps in high 80s next few days.","

Showtime,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657028,"Day 14 (8/19)Hanover to Moose Mountain ShelterTopsy turvy day. Caught the bus back to the trail but when we stopped at the transit spot where you can change buses, I discovered I was on the wrong bus. My driver was really nice and ran ahead to stop the driver of the green bus to have him wait for me. We drove to some out of the way spots and then went by the transit center for a shift change. Our new driver was a woman who talked to herself and was doing all kinds of crazy hand gestures. Then she threw the microphone for the intercom system apparently because it was not working to her satisfaction. But eventually made it to my stop and she told me to have a nice day. Walked about 15 minutes through town until back on the trail.Another rocks and roots uphill morning. The streams were dry and I planned to stop after a road that was at the 5 mile mark for lunch. When I reached the road, there were some hikers and a woman who offered me a Gatorade and an apple. I recognized her from last year. It was Sherpa, who is providing support for her husband No Bear who is doing a combination of hiking and slack packing and giving a little trail magic in the process. We hiked 2.5 miles to 3 Mile Road and she met us again. Another Gatorade and she topped off our water since none at the shelter. A short distance later, there was a stream so I filled my two liter bladder since I heard no water for another 8 miles. Carrying that extra water was a major pain since I just resupplied and my pack is already heavy. When I attempted to make dinner, my new fuel canister was leaking. I borrowed someone’s stove and it worked fine so appears to be my stove and not my new fuel canister. So no coffee tomorrow unless I can borrow another stove in the morning. Going to call in the morning to see if Eastern Mountain Sports has a stove in stock and if so, will need to get a ride back to town. Otherwise will have to order from Amazon to be delivered in a few days. Plus lot so of campers so there are two other tents set right next to me since limited tent sites so not much privacy tonight. One is a couple I met on the trail and on the same bus to the hotel. The other is a SOBO thru hiker so picked his brain about the upcoming White Mountains.Day 15 (8/20)Moose Mountain Shelter to Smarts MountainHot, hard and hurting kind of day. I woke at 5:00 but could not make coffee so read until it started to get light. Started packing up and the couple camped next to me offered me use of their stove so made coffee after all. Took my time since EMS does not open until 10:00 so no point getting to road before then. No breeze at all so warm right away. When I made it to the road, no cell service so carried on. Then a hot climb to the next road but Sherpa there waiting for No Bear so she gave me a cold lemonade. Headed out again but stopped and ate lunch before the long climb to Smarts Mountain. Every stream I crossed was dry but eventually made it to Grant Brook and topped off my water bottles. Also filled my water bladder part way since no water at top but not full because too much weight to carry. After that, I started the 4 mile climb to Smarts Mountain. It was very warm, the trail was extremely difficult and my shoulder was throbbing. By the end, I was moving at a snail’s pace. Did not get to camp until 6:30. Camp sites are not real level but who cares at this point. There is fire tower nearby so maybe I will check it out in the morning. It’s the over the hill group tonight - Crazy Cop who I met last night is 75 and Sheffie And Uphill, two guys I met on the trail also in their 60s. I was able borrow their stove and fix dinner. Ended up cleaning up in the dark by headlamp. Definitely not level because I am already sliding to the foot of my tent.Day 16 (8/21)Smarts Mountain to Hwy 25AAfter the grueling day yesterday, I was thinking I was in over my head and just cannot handle this anymore. But slept great since cool and breezy and started off fresh so feeling better. I hiked with No Bear and Free Bird in the morning. The long climb down the mountain was not bad and then started a climb back up to Mount Cube. After passing dry creeks, there was good water at Jacobs Creek. We stopped at the half way point and ate lunch. I left the other two behind at that point and started through the Eastman Ledges. I am really slow through these big giant rocks and rock slabs but they are kind of fun trying to figure out the best route and determine where the trail is since there are such few blazes. Then the long climb down with achy knees through more dry creek beds. Finally hit Bracket Brook which was still flowing so I topped off. Should have got more since tomorrow is not looking promising. Made it to 25A and found Sheffie and Uphill setting up in a nice area not far from the road. I figured it was OK to camp here close to the road since they were here. Borrowed Sheffie’s stove again to fix dinner. Not too bad of a day but still warm so going to be hard to sleep.Day 17 (8/22)Hwy 25A to 25C (Hikers Welcome Hostel)On the trail by 7:00. Low on water and next water is in 5 miles so just some granola with the last of my blueberries for breakfast. Warm but trail not too bad. Made it to Ore Hill Brook by 10:00. Filtered some water and talked to a young thru hiker named Road Frog. I finally got my caffeine fix by mixing coffee with Instant Breakfast. The next section was harder and warmer but still made it to 25C by 1:00. Just a short walk over to the Hikers Welcome Hostel. Sheffie and Uphill were setting up their tents when I arrived. I set up my tent and went to check out the lay of the land. There are two bunk houses but I prefer to tent. There are multiple picnic tables with canopies and outdoor areas to shower, wash dishes and do laundry. I put my name on the list for the shower and plugged in my electronics then visited and scoped out the options for tomorrow. Got my shower and combined my clothes with Marina and Grimace’s load so clean clothes on the way. My package had arrived so I have cold weather clothes for tackling the White Mountains. Next up is the trek over Mount Mooselauke and it sounds rather daunting. Trying to decide if I am going to slackpack it. Sheffie was shuttled over to get his car and when he returned he drove us over to Appleknockers which is a market and has take out pizza. We ordered pizza and bought a salad to split and a bottle of wine. Resupply options were rather limited. We came back and sat outside and ate our pizza, salad and wine. The natives are restless so a group is inside watching bad TV and another group is sitting outside and loudly entertaining each other. Rain is due in at any time but so far just some light showers. OK because I am settled into my tent so good to go.Day 18 (8/23)Zero day Hikers Welcome HostelLots of reasons I am not hiking today. Supposed to rain and I did not want to tackle the steep slopes of Mount Mooselauke with wet rocks. I am trying to decide if I am going to slackpack this section since a long steep climb and descent. And I want to determine a plan for the Whites. Slept in until 6:15 and had to battle the early crowd for the microwave to heat coffee for water since coffee maker cannot keep up with the crowd. It was so awesome to leisurely read my book and drink my coffee. Sheffie and Uphill headed out about 7:30. Uphill is going to be on the trail for awhile but Sheffie is just dayhiking and heading home to Allentown in the morning.I made a reservation at the Notch Hostel tomorrow night. I am going to offload most of my gear into a trash bag and the morning shuttle will drop it off at the hostel so I can slackpack tomorrow. Then planning another day of slackpacking from that location. Then I will be in the high elevations working my way to Mount Washington. I am really nervous of how this section is going to go. I sorted through my food and organized everything after getting some resupply items in my box from home. Checked emails, read my book, the normal things you do on a zero. I was hanging out in the common room for awhile charging my electronics and managing to tune out the really cheesy movie dialogue from some really awful movies. Then a guy came in who really needed to shower and wash his clothes and smelled really bad so I made my exit back to my tent. 

Some rain showers in mid afternoon keeping it cooled off. After fixing dinner, I went to pay my bill and discovered no one has signed up for tomorrow’s shuttle. If it does not go then he will not take my gear to the hostel. Started raining pretty good so headed to my tent and will check again in the morning.Day 19 (8/24)Hwy 25C to Kinsman NotchPacked up in a light rain and on the trail at 7:15. Lots of people on shuttle list so driver will drop my gear off at the Notch Hostel so I can slackpack over Mount Moosilauke. Crossed a shallow stream then started a medium climb. The trail climbs through hardwood forests that turn into conifers as you climb to higher elevations. Eventually you think you have reached the summit but a sign says 0.9 miles more. The trail is flat for a while and the rain has stopped but trail is full of puddles. Then starts climbing through rocks again with lots of cairns most likely to guide you through the foggy summit. Then the spruce trees become stunted so I knew I was nearing the summit. It was really windy and foggy on top so I put on my raincoat just to keep warm. Took some pictures and kept on moving to get off the summit. First couple of miles were just normal rocky and then right before you hit the shelter, it started to rain and the trail became major rocky. As in totally crazy downhill with rocks you have to climb up, down, over or around and slippery to boot. The river flows downhill over a smooth rock bed so more like a waterfall for miles and the trail just follows along side it. Eventually made it to the parking lot for pick up at 4:30. Visited with some other hikers going to the Colony Ski Club and Sherpa who was waiting for No Bear. When we arrived at The Notch, you leave your pack and shoes in the shed and take your gear and food to your bunk room. Then shuttle to grocery store for resupply. I am not sure what my plans are and don’t want to carry a lot of weight going into the Presidentials so just got a few items. Attempted to order food from the Mexican restaurant next door but line out the door so back to the deli at the grocery store for spaghetti and meatballs, and a bottle of wine of course.Day 20Another slackpack day. Hostel dropped us off at Kinsman Notch and we hike 16 miles to Frankonian Notch for pick up at 7:00 pm. Sounded reasonable but boy was I wrong. On the trail at 7:30. Started climbing right away but not too bad. Not feeling too good so hoped I was not getting sick but OK after a while. Lots of moss and lichens so trail kind of eery but made it to half way point by 1:00. Stocked up on water and ate lunch and headed out for a steep climb and then a long downhill. Lots of rocks following Eliza Brook uphill but at least not as bad as Moosilauke and not raining except suddenly it was as bad. Back to crazy bad. Eventually made it to the top of South Kinsman Mountain and thought at least heading downhill now. Not any better and now on north side of mountain with lots of large damp rock slabs. At least the rock slabs are pitted and rough so not real slippery. But they never end. I did not take any breaks all afternoon and still did not make it to Lonesome Lake Hut until 6:30. Still 3 more miles to go. Plus one mile of road walking to visitor center where pick up is. Supposedly easier trail now but who knows. There was no way I was going to make 7:00 shuttle so after talking to the people at hut, decided to head down the Lonesome Lake Trail which was only 1.5 miles to road. Poor cell phone service so running up and down trail to find a spot where I could make a phone call to taxi to pick me up at Lafayette Campground where trails let’s out. Almost 9:00 by time I made it back to hostel. Called for delivery of Chinese food and took a shower. Looked for my bottle of wine but it was gone. My fault, I did not put my name on it. I am totally trashed so just crashed in bed.","

Showtime,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657538,"Day 21 (8/26) 
Another zero day. Not the plan. With getting in so late, the thought of getting packed up and ready to catch the 7:20 am shuttle this morning was too much to deal with. And storms due in so hiking in the rain today was not very appealing. Up at 5:30 and coffee was made and someone had already made a bunch of pancakes. Another leisurely morning of coffee and newspaper. Several others are taking a zero to avoid the rain. The hostel is full tonight so we will be tenting.
This hostel is kind of unique because it does not cater to just hikers. Skiers in winter and people just passing through. Last night, I visited with Metric, a SOBO thru hiker from Australia who has been living in Canada. And Mother Goose and her 3 daughters, NOBO thru hikers from Houston. There is a large family from Italy who speak limited English. It is obvious they enjoy each other’s company. Quite a few transgender people who work or stay here. A real melting pot of people coming and going. It nice to have a little socialization. 
Day 22 (8/27)
Franconia Notch to Garfield Campground 
The best of times and the worst of times. Shuttle dropped us off at 7:50. Since no place to be dropped off near trail, we have to walk a mile on a paved road from the Plume Visitor Center to the trail. Hard climb for 2 miles to a stream near Liberty Springs Campground then another small climb where we stopped for lunch with Mother Goose and her daughters and a few other hikers. Then the trail headed up to the Franconia Ridge, an open ridge line in an alpine area above timber line with amazing views. Definitely the highlight of the trail so far. It was sunny with occasional clouds and the trail climbed gradually up to a series of peaks including Mt Lincoln and Mt Lafayette. I saw a glider down below us. The trail eventually dropped back down below timber line into mud and rocks for miles. Then a rocky steep climb at top then a short drop down from a stream into the Garfield Campground. We did not arrive until 7:00 and we had to check in with the caretaker to pay and get a pass and be assigned a camp site. There was a line of people waiting for sites and it was getting late. He assured us he had a place for all of us but it took forever since he seemed to be socializing with everyone when we just wanted to get a camping spot before dark. I was sent to a grassy spot behind another group of tents and by time I walked back to the stream for water, it was dark. I set up a wet tent from the morning’s heavy dew and cooked dinner by headlamp. Somewhere in packing up my gear to be moved from one hostel to another, my inflatable pillow disappeared. Oh well, could be worse. 
Day 23 (8/28)
Garfield Campground to Zealand Falls Hut
Water was dripping from the top of my tent on my head all night long so everything was pretty damp when I got up. Had coffee, on trail by 7:30. The trail started with a long rocky descent through a stream bed with tired legs. And it feels like I have shin splints in my right leg. Stopped at the Galehead Hut for a free baked good we get with our camping pass. Applesauce cake was delicious and sitting in the sun with a view on such a beautiful day and I felt better already. Then more rocks, more climbs, more rock slabs. I am really starting to have second thoughts about this whole thing. I slipped and fell several times late in the day but just a few minor scrapes. Thankfully the trail was easier towards the end so made good time and arrived at the Zealand Falls Hut about 5:00. The only bunks left in the section I was assigned was a third bunk up. I asked if they had any others so I went to to the other side and found a bottom bunk. Dinner at 6:00. Lots of young kids and learned there is an easy 2.7 mile trail into the Hut. The same trail that staff haul in supplies on.
Then listened to a talk about how they run the Hut. Propane and staples are airlifted in twice a year before Memorial Day and after Labor Day when the weather cooperates. Which means they sometimes run short. No sugar for coffee. Fresh food is carried in twice a week. Toilets are composting toilets. A well for drinking water. Hydroelectric from nearby waterfall for electric but they are very stingy because not as plentiful as other huts. Probably a 40 watt bulb in the bathroom. Lights out at 9:00. I did not quite make it to 9:00 Crashed and slept like a log until almost 6:00 am. 
Day 24 (8/29)
Zealand Falls Hut to RR tracks near Ridley Falls, mm 1847.4 
Coffee then breakfast at 7:00. One of the reasons I am staying at a couple of the huts is for meals since resupply is very difficult in the Whites and that stretches my food supply. A real bed is nice too especially after the fiasco at camp the night before.
Only 7.6 miles today. The last couple of days I have been overwhelmed by the difficult trail and thinking maybe I should get off. My knees are bothering me and I am getting shin splints in my right leg. But realize I just need to cut back my mileage since I cannot control the terrain. Instead of 10 miles, aim for 8. And today was probably the easiest day of this trip so far. The first couple of miles were smooth and flat with occasional rocks. There was an old rock slide that opened up the the view to the valley below. I stopped for water at the Ethan Pond Shelter and ran into Mother Goose. They decided to zero there since the state park where they were headed was full. I had a nice leisurely lunch and we talked to the campground caretaker. Met a SOBO thru hiker who is trying to complete the trail in 90 days. He was behind schedule but should be able make up miles once he gets further south and easier terrain. I have another big climb tomorrow so wanted to knock out a few more miles. Since nowhere official to camp, I just set up near the trail near the RR tracks. Supposedly no night time trains per comments in Far Out. None so far. Settled in early so a chance to read my book. Tigger who I talked to earlier showed up to camp just as it was getting dark. He had hiked down to the main road and hitchhiked into town for resupply and dinner and hiked back to camp. 
Day 25 (8/30) RR tracks to Mizpah Hut 
Easy walk to Saco River. Met some hikers and commented that it was a great camping spot. Right underneath the No Camping sign. Watered up then started the climb to Mount Webster. Already warm and sweating buckets. The first half of the trail was steep but smooth and not many rocks up to Webster Cliffs. Some great stealth camping spots there if you don’t mind hauling water up. Then back to traditional climbing up big rocks and rock slabs. At least now when I encounter one of these giant slabs, instead of going OMG, I can't do this, I just scope it out quickly for the best route and start climbing. When I made it to Mount Webster, I finally had cell service so called Gil who was getting very concerned about me since he had not heard from me in several days. I ate lunch on a rock with great views. The final 3 miles were not too bad - per New Hampshire standards. Checked into The Mizpah Hut. Only 6 miles to Mt Washington but I am very concerned because there is nowhere to camp for 13 or more miles. Decided I will stay at Lake of the Clouds Hut which is only 5 miles and that leaves a much more manageable day after that up to Mt Washington. 

Day 26 (8/31)
Mizpah Hut to Lakes of the Cloud Hut 
Rained in the morning so waited until it cleared up about 9:00 to head out. Just 5 miles. A climb up to x then the usual trail up and down over mini summits. All socked in with fog. Then climbed a ridge up to Mt Pierce. Weather cleared up enough for a nice view. Made it to the Hut about 1:00. Had soup and a brownie and watched the bad weather roll in. Eventually went to my bunk to read and get warm since I have wet feet from all the puddles on the way up. Late afternoon, it cleared up and there were wonderful views of Mt Washington and a beautiful sunset. Anxious about climbing up to Mt Washington tomorrow, if the weather cooperates. 
The staff at the huts are great. They work really hard and hauling supplies and trash in and out is part of theiy job description. They do funny skits and seem to really enjoy their jobs. The facilities are very basic. Bunk rooms, no heat, no showers, no electricity for charging electronics but includes very filling dinner and breakfast.  
Day 27 (9/01)
Lake of the Clouds Hut to Mount Washington
It was clear at 6:00 am but clouds rolling in by 7:00. Forecast did not look promising. I did not want to hike alone so when I found a group getting ready to head up mid morning, I packed up and joined them. The trail is a mile and half and all rocks but at least no giant steps or rock slabs. This is the route the staff use to haul supplies in and trash out from the Hut. Completely socked in with no view but at least the rocks were dry and not slippery. The wind gusts were really bad the last 0.2 miles. My left arm was sore from using it to brace myself from the wind with my pole. Once we made it to the visitor center, we dropped our packs in the pack room and hung up our wet clothes that I did not even realize were wet from the fog. Temp was 36 degree and wind velocity was 53 mph with gusts up to 70 mph. After eating and warming up, we suited up for the climb down. There was an expanding group of us and we wandered around trying to find the NOBO trail. Finally asked a forest ranger and he pointed us in the right direction while also alerting us to the really bad conditions. By time we found the trail, I was really cold and the could not maneuver on the wet rocks without the high winds knocking me over. That’s when I decided this was crazy and I bailed. Found the forest ranger and he said I could take the hiker shuttle down to Pinkham Notch. There is a lodge and bus service available. I bought a ticket and had to hang out for an hour and a half before joining others with the same idea as me. I was planning on being on Gorham, NH on Friday but there are not hotels or hostels available due to the Labor Day Weekend. Decided I was ready to go home. Checked into the lodge which included dinner and breakfast and took a shower then researched flights home. I could not believe I could get a flight home tomorrow out of Boston for $148. And the Concord Bus will pick me up right in front of the lodge at 8:07 am tomorrow morning and drop me off at the Boston airport a few hours before my flight. I think that is a sign that it is time to go home. Maine will be waiting for me next year.","
