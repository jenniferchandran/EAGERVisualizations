Tuesday's Gone,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660361,"Back in 2012 I attempted a thru hike and made it to Waynesboro, Va before being forced off with a problem. I am going to attempt a SOBO this time due to work schedule and the amount of hikers on trail. Back in 2012 the total NOBO's was 2100. Hoping to climb big K on the 7th of June and start south. I will try to update this journal every few days but I am 61 years old and not of the social media generation. Not sure how to do a photo but I hope to figure it out.",,View Entry,"Mar 01, Wed",0
Tuesday's Gone,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660393,"The first time I was  on the AT was in 1974 as a Tenderfoot scout. We were in NC somewhere and camped near where we slept and the next day did a day hike to a shelter, had lunch, and went back to the camp site. A few years later I earned my 50 miler badge on the AT in GA.",,View Entry,"Mar 02, Thu",0
Tuesday's Gone,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660413,In 2003 I went to a talk from a couple that had just finished the trail and they said they were on trail journals. I had not known of it so I went to it and have followed it ever since. I have enjoyed following peoples journeys so I thought I would let people follow me. I probably will not write much till June and on the trail but I wanted to get started and try to post something with my phone and get a picture on this thing but I am no good with the computer so I may need some help.,,View Entry,"Mar 03, Fri",0
