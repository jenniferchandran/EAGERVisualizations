My family and friends, for their baffled support of this journey.  Daughter, sister, wife, mother, grandmother, friend - our lives are a rich tapestry of relationships, and I know my absence creates a hole. Thank you.  



All those Appalachian Trail Thru-hikers who came before and left breadcrumbs in trailjournals.com for others to follow.  I have learned so much from all of you - and hope to leave breadcrumbs for future hikers. 

*** 

How does an out-of-shape 64 year old woman decide that an AT thru-hike attempt is something she wants to do more than anything else?  I wish I could tell you.  I hiked to Sunfish Pond as a child, in the Whites as a teen in summer camp, and did a 100 mile section hike of Shenandoah in 2018 with my eldest daughter.  At no point did I profess the desire to do a thru-hike.  In fact, after the Shenandoah trip I swore I was done. 

And yet. 

And yet, the AT got under my skin.  After the Shenandoah trip, I started reading more about the history of the AT, and the different sections..  About previous thru-hikers and the challenges they faced.  About what worked and what didn’t.  My horizons expanded to Trail Journals, The Trek, podcasts and Reddit.  I researched (more accurately, fell down the rabbit hole of) gear and food and skills and conditioning.   On a flyer, I sat down to map out the mileage to see if it was even possible given my constraints.   

It was, barely. 

And so, off I go.  I will do a non-traditional flip flop hike.  Instead of walking from Georgia to Maine from March to September, I will be doing the southern half (Harpers Ferry WV to GA) in the fall and the northern half (Harpers Ferry to ME) in the spring/summer of next year.  I hope to finish it all within a 12 month period. 

The general reaction has been “You’re kidding, right?” 

Trail names, the common address used between hikers on the trail, are traditionally given from one person to another. I feel I have been given mine already, many times, before the start of my hike. And so my trail name is Kidding Right.  But my friends call me Kidding.  This journal will track my progress.",,View Entry,"Aug 15, Mon",0
Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656687,"I am sitting here in my hotel room in the Quality Inn in Harpers Valley, WV.  Tomorrow I start my hike, but tonight I have laid out all my gear on my bed to check, one last time, that I have forgotten nothing.  
This is a bit of overkill - there are many outfitters along the Appalachian Trail who will be happy to sell me something I have forgotten.  But after all the months of planning, it would be a bummer.
My gear philosophy for this trip is pretty simple:  bring as little as possible.  A reality of my hike is that I need to be much more aware of backpack weight than the 20-somethings speeding by if my joints are going to make it 2000+ miles.  So I have targeted a fully loaded pack, with food and water, of under 20 lbs (is it alliteration if everything starts with a 2?) and a base weight of about 13.  This has taken a bit of research, but I’ve been amazed by the innovations in hiking gear fabric and construction over the past 10 years.  
The conventional wisdom is to divide your hiking gear into 3 piles - things that you must have, things that are nice to have, and things you are not sure about.  You should only take the first pile.  This has forced some hard choices (in all honesty, I caved on a couple of those choices), but I can always adjust later.
I will spare you my detailed gear list at this point.  Nothing is more hilarious than the gear list of someone who has almost no experience with the gear on that list.  However, in a couple of months, if things work out, I will get into specifics.
In the meantime, a couple of general notes:
Big 3 (Shelter, sleeping bag, backpack) - Managing the weight of these items has a big impact on the total pack weight, so I’ve chosen to use cottage manufacturers whose use of advanced fabrics and design have created lightweight and functional gear.  As a general observation, each of these items is ½ the weight compared to what I used when hiking Shenandoah 4 years ago.Seasons - I will be progressing rapidly from high summer (Virginia in August) to fall to winter (Smoky Mountains in November).  While I could carry clothing that would handle all of that, I’ll instead be using maildrops to swap gear in and out to keep my clothing load manageable.Clothing - speaking of clothing, I only have one set of clothing for hiking and one set for sleeping.  That’s it.  This will often mean that I am donning cold, wet clothing in the morning before starting off (better than caffeine for a wakeup call) and will also mean that sometimes others will be able to smell me before they see me.Food and water - these get surprisingly heavy surprisingly fast, and will probably be a huge learning curve for me as I progress.  I will be relying on foods with high calories per oz to keep the food weight down, as I will usually have 3-4 days between resupply points.  Water, which weighs a blistering 2.2 lb per liter (I’ll need 4-6 liters per day), will be obtained from streams, ponds, and stagnant puddles along the hike, filtered or treated to remove the worst of the contaminants.Gun - no, I have not packed a gun.  Along with other principled objections, it would be too heavy and, unfortunately, one can not shoot a tick.  Ticks are what I worry about the most on the trail, so my gear and clothing are treated with permethrin to keep those darlings away.  
Anyway, I am getting ready to stuff it all into my pack for tomorrow.  After traveling here today by car, plane, train, and Uber, I will be walking for the next 3 months.
  I am nervous, a bit terrified, excited!!",,View Entry,"Aug 21, Sun",0
Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656862,"This morning I reported to the ATC Headquarters in Harpers Ferry, WV, where I had my picture taken, pack weighed, and registered as thru-hiker #277 starting from Harpers Ferry. Harpers Ferry is the psychological halfway point along the trail between Springer Mountain in Georgia and Mt Katahdin in Maine (the actual halfway point is some 70-75 miles further north in Pennsylvania).  Most thru-hikers will start at either Springer or Mt Katahdin, most flip floppers (who do the trail in two separate sections) will start at Harpers Ferry.
According to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy (ATC), every year between 3-4,000 hikers attempt a thru-hike; typically only 20-25% finish.  Some leave due to injury or illness, some due to family issues, some due to running out of money, and most of the rest due to the mental challenge of waking up each morning and slogging up and down mountains with a pack on their back while missing home.  Some of these are controllable, and I have done as much as I can to prepare.  Some of them are not.  One can only approach a journey of this length (in 2022, 2194.3 miles) with humility.
Happily, I am still a thru-hiker this evening.  After registering at the ATC, I joined the trail at mile marker 1025.4 and hiked south across the Shenandoah river.  There was a sharp climb up to Loudon Heights, then the trail ran along the ridge for the rest of the day.  When the trail crossed VA 9 at Keys Gap I was able to detour a short way down the road to a gas station/convenience store to grab lunch, then relaxed in the shade by a very pretty pond. This idyll was interrupted by a low roll of thunder, and within an hour I was completely soaked and hiking down a trail that had turned into a river. And then - as if Mother Nature regretted her temper tantrum - the sun was back out. 
I had originally planned a 9 mile day and stopped at my target, the David Lesser shelter. This shelter is very impressive, with a separate picnic pavilion and porch swings, and was in beautiful shape. But the shelter was empty and I was feeling good, so I kept on hiking to the Blackburn AT Center. It was a very steep 0.2 mi down from the trail, but what a find!  There is a bunkhouse, a screened in porch, potable water from a spigot, and a sun shower. A 5 star stop. There were 7 other hikers from 2 groups also spending the night.  
Total miles for the day were 11.9 (trail miles…I walked additional miles to the ATC HQ, deli, and down to the shelter). Many thru-hikers average 15-20 miles per day over the course of their hike.  I’m targeting 12, but most guides suggest starting off the first few weeks at 8-10 miles per day until your body adjusts to the demands. I will be throttling back for the next couple of days as the terrain gets tougher. 
Dinner was dehydrated Pad Thai with Chicken. Don’t laugh - it was great.

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656864,"Last night I slept on the screened in porch of the Blackburn ATC center. Too keyed up to fall asleep, I listened to the rustle of the wind, the occasional spatter of rain and thunder, and a chorus of crickets that required earplugs. 
My goal is to get on the trail relatively early each morning to get in as many miles as possible before the summer heat becomes oppressive. Today I set off at 7:30, later than I wanted but early enough to be dazzled by the fingers of sunlight breaking through the mist of the forest. It turned out to be a picture perfect day for hiking with several long views of the Shenandoah Valley, birdsong from wrens and titmouses (I have a great app for identifying bird calls), and a number of day hikers. I also got to see my first copperhead snake, a baby only a foot long in the middle of the trail. Where was its mother?  I didn’t hang around to find out. 
The trail itself followed a ridge for 4-5 miles, then went through 3-4 stiff ups and downs. However, today was a short day so I was able to get to my destination, Bears Den hostel, by 1  and beat the heat. 
Starting in late August in the South East seems crazy, but there are some good reasons. Starting later would push my Georgia finish into December, a tricky time in terms of potential snowfall (particularly in the Smoky Mountains). Starting earlier reduces the amount of time I have next summer to get to Katahdin if I want to stay within a 12 month window. 
Bears Den hostel is a signature stop along the AT.   A historic 1930’s stone mansion sitting on 66 acres, it offers a snug place for long-distance hikers to stay only 150 yards from the trail.  It is positioned near the start of the infamous “Roller Coaster” (more on that tomorrow), but perhaps is best known within thru-hiker circles for its amazing deal - a bunk, shower, laundry, pizza, and pint of Ben & Jerry’s for $35.  
There are 4 typical kinds of accommodation for hikers on the Appalachian Trail:
Shelters, usually 3 sided, which are distributed every 5-15 miles from Georgia to Maine.  There are approximately 260 of these, some comfortable, some in need of repair.  They typically sleep 6-12, are situated next to water sources and often (but not always) have privies nearby.Tents or hammocks.  Virtually all long distance hikers carry a tent or hammock.  Most will tent or hammock near a shelter (water and privy access, more social experience), but often hikers “stealth” camp at unestablished sites along the trail if a shelter is not convenient.  Hostels, which are primarily geared for hikers with bunks, laundry and shower facilities, and access to food resupply options.  Some are palatial, some are grubby.  In general, though, the owners work incredibly hard to provide for the needs of exhausted and hungry hikers.Hotels, primarily in larger towns.  This is less common (expensive and, frankly, not many hotels welcome a dirty hiker that hasn’t showered in 5 days with open arms).
I will primarily be using my tent or staying in a hostel on this trip, with a couple of splurges.  
Looking forward to tomorrow!","Blackburn ATC Center, 1013.5

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656956,"Well.  
The choice to start my thru-hike in Harpers Ferry was made deliberately for several reasons.  One of the most important is that it is a bit of a “Goldilocks” section: not too steep, not too rocky, and a much gentler start to the trail than starting in either the mountains of Georgia or Maine/NH, and I hoped that it would give me a chance to build up my “trail legs” on some of the easier trail.
There is one well-known exception - the “Roller Coaster” is a rocky stretch of trail that rapidly climbs and falls multiple times over 13.5 miles.  And I got to ride it today.  
I am happy to report that I didn’t crash, although the last two hills required an upbeat playlist for extra energy, and I certainly didn’t set any speed records, as the rocks in many places were tricky to pick through. 
  
I am reliably informed that the alternative to the route that the Roller Coaster follows would have been 8 miles of road walking (AT route design is often determined by what land is available, rather than the easiest route), so I am grateful for the path through the woods. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that this was all some elaborate hazing ritual by the PATC (Potomac Appalachian Trail Club) and that somewhere, just out of sight, was the secret, smooth, gently rolling version. Perhaps one day I will learn the secret handshake. 
Many thruhikers start the AT with little to no physical preparation, and it is generally held that you can only learn to hike the AT by hiking the AT. Within 3-4 weeks you build the required stamina and strength, gaining those “trail legs”.  What goes unsaid is that those first 3-4 weeks are pretty tough, and a lot of the thruhiker fallout occurs early on. 
After a 10 day stint on the AT hiking Shenandoah Park several years ago (where I had increased my workout routine slightly, but obviously not enough), I determined to be more deliberate about getting into hiking shape. With the help of an incline treadmill (“Climb to Everest Base Camp!” “Climb Mt Kilimanjaro!”) I’ve been able to lower my resting heartbeat from the mid-50’s to the mid-40’s over the past 4 months.   I also ran (to strengthen my joints) and hiked 8-10 miles 2X per week.  
All of that helped today, and I am feeling strong. But the incline treadmill really helped me internalize elevation gain and % inclines 
So - I was going to write an ode to the treadmill. But an ode is at least 3 stanzas, which was hard to keep in my mind while I was hiking today. But I was able to do 17 syllables, so I am afraid you will get a haiku instead. 
Incline Treadmill Haiku
Sweat falls and thighs burn
Treadmill belt to forest trail
Up, up, up, up, up. 
That last part was pretty easy to remember while I was hiking, lol. This is why I became an engineer, not an English major. I promise that is the last creative writing effort this trip. ;)
I stopped today at Rod Hollow shelter and put my tent up for the first time. Later in the afternoon, Goose and Gander came in. I had first seen them at the ATC HQ in Harpers Ferry, where they were taking a zero day after flipping down from Maine (having started NOBO from HF in early May). They will be following the same path as me but, with more than 1200 miles under their belts, are likely to speed out of view tomorrow. 
I am now cozily ensconced in my tent, which is very snug!  I think I will sleep well tonight after today’s efforts.","Bears Den Hostel, VA 1005.5

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656990,"The iconic emblem of the Appalachian Trail is the white blaze, which marks the trail from Springer Mountain in GA to Mt Katahdin in Maine.  At almost any point, you can look in front or behind you and spot a white blaze.  Blue blazes are used to denote side trails - to shelters, viewpoints, parking lots, etc. 
Within thruhiker lingo, there are other forms of blazing as well. The ones I am aware of:
Aqua blazing - doing part of the trail by canoe or raft. This is most popular in Shenandoah Park (though frowned on by purists). Yellow blazing - skipping part of the trail by either road walking around the tricky bits or skipping ahead by car or shuttle. Also frowned on by purists. Pink blazing - pacing your hike to the speed and location of a possible romantic interest. A step below stalking, but creepy. Frowned on by everyone. 
There is also one more - silver blazing - which is what I did unwittingly today.   Particularly in Virginia, spiders are unusually industrious at night, spinning webs across the trail where the vegetation comes close.  The first hiker in the morning to go through “silver blazes” for other hikers by knocking down all those webs. 
When I hiked with my daughter several years ago, she was generally in front (something about protecting me from bears) and my trusty wingwoman handled this. I had forgotten, and so was the first one on the trail this morning while my shelter mates sipped their coffee and looked very satisfied. 
Ugh. I must have run into 15 webs. The webs in your hair are one thing, but a spider is generally attached to the web and I did the spider-off dance multiple times. It is difficult to both watch your feet while walking on a rocky trail and look up to watch for webs at the same time. 
I did spot several webs before I hit them, slashing them with my trekking pole and humming “Another one bites the dust” under my breath, but it was a long 4 miles before I got on a busier trail that someone else had cleared. 
Today’s hike was back on the “Goldilocks” level - not too difficult. There were several climbs, but nothing to match the Roller Coaster from yesterday. The trail made its way through Sky Meadows State Park, which had (surprise, surprise) several lovely meadows filled with thistle and golden-rod. I arrived at my target destination, Whiskey Hollow Shelter, by lunchtime. Still feeling good, after lunch I pushed on to Manassas Gap Shelter.  Dinner was dehydrated Mushroom Risotto, which really hit the spot. 
Tomorrow I am aiming for a shower, laundry, and a bed at a hostel in Front Royal. I can hardly wait.","Rod Hollow Shelter, VA 995.7

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657109,"Last night at Manassas Gap shelter was my first solo night, with no one else coming in. Of course if you count the 1000 crickets crooning in the background, I was hardly alone.   My tent is working out great so far and, honestly, when inside it it feels like I am in my castle. 
I packed up this morning and headed out on great trail to Front Royal. It has been a hot summer in Virginia, so the trail water sources are drying up. This means carrying more water at a time (heavy!) plus being ready to scoop up water at any small stream you cross. 
Avoiding waterborne illnesses is a key requirement of a successful thruhike; for convenience I carry two forms of water treatment. Like many thruhikers, I use a water filter that can scoop up water and filter it on demand. See the stream, scoop the water into the water bottle or bladder, squeeze it and drink. However, the squeezing gets tedious for large quantities, so I use chlorine dioxide drops at camp.  
But you can only treat water that you can find, so I spend time each morning mapping out water sources, checking the Far Out guide for up to date flow reports, and figuring out how much to carry.  Keeping well hydrated is a consistent focus. 
This section of trail passed through some beautiful meadows (with a bench!) and passed by the Jim and Molly Denton shelter, a 5 star affair as shelters go, with a solar shower, horseshoe pit, and patio chairs. 
My destination for tonight, though, was Mountain Home B&B, only 100 yards from the trail. Run by former hikers in a restored 1847 home (an ongoing project), this is a wonderful waypoint on my way south. I arrived one day earlier than expected, but they graciously found me a bed. I showered, got laundry done, and felt like a new person. 
Mountain Home was packed today, a bit disorienting after last night’s solo tent stay. I ran into Gander and Goose again, and we headed into town for dinner.   I will enter Shenandoah Park tomorrow.","Manassas Gap shelter, VA 982.7

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657110,"Today was my first (return) foray into Shenandoah Park. I did a “reverse slack pack”, dropped off further south and hiking back north to my bed and breakfast with a lighter pack.  As I had originally reserved this second night at Mountain Home, I didn’t want to leave them hanging when my plans changed - the small businesses up and down the trail need to be respected to preserve the ecosystem that makes the AT work. 
As it was a weekend, there were many day hikers and it was a very social day. I chatted to one hiker about the geological significance of a basalt outcropping (I won’t say more about this, but it was pretty cool), explained to another pair what thruhikers were, offered antibiotic ointment and bandaids to a gentleman who had slipped on the rocks, and encouraged a woman making her first day hike since her knee operation.  The weather was beautiful and everyone was happy to be out on the trail. 
However, the highlight of the day was bumping into Jim and Carol, trail maintainers for the PATC.  They were out on their own time on a weekend to build a new bench by a spring, using close by blowdowns as material. 
The ATC is powered by volunteers - picking up trash, clearing blowdowns, identifying and creating new trail segments, maintaining shelters. My last week has been hiked on pristine trail, and I am so grateful for the work they do. Everyone needs to find a way to give back, and these volunteers have combined their love of the outdoors with a commitment to the AT mission. 
Anyway, despite my distractions, they were able to complete the bench in a very short period of time. Kudos.","US 522/Front Royal, VA 972.3

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657196,"Today’s 13 mile stint took me up and over Hogback and Pass Mountains. Starting yesterday, with Mt Marshall, the trail is hitting its first 3000 ft mountains since Massachusetts going SOBO, a distance of almost 600 miles. The terrain will gradually rise in elevation from here onwards, reaching north of 6000 ft in NC/TN. 
I am finding that 12-13 mpd is my current achievable (if not wholly comfortable) pace with a normal elevation gain of 2500-2800 feet. But the variability in trail quality (smooth and graded vs rocky) has a big impact on my speed, as rocks, particularly downhill, need to be negotiated carefully.   Unfortunately, while there is great data on distance and elevation change, information on trail character only passes by word of mouth, so each day is a bit of an unknown quantity when setting out. 
Today was average rockiness, but had a treat in the middle - the Elkwallow Wayside. Perched along Skyline drive, which runs through Shenandoah Park, are 3-4 “Waysides” which offer car trippers a grill, camp store, and picnic tables. These are goldmines for hungry hikers, and I took full advantage for today’s lunch, as the AT runs within 100 yards of Elkwallow. I was even able to enjoy one of their signature blackberry shakes!
Skyline Drive, constructed in the 1930’s, was highly controversial, cutting the trail in many places (within the park one can cross Skyline Drive 4-5 times in a day) to be able to provide access for urban dwellers to enjoy the Park’s resources. The tension remains between those who want to preserve the pristine wilderness of the AT corridor and those who want to increase access for everyone to enjoy it. Finding a creative blend between stewardship and access is a worthy challenge for the Appalachian Trail Conservancy as it approaches its 100th year. 
Tonight there was one other thruhiker in camp, a SOBO (started in Maine). His pace is fast enough (20-25 mpd) that he has outrun many of the other SOBO’s, so he is not currently in a group. He’ll speed ahead of me tomorrow; I hope he finds a good crew as he proceeds south.   It was a hot and sticky night, and we were serenaded by the howl of coyotes.","Gravel Springs Gap, VA 958.8

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657221,"Oof.  Climbed 3 mountains today (Mary’s Rock, The Pinnacle, and Stony Man), increasing my daily elevation gain, and I can feel it!  The Appalachian Trail has more than 464,000 feet of elevation change, the equivalent of climbing Mt Everest 16 times. I have barely scratched the surface. The party really starts in a couple of weeks. Hopefully I will pick up my trail legs by then. 
The trail was very quiet today, but I was treated to beautiful (although slightly misty) vistas of the Shenandoah Valley at each peak.  Tonight I am staying at Big Meadows Lodge, one of two lodges in Shenandoah National Park. The room is pretty basic, but luxurious compared to my tent. My shower felt great!
Some of you have asked about food on the trail. Here is a typical day’s menu:
Breakfast - oatmeal or granola with added nuts and dried fruit to boost the protein and calorie content, plus a chai tea mix (tea bags are less preferred because I need to carry out all waste, and wet tea bags are relatively heavy). 
Snacks - 2 morning snacks and 1 afternoon snack, targeting 200 calories each plus a 3:1 carb to protein ratio. Examples: trail mix, Clif nut butter bars, peanut m&m’s, macadamia nuts plus dried mango strips, etc. Limited chocolate right now because it is hot and melted chocolate is a mess. 
Lunch - PB and honey, salami and cheese, or tuna fish salad on a flour tortilla
Recovery drink - protein powder plus glucose immediately post hike
Dinner - dehydrated meal from one of the major hiking meal manufacturers (Mountain House, Good to Go, Peak refuel, etc). I am typically eating half a packet, expect to ramp up to a full packet later in the trip. Optional addins are olive oil, cheese, hot sauce. 
I am continually balancing total caloric requirement, which gives me energy, total protein which helps to repair and build muscles, and weight/bulk. 
Of course, town/restaurant visits provide a great opportunity to catch up. Tonight I demolished a plate of osso buco and cheese grits with a blackberry cobbler dessert. Yum!","Pass Mountain Hut, Shenandoah National Park VA 945.5

I have been pretty fortunate so far, making many minor mistakes but no colossal ones. Learning each day. 
I traveled 14 miles, aided by a lighter pack as I am staying at Big Meadows Lodge for 2 nights and slackpacked today. The path was well groomed, with the exception of my first encounter with scree. 
Scree: [noun] an accumulation of loose stones or rocky debris lying on a slope or at the base of a hill or cliff : talus
The picture above shows the “trail” through a patch of scree - lots of rocks waiting to reach up and grab your toes and ankles. Fortunately, today’s sections were relatively short, although I understand that this will be a common feature in some sections. 
There were more  beautiful views of the Shenandoah valley along the way; one can almost become jaded after a while. Fortunately, many of the views are available without leaving the trail at all, a real consideration when one has a long day. 
I have been very lucky with weather so far, but got caught in a brief squall at the end of my hike.

I am sitting now on top of Hightop Mountain after a strong push to get up here on my hike today. The view faces directly west, and sits about 0.5 miles up from Hightop Hut. Two hawks have been soaring by on the air currents.
I was joined briefly by a freshman group from Washington & Lee on a pre-orientation trip. I was reminded of my own freshman trip (last century) and the enduring friendships formed. I hope they are as lucky. 
Hiking felt good today, but the focus on water continues. A picnic site that I had been counting on for a refill had all of its spigots turned off due to the low water situation in this area. Fortunately there was a ranger station 3 miles later and they were happy to let me fill up. 
There are some great stealth camping spots up here where I will spend the night, as I want to see the sun set but don’t want to have to night hike down to the hut. It is my first chance on this trip to do my own bear hang (I have been hanging my food on the shelter-provided poles) and I am trying a PCT hang this time. It is a bit more secure than the technique I was using before, but a clever bear could still potentially get it. While I have seen no bears so far, I will switch to a more robust bear resistant container when I reach Waynesboro in a couple of days.

Good thing, because today was a relatively challenging day for me with a 15 mile carry and 3300ft of elevation gain (an average day for a typical thruhiker). Shenandoah shelters are sometimes at awkward distances, so there was no convenient shelter in the 11-13 mile range.  There was one at 9 miles, but there was a campground, with a **shower** at 15 miles, so I put in the effort. 
I still haven’t seen a bear, but ran into a number of smaller creatures today that kept me entertained. The swallowtails clustered on the purple thistle were particularly pretty, and the fishing spider on the shelter ceiling particularly creepy.

Today was a short and easy day, only 7 miles with limited elevation gain to Blackrock hut. The next hut is 13 miles away and the next water is 11 miles. I am not strong enough to do a 20 mile day, particularly lugging an extra 5 lbs of water. I am also trying to avoid the “too hard, too fast, too early” trap that seems to sucker punch newbie thruhikers. 
However, today was notable for being my first trail magic!  Trail magic on the AT takes many forms: barbecues at trailheads, lifts for hikers from trailheads to town, caching extra water at known dry points. It is most prevalent around the NOBO bubble, which passed through here 6-8 weeks ago. I had no expectations for trail magic on this year’s SOBO segment. 
But, while passing a group of 6 day hikers, one of them stopped me to ask if I was a thru-hiker. On receiving the affirmative, he asked if I wanted a Snickers bar. 
A small tangent on Snickers bars. Snickers appear to be at the base of the thru-hikers food pyramid, along with peanut butter and ramen noodles. A bar has nuts (protein), fat and carbohydrates, and seems to be code for “reasonably balanced treat that you can’t eat in real life but is guilt free when you are expending so many calories hiking”.  They are extremely popular for thruhikers, who are usually in calorie deficit. 
Of course, I could only say yes (remember my resupply situation from yesterday). He whipped out a bag from his backpack. Turns out he was a thruhiker 10-11 years ago, and still likes to occasionally dayhike. We reminisced for a couple of minutes and I moved on, but not before he shared that his trail name had been “Old Fat Guy”, given to him by his kids. 
The encounter (and the Snickers) really lifted my spirits for the rest of the day!
I also ran into a “ridge runner” hired by the local Appalachian Trail club to hike up and down the trail talking to and educating hikers. His trail name is “Tiny Ponies”, but there was nothing tiny about him. We chatted briefly about my tent, which he spotted in my pack (it is a bit of a fad at the moment) and then he headed off. 
It looks like it is going to be a quiet night. Gearing up for tomorrow’s big water carry!","Loft Mountain Campground, SNP, VA 892.2

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657423,"Today was all about water.  It was 13 miles from Blackrock hut to Calf Mountain shelter with no water source. I consume about ¼ liter per mile, so in theory should have been carrying 3-¼ liters (7 lbs). Instead I “cameled up” (drank a lot before I started out) and carried 2-½ liters. 
The good news?  My pack got lighter as the day progressed. The bad news?  It was 83% humidity today, so I was perspiring at a rapid rate. Fortunately I am carrying electrolyte tablets and they helped a lot. I walked into the shelter with ¼ liter to spare.   Other hikers shared similar stories. 
This was the longest waterless section for me to date. It really doesn’t compare with some of the very long waterless sections on the PCT, but was a new experience for me. 
Today’s hike was the first in the park with no real views. It was a great opportunity to catch up on some audiobooks as the miles clicked by. There were many Labor Day hikers out, so it was also nice to chat with them in passing. 
Calf Mountain shelter was a good stop. It sparked memories of my trip with my oldest daughter 4 years ago (it was our very first night), and the other inhabitants, Lost and Found and Cardiac, were excellent company. 
This is my last night in Shenandoah National Park. Tomorrow I will continue hiking south into Virginia.","Blackrock Hut, SNP VA 884.9

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657553,"I hiked out of the Shenandoah National Park today, from last night’s shelter at Calf Mountain to Rockfish Gap (SNP entrance point) and then onwards to Humpback Gap.  Having hiked the SNP 4 years ago, it has been a known entity to me, with the added benefits of a fairly well maintained trail and a number of food supply locations.  That changes now as I enter an unfamiliar part of the trail that begins the increase in difficulty to the end.  I suspect I will look back on this section, with its comparative ease and sunny weather, as the “vacation” portion of my hike.
The hike itself was typical of previous days.  I noticed that again there was relatively little birdsong, and hope that picks up as I progress.  I passed the remains of a small homestead and rustic cemetery (with small slate unmarked tombstones) that were a poignant reminder of the families that settled and worked to make a living in a difficult environment.
There was one humorous incident when I stopped for a break at a shelter where a clean cut family of  dayhikers was eating lunch at the picnic table.  I sauntered in, smelly, dirty, and sweaty - their hastily concealed reaction to sharing the same space with me was evident.  They had a number of polite, slightly incredulous questions about thru-hikers…I am not sure I made any converts.
I was able to put together my longest stretch of mileage today, aided by an almost-empty food bag that lightened my load.  I was picked up at the endpoint by “Listener”, the shuttle driver for my hostel tonight.  Listener is a ‘22 thruhiker who threw out his knee about half-way through his hike, and is remaining in the Waynesboro area while it heals.  He was enjoyable to chat with and a great driver.
I am staying at the hostel overnight, grabbing a shower and laundry before heading out again tomorrow.  During the peak of the NOBO bubble, the hostel swells to handle up to 50 hikers at one time.  Tonight there are only about 5.
Since I am leaving the territory of the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club today, I want to express my sincere thanks for the outstanding trail and shelter maintenance throughout their section.  Great job!","Calf Mountain Shelter VA 871.9

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657554,"The morning dawned misty after considerable rain the prior night.  I decided to reverse my route for the day, starting further south and hiking back north, so I could tackle a tricky bit of rocks first thing while I was fresh.  The shuttle driver dropped me off at Reid’s Gap and off I went back to my finish point from yesterday, Humpback Rocks.
Hikers talk a lot about gear, but the gear I hear most about is footwear.  The AT is approximately 5 million steps - I am currently averaging about 27,000 per day. Foot related issues (blisters, lost toenails) and injuries from slips, trips, and falls are a major concern, so most thruhikers give a lot of thought to shoes (boots vs trail runners, heel to toe drop, stack height, toe box width), insoles (arch support, flexibility, heel stability) and socks (height, material, thickness, layers).  This is complicated by the fact that shoes typically last only 300-500 miles plus hikers’ feet expand in size, sometimes up up to 2 shoe sizes, over the course of their hike.
I spent a reasonable amount of time tweaking my setup, and ended up with zero drop trail runners with moderate cushioning (Altra Timps), Superfeet trail insoles, and low cut merino wool socks. The trail runners are lighter and dry faster, and I feel like I have more ankle stability than I do with boots because my heel sits lower.  The only downside is that, while these shoes have great grip on dry rock, they do not hold well on wet, lichen covered rocks….which is what I started out with today.
There were a number of rock falls to be crossed over the first 4 hours this morning, with large flat rocks at angles.  An early slip and fall reminded me of the importance of judging those angles very carefully, as well as the need to deploy my trekking poles adroitly.  
I had heard, and can absolutely attest to the truth of, that hikers on the AT develop 5 foot tunnel vision, with a singular focus on watching where and how they place each foot.  Each of the 5 million steps has the potential to end a hike.  I am sure that this skill will become second nature over time, but for now it has a real impact on my speed of forward progress.
As I was going in the reverse direction today, I crossed paths with a couple of hikers I had seen at previous shelters and we stopped to chat.  The day finished with a brief sprinkling of rain - I am happy that tomorrow is a day off so that I can dry out.
Dinner was a special affair tonight as one of the hikers at the hostel had just finished her AT thru-hike (she had to finish a stretch of trail that ended at the hostel).  A group went out to dinner at The River Burger bar in Waynesboro to celebrate.  I am starting to see more SOBO and flip flop hikers catch up.  All of them have already hiked the toughest parts of the trail (NH/ME), so are strong and confident about their southern half.  I enjoyed their stories over dinner.","Humpback Gap, VA. 856.8

Zero day - a day with no hiking at all, typically in a town and as part of a resupply visit (can also occur due to bad weather conditions or illness/injury)
Nero day - a low mileage day, typically from the trail to town for resupply or from town to the trail.
Today I had a zero day in Waynesboro, my first of the trip, at a very nice bed and breakfast.  I am using it to restock/resupply (my trusty spouse had sent a mail drop), catch up on some business commitments, and eat normal food.  I stepped on a scale yesterday and discovered that I had lost 10 pounds in two weeks.  This is a slightly unwelcome surprise - while delighted to tone up in general, I need to make sure that I do not lose weight at a rate that will cause me to lose energy.  So I am compensating today.  :).

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657697,"The day dawned misty but dry and my Uber driver dropped me off at Reid’s Gap at 7:45am following my zero day.  My gear was clean and my pack reloaded with the food I need for the next section. 
The day involved a climb up Three Ridges mountain and a long, steep and rocky descent that had received some shade from other hikers. I had planned a shorter mileage day to leave myself the opportunity to take my time on the way down, but still needed to be focused as there was rain in the forecast. 
Happily, the conditions were perfect for the descent. The rocks were dry and the ground just damp enough to provide traction for poles and shoes. I made it down to Harper Creek shelter for lunch, through the worst of the rocks, without incident. Three other thruhikers (Float, Trailmix, and Early Bird) were there as well. One of the hikers had his pole fail on the descent and had tumbled partly down the hill, twisting his ankle, but was shaking it off as I arrived. 
The rain, which had held off for our descent, gave a 1 hour burst, during which we hung out at the shelter and rested. Once it eased, we all set off again. They pushed on to the Priest shelter (experienced hikers, this would give them more than 5000 feet of elevation gain for the day). I settled for another 90 minutes down to a stealth tent site next to the Tye River, which was beautiful.   I had no sooner set up my tent there than it started to rain again, and continued on and off for the rest of the night. 
The tent I am using is a 2 person trekking pole tent that uses dyneema cuben fiber (DCF) for its material. It was eye wateringly expensive but is remarkably light (21 oz). I have been very happy with it so far, but this was the first real test of its storm worthiness. It passed like a champ and kept me dry throughout the night.

Warm cup of tea - soothing

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657698,"Today was a big day for me.  When I was planning this trip, I knew that there was a Day 3 challenge (the Roller Coaster), a Week 3 challenge (The Priest), and a Month 3 challenge (the Smoky Mountains, more on that another time). Today was climbing the Priest Mountain, an elevation gain of 3200 feet in 4 miles (and a total day of 4700 feet in 12 miles). My previous highs had been a max of 1200 feet in one climb and 3200 feet in one day. 

Bridge to the start of The Priest climbI am happy to report my trail legs reported for duty, and not a day too soon. Like the Roller Coaster, I did not set any speed records. By pacing myself slowly up the mountain I was able to complete the climb by 10:30, then take my time on the rest of the hike. Tired at the end, to be sure, but I do not expect any soreness tomorrow. 
I did stop off at The Priest shelter, which is famous for its logbook in which hikers write their (often very entertaining) confessions. Unfortunately, the logbook was missing, so I did not get any more insight into my fellow travelers. 
I finished off at Seeley-Wordsworth shelter, where Float (a flip flopper who I had met previously) was already ensconced for the evening. We chatted briefly as I ran through my evening camp chores, then both headed off for early nights. 
I feel both relieved and excited about future sections.","Tye River stealth site, VA 834.5

The sun shone, but temperatures were mild.  I was heading towards the junction with US 60, with the objective of catching a shuttle into Lexington, VA to meet up with my husband. Float was also heading for US 60 to meet up with his wife, so we hiked together the majority of the day. 
The trail was well groomed and relatively easy compared to prior days, and we made good time, covering the 14 miles in 6 hours. The woods were dappled with sunlight and we also crossed through some lovely meadows. 
We ran into volunteers from the local ATC club who were weed whacking a portion of the trail that had become overgrown, which was a big improvement.  We stopped and chatted a bit to thank them for their efforts. 
A big surprise came when we emerged from the trail to discover Gangster, NOBO 21, with a cooler of beer and sparkling water offering trail magic. We accepted the drinks with gratitude. While this can be a common experience for NOBO’s, it is unusual this time of year in the South… which made it all the sweeter. 
The shuttle driver whizzed me into Lexington, which is a charming small town the boasts both Washington & Lee and VMI. My husband and I had a lovely dinner (he actually let me choose all the items!) and we caught up on 3 weeks of domestic details. He is handling a lot in my absence and I am so grateful for his support on yet another one of my wild hare adventures. Over 40 years there have been many.

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657771,"The forecast for the next 3 days was for rain and, sure enough, at 11:30 it started up.  I am now sitting in the Punchbowl shelter, which appears fairly weather worthy, watching the storm continue. I will sleep in the shelter instead of my tent tonight - setting up a tent in the rain is not high on my personal list if I can avoid it. It is a classic 3 sided lean-to that can sleep up to 6 hikers and 4 of us have arrived, wet and cold. 
The hike itself was downhill/flat for the first 8 miles, running along Brown Mountain Creek. There was a section that showed remnants of a farm community that was composed of freed slaves, who were sharecroppers of tobacco, oats, wheat and corn.  It would not have been an easy life - the land was sharply sloped and very rocky, with ¼-½ of the crop proceeds due to the landlord.   The community was disbanded in the 1920’s when the US Forest Service acquired the land. 
All of today’s elevation came at the end (not a desirable combination), so I was very glad to see the shelter sign. I will finish climbing Bluff Mountain tomorrow (in the rain)  before descending into Glasgow. 
There is a classic thru-hiker saying, “No rain, no pain, no Maine”.  After the first two weeks of great and sunny weather, I am now learning how to adapt to a much damper expression of Mother Nature’s moods.","Buena Vista/US 60, VA 809.1

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657775,"Well, it poured last night. The rain did not ease until 5 or 6 in the morning. One key thing I had learned in researching this hike was the importance of keeping a dry set of clothes for sleeping, and it saved my bacon last night.  My hiking clothes were soaked , and there was just enough chill in the air that it would have been pretty uncomfortable. Instead, with the thrum of the rain on the roof, in dry sleep clothes, and (happily) no snorers in the shelter, I slept pretty well. 
I headed out at 7:30, aiming for the James River bridge and the town of Glasgow, with the plan to stay at Stanimal’s hostel. It was still drizzling, but it kept the temperatures cool - and since I had put on my wet hiking clothes this morning, it didn’t really matter. Views were non-existent as I summited Bluff Mountain, but I noticed that, at elevation, leaves are starting to turn. I am really looking forward to fall foliage in a couple of weeks.  Of course, that will also mean cooler weather - so I will be supplementing my gear with some warmer clothing in a week. 
I am at the hostel now. By this point, I know/recognize many of the hikers here as we are all traveling in roughly the same 30 mile window. They are all faster than I am, but I am trying to take fewer zeros, so I periodically catch up. The hostel has all the fixings - a shoe dryer, a hiker fridge, a massage chair, and pancakes for breakfast.  Charlie, who has managed the hostel for the past couple of years, really understands hikers and what they need.

I am finding that strategically slackpacking is helping me to maintain miles and manage weather. I will probably do this about 1/week for the rest of this fall. 
The hike itself was pleasant, if slightly buggy. It was also viewless - the cloud cover hung low in the valley, so while I was above it hiking in the sunshine, I could only see clouds at the viewpoints.   The trail itself was well graded. I passed Beer Girl on the way, climbing out of Glasgow.  Although it was sunny, the ground was wet. I am paying special attention to my feet these days - if feet stay wet too long, the skin starts breaking down, with painful cracks and blisters. I try to take shoes and socks off every 6-7 miles to air out at a break, then make sure they are dried at the end of the day. I have been lucky so far. 
The hike finished by crossing the James River on the James River Foot Bridge (a footbridge, but actually named after William Foot), 623’ in length.  This is the longest footbridge on the AT. There is a tradition of thru-hikers jumping off the bridge into the river below - but it is highly discouraged by the authorities, and there was no action today. 
The evening back at the hostel was fairly convivial, with Manchego, Living Proof, All is Good, Not Yet and I all huddled over Charlie’s dessert, a warm blueberry cinnamon sheet cake with vanilla ice cream.

It was cool up on the ridge and there were a couple of lovely meadows, and the light filtered appealingly through the forested sections.There were dense stands of rhododendrons that reminded me of those surrounding my childhood home, where we used to play hide and seek - they must be spectacular in bloom. I also passed through one geological feature akin to a Sword of Damocles, with a rock caught between two stone pillars. Of course the trail passed underneath!

At one such overlook, Harvey’s Knob, I had another trail magic opportunity from Allen, an avid bird watcher. Apparently, over the next 2 weeks there is a major migration of hawks through this portion of VA. Harvey’s Knob commands almost a 360 degree view, and a hardy band of watchers gathers each year to count the hawks as they go by. I spotted a couple soaring in the breeze while there. Allen has outfitted his truck to also offer trail magic (including cooked meals) to hikers as they cross through. 
I had decided to head into Daleville for the night to get a jump on my resupply (a major one). I will return to the same place I finished tomorrow and finish my hike into Daleville. My shuttle driver, Homer, regaled me with tales of his thru-hike with his wife and 2 children (11 and 8) in 2002. Amazing to think of those kids hiking 2000+ miles. Homer and his family now look after 16 shelters in this part of VA, a monumental task. Talk about giving back!
One of my tasks during my upcoming resupply is to add blaze orange items to my kit. Hunting is permitted on more than 1250 of the AT’s 2200 miles, and autumn is an active period - but each state has different seasons. For example, here are the deer seasons for the 4 states I will be in over the next 8 weeks (dates are last year’s, but representative):
Virginia: Oct 2 - Jan 1
Tennessee: Aug 27 - Jan 9

It has great BBQ and Mexican restaurants, a Kroger, an outfitter, and several inexpensive hotels.  
The shelters along this section show evidence of being well maintained by Homer and his family, and the trail was generally well graded (although with a couple of steep sections to keep me honest).  Views were significantly fewer than yesterday as I worked my way down in elevation. Interestingly, the last 2-½ miles had a signpost that noted that the AT trail corridor was particularly narrow at that point, urging hikers to keep to the trail. As I have mentioned before, parts of the AT are a patchwork, particularly in the valleys. This appears to be one such patch. 
The excitement for the day was when one of my 25,000 steps almost landed on top of a 4 foot timber rattlesnake snoozing in the middle of the trail. This is the first time I have seen one live - but the rattle was unmistakable. I gave it a wide berth. 
I ran into Float about 5 miles from Daleville and we hiked together for a while. He has been nursing an injured ankle - otherwise he would be several days ahead of me by now.  With more than 1400 miles under his belt, he has given me some great tips.

I woke up early, so was on the trail at first light leaving Daleville and heading south towards the Triple Crown. An early mist kept the temperature cool but highlighted the spider webs across the trail. While it fogged out some of the early views, by the time I reached Tinker Cliffs the mist had burned off and a 180 degree view of the valley spread out before me as I munched on my lunch. 
 
One of the things I particularly enjoyed was the number of large boulders at improbable angles and heights through the first half of the day, like a giant had been playing with building blocks. As the weather was dry, these were fun to scramble up and over. 
It was a long, steep day (for me), but I am increasingly confident with 14-15 mile days. I can’t always hit that target because of shelter/water spacing and elevation changes, but I am revising my future plans a bit. It is nice to have greater flexibility in range.

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658090,"Crazy day, wonderful hike. I set off from camp 45 minutes before sunrise, my first night hiking, to climb the last 0.7 mile from the shelter to McAfee Knob. It was a steep hike, but I took it slow and got there in plenty of time. (I had a great headlamp, an investment after I got lost in the dark on a previous hike with a weak headlamp). 
I was not alone when I reached the top. There were approximately 10 section and thru hikers all gathered for the sunrise, and we were not disappointed.   McAfee Knob’s view of the valley below is iconic, and the color palette of the sky was rich and textured.  I heated up some tea at the top of the cliff and enjoyed. 
 After that climactic start to my day, I had to choose whether to go 10 miles or 17 for the rest of the day’s hike. The original plan had been 10 - but with the early start that would have put me into camp at lunchtime, with nothing to do for 8-9 hours. So instead, I put on my big girl panties and decided to go up and over Dragon’s Tooth, the 3rd of the triple crown features.   Dragon Tooth’s climb has a bit of a reputation because it involves some almost-technical rock scrambling for the last half mile or so of the route. Better, I thought, to do this on a weekend when there were plenty of day hikers to pick up the pieces if I had a problem. 
I did pass many day and section hikers today - the beautiful weather and this particularly scenic area being major attractions. One couple I met,  Frodo and Misdirection, had met each other when they thruhiker in 2021, and were returning to capture the missed McAfee sunrise. 
The climb up Dragon’s Tooth was indeed tough (see the arrows for the “trail” in the picture), and I stowed my trekking poles for the last bit because I needed to use my hands to pull up and over some of the ledges and rebar. But I had a blast. The dry rock was very grippy and I felt confident scrambling up. 
 Dragon’s Tooth itself is a large monolith on top of Cove Mountain, with yet another great view. There were many day hikers, some with dogs (!) who were doing the climb. I ended up giving my remaining water to two dogs whose owners had failed to bring water on the hike (expecting water fountains at the top?), so by the time I dragged myself into camp 4 miles later I was tired, hungry, and thirsty. 
At the shelter were 3 siblings - 74, 69, and 65 - out to do a section hike. The youngest was learning the ropes from her two older brothers….it was difficult for me to moan about how tired I was when they were making a go of it!
Overall, it was a great day. I loved the Triple Crown section and glad I got to do it in beautiful weather. 
Note to future hikers - SOBO through this section seemed much better than NOBO. Easier to get the McAfee sunrise from the close by shelter, and the scramble UP Dragon’s Tooth was much better than having to climb down it.","Campbell shelter, VA 714.9

I had a long climb up Brush Mountain, on the top of which is a memorial to Audie Murphy, whose plane crashed nearby in 1971. He was the most decorated soldier of WWII, inspiring many. There were several benches nearby, and I paused for a bit - both recovering for a bit as well as reflecting on the contributions of that generation (including my father-in-law, who was a radio operator in the Pacific). 
After that brief respite, I came down the mountain to meet my shuttle driver and headed into town, doing multiple errands. I have a 4 day stretch coming up to get to Pearisburg, and I want to be rested.","Pickle Branch shelter, VA 697.9

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658220,"Today was a tough hike over Sinking Creek mountain, but it had a little bit of everything to keep my interest up.  First, after a long hike up I crossed the Eastern Continental divide. I think this means that instead of leaning left to fill my water bottle as I head south I need to lean right…but my water bottle will still be filled. 
The ridge itself of the mountain had many views, but was largely covered by slabs of rock at 45 degree angles.
 This was slow going and a bit tiring on the ankles after several miles, but I was grateful that the rocks were dry so that the traction was good. It would have been very tricky in the rain. 
Occasional relief from the rocks came from stands of forest as I traversed the ridge, abloom in white snakeroot.
 
At the end of the ridge were approximately 20 stone cairns. Signs of a lost civilization?  Alien beacons?  Failed attempts to clear fields for farming on the ridge?  Difficult to decide. 
The final leg of the hike took me through some beautiful meadows and pastures

 in the valley below.  I passed the Keffer oak, the oldest oak tree on the AT in the
 south, estimated at 300 years old. It was massive. 
I know many people object to the introduction of technology into the wilderness experience, but one of the ways I amuse myself as I hike is to try to identify species of plants or animals (visually) or birds (by birdsong) that I don’t recognize. I use two apps - Seek, which identifies plants and animals using the phone camera, and Merlin, which records birdsong and identifies the bird species.   I find this adds an extra dimension (or welcome diversion) as I hike through the many environments on the Appalachian Trail. 
Tonight’s shelter is in a stand of rhododendrons and is lovely. I am the only hiker here tonight, which still happens occasionally - I will probably snuggle up in my tent and listen to an audiobook. Tomorrow - over two mountains to Bailey Gap shelter.","Hwy 621, VA 689.3

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658221,"I am a planner by nature. I’ve loved sketching out the details of each stage of this hike, from gear to food to hiking plans. Consistent with the last entry, I’ve used a few key apps to help:
AWOL’s guide, which is available as a book, but I have downloaded as a pdf on my IPhone. Great for planning as it shows the mile marker for every major feature along the trail, plus helpful maps of trail towns and lists of hostels and shuttles. Gaia, which allows me to map out the daily routes I am planning with detailed elevation calculations so I can evaluate the difficulty. I can also export these maps to my watch (Garmin Fenix) so I can track my progress during the day. FarOut, which gives me more real-time information on shelters and water availability, crowd sourced from other thruhikers. 
While I hesitate to confess this, I started off this 3 month hike with a plan for each day on where I would start and stop, along with mileage and elevation gain estimates. At this point in my hike I have met enough other hikers to understand that this is highly unusual…most of my peers plan out their schedules at most 2 or 3 days in advance, and generally just focus on how much food they will carry.  I have been adjusting the plan as I get a better feel for what I can handle, but have upper limits on what I attempt each day. 
So, imagine my joy today when I got to my planned stopping point, a shelter a reasonable 14.5 miles from the last spot, to discover that there was no water at the shelter!  
The hike itself had been remarkably unremarkable, probably my least favorite day so far. I climbed two mountains (Kelly Knob and Salt Pond Mountain) with no views for the effort but lots of ugly ankle twisting rocks on their ridges, and had arrived at Bailey Gap shelter at 4:30.   I was tired, and had just finished the water I had carried. It turned out Bailey Gap’s water source had dried up. 
So - afterburner time. Sunset would be at 7:20 pm, I hike about 2 miles an hour, and I had 4 miles to go to the next shelter.  I got a move on, powering through thick stands of rhododendrons almost 20’ high and tightly woven together (feeling almost primordial in the gathering gloom) and arrived at Pine Swamp Branch shelter as dusk was falling, having hiked my longest day to date. I got the last tent site (there were 5 hikers already in residence), quickly cooked dinner, and crashed.

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658222,"Today’s hike was…an experience. 
It started off innocently enough, with a well graded switch-backed climb up Peter’s Mountain. The sun was shining and I was looking forward to the walk along the ridge line to Rice Fields shelter, reputed to have beautiful views.   I have had remarkably good weather so far, and another sunny day was in the forecast. 
By 8:30, the wind had started to pick up as I neared the mountain top and the sky was turning gray. It started to gently sprinkle, just enough to turn the rocks slippery. I made sure my gear was stowed away safely in my backpack and donned my stylish rain kilt (a waterproof skirt that goes over your shorts and keeps you dry down to your knees while not overheating - pretty much a fancy trash bag).  My shirt was already soaked through from sweat, but I put on a rain jacket as well. 
I continued along the ridge for a piece, carefully navigating the slick rocks. I was startled to be approached by a small herd of goats. They did not ask me riddles, but politely inquired whether I would be willing to feed them hiker treats. When I politely demurred, they retired, disappointed (I heard from a later hiker that they stole his food bag and a hiking pole - in retribution, I am sure). 
But then the wind started picking up, as well as the rain. I was still on top of the ridge and the fog and mist rolled in. The great views that I had anticipated evaporated, and I was starting to get chilled. I picked up my hiking pace to keep warm, and finally reached Rice Fields shelter (after backtracking in the fog) a little after 1pm. I quickly changed into dry clothes to get warm and decided I had no desire to remain on the ridge in the fog for the rest of the day. 
Happily, I was able to get through to a nearby hostel and book a room for the night. Down the mountain I went, punching through the fog back into the sunshine by 3 and fully dry by 5:30.  This turned out to be my longest day yet, and first over 20 miles. I am now snug and warm at the hostel, and happy that when I needed them, enough reserves were there to allow me to power through. 
The past couple of days have been great reminders about my need to be adaptable to trail conditions. Nature is a Mother.","Pine Swamp Branch shelter, VA. 656.7

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658262,"I arrived last night at Woods Hole hostel, a tiny slice of heaven approximately 10 miles south of Pearisburg VA. Run by Neville, granddaughter of the original owners, the hostel is part hiker hostel, part organic farm, part bed and breakfast, and part retreat. I had first heard about Woods Hole when researching the trail (“top hostel”), and later listened to several interviews that Neville had given.  I liked what I had heard, so made sure my hiking schedule included a stop.  Best decision ever. 
Neville, a hiker-whisperer and healer of lost souls, runs the 100 acre property (including cabin, bunkhouse, safari tents, and numerous pets) with such a caring attitude and generosity of spirit that it is impossible not to be touched. Dinner and breakfast are communal affairs, with the majority of the food sourced from her garden or other nearby farms. The food has been terrific, and my stay is one of the highlights of my hike so far. 
On the Camino de Santiago trail in Spain, the hostels/albergues have a rating system so that the travelers know what to expect - eg, a castle or a shack. The AT does not have an equivalent system, but so far I have seen roughly 4 levels:
Basic: somebody’s converted garage. No heat or indoor plumbing, but protection from the elements. Acceptable: indoor sleeping quarters, showers, laundry facilities, TV, available hiker food, and shuttles into town for resupply. Good: all the above plus comfortable outdoor area for relaxation, nicer/cleaner bathrooms and bunk rooms, breakfast and/or dinner offerings, nearby town has broader restaurant and retail offerings. Woods Hole
For some reason, this particular stretch of trail (Pearisburg to Atkinson) has a number of good hostels, so I am planning on doing some hostel-hopping over the next week. 
After yesterday’s storm, temperatures dropped more than 20 degrees and, with wind chill, it felt like 39 degrees (as opposed to the balmy 60’s) when I set off this morning. My goal was to hike back to Pearisburg to pick up the miles I had skipped yesterday when I came out to Woods Hole. It was a pleasant, downhill gradient, and by 2:00 I was downing a Blizzard at the Pearisburg Dairy Queen. Then back up to Woods Hole for another great dinner.

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658290,"I set off from Woods Hole after a spectacular sunrise over the fields, loaded down with a loaf of home baked bread (a nice change from tortillas for my lunch). The day started off cool again, but I was shedding layers within 20 minutes as the uphill hiking warmed me up. 
Today’s hike had no special features, but was nicely graded and (thankfully) had relatively few rocks, giving my feet a break. I spent a lot of time in closely woven stands of rhododendrons again. I have tried to capture the effect in pictures,  but have largely failed - it is a completely different feeling from walking through the forest, and a new experience for me. I mentioned in an earlier post that these areas feel more ancient and primordial - one almost expects gnomes to pop out.  Now that it is autumn, there are also a lot of leaves and acorns on the trail. The acorns can sometimes be numerous enough to act like ball bearings. Yet another thing to watch for with each step!
Every hiker I passed today stopped to mention the upcoming lack of water in tomorrow’s hike. It looks like a long water carry - which I have decided to slackpack, as it appears that there is no water at the shelters either. 
Tonight at Weary Feet there are 5 other hikers, NOBO/SOBO/section. There was a lot of exchange of trail intelligence on what is coming up for each group, which was really helpful, and a nice side benefit of hostel stays.

Today’s hike added 39,000 steps as I hiked from US 52 back to the hostel, a little more than 18 miles. Slackpacking back to the hostel made it much easier to handle a waterless section (I still carried 5.5 lb water) plus a forecast thunderstorm, which materialized at 1:30. It is much preferable when soaked to end up at a hostel (warm shower, clothes dryer) than it is to set up a tent. 
The hike itself was fairly smooth and quite manageable despite its length. Sometimes the trail is just the trail - limited views, no exciting wildlife or alien encounters - but the rhythm is soothing and the steps build up.  Float, who is still recovering from his ankle sprain, joined me for most of the hike.

It is completely surrounded by Garden Mountain and was formed when underground limestone caverns collapsed, creating highly fertile farmland almost lost in time. 
The trail, while rocky in places, passed through lovely forests and crossed over Laurel Creek, a refreshing stop in the middle of the day. 
There were no views of the valley itself until the end of the day when I stopped over at a new hostel. The drive down into the valley was stunning - beautiful plots of farmland with 360 degree views. Tonight’s hostel was a bunkhouse on a working farm, and looks like it will be a winner. At night, with almost no light pollution, the sky was filled with stars.","US 52 VA 591.8

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658384,"Today my favorite color was - orange. There is a 3 day bear hunting season in VA in September, focused on “problem” bears,  and we met 2 different groups of hunters and 3 packs of dogs on the trail. The dogs all have radio controlled collars so they can be tracked and recalled remotely. We could hear the dogs baying, as sort of a throwback to Hounds of the Baskervilles, long before seeing them as they worked to tree bears. 
The local rumor is that the troublesome bears (“baars”) from the Smoky Mountains are relocated to this area - and that they create issues on the farms, destroying the crops. This short season is to focus on reducing the population of these larger, more aggressive bears. One of the groups we ran into was clearly Amish, part of an Amish community that farms in Burke’s Garden. 
Obviously, it was a good time to be visible. I have a number of orange clothing pieces, including an orange buff that can sit jauntily on my head. The hunters were generally friendly, and we shared the trail amicably. 
Today’s hike took me up and over Chestnut Knob, a steep climb but with a beautiful view back to Burke’s Garden.The hike itself was relaxed and enjoyable, although I am beginning to be aware of increasing soreness from the long days. I am looking forward to a break in Damascus. 
I finished the day at Bear Garden hostel, in the bunkhouse with Float and Truman.  Like most hostels, this one had a range of frozen dinners and resupply food available for purchase.

Unfortunately, Mother Nature has other plans, with Hurricane Ian hitting Florida today and Tropical Storm Ian forecast to hammer the southwest corner of VA on Saturday and Sunday (days 3-4 of the 5 day segment). 
So there’s been a bit of a pivot. Today I hiked with Float for 24.2 miles (my highest day by far) to knock one day off the schedule, and tomorrow I’ll flip up to the Grayson Highlands (originally day 3 of my segment) and hike 2 days backwards to knock off days 2 and 3. After that, I’ll head to a Damascus hotel to ride out the storm and get days 4-5 when things settle down.

We then took a shuttle up to Partnership shelter (12 miles south) and hiked back to Atkins. This hike was more difficult, with lots of rocks that tore up my trail runners. Emergency repairs with superglue will keep them going for the next couple of days, but I needed to radio home for a replacement pair (my 3rd set).

The overall direction was down, heading back northwards towards Atkins on a 2 day segment. It was a beautiful hike, with mountain balds (meadows at peaks), dappled forests, and cascades of water.  The higher altitudes of this state park must often be shrouded in mist, as most rocks and trees were covered in moss.

This evening I stayed at a hostel in Troutdale that focuses on Sufiism and meditative retreat while also serving as a hiker hostel. Loaner clothes (offered to hikers while they launder their hiking clothes) were long, flowing robes in Eastern style.

It is very apparent after talking to hikers through the last 6 weeks that there as many ways to thru hike the AT as there are hikers, the choices each hiker makes almost becoming a unique fingerprint. One one to think of it is as a Chinese menu (options ordered by perceived purity):

Hike EFI (every flipping inch) of the trail. No blue, aqua, or yellow blazing. Within reason, hike the trail.

They are part of a wild herd that roams the balds near Mt Rogers. During the summer, they will come up and lick the sweat off hikers for the salt, but it was too cold today for much sweating. 
This area is often in mist. I mentioned the high levels of moss the other day. Today I hiked through stands of trees completely covered in white lichen which were very eerie, like ghost forests. 
One of today’s highlights, as the mist rolled through, was the “flash rainbow” shown above  which formed right in front of me and lasted for about 30 seconds. I was just able to catch it on camera before it dissolved. 
The trail itself was quite wet due to all the precipitation from the storm over the past couple of days. In many areas it had been transformed into a stream, and required careful negotiation to keep my feet relatively dry on a cold day. There were also considerable roots and rocks, so progress was generally slow. 
Tonight’s shelter, Lost Mountain, is fairly busy. There is a group of section hikers, mostly ex-Boy Scout leaders, that we have run into before. It is fun to run across section hikers. They typically are not quite as hardened as thru-hikers and often have fresh perspectives.

Of note today - crossed into Tennessee(and hoping that the trail conditions are a sign of good things from Tennessee) and spotted what I think was a coyote stalking along a forest road. You can occasionally hear the coyotes at night.

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658653,"Today was water day - and happily not the falling-from-the-sky kind.  Wautauga Lake, which had been peeking through the foliage views yesterday, finally took front and center position as the trail crossed over Wautauga Dam, completed in 1948 by the TVA. The damming of the Wautauga and Elk Rivers created the reservoir, submerging the town of Butler, which was relocated. 
Had it been warmer, it might have been an opportunity for swimming or kayaking (or aqua blazing), but it was another cool morning. It was lovely to walk along, though, and had a number of great tent sites. 
From Wautauga Lake, the trail moved on to Laurel Falls, a roaring cascade that provided a nice spot for a break (there were some hikers taking a dip - brrrr).  While lovely to visit, the climb out of Laurel Falls was a set of uneven rock steps that seemed to go on forever. 
We were passed today by the first “bubble” of SOBO hikers we’ve seen, 5 in a group, covering 20-25 miles per day. They were moving fast, clearly focused on getting to Springer (or maybe it was just to arrive in time for a live music performance at an upcoming bar on the trail). In addition to the SOBO’s, the fall color is bringing out lots of day and section hikers. 
Tonight was spent at Moreland Gap shelter, which had some nice, flat tent sites. Tennessee shelters, at least the ones I have seen, are of different construction, using cinder block for walls and generally not having a privy, necessitating “cathole” techniques to observe Leave No Trace principles. 
It was a long day today - the mileage was awkward and it was going to be either a short or long day. Long day won out. It just feels wrong to not be hiking when the weather is so good. My hiking partner and I did not arrive at the shelter until a little after 6, racing darkness to set up tents and cook dinners.  I was exhausted when I crawled into my chilly tent for the night. 
Today I passed 600 miles of hiking. Still minuscule compared to the 1700’s of the SOBO’s and flip floppers, but enough (as I am assured by other hikers) to allow me to graduate from rank novice. 413.7 miles remaining to Springer.","Wilbur Dam Rd TN 432.9

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658660,"Well, I did 19 miles yesterday, so 18 today with less elevation gain should be no problem, right?  Hah. 
I didn’t sleep well last night, and woke up early with “dead legs” from yesterday’s exertions.  We set off before sunrise, as we wanted to arrive at tonight’s hostel in time for laundry, shower, and dinner. 
It was the final full day in Tennessee - and yet another beautiful hike. In my research for the AT, I never read anyone extolling the virtues of the Tennessee trail, so let me be the first: rolling elevation, generally well graded; well maintained; soft trail with relatively few rocks; pretty forest scenes and (on the southern end) water features. Just missing sweeping valley views, but would definitely do it again. 
Today it seemed that the “green tunnel” of the AT was morphing into a “golden tunnel” as the trees around us morphed into fall colors. A couple of long valley views also showed the reds popping up. My appreciation was a bit blunted, though, because I started running out of gas after the first 8-10 miles.   The uphills got slower and slower, and I welcomed the short side trail to Jones Falls, where I sat for a bit of a break. Unlike Laurel Falls yesterday, these falls were not roaring, but more of a zen-like Japanese garden experience (writ large). 
By the end of the day, I was crawling up the hills, and collapsed gratefully at Mountain Harbour B&B/hostel. I am staying at the B&B portion today, and at the hostel portion tomorrow. The B&B side is lovely, and I am ensconced in a very comfortable room. I should sleep very well tonight.","Moreland Gap shelter TN 413.7

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658673,"Best.hike.ever. 
Today’s hike, in the Roan Highlands, was magnificent, certainly the best day so far of this trip. It started off at Carver’s Gap, mid-way into the Highlands, as a reverse slackpack back to last night’s hostel. The weather was mid-30’s with gusts of 15-30 mph, making it quite brisk …I was wearing almost every piece of clothing I had. I had mostly recovered from yesterday’s exertions and, after a remarkably good breakfast at the hostel, was ready to rock ‘n roll. 
Almost immediately the trail crossed three balds in succession - Round, Jane, and Grassy Ridge Balds, each featuring sweeping panoramas of the mountains on either side. Fall foliage changes have hit here, so these vistas featured mountains in all colors of the rainbow.  Often AT hikers report no views at all as the ridge (at 5800’) is often socked in by cloud, but we were fortunate today and had sunny skies.  I made slow time, as the temptation to stop and take pictures at each step was overwhelming (note that these pictures never captured the actual beauty). 
Next, the trail progressed to Little Hump and Hump Mountains (Don’t ask. Perhaps they were saving the ‘Big Hump’ name for a future mountain?). Walking along the treeless trail to these mountains, with the ranges on either side, felt like walking on top of the world. Being a holiday weekend, I must have passed away 100 other hikers - yet it still felt like I was the only one there. Remarkable. 
I have blocked from my mind the last 5 miles of the hike, which were a rocky and steep descent back to the hostel. The first 10 miles were epic. 
On returning to the hostel, a group headed out to the local pub and swapped stories. Everyone felt very satisfied with the day’s efforts. 
Tomorrow we return to Carver’s Gap and head south, up and over Roan Mountain itself. I am crossing my fingers for more!

The shelter on top, at 6270 feet, is the highest I have passed by so far. 
To my surprise and slight regret, this side of Carvers Gap had none of yesterday’s drama. The trail was more similar to the rest of Tennessee, a generally well maintained golden tunnel with only one foliage view.I continue to be fascinated by the way light streams through the trees, creating different moods depending on weather, time of day, and forest cover. It is difficult to capture well in photos, though. 
 It was a long mileage day to be able to get to Cherry Gap shelter, but manageable due to the terrain. Float and I arrived about 4:30 and were joined by two other flip floppers, Happy Dancer and Bee Balm. Happy Dancer is 72 and just out of a splint for her broken wrist (which she hiked with). What a warrior. With the aid of a little Purell, we lit a fire and enjoyed its warmth as temperatures started slipping. By 7:30 we were all snug in our sleeping bags. 
It occurred to me as I was walking today on my first full North Carolina day that, as an East Coast girl, I have personal associations with most of the states the AT passes through (with the exception of GA and WV). Virginia is where my oldest daughter was married, and Tennessee my younger daughter. My younger daughter went to school in NC and lives there now. I have lived in 3 states, and have family in others. Many of the threads of my life weave through these states just as the trail does, and memories are evoked every time I cross a state line. It makes for interesting reflections as I hike.

Today’s hike was mostly a “get there from here” segment aimed at arriving in the town of Erwin, TN. It started with a long climb up Unaka Mountain, whose summit was covered by an ethereal stand of moss-covered evergreen tree trunks, like something out of Tolkien. It followed with a long downhill section, punctuated by “PUDS” (pointless ups and downs) along the way. 
The highlight was a viewpoint about halfway down known as “Beauty Spot” which provided long views of the mountains to the south, including our first glimpse of the Smokies, looming high and mighty in the distance.Awe-inspiring, to be sure. I’ve mentioned that my Day 3 challenge was the Roller Coaster and my Week 3 challenge was The Priest. My Month 3 challenge is the Smokies, and I still have some work to do to figure out how I will approach them. 
The last 3 miles into the town of Erwin were slow and painstaking as I needed to navigate a very rocky trail. My feet and I were happy to arrive at our hostel for the night and even happier to see that my resupply package had arrived. Happy Dancer, Bee Balm, and Float are here as well.

I reverse slackpacked 11 miles from Spivey Gap back to the hostel where I stayed last night, then spent the afternoon reviewing maps and making phone calls. Because my recent pace has been faster than planned, I have a lot of tangled reservations and appointments that need to be realigned. Plus I am rethinking my future plans, as some things that did not seem realistic before are suddenly feasible. It’s a bit of a mess. 
The hike itself was quick, downhill, and mostly painless. As I was going in reverse, I passed a number of thru hikers I knew and stopped to chat. Thru hikers make up a stream heading south right now, and I was heading upstream. Towards the end, the hike opened up to some beautiful views of the Nolichucky River, which is a major watershed for western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee.  Nolichucky is Cherokee for (choose one) Spruce-Tree Place, Rushing Waters, Dangerous Waters, or Black-Swirling Waters.

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658770,"My shuttle driver dropped me off at Spivey Gap to commence the 6.3 mile climb to Big Bald, approximately 3200 ft of elevation gain. It was a lovely warmup for the Smokies. 
Big Bald is, as you might expect, a bald at the top of a high (5500’) mountain. The weather this morning was heavily overcast and windy and the bald itself was covered in mist, limiting views. No matter - I have had some great views from balds over the past week, and later in the day I would be treated to more great foliage views.  
What surprised me is just how exposed I was to weather and wind gusts on the unprotected bald. With no trees to break the force of the wind, the 20-30mph gusts buffeted me around for a ½ mile.  I had underestimated this, but had all the right clothing with me so was able to adjust. I will certainly treat these balds with a bit more respect in the future. 
Once clear of the summit, the weather calmed considerably as I made my way downslope. I have chosen to spend another night in a hostel as I needed to make some calls and wanted to be sure I had good service. The hostel, Nature’s Inn, is excellent and spotlessly clean. 
One of the trail-associated small business segments that I have used a lot has been shuttles. Either provided by hostels or independent operators, shuttles are a lifeline for hikers trying to get from trailhead to town or (as in my case) to periodically jump to different points of the trail. Shuttle drivers need to navigate long winding roads up and down mountains, in all kinds of weather, at all times of day, often with smelly and dirty hikers and their gear. They provide useful word-of-mouth updates and tips. Their cars take a beating (probably 80% of the cars I have been in have had warning lights on in the dash). I have consistently had great shuttle drivers, and I am thankful to them all.

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658822,"It was a classically crisp, sunny autumn day, beautiful weather for walking. The foliage continues to pop, creating natural artwork all around.  As it was heading into the weekend, I ran into several groups of section hikers, some woefully unprepared (lost, no water, etc). I guess I now at least look experienced (or dirty) enough to be considered a reliable source of information. 
My objective was a stretch today, 18 miles and 5300’ of elevation gain to Jerry’s Cabin shelter,  which sets me up well for the next couple of days. Tomorrow morning takes me over Big Firescald Knob, a rocky ridge with great views but a bit tricky if you are tired or it is raining. My strength and agility are at their best in the am, so I tried to organize this segment around that timing. 
I arrived at the shelter around 5 pm and scurried around doing camp chores (water, tent, cook dinner, etc) before dark. I was joined shortly after by a grandfather/father/ grandson set of section hikers. It was fun to see the exuberance of the grandson on his first hiking trip, and listening to the grandfather give him tips. Right now, as I am curled up in my tent, they are building a fire together. It is entertaining to listen to, but eventually they succeed. The firelight plays through my tent fabric, just as moonlight does on a full moon.

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658844,"It was a perfect October day, evocative of so many memories - raking leaves, fall football games, watching our daughters’ soccer and field hockey games - and the burnt oranges and reds of the foliage continued to suffuse the trail with a golden glow. 
First off for the day was Big Firescald Knob, a 2 mile rocky section of trail that required a bit of agility but provided wonderful views.   The rocks/boulders were sometimes large, uneven steps; large slabs tilted at 45 degree angles that needed to be navigated carefully; or pure rock piles that needed to be scrambled over.  Somewhere in the middle there was a plaque honoring Howard McDonald, master trail builder. My first reaction was to wonder how bad this section had been before he had worked his magic. Curious, I looked him up later to discover that he had worked on many of the western NC trails and had volunteered for over 30 years. Amazing. 
The rest of the day was a bit more conventional from a trail perspective, winding up and down forest paths. 
Today was also evocative of Halloween. First, the treats: TWO trail magic encounters!  The first popped up when I spotted a sign tacked to a tree with an arrow pointing down the driveway of a private home. “Homemade Oatmeal Cookies” it said. I turned left without hesitation and found on the porch of the home cookies, water, and Halloween candy. The husband and wife were both outside, and I chatted with them for several minutes before moving on. The second came a mile later when I emerged at Allen Gap to discover Marlene the Trail Angel dispensing drinks and food, as well as a sympathetic ear. I scooped up a Gatorade and more candy.  I certainly felt recharged after both these unexpected encounters!
The trick part?  Just as I used to dress in costume each Halloween, I think I might actually be slowly morphing into a thruhiker. All of us start with the intention to be thruhikers, but aren’t really on day one. But last week I stood at the food bar at a local grocery store for dinner and realized I could happily eat my way through everything there.  Salad bar AND fried chicken AND pizza AND deli food AND…you get the idea. Check for a thruhiker. Yesterday I ambled up to a shelter to stop for lunch and, under the gaze of another hiker, unselfconsciously made myself a lunch that a 1st grader would have loved - a peanut butter/honey/granola tortilla rollup, chased by a Snickers bar. Check for a thruhiker. Today I got to my destination (15 miles) and realized there was more daylight left that I could hike. So I did, another 3 miles, and tented instead of staying at a shelter. Check for a thru hiker. And most noticeably, I no longer deprecate my lack of experience. 750 miles is enough to give me a point of view. 
I am sure that more changes will come, but it is fascinating to watch.

When I was young, my parents enrolled me in ballet classes to try to add a bit of grace to my movements. Epic fail. As an athlete in college and later as an adult, I have rolled ankles more times than I care to count, and my footwear choices for this hike were influenced by finding options that gave me enough heel stability to avoid sprains.  Had I not been “Kidding”, “Twinkle Toes” would have been an apropos alternative trail name. 
One of the side effects of the wonderful fall foliage is that fallen leaves scatter across the trail. Pretty to look at on one hand, but treacherous on the other, as they hide root and rock trip hazards. I have gone from tripping maybe 1-2 times per day to at least 10-15 times per day. Usually these are just painfully stubbed big toes, but sometimes I find myself scrambling for balance.   So far, I haven’t gone down…but it feels like a matter of time.  In the meantime, I think I will be donating my big toe joints to science. 
Today’s hike had 2 segments: hiking into Hot Springs in the morning, then reverse slacking from further south back to Hot Springs in the afternoon. Both hikes were downhill and relatively well graded, so I was able to make good progress both ways.  I ended up in Hot Springs at Laughing Heart Lodge for 3 nights - in what looks like a great decision. Both the town and the lodge look to be perfect places to spend a couple of days.  Like Damascus, the AT goes straight through town, with sidewalk markings replacing white blazes.  There are outfitters, restaurants, and a Dollar General. Nirvana for hikers. 
One additional feature Hot Springs offers is the chance for a hot mineral bath at the Hot Springs Spa and Resort (NB - as proof that marketing did not start in the 60’s, Hot Springs changed its name from Warm Springs in 1886). I tried it out this evening - the experience is like a high end hot tub, but I do feel much more relaxed. 
I am 3 days from entering the Smokies, and all weather forecasts show a significant cold front coming through this week. This is NOT good news, so I am scrambling around it.  Clingman’s Dome, the highest point on the AT, is showing a windchill of -4 degrees in 2 days.

This was more than I had ever done…and I had been sweating this since I started planning my hike almost a year ago.  But the trail was very well graded, with steps and switchbacks, which kept the average grade reasonable (eg 10-12%). I was well rested from the time in Hot Springs, and my stripped-down pack was relatively light.  And I made it!  
I hiked in with Float, who did a good job of pacing. In theory, all hikers are required to stay inside the shelters in the Smokies due to bear activity and to minimize the impact on the environment. But post-COVID, there has been a bit more flexibility regarding tenting - just precious few tent sites at some of the shelters. But a tent has the advantage of an extra 5-10 degrees of warmth when it is cold, and better wind protection. Happily, we got there minutes before other hikers and snagged the only 2 flat tent sites. 
And it was cold. By the time we were approaching the shelter (at 5900’), we were hiking in snow that had fallen several days before. As we moved from the sun side of the mountains to the shadow side, the temperature would drop 15 degrees. 
The shelter itself was of stone construction with a fireplace. It also had the first accessible privy I had seen, with a ramp and grab bars. At first I thought this was a bit odd because the only way a hiker in a wheelchair could have reached this shelter is by helicopter…but subsequently I learned that horses can also be ridden on trails in many areas of the Park, and that this is a means for the disabled to reach some of the more scenic points. Kudos to the AT and National Park Service for working to make the wilderness more available to all. 
There were 8 or so section hikers staying at the shelter; one group of section hikers whipped up a batch of chocolate covered strawberries and shared them all around. This was, as you can imagine, a very welcome treat. 
Night-time temps dropped to the low 30’s overnight. It took me a long time to get warm in my sleeping bag as I tweaked clothing and sleeping bag configurations. I finally dropped off around 1am, having discovered the secret to my quilt setup.

It was very cold when I awoke, high 20’s to low 30’s.  A trick that I’ve learned is to stick a couple of key pieces of gear in my sleeping bag when the temperatures cool off: my filter, so it won’t freeze (which ruins the filter), my lighter so that it will strike easily to light my stove, and some of my electronics. Everything survived the night well. My breakfast of hot tea and oatmeal did as much to warm my hands as fill my stomach. 
I was a bit tired when we started off, due to not sleeping well, and it was soon evident that the combination of higher elevations, ice, and multiple ups and downs were going to make the day tough…surprisingly tougher than yesterday, which was supposed to be the killer. Fortunately, there were many more views today as we emerged out of the forest at several points.The trail was packed with day hikers taking advantage of the foliage views, particularly around Charlie’s Bunion. 
An interesting fact about the AT through the Smokies - The AT essentially rides the state border between Tennessee and North Carolina, so as you walk southbound on the trail Tennessee is on the right side and North Carolina on the left!
By the time we reached Newfound Gap, our planned end point, both Float and I were spent and delighted to be heading into town for showers, resupply, warm beds.  Gatlinburg, the town that we got off into, was jammed with tourists, as it was “Leaf Week”, but most of the tourists I saw looked like they were there for Dollywood and Ripley’s Believe It or Not.  Gatlinburg is kind of an alternative universe, and it was a bit odd to be there, to be honest.  It was also eye wateringly expensive for a 2 star hotel (that looked like the 2nd star was a gimme).

After being dropped back off at Newfound Gap, there was a long climb up to Clingman’s Dome, at 6643’ the highest point on the AT (and 3rd highest point east of the Mississippi) through old growth forest. A half mile from the top they came bounding down the trail. It was wonderful to see them!  We hiked together up to the summit, emerging from the trees to a Disney-like experience at the observation tower. As it is possible to drive within ½ mile of the summit, and it was a beautiful Saturday in October, the tower was thronged with visitors of all nationalities. 
While the view was excellent (particularly as it was a 360 degree sweep), better views could be had about 0.2 miles away. We snacked on some great trail magic at the top, then hiked down southbound a couple of miles more together. After our goodbyes, I hustled another 6 miles to Derrick Knob shelter, the target for the day. At this elevation, most of the leaves have dropped and were dry and slippery on the trail, so a little caution was required. 
The shelter was in good shape and Float was already there checking out the best tent sites. A group of section hikers followed shortly, exhausted from the day. It became obvious why as they emptied their packs of hotdogs, charcoal, marshmallows, and cans of side dishes. We started a fire (the shelter has a fireplace, a common feature in the Smokies) and they were kind enough to share marshmallows.

Departure from Derrick Knob shelter was necessarily before sunrise, to permit arrival before sunset. It was a day with lovely views and a number of section hikers. I ran into a crew of trail maintainers building new steps to manage trail erosion on steep slopes, and learned that there are approximately 2500 of these steps built into the trail in the Smokies. 
Finally emerging from the park at the Fontana trailhead, I strolled across the Fontana dam, built by the TVA, which creates a beautiful lake for recreation. Tonight’s stay was to be at the Fontana Village resort, and I was fairly well spent. However, Float had the good fortune to run into Ox, the head for trail maintenance for the Smoky Mountain trail club (which maintains the AT in the park), who generously treated us, as well as Living Proof, to dinner at the Lodge restaurant.

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659079,"Today was a Nearo - a shorter day to give a chance to resupply, do laundry, etc. Float and I slackpacked for 14 miles from Stecoah Gap back to Fontana Village. The trail was not as well groomed as the Smokies - a bit edgy, with more rocks, roots, and climbs (like Jacob’s ladder, 650 steps in 0.6 miles) that went straight up instead of switchbacks. However, clearly the local trail club has a sense of humor, as evidenced by this sign at a trail bridge. And the day was sunny and the elevation changes quite manageable. 
It is very noticeable how much more relaxed the thruhikers are now that they are through the Smokies. Almost lighthearted, as the remaining days on trail number 10 or less, the trail is not overly difficult, and the weather is cooperating.

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659080,"The trail from this point goes over a series of balds, each with lovely views. No one is quite sure why balds exist - according to the Forest Service, fire, drought, grazing, clearing by settlers or insects have all been theorized to be the source of these open mountain tops. Today it was first Cheoah Bald, as we hiked from Stecoah Gap to the NOC (Nantahala Outdoor Center), then Wesser Bald as we slackpacked north from Tellico Gap back to the NOC. 
It was a long day with very tight logistics to be able to knock out 22 miles in two segments. We started hiking as the sun rose (while I am not a fan of pre-dawn hiking, the sunrises are unforgettable) and hustled through the first section of 14 miles. As I have mentioned in earlier posts, most leaves have fallen and are dry on the trail. On rocky downhills, like we had today, they are slippery and deceptive. I had my 7th fall today as my feet slid out from underneath me on a downhill and managed to snap a trekking pole. Argh. Happily, I was 4 miles from the NOC, which is also an outfitter, and was able to get new poles relatively quickly. A bit bruised, but on my way to knock out the 2nd segment before nightfall.

Captain Hook joined us today, and we also crossed paths with Living Proof again. The SOBO hikers are marching inexorably towards Springer, and we will all finish within a couple of days of each other.  A highlight of today was the appearance of Fresh Grounds, famous for the trail magic he delivers up and down the trail. When we arrived at Burningtown Gap he was set up and cooking a full breakfast from his van - blueberry pancakes, deep-fried bacon, hash browns, and eggs to order. Plus coffee, tea, fruit, sodas, and snacks!  The breakfast was lip-smacking good. 
We finished the day at a creekside tenting site around a campfire, trying to plot out different strategies for the coming days and how we might finish NC and Georgia. With only a week left, there are still a surprising number of permutations of shelters, tent sites, and hostels.  There is an ongoing tension between finishing as quickly as possible and stretching out these last days to maximize the enjoyment.

At our elevation, though, we were treated to sunshine all day. Like yesterday, it was a walk through autumnal forests, with generally rolling terrain - the one exception being Albert Mountain at 5200 ft, most notable because it marks the 100 mile point to Springer Mountain. 
I felt great all morning, then overcommitted myself to a longer day than initially planned. Dry leaves again proved to be my nemesis, as I wiped out again on a rocky down hill section, straining my ankle. By the time I reached the campsite I was dragging…only to discover that the water source was another 0.5 miles away. Sigh.  We were joined by 3 groups of section hikers, including one family who had clearly never read the directions for assembling their tents until they arrived.  It was hilarious to listen to them (“I think the REI label goes up.” “Do the colors go together?”) as they problem solved together. 
Bears are an increasing problem this time of year as they scramble to bulk up for the winter. There have been several reports recently of aggressive/acclimatized bears, so we were all quite careful about bear hangs.

We were all eager to get going. 
A phrase that I have heard a lot from SOBOs and Flip Floppers is “It’s nothing you haven’t seen before,”  when evaluating the difficulty of an upcoming section in the south. Given that they have been through Maine and New Hampshire, this is undoubtedly true.   But at this point, I feel the same way. I have had harder climbs, tougher rocks, and longer days than I will face in Georgia - maybe not all together, but when you are hiking you take it a piece at a time. 
Today was tiring, but manageable. The skies were leaden, portending a change in weather. My ankle barked at me for most of the day, making me slower, particularly on the downhill sections. But I finished in enough time to join the group at a local brewery. Great food and relaxed company. 
Reality is starting to set in about how soon the end is approaching. At this point everyone has settled in on their target finish date, subject to weather and achieving some long mileage days between now and then.

Look, I have been so, so fortunate with weather this fall that it is ungrateful to complain about any little bump in the relentlessly sunny weather forecast. And today was not terrible - a steady light drizzle, a bit windy, but not a downpour.  
Today’s hike was long, and key to hitting my Nov 1 target for finishing.  The first 14 miles was very gentle - a walk in the woods - before adding some elevation in the last 6 miles. 
Due to the drizzle, my feet were wet in the first 30 minutes and stayed that way for the next 10 hours. The real challenge came from my ankle, still sore and swollen from the fall several days ago, which decided to be rebellious until conquered by steady doses of Vitamin I. Completing the hike today took more focus than usual. 
Fittingly, the last steps of the hike took me through the archway of Mountain Crossings at Neel Gap to the Tree of Soles. Neel Gap is 31 miles north of Springer Mountain, 2-4 days of hiking for NOBO thruhiker aspirants. Common wisdom is that 25% quit in these first miles, and the tradition is to tie your hiking shoes together and toss them onto a branch of the Tree of Soles on one’s trail exit. The tree is strewn with shoes!  Glad I’ve persisted.

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659267,"I’ve mentioned before that the flow of thruhikers along the trail is like a river, with hikers aware of who is ahead and who behind, sometimes getting caught in eddies but inexorably moving forward. 
There is also a river of time in this community... thruhiker legends and wisdom, traditions and tips. Experienced hikers who take newbies under their wings. A wonderful example of this is Nimrod at the Above the Clouds hostel, the first hostel north on the trail, a mere 20 miles from Springer. Self-described as “older than dirt”, Nimrod first hiked the AT more than 40 years ago, and now runs the hostel along with Lucky. 
Each spring, along with the early thaw and the first buds, fresh-faced NOBO hikers arrive in droves - most cold, wet, confused, or overburdened with too much of the wrong stuff. Nimrod dispenses food and comfort, as well as expansive tales of the AT then and now. His words: “Yes, I get asked the same question 200 times a week. But for each person asking, it is their first time asking that question.”  This morning there was a section hiker benefiting from that advice. 
Today’s hike was a 19 mile jaunt that took me up and over Blood Mountain. At 4438 ft, this is the first 4000 footer that the NOBOs hit, so holds a special place in AT lore for perceived degree of difficulty. For me, though, as for other SOBOs, it felt like a straightforward climb. As it was another wet day, the view from here (as well as Preacher’s Rock, which followed) was pretty non-existent.  
A damp carpet of leaves covered the trail, coloration varying depending on the trees above.
 Picking out the trail is often a matter of detecting a minor depression in this leaf carpet, but I find that I am doing this subconsciously now. 
I caught up with Float at Woody Gap, and we hiked together to Cooper Gap to be picked up by Nimrod to go to the hostel.  This was strategically a great move, as Float’s wife had driven in with a delicious white bean chili soup and craft beers. 
Everyone is focused on tomorrow’s finish and the subsequent logistics of life re-entry. The blended notes of anticipation and anxiety permeate the conversations.

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659268,"Made it!
The final leg of this southern AT journey to Springer Mountain had a little bit of everything. Sun dappled forests and mist; rhododendron groves; waterfalls; streams; and, of course, rocks. 
I took my time, meandering along the trail trying to imprint the sights, sounds, and aromas on my memory. 
I have been fortunate over the course of my life to be able to travel widely, and have always found myself enriched by the experience. The past 10 weeks on the AT have been no different…except perhaps more intense.  Much of that learning has come courtesy of my companions on the trail, who have uniformly tried to help me to succeed. 
I am only halfway through the trail, but a couple of reflections:
Gratitude - there is nothing like stripping out all of life’s luxuries and being away from home for an extended period of time to highlight how much there is to be grateful for. Family and friends; running water and hot showers; health; trail maintainers; the kindness of total strangers.  When you are hiking for 8-10 hours per day, it gives you a chance to be grateful for many things. 
Caution - 5,000,000 steps in the wilderness (2.2 MM so far). What could go wrong?  Thanks to Coach for teaching me to always have a Plan A, B, and C for every step I take, and to the Damascus outfitter for finally getting me into shoes with some grip. 
Courage - there are so many kinds of courage. Many of the people I met on the trail were on a journey of recovery - loss of a loved one, health issues, psychological trauma. A number were working through injury, determined not to be stopped. Most were battling the mental grind of getting up each day to march forward, cold, wet, cold and wet, hot, thirsty, hot and thirsty, and always hungry. I admire my fellow hikers more than I can express. A special thanks to Float, who taught me about all of these, and never hesitated to push me to go “just 3 more miles.”
Humility - honestly, getting even this far is a lucky roll of the dice. Weather, injury, illness - all can disrupt or end a hike of this length. I have been very fortunate to dodge these so far. I am also gobsmacked by just how much I did not know when I started 10 weeks ago…which leads me to be suspicious that there is still a lot more to learn. I have spent the last 10 weeks watching and learning from others, and I do not want to stop. 
Community - I am awed by the AT community - other thruhikers, hostel owners, shuttle operators, trail angels, volunteer trail maintainers, small businesses in smal trail towns - who collectively operate to support and nurture the hikers on the Appalachian Trail. I have had so many caring and positive encounters on the way, of people paying it forward on a daily basis. Too many to thank - but thank you. 
Mountains - I had not anticipated how much I would be drawn to these mountains of the Southern Appalachians. I feel privileged and lucky to have hiked them during the spectacular fall foliage season, but suspect that all seasons hold their own special allure. Driving away from Springer towards Atlanta today I found myself staring pensively out of the car window, feeling their pull as they vanished in the distance. 
Persistence - it is amazing what can be accomplished by focus and repetition. There was not a mountain I could not climb as long as I kept putting one front in front of the other (hey, sometimes they were tiny steps and I was pretty slow, but I did not go backwards). In a life defined by sunlight hours, I found that you can get a lot done before sunrise. And I found that putting miles on the scoreboard almost every day (I only took 5 zeros) helped move me steadily towards the end. 
Gear and planning - this is where I spent all my time in advance of my hike, and I have some thoughts which I might detail in a future post. But honestly?  It was the stuff above that mattered. 
I am going to take a bit of a break for the winter. I hope to knock off some of the PA rocks during that time, then start up going north in April. I hear there are mountains there.","Cooper Gap GA 12.3
",Springer Mountain GA 0.0,"Nov 01, Tue",12.30
Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659524,"I flew home the day after summiting Springer, almost half of my thru hike completed. My plan is to do a couple of day hikes later in the fall in PA, then to start back up hiking in April.  I will do posts on those hikes, then some gear thoughts during the winter “intermission”. 
What is it like to return from the trail?  I was only gone for 2-½ months, half the time of a full thruhiker. But it has been a bit eye opening. In no particular order:
Returning home. The logistics of returning home were a bit trickier than I expected. Springer is in the middle of nowhere, reached by car up a long winding fire road. After you summit, you can either have a shuttle ready to pick you up, hike down the approach trail to Amicalola Lodge, or get a friend/family member to pick you up (which I did).   If you can drive home, great. If you are flying home, you need to discard the stuff that can’t go on a plane at all (like fuel, which can’t just be tossed in the nearest trash can), and mail or check the items the TSA feels are too dangerous to carry on (trekking poles, knife, tent stakes, etc). If you check these items, you need to conjure up a suitcase.  You probably want to shower and wash your hiking clothes before sitting next to your fellow passengers.  This all takes time, so you probably need to find a place to stay overnight as well.  All of this is a bit of a downer after the high of finishing. 
Physical recovery. I was fortunate, returning home with relatively minor ailments. Over 3-4 weeks of doing nothing, the swelling on my sprained ankle disappeared and the ankle recovered enough to let me run in the local Thanksgiving Turkey Trot.  I PR’d that run but, more interestingly, after running my fastest time ever I was ready to run it again.  I still had residual endurance reserves 4 weeks later.  My knees have not recovered yet - still stiff in the morning and sore after most exercise - but I am being patient with them. 
Weight - I lost 20 lb over the 10 weeks.  Based on everything I have read, I am expecting to gain that all back - but 4 weeks later the weight is still off. I can’t figure this one out, and am wondering when my metabolism will notice that I am no longer hiking 20 mile days. I did ratchet down my calorie intake, but find it takes some time to teach my body to not expect to be fed every 90 minutes.  In the meantime, I have almost no clothes that fit!
Friends and family - I have been so lucky with the support of my family and friends. It was a priority to reconnect when I returned, but I underestimated just how time intensive this would be as I was getting back on my feet at home. Many had heard about this blog and taken the time to read it, and had great questions. I found it difficult, though, to effectively handle questions from acquaintances less steeped in what the experience was all about. There is no “elevator speech” to explain a thruhike, and my responses to queries like “You hiked for 10 weeks??” were wholly inadequate. 
Fellow thruhikers. One of the joys over the past couple of weeks has been watching other hikers that I met complete their thruhikes, a monumental achievement. Gander and Goose, Truman, Happy Dancer and Bee Balm, Locket and her sons Navigoat and Care Bear, Manchego.  And finishing before I got to Springer - Coach, Living Proof, Captain Hook, and Float. Amazing job by all. 
An avalanche of things to do.  One of the consequences of putting your life on hold is that there is a huge backlog when you start it up again. The first couple of weeks back, I was buried by simple things (balancing a checkbook after 3 months on the road, responding to deferred emails) and more complex stuff (upcoming vacation and holiday plans, financial decisions). I needed to catch up on routine doctor visits. Get a haircut. Get a pedicure (okay, this wasn’t required but sure felt good). 
Psychological recovery - a lot has been written about post-trail depression, and its high incidence among thruhikers who struggle to reconnect back with their daily lives upon return.  I have not experienced this - I am naturally a glass-half-full person, have been too busy to think since I got back, and was only gone for 10 weeks - but I am conscious of a lingering, invisible pull back to the trail.  Being able to begin planning the 2nd half of my hike, even the couple of day hikes I plan to take in December, has helped ease this ache considerably. 
And that’s it.  I’m now back home, looking forward to holiday and vacation plans here, but ready to go next spring.","

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659525,"While I am unofficially on hiatus until next spring, I am planning to knock out some day hikes in my home state of PA in late fall and early spring, trying to get some of the least favorite portions of the AT behind me before my long haul NOBO. 
“Rocksylvania”, as the state is unfondly referred to by thruhikers, consistently shows up as the worst ranked state (of 14), due to a shortage of views and water combined with a surplus of snakes and rocks. The rocks are a vestige of the last Ice Age, when large quantities of material were deposited in PA by glaciers. The trail through PA has both large rocks (above) which must be climbed and small rocks (below)
 
which must be carefully navigated to avoid sharp points and sprains. Hiking shoes go to PA to die. 
The worst of the PA rocks are the northernmost 80 miles, from Port Clinton to the Delaware Water Gap, which I am hoping to do over 6 day hikes prior to my start from Harpers Ferry in April.  The trick (since it is a lot of rocks) is to find days where it hasn’t rained in the past 24 hours and the overnight temp is above freezing, as I don’t want to be dealing with ice. 
Today’s hike was the first of those rocky adventures, and I had several objectives:
See how bad the rocks really wereTest out some new trail runners (Hoka Speedgoats) which are highly cushioned and which I hope will minimize the impact of the smaller pointy rocksSee how much stamina I have lost in the past month so that I can set my startup pace for next spring appropriately
The hike itself was, I found, quite manageable. There were a couple of climbs that seemed to wear out the day hikers around me but that I found fairly straightforward, with reasonable grades, and there was a 2 mile section of large rocks (approaching Pulpit Rock and onward to The Pinnacle) that I needed to pick through carefully - but there were also 4 miles of well graded fire road.  Overall I made great time. 
Leaves have completely fallen in PA by now, so there was no “green tunnel” and I was occasionally able to glimpse farmland through the branches. I passed by a spring named “Pocahontas Spring”,
 
which I found curious- surely she didn’t come this far north?  Further on I stopped to eat lunch at The Pinnacle:

where I chatted with several groups of day hikers, all of whom, like me, were festooned in orange blaze clothing as the trail in this section is on State game lands and it is hunting season.  I finished off at Eckville shelter, where I was picked up and returned to my bed and breakfast. 
Conclusions on a couple of points:
if this is as bad as the rocks get I am going to be fine, just need to take my timethe Hokas did great on their first outing. I felt much less pain from those pesky little rocks due to the spongy soles I had plenty of stamina for a 14 mile day but am pretty sore!  Need to find ways to keep those hiking muscles in shape during the winter.","Port Clinton, PA 1220.6

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659526,"I love hiking in the early winter, when it is dry and crisp. The light quality changes, which along with the missing leaves provides a different clarity to the light. 
I was in my “Great Pumpkin” outfit again today.
 
Hunters were visible on the trail (the ones I saw were looking forlornly for deer as they walked slowly up the path), but I could also hear the rifle shots of their more successful compatriots away to the east. 
The hike started with a gentle climb up to Dan’s Pulpit and continued on to Balance Rock, both of which provided nice views. The rocks continued to be manageable, and overall today’s walk reminded me of the other epithet for this state, “Flatsylvania”. There is much less elevation on this part of the trail, certainly in comparison to NC and GA, and I made good time. For some reason, however, there were many downed dead trees (“blowdowns”) across the treadway, some of which took some effort to bypass.
 
These are usually cleared by AT trail crews, but they apparently have not been through here recently. 
I had hoped to hike tomorrow, but the forecast is for steady cold rain - not optimal for rocks in general, and for the next section’s profile in particular.

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659527,"I had a great start to my day by running into Moondawg, a volunteer trail maintainer, shortly after starting my hike. Moondawg has adopted this section of the trail, and comes out most mornings armed with a handsaw to make sure that the treadway is clear for hikers. He can’t do much about the rocks, but I can attest that this section was pristine in terms of blowdowns and branches (a nice contrast to the previous day). 
Moondawg clearly loves this portion of the trail, which is considered one of the more difficult AT stretches due to the Knife’s Edge and Bake Oven Knob rock formations, and he provided me detailed guidance on how best to traverse today’s hike. 
I left him and continued onwards, the ground crunching under my feet as the temps were in the low to mid 30’s. The first couple of miles were fairly easy, and then the larger rocks began. I passed bobcat scat (Moondawg had mentioned that a bobcat lives in this area) and eventually reached Knife’s Edge (above), a somewhat daunting rock scramble/boulder hopping adventure that extended about 250 yards, with the rocks piled into a peak along which the intrepid hiker progresses.
 Following Moondawg’s advice, I stowed my poles, stuck to the left going NOBO, and took it slow. There were a couple points where I needed to slide on my butt or swing using a tree branch to get to the next level, but I finished without incident. The top of the traverse was graced with lovely views of the PA farm countryside.  I looked cautiously - it was a long way down!

After descending Knife’s Edge, the trail continued to Bake Oven Knob, with both a rocky approach up and an even rockier route downwards. This caught me a bit by surprise, as I had expected most of the drama for the day to be over. There was again a nice view on top (Moondawg’s advice: take a right at the triangle rock to get to the best view),
 
but coming down Bake Oven Knob NOBO was, for me, perhaps even trickier than Knife’s Edge. A lot of patience and a couple more butt slides were required. 
The rocks continued for most of the rest of the segment. AT trail design tries to route the treadway over durable surfaces to limit erosion; it doesn’t get more durable than this:

I finished midafternoon on this short segment, glad that I had left plenty of time to not feel rushed, with a deeper appreciation of why PA is nicknamed “Rocksylvania”, and really happy I didn’t have to do it in the rain. This is my last hike for 2022; I hope to come back early next year and complete NE PA, then start the “flip” of my flip flop from HF to ME in April.","PA 309, 1246.6

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659702,"Happy 2023!  I have relocated my journal to the 2023 forum as I hope to finish the 2nd half of my thru this year.  For those of you just tuning in now - I am in the middle of a flip flop, having done HF to GA in the Fall of 2022, and planning to do HF to ME in the Spring/Summer of 2023. 
I am only half-way done with this through-hike, so I am a bit reluctant to speak with authority on gear choices.  However, given that a lot of hikers are polishing up their kit for Feb-April starts, I thought I would chip in a couple of reflections, some of which were not obvious to me when I started.  While gear is not the first, second, or third most important factor in a successful thruhike, it is one of the few things you can tweak before you start. 
Carrying system - I am using a Gossamer Gear Gorilla, with a 50 liter carrying capacity, supplemented by a Justin’s UL water bottle carrier (Etsy), a Red Paw fanny pack, and an Osprey pack liner.  Love the Gorilla, which is a little sister to the more popular Mariposa.  50 liters is a perfect size for a lightweight pack out (my base weight is approx 13 lb); I had tested the 60 liter Mariposa and found it too big. Besides the obvious (large stretchy back pocket, side pockets that actually hold on to your gear), it has 3 additional features which are critical for me:Multiple hip belt sizes.  Many UL packs have sewn in hip belts designed for lean guys.  GG offers a larger hip belt that can be easily swapped for the default size, which lets me wear the hip belt pockets further forward (which makes opening them a one-handed operation).  These hip belt pockets are large, which lets me keep moving rather than stop to grab gloves, headphones, snacks, etc.Removable exterior back pad.  I’ve replaced the default back pad with a folded GG ⅛” thinlite pad.  It is easy to pull in and out, and I use the thinlite for a seat pad, protective barrier for my sleeping pad, and general mat (eg if relaxing at a shelter after lunch).The hip belt, frame, and back pad are removable, so the pack strips down to 1 pound if I want to use it for a day pack - eg if slackpacking, resupplying, etc.Shoulder pouch for water bottle - Justin (Etsy) offers a feather light shoulder pouch that I use to carry my water bottle.  Shoulder vs pack carry of water supply is a bit of a debate, but I like having my water visible.
Red Paw fanny pack - In the spirit of “packing my fears”, I use the fanny pack to carry items that I want with me at all times, whether I am carrying my backpack or not.  Phone, lighter, knife, hand sanitizer, Aqua Mira, credit/health/ID cards, maps, pen and paper, whistle, emergency matches, emergency fire starter. My Garmin Inreach is attached to the fanny pack, so always attached to me even if I am answering nature’s call.  It is made from DCF, so is also waterproof (to protect the items above).  
Osprey pack liner - I started off with a Nylofume liner at 26g.  This worked great when treated gently.  But when I overstuffed it, one of the seams developed a small tear….which I discovered when unpacking my wet sleeping bag one night  after a downpour.  I switched (at a 2 oz penalty) to the Osprey liner, which is far more robust.  It has one important side benefit…I can leave gear in just the liner when I am in town or slackpacking - because it is opaque I feel slightly more confident that it will all be there on my return.  
Sleep system - I alternate between 20 degree and 50 degree Enlightened Equipment quilts, depending on the season.  After some testing, I settled on the Nemo Tensor inflatable sleeping pad (6 oz penalty to the Thermarest Neolite) due to the comfort, and I use a ⅛” thick Gossamer Gear Thinlight pad underneath it to minimize puncture risk.  However, the most important thing I’ve learned about my sleep system is that it includes all my clothing as well.  With the combination of my puffy and fleece (and, when cold enough, hood and gloves) I can finetune the temperature rating to a wide range.  
Tent - I was able to snag one of the first Durston Xmid 2 Pro’s, a single wall, 2 person trekking pole DCF tent.  I adore it.  Goes up very quickly, is light as a feather, and a palace inside.  100% recommend.  After shakedown, I swapped out the stakes for mini groundhogs, which can really take a pounding when hammered in with a rock.  The only watchout is that, as a two person tent, the footprint is larger than average, but I did not have much of an issue finding a tentsite in the South.  
Water system - My water system is a bit unusual, but I will offer it up in passing because it works for me.  Unlike the other 99% of the thruhiker population, I do not use a Sawyer squeeze and 1 liter Smartwater bottles.  I don’t like to squeeze 2 liters when I get to camp (slightly arthritic hands), 1 liter containers are a bit unwieldy for me, they are hard to fill in shallow water pools,and I like to mix in electrolytes in my water (more difficult with the narrow Smartwater bottle neck).  I also wanted some sort of backup. So my water system has 4 components:0.75 liter widemouth Gatorade bottle - my main water container when I am hiking0.6 oz BeFree filter for quick clean water access when I am hiking and come across a spring or stream.  Very fast flow, the water bladder is quite functional as a secondary water carry device (it also fits in my shoulder water pouch), and folds up small when empty.2 liter CNOC bladder for filling up in the evening for camp needs and for long water carries.  This bladder works quite well in shallow water situations, which are quite common. Aqua Mira drops
I will typically start the day with the Gatorade bottle filled, then top up as I am hiking with the Befree.  Once I am at camp, I’ll fill the CNOC 2 liter and use the Aqua Mira drops (and wait 30 minutes) to get clean water in bulk for cooking, laundry, and water for the next morning.  I like the built in redundancy for water purification, as the Befree has a reputation for being slightly temperamental.  Clothing - Clothing is very individual.  The only five tips that I think are worthy to share are:MOST IMPORTANT - the start of the trail is a terrible place to learn that your shoes are not a good match for your feet.  I tinkered with shoes/insoles/socks well before I began hiking; my initial set had more than 150 miles on them before I began.  No regrets.Try to have at least one piece of outer clothing (wind jacket, rain coat, fleece) that is blaze orange if you plan to hike in the fall.  I ran into hunters in at least 4 states.  If it was too warm to wear it, I strapped it to the back of my pack.I ended up cutting my buff into two pieces.  Same weight, twice the functionality (eg, headband AND sweat rag, pot holder AND neck gaiter, kneepads for both knees when scrambling).  I didn’t need the full tube for any of these individually.I ordered a rain/wind jacket large enough to go over my fleece or puffy to maximize layering potential. This gave me more combinations to work with when it was cold and a more breathable jacket when it was warm. I wish I had brought a lightweight belt or had an elastic waist on my shorts/pants.  Like almost all thruhikers, I lost weight while hiking; the most immediate effect was that my pants wouldn’t stay up!
       


I am sure my thinking will continue to evolve as I hike North in April, and I will update this summary if I gain any new insights.  Also, obviously, YMMV.  Best of luck to those starting out in GA over the coming weeks - I look forward to reading about your journeys (and hopefully meeting you in person).","

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660012,"Over the past couple of weeks, I’ve given a lot of thought to what has (and has not) been working for me in the first half of my hike.  There’s not a lot of rocket science here - mostly these are small rituals or hacks that have helped me on a day to day basis.  Like my last intermission post on gear, I am sharing my thoughts in the hopes they will be helpful to other AT thruhikers getting ready to start off.  As always, YMMV (your mileage might vary).
Things I will definitely be continuing:
Daily journaling - I happen to use Trail Journals to capture my daily adventures, but I would urge any long distance hiker to make a habit at the end of each day to at least jot down some notes on where you’ve been, where you are staying, who you met, and the day’s highlights.  It’s a nice way to wind down.  Also - days, shelters, and terrain blended together pretty quickly for me, and those notes will help me relive some of the most memorable moments of my trip months/years later. 
Early mover - The more time you walk, the farther you get.  It’s as simple as that.  If you get moving earlier in the morning, you have more daylight to work with.  To make more miles, to smell more roses (there really aren’t that many roses to be sniffed in camp in the morning), to explore more blue blazes, to meet more people.  I am going to try to be on the trail every day no later than 7:30; as my body strengthens I expect to shift that earlier.
Hostels - I did not have sufficient appreciation when I started my thru just how important hostels were in the ecosystem.  For some reason, I associated them with the grungy student hostels of my youth when traveling through Europe, typically across the street from the rail station and pretty seedy.  Not (usually) the case on the AT.  Besides being cheaper than other town stay alternatives, AT hostels played a critical role in building my network and picking up trail intelligence while hiking south.  While I know there will be fewer, I definitely plan to keep an eye out for good hostels as I move NOBO. Mail drops and bounce boxing - I know this is an unpopular opinion, but mail drops really worked for me.  I am enough of a planner that I knew generally which towns and hostels were definite stops for me along the way.  At least once a week I was able to collect a mail drop at a hostel, which significantly simplified food resupply for those items that were difficult to obtain in small Southern Appalachian towns.  Things like high protein oatmeal, the tea I liked, protein supplements, preferred dehydrated dinners, favorite snacks, etc. Not having to rely on menu planning in the aisle of a Dollar General reduced my resupply stress a good bit and allowed me to have a much lighter load in my pack heading out of town (much less packaging and food waste). 
I also bounced a box (actually a 5 gallon plastic pail) of items that I might need - repair, first aid, and hygiene items, a nice top for business calls, maps, a replacement water filter, etc so that I had access to those items every couple of weeks.  It would arrive at a hostel (along with the mail drop), I would pull what I needed, and mail it down the line.  The real hassle with bounce boxes is the remailing - but many hostels seemed to have a process for this that worked well.  I am definitely doing this again.
Dryers - who would have thought that clothes dryers were one of the greatest risks to my clothing system?  But - in a world where you only have 2 pairs of hiking socks, leaving an orphan sock (or dirty girl gaiter, or a zip off leg from my convertible pants) behind in a dryer is a tragedy of Shakespearean proportions.  I never walked away from a clothes dryer before I had physically matched my pairs.
Things that are working for me but I am keeping an eye on:
Working out - I feel strongly that working out before my start was a huge help in managing my enthusiasm and energy level while avoiding injury during the first couple of weeks last fall.  I am committed to toning up in advance of my restart again, but with a couple of changes.  I am going to ease off a bit on incline workouts, as the first 3 weeks of my NOBO hike from Harpers Ferry will be (relatively) flat and there is no point in getting ready for 2000 foot climbs if the most I will see is 1200 foot climbs during that period.  I’ll need to count on the trail to get me ready for the Whites and Southern Maine.  However, I will hit a climbing gym a couple of times this winter, just to get used to rock scrambling and boulder mechanics.  Hopefully it will boost my confidence!Capping my miles in the first two weeks - When I started out last fall, I tried to keep to 10 mile days for the first two weeks to minimize the chance of early repetitive use injury (I also worked hard to get into shape in advance).  This worked out great for my mid-60’s body and joints.  Unfortunately, with my choice of splitting my through across seasons, I am going to need to build trail legs again, so once more I will be limiting my miles at the start.  This time, though, to 12-15 mile days.  I am quite itchy about this: Maryland, PA, and NJ are low elevation states where it is possible to achieve high mile days, but my body won’t be ready yet. Slackpacks/nearos instead of zeros - in my 10 weeks of hiking the southern half, I took 5 zeros.  3 of those were for weather.  I found it was easier for my consistency to walk almost every day, even if I was staying in a town for 2 nights.  I would either replace the “zero” day with a ”nearo” (shorter) day that allowed me to do my chores then head out of town, or stay 2 nights but replace the “zero” day with a slackpack.  Funnily enough, it let me keep pace with some hikers much faster than I who needed zeros to let their bodies recuperate.
I am going to try to use the same approach going north, although with rougher terrain, particularly in NH and Maine, I might need to take more full days off for recovery.  Also, I know I have a couple of external commitments that will force zeros - so some will be baked into the schedule regardless.
Lightweight loadout - I am still planning to have a base weight (excluding food and water) of 12-14 lb, depending on season.  I am mulling the ditching of my cooking set-up in favor of full cold soaking, but at this point don’t expect to make that change. I will probably add in an extra set of underwear (for 3 total) as I expect longer gaps between resupplies and I find that I despise needing to wash clothing at camp in the evenings.  And I (gasp) will probably bring a camp chair with me for the first couple of weeks.  As I plan to throttle my  initial mileage to ease my body back into thruhiking, I know I will be getting into camp by 2 or 3 in the afternoon - making a camp chair much more useful. I’ll ditch the weight as I pick up the miles.Tenting instead of shelters - Advantages of shelters: better protection (generally) from heavy wind and rain.  Faster morning starts as there is less to pack up.  Disadvantages: mice, snoring, higher risk from norovirus and respiratory infections.  I still plan to stay in my tent most of the time - but recognize that my perspective is tainted by the remarkable number of dry nights we had last fall.  
That’s it. Eager to stop thinking and start hiking.","

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660457,"First hike of 2023, and it was a doozy.  As a bit of a refresher, as a PA native I am knocking off the rockiest part of Rocksylvania this winter. This way, if I roll an ankle or shred my shoes, I have plenty of time to recover before the main portion of my hike begins. When I start the 2nd half of my Flip Flop in April, I’ll just skip this section and go directly from Port Clinton to Delaware Water Gap. 
Today’s path continued to follow the Kittatinny Ridge line, which runs for 160 miles in PA.  A nice, flat, peaceful hike…


Kittatinny Ridge walk
until it hit Lehigh Gap, dropped down to Palmerston and the Lehigh River, then rocketed straight back up the other side of the gap. 
 
This climb out of Lehigh Gap is slightly notorious for being the most technical going north (to this point) transiting upwards over 1000 feet through a boulder field, and it required me to stow my poles and use my hands to help pull myself up and over several sketchy cliffs and rock hop almost a mile.

Long way down...
Glad I spent some time at the climbing gym this winter (note that the gym didn’t improve my skill that much, just my confidence)!  Also very happy to be doing it in dry weather.  
About ⅔ of the way up there were some beautiful views back over the river. 
 
It was a gusty day, and hawks soared over the mountain in the updrafts. The Kittatinny Ridge is an important migration route for raptors due to the reliable thermals. It was very enjoyable to relax a bit and watch them. It was also entertaining, if slightly nerve wracking, to watch a small plane try to land at the tiny airstrip near Palmerston with the strong cross winds in place. 
Blue Mountain, the mountain north of Lehigh Gap that I climbed, is a Superfund site after almost a century of zinc smelting. Enormous effort has gone into its remediation, working to transition it from moonscape back to its original state, and the AT has been recently relocated to take advantage of some of that work. I don’t have a perspective on the “before”, but the “after” offered a number of very fine open views as I completed the walk to Little Gap.  It was clear that great care was being taken with the positioning of the new trail corridor - kudos to everyone involved.
I finished at Little Gap, right near the entrance to the Blue Mountain ski resort. The B&B owner I spoke to this morning said that this year had been her worst in 20 years, even worse than Covid, due to the warmth of the winter. The resort itself, which makes its own snow, only had about half the runs open because of the low guest count.  She was looking forward to the upcoming wedding and hiking season to help recover. 
I ended up a bit sore today, from the rocks and because I still have more work to do to get into hiking shape. Due to personal commitments this is my last hike this month: I will do a couple more day hikes in early April then start north from HF on April 23 if all goes well. In the meantime, I am following the adventures of the Nobos starting in GA.  I hope to meet them live around July.","Ashfield Rd, PA 1254.9

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661969,"These last 2 days in Northern PA, from Little Gap to Wind Gap to the Delaware Water Gap, are broadly considered to be the most obnoxiously rocky of the trail. So today, I was  …wait for it… a rock star!
Once more, I spent the day traveling the relatively-flat-but-very-rocky Kittatinny Ridge of Pennsylvania. Kittatinny means “the endless mountain” to the Lenni-Lenape tribe of Native Americans that inhabited the region.  Stretching 185 miles from the Mason Dixon line to the Delaware Water Gap and encompassing 160 miles of the AT, this narrow spine of the Appalachian Mountains looms over the valley below and looks like the Great Wall of China marching southwest to northeast across the state, occasionally punctured by “gaps” that feed traffic from east to west.  A very different feel from the Southern Appalachians.
Today’s weather was unseasonably warm, hitting the low 80’s, with a bluebird sky. The trees have not leafed out yet and are just starting to bud, although the understory shrubs provided a nice burst of green.

Not a green tunnel yet
Despite the absence of leaf cover, there were relatively few views to be had.

Today’s only view
 Just as well - I spent the entire 15 miles focused on my shoes, trying to place each foot with precision to avoid tripping, rolling an ankle, or stepping on a razor sharp rock edge. Happily, I was largely successful, although I was absolutely delighted to finish the day - despite the low elevation change, the concentration and foot movements required have left me a bit sore and tired. 
The hike was otherwise notable for being a full water carry. There has been relatively little rain here so far this year and the water table is pretty low. All the reliable water sources were at least 0.5 miles off trail, so I loaded up my pack in advance. I was glad I did!
Ok, so no views, no water, and lots of rocks. Perhaps not my favorite section of the AT, but I was grateful for the sunshine and the chance to see the forest getting ready to burst into spring.

First signs of spring
 There was almost a feeling of anticipation - leaves budding, sap running, flying insects whizzing giddily through the air, as if they had just woken up. It will be a very different place in a couple of weeks. 
Tomorrow I will complete the Wind Gap to DWG section. It will be a long day with - wait for it - more rocks.","Little Gap, Blue Mountain Drive, PA (1266.0)

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662049,"Okay, perhaps I was a bit harsh in my last entry about the rocks. To be honest, yesterday was a bit of a slog. But today, I had a great time, as the combination of interesting views, more varied terrain, and a more open attitude kept me engaged throughout the day. 
The omens were not initially propitious. It was another hot day with a long water carry (again, I used every drop of my 6-½ lbs of water as the temperature hit an unseasonable 85 degrees); the rocks were supposed to be plentiful with a tricky climb 6 miles in; and I had a deadline to meet. 
To hit my target, I was on the trail at 7am.  However, my mood lifted almost immediately as the soft early morning light filtered through the trees.  I made good time through the first 6 miles, as today the trail provided occasional breaks from the rocks with soft and fast trail that allowed me to pick up time, easing the deadline pressure.  And then the fun started!
First stop was Wolf Rock.  This is a bit of misnomer - it is a rock formation similar to the Knife Edge with large slabs of rock at an angle that needs to be traversed for 200-300 yards.
 
The photo at the top of the entry is possibly the “Wolf” part of the formation, but there was no signage.  It was moderately challenging to traverse but I was able to do so comfortably.  The great thing about this formation is that it created a number of small cliffs on which to perch and look out over the top of the forest below.  One of these became my midmorning break - very peaceful, with a gentle breeze, watching birds flutter in the air at the top of the canopy below.

There were several great view spots today, overlooking both the PA countryside and the Delaware River as I approached Delaware Water Gap (interesting to note that if I had hopped in a canoe from here I could have paddled downstream to within 300 yards of my home).

Delaware River
And finally, there was a side quest along the way to an unmarked, abandoned (copper?) mine in the side of one of the rock formations.  Interesting and a bit creepy at the same time.


Coming to the end of the ridge, I worked my way down to Delaware Water Gap and celebrated the end of my northern PA section with a stop at the Apple Pie bakery before making my way home.

Looking back over the past 80 miles - yes, the rocks are a bit tedious.  But I really enjoyed the scrambling over Knife Edge, Lehigh Gap, and Wolf Rock, and the view from The Pinnacle.  And it was flat.  I am finding that each section has its own charms.
I have now officially hiked more than half of the trail. In 10 days time I will start off full time from Harpers Ferry heading to Maine, skipping over this section I just completed.  It is a bit of a scramble getting everything ready again to be gone for 3 months, but I can’t wait to see the rest.","Wind Gap, PA (1281.4)

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662577,"I returned this weekend to Harpers Ferry, WV to commence my journey NOBO, having completed the HF to Springer section last fall.  Yesterday was the Flip Flop kickoff, a series of workshops for prospective Flip Floppers, including such classics as “What the Funk?” by Jim Fetig, President of the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club.  I had attended this program last year and found it helpful, as well as a nice way to meet some hikers that might be walking south at the same time as I was last fall.  
I picked up my 2023 AT tag - lilac this year, compared to the hot pink of 2022.  As my hike spans both calendar years, I will sport them both on my backpack.  As opposed to last year’s start SOBO in late August, I feel much more settled this year.  Not confident - that would be begging for a Karma visit - but I know my gear and what it can do, and know that there is nothing for the first couple of weeks that I haven’t seen before.  
There are lots of benefits to doing a Flip Flop the way I am doing it, doing the South in the fall and the North in the spring/early summer - fewer crowds, better weather, fall foliage in the Southern Appalachians - but one consequence of doing my flip flop the way I have is there is that there is almost twice as much preparation.  Planning, food prep, logistics.  Organizing finances and my family for a long term absence.  Convincing my long-suffering spouse that this is a splendid idea.  Getting into hiking shape.  I am glad to have that all behind me, and to get back in the saddle.
This morning I started off from my bed and breakfast in historic Harpers Ferry, stopping to admire the confluence of the Potomac and the Shenandoah from Jefferson’s Rock. Shenandoah merges into the Potomac here, and these two rivers have contributed to repeated flooding of the historic section over the years.  It was a beautiful morning, perfect for hiking, and there were a number of other friends out early. 
 The trail crosses the Potomac, enters Maryland (WV is only 4 miles long) and then hits the flattest stretch of the entire AT, 3 miles of canal footpath, before climbing past Weverton Cliffs up to the ridge with excellent views of the Potomac.; I met a number of fellow flipfloppers along the way (Neon, Maybe, Bones), all of whom were as excited as I was to get started. 
It was a relatively gentle day and, by design, relatively short - I was in camp by 1pm. I am try to keep my mileage down for the first 1-2 weeks to ease my body back into the saddle. However, at no point today did I regret having spent the past couple of months getting into shape. 
There are a number of people here at the shelter tonight, a mini bubble caused by the flip flop festival. Lots of introductions and laughter. The temperature is dipping fast, and the down puffy is coming out. It will be in the 30s for the next couple of nights.","Harpers Ferry, WV (1025.4)

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662630,"To obtain your AT thru tag at the Harpers Ferry visitors center, you need to be able to list (or learn) the 7 principles of Leave No Trace:
Plan ahead and prepareTravel and camp on durable surfacesDispose of waste properlyLeave what you findMinimize campfire impactsRespect wildlifeBe respectful of other visitors
While simple in concept, they can be tricky in application.  There is a tree across the trail - do I walk off the trail and around the tree (to leave what I found) or move the tree so that I don’t create any more impact from new temporary trails?  (Answer: move the tree if possible).  Is burning my trash in the camp fire an effective way to dispose of trash? (Answer: No.  It will still attract animals.)
Last night, the topic came up several times as we were eating dinner. More experienced hikers chipped in with coaching on how to do a proper bear hang (although bear safe containers are preferred), what to do with dirty cooking water, and the like.  I was once again struck by what a cooperative enterprise it is that preserves the trail. 
As I had expected, it was cold last night, with a low of 35-36 degrees. After several hours of tweaking, I got to the point where everything was warm except my nose!  I didn’t sleep very well, so welcomed the early dawn and was out of camp promptly. 
Today I am hiking in Maryland (for those of you counting at home, I have now completed 5 states: GA, NC, TN, VA, and WV).   There are only 40ish miles of trail in MD, but a big dose of Civil War history - 10 sites in those 40 miles.  Civil war battlefields and memorials, along with frequent interpretive information, predominate. Combined with estate ruins, an abandoned tomb, and the original Washington monument, it makes the Maryland section quite the historical journey. 
I am finding the overall trail in Maryland very well maintained (more of that cooperative enterprise) and very gentle after the rigors of Georgia and northern PA. It is a nice break, but I don’t expect it to last long.  
Still doing shorter mileage to ramp up - 12 miles today. I got into camp at 3pm after spending a lazy 2 hours over lunch at a campground. Oh, and Dominos delivered!  Several of us shared hot pizza at the campground, jet fuel for the second half of my hike. 
I have met a number of other flip flippers (Hambone, Ziplock, and a couple of women without trail names yet), all slowly making their way north. Looks like it will be a great group to be around for the next 3 months.","Crampton Gap shelter, MD (1036.8)

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662721,"(Quotation above from Sitting Bull)So, I read in another hiker’s trail journal (Paul Mazouac) that the British Science Association determined that spring travels at about 1.9 miles per hour southwest to northeast across the UK.  I thought this was pretty interesting, so looked up the reference. It is measured by asking the public to report their first sighting of several events - including swallows arriving, the flowering of hawthorn, etc. 
Now, let’s assume that the eastern US is roughly similar, and I start hiking northward in early spring. Spring will be advancing at 45.6 miles per day, but I am advancing at, say, 15 miles per day, cutting the speed of transition by ⅓. This means that my spring this year will be 33% longer than if I hadn’t been hiking. 
Is this a new theory of relativity?  A hole in the space-time continuum?  Probably not, but it sure is a great reason to hike north in spring and south in the fall. And for those of you that wonder what kinds of things I think about while hiking 8-10 hours per day - there you have it. 
Last night dropped down to 33 degrees, pretty cold in my book for the reputed early spring. I did some jury rigging of my gear and was able to stay snug and warm, sleeping much better than the previous night. I did discover, to my dismay, that I have a very slow leak in my air mattress (this brand is notoriously fragile), so I will need to do something about that over the next couple of weeks. Right now I just need to reinflate it with a couple of breaths in the middle of the night. Hardly a tragedy. 
I started off about 7:15 this morning, and by 8:30 was perched on Annapolis Rocks, cliffs overlooking the PA farmlands in the valley.In another sign of spring, I was treated to a birdsong symphony. My bird call app tells me that, in a 30 second period, I heard calls from the following bird species:
American goldfinch
Pine warbler
Red bellied woodpecker
Purple finch
Blue jay
Oven bird
House finch
Northern cardinal 
And that does not include the silent hawk swooping in the air currents by the cliffs. It was a terrific way to start the day!
It was another beautiful day for hiking. Maryland began to bare its teeth a bit today with some patches of rocks that are a precursor to Pennsylvania, but also treated me again to some fine trail and pastures.This is my last full day in the state, and I will leave tomorrow with a high regard for the trail here - akin to Tennessee, which I also feel doesn’t get enough recognition. The facilities along this section of the trail have been exceptionally well maintained, providing a great base at the end of each day.
Tonight there was a large, convivial group of section hikers, FlipFloppers (Hambone, Seadog, Weary, Wayfinder, Moonshiner) and Nobos (Surefoot, Prepper, Canary, Sim) at the shelter. The Nobos are moving faster than us - this is likely the last time we see them. Lots of trail magic rumors for the future, and swapping of intel on upcoming resupply points. It is forecast to be a bit warmer (a balmy 40 degrees) tonight so the group is upbeat.","Pine Knob shelter, MD (1049.3)

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662758,"Earworm noun - a song or melody that keeps repeating in one’s mind. Merriam-Webster 
So, with 7-10 hours to kill hiking, it is inevitable that random things will flash through your mind. I’ve been paying attention to the earworms that get trapped in my head lately, and have a couple of observations. 
My earworm of the day is usually triggered by one of my first thoughts on the trail in the morning. Most recently “On the road again,” when I started out of Harpers Ferry; “Off we go, into the wild blue yonder,” when facing an early morning climb.It can morph into a different earworm when I hit specific points in the trail. A rocky patch: “Feelin’ groovy” (slow down, you move too fast). Checking my location: “where are you” morphs to the CSI theme “Who are you”The ideal earworm matches the tempo of my walking speed. There is a marching band song that occasionally pops up in the earworm repertoire when I have a long road walk. Earworms can last for hours. 
It is when I noticed the other day that my earworm had degenerated into “the ants go marching one by one” that I decided enough was enough and threw on some headphones!
Today’s hike began promptly at 7 because I had a shuttle deadline into town. The weather was overcast, and the sun did not break through until later in the day, so I missed the filtered early morning light that I have come to enjoy. 
I crossed the MD/PA border (and the Mason Dixon line) by mid morning. With WV being 4 miles of trail and Maryland 40, it is technically possible to hike in 4 states (VA/WV/MD/PA) in one day - a trail tradition known as the “4 state challenge”. Not me, though. Just happy to have 6 states under my belt. 
Pennsylvania is much longer in terms of trail miles, approximately 230, and is the actual midpoint of most theuhikes. Most NOBO thruhikers will hit it in June/July, when it can be hot, water-challenged, and sport a few too many snakes basking in the sun. I am glad I am coming through this time of year. 
Today’s hike was relatively quiet. We have been noticing some odd things left along the trail over the past couple of days, that people have forgotten or have fallen out of their packs. I choked with laughter when I saw these though - the wicked witch of Pennsylvania must be lying underneath this log!
Tonight I am at a lovely B&B in Waynesboro, PA, picking up food and get a hot shower. Many of the people I have been traveling with are also in town tonight.

It was a stimulating day!  First, I had my first sighting of the little guy above, a red eft (juvenile Eastern newt). They are very common out here, but he is the first one I have stumbled on. He was in the middle of the trail, so I gently ushered him to the side. If he avoids getting squashed by a hiker (or eaten by a predator!), he could have a life span of 12-15 years. 
Then, on the not so cute side, I had my first NOBO sighting of this big guy (timber rattlesnake).
 
 Nothing like an angry rattle to snap you out of a daydream. I waited patiently for him to slither off the trail before proceeding. 
In other news….TRAIL MAGIC!  You might recall that towards the end of my SOBO hike last fall, I ran into Fresh Grounds and his Leapfrog Cafe van at a trailhead (and had some sterling blueberry pancakes and bacon). Today, I ran into him again, 1100 miles north.
 He “leapfrogs” up and down the trail surprising and delighting thruhikers with great cooked meals. Today it was burritos, with all the fixings. Just…magic. 
My original plan had been to have lunch at 65 S barbecue in Fayetteville PA, only a 0.4 mi road walk from the trail. I was too full for lunch, thanks to my second breakfast burrito, but the reputation of the brisket was compelling, so I bought a small amount and carried it in my pack for dinner. Honestly the best brisket I have ever had and, mixed with my dehydrated Santa Fe corn pudding, an outstanding trail meal. 
I need to juggle my schedule a bit for rain that is forecast for the next 3 days, so passed by but did not stay at the Quarry Gap shelter - a shame because it was the nicest shelter I have ever seen, including fresh flowers, a porch swing, and a gnome home.

 The creativity and effort put into this shelter by its (volunteer) caretakers was a pleasure to see. 
Tonight I am camped at a tentsite located midway between two shelters, watching the sun set slowly in the West. Busy day - but the adventure continues. ***(More on the snake!)","Old Forge State Park, PA (1074.6)

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662872,"I was up before dawn and had my tent packed up before the rain was scheduled to start at 6 (there is a big premium to packing up a dry tent instead of a wet tent). Right on cue, the rain started at 6:10 and continued through the rest of the day.   It was a cold rain - perfect hypothermia weather if you are not properly equipped.   Instead of the gentle early light filtering through the trees, it was foggy and a bit foreboding. I kept expecting Little Red Riding Hood and the Big Bad Wolf to come tripping through at any moment. 

Today’s objective was Pine Grove Furnace State park, 14 miles away and home to a hostel (in an old mansion), the AT museum, and the General Store.   A steady stream of hikers sloshed through the trail to get to the hostel for the evening, dressed in multicolored rain gear, rain pants, rain skirts, and umbrellas. It is hopping tonight with hikers eating, swapping trail intelligence, eating, taking hot showers, eating, and drying their clothing. It is alternately steaming hot due to the cranked thermostat and chilly as the door opens to admit another bedraggled member of this fellowship. 
One tradition of this fellowship is the Half-gallon challenge, celebrating the halfway point for thruhikers. If a hiker can consume ½ gallon of ice cream in 30 minutes or less, the General Store celebrates the achievement by awarding a small wooden spoon.  Seriously - have you ever tried to eat ½ gallon of ice cream?  Would you do it to earn a small wooden spoon?  You would be surprised by how many thruhikers both make the attempt and succeed. (Not me, by the way. I settled for a pint of cookies and cream).  
While here, I got a chance to peek into the AT Museum, which houses many of the early artifacts from the founding and development of the trail, as well as profiles of many of the trail’s legends.
It also has some great souvenirs, which I will need to come back for another time - no way I am going to carry additional weight now!

However, the fact that a large group had been gathered at the hostel last night, and it is guaranteed to rain tonight and tomorrow, meant that there was likely to be a crowded situation at the Alec Kennedy shelter tonight (capacity 8). 
Misty web
After 5-6 miles into the hike, it became apparent that it would not be a strenuous day - mostly gentle, graded trail - so I decided to stretch from the planned 15 miles to the shelter to 19 miles to the town of Boiling Springs, and a hostel. So much for my plans to stick to 12mpd day this first week…🙃
The hike itself played out easily, with the exception of a boulder scramble I had not expected at Whiskey Springs. First time I have had to take off my pack and throw it up to be able to scramble over a boulder.  A nice challenge, and a foretaste of things to come further north. 
I was able to successfully make it the full distance, and celebrated by splitting a pizza with Water Boy at Anile’s, an excellent establishment in Boiling Springs.  Boiling Springs has all the potential to be a charming town - but was not on this particular day. The old ATC regional office (the first building the trail passes, no longer owned by the ATC) has a large “condemned” sign on it; the beautiful town pond (fed by the eponymous springs) is drained for construction; and today a tree’s roots had given way and managed to land on top of a car in the town parking lot. Oh well, we all have bad days. 
The hostel I am staying at tonight is someone’s shed, which holds 4 rough bunk beds and a small seating area. This is the 2nd time I have done this - and since the group you are with is small and the hostel is effectively an extension of someone’s home, the experience is highly dependent on the personalities that show up on that particular day. 
The hosts are very kind, and we joined them and their dogs around their fire pit for several hours. 2 of the other hikers were section hikers but highly experienced, and had great stories.  The 3rd was a disappointed thruhiker that needed to get off due to injury, and he received a lot of support. 
While the hostel is rough, it looks water tight for tonight. Thankfully. (PS - miles left in the hike now 3 digits!)","Pine Grove Furnace State Park, PA (1105)

Sometimes you get lucky. 
Okay, perhaps the rain (1.5 in with 100% probability) and forecast thunderstorms didn’t indicate a particularly auspicious start.  Most of the hikers in the area elected to take a zero (except for this little guy). 

 But today’s trek was a flat 11.5 mile hike through pastures and woodland, one of the flattest and easiest sections of the entire trail. Having done some of my training on canal paths at home, I knew I should be able to clock 3mph, and that there was a bed and breakfast booked at the other end where I could dry my gear and resupply.  I also had zero interest in spending a zero day in someone’s backyard shed. 
So I headed out at 7am for a rainy speed walk, sloshing through puddles and mud, barely registering the bucolic beauty of the Cumberland valley farmlands I crossed through, as my head was down to keep the slanting rain off my face.
 When the rain comes down hard, the trail can turn into a river quickly. The only real choice is to walk through it. Although wearing waterproof coat and pants, I was soaked to the skin within 90 minutes. Outside temps were 52 degrees, but I was walking fast enough that I was just able to keep warm. 
And then I got lucky. 
I burst out of the forest onto the trailhead at 11 to find my shuttle driver had arrived early, so I didn’t need to spend time stamping my feet to stay warm while stationary. He had the temperature cranked up and was sanguine about the water dripped on his floor. The bed and breakfast had just finished cleaning my room and let me check in early (also providing hot chocolate and a chocolate chip cookie). Of course it is possible they checked me in early to get the bedraggled hiker out of their lobby. The room had a bathtub, which I immediately hopped into and soaked in until warm again. 
I am now lounging in my room with a relaxing afternoon ahead of me: warm, dry, and 11 miles more up the trail. 
I won’t always be lucky -  sometimes the trail and the weather will throw curveballs at me that I will swing at and miss - but most times, I will take the swing. 
A final thought about forecasting weather, from The Foxfire book, by Eliot Wigginton, which explored the culture of Appalachia. 
IT WILL RAIN:
within three days if the horns of the moon point down.
if leaves show their backs.
if cows are lying down in the pasture.
if there is a ring around the moon. Count the stars in the ring and it will rain within that many days.
if the sun sets with clouds.
within three days, if you see a black snake in a tree.
if an ant covers the hole to his ant hill.
if smoke goes to the ground.
the same time the next day, if the sun shines while it rains.
if earthworms come to the surface of the ground.
if birds fly low.","Boiling Springs, PA (1124.3)

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663020,"*Quote above from Neil degrasse TysonSo, I have been thinking a bit about statistics. 
The other day I heard a very experienced thruhiker state unequivocally that he sleeps with his food rather than hanging it or putting it in a canister. He said that he had hiked more than 12,000 miles and never had a problem with a bear.  He thinks thruhikers should save the weight and time involved with food protection (the fact that he stated this in front of a large group of new thruhikers caused a bit of consternation). 
At the same time, every year on the AT there are occasions where habituated bears try to enter tents looking for food (the one above happened 2 days after we passed through the Annapolis Rocks area). 
How could both be true?
Let’s say there are 3 tent entry incidents on the AT per year (I am guessing - there have already been at least 2 this year). 
And let’s say that the number of opportunities for a bear to enter a tent is ½ of the total camper nights on the AT (assuming ½ the people are in tents). I am guessing that total camper nights is in the area of 600,000, so 300,000 chances per year. 
That means that the odds of having a bear enter your tent on any given night is 3/300,000 or .001%. 
Now our thruhiker would have spent approximately 800 nights on the trail (12,000 miles/15 mpd). If each of those nights he had a .001% chance of a bear encounter, he would have had a 99.2% (.99999 to the 800th power) chance of never having a bear encounter.
So - it appears that while our individual risk might be low, our collective risk is high. 
Ahem.  
Back to my hike. 
Mother Nature struggled to make up her mind today about the weather. It started out sunny, then cloudy, then scattered rain, then cloudy, then sunny, then hail, then cloudy, then scattered rain…you get the idea. What this means is that I spent most of my hike today taking off and putting back on my layers. 
The hike itself also had a lot of variability - smooth bits (at first)
 then pastures,

 then a transition to rocks. The final approach to Duncannon had a beautiful view from Hawk Rock
 and then plunged down steeply to town. 
I found that my legs were a bit “dead” today - after the efforts of the past two days, I felt much more sluggish on the (relatively minor) ascents in this section. But I treated myself to a Snickers when I arrived in Duncannon, so I am sure that will work its magic. 
Tonight I am staying at the Doyle hotel, a rite of passage for thruhikers. Originally built in the 1770’s, it burned down and was rebuilt in 1905, then was renamed the “Doyle” in the 40’s.
 As the AT runs through the middle of town, the Doyle has been hosting thruhikers forever, and is legendary for its burgers, beer, and extremely cheap rooms. 
Unfortunately, I arrived on a Monday, when the bar is closed, so only get to experience the very atmospheric lodging (which suggest neglible investment since the 1940’s).
   
I have seen one hiker I recognize in town (Seadog, who was kind enough to share a Yuengling with me). Pushing forward over the past couple of days has put me slightly ahead of the bubble I was floating in - a shame, as there are several hikers I would like to know better. But given the vagaries of schedules, zero days, and trail legs I am sure I will see some of them again over the next couple of weeks.

Most hikers will start the day at Goodies restaurant with an amazing breakfast, enticing you to stay. The standard pancake order is for 3 - I saw one order go by and swiftly changed my order to one. It covered the entire plate (the “hiker challenge” is for 8).  
Then, on your way out of town, you will need to play chicken on the railroad tracks. It is not uncommon for the trail crossing to be entirely blocked by a long, extended line of rail cars. Those buying for a Darwin Award climb over or under these; the more sober minded hike the long way around. Thankfully, I was not blocked today.
 
On your way up the 1000 ft climb out of Duncannon, you are greeted by lush meadows of poison ivy.
 
And at the top of the climb, there is a half mile boulder crawl to navigate.
 
Oh, Duncannon, I will miss you!
Other notes from today’s hike - the climb out of Duncannon took me back up to the Kittatinny Ridge, and wandered back and forth over the ridge for the rest of the day. We passed by the site of a recent forest fire (earlier in April) that had temporarily closed the trail.
  When it hasn’t been pouring rain, the fire danger has been posted as high due to the very dry winter and spring in this area. 
The weather was brooding for most of the day, but there were a number of great views.
 Temps are forecast to be in the 30’s tonight, and as I tap this out in the shelter tonight I am wrapped up in a fleece, my down jacket, and my sleeping bag.

Clearly, April showers have not yet brought May flowers!  However, it was pretty good weather for putting my head down and grinding out a long day.   
I was really struck on this trail section by the level of craft displayed by the trail builders and maintainers in this area. Using the abundance of rocks, they have created stone bridges,
 stone chairs at campsites, stone steps to assist with elevation changes, and stone channels for springs and water flooding to prevent trail erosion.
 Some of these rocks are massive in weight…the stone bridge piece would have weighed close to 4000 lbs based on its dimensions. I can not imagine how they were put in place.  But the artisanship really showed. 
I bumped into a hiker (Spot) today as he works on his 8th thruhike. His plan this year is to start in PA, hike south to Georgia, then hike from Georgia to Maine. He said he didn’t want to pay the bus ticket to ride to GA to start so he was going to hike there (!)
Tonight at the shelter we had our first fire, having transited out of the fire ban area. The magician who made this happen with wet wood, Logan, is completing the 3rd leg of his triple crown, having already completed the PCT and CDT. From Luxembourg, he is sponsored by multiple organizations as he works to raise money to fight children’s cancer.

The first obstacle today was a beaver dam that has flooded a section of trail.Crossing is possible but tricky, requiring carefully picking your way over semi-submerged, slippery logs for approximately 25 yards.

I am happy to report I made it!  I basked in the glow of this success for several miles, and got serious cred points from the other hikers this evening. 
Then, of course, there were lots of rocks, plus 2 boulder fields to pick through. I did wonder, when I saw this tree, just how hungry the woodpecker was. Do woodpeckers get hangry?

The sleep and extra carbs were helpful today.

I managed to execute my first full face plant today, after several weeks of pretty good performance.  And, of course, it was not one of the hairy boulder traverses but a stupid little tripping rock.

Credit:Kirklandii.comBright and early this morning, I got on my way to hike into Port Clinton to meet Mr. Right, who was going to shuttle me up to Delaware Water Gap (along with his trusty sidekick, our 6 year old dog).  It was a short day of hiking, only 9 miles, and I hiked much of it with Ultra who was also looking to meet a ride in Port Clinton. 
The weather was beautiful - such a nice change from last week - and the conversation made the miles fly by quickly. We also bumped into Just Ron, who was getting picked up by Mrs. Ron (did I mention all the logistical conversations yesterday?).
Rocks, of course, today, but no worse than previous days. There were two hurdles to overcome: a very steep drop off into Port Clinton (thank heavens it was dry and I had good trekking poles) and crossing another active railway (4 tracks total).
 A short stroll into town and then - Pennsylvania was done!
Sadly, we got some updates on other hikers we had been hiking with, all off trail for relatively minor issues that had turned big: one hiker who, after making it 18 miles through rocks tripped on a root 25 yds from the shelter and ended up in the ER with a concussion and skull/facial lacerations; one hiker whose blisters had become infected, growing into cellulitis that has required foot surgery; and a final hiker whose plantar fasciitis grew to the point that she could no longer continue. All of these hikers were warriors who would have conquered the mountains, but had to leave the trail before they got the chance.  It is a very humbling reminder just how much luck has to do with succeeding.  
As I had a couple of extra minutes before my pickup, I wandered down to Frank’s barbershop,
 an iconic stop on the trail in this area. A combination of old town barber (2 barbers, 4 customers milling around), antique and numismatic shop, and town square, this little slice of heaven also offers a generous welcome to AT hikers (snacks, coffee, tips, shuttles, charging, and a place to take a load off). I was totally charmed by the entire experience, and would have loved to spend an afternoon there as a fly on the wall.

The weather was perfect for hiking: sunny, slightly breezy, and in the high 60’s - low 70’s.  The hike started by crossing the Delaware, then climbed back up to the ridge line, passing by Dunnfield Creek on the way.
 As I had a relatively short (14 mile) hike planned for the day, I was able to pause and actually read some of the interpretive signage along the way. Bet you didn’t know the state fish for New Jersey is the trout. I grew up in NJ, and I sure didn’t. 
Sunfish Pond sits at the beginning of the ridge line, the first glacial lake on the AT as it heads north.
 As a youngster, Scouting and school groups would come up here, and it was interesting to see it with adult eyes. I perched at an outlook above the lake for a snack, and heard bird calls from a blue jay, downy woodpecker, eastern towhee, scarlet tanager, and the oven bird who seems to have been following me for 2 weeks (it is the most common bird call I encounter). 
The ridge line was beautiful,
 opening up in a number of places to 180 degree views and at Raccoon Ridge, to a 360 degree view, certainly the finest of the last 2 weeks. Many day hikers were out today, and I was stopped a number of times with questions about thru hiking. 
I dawdled along the way, taking photos of critters,
 stopping for lunch at the AMC Mohican Center, and checking out a fire tower (it had a no trespassing sign on it so of course I didn’t climb it…).

The southern half continues along the Kittatinny Ridge that I walked in PA and also continues with the rocks - although there were a couple of stretches today that were blessedly free. 
 NJ also has the highest density of black bears on the trail, and I saw one today (an adolescent), scampering across the road before I could get a picture. It was a good day for wildlife (and inferred wildlife), as I passed by evidence of beaver activity and watched soaring hawks again on my break on a cliff. On the other hand, it was a bad day for wildlife, as insect populations (primarily gnats) exploded, hovering in a cloud around my face. There have been tick reports, so the nightly tick checks have started. 
Temperatures have warmed, a real blessing in the evening but not during the day. I underestimated how much fluid I would need and ended up pretty thirsty before finding a stream to refill.  Warming temps also mean the May wildflowers are starting to sprout.

The trail included green tunnel, pastures, and beaver bogs. I was amused to see that the beavers had chewed ⅞ of the way through each of these trees, which looked like they might come crashing down if their own accord in a gentle breeze. 
It was quiet again on the trail - very few day hikers, and the NOBO and Flip Flop bubbles are a couple of days behind.

This section of NJ is lower-lying, and traverses a lot of boggy/swampy ground. Boardwalks or planks were the order of the day in many places. The trail itself wove through the Wallkill National Wildlife refuge, a swampy ecosystem that was swarming with bird life (particularly blackbirds) - and I think I also spotted some otters.
 Shortly afterwards, there was a mile long boardwalk section through the Pochuck wetlands. Kudos to the trail designers (and maintainers) for creating such an innovative trail experience.

Fortunately, it was not as fearsome as the name - my first clue being the large number of day hikers, including a sizable representation in the 2-8 year old group, that were coming down happily chattering. It culminated in a lovely view near the top. 
I arrived at the shelter with an entirely new group of section hikers and flip floppers, having shifted places again in the bubble. Some continued on to the Warwick Drivein (there is a drivein theater that allows backpackers to camp in the back), but having just returned from my zero I passed. 
The wildlife was a little thin today, but I did spot a cute garter snake. 

Following the journals of those ahead of me, it looks like there will be some rock acrobatics over the next couple of days. Whee!","Vernon, NJ (1360.4)

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663853,"(Today’s earworm: “New York, New York”)
To be honest, New York has kind of worried me all winter.  Everyone knows that NH and Maine are the big challenge of the northern half, but NY has some wicked rock formations that turn slick as ice when it rains. She lurks like a shark in the shallows, teeth bared for unsuspecting hikers looking too far ahead in their hike. Many a thruhiker has left a blood trail through the state. 
So, ready to spit in its eye, I was up and out early this morning. The sunrise light was, as always, beautiful and the trail passed by some blooming wisteria. I crossed into NY by 9am and was soon admiring the view from Prospect Rock, the highest point on the AT in NY. 
And then the fun began. Rebar. Vertical rock climbs. Cliff walks. No, we were no longer in Kansas. 
Happily, this piece of chum managed to avoid the sharp teeth today. I slowed down considerably and gave a lot of thought to foot and hand placement. Turns out that spell in the climbing gym this winter actually paid off. 
There was some payoff, though…another creamery!  (Astute readers will note this is the 2nd creamery in 3 days). Bellvale Creamery was only 0.2 miles off the trail, and was a terrific ice cream stopoff with a great view of the valley below.  
Tomorrow is another day of rock climbing, and then my intelligence suggests it will level out for a period. I will be swimming fast!","Wawayanda Shelter, NJ (1365.4)

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663883,"So, I have been thinking a bit about the measurement of mileage on the AT. I’ve noticed that the miles recorded on my watch (normally quite accurate) are running a bit long on the rocky sections. I think this is because I bob and weave as I work my way through, while the trail mileage is supposed to measure the centerline. 
But the measurement of trail distances is  important for all kinds of reasons, and the AT length was first measured by Myron Avery, Chair of the ATC and credited with the construction of the end to end trail, in the 30’s. He used the wheel shown above and rolled it along the entire span of the trail to get an accurate reading. 
My question: how did he roll it along the centerline of the trail in sections like this??! (Buchanan Mountain, scaled today). 

We were blessed again today with beautiful hiking weather, with clear skies and temps in the mid 70’s.  It was the first full day in NY, which has 93 trail miles and lots of trail side delis to enjoy (deli-blazing is a thing). 
But today was a doozy. After the first 3 miles (including the lovely Fitzgerald Falls),
 the terrain really stepped up in difficulty.  Buchanan mountain (above) was a boulder scramble to get up, followed by Arden Mountain. Then the charmingly named Agony Grind, a very steep and rocky downward slope.  The final obstacle was the Lemon Squeezer, a narrow gap between two rock slabs followed by a vertical climb (note to future NOBOs - the best route is to the right).  The entire day was peppered with micro climbs and descents, amplifying the challenge. 
My fellow hikers, as they stagger into the shelter tonight, have a uniformly stunned expression on their faces. From personal experience, this doesn’t fade for about an hour. I am sure we will look back at this when we are in the Whites and laugh, but for tonight we feel like heroes for making it through. 
When I got to the shelter tonight, Strobes was resting up prior to moving on to the next shelter. He has a small business manufacturing camping gear, and he gifted me a very cool (and waterproof) DCF wallet. 

I was very touched, and hope to see him up the trail.","Wildcat Shelter, NY (1377.7)

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663948,"I crossed this point about halfway through the hike today. A previous hiker had carefully constructed the milepost for all of those heading north. Still about 800 miles to go, though. 
After yesterday’s acrobatics, today’s hike was a bit closer to the normal range. Long, yes. Rocky, yes. And still a bit of scrambling, but all well within the realm of what a thoughtful person might consider. 
As I had phone calls in the late afternoon today, and a long hike planned, I got an early start. The wake-up alarm was not required, as an insistent whippoorwill serenaded the entire tent site at the crack of dawn. But the benefit was to enjoy the peaceful morning light through the trees.
 
Today’s route crossed the Palisades Parkway, a very busy highway in NY.  Up until last year, intrepid hikers needed to dash across 4 lanes of traffic with questionable sight lines. Unfortunately, a hiker was struck and killed. The AT has been temporarily rerouted until a permanent solution can be found; this added 1.25 miles to the hike today but actually delivered a lovely woodland hike combined with spectacular views from West Mountain.  
The day finished with a long climb up Bear Mountain to the fire tower, followed by a zillion steps downward toward to the town of Ft Montgomery. Bear Mountain has a number of beautiful outlooks and hiking trails, as well as some stylish benches to soak in the view.
 
I was exhausted at the end of today’s hike, but a good exhausted - I had covered lots of territory, climbed up and down lots of elevation, and enjoyed the views throughout the day. I am staying in a hotel tonight without laundry service, so it looks like a bathtub washing machine tonight.","Fingerboard shelter, NY (1392.1)

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664009,"Just kidding. This particular bear was lounging at the Trailside Zoo, the only zoo located on the Appalachian Trail (the trail actually cuts right through it). I hiked through there today, and thought I would take the only calm picture I am likely to get of a bear on this journey. The zoo itself was underwhelming, acting mostly as a refuge for disabled or abandoned animals (the two bears their had been abandoned by their owner). But it is part of the AT legend, and I thought I would take a peek. 

Today’s hike was in reverse, as I was staying two nights in Fort Montgomery.  I was shuttled up to a trailhead to the north in the am, and hiked back to my hotel. This let me hit the zoo (which has limited hours) as well as make a detour up to Anthony’s Nose, a prominent viewpoint over the Hudson River with sweeping views.  I had the foresight to purchase a great sub at the Appalachian market deli in the morning, and ate it up at the overlook. 
The weather started off a bit nippy (freeze warning in the middle of May??!), but warmed up enough to be perfect for hiking. The trail was, for once, fairly normal, and I was able to make good time. As I hiked in reverse, I ran into a lot of hikers I knew and caught up on the news. One hiker showed off his new hiking shoes, another cautioned me about the safe way to cross the Bear Mountain bridge, and a 3rd reported on a 4th who it appears has come down with giardia, a distressing waterborne illness that has popped up several times this week. 
I had a good dinner tonight at the Bear Mountain Inn, a grand old building at the base of the mountain. 

Laundry (hand washed in the bathtub) and resupply are done, and tomorrow I will head out with the objective of finishing NY in the next 3-4 days.","Bear Mountain, NY (1409.6)

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664045,"Today’s trail was the usual blend of green tunnel and rocks, with numerous ups and downs for no clear purpose.  With one major exception: the telephone shown in the picture above was positioned next to the path, not connected to any electricity or phone line. Curious. The signage described it as the Telephone of the Wind. Copied below is the explanation:
This Telephone of the Wind is for all who grieve. You are welcome to find solace here. 
Please use it to connect with those you have lost. To feel the comfort of their memory. 
May you hear their voices in the wind. May you be at peace with your losses. 
It is modeled after an installation in Japan where, following the 2011 tsunami, thousands found comfort. 
It caused me to reflect on how many of my fellow hikers (I would guess about ⅓) are on a journey of recovery, many from bereavement - and how appropriate it was to find this telephone here in the middle of the forest, which at times can feel a very spiritual place. Just when you think you know what is around the next corner, something surprises you. 
I find it interesting as we hike through different trail maintenance areas how the style and approach to trail design varies. Vertical climbs vs switchbacks, steps of stone vs steps of wood vs no steps, different approaches to managing water flow to prevent erosion, different standards on blowdown clearance, etc. In this area, the stonework has been notable, and I was particularly impressed today to spot this raised trail section (note the curved stone retaining wall on the right). That is a huge amount of work. 
Relatively few views today, with only this long shot of Lake Canopus. As I said, a green tunnel day. 
Tonight I am at RPH shelter, a beloved fixture on the trail due to its 4 sides, large grassy area, lounge chairs, and pizza delivery. Right now it is the lounge chair which is the best feature; I was tired today with no real “oomph” and have 3 bigger days coming up.

I am sharing the shelter tonight with a mother and her very active 6 year old daughter out for her first hike. I don’t think the rain is exactly what they had planned for, and I have played I Spy with her for 45 minutes so far. Do you know how many “green” things there are when you are looking from a shelter???  And don’t get me started on brown. 
The good news is that the shelter appears to be stormworthy and the rain is expected to taper off tonight. The next couple of days should be good hiking weather. 
I am slightly revising my take on NY. The trail today was relatively smooth, and despite the greater elevation changes it was easier to get the additional miles in. The area that the trail traversed was pretty, possibly with good views, although it was difficult to tell during today’s rain.  I did have the red efts, though. 
 
I should mention that there was the obligatory deli stop this morning that fortified me with a PB&J bagel plus a great deli sandwich for lunch. I would say that this could become a habit, but I think the gravy train ends as I enter CT. 
Some of the NY shelters have a nice feature - a Lending Library at the shelter.  This one has an eclectic mix: 
I am glad I powered through the rain today, rather than take a zero.

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664192,"Well, New York certainly saved its best for last. Starting with a beautiful sunrise that pierced the morning mist (especially welcome after last night’s rain), today’s trail wound through almost every ecosystem present in the state. I walked through wetlands, bogs, meadows, pastures(with their attendant hazards for unwary hikers),  and blessedly smooth forest trails. Even the city ecosystem was represented by the only Appalachian Trail train stop. 
While all is not forgotten, it was a nice gesture.
After 10 miles I crossed into Connecticut, my 10th state and the beginning of New England. There are only 52 miles of trail here, so this state will fly by.   Of course, this state is also known for being ground zero for Lyme disease. The information at the trailheads has been excellent, and convinced me to take one more step to style suicide by tucking my pants legs into my gaiters. 
Along my route today, I spotted some Chicken of the Woods, an edible orange fungus that grows on dead trees. Some thruhikers forage as they go, using this as a mushroom type supplement for their meals. Ramps are also popular and, of course, blueberries when in season. 
Today’s hike was a relatively big day for me in mileage and elevation, but the terrain allowed me to motor through - plus, I think I am starting to get my trail legs.

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664234,"It was a quiet evening at the tent site last night - I had the whole thing to myself. I have noticed the gaps increasing in the thru hiker mini-bubble that formed after the Flip Flop kickoff in late April. Hikers moving at different paces, injuries and illness, rain, zeros- all are creating occasional air bubbles in the pipe. I have not seen another thruhiker for 2 days. 
Today’s hike had me thinking a lot about resilience and adaptability. It had both some of the easiest hiking on the entire AT (5 miles of flat path paralleling the Housatonic, shown above), and a steep, rocky, and tricky descent down St John’s Ledges.
A bit of whiplash, to be honest. I am finding that always holding something in reserve is a good strategy to be ready for what is getting thrown at us. 
Another example of adaptability?  Oak galls.
I have seen these a lot on the hike, and don’t recall having seen them before. “Oh,” I thought, “I wonder what kind of fruit this is?”  Hah. 
An oak gall is actually a larvae nursery for the gall wasp. According to Wikipedia (the source of all truth), they:
are caused by chemicals injected by the larva of certain kinds of gall wasp in the family Cynipidae. The adult female wasp lays single eggs in developing leaf buds. The wasp larvae feed on the gall tissue resulting from their secretions, which modify the oak bud into the gall, a structure that protects the developing larvae until they undergo metamorphosis into adults.

You will be happy to know that I did not impulsively chow down on one!
After today’s hike, I am now off for 2-½ days to celebrate my mother’s 90th birthday with my siblings.

The trail today was primarily a rolling woodland path. Limited views, but the sun played through the trees and the treadway was very manageable. Large banks of fragrant ferns perfumed the air.  
I have been walking through azalea and rhododendron groves for the past 1500 miles without ever seeing them in bloom. I think we are probably still a couple of weeks away, but I got a peek at some early azaleas.

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664474,"700 miles to go!So today I saw both of these signs within about a mile of each other. Both true and accurate reflections of my hike - and both yielding different emotions. 
I feel great that I’ve covered 1500 miles so far. This is at least 1400 miles more than any hike I had done to date, and has been filled with wonderful people, experiences, and sights. 
But 700 miles more gives one pause. That’s a lot of miles - almost 1.5 MM more steps to go!  I am currently clocking about 90-100 miles per week, but with an anticipated slow down in NH and Maine I probably have another 8 weeks to go. 
I am not concerned or disheartened, just find it fascinating to see how different the emotions are that are triggered by these two converse descriptions of where I am right now on my hike.  
Speaking of my hike - today was pretty great. The morning kicked off with a breakfast stop at a farm to table cafe just off the trail that was outstanding, and powered me through the day. This was followed by a particularly lovely section of trail along the Housatonic River that was flat and carefully graded to permit wheelchair access.
Lots of songbirds along this stretch, including the Northern and Louisiana water thrushes (first time spotted by my app!). 
In contrast to yesterday, I was also treated to some beautiful open views, including Great Falls, some meadow views, and this one from Lion’s Head. 

I crossed paths with a crew of trail maintainers who were shoring up an eroded section of trail and adding some steps. This maintainer was particularly proud of the retaining wall they had just built. 

I am at Brassie Brook campsite tonight, which is nicely configured. It is both cool and buggy tonight, so I am wearing the unusual combination of my puffy jacket plus a headnet.

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664549,"If yesterday was pretty great, today’s hike was spectacular (if a bit challenging) through the South Taconics.  The morning started by scaling Bear Mountain, the highest peak in CT. This little section of the AT in CT may be the only part of the state where one can actually get a ruggged hiking experience, and the climb up was a good wake-up. For some reason, these early morning elevation gains on fresh legs s seem so much less of an effort - almost flowing up the mountain as opposed to the afternoon slogs. Great views at the top. 
Shortly afterwards I entered Massachusetts, my 11th state.
 MA has lots of personal associations for me, having lived and worked in Boston and having multiple family members go to school here. It is another short trail state (90 miles), but I am looking forward to Williamstown (where 4 of those family members went to college) and Mt Greylock, made famous in the Harry Potter series as home to Ilvormorny, the NA school of wizardry.
I passed through Sage’s Ravine, a beautiful canyon through an old hemlock forest sliced by Sawmill Brook. So peaceful here - it could entice you to stay forever, listening to the hypnotic sound of the water spilling over the rocks. 
The next waypoint was Mt Race, which featured a slab rock traverse of the summit with 180 degree views. Best views of the trip north so far, I think - the kind that make you freeze in mid-stride as the scenery opens up around you.
  
And then…Mt Everett. Described in FarOut as a “grueling climb”, it delivered, with a steep enough grade that it required wood steps to be anchored into some of the rock faces. I learned in the south to “never look a mountain in the eye”, eg to focus on the 5 feet in front of you instead of continuously scanning how much farther you have to climb. I just put my head down and ground it out and - before I knew it - was at the top. There I met Man Cub (NOBO), Rick (Flip flopper), and Jem, a ridge runner. Jem was a fount of knowledge about the area, and also provided us with discount passes for upcoming AMC sites (soup and baked goods at the huts). She is a great asset to the trail!
After all those climbs, my focus was on descending carefully to Great Barrington. I really rode the brakes all the way down, as the alternative wasn’t that attractive (another hiker ended up in the ER today after doing a header in this section).

 and the moss covered base of an old tree. 
 
I was dropped off at the trail by Papa Joe, a trail angel in Great Barrington who ferries around hikers on a donation (gas money) basis. He was the first person called by the injured hiker yesterday, and sat with her in the ER while she was awaiting treatment. He’s full of useful information about both the town and the trail. I’ve mentioned before that there are people like this up and down the AT who support thruhikers; their generosity of spirit is astonishing. Another trail angel left some hand carved walking sticks (plus water and juice) for hikers on their way out of Great Barrington. 
 
I am stopping off tonight at South Wilcox shelter, even though I could probably have made it another 2 miles to North Wilcox shelter. Thought process: it is Memorial Day weekend and North Wilcox is closer to a road.  As much as I enjoy spending time with section hikers (who can have a much more nuanced view of the world than blinkered thruhikers), locals partying at shelters is an experience to be avoided if possible.  We’ll see if the gambit works. Follow up note: two other thruhikers came into the campsite and stayed in the shelter.

There are several benches there that provide lovely, contemplative views of the church and its cemetery.  It is Memorial Day, and I saw a number of day hikers there looking quietly. Enough said. 
A surprise today was the perfect retail option for an AT trail food stop. It was a small farm stand that contained a refrigerator, Wi-Fi router, and snacks, cold drinks, ice cream, and fresh eggs.
Everything was on the honor system (Venmo bar code provided), and the Wi-Fi hot spot in the middle of a cell signal desert was a huge draw.  I got myself an ice cream sandwich - probably a mistake, given that I had a 1000’ climb next. 
The rest of the hike was old growth forest, pines, bogs, and pastures.  Very rural. 
Tonight I am staying at Upper Goose Pond cabin. If you had asked me to imagine the perfect shelter for thruhikers on the AT, I would have failed to adequately describe this location, which sits on (naturally) Upper Goose Pond, a stunning body of water situated in the Berkshires.
 It is a 2 story structure with bunk room above, sitting room below, and porch out front with rocking chairs.

 There is canoeing and swimming in the lake, and a pancake breakfast. 
Sooo relaxing. It reminds me of the summer camp in NH I attended when I was young. There are 8-10 hikers here tonight (drawn like moths to a flame), and it is a very convivial gathering.  Several hikers are planning on spending an extra zero day here tomorrow. In trail speak, that makes this place a “vortex” - a place you visit and have trouble leaving.

The character of the trail is changing as we progress through the Berkshires, and I am starting to again see the fir forests that I saw in the Smokies.  I am also seeing a lot more roots in the trail, which are slightly less annoying than rocks but offer the same potential for tripping and stubbed toes (both of which I saw today). 
The one view that I saw that was special was this one:

The Cookie Lady returns!  This is the original “Cookie Lady” location, but with a new owner providing the same trail angel assistance as before (rumor is that is was a condition in the sale contract). 100 yards off trail, hikers are offered a glass of cold hibiscus tea, freshly baked cookies, and water fill-ups, plus rocking chairs on the porch. If you help with the weeding of their blueberry plants (it is a farm), you can score a home cooked meal. 
From my past couple of entries, it may appear that food plays a disproportionate role.  My only excuse is that our diet is relatively spartan and the exertions intense, and the opportunity to chill out in the  middle of a warm day with a cold drink is a great treat. 
Two days ago i had a lot of water crossings and, for grins, I took pictures of each of them to capture the variation in experience across the day (and of course there are highway bridges, suspension bridges, covered bridges, etc., just not on this day):
 
I thought of these bridges today while chatting with several hikers about why they were hiking. Leaving the military, divorce, college graduation, retirement - so many use a thruhike as a bridge to something new…they just don’t know what yet.

There were lots of good reasons to do it (chief being that the temperature is supposed to spike to the high 89 tomorrow and this gives me a shorter day), but it is the kind of thing that looms over you all day. As in: I need to get up early so it won’t be too hot when I do that climb, or I need to eat a big lunch so I’ll have energy for that climb. 
The climb itself was ⅔ up Mt Greylock, which I will summit tomorrow. And it turns out it was not the end of the world, as the trail was reasonably graded for the majority of the time. Of course, if I can’t do this climb at this point, NH and ME are going to be really ugly.  So the big girl pants went on, and up I went. 
Other notable features of today’s hike: breakfast in the town of Dalton (where I couldn’t shake the impression that the citizenry have mixed emotions about the hikers going through their town), and the first monument to cheese I have seen on the trail, in Cheshire. I am sure the town is quite proud. 
The rest of the trail was green tunnel today, mostly peaceful and not too challenging. I have been surprised by how many bogs exist at elevation in MA - which leads to board walks and mosquitoes, neither one being a positive add.  There was one very nice view, from Cheshire Cobble, where I had lunch.  
Tonight’s shelter had some extremely hungry mosquitoes, so I have taken early refuge in my tent. Two college age young men just arrived, apparently on the first day of their hike.

The air was perfumed by spruce, I think - always evocative of the holidays for me. I hit the summit at 8, when the temperature was still 66 degrees (later to hit 89), so mission accomplished. 
I mentioned a couple of days ago that MA has a number of personal associations for me. One is that my grandfather, father, brother and nephew all attended college at WilIiams, which is located nearby and holds an annual Mountain Day where classes are cancelled and the undergraduates climb Greylock (along with other outdoor activities). I was struck by Thoreau’s quote above which is etched on a rock near the peak.
 
The summit of Greylock is capped by a memorial tower with 360 degree views of the area. I dropped my pack and scampered up the 89 steps of the spiral staircase to see where I had come from and where I was going.
 When you are in the green tunnel, you get less of an opportunity to do this than one might think. Great views, but poor pictures due to the haze. I also took the opportunity to stop in at the Bascom Lodge next to the tower for one of their signature blueberry muffins.

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665000,"I have a colleague that speaks about the race between Scott and Amundsen to the South Pole as an example of leadership styles.  Amundsen’s team made a point of making progress each day. Scott’s team waited for better weather windows (obviously I am oversimplifying the events during the expeditions, but this was an important difference). Amundsen’s team reached the South Pole first and returned safely; Scott and several of his team ran out of food and perished in the attempt.  Moral of his story: grind out the miles, or progress, each day rather than waiting for the perfect opportunity. 
So today, with the temperature forecast to hit the high 80’s again, with thunderstorms forecast for early afternoon, I …hiked.   Fast, so I could get to a shelter by 2. But putting miles on the board each day works for me. 
The day started with the last 4 miles of the MA trail, a well graded 1600 foot climb, with the exception of one section of rocks, a bit of a kick in the pants for leaving the state. 
Then I hit the Vermont border - 11 states down, 3 to go!  Vermont’s 150 miles begin the transition to a more rugged terrain that will accelerate through NH and ME. The nickname “Vermud” derives from the propensity of the trail here to transition to mud at the suggestion of rain - and while the trail did get more rugged, I did not (today) experience too much mud. 
I did see several beaver ponds, and lots of signs of beaver activity.Sadly, though, no beavers chose to make an appearance. 
Tonight the shelter is full with other hikers also taking refuge from the forecast thunderstorms. It’s a tricky trade off - as we are all sitting ducks for the mosquitoes in the shelter - but no one enjoys packing up a wet tent. 
I am looking forward to seeing more of Vermont tomorrow.","Williamstown, MA (1600.6)

We were all snug in the shelter which was thankfully waterproof, if not bug proof. I now have an interesting array of mosquito bites which take turns itching. No black flies yet, though. 
When I woke up, forecast highs had dropped almost 25 degrees. It was great hiking weather for the morning climb, but I began to understand the “Vermud” moniker, as the previous night’s rain resulted in numerous mud patches that needed to be carefully picked through. 
During the day’s climb up to 3600 ft, the trail transitioned from hardwoods to evergreen forests and trees furred with moss.
 Clouds were low, and the trail took us up into the misty cloud layer for the afternoon with another temperature drop to the 40’s. Out came the cold weather gear that seemed like excess baggage yesterday!  A highlight of today was running into Willie, another Trail Journals correspondent who has been hiking a week ahead of me.  I always keep an eye on her entries to get tips for what is coming up  I hope we get to reconnect up the trail

It was a long mileage  and elevation day, as I was working to set myself up for a resupply visit in town tomorrow. Goddard shelter is near the top of Glastenbury Mountain, so I was hoping to start the day off with some great views from the fire tower at the summit. Nope. The fire tower has been rated unsafe, so there was no ladder. 
The next part of the hike was down off Glastenbury, back through evergreen forests. I startled a porcupine on the trail, my first sighting of the hike. I wasn’t fast enough to snap a picture as he waddled off, but was entranced by his silvery quills. 
The big challenge of the day was climbing up and over Stratton Mountain, at 3936 feet the highest peak in Southern VT. It is also purported to be the location where Benton Mackaye conceived of the Appalachian Trail.  We expected great views here but were foiled once more as the low cloud layer blanked everything out. 
Climbing down, we reached scenic Stratton Pond and settled in for the night, finally getting great views over the lake.One hopeful hiker was fishing, but I think he stayed hungry.

The rocks have abated somewhat - and their replacement, a deep leafy mix - is gentle on my footsteps. 
There was a nice overlook of Manchester Center from Prospect Rock, a positive change after the green tunnels/foggy views of the past couple of days. Getting a bit of sun as I dropped down in elevation was uplifting. 
I laughed when I saw this license plate in the trailhead parking lot. “Hiker trash” is a name we wear with pride as we re-enter civilization - dirty, smelly, and a bit sketchy - our challenges, adventures and experiences sometimes too difficult to describe to normal folk.  There is something about thru hiking that is a great equalizer. If you have done the last 15 miles with me, it doesn’t really matter if you are a CEO, construction worker, or circus clown.  The shared experience creates a unique bond. 
I am staying at a hotel this evening, primarily for the bandwidth for a couple of business calls.

The “box” (actually a 5 gallon pail) holds spare repair items, toiletries, contacts, maps, etc that I don’t want to carry the whole time but want to be able to periodically access.  
It was just as well that the day was short though. The air quality index has deteriorated rapidly over the past couple of days due to wildfires in Quebec. I can’t feel it, but is sure has built up a haze. Here is the view from Mt Styles, one of the two peaks I climbed today:
Those of you paying close attention know that I have struck out now on my last 4 peak views in Vermont. No worries today, though, as the trail traversed the Peak Peru wilderness, which was gorgeous - old growth firs and moss, gnarled tree branches, and the only background noise the sound of the wind.
 
Apparently, the Forest Service designates particular sections as “wilderness”. These areas are not available for alternative uses and receive less intervention (trail maintenance, etc) to keep them in a more natural state. Don’t tell my mother, but the signage warns that rescue might take longer due to primitive conditions.
Fine with me, I am hoping to not need rescue. 
I reached the shelter early and the gnat pressure was high, so I built my first fire (the trick is to use some of your Purell) to smoke them out. Success!

The morning hiking was enshrouded in mist, creating interesting perspectives of trail and lake views disappearing into the fog. 
The first part of the hike took me over Baker Peak, a rock-slabbed summit very reminiscent (in the too bad, never wanted to see this again kind of way) of NY, with the rock slabs at sharp angles and slick with the previous night’s rain.Took it carefully and made it through without incident. 
The trail was muddy, as one might expect. Combined with rocks, this creates a bit of a minefield for trekking poles, which can sink low into the mud and then get bent by a rock with forward momentum. Sure enough - one of my trekking poles snapped partway through the day. A field repair will keep me going until Mr. Right can get me a replacement. 
I know that Vermont is the Green Mountain state, but the overwhelming sense when hiking through here when it is damp is just how green and verdant everything is. It feels like being enveloped in a big green hug - ferns, moss, leaves, undergrowth. 
And, as proof that Vermonters have a sense of humor, I passed a rock garden right before the shelter. Created by gnomes, apparently. 
There are only 3 of us at the shelter tonight. It is 0.2 mi from the trail and has an unreliable water source, pushing it down the pecking order in terms of day’s destinations. But it slotted perfectly into our distance plans, so here we are for another rainy night.","Peru Peak shelter, VT (1669.2)

I have been largely successful on this segment at keeping my gear and clothing dry, despite the daily rain, so I wasn’t uncomfortable. Just a bit tired of the dreary skies. 
Mid-Vermont is a cell phone desert, so it is difficult to anticipate rain start/stop times. As a result, it is a constant topic of information exchange as hikers pass each other.  (This is also my excuse for all of the delayed journal entries this segment). 
Another hot topic right now - Birthday Girl, a 77 year old hiker, is working to finish her AT hike and is moving through this section. She started last March and has been off twice for injuries but keeps trucking. I met her today. She is ⅓ smaller than me, carries a pack 50% heavier, and travels about 1 mph (compared to typical thruhiker of 2mph). She gets star treatment at each place she stops. 
The trail itself today started adding in some more elevation, a ramp up to New Hampshire and Maine. I passed over Clarendon Gorge, then up a tricky rock scramble on the other side (mostly tricky because the rocks were wet).  Tomorrow we climb Killington, the highest point on the AT in Vermont.

Kent Pond, where I heard my first loon call of the hike (the dot in the center of the picture is a mother loon with 3 babies on her back. Trust me.)

I finished the day at an amazing shelter, The Lookout. Privately owned, it is made available to hikers.

Like yesterday, today’s hike was another roller coaster. I counted at least 6 hills of 300-700’ in elevation, giving a cumulative total that was reasonably high. I honestly prefer a couple of larger climbs than the repeated smaller ones - but you need to hike the trail you get, not the trail you want. 
There were some great pastoral scenes today as we hiked through Woodstock VT, and wildflowers bloomed in the meadows.
 
There are many ways to mark distances on the AT. I got a kick out of this one (carefully inked onto birch bark) but decided to pass.

The trail passes through several open pasture views which provided a nice counterpoint to the wooded areas.

The Western-most peak is Mt Moosilake, 4802 ft in elevation.  That was my objective for tomorrow - but as a result of the downpours forecast tomorrow I decided to hike some additional miles so that I could sit out the rain (sleet at the mountain peaks).  So I did both Moosilake and some extra miles today. This ended up creating a pretty challenging hiking plan. I hiked in reverse direction (N to S) as the northbound slope of Moosilake parallels the Beaver Brook Cascades, both beautiful and treacherous at the same time. Better to climb up wet boulders than down. I made great time to the top, despite the terrain that was sprinkled with rock slabs and rebar.
 
The top of Moosilake, an open alpine zone, was marked by cairns

Today’s hike over Mt Wolf, South Kinsman, and North Kinsman was easily the most challenging hike and certainly one of the scariest things I have ever done. 
The Kinsmans have a bit of a reputation to begin with for being very steep and rocky, and I took a rain zero yesterday to make sure I was not climbing them with the deck stacked against me. Today was forecast to be mostly cloudy, so I merrily set off at 7am on my 13.4 mile hike, which would normally take me 6-6.5 hours. I walked into Lonesome Lake hut 10-½ hours later, soaked to the skin, chilled, and I am sure with the whites of my eyes showing. 
It turned out that yesterday’s rainfall converted the trail to a river and the rivers to torrents. Planks that were supposed to offer footing above the water were submerged 6”. Rocks and roots were slick with moisture. Plus, Mother Nature let me down a bit and it rained today as well - a cold rain, with temps in the 40’s. So today’s hike was all about 3 things:
Not breaking my neck slipping down the steep, wet, and rocky descents from today’s 3 mountains Avoiding hypothermia from soaking wet feet (after 20 minutes) and soaking clothing (after 3 hours) in low temperatures Crossing the large number of rivers and streams safely 
(Lest you think I am exaggerating, I compared notes with 2 other experienced NOBOs this evening - they confided that they were terrified as well). 
Eventually I made it.  Mostly by moving very carefully and making extensive use of tree trunks and other roots to ease my way down the mountains while attacking the uphills to generate body heat. 
And, to top it off, this is the best view I got. 
Oof. Enough about that.  There were some great things about today as well. 
I am staying at my first AMC hut, a fixture in the White Mountains, which offer bunk rooms for hikers and dinner/breakfast cooked by their croo. Pricey, but worth every penny today as a refuge. The feeling of well-being after changing into dry clothing and joining the communal area was intense.There are two NOBOs staying here on the work for stay program - all they can eat plus a dry place to sleep for 2 hours of chores. 
I was pleased and relieved when my emergency dry clothing was actually dry when I pulled it out of my pack. I had upgraded to a better pack liner early in my thru hike, and it paid dividends today by keeping spare clothing and sleeping bag bone dry. 
Another great thing - no bugs today!
A note to other NOBOs: The ascent for South Kinsman is known for being fairly vertical and technical in parts. I found this to actually be the least difficult part of my day (all things are relative).

If yesterday was enough to make any sane person pitch their AT hike out of the window, today was enough to make that same person want to hike forever. 
Overnight the sky cleared. The stars were out and the morning dawned brightly, with mist rising over Lonesome Lake, where the hut is based (it is actually of 100 yards from the hut, but I was too tired and it was too wet to visit it last night). 
I headed out after breakfast with the objective of climbing down to Franconia Notch and then up and over Franconia Ridge - an iconic hike (rated #6 in the world). First, though, I needed to cross several rivers still swollen with rain. Cascade Brook, shown below, had the bridge washed out a while ago and the only option present was this tree trunk. 
Um, no. I headed upstream about 40 yards where a considerate hiker had marked an alternative crossing in shallower water. It still came to my knees as I waded across. Mile 1, and my feet were already soaked. The glamorous life of a thruhiker…
Once I reached Franconia Notch, the trail began to climb, 3700 feet of elevation to Mt Lafayette (“the fighting Frenchman”). On the way, the trail broke through the tree line and crossed over Little Haystack Mountain and Mt Lincoln. 
By a stroke of fortune, the weather was partly cloudy and the views clear over the majestic 360 degree views from the ridge. It was otherworldly, reminding me of the Roan Highlands in the South. I could have stayed up there all day - except that I couldn’t, of course. There is no water and no camping on the ridge, and I needed to push on. 
For a time the trail dipped off the ridge into old growth, mossy forest. The final hurdle, though, between me and rest was Mt Garfield, a steep ascent up sheer rock slabs followed by a steep descent. It is rumored that the gentlemen who designed the Garfield trail had their own unique approach to trail cutting, with the focus on straight up and straight down.  While broadly in NH the trail designers thought that switchbacks were for wimps, Mt Garfield is a poster child for that perspective. 
At 6:30, I staggered into the Garfield Ridge campsite, after another long and exhausting day. The elevation gain and loss were considerable today, and there was a lot of boulder work that required concentration on the descents (not as damp today, thankfully) and made the going slow. The difference from yesterday was that the return in scenery more than compensated for the effort.

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665789,"Today started early as I had an ambitious hike planned to get down to Crawford Notch and a shower. Setting off at 6am, I immediately hit a daunting rock slide down which had turned into a waterfall (of course). I stowed my poles and played Tarzan (or Jane) down the side, hanging onto trees and roots. Nothing like a nice adrenaline rush to get going first thing in the morning. 
The big climb today was up and over South Twin mountain, another steep ascent. Again, great views, particularly coming off the back side from Zealand cliff. 
After this I descended down to Zealand Falls hut. One of the nice things about the huts is that, during the day, they offer soup and baked goods for hikers as well as water fill-ups.  It was a beautiful structure and a great place to take a break. 
The remaining 8 miles of the hike were relatively flat and relatively fast (2 mph instead of the 1.3 mph that I had been averaging for the past 3 days). Along the way I passed a spare set of rocks that I assume Mother Nature had stored to strew on downhill sections and

a large cluster of Lady Slippers (not sure what the collective noun is)

as well as spotted a friend swimming with me in a bog I was tramping through. 
I arrived at Crawford Notch at 5pm, stuck out my thumb, and was picked up almost instantaneously by a local journalist who kindly delivered me to the AMC Highlands hut for the night. 
I was thinking today about how I am becoming increasingly inured to challenging hiking conditions - rock scrambles, bogs, wet water crossings, vertical rock faces, elevation - any one of which would have resulted in a lengthy journal entry earlier in this blog. I am sure that an experienced thruhiker reading my earlier entries would have just rolled their eyes thinking, “Just wait.”  Yup, I am here now. I hope.","Garfield Ridge campsite, NH (1835.3)

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665805,"Nearo/short day today in lieu of a Zero. My body is a bit fatigued from the push over the last 3 days, so I decided to baby it a bit by taking advantage of the hut system through the Presidential range. 
The Presidentials are, in addition to the Franconia Ridge walk, an iconic part of the AT hike, with Mt Washington as the star.  There are several huts along the traverse; today my objective was the Mitzpah hut. While only 6.4 miles from Crawford Notch, the hike took almost 5 hours due to significant elevation gain and a lot of technical work (read scaling and descending rock slabs).  You would have thought that a recreational site that gets as many dayhikers as this one would be well groomed and easy terrain. You would be wrong (I was). 
The hike went steeply up to Webster Cliffs (with the bulk of the rock scrambling), which was a great place for a break and some views.  Then over Mts Webster and Jackson. Cairns appear to be the method of choice for marking summits.  
Next through an alpine bog, which was full of flora that I had not seen before.  
The weather, critically important in this area, held nicely.  The forecast for Mt Washington tomorrow is…sunny!  (You will recall that it was snowing 2 weeks ago). So instead of dawdling to the next hut, I will make it a long day and go up and over Washington, aiming for the Madison hut tomorrow night. 
One note: today was the annual Hike Naked day. Sadly, no pictures to share.","Crawford Notch, NH (1852.8)

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665873,"On February 4 of this year, Mt Washington recorded a temperature of -47 degrees Fahrenheit. Combined with the 127 mph gusts, wind chill was -108 degrees F. A colleague advises that that is colder than the surface of Mars. 
Hikers don’t mess with Mt Washington weather - there have been too many tragic casualties because the weather changes so fast. This June has been the snowiest on record. So imagine my delight to discover that today it was going to be 60 degrees, clear skies, and 5-10 mph winds. Possibly the best hiking weather over Mt Washington in 9 months.
And so my planned leisurely dawdle through the Presidentials was adjusted: instead of doing a short day to Lake of the Clouds hut, I did a long day to get up and over Mt Washington, summiting in a tshirt.
 
The day started off early from Mitzpah hut, summiting Mt Pierce and skirting Mt Eisenhower and Mt Monroe before arriving at Lake of the Clouds hut for a snack break.
  
Today’s trail to Mt Washington largely followed the Crawford path, the oldest continuously maintained footpath in the US, first cut in 1819 by Abel Crawford and his son. Steely-eyed trail designers if you ask me - it was one of the better trails I have hiked in the Whites.  Above tree line the entire way, the views were stunning. I took many, many pictures, and am totally unable to capture the grandeur of the vista. 
From Lake of the Clouds to Mt Washington the trail got steeper, although not as bad as I anticipated.  The Mt Washington summit itself was a bit like Disneyland, with a cog railway, restaurant, gift shop, and crowds. Today there were paragliders as well. This looked like a great way to get down the mountain,  but I did not take advantage of it. 
After lunch on Mt Washington I headed off to Madison Springs hut, and the trail skirted Mt Clay, Mt Jefferson, and Mt Adams. While the grade was gentle, the trail condition was completely different than the morning, with 4 hours of rock-hopping that became very tedious very quickly. There were many different trail designers in the Whites, with many different philosophies. The push and pull between keeping trails as natural as possible vs making them more accessible continues today. 30 minutes before the end of the hike I snapped another trekking pole that had sunk into a crevice between 2 rocks…the Whites have been pretty tough on my gear. 
I encountered a brief patch of snow (June 22), but largely the snow has melted on the traverse.
 
One of the features that was much more prominent this afternoon was the presence of cairns along the trail. Topped with white rocks (quartzite?), these were very helpful in spotting the path through the many rockfalls of this section of the Whites.  During foggy/rainy conditions they can be lifesavers, as there is no obvious treadway through the rocks.
 
It was great to finally reach the hut. Long day, gorgeous views, tired legs, happy hiker. Settling into my bunk tonight after an excellent dinner by the croo. There are a lot of day hikers here tonight, and I have fielded a lot of questions about thru-hiking. The verdict is split between really cool thing to do and really odd. 
Sunset here was beautiful.

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665914,"Today’s hike was the tail end of the Presidential Range, scaling Mt Madison then descending down to Pinkham Notch. I got an early start and pulled my way up the 0.5 mile steep climb to the top of Madison, pretty much a boulder scramble all the way. The top of Madison, though, provided excellent morning views - once again it was a warm, clear morning. 
The descent from Madison, however, has been characterized as the worst on the AT (getting in a lot of “bests” and “worsts” these days).  I can testify that it was indeed extremely difficult - steep and rocky, and seemingly unending.But forewarned was forearmed, and with fresh legs, dry rocks, and all the time in the world, I slowly inched down to tree line. In one piece. 
After the long stretch above tree line over the past week, it was a relief to be back in the “green tunnel” for the 5 or so relatively flat miles before Pinkham Notch. Rocks and roots, river crossings, but no rock scrambles up or down. 
I am in a hostel now, trying to plan out the next section while also watching a Harry Potter movie with a collection of tired hikers. This has been a difficult section for all of us, and most are planning zeroes to recover physically or mentally.

In addition, the streams and rivers in Maine are already high, with some closures, and this week will exacerbate the situation.  Waiting a bit longer now should (hopefully) mean that I don’t need to camp several days by a full stream waiting for it to go down before I try to cross it.
I’d built time in my schedule for weather delays, but didn’t realize I would be using them all at once.  I’m a bit frustrated, but recognize that this is part of the challenge of completing a thru-hike.

Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666109,"One might think that an extended period of downtime off the trail due to weather would hold appeal. And it truly did, for about 24 hours. And then came the itch, and the invisible tug back to finish what I had started. Based on the current rain forecast, I could have taken off a week - but I am back in the saddle 2 days later and happy about it, trying to take advantage of a weather window that will let me finish New Hampshire. 
While on my weather zero, I did the one thing that I thought would guarantee no rain in the upcoming days: I purchased more heavy duty rain pants to replace the trash bag look alikes that I have been using (and that have been wholly ineffective in heavy rain). These new pants are about 4 times the weight of the ones they are replacing, but should do a better job of keeping me from getting chilled. 
Experienced hikers will tell you that there is no good solution for walking all day in the rain. Inevitably, your gear will wet out or you will sweat out from inside the gear.  Regardless, I feel I should try something. Murphy’s Law, though, suggests I will just be carrying extra weight with no benefit. This is the offering I make to the rain gods. 
Last night I was woken multiple times by thunder, as a strong storm swept through the area. Rain continued this morning until about 8:30, then tapered off. The forecast gave me a 4-6 hour window until the rain would start up again, with more thunderstorms and high winds forecast for the afternoon and evening, so I planned for a short day over the Wildcats. 
The Wildcats, like the Kinsmans, have a reputation. There are several peaks, but Wildcat D is very steep, very rocky, and a bit technical. I have been told the climb is the steepest 1 mile on the AT (although Mahoosuc Arm might disagree). Regardless, the Wildcat Ridge trail went from this

to this
 
In 50 yards. And stayed like that for almost 2 miles. I even got to attempt my first chimney climb today.Trickier because of the wet rock, but I have a strong preference for going up now rather than down - just fewer opportunities for something going badly wrong. 
The rain held off for the promised timeframe, although the trail was swamped from the rain over the past month. And, of course, I was hiking in the clouds most of the day so had no views. The picture at the top of the post captures the day perfectly. 
Having covered 6 miles in 5 hours, I was very happy to reach Carter Hut, built in 1914 and one of the smaller and snugger huts in the Whites.  There were wet clothes hanging from the rafters to dry, a couple playing Catan, a thruhiker explaining how to navigate a difficult stream crossing coming up, several people getting steaming mugs of coffee, and a croo member preparing dinner. The wind is starting to kick up now.

Today’s hike took me over Carter Dome, South Carter, Middle Carter, North Carter, and Mt Moriah. 5 mountains, zero views, 15 miles, 10-½ hours. Whew. 
But the theme of the day was water. Water, water everywhere. It misted the entire day, but thankfully no rain. The rocks were wet, making ascents a bit tougher and descents much tougher. The trail itself was underwater most of the day; my feet were soaked within the first 10 minutes and stayed that way for the rest of the day.
 
There were lots of slab ledges today, and more exposed terrain. The wind was gusty at elevation, whipping through the tree tops. 
The toughest part of the day was the river crossings, particularly 2 crossings of Rattle River towards the end of the hike. The river was swollen and roaring, and the normal trail crossings were impassable.
 I bushwhacked upstream both times to find the least sketchy crossings, but they were not an enjoyable experience. 
Very happy to finish this day, this section, and the Whites. I am at a hostel now, and there are many hikers getting off trail.

The trail itself has stepped up a bit in difficulty compared to early NH, and down a bit in terms of trail maintenance (broken bog boards, overgrown vegetation, limited erosion control).  But after the Whites it seemed very doable.

Halfway through today’s hike I crossed into Maine, the 14th and final state of this hike, and its 282 miles of AT trail. Maine is notorious for the difficulty and remoteness of its trail, including the 100 Mile Wilderness.  The exclamation point at the end is Mt Katahdin in Baxter State Park, the northern terminus of the Appalachian Trail. 
In switching weather systems, it seemed that Mother Nature could not make up her mind today. We saw cloudy skies, then blue sky, then rain. Then cloudy, then blue sky, then rain. It is raining now as I sit in the shelter, big puddles forming on the ground outside. But fingers crossed for tomorrow. 
The day started with a climb of Mt Success, and …success! I got a view.
This was followed by a rollercoaster over the Goose Eye peaks. The trail stepped up another notch in difficulty today, with technical climbs and descents that were pretty challenging. Several required me to take my pack off or scoot down on my butt to work my way through. My progress was 1.1 mph, dismally slow compared to normal terrain. 
Maine finished my day by baptizing me in an alpine bog, where a floating bog board tipped up when I stepped on it and dumped me in waist deep. Ugh. Slimed. The good news was that I smelled bad enough that the bugs left me alone.

Today’s entertainment was the Mahoosuc Notch, a 1 mile long pile of gigantic boulders that has been coined “the most difficult mile on the AT”.  Fear mongering is rife for this section, and it is a part of every thruhiker’s resume. It is particularly challenging in the rain, so I attempted to time it for a rare non-rainy day. With success, thankfully. 
I teamed up with two other thru hikers, Surefoot and Splash, to navigate the maze of the Notch. It took us a little over 2 hours to navigate up, over, and sometimes under the boulders (removing our packs and handing them through crevices). 
With snow and ice still at the bottom of the Notch, it was also very atmospheric. Temperatures dropped palpably (15-20 degrees) as we descended. 
Emerging at the end, there was a 50 yard ford up to our thighs in ice cold (think snowmelt) water. But celebration once completed!  The celebration was a bit dampened by the fact that the Notch is followed immediately by a backbreakingly steep (30% grade) climb up the Mahoosuc Arm to reach Old Speck.  Happily, with the good weather, there was a view as a reward. 
The only other unique item of note today was our first crossing of a beaver dam, gingerly stepping across logs and branches gnawed down by the industrious beavers. 
Weather is still playing a huge factor in both planning and enjoyment of these scenic sections. New Hampshire had its 2nd rainiest June on record; Maine continues to report flash flooding and high river crossings in our area. Sunny days everything seems possible; rainy days require much more energy and determination. It is the Factor X of this thruhiker class.

I had lunch on Little Baldpate, the view above. Once again, a cairn on a rocky topped mountain with the sorrowful call of a sparrow in the background as mist rolls through (I don’t know what it is about these summits, but they all seem to have a resident atmospheric sparrow).

The mind - acquiring the skills and knowledge to successfully hike and camp for 2200 miles. Researching and testing gear, learning about the different sections and challenges, developing competence in areas as varied as water purification, tent site selection, food calorie efficiency, and hypothermia management. The body - getting in shape prior to the hike and managing fitness and energy levels for the following 5 months. Building trail legs, avoiding overuse injuries, and optimizing nutrition and recovery cycles. The spirit - maintaining the focus and determination to complete the hike despite trail friends dropping out, homesickness, exhaustion, the rain and the cold, and the occasional boredom. 
There was a lot I was able to do in advance on the mind and body front and, planner at heart, I did them. There’s not a lot you can do in advance to know whether, when the crunch comes, your spirit will overcome the challenges you face.

According to fake AT lore, the difficulty gap between northern and southern Maine was so immense that a spiritual bridge was erected in these mountains to join the vast divide.

The party ended coming down Sugarloaf, another one of those tricky and technical declines that I despise because they have so many opportunities for (painful) failure.

At the very beginning of our slackpack of the Crockers, Splash spotted a small patch of ripe raspberries, our first berries of the season. We marveled at their sweetness.  Maine, of course, will be covered in blueberries in a couple of weeks - just after we finish. Hikers from other years have raved about berry picking as they hiked the trail, but we will take what we can get. 
It was the 3rd straight day of hiking in sunshine. Of course, the sky opened up as soon as we got back to the hostel…but we were able to return with dry shoes.  While I am sure that “Raine” is not done with us yet, the slow drying of the muddy trails has really helped. 
No one fell. The entire section of trail was non-technical. Views were limited as both summits were largely wooded, but I was able to grab one shot. 
It was a short slackpack day, which allowed us to finish this section to Stratton, and have just 2 more sections to go: getting to Monson, and the 100 Mile Wilderness.  Planning food and equipment needs is almost complete.

And, in fact, the planned route registered more than 5000 feet of both elevation and descent. But coming off a zero day, fueled, refreshed, and with light packs, it felt like just another day at the office (although with some great views). 
In fact, things went so well that as a group we decided to push the day to 20 miles (more than 6000 feet up and 6000 feet down) to position ourselves better for tomorrow and the rain forecast. About 11-½ hours of hiking overall. It felt good to stretch to a 20 mile day again after so many difficult days in the Whites and Southern Maine with lower mileage. 
The most notable part of today’s hike was that the trail was almost normal - no crazy technical climbs, no deep bogs, no death- defying descents, no rain, and only moderate mud - permitting a much more normal hiking speed as I was just dealing with (admittedly significant) elevation changes. 
Of course, the water is never too far away. These northern forests in Maine still retain a great deal of moisture, which shapes the ecosystem I hike through.

The Maine AT has many unbridged river crossings, the widest (at 400’) and most unpredictable (due to unscheduled dam releases upstream) being the Kennebec. Two hikers are known to have drowned in the past attempting to cross; the ATC now provides a canoe ferry to shuttle hikers across. The canoe ferry has been shut down twice this season already due to high water on the Kennebec. 
While we hoped to cross today, the ferry only runs 9-2 and it was 17 miles to get to the river. Surefoot found an after-hours Maine Guide willing to paddle us across when we hit the river at 3:30 and voila!  We got ‘er done. 
Our string of no rain hiking came to an end today, as it drizzled on and off in the morning then shifted to consistent showered in the afternoon. The terrain was a mix of gnarly roots

and boardwalk

and smooth trail,but mostly mud. Lots and lots of mud. 

Enough mud to represent a hazard (there was a thruhiker in our hostel last night who had broken her arm slipping in mud in this section). Enough mud so that you stopped trying to dodge it and just splashed through it for hours. 
We also had a number of other river crossings today besides the Kennebec, including a thigh level crossing of Pierce Pond outlet and an unusual 3 log bridge that required agility and focus as it was both slippery and wobbly.

Around 11:30, we ambled out of the hostel and completed a short 5.5 mile section going south from Pleasant Pond Mtn back to the northern side of the Kennebec River. Streams are still full and the trail was oh-so-muddy. In a familiar refrain from previous days we did the over/under for when our feet would be soaked in muddy water. I believe it was 10 minutes. 
But the trail was all downhill today and the sun peeked out after an hour or so. We finished up at the river (which looked very different from the day before) and had a chat with the ATC Ferry operator. It turns out that he is one of 4 guides, all heavily certified in white water operations, who rotate the duty. The ferry operates 9-2 because at 2 the major dam release from 17 miles upstream hits the crossing, causing the water level to rise abruptly.

Finally got a hiking day in Maine that was carefree and everything I had been looking forward to. The sun shone for most of the day, the trails were not (too) muddy, there were views in the tops of the mountains and a sweet pond-side camping spot at the end of the day.   And the trail didn’t try to kill me. 
The trail went up and over Pleasant Pond Mountain and Moxie Bald Mountain, both above treeline. I was happy to see clusters of the Star-tipped Reindeer Lichen again - those little puffballs make me happy. The views of Maine mountains and lakes were sweeping.  By the time we had reached the top of Moxie Bald, we were able to look back to see the route we had just hiked over Pleasant Pond Mountain. 

There was one slightly sketchy river crossing (mid thigh level plus current) across Baker Stream, but we crossed carefully with no issues. Tomorrow has a more problematic crossing across the West and East branches of the Piscataqui, which SOBO hikers are warning us about. There is a 7 mile road walk as an alternative - we will assess tomorrow morning to see if the water level has dropped. 
By 3pm we had arrived at Bald Mountain Pond Lean-to, situated on a beautiful pond with the calls of loons carrying on the wind. We could have gone further. Probably should have gone further. But decided to stop here for the night and soak in the view.","Pleasant Pond Mtn parking, ME (2052.4)

This gives me a great jump start in the morning, but after a hard day of hiking makes me pretty poor company by 8pm!
Today was all about stream crossings -at least 10 of them without bridges, 4 at thigh level or higher, and one, the West Piscataquis,  pretty sketchy with fast, hip level water. The water volume 2 days ago, after a heavy rain the night before, was 800-1000 cubic ft per sec, making this crossing impassable (one intrepid hiker got swept 30 yards downstream). Hikers were using a 7 mile road walk to bypass it. 
But fortunately, I was able to “phone a friend”. Daughter #2 was able to check the water levels this morning and send a satellite message back - down to 456 cfs at 5:30 am.  Still high but possible.After checking it out carefully, we went for it and made it across successfully. Nice to check that box.

First, though, this delightful warning before beginning. A nice warm and fuzzy message to kick off the day. Fortunately, we had been well- braced by some inspirational words from Poet, the hostel owner (“remember that, for the rest of your life, you will compare everything to this thru-hike”), and an even more inspirational breakfast of blueberry pancakes, hash browns, bacon and eggs. 
The plan is to do the 100 MW in 7 days, with lots of caveats about weather and stream crossings. Of note: the Fastest Known Time (FKT) is approximately 25 hours. We won’t be trying to replicate that!  The trick is that the nature of the challenge remains somewhat shrouded in mystery, almost like a final hazing ritual before Katahdin and completion. 

Today, however, the trail was just trail. Lots of roots, multiple water crossings (including a somewhat sketchy high velocity crossing of Long Pond Stream), and ups and downs.   It drizzled in the morning, but shifted to just cloudy by midday. 
It is clear, though, that our shoes and feet will stay wet from stream crossings and muddy trail for the next week. I am putting cream on my feet each night to help them deprune and prevent development of some unpleasant foot conditions.

The trail goes up and over the Chairback range, starting with a 1700’ climb up Barren Mountain followed by a rollercoaster over Chairback Third and Fourth Mountains, Columbus Mountain, and Chairback Mountain. There was a tricky rockslide of large boulders that needed to be navigated. There was a 100’ river crossing of the Pleasant River.
But most particularly, we knew that up to 2” of rain was forecast, starting in the morning and running through the night, making all of the above that much more difficult.  And rain it did.  The trail flooded out in short order, and we were soaked to the skin by 11am. Rocks got slick and we sloshed through mud all day.

 We finally arrived at our tent site at 4:30, threw up our tents, and dived in to get warm.  It is now 6:30 and I am dry and snuggled into my sleeping bag.  The legions of mosquitoes outside (totally unintimidated by DEET) are screaming their frustration and plotting revenge for tomorrow morning. A brief note on water crossings. In our first 2 days we had 4 major water crossings that could have triggered significant road walks. We accelerated our mileage to position ourselves to cross these before we were hammered by today’s rainstorm, which pumped the stream levels back up.  We got lucky and made it through. 
While the 100 mile wilderness has not presented extraordinary challenges in terms of trail, planning around rain and water really ratchets up the difficulty. Unlike the rest of the AT, there is not an option to bail out tomorrow to a hostel to dry our gear and clothing, or to wait while the water levels go down. It’s a real test of resilience.

Perhaps it is my lizard brain. When I woke up this morning, I was unreasonably cheered by the fact that it had stopped raining overnight. Yes, it was cloudy. Yes, I needed to put on my soaked clothes from yesterday. Yes, the mosquitoes pummeled me the second I put my nose out of my tent (ever try eating oatmeal in a head net?  Pro tip: don’t). Yes, I needed to pack up a wet tent and wet gear, increasing my pack weight. 
 But it wasn’t raining. 
The trail today, climbing 10 miles up to White Cap, was more effort than I expected, and I was pretty winded when I got to the top. White Cap is the last major climb in the 100 Mile Wilderness, and is known for sometimes providing the first glimpse of Katahdin for the NOBO hiker.  Not today, but we were treated to a beautiful view of the valley and mountains approaching Mama K. 

I used the open summit of White Cap, where the wind was whipping, as an opportunity to dry my gear. In 20 minutes my tent and rain gear were dry, a big relief. I also traded tips with a group of SOBOs eating lunch at the summit on the status of water crossings, a topic on everyone’s mind. 
It is not too much of an overstatement to say that the trail is all downhill from White Cap and, sure enough, we hiked 5 miles downhill to our shelter for the night. I did some much needed laundry at camp, but not successfully- I managed to lose a piece of clothing in the fast moving river (epic fail on Leave No Trace) and struggled to get the rest of the clothing to dry in the high humidity. Several pieces of my gear are beginning to self-destruct from the perpetual moisture (looking at you, shoes); it’s a race to the finish.  
Still keeping an eye on my feet, which are wet all day from the mud and the water crossings. Two hikers I know of have developed foot infections/fungal flare ups (Goretex boots appear to be a culprit), and I am hoping to avoid that. 
From here onwards the trail levels out and we expect to make better time. We have put in 3 strong days under difficult conditions, but I have not had much of an opportunity to enjoy the beauty of this section of trail.  I am hoping that turns around soon. ","Pleasant River Tentsites, ME (2114.5)

Up early to get a jump on the day’s miles, as we were meeting our food drop at 1pm 12 miles away. Happily, the trail was relatively fast in this section, and we arrived by 11:30 at the logging road crossing (there are several logging roads in the 100MW and Shaw’s hostel will meet hikers there with a resupply). 
Stepping out of the woods, we got - trail magic!  
Captain Morgan is making another attempt to set the FKT for the entire AT and he left from  Katahdin today heading south, aiming for 41 days. Ice Man, part of his support crew, was at the logging road waiting for him to come by later in the day. Seeing us, Ice Man offered some very welcome drinks and snacks. Check out his great license plate. 

Captain Morgan did come past our shelter later in the day but, as you can imagine, didn’t stop to chat. At that point (5 pm), he would have climbed and descended Katahdin (10 miles), run to the start of the 100 mile wilderness (10 miles) and traversed 38 miles of the 100 mile wilderness. Wow. Good luck to him. 
Our food drop arrived and we handed over trash and received our resupply for the next couple of days. Plus a cold beer each. 
We hiked 4 more miles to a beautiful tent site on a lake, our original planned stopping point, but got there so early in the afternoon that we settled for a swim in the lake then pushed on to the next lean-to.This will allow us to complete the 100 Mile Wilderness a day early (which will get me a hot shower and laundry a day early: all good).  Not quite an FKT, but 6 days is respectable.

Our little group had committed last night to another big day to be able to exit the 100 MW quickly. While the elevation was fairly flat, the effort of navigating the stream crossings, mud, and rocks was still pretty tiring. Fortunately, after last night’s rain the day gradually cleared and provided good hiking weather and beautiful trail sections to traverse,including a number of ponds that beckoned us for a swim. 

Unfortunately, today also had a number of bog board traverses. How many ways have I fallen on bog boards?  I’ve been upended by stepping on a floating board, skidded off a board made slick by rain and moss, and tripped on a board with nails sticking out. I have not yet had a rotten one collapse on me, but there are still a couple of days left.  Do I hold a personal grudge?  Possibly.

Today’s hike out of the 100 Mile Wilderness was bittersweet. 
The day dawned with bright sunshine (I know because I was up before sunrise so that we could get an early jump on the day). It was the first bluebird day I have had since Mt Washington, almost 4 weeks ago. No rain in the forecast, blue skies, clear views. 
The trail was beautiful, sun dappled and lush.
We passed several more lakes on our way, but did not stop for a swim as we had a shuttle we were trying to catch.
 It was a fairly level section of trail and, despite the normal roots, mud puddles, and river crossings, we made good time. 
I thought I would include a picture of a shelter (Hurd Lean-to) with a “baseball bat” floor.As far as I know, you can only find these in Maine in the older shelters. According to Dave Field, long-time shelter maintainer, the tradition was to cut white pine boughs and lay them on top of the flooring to provide cushioning and a sweet scent. 
The highlight of the day was a stop at Rainbow Ledges, about 6 miles before the end of the 100 MW. 

There were zillions of ripening blueberries here (spotted immediately by Splash), and we relaxed for a bit in the sun.
 
Then we turned the corner, and boom!  Our first real view of Katahdin.  Amazing. 

Buoyed, we began the last 6 miles of the 100 Mile Wilderness. 
And then it began.  The woods were stunning, the hike was golden, and I could almost feel the greedy fingers of the forest pulling me back. “Don’t leave,” I imagined it saying. “It’s about the journey, not the destination.”  
After 2175 miles of the trail, I was filled with emotion. It has been about the journey. I do enjoy hiking (camping in the rain, not so much). The people and communities I have met, getting closer to nature, having the opportunity to reflect for hours at a time, doing much more with much less have been so enriching for me. 
And yet, I have to believe there are other journeys, and adventures, still out there. Katahdin doesn’t just signify the end of this journey, but the beginning of others. 
I stepped out of the 100 Mile Wilderness, and may have blinked back a tear or two. 
I waited for Splash and Surefoot and we walked together to Abol Bridge, for a stunning view of our destination, Katahdin. We will hike a short 10 mile stretch to the base of Katahdin the day after tomorrow (shower and laundry first) and then hopefully make the ascent on Monday.

Park entry (because we had exited the park and not stayed at the Birches) was a bit of an effort: 2 weeks in advance we needed to reserve day passes for Katahdin Stream Campground and, because we weren’t sure that early exactly when we would summit, needed to get them for multiple days (you are allowed up to 3 per month). We left Millinocket at 5:30am, got to the park and waited 30 minutes to work through the entry gate, then finally got on trail by 7am. 

We were rested, hardened by NH and Maine, and the rocks were dry, so we made great time (7 hours round trip, including a lunch break at the summit). The AT proceeds from Katahdin Stream Campground up the Hunt Trail, passing by the lovely Katahdin Stream Falls. 

Once you get to treeline, the bouldering becomes steep and intense, an adult jungle gym writ large. I was so happy to do this with dry rocks and fresh shoes - I am not sure how I would have made it through some of the sections in the rain.  But in the conditions today, it was challenging and, dare I say it, fun. 
Of course, the payoff for all this work was the views. Hiking above treeline gave me that “walking on top of the world” feeling that I felt at Franconia Ridge and the Roan Highlands, with views sweeping out for many miles in all directions towards majestic mountains and lakes. 

After finally hauling ourselves up and over the boulders, the trail proceeded through the tablelands towards the summit, passing Thoreau Spring on the way. 

And then, the sign, the end of the Appalachian Trail. I have heard that the AT was originally supposed to end on Mt Washington, but that Myron Avery (himself a Mainer) insisted it be Katahdin. He got this right - it is a spectacular way to end a 2200 mile odyssey.   So many thoughts went through my head approaching the sign - flashbacks to different points along my journey, both experiences and places. But mostly, a sense of closure, of a mission completed. I know it will take weeks, perhaps months to process it all; I can be patient. 
There were others at the summit, but celebrations were muted. Mostly quiet acknowledgments of achievement. We had lunch, soaking in the scenery, and headed down. 
“Down” in this case was via the Abol trail, a slightly shorter but very steep descent more analogous to rolling down a cliff than anything else. We chose it because the Hunt trail descent is more protracted and has some trickier vertical sections to navigate. The Abol trail boulder section was steeper, but could be navigated successfully with a lot of butt sliding.  Which I did. It was a full body workout,  and I was grateful for the upper body strength I had picked up over the past couple of months as I needed to lower myself down a number of sections.  It was fast, though - we emerged at the trailhead in under 3 hours, legs like jelly. 
Mr. Right and Miss Right met me at the trailhead, cold Gatorade and Snickers in tow.  It was wonderful to see them after being apart for months. 
After a shower and some brief downtime, we celebrated over dinner with Surefoot and Splash, and warched the sun setting on Katahdin.

Your body will harden to the point that the elevation gains will not be an issue.  If you get fit in advance, this will happen faster.  By the time I reached the Smokies on the first leg (HF-GA) and NH on the second leg (HF-ME), my body was more than ready to roll out of my sleeping bag and knock off 4-5000 ft of elevation.  Didn’t stop once up Blood Mountain.  Didn’t stop (except to wolf down a snack) up Katahdin.  Can’t say I always enjoyed it, but I really stopped worrying about the elevation profile for the next day. The change was much more than simply “trail legs” would have led me to expect - some days I didn’t recognize my own body in terms of what it could do.Your mind will harden, too, in terms of what you consider challenging.  20+ mile day?  Yes, if I need to.  Vertical/semi-technical rock climbing?  Sure.  Crossing high streams?  Done carefully, sure.  Hiking through water and mud? Bears? Rattlers?  Pfui.  The hardening was much more noticeable in the north (primarily NH/ME, but a couple of sections in PA and NY).  You need to be prepared and rested physically to go through this mental metamorphosis up north - hikers that were already stressed often hit the wall with these additional challenges and left trail.  They say it gets harder in NH and ME, but they don’t tell you why.  I always assumed it was because the mountains were higher and more frequent, so more elevation.  Wrong (well, true, but that wasn’t the reason it was harder).  For me, NH and ME were harder because the downhill sections were very difficult, particularly in the rain.  Vertical and rocky, meaning any mistake is painful, if not bone-breaking and hike-ending.  Requiring enormous focus and slow and careful precision.  Very few thru-hikers I spoke to complained of the climbs.  You could see the whites of their eyes when they talked about the descents (Moosilake, Kinsmans, Garfield, Madison, Bigelows, Katahdin).  The other thing harder about NH and ME was the importance of weather in your planning, similar to snowstorms in the Smokies.  Some summits (Mt Washington, Mt Katahdin) weren’t feasible in bad weather; some sections (Kinsmans, Mahoosucs, Wildcats) were far more difficult in the rain; streams swelled to be unpassable, particularly in the 100 Mile Wilderness. The only way to stay sane (and safe) in NH and ME is to make sure you have spare days in your plan so that you can pace yourself and time the weather.Hostels are a linchpin to your hike.  Going into my hike I had viewed hostels as a place to get a bed every 3-5 days.  They were actually much more - a source of community, to meet other hikers; a source of tips on upcoming sections, from both hikers and hostel owners (many of whom knew their areas very well); an oasis of recovery for sore bodies and wet gear.  Particularly in GA, VA, and ME, the hostels were excellent and put a focus on helping hikers to succeed.  I know they helped me.Friction is important.  Your shoe’s grip on its walking surface is crucial to your safety.  Roots (wet vs dry), rocks (wet vs dry, rock type, different angles), bog boards (wet vs mildewed vs dry), mud - I found myself paying a lot of attention to how much grip I had in different situations.  Particularly up north, where you are scaling a lot of rock, the degree of grip you have completely determines your route up the rock face.  My first shoe change was to get a better grip (Vibram) after several falls.  Slimy bog boards, in particular, were kryptonite to me.  Make sure your shoes have good grip and replace them when the grip wears down.  I went through 6 pairs of shoes. The trail changes throughout its length.  Yes, I knew this intellectually.  But somehow I imagined that the Appalachian Trail was one big green tunnel with bigger and smaller mountains.  It isn’t.  There is certainly a lot of “green tunnel” - forest trail sheltered under spreading canopy.  But there are also balds, and alpine zones, and bogs, and ponds.  Sheer granite slabs and boulder fields and cliffs and notches.  Conifer and hardwood forests.  Rivers and streams.  Trail design varies too, by state and club.  If you've done one section of the AT, you haven't done the AT.  For a thru-hiker who gets to experience this all in a short period of time, it creates a broad canvas of experiences and memories.A 2 person tent is 30-40% more weight but 3 times more comfortable than a 1 person tent.  The ability to have all your gear in the tent with you, rather than outside, is pretty convenient.  But WHEN IT RAINS, being able to separate out wet and dry areas in your tent is a lifesaver.  Ever try to strip off wet clothes in a tent and keep the inside of the tent dry?  It is really hard.  Also - bugs in Maine are a real issue, and can make shelters uninhabitable.  You will spend more time in your tent.  It’s nice to have the space to stretch out.Where you are in the bubble will have a significant impact on your hike.  Just in ways that are difficult to predict.  When I did the southern leg (HF-GA) in the fall, there were relatively few other hikers, and those that were there were SOBOs or FF’s on their 2nd leg, so faster and more experienced than I was.  It was pretty quiet in terms of community and I needed to go to a hostel to meet more than 2 hikers at a time.  When I did the northern leg (HF-ME), I intentionally started off with the FF bubble…which was great and convivial for the first couple of nights.  But I hadn’t planned for the fact that I would be trail hardened and they (having just started) would not be.  So I started drifting forward, losing most of the flip floppers and joining the tip of the early/fast NOBOs.  Fast NOBOs were generally younger, and certainly faster than I was.  It took a while to start tracking with a consistent group through Vermont, NH, and Maine.  On the other hand - on neither leg did I encounter the full bubble, so never had a problem with shuttle and hostel reservations or shelter capacity.  No firm recommendation here, but just be aware and patient.  It will eventually settle out and you will find a group to track with. Solo hikers are at a disadvantage in Maine.  I am a pretty committed solo hiker, with a strong point of view about not compromising on speed and distance just to be able to match up with other compatible personalities, and before my hike was largely unconvinced by the case for tramilies.  I was lucky to team up with great partners in both the South and the North for a portion of my hike, but never felt hiking solo was a clear disadvantage until I got to Maine.  Crossing high rivers, making your way through Mahoosuc Notch, and working down tricky descents are best done as group activities, and knowing someone was watching my back was a real asset.
That’s it.  Most everything else I needed to know was readily available from reading Trail Journals, books, or Reddit.
My next entry will focus more on equipment.",,View Entry,"Jul 31, Mon",0
Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667568,"I have already covered equipment once (see my comments after the first leg, 1/1/23), so I would like to just return and highlight my equipment all-stars and some general thoughts.
Equipment All-Stars (things that I would absolutely take again):
Altra Olympus shoes - Love zero drop or hate it - I was able to adapt to the zero drop by wearing them around home before the hike started.  But the Olympus version gave me good grip (Vibram sole), great cushioning to glide over the rocks and roots, and a wide toe box.  Zero foot blisters for 2200 miles.  The durability was not spectacular - the most I got was 400 miles (and the least was 200 miles), so I had to replace them often - but for me the tradeoff was worth it.  5 million steps is a lot of steps.Darn tough socks.  2200 miles. No holes. Survived multiple hostel dryers.Gossamer Gear Gorilla - great pockets.  Great hip belt.  Handled 20 lb easily and was very durable.  Gossamer Gear ⅛” thinlite pad (rolled, not folded) - I used this as the backpad for my pack, but also unfolded underneath my sleeping pad to protect it.  It also did triple duty as a sit pad.Osprey pack liner - This waterproof packliner was an upgrade in both weight and functionality from the original Nylofume liner I used to keep my gear dry.  The Nylofume failed my first night on trail due to a burst seam.  The Osprey pack liner was heavier but 100% reliable.  There was no better feeling during a drenching downpour (or a slip in a bog) than knowing that my sleeping bag and sleeping clothes were bone dry, even if I wasn’t.Aftershokz headphones. These are bone conduction headphones, so I could hear ambient noise around me while I listened to an audiobook … like a timber rattlesnake’s angry rattle on the trail in PA (!)Superglue singles.  Okay, this is a very niche recommendation.  But a tiny tube of superglue saved me several times (including shoe emergencies).Befree filter (and 0.6l bag) plus a Gatorade 750 ml bottle plus sports cap.  The Befree filter was the fastest way to scoop and filter water while hiking, and the Gatorade 750ml bottle was much less ungainly than the Smart Water bottles.  A draft collar on my sleeping quilt.  I used the REI 30 degree Magma sleeping bag for the 2nd half of my hike, and got surprised in the early weeks when temps dipped into the high 30’s.  The draft collar added at least 10 degrees of warmth to the setup. Unfortunately, it took me 2-3 nights to figure that out.Bug spray - I started off with Picaridin and used it sparingly for 4 months, shifted to 30% DEET daily for NH and twice per day in Maine, and then 100% DEET twice per day for the second half of the 100 Mile Wilderness.  An absolute necessity for Maine.Garmin Fenix 7 watch.  This, along with my tent, were my two equipment splurges.  I was able to load my daily routes onto my watch, which displayed my map as I was hiking (along with all kinds of data).  The clutch function, though, was a gentle buzz if I missed a turn and drifted off trail - which meant I really never did.Finally, my Durston XMid Pro 2 person tent.  It was my oasis in the middle of the craziness.  Light, storm-worthy, and spacious.
General thoughts:
Less is almost always more.  I can’t stress enough how much better a lighter pack is than a heavier pack.  Better for your feet, your joints, and your frame of mind.  My pack with food and water was generally 15-20 lbs, and most of the time I didn’t even notice it.  The Reddit ultralight thread is a great source of ideas for how to not be light but not stupid-light.Having said that, I did start off with several items that were too light-weight: my packliner (see above), my Gossamer Gear trekking poles (which I loved but didn’t survive NH and ME), and my rain pants (which looked like expensive trashbags).  I went heavier on all of these items - the wear and tear of a thruhike did not make them practical.REI.  No, they don’t carry a number of cottage manufacturers.  Yes, they do sell at list price with limited discounts.  But they stand behind the products they sell.  When I ran into quality issues with my sleeping pad and my shoes, REI sorted it out for me quickly and replaced them without complaint.  I was grateful.
It’s not all about equipment.  But bad equipment can make you miserable, and some pieces can, in the words of Marie Kondo, “bring you joy.”",,View Entry,"Aug 01, Tue",0
Kidding Right,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667621,"5-½ months hiking the Appalachian trail.  What did I gain?  Well, a waist (missing in action for a number of years).  Awkward tan lines.  A resting pulse in the low 40’s.  A basement full of gear.  An esoteric skill set that may only be applicable in the event of an apocalypse. An extra shoe size.
I also met some amazing people.  Saw some stunning sights.  Gained a much deeper appreciation for the history and culture of the Appalachian mountain range.  Learned to recognize some bird calls. 
Approximately 4000 hikers per year attempt a thru-hike, and approximately 1000 complete that journey within 12 months.  In the context of the more than 3 million visits to the Appalachian Trail each year, this is almost a rounding error - although thru-hiking garners a disproportionate share of discussion, airtime, and attention.  However, the intensity of the experience, combined with its length, also gave me an opportunity for reflection.  I summarized some of these feelings after I finished my southern leg last fall, and thought I would build on them with the benefit of an additional 3 months hindsight.
Gratitude - there is nothing like stripping out all of life’s luxuries and being away from home for an extended period of time to highlight how much there is to be grateful for. At first it’s all about running water, hot showers, and real food, but as time progresses the gratitude shifts its focus to family and friends, health, trail maintainers, and the kindness of total strangers.  It is a gift of phenomenal proportions to have the health, support, and wherewithal to be able to disappear into the woods and hike for 5-6 months. And when you are hiking 8-10 hours per day, you have plenty of time to reflect on that.  
Caution - 5,000,000 steps in the wilderness.  What could go wrong?  Well, a lot.  There were parts of the trail where it was clear I was no longer in Kansas (looking at you, Kinsmans).  There is no way to complete the Appalachian Trail without taking risks outside of your normal experience.  Sometimes way outside your normal experience.  Preparation - the right gear, being in shape - help.  Observation and being willing to learn help.  So does making sure you always have a backup plan.
Courage - there are so many kinds of courage. Many of the people I met on the trail were on a journey of recovery - loss of a loved one, health issues, psychological trauma. A number were working through injury, determined not to be stopped. Most were battling the mental grind of getting up each day to march forward, cold, wet, cold and wet, hot, thirsty, hot and thirsty, and always hungry. And almost all of us faced physical challenges that at some point made us uncomfortable, and required mental toughness to overcome.  This is in fact a journey of the spirit in addition to a journey of the body. I admire my fellow hikers more than I can express. 
Humility - honestly, luck plays an outsized role in whether a hiker completes a thru-hike.  Hike-ending injuries can occur in a flash. Family priorities can intrude overnight.  Illness can rear its head, whether hiking related (Lyme, water-borne) or new health concerns.  While I am proud to have completed my thru-hike, I personally know enough determined and capable hikers that had to quit to be circumspect about my accomplishment.  There, but for fortune, could have gone I.  I am also gobsmacked by just how much I did not know when I started last August.  Which makes me suspect that there is still, after 5-½ months of hiking, a lot to learn.
Community - I am awed by the AT community - other thru-hikers, hostel owners, shuttle operators, trail angels, volunteer trail maintainers, small businesses in small trail towns - who collectively operate to support and nurture the hikers on the Appalachian Trail. I have had so many caring and positive encounters on the way, of people paying it forward on a daily basis. Too many to thank - but thank you. It has indeed taken a village for me to finish.
Persistence - it is amazing what can be accomplished by focus and repetition. There was not a mountain I could not climb as long as I kept putting one front in front of the other (hey, sometimes they were tiny steps and I was pretty slow, but I did not go backwards). In a life defined by sunlight hours, I found that you can get a lot done before sunrise. And I found that putting miles on the scoreboard almost every day helped move me steadily towards the end.  And as a side note on persistence: my respect for multi-year thru hikers (“MYTHs”) who complete their 2000 mile status, sometimes over a period of 20 years of 2 week hikes, is immense.  There is no luck here, but love of the trail and pure determination.  Hats off to everyone who achieves this goal.
Joy - I was struck by the number of times I felt deep, concentrated joy.  A stunning sunset.  A bird trilling at dawn.  The Southern Appalachians clothed in fall colors.  A loon on a flat lake with 3 babies on its back.  Dry clothes and hot soup in a hut after a cold, wet, tough hike.  Exiting the 100 Mile Wilderness.  Touching the sign at the top of Katahdin.  It was the purity that struck me, the joy untarnished by anything else in the world at that moment.  These moments are the ones I carry away with me as I return, concentrated pearls of warmth in my memory.
**
In the end, every thru-hiker has a different hike.  I had rain, stream flooding, rattlesnakes, fall foliage, and lighter thru-hiker traffic.  I didn’t have blizzards, giardia, Lyme, the bubble, or bears (to speak of).  If I did the same hike next year, I am convinced my experience, and memories, would be different.  
So this has been the tale of my thru-hike.  Your mileage might vary.",,View Entry,"Aug 02, Wed",0
