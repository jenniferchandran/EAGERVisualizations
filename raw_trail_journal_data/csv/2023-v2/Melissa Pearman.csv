I know this trip will put me to the test emotionally, physically, and spiritually, all I'm hoping for at this point is survival and a bit of humor.
I'll write down my why's so I can see and read them when all I want to do is quit.

First part of the hike today was all uphill and hard, but it was like we were all in a lovely green tunnel. We took a short break at what I think is the best shelter so far.

I don't even remember the hike from eckville to the lookout hostel, but it was a nice stay. We took a much needed zero yesterday. Somehow, my feet hurt more today having a day of rest. I'm so tired of my feet hurting. The Canadian wildfires have created a ton of smoke and haze, although the EPA says the air quality is improving.    The biggest surprise today was our first bear sighting.  We were fairly close together while coming around a corner and all saw it about the same time. It took some time for us to scare the bear off; Graham was scolding him and throwing rocks, I was banging my hiking poles together, and Michelle was yelling at him as well. The bear just looked at us inquisitvely for a few minutes l then sauntered off like nothing happened. We handled it well and it gave us a good dose of adrenaline to finish our hike.

Slack packing is when you have someone who takes all your heavy stuff and you either take your pack with just snacks with water or just some water. So we did 12 miles, had an awesome meal then slack packed another 5 miles. Those last 5 miles included a section of the trail named ""stairway to heaven"" and it was aptly named. A rocky 1,000+ft climb almost straight up. It was lovely to hike all that elevation pack free, then the last 3 miles we were in a torrential downpour.

Since we stayed at the chapel, we were able to leave our heavy things and hike with just food/water once again… so, we did a 10 mile slack pack. It still ended up being a pretty difficult hike due to the wet rocks and mud. Sections of the trail were full muddy streams to hike through. Finished up the day going to a community center where we got showers, a grocery store run to resupply, and dinner at Mexican restaurant. Capped the night off with wine back at the chapel/hostel/shed!

The nice clean feeling didn't last too long with the continued muggy, rainy weather, but it was nice while it lasted. Hard hike out of town with a nice break at a shelter. Continued on another 5 miles to a Shaker campsite. Slipping in mud all day long.

Not nearly as muggy today. Passed a cute AT stand that had a fridge with cold drinks and snacks for a fee with wifi and charging capabilities. There was slightly less mud which was a welcome change. Two steep uphills followed by a long walk around a lake made for a full but not too hard of day. We ended at a cabin in the woods for thru hikers to bunk at. Sat on the dock of the lake and soaked our feet. A few people canned around a bit. The cabin caretaker is making us coffee and pancakes in the morning which will be a great start to our day.

The suction was serious and my shoe stayed in the mud. Thank goodness Fearless dug thru it and was able to get my shoe back out before lost forever.  The mud broke the metal clasp of my gaitor. Lots of scrapes and cuts today with all the rock scrambling. Outside of the alpine bogs where its a choice of which way will be the least wet, there were almost no flat spots.  Steep ups followed by steep downs all day.  Hopefully it was all in order to prepare us for tomorrow at Mahoosuc Notch which is supposedly the most difficult mile on the whole AT.

It was essentially a narrow canyon filled with all manner of collapsed boulders from the surrounding two mountains. With little to no direction on true trail it was a choose your own adventure to get from one end to the other. Climbing over, under, between, around rocks and roots. Some jumps and hops as well as having to remove packs to squeeze through openings. Truly a full body workout to maneuver through. It took us a little over 1.5hrs to travel that mile. And as fun as that was, it was exhausting. So it's unfortunate it is followed by Mahoosuc Arm which is one of the steepest climbs on the AT going up 1500ft+ in just a mile. Most of that was a continuous steep rock slab that really tested the strength of our Achilles tendons.

When we left the vortex of Sherpa's cabin we ended up going to an airbnb Graham found last minute in Rangely. We had been all prepared with food and plans but the storms and rains have been dictating how and where we hike. A rainy afternoon and evening followed by a massive downpour the next day stopped us from hiking one day.  We set up a slack pack while in Rangely but even that got derailed due to a road being washed out. Working with our shuttle drivers knowledge of the area we were able to find a few spots we could get to to hike. Yesterday we were able to slack pack some miles but had to hike down a ski trail to get to the road or we'd be stuck in the woods for days. Unfortunately, that meant today, we had to hike back up that said mountain to get back to the trail head, and man it was a steep climb with not the greatest weather. Raining with very strong wind gusts up on top of Saddleback mountain. 40mph wind made the long exposed above treeline stretch from Saddleback Mountain to Saddleback Horn frigid.  The wind was strong enough that you had to walk at an angle to go straight.  Muddy and cold today with storms coming in this evening, but we made it to a shelter and set up just before another afternoon rain hit.

Hmmm…. Well Maine so far has been tough and muddy. Apparently Maine wants to stay rustic so they don't have many bridges over rivers and streams, there's also word that they don't want the liability of said bridges. With that said we forded our first stream crossing. Went in with shoes and socks on for the traction, it was about mid thigh to knee height on me so only ankle height for Graham. Wasn't too bad, but I'm not really looking forward if there's more. I forgot to mention that the tramily is back together. Michelle decided to hike again and Hero went home for a week and decided he missed us too much. We've been seeing a lot of chipmunks on trail lately. I'm not too familiar with them, they sound like squirrels, but a little higher pitched and their sounds are much, much faster when they yell at you. These ones near the AT seem to be very territorial. When we get close to their area they make it known and stare at you, one actually seemed to be charging towards me, but he went across trail, to guard his nut hord is what I'm assuming.

Day 98-99
Not a bad hike into town where ground control picked us up and we checked into Sterling inn. The place totally reminded me of that show with Bob Newhart, the one where he and his wife had a BNB. It was cute and relaxing. We able to slack pack some miles and get some good rest in. We also taught ground control how to play family dice.

Day 100
I can't believe I've been living in the woods for 100 days!!! Of course some of those are hotels and hostels but still, that blows my mind. Had a steady rain overnight but nothing too crazy. We got to our first river crossing and it went well, only about ankle deep. Found a decent sunny spot for lunch and the group decided to part ways for the day. We knew the next water crossing would be a bit deeper and some didn't want to risk it.  We got to the crossing and I was able to cross without my pack. The water level was about 2 inches above my navel but the current was not strong. Chivalrous Graham crossed thrice and carried my pack for me. The worst part was the trekking poles, actually.  They're there to help you balance, but end up getting in the way with the current. We had planned on stopping at a shelter tonight but decided to push on for the final ankle deep crossing so we wouldn't have to do it in the morning. Found a very nice stealth spot by the stream and made a fire ring to dry out our socks.  We'll  get to Monson tomorrow and get prepared for entering the 100- mile wilderness.

We hiked into Shaws hostel, took a much needed zero and resupplied. I got a new pack and Graham got new shoes!! We've solidified plans for the next week, set up our food drops and are scheduled to summit Katahdin on the 31st/1st. We'll take about 7 or 8 days to get through the 100 mile wilderness which is pretty remote with poor cell service, so probably won't post anything until after. We will have little to no access to roads or towns but the hostel we are at will do a supply drop on a couple logging roads if you can get the timing and logistics set up. We just had a large egg bacon pancake breakfast and then ground control is dropping us at the trailhead. Hopefully the weather holds, we are locked in on the home stretch now.

Melissa Pearman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668422,"Day 103Our zero wasn't as restful as we wanted but we were able to complete all our camp chores. Had the very hearty breakfast again before we headed out. Once again, Ground Control was able to help us slack some miles. We survived 4 water crossings and having to go off trail a bit to meet back up to get our packs. The off trail ""trail"" quickly turned into a mud maze, but we found him, grabbed our gear and headed back to stealth site along the river. The mud has been rough but we have started in the 100-mile wilderness and that just feels like such an accomplishment in itself.   Melissa's fall count: 78Beginning mile marker: 2083.7Ending mile marker: 2098Nearest city/town: caratunk, maine14.3Stealth siteDay 104 Started the day out with Graham breaking his hip belt strap. Without being able to tighten the pack, he had to take the pack just on his shoulders for the first miles of the day. On our first break, I was able to sew the strap then we used a safety pin and duck tape to help secure it. It cant be adjusted on that side, but at least weight can be transferred to the waist somewhat. Fingers crossed it lasts(at least 90 more miles)!! Long day of hiking, my legs didn't start the day feeling well rested at all. We made it the shelter for evening and bedding down early. It'll be an early start tomorrow the rain and we've got to meet where our first food drop is.   Melissa's fall count: 82Beginning mile marker: 2098Ending mile marker: 2109.9Nearest city/town: caratunk, maine11.9Chair back gap lean to Day 105We woke up 500am to get an early start in hopes of beating some of the rain down the mountain and reach our supply drop in time. We got over the hard part before rain, but then got to the logging road early. We huddled under the cab of a caterpillar back-ho to stay dry while waiting. The food drop eventually came and the guy brought left over pizza, and pancakes which we quickly downed, before the hitting the rainy trail. We pressed straight for the next shelter in the hopes of getting dry and warming up. A high of 50 and constant rain made it a very chilly day. Hot tea helps. Hunkering down here for the night hoping tomorrow is warmer.  Melissa's fall count: 84Beginning mile marker: 2109..9Ending mile marker: 2119.8Nearest city/town: caratunk, maine9.9Carl newhall lean to Day 106 We had a nice, long rest getting to the shelter so early yesterday. It rained all night, so I'm glad we all got a spot in the shelter. A lot of elevation today but that's the end of that until Katahdin. Today was Michelle's birthday so at lunch we sang to her and gave her the confetti whoopie pie with a candle in it. We also packed in a little wine to cheers with. She was very appreciative for the little we can do while we're in the woods. Fearless even made her moose poo out of mud. Melissa's fall count: 86Beginning mile marker: 2119.8Ending mile marker: 2130.6Nearest city/town: caratunk, maine10.8East branch lean toDay 107 Got on trail at 7am to make sure we'd make our food drop in time. Nice surprise to get trail magic today! Snacks and sodas! It was from a couple who just recently summited and are making their way home. Lunched at a lovely spot with some sunshine next to a roaring waterfall. Got back on a trail to find more trail magic at the next logging road. It was such a good day with good trail. Grilled chicken, taters, snacks, and sodas. Ground Control met us at the road with news that he had found another way to slack us. It will only be a small change to our plans and the prospect of knocking out 15 miles without packs is enticing. It didn't take us long to gather our packs and decide to have a real bed and a shower for the evening. Melissa's fall count: 87Beginning mile marker: 2130.6Ending mile marker: 2142.4Nearest city/town: caratunk, maine11.8Airbnb","Shaws hostel

We had a great breakfast before getting a ride back out to the trail. On the way in we passed several hunting groups all coming out to hunt bears. It was so nice to hike on easy trail with no heavy packs. We had our first clear view of Katahdin and man, it's a pretty mountain. Still can't believe we are just days away. The campground is quite beautiful and has a picnic table!! Right off Namakhanta Lake with a beautiful sunset view. Those have been few and far between since New Hampshire. It's amazing how nice it is to sit at the end of a long day. The couple camping next to us has a yearly tradition of spending a week out here. They brought us over hot dogs, spaghetti, and smores for a nice treat. That was a great surprise, however he also tossed several massive tree trunk logs on our fire leaving us to monitor it until much later in the evening then we would like.

Day 109 
Pretty sunrise last night on the lake. We were hoping for a moose sighting, but that hasn't happened yet. Hiking through maine has been beautiful with such vibrant green moss and ferns, but so so much mud. I ended up falling, big surprise, but twisted my ankle. Not going to be a game changer at all, but it'll slow me down. Long day if hiking.

What an amazing few days it's been. We summited 9/1/23 and it took a few days for it to sink in and feel real. In one way I was so ready for the northern part to be done, and the other part doesn't want it to end. Dave's cousin and wife drove up, and Jens son flew in to all join us on the climb. The actual hike was hard but fun. Of course, the elevation was a factor, but the rock scrambling increased the difficulty. The morning was cold and increasingly windy as we moved past treeline. It was a constant adjustment of clothing layers to balance out cold, wind, sweat, and heat from exertion. We found a sunny wind free spot halfway up to break for lunch and regroup as we had spread out during the rock scrambles. We then pressed on through the last scrambles to reach the table-lands before the peak where the difficulty eased. As we got to the final part, the 30mph winds died away and became one of the nicer days of the whole trail. The views were amazing and our joy palpable. We lingered up top for over an hour. We then started down a different trail that while shorter and steeper had fewer big scrambles. I think I've perfected the butt slide though, which makes it a lot more fun and easier to get down, you just have to control the landing. After the hike, we went back to the airbnb for a celebratory pizza party. Liz (our trail supporter from parts of NY to Mass) drove up from NY to surprise and congratulate us. It was such an awesome time to relax and enjoy company with the tramily without the added stress of having to hike the next day. We all said it was the best night of sleep we have had in a long time. It will be sad to part ways but look forwarding to our paths crossing in the southern section for a last hooray.
