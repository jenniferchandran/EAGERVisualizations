Michael Braver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660002,"I'm sure you have heard that hiking the AT in any fashion whether thru hiking or in sections is not a trip, but a journey. A journey with ups and downs wins and losses. You wont get an argument from me on that issue that is for sure. As this will be my first pre hike entry I will attempt to give you a quick synopsis of the back story and boy, we have come a long way.
In 2016 I planned this very same thru hike with my oldest daughter who is an avid outdoorswomen and hiker. All was good as she had applied for a position with the National Park Service as a Park Ranger for the 2017 season in Alaska where she had settled 2 years earlier.  All plans were ready to go when I got a call from her that they offered her a job for 2016 if she could start immediately. 'Dad I have no choice I have waited for ever for this' she said. I decided since my plan was so closely tied to doing this with her, I would hold off for a year.
A year turned into 6 years while she climbed the ladder with the NPS and fell in love with a fellow Alaskan transplant from Ohio. We decided 2023 was the year of the hike.  In September of 2022 my family were on our way to Alaska for her marriage which took place in a beautiful glacier area outside of Seward where she resides. The week before we left I was running up a flight of wooden steps to our back door in our home in Atlanta when I stumbled and fell on my left knee. No real issue as I'm a klutz from way back when; I was always hitting my head or falling down. Off we went to Alaska where we had to 'hike out' to the wedding ceremony which was far off the paved road (everything in Alaska is off the paved road-there are so few paved roads at all). When I came home from Alaska and got off the plane I had great pain in my knee and i couldnt' straighten it out. When to the ortho guy and the RMI said torn miniscus and strained MCL strained/torn posterior oblique. HUH? I had no choice with the hike coming in March 2023 but to rehab my knee as quickly as possible as not doing this was not an option.
I rehabbed, streched and walked and walked. It felt better but I still had not tested it hiking on the AT or a similiar type surface. And I had not tested it carrying a backpack loaded down with my stuff. I first hiked 8 miles and the next day 8 miles again to see if I could recover; after all on the trail we hike every day rain or shine. Slowly my knee didnt' hurt every day I woke up and I hiked with a 40 lb pack to test it out. In January 2023 I had a final appointment with my ortho guy hoping he would give me the thumbs up. He did kind of. He said I had rehabbed dillegently and my knee was sound-anything I did to it on the trail he could fix when I got off.
Sooo I guess March 18, 2023 is game on with my oldest by my side. She has decided she will hike with me to Damascus which is about 6 weeks from the start so she 'could keep an eye on me until I knew what I was doing'.
I don't know how I lived the last 68 years without her oversight but I did!
Back next time with what I'm carrying and how much it weighs.",,View Entry,"Jan 30, Mon",0
Michael Braver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660003,"Sooner or later everyone wants to know the same thing 'how much does your backpack weigh' which is closely followed by ridicule and sneering by all the experts saying too much weight and what does your big three weigh? Yup everyone is an expert in what weight you need to carry to have a successful thru hike. All of this is quickly followed by the comment of HYOH. As well it should. I'm carrying the pack why should I concern myself as to what YOU think I should carry. I must add that all of these discussions are all pre hike fodder. No one cares a flip and no one asks how much you are carrying once you step on the trail at Springer or Katahdin.
While we are on the subject of HYOH lets discuss some commonly used terms and phrases you will hear on my journal and others. Like all secret societies, hikers have some special words and sayings that we use to make us appear different and elite. Haha not really but we do have a few you should know:
HYOH-hike your own hike. It is said when you want people to mind their own business.    No pain, no gain, no Maine- you will make physical, mental and financial sacrifices to complete the hike no matter what. I agree with this one wholeheartedly. This is not an endeavor for the weak.    'It's not the mountain we conquer, but ourselves'-it has long been considered that the mental aspect of leaving our lives, wives, kids and friends behind are the toughest things to overcome out there. I think it is the mental aspect of doing the same thing every day over the same pointless ups and downs that makes some quit.   Pointless Ups and Downs PUDS- the AT is made up of thousands of steps up and over hundreds of nameless hills and mountains, hence the name mindless comes to mind.    Gaps, Notches, Saddlebacks-valley's between mountains. See pointless ups and downs.
There will be more phrases and terms to add to later on but those are a good start.
BACKPACK WEIGHTS- When one goes to hike for a day or two in a casual manner it really does not matter what the weight of your pack really is. Especially when you are going out in a car or truck to your spot and literally just hiking to a destination for a day or two. But when hiking for a substantial amount of distance for a longer period of time with no means of transport but your feet, it matters a lot. This is your portable house you are carrying; tent, sleeping bag, food, clothes, water, stove to cook with, first aid supply, rain gear (rains on AT virtually 62% of the time you are on it-like 110 days out of 180 on typical hike) electronics. All the above are the BASICS we all must carry to make our portable house complete. Most say that your backpack should never exceed 20% of your body weight. I weigh about 182 so my pack in theory should not weigh more then 36 lbs. That my friend is alot of weight to haul across 2200 miles. I have carried 38 lbs in a short 10-mile hike with a big Osprey pack and it was no picnic! 
My pack is a ULA CIrcuit which is an ultralight (2.5lb) that will carry up to 35 lbs comfortably. I will start out on my hike with 28 lbs total including food for 4 days and water (2 liters or 32oz). That weight with food and water is considered a fair and reasonable pack weight. As winter ends it will get much lighter with the sending home of winter clothes. That weight however is not considered ultralight by today's standards. Many young and accomplished hikers will carry 10-16 lbs including food, water and clothes. They will wear one pair of underwear, one or two pairs of socks and the same shirt and pants for the whole hike. They will cold soak their food to eliminate cooking stoves which add more weight. They will camp with no tents or sleeping bags, choosing to sleep in hammocks strung between trees. Many older hikers cannot conceive enjoying a hike of this distance without taking some luxury items, like a pillow or a blanket. 
My BIG THREE are not ultralight by any standard: Tent is a two person Marmot weighing 4 lbs. my Sleep System is a total of 4 lbs. (bag, liner and sleeping pad) and my Food for 4 days (average carry length) with Bear Vault 450 cannister is 7 lbs. My clothes are 6 lbs. for winter. What is left is miscellaneous stuff like first aid, electronics, buffs, hats, water system, beanies, stove and pot, trowel and the like. 28 lbs does not go very far as you see, but the idea of lugging anything over 30 lbs.is unthinkable, even in winter. Summer for me should be 21 lbs.

Michael Braver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660111,"If you have read the first couple of entries and have not abandoned reading my dribble, I think it may be time to tell you a bit about this old man who wants to wander for a couple thousand miles. In the woods In the snow In the rain In the winter, spring and summer Oh and I'm taking my kid along for company and her professional guidance(?).

I mentioned how my oldest and partner in crime on the AT is a true blue outdoorswoman and a genuine badass. More on that later. This child has been to countless countries around the world, hiking usually by herself with only a pack, a tent and a sleeping bag. She absolutely loves the mountains and trails, the more remote and sans electric, water and bathroom the better. My wife and I don't even ask where she is going; my wife's retort is 'just go I don't want to know'. Over the last few years she has settled down in Alaska, found a Prince Charming and lives full time in Seward. She usually takes solo assignments that last throughout the spring and summer in National Parks throughout the state. Most parks operate and welcome guests spring through early fall only. This allows many NPS employees to have winter to themselves. My Alaskan daughter however usually choses to spend every other fall and winter at our Florida beach house that we have in Melbourne Beach. As much as she loves being ridiculously off the grid, our girl loves the beach, beer and her Salt Life.
I must admit she does come by her love of the great outdoors honestly. For my entire life I have dealt with my wanderlust for all things out there. I'm forever figuring out a way to get way out there from here. I have travelled to many different countries, switched careers to become an Over-the-road truck driver so I could see more of this amazing country (got to 47 states), drive my motorcycle up and down the Blue Ridge Parkway and anywhere I can see, smell and feel the outdoors. I grew up during a time where you didn't just go off the grid. Although I read and subscribe to Timothy Leary when he writes ""turn on, tune in, drop out' I had a family and goals to attain before I checked out for good. 
With unlimited respect, admiration and love for my fabulous and supportive wife and a lifetime of both of us making sound and prudent financial decisions my go time is here. I feel that my time is here and now. I'll be 69 on March 18 when I l get on the trail.Look deep into nature and you will understand everything better...Einstein",,View Entry,"Feb 10, Fri",0
Michael Braver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660143,"With about a month until my start date I decided that my legs and recently injured left knee(see previous entry) need some help. Last time I hiked on the AT for a practice trip I noticed on most all uphill climbs my breathing seemed to be compromised. A lot. As in I have to stop for a couple minutes to catch my breath. When I had my chemo work up from when I had Hodgkin Lymphoma in 2016 (shout out to Moffitt Cancer Center that saved my life) I was told I had COPD and that in the future I may have some breathing issues. To be honest I have never felt my COPD as I used to do HIIT exercises and was until last year running semi-regularly. But the uphill’s seem to be serving me a reminder that I have work to do.
Now I know that while COPD cannot be reversed or cured it can be lessened by guess what?  Yup walking which is hiking which I will be doing a bunch of soon. So my training is treadmill walking for 30 minutes, wall squats, leg extensions and quad stretches followed by walking on a stair master at medium speed for as long as possible. Right now that’s not a very long time. I got 3+ minutes done before my heart rate shot to 130 and I had to rest. I think I need to work to at least 8-10 minutes at that rate to feel good about my ability to go uphill. If I can’t go uphill I sure as heck can’t go downhill, which is tougher on my knees anyway. 
I’m a big believer that thru-hiking and the skills needed to be successful and reach Mt Katahdin are more of a mental game than a physical one. Many people say the trail will get your body in shape eventually but no one says the trail will get your head right by hiking every day. Just thinking about being on the AT away from home makes me miss my wife and dog but I know I can push through and succeeded. But I do need to be able to control my heart rate and ability to breathe to even last a week so a-training I will go 3 times a week until I push off. Hopefully I’ll have a progress report to send out in a couple of weeks.",,View Entry,"Feb 14, Tue",0
Michael Braver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660348,"March 1 and 17 days to go! Sounds exciting until I start focusing on what feels like 150 things I must complete before taking a step. Checking out of reality for oh say 6 months is an impossible task. Another impossible task is having my wife- pay monthly bills (has no clue how to pay bills online-never had to for over 32 years), make arrangements to have service done on her SUV, change filters in AC, take the dog to the vet, order repairs and maintenance for our homes. Honestly it is a long list but I have done it for so long it seems easy to me. We paid the bills together one time and she was so upset about how much money we spent keeping up our homes and lifestyle that she was physically ill for the rest of the day. Never did it again but she is going to do it in April and May and June and.... My wife is incredibly smart, dedicated and quick on her feet so I'm sure she will do great. But I gotta tell you she will need constant reminders and probably a few Facetime call to get it all done. Missing payments and being late on mortgages is not an option.In addition to the above I have to by March 15 hire a CPA and an attorney for some continuing tax work, sell my Prius Hybrid, spray pre-emergent on yard, paint/touchup decks in Atlanta home, hire and get landscaper to work on 'palm trees gone wild adventure' at our Florida home, teach wife to use pool heater and pump set up. Between now and the 15th I will be bouncing from Florida to Georgia to North Carolina just setting everything up to run by itself for a few months.Oh yeah and I haven't hiked or walked 50 yards with my loaded backpack in 6 weeks. The simplistic task of HYOH and putting one foot in front and having hiking being your only function for an entire day seems very distant to me right now.BTW does anyone want to buy a 2013 Toyota Prius??",,View Entry,"Mar 01, Wed",0
Michael Braver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660483,"Sold the Prius!
Actually sold it to the first person to come see it and drive it. Selling stuff online is such a difficult task when it really shouldn't be- everyone wants a deal and the folks looking for cars just low ball you regardless of the condition or year. You ask for $9500 they offer you $6000 or even less. And they all come with sob stories of sick family members and that the $6k is all the money they have in the world. Or will you take payments? Maybe we can do a lease? If I was not seriously trying to sell this car it would be amusing. But I'm not and it's not. All that being said sold the car to a husband-and-wife team (she actually came just to see if the car 'was as pretty as the pictures') who owned another Hybrid car and wanted another one so they could sell their non-hybrid model. Sweet! Tag title and money in the bank by 1pm!
Down in Florida tying up loose ends (never going to complete) and spending times with neighbors and friends that I'm not going to see for a long time hopefully. Everyone seems excited about the adventure and they all quickly add 'have fun we will be right here'. Except for Bobby.
Bobby is one of my closet bud's in Florida and lives across the street from us on the cul-de-sac. Keeps an eye on our home whenever we are not here and puts water in the pool as needed. Retired EMS fireman and native Floridian that retired early and has since started 2 more careers. Lean and trim, Bob looks like he is 43 not 63 and has done some amazing things in his life. Pro level surfer, he has climbed El Capitan in California and numerous other mountains out west. I guess you could say Bob is a man's man, if there is such a thing. All I know is Bob says he is going to meet me on the AT somewhere this summer and hike with me for a few days. I am crazy excited about that happening and it just adds to the adventure getting ready to bust out. 
Miss Badass and myself have decided we are going to stay at our family cabin in western NC on the eve of our start date. We are hoping my wife and other daughter will join us and maybe hike a mile or 2 with us. The long-range weather forecast for March 18-24 is pretty good; day temps in the 50-60's nite temps in mid 40's and rain every 2 days (normal for early spring) so we're pretty psyched to get moving.",,View Entry,"Mar 07, Tue",0
Michael Braver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660823,"After a quick bout of Montezuma’s Revenge four damn days before we start and a new job offer for Ranger Badass in Alaska we are finding we may have to push our start back a day to March 19. The Ranger has a phone interview that would be exceedingly difficult to do from Springer Mountain and I have to get some strength back (lost 6 lbs in 72 hours) so we think it’s best to wait a day.
We have seen the weather reports and they are not too bad-our first day is cold and dry the second day pretty much the same except for late day showers and for March 21 and 22 it’s snow showers turning into just cold rain. I can deal with it all; I just didn’t want to start the first day in the rain and mud and slush. I think we will be OK.

Michael Braver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661131,Out early trying to get on track for daily shelter stops. The AT in Georgia has shelters approximately every 8-10 miles which make them reasonable daily stopping points.Quick shelter story about a dumb rookie mistake; we are both carrying bear canisters and at nite at shelters all food products are put in canister and placed in bins. Except when the rookie/me forgets a couple packs of tortillas that were left in the very bottom of my pack. Since noises are normal in shelters during the night we didn’t alert to the many number of mice that worked their way to my backpack and ate thru every bag of tortillas but also 2 of my stuff sacks! What a mess and I had to carry them out with me as the 1st garbage can on the AT is not for 20 miles!That plus I now have nothing to eat my peanut butter on. Bummer.,"Stover Shelter

Woke up this morning with pretty severe pain in my left knee which is the one with the torn miniscus and strained patella. Seems like the pain is bearable when I am hiking uphill and flat but becomes more acute on downhills. And when you go up 1000 plus feet you must soon after come down. When I set up my tent I eventually have to get on my knees to climb in, climb out and move around. Setting up last night I had to shift my weight from knee to knee and my left kneecap was so painful I ended up rolling in my tent to change positions. This all sucks so much as I now am kicking myself for not taking more intense pre-hikes to test my knee. I took the don’t ask don’t tell approach and I’m looking like an idiot. This was a very short hike today and I am in more pain then yesterday’s 9 mile plus hike.Definitely moving on in the morning and hoping with Ibuprofen and a topical solution I have less pain tomorrow.","Horse Gap

Michael Braver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661295,"It is not happening this year. I took a big chance in thinking I would be able to recover daily to keep on moving but it was not to be.
I knew all along I was taking a big chance with my left knee. I had never had a knee or leg issue or hell even a broken bone in my entire life until I tripped going up stairs in September. I had hiked previously with zero issues. While my orthopedic Dr gave me the OK to go, I was told I still needed to have arthroscopic surgery to clean out my knee and look at my patella for further damage. Hike at your own risk. I choose to go and ignore his advice and hike without a pre-hike trip to test my knee on the actual ups and downs. I didn’t want to know I couldn’t do this. Another Dumb mistake was I also chose to hike without any real physical training on my body-I didn’t want to be told by my body I wasn’t ready.
Bottom line is I woke up last week and couldn’t get out of my tent to walk up the hill to the privy or to get water filtered. My daughter the Badass was shocked when I told her I couldn’t continue; I told her it was not the least bit fun doing this and that yes I was a loser and a quitter for not sucking this up and moving forward. And so I got a shuttle to a local motel, called my wife to see if she could pick me up as I couldn’t find a rental car to get home. She was not happy. No one was happy. As I waited for her the total devastation of my decision washed over me-planning, buying, testing, researching, waiting and waiting. For what? I couldn’t make 30 miles.
I am home and physically trying to recover-my knee is swollen and structurally all over the place. I know my knee will improve enough eventually for me to walk. Even with my family’s encouragement around me my failure to assess properly has put me in a deep funk that looks dark and distant. 
I have decided to take my daughter’s advise however; I’m going to rehab my knee somewhat over the next 3 weeks and go back out on the trail and ‘truck hike’ some portions all the way to Maine. This is done by driving to a gap, park my truck and then day hike as far as I can that day then catch a shuttle back to my truck and continue up north. I will stay in hostels along the way. I will pick the areas that are somewhat flat with no big descents (killer for all bum knees) and still be able to enjoy the camaraderie of hiking and being outdoors. I will also become a part time trail angel and set up with donuts water and bananas for my fellow NOBO hikers, especially on rainy, lousy days. The kind of days you pray to find some trail magic.  Kind of trying to give back to the trail and the community sounds pretty good right now.
So that’s the plan-as of today of course this idea seems far far away. I find it hard to reach out of my funk to walk our Golden Retriever no less hike and become productive again. Feeling sorry for myself has no future though so standby-I may have a little more hiking in me yet.","Gooch Shelter
