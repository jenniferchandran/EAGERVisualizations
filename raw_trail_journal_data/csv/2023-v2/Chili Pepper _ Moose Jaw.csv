As usual,... we are still up getting things ready to hit the trail tomorrow. We have food packed, but we need to add final items to our packs. We are excited and nervous to start the AT tomorrow. Be tuned for gear photos soon!",,View Entry,"Mar 23, Thu",0
Chili Pepper & Moose Jaw,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661542,"We went on little sleep before we left Peachtree City to Amicalola Falls‚Ä¶. About 4 hours. I (Chili Pepper) was exhausted. I slept for about 45 minutes in the car on the way to the trailhead. When we arrived we went to hiker orientation. Is was not long after receiving our AT Thru-Hiker tag that we were teased for how much food we packed and our pack weights. Fred and Lily were so kind to help us complete a pack shakedown! They were great, even though Fred was a little intense. HA! Two and a half hours later we had a bounce box full of items from our pack we decided we didn‚Äôt need. We ended up forwarding the items to an inn in Fontana Dam. Day 1 was rough. The trail started with 600 stairs to the top of a beautiful waterfall. With our late start, around 3 in the afternoon, we knew it would be challenging to hit the first shelter. So about 5.3 miles in we found a campsite to stay for the night. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs storming with lots of wind and rain. I hope we stay dry!!","Amicalola Falls Arch (AT Approach Trail)

Chili Pepper & Moose Jaw,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661543,"It stormed hard last night! 40 mph winds tore up our tent stakes to our tarp twice and it soaked the bottom of our hammocks. Despite pouring water out of my (Chili Pepper‚Äôs) boot we were in fairly good spirits. It was misty in the morning, which made the trail seem serene. We met a lot more people today also thru-hiking!! They have all been so kind! Springer Mountain had a gorgeous view. It‚Äôs nice that we are hitting miles that actually count now. It‚Äôs only Day 2 and we have received trail magic! I drank a Koolaid Jammer handed out from a Georgia AT Ridgerunner named Mountain Squid. Another Ridgerunner was there named Moxie. She told us about something called the ‚Äútickler.‚Äù A ‚Äútickler‚Äù is where the cone shaped mound of human feces nearly tickles your bum at the privy, because it gets too high! At one privy she has to use a rake and mow it over. I laughed so hard!! She‚Äôs the real MVP. Up until camp, we hiked with a gentleman who decided to hike the trail less than a week prior to starting! I was shocked and in awe at the same time. He seemed to be more prepared than us! I can‚Äôt remember his name, but I called him Saturday in my head since he said he decided to start trail last Saturday. He hobbled into Hawk Mountain Campsite with us. When we arrived, our feet were killing us! At camp we realized we got sunburnt, and once we sat to eat we didn‚Äôt want to get up. We took ibuprofen, and now we are reading scripture and planning our day tomorrow. We hiked 10.5 miles today, even though most of it doesn‚Äôt count towards the total mileage for the AT.","Tentsite before Black Gap Shelter

This morning we met Ray when we were packing up camp. We were the last ones left at the campsite. Ray was so kind! He said we were the first hikers he‚Äôs met that wasn‚Äôt stressed about mileage, and he cherished that about us. That made me feel really good about how Moose Jaw and I are approaching this journey. A few miles into our hike we rested and received more trail magic at Horse Gap! Infamous Miss Janet was hilarious and gave us drinks and food. According to Miss Janet, ‚ÄúDrink before you‚Äôre thirsty. Eat before you‚Äôre hungry. Rest before you‚Äôre tired.‚Äù She‚Äôs extremely kind and loves her hikers. A couple of trail runners came through the area and she told them to ‚Äúnot make my babies feel bad about themselves.‚Äù HA! At this area we also met another Nick. He told Nicholas his name should be handsome because he has ‚Äúbeautiful eyes and perfect teeth and great hair.‚Äù That made me laugh!! I agree with this Nick.¬†We hiked the next section to cooper‚Äôs creek with Courtesy. He‚Äôs such a kind man. He told us about geezer breaks where you stop and lean on your poles to rest. He learned this from a man he has hiked with before. He also taught us the principles of Leave No Trace. That was super helpful! At Cooper‚Äôs Creek we received trail magic again! Some beef jerky, water, and a clif bar from White Wolf. His daughter Twilight was section hiking parts of trail. After getting some water we finished our hike into camp. We have seen a lot of people at this campsite,‚Ä¶ the most we have seen on trail!! It‚Äôs supposed to rain tonight. We saw the Germans and Ray again here at Gooch Gap. We didn‚Äôt mingle much because we were exhausted. We are about to work on a hiking plan for tomorrow. Oddly, the pads of my big toes are numb! That freaks me (Chili Pepper) out a little bit.","Hawk Mountain Campsite

Chili Pepper & Moose Jaw,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661582,"It rained last night, and Nicholas got a little bit wet. Sleeping bunk style in our hammocks makes it challenging to get our tarp down to the ground (mostly due to our ridge lines). After we woke up early we hung around camp and talked to the Germans (Jan, Christopher, and Robin). We also played some music! Two mouth harps, a harmonica, and a nose harp. This was a lot of fun!! Of course, we were the last ones to leave camp again, but that‚Äôs just fine with me!! However, we got a late start to the day because of that. We met Privy today. Ex-military. He got his name because the first night out he slept in the privy during Day 1‚Äôs horrendous thunderstorm. Honestly, I don‚Äôt blame him one bit!! He‚Äôs super kind and funny. We heard he was blown up and had cranial reconstructive surgery. I hope he makes it to Maine! As we were walking he saw me choke on some water. He told me that I‚Äôm supposed to ‚Äúchew the air before swallowing.‚Äù This made me laugh!! I know this will be a new saying in our household. At Woody Gap we received trail magic from Spices‚Äôs mom. We called her Mama Spices. Her real name was Karen. Today Moose Jaw hiked most of the way with Jan. They had a great time talking, and we have learned a lot about Germany. Jan said he learned most of American culture through his favorite TV show,‚Ä¶ South Park. HA! We are hoping to stay in a cabin tomorrow. Fingers crossed we find availability. We also met jukebox today. He sings to himself all day long, hence is trail name. Our hammock setup is getting tedious. It seems as if the nice trees we find with flat ground below there are already people there with tents. Plus setup and tear down take quite awhile. Also, I miss talking to Moose Jaw at night. It‚Äôs hard to hear each other in our separate hammocks. We had our first campfire around dinner time. It was fun, and many people hung out with us! It was a nice time. ‚ò∫Ô∏è","Gooch Gap Shelter

Chili Pepper & Moose Jaw,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661976,"Today was a little rough early on. I didn‚Äôt sleep well because we had issues with our hammock setup and Nicholas was basically grounded so he was freezing cold. He kept moving and his movements kept me awake. It was rough night‚Äôs sleep. Then we were irritated with each other some of the walk,... understandable since we didn‚Äôt sleep the best! However, that turned around quickly. We had a good time talking to River Runner. He took our picture, and told us that he loves that a married couple gets to experience the trail together. He got his trail name in the 80s when he was chasing after another female hiker along a river. Apparently they were camping together. Ray got his name from some beautiful hipped when he hiked the Colorado trail.¬†
The top of Blood Mountain was gorgeous!! The views were great. We made it to Neels Gap and bought a frozen pizza and stayed in a cabin at Blood Mountain Cabins. At the outfitter we hung out with the Germans, low key, and Josh. I saw J, but he seemed to keep to himself. I hope he finishes the hike. He seems like a nice guy! We were sooo happy to shower. We went through our packs again and we are hoping to ship more items home tomorrow. I talked to my mom, dad, and younger brother today. I really miss everyone!","Lance Creek Restoration Area

Couldn‚Äôt have heard any truer words on trail. Nicholas likes to add, ‚ÄúAlso, never trust a fart.‚ÄùWe left Neels Gap today. It was so nice sleeping in a bed last night. Today for lunch we met Bag Man, Drunken Monkey, and Sits and Frowns. Everyone was a lot of fun. We hiked most of the day with Courtesy!
At the gap we met Old Bay and Whispering Moose. They set up their tents near us. We ended up staying up past dark talking about celery. Whispering Moose says they are spicy dirt sticks. I agreed with him that they taste disgusting but Old Bay loves celery!! It made me chuckle when Whispering Moose said that carrots and celery are given with wings for a reason,‚Ä¶ they are overgrown and the most disliked vegetable. I‚Äôm not sure I agree with carrots being a part of that, but I see what he means about the celery! It is rather cheap at the store too!","Neels Gap

As we made our way down to Unicoi Gap we ran into Courtesy. He was actually there to pick us up and take us into town! He‚Äôs VERY courteous!! He even gave us Gatorade!!! He has been a great companion on our hike so far. He has sure made us laugh a lot! Courtesy, Moose Jaw, Old Bay, and I went into the town of Hiawassee. We first got breakfast and then went to the outfitter. There we purchased trail runners and a 3P tent. We had finally given up on the Hammocks. It seems that this trail is more conducive to tents. After the outfitter we went to the hardware store to make a tent footprint. After Courtesy dropped Mosse Jaw and I off at the Budget Inn, we showered and then walked to the grocery store, Ingles, to resupply. We shouldn‚Äôt have gone hungry,‚Ä¶ we purchased too much food. Courtesy picked us up from the grocery store to go to the brewery with him and Old Bay. Dinner was a lot of fun!! We saw the Australians Shelly and Dan. Shelly had a lot of wine but she seemed so happy and as always she was super sweet! Old Bay has been great! He‚Äôs super funny, ex-military, and is an avid back-packer. He showed us this App to keep track of our journey. Today was a good day!

I‚Äôm shocked we walked so much today. We are so tired. We can‚Äôt wait for our zero day! We hiked mostly with Old Bay. It was great! I‚Äôve been in a good mood today. We shuttled to Unicoi after the rain storm this morning. There was a dad in the parking lot called Joke-o John. He was following his daughter who is also thru-hiking. He offered us snacks, but we were full from breakfast. We met a man named Karma on trail. He told us that in the past the Budget Inn had bed bugs. I‚Äôm glad we checked for those and that we are out of that place. It was disgusting! I guess that‚Äôs what you get for $60 per night. We ran in Lily today, and she said in places like those we should stick our packs in the bathtub (that‚Äôs smart). We also met Lost and Found today. Old Bay, Moose Jaw and I actually reunited her with her headphones. They had fallen off of her a ways back. It was extremely windy today. We passed up many shelters due to the high winds and potential widow makers (down trees and dead branches). We finally made it to Deep Gap Shelter, and of course I burned the noddles.

I (Chili Pepper) took two steps and my pack felt extremely heavy, despite feeling light the day before when we hiked 13.1 miles. We hiked to Dick‚Äôs Creek Gap with Old Bay. As we arrived, there was trail magic. A group of female hikers were there serving thru-hikers tomato soup and grilled cheese. It was delicious!! They call themselves the hiking group with a drinking problem. Ha! Nicholas and I talked to the ladies for two hours while waiting on our ride to Henson Cove B&B. We are taking a zero day tomorrow to rest up before we head into North Carolina! One lady I met graduated from Notre Dame. She‚Äôs very familiar with the area I grew up in. We also met Van Daddy. He‚Äôs following his wife who‚Äôs thru-hiking! He‚Äôs funny and extremely kind.

Today was nothing short of amazing, peaceful, wonderful,‚Ä¶ the list could go on! Henson Cove Bed & Breakfast is wonderful! We woke up to the smell of breakfast. Dave and Mariah cooked us scrambled eggs, bacon, and puffy pancakes with fresh fruit. Breakfast was superb!! We sat in a cute little corner table facing the mountains while eating our breakfast. Afterwards I had tea and took my time catching up on posting photos and journal entries. I have to post them all once I get wifi. After relaxing, moose Jaw and I planned the next four days of our hike: how many miles per day, where we will be sleeping, and how much food we need. Mariah then drove us to town to let us run some much needed errands. We stopped at Trailful Outfitters again to get a couple of items (The people that work here are great! They let us weigh our items and cut up our trail book to send parts home.), and then we stopped at the post office to mail more items home. This will be package #4 we have shipped. Of course Tiffany helped us again, and she was so sweet!! She said she had something for us and then gave us two mini bananas!! They were delicious and oh so cute!! Then we walked to Ingles to get some more food, and then next door to a local ice cream shop, Blazin‚Äô Scoops. This place was adorable and had amazing milkshakes! I (Chili Pepper) got a strawberry cookies n‚Äô cream milkshake. Moose Jaw went the chocolate and peanut butter route. The shop had Bible verses written on chalk boards at each table. I loved that! One sign had ‚Äú2 Corinthians 12:9-11‚Äù written on it. There was a Bible laid out so you could look up the verses. Dave picked us up to take us back to the Bed & Breakfast. He is an engineer, loves car racing, and once lived in New York. He also drives like it!! However, Dave and Mariah have been extremely kind. They treated us with wine tonight. Cabernet Sauvignon. It was delicious! I did find out that my head was really dry. I kept itching it and was paranoid I had bugs in my hair. Moose Jaw searched for any and only found dandruff. So, I did a deep conditioning treatment to help with the dryness. Moose Jaw and I definitely feel pampered here. Today was pure bliss!! ü•∞","Dick‚Äôs Creek

We met Lindsey and Whitney about five miles in. They are from the mid-west as well. They are section hikers and are super nice!! Tropical Dr. Seuss greeted us at the NC/GA border.

We wanted to walk further, but there were bear problems at the next campsite (Carter‚Ä¶ apparently this has been an issue for years). However, we will likely walk 12 miles tomorrow. Our friends got their bear bag taken by a bear at Carter Shelter. Fortunately, other hikers gave them some food to last until their next resupply. I actually got to read today! That was nice. :)
Bag Man keeps calling Nicholas Wish Mamoa, because you order Jason Mamoa on Wish and then Nicholas arrives (even though Nicholas is >> Jason Mamoa). We met Liz tonight. She‚Äôs nice and works in forestry (I couldn‚Äôt hear much outside of that). I can tell she‚Äôs super smart and very interested in ecology. Lindsay and Whitney camped near us tonight. We talked about how Bag Man shot a beaver once that was messing up the area they go diving in. It was making the water murky. He showed us a picture and this sucker was HUGE! He said it was so heavy he could barely hold it with two hands. We deemed him Bag Man Beaver Slayer. He got the name Bag Man because he rescues people‚Äôs bear bags out of trees and he also gives lessons on how to hang a bear bag PCT style. It‚Äôs pretty nifty.","Muskrat Shelter

It was breathtaking! The mountains and trees were gorgeous, and seemed to go on and on. Apparently, at this spot Bag Man the Beaver Slayer said that I like to narrate things. HA! I never noticed that I did. We hiked to Albert mountain. I was sweaty and disgusting but the view was worth it!! Even better than the first view point. We walked up the stairs and took some photos. This is nearly the 100 mile point. Bag Man, Moose Jaw, Zoey and I all ate lunch here and hung out. The top of the fire tower was closed and as Bag Man, Nicholas and I were sitting at the bottom of the tower,‚Ä¶ Zoey climbed over the side of the railing and stairs to the top! Way too dangerous for any of us below!! Bag Man told her to be careful because we were in the splash zone if she fell. I laughed so hard that! It was disgusting but true. HA! At this point we called a shuttle for tomorrow and it‚Äôs a good thing we did. The free one into Franklin isn‚Äôt running since tomorrow is Good Friday, but Bobby the Greek said he would pick us up and give us a deal. ‚ò∫Ô∏è We learned a lot about Bag Man the Beaver Slayer today. He was a scuba instructor before he moved home to help take care of his dad. He showed us these awesome videos he took of sharks and other sea life while he was diving. He says he‚Äôs looking forward to picking up a trade once he‚Äôs off trail and start making money. He‚Äôs a little hard on himself, but he‚Äôs done some pretty incredible things! Zoey is quiet but she‚Äôs definitely a daredevil. We found out she‚Äôs a climber which explains a lot! She‚Äôs only 20 and very brave for hiking this trail by herself! Moose Jaw and I are very impressed. On trail today we also met Holy Shit and Smoke. Holy Shit hikes super fast. He started a week after us and is already passing us. He said, ‚ÄúI wonder when I will get my trail legs.‚Äù All I could think is, ‚Äúdude, you already have them.‚Äù He easily walked 20 miles today. Smoke is a super hiker as well, but he‚Äôs awfully kind. He talked to Nicholas for awhile at Carter Shelter during our break. He‚Äôs from Yuma. A fellow Arizonan (Arizonian?). Zoey is from Indiana. It seems a ton of people are from Indiana!! We are resupplying tomorrow in the town of Franklin. Moose Jaw is looking forward to Wendy‚Äôs. I wish the town had a chick-fil-a. I love my nugs!!! Today was a great day. We all laughed a lot. Lindsay and Whitney hung out with all of us at the shelter tonight. We all laughed a lot about smelling bad and food concoctions. Zoey didn‚Äôt have a spoon so she ate ramen noodles with her knife. She says she has two knives, one for cutting and one for using as a spoon. She knows it doesn‚Äôt make sense.

We had to hike 3.7 miles before 10 a.m. to catch a shuttle by Bobby the Greek. The rain let up just enough for us to pack up camp. However the Heavens let loose and it poured the entire walk to the shuttle. My pants were soaked. I imagine it felt like wearing a wet diaper. We must have had turbo jets on our feet because we (Bag Man, Zoey, Moose Jaw, and I) walked the 3.7 miles in one hour and fifteen minutes! We arrived to the gap early but so did our shuttle ride!

In the car Bobby put on the song ‚ÄúI‚Äôm on top of the world‚Äù by Imagine Dragons for all of us to karaoke. Only moose Jaw and I partook but it was fun!! We all laughed a lot.

We got a free ride back to trail from Solace. He is a sports announcer and has hiked the trail three times!!! He‚Äôs awfully kind and hilarious!! He has a ton of trail stories and told us the five most shocking things he has seen in people‚Äôs packs. These are three:
1. Portable TV2. 14 lb Bowling Ball3. Tackle Box full of Makeup4. Chainsaw Full with Gas
He‚Äôs currently working on a book full of trail stories! After he dropped us off trail, we started hiking towards our campsite.

And after all of that misery‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs when the hot cocoa incident occurred. Comfort was so kind to make us a cup of cocoa while we were trying to get out of our soaked clothes. As I (Chili Pepper) was sitting in the tent shivering with the cocoa beside me, Nicholas tried to open the door and knocked it over. Since our tent was at an incline, the cocoa along with water from the rain and a bunch of dirt pooled in the corner of the tent. We called it the cocoa corner. Our mats kept sliding to the corner, and it stresses us out! We were like, ‚ÄúNot the cocoa corner!‚Äù HA!

I‚Äôm glad I brought extra shorts and a shirt, even though an extra set of hiking clothes are deemed as ‚Äúluxury‚Äù items. I wrung so much water out of my hiking pants, and I was not about to put them on. Instead, I attached them to the outside of my pack to hopefully dry while hiking. I told Moose Jaw that my mom would be shocked to see me wear shorts in 40 degree weather. HA! Very unlike me. My shoes were a lost cause. I put dry socks on, stepped into my shoes and immediately my feet were soaked again. I figured they would dry while walking, which they did.

But just as they were really bothering me, we happened upon trail magic along with Bag Man and Cosmic Squirrel! Apparently we had just missed trail magic at the previous gap but they gave extra ham sandwiches and oatmeal cream pies to Bag Man and Cosmic Squirrel to give us!! It was wonderful. ‚ò∫Ô∏è Buddy and Donna was at the gap handing out sodas, and candy, and chips, and fruit! It was perfect!! The scenery was great along with conversation with them! They were so kind as to give all of us these treats and offer us advice for what‚Äôs to come on trail. They also offered to pick us up as far north as Hot Springs!! It felt as if God had his eye on us extra today. Such a great way to spend Easter Sunday. During our break, we set out our tent to dry. Thankfully it did!!! What a relief!! We hiked another mile and a half to watch the sunset at Wesser Bald on the abandoned fire tower. The scenery was breathtaking. A complete 360 view of the North Carolina mountains had me in Awe.

Going downhill hurt our knees a bit and some parts were scary! There were large rocks we had to scoot down on our butts in some ridge areas. At NOC we ate some food at a restaurant right by the water. While we ate we watched some rafters and kayakers float down the river.

Chili Pepper & Moose Jaw,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662558,"Today was a marvelous day!!! Nicholas and I did get on each other‚Äôs nerves while tearing down camp; however, that quickly subsided. We made our way into Fontana Dam today. We stopped at Fontana Marina and binge ate food. I ate and drank things that I never eat, such as soda (cherry coke) and a honey bun,‚Ä¶ which I have never purchased. But man, the food was delicious!! Nicholas and I always eat before we resupply so we don‚Äôt over buy on food. That happened to us once, and we quickly learned from that mistake. So our ground rules for town and resupply are as follows:
1. Do not deny ourselves of any food or drink. (We have to have something to look forward to!)¬†2. Always eat before buying food for trail.¬†3. Follow the grocery list we type out before. Do not deviate unless it‚Äôs something we will eat right away.¬†4. Relax and enjoy!!!
The marina was peaceful and perfect! I wish we could have gone out on the water. We called the Fontana Village Shuttle to pick us up to take us to the lodge. At the lodge we received our package from our shakedown on Day 1. We grabbed food from it, but didn‚Äôt really need anything else inside. We were worried about what to do with the box since the post office is closed today and tomorrow, until our shuttle driver told us that he would mail it for us home if we have him cash for it. The average person may think this is sketchy, but it isn‚Äôt. This is pretty common for those helping hikers out. We were stoked about his help!!¬†
Navigating the shuttle through Fontana Village was crazy!!! Mostly because there were so many VWs due to a car show this weekend. Schwaa (the shuttle driver) dropped us off at some picnic tables near an old-school gas station, so we could sort our items. An hour later he picked us back up and took us to the marina, right by trail. Nicholas and I got our last remaining resupply items at the marina and ate more food, that way we wouldn‚Äôt have to cook at the shelter this evening. As we got off the shuttle (before our resupply at the marina) we met Ox (thru-hiked in 1997). He surprised us with Girl Scout cookies for free!!!! Thin mints!! Woohoo!! It was awesome!!!!! As we chatted with him, another hiker came by. Her name is Altitude. She was extremely kind. We swapped hiker stories and meal ideas to change things up. It gets tiring eating the same thing day after day.¬†
When we were at the marina, we ate tamales and hung out until the placed closed. The staff was so kind and it was so peaceful there. Then we hiked the additional 1.2 miles to camp. We have an amazing view of the lake and the smoky mountains. It‚Äôs absolutely stunning here.

I stood staring at the scenery hoping I could soak it all in!!It did rain last night. But the clouds over Fontana Lake were glorious!! After we officially enters Smoky Mountain National Park, we hiked up to Shuckstack Fire Tower. Although nerve racking, the views here were incredible.

My (chili pepper‚Äôs) body is incredibly tired, and my feet are incredibly sore. I do love watching my husband randomly start dancing with his trekking poles. I rate his dancing 11 out 10.
We met a fun group of hikers at Mollies Ridge Shelter: Truffle, Cow, Chow Town, Charmer, Timber, and Sticks. They were also at the firetower with us. They crack me up!! Truffle is especially funny.

Oh, and the miles we have to hike into town on a resupply day always feel like they take forever! Today we had a slower pace for the last six miles due to the steep inclines and declines. I took a spill on the decline and ripped my pants a little on the knee. I stepped on a rock that decided it wanted to move out from beneath my foot. Rude!!¬†

Chili Pepper & Moose Jaw,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663109,"We got up after a night of sleet, hail, and rain, but Chili had her earplugs in so she slept soundly while her poor husband rolled around on the incline. We packed up camp while it was windy and very cold.¬†
Trail magic on the incline: brownies, clementines, apples etc. nutty-bars. We walked with Trip-wire, LILO (last-in, last-out), Comfort and Legoman to the top of big bald. There was snow on the ground. 
LET THE RECORD SHOW THAT CHILI PEPPER HIKED WITH SNOW ON THE GROUND.¬†
It was very cold. It was very windy. But the views were 10 out of 10.
After that we had lunch at the next shelter about 4 miles in. It was still cold. Highs were in the mid 40s.¬†After eating some couscous, Parmesan, and ramen, we walked 15 miles to the next shelter.
Before we arrived to the shelter, we saw Miss Janet at Spivey gap and she gave us an oatmeal cream pie and Gatorade. It gave us the energy we needed to keep going. We then hiked past some waterfalls, and we filtered some water at the top.¬†
Alas at 6:30pm, we arrived at the shelter, however, to hit the 0900 shuttle, we decided to stealth camp. As we neared the stealth camp. We decided, heck, we‚Äôll just get to town! So we hiked in the rest arriving in town at 8:45 pm. So that means we walked the remaining 6.2 miles in 2hrs 15 minutes.¬†
As we arrived at uncle Johnny‚Äôs it was late and we spent 45 minutes trying to get an Uber/lift/shuttle. But nothing worked. Chili pepper then flagged down people driving by until a guy in a pickup truck we couldn‚Äôt understand offered to take us to the super 8 motel. He said yes, so we hopped in the bed of his truck. The highway wind was so cold on our sweaty bodies, but we made it safely to the super 8 and showered. It was wonderful!¬†

Chili Pepper & Moose Jaw,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663110,"Today was fun!
This morning, we got a free ride from Miss Janet with Trip Wire and LILO to a wonderful breakfast diner, Clarence‚Äôs Drive-In. As we were waiting for a table, we talked to a couple about our journey so far on the trail, and what we‚Äôve seen and enjoyed. Comfort joined us right before we were seated. We had quite the meal! Biscuits and gravy, home fries, pancakes, French toast, bacon, eggs, and orange juice! We had a wonderful breakfast hanging out together and swapping trail stories. Just as we were about to get our checks, the waitress let us know that the couple we talked with before we were seated paid for all of our meals!! Talk about generosity! It warmed my (chili pepper‚Äôs) heart, and I felt like I did not deserve that. God has been pouring many blessings on Nicholas and I this entire trip.¬†
After breakfast, Miss Janet dropped us off at the outfitter. While everyone was looking around, I went a few doors down for a hot chai latte. It was nice to sit there and just enjoy my drink in the sunshine. It felt so serene. I could have sat there for hours. Not long later, Comfort, Moose Jaw (Nicholas), LILO, and Trip Wire joined me and we all drank our drinks and talked about gear. That‚Äôs something we talk about often‚Ä¶. Gear. ‚ÄúWhat brand? How much does it weigh? How much did it cost? Where did you get it? Do you like it? I have such and such and this is what I think.‚Äù The list goes on‚Ä¶. We even joked that every time hikers get together they talk about gear. I always find people saying how they got their gear on sale. I love bargain shopping as well!!
Next up, resupply. We went to Food City. It‚Äôs nice to actually buy food from a grocery store and not a gas station or outfitter. You get burnt out real quick eating the same food all of the time. I may have over-purchased some food items, but I‚Äôm not mad about it. I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm feeding Moose Jaw enough.¬†
From the grocery, we took an Uber to Uncle Johnny‚Äôs Hostel to pack our things and shower and start laundry. I could not wait to get clean clothes!! Mud has been caked to my hiking pants for the past 4 days. It‚Äôs not fun to put wet, dirty, cold pants on every morning.¬†
Resupply days and zero days are always busy, because we always have a ton of chores to do: plan next resupply, grocery list, groceries, shower, laundry, post journal entries and photos, repack gear, etc‚Ä¶. All the while trying to get to and from trail. It‚Äôs odd how tedious things are on trail. For a real rest day, one should plan back to back zeroes. One day for chores. One day to relax!!¬†
Comfort, Moose Jaw, and I got Domino‚Äôs Pizza for dinner and it was magical!! The gentleman was so happy to receive a tip that he gave us a free 2 liter soda, tons of sauces, and extra wings. We devoured!!! Lego Man joined us later after he got back from being in town. He polished off most of the food for us! It was a wonderful relaxing dinner. Lego Man and Comfort are laid back and good company, like most of the hikers here!
We received messages from Captain and the Australian family. We were so happy to hear from them!! Unfortunately, Tara got the Noro virus. We heard it was going around. We are being extra careful about hygiene. I pray that we do not get Noro.
Squirrel is hiking in late today. She had apparently taken some rest days, and ended up behind us. We are letting her sleep on our sofa tonight and we laid food out for her. Hope she gets in safely!!

We let her stay with us since she had nowhere else to go. We packed up our things and caught the 0900 shuttle to town. We got some tea and coffee while eating some fresh fruit we purchased from the store. We also got a delicious breakfast sandwich at Steel Rails Coffee Shop. Lots of other hikers were there too! Low-key, Billy Goat, Sunray, Fizz, Squirrel, and Lego-man. We then walked to Food City to get back to the hostel / trail. But when we arrived we got an offer from some other hiker to hitch a ride back in their RV instead. It was wild! 13 hikers with packs fit into this vehicle!
We planned some slack-packing and then left the hostel at 1300. Comfort hiked with us. We hiked in and met Lantana (cool fat guy who lost a lot of weight on trail, from Florida). He told us a story how he pooped his pants, because he trusted a fart. I felt so bad for him. This is why we never trust farts while on trail!! We then made a campfire with s‚Äômores once we made it to camp. When attempting a bear hang, the branch of the tree broke and fell on the road because our food bags were so heavy.","Erwin, TN

Funny story of the day:
We made it to camp and there was a hiker in a tent. Nicholas asked, ‚ÄúHey, who‚Äôs in the tent.‚Äù
The gentleman replied back, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Richard,‚Ä¶ (long pause) I fart a lot.‚Äù

Today was a great day! Moose Jaw woke Chili P up in the morning and got out of camp by 9:15 am. The views were beautiful today. We hiked over 2 balds, where you could see mountains upon mountains. Windy, but gorgeous!! As we got off trail, hiking towards Mountain Harbour Hostel, a gentleman who had finished morning trail magic offered us a ride to pick up some paninis two miles down the road before he would drop us off at the hostel. We purchased turkey and cheese paninis with pesto and they were scrumptious!! We also got some blueberry cobbler ice cream!!¬†
After getting a hitch back to the hostel we hung out with Trip Wire and Lilo. They are a lot of fun!! As time went by, more hikers trickled in and there was a group of us eating dinner: Trip Wire, Charmer, Lilo, White Rabbit, the Professor, Comfort, and then Moose Jaw and Chili Pepper. We had a great time chatting!! Not long later, Phoenix showed up. We love her. And she especially loves Moose Jaw. He reminds her of her eldest son (same age). She said Moose Jaw is just so full of life and Charismatic. Many people agreed that he just makes everyone happy.¬†
As Moose Jaw and I (Chili Pepper) were getting dinner, we joked with Trail Magic, that if you ordered Jason Mamoa on wish, Moose Jaw would show up. She said she wouldn‚Äôt be mad about that! ‚ÄúMoose Jaw has nice soft features.‚Äù HA!!

White RabbitProfessorComfortLILOTrip WireMoose JawChili Pepper
We started at 9:45 am and we trickled in back to the hostel between 6 and 8 in the evening. Before we left, the Bed & Breakfast made a HUGE breakfast (enough to serve 35 people) for everyone. There was sausage, quiche, French toast, cinnamon rolls, hard boiled eggs, biscuits and gravy, etc. The breakfast was the best!!!
Walking felt good until we had 4.7 miles left. That‚Äôs when we all started to feel the exhaustion. It was at this point we took a side trail to see a gorgeous waterfall! It was majestic. I‚Äôm so happy we (LILO, Trip Wire, Moose Jaw, Chili Pepper) took this side trail. That‚Äôs something hikers need to remember, this isn‚Äôt a death March. Stop and smell the flowers. Take the side trails (blue blazing) to see the views. This is six months of your life. Enjoy the journey otherwise you will spend six months looking at your feet not enjoying each day.¬†
Halfway through trail, the weather decided to dump a ton of rain on us and we were soaked. Due to the inclement weather, we didn‚Äôt stop for lunch. We just ate some snacks and stopped to filter water multiple times. Every time we see water, the first thing we comment is whether or not the water source has nice enough flow good for filtering water.¬†
LILO and Chili Pepper were walking and they saw a cute snake. We got close to it (6‚Äù away) and started taking pictures. We told the boys to come take a look,‚Ä¶ apparently it wasn‚Äôt a gardener snake‚Ä¶ it was a baby rattler. The most dangerous of them all, because they can‚Äôt control their venom. I‚Äôm relieved that this snake was so chill and didn‚Äôt bother us!! That would have been terrible, but hey, we have a cool picture now! We also saw a large snake that was all black (apparently a rat snake).
When Lilo and Chili Pepper arrived back to the hostel, they ordered chicken tenders for Moose Jaw and Trip Wire (they arrived 20 minutes later) along with some ciders. The food was delicious. Of course we ate our chicken tenders with ranch. Ranch is the way to go!
Comfort was the last to stroll in, and Rabbit was the first done. We all ate a big dinner.¬†
Then, Moose Jaw and I went into the house to shower and crawl into a warm bed. We were limping. Every day we wake up limping. I asked some previous thru-hikers if it gets better, and it doesn‚Äôt. I even heard you‚Äôll still be hurting up to a month after you‚Äôre done. I hope the pain subsides.¬†

After breakfast, we finished up our laundry and got a shuttle ride back to trail. We were dropped off around 12:50 in the afternoon. We took an easy stroll today. 2 miles!! We walked and spent almost an hour at the waterfall today. It was gorgeous. We wished it was nice enough out to go swimming in the water. It sprinkled for 2 minutes, and that was all. I hate rain on trail. Especially when I‚Äôm tearing down and setting up our tent. I need a dry space. So does Moose Jaw. The Professor joined us after the waterfall at a wonderful campsite right next to the flowing river. As they started a fire, I took a nap. I haven‚Äôt been sleeping well the past two nights, and it finally took its toll today. After I woke up we ate dinner and hung out around the fire.

It included a picnic table and a fire pit. We stayed here so we could go aqua blazing in the morning. Lucky Moon checked us in and she was extremely kind.
The best shower I have had while on trail was here. The water was steaming hot, and the shower head was a giant metal bowl with holes. This outdoor shower was amazing!!!¬†
We met Voodoo along with a bunch of other hikers. Voodoo is a thru-hiked but took time off to help out at the hostel. He was cracking us all up!!

Finally we got to camp, and we had a little snafu with another hiker who couldn‚Äôt properly hang a bear bag and decided it was best to improperly hang a bear bag, in an area with aggressive bears (there were signs posted), in the middle of a Tentsite. Emotions were high for a little while.¬†
At camp it was Lilo, Trip Wire, Moose Jaw, myself, the Professor, Toaster, and another hiker named Ron (the bear bag culprit).

It was a miracle that the Professor, LILO, Trip Wire, Moose Jaw, and I were out of camp by 10:00 in the morning! We were so proud of ourselves! And then, we made it to Damascus, VA in only an hour and 45 minutes! We were cookin‚Äô. I felt so much better today compared to yesterday. My pack was much lighter since we ate some food, and I was feeling good (despite my Achilles tendinitis,‚Ä¶ that has been rough the past three weeks). Once we made it into town we stopped at the Library/Visitor‚Äôs Center. There we caught up with Big Tex and Gray Mare, and we got directions from the Librarians along with the best places to get food.¬†
So of course, we go to get food first. We stopped at the Main Street Cafe and got sugary coffee drinks, a giant chocolate chip cookie, and an amazing delicious sandwich. We saw Fizz and TT at the cafe and met a section hiker named Shaman. He was hiking a large section with his dog, ADT. TT had to work some, and he wishes he could take a break and dial it back from his job. I can‚Äôt blame him. Him and his wife are hiking the trail together. They always make us laugh because they bicker just like us! In fun and full of love! Toaster walked into the cafe and hung out with us for awhile. From there we went to the outfitter. Because of course we always have to go to the outfitter to see what they have! I got myself a pair of new shoes, since my others were on their last leg. We also got some soap and other basic necessities.¬†
From the outfitter, we (LILO, Trip Wire, Moose Jaw, and I) walked to our bed & breakfast, Lady Di‚Äôs. We are all sharing a room, and it feels like a sleepover!¬†
After dropping our items off, Grams, Big Tex, and Gray Mare join us for dinner at the Twisted Chicken. Of course we got chicken wings with ranch. Ranch is superior to blue cheese!! Big Tex and Gray Mare are wonderfully kind and soft spoken couple. It‚Äôs encouraging to see couples who have been married for 20+ years hiking the trail together. They shared why they were hiking the trail with us over dinner. People have many reasons for hiking, and it‚Äôs a wonderful to hear everyone‚Äôs stories as to why they are taking this journey. As we were nearing the end of our meal, the Professor joined us at dinner and got some wings for himself. After dinner we walked back to the bed & breakfast and hung outside.

We decided on pork chops, salad, vegetables (onions, squash, and asparagus), fresh fruit for dinner. After getting everything we needed, we headed back to the B&B to drop off our food items and then grab some lunch. We went to the cafe again for another Grind sandwich. It was delicious!!!

It was their anniversary today. 16 years! They say it feels like 16 minutes,‚Ä¶ under water. Hahahaha They are hilarious! We love them!! Big Tex roasts everyone, and it‚Äôs always hilarious!!!
Fudge Stripe, who had provided trail magic at the end of the Smokies, picked Lego Man, Moose Jaw, and I up around 3:00 in the afternoon.¬†
Thankfully they took me by CVS to get my prescription, since I only had a couple of days left.¬†
Once we got to Damascus, we were dropped off at tent city. Tent City is an area in town where all of the hikers (and veteran hikers) camp for the weekend. It is packed with thousands of tents around a baseball field that runs into the woods. The area in the woods is known as Riff Raff. I call the area outside of the woods (where we are tenting) the Retirement Community. Most people, not all, go to bed ‚Äúearly‚Äù here and wake up early. The people of the woods sleep in until noon.¬†
After we set up our tents, we walked around and got food. We met so many people that we had hiked with before!! It was sooo great seeing them all!
Some hikers include: Shelly & Dan (now known as Fire and Mayhem), Robin & Hiking Viking (Christopher), Rabbit, Fizz, Goat, Fog Hat, the Professor, CT, Truffle, Cow, Sticks, Lantana, etc.¬†
After filling our bellies, Lilo, Trip Wire, Moose Jaw, and I went to the Riff Raff zone. It was crazy!!! We saw Truffle‚Äôs crew there and Goat and Lantana, so we hung out with him while ignoring all of the other shenanigans.¬†
All in all, today was a good day! Tiring, but good!! Can‚Äôt wait until tomorrow to see the gear vendors and to take a free shower!¬†‚ÄúNot all elevators go to the pent house.‚Äù - Slug","Trimpi Shelter

In the morning we got free showers and laundry from the church from Newfound Gap in TN. Across the street we had all you can eat pancakes from the One Way church for five dollars. They were delicious pancakes!! Then we walked around a bunch of vendors and entered many raffles. However, we didn‚Äôt actually win anything! :( BOO! We did however get some shirts to hike in that have really neat patterns!! We both got a shirt from Jolly, and Moose got a twin shirt from Town Shirts. It has an AT pattern with Katadan, McAffee Knob, Amicalola Falls Arch, trillium flowers, etc. The company Town Shirts got started from a thru-hiker that met a group of retirees that were section hiking. At dinner they said it was time to smoke their cigars, so they all put on their button downs, sat around a campfire and smoked their cigars. So, the owner was like, we need town shirts that are button downs! Jolly started his company, because while he hiked the PCT he hated choosing between a hiking shirt and a sun hoodie. So he made a 2-in-1! They have crazy patterns, which he loves. And so do all of the hikers!! It gets boring wearing solid, plain colors all of the time!
We ran into many hikers today! We saw the Australian Family! It was wonderful seeing them! We caught up on their journey and their experience at trail days. We also saw Comfort! He was having a blast at the Broken Fiddle Hostel!
For lunch I had jalape√±o cheddar hush puppies and chicken nuggets. We met a thru-hiked from 2013 named dirty mike. He was there with his wife and baby. He was soft spoken and super kind! I wish we could have talked to him awhile longer. Fudge stripe ran into us while we were eating lunch. We chatted for awhile. His wife had their dog in a backpack, and many people wanted a photo of their pup. Apparently this happens often!¬†
Moose Jaw and I took a nap today while it was raining. We were beat. We did end up going back to the coffee shop for milkshakes. Again, they were delicious!!

Once we got to Marion we resupplied at the Ingles and got a ride back to trail from shuttle driver, Becky. Once we were dropped off we ate some food and packed all of our food away. Then we hit the trail around 2:15.¬†
We walked slowly today because there were so many rocks!!!! We made it to the Settler‚Äôs Museum and camped there. This spot was amazing!! They have restrooms and a gazebo. We also were able to charge our things! As we were sitting there we could hear wild turkeys. They were cracking me up!!!

We didn‚Äôt leave until 11, which wasn‚Äôt a big deal for us. About 3 miles into our walk, we passed a gas station and went under an interstate bridge. We took an hour break at the gas station. Some super kind gentleman bought us some slim Jim‚Äôs because his buddy hiked the trail last year. As we were about to head out, Stogie and Dan rolled up. We chatted for a bit and as Stogie sat down on the concrete bench, the bench collapsed!! It was funny! We helped him fix it before we were on our way.¬†
I saw a ton of white tailed deer today! And we also saw some cattle, because we walked through a pasture. Many times we had to climb these wooden triangular ladders over metal fences along the trail. There was a lot of private property we had to walk through today.¬†
Camp was near a pavilion and privy. I‚Äôm not sure what upset my stomach (I think it was the water I drank from my broken filter), but I was about to poop my pants. I ran to this shed look privy to go to the bathroom. It was horrible looking,‚Ä¶ it was basically plywood with a hole and beneath the hole was a vertical PVC pipe. It was horrifying. But when you have to go, you have to go. When I went back later for a second time, a mouse popped it‚Äôs head out by my foot. I wanted to run away, but I couldn‚Äôt. It was a horrifying experience.
Then for dinner I tried to make something new, spinach tortellini with pesto. It was so awful, I was gagging as I was trying to swallow. Moose Jaw couldn‚Äôt even look at me, because it made him want to throw up. We were exhausted, and eating a crappy dinner late at night didn‚Äôt help anything. HA!¬†
All in all, not a shabby day until the end with the crappy dinner and crappy privy. At least we didn‚Äôt have any bear encounters and I did not poop my pants!!
Apparently, pooping your pants is something most hikers talk about and we have met many hikers who have. I pray that does not ever happen to Moose and I. If it does, it would be traumatizing!!","Settler‚Äôs Museum

Chili Pepper & Moose Jaw,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664480,"Today was exhausting. So many inclines today! It kicked our butts!¬†
We woke up and got started around 9 in the morning. About 5.3 miles in we had to cross a creek by walking through it because the bride was washed out. That was fun! And the water was ridiculously cold!! When we got to the other side, Fizz was there with a tiny guitar! He strummed for a little while. He‚Äôs very talented! While he played for a bit, we ate some lunch. Towards the end of our lunch we met Mug Bag and Huck Finn. Huck Finn carried a travel chess set with him!
Onwards we went‚Ä¶ went up a horrible incline that is! We ascended over 4800 ft today in total! On our way up this horrible incline, I found a cute little gnome home and snapped some pictures. As we climbed up this massive mountain, we ate some candy to give us energy.¬†
Then we got to some open plains and the shelter. The view was gorgeous. There we met Pay it Forward. He is a Triple Crowner (he hiked the Appalachian Trail, Pacific Crest Trail, and the Continental Divide Trail). He was so kind. And he was wearing a sport kilt which was pretty awesome! Moose Jaw, Pay it Forward, Fizz, and I talked about life. The privy at this shelter did not have a door and had a bucket with a dead mouse next to it. It was odd. HA! Also at this shelter we met s‚Äômores, trip, and a photographer named Brian. Brian said we were the first couple he has met on trail, and he took our photo. He also took a photo of my shoe gaiters. They are yellow with pineapples on them. I told him I love the pattern, but Nicholas and I are NOT swingers because apparently that‚Äôs a thing. He laughed so hard, and said he ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt going to ask‚Äù, but was glad I clarified. Apparently he just heard about that symbolism not long ago. Those three were super kind!! Trip and s‚Äômores hiked last year! This year they are doing a small section after trail days for fun!
From here we kept on trekking. Until finally we found a stealth site, and we thought ‚Äúgood enough!‚Äù We set up camp and found out we had service! Which was a good thing. My water filter broke and Nicholas‚Äôs filter isn‚Äôt working properly. We ordered some on Amazon to be shipped to a hostel we will stay at three days from now. We should be able to use Nicholas‚Äôs filter until then,‚Ä¶ fingers crossed.¬†
All in all, it‚Äôs been a good day! Besides yesterday, it has been awhile since we‚Äôve put in these kind of miles with our packs on so we are getting used to it again. We have to pick up our mileage so we can finish end of September, but we still plan on enjoying ourselves along the way!

Then as we were about to walk, Sherlock came upon us as well! We were so excited to see them both! So, all four of us started to walk together.¬†
For lunch we stopped at the shelter and ate some tuna and had some hot chocolate. We were running low on food since the next day is resupply day. This is a good thing, because we don‚Äôt want to carry more food than you have to.¬†
After lunch we walked some more. Until we hit a water source to filter for our packs. Around this area Sherlock camped. The three of us continued on for another 4 miles. We found an incredible little site with an amazing view. We watched the sunset while making dinner. One more hiked arrived, Gucci, and he set up his hammock near us.

Today felt tough! The first 3 miles were a breeze, but after our resupply the rest of the miles felt challenging. When we finished the first three miles there was a little store right off trail that we got breakfast sandwiches from song with something to drink. Then we had a shuttle driver take us (Chili Pepper, Moose Jaw, and CT) into the tiny town of Bland so that we could get food from the grocery store. That resupply only took 15 minutes, so our shuttle driver, Chuck, took us to a diner in Bastian.
From the diner we went back to trail and packed up our food. As we were packing up our food we saw Sherlock and Birdsong. We chatted with them for awhile before we got back on trail. Sherlock walked with us today. He‚Äôs quite the conversationalist and fun to talk to! Birdsong walked with Moose Jaw for a little while as well!
As we were about to leave to start hiking after resupply, we received some trail magic! Since we were full we mostly asked for waters and wet wipes that keep our big bites from itching.¬†
The walk was tough!! My ankle was killing me, so I was so happy that we finally made it to camp. We set up our tent because we knew it was going to rain in less than an hour after we arrived. At the shelter was Huck Finn, Mud Bag, Birdsong, Sherlock, Mortgage, Gucci, CT, Moose Jaw and I. We all ate dinner together and laughed a lot. The young bloods (24 years old and younger) taught us the new lingo like Timmy, no cap, bet, HIM, that guy, etc. We were cracking up hearing their definitions of each word! We also laughed a lot at the various names people will call us outside of our actual trail names.

Chili Pepper & Moose Jaw,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665111,"Today we slept in. Which was nice, because we were kept up by someone snoring in a tent near us. It was so loud we could hear it over the rain and our earplugs. Poor guy even woke himself up from his own snoring. When we finally woke up, we just hung out in our tent until we decided to pack up our things. It rained pretty hard last night, so when we finally got our things out of our tent we flipped our tent over to dry. Since our tent was on an incline, water got between the tub of our tent and the ground tarp beneath it. Also, somehow water got into our tent and the bottom of our mats were soaked. We wiped them down with a pack-towel. The rest of our tent dried in the sun.
As we were waiting for the tent to dry we met a hiker named Merlin and his dog, Wade Wilson (from dead pool). Merlin named his dog Wade Wilson, because the first toy his pup picked out was a white unicorn (movie and comic reference). Merlin was super kind, and he pup loved me. And he loved playing in the water too!
Finally around noon we started hiking towards the hostel (Weary Feet) we knew we would be staying at. We hiked the 6.2 miles in 2 hours! When we arrived we received a tour. Then we showered and did our laundry. There were a ton of hikers there that we knew and that we hung out with including: CT, Birdsong, Sherlock, Gucci, V6, Slug, Optimus, etc. We all had a great time spending time with each other. CT‚Äôs parents actually came to visit, so we met them during dinner. The hostel cooked everyone spaghetti for dinner and it was delicious! They even gave us all a large slice of cake!!

Weary Feet was just cozy. We were the last hikers out. We finally got on trail near 10 in the morning. It was supposed to rain today, but by a miracle we walked 20.4 miles without it raining at all!!! I am so thankful for that!!
We originally planned to hike 17.8 miles to the shelter, but the shelter had absolutely no tenting except for a tiny spot. We wouldn‚Äôt be able to fit our large 3-person tent, so we decided to hike on until we found a better spot, about 2.2 miles past.¬†
It was mostly Nicholas and I walking together today. Eventually, we met up with CT and Birdsong. We really enjoy talking to them! We wondered what happened to Sherlock since he left before we woke up today, but we saw him camped out about 1.5 miles before we happened upon our campsite. We were happy he was doing well! He looked cozy in his tent.¬†
At dinner, Moose Jaw and I talked to CT‚Äôs girlfriend and ate our food. Then we planned our next resupply stint. Unfortunately we will have to carry 5.5 days of food. But it‚Äôll be okay.

We expected to walk a total of 13 miles today; however, the constant rain required us to change our plans. We made it from out Tentsite into town by 11:15. As we arrived at Cross Ave we found Birdsong and Merlin! Birdsong came back to trail to meet up with Moose Jaw, CT, and I! Which was awesome! Merlin offered for us to put our packs in his van so we could walk the mile to the Chinese restaurant without our packs. There we all got an all you can eat Chinese buffet. It was delicious!!! Before we knew it a bunch of other hikers filled in along with Gucci! He joined us at the buffet! It was delicious!
From there Merlin gave us all (Birdsong, Gucci, CT, Moose Jaw, and I) a ride to resupply in Walmart. While we were there we saw Billy Goat with his wife and daughter! It was great seeing him and meeting his family! Resupply took a little longer than expected because we had to buy food for five days, but we also didn‚Äôt want to overbuy our food, because that is a lot to carry!!! We packed our bear canister in the entrance to the Walmart.¬†
As we got back in the van we all chatted about what to do next. We knew it was going to rain all day and through the night into tomorrow afternoon. That makes for a tough few days. We decided to stay in town for the night but the hostels and motels were full. Then we found a hostel ran by a local Catholic Church and drove to the church to see if they had any availability. Fortunately, there was a place for all of us to sleep and shower!! Twig showed us where to go (he runs the hostel), and he even said it was acceptable for Merlin to park his van outside!!¬†
About an hour after getting settled, Twig drove Nicholas to DQ and we got milkshakes and blizzards. I got a strawberry Oreo blizzard and it was delicious!! As we were eating, CT, Moose Jaw, Gucci and I played Yahtzee. Moose Jaw mopped the floor with all of us. It was fun playing! As we took turns showering, Merlin made us cookies and then went and got us Burger King. We felt terrible because they messed up Merlin‚Äôs order (he is Vegan), so he didn‚Äôt get any food but still brought us ours. I hope that he finds something delicious to eat!¬†
After showering, Twigs offered to slack pack us 21 miles tomorrow so we would have somewhere dry to sleep tomorrow tonight.

On our way back to trail, we of course stopped at Chick-fil-a. We were hungry and it‚Äôs our favorite fast food joint. Uncle Smokey dropped us off at the gas station right next to trail. We sat in our camp chairs while we finished our food. We are so thankful for everything that Uncle Smokey has done for us and for letting us stay with him. He spoiled us with food and a cozy bed. We had a wonderful time with him!!
As we were finishing up our food we saw Toaster! She just got off from 11 zeroes. She went back home for awhile. She looked great!! We were so happy to see a familiar face!! Since we got a late start, we only hiked four miles and then set up camp. For some reason, we were exhausted. It felt weird being back on trail. We do miss the comforts of civilization, but I know we have many more miles in us!!

It was parallel to trail, except along the road you could actually see the views. That was nice!!
We received some trail magic from Apple Man. While we were there drinking some gatorades, there was a horse named Copper. Beautiful thing! We took photos with the horse! And then on our way we went.¬†
At camp we met Father and Son who are thru-hiking together. They swapped some meal ideas that seemed tasty. As we were getting around for bed, a dad and his three sons stopped by our camp to say hi and chat for a little bit. They were just hiking for the evening and wanted to know more about thru-hiking. It was a great chat!! The family was from Ohio (I am assuming they are Amish), and they were on vacation in Virginia. They were really nice!! At camp we also met Masters.

Today was a good day, but it was tough! We climbed nearly 5200 ft in elevation today, and it was a long mileage day for us. But thankfully, we had many breaks throughout the day along with a long lunch to rest our feet! We forgot how much impact our feet take everyday. Especially on long mileage days.¬†
This morning about 3 miles into our hike I almost stepped on a rattlesnake that was chilling across the trail! I was shocked! It didn‚Äôt rattle at all, and at first I thought to myself, ‚Äúthis is a weird looking branch.‚Äù I‚Äôm so happy that I was watching my feet. That would have been bad!
We saw some views today but not many. There was still a haze over everything it seemed.¬†
At lunch we met Beargasm and Ozark. They were hiking together. We also saw Just Dan again. His wife is visiting him so she was slack-packing him so he could get some miles in. Apparently, he was sick as well for 24 hours. Something is going around.¬†

Chili Pepper & Moose Jaw,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665633,"Today had its ups and downs but it ended on a great note!! We woke up early today and started hiking around 7:15 in the morning. We made it about 15 miles into town by 2:45 in the afternoon. Which was great for us since we took over 2 hours worth of breaks. The rocks at the end of our hike were absolutely killing our feet. But once we got our packs off of our shoulder and crocs on our feet we felt much better!
When we got picked up to go to the hostel we found out that our reservation got mixed up and we no longer had a room like we thought. Thankfully, the gentleman struck us a deal and let us tent in the backyard at a reduced rate. This fee included laundry and shower. I was happy with that deal. Once we got to the hostel, we set up our tent and then went to the only restaurant in town. The local pizza place, Scotto‚Äôs. Our server Elijah was the absolute best!! He made my (Chili Pepper‚Äôs) day!! He genuinely wanted to hear about our hike, and we talked about anime shows with him. He would be a great voice over for anime fight scenes! He had me cracking up the entire time! He also gave me ice cream with a candle to celebrate my birthday a day early! All of the hikers in the back room we were sitting in sang to me. Hikers included: Masters, Simple, Radar, Bandit, Toster, Beargasm, Ozark, Stogie, Just Dan (now Bob Ross), and a few others. After I blew out the candle, Elijah grabbed it and was like ‚Äúbaby girl, I‚Äôm gonna need that back.‚Äù I was cracking up! I also told Moose he had to start calling me baby girl exactly how Elijah called me it. I sure dang felt special!! As we were checking out, Elijah said he missed us already. Nicholas and I said we already missed him too and we gave him a big hug! Everyone needs an Elijah in their life!!!
After dinner we resupplied at the local mini grocery and dollar general. We got what we needed to be on trail for 4.5 days. Then we hitched a ride back to hostel.¬†
We did our chores (showers and laundry) and I painted my fingernails. I found some fingernail polish in the hiker box (a hiker box is simply a tub with food or other hiker items that hikers and the general public donate that they do not need).

Yay! Today is my birthday and we hit 800 miles!!!! Woohoo!! Today was AWESOME! I slept in until 8:30 and then went to the kitchen and got some apple and blueberry pancakes. I smothered those bad boys in syrup and gobbled them down while sitting outside. I slept wonderfully! It could have been the eye mask and ear plugs though.¬†
A bunch of us hung out all morning to let the rain subside before we hit the trail. Plus we all had to take turns taking the shuttle back to trail. Toaster, Masters, Moose Jaw and I shared a ride back to trail and started hiking around noon.¬†
We quickly fell into our own paced and Moose Jaw and I hiked on our own. We had a ton of incline to do, so we wanted to take our time. At one point this GIANT moth (which I thought was a butterfly at first) kept landing on me. It was beautiful! It was black and white with a neat red pattern. Obviously, I felt like a princess.¬†
You know, we (along with many other hikers) were told Virginia was flat. That was a flat out lie. So many ups and downs‚Ä¶ large elevation gains and ridge running on rocks.

Eventually we caught back up with Maters, Toaster, and Bandit. We all wanted to hit 800 miles today. As we were walking we passed a low hanging bird‚Äôs nest and Toaster got an amazing video of the baby birds in the nest! It was awesome! And then not much later we walked by a low hanging hornets nest. Good thing Radar gave us a heads up so we didn‚Äôt walk into it. Radar and Barbecue hike a lot together. They are super kind and sort of quiet, but most people are quiet compared to Moose Jaw and I. Since we wanted to hit 800 miles, we got into camp late (around 7:45). We were all kind of rushing to get our chores done and make dinner.¬†

Our feet felt better today, which was huge for us. We woke up and was out of camp by 9 in the morning. We then crossed this awesome pedestrian bridge and walked around Lynchburg‚Äôs Reservoir. On our way to our lunch break we talked to section-hiker, Stitch. He‚Äôs from Alabama and got his name from getting stitches in his side from walking. He‚Äôs super kind and shared lots of stories about his traveling around the world. We really like him! He‚Äôs a trooper too. He‚Äôs doing a great job hiking!
We continued on and climbed this steep incline in Virginia. It was tough. Before it got to a steep part we saw a rattlesnake (we think it was a rattlesnake) with Stitch, and then we got some trail magic! Someone left a box of dehydrated berries!! It was a great surprise!!
Eventually we ran back into Ranger Dan, Toaster, and Bandit as we were going to get some water to filter. We were so excited to see them! As we were getting water, Barbecue found an awesome campsite. If it was further, we would have camped with him!! As we were about to leave, we ran into Stitch again and chatted with him for about 20 minutes before we covered the last 4 miles to camp. Those miles went quick!! Then we found a crappy Tentsite with Toaster and Bandit. It was at an incline and there were ants everywhere. But we made do! We‚Äôve camped at worse places. ¬†We all ate dinner together and laughed a lot about trail and how it has turned us into mountain people.¬†

Bandit told us that taking side adventures was called purple blazing. He heard another hiker come up with the idea, and it stuck. On our app called FarOut, a lot of restaurants and towns are identified in purple bubbles. That‚Äôs where the color purple comes from. Side adventures are good for the spirit.¬†
We we got to the gap to hitch to the brewery, we got trail magic from a mom whose son hiked last year! She was so kind. She took many trips to take hikers to the brewery.

She likes to hike small sections. She was so kind to pick us up!!
As we were hiking on trail before we arrived to the gap, Toaster, Bandit, Moose Jaw, and I all talked about times we cried on trail and why. That was a wholesome conversation and we really learned a lot about each other. Not every time we cried was for bad reasons, either. We also shed tears of joy. We are all so grateful to be out here!¬†

Next to the Brewery, there was a campground owned by the brewery. There was an area called Tent City where we got to camp for free! It was awesome and flat! Then we got free showers in the Bathhouse. The lady working the entrance gave Moose Jaw body wash to use. It‚Äôs wild how low our standards are. I used body wash on my body and my hair and I was ecstatic! It‚Äôs crazy how the little things make us happy out here on trail!¬†
Today, Bandit said we are just living life at 2 miles per hour out here on trail. And I love that. We can‚Äôt get to anywhere fast, but we get there by our own steam and on our own time. I wish more people including us lived life at 2 mph (outside of trail).

However, we all know it‚Äôs really Moose Jaw‚Äôs good looks.¬†
We took a side trail today during lunch to Humpback Rocks. We had an amazing view during lunch. Not long into lunch we saw some bad weather headed our way. So, we got back to walking in the thunderstorm that arrived. It wasn‚Äôt bad walking in the rain. It was actually kind of nice!!
We talked a lot about things we want to do when we are done with trail today. As we (Bandit, Toaster, Moose Jaw, and I) arrived to camp we soaked our feet in the gorgeous and flowing creek.

At three in the morning, Moose woke up to some crinkling of a wrapper. He threw off his blankets and said he had to take a look at what‚Äôs going on. I was half awake but I heard Toaster (we were sharing a bed) say ‚ÄúI heard it too! Is that bandit?‚Äù Bandit was like, ‚ÄúWhy would I be making that noise!?‚Äù Toaster said, ‚ÄúI know you like your bars! I thought you were having a snack!‚Äù
Come to find out, it was Stuart Little behind the dresser munching on Bandit‚Äôs granola bar that was in his hip pocket. We were all laughing so hard we couldn‚Äôt breathe!! Unfortunately we found mouse poop everywhere! Even on Bandit‚Äôs clif bar!!!
We were also laughing a lot, because Bandit said it smelled horrible on his side of the cabin by the heater. Come to find out, Moose and Toaster left their underwear next to the heater to dry! We were laughing so hard again that we were crying. We all felt bad for Bandit! But he‚Äôs such a good sport! He never ceases to make us laugh!¬†
The next morning, of course we left while it was raining. Bob Ross and Stogie were going to meet us at the Wayside later. It was so dreary that 9 miles in when we finally took a break, we sat on the trail to eat. We didn‚Äôt even try to get off to find a shelter. But before we knew it we made it to the wayside. We hiked 18.3 miles between 8:30-3:30!
When we arrived at the wayside, we received trail magic!!! Pizza and Breadsticks!! I inhaled three slices. They were delicious!! The gentleman, Rana, gave me his dry sweatshirt to wear so I could get warm. The last mile of trail, we walked in a torrential downpour. The wayside thankfully had their heat on, but I was cold! But of course we all still had to purchase a blackberry milkshake!
Once Bob Ross and Stogie arrived, Open Arms hostel picked us up! We got to do our laundry and take showers! We loved that! We all slept in the basement together and decided that hiker bodies were dumped behind the patched up brick wall. We all just laughed all night long together!!

We ate hotdogs, brats, snickers, Doritos, bananas, cuties, chocolate chip cookies, and we each had two sodas. This was so refreshing, because we had started the portion of trail called the ‚Äúrollercoaster‚Äù. The trail is exactly like what it‚Äôs called. And it was tough in the humidity. We hung out at the trail magic for awhile! The couple that was there was from Indiana AND had a son that went to the University of Cincinnati. What a small world!!! We chatted a lot with them.

Not long into our hike we crossed into WEST VIRGINIA!! And then, we finished hiking the rollercoaster. That was tough! Our hike to our lunch spot at this super nice shelter wasn‚Äôt bad. We ate our lunch there, but the hike down to water was long and steep!! I was sweating so much as I hiked back out. As we were leaving lunch we talked to Rockslide and Mama Bear.¬†
Maybe five minutes later, the sky got dark and it decided to torrential downpour on us. The rain actually felt good since it was hot today. Our shoes were soaked though, so I decided I would March through every large puddle instead of avoiding them to make it fun!
The rest of the walk into Harper‚Äôs Ferry was rough on our feet, because there were so many rocks!! We were so happy to make it to the hotel.¬†
Once we arrived we reunited with Stogie, Bob Ross, Bandit, and Toaster! We were so happy to see them! Then we also saw at least 20 other hikers! It felt like most of the inn was filled with them!
We all ordered pizza for dinner and then had some Bourbon in Stogie‚Äôs room. It was a wonderful day! Can‚Äôt wait to sleep in in the morning!","Raven Rocks Hollow

From there we walked to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy headquarters to see where we were at for the number of hikers to make it through. We started with the numbers 1637 and 1638. We walked into Harper‚Äôs Ferry around 1016 and 1017. That‚Äôs pretty impressive since there were over 3000 people trying to hike the trail. We got our photo at the front of the building as well!
From there we walked downtown to the outfitter to pick up a couple of supplies. We had to fix Moose‚Äôs trekking poles again. The tips came completely off his poles and we for sure lost one of the tips in a giant rock. Afterwards, Stogie, Bob Ross, Fizz, Moose, and I went to the Rabbit Hole for lunch. We were happy to get a meal for lunch that we didn‚Äôt have to cook! Then we walked back to the hotel to take a nap and then get a shuttle ride to Walmart for a short resupply.¬†
We got an Uber, and it was sketchy! We got one to fit four people but there was room for only 3. He had his grandson with him, but we all squished in. I wish people knew how to drive their car within the painted lines, as well! I was thankful when we arrived safely!!!¬†
After Stogie, Bob Ross, Moose and I got our resupply, we met back up with Toaster and Bandit. We walked across the street to get some Mexican food for dinner. The food and margaritas were DELICIOUS!! It was a great choice!!!¬†
Back at the hotel we all gathered in Stogie‚Äôs room and hung out while drinking bourbon. We love this group and it seems we all love hanging out together!!

Leaving Harper‚Äôs Ferry we saw some gorgeous views of the rivers crashing into each other, train tracks with active trains, and Chili P. found 40 bucks randomly laying on the ground!¬†
As we got higher up into the mountains, the views were extremely Smokey due to the fires in Canada. The air quality index is not good. As we were walking up the trail, Moose got stung by a wasp (looked like it hurt). Also, he said it hurt when I poked it.¬†
Lunch was at a pavilion and a random guy living in his van let Chili P. doodle on a piece of paper for motivation to finish the day. Her feet were hurting her. She needs new shoes.¬†
Bandit told Chili P a lot about Japanese culture and about Geo-Cashing. She‚Äôs ready to visit Japan and Geo-Cash herself.¬†
We got into camp early this evening and all six of us (Toaster, Bandit, Bob Ross, Stogie, Moose, Chili P) had dinner together! It was really nice!!

We did miss the rain that was supposed to come, so we were so happy about that. The shelter that we walked to at the end of the day was beyond full.

Today was a whirlwind. We had some good highs, but then some lows too. It‚Äôs really hard to not let your lows overshadow the good in your day. Especially when your day is mostly good. It has also been 100 days out on trail now. That‚Äôs a lot of time to be outdoors and walking!
We woke up early and was out of camp by 7:30. We hiked to Pen Mar Park to get a ride into town to resupply. We ended getting a shuttle eventually to take us to Walmart. In the Walmart we ate at subway, and I always thought‚Ä¶ who would eat here at a subway in Walmart! Well now I know,‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs hikers. Then a trail angel came and took us back to trail for free!!! (We love free. Especially since we are not bringing any sort of income in right now). It was amazing! Jen and her husband like to take hiker loops around town to pick up hikers and shuttle them. Moose Jaw asked if they accept donations, and bless their heart, they said, ‚ÄúNo sir, we do not. That would steal our joy.‚Äù They were so sweet!!
When we got back to the park, we packed up our food items at a picnic table and hit the trail. It was a grueling 15 miles. Mostly because my feet hurt, and I need new shoes. Plus a fully packed resupply is heavy!!! Of course there wasn‚Äôt a lot of water along trail and a spot we had picked out near a road to get water ended up being a total bust. So, not only did we waste time there, but the last two miles of the day we had to run because it started raining. That made us super grumpy. It was hard not to angry walk the last 2 miles.¬†
When we got into camp, we met another hiker named City Dog, and we found spots next to him in the shelter. We were not about to set up our tent in the rain, and after all we had gotten to camp sort of late. We had barely any water, so we had to make a quarter mile trek downhill to get it. The water source looked,‚Ä¶ unappetizing. Some days I just get sick of walking. Today was one of those days!","Raven Rock Shelter

Today was a good day. We woke up and were out of camp by 7:20! I get excited when we start hiking early, because every fiber of my being does not want to get up early. I have mad respect for morning people! We started off slow due to the rocks and our packs were still heavy from resupply. About 5.4 miles into our day we made it to a shelter, and it was perfect timing because it started to rain. We ate an early lunch and as we were getting our things out, Truffle and I‚Äôll Be arrived!! We haven‚Äôt seen them in an entire month!!! We were so happy to reunite with them! They were slack packing today, so at the end of the day they were about 4 miles ahead of us.

It sounds a lot more exciting than what it felt crossing that milestone. It was near the end of the day for us, so my feet were killing me. Moose and I can‚Äôt wait for our new shoes tomorrow!!! Hitting halfway was a little daunting because it felt like we have to do what we did all over again, and it‚Äôs been so tough up to this point!
Right before we hit the halfway point, we ran into Burning man again! He was doing trail magic for Link, so we got some sodas and pizza from him. It was awesome!! We were so thankful!!¬†
All in all, today was great. We all ate dinner together and Link joined us. It was extremely hot and humid today. It‚Äôs weird sweating so much.

When we finally got into boiling springs for lunch, everything was closed except the gas station. I about cried. Mostly because I was hungry and tired. I was grateful for gas station food. Better than our camp food that we eat all of the time. It was so hot that when we set our tent out to dry, it dried within 10 minutes. And our tent was SOAKED from the rain!! We then finished our hike into Carlisle, PA. We got a room at the Quality Inn for a hiker rate. The beds were so comfortable!! Since we were hungry, we walked to the dinner next door. It was the typical 6 of us, plus blackeyed Susan. We met her on trail, and she brought us some trail magic when we arrived to the Inn! She was so kind! She is going to hike the entire trail in 2029.

Besides the horrendously hot weather and humidity, we were extremely blessed when we made it into town. We stopped into the 7-11 and got free slurpies, and then made our way to the local Lutheran church for a free hiker spaghetti dinner. Truffle‚Äôs entire group was there along with CT!! We were so happy to see Cow again too! We just adore them so much! They make us so happy every single time we see them!! Merlin was also there with his dog! It was wonderful seeing everyone! So many hikers! Then, we made our way to a donation based church hostel called the Duncannon Assembly of God. It literally was a basement where a bunch of hikers set up their Mata to sleep. Thankfully there was a 5-star shower and a great kitchen! We fit so many hikers into this space (no less than 18 hikers)! Plus there were many many more outside. When we took our items to the laundry mat, another group actually paid to wash our laundry and provided us detergent!! They collect quarters and pay for hiker‚Äôs laundry twice every month! It just so happened that we were there!! It was amazing!!! I felt beyond blessed!
The only downfall today is that Moose Jaw‚Äôs new shoes are not working out for him. He got horrendous blisters. So we decided to get a shuttle to take us to REI tomorrow to get him a different pair. It puts a small kink in plans, but it‚Äôs nothing that can‚Äôt be taken care of! We want his heels to get better! I‚Äôm worried about them. One looks bad. But it‚Äôll be okay.¬†

We left camp around 11 today, because 2.5 miles back we found out that Stogie got stung by a bee four times. He‚Äôs very allergic so he took 6 benedryl and an antacid. We were very worried about him so we waited at camp for him to catch up. He was doing better, but his anxiety from getting stung kind of took over. Just before Stogie arrived with Bob Ross, Bandit was getting anxiety so he took off to hike on his own today. He needed alone time. Totally understandable.¬†
We took several breaks today due to the weather and we wanted to keep an eye on Stogie. About 3 miles before we got to the shelter it started to sprinkle, and unfortunately Stogie‚Äôs trekking pole snapped and he took a spill. It‚Äôs been a rough day for him.

Before we left the shelter, I was laughing so hard!! Mostly because Moose Jaw likes to make the sound ‚Äúuntz untz untz‚Äù over and over like a beatboxer. Today, he did that as toaster was squatting on the ground and as bandit balanced one foot on the table. As soon as he made the noice, they started to bop up and down and dance to the beat. I was crying! It has become a thing now where Nicholas will randomly start doing that and then we all start dancing. I love every bit of it!!! Everyone also loves swinging their hips back and forth to make their Fanny packs away due to Nicholas always doing that randomly to make everyone giggle. It‚Äôs so funny!!!
We booked it into town! We hiked 9 miles without stopping. That‚Äôs pretty impressive to me! Once we made it into town, we got some sodas and fudge from the Peanut Shop. It was delicious!! Then we got a shuttle into town to resupply at the Walmart. From there, Bandit and I walked to Cabelas and the Microtel to get a couple of backpacking items and then get a shower and do laundry while the others went to the Cigar International store.¬†
Thankfully they gave us the conference room to pack our food in and to take showers.

We hiked out of town late. Around 6:45. We made it to the shelter late but we got set up and our tents are dry!! We set them up outside the hotel to dry them off. I was so happy to have a dry tent. Nothing puts a damper on my spirits more than a wet tent tub. When that is wet, it gets everything else wet. Right before trail we had to remove a tick from Bandit‚Äôs leg. He was freaked out.

Our group seemed pretty emotional today. I think we all need a break from each other. We hiked to a hostel, and everyone in our group decided to order Chinese.

The rocks were CRAZY!!! We climbed up the side of a mountain today on giant boulders! It was wild!! Today was extremely tough. Most of our hike made us exposed to the sun and it was so hot and humid!! Water has also been scarce here in Pennsylvania. We ran across a water cache that also had some sodas in it today! It was awesome! We really needed some water. Then before we started our giant climb of the day, there was another cooler where moose and I got the last cold Coca Cola! So we shared it to give us energy before we started the incline. We were determined to make it to the ski lodge for dinner and beer. And water. Otherwise it would have been a ridiculously long (20 mile long) water carry. That‚Äôs too much when you‚Äôre cooking dinner and walking in the heat!¬†
The incline was the most challenging incline so far!! We were literally climbing giant boulders up the side of a mountain. It was tough! Typically you look left and right for the white blazes, but here we had to look straight up! It was WILD!! Very challenging in the heat ¬†we were sweating so much,‚Ä¶ we were absolutely disgusting.
However, Moose and I were so proud of ourselves! We crushed it today!! We saw a giant rattlesnake as well on trail today! It was fat and very dark. I‚Äôm sure it was probably a timber rattlesnake. The rocks are crazy in Pennsylvania, and we know there are many more boulder fields to come!!¬†
At the ski lodge we saw CT, watermelon man, and Merlin. We said hi to them, but then just got a table for the two of us. Moose and I enjoyed beers and food. We were so happy yet so tired. Around 7:30 we hiked out to a stealth site. We can‚Äôt wait for our zero day!","View

All the rocks I could ever imagine are put on the AT trail in Pennsylvania. They really beat up your feet!!¬†
Today was just another day of hiking to be honest! However we did stop at a motel right off trail to take a break for lunch and buy some sodas! We can easily drink 6 sodas, back to back when we are hiking. There‚Äôs nothing like a cold soda when you‚Äôre on trail sweating.¬†
Right before camp, we stopped at this water source that looked like a small pond and we saw Billy Goat!! We haven‚Äôt seen him since pearisburg!! Over 600 miles ago! It was great to see him! We heard that unfortunately Sun Ray got off trail, but Sun Ray is hoping he will get back on. Over the past few days we have heard of many hikers that have been quitting. We have also heard from many other hikers still hiking that their morale on trail has been depleted. One hiked just wants to bulldoze ahead to get the trail over with.

Today was a good day!! We woke up in the middle of the night to Toaster and Bandit freaking out because a bear was walking through camp.

When we woke up it was a torrential downpour with lightening, so I slept until it was over and we had to pack up our things!¬†
Then we were on the move to town and our desired Zero Day! Every time we see someone in the group texting while hiking (which we call texting and driving) we put our trekking poles up to our mouth like a walkie talkie and tell said hiker to pull over for texting and driving. Then we make siren noises until they stop walking or put their phones away. We always laugh when we do that, but we have seen too many hikers trip, roll their ankles, and fall for ‚Äútexting and driving.‚Äù We had to do this today for bandit and toaster!
We finally made it to town and we can‚Äôt be happier!!! We checked into our rooms since they were ready early and then walked across the street to an ice cream joint. We ordered root beer floats and they were absolutely delicious!! We then walked to lunch. Since we are adults, we‚Äôre allowed to have ice cream before our lunch. But typical me couldn‚Äôt finish my lunch! HA! Afterwards I FaceTimed my mom and then went to Walmart for our resupply.

Yes, our diet is horrible, but we need the calories!!
We usually look at our food by the calorie to weight ratio. We want high calorie and low weight. We take the calories and divide by the weight. If that ratio is above a 4, that‚Äôs awesome! If it‚Äôs above a 3, we will still purchase. Below a 3, and it‚Äôs likely we are only buying that food for morale.¬†
When we got a ride back from Walmart, it was a torrential downpour!! I took a shower and then all six of us (our usual group) headed to the first floor of the Inn for Jazz night. It‚Äôs the longest running Jazz lounge. We ate dinner and listened to a Jazz quartet for the evening. It was so relaxing, and we felt normal for once!!! It was a lovely night together and the quartet was amazing!! The singer had a wonderful voice!! Unlike Moose Jaw and I. Our singing is terrible, but we shamelessly sing often!!
Then before I went to bed I talked to my younger brother and my aunt!! I miss them dearly along with everyone else! Can‚Äôt wait until we are done, but also excited for everything else we get to experience coming up on trail!","Stealth Site

Chili Pepper & Moose Jaw,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666891,"Today was just lovely!! Absolutely lovely. I was so happy to not be hiking for once. Talking to the group about my horrific foot pain (the pads of my feet) in addition to the Achilles tendinitis, we think I have plantar fasciitis. I‚Äôm the middle of the night when I went to go to the bathroom, my legs collapsed because my feet hurt so much when I stepped down from the bed. I‚Äôm going to have to start doing some stretching and making sure I‚Äôm switching out my shoes sooner!
After waking up, Moose Jaw and I went to get coffee before his hair appointment. Across the Deer Head Inn was a salon, and we had an appointment for him to get an undercut! That lady was soooo nice. And then her boyfriend from Puerto Rico came in and took the straight razor to Moose‚Äôs head and beer! He was a barber in the broncs for a long time. He did an absolutely amazing job on his hair. Nicholas looks so good!! He‚Äôs so happy with his look. However,‚Ä¶ when the lady dried his hair, it curled at the bottom which his hair normally doesn‚Äôt do. I told him he looked like Lord Farquad from Shrek. Now we can‚Äôt unsee it and it‚Äôs a running joke. He said he‚Äôs going to wear his hair up for the next month until it get longer. I just laughed!! Otherwise, we are super pleased with his haircut! It looks awesome!!
From there we went back to the room to cool off and grab our clothes to do laundry. We had to walk to a different hotel in order to do our laundry since the Inn we are staying at doesn‚Äôt have a washer and dryer for guests to use. On our walk over we got a temporary replacement sleeping pad for Moose Jaw, until Nemo sends a replacement for the current one that has a hole. However, they have been slow to respond to us, even though the initial email was a quick reply. Then we got a sandwich for lunch to share and made it to the hotel.¬†
After laundry was finished we went back to the Inn and took a nap. It felt incredible to sleep some more. In the air conditioning. Then we FaceTimed my parents for awhile. I miss them so much!! I can‚Äôt wait to see them when we are done with trail.¬†
For dinner we went to the Tavern near us. Except it was a nice Tavern!! We all were having a grand time, and then Bandit got super excited stating that he got us all gifts! Apparently, at the hotel that we did laundry at there were several claw machines. He saw a plastic Chili Pepper in one and was determined to get it for me! Well he won it along with a bunch of other little items!! So when he present the chili pepper to me, I was sooo excited! I loved it!! And then I saw it was a pen!! Even better!! Best gift on trail so far!! Moose Jaw got a squishy tiger. Stogie got a plastic boat. Toaster got a squishy dinosaur. Bob Ross got a spinning top. And Bandit kept a squishy gator. It was awesome! Definitely felt like Christmas in July!!
When we got back to the Inn, Toaster, Bob Ross, Stogie, and I sat on the porch and just chatted. The other three smoked cigars. I had one, but didn‚Äôt feel in the mood to smoke on tonight. Then we had cake for Stogie‚Äôs Birthday (it was yesterday)! It was absolutely delicious!!! Moose Jaw joined us for the chocolate cake.¬†
Now, it‚Äôs time for bed. Late again, but happy as can be! What a lovely day!!
Today‚Äôs Post on Facebook from Nicholas:
Well, that‚Äôs the end of Pennsylvania folks! We have walked just shy of 1300 miles so far.
16 days. No zeros. 271 miles.¬†
‚úÖ West Virginia¬†‚úÖ Maryland¬†‚úÖ Pennsylvania ¬†
The Accumulative Elevation gain from our hike so far is 337,700 feet. Mt Everest is 29,032 Feet. Somebody check my math:
337,700 / 29,032 = 11.63
We‚Äôve climbed enough to summit Everest 11.63 times. üò≥üò≥ü§Øü§Ø¬†
Tomorrow we will start hiking in New Jersey, by the end of next week we plan to be in New York. We‚Äôre exhausted, our feet hurt worse than ever. The rain sucks. Not showering for 5 days at a time sucks. Waking up every 60 minutes to blow up my air mat sucks. The heat and humidity make us sweat through the night. We are being challenged mentally and physically in ways we‚Äôve never been stretched before, and to call this hike a test of character would be an understatement. I am so thankful to have a companion like Sarah Kay, to tackle this colossal feat with. I love you Chili üå∂Ô∏è.¬†
We have approximately 900 miles left, and some of the biggest challenges still remain: the white mountains in New Hampshire, the flooded trails in New York and Vermont, and the 100-mile wilderness in Maine.¬†

It was hard to leave town. We all kind of wanted another zero day, but due to the upcoming things we want to do, we decided to Nero (nearly zero) out. Plus, Toaster flipped a coin and it did hit tails which meant we had to hit the trail.¬†
Before Moose Jaw and I left, I took an hour nap on the covered patio to the Deer Head Inn. I was just exhausted. The others hiked out while I was sleeping. As we started our hike out it began to sprinkle. It has been raining so much. The trail is flooded in so many areas, and there is running water flowing down the trail. Our shoes got soaked!!
Although, the good news is‚Ä¶
We have officially completed 1300 miles!!!¬†
That‚Äôs huge for us!!
Right after we hit 1300 miles, I was stung on the calf by a yellow jacket. It hurt so bad. Moose Jaw said that when I yelled it sounded like a battle cry. I‚Äôll take it. I‚Äôll sound like a Valkyrie.¬†
Our camp spot for the evening was beautiful. There was a gorgeous sunset. And we saw many deer up close. Apparently there is a huge deer problem in New Jersey.¬†

Chili Pepper & Moose Jaw,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667475,"Today was interesting to say the least. It was a long day, and at the end of it my feet were absolutely killing me. Our pace was slow,‚Ä¶ Georgia slow. Less than 2mph slow. But after lunch we picked it up.¬†
This morning as we were walking, a bug flew into my mouth and made me choke. So I came up with a poem for it.¬†
My oh my, Chili swallowed a flyIt choked her out and made her cry
Then not long later, Moose got stung by a yellow jacket. These darn things keep coming out of nowhere and attacking our legs!! It‚Äôs miserable. My stings from yesterday were so absolutely swollen today. The large are surrounding it was too tender to touch and it was throbbing. And the area where it stung me kept hurting. Almost like a phantom sting. It‚Äôs not good.¬†
Everything is super wet from the rains. When we walk through an area with heavy foliage on both sides that protrude into the trail and it gets us wet, we call it a Car Wash. Then of course I have to sing, ‚Äúworking at the car wash‚Äù from Shark Tales.¬†
We had lunch at the fire tower. Moose Jaw went up for a look, but he said the views weren‚Äôt great. Then as he sat down for lunch, he found a tick on his leg. We had to remove it using a tick key. Then we circled the area with a sharpie so we could keep an eye on it. It was an adult American Dog Tick. Apparently those carry Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. I will have to keep on eye on him, and make sure he doesn‚Äôt get any symptoms.¬†
Not long after lunch we spotted a Timber Rattle snake crossing the trail. It looked like it just ate lunch, as well!¬†
We received trail magic right after lunch. I got a soda, and Moose Jaw received a burger and a couple of sodas as well. It was nice that they were doing trail magic for the hikers. We didn‚Äôt stay long since we still had 11 miles to hike.¬†
We made our way to Crater Lake. Moose Jaw and Bandit hopped in for a swim. There were other hikers there as well. We talked about chaffing. A lot of people don‚Äôt tell you that when you hike in the rain or in the humidity in your sweat that your booty cheeks start to chafe. That has happened to everyone in our group except Bob Ross and Stogie. I have also gotten thigh chaffing so I switched to 9‚Äù inseam shorts. We now carry Desitin, and it works wonders! That stuff is amazing!!
Unfortunately, about 1 mile from camp, Moose Jaw was stung again!! It said it wasn‚Äôt as bad as the first one, but that section was still slightly swollen.¬†
As I took my socks off at camp, I realized that I had an allergic reaction to something, because I had hives on my legs just above and below my sock line. I have no idea what caused it, but it was itchy!!
We are all excited to go to bed tonight. It was a long day, and everyone was so tired. I hope everyone is in much better spirits tomorrow. I didn‚Äôt think it was a bad day, it was just a tough day. And that‚Äôs okay!! :)","Backpacker Campsite

Today was rough. Our feet were absolutely killing us. The rocks were relentless. Worse than Pennsylvania. Absolutely no breaks in trail where they eased up. It was extremely challenging. And then there was the issue of where I was stung on my leg‚Ä¶ the area surrounding it started to turn reddish purple, and then as the day went on the red area started to expand. My reaction also was not completely gone and the bug bites surrounding the reaction were turning into blisters. I‚Äôm not sure what happened, but all of us are worried. If it isn‚Äôt better tomorrow, then we will take a trip to urgent care.¬†
We received awesome trail magic about four miles into our hike. There was everything you could imagine there! Including ice cream! Yum!! It was a nice start to the day even though it seemed like everything after that went to crap. Stogie got stung today along with Bob Ross.¬†
The humidity and high temperatures have us all beat. The shelter area was nice with awesome water, but it was beyond packed. I think we are in a bubble right now, and it gets irritating. Especially when you have to share tent areas. I can‚Äôt wait to get out of the bubble, but I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs going to happen.¬†
New Jersey stinks. Quite literally smells bad. So many times on trail it smells like rotten mushrooms. It‚Äôs horrible. But it could be because there are so many mushrooms on trail. Extremely tiny ones, and extremely large ones (bigger than my hand).¬†

We decided to determine if we were going to go to Urgent Care when we got to town. The miles to town were much less rocky and a million times more muddy. It felt like we were taking all of the mud with us. 
We walked into town and had NY pizza, ice cream, and wings. We hung out at the tavern for awhile while our things were charging. We decided not to go to urgent care. Plus, we couldn‚Äôt get a shuttle anyways. Dave, the owner of the tavern, was so kind to all of us hikers. We didn‚Äôt leave town until 4:30, and then we hiked this horrible incline to the shelter.

Chili Pepper & Moose Jaw,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667479,"Today has had its highs and lows. As seems to be typical the past week or so. Mostly highs today. My sleeping pad has a slow leak in it. I was in denial at first, but then knew for sure waking up this morning. We didn‚Äôt have far to hike today until our first break, which we took at Heaven Hill creamery (right before Stairway to Heaven). For about two miles prior to reaching the creamery we got to walk on a flat boardwalk. It was magical!! I loved every bit of it! We did have to wear our big head nets today and yesterday. Due to all of the standing water and wet ground, the mosquitos are absolutely out of control. As I walk, I see just swarms of them everywhere. If it‚Äôs not ticks, it‚Äôs mosquitos.¬†
As we finished walking on the boardwalk to the creamery, cattle were walking along the trail. It was funny. Moose moo‚Äôed at them. The Heaven Hill Creamery had amazing ice cream!! I got the blueberry cream ice cream in a waffle cone. Moose Jaw got raspberry chocolate chunk and another flavor in a bowl. It was delicious!! Then we walked across the street to a hotdog stand to get some chili cheese dogs. They had a soda there called White Birch Beer. I had never had it before, so I decided to try it. It was delicious!! It almost tasted like old fashioned root beer candies that I would get from my music teacher in elementary school. It was awesome.¬†
Then we climbed the Stairway to Heaven. It wasn‚Äôt as bad as I thought it would be. I did sweat a lot, though! We were hiking to the Warwick turnpike so we could get picked up and taken to the Warwick Drive-In Theater! Waiting for our ride was irritating though, because group dynamic was off today. We don‚Äôt usually hike together, but for the past 6 miles we did. Not sure that‚Äôs a great idea. We set up our tent at the Drive-In once we arrived. It was pretty neat! There were three screens, and Indiana Jones was going to play on the middle screen. After walking to get food, we all hung out at the Cidery with a bunch of other hikers such as Flower, Steve, Hello, etc. The cidery was really neat! Plus everything tasted great! I really enjoyed myself.¬†
Then I walked back to the Drive-In and saw Jess and Ripper!! I was so happy to see them! Moose and I watched part of Indiana Jones, but then fell asleep. We were exhausted. I was happy to go to bed.¬†
It was a good day, but I got extremely irritated towards the end of the day. It‚Äôs hard listening to people who complain about everything, especially things they choose to do. So, there‚Äôs that. Stogie suggested a zero day tomorrow. We will see what happens.¬†Funny story: There were these citrus smelling, fuzzy, balls that fall from the trees. Moose gave one to Bandit it and told him to toss it at Toaster. So he did. Then Toaster threw one back and put a hole in Bandits tent!!! Plus, since his tent is single wall, he was so sad!

Today was a relaxing day.¬†
We woke up in our tents and the outside was soaked due to the crazy thunderstorm last night. We knew we were going to hike out today, so we decided to walk to get breakfast from the bagel joint around the corner. As we walked in, Toaster declared that we were going to take a zero. That rubbed me the wrong way at first, because we were all going to chat about it and Toaster, Bandit, Moose Jaw and I had planned on sharing a room that night after hiking. I didn‚Äôt like how we weren‚Äôt included in the conversation. So, I took a walk to the grocery store to brush off my irritability. It was totally fine that we take a zero! I think I woke up on the wrong side of the bed ¬†
The further north we go, it is much more challenging to find a place to resupply, wash our laundry, and shower in one single town. Plus, everything gets much more expensive. It‚Äôs definitely annoying when trying to plan out mileage.¬†
When I got back from the grocery, a shuttle picked us up to drop us off at the Hamlet Inn. Thankfully they had extra rooms, so everyone got their own. Moose Jaw and I showered and then the lady who owns the inn let us borrow her car to do our laundry.¬†
So, Toaster drove us to the laundromat to do our laundry. Everyone there was so kind!! They even had a bin of loaner clothes for us to wear while we washed our clothes. Everything from our bags smelled horrific. Moose Jaw wore these cute pajama shorts that were light blue with care bear looking bears on them. I‚Äôm pretty sure they were lady shorts, but he made them look good!!¬†
We picked up Mediterranean food on our way back to the Inn and ate our food while watching a movie. Then we took a two hour nap. We have been exhausted.¬†
I took out our wet tent to dry. As I laid it over the banister to the Inn, I gagged. It smelled just as bad as our dirty clothes. Luckily the owner had some Febreze for us to spray our tent with. I hope it smells better.¬†
For dinner, Moose and I walked across the street. We weren‚Äôt super hungry, but we knew we needed to fuel our bodies. Then we went back to the inn, patched the leak in my sleeping pad, and went to bed.¬†

I had a great breakfast sandwich while Moose Jaw had French toast and eggs. It was such a peaceful breakfast sitting together. We did purchase him new shoes during breakfast, though. Yesterday, he happened to look at the bottom of his shoe and he could out his finger through the bottom of both his shoes!! They say shoes die in Pennsylvania, and I think his shoes did.¬†

New York already smells better than dirty Jersey. And the views were great today! You could actually see the skyline way off in the distance from one of the boulders we scrambled up today. For lunch we hopped off trail to a hot dog stand! We drank all of the sodas, and then right around the corner was the best dang creamery I have ever been to!! Bellvale Farms Creamery! I got cherry vanilla in a waffle cone and Moose Jaw got half chocolate with brownie bits and vanilla with peanut butter and peanut butter cups in a bowl. It was delicious!! And the view was just, ahhhh!! üòç Absolutely breathtaking. I could have stayed there all day. We met this family from New York and talked to them for awhile. They actually had a friend visiting from Barbados!! She gave us some tips on what to do when we visit in October. It was just meant to be to go to this creamery!!
After soaking up the views, we headed back to trail and hiked to camp. A stealth spot near some water. It seems as if that‚Äôs the way to go now, since there aren‚Äôt many designated camping spots on our app that we use as a guide while on trail (FarOut).¬†
We weren‚Äôt hungry for dinner because as we laid in our tent we smashed an entire bag of salt and vinegar chips that we packed out from our last resupply.¬†

Today was beyond challenging. It took us until noon to go only five miles. We were dying. We had to climb so many rocks. And the amount of PUDS (pointless ups and downs) were absolutely ridiculous!! There was a section that was so steep going down, that we had to put our poles and and carefully lower ourselves. We were absolutely wiped. I couldn‚Äôt believe how slow and tired we were.¬†
Then of course, a couple of miles late Moose and I came up to the lemon squeeze. A section of trail that was so skinny (a cut section out of a large boulder) you had to hold your pack over your head to set up on the ledge so you could squeeze through and then come back for your pack. Just to take your pack off again to climb up the rocks right afterwards. It was fun to do this! But also exhausting. I‚Äôm not sure how we got energy to complete the rest of the day. We just new we had to put in miles, because we have to make it to a certain mile marker by Tuesday evening.¬†
As we were hiking past a lake, we saw a sign on the ground. It said, ‚ÄúTrail Magic for Thru-hikers. Tan Camry. Back left door.‚Äù So what did we do‚Ä¶ we walked down the road and opened the back left door to the parked Toyota Camry. Inside were fresh baked cookies and a limeade. So what did we do,‚Ä¶ we ate some cookies and drank some limeade. Crazy how trustworthy you get as a thru-hiker!! So we signed the trail log with our trail names and went back to work. I mean hiking.¬†
When we ran into the rest of the group later that day, everyone was GRUMPY!!! I think it‚Äôs the heat.¬†
Moose and I decided to hike on while everyone went a different route. Long story short, there was a small 5 miles section of trail that has beautiful views of NY that has been a part of the AT until 2 years ago. At the road crossing, a 60 year-old woman was hit and killed by a vehicle back in 2021. So, the Appalachian Trail Conservancy rerouted the trail further down the road so you miss these awesome views! We said, screw that! We want to see the views and get an awesome camp spot today! So, Moose Jaw and I went ahead, easily crossed the road, and hiked this section of trail. And my oh my, we saw a breathtaking sunset! Not an Arizona sunset, but one of the best I have seen in a long time on trail. I loved it!! Moose and I ran to the ledge after setting up our tent to watch the sun go down! It was superb!! I was so happy we took this route. Then we crawled into the tent, made dinner, and went to sleep.¬†

Anyways. This is how sometimes I preoccupy my time while hiking. Especially today since we hiked 22 miles and I felt like I was dying the entire time. But also the four sodas I drank right before we came up with that poem probably helped.¬†
Moose and I left our stealth spot this morning around 8. Apparently, some bears around 12:30 walked around our tent. Moose told me. I had no idea. I always sleep with ear plugs these days and of course my eye mask. Blissful ignorance to the outside world and wildlife!
We hiked through bear mountain today. It‚Äôs officially closed due to the flooding from a few weeks back, but it seemed just fine for us thru-hikers! There was a ton of debris, though. And the main road was washed out some. But we barely hiked on the road. I thought the views were gorgeous! It was nice being there without all of the tourism. When I got a monster from the vending machine, it gave me two for the price of one! I loved that!! It made my day!
And then before we new it, we walked around the zoo and across the Hudson River. It was AWESOME! But the steep incline after the bridge crossing was not awesome. The dang mosquitos ate us alive today, all day long, even with our bug nets on and ample amounts of bug spray. So much, that we ran out and now are scared for tomorrow. They have swarmed everyone. Mosquito tornado, 24/7.¬†
About 13 miles in, we hit up the Appalachian Market. This is a glorified shell gas station. Meaning it‚Äôs a tiny shell gas station where you can buy hot food that two women cook for you. We met two carpenters today at the gas station who are from Argentina. They were super kind! We enjoyed our conversation with them! We chilled at the gas station for like 2.5 hours. Mostly drank all of the sodas and ate some food. The fruit was good! Crazy how gas station food is something I look forward to. Sometimes I‚Äôm disgusted with myself and how low my standards have gotten. But then at the same time, I‚Äôm happy that I get to experience having zero transportation and little food on me, and even going many days without showering. The longest we have gone is 7 days. Now that it‚Äôs hot and humid, we shower more. We have taken showers in the most random places too!! It‚Äôs amazing what you learn towns have to offer for free or little money.¬†
We left the market and hiked some more miles. This is when the poetry slam/rap session ensued. It was fun. But then I was tired and we still had to walk. I don‚Äôt think my feet will ever stop hurting. And it‚Äôs like the rocks continued from Pennsylvania into New York. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be like this for the rest of trail.¬†
Tonight we have tented at this random campground. When we arrived, Bob Ross and two sodas for everyone that he received from trail magic! It was such a wonderful surprise! However, after we grabbed our sodas, we all hurried to set up our tents and climb in because the mosquitos were horrific. So many. I‚Äôve never seen this many before. I‚Äôm glad to be safe in my tent.¬†

And I was so exhausted that I kept tripping over my own feet because it took too much energy to actually lift my legs up when I walked. The five miles to the lake the trail goes around was a tough five miles. We got to the lake and went to the concessions to buy bug spray and food. We didn‚Äôt each much and we‚Äôre absolutely stuffed. With think it was the heat. While eating, we laid out our tent to dry. It became soaking wet from the dew.¬†
When we finally mustered up the energy to leave, we hiked out with a big nets on over our heads. We have been wearing those nets 24/7 (well when we are out of our tent) since entering New Jersey and especially New York. We passed a cooler on trail that was trail magic! We got a nice cold snickers from the cooler to share. As we hiked up this horrible incline (all inclines seem horrible at this point) things started to significantly cool down. We knew a storm was brewing.¬†
And of course, 2 miles out from our destination, the heavens opened and the rain came down. Poured down is more like it. The trail turned into a river. Moose and I were hauling tail. Toaster caught up with us and hiked with us to the the Pizza joint off of trail. There, the Curry Estate was going to pick Moose and I up since we booked a room for the evening. They also had Moose Jaw‚Äôs new shoes there. Which was a good thing, since his old ones had a hole that you could see through. As we waited for our ride, we ordered a large pizza. Well,‚Ä¶ are large pizza in NY is VERY different than a large pizza from your local pizza shop elsewhere. We saw a worker pick up a circular table and set it down next to our table. Then they brought our pizza out. OUR PIZZA GOT IT‚ÄôS OWN TABLE IT WAS SO BIG!!! IT WAS AWESOME!! We obviously had to share the pizza because there was no way we‚Äôd finish the entire thing!!

Trail was not as bad today as it was yesterday, but NY has been tough!! Lots of ups and downs and rocks and muddy sections and bugs and more bugs and ticks and mosquitos and humidity and heat. Although, the sunsets have been beautiful! And honestly, every New Yorker we have met has been extremely nice! Maybe it‚Äôs because we are out of the city!
We hiked 14 miles to a deli that was 0.7 miles off trail. We got there around 6:20 in the evening. Moose and I got a sandwich and ice cream for dinner. The lady was NOT happy about us ordering a sandwich and she made it very clear she wasn‚Äôt happy and that she wanted to go home. But, we got our sandwich!! It‚Äôs nice Deli Blazing through NY and NJ, so we can hike longer since we don‚Äôt have to make ourselves dinner.
We were kind of freaked out, because as we sat on a bench before we walked to the deli, Moose Jaw noticed he had a tick crawling on his leg. I was able to flick it off because it was t attached, but it was a Lone Star tick. Those are absolutely no good!! I hope we never see another one again!! We want to continue to eat red meat!!
After eating and getting ourselves water, we went back to trail to hike another 1.7 miles to a stealth spot. It puts us in a good position for a similar mileage day for tomorrow. 20 mile days are running a toll on our bodies.¬†
As I got around for bed, we have noticed that my bed sting area still doesn‚Äôt look great. We cleaned it up and added Neosporin along with a bandaid. We also noticed that I keep breaking out in hives. Around my ankles and sock area and above my socks. We are not sure what‚Äôs causing this. I‚Äôll just take allergy meds until I‚Äôm better for now.¬†
Today was a really good day. Our feet didn‚Äôt start hurting us until 12 miles in, and the start of our day was super peaceful. I loved today!","NY Route 52 - Curry Estate

Today was a fun and spontaneous!! Moose Jaw and I woke up and started our hike for the day from our stealth spot. About five miles in, we stopped at a country store to get lunch and snacks. There we met a couple of other hikers such as Dos Entrados and Electro. Apparently, Dos Entrados has family in Mishawaka and Middlebury, IN. Which is wild, because I grew up in Mishawaka and I also have family in Middlebury! Small world! He currently lives in Ohio. Dos Entrados also started the same day as us, but we have just never met him up until now. He has always been ahead. He has been a lot of fun to chat with. He definitely has high energy which puts people in chipper moods. Electro is a flip-flopper. He started with a friend that ditched him for hiking too slowly. He‚Äôs young, 21, but fun to chat with! He‚Äôs super funny!¬†
Also, WE MADE IT TO CONNECTICUT TODAY!! Woohoo!!
As we were walking, Moose Jaw and I decided randomly to stop into Kent to resupply. We thought about shuttling in tomorrow, but then determined it was best to do it today since we hiked faster than expected. Also, if we made it to town, we could wait out an impending storm. As we decided, Electro and Dos Entrados arrived. Thankfully, we got a hitch into town!!
We were dropped off at the Sundog Shoe and Leather store, because they have Darn Tough sock exchanges there and Moose Jaw and I both had holes in our socks. So, we got new ones for free!! Plus I got new gaiters since I put multiple holes in my existing ones. From there, Moose Jaw and I resupplied at the local IGA. We sat in the vestibule of the store and packed up the food we bought. We realize we looked weird, and even a little girl asked her dad what we were doing. HA! I felt weird that we looked weird when it was normal for us to do this now! From there we walked to get Chinese food.¬†
We ate with Electro and Dos Entrados. We were so happy that the entire thunderstorm occurred while we were eating. After finishing our food and after the storm had run it‚Äôs course, we were headed to the nearest shelter. Which meant a 0.25 mile back track. Which was fine since it would be around 8 that we would arrive.¬†
We wanted to hitch back, so Moose Jaw held up his bandana that said ‚ÄúHITCH OR RIDE.‚Äù A woman drove by and said that she couldn‚Äôt fit us. We told her no worries, so instead she gave us a huge bottle of wine!! It was awesome! Then she headed to the liquor store to replace her bottle. When she drove by us again, she said she also got us a 6 pack of beer!!! We were so excited!! So instead of a hitch, we got beer and wine! I‚Äôd saw that was a win!! When we got to camp, we shared everything with the other hikers! It was so much fun!! We had a wonderful day! It was great (minus the amount of mosquitos and gnats).
Funny conversation bits from Electro:
Electro: ‚ÄúYou know you‚Äôre in New York when‚Ä¶ you go to a deli and you order a sandwich from someone who hates you.‚Äù
Electro: ‚ÄúI wanted to quit the trail, but then I saw a cool bird. Then I thought to myself, if I quit, then I won‚Äôt see anymore cool woodpeckers. So I kept hiking.‚Äù","Stealth Site

Chili Pepper & Moose Jaw,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667600,"Today was a good day. Moose and I slept in until 7:30. We were extremely tired and knowing that we had less than 12 miles to walk today, it was hard to get out of bed. But we finally did, and we left camp around 9. I felt tired today even though it was an easy day of walking compared to what we have been dealing with. I just felt like I needed a lot of breaks. But eventually Moose and I made it to town. Another hiker named Electro walked with us to town. He was getting picked up by his grandma today to rest and then take a zero tomorrow.¬†
When we arrived to town, we found a little coffee joint and ordered some chai teas. We sat outside in the shade and enjoyed our drinks before we walked across the street to get picked up by the owner of the motel we are staying at for the night. It‚Äôs located in a tiny town that does not have a restaurant. However, the liquor store around the corner (mambo number five reference) gives a free beer to thru-hikers. He‚Äôs been doing that for over 20 years! Which is awesome!! Moose picked me up one, since I decided to stay in the motel and lay in bed watching law and order. My body was just not wanting to walk anymore.¬†
The motel owner did our laundry which was nice. And when we checked in we saw Stogie sitting outside. We chatted for awhile before we went to our room to shower.¬†

We woke up today and got a ride from the owner to the little cafe right next to the reroute for trail (a bridge was washed out from the flooding). Moose Jaw and I ate wonderful breakfast sandwiches. The baker makes the croissants (along with all of the other baked goods) fresh every morning! On the weekends, he gets into the store at 2 in the morning! The sandwiches were delicious! Once we were fueled up we started hiking. And of course it was raining. If we aren‚Äôt wet from sweat, we are wet from the rain.¬†
Early into our hike we met two lovely day hikers. We talked to them for a bit about our trip, and they really encouraged us. We felt a little down hiking in the rain, but they gave us great words of encouragement that really perked up our spirits. These ladies were so kind! We got a selfie with them!
Time flew by today! Before we knew it, it was 3:30 and we hadn‚Äôt taken any breaks and we had hiked 12 miles.¬†
As we were nearing a rocky area, we heard girls screaming. So we kept hiking up towards them since it was right off trail. Then I heard a girl scream, ‚ÄúGrab the camera! Grab the camera!‚Äù It looked like a Girl Scout group. One lady came up to me to ask if I could identify snakes. They found one that was as wide as a softball! I said I could identify some. As I took four steps, I almost had a heart attack. One of the girls had her face 6 inches from a giant copperhead that was tucked under a rock. Moose Jaw did a great job instructing the girl to step away calmly and quickly. I was so stressed that that girl was so close to a copperhead. Things could have went south extremely quickly. I am so thankful that Moose and I decided to walk over to see the snake. We also told them about striking distance, so they didn‚Äôt meander too close again.¬†
When we got close to Falls Village, we realized it was going to storm. So, we found out that there was a gentleman who goes by the Toymaker who lets hikers tent in his yard for free! It was nice because we set up our tents and then hung out and got an early dinner at the cafe in town! It poured while we were here, so it worked out that we got our tents up before the rain!!
From the cafe we walked around the corner to the Tavern. Our bartender was sassy and just great!! Moose asked her how the Moscow mules were. She said that she‚Äôs been doing this for over 20 years and she will make me the ‚Äúshittiest mule I have ever had.‚Äù We were cracking up! It was an amazing mule!! Then she surprised us with free French fries! They were delicious! Apparently, the bartender was the owner! She was awfully kind to all of us and had us rolling.¬†

Not long into our hike we met four gentleman who were out for the day! They are from the New England area and were super kind! They were also cracking us up! One guy gave Moose Jaw and I a liquid IV. Another hiked in the group said, ‚ÄúNow, now. This seems like a lovely couple. Are you sure you want to give them roofies.‚Äù We laughed so hard! Knowing it was a joke, of course! They were an extremely fun group to talk to!
9 miles in, we found three chairs and a cooler full of sodas for trail magic! It was awesome! Moose and I decided to sit there, enjoy our sodas, and eat lunch. Then out of the blue, Bob Ross was there! He‚Äôs always ahead of us! We claimed it was his clone again! He sat with us while enjoying a soda, as well. He stopped in town that was a mile off trail. He enjoyed the bakery there.¬†
We then tackled a steep incline. At the top we had a wonderful view and met some day hikers. One of the hiker‚Äôs name was Columbia. We called her Freelancer and her friend Sherpa since she wanted a trail name. She was kind and asked us lots of questions about trail. She was super encouraging as well! We love meeting day hikers and section hikers. They are always so chipper! They are like, ‚Äú1.5 miles side trail to see a waterfall! See you there!‚Äù When we are like, ‚Äúugh a 1.5 mile side trail to a waterfall! Heck no! I gotta put in my miles and make it to camp. My feet already hurt. That‚Äôs another 3 miles to my day and my feet already hurt.‚Äù HA! I also have fun meeting some of the SOBO hikers. They are still chipper and don‚Äôt hate waking yet. Plus they have seen the best parts of trail! Their smiles do rub off onto us!
HELLO MASSACHUSETTS!!! We made it!! Four states left!
Mass has beautiful views, but has been super muddy and wet. I fell twice. Thankfully, I didn‚Äôt hurt myself. However, the rocks have been killing my feet. While sitting down, I can feel them throbbing. I think it‚Äôs time for new shoes.¬†

At the bottom, we met some section hikers that were a lot of fun to talk to! They had us cracking up! They have done many sections of the AT in the north. And one lady just finished Connecticut, which is exciting!! When we got to the bottom, they asked us, ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt that rock scramble fun!?‚Äù In my head, I thought it was just an inconvenience. I love how peppy they were about it! It helps me remember that hiking is fun! It‚Äôs hard to think it‚Äôs fun when you rarely get good views anymore. When we see a view that requires an extra twenty steps, we are sometimes like,‚Ä¶ we can see it good enough from here. Then we keep walking. After chatting more, they told us we inspired them! I was shocked! It‚Äôs amazing that being out here inspires people. It just feels like we are living a normal, yet not normal life. One of the ladies asked if the pain goes away. She said she always forgets to ask that. And we were like, no. It never goes away. We just kind of put up with it. I hope we don‚Äôt end up with any permanent injuries.¬†
0.6 miles before town, we received trail magic!! Burgers and hotdogs! They were delicious! It was just Moose Jaw and I there for about an hour. Then we left and got a hitch into town by Spreadsheet. He just so happened to be at the road intersection as we arrived! It was impeccable timing!! When we checked into the quality inn, we took a nap before getting dinner.¬†
For dinner we had sushi, at a place where we actually sit on the ground! It was awesome! I had never done that before. But now I want a table where you can sit on the ground to eat at. The chairs without legs did have backs for us to lean onto which was nice! We had our legs outstretched. It‚Äôs hard to keep them bent for long periods of time because they hurt.¬†
After dinner we got some delicious ice cream! We met a gentleman named Joey outside of the ice cream joint! Joey moved from New York to Massachusetts because he missed being outside. So he bought a bunch of land and has been here since! He is awfully kind! He loves the outdoors including skiing! We talked about the trail a lot and showed him the app we use for a map of the trail. It was humbling to hear him say we inspired him. We focus a lot on how trial affects us, but we rarely think about how our experience may affect others. It‚Äôs extremely humbling and encourage. Joey has been wanting to do the trail for some time now, and I think he should go for it!! He seems much more prepared than we were!

She was looking to share a room with another Hiker so we put her in touch with Cambio. He was looking to split the cost of a room as well, but moose and I only had one bed in our room. While our clothes were washing, we got breakfast at a little Patisserie shop. Great Barrington is a ritzy area. We definitely did not fit in wearing our sleep clothes with socks and crocks. But I always say, if you ain‚Äôt sockin‚Äô while crockin, then you ain‚Äôt rockin‚Äô.¬†
When we grabbed our dry clothes, we met a mom thru-hiking with her three kiddos. Goose, sonic, buttercup, and jelly bean. That‚Äôs just impressive! We talked about high calorie food that doesn‚Äôt weigh much.¬†
After we dropped our clothes off, Moose was hangry. On our walk to the Big Y to resupply, we stopped to get pizza. He was much better afterwards! The ladies checking out our items at the store were extremely kind! They scanned their grocery card for us to receive discounts and then asked a lot of questions about trail. They were super encouraging. It‚Äôs nice to hear words of encouragement, because lately it has been hard leaving town to go back to trail. They did make us laugh, because they said we looked good for being thru-hikers. I told her we like to shower. She laughed. She said it was more than that, we don‚Äôt look starved and shabby. I‚Äôm glad we have a ‚ÄúI live in the woods‚Äù type of glow.¬†
Hank, a local shuttle driver picked us up to take us back to the quality inn. He was high energy, super kind, and carried our groceries up to our door for us! It was awesome! He sure made us laugh a lot on our short ride!

Our friends crummy bear hang still presided over the picnic table, a victorious emblem reminding me of Georgia. Packing up camp was a clean task today having set our tent up on the wooden platforms available at the tent site.¬†
The beginning of our hike took us to a view over a historical village: the people who lived here were famous for ‚Äúshaking‚Äù during worship and persecuted by more conventional Christian sects for their strange practice. The meadows were beautiful, as were the pine trees, perfect hiking weather today! Only a few miles in we crossed a road where a guy had a shed with a working refrigerator and venmo sign up, along with wifi. So we purchased some sodas and enjoyed the picnic bench looking out over the grassy fields. A brief moment of peace: less bugs, cool temps, less sweat, clear skies‚Ä¶ almost felt like an Arizona winter day!¬†
Continuing our hike we had some respectable inclines over the first ten miles. We passed two major recreational ponds. One of which had a famous ‚ÄúUpper Goose Pond Cabin‚Äù that has bunks available for rent and is a phenomenal swimming hole‚Ä¶. Sometimes it‚Äôs a shame all the cool stuff we have to pass up to hit 21 mile days!

We finished off the last 11 miles to get to the cookie lady cabin on Blueberry Hill farm‚Ä¶ what a beautiful place! There is an old landing strip and an airplane hangar in the back of the property, and a few acres of blueberry bushes where hikers are allowed to eat as much as they want while they‚Äôre picking blueberries!

Today we slept in and it was wonderful! When we decided to get up, we started our chores. I packed our resupply (food) while Moose Jaw went through his pack. I also re-patched my sleeping pad. Hopefully, the patch works this time. We also got a bunch of things around to mail home that we no longer need. Especially since we got a box with a couple of our winter items and my new shoes!!
After we were ready, we walked to the post office to mail some items to my mom‚Äôs house. After that we decided it was time for food. We walked to a coffee shop for something to drink (mocha for Moose and Chai Tea for me). There was a bookstore right next to the coffee shop. I wanted to go in so badly, but for what!? I couldn‚Äôt purchase anything, so I just started longingly through the window like a complete creep before we continued our walk to get Chinese takeout.¬†
After we got our Chinese food and we‚Äôre walking back to the inn, we stopped to get Moose a milkshake. The lady making his milkshake was the same one from yesterday. She asked my how my manicure went, and I told her it was great! My nails look so cute now! I feel like a lady. On trail, I definitely feel more like a forest gremlin.¬†
When we made it back to the Inn, we hung outside on the benches with Toaster, Bandit, and Stogie while we ate our food. It was fun!! It was also crazy that the entire inn was full, but there weren‚Äôt any cars in the parking lot. It was filled with hikers! That was funny! Especially since most of the hikers were hanging outside of their rooms socializing with other hikers.¬†
Funny Story: I asked Bandit how the wipes have been treating him. He said he didn‚Äôt like them, because they burned. I was confused. I brought him a package of wet wipes I had been using to give him, so I asked what he had been using‚Ä¶ he showed me a package of antibacterial wipes meant for counters!! I was crying from laughing so hard. I can completely understand how he grabbed the wrong ones, but I couldn‚Äôt contain my laughter! Poor Bandit!!
After going back to our room, we packed our bags and got items around to slackpack. Erin dropped off some day bags for us to use, so we packed those up with food and water. Then I spent the rest of the day eating pizza and watching impractical jokers. It was a blast! Today was a good day to zero!","Bennington, VT

We woke up early (too early) to get picked up by Erin so we could slackpack 22.6 miles. Today was the best I felt hiking in a long time!
VerMUD lived up to its name. Mud everywhere! By the time we were done hiking for the day, it looked like we had went to battle. My brand new shoes no longer look new. It was a slippery walk as well today. Every time someone would slip and squeak ‚Äúwoop!‚Äù Or ‚Äúahhh‚Äù or any other high pitched noise, we would follow it up by ‚Äúhee heee‚Äù because we all sounded like Michael Jackson out there.¬†
We sang a lot today. Meaning, I sang a lot today. I was so happy! The weather was gorgeous! It was just a great day to be hiking. It also felt good to not have weight on my back. The pine was also beautiful!¬†
When we finished our hike for the day, and we were walking to Erin‚Äôs vehicle, we saw Miss Janet! We haven‚Äôt seen her since Erwin. We chatted for a little bit. We also saw spreadsheet! He‚Äôs doing well, too!
Erin was so kind! She had a bag for all of us to put our muddy socks into, so we could put our camp shoes on and so she could wash our socks for us! She even washed some of our clothes when we got back!¬†
Toaster and I took a shower in the house, while Moose Jaw, Bandit, and Bob Ross went to their neighbors house to clean off in the outdoor shower. Moose loved it! Then they got a ride back in the ‚Äúawesome-mobile!‚Äù
Scott and Erin made us all fajitas for dinner and they were delicious!! We all hung out at the picnic table outside of their house and ate food, laughed a lot, and swapped stories. Their neighbor Nancy joined us with one of her three daughters. Eli (Scott and Erin‚Äôs son) also joined us!
For dessert we had vanilla ice cream with their homemade maple syrup (they even tap their own maple trees). And I have to say, even though I felt like Elf, IT WAS DELICIOUS!!! I will have to have that for dessert more often!! We will be sure to send my parents some.¬†
There were four cots and two air mattresses set up in the barn (a very large and nice barn!). Before we knew it, it was time for bed. Erin and Scott are AWESOME! I hope that moose jaw and I are gracious, hospitable, and fun like they are! We felt right at home and enjoyed ourselves tremendously!! We have definitely made more lifelong friends!","Bennington, VT

Chili Pepper & Moose Jaw,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668030,"This morning was amazing: waking up in the barn was surprisingly peaceful! The sun rose and shined directly into the barn doors that were open through the night. Scott made eggs and sausage sandwiches and Erin made French press coffee. Around 9 we saddled up and packed everything into the minivan for the 45 min. Drive back to the trailhead. We tried to offer Scott and Erin money in various forms. They were having none of it. After moose was denied the third attempt to get them to let us fill up their gas tank, we instead prioritized purchasing some homemade maple syrup from them (which was delicious!!). Getting back to trail we all had the familiar feelings of dread: even when the weather is good it‚Äôs difficult to return some days.¬†
The first 4 miles we all uphill climb to get to the Stratton Mountain fire tower and Ski lift. The views were beautiful, the pine trees smelled so good, and the fire tower had excellent panoramic views of the surrounding mountains as well. Surprisingly the muddy parts of trail were scarce at first, which did not last for very long after the descent from the peak. Towards the end of the day, before the last two miles, the trail took us to one of the best views we had seen in a long time. It was called prospect view. It was gorgeous! From there we hiked to the shelter.¬†
At the shelter we saw legs and scissor hands again. We haven‚Äôt seen them since Warwick. We also saw and met a bunch of other NOBO hikers today. We started to make dinner at the picnic table, but then it started to rain. After eating and making dinner in the shelter, we headed to our tent. It started to rain much harder. Unfortunately, it was raining so hard that the rain was splattering up under the tarp to the inside of our tent. We had puddles of water inside the tub. We took a small pack cloth to wipe up as much water as we could. It helped some, but the inside of our tent is still soaked. We hate that. But it is what it is! That‚Äôs what happens when it rains hard. Hopefully we can dry out our tent tomorrow.¬†

Chili Pepper & Moose Jaw,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668031,"I saw a bear today!! Moose Jaw and I were hiking along this morning and I heard some rustling. Next thing I knew, a bear cub shot across the trail running ridiculously fast! If I would have blinked, I would have missed it! I was so happy to see one!! Thankfully, it‚Äôs mama wasn‚Äôt nearby. At least, not that we could tell!
When Moose and I woke up this morning, we did want to do anything. Everything was wet! Including our sleeping pads. The rain really did a number on our tent and things inside the tent last night. It made it hard to want to do anything.¬†
About 6 miles into our hike, we made it to the top of Bromley. At the top was a ski lift and a warming lodge. Apparently they keep it open for hikers. At the top, we set out our tent, tarp, and sleeping pad to dry. It was so windy that it everything dried rather quickly! Inside the warming hut, there was a dryer. The gentleman doing repairs said we could use it to dry our things. I dried my tank top.¬†
As we were packing up our things, the handle to the door broke. A bunch of hikers were stuck inside, including me. Bandit got the handle off and the door open. The gentleman repairing the handle made me laugh, because he made a Shrek quote about onions having layers. I added, ‚ÄúWhat about parfaits? Everyone loves parfaits!‚Äù He laughed and asked me how old I am. Apparently I‚Äôm the same age as his daughter. We laughed about the movie Shrek.¬†
The rest of the day seemed to drag. It was muddy, rocky, and there were roots galore. It makes walking at a good pace quite challenging. We were so happy when we made it to camp. It‚Äôs been getting darker sooner, so we were practically eating dinner in the dark. We already miss the longer days.¬†

Moose Jaw and I got out of camp early today!! I was proud of ourselves! Except, we slowed up a little bit when we stopped at the next shelter to use the privy and filter some water from a nearby stream.¬†
Today was a really nice hiking day! We finally got up into the pines and it was gorgeous! We went through a ‚Äúrock garden‚Äù that was an area with a bunch of rocks. But like cool looking rocks. And then we walked to an area called white rocks, where there were nothing but a bunch of cairns everywhere! It was cool! We (including Toaster and Bandit) each added a rock to a cairn.¬†
We hit some trail magic from a former thru-hiked named patio for lunch! We got some delicious hot dogs, sweet tea, and bagels!! It was nice that we didn‚Äôt have to cook our own food for lunch.¬†
After lunch, we tackled a large incline up a mountain and made it to a bridge over a gorge. It was awesome!! The water was gushing, and apparently this time of the year it‚Äôs nearly dry!! Magic Feather and her husband met us at the parking lot right after the bridge. She took us to get some ice cream down the road. Moose Jaw got a milkshake and I got a waffle cone with coffee health bar ice cream! It was delicious!!! From there Magic Feather took us to a grocery store to resupply. She also gave us some reusable bags, since Vermont does not have plastic bags. From there, we went back to her house.¬†
I can say, VERMONT IS GORGEOUS!! I absolutely love Vermont. All parts except for the muddy trail and the rain. For dinner, they made us sweet corn, steak, and a bean salad. The food was incredible!! When I was helping shuck the sweet corn, one of the cons had a baby corn attached!! It was crazy! I had never seen that before!
Magic Feather and her husband have been so generous to all of us, and we are so grateful! They spoiled us, and we enjoyed their company immensely!! We hope to visit Vermont again sometime after trail!¬†
We took showers at Magic Feather‚Äôs house and then we slept in her barn on our sleeping pads. Toaster and I were attacked by giant moths when the lights were on! It was much better once they were turned off!!

Today was interesting! HA! We woke up early and had a delicious breakfast at Magic Feather‚Äôs. She made a yummy egg casserole dish that I practically inhaled!! As I was rolling up my sleeping pad, I did see a squished dead moth‚Ä¶ so not all of them escaped my frantic swatting last night!!
When Magic Feather dropped us off at the trailhead, we met up with Bob Ross and his wife (she‚Äôs visiting before she starts her new job). She grabbed our packs so we could slackpack today!! Which was flipping awesome!!!! Of course as we arrived it started raining.¬†
Bob Ross: ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm giving up early today.‚ÄùEveryone Else: *agrees*
We hiked up Killington Peak today. Second tallest peak in Vermont. At the top, we did not have a view because we were in the clouds! So, Toaster, Bob Ross, Stogie, Moose Jaw, and I walked around the other side of the peak to the gondola. We got a free round trip ride! It was so much fun!! Plus, once we got under the clouds, we had a wonderful view of the mountains!! Vermont is so beautiful!!
After that, it was a race to the Inn!! And let me tell you, the Inn is an awesome place!! Irish everything!! As we were about to cross the street, we ran into Haze and Witch Doctor. Haze was on crutches. He apparently got a tent stake through his foot! He showed us the x-Ray, and it was WILD!!! He should be healed enough to walk in another week!
The Inn is great! We received loaner clothes to wear while doing our laundry, and we hung out at the tavern to eat supper with the others in our group. We all decided to take a zero tomorrow. Bob Ross planned on taking one anyways with his wife. Bandit rolled his ankle, and it needs rest. And Moose Jaw had been wanting to zero here for over a week now. So, we are going to make it happen!
While eating, we also saw squirt, fog hat, and witch doctor. There were also a bunch of other hikers from the Long Trail. This trail goes from north to south in Vermont and is 270 miles long! After eating, I went to bed early after showering. Moose Jaw hung out with a bunch of people much longer.¬†

Today was flipping awesome! Moose Jaw and I slept in, and then moseyed to breakfast around 9. After a delicious breakfast with an insane hot chocolate that had chocolate drizzle, a mound of whipped cream, and star sprinkles, we headed back upstairs,‚Ä¶ for a nap! We slept so hard. I guess we were just exhausted from the 1700 miles we have hiked.
After our nap, we did laundry. The loaner clothes the office let us borrow were comfortable. After our laundry was done we walked downstairs to the Tavern for lunch. Brogan served us and he was very kind. He told us about the Yellow Deli cult in Rutland, VT. It was quite the conversation. And bunch of hikers go there to sleep in their hostel.¬†
After hanging out at the tavern for like three hours, we walked back upstairs. I could have taken another nap, but I chose to call in my prescription and to upload the journal entries and photos. Then‚Ä¶ we went back downstairs for dinner. üòÇ What can we say, we didn‚Äôt want to have to take the local bus to go anywhere. It was much easier to stay in the Inn all day long.

We ate dinner with Toaster, Bob Ross and his wife Jaime, Stogie, and Bandit. It was fun! I got a delicious chicken pot pie that I slammed!! Plus we purchased root beer floats that were also delicious!!

Chili Pepper & Moose Jaw,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668358,"Today was a good day, but it felt like there was something in the air today affecting hikers‚Äô brains.¬†
1) As we (Toaster, Moose Jaw, and I) were heading to trail, there were three other hikers hiking the Long Trail (totals 270 miles, and they were 100 miles in). It was raining, so we all wanted to get to trail to get a little bit of tree coverage. But it felt like an awkward race. They cut off Moose Jaw and Toaster just to hike slowly. Thankfully, eventually they let them pass. It was weird, since they knew we were thru-hikers and we had nearly 18 miles to hike compared to their 7.¬†
2) At a water break we met two NOBOs. We asked when they started trail. They said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ mid to late March.‚Äù Toaster looked at them weird. We have NEVER met a hiker who did not know their exact start date. So then, we were all like‚Ä¶ why are you being sus about your start date‚Ä¶ it was awkward. So, we just walked away.¬†
3) We ran into a SOBO hiker today and he asked us for water‚Ä¶ in Vermont‚Ä¶ that literally has water everywhere due to the flooding. Moose gave him our water, but like who hikes 500 miles and does not make sure they have enough water for camp. He even told Stogie he passed up the previous water source because he didn‚Äôt want to hike an additional 0.2 miles to get some. It was weird. We call those hikers, entitled hikers. I hope he doesn‚Äôt pull that again. You have to be smart about your water. Always know where your next water source is, and if camp has water.¬†
Bandit took another zero today. He rolled his ankle again yesterday, which makes two times in the past three days! We hope it heals and he feels better! Bob Ross is slackpacking a lot of miles today and tomorrow so he can take another zero in Hanover, NH on Thursday! Stogie started earlier than all of us. Moose Jaw and I slept in a little bit and then went downstairs to have breakfast. Bandit arrived not much longer so he joined us! His company was lovely, and breakfast was wonderful!! I got a hot chocolate with breakfast, and they added a mound of whipped cream and chocolate syrup with sprinkles on top! It was magical!! I was so excited!! Then begrudgingly we packed the rest of our gear after breakfast and headed into the rain (around 10 in the morning) to start our hike.¬†
Today wasn‚Äôt bad. The terrain wasn‚Äôt awful, but it felt challenging. Well, come to find out, we hiked nearly 5,000 ft in elevation today. So, I guess that makes sense as to why I was tired when I arrived at camp!! Today was a quiet hiking day. We all listened to music and audiobooks. It was a nice change of pace.
It has been getting colder and darker earlier. Unfortunately, we will have to put on our wet clothes in the morning. When it‚Äôs cold, our clothes never actually dry. But, that‚Äôs what happens on trail.¬†

I don‚Äôt know how he got his trail name, but he should have gotten it because he‚Äôs always in a fantastic mood!!
When the rain slowed to a drizzle, we packed up our soaking wet tent and started hiking. Lots of incline again today! But at least the trail was nice!¬†
We ran into Patio again doing trail magic. We got some soda and then kept walking on.¬†
For lunch we ate at a really nice shelter and met some SOBO hikers! They gave us some good tips for places to stay up in NH and ME.¬†
Finally we made it to West Hartford, VT. The trail follows the road for a short while. We stopped at a place called the Blue Barn for sodas and Domino‚Äôs pizza. However, down the road was a lovely couple whom let‚Äôs hikers camp in their yard. The blue barn was pretty full, so we walked over to Captain Stash‚Äôs and Scooter‚Äôs house.

We woke up and hiked into Norwich that was just outside of Hanover to resupply at a small little gas station store. They had really good food there, too! So we ate an early lunch/late breakfast consisting of prepackaged sushi, chicken salad sandwich, donuts, melon, sodas, and Powerade. We met a local named Mike as we were sitting outside the store eating our food. He was really kind and social. He nearly tore the tendon of his quad off! It was only 20% attached so he had surgery and it rehabilitating. He‚Äôs taking it slow, which is good! He doesn‚Äôt want to injure it again. I don‚Äôt blame him! He was super fun to talk to!
From the resupply store we crossed into New Hampshire into Hanover. We actually walked right through Dartmouth University. School hasn‚Äôt quite started yet.

Next we walked and got a free slice of pizza from Ramunto‚Äôs Pizza and a free donut from Lou‚Äôs Bakery! They were delicious!! We ate an early dinner at Molly‚Äôs. They had $3 margaritas there.

As we neared the shelter 0.7 miles out from camp to use the privy, it started to rain. And then it poured. We sat in the shelter for about an hour, before we decided to head out. About 30 minutes into our hike, the rain let up. We were shocked and happy!! To our surprise, the rain held off for the rest of the day!! It was awesome!!
We received some trail magic sodas in a cooler today!! They were delicious!
The terrain was muddy, as usual. That seems to be the norm now. At lunchtime, we had a great view of the mountains as we sat in the shelter making our food. We were all wet with a mixture of sweat and rain. When we sit for too long, we have to put our rain jackets on to block the wind from making us too cold since we are constantly wet!
At five, we were done hiking for the day and we got picked up by the Inn. We were scared for our lives when our driver decided to roll down her window and yell out to say hi at someone and the car started crossing the middle line.

We though NH would be less muddy than Vermont. We were sorely mistaken. Everything is WET! But man, the views are gorgeous so far!!! I can‚Äôt wait for the views in the Whites!! We enter the Whites in two days.¬†
This morning we woke up and had breakfast. I wasn‚Äôt super hungry so I gave the rest of my food to Moose. We didn‚Äôt get to trail until some time last 10, since the B&B was busy with a family reunion. We were dropped off and less than five minutes into hiking, I slipped on the mud and my foot sank deeply into mud water. I cried. I was at my wits end with the mud, and I was tired of having wet feet. It‚Äôs a dumb thing to cry over, but when you finally have clean clothes to wear, you try to keep them clean for as long as possible. This includes socks and gaiters. So, I sad walked for awhile until I got over it. Later I did the same thing. This time instead of crying, I was just happy it was the same foot. I‚Äôd rather have one wet and dirty foot than two!!
We eventually made it up to a fire tower at the top of one of the many mountains we have hiked. We climbed up the tower, and the view was breathtaking! We could actually see mountains we have climbed along with ones we will be climbing in the next couple of days! It was awesome!!!
From there we hiked to the next shelter. We made and ate dinner there, because Moose and I planned to hike further. Toaster and Stogie decided to stay because they were pretty tired. Also, Bob Ross and Bandit were going to camp there. Stogie missed Bob Ross and Toaster missed Bandit. Since the shelter was on the side of the mountain, tenting was extremely limited. Plus a group of Boy Scouts arrived, and they grabbed a bunch of tent sites. I get bad for them, because the sites looked like garbage. I hope they sleep well! As Moose and I were heading out, the boys brought over some candy for us to have. It was so kind of them!! And it was a nice surprise!! Trail magic from other hikers mean a lot, because they never have a lot to give, and what they give you you know that they have carried it. So, trail magic from other hikers is the most special kind of trail magic.¬†
Moose and I hiked in the dark for a little bit and found a stealth spot near where we wanted to be for the night. It was perfect!! Extremely flat, on pine needles, dry, and out of the wind. We set up camp quickly and climbed in our tent, just to sit down and eat food!! HA! Then we set up our mats and climbed in. Today was a good day. An emotional day. But a good one!

So, yesterday at the fire tower, I shared a snickers bar with Moose Jaw. Then at dinner time I told Moose, ‚ÄúI wish I would have packed out another snickers.‚Äù Then 30 minutes later, the boys in the boys scouts walked over and said they had some candy for us. What do you know,‚Ä¶ they had snickers!!! I was like, ‚ÄúGod heard me today, and blessed me with this small gift.‚Äù Moose went and said, ‚ÄúWell, in that case, I want a cold Red Bull. Maybe we can get one in a creek or something.‚Äù
Fast forward to today. We were halfway through our hike and we had to cross the road. On the other side of the street was a sign leading us to the trail (so a trailhead sign). Sitting on top of this sign was an unopened semi-cold Red Bull!! Moose and I were in absolute disbelief!! We looked around for an owner, but there was absolutely no one there!!! So I told moose that God was probably like, ‚Äúwatch this!‚Äù HAHAHA! Anyways, it was wild! And we enjoyed sharing this Red Bull!
Our hike today was nice. It felt pretty relaxed compared to the past week. We made it to the hostel early in the afternoon. So we got first dibs on the outdoor shower. The shower was great and had plenty of steaming hot water!! The hostel shuttled us to a Market/Gas Station where we got a ton of food to eat for dinner and breakfast. Since we were so hungry, we basically got everything. As soon as we got into the car, we started eating. We ate the rest of our food at the picnic table outside. After a little while I went to the bunkhouse and laid down. I stayed there until bed time. My feet were hurting and tired.

After she headed out to head back to Vermont, Moose and I finally got to take showers and get into our sleep clothes. Then we chatted for awhile with Bandit and Toasted before crawling into bed.¬†

Chili Pepper & Moose Jaw,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668394,"When we woke up this morning, we got a ride back to trail to slackpack kinsman mountain. I was impressed with how quickly we hiked 3000 ft in elevation! Looks like 1800 miles is paying off. As we neared the top, there was a lot of rock scrambling to the top. However, once we got to the top, the view was breathtaking! We sat ip there and ate our snacks. From where we were sitting, we could see Moosilauke on our right (the mountain we hiked yesterday) and on our left we could see the Franconia Ridge (the mountain range we would be hiking tomorrow). The Franconia ridge includes 4K peaks Mt. Liberty, Mt. Lincoln, and Mt. Lafayette. We got a picture of both sides.¬†
We stopped at the Eliza Brook shelter for lunch. There were a ton of other hikers there including Shit Water, Love Child, Loaf, and Oil Change. We are our lunch and continued hiking. When we made it back to the ski club, there was a former hiker at the picnic table with her husband providing trail magic for the hikers! We got some delicious sodas and zebra cakes. Moose Jaw got a sour IPA that was yummy! We were so happy. She also dropped a lot of knowledge about sumitting Katahdin and obtaining permits. This made me feel much better about what we have to do!
Then we showered and headed to dinner. Service was slow and I was exhausted, so as soon as we paid our bill, I headed back for a good night‚Äôs rest. I knew we had a tough couple of days coming up!
So far, the Whites have been beautiful! I‚Äôm happy to be here on trail!","Kinsman Notch

Chili Pepper & Moose Jaw,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668396,"I fell today. I almost cried, but I held it in! Today was hard. I‚Äôm exhausted. I guess that‚Äôs the Whites for ya! But man, the views were üòçü§©!! 11 out of 10!!¬†
We woke up this morning and got some breakfast sandwiches from the mini mart caddy corner from the ski lodge. They were cheap and delicious! When we got our things packed and around, Toaster, Bandit, Moose Jaw and I got a ride back to trail. We were going to hike the Franconia Ridge today! As Jeff was shuttling us to trail, we past the Indian Head Lodge. There was a sign here about an Alien abduction, where a couple lost two hours of their lives. As we were reading the sign, we heard bandit start laughing. We turned around, and Jeff had put a green alien mask on and told us we were vortexes into the lodge. Which, was going to be true, since we would be back in two days since we planned on taking a zero there. We were all laughing at his mask and taking pictures.¬†
Franconia Ridge was breath taking! We spent quite a few miles above tree line, and we could even see Mt. Washington in the distance (which we will be hiking up in a few days). All you could see were mountain ranges after mountain ranges. It‚Äôs crazy how they seem so far away when it‚Äôs really only a few miles. Or a couple of days hike away when it feels like eternity when you‚Äôre at the top. Everything was so green, and the sky was so blue. We had the perfect weather!¬†
When we were hiking, a former thru-hiker from Germany came up to us and gave us trail magic! Some Reese‚Äôs cups! I was so surprised! His name was Brake-less since he was a speedy hiker. He only took 12 zeroes!¬†
Moose Jaw wanted a funny photo of us, so we used our arms to spell out YOLO (you only live once). This is such a cliche saying, but we thought the picture would be too funny to deny a photo. To our surprised, it turned out pretty dang good! It‚Äôs one of our favorite photos now. HA!
At the last peak on the ridge, we ate lunch. I laid down on a rock and rested my eyes until Stogie and Bob Ross caught up to us. From there, the hike was pretty exhausting. I kept tripping over rocks, because I was so tired. A part of trail actually was a steep rocky decline down a waterfall! We honestly thought we were lost at first, because we thought there was no way the trail was a waterfall. But alas, it definitely was the trail!¬†
When we got to camp, which was a crazy stealth spot back in no man‚Äôs land, we set up three of our tents in the tiniest area! We were all on giant roots and rocks. And we basically all slept at an incline. That‚Äôs what happens when you try to find a free camping spot in the Whites. It was a tough squeeze, but we all had a great time. We were definitely making memories.¬†
It‚Äôs feels good to be done for the day. I can‚Äôt wait for our zero coming up! Today was fun! Super challenging. But fun!","Cascade Brook

We woke up and it was pretty chilly this morning. I didn‚Äôt want to get out of my sleeping bag, but I knew we had to, because we were going to be picked up by the ski lodge again and take a zero tomorrow. It will be raining all day tomorrow, and we shouldn‚Äôt be hiking above tree line in that kind of weather.¬†
We started off with a rough 0.7 mile incline that took us almost an hour. Our legs are exhausted. From there, the rest of the day was much better! We had some more incredible views. The Whites are truly beautiful!¬†
Right off trail, halfway through our day we stopped at a hut for some water and a break. There was a couple there that gave me some trail magic, beef jerky! It was delicious! Their daughter wants to thru-hike next year!¬†
We finished hiking around 3, and waited for our shuttle. A lot more hikers showed up, so when our shuttle arrived, moose, stogie and I decided to wait. Shit water and love child hopped into the shuttle with Stogie, Toaster, and Bandit. Apparently, it was Shit Waters Birthday! An hour later, Legs and Scissorhands showed up. They were going back to the same place as us. We were already sitting with Loaf and Oil Change. They are actually from New Hampshire! And they offered to take Moose and I along with Legs and Scissorhands back to the ski club. So we got a free ride!! Stogie and three other hikers got picked up not much later!¬†
When we got to the ski club, we dropped our bags off and went straight to get food! Mozzarella sticks all around!! Dinner was a lot of fun! The six of us laughed a lot, and enjoyed sitting down. After dinner, Moose Jaw and I FaceTimed our nephew, Char Char. It was so much fun talking to him!! He is growing up so fast!¬†
After a fun dinner, we went back to the ski club, showered, and crawled into bed. Toaster found out her dog isn‚Äôt doing well, so she‚Äôs getting off trail for a few days to take care of her dog. It‚Äôs been pretty emotional for her. And the trail has been emotional enough for everyone. We all want to get done, but then at the same time, we don‚Äôt want to get off trail and finish! We love sleeping outside and meeting everyone! It‚Äôs been an emotional rollercoaster to say the least.","Stealth Site

Chili Pepper & Moose Jaw,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668400,"I tried to sleep in today, but I just couldn‚Äôt. So I got out of bed and started working on our chores. Moose and I skipped breakfast, so we were pretty hungry for lunch. Jeff dropped us off in Lincoln at the restaurant called Gypsy. Everyone (Bandit, Bob Ross, Toaster, Stogie, and Moose Jaw) except me got lobster rolls. They said they were delicious, and apparently we bought the restaurant out of lobster rolls! From there, we dropped brave little Toasted off at the bus stop. Well, technically she walked a quarter of a mile there. So, the rest of us went to the outfitter. I got a matching beanie so Moose Jaw and I could be twins. Yes, we are that couple. And yes, other hikers tell us how disgustingly cute we are. HA!¬†
From the outfitter, we went to the Price Chopper to resupply. They didn‚Äôt have much there. It was an extremely small store. So we weren‚Äôt in there long before we walked to the Purple Tomato so Bob Ross could get his second lobster roll. He‚Äôs trying to eat as many as he can so he can find the best one!¬†
When Jeff picked us up, he had another hiker in his vehicle. So we fit four of us in the backseat and one in the trunk. That was Bandit. The first go around, Bandit and I were both in the trunk. Good thing the trunk was not a typical sedan trunk, but an open one like a SUV.¬†
When we got back to the ski club, we started laundry. I felt so exhausted from the day. My feet were so swollen that my toes doubled in size, and my feet were throbbing. I was dealing with some bad news, so we decided that tomorrow we should zero as well. Everyone was on board. Plus, it‚Äôs one less day toaster will need to make up to catch up to us once she‚Äôs back on trail.¬†
The ski club did a hiker feed/dinner. For ten bucks we got all you can eat Alfredo with grilled chicken, garlic bread, salad, and cookies. We didn‚Äôt want to go out to eat, so this was perfect for us! And oh boy, it was yummy!! There were 35 hikers in the basement of the ski club eating dinner. It was so much fun! This isn‚Äôt a normal thing, 1) to have that many hikers at a hostel and 2) to have that many hikers eat together. This place is hoppin‚Äô!
Before we went to bed, we made root beer floats and played around with some brain puzzles that were sitting by the couches. Masters (that we haven‚Äôt seen since Virginia) and Day Walker joined us. I soon went to bed. I‚Äôm happy to crawl into bed and have some time to myself. That‚Äôs not common to have on trail.

When I work up, I got a chai tea and mailed some items home (mostly stickers). Then we walked back to the ski lodge and hung out. I showered and packed up our resupply while listening to some music. Then I joined bandit and moose jaw for lunch. We ate pizza rolls and pizza bagels.¬†
After lunch I decided to de-funkify out tent by spraying it with a laundry and disinfectant mixture. It needed something! It was smelling pretty ripe. I let it dry on the clothes line outside.¬†
For dinner we went out to eat with the typical crew plus day Walker (minus toaster). Before we left we saw electro and dos Entrados!! We haven‚Äôt seen them for awhile so we are glad they are doing well!! We also heard that Sherlock was in town. We were happy to hear that too! We miss him! At dinner we saw drunken monkey and she who sits and frowns (now her name is kaleidoscope). We haven‚Äôt seen them since Georgia!! Small world at this ski lodge! It seems to bring everyone together!! Stogie and Bob Ross saw Oppenheimer during the day while I just laid on my bunk uploading journal entries to trail journals.¬†
When we got back from dinner, we made a round of root beer floats. Moose Jaw and I have been on a root beer float kick because you get the best of both worlds,‚Ä¶ soda and ice cream!!

Chili Pepper & Moose Jaw,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668649,"Today was a good day! We woke up early so we could get back to trail by a certain time, however the clouds this morning were stunning! They hugged the mountains, and in one area it looked like a cloud waterfall. It was beautiful!
We had quite the incline today, but the views were incredible. We were above the tree line for most of our day. We stopped at the Mizpah Hut today for lunch, and Bandit, Moose Jaw and I ate lunch with Shit Water and Love Child. They are a lot of fun to talk to. I had to cook our food outside though, because open flames are not allowed in the building‚Ä¶ because the building is made of ‚Äúwood.‚Äù Which confused me. Houses are made of wood and so are the shelters‚Ä¶ but oh well! The huts are really nice but way out of our price range. The bunks go for $147 per night! That‚Äôs ridiculous!! The huts offer work for stay, but it‚Äôs not necessarily a good deal. You don‚Äôt get a bunk when you work. You actually have to sleep on the floor in the dining room. But it‚Äôs nice that they-hikers are allowed to sit inside at the tables for lunch.¬†
Bandit, Moose Jaw, and I hiked out from there over part of the presidential mountains to the Lake of the Clouds Hut. We will be summiting Mt. Washington tomorrow! At this particular hut, they have work for stay but they also have the grungiest concrete vault with a steel door they call the dungeon. This dungeon is less than 10‚Äôx10‚Äô, and it smells so musty. I‚Äôm sure someone will get breathing problems. Shoved inside are two bunks that have three beds in each bunk. The ceilings aren‚Äôt high, so each bunk is more like a tiny cubby hole. For only $10 (I hope you can sense my sarcasm) you get the opportunity to stay in this place. Of course, that‚Äôs where we are staying. I asked moose jaw if he was proud of me, because this is way outside my comfort zone. Absolutely disgusting. I must have been on a ‚Äúsurprise myself‚Äù kick because when I put my sleep clothes on, I didn‚Äôt wipe down my legs (I do this every night to clean the feet off of me along with the mud) and I put my sleep socks on. I didn‚Äôt do either. I‚Äôm disgusting. Who have I become!?¬†
Us thru-hikers ate our food outside the dungeon. It didn‚Äôt smell good because it was near the privies, but we had an amazing view and a good sunset. Plus we could see mt. Washington!!¬†
Later that evening, as we were brushing our teeth we saw Firewalker and Captain Fantastic! Apparently they were guided to the dungeon to sleep on the floor!! I was appalled. There were six hikers doing work for stay at the hut so I couldn‚Äôt understand why they couldn‚Äôt stay inside on the floor as well. I said something, because the floor can‚Äôt fit two hikers and it‚Äôs absolutely disgusting. No one should be sleeping there!! We are not trash. We are humans too. Too many times people look at thru-hikers as hiker trash instead of humans. It‚Äôs so sad. So thankfully, they got a place inside after we talked to a Croo member (and yes, croo is spelled weird here).¬†

Chili Pepper & Moose Jaw,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668650,"We woke up and hung out outside of the dungeon while we ate our breakfast. This was a lot of fun, and it was the first time we have done this in a long time on trail. Usually, everyone wants to get after it in the morning. So, once we had enough of hanging around, we hiked up to Mt. Washington in mist. I felt like a warrior! It was only 46 degrees out with 15 mph winds, and I was wearing a t-shirt. This is a big deal for me, because this is not normal! Moose Jaw would always call me a lizard, because I love the heat so much. It‚Äôs amazing how the body adapts to weather over only 5 months!¬†
We got some photos at the summit and at the weather sign. It was eerie in an amazing way, because there was no one up there. A cog usually takes people to the top, but the first cog doesn‚Äôt arrive until 10, so we got an hour at the top to ourselves and only a couple of other hikers. We walked into the gift shop, and the lady behind the counter gave us protein bars! She was so excited because it was her first time giving trail magic! The protein bars were quite delicious! We also saw Oil Change and Loaf here!
We then walked to the cafeteria to get a soda. The clouds started to dissipate, so we were getting some great views. Inside the cafeteria, Fire Walker and Captain Fantastic. Once we felt like we had taken a long enough break, we hiked on.¬†
Bandit and I really had to pee, so we took turns keeping watch while each of us peed on a cairn. The trail, was extremely rocky and completely open leading up to and six miles past Washington. The rocks continued once we made it to the tree line as well. Moose Jaw mooned the cog, because it‚Äôs thru-hiked tradition apparently. He thought it was hilarious.¬†
The rest of the day was painstakingly slow, due to the rock hopping and steep descents we encountered. We met some trail runners running across this section and I was amazed! I asked the couple if they were ultra runners, and they said yes. So, I said, ‚ÄúDaayyummm!‚Äù Then they asked me if I started hiking in Georgia, and I said, ‚ÄúYes!‚Äù Then they replied, ‚ÄúDaayyummm!‚Äù We all laughed! We were both impressed with each other, and I thought that was just awesome‚Äô
We stopped at hut to eat our lunch. For a dollar, Bandit purchased some coffee. It apparently was so awful, that as soon as Bandit tasted it, he got up and poured it out. We all started laughing! Even though we are hikers, we still have standards!
We made it to a stealth site right off trail that used to be an existing camp spot. We were surprised it wasn‚Äôt on our app FarOut, but we knew it was there because someone had made a comment that it was. The water nearby tasted dirty, so I added some drink packets to the water in order to cover up the awful taste. We all ceased into our tents and decided not to socialize. It‚Äôs been getting dark early and we were all exhausted. Plus it started to rain. So we just crawled into our to go to bed. Today was a good day!","Lakes of the Clouds Hut - Dungeon

Chili Pepper & Moose Jaw,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668651,"From our camp spot, we hiked to Pinkham Visitors Center. This place was right on trail. While we were headed there, we ran into Shit Water. We chatted for awhile. She‚Äôs really cool and chill. She actually is blogging for the Trek, which I think is pretty awesome. When we arrived to the visitor center, Moose Jaw and I purchased and ate some breakfast sandwiches. These sandwiches were delicious!! Of course we had some soda too!! Since we were running low on food, we also purchased some sandwiches to go for lunch. I considered packing out a soda, but then thought about the extra weight, so I decided against it. One mile back into trail, I regretted it. I think I may now have a soda addiction! Before trail, Moose Jaw and I never drank soda! Now, we drink it for the quick calories.¬†
We hiked an insane amount of incline today. Over 5400 feet in elevation over only 12 miles! We had a lot of steep descents and ascents. We hiked the wildcat range today in the White Mountains. As I was scrambling up a rock section, I was a little off balance and slammed my hip into the side of a giant boulder. I fell one other time today as well. Thankfully, I didn‚Äôt really injure myself besides the bruises these falls have left. Near the top of Wildcat, there was a ski lift. We were so sad it wasn‚Äôt running, because we all wanted to ride it down the mountain and go into town,‚Ä¶ we all just felt so exhausted. So instead, we just sat down and ate some snacks.¬†
Bandit, Moose Jaw, and I kept seeing moose tracks on the trail. We haven‚Äôt spotted any moose yet, but we hope that we see one while hiking before the trip is over! Well, see one from a distance that is. At the top of Wildcat, we stopped to drink some water. Bandit looked at a tree, and saw something hanging in it. He said, ‚ÄúWhat the hell!?‚Äù And grabbed this small item hanging from a tree. IT WAS A GEOCACHE!!! We opened it and he signed the ledger. Also inside was a tag that you can log your location into, take it, and place it at another location. It was so cool!! We couldn‚Äôt believe that he found one!! We were all very excited!
We made it to another hut around four, so thats when we finally were able to eat our lunches. Bob Ross arrived, and he told us that he messed up his shin. When we took a peek, we saw an absolutely GIANT knot on his shin. Apparently, he stepped on a piece of boardwalk, and he didn‚Äôt realize it was broken. So, one end of the broken piece shot up and hit him in the shin. He was upset because he was hurt my something man-made that made the trail worse than something naturally existing on trail. We felt bad for him!
Around 5:30, we deuces to hike up to Carter Dome. Our legs were exhausted, but we knew we needed to push, because it‚Äôs supposed to rain tomorrow and we knew we would be hiking much slower tomorrow. The trail is nothing but rocks, and they are extremely slippery when wet. So, Moose Jaw, Bandit, Bob Ross, and I hiked up a steep incline to the top of Carter Dome. We found a stealth spot for Bandit, and another large spot that would fit Stogie and Bob Ross. We couldn‚Äôt find any more, so Moose Jaw and I hiked on to find a spot for ourselves. We found a spot a mile later. It wasn‚Äôt the best place, but we made it work! There were two other tents there, so we squeezed ours in. It was beautiful at this spot, and I couldn‚Äôt believe how peaceful and serene the area was! It‚Äôs nights like this, that make me love the woods!","Bluff Campsite (Stealth Site)

Chili Pepper & Moose Jaw,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668652,"Although we didn‚Äôt have the best tent site last night, but it was extremely quiet and peaceful at the top of Mount Hight. I really liked that, because even in the woods things can seem chaotic. Bandit caught up to us at our tent site and waited for us to pack up our tent. Then we hiked 0.1 to the peak of Mount Hight. The views were absolutely stunning! We had a 360 degree view in the middle of the whites. We could even see Mt. Washington! There were several layers of clouds and they hung down low in the valley. The mountain peaks looked like little islands above the clouds. Absolutely breathtaking. I can‚Äôt believe these are the views we get to see first thing in the morning.¬†
From there we walked a couple of more slow miles, and then the rain finally came. We love rain. And soggy clothes. And slippery rocks. And river trail. And mud. While we were hiking, we just kept stating all of the things we hate about trail, but saying out loud that we love all of those things instead. Hence, the ‚ÄúI love rain.‚Äù ‚ÄúI wish it would rain harder.‚Äù ‚ÄúI love it when my pants feel like a soggy diaper.‚Äù ‚ÄúI love it when I slip in the mud and almost die.‚Äù It actually makes us laugh a lot on trail. For three hours straight we said things like this and sang lots of songs.¬†
After the rain subsided, we thought ‚Äúthis is nice.‚Äù Even though we were moving slow and everything on our person was soaking wet. So we slowly walked down steep mountains and up wet rocks. Just for it to start raining again. Except harder and colder. We were like, ‚ÄúI love it when the rain is cold.‚Äù HA! I nearly fell twice. Meaning I caught myself before I could really hurt myself. Both times my adrenaline was pumping.¬†
Today was tough because there was about 5200 ft of decline today, and it was painstakingly slow. The rocks were so slippery. Plus, any incline we did was rough, because our legs and knees were exhausted from the day before. We didn‚Äôt even stop for lunch. We are what little snacks we had in our Fanny packs and only stopped once to filter water. We all walked to the parking lot hangry.¬†
The hostel picked us up, and right away we were inundated with rules. Normally rules are fine, but the rules at this particular hostel were outrageous. We will be kicked out by 9 am tomorrow, so we plan on going to the park to dry our tents and plan our resupply. Then hitch to Walmart. So, we all showered and started our laundry. Then we (Bandit, Bob Ross, Moose Jaw and I) walked around the corner to get dinner. We felt much better after we ate. Bob Ross was cracking us up at dinner time. He‚Äôs come back much more talkative ever since he spent time with his wife. We like this version of Bob Ross. It‚Äôs great!!¬†
Before dinner, I noticed my knee had bumps all over it and it hurt. It definitely felt bruised. Then at dinner, I proceeded to knee the underside of the table with that same knee. Damn, it hurt like no other. I hate it when I injure myself off trail. I am only tolerant of injuries I get while walking. HA!
After dinner I went back to the Hostel while the boys stayed at the brewery and talked to Stogie, Journey, and Two Shoes. When I got up to take care of Moose‚Äôs cold soak dish, I came back to find Bandit laying in my spot on the bed next to Moose. I laughed and crawled into his bed. I told him he should be thankful that I don‚Äôt have to fart or I would. We both just laughed at that. Then we hung out on our bed and talked for awhile.¬†
Then lights off at 9! So I‚Äôm just laying in a bed next to 14 other beds separated by shower curtains at this hostel journaling. Today was good. I‚Äôm very thankful the rain wasn‚Äôt worse than it was and that we had great views this morning. I love being above the clouds and seeing tiny mountain peaks. It‚Äôs great!¬†
Discussion of the Day:
We were asked if we wanted a wash rag. All of us said, ‚Äúyes, please.‚Äù Then as we shower, we see that there is only bar soap. I thought this was disgusting, so I used shampoo out of the bottle to wash my body. So then, after showering I talked to Bandit, Moose Jaw, and Bob Ross about it. Bob Ross said it was disgusting! He saw a hair on the soap, and then he said, ‚ÄúWhy would you not use a wash rag if there was only bar soap!? You know someone washed their goods with that bar!‚Äù I could not agree more!! It‚Äôs gross!! So long story short, never use used bar soap!!","Stealth Site

Chili Pepper & Moose Jaw,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668653,"I didn‚Äôt sleep the best last night. I just kept waking up. Maybe I was stressed that we had to be out rather early. As I was getting my things around, I found out that someone took my shoes out of the drying box. That really upset me, because they were soaked from the rain yesterday and all I wanted were dry shoes. I wish hikers were more considerate of others.¬†
After packing our bags, we walked right across the street to the park to dry out our wet tents. There wasn‚Äôt much room to do so at the hostel, so we set up a line in the park between a tree and a pole to a swing. As we were waiting for our tents to dry, I found out from Bandit thru-hiking used to be called Tramping, and in some places it is still called that. I thought that was interesting!
We went to breakfast at a restaurant down the road. They had delicious French toast there! The two slices of bread sandwiched a piece of cheesecake. It was tasty! I got some eggs with bacon jam and beer bread. I tend to lean towards savory breakfasts! The food was extremely satisfying. The boys were still hungry once we left, so we walked to McDonald‚Äôs so they could have lunch. Before we went to the breakfast joint, they had first breakfast at the Cumberland Farms gas station across the street.¬†
From McDonald‚Äôs, we got a ride from Frosty (a former thru-hiker in 2021 that the boys met at the Brewery last night) to Walmart. He‚Äôs also a civil engineer! We smooshed five of us hikers into his truck. It was fun! We purchased food and packed our bear cans on the picnic table outside. Once we were all set, Frosty drove me to Subway to get a sandwich for lunch and then dropped us back off at the trailhead. I finished by sandwich by the time we arrived, so he took my trash for me!! He was extremely kind and generous to drive us around and wait on us! He said that it happened to him all of the time on trail when he hiked.¬†
0.1 miles into our hike, we hit 1900 MILES!!! I seriously cannot believe that I have walked 1900 miles. That‚Äôs WILD!! And CRAZY!! My feet are screaming at me per usual.¬†
As we were on trail, we passed by some section hikers. They are almost done section hiking the entire AT!! They saw us in town and left us a six pack of Pepsi at the trail head near where they parked! So, not much longer we all got to enjoy some more trail magic! The soda was delicious!
Then we got to walk uphill. Again. I‚Äôm surprised I‚Äôm not dead and that my legs can keep carrying me. Everyone is like ‚Äúfile your body.‚Äù Well,‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm pretty sure that no thru-hiked can fuel their body with the right foods. I told Moose Jaw today that I‚Äôm going to make my sister a ramen bomb when I‚Äôm done with trail to see if she likes it. A ramen bomb is ramen, instant potatoes, and packaged chicken. He said he thinks she would love it! In fact, he said she would thrive on trail food. Ramen, candy, chips, Little Debbie snacks, etc. She would be in Heaven. Minus the hiking and camping part. She would only like the food part. HA!¬†
Not only are we tired of steep inclines, but also mud. Which I just so happened to submerge one of my feet into about three miles in. I cried. And I told Moose Jaw that my foot looked ugly! I‚Äôm not sure why I said that. But then I also cried because my shoes were dry and I just did laundry. Now I get to wear dirty, muddy, smelly socks for four days instead of just smelly socks. HA! I guess I‚Äôm just tired.¬†
Bandit saved us a tent spot at camp. I was so thankful! As we were walking there, we ran into Iron Mike!! He did Moose‚Äôs ‚Äúbay signal‚Äù and howled ‚ÄúMooooose!‚Äù It was awesome! We all laughed. We chatted for awhile before we headed to our camp spot. It‚Äôs now getting cold! I rushed to put up our tent and hop in to put my warm sleep clothes on. I was lazy, so I cooked our dinner in our vestibule, while I sat on my mat. We had a ramen bomb and some Nutella afterwards. Dinner was yummy. As we were laying down getting cozy to fall asleep, Stogie texted us saying his backpack frame broke. Yikes! Looks like we will deal with that tomorrow! Today was a good day. I can‚Äôt wait to get to Maine tomorrow!

Chili Pepper & Moose Jaw,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668654,"This morning we left camp late, because Moose Jaw was fixing Stogie‚Äôs backpack. While they were working on his pack, Bandit and I jammed to some throwback tunes. We had a blast! When we finally left camp, the first four miles weren‚Äôt bad, but then it got sketchy and tough after that for the rest of our hike to the shelter. I fell three times today, and Stogie broke his trekking pole. In fact, he didn‚Äôt even make it to the shelter today. It was going to be too tricky to hike in the dark, so he decided to cowboy camp up on a peak 2.3 miles from the shelter. You may think 2.3 miles isn‚Äôt far, but it would take him about 2 hours. There were a lot of steep rock scrambles up and down the sides of the mountains we climbed today. Plus, there were a ton of mud bogs that were extremely challenging to figure out how to cross or get around. Today was just a really tough day. I know southern Maine is challenging just like the Whites, but I‚Äôm ready to be done hiking. I‚Äôm even worried for Katahdin, because I‚Äôm just tired of my legs being exhausted every day. Every time we go uphill, my legs burn and I‚Äôm out of breath. You‚Äôd never know that I have hiked 1900+ miles!! The good thing about today was,‚Ä¶ WE HIT MAINE!!! FINALLY THE LAST STATE!!! I am so absolutely happy!!!
Lunch was pretty good today. We packed out some frozen burritos yesterday, so they were thawed for lunch today. With some hot sauce, they were actually delicious!! Although, Bandit did not like that Moose Jaw kept farting. Then he blamed me for being guilty by association!! I laughed so hard at that!! Burritos and uncrustables are the way to go for lunch nowadays. They aren‚Äôt too bad!!
Today was okay. We met a lot of SOBOs today that enjoyed giving unsolicited advice‚Ä¶. So that was annoying. I‚Äôm glad today is over. Happy first of September! Last month on trail (and not even a full one)!","Trident Col Campsite

Chili Pepper & Moose Jaw,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668655,"We woke up this morning to a beautiful sunrise. As we started to get up and around, we chatted with the couple and their friend from Maine on the platform right beside us. They are so cool! They all go sail around the world, and they were sharing their stories with us! These three are so metal.¬†
Not long into hiking, we finally arrived to MAHOOSUC NOTCH! This is either the most challenging or the most fun mile on the entire trail,‚Ä¶ and I have to say, it was EPIC!!! We had so much fun going through this section! We had to take our packs off and climb through small tunnels in the rocks, we swung between large boulders in order to land on other boulders; it was a large adult jungle gym!! We laughed so much going through this section! We almost wanted to scramble through it again!! Right after we completed this section, we met two day hikers: Austin (Pound) and Liza (Cannibal). Austin thru-hiked the AT SOBO back in 2020. Up next, we climbed up the Mahoosuc Arm, which is supposed to be the steepest incline on the AT. However, it did not feel this way!! After the incline we had lunch on a rock. It was super comfy and peaceful. We had Uncrustables and candy for lunch. This was fun!
It was a rock scramble up Speck Mountain. As we were heading down, we ran into Ice Cream Man! I met him back on Max Patch, when he made me an arrow head out of an old bottle! He gave us some trail magic‚ÄîOreos!!! We were so excited! It gave us the energy we needed to make it to Grafton Notch. When we arrived there was trail magic, and our shuttle was there!! So, we got some soda and a burger and headed to the car!
We were picked up by Kevin. He helps out at the Bethel Village Motel owned and ran by a woman named Ruthie. Kevin says she‚Äôs a real Mainer, and even though he has been in Maine for 30 years, that he‚Äôs still a Mass-Hole. We laughed a lot about that! As he drove us to the Motel, he told us the history about the town. When we arrived, we were given trash bags for us to put our dirty laundry in. Ruthie does laundry for the hikers that stay here! We showered and then walked to Suds Pub for dinner. While Moose Jaw was playing Galaga, Bandit and I were seated (Bob Ross and Stogie didn‚Äôt make it into town, because it took them awhile to make it through Mahoosuc Notch). I order for Moose and I, and the waiter was appalled. He didn‚Äôt know my husband was eating with us, so he thought at first that I ordered all of the food for myself! It was hilarious!! The food was scrumptious!
We walked back to the motel and relaxed. I love it here!","Full Goose Shelter

Chili Pepper & Moose Jaw,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668659,"Mood: ü§©
TODAY. WAS. AWESOME!!!!¬†
Moose Jaw did not sleep in this morning!! He woke up at 5:30 roaring to go! I couldn‚Äôt believe it! I was like, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong with you!?!?‚Äù He just laughed manically, and said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know!!‚Äù (as he smothered me with a hug). I was cracking up. On zero days, you‚Äôre supposed to sleep in! That‚Äôs the rules that I made for zero days. HA! After we got out of bed, I grabbed all of our dirty clothes and took them to Ruthie, as she requested. When I opened the door, she said, ‚ÄúWhy aren‚Äôt you a pretty little thing!‚Äù That made me blush. I told her that I look and smell much better after showering. We both laughed. She was very sweet!!
We walked right next door to the Gemini Cafe for some breakfast sandwiches. While we were there, we ran into Liza and Austin (the couple we saw on trial yesterday)! We chatted for awhile. Apparently they met when he was on trail thru-hiking. She was hiking for the day, and they talked for awhile. Now they are married and live in Maine!! We thought that was so cool! After chatting for about ten minutes, they left to go home and we continued looking at our map for the rest of trail. We want to be done so badly!
After breakfast, we got a ride from Kevin to go to the outfitter down the road. It was so adorable when we got in the car, he told me that Ruthie walked back to say to him (after I dropped off my laundry) ‚Äúmy gosh, she‚Äôs pretty.‚Äù He was like, ‚ÄúI told her so!‚Äù I was laughing. It really made my day. I definitely don‚Äôt feel beautiful on trail. When we got to the outfitter, it was closed. So, we tried to find the owner but he must have been on vacation. So, we headed back to the motel to hang out and check things off our to-do list.¬†
As we were discussing what day we might summit Katahdin, we got a message from Liza inviting us to a cookout with her family! Moose Jaw and I thought that sounded fun, so we said yes! And of course, we decided to take another zero. Toaster called us, and she‚Äôs only two days behind! So, we thought, ‚ÄúEven more reason to take a zero!‚Äù We miss her, and she‚Äôs working so hard to catch up. We wanted to make sure that she could catch up to us sooner!¬†
Around 1:45, we got picked up by Austin and Liza. First of all, these two are amazing people, obviously generous and kind, fun, smart, and just bad ass!! They drove us to Liza‚Äôs parents‚Äô place! It was gorgeous with a beautiful view!! We met Liza‚Äôs mom Terry, and her step-father, Hank (Henry). We also met Grandma and some family friends, Tim and Candy. They made a delicious meal of burgers, chicken, hot dogs, corn on the cob, potato salad, cookies, and a fruit cobbler! We ate so much, we were stuffed!!!¬†
We sat on the patio for awhile chatting about trail. Austin lost 70 lbs on trail, and he was cracking us up about it! He said he lost an entire backstreet boy! HA! We talked about the little inside jokes and things we would say while on trail. We talked about trees laying across trail that have broken branches sticking out all over trying to impale you when you step across. He calls them neuter sticks. We were cracking up at that!! Then a bee flew by, and he called it a spicy fly. They will now forever be called spicy flies. HA!
After super we took a tour of the property (this is also where Liza and Austin got married and lived for their first year of marriage,‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs a small cabin also near the property owned by her step brother) on a side-by-side. Liza and Austin drove an ATV. WE HAD SUCH A BLAST!! It was a ton of fun. The state saying is correct, ‚ÄúMaine, the way life should be.‚Äù I agree with that. Moose and I felt so free and happy! Liza is a total bad ass! She drives a Harley Motorcycle and has done some incredible things! Austin is pretty cool too! We played corn hole after our tour and it was a lot of fun! Grandma watched and was obviously rooting for the girl‚Äôs team! She was cracking us up! She has a lot of spice and I love that!! Corn hole was a blast! We were laughing the entire time!¬†
It felt like we have known these two for forever! They are moving to Georgia in November, so I know we will definitely be seeing these two again! I hope we become great friends! As Liza said, ‚ÄúYou meet the best people on trail!‚Äù I have to agree with that!! This was the best trail magic we have received so far! We were at peace the entire time!! I love spending time with these two and their family! It was truly a surprise and blessing!
After they dropped us off, we hugged and headed back to our room to relax. I watched TV while Moose fell right asleep. Today was the best!","Grafton Notch
